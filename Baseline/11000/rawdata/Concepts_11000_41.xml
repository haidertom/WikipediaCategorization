      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2993">In [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]], an '''alief''' is an automatic or habitual [[belief]]-like attitude, particularly one that is in tension with a person's explicit beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://philpapers.org/rec/GENAAB |title=Tamar Szabó Gendler, Alief and Belief |publisher=PhilPapers |date=2009-01-27 |accessdate=2010-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a person standing on a transparent balcony may ''believe'' that they are safe, but ''alieve'' that they are [[acrophobia|in danger]]. A person watching a sad movie may ''believe'' that the characters are completely fictional, but their ''aliefs'' may lead them to cry nonetheless. A person who is hesitant to eat fudge that has been formed into the shape of feces, or who exhibits reluctance in drinking from a sterilized [[bedpan]] may ''believe'' that the substances are safe to eat and drink, but may ''alieve'' that they are not.

The term ''alief'' was introduced by [[Tamar Gendler]], a professor of philosophy and cognitive science at [[Yale University]], in a pair of influential articles published in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.philosophersannual.org/ |title=Philosopher's Annual |publisher=Philosophersannual.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the publication of these original articles, the notion of alief has been utilized by [[Tamar Gendler|Gendler]] and others — including [[Paul Bloom (psychologist)|Paul Bloom]]&lt;ref name="bloom"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bloom |first=Paul |date=2011 |title=How Pleasure Works: The New Science of Why We Like What We Like |publisher=W.

Morality and amorality in humans and animals is a subject of dispute among scientists and philosophers. If morality is intrinsic to humanity, then amoral human beings either do not exist or are only deficiently human.&lt;ref name="C. S. Lewis, Abolition of Man"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=Clive Staples|title=Abolition of Man|year=2010|publisher=Lits|isbn=1609421477|pages=60|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/augustine/arch/lewis/abolition1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; If morality is extrinsic to humanity, then amoral human beings can both exist and be fully human, and as such be amoral either by nature or by choice.

Amoral should not be confused with ''immoral'', which refers to an agent doing or thinking something he or she knows or believes to be [[wrong]].&lt;ref&gt;Page 24, COLLINS,new School Dictionary, 1999, {{ISBN|0 00 472238-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-human manifestations==
Any entity that is not [[sapience|sapient]] may be considered categorically amoral. For example, a rock may be used (by rational agents) for good or bad purposes, but the rock itself is neither good nor bad. In [[Ontology|ontological philosophy]], the [[Gnosticism|ancient gnostic]] concept that [[Demiurge|the material world was inherently evil]] applied morality to existence itself and was a point of concern in early Christianity in the form of [[Docetism]], as it opposed the notion that creation is good, as stated in [[The Book of Genesis]].&lt;ref name="Ignatius of Antioch"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Ignatius of Antioch|authorlink=Ignatius of Antioch|title=The Epistle of Ignatius to the Smyrnaeans|work=Ante-Nicean Fathers|volume=1|editor1-first=Alexander|editor1-last=Roberts|editor2-first=James|editor2-last=Donaldson|editor3-first=A.

===Animals===
Animals have long been thought to be amoral entities. However, research into the [[evolution of morality]], including [[Social animal|sociality]] and [[altruism in animals]], has sparked new debate amongst many philosophers. Many animals display behavior that is analogous to human moral behavior, such as caring for the young, protecting kin, and sharing the spoils of the hunt. Generally speaking, if this behavior is a voluntary response to ethical norms, then animals do have morality. If animals are involuntarily following innate instinct, then they are amoral.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

The availability of consequences associated with an action is positively related to perceptions of the magnitude of the consequences of that action. In other words, the easier it is to recall the consequences of something the greater those consequences are often perceived to be. Most notably, people often rely on the content of their recall if its implications are not called into question by the difficulty that they experience in bringing the relevant material to mind.&lt;ref name="schwarz"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schwarz|first1=Norbert|last2=Bless| first2=Herbert| last3=Strack |first3=Fritz |last4=Klumpp| first4=Gisela| last5=Rittenauer-Schatka| first5=Helga| last6=Simons| first6=Annette|title=Ease of retrieval as information: Another look at the availability heuristic|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1991|volume=61|issue=2|pages=195–202|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.61.2.195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview and history==
Prior to the work of Kahneman and Tversky, the predominant view in the field of human judgment was that humans are rational actors.  However, in the late 1960s and early 1970s, [[Amos Tversky]] and [[Daniel Kahneman]] began work on a series of papers examining "heuristic and biases" used in the judgment under uncertainty. They explained that judgment under uncertainty often relies on a limited number of simplifying heuristics rather than extensive algorithmic processing. Soon this idea spread beyond academic psychology, into law, medicine, and political science. This research questioned the descriptive adequacy of idealized models of judgment, and offered insights into the cognitive processes that explained human error without invoking motivated irrationality.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=FfTVDY-zrCoC&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=history+overview+OR+OR+OR+definition+%22availability+heuristics%22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title = Heuristics and Biases: The Psychology of Intuitive Judgment|date = 2002-07-08|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = |isbn = 9780521796798|author1 = Gilovich|first1 = Thomas|last2 = Griffin|first2 = Dale|last3 = Kahneman|first3 = Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt; One simplifying strategy people may rely on is the tendency to make a judgment about the frequency of an event based on how many similar instances are brought to mind. In 1973, Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman first studied this phenomenon and labeled it the "availability heuristic". An availability heuristic is a mental shortcut that relies on immediate examples that come to a given person's mind when evaluating a specific topic, concept, method or decision. As follows, people tend to use a readily available fact to base their beliefs about a comparably distant concept. There has been much research done with this heuristic, but studies on the issue are still questionable with regard to the underlying process. Studies illustrate that manipulations intended to increase the subjective experience of ease of recall are also likely to affect the amount of recall. Furthermore, this makes it difficult to determine if the obtained estimates of frequency, likelihood, or typicality are based on participants' phenomenal experiences or on a biased sample of recalled information.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

However, some textbooks have chosen the latter interpretation introducing the availability heuristic as "one's judgments are always based on what comes to mind". For example, if a person is asked whether there are more words in the English language that begin with a t or k, the person will probably be able to think of more words that begin with the letter t, concluding that t is more frequent than k.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = Heuristics and Biases: The Psychology of Intuitive Judgment|author1=Gilovich, T. D. |author2=Griffin, D. |author3= Kahneman, D. |date = 2002|work = |accessdate = |publisher = New York, NY: Cambridge University Press.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Chapman (1967) described a bias in the judgment of the frequency with which two events co-occur. This demonstration showed that the co-occurrence of paired stimuli resulted in participants overestimating the frequency of the pairings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chapman|first=L.J|title=Illusory correlation in observational report|journal=Journal of Verbal Learning|year=1967|volume=6|pages=151–155|doi=10.1016/s0022-5371(67)80066-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; To test this idea, participants were given information about several hypothetical mental patients. The data for each patient consisted of a clinical diagnosis and a drawing made by the patient. Later, participants estimated the frequency with which each diagnosis had been accompanied by various features of the drawing. The subjects vastly overestimated the frequency of this co-occurrence (such as suspiciousness and peculiar eyes). This effect was labeled the illusory correlation. Tversky and Kahneman suggested that availability provides a natural account for the illusory-correlation effect. The strength of the association between two events could provide the basis for the judgment of how frequently the two events co-occur. When the association is strong, it becomes more likely to conclude that the events have been paired frequently. Strong associations will be thought of as having occurred together frequently.&lt;ref name="tversky"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tversky|first1=Amos|last2=Kahneman|first2=Daniel|title=Availability: A heuristic for judging frequency and probability|journal=Cognitive Psychology|volume=5|issue=2|year=1973|pages=207–232|issn=0010-0285|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(73)90033-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Tversky &amp; Kahneman's first examination of availability heuristics, subjects were asked, "If a random word is taken from an English text, is it more likely that the word starts with a K, or that K is the third letter?" They argue that English-speaking people would immediately think of many words that begin with the letter "K" (kangaroo, kitchen, kale), but that it would take a more concentrated effort to think of any words in which "K" is the third letter (acknowledge, ask). Results indicated that participants overestimated the number of words that began with the letter "K" and underestimated the number of words that had "K" as the third letter. Tversky and Kahneman concluded that people answer questions like these by comparing the availability of the two categories and assessing how easily they can recall these instances. In other words, it is easier to think of words that begin with "K", more than words with "K" as the third letter. Thus, people judge words beginning with a "K" to be a more common occurrence. In reality, however, a typical text contains twice as many words that have "K" as the third letter than "K" as the first letter. There are three times more words with "K" in the third position than words that begin with "K".&lt;ref name="tversky" /&gt;

In Tversky and Kahneman's seminal paper, they include findings from several other studies, which also show support for the availability heuristic. Apart from their findings in the "K" study, they also found:
	When participants were shown two visual structures and asked to pick the structure that had more paths, participants saw more paths in the structure that had more obvious available paths. In the structure that participants chose, there were more columns and shorter obvious paths, making it more available to them. When participants were asked to complete tasks involving estimation, they would often underestimate the end result. Participants were basing their final estimation off of a quick first impression of the problem. Participants particularly struggled when the problems consisted of multiple steps. This occurred because participants were basing their estimation on an initial impression. Participants failed to account for the high rate of growth in the later steps due to the impression they formed in the initial steps. This was shown again in a task that asked participants to estimate the answer to a multiplication task, in which the numbers were presented as either 1x2x3x4x5x6x7x8 or 8x7x6x5x4x3x2x1. Participants who were presented the equation with the larger numbers first (8x7x6...), estimated a significantly higher result than participants with the lower numbers first (1x2x3...). Participants were given a short amount of time to make the estimation, thus participants based their estimates off of what was easily available, which in this case was the first few numbers in the sequence.&lt;ref name="tversky" /&gt;

== Explanations ==
Many researchers have attempted to identify the psychological process which create the availability heuristic.

Tversky and Kahneman argue that the number of examples recalled from memory is used to infer the frequency with which such instances occur. In an experiment to test this explanation, participants listened to lists of names containing either 19 famous women and 20 less famous men or 19 famous men and 20 less famous women. Subsequently, some participants were asked to recall as many names as possible whereas others were asked to estimate whether male or female names were more frequent on the list. The names of the famous celebrities were recalled more frequently compared to those of the less famous celebrities. The majority of the participants incorrectly judged that the gender associated with more famous names had been presented more often than the gender associated with less famous names. Tversky and Kahneman argue that although the availability heuristic is an effective strategy in many situations, when judging probability use of this heuristic can lead to predictable patterns of errors.&lt;ref name="tversky" /&gt;

Schwarz and his colleagues, on the other hand, proposed the '''ease of retrieval''' explanation, in which is the ease with which examples come to mind, not the number of examples, is used to infer the frequency of a given class. In a study by Schwarz and colleagues to test their explanation, participants were asked to recall either six or twelve examples of their assertive or very unassertive behavior. Participants were later asked to rate their own assertiveness. Pretesting had indicated that although most participants were capable of generating twelve examples, this was a difficult task. The results indicated that participants rated themselves as more assertive after describing six examples of assertive compared with unassertive behavior condition, but rated themselves as less assertive after describing twelve examples of assertive compared with unassertive behavior condition. The study reflected that the extent to which recalled content impacted judgment was determined by the ease with which the content could be brought to mind (it was easier to recall 6 examples than 12), rather than the amount of content brought to mind.&lt;ref name="schwarz" /&gt;

Research by Vaugh (1999) looked at the effects of [[uncertainty]] on the use of the availability heuristic. College students were asked to list either three or eight different study methods they could use in order to get an A on their final exams. The researchers also manipulated the time during the semester they would ask the students to complete the questionnaire.  Approximately half of the participants were asked for their study methods during the third week of classes, and the other half were asked on last day of classes. Next, participants were asked to rate how likely they would be to get an A in their easiest and hardest classes.  Participants were then asked to rank the difficulty they experienced in recalling the examples they had previously listed. The researchers hypothesized that students would use the availability heuristic, based on the number of study methods they listed, to predict their grade only when asked at the beginning of the semester and about their hardest final. Students were not expected to use the availability heuristic to predict their grade at the end of the semester or about their easiest final. The researchers predicted this use of availability heuristic because participants would be uncertain about their performance throughout the semester. The results indicated that students used the availability heuristic, based on the ease of recall of the study methods they listed, to predict their performance when asked at the beginning of the semester and about their hardest final. If the student listed only three study methods, they predicted a higher grade at the end of the semester only on their hardest final. If students listed eight study methods, they had a harder time recalling the methods and thus predicted a lower final grade on their hardest final. The results were not seen in the easy final condition because the students were certain they would get an A, regardless of study method. The results supported this hypothesis and gave evidence to the fact that levels of uncertainty affect the use of the availability heuristic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vaugh|first1=Leigh Ann|title=Effects of uncertainty on use of the availability of heuristic for self-efficacy judgments|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|volume=29|issue=2/3|pages=407–410|doi=10.1002/(sici)1099-0992(199903/05)29:2/3&lt;407::aid-ejsp943&gt;3.0.co;2-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Media===
After seeing news stories about child abductions, people may judge that the likelihood of this event is greater. Media coverage can help fuel a person's example bias with widespread and extensive coverage of unusual events, such as homicide or airline accidents, and less coverage of more routine, less sensational events, such as common diseases or car accidents. For example, when asked to rate the probability of a variety of causes of death, people tend to rate "newsworthy" events as more likely{{fact|date=November 2018}} because they can more readily recall an example from memory{{fact|date=November 2018}}. Moreover, unusual and vivid events like homicides, shark attacks, or lightning are more often reported in mass media than common and un-sensational causes of death like common diseases.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

For example, many people think that the likelihood of dying from shark attacks is greater than that of dying from being hit by falling airplane parts, when more people actually die from falling airplane parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legacy.sandiegouniontribune.com/uniontrib/20040222/news_mz1c22odds.html|title=Odds and ends - The San Diego Union-Tribune|website=legacy.sandiegouniontribune.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a shark attack occurs, the deaths are widely reported in the media whereas deaths as a result of being hit by falling airplane parts are rarely reported in the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Read|first=J.D.|title=The availability heuristic in person identification: The sometimes misleading consequences of enhanced contextual information|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|year=1995|volume=9|issue=2|pages=91–121|doi=10.1002/acp.2350090202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2010 study exploring how vivid television portrayals are used when forming social reality judgments, people watching vivid violent media gave higher estimates of the prevalence of crime and police immorality in the real world than those not exposed to vivid television. These results suggest that [[Research on the effects of violence in mass media|television violence]] does in fact have a direct causal impact on participants' social reality beliefs. Repeated exposure to vivid violence leads to an increase in people's risk estimates about the prevalence of crime and violence in the real world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Riddle|first=Karen|title=Always on My Mind: Exploring How Frequent, Recent, and Vivid Television Portrayals Are Used in the Formation of Social Reality Judgments|journal=Media Psychology|year=2010|volume=13|issue=2|pages=155–179|doi=10.1080/15213261003800140}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Counter to these findings, researchers from a similar study argued that these effects may be due to effects of new information. Researchers tested the new information effect by showing movies depicting dramatic risk events and measuring their risk assessment after the film. Contrary to previous research, there were no effects on risk perception due to exposure to dramatic movies.&lt;ref name="SjöbergEngelberg2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sjöberg|first1=Lennart|last2=Engelberg|first2=Elisabeth|title=Risk Perception and Movies: A Study of Availability as a Factor in Risk Perception|journal=Risk Analysis|volume=30|issue=1|year=2010|pages=95–106|issn=0272-4332|doi=10.1111/j.1539-6924.2009.01335.x|pmid=20055978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===
Researchers examined the role of cognitive heuristics in the [[AIDS]] risk-assessment process. 331 physicians reported worry about on-the-job [[HIV]] exposure, and experience with patients who have HIV. By analyzing answers to questionnaires handed out, researchers concluded that availability of AIDS information did not relate strongly to perceived risk.&lt;ref name="HeathAcklin1991"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heath|first1=Linda|last2=Acklin|first2=Marvin|last3=Wiley|first3=Katherine|title=Cognitive Heuristics and AIDS Risk Assessment Among Physicians|journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology|volume=21|issue=22|year=1991|pages=1859–1867|issn=0021-9029|doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.1991.tb00509.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Participants in a 1992 study read case descriptions of hypothetical patients who varied on their sex and sexual preference. These hypothetical patients showed symptoms of two different diseases. Participants were instructed to indicate which disease they thought the patient had and then they rated patient responsibility and interactional desirability. Consistent with the availability heuristic, either the more common ([[influenza]]) or the more publicized (AIDS) disease was chosen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Triplet|first=R.G|title=Discriminatory biases in the perception of illness: The application of availability and representativeness heuristics to the AIDS crisis|journal=Basic and Applied Social Psychology|year=1992|volume=13|issue=3|pages=303–322|doi=10.1207/s15324834basp1303_3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business and economy===
One study sought to analyze the role of the availability heuristic in financial markets. Researchers defined and tested two aspects of the availability heuristic:&lt;ref name="kliger"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kliger|first1=Doron|last2=Kudryavtsev|first2=Andrey|title=The Availability Heuristic and Investors' Reaction to Company-Specific Events|journal=Journal of Behavioral Finance|volume=11|issue=1|year=2010|pages=50–65|issn=1542-7560|doi=10.1080/15427561003591116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Outcome Availability&amp;nbsp;– availability of positive and negative investment outcomes, and
* Risk Availability&amp;nbsp;– availability of financial risk.&lt;ref name="kliger" /&gt;

On days of substantial stock market moves, abnormal stock price reactions to upgrades are weaker, than those to downgrades. These availability effects are still significant even after controlling for event-specific and company-specific factors.&lt;ref name="kliger" /&gt;

Similarly, research has pointed out that under the availability heuristic, humans are not reliable because they assess probabilities by giving more weight to current or easily recalled information instead of  processing all relevant information. Since information regarding the current state of the economy is readily available, researchers attempted to expose the properties of business cycles to predict the availability bias in analysts' growth forecasts. They showed the availability heuristic to play a role in analysis of forecasts and influence investments because of this.&lt;ref name="LeeO'Brien2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Byunghwan|last2=O'Brien|first2=John|last3=Sivaramakrishnan|first3=K.|title=An Analysis of Financial Analysts' Optimism in Long-term Growth Forecasts|journal=Journal of Behavioral Finance|volume=9|issue=3|year=2008|pages=171–184|issn=1542-7560|doi=10.1080/15427560802341889}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In effect, investors are using availability heuristic to make decisions and subsequently, may be obstructing their own investment success. An investor's lingering perceptions of a dire market environment may be causing them to view investment opportunities through an overly negative lens, making it less appealing to consider taking on investment risk, no matter how small the returns on perceived "safe" investments.   To illustrate, Franklin Templeton's annual Global Investor Sentiment Survey 1 asked individuals how they believed the S&amp;P 500 Index performed in 2009, 2010 and 2011. 66 percent of respondents stated that they believed the market was either flat or down in 2009, 48 percent said the same about 2010 and 53 percent also said the same about 2011.  In reality, the S&amp;P 500 saw 26.5 percent annual returns in 2009, 15.1 percent annual returns in 2010 and 2.1 percent annual returns in 2011, meaning lingering perceptions based on dramatic, painful events are impacting decision-making even when those events are over.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessinsider.com/the-availability-bias-is-driving-investor-decisions-2012-10. Franklin Templeton Investments. "Investors Should Beware The Role of 'Availability Bias'". Business Insider. Oct. 6, 2012. Dec. 1, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, a study by Hayibor and Wasieleski found that the availability of others who believe that a particular act is morally acceptable is positively related to others' perceptions of the morality of that act. This suggests that availability heuristic also has an effect on [[ethical]] decision making and ethical behavior in organizations.&lt;ref name="HayiborWasieleski2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hayibor|first1=Sefa|last2=Wasieleski|first2=David M.|title=Effects of the Use of the Availability Heuristic on Ethical Decision-Making in Organizations|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|volume=84|issue=S1|year=2008|pages=151–165|issn=0167-4544|doi=10.1007/s10551-008-9690-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
A study done by Craig R. Fox provides an example of how availability heuristics can work in the classroom. In this study, Fox tests whether difficulty of recall influences judgment, specifically with course evaluations among college students.  In his study he had two groups complete a course evaluation form.  He asked the first group to write two recommended improvements for the course (a relatively easy task) and then write two positives about the class. The second group was asked to write ten suggestions where the professor could improve (a relatively difficult task) and then write two positive comments about the course.  At the end of the evaluation both groups were asked to rate the course on a scale from one to seven.  The results showed that students asked to write ten suggestions (difficult task) rated the course less harshly because it was more difficult for them to recall the information.{{why|date= August 2013}} Students asked to do the easier evaluation with only two complaints had less difficulty in terms of availability of information, so they rated the course more harshly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fox|first=Craig R.|title=The availability heuristic in the classroom: How soliciting more criticism can boost your course ratings|journal=Judgment and Decision Making |year=2006 |volume=1|issue=1|pages=86–90|url=http://journal.sjdm.org/jdm06020.pdf|issn=1930-2975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criminal justice===
The media usually focuses on violent or extreme cases, which are more readily available in the public's mind. This may come into play when it is time for the judicial system to evaluate and determine the proper punishment for a crime. In one study, respondents rated how much they agreed with hypothetical laws and policies such as "Would you support a law that required all offenders convicted of unarmed muggings to serve a minimum prison term of two years?" Participants then read cases and rated each case on several questions about punishment. As hypothesized, respondents recalled more easily from [[long-term memory]] stories that contain severe harm, which seemed to influence their sentencing choices to make them push for harsher punishments. This can be eliminated by adding high concrete or high contextually distinct details into the crime stories about less severe injuries.&lt;ref name="Stalans1993"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stalans|first1=Loretta J.|title=Citizens' crime stereotypes, biased recall, and punishment preferences in abstract cases: The educative role of interpersonal sources.|journal=Law and Human Behavior|volume=17|issue=4|year=1993|pages=451–470|issn=1573-661X|doi=10.1007/BF01044378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar study asked jurors and college students to choose sentences on four severe criminal cases in which prison was a possible but not an inevitable sentencing outcome. Respondents answering questions about court performance on a public opinion formulated a picture of what the courts do and then evaluated the appropriateness of that behavior. Respondents recalled from public information about crime and sentencing. This type of information is  incomplete because the news media present a highly selective and non-[[representative sample|representative]] selection of crime, focusing on the violent and extreme, rather than the ordinary. This makes most people think that judges are too lenient. But, when asked to choose the punishments, the sentences given by students were equal to or less severe than those given by judges. In other words, the availability heuristic made people believe that judges and jurors were too lenient in the courtroom, but the participants gave similar sentences when placed in the position of the judge, suggesting that the information they recalled was not correct.&lt;ref name="DiamondStalans1989"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Diamond|first1=Shari Seidman|last2=Stalans|first2=Loretta J.|title=The myth of judicial leniency in sentencing|journal=Behavioral Sciences &amp; the Law|volume=7|issue=1|year=1989|pages=73–89|issn=0735-3936|doi=10.1002/bsl.2370070106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers in 1989 predicted that mock jurors would rate a witness to be '''more''' deceptive if the witness testified truthfully ''before'' lying than when the witness was caught lying first before telling the truth. If the availability heuristic played a role in this, lying second would remain in jurors' minds (since it was more recent) and they would most likely remember the witness lying over the truthfulness. To test the hypothesis, 312 university students played the roles of mock jurors and watched a videotape of a witness presenting testimony during a trial. Results confirmed the hypothesis, as mock jurors were most influenced by the most recent act.&lt;ref name="deTurckTexter1989"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=deTurck|first1=M. A.|last2=Texter|first2=L. A.|last3=Harszlak|first3=J. J.|title=Effects of Information Processing Objectives on Judgments of Deception Following Perjury|journal=Communication Research|volume=16|issue=3|year=1989|pages=434–452|issn=0093-6502|doi=10.1177/009365089016003006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perceived risk===
Previous studies have indicated that explaining a hypothetical event makes the event seem more likely through the creation of causal connections. However, such effects could arise through the use of the availability heuristic; that is, subjective likelihood is increased by an event becoming easier to imagine.&lt;ref name="Carroll1978"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carroll|first1=John S.|title=The effect of imagining an event on expectations for the event: An interpretation in terms of the availability heuristic|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=14|issue=1|year=1978|pages=88–96|issn=0022-1031|doi=10.1016/0022-1031(78)90062-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vividness effects===
Two studies with 108 undergraduates investigated vivid information and its impact on social judgment and the availability heuristic and its role in mediating vividness effects.

In study 1, Subjects listened to a tape recording that described a woman who lived with her 7-year-old son. Subjects then heard arguments about the woman's fitness as a parent and were asked to draw their own conclusions regarding her fitness or unfitness. Concrete and colorful language was found to influence judgments about the woman's fitness as a mother.

In study 2, a series of male and female names was presented to subjects; for each name, subjects were told the university affiliation of the individual (Yale or Stanford). When some names were presented, subjects were simultaneously shown a photograph that purportedly portrayed the named individual. Subsequently, to assess what subjects could remember (as a measure of availability), each name was re-presented, as well as the appropriate photograph if one had been originally presented. The study considered whether the display or non-display of photographs biased subjects' estimates as to the percentage of Yale (vs Stanford) students in the sample of men and women whose names appeared on the original list, and whether these estimated percentages were causally related to the respondents' memory for the college affiliations of the individual students on the list. The presence of photographs affected judgments about the proportion of male and female students at the two universities. Such effects have typically been attributed to the ready accessibility of vividly presented information in memory—that is, to the availability heuristic.

In both studies, vividness affected both availability (ability to recall) and judgments. However, causal modeling results indicated that the availability heuristic did not play a role in the judgment process.&lt;ref name="ShedlerManis1986"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shedler|first1=Jonathan|last2=Manis|first2=Melvin|title=Can the availability heuristic explain vividness effects?|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=51|issue=1|year=1986|pages=26–36|issn=1939-1315|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.51.1.26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judging frequency and probability===
In general, availability is correlated with ecological frequency, but it is also affected by other factors. Consequently, the reliance on the availability heuristic leads to systematic biases. Such biases are demonstrated in the judged frequency of classes of words, of combinatorial outcomes, and of repeated events. The phenomenon of illusory correlation is explained as an availability bias.&lt;ref name="tversky" /&gt;

In the original Tversky and Kahneman (1973) research, three major factors that are discussed are the [[frequency]] of repetition, frequency of co-occurrence, and [[illusory correlation]]. The use of frequency of repetition aids in the retrieval of relevant instances. The idea behind this phenomenon, is that the more an instance is repeated within a category or list, the stronger the link between the two instances becomes. Individuals then use the strong association between the instances to determine the frequency of an instance. Consequently, the association between the category or list and the specific instance, often influences frequency judgements. Frequency of co-occurrence strongly relates to Frequency of repetition, such that the more an item-pair is repeated, the stronger the association between the two items becomes, leading to a bias when estimating frequency of co-occurrence. Due to the phenomena of frequency of co-occurrence, [[Illusory correlations]] also often play a big role.&lt;ref name="tversky" /&gt;

Another factor that affects the availability heuristic in frequency and probability is exemplars. Exemplars are the typical examples that stand out during the process of recall. If asked what participants thought different set sizes were (how many men and how many women are in the class), participants would use exemplars to determine the size of each set.  Participants would derive their answer on ease of recall of the names that stood out. Participants read a list of names of members of a class for 30 seconds, and then participants were asked the male to female ratio of the class. The participant's answer would depend on the recall of exemplars. If the participant reading the list recalled seeing more common male names, such as Jack, but the only female names in the class were uncommon names, such as Deepika, then the participant will recall that there were more men than women. The opposite would be true if there were more common female names on the list and uncommon male names. Due to the availability heuristic, names that are more easily available are more likely to be recalled, and can thus alter judgments of probability.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Manis|first1=Melvin|last2=Jonides|first2=Jonathan|last3=Shedler|first3=John|last4=Nelson|first4=Thomas|title=Availability Heuristic in Judgments of Set Size and Frequency of Occurrence|journal=Journal of Personality &amp; Social Psychology|date=1993|volume=65|issue=3|pages=448–457|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.65.3.448}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of the availability heuristic and exemplars would be seeing a shark in the ocean. Seeing a shark has a greater impact on an individual's memory than seeing a dolphin.  If someone sees both sharks and dolphins in the ocean, they will be less aware of seeing the dolphins, because the dolphins had less of an impact on their memory. Due to the greater impact of seeing a shark, the availability heuristic can influence the probability judgement of the ratio of sharks and dolphins in the water. Thus, an individual who saw both a shark and a dolphin would assume a higher ratio of sharks in the water, even if there are more dolphins in reality.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Critiques==

=== Ease of recall as a critique ===
One of the earliest and most powerful critiques of the original Tversky and Kahneman&lt;ref name="TverskyKahneman1974"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tversky|first1=A.|last2=Kahneman|first2=D.|title=Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases|journal=Science|volume=185|issue=4157|year=1974|pages=1124–1131|issn=0036-8075|doi=10.1126/science.185.4157.1124|pmid=17835457|bibcode=1974Sci...185.1124T}}&lt;/ref&gt; study on the availability heuristic was the Schwarz et al.&lt;ref name="schwarz" /&gt; study which found that the ease of recall was a key component in determining whether a concept became available.  Many studies since this criticism of the original availability heuristic model have repeated this initial criticism, that the ease of recall factor became an integral facet of the availability heuristic itself (see Research section).

=== Alternative explanations ===
Much of the criticism against the availability heuristic has claimed that making use of the content that become available in our mind is not based on the ease of recall as suggested by Schwarz et al.&lt;ref name="schwarz" /&gt;  For example, it could be argued that recalling more words that begin with K than words with the third letter being K could arise from how we categorize and process words into our memory.  If we categorize words by first letter, and recall them through the same process, this would show more support for the representativeness heuristic than the availability heuristic.  Based on the possibility of explanations such as these, some researchers have claimed that the classic studies on the availability heuristic are too vague in that they fail to account for people's underlying mental processes.  Indeed, a study conducted by Wanke et al. demonstrated this scenario can occur in situations used to test the availability heuristic.&lt;ref name="wanke"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wänke|first1=Michaela|last2=Schwarz|first2=Norbert|last3=Bless|first3=Herbert|title=The availability heuristic revisited: Experienced ease of retrieval in mundane frequency estimates|journal=Acta Psychologica|volume=89|issue=1|year=1995|pages=83–90|issn=0001-6918|doi=10.1016/0001-6918(93)E0072-A}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Future studies should be conducted to determine if and when this alternative explanation will occur.

A second line of study has shown that frequency estimation may not be the only strategy we use when making frequency judgments.  A recent line of research has shown that our situational working memory can access long term memories, and this memory retrieval process includes the ability to determine more accurate probabilities.&lt;ref name="HulmeRoodenrys1995"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hulme|first1=Charles|last2=Roodenrys|first2=Steven|last3=Brown|first3=Gordon|last4=Mercer|first4=Robin|title=The role of long-term memory mechanisms in memory span|journal=British Journal of Psychology|volume=86|issue=4|year=1995|pages=527–536|issn=0007-1269|doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1995.tb02570.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This finding suggests that more research should be conducted to determine how much memory activation affects the availability heuristic.

'''Abdul Ghaffār Khān''' (6 February 1890 – 20 January 1988), nicknamed '''Fakhr-e-Afghān''', lit. "pride of Afghans"), '''Bādshāh Khān''', or '''Bāchā Khān''', "king of [[Khan (title)|chiefs]]"), was a [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] [[Indian independence movement|independence activist]] who worked to end the rule of the [[British Raj]].

After the partition, Bacha Khan pledged allegiance to [[Pakistan]], but was frequently arrested by the Pakistani government between 1948 and 1954. In 1956, he was again arrested for his opposition to the [[One Unit]] program, under which the government announced its plan to merge all provinces of [[West Pakistan]] into a single province. Khan was jailed or in exile during much of the 1960s and 1970s. Upon his death in 1988 in [[Peshawar]] under house arrest, following his will, he was buried at his house in [[Jalalabad, Afghanistan|Jalalabad]], [[Afghanistan]]. Tens of thousands of mourners attended his funeral, marching through the [[Khyber Pass]] from Peshawar to Jalalabad. It was marred by two bomb explosions that killed 15 people. Despite the heavy fighting at the time during the [[Soviet–Afghan War]], both sides, namely the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|communist army]] and the [[Islamic Unity of Afghanistan Mujahideen|mujahideen]], declared a ceasefire to allow Khan's burial.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;

== Early years ==
Bacha Khan was born on 6 February 1890 into a generally peaceful and prosperous [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] family from [[Utmanzai, Charsadda|Utmanzai]] in the Peshawar Valley of [[British Raj|British India]]. His father, Bahram Khan, was a land owner in the area commonly referred to as Hashtnaghar. Bacha Khan was the second son of Bahram to attend the British-run Edward's Mission School, the only fully functioning school in the region run by missionaries. At school the young Bacha Khan did well in his studies, and was inspired by his mentor Reverend Wigram to see the importance of education in service to the community. In his 10th and final year of high school, he was offered a highly prestigious commission in the [[Corps of Guides (India)|Corps of Guides]], a regiment of the [[British Indian Army]]. Bacha Khan refused the commission after realising that even Guides officers were still second-class citizens in their own country. He resumed his intention of university study, and Reverend Wigram offered him the opportunity to follow his brother, [[Khan Abdul Jabbar Khan]], to study in [[London]]. An alumnus of [[Aligarh Muslim University]], Bacha Khan eventually received the permission of his father. However, Bacha Khan's mother wasn't willing to let another son go to London, so Bacha Khan began working on his father's lands, attempting to discern what more he might do with his life.&lt;ref name="Karl"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/07/opinion/07MEYE.html The Peacemaker of the Pashtun Past] By KARL E. MEYER ''The New York Times''. 7 December 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910, at the age of 20, Khan opened a [[mosque school]] in his hometown of Utmanzai. In 1911, he joined independence movement of the Pashtun independence activist [[Haji Sahib of Turangzai]]. However, in 1915, the British authorities banned his mosque school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baachakhantrust.org/Chronology%20of%20Baacha%20Khan.pdf |title=Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan |publisher=Baacha Khan Trust |accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having witnessed the repeated failure of revolts against the British Raj, Khan decided that social activism and reform would be more beneficial for the Pashtuns. This led to the formation of ''Anjuman-e Islāh-e Afghānia'' ({{lang|ps|انجمن اصلاح افاغنه}}, "Afghan Reform Society") in 1921, and the youth movement ''Pax̌tūn Jirga'' ({{lang|ps|پښتون جرګه}}, "Pashtun [[Jirga|Assembly]]") in 1927. After Khan's return from the [[Hajj]] pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] in May 1928, he founded the [[Pashto language|Pashto]]-language monthly political journal ''Pax̌tūn'' ({{lang|ps|پښتون}}, "Pashtun"). Finally, in November 1929, Khan founded the ''[[Khudai Khidmatgar|Khudāyī Khidmatgār]]'' ({{lang|ps|خدايي خدمتګار}}, "Servants of God") movement, whose success triggered a harsh crackdown by the British authorities against him and his supporters. They suffered some of the most severe repression of the Indian independence movement from the British Raj.&lt;ref name="Zartman"&gt;{{cite book |last=Zartman |first=I. William |authorlink=I.

In response to his inability to continue his own education, Bacha Khan turned to helping others start theirs. Like many such regions of the world, the strategic importance of the newly formed North-West Frontier Province (now [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]], [[Pakistan]]) as a buffer for the [[British India|British Raj]] from Russian influence was of little benefit to its residents. The oppression of the British, the repression of the mullahs, and an ancient culture of violence and vendetta prompted Bacha Khan to want to serve and uplift his fellow men and women by means of education. At 20 years of age, Bacha Khan opened his first school in [[Utmanzai, Charsadda|Utmanzai]]. It was an instant success and he was soon invited into a larger circle of progressively minded reformers.

While he faced much opposition and personal difficulties, Bacha Khan Khan worked tirelessly to organise and raise the consciousness of his fellow Pushtuns. Between 1915 and 1918 he visited 500 villages in all part of the settled districts of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. It was in this frenzied activity that he had come to be known as ''Badshah (Bacha) Khan'' (King of Chiefs).&lt;ref name="Karl"/&gt;

Being a [[secular]] Muslim he did not believe in religious divisions. He married his first wife Meharqanda in 1912; she was a daughter of Yar Mohammad Khan of the Kinankhel clan of the Mohammadzai tribe of Razzar, a village adjacent to Utmanzai. They had a son in 1913, Abdul Ghani Khan, who would become a noted artist and poet. Subsequently, they had another son, Abdul Wali Khan (17 January 1917–), and daughter, Sardaro. Meharqanda died during the [[1918 flu pandemic|1918 influenza epidemic]]. In 1920, Bacha Khan remarried; his new wife, Nambata, was a cousin of his first wife and the daughter of Sultan Mohammad Khan of Razzar. She bore him a daughter, Mehar Taj (25 May 1921 – 29 April 2012),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epeshawar.com/peshawarnews/4049-daughter-of-bacha-khan-passes-away.html|title=Retrieved 20 May 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a son, Abdul Ali Khan (20 August 1922 – 19 February 1997). Tragically, in 1926 Nambata died early as well from a fall down the stairs of the apartment they were staying at in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khyber.org/people/literary/GhaniKhan.shtml Kyber Gateway] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823223758/http://www.khyber.org/people/literary/GhaniKhan.shtml |date=23 August 2007 }}, Retrieved 9 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Khudai Khidmatgar ==
[[Image:Nv-army-gray BG.jpg|thumb|Khudai Khidmatgar]]

In time, Bacha Khan's goal came to be the formulation of a united, independent, secular India. To achieve this end, he founded the ''[[Khudai Khidmatgar]]'' ("Servants of God"), commonly known as the "Red Shirts" (''Surkh Pōsh''), during the 1920s.

The ''Khudai Khidmatgar'' was founded on a belief in the power of Gandhi's notion of [[Satyagraha]], a form of active [[non-violence]] as captured in an [[Khudai Khidmatgar#The Oath of the Khudai Khidmatgar|oath]]. He told its members:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I am going to give you such a weapon that the police and the army will not be able to stand against it. It is the weapon of the Prophet, but you are not aware of it. That weapon is patience and righteousness. No power on earth can stand against it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forusa.org/fellowship/sept-oct-04/abu-nimer.html Nonviolence in the Islamic Context by Mohammed Abu Nimer 2004] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701052717/http://www.forusa.org/fellowship/sept-oct-04/abu-nimer.html |date=1 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The organisation recruited over 100,000 members and became legendary in opposing (and dying at the hands of) the British-controlled police and army. Through strikes, political organisation and non-violent opposition, the ''Khudai Khidmatgar'' were able to achieve some success and came to dominate the politics of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. His brother, Dr. [[Khan Abdul Jabbar Khan]] (known as Dr. Khan Sahib), led the political wing of the movement, and was the [[Chief Minister]] of the province (from 1937 and then until 1947 when his government was dismissed by [[Mohammad Ali Jinnah]] of the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]]).

=== Kissa Khwani massacre ===

{{main|Qissa Khwani bazaar massacre}}

On 23 April 1930, Bacha Khan was arrested during protests arising out of the [[Salt Satyagraha]]. A crowd of Khudai Khidmatgar gathered in Peshawar's [[Qissa Khwani bazaar massacre|Kissa Khwani (Storytellers) Bazaar]]. The British ordered troops to open fire with machine guns on the unarmed crowd, killing an estimated 200–250.&lt;ref&gt;Habib, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; The Khudai Khidmatgar members acted in accord with their training in non-violence under Bacha Khan, facing bullets as the troops fired on them.&lt;ref&gt;Johansen, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Two platoons of [[The Garhwal Rifles]] regiment under Chandra Singh Garhwali refused to fire on the non-violent crowd. They were later court-martialled with heavy punishment, including life imprisonment.

== Bacha Khan and the Indian National Congress ==
{{Main|Indian National Congress}}
[[Image:Badshah Khan.jpg|thumb|Bacha Khan with [[Mohandas Gandhi]].]]
Bacha Khan forged a close, spiritual, and uninhibited friendship with Gandhi, the pioneer of non-violent mass civil disobedience in India. The two had a deep admiration towards each other and worked together closely till 1947.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica-Abdul Ghaffar Khan"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/232353/Khan-Abdul-Ghaffar-Khan| title = Abdul Ghaffar Khan|publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate = 24 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" iloveindia.com -Abdul Ghaffar Khan"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.iloveindia.com/indian-heroes/abdul-ghaffar-khan.html| title = Abdul Ghaffar Khan|publisher = I Love India|accessdate = 24 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Khudai Khidmatgar'' (servants of god) agitated and worked cohesively with the [[Indian National Congress]], the leading national organisation fighting for independence, of which Bacha Khan was a senior and respected member. On several occasions when the Congress seemed to disagree with Gandhi on policy, Bacha Khan remained his staunchest ally. In 1931 the Congress offered him the presidency of the party, but he refused saying, "I am a simple soldier and Khudai Khidmatgar, and I only want to serve."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2000/20000305/spectrum/main2.htm#2|title=The Sunday Tribune - Spectrum - Article|website=www.tribuneindia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained a member of the Congress Working Committee for many years, resigning only in 1939 because of his differences with the Party's War Policy. He rejoined the Congress Party when the War Policy was revised.

Bacha Khan was a champion of women's rights {{dubious|date=June 2017}} and nonviolence. He became a hero in a society dominated by violence; notwithstanding his liberal views, his unswerving faith and obvious bravery led to immense respect. Throughout his life, he never lost faith in his non-violent methods or in the compatibility of [[Islam and nonviolence]]. He recognised as a [[jihad]] struggle with only the enemy holding swords. He was closely identified with Gandhi because of his non-violence principles and he is known in India as the 'Frontier Gandhi'.&lt;ref name=" iloveindia.com -Abdul Ghaffar Khan"/&gt; One of his Congress associates was [[Pandit Amir Chand Bombwal]] of Peshawar.

== The Partition ==
{{Main|Partition of India}}

[[File:Gandhi and Abdul Ghaffar Khan during prayer Cropped Brighter.jpg|thumb|Bacha Khan with Gandhi.]]
Khan strongly opposed the [[partition of India]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica-Abdul Ghaffar Khan"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" iloveindia.com -Abdul Ghaffar Khan"/&gt; Accused as being anti-Muslim by some politicians, Khan was physically assaulted in 1946, leading to his hospitalisation in Peshawar.&lt;ref&gt;Abdul Ghaffar Khan, 98, a Follower of Gandhi Published: 21 January 1988. New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt; On June 21, 1947, in [[Bannu]], a [[loya jirga]] was held consisting of Bacha Khan, the Khudai Khidmatgars, members of the Provincial Assembly, [[Mirzali Khan]] (Faqir of Ipi), and other tribal chiefs, just seven weeks before the partition. The loya jirga declared the [[Bannu Resolution]], which demanded that the Pashtuns be given a choice to have an independent state of [[Pashtunistan]] composing all Pashtun territories of British India, instead of being made to join either India or Pakistan. However, the [[British Raj]] refused to comply with the demand of this resolution.&lt;ref name="Ali Shah"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomas Howard"/&gt;

The congress party refused last-ditch compromises to prevent the partition, like the [[Cabinet Mission]] plan and Gandhi's suggestion to offer the position of Prime Minister to Jinnah. As a result, Bacha Khan and his followers felt a sense of betrayal by both Pakistan and India. Bacha Khan's last words to Gandhi and his erstwhile allies in the Congress party were: "You have thrown us to the wolves."&lt;ref name="icdc.com"/&gt;

When the referendum over accession to Pakistan was held, Bacha Khan, the Khudai Khidmatgars and the [[Indian National Congress Party]] boycotted the referendum. Some have argued that a segment of the population voted was barred from voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M9iwFmvKTwcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA107,M1 |title=The Dust of Empire: The Race For Mastery In The Asian Heartland – Karl E.

Bacha Khan took the oath of allegiance to the new nation of Pakistan on 23 February 1948 at the first session of the Pakistan Constituent Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baachakhantrust.org/AbdulGhaffarKhan.pdf |title=LOVE |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Abdul Ghafar Khan, Nehru, and Sardar Patel 1946.jpg|thumb|right|Bacha Khan walking with [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] after the Cabinet Mission, 1946.]]
He pledged full support to the government and attempted to reconcile with the founder of the new state Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Initial overtures led to a successful meeting in Karachi, however a follow-up meeting in the Khudai Khidmatgar headquarters never materialised, allegedly due to the role of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister, [[Abdul Qayyum Khan]] who warned Jinnah that Bacha Khan was plotting his assassination.&lt;ref name="Korejo"&gt;M.S.

Following this, Bacha Khan formed Pakistan's first National opposition party, on 8 May 1948, the Pakistan Azad Party. The party pledged to play the role of constructive opposition and would be non-communal in its philosophy.

However, suspicions of his allegiance persisted and under the new Pakistani government, Bacha Khan was placed under house arrest without charge from 1948 till 1954. Released from prison, he gave a speech again on the floor of the constituent assembly, this time condemning the massacre of his supporters at [[Babrra massacre|Babrra]].&lt;ref&gt;Syed Minhajul Hassan,(1998) Babra Firing Incident: 12 August 1948, Peshawar: University of Peshawar.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, Bacha Khan was named an "[[Amnesty International]] Prisoner of the Year". Amnesty's statement about him said, "His example symbolizes the suffering of upward of a million people all over the world who are [[prisoner of conscience|prisoners of conscience]]."

In September 1964, the Pakistani authorities allowed him to go to United Kingdom for treatment. During the winter, his doctor advised him to go to United States. He then went into exile to Afghanistan, he returned from exile in December 1972 to popular support, following the establishment of a National Awami Party provincial government in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|North West Frontier Province]] and [[Balochistan]].

He was arrested by Prime Minister [[Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto]]'s government at Multan in November 1973 and described Bhuttos government as "the worst kind of dictatorship".&lt;ref name="Wolpert"&gt;Wolpert, Stanley A. 1993.

His final major political challenge was against the [[Kalabagh dam]] project, fearing that the project would damage the Peshawar valley, his hostility to it would eventually lead to the project being shelved after his death.

Bacha Khan died in Peshawar under house arrest in 1988 and was buried in his house at [[Jalalabad, Afghanistan|Jalalabad]], Afghanistan. Over 200,000 mourners attended his funeral, including the Afghan president [[Mohammad Najibullah]]. This was a symbolic move by Bacha Khan, as this would allow his dream of Pashtun unification to live even after his death. Then Indian Prime Minister [[Rajiv Gandhi]] went to Peshawar, to pay his tributes to Bacha Khan despite the fact that General [[Zia ul-Haq]] attempted to stall his attendance citing security reasons. Additionally, the Indian government declared a five-day period of mourning in his honour.&lt;ref name="Abdul Ghaffar Khan 1988"/&gt;

Although he had been repeatedly imprisoned and persecuted, tens of thousands of mourners attended his funeral, described by one commentator as ''a caravan of peace, carrying a message of love'' from Pashtuns east of the Khyber to those on the west,&lt;ref name="Korejo"/&gt; marching through the historic [[Khyber Pass]] from Peshawar to Jalalabad. A cease-fire was announced in the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Afghan Civil War]] to allow the funeral to take place, even though it was marred by bomb explosions killing 15.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/23/world/15-killed-at-afghan-rites-for-pathan-leader.html January 23, 1988] edition of ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political legacy ==
[[File:Gandhi and Abdul Gaffa Khan.jpg|thumb|right]]
His eldest son [[Ghani Khan]] was a poet, his other son [[Khan Abdul Wali Khan]] is the founder and leader of the [[Awami National Party]] and was the Leader of the Opposition in the [[National Assembly of Pakistan|Pakistan National Assembly]].

His third son [[Khan Abdul Ali Khan]] was non-political and a distinguished educator, and served as Vice-Chancellor of [[University of Peshawar]]. Ali Khan was also the head of [[Aitchison College]], [[Lahore]] and Fazle Haq college, [[Mardan]].

[[Mohammed Yahya]] Education Minister of [[Khyber Pukhtunkhwa]], was the only son in law of Bacha Khan.

[[Asfandyar Wali Khan]] is the grandson of Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan, and leader of the Awami National Party. The party was in power from 2008 to 2013.

[[Salma Ataullahjan]] is the great grand niece of Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan and a member of the [[Senate of Canada]].

Bacha Khan's political legacy is renowned amongst Pashtuns and Hindus as a leader of a non-violent movement. Within Pakistan, however, the vast majority of society have questioned his stance with the All India Congress over the Muslim League as well as his opposition to Quaid-e-Azam. In particular, people have questioned where Bacha Khan's patriotism rests following his insistence that he be buried in Afghanistan after his death and not Pakistan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14919">In [[computer science]], a '''binary decision diagram''' ('''BDD''') or '''branching program''' is a [[data structure]] that is used to represent a [[Boolean function]]. On a more abstract level, BDDs can be considered as a [[data compression|compressed]] representation of [[set (mathematics)|sets]] or [[relation (mathematics)|relation]]s. Unlike other compressed representations, operations are performed directly on the compressed representation, i.e. without decompression. Other [[data structures]] used to represent a [[Boolean function]] include [[negation normal form]] (NNF), and [[propositional directed acyclic graph]] (PDAG).

== Definition ==

A Boolean function can be represented as a [[Rooted_graph|rooted]], directed, acyclic [[graph theory|graph]], which consists of several decision nodes and terminal nodes. There are two types of terminal nodes called 0-terminal and 1-terminal. Each decision node &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is labeled by  Boolean variable &lt;math&gt;V_N&lt;/math&gt; and has two [[child node]]s called low child and high child. The edge from node &lt;math&gt;V_N&lt;/math&gt; to a low (or high) child represents an assignment of &lt;math&gt;V_N&lt;/math&gt; to 0 (resp. 1).
Such a '''BDD''' is called 'ordered' if different variables appear in the same order on all paths from the root. A BDD is said to be 'reduced' if the following two rules have been applied to its graph:
* Merge any [[Graph isomorphism|isomorphic]] subgraphs.
* Eliminate any node whose two children are [[Graph isomorphism|isomorphic]].

In popular usage, the term '''BDD''' almost always refers to '''Reduced Ordered Binary Decision Diagram''' ('''ROBDD''' in the literature, used when the ordering and reduction aspects need to be emphasized). The advantage of an ROBDD is that it is canonical (unique) for a particular function and variable order.&lt;ref name="Bryant1986"&gt;Graph-Based Algorithms
for Boolean Function Manipulation, Randal E. Bryant, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; This property makes it useful in functional equivalence checking and other operations like functional technology mapping.

A path from the root node to the 1-terminal represents a (possibly partial) variable assignment for which the represented Boolean function is true. As the path descends to a low (or high) child from a node, then that node's variable is assigned to 0 (resp. 1).

=== Example ===
The left figure below shows a binary [[decision tree|decision ''tree'']] (the reduction rules are not applied), and a [[truth table]], each representing the function f (x1, x2, x3).  In the tree on the left, the value of the function can be determined for a given variable assignment by following a path down the graph to a terminal. In the figures below, dotted lines represent edges to a low child, while solid lines represent edges to a high child. Therefore, to find (x1=0, x2=1, x3=1), begin at x1, traverse down the dotted line to x2 (since x1 has an assignment to 0), then down two solid lines (since x2 and x3 each have an assignment to one).  This leads to the terminal 1, which is the value of f (x1=0, x2=1, x3=1).

The binary decision ''tree'' of the left figure can be transformed into a binary decision ''diagram'' by maximally reducing it according to the two reduction rules. The resulting '''BDD''' is shown in the right figure.

== History ==
The basic idea from which the data structure was created is the [[Shannon expansion]]. A [[switching function]] is split into two sub-functions (cofactors) by assigning one variable (cf. ''if-then-else normal form'').  If such a sub-function is considered as a sub-tree, it can be represented by a ''[[binary decision tree]]''. Binary decision diagrams (BDD) were introduced by Lee,&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;C. Y. Lee. "Representation of Switching Circuits by Binary-Decision Programs". Bell System Technical Journal, 38:985–999, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; and further studied and made known by Akers&lt;ref name="Akers"&gt;[[Sheldon B. Akers|Sheldon B.&lt;!-- Buckingham --&gt; Akers, Jr.]]. Binary Decision Diagrams, IEEE Transactions on Computers, C-27(6):509–516, June 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; and Boute.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond T. Boute, "The Binary Decision Machine as a programmable controller". [[EUROMICRO]] Newsletter, Vol. 1(2):16–22, January 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

The full potential for efficient algorithms based on the data structure was investigated by [[Randal Bryant]] at [[Carnegie Mellon University]]: his key extensions were to use a fixed variable ordering (for canonical representation) and shared sub-graphs (for compression).  Applying these two concepts results in an efficient data structure and algorithms for the representation of sets and relations.&lt;ref name="Bryant-1986"&gt;Randal E. Bryant. "[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bryant/pubdir/ieeetc86.ps Graph-Based Algorithms for Boolean Function Manipulation]". IEEE Transactions on Computers, C-35(8):677–691, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bryant-1992"&gt;Randal E. Bryant, "[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bryant/pubdir/acmcs92.ps Symbolic Boolean Manipulation with Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams"], ACM Computing Surveys, Vol. 24, No. 3 (September, 1992), pp. 293–318.
&lt;/ref&gt;  By extending the sharing to several BDDs, i.e. one sub-graph is used by several BDDs, the data structure ''Shared Reduced Ordered Binary Decision Diagram'' is defined.&lt;ref name="Brace"&gt;Karl S. Brace, Richard L. Rudell and Randal E. Bryant. "[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=123222&amp;coll=portal&amp;dl=ACM Efficient Implementation of a BDD Package"]. In Proceedings of the 27th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC 1990), pages 40–45. IEEE Computer Society Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;  The notion of a BDD is now generally used to refer to that particular data structure.

In his video lecture ''Fun With Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs)'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scpd.stanford.edu/knuth/index.jsp|title=Stanford Center for Professional Development|author=|date=|website=scpd.stanford.edu|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donald Knuth]] calls BDDs "one of the only really fundamental data structures that came out in the last twenty-five years" and mentions that Bryant's 1986 paper was for some time one of the most-cited papers in computer science.

[[Adnan Darwiche (computer scientist)|Adnan Darwiche]] and his collaborators have shown that BDDs are one of several normal forms for Boolean functions, each induced by a different combination of requirements. Another important normal form identified by Darwiche is [[Decomposable Negation Normal Form]] or DNNF.

== Applications ==

BDDs are extensively used in [[Computer Aided Design|CAD]] software to synthesize circuits ([[logic synthesis]]) and in [[formal verification]]. There are several lesser known applications of BDD, including [[fault tree]] analysis, [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] reasoning, product configuration, and [[private information retrieval]].&lt;ref name="Jensen"&gt;R. M. Jensen. [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~runej/data/papers/JSW04.pdf "CLab: A C+ + library for fast backtrack-free interactive product configuration"]. Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="Lipmaa"&gt;H. L. Lipmaa. [http://eprint.iacr.org/2009/395.pdf "First CPIR Protocol with Data-Dependent Computation"]. ICISC 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|reason=Please provide examples of these applications in the literature.|date=June 2010}}

Every arbitrary BDD (even if it is not reduced or ordered) can be directly implemented in hardware by replacing each node with a 2 to 1 [[Multiplexer#Digital multiplexers|multiplexer]]; each multiplexer can be directly implemented by a 4-LUT in a [[FPGA]]. It is not so simple to convert from an arbitrary network of logic gates to a BDD{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} (unlike the [[and-inverter graph]]).

== Variable ordering ==
The size of the BDD is determined both by the function being represented and the chosen ordering of the variables. There exist Boolean functions &lt;math&gt;f(x_1,\ldots, x_{n})&lt;/math&gt; for which depending upon the ordering of the variables we would end up getting a graph whose number of nodes would be linear (in&amp;nbsp;''n'') at the best and exponential at the worst case (e.g., a [[ripple carry adder]]).  Let us consider the Boolean function &lt;math&gt;f(x_1,\ldots, x_{2n}) = x_1x_2 + x_3x_4 + \cdots + x_{2n-1}x_{2n}.&lt;/math&gt;
Using the variable ordering &lt;math&gt;x_1 &lt; x_3 &lt; \cdots &lt; x_{2n-1} &lt; x_2 &lt; x_4 &lt; \cdots &lt; x_{2n}&lt;/math&gt;, the BDD needs 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt; nodes to represent the function.  Using the ordering &lt;math&gt;x_1 &lt; x_2 &lt; x_3 &lt; x_4 &lt; \cdots &lt; x_{2n-1} &lt; x_{2n}&lt;/math&gt;, the BDD consists of 2''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2 nodes.

| [[File:BDD Variable Ordering Good.svg|thumb|156px|Good variable ordering]]
|}

It is of crucial importance to care about variable ordering when applying this data structure in practice.
The problem of finding the best variable ordering is [[NP-hard]].&lt;ref name="Bollig"&gt;Beate Bollig, Ingo Wegener. {{doi-inline|10.1109/12.537122|Improving the Variable Ordering of OBDDs Is NP-Complete}}, IEEE Transactions on Computers, 45(9):993–1002, September 1996.
&lt;/ref&gt; For any constant ''c''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1 it is even NP-hard to compute a variable ordering resulting in an OBDD with a size that is at most c times larger than an optimal one.&lt;ref name="Sieling"&gt;Detlef Sieling. "The nonapproximability of OBDD minimization." Information and Computation 172, 103–138. 2002.
&lt;/ref&gt; However, there exist efficient heuristics to tackle the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rice|first=Michael|title=A Survey of Static Variable Ordering Heuristics for Efficient BDD/MDD Construction|url=http://alumni.cs.ucr.edu/~skulhari/StaticHeuristics.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are functions for which the graph size is always exponential — independent of variable ordering. This holds e.g. for the multiplication function.&lt;ref name="Bryant1986"/&gt; In fact, the function computing the middle bit of the product of two &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-bit numbers does not have an OBDD smaller than &lt;math&gt;2^{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor} / 61 - 4&lt;/math&gt; vertices.&lt;ref&gt;Philipp Woelfel. "[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002200000500067X Bounds on the OBDD-size of integer multiplication via universal hashing]." ''Journal of Computer and System Sciences'' 71, pp. 520-534, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; (If the multiplication function had polynomial-size OBDDs, it would show that [[integer factorization]] is in [[P/poly]], which is not known to be true.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard J. Lipton]]. [https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2009/06/16/bdds-and-factoring/ "BDD's and Factoring"]. ''Gödel's Lost Letter and P=NP'', 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;)

Researchers have suggested refinements on the BDD data structure giving way to a number of related graphs, such as BMD ([[binary moment diagram]]s), ZDD ([[zero-suppressed decision diagram]]), FDD ([[free binary decision diagram]]s), PDD ([[parity decision diagram]]s), and MTBDDs (multiple terminal BDDs).

== Logical operations on BDDs ==
Many logical operations on BDDs can be implemented by polynomial-time graph manipulation algorithms:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=H. R. |last=Andersen |url= http://www.cmi.ac.in/~madhavan/courses/verification-2011/andersen-bdd.pdf |title=An Introduction to Binary Decision Diagrams |work=Lecture Notes |year=1999 |publisher=IT University of Copenhagen}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|20}}
* [[logical conjunction|conjunction]]
* [[logical disjunction|disjunction]]
* [[negation]]
* existential abstraction{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}
* universal abstraction{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

However, repeating these operations several times, for example forming the conjunction or disjunction of a set of BDDs, may in the worst case result in an exponentially big BDD. This is because any of the preceding operations for two BDDs may result in a BDD with a size proportional to the product of the BDDs' sizes, and consequently for several BDDs the size may be exponential. Also, since constructing the BDD of a Boolean function solves the NP-complete [[Boolean satisfiability problem]] and the co-NP-complete [[Tautology (logic)|tautology problem]], constructing the BDD can take exponential time in the size of the Boolean formula even when the resulting BDD is small.

A '''civil penalty''' or '''civil fine''' is a financial penalty imposed by a [[government agency]] as restitution for wrongdoing.  The wrongdoing is typically defined by a [[Codification (law)|codification]] of [[legislation]], [[regulation]]s, and [[decree]]s. The civil fine is not considered to be a [[Crime|criminal]] [[punishment]], because it is primarily sought in order to compensate the state for harm done to it, rather than to punish the wrongful conduct. As such, a civil penalty, in itself, will not carry jail time or other legal penalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rbs2.com/cc.htm|title=Differences between Civil and Criminal Law in the USA|date=1998|author=Ronald B. Standler|accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=July 2014}} For example, if a person were to dump toxic waste in a state park, the state would have the same right to seek to recover the cost of cleaning up the mess as would a private landowner, and to bring the complaint to a [[court]] of law, if necessary.

Civil penalties occupy a strange place in some legal systems - because they are not criminal penalties, the state need not meet a [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] that is "[[balance of probabilities]]"; but because the action is brought by the government, and some civil penalties can run into the millions of dollars, it would be uncomfortable to subject citizens to them by a burden of proof that is merely a "[[preponderance of the evidence]]." Therefore, the assessment of most civil penalties requires a finding of "[[clear and convincing evidence]]" before a civil defendant will be held liable. A defendant may well raise [[excuse|excuses, justifications]], [[affirmative defense]]s,  and [[procedural defense]]s. An [[administrative law judge]] or [[hearing officer]] may oversee the proceedings and render a [[Legal judgment|judgment]]. Judgment is made on the balance of probabilities, meaning if it is more than fifty percent likely that the accused is responsible then the accused shall be found guilty.

In some cases, a civil penalty may be supplemented by other legal process, including administrative sanctions or even criminal charges, and their respective [[appeal]]s. For example, failure to pay a fine assessed for a [[traffic code]] violation may result in administrative suspension of a [[driver's license]], and further driving after suspension may be a criminal offense. On the other hand, a minimal case may be "put on file", or otherwise suspended for a period during which the defendant may be required to avoid further violations, or carry out specific duties (such as making repairs or restitution, or attending supplemental education), after which the matter is dismissed.

In other cases, such as [[public safety]] and [[consumer protection]] violations, the local authorities may revoke permits and licenses, and seek [[injunction]] to stop or remove non-conforming works or goods, in addition to the civil penalty.

Pending or admitted civil violations may also be used as [[evidence]] of [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]] in a [[lawsuit|civil suit]]. One example is [[speed limit|speeding]] causing in a [[car accident]], resulting in a [[wrongful death claim]].  However, the plaintiff may be required to prove [[causation (law)|causation]] through a harm encompassed in the regulations.

== Civil Penalties in England ==
The concept of civil penalties in English is in a state of flux.  In contract, damages is a remedy to provide monetary compensation for loss; and damages may be unliquidated (general damages), or liquidated (pre-determined).  In the absence of an out-of court settlement, unliquidated damages must be ascertained by a court or tribunal, whereas liquidated damages will be determined by reference to the contract or to a mutually agreed arbitrator.  The purpose of liquidated damages is to provide certainty and to avoid both the bother and cost of legal proceedings. 

It is well established that liquidated  damages for breach of contract are void if they seek to punish rather than to compensate for loss.  For a contractual "penalty" clause to be valid,  one must show that it was drawn up after a bona fide attempt to estimate loss in advance of the breach.   For example, a motorway construction contract may have an estimated finish date with a "penalty clause" for every day late; but provided that this date is realistic and the "penalty" is a reasonable approximation of loss, the clause will be valid. The validity of the clause will be advanced if there is an equivalent bonus for finishing early.

Difficulties can arise with fines for wrongful parking (parking in the wrong area, or overstaying).  There are three scenarios: (i) parking on public streets; &amp; parking in a private car park either (ii) with permission, or (iii) without permission.  If a parking fine is imposed for type (i), since the powers exercised by the local authority have been delegated by Parliament, there is little that one can do, except to seek judicial review and allege disproportionality.  If it is type (ii), such as in a supermarket car-park, then contract rules apply.  If, say, the cost was £1 for an hour, and you got a £60 ticket for overstaying a further hour, you can legally send them an extra £1, plus (say) £5 as a contribution to their administration expenses.  If they are not satisfied, they would have to issue a county court summons, which might not be cost effective.

In type (iii) where one has parked on private land without permission, a typical notice might read: "In parking on this land, you hereby accept that your vehicle will be clamped and a £100 release charged".  Although this may seem a simple matter of [[trespass]] with an unavoidable fine, it may amount to a case of implied contract (i.e. "if you park here, you agree to pay a penalty"); and such a "penalty" (read "damages") must be proportionate or else the fine will be void.  Also, since the penalty notice could have been attached to the windscreen, the clamping of the vehicle may itself be unlawful trespass. It should be noted that since the introduction of the [[Protection of Freedoms Act 2012]] (also known as POFA), that wheel clamping is illegal unless by an Authority (e.g. Police, Local Authority or DVLA).

A '''conceptual framework''' is an analytical tool with several variations and contexts. It can be applied in different categories of work where an overall picture is needed. It is used to make conceptual distinctions and organize ideas. Strong conceptual frameworks capture something real and do this in a way that is easy to remember and apply.

[[Isaiah Berlin]] used the metaphor of [[The Hedgehog and the Fox|a "fox" and a "hedgehog"]] to make conceptual distinctions in how important philosophers and authors view the world.&lt;ref name="Berlin1953"&gt;{{citation |last=Berlin |first=Isaiah |author-link=Isaiah Berlin |year=1953 |title=The Hedgehog and the Fox: An Essay on Tolstoy's View of History}} [[London]]: [[Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson]]; 1986 [[New York City|New York]]: [[Simon and Schuster]], introduction by M. Walzer.&lt;/ref&gt; Berlin describes hedgehogs as those who use a single idea or organizing principle to view the world (such as [[Dante Alighieri]], [[Blaise Pascal]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], [[Plato]], [[Henrik Ibsen]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]). Foxes, on the other hand, incorporate a type of pluralism and view the world through multiple, sometimes conflicting, lenses (examples include [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], [[James Joyce]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[Aristotle]], [[Herodotus]], [[Molière]], and [[Honoré de Balzac]]).

Economists use the conceptual framework of "[[Supply (economics)|supply]]" and "[[Demand (economics)|demand]]" to distinguish between the behavior and incentive systems of firms and consumers.&lt;ref name="Colander2013"&gt;[[David Colander|Colander, David]]. 2013. ''Microeconomics,'' 9th edition, [[New York City|New York]]: [[McGraw-Hill Education|McGraw Hill]] and Frank, Robert and [[Ben Bernanke]]. 2013. ''Principles of Microeconomics,'' 5th edition. New York: McGraw Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; Like many conceptual frameworks, supply and demand can be presented through visual or graphical representations (see [[demand curve]]). Both [[political Science]] and [[economics]] use [[Principal-agent problem|principal agent theory]] as a conceptual framework. The [[politics-administration dichotomy]] is a long standing conceptual framework used in [[public administration]].&lt;ref name="Overeem2012"&gt;{{citation |last=Overeem |first=P. |year=2012 |title=The Politics Administration Dichotomy: Toward a Constitutional Perspective |edition=2 |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |isbn=978-1-4665-5899-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; All three of these cases are examples of a macro level conceptual framework.

== Overview ==
The use of the term ''conceptual framework'' crosses both scale (large and small theories)&lt;ref name="RavitchRiggan2012"&gt;{{citation |author1=Ravitch |author2=Riggan |year=2012 |title=Reason and Rigor: How Conceptual Frameworks guide Research |location=[[Thousand Oaks, California|Thousand Oaks CA]] |publisher=[[SAGE Publishing|Sage]] |page=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maxwell2009"&gt;{{citation |last=Maxwell |first=J. |year=2009 |chapter=Designing a qualitative study |title=The State Handbook of Applied Social Science Research |editor-last1=Bickmam |editor-first1=L. |editor-last2=Rog |editor-first2=D. |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |publisher=[[SAGE Publishing|Sage]] |page=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contexts (social science,&lt;ref name="Rodman1980"&gt;{{citation |last=Rodman |first=Hyman |title=Are Conceptual Frameworks Necessary for Theory Building?

S. |year=1993 |title=Control Combinations in Marketing: Conceptual Framework and Empirical Evidence |work=[[Journal of Marketing]] |volume=57 |issue=1 |pages=57–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; applied science,&lt;ref name="HobbsNorton2006"&gt;{{citation |last1=Hobbs |first1=R. |last2=Norton |first2=D. |year=2006 |title=Towards a Conceptual Framework for Restoration Ecology |work=Restoration Ecology |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=93–110}}&lt;/ref&gt; art&lt;ref name="Eco1978"&gt;{{citation |last=Eco |first=Umberto |author-link=Umberto Eco |year=1978 |title=A Theory of Semiotics |publisher=[[Indiana University Press]] |page=310 |isbn=978-0-2532-0217-8}} endnote #47&lt;/ref&gt; etc.). Its explicit definition and application can therefore vary.

Conceptual frameworks are particularly useful as organizing devices in empirical research. One set of scholars has applied the notion of conceptual framework to [[deductive]], empirical research at the micro- or individual study level.&lt;ref name=Shields&gt;{{citation |last1=Shields |first=Patricia M. |author-link=Patricia M. Shields |last2=Tajalli |first2=Hassan |title=Intermediate Theory: The Missing Link in Successful Student Scholarship |work=Journal of Public Affairs Education |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=313–334 |url=https://digital.library.txstate.edu/handle/10877/3967 |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baum2003"&gt;{{citation |last=Baum |first=K. |year=2003 |chapter=Assessing Group Conflict: Understanding the Line-Staff Relationship in Fire Service |title=Handbook of Conflict Management |editor-first1=W. |editor-last1=Pammer |editor-first2=J. |editor-last2=Killian |location=New York |publisher=[[Marcel Dekker]] |pages=129–135}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ShieldsRangarajan2013"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shields |first1=Patricia |author1-link=Patricia M.

Likewise, conceptual frameworks are abstract representations, connected to the research project's goal that direct the collection and analysis of data (on the plane of observation – the ground). Critically, a football play is a "plan of action" tied to a particular, timely, purpose, usually summarized as long or short yardage.&lt;ref name="Patricia2014"&gt;{{citation |last=Shields |first=Patricia |author-link=Patricia M. Shields |year=2014 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263861162_Tools_for_Writing_Excellent_Papers_2014_ASPA_Student_Summit |title=Tools for Excellent Papers: 2014 ASPA Student Summit |publisher=[[Texas State University]] |location=[[Washington D.C.]]}} Presentation at the [[American Society for Public Administration]] annual conference, Washington DC March 15, This powerpoint depicts the connection between football and conceptual frameworks in the context of a large graduate student paper. The national presentation was delivered before Public Administration graduate students in Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt; Shields and Rangarajan (2013) argue that it is this tie to "purpose" that make [[American football plays]] such a good metaphor. They define a conceptual framework as "the way ideas are organized to achieve a research project's purpose".&lt;ref name="ShieldsRangarajan2013"/&gt; Like football plays, conceptual frameworks are connected to a research purpose or aim. [[Explanation]]&lt;ref name="Babbie2007"&gt;{{citation |last=Babbie |first=Earl |year=2007 |title=The Practice of Social Research |edition=11th |location=[[Belmont, California|Belmont, CA]] |page=89 |publisher=[[Thompson Media Group|Thompson]], [[Cengage|Wadsworth]]}} Babbie also identifies exploration and description as purposes of empirical research&lt;/ref&gt; is the most common type of research purpose employed in empirical research. The formal [[hypothesis]] of a scientific investigation is the framework associated with [[explanation]]&lt;!-- this is not a complete sentence. --&gt;.&lt;ref name="Brains_al2011"&gt;{{citation |last1=Brains |first1=C. |last2=Willnat |first2=L. |last3=Manheim |first3=J. |last4=Rich |first4=R. |year=2011 |title=Empirical Political Analysis: Quantitative and Qualitative Research Methods |location=[[New York City|New York, NY]] |publisher=[[Longman]] |pages=75–77}} Brains et al 2011 also identify exploration, explanation and description as research purposes. Explanation is connected to hypotheses testing (as a framework). The other research purposes are not connected to a framework.&lt;/ref&gt;

Explanatory research usually focuses on "why" or "what caused" a phenomenon to occur. Formal hypotheses posit possible explanations (answers to the why question) that are tested by collecting data and assessing the evidence (usually quantitative using statistical tests). For example, Kai Huang wanted to determine what factors contributed to residential fires in U.S. cities. Three factors were posited to influence residential fires. These factors (environment, population and building characteristics) became the hypotheses or conceptual framework he used to achieve his purpose – explain factors that influenced home fires in [[United States|U.S.]] cities.&lt;ref name="Huang2009"&gt;{{citation |last=Huang |first=Kai |title=Population and Building Factors that impact residential fire rates in large U.S. Cities |publisher=Applied Research Projects, [[Texas State University]] |page=42 |url=https://digital.library.txstate.edu/handle/10877/3592 |year=2009}} The formal hypotheses took the form of relational statements. H1: environmental factors influence residential fire rates; H2: populations characteristics influence residential fire rates; H3: Building factors influence residential fire rates. These hypotheses could be represented visually as H1: A → RFR; H2: B → RFR; H3: C → RFR where A = environmental factors; B = population characteristics; C = Building Factors and RFR = Residential Fire Rates.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
Several types of conceptual frameworks have been identified,&lt;ref name="ShieldsRangarajan2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shields1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ShieldsTravis2017"&gt;{{citation |last1=Shields |first1=Patricia |author1-link=Patricia M. Shields |last2=Whetsell |first2=Travis |year=2017 |chapter=Public Administration Methodology: A Pragmatic Perspective |editor-last1=Raadshelders |editor-first1=Jos |editor-last2=Stillman |editor-first2=Richard |title=Foundations of Public Administration |pages=75–92 |publisher=Melvin and Leigh |isbn=978-0-9973-0842-6 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311511761_Public_Administration_Methodology_A_Pragmatic_Perspective}}&lt;/ref&gt; and line up with a research purpose in the following ways:
* [[Working hypothesis]] – [[Exploration]] or [[Exploratory research]]
* Pillar Questions - [[Exploration]] or [[Exploratory research]]
* Descriptive categories – [[Description]] or [[Descriptive research]]
* Practical ideal type – [[Analysis]] (Gauging)
* Models of [[operations research]] – [[Decision making]]
* Formal hypothesis – [[Explanation]]  and [[Prediction]]

Note that Shields and Rangarajan (2013) do not claim that the above are the only framework-purpose pairing. Nor do they claim the system is applicable to [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]] forms of empirical research. Rather, the conceptual framework-research purpose pairings they propose are useful and provide new scholars a point of departure to develop their own [[research design]].&lt;ref name="ShieldsRangarajan2013"/&gt;

Frameworks have also been used to explain [[conflict theory]] and the balance necessary to reach what amounts to resolution. Within these conflict frameworks, visible and invisible variables function under concepts of relevance. Boundaries form and within these boundaries, tensions regarding laws and chaos (or freedom) are mitigated. These frameworks often function like cells, with sub-frameworks, stasis, evolution and revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Moorstein |first1=Mark |title=Frameworks, Conflict in Balance |publisher=[[iUniverse]] |isbn=978-0-5953-1824-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anomalistics|Anomalies]] may exist without adequate "lenses" or "filters" to see them and may become visible only when the tools exist to define them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Kuhn]]. (1996) ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Encyclopedia of World Problems and Human Potential''''' is published by the [[Union of International Associations]] (UIA). It is available online since 2000,&lt;ref&gt;[http://uia.org/encyclopedia?qt-encyclopedia=1#qt-encyclopedia UIA Online Encyclopedia]. Union of International Associations.&lt;/ref&gt; and was previously available as a CD-ROM and as a three-volume book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uia.org/encyclopedia?qt-encyclopedia=2#qt-encyclopedia Hardcover edition of the Encyclopedia of World Problems and Human Potential]. Union of International Associations.&lt;/ref&gt; The online Encyclopedia is currently in a redevelopment phase.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uia.org/projects/encyclopedia UIA Encyclopedia redevelopment]. Union of International Associations.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Encyclopedia'' was started in 1972 and now comprises more than 100,000 entries and 700,000 links, as well as 500 pages of introductory notes and commentaries. The Encyclopedia collects information on [[problem]]s, [[strategy|strategies]], [[value (ethics)|values]], concepts of [[personal development|human development]], and various intellectual resources.

== Notes and commentaries within the ''Encyclopedia'' projects ==
The ''Encyclopedia of World Problems and Human Potential'' contains nearly 500 pages&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/319419 Expanding Resources on International Organizations], a review by Chadwick F. Alger, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; of introductory notes and commentaries. Some of them just provide readers with usual information about the work content and its organization. Most of them, however, represent extensive reports on the exploratory work done by the editors in eight projects (also called research areas, or sections). Here are those projects, with illustrative examples of key ideas figuring in the notes and commentaries.

=== Encyclopedia of world problems and human potential project ===
A first objective of the editors in that project&lt;ref name=encycintro&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/164014 Encyclopedia of world problems and human potential project]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; is to collect and present information on the following topics: the problems with which humanity perceives itself to be faced; the organizational, human, and intellectual resources it believes it has at its disposal; the values by which it is believed any change should be guided; the concepts of human development considered to be either the means or the end of any such social transformation. A second objective is to clarify the conceptual challenge of interrelating such plentiful and disparate or even contradictory information. A third objective is to enable alternation between viewpoints from different cultures, ideologies, beliefs and even "facts", as a way for individuals and societies to become empowered with an appropriate response to the problematic conditions of the moment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/163?kap=5 Encyclopedia of world problems and human potential project – Overview: significance]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/163?kap=4 Encyclopedia of world problems and human potential project – Overview: objectives]. Union of International Associations.

Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the disagreement amongst the advocates of different approaches to problems or solutions which hinders the formation of any consensual strategy and the mobilization of adequate resources. That is why the ''Encyclopedia'' uses an approach that is as general and minimally structured as is feasible without losing coherence and utility. The intent is first to contribute to clarify the nature, extent, and interrelationships of problems and solutions. Even the distinction between problems and solutions is not always clear. For instance, housing an increasing number of people is a solution that may aggravate the problem of urban overcrowding, and the death of individuals is a problem that contributes to the solution of reducing ecological impact of overpopulation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/165?kap=2 World problems project – Significance: constraints on a problem-focused approach]. Uia.be (21 May 1973). Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/165?kap=23 World problems project – Comments: general]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Encyclopedia'' databases are much about how problems, strategies, values, development concepts, and organizations are linked together. As a result, the possibility of focusing on [[feedback|feedback loops]] has proven to be an important feature of the ''Encyclopedia'', and a program has been carried out to identify "''vicious problem loops''". A vicious problem loop is a chain of problems, each aggravating the next, and with the last looping back to aggravate the first in the chain.  Here is an example: Man-made disasters, Vulnerability of ecosystem niches, Natural environment degradation, Shortage of natural resources, Unbridled competition for scarce resources, Man-made disasters. Solutions that focus on only one problem in a chain may fail or even be harmful, because the cycle has the capacity to regenerate itself, and also because several cycles may interlock, forming tangled skeins of interlinked global problems. The loop detection program detected more than 50,000 loops (of up to 9 elements) in more than 12,000 problem profiles. It is thought that a similar work could be done about mutually facilitating or constraining strategy loops, so as to constitute a dynamic response to aggravating or reducing loops of problems through a circle of matching strategies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/159?kap=19 Global strategies project – Strategic ecosystem: feedback loops and dependent co-arising].

=== World problems and global issues ===
That project&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/285958 World problems project]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; endeavors to present all the phenomena in society that are perceived negatively by groups transcending national frontiers. Those phenomena constitute a challenge to creative remedial action. Groups are strongly motivated by the [[problem]]s that infringe their values and arouse their indignation. As such, problems are a major stimulus driving the development of society. Although there is agreement that problems are numerous and that many are really serious, little effort has been made to determine how many problems there are. Likewise, while it is becoming increasingly evident that problems interact with one another, and constitute complex networks or systems, little effort has been made to map that [[complexity]]. The perceptions documented in that project raise useful questions concerning the nature and existence of problems, especially when other groups consider that one perception or another is irrelevant, misleading or misinformed. An aim of that research area, then, is to assemble information whose significance is collectively repressed, displaced onto some less threatening problems, or projected in the form of blame onto some other social group.&lt;ref name=sections&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/163?kap=11 Encyclopedia of world problems and human potential project – Content: sections and sub-sections].

Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Views concerning problems are extremely varied. Several pages in the notes and commentaries deal with that variety. Problems are agenda items for assemblies or conferences; action targets for organizations; issues for political parties or governments; events or topics for the media; markets for businesses; sins for religions; puzzles for sciences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/165?kap=8 World problems project – Criteria: problem disguises and problem evasion]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Problems can be viewed as synonymous with chaos and disorder, or as elements in an ordered array; as static or dynamic entities; as discrete or continuous phenomena; as objective things or subjective experiences; as directly experienceable phenomena or as indirect implications of seemingly innocent phenomena; as inherently comprehensible or incomprehensible entities; as the results of due processes or as spontaneous phenomena. For many people in the West problems may be considered as artifacts of concerned minds, about which reason, principles, or history are relevant, while in the East to conceive of life as presenting problems to be solved may be seen as a misconception of life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/165?kap=7 World problems project – Criteria: assumptions]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Other pages of notes and commentaries deal extensively with the variety of points of view under headings such as ''Approaches to problems'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/165?kap=24 World problems project – Comments: approaches to problems]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Beyond the problem-lobby mindset'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/165?kap=25 World problems project – Comments: beyond the problem-lobby mindset].

=== Global strategies and solutions ===
That project&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/190 Global strategies project]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; aims at identifying the complete range of [[strategy|strategies]] perceived by constituencies acting at the international level.

The conventional way of addressing any problem situation is to elaborate a strategy, but given the number, variety and interrelationships of the problems, it is uncertain whether any conventional strategy could be adequate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/304593 Global strategies project – Rationale]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, many groups have "answers" to the current crisis. The proponents of each such answer naturally attach special importance to their own as being of crucial relevance at this time, or even as being the only appropriate basis for a viable world society in the future. However, that focus on "answer production", a vital moving force in society, obscures the manner in which such answers, in the absence of integration between them, undermine each other’s significance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/165?kap=1 World problems project – Significance: acknowledgement of the universe of problems]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

It appears to the editors that the elements of the strategic challenge at this time include:
*a vast and changing network of perceived problems, on which no single body has (or possibly could have) adequate control;
*a vast and changing network of conceptual tools and knowledge resources, which is not (and possibly could not be) controlled by any single body;
*a vast and changing [[social network|network]] of agencies, organizations, groups and active individuals spanning every conceivable human interest and extending from the community level to the international level, and on which no single body has (or possibly could or should have) adequate control.
The strategic problem therefore is how to ensure that the appropriate organizational resources emerge, and are supported with appropriate conceptual tools, in response to emerging problem complexes. But it would seem that this must be achieved without organizing such response – for to the extent that any part of the network is organized, other parts will develop (and probably should develop) which favor alternative approaches. The challenge is therefore to clarify the conditions of a network strategy, i.e. an approach which facilitates or catalyses (rather than organizes) the development of organizational networks in response to problem networks, in the light of values perceived in various parts of the social system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/159?kap=20 Global strategies project – Strategic ecosystem: network strategy]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29638">The '''endurance running hypothesis''' is the [[hypothesis]] that the evolution of certain human characteristics can be explained as adaptations to long distance running.&lt;ref name="Carrier" /&gt;&lt;ref name="number8"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bramble|first=Dennis|author2=Lieberman, Daniel|title=Endurance running and the evolution of Homo|journal=Nature|date=November 2004|volume=432|doi=10.1038/nature03052|pmid=15549097|pages=345–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis suggests that endurance running played an important role for early [[hominins]] in obtaining food. Researchers have proposed that endurance running began as an adaptation for scavenging and later for [[persistence hunting]].

==Anatomical and physiological adaptations==

===Running vs. walking===
Much research has been geared towards the mechanics of how [[bipedal]] walking has evolved in the genus ''[[Homo]]''. However, little research has been conducted to examine how the specific adaptations for running emerged, and how they influenced human evolution.

The bit of research that has focused on human running provides much evidence for bodily function and structures that improve running only, and are not used in walking. This suggests that running was an adaptation, not that it came about as a byproduct of walking.

Running and walking incorporated different biomechanisms. Walking requires an "inverted pendulum" where the body's center of mass is shifted over the extended leg, to exchange potential and kinetic energy with each step.&lt;ref name="number8"/&gt; Running involves a "mass spring" mechanism to exchange potential and kinetic energy, with the use of tendons and ligaments. Tendons and ligaments are elastic tissues that store energy. They are stretched and then release energy as they recoil. This mass spring mechanism becomes less energetically costly at faster speeds and is therefore more efficient than the inverted pendulum of walking mechanics when traveling at greater speeds.&lt;ref name=number8 /&gt; Tendons and ligaments, however, do not provide these benefits in walking.

Although the mass spring mechanism can be more energetically favorable at higher speeds, it also results in an increase in ground reaction forces&lt;ref name=number8 /&gt; and is less stable because there is more movement and pitching of the limbs and core of the body. Ground forces and body pitching movement is less of an issue in the walking gait, where the position of the body's center of mass varies less, making walking an inherently more stable gait. In response to the destabilization of the running gait, the human body appears to have evolved adaptations to increase stabilization, as well as for the mass-spring mechanism in general. These adaptations, described below, are all evidence for selection for endurance running.

===Skeletal evidence===
Many researchers compare the skeletal structures of early hominins such as ''[[Australopithecus]]'' to those of ''Homo'' in order to identify structural differences that may be significant to endurance running.

'''[[Nuchal ligament]]:''' Because the head is decoupled from the shoulders, early ''Homo'' needed a way to stabilize the head. The nuchal ligament is an important evolved feature in head stabilization. It starts at the midline of the [[occiput]] and connects to the upper [[trapezius]]. This ligament is also important in terms of archaeological findings, because it leaves a small indentation and ridge in the skull, allowing researchers to see if various species had a nuchal ligament. The ability to see traces of ligaments in archaeological findings is rare because they degrade quickly and often leave no trace. In the case of the nuchal ligament, a trace of its existence is left with the presence of the skull ridge. Because neither ''[[Australopithecus]]'' nor ''[[Pan (genus)|Pan]]'' had the skull ridge, it has been concluded that this feature is unique to ''Homo''. &lt;ref name="Lieberman"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lieberman|first=Daniel|author2=Bramble, Dennis |author3=Raichlen, David |author4= Shea, John |title=Brains, Brawn, and the Evolution of Human Endurance Running Capabilities|journal=Contributions from the Third Stony Brook Human Evolution Symposium and Workshop|date=October 2006|pages=77–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because the nuchal ligament is only activated while running, the amount of running can be inferred from the muscle markings. In the case of Homo Erectus and Neanderthals, very strong nuchal ligament markings are present, but are less marked in modern humans, indicating a decrease in running behavior &lt;ref name="Lieberman"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lieberman|first=Daniel|author2=Bramble, Dennis |author3=Raichlen, David |author4= Shea, John |title=Brains, Brawn, and the Evolution of Human Endurance Running Capabilities|journal=Contributions from the Third Stony Brook Human Evolution Symposium and Workshop|date=October 2006|pages=77–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Nuchal Ligament of Homo Sapien.jpg| thumb|Nuchal ligament of ''Homo sapiens'']]

'''Shoulder and head stabilization:''' The human skeleton is different from early hominins as there is less of a connection between the [[pectoral girdle]] parts of the shoulders and upper back and head, which would be advantageous for climbing but would hinder the movements of the upper body needed to counter leg movement and therefore stabilize the body and head when running. This stabilization is unnecessary in walking.

'''Limb length and mass:''' ''Homo'' has longer legs relative to body mass, which helps to decrease the energetic costs of running, as time in contact with the ground increases.&lt;ref name=number8 /&gt; There is also a decrease in mass of distal parts of limbs of humans, which is known to decrease metabolic costs in endurance running, but has little effect on walking.&lt;ref name=number8 /&gt; Additionally, the mass of the upper body limbs in ''Homo'' has decreased considerably, relative to total body mass, which is important to reduce the effort of stabilizing the arms in running.

'''Joint surface:''' Humans have evolved to absorb great shock and force on the skeletal structure while running. The impact force on the body can reach up to 3-4 times body weight in endurance running, putting the skeletal structure under great stress. To reduce this stress humans have increased joint surfaces relative to body mass to spread force over larger surface areas, particularly in the lower body.&lt;ref name=number8 /&gt; This adaptation, which allows humans to absorb great shock and force applied to the skeleton, is not seen in australopithecine skeletal structures.

'''Plantar arch:''' The [[plantar arch]] in the human foot has an elastic spring function that generates energy for running but not walking.&lt;ref name=number8 /&gt; Fossils of the australopithecine foot show only partial arch, suggesting less of a spring capacity. For the plantar arch spring mechanism to function fully, there must also be restricted rotation in the hind and front parts of the foot. This restriction comes from projected toe bone and compacted mid-foot joint structures in humans, which does not become present until ''Homo habilis''.&lt;ref name=number8 /&gt;

'''Calcaneal tuber and Achilles tendon:''' Studies have explored the calcaneal tuber, the posterior half of the calcaneus bone, as a correlate for [[Achilles tendon]] length and have found correlation between calcaneal tuber length and Achilles tendon length. Because shorter calcaneal tuber length leads to greater Achilles stretch, more kinetic energy is converted to elastic energy, translating into better overall [[running economy]]. Comparisons between Neanderthals and modern humans reveal that this adaptation was absent in Neanderthals, leading researchers to conclude that endurance running capabilities may have been enhanced in anatomically modern humans.&lt;ref name="Raichlen"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Raichlen|first=D.A.|author2=Armstrong, H |author3=Lieberman, D.E. |title=Calcaneus length determines running economy: Implications for endurance running performance in modern humans and Neandertals.|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|date=26 January 2011|volume=60|pages=299–308|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmet/21269660|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2010.11.002|pmid=21269660}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

'''Shorter toes:''' Human toes are straight and extremely short in relation to body size compared to other animals. In running, the toes support 50 to 75% of body mass in humans. [[Impulse (physics)|Impulse]] and mechanical work increase in humans as toe length increases, showing that it is energetically favorable to have shorter toes. The costs of shorter toes are decreased gripping capabilities and power output. However, the efficiency benefits seem to outweigh these costs, as the toes of ''A. afarensis'' remains were shorter than great apes, but 40% longer than modern humans, meaning that there is a trend toward shorter toes as the primate species moves away from tree-dwelling. This 40% increase in toe length would theoretically induce a flexor impulse 2.5 times that of modern humans, which would require twice as much mechanical work to stabilize.&lt;ref name="Rolian"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rolian|first=Campbell|author2=Lieberman, Daniel |author3=Hamill, Joseph |author4=Scott, John |author5= Werbel, William |title=Walking, running and the evolution of short toes in humans|journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology|date=November 2008|pages=212, 713–721}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stabilization===
'''Semicircular canal:''' The [[semicircular canal]], a series of three interconnected tubes within each ear, is important for sensing angular rotations of the head and thus plays a crucial role in maintaining balance and sensing and coordinating movement. Comparative studies have shown that animals with larger semicircular canals are able to sense a greater range of head movements and therefore have greater speed and agility. Evolutionarily, greatly reduced semicircular canal diameters are evident in Neanderthals but expanded in modern humans, suggesting that this adaptation was selected for in response to increased endurance running.&lt;ref name=Raichlen /&gt;

'''Vestibulo-ocular reflexes (VORs):''' [[Vestibulo-ocular reflex|VORs]] are enabled by muscles in the eye, which sense angular accelerations of the head and adjust eye movements to stabilize these images. This was an important adaptation for running because it allowed ''Homo'' to see more clearly during the rough pitching motion that occurs during running.&lt;ref name=Lieberman /&gt;

'''Gluteals:''' The [[gluteus maximus]] in ''Homo erectus'' is significantly larger than that of ''Australopithecus''. It is suited to stabilize the trunk while running, but gluteals of that size and strength are not necessary for walking.

'''Iliac spine:''' ''Homo'' has expanded areas on the sacrum and posterior iliac spine for greater muscle attachment. These areas are used to stabilize the trunk and reduce the body's forward pitch caused by running strides.

===Increased efficiency===
==== Thermoregulation ====
{{further|Thermoregulation}}
In addition to advances in skeletal structure and stabilization, adaptations that led to increased efficiency in dissipation of heat were instrumental in the evolution of endurance running in ''Homo''.&lt;ref name="Carrier" /&gt; The duration for which an animal can run is determined by its capacity to release more heat than is produced to avoid lethal temperatures.

The majority of mammals, including humans, rely on evaporative cooling to maintain body temperature. Most medium-to-large mammals rely on panting, while humans rely on [[perspiration|sweating]], to dissipate heat. Advantages to panting include cooler skin surface, little salt loss, and heat loss by forced convection instead of reliance on wind or other means of convection. On the other hand, sweating is advantageous in that evaporation occurs over a much larger surface area (the skin), and it is independent of respiration, thus is a much more flexible mode of cooling during intense activity such as running. Because human sweat glands are under a higher level of neuronal control than those of other species, they allow for the excretion of more sweat per unit surface area than any other species. Heat dissipation of later hominins was also enhanced by the reduction in body hair.&lt;ref name="Carrier"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carrier|first=D.R.|title=The Energetic Paradox of Human Running and Hominid Evolution|journal=Current Anthropology|date=Aug–Oct 1984|volume=25|issue=4|pages=483–495|jstor=2742907|doi=10.1086/203165|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; By ridding themselves of an insulating fur coat, running humans are better able to dissipate the heat generated by exercise.

In addition to improved thermoregulation, hominins have evolved an enhanced method of respiration consistent with the demands of running. Due to their orientation, respiration in quadrupedal mammals is affected by skeletal and muscular stresses generated through the motion of running. The bones and muscles of the chest cavity are not only responsible for shock absorption, but are also subjected to continuous compression and expansion during the running cycle. Because of this movement, quadrupeds are restricted to one breath per locomotor cycle, and thus must coordinate their running gait and respiration rate.&lt;ref name=Carrier /&gt; This tight coordination then translates into another restriction: a specific running speed that is most energetically favorable. The upright orientation of bipedal hominins, however, frees them from this respiration-gait restriction. Because their chest cavities are not directly compressed or involved in the motion of running, hominins are able to vary their breathing patterns with gait.&lt;ref name=Carrier /&gt; This flexibility in respiration rate and running gait contributes to hominins having a broader range of energetically favorable running speeds.

==== Storage and utilization of energy ====
During periods of prolonged exercise, animals are dependent on a combination of two sources of fuel: [[glycogen]] stored in the muscles and liver, and fat. Because glycogen is more easily oxidized than fat, it is depleted first. However, over longer periods of time, energy demands require that fat stores be utilized as fuel. This is true for all mammals, but hominins, and later modern humans, have an advantage of being able to alter their diet to meet these prolonged energy demands.

In addition to flexibility in the utilization of energy, hominins have evolved larger [[thyroid]] and [[adrenal]] glands which enable them to utilize the energy in carbohydrates and fatty acids more readily and efficiently. These organs are responsible for releasing hormones including epinephrine, norepinephrine, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), glucagon, and thyroxine. Larger glands allows for greater production of these key hormones and ultimately, maximized utilization of stored fuel.&lt;ref name=Carrier /&gt;

Taken together, the flexibility in diet and the enhanced usage of fuel heightens the previously mentioned finding that, unlike quadrupeds, hominins do not have a single energetically optimal running speed. For quadrupeds, increasing running speed means increasing the demand for oxygen and fuel. Due to skeletal structure and bipedalism, hominins are free to run energetically over a broader range of speeds and gaits, while maintaining a constant energy consumption rate of approximately 4.1&amp;nbsp;MJ per 15&amp;nbsp;km. Thus their utilization of energy is greatly enhanced.&lt;ref name=Carrier /&gt;

==Endurance running and scavenging==
All of the aforementioned adaptations enabled Homo to scavenge for food more effectively. Endurance running could have been used as a means of gaining access to distant carcasses or food stores faster than other scavengers and/or carnivores. Scavenging may have taken one or both of two forms: Opportunistic scavenging and strategic scavenging.

Early Homo almost certainly scavenged opportunistically. Scavenging is considered opportunistic when one "come[s] across carcasses in the course of [their] daily foraging activities".&lt;ref name=Lieberman /&gt;

Strategic scavenging involves a planned search for carcasses. This style of scavenging would have benefitted from endurance running much more than opportunistic scavenging. Strategic scavenging would have involved the use of long range cues, such as birds circling overhead. Endurance running would have been advantageous in this setting because it allowed hominins to reach the carcass more quickly. Selection pressures would have been very high for strategic scavenging, because hominins were diurnal, while their major competitors (hyenas, lions, etc.) were not. Thus, they would have had to make sure to capitalize on daytime carcasses. Selection pressure also came from the weakness of Homo. Because they were very weak, they were unlikely to drive off any large competition at the carcass. This fact led to an even higher need for a way to reach the carcass before these competitors.&lt;ref name=Lieberman /&gt;

==Endurance running and persistence hunting==
[[Persistence hunting]] is "a form of pursuit hunting in which [the hunter uses] endurance running during the midday heat to drive [prey] into [[hyperthermia]] and exhaustion so they can easily be killed".&lt;ref name="Carrier" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lieberman /&gt; Many question persistence hunting's plausibility when bow and arrow and other technologies were so much more efficient. However, in the Early Stone Age (ESA), spears were only sharpened wood, and hominins had not begun using tools. The lack of spearheads or bows meant they could only hunt from very close range—between 6 and 10 meters.&lt;ref name="Churchill"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Churchill|first=S.E.|title=Weapon technology, prey size selection and hunting methods in modern hunter gatherers: implications for hunting in the [[Paleolithic]] and [[Mesolithic]]|journal=Archeological Papers of the American Anthropological Association|year=1993|issue=4|pages=11–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hominins thus must have developed a way to stab prey from close range without causing serious bodily harm to themselves. Persistence hunting makes killing an animal easier by first bringing it to exhaustion, so that it can no longer retaliate violently.

Persistence hunters work by hunting in the middle of the day, when it is hottest. Hunters choose a single target prey and chase it at a speed between its trot and gallop, which is extremely inefficient for the animal. The hunter then continues pursuing over a period of hours, during which he may lose sight of the animal. In this case, the hunter must use tracks and an understanding of the animal to continue the chase. The prey eventually overheats and becomes unable to continue fleeing. Homo, which does not overheat as quickly because of its superior thermoregulation capabilities, is then able to stab the prey while it is incapacitated and cannot attack.

===Tracking===
Due to the complexity of following a fleeing animal, tracking methods must have been a prerequisite for the use of endurance running in persistence hunting. Scientists posit that early tracking methods were developed in open, sparsely vegetated terrain such as the [[Kalahari Desert]] in southern Africa. This "systemic tracking" involves simply following the footprints of animals and was most likely used for tracking grassland species on soft terrain. Skeletal remains suggest that during the Middle Stone Age, hominins used systemic tracking to scavenge for medium-sized animals in vegetation cover, but for hunting antelope in more open grasslands. From the Middle Stone Age into the Later Stone Age, tracking methods developed into what is termed "speculative tracking". When tracks could not easily be found and followed, ''Homo'' predicted where tracks were most likely to be found and interpreted other signs to locate prey.&lt;ref name="Liebenberg"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liebenberg|first=Louis|title=Persistence Hunting by Modern Hunter-Gatherers|journal=Current Anthropology|date=December 2006|volume=47|issue=6|pages=1017–1026|jstor=10.1086/508695|doi=10.1086/508695}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This advanced method of tracking allowed for the exploitation of prey in a variety of terrains, making endurance running for persistence hunting more plausible.

===Examples of persistence hunters===
Although exact dates and methods of persistence hunting are difficult to study, several recent accounts of persistence hunting have been recorded. Tribes in the Kalahari Desert in Botswana have been known to employ endurance running to scavenge and hunt prey. In the open country, the !Xo and /Gwi tribes run down slow-moving animals such as aardvark and porcupines, while during the hotter part of the day, they target animals such as [[Common eland|eland]], [[kudu]], [[gemsbok]], [[hartebeest]], [[duiker]], [[steenbok]], [[cheetah]], [[caracal]], and [[African wildcat]]s. In addition to these existing African tribes, it has been suggested that the [[Tarahumara people]] in Mexico and the [[Southern Paiute|Paiute people]] and [[Navajo people|Navajo]] in the American Southwest, used persistence hunting to capture prey including deer and pronghorn. The [[Aboriginal Australians|Aborigines]] in Australia are known to have hunted kangaroo in similar ways.&lt;ref name=Liebenberg /&gt;  Due to the increased availability of weapons, nutrition, tracking devices, and motor vehicles, one may argue that persistence hunting is no longer an effective method of hunting animals for food. However, there are examples of the practice occurring in modern times: the !Xo and /Gwi in the central Kalahari, still practice persistence hunting and have developed advanced methods of doing so. Similarly, the Russian [[Lykov family]] that lived in isolation for 40 years also used persistence hunting due to a lack of weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/For-40-Years-This-Russian-Family-Was-Cut-Off-From-Human-Contact-Unaware-of-World-War-II-188843001.html |title=For 40 Years, This Russian Family Was Cut Off From All Human Contact, Unaware of World War II &amp;#124; History &amp;#124; Smithsonian |publisher=Smithsonianmag.com |date=2013-01-28 |accessdate=2016-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

File:Gemsbok photo.jpg|[[Gemsbok]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Seasonal differences===
In particular, these two tribes maximize the efficiency of persistence hunting by targeting specific species during different seasons. In the rainy season, prime targets include steenbok, duiker, and gemsbok, as wet sand opens their hooves and stiffens their joints. Hunting in the early rainy season is particularly advantageous because dry leaves form "rocks" in the animals' stomachs, resulting in diarrhea. Stiff joints and suboptimal digestion make the prey weaker and more available targets. In contrast, in the dry season, hunters run down kudu, eland, and red hartebeest because these species tire more easily in the loose sand. Hunters say that the best time to practice persistence hunting is near the end of the dry season when animals are poorly nourished and therefore more easily run to exhaustion.&lt;ref name=Liebenberg /&gt;  By targeting the most vulnerable prey during each season, the hunters maximize the advantages of endurance running.

===Conditions/parameters===
# Persistence hunting must be performed during the day when it is hot, so that the animal will overheat.
# ''Homo'' must have been able to track the animal, as they would have lost sight of it during the chase.
# Such a long hunt requires high amounts of dietary sources of water, salt, and [[glycogen]].
# Although the success rate of recorded persistence hunts is very high (approximately 50%&lt;ref name=Lieberman /&gt;), unsuccessful hunts are very costly. Therefore, there would have had to be a social system in which individuals share food, so unsuccessful hunters could borrow food from others when necessary.

==In culture and folklore==
In the oral traditions of the [[Hadza people|Hadza]], an isolated [[Indigenous peoples of Africa|aboriginal]] people of [[hunter-gatherers]] living in [[Tanzania]], the ''Tlaatlanebe'' in their folk history's second [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]] practiced this.

In the first epoch, the world was inhabited by large hairy humanoids called ''Akakaanebe'' ("ancestors"), who did not yet possess tools or fire. They simply "stared" at game until it fell dead, referring to either [[scavenging]] or early [[persistence hunting]] without weapons, or a combination of the two. They did not build houses but slept under trees.

The Tlaatlanebe of the second epoch, however, were large but without hair and lived in caves. As animals had grown more wary of humans due to earlier hunting, they now had to be chased and hunted with dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ndagala|first=D. K.|last2=Zengu|first2=N.|title=Who needs the past?: indigenous values and archaeology|year=1994|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-415-09558-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7TPIDL9RdsoC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=From+the+raw+to+the+cooked:+Hadzabe+perceptions+of+their+past#v=onepage&amp;q=From%20the%20raw%20to%20the%20cooked%3A%20Hadzabe%20perceptions%20of%20their%20past&amp;f=false|editor=Robert Layton|chapter=From the raw to the cooked: Hadzabe perceptions of their past|pages=51–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
While there is evidence supporting selection on human morphology to improve endurance running ability, there is some dispute over whether the ecological benefits of scavenging and persistence hunting foraging behaviors were the driving force behind this development.

The majority of the arguments opposing persistence hunting and scavenging behaviors are linked to the fact that the paleohabitat and [[paleoecology]] of early ''Homo'' were not conducive to these behaviors. It is thought that the earliest members of ''Homo'' lived in African savanna-woodlands.&lt;ref name=number9 /&gt; This environment consisted of open grassland, as well as parts with dense vegetation—an intermediate between forest and open savannas. The presence of such tree covering would reduce visibility and so require tracking skills. This causes problems for the hypothesis of persistence hunting and running to aid scavenging.

===Against persistence hunting===

[[Ungulates]] are known from archaeological evidence to have been the main prey of the early ''Homo'', and given their great speed, they would have easily been able to outrun early hominins. Ungulate speed, coupled with the variable visibility of the savanna-woodland, meant that hunting by endurance running required the ability to track prey. Pickering and Bunn argue that tracking is part of a sophisticated cognitive skill set that early hominins would not have had, and that even if they were following a trail of blood left by an injured ungulate—which may have been in their cognitive capacity—the ability to craft penetrating projectile technology was absent in early hominins.&lt;ref name="number9"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pickering|first=Travis Rayne|author2=Bunn, Henry|title=The endurance running hypothesis and hunting and scavenging in savanna-woodlands|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|date=October 2007|volume=53|issue=4|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2007.01.012|pages=434–438|pmid=17720224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that modern hunters in Africa do not use persistence hunting as a foraging method, and most often give up a chase where the trail they were following ends in vegetation.&lt;ref name=number9 /&gt; The rare groups of hunters who do occasionally participate in persistence hunting are able to do so because of the extremely hot and open environments. In these groups, a full day of rest and recovery is required after a hunt, indicating the great toll persistence hunts take on the body, making them rare undertakings.&lt;ref name=number9 /&gt;

Finally, in critique of Liebenberg's research on modern day persistence hunting, it was revealed that the majority of the hunts initiated were prompted for filming rather than spontaneous, and that few of these hunts were successful. The hunts that were successful involved external factors such as the hunters being able to stop and refill water bottles.&lt;ref name=number9 /&gt;

A response to these criticisms has been formulated by Lieberman et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The evolution of endurance running and the tyranny of ethnography: A reply to Pickering and Bunn (2007)|url=http://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/3743587/2007i.pdf?sequence=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; noting that it is unclear how humans could have grown to occupy a new niche as a diurnal social carnivore without persistence hunting, as the weapons preferred in modern hunter-gatherer tribes would not have been available at the time.

===Against scavenging===
The proposed benefit of endurance running in scavenging is the ability of early hominins to outcompete other scavengers in reaching food sources.&lt;ref name=number9 /&gt; However paleoanthropological studies suggest that the savanna-woodland habitat caused a very low competition environment. Due to low visibility, carcasses were not easily located by mammalian carnivores, resulting in less competition.

One analyst suggested that this quote describes the controversial concept of equality of outcome&lt;ref name=MarkCooray/&gt;]]
'''Equality of outcome''', '''equality of condition''', or '''equality of results''' is a [[politics|political]] concept which is central to some political [[ideology|ideologies]] and is used regularly in political discourse, often in contrast to the term [[equality of opportunity]].&lt;ref name=twsO42xx/&gt; It describes a state in which people have approximately the same material wealth and income, or in which the general economic conditions of their lives are alike. Achieving equal results generally entails reducing or eliminating material inequalities between individuals or households in a society and usually involves a transfer of [[income]] or [[wealth]] from wealthier to poorer individuals, or adopting other measures to promote equality of condition. A related way of defining equality of outcome is to think of it as "equality in the central and valuable things in life".&lt;ref name=twsO24/&gt; One account in the ''Journal of Political Philosophy'' suggested that the term meant "equalising where people end up rather than where or how they begin", but described this sense of the term as "simplistic" since it failed to identify what was supposed to be made equal.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, A.

==Comparisons with related concepts==
Equality of outcome is often compared to related concepts of equality, particularly with equality of opportunity. Generally, most senses of the concept of equality are controversial and are seen differently by people having different political perspectives, but of all of the terms relating to equality, equality of outcome is the most "controversial" or "contentious".&lt;ref name=twsO42xx&gt;{{cite news|author= Mark E.

==Political philosophy==
In [[political philosophy]], there are differing views whether equal outcomes are beneficial or not. One view is that there is a moral basis for equality of outcome, but that means to achieve such an outcome can be malevolent.{{How|date=August 2018|text=how so?}}&lt;!--- the basic idea of how the process can be problematic is the idea of forced redistribution -- taking wealth and property from the 'haves' and giving them to the 'have-nots', meaning that it might result in a fair(er) outcome later on, but the means of doing so, the forced redistribution, could be considered (by the 'haves' of course) as a type of violence against them.---&gt; Equality of outcome can be a good thing after it has been achieved since it reflects the natural "interdependence of citizens in a highly organized economy" and provides a "basis for social policies" which foster harmony and good will, including social cohesion and reduced jealousy. One writer suggested greater socioeconomic equality was "indispensable if we want to realise our shared commonsense values of societal fairness".&lt;ref name=twsO28&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1987 book ''The Passion for Equality'', analyst Kenneth Cauthen suggested that there were moral underpinnings for having equal outcomes because there is a common good—which people both contribute to and receive benefits from—and therefore should be enjoyed in common. Cauthen argued that this was a fundamental basis for both equality of opportunity as well as equality of outcome.&lt;ref name=twsO43&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An opposing view is that equality of outcomes is not beneficial overall for society since it dampens motivation necessary for humans to achieve great things, such as new inventions, intellectual discoveries and artistic breakthroughs. According to this view, economic wealth and social status are rewards needed to spur such activity and with these rewards diminished, then achievements which will ultimately benefit everybody will not happen as frequently.

If equality of outcomes is seen as beneficial for society and if people have differing levels of material wealth and social prestige in the present, then methods to transform a society towards one with greater equality of outcomes is problematic. A mainstream view is that mechanisms to achieve equal outcomes—to take a society and with unequal socioeconomic levels and force it to equal outcomes—are fraught with moral as well as practical problems since they often involve political coercion to compel the transfer.&lt;ref name=twsO43/&gt;

There is also general agreement that outcomes matter. In one report in Britain, unequal outcomes in terms of personal wealth had a strong impact on average [[life expectancy]], such that wealthier people tended to live seven years longer than poorer people and that egalitarian nations tended to have fewer problems with societal issues such as [[mental illness]], [[violence]], [[teenage pregnancy]] and other social problems.&lt;ref name=twsO35&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authors of the book ''The Spirit Level'' contended that "more equal societies almost always do better" on other measures and as a result striving for equal outcomes can have overall beneficial effects for everybody.&lt;ref name=twsO35/&gt;

In his ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' (1971), philosopher [[John Rawls]] developed a "second principle of justice" that economic and social inequalities can only be justified if they benefit the most disadvantaged members of society. Rawls further claims that all economically and socially privileged positions must be open to all people equally. Rawls argues that the inequality between a doctor's salary and a grocery clerk's is only acceptable if this is the only way to encourage the training of sufficient numbers of doctors, preventing an unacceptable decline in the availability of medical care (which would therefore disadvantage everyone). Writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'', analyst [[Paul Krugman]] agreed with Rawls' position in which both [[equality of opportunity]] and equality of outcome were linked and suggested that "we should try to create the society each of us would want if we [[Veil of ignorance|didn’t know in advance who we’d be]]".&lt;ref name=twsO22/&gt; Krugman favored a society in which hard-working and talented people can get rewarded for their efforts, but in which there was a "[[social safety net]]" created by taxes to help the less fortunate.&lt;ref name=twsO22&gt;{{cite news

===Comparisons with Marxism, socialism and communism===
The German economist and philosopher [[Karl Marx]] is sometimes mistakenly characterized as an [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] and a proponent of equality of outcome and the economic systems of [[socialism]] and [[communism]] are sometimes misconstrued as being based on equality of outcome{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}. In reality, Marx eschewed the entire concept of equality as abstract and bourgeois in nature, focusing his analysis on more concrete issues such as opposition to exploitation based on economic and materialist logic{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}. Marx renounced theorizing on moral concepts and refrained from advocating principles of justice{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}. Marx's views on equality were informed by his analysis of the development of the [[productive forces]] in society.&lt;ref name="Rejecting Egalitarianism, 1987"&gt;''Rejecting Egalitarianism'', by Nielsen, Kai. 1987. Political Theory, Vol. 15, No. 3 (Aug., 1987), pp. 411-423.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/egalitarianism/#KarMarEquRig|title=Egalitarianism|author=|date=16 August 2002|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Socialism is based on a principle of distribution whereby individuals receive compensation proportional to the amount of energy and labor they contribute to production ("[[To each according to his contribution]]"), which by definition precludes equal outcomes in income distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosser|first=Mariana V. and J Barkley Jr.|title=Comparative Economics in a Transforming World Economy|publisher=MIT Press|date=July 23, 2003|isbn= 978-0262182348|pages=12|quote=In his 1871 Critique of the Gotha Program, Karl Marx enunciated the ideal goal of pure communism as being ‘from each according to his ability, to each according to his need.’ This does not imply complete equality of income, as people have different needs, for example, different family sizes or health problems. Marx contrasted this goal with that of socialism, which would be ‘from each according to his ability, to each according to his work.'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Marxist theory, communism is based on a principle whereby access to goods and services is based on free and open access (often referred to as distribution based on one's needs in the literature); Marx stressed free access to the articles of consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Busky|first=Donald F.|title=Democratic Socialism: A Global Survey|publisher=Praeger|date=July 20, 2000|isbn= 978-0275968861|page=4|quote=Communism would mean free distribution of goods and services. The communist slogan, '[[From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs]]' (as opposed to 'work') would then rule}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "equality" in a communist society is thus not about total equality or equality of outcome, but about equal and [[free access]] to the articles of consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steele|first=David Ramsay|title=From Marx to Mises: Post Capitalist Society and the Challenge of Economic Calculation|publisher=Open Court|date=September 1999|isbn=978-0875484495|page=66|quote=Marx distinguishes between two phases of marketless communism: an initial phase, with labor vouchers, and a higher phase, with free access.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marx argued that free access to consumption would enable individuals to overcome [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]].

Despite this, socialists, communists and Marxists believe that by eliminating exploitation their respective principle of compensation will lead to [[emancipation]] and greater equality than that found in capitalism because there would be no inequality arising from [[private property|private ownership of productive property]].&lt;!-- Source: the talk page: search for: 'this would lead to more equal outcomes than capitalism'. -Bo99 --&gt;

Perhaps the most insistent proponent of equality of outcome in modern political discourse was Fabian socialist, political thinker and dramatist [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]] (1856–1950). As opposed to Marxists, Shaw would have socialists place more emphasis on distribution rather than production. He developed his ideas on economic equality (and its implications for social, democratic, legal, military and gender concerns) in lectures and articles in the ten years following the writing of his 1905 play on poverty and power, ''[[Major Barbara]]'', at the same time as his Fabian colleague Beatrice Webb as primary author of the 1909 [[Minority report (Poor Law)|Minority Report]] on the Poor Law, along with her husband Sidney Webb, was proposing to abolish poverty in industrial societies by introducing what we now call the welfare state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Bernard Shaw and Beatrice Webb on Poverty and Equality in the Modern World 1905-1914|last=Peter|first=Gahan|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2017|isbn=978-3-319-48442-6|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1907 preface to ''Major Barbara'', Shaw was probably the first to argue for what he called "Universal Pensions for Life", now known as [[Guaranteed minimum income|universal incomes]]. Following major lectures on equality in 1910 and 1913, he gave his fullest exposition of economic equality in a series of six highly publicized Fabian public lectures at the end of 1914, “On Redistribution of Income”—a phrase, as he put it at the time, that he wanted to get into circulation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shaw|first=Bernard|last2=Gahan|first2=Peter|date=2016|title=Six Fabian Lectures on Redistribution of Income|journal=SHAW: Shaw and Money|publisher=Penn State University Press|volume=36|issue=1|pages=10–52|doi=10.5325/shaw.36.1.0010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although largely unacknowledged, most of the terms of the equality debate since (such as, for example, John Rawls and many recent writers on inequality) are as outlined in some detail in Shaw’s 1914 series of lectures, where he argued for a gradual incremental process towards equal incomes, mostly by levelling-up from the bottom though union activity and labor laws, minimum and basic incomes as well as by using such mechanisms as income and wealth (inheritance) taxes to prevent incomes rising at the top. In the end, the goal would have been achieved not at absolute equality, but when any remaining income differences would not yield any significant social difference. Like the later Fabian, W. H. Tawney, who further developed the equality debate, Shaw considered equality of opportunity as virtually meaningless without economic equality. Shaw later expanded his pre-World War One work on equality into his 1928 political magnum opus, ''[[The Intelligent Woman's Guide to Socialism and Capitalism|The Intelligent Woman’s Guide to Socialism and Capitalism]]''.

==Comparing equalities: outcome vs. opportunity==
[[File:FactoryProcessing.png|thumb|350px|right|In a lamp assembly factory, for example, equality of outcome might mean that workers are all paid equally regardless of how many lamps of acceptable quality they make (which also implies that the workers cannot be sacked for producing too few lamps of acceptable quality)—this can be contrasted with a payment system such as [[piece work]], which requires that every worker is paid a fixed amount of money per lamp of acceptable quality that the worker makes]]
Equality of outcome and equality of opportunity have been contrasted to a great extent. When evaluated in a simple context, the more preferred term in contemporary political discourse is equality of opportunity (or, meaning the same thing, the common variant "equal opportunities"), which the public as well as individual commentators see as the nicer or more "well-mannered"&lt;ref name=twsO45/&gt; of the two terms.&lt;ref name=twsO27&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term equality of outcome is seen as more controversial and is viewed skeptically. A mainstream political view is that the comparison of the two terms is valid, but that they are somewhat [[mutually exclusive]] in the sense that striving for either type of equality would require sacrificing the other to an extent and that achieving equality of opportunity necessarily brings about "certain inequalities of outcome".&lt;ref name=twsO26/&gt;&lt;ref name=twsO41&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, striving for equal outcomes might require discriminating between groups to achieve these outcomes; or striving for equal opportunities in some types of treatment might lead to unequal results.&lt;ref name=twsO41/&gt; Policies that seek an equality of outcome often require a deviation from the strict application of concepts such as [[meritocracy]] and legal notions of [[equality before the law]] for all citizens.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} Equality seeking policies may also have a [[Redistribution (economics)|redistributive focus]].

However, the two concepts are not always cleanly contrasted since the notion of equality is complex. Some analysts see the two concepts not as polar opposites but as highly related such that they can not be understood without considering the other term. One writer suggested it was unrealistic to think about equality of opportunity in isolation without considering inequalities of income and wealth.&lt;ref name=twsO28/&gt; Another agreed that it is impossible to understand equality without some assessment of outcomes.&lt;ref name=twsO45/&gt; A third writer suggested that trying to pretend that the two concepts were "fundamentally different" was an error along the lines of a [[conceit]].&lt;ref name=twsO35/&gt;

In contemporary political discourse, of the two concepts equality of outcome has sometimes been criticized as the "politics of envy" and is often seen as more "controversial" than equality of opportunity.&lt;ref name=twsO45/&gt; One wrote that "equality of opportunity is then set up as the mild-mannered alternative to the craziness of outcome equality".&lt;ref name=twsO45/&gt; One theorist suggested that an over-emphasis on either type of equality can "come into conflict with individual freedom and merit".&lt;ref name=twsO43/&gt;

Critics of [[equality of opportunity]] note that while it is relatively easier to deal with unfairness for people with different races or genders, it is much harder to deal with [[social class]] since "one can never entirely extract people from their ancestry and upbringing".&lt;ref name=twsO33&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, critics contend that efforts to bring fairness by equal opportunity are stymied by the difficulty of people having differing starting points at the beginning of the socio-economic competition. A person born into an upper-middle-class family will have greater advantages by the mere fact of birth than a person born into poverty.&lt;ref name=twsO33/&gt;

One newspaper account criticized discussion by politicians on the subject of equality as "weasely" and thought that the term was [[political correctness|politically correct]] and vague. Furthermore, when comparing equality of opportunity with equality of outcome, the sense was that the latter type was "worse" for society.&lt;ref name=twsO32&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equality of outcome may be incorporated into a philosophy that ultimately seeks equality of opportunity. Moving towards a higher equality of outcome (albeit not perfectly equal) can lead to an environment more adept at providing equality of opportunity by eliminating conditions that restrict the possibility for members of society to fulfill their potential. For example, a child born in a poor, dangerous neighborhood with poor schools and little access to healthcare may be significantly disadvantaged in his attempts to maximize use of talents, no matter how fine his [[work ethic]]. Thus even proponents of meritocracy may promote some level of equality of outcome in order to create a society capable of truly providing equality of opportunity.

While outcomes can usually be measured with a great degree of precision, it is much more difficult to measure the intangible nature of opportunities. That is one reason why many proponents of equal opportunity use measures of equality of outcome to judge success. Analyst Anne Phillips argued that the proper way to assess the effectiveness of the hard-to-measure concept of equality of opportunity is by the extent of the equality of outcome.&lt;ref name=twsO45/&gt; Nevertheless, she described a single criterion of equality of outcome as problematic—the measure of "preference satisfaction" was "ideologically loaded" while other measures such as [[income]] or [[wealth]] were inadequate and she advocated an approach which combined data about resources, occupations and roles.&lt;ref name=twsO45&gt;{{cite news

To the extent that inequalities can be passed from one [[generation]] to another through tangible gifts and wealth [[inheritance]], some claim that equality of opportunity for children cannot be achieved without equality of outcome for parents. Moreover, access to social institutions is affected by equality of outcome and it is further claimed that rigging equality of outcome can be a way to prevent co-option of non-economic institutions important to social control and policy formation, such as the legal system, media or the electoral process, by powerful individuals or coalitions of wealthy people.

Purportedly, greater equality of outcome is likely to reduce [[relative poverty]], leading to a more cohesive society. However, if taken to an extreme it may lead to greater [[absolute poverty]], if it negatively affects a country's [[GDP]] by damaging workers' sense of [[work ethic]] by destroying incentives to work harder. Critics of equality of outcome believe that it is more important to raise the [[standard of living]] of the poorest in absolute terms.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Some critics additionally disagree with the concept of equality of outcome on philosophical grounds.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Still others note that poor people of low social status often have a drive, hunger and ambition which ultimately lets them achieve better economic and social outcomes than their initially more advantaged rivals.

A related argument that is often encountered in education, especially in the [[debates on the grammar school]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and in the debates on [[gifted education]] in various countries, says that people by nature have differing levels of ability and initiative which result in some achieving better outcomes than others and it is therefore impossible to ensure equality of outcome without imposing inequality of opportunity.

==The concept in political argument==
[[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Debate about economic issues surrounding equality is as old as [[civilization]]—painting: Ancient Greek philosophers [[Plato]] (left) and [[Aristotle]] by [[Raffaello Sanzio]] (1509)]]
The concept of equality of outcome is an important one in battling between differing political positions since the concept of equality was overall seen as positive and an important foundation which is "deeply embedded in the fabric of modern politics".&lt;ref name=twsO26/&gt; There is much political jousting over what exactly equality means.&lt;ref name=twsO26/&gt; It is not a new phenomenon; battling between so-called haves and have-nots has happened throughout human civilization and was a focus of philosophers such as [[Aristotle]] in his treatise ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]''. In ''[[The Guardian]]'', analyst Julian Gloverrote wrote that equality challenged both left-leaning and right-leaning positions and suggested that the task of left-leaning advocates is to "understand the impossibility and undesirability of equality" while the task for right-leaning advocates was to "realise that a divided and hierarchical society cannot – in the best sense of that word – be fair".&lt;ref name=twsO31&gt;{{cite news|author= Julian Glover|title= The left should recognise that equality is undesirable: It sounds horribly rightwing, but a fair society may be one in which people have the right to strive for inequality|publisher= ''The Guardian''|quote=In the early days of New Labour it is said a media adviser whispered into an ambitious minister's ear after an interview: "We don't say equality, we say fairness."

Julian Glover wrote that fairness "compels no action" and compared it to an "atmospheric ideal, an invisible gas, a miasma" and to use an expression by [[Winston Churchill]], a "happy thought".&lt;ref name=twsO31/&gt;
* [[Social democracy|Social democrats]] champion greater equality of outcome and opportunities within capitalism, usually promoted through redistributive social policies like [[progressive tax]]ation and the provision of universal public services.
* Socialists often believe in both "inequality of opportunity and equality of outcome", according to Glenn Oliver. They often see greater equality of outcome as a positive long-term goal to be achieved, so that individuals have equal access to the means of production and consumption. Bernard Shaw was one of the few socialist theorists to advocate complete economic equality of outcome right at the beginning of World War One.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The vast majority of socialists view an ideal economy as one where remuneration is at least somewhat proportional to the degree of effort and personal sacrifice expended by individuals in the productive process. This latter concept was expressed by Karl Marx's famous maxim: "[[To each according to his contribution]]".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24060">'''Ethnic identity development''' or '''ethnic-racial identity (ERI) development''' includes the [[identity formation]] in an individual's [[self-identification|self-categorization]] in, and psychological attachment to, (an) [[ethnic]] group(s).  Ethnic identity is characterized as part of one’s overarching [[self-concept]] and [[Identity (social science)|identification]]. It is distinct from the [[ethnogenesis|development of ethnic group identities]].

With some few exceptions, ethnic and racial identity development is associated positively with good psychological outcomes, psychosocial outcomes (e.g., better self-beliefs, less depressive symptoms), academic outcomes (e.g., better engagement in school), and health outcomes (e.g., less risk of [[risky sexual behavior]] or drug use).

Development of ethnic identity begins during adolescence&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=French|first=Sabine Elizabeth|last2=Seidman|first2=Edward|last3=Allen|first3=LaRue|last4=Aber|first4=J.

S. &amp; Ong, A.D. (2007). Conceptualization and measurement of ethnic identity: Current status and future directions. ''Journal of Counseling Psychology, 54,'' 271-281.&lt;/ref&gt; and includes gaining knowledge and understanding of [[ingroups and outgroups|in-group(s)]], as well as a sense of belonging to (an) ethnic group(s). It is important to note that given the vastly different histories of various racial groups, particularly in the United States, that ethnic and racial identity development looks very different between different groups, especially when looking at minority (e.g., Black American) compared to majority (e.g., White American) group comparisons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Helms|first=Janet|date=1995|title=An update of Helm's White and people of color racial identity models|url=|journal=Annual Multicultural Winter Roundtable|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnic identity is sometimes interchanged with, held distinct from, or considered as overlapping with [[racial identity|racial]], [[cultural identity|cultural]] and even [[National identity|national identities]]. This disagreement in the distinction (or lack thereof) between these concepts may originate from the incongruity of definitions of race and ethnicity, as well as the historic conceptualization of models and research surrounding ethnic and racial identity.  Research on racial identity development emerged from the experiences of African Americans during the civil rights movement, however expanded over time to include the experiences of other racial groups.&lt;ref name="Wij"&gt;Wijeyesinghe, C. L., &amp; Jackson, B. W. (2001). New perspectives on racial identity development. New York: NYU Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of racial identity is often misunderstood and can have several meanings which are derived from biological dimensions and social dimensions. Race is socially understood to be derived from an individual's physical features, such as white or black skin tone. The social construction of racial identity can be referred as a sense of group or collective identity based on one's perception that he or she shares a common heritage with a particular racial group. Racial identity is a surface-level manifestation based on what people look like yet has deep implications in how people are treated.&lt;ref name="Chá"&gt;Chávez, A. F. and Guido-DiBrito, F. (1999), Racial and Ethnic Identity and Development. New Directions for Adult and Continuing Education, 1999: 39–47. doi: 10.1002/ace.8405&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Generally, group level processes of ethnic identity have been explored by [[social science]] disciplines, including [[sociology]] and [[anthropology]]. In contrast, [[ethnic identity]] research within [[psychology]] usually focuses on the individual and interpersonal processes.  Within psychology, ethnic identity is typically studied by social, developmental and cross-cultural psychologists.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"&gt;Phinney, J. Ethnic identity. In A. Kazdin (Ed.), Encyclopedia of Psychology (Vol. 3, pp. 255-259). Washington, DC: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt;
Models of ethnic development emerged both social and developmental psychology, with different theoretical roots.

===Roots in social psychology===
Ethnic identity emerged in social psychology out of [[social identity theory]]. Social identity theory posits that belonging to social groups (e.g. religious groups or occupational groups) serves an important basis for one’s identity.&lt;ref name="Tajfel"&gt;Tajfel, H. &amp; Turner, J. C. (1986). The social identity theory of inter-group behavior. In S. Worchel &amp; L. W. Austin (Eds.), Psychology of Intergroup Relations. Chicago: Nelson-Hall&lt;/ref&gt; Membership in a group(s), as well as one’s value and emotional significance attached to this membership, is an important part of one’s self-concept. One of the earliest statements of social identity was made by [[Kurt Lewin]], who
emphasized that individuals need a firm sense of group identification
in order to maintain a sense of well-being.&lt;ref name="Lewin"&gt;Lewin, K. (1948). ''Resolving social conflicts''. New York: Harper.&lt;/ref&gt;  Social identity theory emphasizes a need to maintain a positive sense of self. Therefore in respect to ethnic identity, this underscores affirmation to and salience of ethnic group membership(s). In light of this, affirmation of ethnicity has been proposed to be more salient among groups who have faced greater discrimination, in order to maintain self-esteem. There has also been research on family influences, such as cultural values of the family. Also, specific aspects of parenting, such as their racial socialization of youth, can contribute to the socialization of adolescents.&lt;ref name="Cha"&gt;Chao, R. K., &amp; Otsuki-Clutter, M. (2011). Racial and Ethnic Differences: Sociocultural and 
Contextual Explanations. Journal of Research on Adolescence (Blackwell Publishing Limited), 21(1), 47-60. doi:10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00714.x&lt;/ref&gt;

Relatedly, [[collective identity]] is an overarching framework for different types of identity development, emphasizing the multidimensionality of group membership.&lt;ref name="Ashmore"&gt;Ashmore, R. D., Deaux, K., &amp; McLaughlin-Volpe, T. (2004). An organizing framework for collective identity: Articulation and significance of multidimensionality. ''Psychological Bulletin'', 130, 80-114.&lt;/ref&gt; Part of collective identity includes positioning oneself psychologically in a group to which you share some characteristic(s). This positioning does not require individuals to have direct contact with all members of the group. The collective identity framework has been related to ethnic identity development, particularly in recognizing the importance of personal identification of ethnicity through categorical membership. Collective identity also includes evaluation of one’s category.&lt;ref name="Ashmore" /&gt; This affective dimension is related to the importance of commitment and attachment toward one’s ethnic group(s).  A behavioral component of collective identity recognizes that individuals reflect group membership through individual actions, such as language usage, in respect to ethnic identity.&lt;ref name="Ashmore"/&gt;

===Roots in developmental psychology===
Identity becomes especially salient during adolescence as recognized by [[Erik Erikson]]’s stage theory of psychosocial development.  An individual faces a specific developmental crisis at each stage of development. In adolescence, identity search and development are critical tasks during what is termed the ‘Identity versus Role-confusion’ stage.
&lt;ref name="Erikson"&gt;Erikson, E.H.(1968). Identity, youth, and crisis. New York: Norton.&lt;/ref&gt;
Achievement of this stage ultimately leads to a stable sense of self.  The idea of an achieved identity includes reconciling identities imposed on oneself with one’s need to assert control and seek out an identity that brings satisfaction, feelings of industry and competence. In contrast, identity confusion occurs when individuals fail to achieve a secure identity, and lack clarity about their role in life.

[[James Marcia]] elaborated on Erik Erikson’s model to include identity formation in a variety of life domains.  Marcia’s focus of identity formation includes two processes which can be applied to ethnic identity development: an exploration of identity and a commitment.&lt;ref name="Marcia"&gt;Marcia, J.E. (1991). Identity  and self development.  In R. Lerner, A. Peterson, &amp; J. Brooks-Gunn (Eds.), ''Encyclopedia of adolescence''(Vol.1). New York: Garland.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcia defines four identity statuses which combines the presence or absence of the processes of exploration and commitment: Identity diffusion (not engaged in exploration or commitment), identity foreclosure (a lack of exploration, yet committed), moratorium (process of exploration without having made a commitment), and identity achievement (exploration and commitment of identity).

Researchers believe and have frequently reported that older individuals are more likely to be in an achieved identity status than younger people. Evidence shows that increasing age and a wide range of life experiences helps individuals develop cognitive skills. This combination of age, life experiences, and improved cognitive skills helps adolescents and young adults find their authentic selves.&lt;ref name="Bra"&gt;Branch, C. (2001). The many faces of self: ego and ethnic identities. The Journal of Genetic Psychology, 162(4), 412-429.&lt;/ref&gt;  Adolescents with strong commitments to their ethnic identities also tend to explore these identities more than their peers.&lt;ref name="Meeus"&gt;Meeus, Wim.  (2011).  The study of adolescent identity formation 2000-2010: a review of longitudinal research.  In Journal of Research on Adolescence, 21(1), 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Factors during adolescence ==
While children in early to middle childhood develop the ability to categorize themselves and others using racial and ethnic labels, it is largely during adolescence that ethnic and racial identity develops. Adriana J. Umaña-Taylor and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Umaña-Taylor|first=Adriana J.|last2=Quintana|first2=Stephen M.|last3=Lee|first3=Richard M.|last4=Cross|first4=William E.|last5=Rivas-Drake|first5=Deborah|last6=Schwartz|first6=Seth J.|last7=Syed|first7=Moin|last8=Yip|first8=Tiffany|last9=Seaton|first9=Eleanor|date=2014-01-01|title=Ethnic and Racial Identity During Adolescence and Into Young Adulthood: An Integrated Conceptualization|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cdev.12196/abstract|journal=Child Development|language=en|volume=85|issue=1|pages=21–39|doi=10.1111/cdev.12196|issn=1467-8624}}&lt;/ref&gt; write about the following concepts as playing key roles during this stage:

Cognitive milestones include: abstract thinking, introspection, metacognition, and further development of social-cognitive abilities.

Physiological changes include puberty and development of body image

Social and environmental context includes: family, peers, social demands and transitions, navigating an expanding world, and media

== Phinney's model of ethnic identity development ==

[[Jean Phinney]]’s model of ethnic identity development is a multidimensional model, with theoretical underpinnings of both Erikson and Marcia.&lt;ref name="Phinney"&gt;Phinney, J. S. (1990). Ethnic identity in adolescents and adults: A review of research. &lt;em&gt;Psychological
Bulletin, 108&lt;/em&gt;, 499–514.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Phinney1989"&gt;Phinney, J. (1989). Stages of ethnic identity in minority group adolescents.
Journal of Early Adolescence, 9, 34-49.&lt;/ref&gt; In line with Erikson's identity formation, Phinney focuses on the adolescent, acknowledging significant changes during this time period, including greater abilities in cognition to contemplate ethnic identity, as well as a broader exposure outside of their own community,  a greater focus on one's social life, and an increased concern for physical appearance.&lt;ref name="Phinney1989" /&gt;

Phinney's Three Stage Progression: 
*Unexamined Ethnic Identity – Prior to adolescence, children either give ethnicity little thought (related to Marcia's diffuse status) or are assumed to have derived their ethnic identity from others, rather than engaging in personal examination. This is related to Marcia's foreclosed identity status.  Knowledge of one's ethnicity is "absorbed", which reflects the process of [[socialization]].
Broadly, socialization in the context of ethnic identity development refers to the acquisition of behaviors, perceptions, values, and attitudes of an ethnic group(s).&lt;ref name="Rotherman"&gt;Rotherman, M., &amp; Phinney, J. (1987). Introduction: Definitions and perspectives in the study of children's ethnic socialization. In J. Phinney &amp; M. Rotherman (Eds.), Children's ethnic socialization: Pluralism and development (pp. 10-28). Beverly Hills, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; This process recognizes that feelings about one’s ethnic group(s) can be influenced by family, peers, community, and larger society. These contextual systems or networks of influence delineate from [[ecological systems theory]].  These systems influence children’s feelings of belonging and overall affect toward ethnic group(s). Children may internalize both positive and negative messages and therefore hold conflicting feelings about ethnicity. Socialization highlights how early experiences for children are considered crucial in regards to their ethnic identity development.

*Ethnic Identity Search- During the onset of adolescence, there is a questioning of accepted views of ethnicity and a greater understanding of ethnicity in a more abstract sense. Typically this stage has been characterized as being initiated by a significant experience that creates heightened awareness of ethnicity, such as discrimination. Engagement in some form of exploration includes an interest in learning more about one's culture and actively involving oneself in activities such as talking with others about ethnicity, reading books on the subject, and thinking about both the current and future effects of one's ethnicity.&lt;ref name="Phinney1989" /&gt; This stage is related to Erikson's ‘Identity versus Role-confusion’, and Marcia's moratorium.
*Ethnic Identity Achievement- This stage is characterized by clarity about one’s ethnic identity. The achievement phase includes a secure, confident, and stable sense of self.  Achievement also is characterized as a realistic assessment of one's in-group(s) in a larger social context.  In essence, the individual has internalized their ethnicity.This stage is related to Erikson's achieved identity, and identity achievement of Marcia. Identity achievement is also related to social identity theory in that this acceptance replaces one's negative ethnic self-image.&lt;ref name="Phinney1989" /&gt;  Although achievement represents the highest level of ethnic identity development, it should be noted that Phinney believes reexamination can occur depending on experiences over time.&lt;ref name="phinney and ong"/&gt;

More recently, Phinney has focused on the continuous dimensions of one's exploration and commitment to one's ethnic group(s), rather than on distinct identity statuses.&lt;ref name="phinney and ong"/&gt;

==Applications==
Research reveals ethnic identity development is related to psychological well-being.  Ethnic identity has been linked with positive self-evaluation&lt;ref name="Phinney1989" /&gt; and self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Greene"&gt;Greene, M.L., Way, N., Pahl, K. (2006). Trajectories of perceived adult and peer discrimination among black, Latino, and Asian American adolescents: Patterns and psychological correlates. ''Developmental Psychology, 42'', 218-238.&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnic identity development has also been shown to serve as a buffer between perceived discrimination and depression.&lt;ref name="Torres"&gt;Torres, L., &amp; Ong, A. D. (2010). A daily diary investigation of Latino ethnic identity, discrimination, and depression. ''Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology, 16''(4), 561-568.&lt;/ref&gt;
Specifically, commitment of an ethnic identity may help to abate depressive symptoms experienced soon after experiencing discrimination, which in turn alleviates overall stress. Researchers posit commitment to an ethnic identity group(s) is related to additional resources accumulated through the exploration process, including social support.&lt;ref name="Torres" /&gt;   
Ethnic identity development has been linked to happiness and decreased anxiety.  Specifically, regard for one’s ethnic group may buffer normative stress.&lt;ref name="Kiang"&gt;Kiang, L., Yip, T., Gonzales-Backen, M., Witkow, M., &amp; Fuligni, A. J. (2006). Ethnic identity and the daily psychological well-being of adolescents from Mexican and Chinese backgrounds. ''Child Development, 77''(5), 1338-1350.&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous studies show many positive outcomes associated with strong and stable ethnic identities, including increased self-esteem, improved mental health, decreased self-destructive behaviors, and greater academic achievement.&lt;ref name="Ort"&gt;Ortiz, A. M., &amp; Santos, S. J. (2010). Campus diversity and ethnic identity development. Diversity and Democracy, 13(2), 5-7. Retrieved from http://www.diversityweb.org/DiversityDemocracy/vol13no2/ortiz.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, empirical evidence suggests that ethnic identity exploration may be related to vulnerability to negative outcomes, such as depression.&lt;ref name="Torres" /&gt;  Findings suggest this is due to an individual’s sensitivity to awareness of discrimination and conflicts of positive and negative images of ethnicity during exploration. Also, while commitment to an ethnic group(s) is related to additional resources, exploration is related to a lack of ready-access resources.&lt;ref name="Torres" /&gt;

Studies have found that in terms of family cohesion, the closer adolescents felt to their parents, the more they reported feeling connected to their ethnic group. Given the family is a key source of ethnic socialization, closeness with the family may highly overlap with closeness with one’s ethnic group. Resources like family cohesion, proportion of same-ethnic peers, and ethnic centrality act as correlates of within-person change in ethnic identity, but it is only on the individual level and not as adolescents as a group.&lt;ref name="Kia"&gt;Kiang, L., Witkow, M. R., Baldelomar, O. A., &amp; Fuligni, A. J. (2010). Change in Ethnic Identity Across the High School Years Among Adolescents with Latin American, Asian, and European Backgrounds. Journal of Youth &amp; Adolescence,39(6),683-693. doi:10.1007/s10964-009-9429-5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other considerations==
Ethnic identity development has been conceptualized and researched primarily within the United States.  Due to the fact the individuals studied are typically from the United States, it may not be appropriate to extend findings or models to individuals in other countries. Some research has been conducted outside of the United States, however a majority of these studies were in Europe or countries settled by Europeans.&lt;ref name="Phinney" /&gt;

Further, researchers also suggest that racial and ethnic identity development must be viewed, studied, and considered alongside the other normative developmental processes (e.g., [[gender identity]] development) and cannot be considered in a vacuum - racial and ethnic identity exist in particular contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Joanna Lee|last2=Tolan|first2=Patrick H.|last3=Durkee|first3=Myles I.|last4=Francois|first4=, Amir G.|last5=Anderson|first5=Riana E.|date=2012-09-01|title=Integrating Racial and Ethnic Identity Research Into Developmental Understanding of Adolescents|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1750-8606.2012.00235.x/abstract|journal=Child Development Perspectives|language=en|volume=6|issue=3|pages=304–311|doi=10.1111/j.1750-8606.2012.00235.x|issn=1750-8606}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Research considers some studies of ethnic developments cross-sectional in design. This type of design pales in comparison to longitudinal design whose topic of investigation is developmental in nature. This is because cross-sectional studies collect data at or around the same time from multiple individuals of different ages of interest, instead of collecting data over multiple time points for each individual in the study, which would allow the researcher to compare change for individuals over time, as well as differences between individuals.

Another research consideration in the field is why certain ethnic and racial groups are looking towards their own expanding community for mates instead of continuing interracial marriages. An article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' explained that Asian-American couples have been kicking the trend and finding Asian mates because it gives them resurgence of interest in language and ancestral traditions.&lt;ref name="Swarns"&gt;Swarns, R. L. (2012, March 30). For Asian-American Couples, a Tie That Binds. New York Times. Retrieved from https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/01/fashion/more-asian-americans-marrying-within-their-race.html&lt;/ref&gt; Further research can be found and explored throughout the many different racial and ethnic groups.

Some researchers question the number of dimensions of ethnic identity development. For example, some measures of ethnic identity development include measures of behaviors, such as eating ethnic food or participating in customs specific to an ethnic group.   One argument is that  while behaviors oftentimes express identity, and are typically correlated with identity, ethnic identity is an internal structure that can exist without behavior.&lt;ref name="phinney and ong" /&gt; It has been suggested one can be clear and confident about one's ethnicity, without wanting to maintain customs.&lt;ref name="Phinney" /&gt; Others have found evidence of a behavioral component of ethnic identity development, separate from cognition and affect, and pertaining to one's ethnic identity.&lt;ref name="Gaines"&gt;Gaines, S.O., Bunce, D., Robertson, T., Wright, B. (2010). Evaluating the psychometric properties  of  the Multigroup Ethic Identity Measure (MEIM) within the United Kingdom. ''Identity: An International Journal of Theory and Research, 10,'' 1-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnic identity development points toward the importance of allowing an individual to self-identify ethnicity during data collection.  This method helps us collect the most accurate and relevant information about the subjective identification of the participant, and can be useful in particular with respect to research with multiethnic individuals.&lt;ref name="Phinney" /&gt;

This can be done by pairing the neutral stimulus with an aversive stimulus (e.g., a shock, loud noise, or [[unpleasant odor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wallace|first=Karin J.|last2=Rosen|first2=Jeffrey B.|title=Predator odor as an unconditioned fear stimulus in rats: Elicitation of freezing by trimethylthiazoline, a component of fox feces.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0735-7044.114.5.912|journal=Behavioral Neuroscience|volume=114|issue=5|pages=912–922|doi=10.1037/0735-7044.114.5.912}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Eventually, the neutral stimulus alone can elicit the state of fear. In the vocabulary of [[classical conditioning]], the neutral stimulus or context is the "conditional stimulus" (CS), the aversive stimulus is the "unconditional stimulus" (US), and the fear is the "conditional response" (CR).

=== Amygdala ===
Fear conditioning is thought to depend upon an area of the brain called the [[amygdala]]. [[Electrophysiology|Electrophysiological recordings]] from the amygdala have demonstrated that cells in that region undergo [[long-term potentiation]] (LTP), a form of [[synaptic plasticity]] believed to underlie learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sah|first=P.|last2=Westbrook|first2=R. F.|last3=Lüthi|first3=A.|date=2008-05-01|title=Fear Conditioning and Long-term Potentiation in the Amygdala|url=https://nyaspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1196/annals.1417.020|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|volume=1129|issue=1|pages=88–95|doi=10.1196/annals.1417.020|issn=1749-6632}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, inhibition of neurons in the amygdala disrupts fear acquisition, while stimulation of those neurons can drive fear-related behaviors, such as freezing behavior in rodents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bocchio|first=Marco|last2=Nabavi|first2=Sadegh|last3=Capogna|first3=Marco|date=2017-05-17|title=Synaptic Plasticity, Engrams, and Network Oscillations in Amygdala Circuits for Storage and Retrieval of Emotional Memories|url=http://www.cell.com/neuron/abstract/S0896-6273(17)30205-2|journal=Neuron|language=English|volume=94|issue=4|pages=731–743|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2017.03.022|issn=0896-6273}}&lt;/ref&gt; This indicates that proper function of the amygdala is both [[Necessity and sufficiency|necessary]] for fear conditioning and [[Necessity and sufficiency|sufficient]] to drive fear behaviors.

[[Joseph E. LeDoux]] has been instrumental in elucidating the amygdala's role in fear conditioning. He was one of the first to show that the amygdala undergoes long-term potentiation during fear conditioning, and that ablation of amygdala cells disrupts both learning and expression of fear, among many other achievements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=LeDoux|first=Joseph E.|date=2000-03-01|title=Emotion Circuits in the Brain|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.neuro.23.1.155|journal=Annual Review of Neuroscience|volume=23|issue=1|pages=155–184|doi=10.1146/annurev.neuro.23.1.155|issn=0147-006X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hippocampus ===

Some types of fear conditioning (e.g. contextual and trace) also involve the [[hippocampus]], an area of the brain believed to receive affective impulses from the amygdala and to integrate those impulses with previously existing information to make it meaningful. Some theoretical accounts of [[Psychological trauma|traumatic]] experiences suggest that amygdala-based fear bypasses the hippocampus during intense stress and can be stored somatically or as images that can return as physical symptoms or [[flashback (psychological phenomenon)|flashbacks]] without cognitive meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0736-9735.20.3.558 |title=Something wicked this way comes: Trauma, dissociation, and conflict: The space where psychoanalysis, cognitive science, and neuroscience overlap |year=2003 |last1=Bromberg |first1=Philip M. |journal=Psychoanalytic Psychology |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=558–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Molecular mechanisms ===

One of the major neurotransmitters involved in conditioned fear learning is [[Glutamic acid|glutamate]]. It has been suggested that [[NMDA receptor]]s (NMDARs) in the amygdala are necessary for fear memory acquisition, because disruption of NMDAR function disrupts development of fear responses in rodents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johansen|first=Joshua P.|last2=Cain|first2=Christopher K.|last3=Ostroff|first3=Linnaea E.|last4=LeDoux|first4=Joseph E.|date=2011-10-28|title=Molecular Mechanisms of Fear Learning and Memory|url=http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(11)01207-4|journal=Cell|language=English|volume=147|issue=3|pages=509–524|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2011.10.009|issn=0092-8674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Epigenetics ===

Conditioned fear may be inherited transgenerationally. In one experiment, mice were conditioned to fear an [[acetophenone]] odor and then set up to breed subsequent generations of mice. Those subsequent generations of mice also showed a behavioral sensitivity to acetophenone, which was accompanied by neuroanatomical and epigenetic changes that are believed to have been inherited from the parents' [[gamete]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dias|first=Brian G|last2=Ressler|first2=Kerry J|date=January 2014|title=Parental olfactory experience influences behavior and neural structure in subsequent generations|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.3594|journal=Nature Neuroscience|volume=17|issue=1|pages=89–96|doi=10.1038/nn.3594|issn=1546-1726|pmc=3923835}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Across development ==
The learning involved in conditioned fear, as well as the underlying neurobiology, changes dramatically from infancy, across childhood and adolescence, into adulthood and aging. Specifically, infant animals show an inability to develop fear associations, whereas their adult counterparts develop fear memories much more readily.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ganella|first=Despina E|last2=Kim|first2=Jee Hyun|date=2014-10-01|title=Developmental rodent models of fear and anxiety: from neurobiology to pharmacology|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/bph.12643|journal=British Journal of Pharmacology|volume=171|issue=20|pages=4556–4574|doi=10.1111/bph.12643|issn=1476-5381|pmc=4209932}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Florian Dombois''' (born 1966 in [[Berlin]]) is an artist who focuses on time, landforms, labilities, seismic and tectonic activity, as well as on their various representational and media formats.

Dombois studied [[geophysics]] and [[philosophy]] in [[Berlin]], [[Kiel]] and [[Hawaii]], and wrote his PhD in [[Amsterdam]] and [[Berlin]]. After that, he has developed a concept of "Art as Research" to challenge modernism in art and scientific modes of expression. His oeuvre includes spatial and sound installations, but also happenings and performances. 2003-2011 he was heading the [http://www.hkb.bfh.ch/y.html  Institute for Transdisciplinarity (Y)], and was president of the research council at [http://www.hkb.bfh.ch  Berne University of the Arts]. Since 2011 he is professor at [[Zurich University of the Arts]]. In 2010 he received the [[:de:Deutscher Klangkunst-Preis|German Sound Art Prize]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7553">'''Functional contextualism''' is a modern [[philosophy of science]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2018|reason=Needs a citation from a Philosophy of Science s source.}} rooted in philosophical [[pragmatism]] and [[contextualism]]. It is most actively developed in [[behavioral science]] in general and the field of [[behavior analysis]] and contextual behavioral science in particular (see the entry for the [[Association for Contextual Behavioral Science]]). Functional contextualism serves as the basis of a theory of language known as [[relational frame theory]]&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, S.C.; Barnes-Holmes, D. &amp; Roche, B. (Eds.). (2001). ''Relational Frame Theory: A Post-Skinnerian account of human language and cognition''. New York: Plenum Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and its most prominent application, [[acceptance and commitment therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, S.C.; Strosahl, K. &amp; Wilson, K.G. (1999). ''Acceptance and Commitment Therapy: An experiential approach to behavior change''. New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an extension and contextualistic interpretation of [[B.F. Skinner]]'s [[radical behaviorism]] first delineated by [[Steven C. Hayes]] which emphasizes the importance of predicting and influencing psychological events (including thoughts, feelings, and behaviors) with precision, scope, and depth, by focusing on manipulable variables in their context.

==Contextualism==
The form of contextualism from which functional contextualism emerged is the one described by the philosopher [[Stephen C. Pepper]] in his book ''[[World Hypotheses]]: A Study in Evidence''.&lt;ref&gt;Pepper, S.C. (1942). ''World hypotheses: A study in evidence''. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, Pepper noted that philosophical systems tend to cluster around a few distinct "world hypotheses" or "[[world view]]s". Each world view is characterized by a distinctive underlying root metaphor and [[Truth#Substantive theories|truth criterion]]. Root metaphors are based on seemingly well-understood, common-sense, everyday objects or ideas, and serve as the basic analogy by which an analyst attempts to understand the world. A world view's root metaphor roughly corresponds to its [[ontological]] assumptions, or views about the nature of being or existence (e.g., whether the universe is deterministic or not). Truth criteria are inextricably linked to their root metaphors, and provide the basis for evaluating the validity of analyses. A world view's truth criterion roughly corresponds to its [[epistemological]] assumptions, or views about the nature of knowledge and truth (e.g., whether it is discovered or constructed).

The root metaphor of contextualism is the "act in context", whereby any event is interpreted as an ongoing act inseparable from its current and historical context. The truth criterion of contextualism is often dubbed "successful working", whereby the truth and meaning of an idea lies in its function or utility, not in how well it is said to mirror reality. In contextualism, an analysis is said to be true or valid insofar it as it leads to effective action, or achievement of some goal. Contextualism is Pepper's term for the philosophical [[pragmatism]] developed by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[William James]], [[John Dewey]], and others.

===Varieties of contextualism===
Analytic goals are vitally important to the contextualistic world view. This is because the analytic tools of contextualism—its root metaphor and truth criterion—both hinge on the purpose of the analysis, and neither can be mounted effectively without a clearly specified analytic goal. The pragmatic truth criterion of "successful working" is rendered meaningless in an analysis without an explicit goal because "success" can only be measured in relation to the achievement of some objective.&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, J. (1953). ''Essays in experimental logic''. New York: Dover (Original work published 1916)&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, the root metaphor of the "act-in-context" is rendered meaningless in an analysis without an explicit goal because there would be no basis on which to restrict the analysis to a subset of the infinite expanse of the act's historical and environmental context.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford, E.V. &amp; Hayes, S.C. (1999). Functional contextualism: A pragmatic philosophy for behavioral science. In W. O'Donohue &amp; R. Kitchener (Eds.), ''Handbook of behaviorism'' (pp. 285–327). San Diego: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Without a clear analytic goal, the contextualist could analyze the endless context of an act in perpetuity, without ever knowing when the analysis was complete or good enough to be deemed "true" or "useful". It is very difficult for a contextualist without an explicit goal to construct or share knowledge.

Contextualists can, and do, adopt different analytic goals, and the many different varieties of contextualism can be distinguished by their goals.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, S.C. (1993). Analytic goals and the varieties of scientific contextualism. In S.C. Hayes, L.J. Hayes, H.W. Reese &amp; T.R. Sarbin (Eds.), ''Varieties of scientific contextualism'' (pp. 11–27). Reno, NV: Context Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on their overarching analytic goals, contextualistic theories can be divided into two general categories: "descriptive contextualism" and "functional contextualism".

====Descriptive contextualism====
Descriptive contextualists seek to understand the complexity and richness of a whole event through a personal and aesthetic appreciation of its participants and features. This approach reveals a strong adherence to the root metaphor of contextualism and can be likened to the enterprise of [[history]], in which stories of the past are constructed in an attempt to understand whole events. The knowledge constructed by the descriptive contextualist is personal, ephemeral, specific, and spatiotemporally restricted.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, E.K. (1993). Contextualism, historiography, and the history of behavior analysis. In S.C. Hayes, L.J. Hayes, H.W. Reese &amp; T.R. Sarbin (Eds.), ''Varieties of scientific contextualism'' (pp. 137-165). Reno, NV: Context Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Like a [[historical narrative]], it is knowledge that reflects an in-depth personal understanding of a particular event that occurred (or is occurring) at a particular time and place. Most forms of contextualism, including [[social constructionism]], [[dramaturgy]], [[hermeneutics]], and narrative approaches, are instances of descriptive contextualism.

====Functional contextualism====
Functional contextualists, on the other hand, seek to predict and influence events using empirically based concepts and rules. This approach reveals a strong adherence to contextualism's extremely practical truth criterion and can be likened to the enterprise of [[science]] or [[engineering]], in which general rules and principles are used to predict and influence events. Rules or theories that do not contribute to the achievement of one's practical goals are ignored or rejected. Knowledge constructed by the functional contextualist is general, abstract, and spatiotemporally unrestricted.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, E. J. (2006). Constructing a pragmatic science of learning and instruction with functional contextualism. ''Educational Technology Research &amp; Development, 54'' (1), 5-36.&lt;/ref&gt; Like a scientific principle, it is knowledge that is likely to be applicable to all (or many) similar such events, regardless of time or place.

The '''fundamental theorem of calculus''' is a [[theorem]] that links the concept of [[derivative|differentiating]] a [[function (mathematics)|function]] with the concept of [[integral|integrating]] a function. 

The first part of the theorem, sometimes called the '''first fundamental theorem of calculus''', states that one of the [[antiderivative]]s (also called ''indefinite integral''), say ''F'', of some function ''f'' may be obtained as the integral of ''f'' with a variable bound of integration. This implies the existence of [[antiderivative]]s for [[continuous function]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Spivak|first=Michael|year=1980|title=Calculus|edition=2nd|publication-place=Houston, Texas|publisher=Publish or Perish Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, the second part of the theorem, sometimes called the '''second fundamental theorem of calculus''', states that the integral of a function ''f'' over some interval can be computed by using any one, say ''F'', of its infinitely many [[antiderivative]]s. This part of the theorem has key practical applications, because explicitly finding the antiderivative of a function by [[symbolic integration]] avoids [[numerical integration]] to compute integrals. This provides generally a better numerical accuracy.

==History==
{{See also|History of calculus}}

The fundamental theorem of calculus relates differentiation and integration, showing that these two operations are essentially inverses of one another. Before the discovery of this theorem, it was not recognized that these two operations were related. Ancient [[Greek mathematics|Greek mathematicians]] knew how to compute area via [[infinitesimals]], an operation that we would now call [[Integral|integration]]. The origins of [[Derivative|differentiation]] likewise predate the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus by hundreds of years;  for example, in the fourteenth century the notions of ''continuity'' of functions and ''motion'' were studied by the [[Oxford Calculators]] and other scholars. The historical relevance of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is not the ability to calculate these operations, but the realization that the two seemingly distinct operations (calculation of geometric areas, and calculation of velocities) are actually closely related.

The first published statement and proof of a rudimentary form of the fundamental theorem, strongly geometric in character,&lt;ref name=GregoryGeometry&gt;{{cite journal| last=Malet|first=Antoni|title=James Gregorie on tangents and the "Taylor" rule for series expansions| publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer-Verlag]]|year=1993|journal=[[Archive for History of Exact Sciences]]|doi=10.1007/BF00375656|quote=Gregorie's thought, on the other hand, belongs to a conceptual framework strongly geometrical in character. (page 137)}}&lt;/ref&gt; was by [[James Gregory (mathematician)|James Gregory]] (1638–1675).&lt;ref&gt;
See, e.g., Marlow Anderson, Victor J. Katz, Robin J. Wilson, ''Sherlock Holmes in Babylon and Other Tales of Mathematical History'', Mathematical Association of America, 2004, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BKRE5AjRM3AC&amp;pg=PA114 p.&amp;nbsp;114].
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=geometriae&gt;{{cite book| last=Gregory | first=James | title=Geometriae Pars Universalis | url=https://archive.org/details/gregory_universalis | publisher= Patavii: typis heredum Pauli Frambotti | year=1668 | location=[[Museo Galileo]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Isaac Barrow]] (1630–1677) proved a more generalized version of the theorem,&lt;ref name=BarrowGeometricLectures&gt;{{cite book| last1=Child | first1= James Mark | last2=Barrow | first2=Isaac| title= The Geometrical Lectures of Isaac Barrow | year=1916 | url=https://archive.org/details/geometricallectu00barruoft| publisher= Chicago: [[Open Court Publishing Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; while his student [[Isaac Newton]] (1642–1727) completed the development of the surrounding mathematical theory. [[Gottfried Leibniz]] (1646–1716) systematized the knowledge into a calculus for infinitesimal quantities and introduced the notation used today.

==Geometric meaning==
[[File:FTC_geometric.svg|500px|thumb|right|The area shaded in red stripes is close to ''h'' times ''f''(''x''). Alternatively, if the function ''A''(''x'') were known, this area would be exactly {{nowrap|''A''(''x'' + ''h'') − ''A''(''x'').}} These two values are approximately equal, particularly for small ''h''.]]
For a continuous function {{nowrap|''y'' {{=}} ''f''(''x'')}} whose graph is plotted as a curve, each value of ''x'' has a corresponding area function ''A''(''x''), representing the area beneath the curve between 0 and ''x''. The function ''A''(''x'') may not be known, but it is given that it represents the area under the curve.

The area under the curve between ''x'' and {{nowrap|''x'' + ''h''}} could be computed by finding the area between 0 and {{nowrap|''x'' + ''h'',}} then subtracting the area between 0 and ''x''. In other words, the area of this “strip” would be {{nowrap|''A''(''x'' + ''h'') − ''A''(''x'')}}.

There is another way to ''estimate'' the area of this same strip. As shown in the accompanying figure, ''h'' is multiplied by ''f''(''x'') to find the area of a rectangle that is approximately the same size as this strip. So:

:&lt;math&gt;A(x+h)-A(x) \approx f(x) \cdot h&lt;/math&gt;

In fact, this estimate becomes a perfect equality if we add the red portion of the "excess" area shown in the diagram. So:

:&lt;math&gt;A(x+h)-A(x)=f(x)\cdot h+(\text{Red Excess})&lt;/math&gt;

Rearranging terms:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \frac{A(x+h)-A(x)}{h} - \frac{\text{Red Excess}}{h}&lt;/math&gt;.

As ''h'' approaches 0 in the [[limit of a function|limit]], the last fraction can be shown to go to zero.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lipman Bers|Bers, Lipman]]. ''Calculus'', pp.&amp;nbsp;180–181 (Holt, Rinehart and Winston (1976).&lt;/ref&gt; This is true because the area of the red portion of excess region is less than or equal to the area of the tiny black-bordered rectangle.  More precisely,
:&lt;math&gt;\left|f(x) - \frac{A(x+h) - A(x)}{h}\right| = \frac{|\text{Red Excess}|}{h} \le \frac{h(f(x+h_1) - f(x+h_2))}{h} = f(x+h_1) - f(x+h_2)|,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;x+h_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x+h_2&lt;/math&gt; are points where {{mvar|f}} reaches its maximum and its minimum, respectively, in  the interval {{math|[''x'', ''x'' + ''h'']}}.
By the continuity of {{math|''f''}}, the latter expression tends to zero as {{math|''h''}} does.  Therefore, the left-hand side tends to zero as {{math|''h''}} does, which implies
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{A(x+h)-A(x)}{h}.&lt;/math&gt;
This implies {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''A''′(''x'')}}. That is, the derivative of the area function ''A''(''x'') exists and is the original function ''f''(''x''); so, the area function is simply an [[antiderivative]] of the original function.  Computing the derivative of a function and “finding the area” under its curve are "opposite" operations. This is the crux of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

==Physical intuition==
Intuitively, the theorem simply states that the sum of [[infinitesimal]] changes in a quantity over time (or over some other variable) adds up to the net change in the quantity.

Imagine for example using a stopwatch to mark-off tiny increments of time as a car travels down a highway. Imagine also looking at the car's speedometer as it travels, so that at every moment you know the velocity of the car. To understand the power of this theorem, imagine also that you are not allowed to look out the window of the car, so that you have no direct evidence of how far the car has traveled.

For any tiny interval of time in the car, you could calculate how far the car has traveled in that interval by multiplying the current speed of the car times the length of that tiny interval of time. (This is because ''distance'' = ''speed'' &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; ''time''.)

Now imagine doing this instant after instant, so that for every tiny interval of time you know how far the car has traveled. In principle, you could then calculate the ''total'' distance traveled in the car (even though you've never looked out the window) by simply summing-up all those tiny distances.

:distance traveled = &lt;math&gt;\sum&lt;/math&gt; the velocity at any instant &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; a tiny interval of time

In other words,

:distance traveled = &lt;math&gt;\sum v(t) \times \Delta t&lt;/math&gt;

On the right hand side of this equation, as &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; becomes infinitesimally small, the operation of "summing up" corresponds to [[Integral|integration]]. So what we've shown is that the integral of the velocity function can be used to compute how far the car has traveled.

Now remember that the velocity function is simply the derivative of the position function. So what we have really shown is that integrating the velocity simply recovers the original position function. This is the basic idea of the theorem: that ''integration'' and ''differentiation'' are closely related operations, each essentially being the inverse of the other.

In other words, in terms of one's physical intuition, the theorem simply states that the sum of the changes in a quantity over time (such as ''position'', as calculated by multiplying ''velocity'' times ''time'') adds up to the total net change in the quantity. Or to put this more generally:
* Given a quantity &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; that changes over some variable &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, and
* Given the velocity &lt;math&gt;v(t)&lt;/math&gt; with which that quantity changes over that variable
then the idea that "distance equals speed times time" corresponds to the statement
:&lt;math&gt;dx = v(t) dt&lt;/math&gt;
meaning that one can recover the original function &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; by integrating its derivative, the velocity &lt;math&gt;v(t)&lt;/math&gt;, over &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.

==Formal statements==
There are two parts to the theorem. The first part deals with the derivative of an [[antiderivative]], while the second part deals with the relationship between antiderivatives and [[definite integral]]s.

===First part===
This part is sometimes referred to as the ''first fundamental theorem of calculus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Apostol|1967|loc=§5.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Let ''f'' be a continuous real-valued function defined on a [[Interval (mathematics)#Terminology|closed interval]] [''a'', ''b'']. Let ''F'' be the function defined, for all ''x'' in [''a'', ''b''], by
:&lt;math&gt;F(x) = \int_a^x\!f(t)\, dt.&lt;/math&gt;

Then, ''F'' is uniformly continuous on [''a'', ''b''], differentiable on the open interval {{nowrap|(''a'', ''b''),}} and

:&lt;math&gt;F'(x) = f(x)\,&lt;/math&gt;

for all ''x'' in (''a'', ''b'').

===Corollary===
[[File:Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus_(animation_).gif|thumb|Fundamental theorem of calculus (animation)]]

The fundamental theorem is often employed to compute the definite integral of a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; for which an antiderivative &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is known.  Specifically, if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a real-valued continuous function on &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is an antiderivative of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; then

:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(t)\, dt = F(b)-F(a).&lt;/math&gt;

The corollary assumes [[Continuous function|continuity]] on the whole interval. This result is strengthened slightly in the following part of the theorem.

===Second part===
This part is sometimes referred to as the second fundamental theorem of calculus&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Apostol|1967|loc=§5.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the '''Newton–Leibniz axiom'''.

Let &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; be a real-valued function on a [[closed interval]] &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; an antiderivative of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;F'(x) = f(x).&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is [[Riemann integrable]] on &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; then

:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x)\,dx = F(b) - F(a).&lt;/math&gt;

The second part is somewhat stronger than the corollary because it does not assume that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous.

When an antiderivative &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; exists, then there are infinitely many antiderivatives for &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, obtained by adding  an arbitrary constant to &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. Also, by the first part of the theorem, antiderivatives of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; always exist when &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous.

==Proof of the first part==
For a given ''f''(''t''), define the function ''F''(''x'') as
:&lt;math&gt;F(x) = \int_a^x f(t) \,dt.&lt;/math&gt;

For any two numbers ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + Δ''x'' in [''a'', ''b''], we have
:&lt;math&gt;F(x_1) = \int_{a}^{x_1} f(t) \,dt&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;F(x_1 + \Delta x) = \int_a^{x_1 + \Delta x} f(t) \,dt.&lt;/math&gt;

Subtracting the two equalities gives
:&lt;math&gt;F(x_1 + \Delta x) - F(x_1) = \int_a^{x_1 + \Delta x} f(t) \,dt - \int_a^{x_1} f(t) \,dt. \qquad (1)&lt;/math&gt;

It can be shown that
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{a}^{x_1} f(t) \,dt + \int_{x_1}^{x_1 + \Delta x} f(t) \,dt = \int_a^{x_1 + \Delta x} f(t) \,dt. &lt;/math&gt;
:(The sum of the areas of two adjacent regions is equal to the area of both regions combined.)
Manipulating this equation gives
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{a}^{x_1 + \Delta x} f(t) \,dt - \int_{a}^{x_1} f(t) \,dt = \int_{x_1}^{x_1 + \Delta x} f(t) \,dt. &lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the above into (1) results in
:&lt;math&gt;F(x_1 + \Delta x) - F(x_1) = \int_{x_1}^{x_1 + \Delta x} f(t) \,dt. \qquad (2)&lt;/math&gt;

According to the [[mean value theorem]] for integration, there exists a real number &lt;math&gt;c \in [x_1, x_1 + \Delta x]&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{x_1}^{x_1 + \Delta x} f(t) \,dt = f(c)\cdot \Delta x.&lt;/math&gt;

To keep the notation simple, we write just &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, but one should keep in mind that, for a given function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, the value of &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; depends on &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; and on &lt;math&gt;\Delta x,&lt;/math&gt; but is always confined to the interval  &lt;math&gt; [x_1, x_1 + \Delta x]&lt;/math&gt;.
Substituting the above into (2) we get
:&lt;math&gt;F(x_1 + \Delta x) - F(x_1) = f(c)\cdot \Delta x.&lt;/math&gt;

Dividing both sides by &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; gives
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{F(x_1 + \Delta x) - F(x_1)}{\Delta x} = f(c).&lt;/math&gt;
:The expression on the left side of the equation is Newton's [[difference quotient]] for ''F'' at ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.

Take the limit as &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; → 0 on both sides of the equation.
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{F(x_1 + \Delta x) - F(x_1)}{\Delta x} = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} f(c). &lt;/math&gt;

The expression on the left side of the equation is the definition of the derivative of ''F'' at ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;F'(x_1) = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} f(c). \qquad (3) &lt;/math&gt;

To find the other limit, we use the [[squeeze theorem]]. The number ''c'' is in the interval [''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + Δ''x''], so ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''c'' ≤ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + Δ''x''.

Also, &lt;math&gt;\lim_{\Delta x \to 0} x_1 = x_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lim_{\Delta x \to 0} x_1 + \Delta x = x_1.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, according to the squeeze theorem,
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\Delta x \to 0} c = x_1.&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting into (3), we get
:&lt;math&gt;F'(x_1) = \lim_{c \to x_1} f(c).&lt;/math&gt;

The function ''f'' is continuous at ''c'', so the limit can be taken inside the function. Therefore, we get
:&lt;math&gt;F'(x_1) = f(x_1).&lt;/math&gt;
which completes the proof.

&lt;small&gt;(Leithold ''et al.'', 1996)&lt;/small&gt; &lt;small&gt; (a rigorous proof can be found http://www.imomath.com/index.php?options=438)&lt;/small&gt;

==Proof of the corollary==
Suppose ''F'' is an antiderivative of ''f'', with ''f'' continuous on {{nowrap|[''a'', ''b''].}} Let

: &lt;math&gt;G(x) = \int_a^x f(t)\, dt&lt;/math&gt;.

By the ''first part'' of the theorem, we know ''G'' is also an antiderivative of ''f''. Since ''F' - G' = 0'' the mean value theorem implies that ''F - G'' is a constant function, i. e. there is a number ''c'' such that {{nowrap|''G''(''x'') {{=}} ''F''(''x'') + ''c''}}, for all ''x'' in {{nowrap|[''a'', ''b''].}}  Letting {{nowrap|''x'' {{=}} ''a''}}, we have

:&lt;math&gt;F(a) + c = G(a) = \int_a^a f(t)\, dt = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

which means {{nowrap|''c'' {{=}} − ''F''(''a'').}} In other words, {{nowrap|''G''(''x'') {{=}} ''F''(''x'') − ''F''(''a'')}}, and so

:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x)\, dx = G(b) = F(b) - F(a).&lt;/math&gt;

==Proof of the second part==
This is a limit proof by [[Riemann integral|Riemann sums]].
Let ''f'' be (Riemann) integrable on the interval {{nowrap|[''a'', ''b''],}} and let ''f'' admit an antiderivative ''F'' on {{nowrap|[''a'', ''b''].}}  Begin with the quantity {{nowrap|''F''(''b'') − ''F''(''a'')}}.  Let there be numbers ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;
such that

:&lt;math&gt;a = x_0 &lt; x_1 &lt; x_2 &lt; \cdots &lt; x_{n-1} &lt; x_n = b. &lt;/math&gt;

It follows that

:&lt;math&gt;F(b) - F(a) = F(x_n) - F(x_0). &lt;/math&gt;

Now, we add each ''F''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) along with its additive inverse, so that the resulting quantity is equal:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
F(b) - F(a)
&amp;= F(x_n) + [-F(x_{n-1}) + F(x_{n-1})] + \cdots + [-F(x_1) + F(x_1)] - F(x_0) \\
&amp;= [F(x_n) - F(x_{n-1})] + [F(x_{n-1}) - F(x_{n-2})] + \cdots + [F(x_2) - F(x_1)] + [F(x_1) - F(x_0)].
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The above quantity can be written as the following sum:

:&lt;math&gt;F(b) - F(a) = \sum_{i=1}^n \,[F(x_i) - F(x_{i-1})]. \qquad (1)&lt;/math&gt;

Next, we employ the [[mean value theorem]].  Stated briefly,

Let ''F'' be continuous on the closed interval [''a'', ''b''] and differentiable on the open interval (''a'', ''b''). Then there exists some ''c'' in (''a'', ''b'') such that

:&lt;math&gt;F'(c) = \frac{F(b) - F(a)}{b - a}.&lt;/math&gt;

It follows that

:&lt;math&gt;F'(c)(b - a) = F(b) - F(a). &lt;/math&gt;

The function ''F'' is differentiable on the interval {{nowrap|[''a'', ''b''];}} therefore, it is also differentiable and continuous on each interval {{nowrap|[''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''−1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;]}}.  According to the mean value theorem (above),

:&lt;math&gt;F(x_i) - F(x_{i-1}) = F'(c_i)(x_i - x_{i-1}). &lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the above into (1), we get

:&lt;math&gt;F(b) - F(a) = \sum_{i=1}^n \,[F'(c_i)(x_i - x_{i-1})].&lt;/math&gt;

The assumption implies &lt;math&gt;F'(c_i) = f(c_i).&lt;/math&gt;  Also, &lt;math&gt;x_i - x_{i-1}&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed as &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; of partition &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;F(b) - F(a) = \sum_{i=1}^n \,[f(c_i)(\Delta x_i)]. \qquad (2)&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Riemann integral irregular.gif|frame|right|A converging sequence of Riemann sums. The number in the upper left is the total area of the blue rectangles. They converge to the definite integral of the function.]]

We are describing the area of a rectangle, with the width times the height, and we are adding the areas together.  Each rectangle, by virtue of the [[mean value theorem]], describes an approximation of the curve section it is drawn over. Also &lt;math&gt;\Delta x_i&lt;/math&gt; need not be the same for all values of ''i'', or in other words that the width of the rectangles can differ.  What we have to do is approximate the curve with ''n'' rectangles.  Now, as the size of the partitions get smaller and ''n'' increases, resulting in more partitions to cover the space, we get closer and closer to the actual area of the curve.

By taking the limit of the expression as the norm of the partitions approaches zero, we arrive at the [[Riemann integral]]. We know that this limit exists because ''f'' was assumed to be integrable. That is, we take the limit as the largest of the partitions approaches zero in size, so that all other partitions are smaller and the number of partitions approaches infinity.

So, we take the limit on both sides of (2). This gives us

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\| \Delta x_i \| \to 0} F(b) - F(a) = \lim_{\| \Delta x_i \| \to 0} \sum_{i=1}^n \,[f(c_i)(\Delta x_i)].&lt;/math&gt;

Neither ''F''(''b'') nor ''F''(''a'') is dependent on &lt;math&gt;\|\Delta x_i\|&lt;/math&gt;, so the limit on the left side remains {{nowrap|''F''(''b'') − ''F''(''a'').}}

:&lt;math&gt;F(b) - F(a) = \lim_{\| \Delta x_i \| \to 0} \sum_{i=1}^n \,[f(c_i)(\Delta x_i)].&lt;/math&gt;

The expression on the right side of the equation defines the integral over ''f'' from ''a'' to ''b''. Therefore, we obtain

:&lt;math&gt;F(b) - F(a) = \int_a^b f(x)\,dx,&lt;/math&gt;

which completes the proof.

It almost looks like the first part of the theorem follows directly from the second. That is, suppose ''G'' is an antiderivative of ''f''. Then by the second theorem, &lt;math&gt;G(x) - G(a) = \int_a^x f(t) \, dt&lt;/math&gt;. Now, suppose &lt;math&gt;F(x) = \int_a^x f(t)\, dt\ = G(x) - G(a)&lt;/math&gt;. Then ''F'' has the same derivative as ''G'', and therefore {{nowrap|''F''′ {{=}} ''f''}}. This argument only works, however, if we already know that ''f'' has an antiderivative, and the only way we know that all continuous functions have antiderivatives is by the first part of the Fundamental Theorem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Spivak|first=Michael|year=1980|title=Calculus|edition=2nd|publication-place=Houston, Texas|publisher=Publish or Perish Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, if {{nowrap|''f''(''x'') {{=}} e&lt;sup&gt;−''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,}} then ''f'' has an antiderivative, namely

:&lt;math&gt;G(x) = \int_0^x f(t) \, dt&lt;/math&gt;

and there is no simpler expression for this function.  It is therefore important not to interpret the second part of the theorem as the definition of the integral.  Indeed, there are many functions that are integrable but lack elementary antiderivatives, and discontinuous functions can be integrable but lack any antiderivatives at all.  Conversely, many functions that have antiderivatives are not Riemann integrable (see [[Volterra's function]]).

==Examples==
As an example, suppose the following is to be calculated:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_2^5 x^2\, dx. &lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;f(x) = x^2 &lt;/math&gt; and we can use &lt;math&gt;F(x) = \frac{x^3}{3} &lt;/math&gt; as the antiderivative. Therefore:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_2^5 x^2\, dx = F(5) - F(2) =  \frac{5^3}{3} - \frac{2^3}{3} = \frac{125}{3} - \frac{8}{3} = \frac{117}{3} = 39.&lt;/math&gt;

Or, more generally, suppose that

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \int_0^x t^3\, dt &lt;/math&gt;
is to be calculated. Here, &lt;math&gt;f(t) = t^3 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F(t) = \frac{t^4}{4} &lt;/math&gt; can be used as the antiderivative. Therefore:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \int_0^x t^3\, dt = \frac{d}{dx} F(x) - \frac{d}{dx} F(0) = \frac{d}{dx} \frac{x^4}{4} = x^3.&lt;/math&gt;

Or, equivalently,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \int_0^x t^3\, dt = f(x) \frac{dx}{dx} - f(0) \frac{d0}{dx} = x^3.&lt;/math&gt;

As a theoretical example, the theorem can be used to prove that
:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x) dx=\int_a^c f(x) dx+\int_c^b f(x) dx.&lt;/math&gt; 

Since, 
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\int_a^b f(x) dx &amp;= F(b)-F(a), \\
\int_a^c f(x) dx &amp;=F(c)-F(a), \text{ and } \\
\int_c^b f(x) dx &amp;=F(b)-F(c), 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt; 

the result follows from, 
:&lt;math&gt;F(b)-F(a)=F(c)-F(a)+F(b)-F(c).&lt;/math&gt;

==Generalizations==
We don't need to assume continuity of ''f'' on the whole interval.  Part I of the theorem then says: if ''f'' is any [[Lebesgue integration|Lebesgue integrable]] function on {{nowrap|[''a'', ''b'']}} and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a number in {{nowrap|[''a'', ''b'']}} such that ''f'' is continuous at ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, then

:&lt;math&gt;F(x) = \int_a^x f(t)\, dt&lt;/math&gt;

is differentiable for {{nowrap|''x'' {{=}} ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} with {{nowrap|''F''′(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) {{=}} ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;).}} We can relax the conditions on ''f'' still further and suppose that it is merely locally integrable.  In that case, we can conclude that the function ''F'' is differentiable [[almost everywhere]] and {{nowrap|''F''′(''x'') {{=}} ''f''(''x'')}} almost everywhere. On the [[real line]] this statement is equivalent to [[Lebesgue differentiation theorem|Lebesgue's differentiation theorem]].  These results remain true for the Henstock–Kurzweil integral, which allows a larger class of integrable functions {{harv|Bartle|2001|loc=Thm. 4.11}}.

In higher dimensions Lebesgue's differentiation theorem generalizes the Fundamental theorem of calculus by stating that for almost every ''x'', the average value of a function ''f'' over a ball of radius ''r'' centered at ''x'' tends to ''f''(''x'') as ''r'' tends to 0.

Part II of the theorem is true for any Lebesgue integrable function ''f'', which has an antiderivative ''F'' (not all integrable functions do, though).  In other words, if a real function ''F'' on {{nowrap|[''a'', ''b'']}} admits a derivative ''f''(''x'') at ''every'' point ''x'' of {{nowrap|[''a'', ''b'']}} and if this derivative ''f'' is Lebesgue integrable on {{nowrap|[''a'', ''b''],}} then

:&lt;math&gt;F(b) - F(a) = \int_a^b f(t) \, dt.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rudin|1987|loc=th. 7.21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This result may fail for continuous functions ''F'' that admit a derivative ''f''(''x'') at almost every point ''x'', as the example of the [[Cantor function]] shows. However, if ''F'' is [[Absolute continuity|absolutely continuous]], it admits a derivative ''F′''(''x'') at almost every point ''x'', and moreover ''F′'' is integrable, with {{nowrap|''F''(''b'') − ''F''(''a'')}} equal to the integral of ''F′'' on {{nowrap|[''a'', ''b''].}} Conversely, if ''f'' is any integrable function, then ''F'' as given in the first formula will be absolutely continuous with ''F′'' = ''f'' a.e.

The conditions of this theorem may again be relaxed by considering the integrals involved as [[Henstock–Kurzweil integral]]s.  Specifically, if a continuous function ''F''(''x'') admits a derivative ''f''(''x'') at all but countably many points, then ''f''(''x'') is Henstock–Kurzweil integrable and {{nowrap|''F''(''b'') − ''F''(''a'')}} is equal to the integral of ''f'' on {{nowrap|[''a'', ''b''].}}  The difference here is that the integrability of ''f'' does not need to be assumed. {{harv|Bartle|2001|loc=Thm. 4.7}}

The version of [[Taylor's theorem]], which expresses the error term as an integral, can be seen as a generalization of the fundamental theorem.

There is a version of the theorem for [[complex number|complex]] functions: suppose ''U'' is an open set in '''C''' and {{nowrap|''f'' : ''U'' → '''C'''}} is a function that has a [[holomorphic function|holomorphic]] antiderivative ''F'' on ''U''. Then for every curve {{nowrap|γ : [''a'', ''b''] → ''U'',}} the [[curve integral]] can be computed as

:&lt;math&gt;\int_\gamma f(z) \,dz = F(\gamma(b)) - F(\gamma(a)).&lt;/math&gt;

The fundamental theorem can be generalized to curve and surface integrals in higher dimensions and on [[manifold]]s. One such generalization offered by the [[calculus of moving surfaces]] is the [[time evolution of integrals]]. The most familiar extensions of the fundamental theorem of calculus in higher dimensions are the [[divergence theorem]] and the [[gradient theorem]].

One of the most powerful generalizations in this direction is [[Stokes' theorem]] (sometimes known as the fundamental theorem of multivariable calculus):&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_on_Manifolds_(book)|title=Calculus on Manifolds|last=Spivak|first=M.|publisher=W. A. Benjamin|year=1965|isbn=978-0-8053-9021-6|location=New York|pages=124–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Let ''M'' be an oriented [[piecewise]] [[Infinitely differentiable|smooth]] [[manifold]] of [[dimension]] ''n'' and let &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; be a smooth [[compactly supported]] [[differential form|(''n''–1)-form]] on ''M''. If ∂''M'' denotes the [[manifold|boundary]] of ''M'' given its induced [[Orientation (mathematics)|orientation]], then

:&lt;math&gt;\int_M d\omega = \int_{\partial M} \omega.&lt;/math&gt;

Here ''d'' is the [[exterior derivative]], which is defined using the manifold structure only.

The theorem is often used in situations where ''M'' is an embedded oriented submanifold of some bigger manifold (e.g. '''R'''''&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;'') on which the form &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is defined.

'''Green Monday''' (GM) is a startup that makes low-carbon and sustainable living simple. Founded in 2012 in Hong Kong, GM is aimed at tackling [[climate change]] and ensuring [[food security]]. It is selected by FAST COMPANY magazine to be among China's Top 50 Most Innovative Companies of Year 2014.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} In 2015, Green Monday launched “Green Common” in Hong Kong to empower the community with food choices that are sustainable, innovative, wholesome and responsible.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Green Monday cites references from the [[United Nations]] that livestock industry and factory farming are the number one contributor of the world's [[carbon footprint]].  Meat production also consumes a disproportionate amount of water and land resources, which directly jeopardizes [[food security]] and [[environmental sustainability]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

As of 2014, results of a survey by market research company Ipsos showed that 1.6 million Hong Kong people, or 23% of the city's total population, embrace "Green Monday" - an increase of 18% from 2012,&lt;ref name="China"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/hkedition/2014-11/25/content_18970851.htm|title='Green Monday' backed by 1.6m fans|publisher=Chinadaily.com.cn|accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and over 1,000 restaurants in Hong Kong are offering their menus.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==History==
Green Monday started to grow beyond Hong Kong in 2014. Events that marked their international recognition and growth include:  
* The [[University of Columbia]] became the first university in the US to launch Green Monday on their campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HQew3aExHc|title=Green Monday at Columbia University!|work=YouTube|accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Fast Company (magazine)]] named Green Monday among China's Top 50 Most Innovative Companies of Year 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fastcompany.cn/go.php?m=content&amp;c=index&amp;a=show&amp;catid=17&amp;id=2072|title=快公司中文网|publisher=Fastcompany.cn|accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The US Consulate of Hong Kong, the [[American Humane Society]] and the Italian Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong became Green Monday's partners.&lt;ref name="China"/&gt;
* Green Monday was launched at the [[Washington University in St. Louis]] in January 2015, becoming the second university in the US to join the program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sustainability.wustl.edu/campus-operations/sustainable-dining/green-monday/|title=Sustainable Dining, Green Monday|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Green Monday's School Program has been sponsored by a local bank Charitable Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bochk.com/ir/pdf/bochold/2013annual_report/ch14_e.pdf|format=PDF|title=Local Bank Annual Report 2013|publisher=Bochk.com|accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, More than 800 schools with about 600,000 students from kindergarten to university in Hong Kong pledged to observe "Green Monday".&lt;ref name="China"/&gt; From November 2012 to June 2013, the average vegetarian meal order rate increased from 4% to 42%.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}
* Major universities in Hong Kong, including the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]], [[Hong Kong Baptist University]] and the [[Hong Kong University]] have also joined the Green Monday School Program.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}
* Outside Hong Kong,  [[Columbia University]], [[Washington University in St. Louis]], [[UCLA]] and [[Tsinghua University]] have launched Green Monday on their campuses.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Criticism==
Although Green Monday is often compared with another movement [[Meatless Monday]], Green Monday insists that they simply want to create more plant-based options in the market and advise against removing conventional meat options.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

'''Gun-related violence''' is violence committed with the use of a gun ([[firearm]] or [[small arm]]). Gun-related violence may or may not be considered criminal. Criminal violence includes [[homicide]] (except when and where ruled [[Justification (jurisprudence)|justifiable]]), [[assault with a deadly weapon]], and [[suicide]], or [[attempted suicide]], depending on [[jurisdiction]]. Non-criminal violence includes accidental or unintentional injury and death (except perhaps in cases of criminal negligence). Also generally included in gun violence statistics are military or para-military activities.[[File:Gun Deaths by Year, Australia, America.pdf|thumb|400px|alt=Graph showing the rate of gun deaths per capita in the United States and Australia.|Time series showing rates of gun-related deaths per capita (all sources) in the US and Australia]]

According to GunPolicy.org, 75 percent of the world's 875 million guns are civilian controlled.&lt;ref name=GIGV2013/&gt; Roughly half of these guns (48 percent) are in the United States, which has the highest rate of gun ownership in the world.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/03/americas/us-gun-statistics/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; Globally, millions are wounded and killed by the use of guns.&lt;ref name=GIGV2013&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/region |title=Global Impact of Gun Violence |last1=Alpers |first1=Philip |last2=Wilson |first2=Marcus |year=2013 |website=gunpolicy.org |publisher=Sydney School of Public Health, The University of Sydney |accessdate=February 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assault by firearm resulted in 180,000 deaths in 2013 up from 128,000 deaths in 1990.&lt;ref name=GDB2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=GBD 2013 Mortality and Causes of Death|first1=Collaborators|title=Global, regional, and national age-sex specific all-cause and cause-specific mortality for 240 causes of death, 1990–2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013|journal=Lancet|date=17 December 2014|pmid=25530442|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61682-2|pmc=4340604|volume=385|issue=9963|pages=117–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were additionally 47,000 unintentional firearm-related deaths in 2013.&lt;ref name=GDB2013/&gt;

According to the [[United Nations]], deaths from small firearms exceed that of all other weapons combined, and more die each year from gun-related violence than did in the atomic bombings of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]] combined.&lt;ref name="gunpolicy.org"&gt;http://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/region/&lt;/ref&gt; The global death toll from use of guns may number as high as 1,000 dead each day.&lt;ref name="gunpolicy.org"/&gt;

==Prevention==
{{globalize|section|date=October 2016}}
{{POV section|date=May 2018}}
A number of ideas have been proposed on how to lessen the incidence of gun-related violence.

Some propose keeping a gun at home to keep one safer. Studies show that guns in the home is associated with an increased risk of violent death in the home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dahlberg et al.|first1=Linda L.|title=Guns in the Home and Risk of a Violent Death in the Home: Findings from a National Study|journal=American Journal of Epidemiology|date=November 15, 2004|volume= 160|issue= 10|pages=929–936|doi=10.1093/aje/kwh309|url=https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/160/10/929/140858|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the FBI, gun-related violence is linked to gun ownership and is not a function or byproduct of crime.  Their study indicates that more than 90% of gun-related deaths were not part of a commission of a crime, rather they were directly related to gun ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ojjdp.gov/ojstatbb/ezashr/|title=Easy Access to the FBI's Supplementary Homicide Reports|last=Justice|first=National Center for Juvenile|website=www.ojjdp.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mike-weisser/nra-gun-deaths_b_6506884.html|title=The Gun Violence Stats the NRA Doesn't Want You to Consider|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Mother Jones'' reports that "[a] Philadelphia study found that the odds of an assault victim being shot were 4.5 times greater if he carried a gun" and that "[h]is odds of being killed were 4.2 times greater" when armed.&lt;ref name="motherjones.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/01/pro-gun-myths-fact-check|title=10 Pro-Gun Myths, Shot Down|work=Mother Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt;Others propose arming civilians to counter mass shootings. FBI research shows that between 2000 and 2013, "In 5 incidents (3.1%), the shooting ended after armed individuals who were not law enforcement personnel exchanged gunfire with the shooters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2014/september/fbi-releases-study-on-active-shooter-incidents/pdfs/a-study-of-active-shooter-incidents-in-the-u.s.-between-2000-and-2013 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 3, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210170408/https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2014/september/fbi-releases-study-on-active-shooter-incidents/pdfs/a-study-of-active-shooter-incidents-in-the-u.s.-between-2000-and-2013 |archivedate=December 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another proposal is to expand [[self defense]] laws for cases where a person is being aggressed upon, although "those policies have been linked to a 7 to 10% increase in homicides" (that is, shootings where self-defense cannot be claimed).&lt;ref name="motherjones.com"/&gt;

===Intentional homicide===
{{See also|List of countries by intentional homicide rate}}

The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) defines intentional homicide as "acts in which the perpetrator intended to cause death or serious injury by his or her actions." This excludes deaths: related to conflicts (war); caused by recklessness or negligence; or justifiable, such as in self-defense or by law enforcement in the line of duty.&lt;ref name=UNGSH2011 /&gt; A 2009 report by the Geneva Declaration using UNODC data showed that worldwide firearms were used in an average of 60 percent of all homicides.&lt;ref name="GBAV2008-CH4"&gt;{{cite book |date=September 2008  |chapter=Lethal Encounters: Non-conflict Armed Violence |chapterurl=http://www.genevadeclaration.org/fileadmin/docs/GBAV/GBAV08-CH4.pdf |title=Global Burden of Armed Violence 2008 |url=http://www.genevadeclaration.org/nc/en/measurability/global-burden-of-armed-violence/global-burden-of-armed-violence-2008.html |editor1-last= |editor1-first= |location=Geneva, Switzerland |publisher=Geneva Declaration Secretariat |pages=67–88 |isbn=978-2-8288-0101-4 |accessdate= }} by Geneva Declaration editors using UNODC data.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|67}} In the U.S. in 2011, 67 percent of homicide victims were killed by a firearm: 66 percent of single-victim homicides and 79 percent of multiple-victim homicides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&amp;iid=4863 |title=Homicide in the U.S. Known to Law Enforcement, 2011 |last1=Cooper |first1=Alexia |last2=Smith |first2=Erica L. |date=December 30, 2013 |website=bjs.gov |publisher=U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics |accessdate=February 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the United States' homicide rate was reported to be 5.0 per 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/statistics/Homicide/Globa_study_on_homicide_2011_web.pdf |format=PDF |title=Global Study on Homicide |date=2011 |website=Unodc.org |accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 Harvard study claims that in 2010 the homicide rate was about 7 times higher than that of other high-income countries, and that the US gun homicide rate was 25.2 times higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grinshteyn|first1=E|last2=Hemenway|first2=D|title=Violent Death Rates: The US Compared with Other High-income OECD Countries, 2010.|journal=The American Journal of Medicine|date=March 2016|volume=129|issue=3|pages=266–73|doi=10.1016/j.amjmed.2015.10.025|pmid=26551975}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Harvard study found that higher gun availability was strongly correlated with higher homicide rates across 26 high-income countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hemenway|first1=D|last2=Miller|first2=M|title=Firearm availability and homicide rates across 26 high-income countries.|journal=[[The Journal of Trauma]]|date=December 2000|volume=49|issue=6|pages=985–8|pmid=11130511|doi=10.1097/00005373-200012000-00001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Access to guns is associated with an increased risk of being the victim of homicide.&lt;ref name=annals/&gt; Access to firearms is not the sole contributor to increased homicide rates, however, as one study by the Southern Criminal Justice Association in 2011 found.

===Domestic violence===
{{Update|section|date=March 2014}}
Some gun control advocates say that the strongest evidence linking availability of guns to death and injury is found in [[domestic violence]] studies, often referring to those by public health policy analyst [[Arthur Kellermann]]. In response to suggestions by some that homeowners would be wise to acquire firearms for protection from home invasions, Kellermann investigated in-home homicides in three cities over five years. He found that the risk of a homicide was in fact slightly higher in homes where a handgun was present. The data showed that the risk of a [[crime of passion]] or other domestic dispute ending in a fatal injury was higher when a gun was readily available (essentially loaded and unlocked) compared to when no gun was readily available. Kellerman said this increase in mortality overshadowed any protection a gun might have deterring or defending against burglaries or invasions. He also concluded that further research of domestic violence causes and prevention are needed.&lt;ref name=NEJM329&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kellerman |first=Arthur L. |last2=Rivara |first2=Frederick P. |date=October 7, 1993 |title=Gun ownership as a risk factor for homicide in the home |url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199310073291506 |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |publisher=Massachusetts Medical Society |volume=329 |issue=15 |pages=1084–1091 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199310073291506 |pmid=8371731 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of Kellermann's study say that it is more directly a study of domestic violence than of gun ownership. Gary Kleck and others dispute the work.&lt;ref name=Suter1994&gt;{{cite journal |last=Suter |first=Edgar A. |date=March 1994  |title=Guns in the medical literature—a failure of peer review |url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/App/publications/Abstract.aspx?id=162372 |journal=Journal of the Medical Association of Georgia |publisher= |volume=83 |issue=13 |pages=133–148 |pmid=8201280 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kates |first=Don B. |last2=Schaffer |first2=Henry E. |last3=Lattimer |first3=John K. |last4=Murray |first4=George B. |last5=Cassem |first5=Edwin H. |year=1995 |editor-last=Kopel |editor-first=David B. |title=Guns: Who Should Have Them? |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/guns-who-should-have-them/oclc/32393136 |location=New York |publisher=Prometheus Books |pages=233–308 |isbn=9780879759582 |accessdate= }} in chapter "Bad Medicine: Doctors and Guns." Orig. pub. 1994 in ''Tennessee Law Review'' as "Guns and Public Health: Epidemic of Violence or Pandemic of Propaganda?"&lt;/ref&gt; Kleck says that few of the homicides that Kellermann studied were committed with guns belonging to the victim or members of his or her household, and that it was implausible that victim household gun ownership contributed to their homicide. Instead, according to Kleck, the association that Kellermann found between gun ownership and victimization reflected that people who live in more dangerous circumstances are more likely to be murdered, but also were more likely to have acquired guns for self-protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kleck |first=Gary |date=February 2001  |title=Can Owning a Gun Really Triple the Owner's Chances of being Murdered? |url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/publications/abstract.aspx?ID=187212 |journal=Homicide Studies |publisher=SAGE |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=64–77 |doi=10.1177/1088767901005001005 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Robbery and assault===
{{Update|section|date=March 2014}}
The [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] defines robbery as the theft of property by force or threat of force.  Assault is defined as a physical attack against the body of another person resulting in serious bodily injury.  In the case of gun-related violence, the definitions become more specific and include only robbery and assault committed with the use of a firearm.&lt;ref name=UNODCCrimeData&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/statistics/data.html |title=United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime: Data |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=August 29, 2013 |website=unodc.org |publisher=UNODC |accessdate=March 1, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Firearms are used in this threatening capacity four to six times more than firearms used as a means of protection in fighting crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=David Hemenway|author2=Deborah Azrael|title=The Relative Frequency of Offensive and Defensive Gun Uses: Results from a National Survey|journal=Violence and Victims|year=2000|volume=15|issue=3|pages=257–272|pmid=11200101|author3=D Hemenway}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hemenway |first=David |last2=Azrael |first2=Deborah |last3=Miller |first3=Matthew |date=2000 |title=Gun use in the United States: results from two national surveys |url=http://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/6/4/263.full |journal=Injury Prevention |publisher= |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=263–267 |doi=10.1136/ip.6.4.263 |pmid=11144624 |accessdate= |pmc=1730664}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hemenway's figures are disputed by other academics, who assert there are many more defensive uses of firearms than criminal uses.

Children exposed to gun-related violence, whether they are victims, perpetrators, or witnesses, can experience negative psychological effects over the short and long terms.

Legislation at the [[Federal government of the United States|federal]], state, and local levels has attempted to address gun violence through a variety of methods, including restricting firearms purchases by youths and other "at-risk" populations, setting waiting periods for firearm purchases, establishing [[gun buyback program]]s, law enforcement and policing strategies, stiff sentencing of gun law violators, education programs for parents and children, and community-outreach programs. Despite widespread concern about the impacts of gun violence on public health, Congress has prohibited the [[Centers for Disease Control]] (CDC) from conducting research that advocates in favor of gun control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zwillich|first1=Todd|title=Quietly, Congress extends a ban on CDC research on gun violence|url=http://www.pri.org/stories/2015-07-02/quietly-congress-extends-ban-cdc-research-gun-violence|accessdate=12 September 2015|agency=Public Radio International (PRI)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CDC has interpreted this ban to extend to all research on gun violence prevention, and so has not funded any research on this subject since 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rubin|first1=Rita|title=Tale of 2 Agencies: CDC Avoids Gun Violence Research But NIH Funds It|journal=JAMA|date=26 April 2016|volume=315|issue=16|pages=1689–91|doi=10.1001/jama.2016.1707|pmid=27050067}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gun-related violence in Australia ==

=== Port Arthur ===
[[File:Stop Gun Violence Sad Face Sign (4573522770).jpg|thumb]]
The Port Arthur massacre of 1996 horrified the Australian public. The gunman opened fire on shop owners and tourists, killing 35 people and wounding 23. This massacre, kick started Australia’s laws against guns. The Prime Minister at that time, John Howard, proposed a gun law that prevented the public from having all semi-automatic rifles, all semi-automatic and pump-action shotguns, in addition to a tightly restrictive system of licensing and ownership controls.

The government also bought back guns from people. In 1996–2003 it was estimated they bought back and destroyed nearly 1 million firearms. By the end of 1996, whilst Australia was still reeling from the Port Arthur massacre, the gun law was fully in place. Since then, the number of deaths related to gun-related violence dwindled almost every year. In 1979 six hundred and eighty-five people&lt;ref&gt;Kreisfeld, Renate. 2006. ‘Australia Revised Firearm Deaths 1979–2003.’ ''National Injury Surveillance Unit / NISU''. Adelaide: Research Centre for Injury Studies, Flinders University of South Australia. 1 March&lt;/ref&gt; died due to gun violence, and in 1996 it was five hundred and sixteen. The numbers continue to drop, however they were declining also before the gun law was in place.&lt;ref&gt;GunPolicy.org. 2016. ‘Calculated Numbers of Gun Deaths - Australia.’ ''Causes of Death, Australia, 2014''; 3303.0, Table 1.2 (Chapter XX). Canberra: Australian Bureau of Statistics. 14 March.) 
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sydney Siege ===
On the Australia's most mediated gun violence-related incident since Port Arthur, was the [[2014 Sydney hostage crisis|2014 Sydney Hostage Crisis]]. On 15–16 December 2014, a lone gunman, [[Man Haron Monis]], held hostage 17 customers and employees of a Lindt chocolate café. The perpetrator was on bail at the time, and had previously been convicted of a range of offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-12-15/sydney-siege-what-we-know/5967610|title=Sydney siege: What we do and don't know|date=2014-12-15|language=en-AU|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/australia/11295658/Victims-of-Sydney-siege-hailed-as-heroes-after-they-die-protecting-hostages.html|title=Victims of Sydney siege hailed as heroes after they die protecting hostages|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year in August, the New South Wales Government tightened the laws of bail and illegal firearms, creating a new offence for the possession of a stolen firearm, with a maximum of 14 years imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.judcom.nsw.gov.au/publications/benchbks/sentencing/firearms_and_prohibited_weapons_offences.html|title=Firearms and prohibited weapons offences|website=www.judcom.nsw.gov.au|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sweden witnessed a steep increase in gun violence in males aged 15 to 29 in the two decades prior to 2018, in addition to a rising trend in gun violence there was also a high rate of gun violence in Sweden compared to other countries in [[Western Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sturup|first=Joakim|last2=Rostami|first2=Amir|last3=Mondani|first3=Hernan|last4=Gerell|first4=Manne|last5=Sarnecki|first5=Jerzy|last6=Edling|first6=Christofer|date=2018-05-07|title=Increased Gun Violence Among Young Males in Sweden: a Descriptive National Survey and International Comparison|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10610-018-9387-0|journal=European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research|language=en|volume=|pages=1–14 / Conclusions|doi=10.1007/s10610-018-9387-0|issn=0928-1371|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a report published by academic researchers in 2017, shooting incidents with fatal outcomes are about 4 to 5 times as common in Sweden compared to neighbouring countries such as [[Germany]] and [[Norway]] when taking population size into account.

'''HINDRAF''' or '''Hindu Rights Action Force''' ({{lang-ms|Barisan Bertindak Hak-Hak Hindu}}, [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: இந்து உரிமைகள் போராட்டக் குழு, [[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 兴权 )  with its slogan of ''People's Power'' (மக்கள் சக்தி translated as ''Makkal Sakthi'') began as a coalition of 30 Hindu [[non-governmental organisation]]s committed to the [[Hinduism in Malaysia|preservation of Hindu community]] rights and heritage in a multiracial [[Malaysia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.financialexpress.com/latest_full_story.php?content_id=128069 Hindu group protests "temple cleansing" in Malaysia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704022731/http://www.financialexpress.com/latest_full_story.php?content_id=128069 |date=4 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/HA14Ae04.html|publisher=Asia Times |title=Southeast Asia news and business from Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam |accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
HINDRAF has made a major impact to the political landscape of Malaysia in staging the [[2007 HINDRAF rally]]. In late 2007, several prominent members of the HINDRAF  were arrested, some on charges of [[sedition]]; following an enormous rally organised by HINDRAF in November. The charges were dismissed by the courts. Five people have since been detained without trial under the [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|Internal Security Act]]. The group has over the last two years developed a broader political program to preserve and to push for equal rights and opportunities for the minority Indians. It has been successful in continuing to focus attention on the racist aspects of the Malaysian Government policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/newsMaps/idUSKLR29657920071214 | work=Reuters | title=Malaysia's Anwar condemns use of security law | date=14 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Between April to May 2006, several legal Hindu temples were demolished by city hall authorities in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malaysiakini.com/opinionsfeatures/52600 Temple row - a dab of sensibility please], ''malaysiakini.com''&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 April 2006, the Malaimel Sri Selva Kaliamman Temple in Kuala Lumpur was reduced to rubble after the city hall sent in bulldozers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gatago.com/talk/politics/mideast/12428067.html Muslims Destroy Century-Old Hindu Temple] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061104235008/http://www.gatago.com/talk/politics/mideast/12428067.html |date=4 November 2006 }}, ''gatago.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hindu Rights Action Force or HINDRAF, a coalition of several NGO's, have protested these demolitions by lodging complaints with the [[Prime Minister of Malaysia]] but with no response.&lt;ref name="Finexp"/&gt; Many Hindu advocacy groups have protested what they allege is a systematic plan of temple cleansing in Malaysia. The official reason given by the Malaysian government has been that the temples were built illegally. However, several of the temples are centuries old.&lt;ref name="Finexp"&gt;[http://www.financialexpress.com/latest_full_story.php?content_id=128069 "Hindu group protests 'temple cleansing' in Malaysia"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704022731/http://www.financialexpress.com/latest_full_story.php?content_id=128069 |date=4 July 2007 }}, ''Financial Express''&lt;/ref&gt;
According to a lawyer for HINDRAF, a [[Hindu temple]] is demolished in Malaysia once every three weeks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://in.reuters.com/article/topNews/idINIndia-30397720071108?pageNumber=1 Malaysia ethnic Indians in uphill fight on religion] Reuters India - 8 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrests in October 2007===
On 30 October, four HINDRAF Group fellows and human rights, namely [[M. Manoharan]], [[P. Uthayakumar]], [[Waytha Moorthy Ponnusamy|P. Waytha Moorthy]] and V. Ganabathirau, were arrested and detained for taking part in the [[2007 HINDRAF demonstration]] against the demolishing of a Hindu shrine in [[Kuala Lumpur]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.policewatchmalaysia.com/index.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1194230687&amp;archive=&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=5&amp; "4 HINDRAF Founding Lawyers Arrested"]&lt;/ref&gt; However, they were acquitted due to a lack of evidence of incitement and sedition.

===Human rights forum===
A series of peaceful weekend forums were organised throughout Malaysia to increase the awareness of [[Persecution of Hindus|Hindu human rights]] by HINDRAF. A previous forum held near central [[Kuala Lumpur]] had been disrupted by the [[Royal Malaysian Police]], according to HINDRAF.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bangkit.net/2007/10/09/police-attempts-to-sabotage-hindraf-forum-in-semenyih-on-6102007/ POLICE ATTEMPTS TO SABOTAGE HINDRAF FORUM IN SEMENYIH ON 6.10.2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212131659/http://www.bangkit.net/2007/10/09/police-attempts-to-sabotage-hindraf-forum-in-semenyih-on-6102007/ |date=12 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Subsequently, HINDRAF appealed directly to the Inspector General of [[Law enforcement in Malaysia|the Malaysian Police]] in an attempt to ensure future forums went on peacefully.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.policewatchmalaysia.com/index.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1195208061&amp;archive=&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=9&amp; Hindraf seek IGP protection for nationwide forums / assemblies]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrests in November===
On 23 November 2007, three HINDRAF, P. Uthayakumar, Waytha Moorthy, and V. Ganabathirau, were arrested and charged under the [[Sedition Act (Malaysia)|Sedition Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Police arrest Hindraf leaders (update 2) | date = 23 November 2007 | work= Malaysia Star | url =  http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2007/11/23/nation/20071123123403&amp;sec=nation }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Lawyers charged with sedition | work= Malaysia Star| date = 24 November 2007 |  url = http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2007/11/24/nation/19567875&amp;sec=nation}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a series of repeated arrests and releases, the courts could not prove that they had incited racial hatred. The only evidence against them were unreliable translations of their Tamil speeches into Bahasa Malaysia presented by the Attorney-General's Chambers, which the courts deemed as unverifiable. Eventually, they were all acquitted due to a shaky prosecution and the lack of evidence of any wrongdoing or crime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/75273] Subscription required&lt;/ref&gt;

===Petition and rally===
{{main|2007 HINDRAF rally}}
[[Image:HINDRAFQueen.jpg|thumb|left|A HINDRAF activist carries a poster of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] during the march to deliver their petition to the British [[High Commission]].]]
On 31 August 2007, the 50th anniversary of Malaysia's independence, [[Waytha Moorthy Ponnusamy|P. Waytha Moorthy]], a HINDRAF lawyer filed a [[class action]] suit against the Government of the United Kingdom at the [[Royal Courts of Justice]] in London for US$4 trillion (US$1 million for every [[Malaysian Indian]]) for "withdrawing after granting independence and leaving us (Indians) unprotected and at the mercy of a majority Malay-Muslim government that has violated our rights as minority Indians"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.policewatchmalaysia.com/index.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1188457297&amp;archive=&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=9&amp;] Particulars of Claim.&lt;/ref&gt; as guaranteed in the [[Constitution of Malaysia|Federal Constitution]] when independence was granted.&lt;ref name="T"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1687973,00.html|title=Facing Malaysia's Racial Issues|date=26 November 2007|work=TIME.com|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lawsuit is not only claiming 4 trillion [[pound sterling|British Pounds]] as compensation, it is also seeking to strike out [[Article 153 of the Malaysian Constitution]] which acknowledges [[Ketuanan Melayu|Malay Supremacy]] and for the court to declare that Malaysia is a [[secular state]] and not an [[Islamic state]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=39221 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211003316/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=39221 |archivedate=11 December 2007 |df=dmy-all }} [[Inter Press Service]] news report.&lt;/ref&gt; as declared by former Prime Minister [[Mahathir Mohamad|Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohamad]] who is quarterly of Indian-Muslim descent.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bf-1.com/asian-news/malaysia-singapore-news/mahathir-biografy Mahathir – Biografy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://malaysia.jbdirectory.com/Doctor_in_the_House_-_I_Am_A_Malay Doctor in the House - I Am A Malay&lt;/ref&gt;

As the group, which represents mainly working class [[Malaysian Indian]]s, could not afford the legal fees required, a petition was circulated with 100,000 signatures to be presented to [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] to appoint a [[Queen's Counsel]] to argue the case.&lt;ref name="T"/&gt; The purpose of the rally was to hand over a 100,000 signature memorandum to the [[British Embassy]] in [[Kuala Lumpur]].

HINDRAF organised the rally on Sunday, 25 November 2007 to submit the petition at the British [[High Commission]]. Malaysian police refused to grant a permit for the rally,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www5.malaysiakini.com/news/75027 Malaysiakini (needs subscription)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205220911/http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/75027 |date=5 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and set up roadblocks in [[Klang Valley]] along roads leading up to the rally to screen motorists entering the city centre and identify "troublemakers".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.detikdaily.net/m3/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1204 Detikdaily - Hindraf rally: Arrests, roadblocks will make it worse&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071125005115/http://www.detikdaily.net/m3/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1204 |date=25 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also advised the public not to participate in the rally,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRxMhk9cD40|title=Hindraf rally: Cops warn of 'stern action'|date=23 November 2007|accessdate=15 April 2016|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; and arrested three leaders of HINDRAF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEIE3N_DvXA|title=Another Hindraf lawyer arrested|date=23 November 2007 |accessdate=15 April 2016|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many shops around Kuala Lumpur including [[Suria KLCC]] were closed on that day in fear of trouble from the rally.

One day before the rally, police arrested three HINDRAF lawyers, [[P. Uthayakumar]], [[P. Waytha Moorthy]] and V. Ganabathirau for sedition charges. Uthayakumar and Ganabathirau posted bail of 800 [[Malaysian ringgit]]s each, but Waytha Moorthy refused bail as a sign of protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news.cfm?NewsID=54188 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603232003/http://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news.cfm?NewsID=54188 |archivedate=3 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }} Daily Express, East Malaysia Independent Newspaper&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=6&amp;art_id=57494&amp;sid=16446487&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20071124&amp;fc=10 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130916172221/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=6&amp;art_id=57494&amp;sid=16446487&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20071124&amp;fc=10 |archivedate=16 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }} ''The Standard'' Hong Kong&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianmalaysian.com/sound/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=777] iMOL, Indian Malaysian Online&lt;/ref&gt;

The police roadblocks started the week before the rally to create massive traffic jams across the city and the outskirts of [[Kuala Lumpur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/Friday/National/2091564/Article/index_html|publisher=New Straits Times |title=Malaysia General Business Sports and Lifestyle News |accessdate=15 April 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205073438/http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/Friday/National/2091564/Article/index_html|archivedate=5 February 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Malaysian Opposition leader [[Lim Kit Siang]] of the DAP pointed out that this high-handed act by the police was unnecessary as it caused major inconvenience to everyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.limkitsiang.com/2007/11/23/hindraf-rally-police-stop-stop-over-reacting-dismantle-roadblocks-and-issue-permit/|title=Hindraf rally – police stop over-reacting, dismantle roadblocks and issue permit « Lim Kit Siang|work=Lim Kit Siang|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:HINDRAF.jpg|thumb|right|Riot police use [[teargas]] and [[water cannon]] to break up the march on 25 November 2007.]]
On the morning of the rally, an estimated twenty thousand people gathered near the [[Petronas Twin Towers]] in [[Kuala Lumpur]], carrying life-size portraits of Queen Elizabeth and [[Mahatma Gandhi]], to indicate the nonviolent nature of their protest.&lt;ref name="T"/&gt; Five thousand members riot police dispatched to the scene used tear gas and water cannon to disperse the crowds. 136 people were arrested.&lt;ref name="T"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2007/11/26/nation/19575394&amp;sec=nation Cops forced to use tear gas, water cannons] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003072937/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2007%2F11%2F26%2Fnation%2F19575394&amp;sec=nation |date=3 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The protest at the [[Batu Caves]] resulted in minor property damages,&lt;ref&gt;[http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2007/11/26/nation/19576008&amp;sec=nation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010115706/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2007%2F11%2F26%2Fnation%2F19576008&amp;sec=nation |date=10 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although the Hindu temple itself was not damaged.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2007/11/27/nation/19582291&amp;sec=nation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010115716/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2007%2F11%2F27%2Fnation%2F19582291&amp;sec=nation |date=10 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

HINDRAF later claimed to have faxed the petition to the British High Commission staff. However, as of 28 November, the British Envoy had not yet received any petition from the HINDRAF, though they did say they had received some unspecified information by fax.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2007/11/28/nation/19597270&amp;sec=nation British envoy: No petition received] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212134322/http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2007%2F11%2F28%2Fnation%2F19597270&amp;sec=nation |date=12 February 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response from the government===
Malaysian prime minister, [[Najib Tun Razak]] warned that the government will invoke the [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|Internal Security Act]] against the demonstrators if they needed. The prime minister further criticised the demonstrators, after he made a promise that he will listen to everyone even if they have unpleasant words to say, the government of Abdullah also attempted to link terrorism with the Hindraf rally via the media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.straitstimes.com/Latest%2BNews/Asia/STIStory_181660.html US defends peaceful protests in Malaysia] ''The Straits Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 11 December 2007, the HINDRAF leaders were all acquitted by the judicial courts due to lack of evidence and a flimsy prosecution case against their allegations. To contain the movement while not being able to charge them according to valid evidence-based legal processes, on 12 December 2007 Prime Minister [[Abdullah Badawi]] personally signed the detention letters to imprison the HINDRAF leaders under the [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|ISA]] for two years, in which their detention terms are subject to infinite renewal. The reason given for this arrest was that the HINDRAF leadership has had links with international terrorist organisations such as LTTE and also supposedly militant organisations in the mould of RSS in India. The invocation of the ISA to capture the HINDRAF leaders was seen as a strategic move by the UMNO government to arrest the momentum generated by HINDRAF.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}
The UMNO lead Government has threatened the Malaysian Indian community{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} with sweeping arrests under the Emergency Act and ISA (similar to Operasi Lalang of the 1987, which targeted anti-BN elements in Malaysia, mostly of Malaysian Chinese extraction){{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}. This hardline approach is also softened by the MIC reconciliatory approach to blunt HINDRAF's thrust as the champion of the Malaysian Indian community.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Response to the detentions==
Even as Prime Minister [[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]] started threatening to use the ISA against the HINDRAF leaders for bringing Malaysia's racist policies out into the open for all to see, foreign news outlets criticised Badawi's lack of initiative to tackle the root cause of the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=904&amp;Itemid=31|title=Independent news and analysis about Asia's politics, economics, culture and more|work=Asia Sentinel|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/12/09/stories/2007120955290100.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Malaysia considering ISA against Hindraf | date=9 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The detention without trial of the HINDRAF leaders drew negative comments in the foreign press about Badawi's administration and the poor way that the [[Government of Malaysia]] were handling the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Ethnic_Indians_held_under_security_law_Malaysia/articleshow/2619910.cms |title=Ethnic Indians held under security law: Malaysia|work=The Times of India |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071216202637/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Ethnic_Indians_held_under_security_law_Malaysia/articleshow/2619910.cms |archivedate=16 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_asiapacific/view/317384/1/.html|title=Channel NewsAsia|work=Channel NewsAsia|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Democratic Action Party]] vowed to challenge the detention of the HINDRAF leaders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newkerala.com/one.php?action=fullnews&amp;id=3201] [http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2007/12/14/nation/19762029&amp;sec=nation]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the arrests, the opposition and most of the NGOs were unfazed and continued to challenge [[UMNO]]'s deconstruction of democracy in Malaysia. The United States had also voiced their disapproval of this latest round of ISA arrests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=40473|publisher=Inter Press Service |title=News and Views from the Global South |accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official HINDRAF website at http://www.policewatchmalaysia.com has been allowed by Malaysian ISPs again, after a brief ban.  However this site is constantly plagued by faults and downtime.  In response to the ban, sites such as http://www.hindraf.org, http://www.myhindraf.com were spawned to maintain awareness of this movement, in addition to the many blogs available.  The movement started in Malaysia, has grown global and now has following in UK, Australia, Canada and USA.

There has also been candlelight vigils at Hindu temples throughout Malaysia to protest the detention of five leaders of the HINDRAF.  This was condemned by Malaysian minister [[Samy Vellu]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://in.news.yahoo.com/indiaabroad/20080128/r_t_ians_wl_asia/twl-malaysian-minister-slams-pro-hindraf-d5d6288_1.html "Malaysian minister slams pro-Hindraf campaign"], Yahoo! India News, January 28, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==War of the Roses==
The Rose to the PM campaign was mooted to present a humanistic element in HINDRAF's campaign.  The central focus of this campaign was the delivery of a rose, as a symbol of love and compassion, to the Malaysian Prime Minister at the Malaysian Parliament by Vwaishnavi Wathya Moorthy (aged 5).  This symbolic act was to occur on 16 February 2008, but the Malaysian Lower House was dissolved for the Federal Elections on 13 February 2008.

In a dramatic show of force, the police fired teargas and targeted water cannon at several hundred ethnic Tamils at the centre of Kuala Lumpur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/02/17/stories/2008021750180100.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Hindraf's 'roses campaign' thwarted | date=17 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More than 200 people were detained by the authorities after being attacked by the police near the site of an Indian temple.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20080216/wl_asia_afp/malaysiaprotestsrights_080216164742&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.mysinchew.com/node/7133?tid=4 |title=Malaysia: Police Break Up Ethnic Indian Rally, Detain More Than 120 People |date=17 February 2008 |author=ULIA ZAPPEI|work=AP Associated Press|publisher=MySinchew |accessdate=8 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The impact of HINDRAF on the 12th Malaysian general elections==
The 12th general Election showed how HINDRAF had become one of the triggers for a major change in the course of the country.  The general dissatisfaction with the regime ruled by UMNO which had been brewing for some years was the kerosene and Hindraf Rally of 25 November was the tinder that sparked off the kerosene into a major explosion in what has come to be called a Political Tsunami in Malaysian politics.

The ruling UMNO led government lost its two-thirds majority in Parliament and came close to  getting just over half the seats in Parliament from the Peninsula.  HINDRAF which had barely existed for 3 years up to that time, and which was barely known up till August 2007 suddenly had caught the mood of a large proportion of Malaysians, not only Tamils and Hindus but the Chinese and a sizeable section of the Malays as well, causing a major upset in the process.

==Hindraf declared as illegal organisation==
After several warnings by the Malaysian government HINDRAF was officially banned on 15 October 2008, confirmed by [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Malaysia)|Malaysian Home Minister]] Datuk Seri Syed Hamid Albar.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/10/15/nation/20081015184431&amp;sec=nation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malaysianbar.org.my/legal/general_news/hindraf_declared_an_illegal_organisation.html|title=The Malaysian Bar|publisher=|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v3/news_lite.php?id=364772|title=Malaysian National News Agency ~ BERNAMA|publisher=|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a statement issued at the ministry, Syed Hamid said the decision to declare HINDRAF as an illegal organisation was made following the ministry being satisfied with facts and evidence that showed HINDRAF had and was being used for unlawful purposes and posed a threat to public order and morality.

"Based on powers vested under Section 5(1) of the Societies Act, HINDRAF from today is declared an illegal organisation," he said.

He said the order was being made as a result of monitoring and investigation on the organisation's activities by the Registrar of Societies (ROs) and Home Ministry, since Hindraf's inception.

==More detentions by the Malaysian government==
On 23 October 2008, a group comprising eight men, three women and a child, were arrested by the police after they tried to hand a memorandum to the Prime Minister's office. The memorandum called for the release of the five Hindraf leaders from detention under the Internal Security Act.

==Interlok==
On 27 February 2011, HINDRAF organised a demonstration in [[Kuala Lumpur]] protesting against the government's decision to include the Malay language novel ''[[Interlok]]'' in the school curriculum as compulsory reading for the Malay literature subject for students in secondary 5. HINDRAF alleges that ''Interlok'' contained disparaging remarks against Malaysian Indians and is deemed racist. The police arrested 109 people for allegedly taking part in an illegal demonstration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article1495169.ece|title=109 people linked to Hindu rights group held in Malaysia|date=27 February 2011|work=The Hindu|accessdate=27 February 2011|location=Chennai, India|first=P. S.|last=Suryanarayana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current status==
The ban imposed on this minority right group was later lifted by the Malaysian Home Ministry on 26 January 2013 and on 8 March 2013 the Malaysian Registrar of Societies had approved the registration of Hindraf.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thesundaily.my/news/685223&lt;/ref&gt; Recently on 18 April 2013, fractions of Hindraf which were led by P. Waythamoorthy  signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with [[Barisan Nasional|BN]] in which they would work together to uplift displaced estate workers, resolve the issue of stateless persons and provide business opportunities thus bringing poor Indians into the mainstream of the country's development while others spreading out to parties within the federal opposition [[Pakatan Rakyat]] (PR), mostly to [[Democratic Action Party|DAP]] or [[People's Justice Party, Malaysia|PKR]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2013/01/26/govt-lifts-ban-on-hindraf/|title=Govt lifts ban on Hindraf|work=Free Malaysia Today|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hornbillunleashed.wordpress.com/2013/04/15/44780/|title=WHAT A SNAKE!

According to Hindu cosmology, there is no absolute start to time, as it is considered infinite and cyclic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authors = Sushil Mittal, Gene Thursby | page = 284 | title = Hindu World | publisher = Routledge | date = 2012 | isbn=9781134608751 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the space and universe has neither start nor end, rather it is cyclical. The current universe is just the start of a present cycle preceded by an infinite number of universes and to be followed by another infinite number of universes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Andrew Zimmerman Jones | page = 262 | title = String Theory For Dummies | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | date = 2009 | isbn=9780470595848 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thesis of creation==
===Rigveda: speculation on universe's creation===
The ''[[Rigveda]]'', composed between 1500 to 1200 BCE, presents many theories of cosmology. For example:
* ''Hiranyagarbha sukta'', its hymn 10.121, states a golden child was born in the universe and was the lord, established earth and heaven, then asks but who is the god to whom we shall offer the sacrificial prayers?&lt;ref&gt;Charles Lanman, [https://archive.org/stream/sacredbooksearly09hornuoft#page/48/mode/2up To the unknown god], Book X, Hymn 121, Rigveda, The Sacred Books of the East Volume IX: India and Brahmanism, Editor: [[Max Muller]], Oxford, pages 49-50&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Devi sukta'', its hymn 10.125, states a goddess is all, the creator, the created universe, the feeder and the lover of the universe;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Lanman, [https://archive.org/stream/sacredbooksearly09hornuoft#page/46/mode/2up Hymns by Women], Book X, Hymn 125, Rigveda, The Sacred Books of the East Volume IX: India and Brahmanism, Editor: [[Max Muller]], Oxford, pages 46-47&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Nasadiya sukta'', its hymn 10.129, asks who created the universe, does anyone really know, and whether it can ever be known.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Lanman, [https://archive.org/stream/sacredbooksearly09hornuoft#page/48/mode/2up The Creation Hymn], Book X, Hymn 129, Rigveda, The Sacred Books of the East Volume IX: India and Brahmanism, Editor: [[Max Muller]], Oxford, page 48&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Henry White Wallis, the ''Rigveda'' and other Vedic texts are full of alternate cosmological theories and curiosity questions. For example, the hymn 1.24 of the Rigveda asks, "these stars, which are set on high, and appear at night, whither do they go in the daytime?" and hymn 10.88 wonders, "how many fires are there, how many suns, how many dawns, how many waters? I am not posing an awkward question for you fathers; I ask you, poets, only to find out?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry White Wallis|title=The Cosmology of the Ṛigveda: An Essay|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=9xBCAAAAIAAJ|year= 1887|publisher= Williams and Norgate|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Laurie L. Patton|title=Bringing the Gods to Mind: Mantra and Ritual in Early Indian Sacrifice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gSZmbbsg9bEC |year=2005|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-93088-9|pages=113, 216}}&lt;/ref&gt; To its numerous open-ended questions, the Vedic texts present a diversity of thought, in verses imbued with symbols and allegory, where in some cases forces and agencies are clothed with a distinct personality, while in other cases as nature with or without anthropomorphic activity such as forms of mythical sacrifices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Henry White Wallis|title= The Cosmology of the Ṛigveda: An Essay|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=9xBCAAAAIAAJ|year= 1887|publisher= Williams and Norgate|pages=61-73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Rigveda'' contains the [[Nasadiya sukta]] hymn which does not offer a cosmological theory, but asks cosmological questions about the nature of universe and how it began:

{{quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
Darkness there was at first, by darkness hidden;
Without distinctive marks, this all was water;
That which, becoming, by the void was covered;
That One by force of heat came into being;

Who really knows? Who will here proclaim it?
Whence was it produced? Whence is this creation?
Gods came afterwards, with the creation of this universe.
Who then knows whence it has arisen?

Whether God's will created it, or whether He was mute;
Perhaps it formed itself, or perhaps it did not;
Only He who is its overseer in highest heaven knows,
Only He knows, or perhaps He does not know.
&lt;/poem&gt;

:''In politics, the term "incrementalism" is also used as a synonym for [[Gradualism#Politics and society|Gradualism]].''
'''Incrementalism''' is a method of working by adding to a project using many small [[wikt:incremental|incremental]] changes instead of a few (extensively planned) large jumps. [[Logic]]al incrementalism implies that the steps in the process are sensible.&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, J.B., 1978. Strategic change: logical incrementalism. Sloan Management Review 20 (1), 7–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Logical incrementalism focuses on "the Power-Behavioral Approach to planning rather than to the Formal Systems Planning Approach".&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, J. B. (1978). Strategic Change: "Logical Incrementalism." Sloan Management Review, 20 (1), p7.&lt;/ref&gt; In public policy, incrementalism is the method of change by which many small policy changes are enacted over time in order to create a larger broad based policy change. This was the theoretical policy of rationality developed by [[Charles E. Lindblom|Lindblom]] to be seen as a middle way between the [[rational actor model]] and [[bounded rationality]], as both long term goal driven policy rationality and [[satisficing]] were not seen as adequate.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

== Origin ==
Most people use incrementalism without ever needing a name for it because it is the natural and intuitive way to tackle everyday problems, such as making [[coffee]] or getting dressed. These actions normally don't require extensive planning and problems can be dealt with one at a time as they arise.

Even in processes that involve more extensive planning, incrementalism is often an important tactic for dealing reactively with small details. For example, one might plan a route for a driving trip on a map, but one would not typically plan in advance where to change lanes or how long to stop at each streetlight.

The political scientist Charles E. Lindblom developed Incrementalism in the mid 1950s. “The Science of Muddling Through” (1959), was an essay Lindblom wrote to help policymakers understand why they needed to consider a different approach when making policy changes. The goal for the new perspective of Incrementalism was for policy makers to avoid making changes before they really engaged and rationally thought through the issue.&lt;ref&gt;Incrementalism. (n.d.). Retrieved November 20, 2015, from http://reachandywilliams.weebly.com/incrementalism.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contrasts to other planning methodologies ==
In large projects following some type of [[strategic planning]], there is normally a need to allocate time to plan the project in order to avoid "fire fighting", in other words the avoidance of time delaying issues. In contrast to other systems of planning such as [[Top-down and bottom-up design|top down, bottom up]], and so on, incrementalism involves concentrating on dealing with the immediate problems as they arrive and avoiding trying to create an overall strategic plan. This means muddling through the issues at hand based on importance.

[[Strategy implementation|Strategic implementation]] is a very well thought out plan of implementation that is the opposite to incrementalism. Although the plan involved with the strategic implementation might work incrementally it has set objectives at set times with little to no intention of muddling through the process. In other words, every part of the implementation would be expected and planned for ahead of time.

The [[antithesis]] of incrementalism is that work must be accomplished in one single push rather than through a process of [[continuous improvement]]. All work must be planned, only presented when complete and work in progress must be hidden. 

In [[political science]], research on incrementalism has largely been incorporated into the study of [[Punctuated equilibrium in social theory]], which views policy change as periods of incremental improvement punctuated by major policy shifts.

== Advantages ==
The advantages of incrementalism over other formal systems is that no time is wasted planning for outcomes which may not occur.
* Politically expedient: Since it does not involve any radical and complete changes, it is easily accepted and therefore the process is expedient.
* Simplicity: it is very simple to understand. Compared to some of the other budgeting methods used in business, it is one of the easiest to put in practice one does not have to be an accountant or have much experience in business to use this form of budgeting.
* Gradual change: a very stable budget exists from one period to the next and allows for gradual change within the company. Many managers are intimidated by large budget increases from one period to the next. This type of budget will not cause that problem because it is based on the previous period's budget.
* Flexibility: it is very flexible. Doing it from one month to the next allows one to see change very quickly when a new policy or budget is implemented.
* Avoiding conflict: companies with many different departments often run into conflict between departments because of their different budgets. With this method of budgeting, it is easier to keep everyone on the same page and avoid conflicts between departments&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, S., &amp; Harbridge, L. (June 2010). Incrementalism in Appropriations: Small Aggregation, Big Changes. Retrieved October 2, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disadvantages ==
Disadvantages are that time may be wasted dealing with the immediate problems and no overall strategy is developed. Incrementalism in the study of rationality can be seen as a stealthy way to bring about radical changes that were not initially intended, a [[slippery slope]].
* Beagle Fallacy: A beagle hound has a very good sense of smell but limited eyesight, and thus could miss prey that appears in front of but downwind. Likewise, by only focusing on incremental changes to policies and policy applications, organisations are in danger of missing the broader directions in fulfilling their mandate. Beagle fallacy is the primary criticism of incrementalism.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.in/books?id=Dg-7OFEp3E8C&amp;pg=PA84&amp;lpg=PA84&amp;dq=beagle+fallacy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0agOe_TBRo&amp;sig=tOA8AhV5wq9xZt6DEDn1iL_Ho_o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjR1LDyjv3VAhXEMo8KHUB1DewQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=beagle%20fallacy&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;
* Failure to account for change: it is based on the idea that expenses will run much as they did before. However, in business, that is rarely the case, and there are always variables.
* Absence of incentives: such a simple method of budgeting really does not provide employees with much reason to be creative. They have no incentive to innovate and come up with new ideas or policies since everything is limited.
* "Use it or lose it" perspective: Many employees view this as a "use it or lose it" system and know that next year's budget is going to be incrementally based on this year's. Therefore, if they do not spend everything that is allocated to them, they may not have enough money to work with next year. That creates an environment where waste is encouraged.&lt;ref&gt;Vladeck, B. (2001, February 1). Medicare and the Politics of Incrementalism. Retrieved October 2, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
Incrementalism is commonly employed in [[politics]], [[engineering]], [[software design]], [[planning]] and [[industry]]. Whereas it is often criticized as "fire fighting", the progressive improvement of product designs characteristic, e.g., of [[Japan]]ese engineering can create steadily improving product performance, which in certain circumstances outperforms more orthodox planning systems.

Another example would be in small changes that make way for a bigger overall change to get past unnoticed. A series of small steps toward an agenda would be less likely to be questioned than a large and swift change. An example could be the rise of gas prices, the company would only raise the price by a few cents every day, instead of a large change to a target price overnight.  More people would notice and dispute a dramatic, 100% increase overnight, while a 100% increase over a span of a week would less likely be even noticed, let alone argued.  This can be applied in many different ways, such as, economics, politics, a person's appearance, or laws.

=== Examples ===
In the 1970s, many countries decided to invest in [[wind energy]]. [[Denmark]], a small country of around 5 million people, became a world leader in this technology using an incremental approach.&lt;ref&gt;F. Borum and PH Kristiansen (Copenhagen, 1989); "Industrial Innovation and Incremental Learning: The Case of Danish Wind Technology from 1975 to 1988&lt;/ref&gt; While more formal design processes in the [[United States|US]], [[Germany]] and the [[United Kingdom]] failed to develop competitive machines. The reason for the difference of approach was that the Danish wind industry developed from an agricultural base whilst the American and UK wind industries were based on [[hi-tech]] [[aerospace]] companies with significant [[university]] involvement.&lt;ref name="Bricolage" /&gt; While the Danes built better and better windmills using an incremental approach, those using formal planning techniques believed that they could easily design a superior windmill straight away.

In practice, however, windmill design is not very complicated and the biggest problem is the tradeoff between cost and reliability. Although the UK and the U.S.A. designs were technically superior, the lack of experience in the field meant that their machines were less reliable in the field. In contrast, the heavy agricultural windmills produced by the Danes just kept turning, and by 2000 the top three windmill manufacturers in the world were Danish.&lt;ref name="Bricolage" /&gt;

The [[Central Arizona Project]] and the [[Salt River Project]] display the use of [[Innovation]] and incrementalism.  There was a Plan 6 cost-sharing program that was a component in both of these projects and displayed innovations of the external enforcers and internal entrepreneurs and how they muddled through as well as collaborated incrementally to work on these projects with many different players in the mix.&lt;ref&gt;Micale, L. M. (1990). Policy change as innovation and incrementalism: The case of plan 6 cost-sharing.  http://search.proquest.com/docview/303793098&lt;/ref&gt;

The resource allocation in local authorities is riddled by politics and provides the underlying methods of incrementalism in the negotiations process of putting local authorities priorities together.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, R. P. (1986). Incrementalism and the politics of resource allocation in local authorities. http://search.proquest.com/docview/1477359910&lt;/ref&gt; Looking the United States Federal Budget is a back and forth negotiation between politicians and provides great insight of incremental change.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, R. E. (2014). An examination of the effects of incrementalism and annuality in U.S. government budgeting practices. http://search.proquest.com/docview/1528557751&lt;/ref&gt; Every year a new budget must be formed to allocate funds to the agencies such as the DoD and government programs such as Social Security and Medicare. The amounts with which are decided gradually change based on the importance as well as efficiencies and inefficiencies of agencies or priorities.

In the case of climate change the opinions changed gradually over the years as more and more scientific evidence became clear to policy makers that it should be a prevalent policy issue.&lt;ref&gt;Knaggård, Å. (2014). What do policy-makers do with scientific uncertainty? The incremental character of Swedish climate change policy-making. Policy Studies, 35(1), 22-39. doi:10.1080/01442872.2013.804175&lt;/ref&gt; [[Political economy of climate change]] and [[Politics of global warming]] are worth noting on the international scale of climate change policy and how there has been an incremental leaning towards the belief and action against climate change over the years.

== Related concepts ==
Incrementalism is a planning methodology normally found where a large strategic plan is either unnecessary or has failed to develop and for that reason it is often just called "muddling through".&lt;ref&gt;[[Overseas Development Institute]] Research and Policy in Development Group; [http://www.odi.org.uk/RAPID/Tools/Theory/Theories_muddlethrough.html Fundamental decisions vs disjointed incrementalism ('muddling through')]&lt;/ref&gt; Incrementalism is the antithesis of intrusive central planning, which can create rigid work systems unable to deal with the actual problems faced at the grassroots level.&lt;ref name="Bricolage"&gt;Raghu Garuda &amp; Peter Karnøe; "Bricolage versus breakthrough: distributed and embedded agency in technology entrepreneurship", Research Policy 32 (2003) 277–300&lt;/ref&gt; However, without a central planning framework incremental working is difficult to support within structured systems and therefore requires a degree of self-reliance, skills and experience of those dealing with the problems such as is found in [[autonomous work group]]s. &lt;!-- no Wikipedia entry? --&gt;

'''Indecent exposure''' is the deliberate exposure in public or in view of the general public by a person of a portion or portions of their body, in circumstances where the exposure is contrary to local moral or other standards of appropriate behavior. The term ''indecent exposure'' is a legal expression. Social and community attitudes to the exposing of various body parts and laws covering what is referred to as indecent exposure vary significantly in different countries. It ranges from outright prohibition to prohibition of exposure of certain body parts, such as the [[genital area]], [[buttock]]s or [[breast]]s.

Decency is generally judged by the standards of the local community, which are seldom codified in specifics in law. Such standards may be based on religion, morality or tradition, or justified on the basis of "necessary to [[public order]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary |edition=Tenth |publisher=Merriam-Webster |year=2001 |chapter=Indecent exposure |page=589 |isbn=0-87779-713-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-sexual [[exhibitionism]] or [[public nudity]] is sometimes considered indecent exposure. If [[Human sexual activity|sexual act]]s are performed, with or without an element of nudity, this can be considered [[gross indecency]], which is usually a more serious criminal offence. In some countries, exposure of the body in breach of community standards of [[modesty]] is also considered to be public indecency.

The legal and community standards of what states of undress constitute indecent exposure vary considerably and depend on the context in which the exposure takes place. These standards have also varied over time, making the definition of indecent exposure itself a complex topic.

== Overview ==
It is generally accepted, at least in [[western countries]], that a naked human body is not in itself indecent. That principle is reflected, for example, in [[depictions of nudity|depiction of the human form]] in art of various forms. Nevertheless, as a general rule, it is also commonly expected that people when they appear in a public place will be appropriately attired. Inappropriateness is viewed in context, so that, for example, what may be appropriate on a beach may be inappropriate in a street, school or workplace. Depending on the context, some degree of inappropriateness may be tolerated, and perhaps described as [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric]], but in extreme cases of inappropriateness it may be regarded as "crossing the line". Besides the social disapproval of such a state of dress, most jurisdictions have laws to "maintain social order", variously described as [[public nudity]], indecent exposure, as an affront to [[public morality]], public nuisance, besides others. What is an inappropriate state of dress in a particular context depends on the standards of [[decency]] of the community where an exposure takes place. These standards vary from time to time and can vary from the very strict standards of [[modesty]] in places such as Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia, which require most of the body to be covered, to tribal societies such as the [[Pirahã people|Pirahã]] or [[Mursi people|Mursi]] where full nakedness is the norm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://politics.stackexchange.com/questions/1416/legality-of-nudism-in-public-places/1524#1524|title=Legality of Nudism in Public Places?|website=politics.stackexchange.com|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is generally no implication that the state of dress objected to is of a sexual nature; and if such an allegation were to be made, the act would generally be described as "[[gross indecency]]".

The standards of decency have varied over time. During the [[Victorian era]], for example, exposure of a woman's legs and some extent the arms,  was considered indecent in much of the [[Western world]].  Hair was sometimes required to be covered in formal occasions as in a form a hat or bonnet. As late as the 1930s and to some extent, the 1950s,  both women and men were expected to bathe or swim in public places wearing [[bathing suit]]s that covered above the waist. An adult woman exposing her [[navel]] was also considered indecent in the West into the 1960s and 1970s, and even as late as the 1980s.  Moral values changed drastically during the 1990s and 2000s, which in turn changed the criteria for indecent exposure.  Public exposure of the navel has been accepted during the 1990s, such as in beaches,  while in the 2000s, the buttocks can be exposed while wearing a thong.  Today, however, it is quite common for women to go topless at public beaches throughout Europe and South America and even some parts of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/3834365/map-topless-laws/|title=Here's Where It's Legal for Women to Go Topless in the U.S.|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the phenomenon widely known as [[exhibitionism|flashing]], involving a woman exposing bare nipples by suddenly pulling up her shirt and [[bra]], may be free from sexual motive or intent, it nonetheless is public exposure and is therefore defined by statute in many states of the United States as prohibited criminal behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/topics/state_statutes2.html#criminal_code |title=Criminal Code |author= |date= |work=Topical Index: State Statutes 2 |publisher=Cornell University Law School |accessdate=2010-09-14}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The motivation of the exposure is sometimes based on it being unusual, attention-getting, [[sexual arousal|sexually arousing]], or separately, as in a public policy protest, inappropriate and to show disrespect to the enemy side. The effects (including negative consequences) may be enhanced by intended or unintended publication of a photograph or film of the act, which would also include [[mooning]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

[[Breastfeeding in public]] does not constitute indecent exposure under the laws of the United States, Canada, Australia, or Scotland.&lt;ref name="Scotlandact"&gt;{{cite web| authorlink = Queen's Printer for Scotland | title = Breastfeeding etc. (Scotland) Act 2005. | url = http://www.opsi.gov.uk/legislation/scotland/acts2005/20050001.htm | accessdate = 2007-05-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the [[Government of the United States|federal government]] and all 50 states&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://eu.usatoday.com/story/life/allthemoms/2018/07/25/public-breastfeeding-now-legal-all-50-states/835372002/|title=Finally!

==Public clothing==

Public clothing varies by country and may be regulated by law. What parts of the body must be covered varies by region. Although genitals are usually expected to be covered in public in almost all societies, when it comes to other parts of the body such as female breasts, midriff, legs or shoulders, norms vary. For example, in some African cultures, it is the thighs, not the breasts, which must be covered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3031969.stm|title=MPs defend Swazi bare breasts|author=Tom Holloway |date=15 May 2003|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some societies, the head hair, especially female, must be covered, usually with a scarf. The vast majority of cultures accept that the face can and must be seen, but some cultures (especially in the [[Middle East]]), require that it be covered under a [[burqa]]. In conservative societies, appearing in a public place in clothing that is deemed 'indecent' is illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6919581.stm|title=Nigerian skimpy dressers arrested|author=|date=27 July 2007|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-44628887|title=Inquiry into Saudi TV presenter's clothing|author=|date=27 June 2018|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6596933.stm|title=Crackdown in Iran over dress codes|author=Frances Harrison |date=27 April 2007|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many countries there are exceptions to the general rules (social or legal) regarding clothing. For instance, a country which generally prohibits full nudity may allow it in designated places, such as [[nude beaches]], or during various social events such as festivals or nude protests.

==Europe==
Attitudes towards nudity vary by country and are generally most relaxed in [[Scandinavia]], 
where genitals and breasts are not normally considered indecent or obscene. Hence, laws and societal views on public nudity are generally relaxed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Modern Welfare States: Scandinavian Politics and Policy in the Global Age |page=309 |first=Eric S. |last=Einhorn |first2=John |last2=Logue |year=2003 |location=Oxford |publisher=Harcourt |isbn=0-275-95044-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Finland, it is very typical for patrons to bathe nude in the intense heat of [[sauna]]s. 

In the [[Netherlands]], public nudity is allowed at sites that have been assigned by the local authorities and "other suitable places."&lt;ref&gt;[http://213.10.84.49/Home/Content/The_Law.html Nudity and the law&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012081745/http://213.10.84.49/Home/Content/The_Law.html |date=12 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On nudist beaches, in unisex saunas and in swimming pool changing rooms, remaining partially clothed is frowned upon and the social norm is to undress. 

In [[Barcelona]], public nudity was a recognised right. However, on 30 April 2011, the Barcelona City Council voted a by-law forbidding walking "naked or nearly naked in public spaces" and limiting the wearing of bathing costumes to pools, beaches, adjacent streets and sea-side walks.&lt;ref&gt;[[APNEL]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other countries, such as the UK, Ireland or Poland&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/classified-odd/11/08/08/model-fined-sunbathing-topless-ombudsman-appeal-mulled|title=Model fined for sunbathing topless; Ombudsman appeal mulled|agency=AFP|date=8 November 2008|website=ABS-CBN News}}&lt;/ref&gt; are more conservative. 

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom during the 19th and 20th centuries, indecent exposure was prosecuted under either section 28 of the [[Town Police Clauses Act 1847]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1847/89/pdfs/ukpga_18470089_en.pdf|title=Town Police Clauses Act 1847 (as enacted)|last=|first=|date=|website=Legislation.Gov.Uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=19 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or section 4 of the [[Vagrancy Act 1824]]. The latter was a piece of legislation that made it an offence to sleep rough or beg and contained a provision for the prosecution of:
:every person wilfully openly, lewdly, and obscenely exposing his person in any street, road, or public highway, or in the view thereof, or in any place of public resort, with intent to insult any female...
This provision was repealed by section 66 of the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]] which replaced the offence of "indecent exposure" and other sexual offences with legislation that is more specific and explicit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Public Indecency in England 1857-1960: 'A Serious and Growing Evil’|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K1HeCQAAQBAJ|first1=David J.|last1=Cox|first2=Kim|last2=Stevenson|first3=Candida|last3=Harris|first4=Judith|last4=Rowbotham|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=9781317573838|volume=Volume 6|series=SOLON Explorations in Crime and Criminal Justice Histories|page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current laws apply only to genital exposure with intent to shock those who do not want to see them. The maximum penalty is two years' imprisonment, but this is extremely rare as most cases are dealt with by a fine or through community service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2003/ukpga_20030042_en_5#pt1-pb18-l1g66 |title=Sexual Offences Act 2003 |author=Legislation.gov.uk |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=2010-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=legislation.gov.uk|publisher=The National Archives|title=Equality Act 2010|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents|accessdate=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; People convicted of exposure contrary to section 66 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 must sign the [[Violent and Sex Offender Register]] if they are sentenced to a term of imprisonment or a [[community order]] in excess of 12 months, or if the person they exposed themselves to was aged under 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sex Offenders Register|url=http://ukcriminallawblog.com/sex-offenders-register/|work=UK Criminal Law Blog|author=Dan Bunting|date=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public nudity in England and Wales can also be punished as "disorderly behaviour" under the [[Public Order Act 1986]], sections 4A and 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ukhumanrightsblog.com/2013/10/31/freedom-of-expression-nakedness-in-a-public-place/|title=Freedom of expression – nakedness in a public place  - UK Human Rights Blog|work=UK Human Rights Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Scotland and Northern Ireland the situation is more complex, as some sections of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 extend to these places and some do not. Under [[Scots law]], indecent exposure is considered to be a form of public indecency and is regarded as a [[crimes of indecency|crime of indecency]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Scots law has been known to respond differently from English and Welsh law in cases of indecent exposure. [[Stephen Gough]], a man known as the "Naked Rambler" who hikes across Britain wearing only shoes, has been arrested in both jurisdictions with different consequences in each. The [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] has considered the introduction of new legislation.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

{{Main article|Indecent exposure in the United States}}
The laws governing indecent exposure in the United States vary according to location. In most states [[public nudity]] is illegal. However, in some states it is only illegal if it is accompanied by an intent to shock, arouse or offend other persons.  Some states permit local governments to set local standards. Most states exempt [[breastfeeding]] mothers from prosecution.

==Canada==
In Canada, s.173 of the ''Criminal Code''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efc.ca/pages/law/cc/cc.part-v.html |title=Criminal Code of Canada, 1985, Part V, Sexual Offences |publisher=Efc.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; prohibits "indecent acts".&lt;ref&gt;Part 173(1)(a) of the Criminal Code provides, in part - Indecent acts - 173. (1) Every one who wilfully does an indecent act (a) in a public place in the presence of one or more persons...is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no statutory definition in the Code of what constitutes an indecent act, other than the exposure of the genitals and/or female nipples for a sexual purpose to anyone under 16 years of age.  Thus, the decision of what states of undress are "indecent", and thereby unlawful, is left to judges. Judges have held, for example, that [[nude sunbathing]] is not indecent.&lt;ref&gt;''R. v. Beaupré'', 1971, British Columbia Supreme Court. Held: "the phrase 'indecent act' connotes something more active, with greater moral turpitude than the mere state of being nude in a public place."&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[streaking]] is similarly not regarded as indecent.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Springer'', 1975, Saskatchewan District Court&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''R v Niman'', 1974, Ontario Provincial Court&lt;/ref&gt; Section 174 prohibits nudity if it offends "against public decency or order" and in view of the public.  The courts have found that nude swimming is not offensive under this definition.&lt;ref&gt;''R. v. Benolkin'', 1977, Saskatchewan Court of the Queen's Bench. It was found that "It cannot be an offence to swim in the nude at a lonely place in Canada in summer. That is part of the pleasure of summer in Canada, particularly to young males. If somebody comes along unexpectedly or if the swimmer misjudged the loneliness of the place the act cannot suddenly become criminal.".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Toplessness]] is also not an indecent act under s.173. In 1991, Gwen Jacob was arrested for walking in a street in [[Guelph, Ontario]] while topless. She was acquitted in 1996 by the Ontario Court of Appeal on the basis that the act of being topless is not in itself a sexual act or indecent.&lt;ref name="QueenvsJacob"&gt;{{Cite journal| url = http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/1996/1996canlii1119/1996canlii1119.html | title = Judgment C12668, R. vs. Jacob | date = 1996-12-09 | publisher = Province of Ontario Court of Appeal | accessdate = 2009-02-16| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case has been referred to in subsequent cases for the proposition that the mere act of public nudity is not sexual or indecent or an offense.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canlii.org/eliisa/highlight.do?language=en&amp;searchTitle=1996+CanLII+1119+%28ON+CA%29&amp;origin=%2Fen%2Fon%2Fonca%2Fdoc%2F1996%2F1996canlii1119%2F1996canlii1119.html&amp;path=/en/bc/bcsc/doc/2000/2000bcsc902/2000bcsc902.html District of Maple Ridge v.

==Australia==
[[File:Banner protesting vehicle emissions at the World Naked Bike Ride, Auckland, New Zealand - 20050217.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Protesters gathered outside a courthouse to protest against the arrest of [[Simon Oosterman]] (second from left), Auckland's 13 Feb 2005 WNBR organizer.]]
In Australia, it is a [[Summary judgment|summary]] or [[criminal]] offence in some [[States and territories of Australia|States and Territories]] to expose one's genitals (also referred to as - 'his or her person')&lt;ref name="ReginaVEyles"&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWSC|452|1997|litigants=R v Eyles |date=1 October 1997 |courtname=[[NSW Court of Criminal Appeal|Court of Criminal Appeal]] (NSW, Australia)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in a public place or in view of a public place. In some jurisdictions exposure of the genitals alone does not constitute an offence unless accompanied by an indecent act, indecent behaviour, grossly indecent behaviour, [[obscenity]], intention to cause offence or deliberate intention. The applicable law is different in each jurisdiction and in several jurisdictions the offence of indecent exposure does not apply.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Penalties vary between jurisdictions and are summarised below. Specific state [[Act of Parliament|Acts]], are as follows:
*Australian Capital Territory – ''Crimes Act'' 1900, section 393 – 'indecent exposure' – penalty 12 months.

===Definition of ''person''===
The laws of New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory use the term "person", while in the other States the exposure refers to the [[genitalia|genital area]]. It has been noted that a term such as "exposing one's person" relates back to the United Kingdom [[Vagrancy Act 1824|''Vagrancy Act'' 1824]] and ''Evans v Ewels'' (1972)&lt;ref&gt;''Evans v Ewels'' [1972] 1 [[Weekly Law Reports|WLR]] 671.&lt;/ref&gt; where it was said that the word "person" was a [[euphemism|genteel synonym]] for "penis" or "vulva". However, it has been held that the word "person" in s5 of the (NSW) ''Summary Offences Act'' is not limited to "penis" or "vulva". For example, in ''R v Eyles'' (1997) the offender was seen masturbating in his front garden and charged with obscene exposure under the NSW Act.&lt;ref name="ReginaVEyles" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SOA1988" /&gt;

:In the case of both males and females, the parts of the body which are capable of being employed for the purpose of obscene exposure are limited. The concepts of obscenity and exposure in a practical sense restrict the potential operation of the provision. There is a question as to whether there is any further restriction to be found in the word "person". The [[Crown Advocate]] has submitted that there may be circumstances in which the exposure of the breasts of a woman is capable of being regarded as obscene, and that it is not difficult to imagine circumstances in which the exposure of a person's buttocks could be obscene.&lt;ref name="ReginaVEyles" /&gt;

However &amp;ndash;

:It is unnecessary and inappropriate to decide in the present case whether her submissions in that regard are correct. The jurisdiction which this Court is exercising is a jurisdiction confined to determining questions of law which arise in the case before the District Court. No question arises in the present case as to whether there are any circumstances in which the exposure by a female of breasts, or by a female or male of buttocks, could involve a contravention of s5. The prosecution case against the appellant was that he obscenely exposed his penis and other genitals. It is sufficient for resolution of the present case to say that this was capable of constituting exposure of "his person" for the purposes of the proceedings against him.&lt;ref name="ReginaVEyles" /&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=November 2008}}
In [[computer science]], '''information hiding''' is the principle of segregation of the ''design decisions'' in a [[computer program]] that are most likely to change, thus protecting other parts of the program from extensive modification if the design decision is changed. The protection involves providing a stable [[Interface (computer science)|interface]] which protects the remainder of the program from the implementation (the details that are most likely to change).

Written another way, information hiding is the ability to prevent certain aspects of a [[Class (computer science)|class]] or [[software component]] from being accessible to its [[Client (computing)|client]]s, using either programming language features (like private variables) or an explicit exporting policy.

== Overview ==

The term ''encapsulation'' is often used interchangeably with information hiding. Not all agree on the distinctions between the two though; one may think of information hiding as being the principle and encapsulation being the technique.  A software module hides information by encapsulating the information into a module or other construct which presents an interface.&lt;ref name="not_encaps"&gt;
{{cite web
| url = http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-05-2001/jw-0518-encapsulation.html
| title = Encapsulation is not information hiding 
| publisher=[[JavaWorld]]
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

A common use of information hiding is to hide the physical storage layout for data so that if it is changed, the change is restricted to a small subset of the total program.  For example, if a three-dimensional point (''x'',''y'',''z'') is represented in a program with three [[floating point]] [[scalar (computing)|scalar]] variables and later, the representation is changed to a single [[Array data structure|array]] variable of size three, a module designed with information hiding in mind would protect the remainder of the program from such a change.

In [[object-oriented programming]], information hiding (by way of [[Nesting (computing)|nesting]] of types) reduces software development risk by shifting the code's [[Dependency (computer science)|dependency]] on an uncertain implementation (design decision) onto a well-defined [[Interface (computer science)|interface]].  Clients of the interface perform operations purely through it so if the implementation changes, the clients do not have to change.

== Encapsulation ==
{{see also|Encapsulation (computer programming)}}

In his book on [[object-oriented design]], [[Grady Booch]] defined encapsulation as "the process of compartmentalizing the elements of an abstraction that constitute its structure and behavior; encapsulation serves to separate the contractual interface of an abstraction and its implementation."&lt;ref name=Booch&gt;Grady Booch, ''Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications'', . Addison-Wesley, 2007, {{ISBN|0-201-89551-X}}, p. 51-52&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose is to achieve potential for change: the internal mechanisms of the component can be improved without impact on other components, or the component can be replaced with a different one that supports the same public interface. Encapsulation also protects the integrity of the component, by preventing users from setting the internal data of the component into an invalid or inconsistent state. Another benefit of encapsulation is that it reduces system complexity and thus increases robustness, by limiting the interdependencies between software components.&lt;ref name=Booch/&gt;

In this sense, the idea of encapsulation is more general than how it is applied in OOP: for example, a relational database is encapsulated in the sense that its only public interface is a [[Query language]] ([[SQL]] for example), which hides all the internal machinery and data structures of the database management system. As such, encapsulation is a core principle of good software architecture, at every level of granularity.

Encapsulating software behind an interface allows the construction of objects that mimic the behavior and interactions of objects in the real world. For example, a simple digital alarm clock is a real-world object that a [[lay person]] can use and understand.  They can understand what the alarm clock does, and how to use it through the provided interface (buttons and screen), without having to understand every part inside of the clock.  Similarly, if the clock were replaced by a different model, the lay person could continue to use it in the same way, provided that the interface works the same.

In the more concrete setting of an object-oriented programming language, the notion is used to mean either an information hiding mechanism, a bundling mechanism, or the combination of the two. (See [[Encapsulation (object-oriented programming)]] for details.)

==History==
The concept of information hiding was first described by [[David Parnas]] in {{harvtxt|Parnas|1972}}.{{sfn|Scott|2009|p=173}} Before then, modularity was discussed by Richard Gauthier and Stephen Pont in their 1970 book ''Designing Systems Programs'' although [[modular programming]] itself had been used at many commercial sites for many years previously – especially in [[I/O]] [[sub-system]]s and [[software library|software libraries]] – without acquiring the 'information hiding' tag – but for similar reasons, as well as the more obvious [[code reuse]] reason.

== Example of information hiding ==
Information hiding serves as an effective criterion for dividing any piece of equipment, software or hardware, into modules of functionality.  For instance, a car is a complex piece of equipment.  In order to make the design, manufacturing, and maintenance of a car reasonable, the complex piece of equipment is divided into [[module (programming)|modules]] with particular interfaces hiding design decisions.  By designing a car in this fashion, a car manufacturer can also offer various options while still having a vehicle which is economical to manufacture.

For instance, a car manufacturer may have a luxury version of the car as well as a standard version.  The luxury version comes with a more powerful engine than the standard version.  The [[engineer]]s designing the two different car engines, one for the luxury version and one for the standard version, provide the same interface for both engines.  Both engines fit into the engine bay of the car which is the same between both versions.  Both engines fit the same transmission, the same engine mounts, and the same controls.  The differences in the engines are that the more powerful luxury version has a larger displacement with a fuel injection system that is programmed to provide the fuel air mixture that the larger displacement engine requires.

In addition to the more powerful engine, the luxury version may also offer other options such as a better radio with CD player, more comfortable seats, a better suspension system with wider tires, and different paint colors.  With all of these changes, most of the car is the same between the standard version and the luxury version.  The radio with CD player is a module which replaces the standard radio, also a module, in the luxury model.  The more comfortable seats are installed into the same seat mounts as the standard types of seats.  Whether the seats are leather or plastic, or offer lumbar support or not, doesn't matter.

The engineers design the car by dividing the task up into pieces of work which are assigned to teams.  Each team then designs their [[software componentry|component]] to a particular standard or interface which allows the team flexibility in the design of the component while at the same time ensuring that all of the components will fit together.

Motor vehicle manufacturers frequently use the same core structure for several different models, in part as a cost-control measure. Such a "[[automobile platform|platform]]" also provides an example of information hiding, since the floorplan can be built without knowing whether it is to be used in a sedan or a hatchback.

As can be seen by this example, information hiding provides flexibility. This flexibility allows a programmer to modify the functionality of a computer program during normal evolution as the computer program is changed to better fit the needs of users.  When a computer program is well designed decomposing the source code solution into modules using the principle of information hiding, evolutionary changes are much easier because the changes typically are local rather than global changes.

Cars provide another example of this in how they interface with drivers. They present a standard interface (pedals, wheel, shifter, signals, gauges, etc.) on which people are trained and licensed. Thus, people only have to learn to drive a car; they don't need to learn a completely different way of driving every time they drive a new model. (Granted, there are manual and automatic transmissions and other such differences, but on the whole, cars maintain a unified interface.)

'''International Day to End Violence Against Sex Workers''' is observed annually on December 17 by [[sex worker]]s, their advocates, friends, families and allies. Originally conceived as a [[memorial]] and [[vigil]] for the victims of the [[Green River Killer]] in [[Seattle]] [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], United States (US), it has evolved into an annual international event. The day calls attention to [[hate crimes]] committed against sex workers worldwide, as well as the need to remove the [[social stigma]] and [[discrimination]] that have contributed to violence against sex workers and indifference from the communities they are part of. Sex worker activists also state that custom and prohibitionist laws perpetuate such violence.

==Background==
First observed in 2003,&lt;ref name="Press"&gt;{{cite web|title=Candlelight Vigil Calls for an End to Violence Against Sex Workers International Memorial Day Focuses Attention on Violence Against Sex Workers|url=http://www.sexworkersproject.org/releases/PressRelease20031210.html|work=Urban Justice Center|publisher=Sex Workers Project|accessdate=16 December 2013|author=Susan Blake|format=PDF|date=17 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; the International Day to End Violence Against Sex Workers was founded by [[Annie Sprinkle|Dr. Annie Sprinkle]] and the [[Sex Workers Outreach Project USA|Sex Workers Outreach Project USA (SWOP-USA)]],&lt;ref name="Press" /&gt; an American [[sex worker rights]] organization. In a public letter, Sprinkle states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Violent crimes against sex workers go underreported, unaddressed and unpunished. There really are people who don't care when prostitutes are victims of hate crimes, beaten, raped, and murdered. No matter what you think about sex workers and the politics surrounding them, sex workers are a part of our neighborhoods, communities and families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A public letter from Annie Sprinkle|url=http://www.december17.org/about/from-annie-sprinkle/|work=December17.org|publisher=December17.org|accessdate=16 December 2013|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:Dec17 RedUmbrella.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Logo of the International Day to End Violence Against Sex Workers]]

==Red umbrella symbol==
The red umbrella is an important symbol for sex worker rights and is used for events that are held on December 17. The red umbrella symbol was first used by sex workers in [[Venice]], Italy in 2001. Slovenian artist Tadej Pogacar collaborated with sex workers to create the "Prostitute Pavilion" and  CODE: RED art installation for the 49th [[Venice Biennale]] of Art. Sex workers also held a street demonstration, the Red Umbrellas March, to protest inhumane work conditions and human rights abuses.&lt;ref name="Red"&gt;{{cite web|title=Under the Red Umbrella|url=http://www.sexworkeurope.org/campaigns/red-umbrella-campaigns|work=Intl. Committee on the Rights of Sex Workers in Europe (ICRSE)|publisher=Intl. Committee on the Rights of Sex Workers in Europe (ICRSE)|accessdate=22 December 2013|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Committee on the Rights of Sex Workers in Europe (ICRSE) adopted the red umbrella as a symbol of resistance to discrimination in 2005. A corresponding march was organised as the closing event to the European Conference on Sex Work, Human Rights, Labour and Migration conference, held in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]], at which almost 200 participants appeared.&lt;ref name="Red" /&gt;

'''Kurt Martin''' (31 January 1899 in [[Zurich]] – 27  January 1975 in [[Bad Wiessee]]) was a German [[art historian]].

[[File:Rubens-veronica-spinola.jpg|thumb|Rubens' ''Portrait of Marchesa Brigida Spinola Doria'', 1935, bought from van Diemen &amp; Co., Berlin]]

Martin was a  professor of [[art history]]. His career began in 1927 as [[curator]] of the {{ill|Baden State Museum Karlsruhe|de|Badisches Landesmuseum}}. From 1934 to 1956, he was director of the [[Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe|Staatlichen Kunsthalle Karlsruhe]] (National Art Gallery Karlsruhe). In 1940 he was appointed Head of the  Municipal Museums of [[Strasbourg]] as well as Chief Commissioner of the [[Alsace|Alsatian]] Museums. In 1956 he  became Director of the  Karlsruher Kunstakademie (Academy of Art Karlsruhe), and in 1957 General  Director of the [[Bayerische Staatsgemäldesammlungen|Bayerischen Staatsgemäldesammlungen]] (Bavarian State Painting Collection).

Martin was a [[Protestant]]. He was married to Dr. med. Hildegard Wangrin since 1928.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{NDB|16|281|282|Martin, Kurt|Elfriede Schulze-Battmann|116805188}} ("''Martin, Kurt", New German Biography'')&lt;/ref&gt;

== Childhood, adolescence, participation in the war and studies ==

Kurt Martin was born on January 31, 1899 in [[Zurich]], as the third son of Rudolf Martin (1864–1925), professor of [[anthropology]] from Baden, and his wife Anna Hein (1865–1940). In [[Zurich]], he attended elementary school before changing to the [[Secondary education in France|École]] Nouvelle in [[Lausanne]] and later to a [[secondary school]] in [[Karlsruhe]]. There he passed his [[Abitur]] (final secondary school examinations) in 1917. He served as a soldier in [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;Tessa Friederike Rosebrock: "Kurt Martin und das Musée des Beaux-Arts de Strasbourg. Museums- und Ausstellungspolitik im 'Dritten Reich‘ und in der unmittelbaren Nachkriegszeit", ''(Kurt Martin and the Fine Arts Museum in Strasbourg. Exhibition and Museum Policies in the Third Reich and right after the war)'' Akademie-Verlag, Berlin 2012, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920 he started his  [[philosophy]]  studies  (among  others  with [[Martin Heidegger]]  and  [[Edmund Husserl]])  and majored in [[art history]] (with [[Hans Jantzen]]) at the [[Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg|University of Freiburg]]. He completed his art studies in 1924 at the [[Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München]] with [[Heinrich Wölfflin]] (1864–1945) with his PhD thesis on the subject of "Die Nürnberger Steinplastik im 14. Jahrhundert" (The Nuremberger [[Effigy]] in the 14th century).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== 1927 - 1934: Mannheim and Badisches Landesmuseum (''Baden State Museum'') ==

Martin started his career in 1927 as a volunteer at the [[Kunsthalle Mannheim]] (''Art Gallery Mannheim'') with Gustav Friedrich Hartlaub. Soon he was appointed research assistant and subsequently [[curator]] at the Baden State Museum, [[Karlsruhe]]. In 1931 he addressed himself to the task of organizing the exhibition "German Poets as Painters and Drawers" for the Kunstverein (''art society'') [[Heidelberg]].

== Badisches Armeemuseum (''Army Museum of Baden'') ==

In the early 1930s Martin met [[Robert Heinrich Wagner|Robert Wagner]], a confidant of [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[NSDAP]] politician with whom Martin would have to do until 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Klee: "Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich". Wer war was vor und nach 1945. (''Dictionary of the people of the Third Reich. Who was who before and after 1945'') Fischer Taschenbuch Verlag, 2nd updated edition, Frankfurt am Main 2005,&amp;nbsp;{{ISBN|978-3-596-16048-8}}, p.&amp;nbsp;651, s.&amp;nbsp;a. Rosebrock: "Kurt Martin", p.&amp;nbsp;25–34&lt;/ref&gt;

In the autumn of 1933 Wagner commissioned Martin with the development and organization of an army museum of Baden. Together with the retired [[Colonel]] Erich Blankenhorn, who had just been dismissed as chief of the Badische [[Landespolizei]] (''[[State Police]] of Baden)'' by the new rulers, he built up an independent museum under the aegis of the Baden State Museum Karlsruhe (Badisches Landesmuseum).&lt;ref&gt;Vereinigung der Freunde des Wehrgeschichtlichen Museums Schloss Rastatt e.&amp;nbsp;V.

Rosebrock: "Kurt Martin", pp.&amp;nbsp;49–53&lt;/ref&gt; For this purpose premises were made available in the former stables of the [[Karlsruhe]] Palace, the residence of the State museum. On May 13, 1934 Robert Wagner and Kurt Martin inaugurated the museum with 80.000 guests and two days of celebration. Besides departments of the army of the Reich ([[Reichswehr]]) and color guards of the military associations, a row of delegations of [[National Socialist|NS]]-organizations, including [[Sturmabteilung|SA]], [[SS]] and Reich Labor Service ([[Reichsarbeitsdienst]]), marched up in the [[demilitarized zone]].&lt;ref&gt;Der Führer, edition: 13 May 1934: "Militär-Großkonzert mit Schlachtenfeuerwerk im Stadtgarten", "Der Aufmarsch am Sonntag", "Ruf an die Soldaten", "Ein Rundgang durchs Armee-Museum" (''"Grand military concert and battle fireworks in the city garden", "The deployment in sunday", "Call to the soldiers", "A tour through the Army Museum")''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Der Führer, edition: 13 May 1934,&amp;nbsp;Le Temps, 13 May 1934, p.&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;"DÉPÊCHES DE L' ÉTRANGER", s.&amp;nbsp;a. Rosebrock: "Kurt Martin", pp.&amp;nbsp;49–53&lt;/ref&gt;

In his opening speech from the balcony of the palace, Martin declared that the museum had benefited from over one thousand donations of military [[antique]]s. The museum was not only supposed to include the [[regiment]]s of Baden, but also the regiments of the earlier 15th Alsatian army corps. The museum was supposed to be a "speaking memorial, teaching everyone the military-political achievements of our frontier people. [...] Here the youth shall learn to respect and understand the achievements of their fathers."&lt;ref&gt;Badische Werkkunst, (''Art creation in Baden'') Year 1934/35, August, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–4 and Durlacher Tagblatt, edition: 14 May 1934&lt;/ref&gt; Wagner said about the purposes of the museum: "What is given to the public today in the shape of the Army Museum is nothing else than an intellectual [[:wikt:legacy|legacy]] from a time of struggling and fighting for our [[Germany]] for the struggle and fight for our [[Germany]]."&lt;ref&gt;Der Führer, edition: 13 May 1934, p. 1: "Das Badische Armeemuseum eröffnet: Ein Stützpunkt deutscher Zukunftshoffnung. Riesenkundgebung auf dem Karlsruher Schloßplatz – Reichsstatthalter Robert Wagner über die Bedeutung des Museums" ("''The Badische Armeemuseum opens: A base for german hope for the future: Great manifestation on the Schlossplatz in Karlsruhe - The Reichstatthalter Robert Wagner on the importance of the museum"'')&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, the exhibition was nothing more than a "Potemkin village". Erich Blankenhorn commented on the state of the museum on the date of the opening and said that due to the short preparation period "it was only possible to decorate the first royal stables with historically incoherent paintings and objects." For that reason the museum was closed one day after the opening.&lt;ref&gt;Vereinigung der Freunde des Wehrgeschichtlichen Museums Schloss Rastatt e.V. [ed..]: "Gang durch die Geschichte", p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1934: Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe (''National Art Gallery Karlsruhe'') ==

On July 2, 1934 Wagner appointed Martin head of the [[Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe]] (''National Art Gallery Karlsruhe''). He succeeded Hans Adolf Bühler who was loyal to the party line and whose management of the museum was characterized by a radical opposition to the so-called degenerate art.&lt;ref&gt;Rosebrock: "Kurt Martin", p.&amp;nbsp;63&lt;/ref&gt; Martin remained head of the [[Staatliche Kunsthalle]] until 1956.

=== Exhibitions 1934-1940 ===

Between 1934 and 1939 the [[Staatliche Kunsthalle]] was limited in its activities. In the years between 1934 and 1937 the orangery building of the [[botanical garden]] was remodeled in order to accommodate a special department for the [[Baden]] paintings of the late [[19th]] and [[20th]] century as from 1938. Since 1934 the department of the old [[Germans|German]] [[Masterpiece]]s had been reorganized. It was reopened to the public in 1937. Finally, the also redesigned department of the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] and [[Flemish]] painters reopened as well.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe, in Oberrheinische Kunst. Jahrbuch der oberrheinischen Museen. Jg. 8 (1939) (''Yearbook of the Museums of the Upper Rhine, 8th year''), pp. 199-203; Rosebrock loc. cit., p. 61 and 75&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1934 and 1937 several exhibitions were organized in the gallery of prints, including an exhibition about [[Hans Thoma]] in 1934 and an exhibition of the most recent acquisitions of old German masterpieces by the Staatliche Kunsthalle in 1936.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Furthermore, two travelling exhibitions were organized for the [[elementary schools]] in Baden. In 1936 an exhibition about Hans Thoma was shown in 55 locations and totaled about 90.000 visitors, and in 1937 an exhibition about [[Albrecht Dürer]] was shown in 25 locations and registered about 45.000 visitors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Between 1934 and 1937 the Staatliche Kunsthalle organized annually, among others, about forty tours for the [[Reichsarbeitsdienst]] (''Reichs Labor Service''), the organization "Kraft durch Freude" ([[Strength Through Joy|KdF]]) (''Strength Through Joy''), the [[NS-Frauenschaft]] (''Nazi women’s organization''), the sisterhood of the Red Cross and schools.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Just before the beginning of the [[war]], on July 2, 1939, the museum was reopened and back in full operation.&lt;ref&gt;Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe (Tätigkeitsbericht 1938/39 - ''activity report 1938/1939''), in Oberrheinische Kunst. Jahrbuch der oberrheinischen Museen (''Yearbook of the Upper Rhine Museums)'' Year 9, 1940, P. 226–227,  s.&amp;nbsp;a. Rosebrock: "Kurt Martin", p.&amp;nbsp;62&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time the Kunsthalle celebrated its 100th anniversary. On this occasion [[Robert Wagner]] opened a memorial exhibition for Hans Thoma showing 180 works. Besides private collectors and galleries, the [[Nationalgalerie]] (''National Gallery'') in [[Berlin]], the [[Hamburger Kunsthalle]] (''Art Gallery Hamburg'') and the Städtische Galerie Frankfurt (''Municipal Gallery Frankfurt'') contributed to this exhibition with loans. Martin meant to present Thoma as "a master of the German landscape and as a great portraitist".&lt;ref&gt;e. g. "Hans-Thoma-Schau in Karlsruhe (…) Unterredung mit Direktor Dr. Martin von der Staatlichen Kunsthalle" ''("Hans Thoma show in Karlsruhe (...) Discussion with director Dr. Martin from the Staatliche Kunsthalle")''and from 2 July 1939, p.4: "Hans-Thoma-Gedächtnis-Ausstellung in Karlsruhe. 180 auserlesene Meisterwerke – Die erste Ausstellung in Deutschland zum 100jährigen Geburtstag des Meisters" ("''Hans Thoma memorial exhibition in Karlsruhe. 180 chosen masterpieces - The first exhibition in Germany for the 100th birthday of the Master"'')&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time the newly renovated "Feuerbachsaal" was reopened to the public. It contained the German paintings of the 19th century that had been "rearranged". The [[state government]] of Baden donated a work of [[Trübner]], and the city of [[Karlsruhe]] a work of Thoma.

From 1940 on, the [[Kunsthalle]] remained closed.&lt;ref&gt;Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe, in Oberrheinische Kunst. Jahrbuch der oberrheinischen Museen. (''Yearbook of the Upper Rhine Museums)'' Year 8 (1939), p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Art acquisitions in general ===

Between 1934 and 1937 the Kunsthalle acquired 115 paintings under the direction of Martin, including works of [[Hans Thoma]], Emil Lugo and Hermann Daur.&lt;ref&gt;Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe, in Oberrheinische Kunst. Jahrbuch der oberrheinischen Museen. Jg. 8 (1939) (''Yearbook of the Museums of the Upper Rhine, 8th year''), P. 199-203. According to Rosebrock, P. 61 and 75 Martin would have closed the museum for a few years after beginning to work there. It would have been his goal to draw the public attention away from the museum through that. The renovation works therefore would only have been a pretext.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1938 to 1939 the Kunsthalle acquired 53 paintings. Martin emphasized paintings of [[Wilhelm Trübner]], [[Anselm Feuerbach]] and [[Hans Thoma]] in his account report. Among the works that were marked as "transfers" were paintings by Karl Buchholz, Hermann Burte, [[Joseph Fratrel]] and [[Adolph von Menzel]]. At the same time the Kunsthalle acquired 175 drawings, 636 graphic print works and four sketchbooks. Regarding the drawings, Martin emphasized eight sheets by [[Ferdinand Kobell]], three by [[Franz Kobell]] and nine by [[Wilhelm Trübner]], as well as – a gift of the NSDAP-Gauleitung of Baden – the "valuable early drawing of [[Hans Thoma]], Schönau im Wiesental (Schönau in the valley of Wiesen)".&lt;ref&gt;Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe (Tätigkeitsbericht 1938/39 - activity report 1938/1939), in Oberrheinische Kunst. Jahrbuch der oberrheinischen Museen. (''Yearbook of the Upper Rhine'') Year 9, 1940, P. 226–227, Rosebrock: "Kurt Martin", P. 61–64&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, the collection of the Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe "was enriched by a few works mainly by artists from Baden". For example, the museum acquired paintings from Albert Lang, Fritz Boehle, [[Ferdinand Keller (painter)|Ferdinand Keller]], Ernst Württemberger, and Eduard Hunziker, and several drawings by [[Hans Thoma]] and [[Ferdinand Keller (painter)|Ferdinand Keller]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe, in Oberrheinische Kunst. Jahrbuch der oberrheinischen Museen. (''Yearbook of the Upper Rhine Museum)'' Year 8 (1939), S. 199-203.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his activities report for the year 1940, Martin wrote: "The General Administration managed to accomplish a few essential acquisitions for the public museums which will be reported about later in context."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Art acquisition from Jewish collections ===

The Kunsthalle Karlsruhe continuously took over art works from originally Jewish property. In a statement from 1947, Martin listed about 100 works, including works from the collections of [[Richard Lenel]], Mannheim (one work), Benno Weil, Mannheim (one work), Siegfried Reiss, Mannheim (44 works), Arthur Levis, Karlsruhe (one work), E. Reiss, Heidelberg (three works), Paul Homburger, Karlsruhe (three works), [[Ettlinger]], Karlsruhe (one work),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ehre: "Monument Man" in Karlsruhe {{!}} Jüdische Allgmeine|url = http://www.juedische-allgemeine.de/article/view/id/18414|website = www.juedische-allgemeine.de|accessdate = 2015-06-10|first = "Monument Man in Karlsruhe", from the Jüdische Allegmeine, February 18th, 2014|last = Article from Georg Patzer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klara Goldschmit, Karlsruhe, Salomon, Karlsruhe (one work), Ernst Gallinek, Baden Baden (16 works and a porcelain collection including more than 400 objects)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.lostart.de/Webs/EN/Datenbank/EinzelobjektFund.html?cms_param=EOBJ_ID%3D407997%26_page%3D0%26_sort%3Dperson_en%26_anchor%3Did4442|title = Lost Art Database|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = See|first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Violetta von Waldberg, Heidelberg (wife of [[Max von Waldberg]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = German Website of the Historical Society of Heidelberg (Heidelberger Geschichtsverein e.V.) on the life of Max von Waldberg|url = http://www.s197410804.online.de/Personen/WaldbergM.htm|website = www.s197410804.online.de|accessdate = 2015-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; (four works). The Kunsthalle took over these works from other State authorities that had expropriated the previous owners. Most of the works mentioned by Martin were transferred to the Kunsthalle from authorities, partly against payment. The Kunsthalle acquired 20 works on its own initiative from an "Auction Sale of Jewish Property 6th-9th August 1941 in Karlsruhe".&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Martin: ''Verzeichnis der von der Staatlichen Kunsthalle Karlsruhe seit 1933 aus jüdischen Besitz erworbenen Gemälde, Zeichnungen und druckgraphische Blätter''. Karlsruhe, 28. Januar 1947 (''Register of the paintings acquired by the Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe) from jewish property since 1933''. In: US-NARA, RG 260, M1947. Textual records created at the Wiesbaden Central Collecting Point. Roll 1. General Records. Art Intelligence: Kunsthalle.

Badischer Kunstverein Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe 1987 (''Art society of Baden''), P. 139, 155. and Rosebrock: "Kurt Martin", P. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, Kurt Martin acquired the work ''Portrait of the Marchesa Veronica Spinola Doria'' by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] for 63.000 Reichsmark at the liquidation auction of the gallery van Diemen &amp; Co. GmbH.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Graupe (Editor): ''Die Bestände der Firmen [[Eduard Plietzsch|Galerie van Diemen &amp; Co.]]GmbH – Altkunst, Antiquitäten, GmbH: beide in Liquidation''; II.

In 2000 a new compensation was claimed without success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe (State Art Gallery of Karlsruhe)|url = http://www.lootedart.com/MFEU4D92814_print%25253bY|website = www.lootedart.com|accessdate = 2015-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This acquisition was not mentioned in the report for the years 1934 until 1937.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== 1940 - 1944: "Oberrheinische" museums ("''Upper Rhine" museums'') ===
With the occupation of [[Alsatia]], Robert Wagner became chief of the Alsatian [[Civilian]] [[Administration (government)|Administration]] and had complete political freedom. It was his main objective to ensure that Alsatia become "German" again, in particular that [[Strasbourg]] become the "preeminent first cultural center of the [[German Reich]]".&lt;ref&gt;Rosebrock: "Kurt Martin", P.&amp;nbsp;30–34&lt;/ref&gt; He pursued this goal in the performing arts by founding several theatres and establishing German libraries.&lt;ref&gt;Lothar Kettenacker: "Nationalsozialistische Volkstumspolitik im Elsaß", Stuttgart 1973, P.&amp;nbsp;180–183 ''(Nazi Nation Politics in Alsatia'')&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, he prohibited the use of the French language in public and Germanized all toponyms.&lt;ref&gt;Kettenacker: a.&amp;nbsp;a.&amp;nbsp;O., P.&amp;nbsp;74&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurt Martin was responsible for the museums and helped Wagner prepare his "vision of a cultural model-district Alsatia-Baden".&lt;ref&gt;Rosebrock: "Kurt Martin", P.&amp;nbsp;83f&lt;/ref&gt;

=== State representative for the museums in Alsatia ===
[[File:Master of Frankfurt 002.jpg|thumb|NK 2556: Master of Frankfurt – ''St. Christopherus'', 1942, bought from Paul Cassirer, Amsterdam]]
On November 17, 1940, as "State Representative for the Museums in Alsatia", Martin describes the initial situation in [[Strasbourg]] in the light of the new political realities in an article about the future of the museums in "our land at the Upper Rhine": In the city, the Palais Rohan&lt;ref&gt;The Archeological Museum (Musée Archéologique), the Decorative Arts Museum (Musée des Arts décoratifs), the Graphic and Print Museum (Cabinet des estampes et dessins) and the Museum of Fine Arts (Musée des Beaux-arts) were located in the Palais Rohan.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Frauenhausmuseum]] unite the architecture of the Middle Ages and the 18th century in a "unique way in Germany". This unity is also reflected in the museums' inventories. Martin aimed especially at the development of museums as places of national education with a regional and local focus.

With this scope in mind, Martin aimed at the expansion of the Strasbourg collection "on [[Europe]]an grounds". He wanted to develop the collection as a collection of European significance.&lt;ref&gt;Der Führer, Sonderausgabe (''Special Edition'') 17.11.1940, "Museen am Oberrhein" (''Museums of the Upper Rhine'')&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Director of the Municipal Museums of Strasbourg and Chief Commissioner of the Upper Rhine Museums ===
At the instigation of Wagner, Martin became director of the Municipal Museums of Strasbourg.&lt;ref&gt;Rosebrock: "Kurt Martin", P. 90&lt;/ref&gt; He also kept his position in Karlsruhe. As of April 1, 1941 he became the Director of the General Administration of the Upper Rhine Museums, thus of all museums in Baden and Alsatia.

=== Purchase of art in the Netherlands ===
From 1941 to 1944, Martin purchased about 40 paintings and a series of other objet d'arts in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Distilled overview by Rosebrock: "Kurt Martin", P. 125 Remark number 171, above all P. 147–160 and P. 170&lt;/ref&gt; Some works with Dutch provenance, which Martin purchased, are part of the Dutch art collection (NK Collection) today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.herkomstgezocht.nl/eng/nkcollectie/index.html NK-Collection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924025801/http://www.herkomstgezocht.nl/eng/nkcollectie/index.html |date=2015-09-24 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the database of the NK Collection, the following purchases of Martin are listed:

Kurt Martin was able to reintegrate his position as director of the [[Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe]] immediately in the summer of 1945, especially because Walter W. Horn, officers from the French Art Protection and his former French colleagues from Strasbourg confirmed his great integrity and qualification. Martin supported the French and American authorities in locating and rescuing the artworks that had been stored for purposes of protection during wartime.&lt;ref&gt;Rosebrock: "Kurt Martin", P.&amp;nbsp;253–261&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946 he co-founded the [[International Council of Museums]] and remained director of the German National Committee for 15 years. From 1948 until shortly before his death in 1975, he was a member of the administrative board of the Germanic National Museum in [[Nuremberg]].&lt;ref name="Elfriede Schulze-Battmann 1990"&gt;Elfriede Schulze-Battmann:&amp;nbsp;''Martin, Kurt.''&amp;nbsp;In:&amp;nbsp;''Neue Deutsche Biographie''&amp;nbsp;(NDB). ''(New German Biography)'' Volume&amp;nbsp;16, Duncker &amp; Humblot, Berlin 1990, {{ISBN|3-428-00197-4}}, S.&amp;nbsp;281&amp;nbsp;f. (Digitalisat).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947  he was already able to exhibit masterpieces of the museum in [[Saint Gall|St. Gall.]] In 1951 he reopened the museum in Karlsruhe. He added a pedagogical department to the museum, which was a novel idea at the time. In 1948 he curated an exhibition of German art for the [[Federal Foreign Office]], which was shown in several cities in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Rosebrock: "Kurt Martin", P. 332f&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950 he organized the exhibition ''Des maîtres de Cologne à Albrecht Dürer'' showing works of old German masters in Paris. He initiated the exhibition ''German watercolors, drawings and prints: A midcentury review'', which was shown by the German government in the US in 1956. Martin was one of the co-founders of the ''[[documenta]]'' in [[Kassel]], an exhibition for contemporary art that took place for the first in time 1956. He was a member of the documenta-council for many years.&lt;ref name="Elfriede Schulze-Battmann 1990"/&gt;

In 1956 he became director of the Academy of Art Karlsruhe. In 1957 he transferred to [[Munich]], succeeding Ernst Buchner in the General Direction of the [[Bayerische Staatsgemäldesammlungen]] (''Bavarian State Painting Collections''). He retired in 1964. In Munich, Martin was responsible for the establishment of several museum branches in different cities in Bavaria. He also promoted the extension of the Munich Museum collections to contemporary art works.

== Appreciation ==
Kurt Martin was one of the leading museum directors of his time.&lt;ref&gt;Christiane Fork:&amp;nbsp;''Martin, Kurt''. In:&amp;nbsp;''Metzler Kunsthistoriker Lexikon. Zweihundertzehn Porträts deutschsprachiger Autoren aus vier Jahrhunderten.''&amp;nbsp;(''Metzler Dictionary of Art Historians. Two hundred portraits of German authors from four centuries'') 2nd edition. Metzler, Stuttgart 1999, P. 276&lt;/ref&gt;

He had a wide range of research interests. He published several articles about the art of the Middle Ages and Renaissance, the French painters of the 19th century and modern art.

In 1963 he received the Bavarian order of merit and in 1964 he was appointed to Dr.-Ing. e.h. by the TH Karlsruhe.

In some instances a wrongful conviction is not overturned for several decades, or until after the innocent person has been [[wrongful execution|executed]], released from custody, or has died.

"Miscarriage of justice" is sometimes synonymous with wrongful conviction, referring to a conviction reached in an unfair or disputed [[trial (law)|trial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Miscarriage of Justice Law and Legal Definition |url=https://definitions.uslegal.com/m/miscarriage-of-justice/ |accessdate=2018-11-05 |publisher=definitions.uslegal.com |quote=The term 'miscarriage of justice' refers to a legal act or verdict that is clearly mistaken, unfair, or improper. Primarily, a miscarriage of justice is the [[conviction]] and [[punishment]] of a person for a crime they did not commit.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wrongful convictions are frequently cited by death penalty opponents as cause to eliminate death penalties to avoid executing innocent persons. In recent years, [[genetic fingerprinting|DNA evidence]] has been used to clear many people falsely convicted.

The [[Scandinavian language]]s (viz. Danish, Norwegian and Swedish) have a word, the Swedish variant of which is ''justitiemord'', which literally translates as "justice murder." The term exists in several languages and was originally used for cases where the accused was convicted, executed, and later cleared after death. While a miscarriage of justice is a [[Type I error]] for falsely identifying culpability, an [[error of impunity]] would be a [[Type II error]] of failing to find a culpable person guilty. However, the term "miscarriage of justice" is often used to describe the latter type as well.

With capital punishment decreasing, the expression has acquired an extended meaning, namely any conviction for a crime not committed by the convicted. The retention of the term "murder" represents both universal abhorrence against wrongful convictions and awareness of how destructive wrongful convictions are. Some [[Slavic language]]s have also the word (''justičná vražda'' in Slovak, ''justiční vražda'' in Czech) which literally translates as "justice murder", but it is used for [[Judicial murder]], while miscarriage of justice is "justiční omyl" in Czech, implying an error of the justice system, not a deliberate manipulation.

The term '''{{vanchor|travesty of justice}}''' is sometimes used for a gross, deliberate miscarriage of justice. [[Show trial]]s (not in the sense of high publicity, but in the sense of lack of regard to the actual legal procedure and fairness), due to their character, often lead to such travesties.

The concept of miscarriage of justice has important implications for [[standard of review]], in that an [[appellate court]] will often only exercise its discretion to correct plain error when a miscarriage of justice (or "manifest injustice") would otherwise occur.

==General issues==
Causes of miscarriages of justice include:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Safety from False Convictions|last=Sangero|first=Boaz|publisher=CreateSpace|year=2016|isbn=978-1536823738|location=United States|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Plea bargain]]s that offer incentives for the innocent to plead guilty, sometimes called an [[innocent prisoner's dilemma]]
* [[Confirmation bias]] on the part of investigators
* Withholding or [[destruction of evidence]] by police or [[prosecutor|prosecution]]
* Fabrication of evidence or outright [[perjury]] by police (see [[testilying]]), or prosecution witnesses (e.g., [[Charles Randal Smith]])
* Biased editing of evidence
* Prejudice against the class of people to which the defendant belongs
* [[Mistaken identity|Misidentification]] of the perpetrator by witnesses and/or victims
* Overestimation/underestimation of the evidential value of [[expert witness|expert testimony]]
* [[Contaminated evidence]]
* Faulty [[forensic science|forensic]] tests
* [[False confession]]s due to police pressure or psychological weakness
* Misdirection of a jury by a judge during trial
* [[perjury|Perjured]] evidence by the real guilty party or their accomplices ([[frameup]])
* Perjured evidence by the alleged victim or their accomplices
* Conspiracy between court of appeal judges and prosecutors to uphold conviction of the innocent

A risk of miscarriages of justice is one of the main arguments against the death penalty. Where condemned persons are executed promptly after conviction, the most significant effect of a miscarriage of justice is irreversible. Wrongly executed people nevertheless occasionally receive posthumous [[pardon]]s—which essentially [[void (law)|void]] the conviction—or have their convictions quashed. Many death penalty states hold condemned persons for ten or more years before execution, so that any new evidence that might acquit them (or, at least, provide [[reasonable doubt]]) will have had time to surface.

Even when a wrongly convicted person is not executed, years in prison can have a substantial, irreversible effect on the person and their family. The risk of miscarriage of justice is therefore also an argument against long sentences, like a life sentence, and cruel prison conditions.

The [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] requires the victims of miscarriage of justice to be compensated.&lt;ref&gt;[[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], Article 14, 6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rate of occurrence== 
Various studies estimate that in the United States, between 2.3 and 5% of all prisoners are innocent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How many innocent people are there in prison? |publisher=[[The Innocence Project]] |url=http://www.innocenceproject.org/Content/How_many_innocent_people_are_there_in_prison.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110182624/http://www.innocenceproject.org/Content/How_many_innocent_people_are_there_in_prison.php |dead-url=true |archivedate=2014-11-10 |accessdate=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study estimated that up to 10,000 people may be wrongfully convicted of serious crimes each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/ronhuff.htm|title=10,000 INNOCENT PEOPLE CONVICTED EACH YEAR, STUDY ESTIMATES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 study estimated that 4.1% of inmates awaiting execution on death row in the United States are innocent, and that at least 340 innocent people may have been executed since 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/many-prisoners-on-death-row-are-wrongfully-convicted/|title=Many Prisoners on Death Row are Wrongfully Convicted|author=Dina Fine Maron|work=Scientific American}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Professor Boaz Sangero of the College of Law and Business in [[Ramat Gan]] in Israel, most wrongful convictions are for crimes less serious than major felonies such as rape and murder, as judicial systems are less careful in dealing with those cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/.premium-1.589646|title=How You Could Land in Jail for Committing No Crime|work=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural consequences===
Wrongful convictions appear at first to be "rightful" arrests and subsequent convictions, and also include a public statement about a particular crime having occurred, as well as a particular individual or individuals having committed that crime. If the conviction turns out to be a miscarriage of justice, then one or both of these statements is ultimately deemed to be false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Edmond|first=G.|title=Constructing Miscarriages of Justice: Misunderstanding Scientific Evidence in High Profile Criminal Appeals|journal=Oxford Journal of Legal Studies|year=2002|volume=22|issue=1|pages=53–89|doi=10.1093/ojls/22.1.53}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time between the miscarriage of justice and its correction, the public holds false beliefs about the occurrence of a crime, the perpetrator of a crime, or both. While the public audience of a miscarriage of justice certainly varies, they may in some cases be as large as an entire nation or multitude of nations.

In cases where a large-scale audience is unknowingly witness to a miscarriage of justice, the news-consuming public may develop false beliefs about the nature of crime itself. It may also cause the public to falsely believe that certain types of crime exist, or that certain types of people tend to commit these crimes, or that certain crimes are more commonly prevalent than they actually are. Thus, wrongful convictions can ultimately mold a society's popular beliefs about crime. Because our understanding of crime is socially constructed, it has been shaped by many factors other than its actual occurrence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rafter|first=N.|title=The Social Construction of Crime and Crime Control|journal=Journal of Research on Crime and Delinquency|year=1990|volume=27|issue=4|pages=376–389|doi=10.1177/0022427890027004004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mass media may also be faulted for distorting the public perception of crime by over-representing certain races and genders as criminals and victims, and for highlighting more sensational and invigorating types of crimes as being more newsworthy. The way a media presents crime-related issues may have an influence not only on a society's fear of crime but also on its beliefs about the causes of criminal behavior and desirability of one or another approach to crime control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Haney|first=C.|title=Death by Design: Capital Punishment as a Social Psychological System|year=2005|publisher=Oxford: Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, this may have a significant impact on critical public beliefs about emerging forms of crime such as cybercrime, global crime, and terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Manning|first=P.K.|title=Policing Contingencies|year=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are unfavorable psychological effects, even in the absence of any public knowledge. In an experiment, participants significantly reduced their pro-social behavior after being wrongfully sanctioned. As a consequence there were negative effects for the entire group.&lt;ref&gt;Grechenig, Nicklisch &amp; Thoeni, Punishment Despite Reasonable Doubt – A Public Goods Experiment with Sanctions under Uncertainty, Journal of Empirical Legal Studies (JELS) 2010, vol. 7 (4), p. 847-867 [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1733792 (ssrn).]&lt;/ref&gt; The extent of wrongful sanctions varies between societies.&lt;ref&gt;Herrmann, Benedikt, Christian Thöni, and Simon Gächter.

===Canada===
In 1959, 14-year-old [[Steven Truscott]] was convicted of raping and murdering a 12-year-old girl. Originally sentenced to death by [[hanging]], his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. He was released on parole in 1969, and was freed from his parole restrictions in 1974. In 2007, the [[Ontario Court of Appeal]] overturned Truscott's conviction, based on a reexamination of forensic evidence.&lt;ref name="Truscott"&gt;{{cite journal|last=The Associated Press|title=Canadian Court Overturns 1959 Murder Verdict|journal=The New York Times|date=August 29, 2007|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government of Ontario awarded him [[Canadian dollar|$]]6.5&amp;nbsp;million in compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca/english/news/2008/20080707-truscott-nr.asp|title=Newsroom : Results|website=attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, [[Donald Marshall Jr.]], a [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]] man, was wrongly convicted of murder.

In 1992, [[Guy Paul Morin]] was convicted of the 1984 rape and murder of an 8-year-old girl and was sentenced to life imprisonment. In 1995, new testing of DNA evidence showed Morin could not have been the murderer, and the Ontario Court of Appeal overturned his conviction.&lt;ref name=canenc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/guy-paul-morin-case/|website=The Canadian Encyclopedia|publisher=Historica Canada|accessdate=2016-02-26|title=Guy Paul Morin Case}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case has been described as "a compendium of official error – from inaccurate eyewitness testimony and police tunnel vision, to scientific bungling and the suppression of evidence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Makin|first1=Kirk|title=Guy Paul Morin Case|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/guy-paul-morin-case/|website=The Canadian Encyclopedia|publisher=Historica Canada|accessdate=2016-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morin received [[Canadian dollar|$]]1.25&amp;nbsp;million in compensation from the Ontario government.&lt;ref name=canenc/&gt;

===Italy===
[[Enzo Tortora]], a TV host on national RAI television, was accused of being a member of the Camorra and drug trafficking.  He was arrested in 1983, and sentenced to ten years in jail in 1985, but acquitted of all charges on appeal in 1986.&lt;ref name=flo301008&gt;[http://www.theflorentine.net/articles/article-view.asp?issuetocId=3705 Enzo Tortora: When justice miscarries], The Florentine, October 30, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Raffaele Sollecito and American [[Amanda Knox]] were sentenced to 26 years imprisonment for the 2007 [[Murder of Meredith Kercher]].  They were released in 2011 after an appeal court found there was no credible evidence against them.  Petty burglar Rudy Guede has been convicted of murder and sexual assault in connection with the death of Ms. Kercher.

===The Netherlands===
The Schiedammerpark murder case, as well as the similarly overturned case of the Putten murder, led to the installation of the "Posthumus I committee", which analyzed what had gone wrong in the Schiedammerpark Murder case, and came to the conclusion that [[confirmation bias]] led the police to ignore and misinterpret scientific evidence (DNA). Subsequently, the so-called Posthumus II committee investigated whether other such cases might have occurred. The committee received 25 applications from concerned and involved scientists, and decided to consider three of them further: the [[Lucia de Berk]] case, the Ina Post case, and the Enschede incest case. In these three cases, independent researchers (professors [[Willem Albert Wagenaar|Wagenaar]], van Koppen, Israëls, Crombag, and Derksen) claim confirmation bias and misuse of complex scientific evidence led to miscarriages of justice.

===Norway===
Norwegian police, courts, and prison authorities have been criticized and convicted on several occasions by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] for breaking the principle of [[innocent until proven guilty]]. However, the maximum penalty in Norway is normally no longer than 21 years. Thereby, most of the victims have been acquitted after their release from prison.

===Poland===
On December 31, 1996 in Miłoszyce, Poland, a 15-year-old girl was brutally raped and murdered. Tomasz Komenda, then 21, was arrested. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment. Komenda was regularly abused by fellow prisoners and guards, he tried to commit suicide 3 times. In 2018 when new evidence came out, Komenda was paroled and in May 2018 his conviction was overturned and Komenda was oficially exonerated by the [[Supreme Court of Poland]]. He and his barrister stated, that they would demand 18 000 000 PLN compensation.

===Spain===
The [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|Constitution of Spain]] guarantees compensation in cases of miscarriage of justice.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom a jailed person, whose conviction is quashed, might be paid [[Damages|compensation]] for the time they were incarcerated. This is currently limited by statute to a maximum sum of £1,000,000 for those who have been incarcerated for more than ten years and £500,000 for any other cases&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/23/britain-refusing-compensate-victims-miscarriage-justice|title=Why is Britain refusing to compensate victims of miscarriage of justice?|publisher=Duncan Campbell, The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;, with deductions for the cost of food and prison cell during that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/man-wrongly-jailed-for-three-years-charged-7000-by-home-office-for-board-and-lodging-6585803.html|title=Man wrongly jailed for three years charged £7,000 by Home Office for 'board and lodging'|work=London Evening Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[:Category:Overturned convictions in the United Kingdom|Overturned convictions in the United Kingdom]].

Richard Foster, the Chairman of the [[Criminal Cases Review Commission]] (CCRC), reported in October 2018 that the single biggest cause of miscarriage of justice was the failure to disclose vital evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/oct/11/failure-disclose-evidence-miscarriage-justice-warning-criminal-cases-review-commission|title=Failure to disclose vital evidence in criminal cases growing, says watchdog|last=Bowcott|first=Owen|date=2018-10-11|website=The Guardian|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====England, Wales and Northern Ireland====
Until 2005, the parole system assumed all convicted persons were guilty, and poorly handled those who were not. To be paroled, a convicted person had to sign a document in which, among other things, they confessed to the crime for which they were convicted. Someone who refused to sign this declaration spent longer in jail than someone who signed it. Some wrongly convicted people, such as the [[Birmingham Six]], were refused parole for this reason. In 2005 the system changed, and began to parole prisoners who never admitted guilt.

English law has no official means of correcting a "perverse" verdict (conviction of a defendant on the basis of insufficient evidence). Appeals are based exclusively on new evidence or errors by the judge or prosecution (but not the defence), or jury irregularities. A reversal occurred, however, in the 1930s when [[William Herbert Wallace]] was exonerated of the murder of his wife. There is no right to a trial ''without'' jury (except during the troubles in Northern Ireland or in the case where there is a significant risk of jury-tampering, such as organised crime cases, when a judge or judges presided without a jury).

During the early 1990s, a series of high-profile cases turned out to be miscarriages of justice. Many resulted from police fabricating evidence to convict people they thought were guilty, or simply to get a high conviction rate. The [[West Midlands Serious Crime Squad]] became notorious for such practices, and was disbanded in 1989. In 1997 the [[Criminal Cases Review Commission]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccrc.gov.uk|title=Criminal Cases Review Commission|publisher=Government of the United Kingdom|accessdate=2009-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; was established specifically to examine possible miscarriages of justice. However, it still requires either strong new evidence of innocence, or new proof of a legal error by the judge or prosecution. For example, merely insisting you are innocent and the jury made an error, or stating there was not enough evidence to prove guilt, is not enough. It is not possible to question the jury's decision or query on what matters it was based. The waiting list for cases to be considered for review is at least two years on average.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

In 2002, the NI Court of Appeal made an exception to who could avail of the right to a fair trial in R v Walsh: ''"... if a defendant has been denied a fair trial it will almost be inevitable that the conviction will be regarded unsafe, the present case in our view constitutes an exception to the general rule. ... the conviction is to be regarded as safe, even if a breach of Article 6(1) were held to have occurred in the present case."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courtsni.gov.uk/en-GB/Judicial+Decisions/JanJune02/j_j_car3538final.htm|title=Appeal Court Judgment}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Christy Walsh (Case)]].)

====Scotland====
The [[Criminal Appeal (Scotland) Act 1927]] increased the jurisdiction of the [[Scottish Court of Criminal Appeal]] following the miscarriage of justice surrounding the [[Trial of Oscar Slater]].

Reflecting [[Scots law|Scotland's own legal system]], which differs from that of the rest of the United Kingdom, the [[Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission]] (SCCRC) was established in April 1999. All cases accepted by the SCCRC are subjected to a robust and thoroughly impartial review before a decision on whether or not to refer to the [[High Court of Justiciary]] is taken.

In June 2012, the [[National Registry of Exonerations]], a joint project of the University of Michigan Law School and Northwestern University Law School, initially reported 873 individual exonerations in the U.S. from January 1989 through February 2012; the report called this number "tiny" in a country with [[United States incarceration rate|2.3&amp;nbsp;million people in prisons and jails]], but asserted that there are far more false convictions than exonerations.&lt;ref name=UMichLaw20120622&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Documents/exonerations_us_1989_2012_full_report.pdf |title=Exonerations in the United States, 1989 – 2012 / Report by the National Registry of Exonerations |last1=Gross |first1=Samuel R. |last2=Shaffer |first2=Michael |date=June 22, 2012 |publisher=University of Michigan Law School |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6LfYUz1vy?url=http://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Documents/exonerations_us_1989_2012_full_report.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-06 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2015, the number of individual exonerations was reported as 1,733, with 2015 having the highest annual number of exonerations since 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/13/opinion/prisoners-exonerated-prosecutors-exposed.html|title=Prisoners Exonerated, Prosecutors Exposed|last=The Editorial Board|date=2016-02-12|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-05-10|issn=0362-4331|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6twgj2OlI?url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/13/opinion/prisoners-exonerated-prosecutors-exposed.html|archivedate=2017-10-03|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of Joseph Roger O'Dell III, executed in Virginia in 1997 for a rape and murder, a prosecuting attorney bluntly argued in court in 1998 that if posthumous DNA results exonerated O'Dell, "it would be shouted from the rooftops that ... Virginia executed an innocent man." The state prevailed, and the evidence was destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Lois Romano, "[http://www.truthinjustice.org/DNA-DP.htm When DNA Meets Death Row, It's the System That's Tested]", ''[[The Washington Post]]'', December 12, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970 there was a series of criminal prosecutions in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] against various members of the [[Black Panther Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F2/427/427.F2d.239.772.34604.html |title=427 F.2d 239 |publisher=Bulk.resource.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The charges ranged from criminal conspiracy to felony murder.  All indictments stemmed from the murder of 19-year-old Alex Rackley in the early hours of May 21, 1969.  The trials became a rallying-point for the [[American Left]], and marked a decline in public support, even among the black community, for the Black Panther Party.

==The crime==
On May 19, 1969, members of the [[Black Panther Party]] kidnapped fellow Panther [[Alex Rackley]], who had fallen under suspicion of informing for the FBI.  He was held captive at the New Haven Panther headquarters on Orchard Street, where he was tortured and interrogated for two days until he confessed. His interrogation was tape recorded by the Panthers.&lt;ref name=tape&gt;Paul Bass, [http://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/rackley_trial_tape_surfaces/ Black Panther Torture “Trial” Tape Surfaces], New Haven Independent, Feb 21, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  During that time, national party chairman [[Bobby Seale]] visited New Haven and spoke on the campus of [[Yale University]] for the Yale Black Ensemble Theater Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/?id=4-ICAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA52 | title = New York Magazine | author1 = New York Media | first1 = LLC | date = 1970-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After his speech, Seale briefly stopped by the headquarters where Rackley was being held captive, though it was never proven that he went inside or knew about Rackley's treatment.

Early the next day, three Panthers - [[Warren Kimbro]], [[Lonnie McLucas]], and national Panther "Field Marshal" [[George Sams, Jr.]] - drove Rackley to the nearby town of [[Middlefield, Connecticut]].  Kimbro shot Rackley once in the head and McLucas shot him once in the chest.  They dumped his corpse in the [[Coginchaug River]], where it was discovered the next day.

Police raided the Panther headquarters, eventually arresting nine [[New Haven]] area Black Panthers (in addition to two juveniles).   McLucas and Sams were captured later.

Sams and Kimbro confessed to the murder, and agreed to testify against McLucas in exchange for a reduction in sentence.  Sams also implicated Seale in the killing, telling his interrogators that while visiting the Panther headquarters on the night of his speech, Seale had directly ordered him to murder Rackley.  In all, nine defendants were indicted on charges related to the case.  In the heated political rhetoric of the day, these defendants were referred to as the "New Haven Nine", a deliberate allusion to other ''cause-celebre'' defendants like the "[[Chicago Seven]]".

==Protest and unrest==
The first trial was that of Lonnie McLucas, the only person who physically took part in the killing who refused to plead guilty.  In fact, McLucas had confessed to shooting Rackley, but since some of the charges brought against him made him eligible for the [[death penalty]], a not-guilty plea was the only logical trial strategy.

Jury selection began in May 1970.  The case and trial were already a national ''cause célèbre'' among critics of the Nixon administration, and especially among those hostile to the actions of the [[FBI]].  Under the Bureau's then-secret "Counter-Intelligence Program" ([[COINTELPRO]]), FBI director [[J. Edgar Hoover]] had ordered his agents to disrupt, discredit, or otherwise neutralize radical groups like the Panthers.  Hostility between groups organizing political dissent and the Bureau was, by the time of the trials, at a fever pitch.  Hostility from the left was also directed at the two Panthers cooperating with the prosecutors.  Sams in particular, never widely popular in the movement, was accused of being an informant, and lying to implicate Seale to hide his own complicity with the FBI.

Beginning with the pretrial proceedings, tens of thousands of supporters of the Panthers arrived in New Haven individually and in organized groups.  They were housed and fed by community organizations and by sympathetic Yale students in their dormitory rooms. The Yale college dining halls provided basic meals for everyone.  Protesters met daily ''en masse'' on the [[New Haven Green]] across the street from the Courthouse (and one hundred yards from Yale's main gate) to hear protest speakers. Among the speakers were [[Jean Genet]], [[Benjamin Spock]], [[Abbie Hoffman]], [[Jerry Rubin]], and [[John Froines]] (an assistant professor of chemistry at the University of Oregon).  Teach-ins and other events were also held in the colleges themselves.

Towards midnight on May 1, two bombs exploded in Yale's [[Ingalls Rink]], where a concert was being held in conjunction with the protests.&lt;ref name="BassRae"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bass |first1=Paul |last2=Rae |first2=Douglas |authorlink2=Douglas W. Rae |title=Murder in the Model City: The Black Panthers, Yale, and the Redemption of a Killer |publisher=Basic Books |year=2006 |pages=159–160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the rink was damaged, no one was injured, and no culprit was identified.&lt;ref name="BassRae"/&gt;

Yale chaplain [[William Sloane Coffin]] stated, "All of us conspired to bring on this tragedy by law enforcement agencies by their illegal acts against the Panthers, and the rest of us by our immoral silence in front of these acts," while Yale President [[Kingman Brewster Jr.]] issued the statement, "I personally want to say that I'm appalled and ashamed that things should have come to such a pass that I am skeptical of the ability of Black revolutionaries to achieve a fair trial anywhere in the U.S."  Brewster's generally sympathetic tone enraged many of the university's older, more conservative alumni, heightening tensions within the school community.

As tensions mounted, Yale officials sought to avoid deeper unrest and to deflect the real possibility of riots or violent student demonstrations.  [[Sam Chauncey]] has been credited with winning tactical management on behalf of the administration to quell anxiety among law enforcement and New Haven's citizens, while [[Kurt Schmoke]], a future [[Rhodes Scholar]], mayor of [[Baltimore, MD]] and Dean of [[Howard University]] School of Law, has received kudos as undergraduate spokesman to the faculty during some of the protest's tensest moments. Ralph Dawson, a classmate of Schmoke's, figured prominently as moderator of the Black Student Alliance at Yale (BSAY).

In the end, compromises between the administration and the students quashed the possibility of violence. While Yale (and many other colleges) went "on strike" from May Day until the end of the term, like most schools it was not actually "shut down".   Classes were made "voluntarily optional" for the time and students were graded "Pass/Fail" for the work done up to then.

==Trials==

McLucas's trial set new records for the scale of judicial proceedings in Connecticut. It was the first in Connecticut to have [[metal detector]]s installed at the courtroom doors; jury selection took six weeks, a Connecticut record, and the jury deliberated for six days, another Connecticut record.&lt;ref name="panthers2.htm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edwardjayepstein.com/archived/panthers2.htm |title=Edward Jay Epstein's Home Page |publisher=Edwardjayepstein.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite impassioned accusations from protesters that McLucas was being railroaded into the electric chair by a "racist jury,"&lt;ref&gt;Black, Jonathan, "How do you try a revolutionary? A Black Panther trial in New Haven," ''Village Voice'', July 23, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; the jurors (ten white, two black) acquitted him on the most severe charges, convicting him instead on the sole charge of conspiracy to commit murder.  His defense attorney declared, "The judge was fair, the jury was fair, and, in this case, a black revolutionary was given a fair trial."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,902777,00.html Justice In New Haven]," in ''Time'' Magazine, September 14, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;  McLucas was sentenced to twelve to fifteen years in prison.  His two collaborators in the murder, who had  pleaded to second degree murder, were released after four years.&lt;ref name="panthers2.htm"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edwardjayepstein.com/archived/panthers.htm |title=Edward Jay Epstein's Home Page |publisher=Edwardjayepstein.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FTR-bobbyseale.HTML"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gadflyonline.com/8-6-01/FTR-bobbyseale.HTML |title=Gadfly Online |publisher=Gadfly Online |date= |accessdate=2013-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October, 1970, [[Bobby Seale]] went on trial alongside [[Ericka Huggins]], founder of the New Haven chapter.  This trial was an even larger undertaking, involving a full four months of jury selection.  Seale's attorney emphasized that it was only Sams' testimony that tied Seale to Rackley's murder. Huggins's voice was heard on a tape recording of the victim's interrogation, played for the jury. Her lawyer argued that Huggins had been acting under duress.&lt;ref name="tape"/&gt; The jury was unable to reach a verdict, deadlocked 11 to 1 for Seale's acquittal and 10 to 2 for Huggins' acquittal. On May 25, 1971 Judge Harold Mulvey stunned courtroom spectators by dismissing the charges against Huggins and Seale saying, "I find it impossible to believe that an unbiased jury could be selected without superhuman efforts -- efforts which this court, the state and these defendants should not be called upon either to make or to endure".&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, March 1, 2000 [https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/01/nyregion/harold-m-mulvey-86-judge-at-tense-black-panther-trials.html Harold M. Mulvey, Judge at Tense Black Panther Party Trials]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Both the Panthers and the FBI suffered damage to their reputations, after the public exposure of their most unsavory activities.

In 1971, a group of left-wing radicals calling themselves the [[Citizens' Commission to Investigate the FBI]] burglarized an FBI field office in [[Media, Pennsylvania]], which was found to be spying on [[Swarthmore College]] students and faculty.  Among the materials stolen in this break-in were documents revealing the nature of the COINTELPRO program.  Within the year, Director [[J. Edgar Hoover|Hoover]] declared that the centralized COINTELPRO was over.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albionmonitor.net/9905a/jbcointelpro.html A Short History of FBI COINTELPRO], retrieved July 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Panthers, the Seale trial may have been the height of their national exposure and their popularity among the broader left-wing movement.  A string of violent confrontations with law-enforcement, along with the trials and convictions of national party leaders that followed, left the movement spent and adrift, and by the mid-1970s it was largely inactive.

The trial surfaced again in the news in 2000, when former first lady [[Hillary Clinton]] ran for U.S. Senate in the state of New York.  Anti-Clinton activists discovered that during the trials, Clinton (then a Yale law student named Hillary Rodham) volunteered  to monitor the trial for violations of civil rights, for the [[American Civil Liberties Union]].   Widely circulated mass [[e-mails]] erroneously ascribed to Clinton responsibility for "getting the defendants off," and also blamed the future head of the [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] [[U.S. Justice Department]]'s [[Civil Rights Division]], [[Bill Lann Lee]], who was a Yale undergraduate at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/politics/clintons/panthers.asp |title=Urban Legends Reference Pages: Black Panthers and Hillary Clinton |publisher=Snopes.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although both were much too junior to have had any role in the actual legal defense, according to John Elvin of the conservative newsmagazine ''[[Insight on the News]]'', "Insight reviewed biographies of Hillary Clinton by Milton, [[David Brock|[David] Brock]] and [[Roger Morris (American writer)|Roger Morris]] for this story and lengthy selections from such other biographies as [[Barbara Olson]]'s Hell to Pay. Together, relying on primary and other firsthand sources, they unquestionably back [[David Horowitz (conservative writer)|David Horowitz]]'s contention that Hillary was a campus leader during the Panther protests";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.truthorfiction.com/rumors/h/hillarypanthers.htm |title=Hillary Clinton once supported Black Panthers on trial for murder-Truth! |publisher=Truthorfiction.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee apparently played no prominent role in any protests.&lt;ref name="hillary.html"&gt;[http://tafkac.org/ulz/hillary.html Urban Legend Zeitgeist: Hillary Clinton and the Black Panthers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Kelly Moye revealed that he was a police informant recruited to infiltrate the Panthers by Nick Pastore, head of New Haven Police's Intelligence Division. George Sams held a gun to Moye's head and demanded he turn over his car. Rackley was driven to his death in Moye's car. The police followed Moye's car as it left toward the murder destination but lost sight of the car prior to the murder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/after_37_years_spy_comes_in_from_cold/ After 37 Years, Spy Comes In From Cold, by Paul Bass, New Haven Independent, Aug 4, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; The State Police discovered Rackley's body the next day. This epilogue was detailed in an article "After 37 Years, Spy Comes In From Cold" by Paul Bass, author of Murder In The Model City: The Black Panthers, Yale and the Redemption of a Killer.

Detective [[Nick Pastore]], who arrested Seale and brought him to New Haven to stand trial, went on to become New Haven's Chief of Police, widely renowned for his successful policy of [[community policing]], and now heads a nonprofit advocacy group in [[Washington, DC]] named Criminal Justice Policy. Thirty one years later, when Seale returned to New Haven to speak at the [[Yale Repertory Theatre]], Pastore decided to attend and even presented Seale with a pink [[Porcelain pigs|porcelain pig]] and a hug, congratulating him for continuing "the struggle".&lt;ref name="FTR-bobbyseale.HTML"/&gt;

He added that he had never worked for any government or [[intelligence agency]] and expressed willingness to help prosecutors if granted immunity from prosecution. After SZ verified that the statement did in fact come from the source for the Panama Papers, the [[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists]] (ICIJ) posted the full document on its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Panama Papers: Source breaks silence on Mossack Fonseca leaks |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-36232142 |date=6 May 2016 |accessdate=6 May 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506162129/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-36232142 |archivedate=May 6, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://panamapapers.icij.org/20160506-john-doe-statement.html#_ga=1.164154486.836406132.1459807380 |title=Panama Papers Source Offers Documents To Governments, Hints At More To Come |date=May 6, 2016 |accessdate=May 8, 2016 |publisher=ICIJ |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507055440/https://panamapapers.icij.org/20160506-john-doe-statement.html#_ga=1.164154486.836406132.1459807380 |archivedate=May 7, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

SZ asked the ICIJ for help because of the amount of data involved. Journalists from 107 media organizations in 80 countries analyzed documents detailing the operations of the law firm.&lt;ref name="Guardian: how the rich"/&gt; After more than a year of analysis, the first news stories were published on April 3, 2016, along with 150 of the documents themselves.&lt;ref name="DocumentCloudPP"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.documentcloud.org/public/search/Source:%20%22Internal%20documents%20from%20Mossack%20Fonseca%20(Panama%20Papers)%22 |title=DocumentCloud 150 Results Source: Internal documents from Mossack Fonseca (Panama) |last= |first= |date= |website=DocumentCloud |publisher=Investigative Reporters and Editors, Inc.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170319113221/https://www.documentcloud.org/public/search/Source:%20%22Internal%20documents%20from%20Mossack%20Fonseca%20%28Panama%20Papers%29%22|archive-date=2017-03-19|dead-url=yes |accessdate=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project represents an important milestone in the use of [[data journalism]] software tools and [[mobile collaboration]].

The documents were dubbed the Panama Papers because of the country they were leaked from; however, the Panamanian government expressed strong objections to the name over concerns that it would tarnish the government's and country's image worldwide, as did other entities in Panama and elsewhere. This led to an advertising campaign some weeks after the leak, titled "Panama, more than papers".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/Medoro.Madera.Oficial/posts/10153637852624779&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.newsroompanama.com/news/panama/panama-more-than-papers-us-ambassador&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.panamatoday.com/special-report/panama-papers-scandal-damaged-image-country-4615&lt;/ref&gt; Some media outlets covering the story have used the name "Mossack Fonseca papers".&lt;ref&gt;Sources using the term "Mossack Fonseca papers":

In addition to the much-covered business dealings of British prime minister [[David Cameron]] and Icelandic prime minister [[Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson]], the leaked documents also contain identity information about the shareholders and directors of 214,000 shell companies set up by [[Mossack Fonseca]], as well as some of their financial transactions. Much of this information does not show anything more than prudent financial management. It is generally not against the law (in and of itself) to own an offshore shell company, although offshore shell companies may sometimes be used for illegal purposes.

The journalists on the investigative team found business transactions by many important figures in world politics, sports and art. Many of these transactions are quite legal. Since the data is incomplete, questions remain in many other cases; still others seem to clearly indicate ethical if not legal impropriety. Some disclosures – [[tax avoidance]] in very poor countries by very wealthy entities and individuals for example – lead to questions on moral grounds. According to ''[[The Namibian]]'' for instance, a shell company registered to [[Beny Steinmetz]], Octea, owes more than $700,000 US in property taxes to the city of [[Koidu]] in [[Sierra Leone]], and is $150 million in the red, even though its [[export]]s were more than twice that in an average month in the 2012–2015 period. Steinmetz himself has personal worth of $6 billion.&lt;ref name=NamStein /&gt;

Other offshore shell company transactions described in the documents do seem to have broken exchange laws, violated trade sanctions or stemmed from political corruption, according to ICIJ reporters. For example:

*Uruguay has arrested five people and charged them with [[money-laundering]] through Mossack Fonseca shell companies for a [[Mexican drug cartel]].&lt;ref name=ICIJuru&gt;{{cite news |url=https://panamapapers.icij.org/20160425-cartel-arrests-uruguay.html |title=Cartel-Linked Suspects Arrested After Panama Papers Revelations |author=Martha M.

They enlisted reporters and resources from ''[[The Guardian]]'', the [[BBC]], ''[[Le Monde]]'', ''[[SonntagsZeitung]]'', ''[[Falter]]'', ''[[La Nación]]'', German broadcasters [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk|NDR]] and [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]], and Austrian broadcaster [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]], and eventually many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-35954224 |title=Panama Papers Q&amp;A: What is the scandal about? |website=BBC News |access-date=April 7, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407045429/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-35954224 |archivedate=April 7, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, "reporters at 100 news media outlets working in 25 languages had used the documents" to investigate individuals and organizations associated with Mossack Fonseca.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

SZ also had concerns about security, not only for their source, the leaked documents, and their data, but also for the safety of some of their partners in the investigation living under corrupt regimes who might not want their money-handling practices made public. They stored the data in a room with limited physical access on computers that had never connected to the Internet. The Guardian also limited access to its journalists' project work area. To make it even harder to sabotage the computers or steal their drives, SZ journalists made them more tamper-evident by painting the screws holding the drives in place with glitter nail polish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/12/world/panama-papers-pleitgen-amanpour/ |title=How nail polish helped keep the 'Panama Papers' secret |author=Mick Krever |date=April 12, 2016 |accessdate=April 26, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423205756/http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/12/world/panama-papers-pleitgen-amanpour/ |archivedate=April 23, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using Nuix, ''Süddeutsche Zeitung'' reporters performed [[optical character recognition]] (OCR) processing on the millions of scanned documents, making the data they contained become both searchable and machine-readable. Most project reporters then used [[Neo4J]] and [[Linkurious]]&lt;ref name="forbes"/&gt; to extract individual and corporate names from the documents for analysis, but some who had access to Nuix used it for this as well.&lt;ref name=nuix/&gt; Reporters then cross-referenced the compiled lists of people against the processed documents,&lt;ref name="szabout" /&gt; then analyzed the information, trying to connect people, roles, monetary flow, and structure legality.&lt;ref name="szabout" /&gt;

Mossack Fonseca notified its clients on April 1, 2016 that it had sustained an email hack. Mossack Fonseca also told news sources that the company had been hacked and always operated within the law.&lt;ref name="DiePresse.com 2016"&gt;{{cite web |title=Panama-Papers: Kanzlei Mossack Fonesca erstattet Anzeige |website=DiePresse.com |date=April 6, 2016 |url=http://diepresse.com/home/wirtschaft/international/4961279/PanamaPapers_Kanzlei-Mossack-Fonesca-erstattet-Anzeige |trans-title=Panama-papers: Law firm of Mossack Fonseca charges |language=de |accessdate=2016-04-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408000710/http://diepresse.com/home/wirtschaft/international/4961279/PanamaPapers_Kanzlei-Mossack-Fonesca-erstattet-Anzeige |archivedate=April 8, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data security experts noted, however, that the company had not been encrypting its emails&lt;ref name="forbes"/&gt; and furthermore seemed to have been running a three-year-old version of [[Drupal]] with several known [[Vulnerability (computing)|vulnerabilities]].&lt;ref name="forbes"/&gt; According to ''[[Tech Republic]]'', Drupal ran on the [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]] 2.2.15 version from March 6, 2010, and worse, the Oracle [[Fork (software development)|fork]] of Apache, which by default allows users to view [[Directory (computing)|directory]] structure.&lt;ref name=TR&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.techrepublic.com/article/no-1-thing-it-departments-can-learn-from-the-panama-papers-hack/ |title=No. 1 thing IT departments can learn from the Panama Papers hack: Staggeringly out of date software supports the conclusion that documents from Mossack Fonseca were exfiltrated by a hacker.

The anonymity of offshore shell companies can also be used to circumvent international sanctions, and more than 30 Mossack Fonseca clients were at one time or another blacklisted by the [[US Treasury Department]], including businesses linked to senior figures in Russia, Syria and North Korea.&lt;ref name="economist.com"&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/international/21696497-huge-trove-documents-has-revealed-secrets-offshore-business-presaging-tougher "A torrential leak"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831141724/https://www.economist.com/news/international/21696497-huge-trove-documents-has-revealed-secrets-offshore-business-presaging-tougher |date=August 31, 2017 }}.

Three Mossack Fonseca companies started for clients of Helene Mathieu Legal Consultants were later sanctioned by the US Treasury's [[Office of Foreign Assets Control]] (OFAC). Pangates International Corporation was accused in July 2014 of supplying the government of Syria with "a large amount of specialty petroleum products" with "limited civilian application in Syria". The other two, Maxima Middle East Trading and Morgan Additives Manufacturing Co, and their owners Wael Abdulkarim and Ahmad Barqawi, were said to have "engaged in deceptive measures" to supply oil products to Syria.&lt;ref name=CBClawyer&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/panama-helene-mathieu-dubai-1.3519760 |title=Panama Papers: Quebec lawyer based pin Dubai linked to Mossack Fonseca: Helene Mathieu Legal Consultants worked to incorporate 3 companies that now face economic sanctions |author=Salimah Shivji |publisher=CBC News |date=4 April 2016 |accessdate=20 April 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422135758/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/panama-helene-mathieu-dubai-1.3519760 |archivedate=April 22, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mossack Fonseca also ran six businesses for [[Rami Makhlouf]], cousin of Syrian president [[Bashar al-Assad]], despite US sanctions against him.&lt;ref name=bbcSyr&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-35959604 |title=Panama Papers: Mossack Fonseca 'helped firms subject to sanctions' |first=Simon |last=Cox |publisher=BBC |date=April 4, 2016 |accessdate=April 6, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405160118/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-35959604 |archivedate=April 5, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Internal Mossack Fonseca documents show that in 2011 Mossack Fonseca rejected a recommendation by their own compliance team to sever ties to Mr. Makhlouf. They agreed to do so only months later. The firm has said it never knowingly allowed anyone connected with rogue regimes to use its companies.&lt;ref name="economist.com"/&gt;

[[Frederik Obermaier]], co-author of the Panama Papers story and an investigative reporter at the German newspaper ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'', told ''[[Democracy Now]]'': "[[Mossack Fonseca]] realised that [[Rami Makhlouf|Makhlouf]] was the cousin, and they realised that he was sanctioned, and they realised that he's allegedly one of the financiers of the Syrian regime. And they said, 'Oh, there is this bank who still does business with him, so we should still keep with him, as well'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Panama Papers: World Leaders from Iceland to Argentina Exposed in Massive Tax Evasion Scheme |url=http://www.democracynow.org/2016/4/5/panama_papers_world_leaders_rich_criminals |accessdate=April 23, 2016 |work=Democracy Now! |date=April 5, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423181546/http://www.democracynow.org/2016/4/5/panama_papers_world_leaders_rich_criminals |archivedate=April 23, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[HSBC Bank (Europe)|HSBC]] also appeared to reassure [[Mossack Fonseca]] not only that it was "comfortable" with Makhlouf as a client but suggested there could be a rapprochement with the [[Al-Assad family|Assad family]] by the US. Makhlouf is already known to be a long-standing client of HSBC's Swiss private bank, holding at least $15 million with it in multiple accounts in 2006.&lt;ref name="ESGoodwaySyria" /&gt; The Panamanian files also show HSBC provided financial services to a Makhlouf company called Drex Technologies, which HSBC said was a company of "good standing".&lt;ref name="ESGoodwaySyria" /&gt;

The [[United States Department of the Treasury|US Treasury Department]] in 2013 called DCB Finance a front company for [[Daedong Credit Bank]] and announced sanctions against both companies for providing banking services to North Korean arms dealer [[Korea Mining and Development Trading Corporation]],&lt;ref name=USTreas /&gt; attempting to evade sanctions against that country, and helping to sell arms and expand North Korea's [[North Korea and weapons of mass destruction|nuclear weapons programme]]. Cowie said the holding company was used for legitimate business and he was not aware of illicit transactions.&lt;ref name=Cowie /&gt;

Mossack Fonseca, required by international banking standards to avoid [[money-laundering]] or fraudster clients, is, like all banks, supposed to be particularly alert for signs of corruption with [[politically exposed person]]s (PEP), in other words, clients who either are or have close ties to government officials. However they somehow failed to turn up any red flags concerning Tareq Abbas even though he shares a family name with the president of Palestine, and sat on the board of directors of a company with four fellow directors the firm did deem PEP because of their ties to Palestinian politics. Yet Mossack Fonseca actually did and documented [[due diligence]] research, including a Google search.&lt;ref name=son /&gt;

Over 210,000 companies in twenty-one jurisdictions figure in the leaks.

Mossack Fonseca's clients have come from more than 100 countries. Most of the corporate clients were from Hong Kong, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, Panama, and Cyprus.

== Responses by Mossack Fonseca ==
In response to queries from the ''[[Miami Herald]]'' and ICIJ, Mossack Fonseca issued a 2,900-word statement listing legal requirements that prevent using offshore companies for [[tax avoidance]] and total anonymity, such as [[Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering|FATF]] protocols which require identifying ultimate [[beneficial owner]]s of all companies (including offshore companies) before opening any account or transacting any business.

The ''[[Miami Herald]]'' printed the statement with an editor's note that said the statement "did not address any of the specific due diligence failings uncovered by reporters".&lt;ref name=MH&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article69252767.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529034835/http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article69252767.html |archivedate=2016-05-29 |author=Miami Herald staff |title=Mossack Fonseca responds to Miami Herald 'Secret Shell Game' series on offshore companies |date=April 3, 2016 |accessdate=April 3, 2016 |newspaper=[[The Miami Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Monday, April 4, Mossack Fonseca released another statement:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The facts are these: while we may have been the victim of a data breach, nothing we've seen in this illegally obtained cache of documents suggests we've done anything illegal, and that's very much in keeping with the global reputation we've built over the past 40 years of doing business the right way.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Co-founder [[Ramón Fonseca Mora]] told [[CNN]] that the reports were false, full of inaccuracies and that parties "in many of the circumstances" cited by the ICIJ "are not and have never been clients of Mossack Fonseca". The firm provided longer statements to ICIJ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/04/04/world/panama-papers-explainer/ |title=The Panama Papers: 7 things to know |date=April 5, 2016 |accessdate=April 5, 2016 |publisher=CNN |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406024845/http://edition.cnn.com/2016/04/04/world/panama-papers-explainer/ |archivedate=April 6, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its official statement April 6,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mossfonmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Statement-Regarding-Recent-Media-Coverage_4-1-2016.pdf |format=PDF |title=Statement Regarding Recent Media Coverage |publisher=Mossack Fonseca|access-date=2016-04-08 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406213759/http://mossfonmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Statement-Regarding-Recent-Media-Coverage_4-1-2016.pdf |archivedate=April 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mossack Fonseca suggested that responsibility for any legal violations might lie with other institutions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;approximately 90% of our clientele is {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} professional clients&amp;nbsp;... who act as [[financial intermediary|intermediaries]] and are regulated in the [[jurisdiction]] of their business. These clients are obliged to perform [[due diligence]] on their clients in accordance with the [[Know your customer|KYC]] and [[Anti-money laundering|AML regulations]] to which they are subject.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In an interview with ''Bloomberg'', [[Jürgen Mossack]] said: "The cat's out of the bag, so now we have to deal with the aftermath."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-05/a-conversation-with-panama-s-suddenly-notorious-offshore-lawyers |author=Blake Schmidt |publisher=Bloomberg |title=A Conversation With Panama's Suddenly Notorious Offshore Lawyers |date=April 4, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170225163510/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-05/a-conversation-with-panama-s-suddenly-notorious-offshore-lawyers |archivedate=February 25, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He said the leak was not an "inside job"—the company had been hacked by servers based abroad.

On May 5, 2016, Mossack Fonseca sent a cease and desist letter to the ICIJ in an attempt to stop the ICIJ from releasing the leaked documents from the Panama Papers scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=Spanish |url=http://elsiglo.com/panama/piden-publicar-panama-papers/23938374 |title=Piden no publicar Panama Papers |date=May 6, 2016 |website=El Siglo |publisher=El Siglo |access-date=April 8, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602061930/http://elsiglo.com/panama/piden-publicar-panama-papers/23938374 |archivedate=June 2, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the ICIJ released the leaked documents on May 9, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=Spanish |url=http://elsiglo.com/panama/icij-revelara-panama-papers/23938995 |title=ICIJ revelará hoy 'Panamá papers' |date=May 9, 2016 |website=El Siglo |publisher=El Siglo |access-date=April 8, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510105803/http://elsiglo.com/panama/icij-revelara-panama-papers/23938995 |archivedate=May 10, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=English |url=https://panamapapers.icij.org/blog/20160509-offshore-database-release.html |title=ICIJ releases database revealing thousands of secret offshore companies · ICIJ |date=May 9, 2016 |website=icij.org |publisher=The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists |access-date=April 8, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509180916/https://panamapapers.icij.org/blog/20160509-offshore-database-release.html |archivedate=May 9, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responses in Panama==
At 5:00 am on April 3, as the news first broke, [[Ramón Fonseca Mora]] told television channel [[TVN (Panama)|TVN]] he "was not responsible nor he had been accused in any tribunal".&lt;ref name="tvn-2.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvn-2.com/nacionales/Fonseca-Mora-Red-Delitos-Financieros-PanamaPapers_0_4452304801.html |title=Exclusiva: 'No soy responsable ni he sido acusado en un tribunal', Fonseca Mora |website=TVN |access-date=2016-04-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506225050/http://www.tvn-2.com/nacionales/Fonseca-Mora-Red-Delitos-Financieros-PanamaPapers_0_4452304801.html |archivedate=May 6, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He said the firm was the victim of a hack and that he had no responsibility for what clients did with the offshore companies that they purchased from Mossack Fonseca, which were legal under Panamanian law.&lt;ref name="tvn-2.com"/&gt; Later that day, the Independent Movement (MOVIN)&lt;ref group=note&gt;MOVIN: an independent political movement based in Panama, focused on influencing and monitoring the independence, efficiency and transparency of government institutions and their management.

===Public officials===
By April 8, the government understood media reports were addressing tax evasion not attacking the country of Panama.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} The president met on Wednesday April 7, with CANDIF, a committee of representatives from different sectors of the economy which includes the Chamber of Commerce, Chamber of Industry and Agriculture, the National Lawyers Association, the International Lawyers Association, the Banking Association and the Stock Exchange, and entered full [[crisis management]] mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bna.com/panama-launches-crisis-n57982069699/ |title=Panama Launches Crisis Talks in Wake of Tax Haven Leaks |website=www.bna.com |access-date=2016-04-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508162514/http://www.bna.com/panama-launches-crisis-n57982069699/ |archivedate=May 8, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He announced the creation of a new judiciary tribunal and a high-level commission led by Nobel Prize Laureate [[Joseph Stiglitz]].{{when|date=November 2017}}

[[Isabel Saint Malo]] de Alvarado, Vice President of Panama, said in an op-ed piece published April 21 in ''The Guardian'' that President [[Juan Carlos Varela]] and his administration have strengthened Panama's controls over [[money-laundering]] in the twenty months they have been in power, and that "Panama is setting up an independent commission, co-chaired by the Nobel laureate [[Joseph Stiglitz]], to evaluate our financial system, determine best practices, and recommend measures to strengthen global financial and legal transparency. We expect its findings within the next six months, and will share the results with the international community."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/21/panama-papers-tax-haven-financial-transparency |title=Don't blame Panama for the Panama Papers |author=Isabel Saint Malo de Alvarado |date=April 21, 2016 |accessdate=April 23, 2006 |work=The Guardian |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422065303/http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/21/panama-papers-tax-haven-financial-transparency |archivedate=April 22, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in early August 2016, Stiglitz resigned from the committee because he learned that the Panamanian government would not commit to making their final report public. He said that he had always "assumed" that the final report would be transparent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Business/International/panama-papers-commission-credibility-chair-joseph-stiglitz/story?id=41203846 "Panama Papers Commission ‘Will Have No Credibility,’ Former Chair Joseph Stiglitz Says"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160811154619/http://abcnews.go.com/Business/International/panama-papers-commission-credibility-chair-joseph-stiglitz/story?id=41203846 |date=August 11, 2016 }}, ''ABC News'', August 9, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ministry of Economy and Finance of Panama, Dulcidio de la Guardia, formerly an offshore specialist at Mossack Fonseca competitor Morgan &amp; Morgan, said the legal but often "murky" niche of establishing offshore accounts, firms and trusts make up "less than half a percentage point" of Panama's [[GDP]].  He appeared to suggest that publication of the papers was an attack on Panama because of the high level of economic growth that the country had shown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6066b3d8-fce1-11e5-a31a-7930bacb3f5f.html |title=Panamanians pained by corruption claims |last=Webber |first=Jude |date=2016-04-07 |newspaper=Financial Times |issn=0307-1766 |access-date=2016-04-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160411020422/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6066b3d8-fce1-11e5-a31a-7930bacb3f5f.html |archivedate=April 11, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist Rolando Gordon said the affair hurts Panama, which has just emerged from the greylist of the [[Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering|FATF]], and added that each country, especially Panama, must conduct investigations and determine whether illegal or improper acts were committed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://elsiglo.com/panama/repercucion-economica/23932074 |title=Repercución económica |date=April 5, 2016 |accessdate=April 7, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407224643/http://elsiglo.com/panama/repercucion-economica/23932074 |archivedate=April 7, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Panama's Lawyers Movement called the Panama Papers leak "cyber bullying" and in a press conference condemned it as an attack on the 'Panama' brand. Fraguela Alfonso, its president, said called it a direct attack on the country's financial system.

&lt;blockquote&gt;I invite all organized forces of the country to create a great crusade for the rescue of the country's image&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;!-- unable to understand this: The law firm Rubio, Álvarez, Solís &amp; Abrego also reacted and in a press release said that "In recent decades Panama has been in the most important financial and service centers of Latin America and the entire world.

Offshore companies are legal, said Panamanian lawyer and former controller of the republic Alvin Weeden; illegality arises when they are used for money laundering, arms smuggling, terrorism, or tax evasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://elsiglo.com/panama/sociedades-offshore/23932072 |title=Sociedades offshore |date=April 5, 2016 |accessdate=April 7, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407224715/http://elsiglo.com/panama/sociedades-offshore/23932072 |archivedate=April 7, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 22, 2016, in the midst of a state visit to Germany, Varela told journalist Jenny Pérez, of [[Deutsche Welle]] that there had been "progress" in transparency and many agreements to exchange tax information, and that [[tax evasion]] was a global problem.

On April 22 the same unit raided another Panama location and "secured a large amount of evidence".&lt;ref name=Telraid /&gt;

The Municipality of Regulation and Supervision of Financial Subjects [not the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF)] initiated a special review of the law firm Mossack Fonseca to determine whether it had followed tax law. Carlamara Sanchez, in charge of this proceeding, said at a press conference that the quartermaster had come to verify whether the firm had complied since April 8 with [[due diligence]], customer knowledge, the final beneficiary and reporting of suspicious transactions to Financial Analysis Unit (UAF) operations. She said that Law 23 of 2015 empowers regulation and supervision and said some firms had been monitored since late last year with special attention after the Panama Papers, and noted that the law carries fines $5,000 to $1 million or even suspension of the firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://elsiglo.com/panama/realiza-auditoria-firma-mossack-fonseca/23934086 |title=MEF realiza auditoría a firma Mossack Fonseca |date=April 15, 2016 |accessdate=May 2, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417003806/http://elsiglo.com/panama/realiza-auditoria-firma-mossack-fonseca/23934086 |archivedate=April 17, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICIJ investigation of Mossack Fonseca was reported to the Public Ministry. Samid Dan Sandoval, former candidate for mayor of Santiago de Veraguas (2014), filed the legal action against the journalists and all those who had participated. He said the project name damaged the integrity, dignity and sovereignty of the country. and that the consortium would have to assume legal responsibility for all damage caused to the Panamanian nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://elsiglo.com/panama/icij-puede-investigado/23933682 |title=ICIJ no puede ser investigado |date=April 13, 2016 |accessdate=May 2, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414104744/http://elsiglo.com/panama/icij-puede-investigado/23933682 |archivedate=April 14, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Change.org petition requested the ICIJ stop using the name of Panama as in the Panama Papers. The request said the generally- accepted name for the investigation "damage(d) the image" of Panama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.telemetro.com/nacionales/Elevan-peticion-internet-Panama-Papers_0_904710164.html |title=Elevan petición en internet para que se cambie el nombre de Panama Papers |date=April 4, 2016 |accessdate=May 2, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513150047/http://www.telemetro.com/nacionales/Elevan-peticion-internet-Panama-Papers_0_904710164.html |archivedate=May 13, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Suspension of investigation ===
Attorney General of Panama Kenia Isolda Porcell Diaz announced on January 24, 2017 that he was suspending the investigations against Mossack Fonseca because it filed an appeal for protection of constitutional rights before the First Superior Court of Justice of Panama and requested that he deliver all the original documents to issue a judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gestion.pe/politica/panama-suspendera-investigacion-sobre-panama-papers-2180461 |title=Panamá suspenderá investigación sobre Panama Papers |first= |last=gestion.pe |date=January 24, 2017 |publisher= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202041325/http://gestion.pe/politica/panama-suspendera-investigacion-sobre-panama-papers-2180461 |archivedate=February 2, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.laprensalibre.cr/Noticias/detalle/101002/panama-suspendera-investigacion-sobre-panama-papers |title=Panamá suspenderá investigación sobre Panama Papers – laprensalibre.cr |first= |last=www.laprensalibre.cr |publisher= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202024609/https://www.laprensalibre.cr/Noticias/detalle/101002/panama-suspendera-investigacion-sobre-panama-papers |archivedate=February 2, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cdn8.larepublica.pe/mundo/america/842510-panama-papers-procuradora-general-anuncio-suspension-de-investigacion |title=Panamá Papers: procuradora general anunció suspensión de investigación |date=January 24, 2017 |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202025907/http://cdn8.larepublica.pe/mundo/america/842510-panama-papers-procuradora-general-anuncio-suspension-de-investigacion |archivedate=February 2, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=October 2017}}

Many senior EU figures have been implicated in the Panama Papers scandal.&lt;ref name="Politico EU figures"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Quentin |first1=Ariès |last2=Paravinci |first2=Giulia |title=5 ways the Panama Papers swept up EU figures |url=http://www.politico.eu/article/5-ways-panama-papers-swept-eu-figures-miguel-arias-canete-david-cameron/ |accessdate=April 7, 2016 |work=POLITICO |date=April 7, 2016 |language=English |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407224018/http://www.politico.eu/article/5-ways-panama-papers-swept-eu-figures-miguel-arias-canete-david-cameron/ |archivedate=April 7, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Commissioner for Taxation and Customs Union, Audit and Anti-Fraud|European Commissioner for Taxation]], [[Pierre Moscovici]], has said that the [[European Union]] as a whole had a "duty" to prevent the kind of tax avoidance uncovered in the Panama Papers scandal. Moscovici told reporters the use of offshore companies to hide what he called "shocking amounts" of financial assets from tax authorities was "unethical". He estimated that the tax shelters resulted in an annual loss of some €1&amp;nbsp;trillion in public finances, adding that the [[European Commission]] has attempted to tighten tax rules across the union since November 2014 due to the [[Luxembourg Leaks]] scandal, also revealed by the ICIJ, and that he hoped the extent of the Panama Papers revelations would spur countries to action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ariès |first1=Quentin |title=EU vows to act quickly on Panama Papers |url=http://www.politico.eu/article/pierre-moscovici-european-union-must-act-quickly-on-panama-papers/ |accessdate=April 7, 2016 |work=POLITICO |date=April 6, 2016 |language=English |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407224450/http://www.politico.eu/article/pierre-moscovici-european-union-must-act-quickly-on-panama-papers/ |archivedate=April 7, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2013 letter, unearthed by the ''[[Financial Times]]'' to the then president of the [[European Council]], [[Herman Van Rompuy]], the then [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] [[David Cameron]] said that offshore trusts should not automatically be subject to the same transparency requirements as shell companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Stewart |first1=Heather |title=Cameron stepped in to shield offshore trusts from EU tax crackdown in 2013 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/07/david-cameron-offshore-trusts-eu-tax-crackdown-2013 |accessdate=April 7, 2016 |work=The Guardian |date=April 6, 2016 |language=English |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407033153/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/07/david-cameron-offshore-trusts-eu-tax-crackdown-2013 |archivedate=April 7, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Panama Papers: Cameron's 2013 concern over trust reforms |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35983222 |accessdate=April 7, 2016 |work=BBC News |date=April 7, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407000423/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35983222 |archivedate=April 7, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Andorra ====
The Panama Papers revealed that the Minister of Finance of Andorra, [[Jordi Cinca]], while he was CEO of Orfund SA, maintained an offshore company called Mariette Holdings Inc, until its dissolution in 2002 for fear of discovery of his participation in these businesses. The business activities of Orfund had ties to the [[blood diamond]] trade, and the refining and sale of African gold. This company closed shortly before the [[civil war in Ivory Coast]].

The opposition demanded his resignation as a result. In response Cinca said that "if their connection would affect the Government of Andorra, will step down". Still, he did not.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.andorradifusio.ad/Noticies/cinca-explica-que-va-ser-apoderat-duna-societat-panamenya-entre-el-1999-i-el-2000-arran-dels-papers-de-panama "Andorra Difusió]". {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423124656/http://www.andorradifusio.ad/Noticies/cinca-explica-que-va-ser-apoderat-duna-societat-panamenya-entre-el-1999-i-el-2000-arran-dels-papers-de-panama |date=April 23, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.andorradifusio.ad/Noticies/els-grups-valoren-la-declaracio-de-cinca-sobre-el-fet-que-va-ser-apoderat-d-una-societat-a-panama "Andorra Difusió RTVA"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423135858/http://www.andorradifusio.ad/Noticies/els-grups-valoren-la-declaracio-de-cinca-sobre-el-fet-que-va-ser-apoderat-d-una-societat-a-panama |date=April 23, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elperiodic.ad/hemeroteca/406/6-dabril-del-2016 "Portada de El Periòdic d'Andorra"]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160612081501/http://www.elperiodic.ad/hemeroteca/406/6-dabril-del-2016 |date=June 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europapress.es/cultura/noticia-libro-vincula-baronesa-thyssen-empresa-andorrana-venta-oro-20090312212829.html "Europa Press – Orfund"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603170841/http://www.europapress.es/cultura/noticia-libro-vincula-baronesa-thyssen-empresa-andorrana-venta-oro-20090312212829.html |date=June 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libertaddigital.com/chic/corazon/2013-06-11/metodo-3-siguio-a-la-baronesa-thyssen-amantes-robos-negocios-en-sudafrica-1276492564/ "Libertad Digital"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422025514/http://www.libertaddigital.com/chic/corazon/2013-06-11/metodo-3-siguio-a-la-baronesa-thyssen-amantes-robos-negocios-en-sudafrica-1276492564/ |date=April 22, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

A 2012 investigation, by [[Radio Free Europe]] and the [[Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project]] (OCCRP) discovered that through overseas holding companies, the daughters of Azerbaijani president [[Ilham Aliyev]] owned an interest in a gold mine operation created by a 2006 presidential decree forming a consortium, then awarding it a 30-year lease over environmental and transparency objections in Parliament.&lt;ref name=inv2012&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.occrp.org/en/investigations/1495-azerbaijans-president-awarded-family-stake-in-gold-fields |title=Azerbaijan's President Awarded Family Stake in Gold Fields |date=May 3, 2012 |author1=By Khadija Ismayilova |author2=Nushaba Fatullayeva |publisher=OCCRP |accessdate=May 9, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601224142/https://www.occrp.org/en/investigations/1495-azerbaijans-president-awarded-family-stake-in-gold-fields |archivedate=June 1, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

But the Panama Papers made it possible to trace some of the elaborate network of shell companies that manage the ownership of the mines, and in 2016 OCCRP was able to establish that in fact the daughters control the mining operation.&lt;ref name=OCAzPP /&gt;

Aliyev awarded the gold mines to Globex International LLP, Londex Resources S.A., Willy &amp; Meyris S.A. and Fargate Mining Corporation. Thirty percent of the proceeds were allocated to the government of Azerbaijan; 11% of the remaining 70% went to Globex, 45% to Londex, 29% to Willy &amp; Meyris and the remaining 15% to Fargate.&lt;ref name=inv2012 /&gt;

These companies were registered in Panama, according to the documents obtained from Panama Registry of Companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Radio RF/RFL, last updated in April 2016 |url=http://www.rferl.org/a/azerbaijan_gold-field_contract_awarded_to_presidents_family/24569192.html |publisher=RFRL |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161218194532/http://www.rferl.org/a/azerbaijan_gold-field_contract_awarded_to_presidents_family/24569192.html |archivedate=December 18, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A one of them, Fargate Mining Corporation was founded by Tagiva Management Ltd., Tagiva Services Ltd. and Verda Management Ltd.

Founder of [[Nobel Oil Group]] also is Mr. N. Hasanov.

The 2012 investigation's reporters, established that Globex was owned through shell companies in Panama, and that these shell companies belonged to the president's daughters and a Swiss businessman whose name appears in other shell companies such as those that manage Azerphone, the family telecommunications monopoly. Villagers told reporters they hoped to work at the mine, which paid $12 a day, and asked them to intervene with the president about the problems the mine was causing with the water supply. They became angry and did not believe the reporters when they said the president's family had a stake in the mine.&lt;ref name=inv2012 /&gt;

Following the May publication of this report, the National Assembly passed a law making it illegal to report company ownership&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.radioazadlyg.org/content/article/24612973.html |title=Придет ли Азербайджан к открытости? |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618114118/http://www.radioazadlyg.org/content/article/24612973.html |archivedate=June 18, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and another giving former presidents and first ladies lifelong legal immunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://rus.azattyq.org/a/ilham-aliyev-mehriban-aliyeva-azerbaijan-immunity/24612838.html |title=Ильхам Алиев тоже получил пожизненный иммунитет |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616230020/http://rus.azattyq.org/a/ilham-aliyev-mehriban-aliyeva-azerbaijan-immunity/24612838.html |archivedate=June 16, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Khadija Ismayilova, the Radio Free Europe reporter on the 2012 investigation was subjected to escalating legal and public harassment.

Leaked Mossack Fonseca documents made it possible to establish that the daughters also owned Londex, the majority partner in the gold enterprise. It is not entirely clear why they shut the operation down but industry experts familiar with the consortium say it did not seem very experienced and may have rushed into production.&lt;ref name=OCAzPP /&gt;

According to the ICIJ, Aliyev's daughter Arzu not only has financial stakes not only in gold rights but also in Azerfon, the country's largest mobile phone business. She has shares in SW Holding, which "controls nearly every operation related to Azerbaijan Airlines" (Azal), from meals to airport taxis. Both sisters and their brother Heydar own property in Dubai valued at roughly $75&amp;nbsp;million in 2010; Heydar is the legal owner of nine luxury mansions in Dubai purchased for some $44&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="icij"/&gt;

Some 600 Israeli companies and 850 Israeli shareholders are listed.

Weissglass' name appears as a sole owner of one of four companies set up by his business partner Assaf Halkin. The company, Talaville Global, was registered in the [[British Virgin Islands]] in May 2012, according to Haaretz, and seven months later, all of its shares were mortgaged against a loan from a [[Vienna]] bank.

Weissglass and Halkin told Haaretz that the company "was registered for the purpose of receiving a loan from the bank in order to invest in European properties. The bank would only allow a loan to a corporation... [the] company activity is reported to the tax authorities in Israel. The required tax on the said activity is paid in Israel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/600-israeli-companies-850-shareholders-listed-in-panama-data-leak/ |title=600 Israeli companies, 850 shareholders listed in Panama data leak |work=The Times of Israel |accessdate=April 5, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405085825/http://www.timesofisrael.com/600-israeli-companies-850-shareholders-listed-in-panama-data-leak/ |archivedate=April 5, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The verdict followed months of dramatic news coverage and social media debates, the divisions falling largely along party lines.&lt;ref name="pk" /&gt;

Prior to the ruling, [[Maryam Nawaz]] had tweeted denial of wrongdoing, adding that she did not own "any company/property abroad," except as "a trustee" in a brother's corporation, "which only entitles me to distribute assets to my brother Hussain's family/children if needed."&lt;ref name=SamaaApr416&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.samaa.tv/pakistan/2016/04/i-do-not-own-any-company-or-property-abroad-maryam |title=I do not own any company or property abroad: Maryam Nawaz |date=April 4, 2016 |work=[[Samaa TV]] |accessdate=April 5, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406024906/http://www.samaa.tv/pakistan/2016/04/i-do-not-own-any-company-or-property-abroad-maryam/ |archivedate=April 6, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The leaked documents name her as a [[trustee]] of Nescoll, created in 1993, and Nielson, first registered in 1994. The two companies subscribed to Mossack Fonseca services in July 2006. Mossack Fonseca was managing Nescoll, Nielsen Holdings, and Coomber Group when the three companies obtained a £7 million mortgage from the Swiss bank, [[Deutsche Bank]] (Suisse) SA and purchased four flats in Avenfield House, at 118 [[Park Lane]] in London. Hassan, the other brother, bought Hangon Holdings and its stock in 2007 for £5.5 million; Hangon then bought property, financed through the [[Bank of Scotland]], at 1 Hyde Park Place in London.

Samina Durrani, mother of Shebaz Sharif's second wife, and Ilyas Mehraj, brother of his first, also figure in the documents. Habib Waqas Group/Ilyas Mehraj is listed as a shareholder with 127,735 shares in Haylandale Limited, registered July 24, 2003 in the Bahamas. Mehraj has denied knowing anything about "any company whether incorporated in the Commonwealth of Bahamas or anywhere else under the name: Haylandale Ltd."&lt;ref name=pklist /&gt; Rainbow Limited, the newest of the three offshore companies owned by Samina Durrani, was registered September 29, 2010 in the British Virgin Islands (BVI).&lt;ref name=pklist/&gt; Armani River Limited, registered in the Bahamas on May 16, 2002, describes its assets as "property in London, which is not currently rented."&lt;ref name=pklist/&gt; Assets of Star Precision Limited, registered in BVI May 21, 1997, were reported as "cash as the investment portfolio.

=====Benazir Bhutto=====
The late [[Benazir Bhutto]] was also a Mossack Fonseca client. In 2001 the firm set up BVI company Petroline International Inc. for Bhutto, her nephew Hassan Ali Jaffery Bhutto, and her aide and head of security [[Rehman Malik]], who later became a Senator and Interior Minister in the government of [[Yousaf Raza Gillani]]. Mossack Fonseca had deemed Bhutto's first company, the similarly named Petrofine FZC, politically sensitive and "declined to accept Mrs Bhutto as a client."&lt;ref name=MFBhutto&gt;{{cite news |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/world/world-news/in-oil-for-food-shadow-benazir-bhutto-set-up-a-firm-too/ |title=In oil-for-food shadow, Benazir Bhutto set up a firm too |author=Jay Mazoomdaar |date=5 April 2016 |accessdate=17 April 2016 |publisher=Indian Express |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416230235/http://indianexpress.com/article/world/world-news/in-oil-for-food-shadow-benazir-bhutto-set-up-a-firm-too/ |archivedate=April 16, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[United Nations]] committee chaired by former US [[Federal Reserve]] head [[Paul Volcker]] had determined in a 2005 investigation into abuses of the [[Oil-for-Food Programme|oil-for-food]] program that Petrofine FZC paid US$2 million to the [[Iraq]]i government of [[Saddam Hussein]] to obtain US $115–145 million in oil contracts.&lt;ref name=OfF&gt;{{cite news |url=http://en.dailypakistan.com.pk/pakistan/panama-papers-benazir-bhuttos-oil-firm-paid-huge-bribes-to-iraqi-president-saddam-hussain-forb-contracts/ |title=Panama Papers: Benazir Bhutto's oil firm paid huge bribes to Iraqi President Saddam Hussain for contracts |date=4 April 2016 |accessdate=17 April 2016 |author=Ali Zain |publisher=Daily Pakistan |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419125238/http://en.dailypakistan.com.pk/pakistan/panama-papers-benazir-bhuttos-oil-firm-paid-huge-bribes-to-iraqi-president-saddam-hussain-forb-contracts/ |archivedate=April 19, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the Pakistani [[National Accountability Bureau]] (NAB) accused Bhutto, Malik and Ali Jaffery of owning Petrofine, established since 2000 in [[Sharjah]], [[United Arab Emirates]]. Bhutto and the [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] denied it. In April 2006 an NAB court froze assets owned in Pakistan and elsewhere by Bhutto and her husband [[Asif Ali Zardari]], saying that the assets, totaling $1.5 billion, were the result of corrupt practices, and that Swiss charges of criminal money laundering filed in 1997 were still in litigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://redcatsboards.yuku.com/topic/16603/Court-orders-confiscation-of-Zardaris-entire-property#.VxQPh_gXAlK |title=Court orders confiscation of Zardari's entire property |date=2 April 2006 |accessdate=17 April 2016 |author=khaleejtimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani]], prime minister from 2007 to 2013, in 2002 acquired three shell companies incorporated in the Bahamas and another in the British Virgin Islands and through them moorage in [[Mallorca]] and a $300 million yacht named ''Al Mirqab''.&lt;ref name=ForbesQatar&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/chloesorvino/2016/04/13/panama-papers-leak-helps-show-that-qatars-former-prime-minister-is-a-billionaire/#2c8eeff825ee |title=Panama Papers Leak Helps Show That Qatar's Former Prime Minister Is A Billionaire |author=Chloe Sorvino |publisher=''Forbes'' |date=April 13, 2016 |accessdate=April 23, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420180845/http://www.forbes.com/sites/chloesorvino/2016/04/13/panama-papers-leak-helps-show-that-qatars-former-prime-minister-is-a-billionaire/#2c8eeff825ee |archivedate=April 20, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Panama Papers indicate he owns or owned eight shell companies. Subsequent reporting by ''Forbes'' found that Al Thani bought $700 million in [[Deutsche Bank]] shares in 2014 through Paramount Services Holdings and in 2015 transferred roughly half the stock to Supreme Universal Holdings, owned by a relative who had left office as emir of Qatar, also in 2013.&lt;ref name=ForbesQatar /&gt;

==== Saudi Arabia ====
[[File:Salman bin Abdull aziz December 9, 2013.jpg|thumb|upright|King [[Salman of Saudi Arabia]] ]]

[[Salman of Saudi Arabia|King Salman]] is mentioned in the leaks in relation to two companies based in the British Virgin Islands—Verse Development Corporation, incorporated in 1999, and Inrow Corporation, incorporated in 2002. The companies took out mortgages totaling over US$34&amp;nbsp;million and purchased properties in central London.&lt;ref name=SalonClinton&gt;{{cite news |title=With Saudi and Russian ties, Clinton machine's tentacles are far reaching, according to Panama Papers |url=http://www.salon.com/2016/04/08/with_saudi_and_russian_ties_clinton_machines_tentacles_are_far_reaching_according_to_panama_papers/ |newspaper=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |date=8 April 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502005935/http://www.salon.com/2016/04/08/with_saudi_and_russian_ties_clinton_machines_tentacles_are_far_reaching_according_to_panama_papers/ |archivedate=May 2, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; His role in the companies was not specified.

The vessel boasts a banquet hall and can comfortably sleep 30.&lt;ref name=Velite /&gt; King Salman is described in the documents as its "principal user".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Saudi King, UAE President at the Center of the Panama Papers |url=http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Saudi-King-UAE-President-at-the-Center-of-the-Panama-Papers-20160404-0024.html |newspaper=[[TeleSUR]] |date=April 4, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406024709/http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Saudi-King-UAE-President-at-the-Center-of-the-Panama-Papers-20160404-0024.html |archivedate=April 6, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Irish Times'' found a link to Iran-Contra in the Panama Papers, in the persons of one of America’s most colourful political donors Farhad Azima and multi-billionaire [[Adnan Khashoggi]], who both employed Mossack Fonseca’s services, and were both important figures in [[Iran-Contra]] scandal.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.irishtimes.com/business/panama-papers-links-revealed-to-spies-and-iran-contra-affair-1.2599083&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mossack Fonseca files show Khashoggi appeared as early as 1978, when he became president of the Panamanian company ISIS Overseas S.A. The documents reveal that Fonseca’s clients included Sheikh [[Kamal Adham]], Saudi Arabia’s first intelligence chief (1963-79), brother-in-law of King Faisal, who was named by a US Senate committee as the CIA’s “principal liaison for the entire the Middle East from the mid-1960s through 1979”. Adham controlled offshore companies involved in the [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International|B.C.C.I.]] banking sem as instruments for their official worcandal.&lt;ref name="goldf"&gt;Will Fitzgibbon and Nicolas Richter: [https://panamapapers.sueddeutsche.de/articles/570e6affa1bb8d3c3495baf4 Panama Papers: CIA-Agents used companies from Panama] Operation Goldfinger, [[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sri Lanka ====
Sri Lankan Finance Minister [[Ravi Karunanayake]] said his panel will investigate Sri Lankan names that come up in the Panama Papers, as well as the 46 who appear in the 2013 Offshore Leaks, according to the ''Daily Mail'', since earlier leadership apparently did not do so. The country has many large outstanding foreign loans taken out under the administration of former president [[Mahinda Rajapakse]], and the current government recently had to obtain a US$1.5 billion [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] bailout. Rajapakse has denied diverting funds. The current government came to power in January 2016 on an anti-corruption platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sri Lanka sets up panel to investigate 'Panama Papers' |date=May 1, 2016 |accessdate=May 9, 2016 |author=AFP |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3568455/Sri-Lanka-sets-panel-investigate-Panama-Papers.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20160726040317/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-3568455/Sri-Lanka-sets-panel-investigate-Panama-Papers.html |archivedate=July 26, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Syria ====
[[Rami Makhlouf]], a maternal cousin of [[Bashar Al-Assad]], was worth an estimated $5 billion before the [[Syrian Civil War]], and had control of 60% of the economy.

==== Thailand ====
The ''[[Bangkok Post]]'' reported that the "[[Anti-Money Laundering Office (Thailand)|Anti-Money Laundering Office]] (AMLO) is seeking information from its foreign counterparts regarding twenty-one Thai nationals reportedly included in a list of people worldwide using a Panama-based law firm apparently specializing in money laundering and tax evasion." It is not clear why AMLO is investigating only twenty-one. The Panama Papers include at least 780 names of individuals based in Thailand and another 50 companies based in Thailand. Some are foreigners or foreign-owned companies, but 634 individual addresses in Thailand appear in the documents that have surfaced to date, including the CEOs of giant companies [[Bangkok Land]] and Phatra Finance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/920929/many-thais-implicated-in-global-scandal |title='Many' Thais implicated in global scandal |work=Bangkok Post |date=April 4, 2016 |accessdate=April 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigations by ICIJ's sole [[East Asian]] partner ''CommonWealth Magazine'' in [[Taiwan]] found that at least 2,725 offshore companies had registered addresses in Taiwan.

The publisher concludes that: "Taiwanese companies and individuals are believed to be extensively using offshore shelters to avoid or evade taxes ... after scouring the Panama Papers documents that Mossack Fonseca has not been one of their main conduits. This time, it appears that big Taiwanese banks, law firms and accounting firms did not often use the services of Mossack Fonseca, which does not have a presence in Taiwan. The forty-six Taiwanese brokers that did work with Mossack Fonseca were relatively small-scale consulting firms operating in Greater China. Most of the Taiwanese entities that set up shell companies through the Panamanian law firm were small, unlisted companies or individuals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.cw.com.tw/article.do?action=show&amp;id=15079 |title=CommonWealth Magazine |publisher=English.cw.com.tw |date= |accessdate=2016-05-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160531210910/http://english.cw.com.tw/article.do?action=show&amp;id=15079 |archivedate=May 31, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Costa Rica ====
The administration of President [[Luis Guillermo Solís]] suggested that some of the activity unveiled by the leaked documents suggests attempts to [[tax evasion|evade taxes]]. His administration's effort to implement tax increases and reforms has met strong resistance from opposition and business figures.&lt;ref name=TT&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ticotimes.net/2016/04/05/costa-rica-panama-papers-leak |title=Costa Rica in the Panama Papers leak |date=April 5, 2016 |accessdate=April 29, 2016 |work=The Tico Times News |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425233246/http://www.ticotimes.net/2016/04/05/costa-rica-panama-papers-leak |archivedate=April 25, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaked documents suggest that Mossack Fonseca helped tuna export company Borda Azul set up a shell company in the British Virgin Islands in order to avoid Costa Rican taxes. The firm, now out of business, was headed by Hermes Navarro, president of the [[Costa Rican Football Federation]] from 1999 to 2006.&lt;ref name=TT /&gt; In the late 1990s the Finance Ministry and Prosecutor's Office investigated Borda Azul and other export companies for allegedly misusing tax credit certificates; in 1997 dozens of companies had been accused of using the certificates for fraud and to launder drug profits.&lt;ref name=TT /&gt;

According to ICIJ investigative partners DataBaseAR and Seminario Universidad, Mossack Fonseca helped Borda Azul fabricate invoices to allow it to report both inflated costs—to reduce its taxes—and inflated exports, to allow it to continue to qualify for the tax credit certificates. In a letter dated October 19, 1998, a Mossack Fonseca lawyer explained the investigation to the Panama City office and concluded:

{{Quote|In the worst of circumstances, being very fatalistic, the Costa Rican government could, after years of investigation, suspend the transfer of CATs to Borda Azul for irregularities but never send anyone to jail. |source=a Mossack Fonseca lawyer&lt;ref name=TT /&gt;}}

More than thirty Costa Rican law firms are mentioned in the Panama Papers as referring clients to Mossack Fonseca, resulting in the creation of more than 360 shell companies. in particular Gonzalo Fajardo &amp; Asociados, founded by former Finance Ministry official and later Economy Minister Gonzalo Fajardo Salas, and over nearly two decades helped Costa Rican companies set up 82 offshore corporations in tax havens, according to DataBaseAR.&lt;ref name=TT /&gt;

Finance Vice Minister Fernando Rodríguez said Costa Rica will push to sign a [[Tax Information Exchange Agreement]] with Panama.&lt;ref name=TTleg&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ticotimes.net/2016/04/06/costa-rica-propose-panama-tax-information-exchange-agreement |title=Panama Papers scandal cracks open window for Costa Rica tax reform |date=April 6, 2016 |accessdate=April 29, 2016 |author=L.Arias |work=The Tico Times News |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425233200/http://www.ticotimes.net/2016/04/06/costa-rica-propose-panama-tax-information-exchange-agreement |archivedate=April 25, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Legislators from several parties are trying to line up political consensus to seek approval of the administration's tax fraud bill and to form a legislative commission to investigate those named in the Panama Papers, according to [[Emilia Molina Cruz]] of the [[Citizens' Action Party (Costa Rica)|Citizens' Action Party]].&lt;ref name=TTleg /&gt; While opposition parties have maintained that the country's financial problems stem from excess spending, according to the Finance Department, the sums Costa Rica loses to tax evasion equal about 8% of the country's gross domestic product, while its deficits have run at about 6%.&lt;ref name=TTleg /&gt;

===== Panama Free Trade Agreement =====

The [[Panama–United States Trade Promotion Agreement|Panama Free Trade Agreement]],&lt;!-- Majority of sources use phrase "Panama Free Trade Agreement --&gt; supported by Obama and Clinton, has been accused of enabling the practices detailed within the Panama Papers through regulatory oversight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mindock |first1=Clark |title=Panama Papers: Obama, Clinton Pushed Trade Deal Amid Warnings It Would Make Money Laundering, Tax Evasion Worse |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/panama-papers-obama-clinton-pushed-trade-deal-amid-warnings-it-would-make-money-2348076 |work=International Business Times |date=April 4, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425114027/http://www.ibtimes.com/panama-papers-obama-clinton-pushed-trade-deal-amid-warnings-it-would-make-money-2348076 |archivedate=April 25, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an Obama administration official said the argument has "zero merit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mauldin |first1=William |last2=Viswanatha |first2=Aruna |title=Sanders Says U.S. Helped Panama as a Tax Haven But Skips Over Tax Pact |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/sanders-say-u-s-helped-panama-as-a-tax-haven-but-skips-over-tax-pact-1460058370 |accessdate=April 24, 2016 |work=Wall Street Journal |date=April 7, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423161258/http://www.wsj.com/articles/sanders-say-u-s-helped-panama-as-a-tax-haven-but-skips-over-tax-pact-1460058370 |archivedate=April 23, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; John Cassidy of ''[[The New Yorker]],'' said the Panama Free Trade Agreement actually forced Panama to release information to the American regulatory authorities on "the ownership of companies, partnerships, trusts, foundations, and other persons".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/panama-papers-why-arent-there-more-american-names |title=Panama Papers: Why Aren't There More American Names? |last=Cassidy |first=John |date=April 5, 2016 |newspaper=The New Yorker |issn=0028-792X |access-date=April 18, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424061651/http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/panama-papers-why-arent-there-more-american-names |archivedate=April 24, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- deleting eoin higgins again, no evidence he is anything other than some dude with an MA that isn't even in business, and I looked pretty hard.

Citing leaked diplomatic cables, ''Fortune'' writer Chris Matthews speculated that Obama and Clinton may have supported the agreement, after opposing it while campaigning for office, because it was a ''[[quid pro quo]]'' for Panamanian support of US efforts against drug trafficking. In any event, he notes, while it is true that the agreement abolished limits on fund transfers between the US and Panama, the Obama administration insisted that the two countries first sign a [[Tax information exchange agreement|Tax Information and Exchange Agreement]] as well, which facilitated the exchange of tax information between the countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://fortune.com/2016/04/08/panama-papers-sanders-clinton/ |title=Panama Papers: Why Did Clinton and Obama Flip Flop on Trade with Panama |first=Chris |last=Matthews |date=April 8, 2016 |accessdate=April 20, 2016 |work=Fortune |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423073913/http://fortune.com/2016/04/08/panama-papers-sanders-clinton/ |archivedate=April 23, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== After the leak =====

President Barack Obama addressed the overseas shell companies listed by the leak in a press conference: "It's not that they're breaking the laws," he said, "it's that the laws are so poorly designed that they allow people, if they've got enough lawyers and enough accountants, to wiggle out of responsibilities that ordinary citizens are having to abide by."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Boland-Rudder |first1=Hamish |last2=Holmes |first2=Allan |last3=Chittum |first3=Ryan |title=Impact of Panama Papers rockets around the world; U.S. officials react cautiously |url=https://www.publicintegrity.org/2016/04/05/19526/white-house-and-us-officials-react-cautiously-panama-papers |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529034506/https://www.publicintegrity.org/2016/04/05/19526/white-house-and-us-officials-react-cautiously-panama-papers |archivedate=2016-05-29 |accessdate=April 7, 2016 |work=Center for Public Integrity}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although no leader in the US was mentioned in the Panama Papers, Obama said that "Frankly, folks in America are taking advantage of the same stuff".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Revesz |first1=Rachael |title=Obama says Americans are doing the same Panama Papers tax avoidance as everyone else |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/panama-papers-tax-avoidance-obama-says-frankly-americans-are-doing-the-same-a6970106.html |accessdate=April 23, 2016 |work=The Independent |date=April 5, 2016 |location=New York, United States |language=English |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424225248/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/panama-papers-tax-avoidance-obama-says-frankly-americans-are-doing-the-same-a6970106.html |archivedate=April 24, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[McClatchy Newspapers]] initially found four Americans with offshore shell companies named in the documents.

* Shell companies can be created in the United States.
* Major international banks based in America tend to have offshore accounts in the Cayman Islands instead.
* US laws like the [[Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act]] (FATCA) and the [[Tax information exchange agreement|Tax Information Exchange Agreements]] (TIEAs) of 2010 have meant that the "tax evasion game [was] principally over for American taxpayers".

===== Néstor Kirchner and Cristina Fernández de Kirchner =====
Daniel Muñoz, the private secretary and confidant of former Argentinian president [[Néstor Kirchner]] later also served for two years as an aide to Néstor Kirchner's wife, [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]], who was president of Argentina from 2007 to 2015. Muñoz and his wife were linked to Gold Black Limited, a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands in 2010 to invest in US real estate. The origin of the company's funds was listed as "personal savings". From 2010 to the beginning of 2015, the company's ownership was through bearer shares, a financial instrument that can be used to hide an owner's identity. One of the directors, Sergio Tadisco, told ICIJ partner Canal Trece that he was just a figurehead who said he agreed to his name being used in 2011 because of his friendship with Muñoz and his wife. In January 2015, Muñoz and his wife became named shareholders, owning 50 percent each. By that time, Mossack Fonseca had become the registered agent of Gold Black. However, only three weeks later, its compliance department proposed resigning because Muñoz was identified in connection with the governments of the Kirchners. The resignation became effective in June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://panamapapers.icij.org/the_power_players/|title=The Power Players|access-date=2017-07-16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404030817/https://panamapapers.icij.org/the_power_players/|archivedate=April 4, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://noticias.perfil.com/2013/05/07/quien-es-daniel-munoz-el-valijero-de-kirchner/|title=Quién es Daniel Muñoz, el "valijero" de Kirchner {{!}} Revista Noticias|access-date=2017-07-16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170907160557/http://noticias.perfil.com/2013/05/07/quien-es-daniel-munoz-el-valijero-de-kirchner/|archivedate=September 7, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1885925-panama-papers-los-kirchner-se-desvincularon-de-la-investigacion-sobre-sociedades-offshore|title=Panama Papers: los Kirchner se desvincularon de la investigación sobre sociedades offshore|access-date=2017-07-16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171002073628/http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1885925-panama-papers-los-kirchner-se-desvincularon-de-la-investigacion-sobre-sociedades-offshore|archivedate=October 2, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Muñoz was investigated for illicit enrichment, a charge that was later dropped. In 2013, Argentinian media reported that Muñoz had helped transfer "bags of money" belonging to President Néstor Kirchner from Buenos Aires, the Argentine capital, to Santa Cruz, the Kirchner's home state. Charges in relation to the matter were dismissed in July 2015 for lack of evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.clarin.com/politica/piloto-confirmo-vuelos-secretario-kirchner_0_HyngMUOov7x.html |title=Un piloto confirmó los vuelos con dinero del secretario de Kirchner |last=Clarin.com |website=www.clarin.com |language=es |access-date=2017-07-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012202312/https://www.clarin.com/politica/piloto-confirmo-vuelos-secretario-kirchner_0_HyngMUOov7x.html |archivedate=October 12, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 25, 2016 he died from a cancer that he had for the last four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.urgente24.com/252997-murio-daniel-munoz-senalado-como-valijero-de-kirchner |title=Murió Daniel Muñoz, señalado como 'valijero' de Kirchner |work=Urgente24 |access-date=2017-07-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013014101/https://www.urgente24.com/252997-murio-daniel-munoz-senalado-como-valijero-de-kirchner |archivedate=October 13, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Brazil ====
Five billionaires from Brazil, the sons of two Brazilian billionaires, and four former billionaire Brazilian families appear in the Panama Papers leak, according to [[Forbes]]. The Brazilian news website [[Universo Online|UOL]] has access to the leaked documents and has published an article and a list. Like many Panama Paper reports, their story cautions that some of the people mentioned in the documents may be doing nothing wrong: "In general there is nothing illegal per se in having an offshore company and in fact it is very common for an international business to set one up for transactions and joint ventures when they're doing business all over the world," said Brazil-based Marcello Hallake, a Brazil-based partner of the law firm [[Jones Day]].&lt;ref name=bill&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kerryadolan/2016/04/14/billionaires-from-brazil-and-mexico-named-in-the-panama-papers-leak/#78466d412119 |title=Billionaires From Brazil And Mexico Named In The Panama Papers Leak |date=14 April 2016 |accessdate=19 April 2016 |author=Kerry Dolan |publisher=Forbes |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422155920/http://www.forbes.com/sites/kerryadolan/2016/04/14/billionaires-from-brazil-and-mexico-named-in-the-panama-papers-leak/#78466d412119 |archivedate=April 22, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three men ([[Marcel Herrmann Telles]], [[Carlos Alberto Sicupira]] and Jorge Felipe Lemann, son of their long-time business partner [[Jorge Paulo Lemann]], Brazil's richest man and a controlling shareholder of [[Anheuser-Busch InBev]]) set up three offshore companies in the British Virgin Islands and the Bahamas tied to private equity firm [[3G]] and to beer firm Ambev, a unit of Anheuser-Busch Inbev, according to UOL. Two of the companies are no longer active and the men are no longer tied with the third. They told UOL the companies had been publicly disclosed and registered.

Police raided the [[São Paulo]] offices of Mossack Fonseca in January 2016, seeking records about offshore companies the firm opened for two former executives of Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. ([[Petrobras]]) who were convicted in 2015 of corruption and money laundering. Police say the companies were used to hide illegally diverted funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2016/04/05/panama-leak-involves-firm-probed-in-petrobras-scandal-energy-journal/ |title=Panama Leak Involves Firm Probed in Petrobras Scandal — Energy Journal |author=Christopher Harder |date=April 5, 2016 |accessdate=April 18, 2016 |publisher=Wall Street Journal |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412041544/http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2016/04/05/panama-leak-involves-firm-probed-in-petrobras-scandal-energy-journal/ |archivedate=April 12, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Operation Car Wash =====
In January 2016, even before the Panama Papers were published, the Brazilian Federal Police, as part of a corruption investigation known as [[Operation Car Wash]], had already accused Mossack Fonseca's law firm of helping suspects create offshore entities to hide corrupt money. They alleged that the firm used a real estate company to help hide criminal proceeds from the scheme involving [[Petrobras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Blankfeld |first1=Karen |title=Law Firm At Center of Panama Papers Leak Was Implicated In Brazil Corruption Scandal In January |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kerenblankfeld/2016/04/04/law-firm-at-center-of-panama-papers-leak-was-implicated-in-brazil-corruption-scandal-in-january/ |accessdate=April 20, 2016 |work=[[Forbes]] |date=April 4, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20171018055159/https://www.forbes.com/sites/kerenblankfeld/2016/04/04/law-firm-at-center-of-panama-papers-leak-was-implicated-in-brazil-corruption-scandal-in-january/ |archivedate=October 18, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====== Impeachment ======
The leak complicated an already volatile political situation in Brazil, where a tanking economy had led to calls for the impeachment of President [[Dilma Rousseff]] amid many revelations of political corruption. As impeachment proceedings began, it became clear that the next two people in the order of succession have been implicated in the [[Petrobras]] scandal. According to ''[[O Estado de São Paulo]]'', a company belonging to [[Eduardo Cunha]], speaker of the lower house of the legislature and a leader of the impeachment drive, has surfaced in the Panama Papers.&lt;ref name=TTLatin&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ticotimes.net/2016/04/04/officials-latin-america-linked-panama-papers |title=Officials in Latin America linked to 'Panama Papers' |author=AFP |date=April 4, 2016 |accessdate=April 29, 2016 |work=The Tico Times News |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425233311/http://www.ticotimes.net/2016/04/04/officials-latin-america-linked-panama-papers |archivedate=April 25, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rousseff herself is not mentioned in the papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/25/world/americas/dilma-rousseff-president-of-brazil-resists-calls-for-her-resignation.html |title=Dilma Rousseff, President of Brazil, Resists Calls for Her Resignation |publisher=New York Times |date=24 March 2016 |accessdate=19 April 2016 |author=Simon Romero |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416010838/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/25/world/americas/dilma-rousseff-president-of-brazil-resists-calls-for-her-resignation.html |archivedate=April 16, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Politicians from seven different political parties in Brazil were named as clients of Mossack Fonseca. Leaked files mention politicians from Brazil's largest party, the [[PMDB]], which broke away from President [[Dilma Rousseff]]'s coalition in 2016. Political figures from the [[PSDB]], the most prominent opposition party in the country, were also mentioned in the leaks, as well as others from the [[Democratic Labour Party (Brazil)|PDT]], PP, PSB, PSD and the PTB parties. No politicians from [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Rousseff's party]] were mentioned in the leaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cascione |first1=Silvio |last2=Simon |first2=W |title=Brazil politicians linked to offshore companies in Panama leaks: paper |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-panama-tax-brazil-idUSKCN0X11C1 |accessdate=April 20, 2016 |work=[[Reuters]] |date=April 4, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419084505/http://www.reuters.com/article/us-panama-tax-brazil-idUSKCN0X11C1 |archivedate=April 19, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of Dutch journalists from the daily newspaper ''[[Trouw]]'' found evidence in the Panama Papers showing that [[TV Globo]] is cited "many times" in a money laundering investigation of the [[De Nederlandsche Bank]] which revealed that for years the media outlet conducted "irregular financial transactions" through tax havens in order to pay for broadcast rights for the [[Copa Libertadores]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Brazilian-Media-Giant-Globo-Implicated-in-the-Panama-Papers-20160406-0001.html Brazilian Media Giant Globo Implicated in the Panama Papers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160410094618/http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Brazilian-Media-Giant-Globo-Implicated-in-the-Panama-Papers-20160406-0001.html |date=April 10, 2016 }} by teleSUR (2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice the requirement is widely ignored, and an investigation by African Network of Centers for Investigative Reporting (ANCIR) found examples in the leaked Mossack Fonseca documents of anonymous shell companies doing the sourcing. For a start, most of the DRC gold winds up in Dubai by way of Uganda. Dubai's $75 billion gold industry is regulated with a very light hand by the quasi-private [[Dubai Multi Commodities Centre]] (DMCC).&lt;ref name="Dgold" /&gt;

Citp was managed by Kane, a close friend of the president's chief of staff, Maixent Accrombessi, himself held in Paris and interrogated in August 2015. French officials wanted to ask Accrombessi about a contract between Marck and the Gabonese Ministry of the Interior for €7 million. The head of Marck, Philippe Belin, was also held and questioned.

[[File:Karim Wade.jpg|thumb|upright|Senegalese politician [[Karim Wade]] ]]
&lt;!-- this material draws heavily on the exclusive reporting of the French-language online news site Ouestaf as part of the year-long investigation of journalists world-wide into the data contained in the Panama Papers --&gt;
ICIJ partner Ouestaf.com was able to establish through the Panama Papers the existence of secret contracts between and [[DP World]] FZE (DP)and Mamadou Pouye, the [[bribery]] codefendant of [[Karim Wade]], son of former prime minister [[Abdoulaye Wade]]. This information was not available at their trial; Ouestaf confirmed their financial ties to the corporation for the first time during the Panama Papers investigation.&lt;ref name="OuPiste"/&gt; &lt;!-- this material from Karim Wade article on French wikipedia start --&gt; Wade was sentenced in 2015 to a six-year prison term by the Cour de répression de l'enrichissement illicite (Crei), a specialized anti-corruption court.&lt;ref name="OuPiste"/&gt; Wade was accused of illegally amassing assets of more than $240 million; and his childhood friend Pouye was sentenced to five years for allegedly helping him.&lt;ref name="OuPiste"/&gt; Both denied wrongdoing and the United Nations and Amnesty International said their rights had been violated at trial.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |title=Karim Wade And Mamadou Pouye Named In The Panama Papers Scandal! |url=http://www.freedomnewspaper.com/karim-wade-mamadou-pouye-named-panama-papers-scandal |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409095013/http://www.freedomnewspaper.com/karim-wade-mamadou-pouye-named-panama-papers-scandal/ |archivedate=April 9, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ouestaf's investigation did not address the legality of their trial. It did conclude that they had succeeded in tracing a payment to Pouye's oversea shell company from a subsidiary of DP.

Wade remains a member of the [[Senegalese Democratic Party]] (PDS) and is still the PDS candidate for the 2017 presidential election.&lt;!-- this material from Karim wade article on French wikipedia stop --&gt;

Mossack Fonseca documents show that Pouye owned three offshore companies, Seabury Inc, Regory Invest and Latvae Inc.&lt;ref name=OuPiste/&gt;

* Through Seabury, a consulting contract worth €7.2 million with [[DP World]] materialized.&lt;ref name=OuPiste/&gt;
* A second contract for 2013–2015 was to focus on DP's African holdings, and would have paid Wade and Puye $3 million at signing;&lt;ref name=OuPiste/&gt; however the pair were arrested.&lt;ref name=OuPiste/&gt;

Seabury seems to have been set up solely for doing business with DP World. It was started in 2008, a year after Senegal signed a contract with DP World for rights to the container terminal at the [[Autonomous Port of Dakar]].&lt;ref name=OuPiste/&gt; In April 2009 Wade became minister of international cooperation, of territorial development, air transport and infrastructure, which he remained until his father's defeat by [[Macky Sall]] in the 2012 election.&lt;ref name=OuPiste/&gt; Regory Invest acted as a Seabury subcontractor, receiving €65,000 euros a month, according to the documents.&lt;ref name=OuPiste/&gt;

According to ''Ouestaf'' the documents make it clear that while Crei investigators were interested in the funds in Pouye's Monaco account, they did not know that their source was an offshore account he created himself.&lt;ref name=OuPiste/&gt; The two contracts prove that there was in fact a relationship between the defendants and [[DP World]]. Investigator Papa Alboury Ndao told the court in February{{when|date=May 2016}} that he had discovered two payments of $13 million each from a subsidiary of DP World FZE to a Singapore bank account belonging to Karim Wade. However the bank in Singapore refused to cooperate and Ndao was forced to drop that line of inquiry.&lt;ref name=OuPiste/&gt;

===== Others =====
Mossack Fonseca opened several offshore companies for multinationals. For example: Anglogold, owner of Anglogold Investments Senegal Ltd et Anglogold Exploration Senegal Ltd (both based in the British Virgin Islands).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://panamapapers.investigativecenters.org/senegal-wade/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529033915/https://panamapapers.investigativecenters.org/senegal-wade/ |archivedate=2016-05-29 |title=et sociétés offshore : sur la piste des fonds de Karim Wade? |author=ANCIR |work=#Panama Papers |accessdate=May 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sierra Leone ====
{{See also|Mining in Sierra Leone|United Nations Security Council Resolution 1306}}
The ICIJ investigation traces out many levels of offshore holdings in multiple countries related to the business dealings of [[Beny Steinmetz]], with many serious findings such as a request that Mossack Fonseca backdate the revocation of a power of attorney.&lt;ref name=NamStein&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.namibian.com.na/Sierra-Leone's-flawed-diamond-trade/39957/read |title=Sierra Leone's flawed diamond trade |author1=Khadija Sharife |author2=Silas Gbandia |date=April 26, 2016 |accessdate=April 27, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510111253/http://www.namibian.com.na/Sierra-Leone's-flawed-diamond-trade/39957/read |archivedate=May 10, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mossack Fonseca records show that Sierra Leone diamond exporter Octea, based in the British Virgin Islands with the Steinmetz family as its beneficiaries, is wholly owned by Guernsey-based BSGR Resources, linked to a bribery scandal in Guinea. Foundations in Switzerland and Liechtenstein, among them Nysco and Balda, own BSGR. In 2007, one of Nysco's bank accounts contained $27.7 million.

Steinmetz, who has a personal fortune of $6 billion, supplies diamonds to [[Tiffany &amp; Co.|Tiffany]] and [[DeBeers]] and is Sierra Leone's largest private investor. Yet, according to a detailed report in ''The Namibian'', his Octea subsidiary owes, among other debts, property taxes of $700,000 to the city of [[Koidu]]. These unpaid taxes are discounted, according to mayor [[Saa Emerson Lamina]], because Octea promised a 5% profit−sharing agreement, and payment 1% of its annual profit to a community development fund, but it did not do this either.&lt;ref name=NamStein /&gt;

Octea's subsidiary, Koidu Holdings, obtained the mine for $28 million, which was supposed to be a deposit, in 2002. Fighting had stopped in Sierra Leone, and the mine had previously been held and worked by South African firm Branch Energy, in payment for the services of its parent company, [[Executive Outcomes]], "effectively...a military battalion for hire,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/daily/oct99/sierra16.htm |title=Diamond Hunters Fuel Africa's Brutal Wars |author=James Rupert |date=October 16, 1999 |publisher=Washington Post |accessdate=May 8, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510210155/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/daily/oct99/sierra16.htm |archivedate=May 10, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; against rebel fighters in the area. Steinmetz has since put $300 million into the project.&lt;ref name=bb /&gt;

According to reporting by the African Network of Centers for Investigative Reporting (ANCIR), the company produces 60–90% of Sierra Leone's diamond exports, and in some months between 2012 and 2015 exported more than US$330 million in rough diamonds.&lt;ref name=NamStein /&gt; Octea owes US$150 million in unpaid loans.&lt;ref name=NamStein /&gt; Although government records show taxes paid by other diamond companies, none are listed for Octea.

The National Mineral Agency (NMA) until 2005 valued diamonds for export using a price book based on 1996 figures. Companies also often seek to minimize the value of their diamond exports to reduce taxes and move profits abroad. Once transferred to a subsidiary elsewhere where their value is not taxed, the same diamonds are frequently worth more.&lt;ref name=NamStein /&gt;

Diamonds from Koidu average $330 a carat, roughly 50% more than De Beers's Jwaneng mine in Botswana, the world's biggest. Tiffany has first pick of some of the best stones mined at Koidu and the remainder are sold to other trade buyers, according to ''Bloomberg''.&lt;ref name=bb&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-12/was-billionaire-steinmetz-betrayed-by-his-ceo-over-diamond-mine- |title=Was Billionaire Steinmetz Betrayed by CEO Over Diamond Mine? |work=Bloomberg |accessdate=May 8, 2016 |date=November 11, 2016 |author1=Thomas Biesheuvel |author2=Jesse Riseborough |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160411202637/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-12/was-billionaire-steinmetz-betrayed-by-his-ceo-over-diamond-mine- |archivedate=April 11, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 22, 2016, Australia said it would create a public register showing the beneficial, or actual, owners of shell companies, as part of an effort to stamp out tax avoidance by multinational corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scmp.com/news/asia/australasia/article/1937728/australia-create-public-register-shell-company-owners-wake |title=Australia to create public register of shell company owners, in wake of Panama Papers |publisher=South China Morning Post |date=April 22, 2016 |accessdate=April 22, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423193649/http://www.scmp.com/news/asia/australasia/article/1937728/australia-create-public-register-shell-company-owners-wake |archivedate=April 23, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaked documents examined by the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] "pierced the veil of anonymous shell companies" and linked a Sydney businessman and a Brisbane geologist to mining deals in North Korea.&lt;ref name=ABCkor&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2015/s4438502.htm |title=Panama papers reveal evidence Australians are involved in deals with North Korea that could be in breach of sanctions |author1=Mark Willacy |author2=Lisa Main |author3=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=April 6, 2016 |accessdate=April 29, 2016 |work=7.30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160511224134/http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2015/s4438502.htm |archivedate=May 11, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Rather than applying sanctions, the Australian Government and the [[Australian Securities Exchange|ASX]] seem to have allowed a coach and horses to be ridden through them by the people involved in forming this relationship, corporate relationship with one of the primary arms manufacturers in North Korea," said Thomas Clark of the [[University of Technology Sydney]].&lt;ref name=ABCkor /&gt;

David Sutton was director of AAT Corporation and EHG Corporation when they held mineral licenses in North Korea and did business with Korean Natural Resources Development and Investment Corporation, which is under [[United Nations]] sanctions, and North Korea's "primary arms dealer and main exporter of goods and equipment related to ballistic missiles and conventional weapons, responsible for approximately half of the arms exported by North Korea."&lt;ref name=ABCkor /&gt; The geologist, Louis Schurmann, said British billionaire [[Kevin Leech]] was key to putting the deal together.&lt;ref name=ABCkor /&gt; Leaked documents also reveal the involvement of another Briton, Gibraltar-based John Lister.&lt;ref name=ABCkor /&gt; According to ABC, the [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]] was aware of these mining deals, which had also been brought up in the [[Australian Senate]], but nobody ever referred the matter to the [[Australian Federal Police]].&lt;ref name=ABCkor /&gt;

On May 12, 2016, the names of former [[Prime Minister of Australia]] [[Malcolm Turnbull]], and former [[Premier of New South Wales]] [[Neville Wran]], were both found in the Panama Papers, due to the pair's former directorship of the Mossack Fonseca-incorporated company ''Star Technology Systems Limited''. Turnbull and Wran resigned from these positions in 1995, and the Prime Minister has denied any impropriety, stating "had [Star Technology] made any profits—which it did not regrettably—it certainly would have paid [[Taxation in Australia|tax in Australia]]."&lt;ref name="ABC Turnbull"&gt;{{cite web |title=Malcolm Turnbull denies any wrongdoing after being listed in Panama Papers |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-05-12/turnbull-listed-in-panama-papers/7407424 |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)]] |accessdate=May 12, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160512104823/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-05-12/turnbull-listed-in-panama-papers/7407424 |archivedate=May 12, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cook Islands ====
Media initially reported that the Panama Papers lists 500 entities created under the jurisdiction of the Cook Islands, population 10,000, almost as many as Singapore, whose population is 5.7 million.&lt;ref name=APNZ /&gt; After the [[Winebox Inquiry|Winebox affair]], the Cook Islands gave New Zealand jurisdiction over tax matters.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |title=Panama Papers whistleblower cites Pacific isles, NZ, for good reasons |author=Simon Louisson |work=The Standard |url=http://thestandard.org.nz/panama-papers-whistleblower-cites-pacific-isles-nz-for-good-reasons/ |date=May 8, 2016 |accessdate=May 18, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510031659/http://thestandard.org.nz/panama-papers-whistleblower-cites-pacific-isles-nz-for-good-reasons/ |archivedate=May 10, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== New Zealand ====
New Zealand's [[Inland Revenue Department (New Zealand)|Inland Revenue Department]] said that they were working to obtain details of people who have [[tax residence]] in the country who may have been involved in arrangements facilitated by Mossack Fonseca.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-panama-tax-australia-idUSKCN0X102E |title=Tax authorities begin probes into some people named in Panama Papers leak |date=April 4, 2016 |first1=Jane |last1=Wardell |first2=Elida |last2=Moreno |work=[[Reuters]] |accessdate=April 4, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404020808/http://www.reuters.com/article/us-panama-tax-australia-idUSKCN0X102E |archivedate=April 4, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Gerard Ryle]], director of the [[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists]], told Radio New Zealand on April 8, 2016 that New Zealand is a well-known tax haven and a "nice front for criminals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/78694086/nz-a-nice-front-for-criminals-panama-papers-journalist |title=NZ a 'nice front' for criminals |date=April 8, 2016 |accessdate=April 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand provides overseas investors with foreign trusts and [[Look-through company|look-through companies]]. New Zealand government policy is to not request disclosure of the identity of either the settlor or the beneficiaries of the trust, and thus the ownership remains secret, and as a consequence, thus hiding the assets from the trust-holder's home jurisdictions. These trusts are not taxed in New Zealand. These trusts can then be used to acquire and own New Zealand registered companies, which become a vehicle by which the trust owners can exercise day to day control over their assets. These New Zealand-registered companies can be designed not to make a profit using loans from tax havens and other profit shifting techniques: the result being tax free income with the general respectability that has typically been associated with companies registered in New Zealand.

Prime Minister [[John Key]] responded May 7 to [[John Doe (Panama Papers' whistleblower)|John Doe]]'s remark that he had been "curiously quiet" about tax evasion in the [[Cook Islands]] by saying that the whistleblower was confused and probably European. While the Cook Islands use New Zealand currency, "I have as much responsibility for tax in the Cook Islands as I do for taxing Russia." New Zealand does represent the Cook Islands on defence and foreign policy, but not taxation, he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/79731038/panama-papers-whistleblower-calls-out-john-key-over-silence-on-fraud-mecca |title=Panama Papers whistleblower confused – John Key |author1=Tracy Watkins |author2=Ellen Read |author3=Simon Maude |date=May 7, 2016 |accessdate=May 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In distancing New Zealand from the Cook Islands, Key ignored the close ties between the two countries and the crucial role New Zealand had in setting up the Cook Island taxation system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/money/8515361/Money-trail-leads-home-to-New-Zealand |title=Money trail leads home to New Zealand |work=Stuff |accessdate=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Niue ====
Mossack Fonseca approached [[Niue]] in 1996 and offered to help set up a tax haven on the tiny South Sea island. The law firm drafted the necessary legislation, permitting offshore companies to operate in total secrecy. They took care of all the paperwork, the island got a modest fee for each filing, and it seemed like quite a deal, even if they were required by law now to provide all banking paperwork in Russian and Chinese as well as English.&lt;ref name=DBNiue&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/04/06/the-polynesian-rock-that-made-millions-from-panama-papers-crooks.html |title=Polynesian 'Rock' That Made Millions From Panama Papers' Crooks: How Niue, a coral outcropping with just 1,190 residents, rolled out the welcome mat for Mossack Fonseca, the law firm at the center of the massive records leak—and made a tidy profit |date=April 5, 2016 |accessdate=April 26, 2016 |author=Michael Daly |work=Daily Beast |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502191518/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/04/06/the-polynesian-rock-that-made-millions-from-panama-papers-crooks.html |archivedate=May 2, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon the filings almost covered the island's year budget. The US government however made official noises in 2001 about laundering criminal proceeds and [[Chase Bank]] blacklisted the island and [[Bank of New York]] followed suit. This caused inconvenience to the population so they let their contract with Mossack Fonseca expire and many of the privacy-seekers on the banking world moved on.&lt;ref name=DBNiue /&gt; Some did stay however, apparently; the Panama Papers database lists nearly 10,000 companies and trusts set up on Niue, population 1200.&lt;ref name=APNZ /&gt;

==== Samoa ====
Many recently created shell companies were set up in Samoa, perhaps after Niue revised its tax laws. The Panama Papers database lists more than 13,000 companies and trusts set up there. Samoa has a population of roughly 200,000.&lt;ref name=APNZ&gt;

== FIFA investigation ==
On May 27, 2015, the US Department of Justice indicted a number of companies and individuals for conspiracy, corruption and racketeering in connection with bribes and kickbacks paid to obtain media and marketing rights for FIFA tournaments. Some immediately entered guilty pleas.&lt;ref name=indictFIFA&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/nine-fifa-officials-and-five-corporate-executives-indicted-racketeering-conspiracy-and |title=Nine FIFA Officials and Five Corporate Executives Indicted for Racketeering Conspiracy and Corruption |date=27 May 2015 |accessdate=19 April 2016 |publisher=United States Department of Justice |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417221705/https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/nine-fifa-officials-and-five-corporate-executives-indicted-racketeering-conspiracy-and |archivedate=April 17, 2016 |df=mdy-all }} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among those indicted were [[Jeffrey Webb]] and [[Jack Warner (football executive)|Jack Warner]], the current and former presidents of [[CONCACAF]], the continental confederation under FIFA headquartered in the United States. They were charged with racketeering and bribery offenses. Others were US and South American sports marketing executives who paid and agreed to pay well over $150 million in bribes and kickbacks.&lt;ref name=indictFIFA/&gt;

On December 12, 2014, [[José Hawilla]], the owner and founder of the [[Traffic Group]], the Brazilian sports marketing conglomerate, waived indictment and pleaded guilty to a four-count information charging him with racketeering conspiracy, wire fraud conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy and obstruction of justice. Hawilla also agreed to forfeit over $151 million, $25 million of which was paid at the time of his plea.&lt;ref name=indictFIFA/&gt;

[[Image:Mosaicr seagull.jpg|thumb|200px|A photographic mosaic of a [[sea gull]] made from pictures of [[bird]]s and other [[nature]] photos using [[hexagon]]al tiles]]

In the field of photographic  imaging, a '''photographic mosaic''', also known under the term '''Photomosaic''', a [[portmanteau]] of photo and [[mosaic]], is a picture (usually a [[photograph]]) that has been divided into (usually equal sized) tiled sections, each of which is replaced with another photograph that matches the target photo.&lt;ref name="Cartwright07"&gt;Cartwright (2007) p.102 quote: Photographic mosaic, also known as Photomosaic, a portmanteau of photo and mosaic, is a picture that is divided into small sections. When viewed as a whole, it appears to be one image, when in fact the image is made up of hundreds or even thousands of smaller images.&lt;/ref&gt; When viewed at low magnifications, the individual [[pixel]]s appear as the primary image, while close examination reveals that the image is in fact made up of many hundreds or thousands of smaller images.&lt;ref name="Cartwright07"/&gt; Most of the time they are a computer-created type of [[Photomontage|montage]].

There are two kinds of mosaic, depending on how the matching is done.  In the simpler kind, each part of the target image is averaged down to a single color.  Each of the library images is also reduced to a single color.  Each part of the target image is then replaced with one from the library where these colors are as similar as possible.  In effect, the target image is reduced in resolution (by [[downsampling]]), and then each of the resulting pixels is replaced with an image whose average color matches that pixel.

In the more advanced kind of photographic mosaic, the target image is not downsampled, and the matching is done by comparing each pixel in the rectangle to the corresponding pixel from each library image.  The rectangle in the target is then replaced with the library image that minimizes the total difference.  This requires much more computation than the simple kind, but the results can be much better since the pixel-by-pixel matching can preserve the resolution of the target image.

Originally, the term ''photomosaic'' referred to compound photographs created by stitching together a series of adjacent pictures of a scene. Space scientists have been assembling mosaics of this kind since at least as early as the Soviet Union space satellite missions to the moon in the late 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = To a Rocky Moon: A Geologist's History of Lunar Exploration|last = Wilhelms|first = Don E.|publisher = University of Arizona Press|year = 1993|isbn = |location = |pages = ii (Front Matter)|url = http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/books/rockyMoon/01FrontMatter.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name photomosaic and an implementation concept were trademarked by Robert Silvers' Runaway Technology, Inc.&lt;ref name="USTradmarkOffice"/&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Photo-mosaic-Joseph-Francis.jpg|thumb|right|1993 ''Live from Bell Labs'' event poster]]
* '''1993''' Joseph Francis, working for R/Greenberg Associates in Manhattan, is believed to be the inventor of the modern-day computer-generated colour image versions. His ''Live from Bell Labs'' poster created in 1993 used computer-themed tile photographs to create a mosaic of a face ([[Ryszard Horowitz]]/ Photography and Art Direction, Robert Bowen/ Digital Artist). He went on to create a mosaic for ''Animation Magazine'' in 1993, which was repeated in ''Wired Magazine'' (November 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;106).  Francis has said on his "History of Photo Mosaics" webpage that his interest in developing these techniques further was in part stimulated by the work of artist [[Chuck Close]].
* '''1994''' [[Dave McKean]] creates an image for DC Comics, a mosaic of a face made from photos of faces, although this is believed to be created manually using Photoshop.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Jfk mosaic adam finkelstein.jpg|thumb|left|1994 John F. Kennedy mosaic, Adam Finkelstein and Sandy Farrier]] --&gt;
* '''1994''' Adam Finkelstein and Sandy Farrier create a mosaic of [[John F. Kennedy]] from parts of Marilyn Monroe pictures. The result was displayed in the Xerox PARC Algorithmic Art Show in 1994.
* '''1994''' Benetton: AIDS - Faces mosaic. Over one thousand young peoples' portraits from all over the word computer-processed spell out the word AIDS.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Gioconda Sapiens Spain Domus.jpg|thumb|right|1995 Gioconda Sapiens, Domus museum, Spain]] --&gt;
* '''1995''' The '' Gioconda Sapiens'', a face with ten thousand faces, was presented to the public in April 1995 (Spain, Domus museum). This was the first large photographic mosaic, using photographs of 10,062 people from 110 countries to make the ''[[Mona Lisa]]''.
* '''1995''' Adam Finkelstein (published mosaic in Mossy Bits) creates a mosaic of the oil painting ''[[American Gothic]]'' from images collected from the Web in early 1995.
* '''1995''' Robert Silvers creates an algorithm for generating Photomosaics programmatically and goes on to trademark the term Photomosaic and patent his process for creation of Photomosaics in 1997.

==Artistic aspects==
There is debate over whether Photomosaics are an art or mere technique.&lt;ref&gt;Silvers (2000) quote: "More than anything else people ask me whether Photomosaics are an art or a science. l tell them that Photomosaics, like any art in formative stage, has elements of both."&lt;/ref&gt; The making of a photomosaic is sometimes parallelled and compared to forms of [[artistic appropriation]], like [[literary assemblage]].&lt;ref name="Menke08p232"&gt;Menke (2008) p.232 quote: [In Rudyard Kipling's 1902 science-fiction short story "Wireless"] we recognize that the tale's marshalling of realistic particulars has also been a systematic importation of details from Keats's poetry and life history [...] The tale's elaborate descriptions were really Keats's pre-scriptions all along. As in a photomosaic image, the elements of the story that make it seem recognizable and real turn out to be chosen from an artificially constrained palette of appropriations; examined closely, each realistic detail reveals itself as a micro-quotation from that collection.&lt;/ref&gt;

Artists such as [[David Hockney]], Christopher Kates and Pep Ventosa have pioneered their own photographic mosaic techniques where multiple photographs are taken of a scene and then pieced together again to create a cohesive image.

==Trademark and intellectual property of the concept==
Robert Silvers, a Master's student at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], filed for a [[trademark]] on the term ''Photomosaic'' on September 3, 1996. This trademark was registered on August 12, 2003.&lt;ref name="USTradmarkOffice"&gt;{{cite web
  | title = Trademark information for Trademark 75159436
  | publisher = US Trademark Office
  | url = http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&amp;entry=75159436
  | accessdate = 2007-08-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Silvers also applied for a U.S. [[patent]] on the production of Photomosaics on January 2, 1997, which was granted as {{Cite patent|US|6137498}} in October 2000 and has been assigned to Runaway Technology, Inc. Patent applications in other countries were also filed, and patents granted include {{Cite patent|EP|0852363}}, {{Cite patent|JP|10269353}}, {{Cite patent|CA|2226059}}, and {{Cite patent|AU|723815B}}. He is quoted as saying: "By being granted this patent in the United States and other countries, we can protect our proprietary innovations and continue to make unique artwork." &lt;ref name="PhotomosaicCompay"&gt;{{cite web
 |url= http://www.photomosaic.com/corporate_patents.html
 |title= Robert Silvers {{!}} Corporate {{!}} Patents
 |first= Robert |last= Silvers
 |publisher= Runaway Technology, Inc.
 |accessdate= November 12, 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2008, the [[Public Patent Foundation]] filed a formal request with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to review certain claims in the {{Cite patent|US|6137498}} on photomosaics. The request was granted and a reexamination proceeding ensued. On August 31, 2010, the USPTO issued a Reexamination Certificate confirming the patentability of all claims in the patent which were amended to refer to shape matching (a feature that contributes to the high resolution of photomosaics).

There are a number of other commercial companies that create mosaics with photos. Since there has been no litigation of these patents, these companies must therefore either use processes that do not infringe on the particular claimed process, have licenses under the patents, or are infringing those patents but Runaway Technology has chosen not to bring infringement proceedings.

Silvers' patent may be regarded as a [[software patent]], a subject over which there is a great deal of [[software patent debate|debate]]. For example, {{EPC Article|52|2|c}} states that "programs for computers as such" are not regarded as [[patentable subject matter|patentable inventions]]. Nevertheless, current practice relating to [[Software patents under the European Patent Convention|computer-implemented inventions under the EPC]] means that a process that provides a technical effect may be patented even if it is implemented by a computer.

The UK patent deriving from {{Cite patent|EP|0852363}} became the subject of revocation proceedings in July 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Using the [http://www.patent.gov.uk/patent/p-find/p-find-number.htm UK Patents Status Enquiry] for EP0852363 provides full details on the current status of the patent.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2009, the [[United Kingdom Patent Office|UK Intellectual Property Office]] (UK-IPO) decided that the patent should not be revoked and terminated the proceeding. The European patents expired on 31 December 2017.

==Video mosaic==
Photographic mosaics are typically formed from a collection of still images. A more recent phenomenon, however, has been video mosaics which assemble video clips rather than still images to create a larger image. The closing credits of the 2005 [[PlayStation 2]] game ''[[God of War (video game)|God of War]]'', for example, incorporates a still image of the main character, [[Kratos (God of War)|Kratos]], formed from a number of in-game videos.

The term "video mosaic" also describes a large still image made from adjacent frames of video, such as those from video shots of geographic features like roads or cities. A mosaic of the video's relevant frames replaces the full video, saving time and bandwidth, since the stills are much smaller.

'''Cognitive planning''' is one of the [[executive function]]s. It encompasses the [[neurological]] processes involved in the formulation, evaluation and selection of a sequence of thoughts and actions to achieve a desired goal. Various studies utilizing a combination of [[neuropsychological]], neuropharmacological and functional [[neuroimaging]] approaches have suggested there is a positive relationship between impaired planning ability and damage to the [[frontal lobe]].

A specific area within the mid-dorsolateral frontal cortex located in the frontal lobe has been implicated as playing an intrinsic role in both cognitive planning and associated executive traits such as [[working memory]].

Disruption of the [[neural pathway]]s, via various mechanisms such as [[traumatic brain injury]], or the effects of [[neurodegenerative disease]]s between this area of the frontal cortex and the [[basal ganglia]] specifically the [[striatum]] (cortico-striatal pathway), may disrupt the processes required for normal planning function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 9421831 | volume=53 | issue=4 | title=Cognitive planning in humans: neuropsychological, neuroanatomical and neuropharmacological perspectives | date=November 1997 | journal=Prog.

==Neuropsychological tests==
[[File:Tower of Hanoi 4.gif|thumb|right|Animation of a four disc version of the [[Tower of Hanoi]].|alt=A version of the Tower of Hanoi utilizing four discs.]]
There are a variety of neuropsychological tests which can be used to measure variance of planning ability between the subject and controls.

*'''[[Tower of Hanoi]]''' (TOH-R), a puzzle invented in 1883 by the French mathematician Édouard Lucas. There are variations of the puzzle - the classic version consists of three rods and usually seven to nine  discs of subsequently smaller size. Planning is a key component of the problem solving skills necessary to achieve the objective, which is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following rules:
**Only one disk may be moved at a time.
**Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the rods and sliding it onto another rod, on top of the other disks that may already be present on that rod.
**No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Welsh | first1 = MC | last2 = Huizinga | first2 = M | date = June 2001 | title = The development and preliminary validation of the Tower of Hanoi-revised | url = | journal = Assessment | volume = 8 | issue = 2| pages = 167–76 | pmid = 11428696 | doi=10.1177/107319110100800205}}&lt;br&gt;- {{cite journal | last1 = Anderson | first1 = JR | last2 = Albert | first2 = MV | last3 = Fincham | first3 = JM | date = August 2005 | title = Tracing problem solving in real time: fMRI analysis of the subject-paced Tower of Hanoi | url = | journal = J Cogn Neurosci | volume = 17 | issue = 8| pages = 1261–74 | doi = 10.1162/0898929055002427 | pmid = 16197682 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Tower of London test|Tower of London]]''' (TOL) is another test that was developed in 1982 (Shallice 1982) specifically to detect deficits in planning as may occur with damage to the frontal lobe.  test participants with damage to the left anterior frontal lobe demonstrated planning deficits (i.e., greater number of moves required for solution).

In test, participants with damage to the right anterior, and left or right posterior areas of the frontal lobes showed no impairment. The results implicating the left anterior frontal lobes involvement in solving the TOL were supported in concomitant neuroimaging studies which also showed a reduction in regional [[cerebral blood flow]] to the left pre-frontal lobe. For the number of moves, a significant negative correlation was observed for the left prefrontal area, i.e. subjects that took more time planning their moves showed greater activation in the left prefrontal area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

'''Psychological pricing''' (also '''price ending''', '''charm pricing''') is a [[pricing strategies|pricing and marketing strategy]] based on the theory that certain prices have a psychological impact. Retail prices are often expressed as "odd prices": a little less than a round number, e.g. $19.99 or £2.98. There is evidence that consumers tend to perceive "odd prices" as being lower than they actually are, tending to round to the next lowest monetary unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Direct evidence of ending-digit drop-off in price information processing|journal = Psychology and Marketing|date = 2005|pages = 771–783|volume = 22|issue = 10|doi = 10.1002/mar.20084|language = en|first = George Y.|last = Bizer|first2 = Robert M.|last2 = Schindler}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, prices such as $1.99 are associated with spending $1 rather than $2. The theory that drives this is that lower pricing such as this institutes greater demand than if consumers were perfectly rational. Psychological pricing is one cause of [[price point]]s.

==Overview==
According to a 1997 study published in the ''Marketing Bulletin'', approximately 60% of prices in advertising material ended in the digit 9, 30% ended in the digit 5, 7% ended in the digit 0 and the remaining seven digits combined accounted for only slightly over 3% of prices evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://marketing-bulletin.massey.ac.nz/V8/MB_V8_N1_Holdershaw.pdf The Widespread Use Of Odd Pricing In The Retail Sector], ''Marketing Bulletin'', 1997, 8, Research Note 1, J Holdershaw, P Gendall and R Garland. {{ISSN|1176-645X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, before the withdrawal of the [[British halfpenny coin|halfpenny coin]] in 1969, prices often ended in 11{{frac|1|2}}d (elevenpence halfpenny: just under a shilling, which was 12d); another example was £1/19/11¾d. (one pound, nineteen shillings and elevenpence three farthings) which is one [[Farthing (British coin)|farthing]] under £2. This is still seen today in gasoline (petrol) pricing ending in {{frac|9|10}} of the local currency's smallest denomination; for example in the US the price of a gallon of gasoline almost always ends in US$0.009 (e.g. US$1.799).

In a traditional cash transaction, fractional pricing imposes tangible costs on the vendor (printing fractional prices), the cashier (producing awkward change) and the customer (stowing the change). These factors have become less relevant with the increased use of checks, credit and debit cards and other forms of currency-free exchange; also, the addition of sales tax makes the pre-tax price less relevant to the amount of change (although in Europe the sales tax is generally included in the shelf price).

The psychological pricing theory is based on one or more of the following hypotheses:
* The first theory that explains the rationale for odd pricing is prospect theory. This theory says that "consumers facing uncertainty in decision making, base the value of an alternative on gains or losses offered by the alternative, relative to some reference point, rather than on final absolute states of wealth or welfare". This theory is based on the fact that losses mean more than gains. So based on that criterion, one would think that something only a few cents under a whole dollar would actually be beneficial to the price. This theory works so well because of how the "reference price" is established by the consumer. The reference price for something that is $19.98 would be $20. This establishes the odd pricing as a better deal.
* Judgments of numerical differences are anchored on left-most digits, a behavioral phenomenon referred to as the left-digit anchoring effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=Manoj|last2=Morwitz|first2=Vicki|volume=32|issue=1|date=June 2005|title=Penny Wise and Pound Foolish: The Left‐Digit Effect in Price Cognition|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|pages=55–64|doi=10.1086/429600 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis suggests that people perceive the difference between 1.99 and 3.00 to be closer to 2.01 than to 1.01 because their judgments are anchored on the left-most digit.
* Consumers ignore the least significant digits rather than do the proper rounding. Even though the cents are seen and not totally ignored, they may subconsciously be partially ignored. Keith Coulter, Associate Professor of Marketing at the Graduate School of Management, Clark University, suggests that this effect may be enhanced when the cents are printed smaller (for example, $19&lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.clarku.edu/gsom/documents/ConnectWinter2012.pdf|page=5|newspaper=Connect: News from the Graduate School of Management at Clark University|publisher=[[Clark University]]|date=Winter 2012|title=Keith Coulter}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fractional prices suggest to consumers that goods are marked at the lowest possible price.
* When items are listed in a way that is segregated into price bands (such as an online real estate search), price ending is used to keep an item in a lower band, to be seen by more potential purchasers.

The theory of psychological pricing is controversial. Some studies show that buyers, even young children, have a very sophisticated understanding of true cost and [[relative value (economics)|relative value]] and that, to the limits of the accuracy of the test, they behave rationally. Other researchers claim that this ignores the non-rational nature of the phenomenon and that acceptance of the theory requires belief in a subconscious level of thought processes, a belief that economic models tend to deny or ignore. Results from research using modern scanner data are mixed.

Now that many customers are used to odd pricing, some restaurants and high-end retailers psychologically-price in even numbers in an attempt to reinforce their brand image of quality and sophistication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Hospitality Managers’ Price-Ending Beliefs A Survey and Applications|journal = Cornell Hospitality Quarterly|date = 2011|pages = 421–428|volume = 52|issue = 4|doi = 10.1177/1938965511421168|language = en|first = Robert M.|last = Schindler|first2 = H.

==Research==
[[Kaushik Basu]] used [[game theory]] in 1997 to argue that rational consumers value their own time and effort at calculation. Such consumers process the price from left to right and tend to mentally replace the last two digits of the price with an estimate of the mean "cent component" of all goods in the marketplace. In a sufficiently large marketplace, this implies that any individual seller can charge the largest possible "cent component" (99¢) without significantly affecting the average of cent components and without changing customer behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0165-1765(97)00009-8|title=Why are so many goods priced to end in nine? And why this practice hurts the producers|journal=Economics Letters|volume=54|pages=41–44|year=1997|last1=Basu|first1=Kaushik}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruffle and Shtudiner's (2006) laboratory test shows considerable support for Basu's 99-cent pricing equilibrium, particularly when other sellers' prices are observable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ruffle | first1 = B.

The euro introduction in 2002, with its various exchange rates, distorted existing nominal price patterns while at the same time retaining real prices. A European wide study (el Sehity, Hoelzl and Kirchler, 2005) investigated consumer price digits before and after the euro introduction for price adjustments. The research showed a clear trend towards psychological pricing after the transition. Further, [[Benford's Law]] as a benchmark for the investigation of price digits was successfully introduced into the context of pricing. The importance of this benchmark for detecting irregularities in prices was demonstrated and with it a clear trend towards psychological pricing after the nominal shock of the euro introduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = El Sehity | first1 = T. | last2 = Hoelzl | first2 = E. | last3 = Kirchler | first3 = E. | year = 2005 | title = Price developments after a nominal shock: Benford's Law and psychological pricing after the euro introduction | url = | journal = International Journal of Research in Marketing | volume = 22 | issue = 4| pages = 471–480 | doi=10.1016/j.ijresmar.2005.09.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another phenomenon noted by economists is that a [[price point]] for a product (such as $4.99) remains stable for a long period of time, with companies slowly reducing the ''quantity'' of product in the package until consumers begin to notice. At this time, the price will increase marginally (to $5.05) and then within an exceptionally short time will increase to the next price point ($5.99, for example).&lt;ref&gt;[[Choice magazine]], January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Research has also found psychological pricing relevant for the study of politics and public policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ashworth | first1 = J. | last2 = Heyndels | first2 = B. | last3 = Smolders | first3 = C. | year = 2003 | title = Psychological taxing in Flemish municipalities | journal = Journal of Economic Psychology | volume = 24 | issue = 6| pages = 741–762 | doi=10.1016/j.joep.2003.06.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, a study of Danish municipal income taxes found evidence of "odd taxation" as tax rates with a nine-ending were found to be over-represented compared to other end-decimals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Olsen | first1 = A. L. | year = 2013 | title = The politics of digits: evidence of odd taxation | url = | journal = Public Choice | volume = 154 | issue = 1–2| pages = 59–73 | doi = 10.1007/s11127-011-9807-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several studies have shown that when prices are presented to a prospect in descending order (versus ascending order) positive effects result, mainly a willingness to pay a higher price, higher perceptions of value, and higher probability of purchase. The reason for this is that when presented in the former, the higher price serves as a reference point, and the lower prices are perceived favorably as a result.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, P., Brennan, M., Kearns, Z. (2003). Psychological aspects of price: An empirical test of order and range effects. ''Marketing Bulletin'' 2003; (14), Research note 1. pp. 1-2.  [http://marketing-bulletin.massey.ac.nz/V14/MB_V14_N1_Bennett.pdf PDF] {{ISSN|1176-645X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical comments==
Exactly how psychological pricing came into common use is not clear, though it is known the practice arose during the late 19th century. One source speculates it originated in a [[newspaper]] pricing competition. [[Melville E. Stone]] founded the ''[[Chicago Daily News]]'' in 1875, intending to price it at one cent to compete with the [[nickel (U.S. coin)|nickel]] papers of the day. The story claims that [[penny (U.S. coin)|pennies]] were not common currency at the time, and so Stone colluded with advertisers to set whole dollar prices a cent lower—thus guaranteeing that customers would receive ample pennies in change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adams|first1=Cecil|authorlink1=Cecil Adams|title=Why do prices end in .99?|url=http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a3_166.html|website=[[The Straight Dope]]|date=February 21, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have suggested that fractional pricing was first adopted as a control on employee theft. For cash transactions with a round price, there is a chance that a dishonest cashier will pocket the bill rather than record the sale. For cash transactions with an odd price, the cashier must make change for the customer. This generally means opening the [[cash register]] which creates a record of the sale in the register and reduces the risk of the cashier [[stealing]] from the store owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Landsburg |first=Steven E. | authorlink=Steven Landsburg |date=2012 |title=The Armchair Economist: Economics &amp; Everyday Life |edition=Rev. |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Armchair_Economist_revised_and_updat.html?id=pWS5zrF_Fz0C |location=New York |publisher=Free Press |isbn=9781451651737 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the former [[Czechoslovakia]], people called this pricing "baťovská cena" ("Baťa's price"), referring to [[Tomáš Baťa#Ba.C5.A5a.27s leadership for quality and innovation|Tomáš Baťa]], a Czech manufacturer of footwear. He began to widely use this practice in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romanakladatelstvi.cz/clanky/clanek_2.pdf ''Social responsibility of the Bata Company''], in Czech language{{Dead link|date=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Price ending has also been used by retailers to highlight sale or clearance items for administrative purposes. A retailer might end all regular prices in 95 and all sale price in 50. This makes it easy for a buyer to identify which items are discounted when looking at a report.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

In its [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 United Kingdom general election]] manifesto, the [[Official Monster Raving Loony Party]] proposed the introduction of a 99-pence coin to "save on change".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.loonyparty.com/index.php?page=2005-general-election-manifesto|title=The Official Monster Raving Loony Party|website=The Official Monster Raving Loony Party|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sonne|first1=Paul|last2=MacDonald|first2=Alistair|title=In the Longest-Running Joke in Politics, Life Imitates Farce|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703322204575225864160523470|work=Wall Street Journal|date=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent trend in some monetary systems is to eliminate the smallest denomination coin (typically 0.01 of the local currency). The total cost of purchased items is then rounded up or down to, for example, the [[Swedish rounding|nearest 0.05]]. This may have an effect on future "odd-number" pricing to maximize the rounding advantage for vendors by favoring 98 and 99 endings (rounded up) over 96 and 97 ending (rounded down) especially at small retail outlets where single item purchases are more common. [[Australia]] is a good example of this practice where [[Australian 5 cent coin|5 cents]] has been the smallest denomination coin since 1992, but pricing at .98 or .99 on items under several hundred dollars is still almost universally applied (e.g.: $1.99&amp;nbsp;– $299.99) while goods on sale often price at .94 and its variations. It is also the case in [[Finland]] and The Netherlands, the first two countries using the euro currency to eliminate the 1 and 2 cent coins.

In [[universal algebra]] and in [[model theory]], a '''reduct''' of an algebraic structure is obtained by omitting some of the operations and relations of that structure.  The converse of "reduct" is "expansion."

==Definition==
Let ''A'' be an [[algebraic structure]] (in the sense of [[universal algebra]]) or equivalently a [[structure (mathematical logic)|structure]] in the sense of [[model theory]], organized as a set ''X'' together with an indexed [[family]] of [[Operation (mathematics)|operations]] and relations φ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; on that set, with [[index set]] ''I''.  Then the '''reduct''' of ''A'' defined by a subset ''J'' of ''I'' is the structure consisting of the set ''X'' and ''J''-indexed family of operations and relations whose ''j''-th operation or relation for ''j''∈''J'' is the ''j''-th operation or relation of ''A''.  That is, this reduct is the structure ''A'' with the omission of those operations and relations φ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; for which ''i'' is not in ''J''.

A structure ''A'' is an '''expansion''' of ''B'' just when ''B'' is a reduct of ''A''.  That is, reduct and expansion are mutual converses.

==Examples==
The [[monoid]] ('''Z''', +, 0) of [[integer]]s under [[addition]] is a reduct of the [[Group (mathematics)|group]] ('''Z''', +, &amp;minus;, 0) of integers under addition and negation, obtained by omitting negation. By contrast, the monoid ('''N''',+,0) of [[natural numbers]] under addition is not the reduct of any group.

Conversely the group ('''Z''', +, &amp;minus;, 0) is the expansion of the monoid ('''Z''', +, 0), expanding it with the operation of negation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2879">'''Referential density''' is a concept of [[ficto-narrative theory]] put forward by [[Thomas Pavel|Thomas G. Pavel]] in his 1986 book, ''Fictional Worlds''.&lt;ref&gt;Pavel, Thomas G. ''Fictional Worlds''. Cambridge: Harvard UP, 1986. {{ISBN|0-674-29966-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept refers to the referential relationship of a text to a [[Fictional universe|fictional world]], the [[ontology]] of which can be established by a [[possible world]]s approach.&lt;ref&gt;Doležel, Lubomir. ''Heterocosmica: Fiction and Possible Worlds''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP, 1998. {{ISBN|0-8018-5749-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large text that refers to a small fictional world is said to have low referential density, whereas a small text referring to a large fictional world has high referential density. The size of the text is measured in abstract terms as amplitude, which in most cases will correspond to its physical length; exceptions to this may arise in cases of embedded discourses, such as [[metanarratives]] (or imaging digressions), which refer to the actual world. For this reason, the form and [[genre]] of a fictional work provide only an approximate indication of its size; by the same token, it is possible to refer to the size and referential density of part of a fictional work. The size of a fictional world, in turn, is measured in terms of the sum total of properties applicable to the objects and agents inhabiting the fictional world.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Marie-Laure. ''Possible Worlds, Artificial Intelligence, and Narrative Theory''. Bloomington: Indiana UP, 1991. {{ISBN|0-253-35004-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relative density==
Relative (referential) density builds upon the abstract definition of referential density by including context sensitive factors such as the degree of external information the reader has to import to his reconstruction of the fictional world, the text’s narrative crowding, the ratio between action and description, and the [[Epistemology|epistemic]] paths chosen by the text. These factors will usually have more impact on the number of references in a text than its amplitude.

==Significance==
Referential density and relative (referential) density account for much of what makes fictional texts 'thick' or 'easy' reads. All other factors being equal, high density will make for difficult reading in that the reader is required to reconstruct the fictional world in a short space, whereas low density is characteristic of a high degree of action. An author may, however, focus on psychology and thereby have a static [[plot (narrative)|plot]] with low density. On the other hand, certain authors and genres make the reader's reconstruction of the fictional world the very point of the text's enjoyment, which is the case with most works of [[science-fiction]], [[fantasy]], and [[historical fiction]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3912">'''Riko Mizuno''' (born 1932) is a Los Angeles gallerist, art dealer, and artist. Born in Tokyo, Japan, she moved to Los Angeles in the 1950s to study ceramics at [[Chouinard Art Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Riko Mizuno, gallerist|url=http://blogs.getty.edu/pacificstandardtime/explore-the-era/people/riko-mizuno/|website=Pacific Standard Time at the Getty Center|publisher=Getty Research Institute|accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1966 and 1984, Mizuno operated galleries at several locations in Los Angeles.

Los Angeles artist [[Vija Celmins]] characterized Mizuno's contribution to the Los Angeles art world in a 1993 interview with Susan Morgan of the ''Los Angeles Times'': "Riko Mizuno was very important to artists in Los Angeles. She created an incredibly nurturing atmosphere. We would sit around her kitchen, drinking sake, eating her delicious food, and always talking, talking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morgan|first1=Susan|title=The Beauty of a Long Attention Span Speed...|journal=Los Angeles Times|date=December 12, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mizuno Gallery==
In 1966, Mizuno opened Gallery 669 on La Cienega Boulevard. She collaborated briefly at 669 with [[Eugenia Butler, Sr.|Eugenia Butler]]. In 1969 she re-opened the gallery as Mizuno Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mizuno Gallery|url=http://blogs.getty.edu/pacificstandardtime/explore-the-era/locations/mizuno-gallery/|website=Pacific Standard Time at the Getty|publisher=Getty Research Institute|accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mizuno Gallery operated until 1984 at three locations: on La Cienega Boulevard, in Little Tokyo, and on N.

'''School bullying''' is a type of [[bullying]] that occurs in any [[learning space|educational setting]].

For an act to be considered bullying it must meet certain criteria. This includes hostile intent, imbalance of power, repetition, distress, and provocation. Bullying can have a wide spectrum of effects on a student including anger, depression, stress and suicide. Additionally, the bully can develop different social disorders or have a higher chance of engaging in criminal activity.

If there is suspicion that a child is being bullied or is a bully, there are warning signs in their behavior. There are many programs and organizations worldwide which provide bullying prevention services or information on how children can cope if they have been bullied.

== Definition ==
There is no universal definition of school bullying; however, it is widely agreed that bullying is a subcategory of [[aggressive behavior]] characterized by the following three minimum criteria:&lt;ref name="Burger 2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Burger |first=Christoph |last2=Strohmeier |first2=Dagmar |last3=Spröber |first3=Nina |last4=Bauman |first4=Sheri |last5=Rigby |first5=Ken |date=2015 |title=How teachers respond to school bullying: An examination of self-reported intervention strategy use, moderator effects, and concurrent use of multiple strategies |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sheri_Bauman/publication/282641314_How_teachers_respond_to_school_bullying_An_examination_of_self-reported_intervention_strategy_use_moderator_effects_and_concurrent_use_of_multiple_strategies/links/56277c7808aefb81befbab5d.pdf |journal=Teaching and Teacher Education |volume=51 |pages=191–202 |doi=10.1016/j.tate.2015.07.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*hostile intent (i.e., the harm caused by bullying is deliberate, not accidental),&lt;ref name="Goldsmid_and_Howie"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goldsmid |first1=S. |last2=Howie |first2=P. |year=2014 |title=Bullying by definition: An examination of definitional components of bullying |url= |journal=Emotional and Behavioural Difficulties |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=210–225 |doi=10.1080/13632752.2013.844414}} {{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*imbalance of power (i.e., bullying includes a real or perceived power inequity between the bully and the victim),&lt;ref name="Goldsmid_and_Howie"/&gt; and
*repetition over a period of time (i.e., more than once with the potential to occur multiple times).&lt;ref name="Goldsmid_and_Howie"/&gt;

The following two additional criteria have been proposed to complement the above-mentioned criteria:
* victim distress (victim suffers mild to severe psychological, social or physical trauma)&lt;ref name="Goldsmid_and_Howie"/&gt; and
* provocation (bullying is motivated by perceived benefits of their aggressive behaviors).&lt;ref name="Goldsmid_and_Howie"/&gt;

Some of these characteristics have been disputed (e.g., for power imbalance: bullies and victims often report that conflicts occur between two equals); nevertheless, they remain widely established in the scientific literature.&lt;ref name="Burger 2015"/&gt;

== Underlying causes ==
The underlying causes of school violence and bullying include gender and social norms and wider contextual and structural factors.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002469/246970e.pdf |title=School Violence and Bullying: Global Status Report |last=UNESCO |first= |publisher=Paris, UNESCO |year=2017 |isbn=978-92-3-100197-0 |location= |pages=17, 29, 31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discriminatory [[Gender role|gender norms]] that shape the dominance of men and the subservience of women and the perpetuation of these norms through violence are found in some form in many cultures. [[Gender inequality]] and the prevalence of [[violence against women]] in society exacerbate the problem. Similarly, social norms that support the authority of teachers over children may legitimise the use of violence to maintain discipline and control.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

The pressure to conform to dominant gender norms is also high.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Meyer |first=Doug |date= |title=The Disregarding of Heteronormativity: Emphasizing a Happy Queer Adulthood and Localizing Anti-Queer Violence to Adolescent Schools |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13178-016-0272-7 |journal=Sexuality Research &amp; Social Policy |volume=14 |issue=3 |page=331 |via= |doi=10.1007/s13178-016-0272-7 |year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young people who cannot or who choose not to conform to these norms are often punished for this through violence and bullying at school.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Schools themselves can "teach" children to be violent through discriminatory practices, curricula and textbooks. If unchecked, gender discrimination and power imbalances in schools can encourage attitudes and practices that subjugate children, uphold unequal gender norms and tolerate violence, including corporal punishment.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Some attribute part of the cause of bullying to the [[Bullying culture|atmosphere]] in which it occurs. Thornberg and Knutsen state in their study, "School attributing refers to attributing the cause of bullying to the school setting." They say that school attributing has two subcategories which are "boredom in school" and "poor antibullying practices". Boredom in school involves a student who does not have anything else to do other than bully. Poor antibullying practices may include teachers and staff not caring enough to intervene, or a school not having enough teachers for students. This may lead to the students feeling unwanted or unimportant due to the lack of care from the school's staff.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Thornberg, Robert, and Sven Knutsen |title=Teenagers' Explanations of Bullying |journal=Child &amp; Youth Care Forum |volume=40 |issue=3 |page=177 |doi=10.1007/s10566-010-9129-z |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schools and the education system also operate within the context of wider social and structural factors and may reflect and reproduce environments that do not protect children and adolescents from violence and bullying. For example, physical and sexual violence may be more prevalent in schools in contexts where it is also more prevalent in wider society. Studies suggest that sexual violence and harassment of girls is worse in schools where other forms of violence are prevalent, and in conflict and emergency contexts,&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002321/232107E.pdf School-related gender-based violence is preventing the achievement of quality education for all]. UNESCO Policy Paper 17 (March 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; and that [[Gang|gang violence]] is more common in schools where gangs, weapons and drugs are part of the local culture.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In their paper "Predicting Bullying: Exploring the Contributions of Childhood Negative Life Experiences in Predicting Adolescent Bullying Behavior," Connell, Morris and Piquero identify three primary aspects of a child's life- family, school and peers- as major indicators to whether or not that child exhibits behavior akin to bullying.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Connell |first=Nadine M. |last2=Morris |first2=Robert G. |last3=Piquero |first3=Alex R. |date=July 2016 |title=Predicting Bullying: Exploring the Contributions of Childhood Negative Life Experiences in Predicting Adolescent Bullying Behavior |journal=International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology |volume=60 |issue=9 |pages=1082–1096 |doi=10.1177/0306624X15573760 |issn=1552-6933 |pmid=25759430}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prevention ==
Bullying can threaten students' physical and emotional safety at school and can negatively impact their ability to learn. The best way to address bullying is to stop it before it starts. There are many different groups that can intervene to address bullying (and cyberbullying) in schools: parents, teachers, and school leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Morgan |first=H |title=Malicious Use of Technology: What Schools, Parents, and Teachers Can Do to Prevent Cyberbullying |url=https://doi.org/10.1080/00094056.2013.792636 |journal=Childhood Education |volume=89 |pages=146–151 |via=Taylor &amp; Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most commonly used strategies by teachers to prevent it are to communicate, mediate and seek help.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Giménez-Gualdo |first=Ana-M. |last2=Arnaiz-Sánchez |first2=Pilar |last3=Cerezo-Ramírez |first3=Fuensanta |last4=Prodócimo |first4=Elaine |date=2018-07-01 |title=Teachers' and students' perception about cyberbullying.

There are no federal mandates for bullying curricula or staff training. In addition to addressing bullying before it occurs, a great prevention strategy is to educate the students on bullying.&lt;ref name="US Govt"/&gt;

Examples of activities to teach about bullying include:

* Internet or library research, such as looking up types of bullying, how to prevent it, and how kids should respond
* Presentations, such as a speech or role-play on stopping bullying
* Discussions about topics like reporting bullying
* Creative writing, such as a poem speaking out against bullying or a story or skit teaching bystanders how to help
* Artistic works, such as a collage about respect or the effects of bullying
* Classroom meetings to talk about peer relations&lt;ref name="US Govt"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.stopbullying.gov/prevention/at-school/index.html |title=Prevention at School |date=2012-02-29 |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|access-date=2018-04-26}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects ==
A victim, in the short term, may feel [[Depression (mood)|depressed]], anxious, angry, have [[Stress (psychological)|excessive stress]], [[learned helplessness]], feel as though their life has fallen apart, have a significant drop in school performance, or may commit [[suicide]] ([[bullycide]]). In the long term, they may feel [[Emotional security|insecure]], lack [[trust (social sciences)|trust]], exhibit extreme sensitivity ([[hypervigilance|hypervigilant]]), or develop a mental illness such as [[psychopathy]], [[avoidant personality disorder]] or [[PTSD]].  They may also desire [[Revenge|vengeance]], sometimes leading them to torment others in return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Dombeck, Mark |title=The Long Term Effects of Bullying |url=https://www.mentalhelp.net/articles/the-long-term-effects-of-bullying/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anxiety, depression and psychosomatic symptoms are common among both bullies and their victims. Among these participants alcohol and substance abuse are commonly seen later in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=KALTIALA HEINO |first=RIITTAKERTTU |last2=RIMPELÄ |first2=MATTI |last3=RANTANEN |first3=PÄIVI |last4=RIMPELÄ |first4=ARJA |date=1 December 2000 |title=Bullying at school—an indicator of adolescents at risk for mental disorders |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140197100903518 |journal=Journal of Adolescence |volume=23 |issue=6 |pages=661–674 |doi=10.1006/jado.2000.0351}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is known that people suffering from depression feel much better when they talk to others about it, but victims of bullying fear may not talk to others about their feelings in fear of being bullied, which can worsen their depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Olweus |first1=D |title=Bullying at school |date=1993 |publisher=Malden, MA |accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the short term, being a bystander "can produce feelings of anger, fear, guilt, and sadness.... Bystanders who witness repeated victimizations of peers can experience negative effects similar to the victimized children themselves."&lt;ref name="Hirsch, L. 2012" /&gt;

While most bullies, in the long term, grow up to be emotionally functional adults, many have an increased risk of developing [[antisocial personality disorder]], which is linked to an increased risk of committing criminal acts (including [[domestic violence]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Long-Term Effects Of Bullying: Pain Lasts Into Adulthood (STUDY) |work=Huffington Post |accessdate=15 April 2014 |date=20 February 2013 |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/20/long-term-effects-of-bullying_n_2728190.html |author=Pappas, Stephanie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Negative impact on educational quality and outcomes ===
The educational effects on victims of school violence and bullying are significant. Violence and bullying at the hands of teachers or other students may make children and adolescents afraid to go to school and interfere with their ability to concentrate in class or participate in school activities. It can also have similar effects on bystanders.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

The consequences include missing classes, avoiding school activities, playing truant or dropping out of school altogether. This in turn has an adverse impact on academic achievement and attainment and on future education and employment prospects. Children and adolescents who are victims of violence may achieve lower grades and may be less likely to anticipate going on to higher education. Analyses of international learning assessments highlight the impact of bullying on learning outcomes. These analyses clearly show that bullying reduces students' achievement in key subjects, such as mathematics, and other studies have documented the negative impact of school violence and bullying on educational performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=24298004 |year=2014 |author1=Devries |first1=K. M |title=School violence, mental health, and educational performance in Uganda |journal=Pediatrics |volume=133 |issue=1 |pages=e129–37 |last2=Child |first2=J. C |last3=Allen |first3=E |last4=Walakira |first4=E |last5=Parkes |first5=J |last6=Naker |first6=D |doi=10.1542/peds.2013-2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Bystanders and the school climate as a whole are also affected by school violence and bullying. Unsafe learning environments create a climate of fear and insecurity and a perception that teachers do not have control or do not care about the students, and this reduces the quality of education for all.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Social and economic costs ===
The 2006 UN World Report on Violence against Children shows that victims of corporal punishment, both at school and at home, may develop into adults who are passive and over-cautious or aggressive. Involvement in school bullying can be a predictor of future antisocial and criminal behaviour. Being bullied is also linked to a heightened risk of eating disorders and social and relationship difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF (2014). [https://www.unicef.org/publications/index_74865.html Hidden in plain sight: A statistical analysis of violence against children]. {{ISBN|978-92-806-4767-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Other studies have shown the longer-term effects of bullying at school. One study of all children born in England, Scotland and Wales during one week in 1958 analyzes data on 7,771 children who had been bullied at ages 7 and 11. At age 50, those who had been bullied as children were less likely to have obtained school qualifications and less likely to live with a spouse or partner or to have adequate social support. They also had lower scores on word memory tests designed to measure cognitive IQ even when their childhood intelligence levels were taken into account and, more often reported, that they had poor health. The effects of bullying were visible nearly four decades later, with health, social and economic consequences lasting well into adulthood. For children, "peers are a much more important influence than has been realised. It is a terrible thing to be excluded by your peers".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Rebecca (18 April 2014). [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/children/10772302/Bullying-at-school-affects-health-40-years-later.html Bullying at school affects health 40 years later]. Telegraph. Retrieved on 2017-10-28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

The economic impact of violence against children and adolescents is substantial.&lt;ref&gt;WHO (2016). Inspire. Seven strategies for ending violence against children.&lt;/ref&gt; Youth violence in Brazil alone is estimated to cost nearly US$19 billion every year, of which US$943 million can be linked to violence in schools. The estimated cost to the economy in the USA of violence associated with schools is US$7.9 billion a year.&lt;ref&gt;Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against Children (2012). Tackling violence in schools: A global perspective bridging the gap between standards and practice.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Analytic work supported by the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) shows that school-related gender-based violence alone can be associated with the loss of one primary grade of schooling, which translates to an annual cost of around US$17 billion to low- and middle-income countries.&lt;ref&gt;RTI International. (2015). [http://www.ungei.org/resources/6089.htm What is the cost of school-related gender-based violence?] USAID.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In the East Asia and Pacific region, it is estimated that the economic costs of just some of the health consequences of child maltreatment were equivalent to between 1.4% and 2.5% of the region's annual GDP.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In Argentina, the forgone benefit to society from overall early school dropout is 11.4% of GDP, and in Egypt, nearly 7% of potential earnings is lost as a result of the number of children dropping out of school.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

A study has shown that each year Cameroon, Democratic Republic of Congo and Nigeria lose US$974 million, US$301 million and US$1,662 million respectively for failing to educate girls to the same standard as boys, and violence in school is one of the key factors contributing to the under-representation of girls in education.&lt;ref&gt;Plan (2008).

=== Bullies ===
Proactive aggression is a behavior that expects a reward.  With bullying each individual has a role to defend.{{clarify|date=October 2016}} Some children act proactively but will show aggression to defend themselves if provoked.  These children will react aggressively but tend to never be the ones to attack first.

There have been two subtypes created in bully classification; popular aggressive and unpopular aggressive. Popular aggressive bullies are social and do not encounter a great deal of social stigma from their aggression. Unpopular aggressive bullies, however, are most often rejected by other students and use aggression to seek attention.&lt;ref name="Sign In"/&gt;
* In a recent national survey 3,708,284 students reported being a perpetrator of bullying in the U.S. school system.&lt;ref name="Sign In"/&gt;
* Studies have shown bullies actually report more success in making friends than other children.
* Bullying behavior in perpatrators is shown to decrease with age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dake |first=Joseph A. |last2=Price |first2=James H. |last3=Telljohann |first3=Susan K. |date=1 May 2003 |title=The Nature and Extent of Bullying at School |journal=Journal of School Health |volume=73 |issue=5 |pages=173–180 |doi=10.1111/j.1746-1561.2003.tb03599.x |pmid=12793102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a survey by the [[Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development]] (NICHD), students were asked to complete a questionnaire.

&lt;blockquote&gt;A total of 10.6% of the children replied that they had sometimes bullied other children, a response category defined as moderate bullying. An additional 8.8% said they had bullied others once a week or more, defined as frequent bullying. Similarly, 8.5% said they had been targets of moderate bullying, and 8.4% said they were bullied frequently. Out of all the students, 13% said they had engaged in moderate or frequent bullying of others, while 10.6% said they had been bullied either moderately or frequently. Some students — 6.3% — had both bullied others and been bullied themselves. In all, 29% of the students who responded to the survey had been involved in some aspect of bullying, either as a bully, as the target of bullying or both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=NIH |title=Bullying Widespread in U.S. Schools, Survey Finds |work=NICHD Archive |date=26 June 2006 |url=https://www.nichd.nih.gov/news/releases/pages/bullying.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Tara Kuther, an associate professor of psychology at [[Western Connecticut State University]], "...bullying gets so much more sophisticated and subtle in high school. It's more [[relational aggression|relational]]. It becomes more difficult for teens to know when to intervene; whereas with younger kids, bullying is more physical and, therefore, more clear-cut."&lt;ref name="greatschools.org" /&gt;

== Types of bullying ==
There are four basic types of bullying: verbal, physical, psychological, and cyber. Cyberbullying is becoming one of the most common types. While victims can experience bullying at any age, it is witnessed most often in school-aged children.

Direct bullying is a relatively open attack on a victim that is physical and/or verbal in nature.&lt;ref name="Hirsch, L. 2012"&gt;{{cite book |publisher=Weinstein Books |isbn=978-1-60286-184-8 |oclc=792879631 |last1=Hirsch |first1=Lee |last2=Lowen |first2=Cynthia |last3=Santorelli |first3=Dina |title=Bully: An action plan for teachers and parents to combat the bullying crisis |location=New York |date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indirect bullying is more subtle and harder to detect, but involves one or more forms of relational aggression, including [[Isolation to facilitate abuse|social isolation]] via intentional exclusion, spreading rumors to defame one's character or reputation, making faces or obscene gestures behind someone's back, and manipulating friendships or other relationships.&lt;ref name="Hirsch, L. 2012" /&gt;

Pack bullying is bullying undertaken by a group. The 2009 Wesley Report on bullying found that pack bullying was more prominent in high schools and lasted longer than bullying undertaken by individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Facts About School Bullies and Bullying Behaviors |work=Bullying Statistics |url=http://www.bullyingstatistics.org/content/school-bullying.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physical bullying is any unwanted physical contact between the bully and the victim. This is one of the most easily identifiable forms of bullying. Examples include:&lt;ref name="stopbullyingnow.hrsa.gov"&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220222902/http://stopbullyingnow.hrsa.gov/index.asp?area=whatbullyingis | archive-date=20 February 2009 |url=http://stopbullyingnow.hrsa.gov/index.asp?area=whatbullyingis |title=So what is bullying? |work=Stop Bullying Now!}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bolton"&gt;{{cite book |publisher=Boys Town Press |isbn=978-1-889322-67-4 |author1=Bolton, José |author2=Graeve, Stan |title=No room for bullies: from the classroom to cyberspace |location=Nebraska |date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emotional ===
{{See also|Psychological abuse}}
Emotional bullying is any form of bullying that causes damage to a victim's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] and/or [[emotional well-being]]. Examples include:&lt;ref name="stopbullyingnow.hrsa.gov" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bolton" /&gt;

* Spreading malicious [[rumor]]s about people
* Getting certain people to "gang up" on others (this could also be considered physical bullying)
* Ignoring people on purpose (via the [[silent treatment]] or pretending the victim is non-existent)
* Provoking others
* Belittling, making fun of people, or saying hurtful things (which are also forms of verbal bullying)&lt;ref name=belittling&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccpa-accp.ca/blog/?p=3021 |title=The Effects of Belittling |publisher=Counselling Connect |accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Verbal ===
{{See also|Verbal abuse}}
Verbal bullying is any slanderous statements or accusations that cause the victim undue emotional distress. Examples include:&lt;ref name="Bolton" /&gt;

* Directing foul language ([[profanity]]) at the target
* Using [[derogatory]] terms or deriding the person's name
* Commenting negatively on someone's looks, clothes, body, etc. ([[personal abuse]])
* [[Suffering|Tormenting]]
* [[harassment|Harassing]]
* Mocking and belittling&lt;ref name="belittling" /&gt;

*Inappropriate sexual comments&lt;ref name="stopbullying.gov"/&gt;

=== Cyberbullying ===
Cyberbullying is the quickest growing form of harassment of school campuses in the U.S. and 40% of adolescent report being a victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hvidston |first=David |date= |title=Cyberbullying: Implications for Principal Leadership |url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0192636513504452 |journal=NASSP Bulletin |volume=97 |pages=297–313 |via=Sage Journals}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most definitions of cyberbullying come from definitions of school bullying. Thus, this conduct is often described as an intentional aggressive behavior that takes place via new technologies, during which groups or individuals hurt classmates who cannot easily defend themselves. Cyberbullying events can occur via cellphones or computers, by means of text messages, e-mails, online social networks, chatrooms or blogs.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"&gt;{{Cite journal |date=2015-02-01 |title=Does cyberbullying overlap with school bullying when taking modality of involvement into account? |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S074756321400572X |journal=Computers in Human Behavior  |volume=43 |pages=49–57 |doi=10.1016/j.chb.2014.10.049 |issn=0747-5632}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of bullying can easily go undetected because of the lack of parental or authoritative supervision. Because bullies can pose as someone else, it is the most anonymous form of bullying. Like the bullying that occurs in school, the following four profiles have been identified: cyberneutral, cyberbully, cybervictim and cyberbully-victim.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt; Many who are bullied in school are likely to be bullied over the Internet and vice versa.&lt;ref name="Bolton" /&gt;  Since students have become more reliant on internet, the advancement in social media and technology has altered the fear of in-person bullying away from schoolyards but has rather increase cyberbullying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kowalski, R.

Cyberbullying can happen 24 hours a day and seven days a week and reach a child even when they are alone.
Deleting inappropriate or harassing messages, texts or pictures is extremely difficult after being posted or sent.&lt;ref&gt;stopbullying.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Prevention ====
According to the website Stop Cyberbullying, "When schools try and get involved by disciplining the student for cyberbullying actions that took place off campus and outside of school hours, they are often sued for exceeding their authority and violating the student's free speech right." &lt;ref name="Stop Cyberbullying"&gt;{{cite web |title=What is cyberbullying, exactly? |url=http://stopcyberbullying.org/what_is_cyberbullying_exactly.html |publisher=Stop cyberbullying |accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They suggest for schools to make revisions to their policies that would allow for disciplinary actions to take place even if off campus or after hours. They say if the act is likely to affect a student mentally or physically while in school then the revision of the policy would allow for the staff to intervene without violating the student's constitutional rights. Many principals are hesitant to act because school discipline codes and states laws do not define cyberbullying. According to professor Bernard James, "educators are empowered to maintain safe schools, the timidity of educators in this context of emerging technology is working in advantage of the bullies."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/28/style/28bully.html |title=How Should Schools Handle Cyberbullying? |last=Hoffman |first=Jan |date=2010-06-27 |work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-20 |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyberbullying has become extremely prevalent; 95% of teens who use [[social media]] reported having witnessed malicious behavior on social media from 2009 to 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Boschert |first=Sherry |title=Cyberbullying triples suicide risk in teens |work=Pediatric News |url=http://www.pediatricnews.com/specialty-focus/mental-health/single-article-page/cyberbullying-triples-suicide-risk-in-teens.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; As sites like [[Facebook]] or [[Twitter]] offer no routine monitoring, children from a young age must learn proper internet behavior, say Abraham Foxman and Cyndi Silverman. "This is a call for parents and educators to teach these modern skills... through awareness and advocacy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Social Networking Sites Can Be Forums for Cyberbullying |work=Opposing Viewpoints in Context |url=http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/ovic/ViewpointsDetailsPage/DocumentToolsPortletWindow?displayGroupName=Viewpoints&amp;jsid=338bbf8461b0eccf737c3bc28daee63f&amp;action=2&amp;catId=&amp;documentId=GALE%7CEJ3010744205&amp;u=plan_smcol&amp;zid=9df104e26321ef3abe1a4c867b490850}}&lt;/ref&gt; Per Scott Eidler, "Parents and educators need to make children aware at a young age of the life-changing effects cyberbullying can have on the victim. The next step for prevention is advocacy. For example, three high school students from [[Melville, New York]] organized a Bullying Awareness Walk, where several hundred people turned out to show their support."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Eidler |first=Scott |title=Anti-bullying walk held in North Hempstead |work=Newsday |accessdate=21 September 2013 |date=6 March 2013 |url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/anti-bullying-walk-held-in-north-hempstead-1.5022005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clara Wajngurt writes, "Other than organizing events, calling for social media sites to take charge could make the difference between life and death. Cyberbullying is making it increasingly difficult to enforce any form of prevention."&lt;ref name="wajngurt"&gt;{{cite web |last=Wajngurt |first=Clara |title=Anti-Bullying Policies in Higher Ed |url=http://www.niot.org/node/7125 |publisher=Not in Our Town |accessdate=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joanna Wojcik concludes, "The rapid growth of social media is aiding the spread of cyberbullying, and prevention policies are struggling to keep up. In order for prevention policies to be put in place, the definition of cyberbullying must be stated, others must be educated on how to recognize and prevent bullying, and policies that have already attempted to be enacted need to be reviewed and learned from."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wojcik |first=Joanne |title=Cyber bullying cases test schools' legal reach |work=Business Insurance |date=4 March 2012 |url=http://www.businessinsurance.com/article/20120304/NEWS05/303049991}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Researcher Charisse Nixon found that students do not reach out for help with cyberbullying for four main reasons: they do not feel connected to the adults around them; the students do not see the cyberbullying as an issue that is worth bringing forward; they do not feel the surrounding adults have the ability to properly deal with the cyberbullying; and the teenagers have increased feelings of shame and humiliation regarding the cyberbullying.&lt;ref name="Adolescent Health 2014"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2147/AHMT.S36456 |volume=5 |pages=143–158 |last=Nixon |first=Charisse L |title=Current perspectives: the impact of cyberbullying on adolescent health |journal=Adolescent Health, Medicine and Therapeutics |date=1 July 2014 |pmid=25177157 |pmc=4126576}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nixon also found that when bystanders took action in helping end the cyberbullying in adolescents, the results were more positive than when the adolescents attempted to resolve the situation without outside help.&lt;ref name="Adolescent Health 2014"/&gt;

=== Sexual bullying ===
{{Main|Sexual bullying}}
Sexual bullying is "any bullying behavior, whether physical or non-physical, that is based on a person's sexuality or gender. It is when sexuality or gender is used as a weapon by boys or girls towards other boys or girls—although it is more commonly directed at girls. It can be carried out to a person's face, behind their back or [[Cyber-bullying|through the use of technology]]."&lt;ref name="NSPCC02"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nspcc.org.uk/Inform/resourcesforteachers/classroomresources/sexual_bullying_definition_wdf68769.pdf |title=NSPCC working definition of Sexual Bullying |publisher=[[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children|NSPCC]] |accessdate=22 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613025646/http://www.nspcc.org.uk/Inform/resourcesforteachers/classroomresources/sexual_bullying_definition_wdf68769.pdf | archive-date=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of its research into sexual bullying in schools, the [[BBC]] TV series ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' commissioned a questionnaire aimed at people aged 11 to 19 in schools and youth clubs across five regions of [[England]].&lt;ref name="BBC01"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/panorama/hi/front_page/newsid_7811000/7811468.stm |title=Rising problem of sexual bullying in schools |publisher=BBC [[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]] |date=5 January 2009 |accessdate=22 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The survey revealed that of the 273 respondents, 28 had been forced to do something sexual, and 31 had seen it happen to someone else. Of the 273 respondents, 40 had experienced unwanted touching.&lt;ref name="NSPCC01"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nspcc.org.uk/Inform/research/questions/sexual_bullying_wda70106.html |title=What is sexual bullying, and how can I manage it within educational settings? |publisher=NSPCC |accessdate=22 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.K. government figures show that in the 2007–2008 school year, there were 3,450 fixed-period exclusions and 120 expulsions from schools in England due to sexual misconduct.&lt;ref name="DCSF01"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/rsgateway/DB/SFR/s000860/index.shtml |title=Permanent and Fixed Period Exclusions from Schools in England 2007/08 |publisher=UK Government's [[Department for Children, Schools and Families]] |date=30 July 2009 |accessdate=22 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included incidents such as [[groping]] and using sexually insulting language. From April 2008 to March 2009, [[ChildLine]] counselled a total of 156,729 children, 26,134 of whom spoke about bullying as a main concern and 300 of whom spoke specifically about sexual bullying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nspcc.org.uk/Inform/policyandpublicaffairs/policysummaries/sexual_bullying_in_education_settings_wdf68771.pdf |title=NSPCC policy summary |publisher=NSPCC |accessdate=22 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613025631/http://www.nspcc.org.uk/Inform/policyandpublicaffairs/policysummaries/sexual_bullying_in_education_settings_wdf68771.pdf | archive-date=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.K. charity [[Beatbullying]] has claimed that as [[gang culture]] enters, children are being bullied into providing sexual favours in exchange for protection.&lt;ref name="BBC02"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/6500005.stm |title=Girls bullied for 'sex favours' |publisher=BBC |date=27 March 2007 |accessdate=22 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other anti-bullying groups and teachers' unions, including the [[National Union of Teachers]], challenged the charity to provide evidence of this.&lt;ref name="BBC02" /&gt;

Sexting cases are also on the rise and have become a major source of bullying. The circulation of explicit photos of those involved either around school or the internet put the originators in a position to be scorned and bullied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eyepat.org/sexting |title=Sexting |publisher=EyePAT |date= |accessdate=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been reports of some cases in which the bullying has been so extensive that the victim has taken their life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hastings |first=Katy |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1161112/Teenager-commits-suicide-sexting-nude-photo-boyfriend-life-misery.html |title=Teenager commits suicide after 'sexting' a nude photo to her boyfriend made her life a misery |work=Daily Mail |date=10 March 2009 |accessdate=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Higher education bullying ===
According to HealthDay News, 15 percent of college students claim to have been victims of bullying while at college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=King |first1=Michelle |title=The Truth About Bullying in College |url=http://www.hercampus.com/health/mental-health/truth-about-bullying-college |website=HerCampus.com |accessdate=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the article, "Bullying not a thing of the past for college students," Kaitlyn Krasselt writes, "Bullying comes in all forms but is usually thought of as a K-12 issue that ceases to exist once students head off to college."&lt;ref name=usatoday&gt;{{cite web |last1=Krasselt |first1=Kaitlyn |title=Bullying not a thing of the past for college students |url=http://college.usatoday.com/2014/10/21/bullying-not-a-thing-of-the-past-for-college-students/ |website=usatoday.com |date=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The misconception that bullying does not occur in higher education began to receive attention after the death of college student [[Suicide of Tyler Clementi|Tyler Clementi]]. According to an experiment conducted by Dr. Gary R. Walz,  "21.47% of participants reported rarely being victims of cyberbullying; 93.29% reported rarely cyberbullying others.

== Locations ==
Bullying locations vary by context. Most bullying in elementary school happens in the playground. In middle school and high school, it occurs most in the hallways, which have little supervision. According to the [[US Department of Education|U.S Department of Education]]'s [[National Center for Education Statistics]], more than 47% of kids reported getting bullied in hallways and stairway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.jrn.msu.edu/bullying/2012/02/16/bullying-locations/ |title=Hallways, stairwells are bullying hot spots |work=The New Bullying | access-date = 26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bus stops and bus rides to and from school tend to be hostile environments as well; children tend to view the driver as someone with no disciplinary authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.keepyourchildsafe.org/bullying/where-bullying-occurs.html |title=The places where bullying occurs; where bullying takes place |website=Child Safety and Abuse Prevention Programs| access-date = 26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bullying may also follows people into adult life and university.

== Warning signs ==
Victims of bullying typically are physically smaller, more sensitive, unhappy, cautious, anxious, quiet, and withdrawn. They are often described as [[passivity (behavior)|passive]] or submissive.

== Roles ==
[[File:Wikibully.jpg|thumb|Cartoon representation of a bully and a victim used to depict [[Western Europe]]an powers and the United States "bullying" [[Serbia]] in the aftermath of the [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence]] during the [[2008 Serbian protests]]]]
McNamee and Mercurio state that there is a  "bullying triangle", consisting of the person doing the bullying, the person getting bullied, and the bystander.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00094056.2008.10523045 |volume=84 |issue=6 |pages=370–378 |last1=McNamee |first1=Abigail |last2=Mercurio |first2=Mia |title=School-Wide Intervention in the Childhood Bullying Triangle |journal=Childhood Education |date=1 August 2008}} {{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[US Department of Health and Human Services]] divides the people involved in bullying into several roles:&lt;ref name="United States 2013"&gt;{{cite web |last=US Department of Health and Human Services |title=The Roles Kids Play |work=What is Bullying |accessdate=25 September 2013 |date=16 October 2012 |url=http://www.stopbullying.gov/what-is-bullying/roles-kids-play/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Bully''': student with social and/or physical power who repeatedly picks on another student or group of students with the intent to inflict harm or discomfort
* '''Victim''': the target of the bullying
* '''Bystander''': student who observes bullying; they may ignore it, encourage it, or defend the victim
* '''Student who assists''': does not start the bullying, but helps and is encouraged by surrounding peers to do so. They may feel that their social status will be damaged if they are not involved.
* '''Student who reinforces''': play a minor role in bullying, such as laughing at the bully's insults
* '''Outsider''': not involved in the bullying but witnesses it
* '''Defendant''': defends the victim or consoles them afterwards

In her book, ''[[The Bully, the Bullied, and the Bystander]]'', Barbara Coloroso divides bullies into several types:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=Collins Living [HarperResource] |isbn=978-0-06-174460-0 |last=Coloroso |first=Barbara |title=The Bully, the Bullied, and the Bystander: From Preschool To High School – How Parents and Teachers Can Help Break the Cycle of Violence |location=New York |year=2004 |pages=11–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The '''confident bully''' has a very high opinion of themselves and feels a sense of superiority over other students.
*The '''social bully''' uses rumors, gossip, and verbal taunts to insult others. Social bullies are typically female and possess low self-esteem, and therefore try to bring others down.
*The '''fully armored bully''' shows very little emotion and often bullies when no one will see or stop them.
*The '''hyperactive bully''' typically has problems with academics and social skills. This student will often bully someone, then place the blame on someone else.
*A '''bullied bully''' is usually someone who has been bullied in the past or is bullied by an older sibling.
* A '''"bunch of bullies"''' (more often referred to as a "'''gang of bullies"''') is a group of friends who gang up on others for fun or due to their desire for power.

== Complex cultural dynamics ==
Parsons identifies school [[bullying culture]]s as typically having a web of [[Group dynamics|dynamics]] which are much more complex than just considering bullying amongst students. These dynamics include:&lt;ref name="Parsons"&gt;{{cite book |first=Les |last=Parsons |title=Bullied Teacher – Bullied Student: How to Recognize the Bullying Culture in Your School And What to Do About It |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k_wXp4pUJeQC |year=2005 |publisher=Pembroke Publishers Limited |isbn=978-1-55138-190-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Some students bully''' other students; some of these student bullies are themselves bullied by other student bullies; some of these student bullies bully teachers.
* '''Some teachers bully''' students; some teacher bullies bully other teachers; some teacher bullies bully parents.
* '''Some office staff bully''' teachers, students and parents.
* '''Some [[Head teacher|principals]] bully''' teachers, office staff, students and parents.
* '''Some parents bully''' teachers, office staff, principals, and even their own children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dake |first=J. A. |author2=Price, J. H. |author3=Telljohann, S.

== Prevention ==
Studies have shown that bullying programs set up in schools with the help and engagements of staff and faculty have been shown to reduce peer victimization and bullying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=O'Brennan |first1=L.

Measures such as increasing awareness,{{Contradict-inline|date=September 2016}} instituting [[Zero tolerance (schools)|zero tolerance]] for fighting, or placing troubled students in the same group or classroom are actually ineffective in reducing bullying; methods that ''are'' effective include increasing empathy for victims; adopting a program that includes teachers, students, and parents; and having students lead anti-bullying efforts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Invitation to the Life Span |last=Berger |first=Kathleen Stassen |publisher=Worth Publishers |year=2014 |isbn=1464172056 |location=New York |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{pages needed|date=September 2016}} Success is most associated with beginning interventions at an early age, constantly evaluating programs for effectiveness, and having some students simply take online classes to avoid bullies at school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.detweedeverdieping.nu/images/pdf/Update%20on%20bullying%20at%20school.pdf |title=Update on bullying at school: Science forgotten? |last=Berger |first=Kathleen Stassen |date=2007 |journal=Developmental Review |doi=10.1016/j.dr.2006.08.002 |pmid= |volume=27 |pages=90–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== United Kingdom ====
Section 89 of the [[Education and Inspections Act 2006]] provides for an anti-bullying policy for all state schools to be made available to parents.

==== United States ====
The victims of some school shootings have sued both the shooters' families and the schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Brownstein |first=Andrew |title=The bully pulpit: post-Columbine harassment victims take schools to court |work=Trial |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+bully+pulpit:+post-Columbine+harassment+victims+take+schools+to...-a097175612 |date=December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one point only 23 states had Anti-Bullying laws. In 2015 Montana became the last state to have an anti-bullying law and at that point all 50 states had an anti-bullying law. These laws are not going to abolish bullying but it does bring attention to the behavior and it lets the aggressors know it will not be tolerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/deborah-temkin/all-50-states-now-have-a_b_7153114.html |title=All 50 States Now have a Bullying Law.

==== Canada ====
In 2016, a legal precedent was set by a mother and her son, after the son was bullied at his public school. The mother and son won a court case against the [[Ottawa-Carleton District School Board]], making this the first case in North America where a [[school board]] has been found negligent in a bullying case for failing to meet the standard of care (the "[[duty of care]]" that the school board owes to its students). A similar bullying case was won in Australia in 2013 (''Oyston v. St. Patricks College'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Murray |first=Melissa |title=Family wins precedent-setting case against public school board |work=Ottawa Community News |date=19 June 2016 |url=http://www.ottawacommunitynews.com/news-story/6773614-family-wins-precedent-setting-case-against-public-school-board/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Taiwan ===
The [[Ministry of Education (Taiwan)|Ministry of Education]] launched a serial of project. In 2006, they started the 'anti-bully plan'. In 2008, they launched the 'prevent bully video from public project', and also building  multiple informants route, monitoring the school, in hope that it could improve the education quality.&lt;ref&gt;The education analysis and anti policy. 陳利銘、鄭英耀、黃正鵠(2010)。反霸凌政策之分析與改進建議。教育政策論壇，13(3)，1–25。&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7466"> [[Image:Sun symbol.svg|right|thumb|The central dot is the Ego whereas the Self is both the whole and the centered dot]]
The '''Self in Jungian psychology''' is one of the [[Jungian archetypes]], signifying the unification of consciousness and unconsciousness in a person, and representing the psyche as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Josepf L. Henderson, "Ancient Myths and Modern Man" in C. G. Jung ed., ''Man and his Symbols'' (London 1978) p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; The Self, according to [[Carl Jung]], is realized as the product of [[individuation]], which in his view is the process of integrating one's personality. For Jung, the Self is symbolized by the [[circled dot|circle]] (especially when divided in four quadrants), the [[square (geometry)|square]], or the [[mandala]].

==Twin centers==

What distinguishes Jungian psychology is the idea that there are two centers of the personality. The [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] is the center of consciousness, whereas the Self is the center of the total personality, which includes consciousness, the unconscious, and the ego.  The Self is both the whole and the center. While the ego is a self-contained little center of the circle contained within the whole, the Self can be understood as the greater circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Zweig | first = Connie | title = Meeting the Shadow | publisher = J.P. Tarcher | location = Los Angeles | year = 1991 | isbn = 0-87477-618-X }} p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emergence from the Self==

Jung considered that from birth every individual has an original sense of wholeness - of the Self - but that with development a separate ego-consciousness crystallizes out of the original feeling of unity.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, "Myths" p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;  This process of ego-differentiation provides the task of the first half of one's life-course, though Jungians also saw psychic health as depending on a periodic return to the sense of Self, something facilitated by the use of myths, initiation ceremonies, and [[rites of passage]].
&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, "Myths" p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return to the Self: individuation==

Once ego-differentiation had been successfully achieved and the individual is securely anchored in the external world, Jung considered that a new task then arose for the second half of life - a return to, and conscious rediscovery of, the Self: individuation. [[Marie-Louise von Franz]] states that "The actual processes of individuation - the conscious coming-to-term with one's own inner center (psychic nucleus) or Self - generally begins with a wounding of the personality".&lt;ref&gt;M-L von Franz, "The Process of Individuation" in Jung ed., ''Symbols'' p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; The ego reaches an impasse of one sort or another; and has to turn for help to what she termed "a sort of hidden regulating or directing tendency...[an] organizing center" in the personality: "Jung called this center the 'Self' and described it as the totality of the whole psyche, in order to distinguish it from the 'ego', which constitutes only a small part of the psyche".&lt;ref&gt;von Franz, "Process" p. 161-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Self's guidance, a succession of archetypal images emerges,&lt;ref&gt;Jolandi Jacobi, ''The Psychology of C. G. Jung'' (London 1968) p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; gradually bringing their fragmentary aspects of the Self increasingly closer to its totality.  The first to appear, and the closest to the ego, would be the [[Shadow (psychology)|shadow]] or personal unconscious - something which is at the same time the first representative of the total personality,&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Hannah, ''Striving towards Wholeness'' (Boston 1988) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; and which may indeed be at times conflated with the Self.&lt;ref&gt;von Franz "Process" p. 182-3&lt;/ref&gt; Next to appear would be the [[Anima and Animus]], the soul-image, which again, by a kind of psychological short-cut, may be taken as identical to the whole Self.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''[[Alchemical Studies]]'' (London 1978) p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; Ideally however, the animus or anima comes to play a mediatory role between the ego and the Self.&lt;ref&gt;von Franz "Process" p. 193 and p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; The third main archetype to emerge is the [[Mana]] figure of the wise old man/woman&lt;ref&gt;J. Jacobi, ''The Psychology of C. G. Jung'' (London 1946) p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; - a representative of the collective unconscious still closer to the Self.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious'' (London 1996) p. 183 and p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

Thereafter comes the archetype of the Self itself - the last point on the route to self-realization of individuation.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobi (1946) p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; In Jung's words, "the Self...embraces ego-consciousness, shadow, anima, and collective unconscious in indeterminable extension. As a totality, the self is a ''coincidentia oppositorum''; it is therefore bright and dark and yet neither".&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''Mysterium Coniunctionis'' (London 1963) p. 108n&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, he stated that "the Self is the total, timeless man...who stands for the mutual integration of conscious and unconscious".&lt;ref&gt;C. G .Jung, "Psychology of the Transference", ''Collected Works'' Vol. 16 (London 1954) p. 311&lt;/ref&gt; Jung recognized many dream images as representing the self, including a stone, the [[world tree]], an elephant, and the Christ.&lt;ref&gt;On this last, see "Christ, a Symbol of the Self" in ''Collected Works'' Vol. 9ii, p. 36ff. He explicitly says, "''Christ exemplifies the archetype of the self.''" [italics his]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perils of the Self==

Von Franz considered that "the dark side of the Self is the most dangerous thing of all, precisely because the Self is the greatest power in the psyche. It can cause people to 'spin' [[megalomania|megalomanic]] or other delusionary fantasies that catch them up", so that the victim "thinks with mounting excitement that he has grasped the great cosmic riddles; he therefore loses all touch with human reality. &lt;ref&gt;von Franz, ''Process'', p.234.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In everyday life, the Self may be projected onto such powerful figures as the state, God, the universe or fate.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Stevens, ''On Jung'' (London 1990) p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; When such projections are withdrawn, there can be a destructive inflation of the personality - one potential counterbalance to this being however the social or collective aspects of the Self.&lt;ref&gt;von Franz, ''Process'', p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of the Jungian concept of Self==

[[Fritz Perls]] may have had the Jungians in mind when he objected that 'many psychologists like to write the self with a capital S, as if the self would be something precious, something extraordinarily valuable. They go at the discovery of the self like a treasure-digging. The self means nothing but this thing as it is defined by ''otherness'''.&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Perls, ''Gestalt Therapy Verbatim'' (Bantam) p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Young-Eisendrath and Hall write that 'in Jung's work, self can refer to the notion of inherent subjective individuality, the idea of an abstract center or central ordering principle, and the account of a process developing over time'.&lt;ref&gt;Polly Young-Eisendrath/James Albert Hall, ''Jung's Self-Psychology'' (1991) p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15293">In [[abstract algebra]], a '''[[semigroup]] with three elements''' is an object consisting of three elements and an [[associative operation]] defined on them. The basic example would be the three integers 0, 1, and −1, together with the operation of multiplication. Multiplication of integers is associative, and the product of any two of these three integers is again one of these three integers.

There are 18 inequivalent ways to define an associative operation on three elements: while there are, altogether, a total of 3&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; = 19683 different binary operations that can be defined, only 113 of these are associative, and many of these are [[isomorphic]] or [[antiisomorphic]] so that there are essentially only 18 possibilities. &lt;ref name=distler&gt;Andreas Distler, [http://bcc2009.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Theses/andreasDthesis.pdf Classification and enumeration of finite semigroups] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402121217/http://bcc2009.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Theses/andreasDthesis.pdf |date=2015-04-02 }}, PhD thesis, [[University of St. Andrews]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Friðrik Diego|author2=Kristín Halla Jónsdóttir |title=Associative Operations on a Three-Element Set|journal=The Montana Mathematics Enthusiast|date=July 2008|volume=5|issue=2 &amp; 3|pages=257–268|url=http://www.math.umt.edu/tmme/vol5no2and3/TMME_vol5nos2and3_a8_pp.257_268.pdf|accessdate=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of these is ''C''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[cyclic group]] with three elements. The others all have a [[semigroup with two elements]] as [[subsemigroup]]s. In the example above, the set {−1,0,1} under multiplication contains both {0,1} and {−1,1} as subsemigroups (the latter is a sub''group'', [[cyclic group|''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]). 

Six of these are [[band (mathematics)|bands]], meaning that all three elements are [[idempotent]], so that the product of any element with itself is itself again. Two of these bands are [[commutative]], therefore [[semilattices]] (one of them is the three-element totally ordered set, and the other is a three-element semilattice that is not a lattice). The other four come in anti-isomorphic pairs. 

One of these non-commutative bands results from adjoining an [[identity element]] to ''LO''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[left zero semigroup]] with two elements (or, dually, to ''RO''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[right zero semigroup]]). It is sometimes called the '''flip-flop monoid''', referring to [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop circuits]] used in electronics: the three elements can be described as "set", "reset", and "do nothing". This semigroup occurs in the [[Krohn–Rhodes theory|Krohn–Rhodes decomposition]] of finite semigroups.&lt;ref&gt;"This innocuous three-element semigroup plays an important role in what follows..." – [https://books.google.ca/books?id=0ukzw5VszNwC Applications of Automata Theory and Algebra] by [[John Rhodes (mathematician)|John L. Rhodes]].&lt;/ref&gt; The irreducible elements in this decomposition are the [[finite simple groups]] plus this three-element semigroup, and its subsemigroups.

There are two [[cyclic semigroup]]s, one described by the equation ''x''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, which has ''O''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[null semigroup]] with two elements, as a subsemigroup. The other is described by ''x''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and has ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the group with two elements, as a subgroup. (The equation ''x''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x'' describes ''C''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, the group with three elements, already mentioned.)

There are seven other non-cyclic non-band commutative semigroups, including the initial example of {−1, 0, 1}, and ''O''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, the null semigroup with three elements. There are also two other anti-isomorphic pairs of non-commutative non-band semigroups.

'''Steven Francis Moore''' (born September 22, 1978) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] former professional [[ice hockey]] [[Center (ice hockey)|center]] who played in parts of three [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) seasons with the [[Colorado Avalanche]].

Moore is widely known for suffering a career-ending injury as a result of [[Todd Bertuzzi–Steve Moore incident|an on-ice attack from behind]] by then-[[Vancouver Canucks]] forward [[Todd Bertuzzi]] in 2004. The fall-out from the event has contributed to a growing effort to curb gratuitous violence in hockey, and professional sports in general.

==Playing career ==
Steve Moore was drafted by the [[Colorado Avalanche]] in the [[1998 NHL Entry Draft]] in the second round, the 53rd pick overall. Moore played in 69 games for the Avalanche from 2001 to 2004, scoring five goals and seven assists, all of which were scored in the latter season, before being seriously injured by [[Todd Bertuzzi]] who at the time played for the [[Vancouver Canucks]] (see below). At the time of the incident, the Avalanche were first overall in the NHL standings, and Moore was playing on the Avalanche's top line, on Right Wing, with linemates [[Joe Sakic]] (Center), and [[Paul Kariya]] (Left Wing).

=== The Bertuzzi incident ===
{{main|Todd Bertuzzi–Steve Moore incident}}
On February 16, 2004, during a Vancouver-Colorado game, Moore injured Canucks team captain [[Markus Näslund]] with a high hit while Näslund was reaching for a puck through centre ice. Moore contacted Näslund's head in the play. No penalty was called in connection with the hit, but Näslund suffered a concussion and a bone chip in his elbow as a result, and missed three games. After reviewing tapes of the hit, the NHL ruled that the hit was legal and did not fine or suspend Moore. Canucks head coach [[Marc Crawford]] and general manager [[Brian Burke (ice hockey)|Brian Burke]] publicly criticized the non-call by the referees on the incident. 

During the next game between the Canucks and Avalanche held in Denver, NHL commissioner [[Gary Bettman]] and NHL executive vice-president [[Colin Campbell (ice hockey executive)|Colin Campbell]] attended the game, which ended in a tie and saw no major incidents break out.

However, on March 8, 2004, during another rematch between the Avalanche and Canucks, things went differently. In the first period, Moore fought Vancouver player [[Matt Cooke]] in a fairly even brawl, and served the 5-minute penalty for fighting. The Avalanche would go on to build up a large lead of 8-2 in a fight-filled game. Late in the third period, [[Todd Bertuzzi]] was sent onto the ice. After failing to instigate Moore to fight, Bertuzzi skated after Moore, pulled him back by the jersey and punched him in the back of the head. As Moore fell unconscious to the ice, Bertuzzi's weight and momentum drove Moore's head into the ice.  Moore's teammate [[Andrei Nikolishin]] and Bertuzzi's teammate [[Sean Pronger]] then piled on to Moore and Bertuzzi.  Moore was knocked out and lay motionless for ten minutes before being carried off on a [[stretcher]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/recap?gameId=240308022 ESPN Game Summary. 28th March 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of the hit, fall, and piling-on had resulted in three fractured [[Cervical vertebrae|neck vertebrae]], facial cuts and a [[concussion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070309/steve_moore_070309/20070309?hub%3DCanada |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070318025304/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070309/steve_moore_070309/20070309?hub=Canada |archivedate=2007-03-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bertuzzi was assessed a match penalty for his actions, which carries an automatic indefinite suspension under NHL rules.  On March 11, 2004, the NHL announced Bertuzzi would remain suspended for at least the remainder of the Canucks' season, including any playoff games.  The [[International Ice Hockey Federation|IIHF]] subsequently honoured the NHL suspension, preventing Bertuzzi playing in any international tournaments or leagues during the [[2004–05 NHL lockout]].

On August 22, 2004, Moore was released from a Denver-area hospital. He wore a neck [[brace (orthopaedic)|brace]] for one year and then started [[physical therapy]] for his neck injury and concussion.

On February 17, 2005, Moore filed a civil lawsuit against Bertuzzi. Also named were [[Brad May]] (who was quoted as saying that there would  "definitely be a bounty on Moore's head" after the game), Brian Burke and the Canucks organization. The lawsuit was thrown out in October 2005, with the judge suggesting that the lawsuit be re-filed in Canada, where the incident took place. The lawsuit was re-filed in Canada, in February 2006.&lt;ref name="MooreLawsuit"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=142413&amp;hubname=nhl |title=Moore plans to file appeal in civil case |accessdate=2007-11-21 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929173940/http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=142413&amp;hubname=nhl |archivedate=2007-09-29 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
On August 8, 2005, NHL Commissioner [[Gary Bettman]] announced that Bertuzzi would be allowed to play again at the start of the [[2005–06 NHL season]].&lt;ref name="Reinstatement"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nhl.com/news/2005/08/232342.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719003929/http://www.nhl.com/news/2005/08/232342.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-07-19 |title=NHL reinstates Vancouver's Todd Bertuzzi |accessdate=2007-02-27 |publisher=NHL.com |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the league's decision, they cited many reasons for ending the suspension, such as: 
*Bertuzzi serving a suspension of 20 games, which at the time tied for 4th longest in NHL history (13 regular season games, 7 playoff games)&lt;ref name="SuspensionLength"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://proicehockey.about.com/cs/history/a/nhl_suspensions.htm|title=The Longest NHL Suspensions|accessdate=2007-11-21|author=Fitzpatrick, Jamie}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Bertuzzi's forfeited salary ($501,926.39 [[United States dollar|USD]])
*Significant uncertainty, anxiety, stress and emotional pain caused to Bertuzzi's family
*The commissioner's belief that Bertuzzi was genuinely remorseful and apologetic for his actions

On August 12, 2005, Brian Burke, formerly Vancouver's general manager who was now serving in the same capacity with the Anaheim Mighty Ducks, had made an offer to Moore. It was a [[two-way contract]] that would have paid Moore $475,000 US in the NHL and $75,000 if the player suited up for Portland, the Ducks' [[American Hockey League]] affiliate. Moore's lawyer Tim Danson described the offer as a self-serving attempt by Burke (who was a defendant in the lawsuit) to mitigate potential legal damages, by attempting to suggest Moore was a minor league player. Further, Danson said that Moore would return to the Avalanche except that Moore was not medically cleared to play hockey, which Brian Burke was well aware of, and described it as adding insult to injury.

On August 15, 2005, Bertuzzi broke his 17-month-long silence by expressing a desire to move on with his life. "I'm sure just like Steve Moore and his family, it's been difficult for both parties. I know I wish that day never happened. It's been some tough times, but I've got good family and good friends and good peers in the league that have helped me get over the hump and move forward and come through it."&lt;ref name="Never happened"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=2134946|title=Bertuzzi: 'I wish that day never happened'|accessdate=2007-02-27|publisher=ESPN.com|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 8, 2005, Moore's Toronto-based lawyer, Tim Danson, said that Moore was skating and doing regular workouts, but continued to suffer concussion-related symptoms.&lt;ref name="MooreLawsuit"/&gt;  He continued working out for some years afterward, but had to abandon his comeback attempt when it became apparent he would never be medically cleared to return to the ice again.

In July, 2012, former Avalanche [[Enforcer (ice hockey)|enforcer]] [[Scott Parker (ice hockey)|Scott Parker]], who had been a teammate of Moore's very briefly the season prior to the Bertuzzi incident in 2004, made some controversial comments. In an interview with milehighhockey.com, Parker was quoted as saying "he (Moore) went to Harvard, you know what, blow me. College grad. I never went to college, but I can kick your ass. I'll bring you right down to my IQ level if you want. I'll hit you about four times in the skull, that'll bring you right down." &lt;ref&gt;An Afternoon With Former Avalanche Enforcer Scott Parker: Part 2 http://www.milehighhockey.com/2012/7/18/3151979/an-afternoon-with-former-avalanche-enforcer-scott-parker-part-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parker defends Bertuzzi attack http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Hockey/NHL/2012/07/18/20001901.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====Civil lawsuit====

On February 16, 2006, Moore filed a civil suit in the province of [[Ontario]] against Bertuzzi, the Canucks, and the parent company of the Canucks, ''Orca Bay Sports and Entertainment'' for the loss of his NHL career, in his Rookie Year. The lawsuit was seeking $15 million in pecuniary damages for loss of income, $1 million for aggravated damages, and $2 million for punitive damages. Moore's lawyer filed the suit one day before its two-year limitation expired, saying it was because Steve Moore did not want to file the suit and waited until the last minute while he tried to attain medical clearance to resume his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/story/2006/02/15/bertuzzi060215.html | publisher = [[CBC News]] | date = 2006-02-15 | title = Bertuzzi hit with lawsuit | accessdate = 2009-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bettman attempted to get Bertuzzi and Moore to agree on an out-of-court settlement in the {{currency|19.5 million|CAD}} lawsuit filed by Moore.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportsline.com/nhl/story/9873254 Pittsburgh Penguins, Sidney Crosby, National Hockey League - CBSSports.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207061223/http://www.sportsline.com/nhl/story/9873254 |date=2008-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bertuzzi offered $350,000 to settle the case, an amount which was called "an insult" by Moore's lawyer.&lt;ref name="Insult"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/Sports/article/273827|title=Bertuzzi offered Moore $350,000|accessdate=2007-11-21|author=Westhead, Rick | work=The Star | location=Toronto | date=November 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 28, 2008, Bertuzzi filed a lawsuit against Crawford, alleging that he was contractually obliged to obey Crawford and that therefore Crawford shares responsibility for the injury to Moore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crawford brought into Moore lawsuit|url=http://www.globesports.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080328.wsptbert28/GSStory/GlobeSportsHockey/home|accessdate=2008-08-19|date=2008-03-28|publisher=Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response, Crawford later stated that Bertuzzi acted in "direct disobedience" to orders from the bench to get off the ice before attacking Moore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bertuzzi acted in 'direct disobedience': Crawford|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/story/2008/08/19/nhl-bertuzzi-crawford.html|publisher=CBC Sports|accessdate=2008-08-19|date=2008-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On January 14, 2013, The Toronto Star reported that both Moore v. Bertuzzi, et al. and Bertuzzi v. Crawford would begin, after having been postponed several times, in April 2013. Both cases will be held in the Ontario Superior Court before a six-person jury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/hockey/nhl/article/1314614--bertuzzi-moore-court-documents-shed-light-on-ex-nhl-player-s-struggles|title=

On January 4, 2012, Bertuzzi dropped his third-party lawsuit against Crawford. In the month of October 2013, it was announced that the court date for Moore v. Bertuzzi, et al. will begin on September 8, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.nationalpost.com/2014/03/07/steve-moore-todd-bertuzzi-case-reaches-its-10-year-anniversary-without-final-resolution/ |title=Steve Moore-Todd Bertuzzi case reaches its 10-year anniversary without final resolution |work=The National Post |author=Sean Fitz-Gerald |date=March 9, 2014 |accessdate=May 7, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140507064348/http://sports.nationalpost.com/2014/03/07/steve-moore-todd-bertuzzi-case-reaches-its-10-year-anniversary-without-final-resolution/ |archivedate=May 7, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 2, 2014, Moore's lawsuit was amended, seeking $68 million in damages, up from $38 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/steve-moore-makes-1st-appearance-at-civil-trial-vs-todd-bertuzzi-1.2694464 | title=Steve Moore makes 1st appearance at civil trial vs. Todd Bertuzzi | publisher=''[[CBC.ca]]'' | author=Michael Drapack | date=July 2, 2014 | accessdate=July 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 19, 2014, it was announced that an out-of-court settlement had been reached in Steve Moore's lawsuit.

==Personal ==
Steve Moore's older brother [[Mark Moore (ice hockey)|Mark]], and younger brother, [[Dominic Moore|Dominic]], all played four years at [[Harvard University]]. Because of their relative closeness in age, all three were able to play in the same year for Harvard during the 1999–2000 season. Dominic also went on to play in the NHL.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8181">A '''terroristic threat''' is a threat to commit a [[crime of violence]] or a threat to cause bodily injury to another person and terrorization as the result of the proscribed conduct.&lt;ref&gt;Sonja Larsen, 86 [[Corpus Juris Secundum|C.J.S.]] ''Threats'' § 24 (database last updated Dec. 2015) (footnotes omitted).&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[U.S. state]]s have enacted [[state law|statutes]] which impose [[criminal liability]] for "terroristic threatening" or "making a terroristic threat."&lt;ref name="ALR"&gt;45 [[American Law Reports|A.L.R.]] 4th 949 (originally published in 1986, subsequently updated).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Generally, a terroristic threat "is sufficiently specific where it threatens death or great bodily injury, and a threat is not insufficient simply because it does not communicate a time or precise manner of execution. Thus, a criminal statute prohibiting terroristic threatening serves to criminalize future, as well as present, death threats."&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, 86 C.J.S. ''Threats'' § 24 (database last updated Dec. 2015) (footnotes omitted).&lt;/ref&gt;

The courts have held that "a threat need not take any particular form or be expressed in any particular words, and may be made by innuendo or suggestion, and that the words uttered will not be considered in a vacuum but rather in light of all the circumstances."&lt;ref&gt;45 A.L.R. 4th 949, § 6.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of courts have upheld convictions under a state criminal terroristic threat statute on the basis of a single or solitary threat,&lt;ref&gt;45 A.L.R. 4th 949, § 7.&lt;/ref&gt; a conditional threat,&lt;ref&gt;45 A.L.R. 4th 949, § 8.&lt;/ref&gt; or a threat that some third person will take action.&lt;ref&gt;45 A.L.R. 4th 949, § 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In several states, courts have held that a "threatener's present inability to carry out his or her threats does not in itself remove the threats from the purview of terroristic threat or terroristic threatening statutes."&lt;ref&gt;45 A.L.R. 4th 949, § 12.&lt;/ref&gt; However, "the courts recognized that one does not violate a terroristic threat or terroristic threatening statute by making idle talk or jests which do not have a reasonable tendency to create apprehension that the speaker will act according to the threat."&lt;ref&gt;45 A.L.R. 4th 949, § 10.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The threat need not be communicated in person, but may be made by any means; courts have in a number of cases held that a terroristic threat statute may be violated by a threat may by telephone,&lt;ref&gt;45 A.L.R. 949, § 22.&lt;/ref&gt; by letter&lt;ref&gt;45 A.L.R. 949, § 23.&lt;/ref&gt; by communication with a third party,&lt;ref&gt;45 A.L.R. 949, § 24.&lt;/ref&gt; or by "a nonverbal, symbolic threat which in other respects satisfies the criminal elements specified in the terroristic threat statute" (such as the [[Cross-burning|burning of a cross]] on the target's driveway).&lt;ref&gt;45 A.L.R. 949, § 25[a].&lt;/ref&gt;

The required ''[[mens rea]]'' element of the offense is generally "that the accused have made the threat with the [[Intention (criminal law)|intent]] or purpose of causing fear in the victim or in [[reckless disregard]] of the risk of causing such fear."&lt;ref&gt;45 A.L.R. 949, § 29.&lt;/ref&gt; At least one court has specified that the "proof of a terroristic threat is measured by an objective standard."&lt;ref&gt;31A [[American Jurisprudence|Am. Jur.]] 2d ''Extortion, Blackmail, etc.'' § 53 (citing ''State v. Dispoto'', 189 N.J. 108, 913 A.2d 791 (2007)).&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[American Law Reports]]'' indicates that "the cases are in disagreement over the availability of [[Intoxication defense|voluntary intoxication]] as a defense in a terroristic threat or terroristic threatening prosecution, with intoxication being a defense where a [[Specific intent|specific criminal intent]] is an essential element of the offense, but not a defense where the offense is established without specific criminal intent."&lt;ref&gt;45 A.L.R. 4th 949, § 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Terroristic-threat statutes have generally been upheld by the courts against constitutional challenges raising claims that such laws violate the [[Free Speech Clause]],&lt;ref&gt;45 A.L.R. 4th 949, § 3.&lt;/ref&gt; are [[Void for vagueness|impermissibly vague]],&lt;ref&gt;45 A.L.R. 4th 949, § 4.&lt;/ref&gt; or overlap with a criminal [[assault]] statute.&lt;ref&gt;45 A.L.R. 4th 949, § 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jur.]] 2d ''Extortion, Blackmail, etc.'' § 53 (citing [[Model Penal Code]] § 211.3).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16922">[[File:Houghton MS Am 1506 (4) - Cranch.jpg|thumb|"Transparent eyeball" as illustrated by [[Christopher Pearse Cranch]], ca. 1836-1838]]
The '''transparent eyeball''' is a philosophical metaphor originated by [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]. The transparent eyeball is a representation of an eye that is absorbent rather than reflective, and therefore takes in all that [[nature]] has to offer.  Emerson intends that the individual become one with nature, and the transparent eyeball is a tool to do that. In the book ''[[Nature (essay)|Nature]]'', Emerson explains that the meaning behind the transparent eyeball is similar to a scientific standpoint on the [[Bible]].

==Overview==
The idea of the transparent eyeball first appeared in [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]'s essay, ''[[Nature (essay)|Nature]]'', published in 1836.&lt;ref name="EmersonNature7"/&gt; In this essay, Emerson describes [[nature]] as the closest experience there is to experiencing the presence of [[God]]. To truly appreciate nature, one must not only look at it and admire it, but also be able to feel it taking over the senses.  This process requires absolute "solitude, a man needs to retire as much from his chamber as from society"&lt;ref name = "EmersonNature7"&gt;{{cite web | date = Feb 2011 | format = [[Portable document format|PDF]] | url= http://seniorseminarsp2011.qwriting.org/files/2011/02/Emerson-Nature-and-Circles.pdf |title= Emerson, nature &amp; circles | work = Ralph Waldo Emerson Essays and Lectures|publisher = Q Writing | origyear = The Library of America 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; to uninhabited places like the woods where—
{{quote| We return to reason and faith. There I feel that nothing can befall me in life, — no disgrace, no calamity, (leaving me my eyes,) which nature cannot repair. Standing on the bare ground, — my head bathed by the blithe air, and uplifted into infinite spaces, — all mean egotism vanishes. I become a transparent eye-ball; I am nothing; I see all; the currents of the Universal Being circulate through me; I am part or parcel of God.&lt;ref name="EmersonNature7" /&gt;}}

However, only a "few adult persons can see nature."&lt;ref name="EmersonNature7"/&gt;  For most people seeing is superficial.  It is light illuminating the [[eye]] revealing what is physically evident as opposed to sun "shine[s] into the eye and heart of the child."&lt;ref name = "EmersonNature7"/&gt; "Emerson argues that outer and inner vision merge to reveal symbols in the natural landscape. Because of the radical correspondence between visible things and human thoughts, natural facts serve as symbols of spiritual facts, so the natural world is perpetual allegory of the human spirit—an allegory to which the eye gives access."&lt;ref name="DeeperUnity9"&gt;{{cite web |page=25 |year=2004 |url = http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/emily_dickinson_journal/v013/13.2kohler.pdf | format = PDF | title= Dickinson's Embodied Eyeball: Transcendentalism and the Scope of Vision| last = Kohler | first = Michelle |publisher= The Johns Hopkins University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Hello: in the midst of wild Nature, the self becomes one with being and god; differentiation, alienation and struggle cease."&lt;ref name = "DeathEmerson2"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Death of Emerson: Writing, Loss, and Divine Presence |author=Atchley, J. Heath |work=The Journal of Speculative Philosophy, New Series |year=2006 |pages=251–265| volume=20 |number=4 |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/journal_of_speculative_philosophy/v020/20.4atchley.html |accessdate=13 April 2011| publisher= Penn State University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"For Emerson, every object rightly seen unlocks a new faculty of the soul and, while he ardently valorizes the physical eye’s potential to see in a way that discovers symbolic meaning, his most memorable metaphorical image for such potential, the transparent eyeball, posits a vision wherein the eye sloughs off its body and ‘egotism,’ merging with what it sees. It is within this transparent, disembodied state of total union with nature that Emerson claims ‘I am nothing; I see all’. The ‘all’ that Emerson seeks access is not simply harmony with nature or even knowledge, but perception of a deep unity between the human spirit and the natural world."&lt;ref name="DeeperUnity9"/&gt;

==Origin==
Emerson attended [[Harvard Divinity School]] in 1825—and by 1826, had applied for a license to preach at the Middlesex Association of Ministers.  By 1832, Emerson left the Christian ministry but continued to believe in God. However, he held that God reveals his grandeur not only in scripture, but also through nature. “Emerson's reading in science soon after leaving the ministry was his effort to interpret God's natural book. As Emerson became increasingly interested in science, he eventually came to believe nature, not scripture, was the locus of [[revelation]]. His desire to become a naturalist was intimately connected to his yearning to write a new bible of [[God]]'s revelation in nature.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = "Terrible Simplicity": Emerson's Metaleptic Style | journal = Style | type = academic journal article | last = Wilson | first = Eric | volume = 31 | number = 1 | date = Spring 1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars{{who|date=February 2013}} believe that the “transparent eyeball” passage is an echo of the [[Bible]]. ‘In Nature, Emerson fashions himself as a new prophet of nature, believing with [[Goethe]] that "prophetic vision" arises only in "slowpaced experiment." Vision arises from observing nature, where, as he writes in Nature, "All things are moral; and in their boundless changes have an unceasing reference to spiritual nature." The essay can be regarded as Emerson's attempt to make nature itself a bible. In this sense, one need not spend Sundays at church but could simply retreat to the ‘woods’ and let nature inhabit his or her consciousness.  “The reconstruction of religion in Emerson’s nature works in a number of directions. First, there is an undeniable romantic-[[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] in his writings. One can and should go out into nature, into the fields and forests and be renewed. It follows, then, that Emerson’s religiosity may be read as natural and not supernatural, which may account for his centrality in a tradition of arts and letters which dates to his decisive split with organized religion.” The significance of this shift resulted in Emerson’s paradigmatic role for [[transcendentalism]].  “Transcendentalists believe that finding God depended on neither orthodox ([[Christianity]]) nor the Unitarians' sensible exercise of virtue, but on one's inner striving toward spiritual communion with the divine spirit.”{{Sfn | Wilson | 1997}}

==Application==

===In photography===
[[Walker Evans]] is a renowned American photographer, known for his visionary process of aligning “photography with Emerson's original desire to absorb and be absorbed into nature, to become a transparent rather than simply reflective eye.” Walker spent his career during the [[Great Depression]] trying to capture images that would be a mirror representation of Americans surrounded by both nature and man-made objects existing in total harmony.

Emerson's description of the “transparent eyeball” functions as a metaphor for the artist's ability to discern the essential nature of objects and as a way to stress that the transcendental is not formless.  The "transparent eyeball" reflects nature's particulars, much in the way that a [[camera]] lens exposes; and in the process illuminates… the "unrelieved, bare-faced, revelatory" facts. The transparent eyeball is about capturing and being a part of all of nature and its motion. The camera works in the same fashion. The camera exposes/illuminates all of nature in a single snapshot with more detail and visibility of nature that cannot be taken in by an unaided eye alone.
{{Quote | Just as nature has to be experienced visually for its true meaning to shine forth, the photographic eye has to be present to capture the image. Contrary to what one might think, the ‘transparent eyeball’ is not a free-floating entity, but a necessary link between the observer and the landscape surrounding him or her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = ‘The Transparent Eyeball’: On Emerson and Walker Evans | last = Blinder | first = Caroline | journal = Mosaic | place = Winnipeg | volume = 37 | number = 4 | date = December 2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

To visually experience and appreciate nature, as Emerson desired, through a transparent state, an individual has to view it. This is similar to the camera. To photograph an image, the individual must first view the scene, then capture what they see.  Thus, the “transparent eyeball” is not free from constraints, but is a tool that the individual needs to become one with nature. However, it is not to be understood that “Emerson did not believe in a fundamental god-driven unity underlying the worldly flux, but rather that art's role was to provide an insight into that unity.”{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

===In literature===
According to Amy Hungerford, the influence and use of the transparent eyeball in [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning author [[Marilynne Robinson]]’s novel [[Housekeeping (novel)|Housekeeping]] is palpable.  Hungerford argues that Robinson’s protagonist Ruth narrates from the perspective of the transparent eyeball.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://academicearth.org/speakers/amy-hungerford | contribution = Amy Hungerford | publisher = Academic earth | title = Speakers}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critiques==
[[Annie Dillard]], a prominent critic of [[transcendentalism]], suggests a rather different kind of observer—one conscious of their own embodiment, of a "particularity" in space and time, of [[subjectivity]], of the [[constructiveness]], the "falseness" of vision.  Dillard’s vision is different from Emerson’s because she is conscious of her presence, so she can pay attention to the “falseness” of vision. In this sense, it is safer not to attain nor aim for the transparent eyeball ideal, because vision is limited, and one should “not stalk the truth” of the places where it could be seen.{{Citation needed |date=March 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28202">A '''wicked problem''' is a problem that is difficult or impossible to solve because of incomplete, contradictory, and changing requirements that are often difficult to recognize.  The use of the term "wicked" here has come to denote resistance to resolution, rather than evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apsc.gov.au/publications-and-media/archive/publications-archive/tackling-wicked-problems|title=Tackling Wicked Problems: A Public Policy Perspective|publisher=Australian Public Service Commission|date=25 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another definition is "a problem whose social complexity means that it has no determinable stopping point".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/|title=Design for Transitions - from and to what?|last=Tonkinwise|first=Cameron|date=4 April 2015|website=Academia.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, because of complex [[interdependencies]], the effort to solve one aspect of a wicked problem may reveal or create other problems.

The phrase was originally used in [[social planning]]. Its modern sense was introduced in 1967 by [[C. West Churchman]] in a guest editorial Churchman wrote in the journal ''[[Management Science (journal)|Management Science]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Management Science |last= Churchman |first= C. West |title= Wicked Problems |volume= 14 |issue= 4 |date= December 1967 |doi= 10.1287/mnsc.14.4.B141}}&lt;/ref&gt; responding to a previous use of the term by [[Horst Rittel]]. Churchman discussed the moral responsibility of [[operations research]] "to inform the manager in what respect our 'solutions' have failed to tame his wicked problems".  Rittel and [[Melvin M. Webber]] formally described the concept of wicked problems in a 1973 [[treatise]], contrasting "wicked" problems with relatively "tame", soluble problems in [[mathematics]], [[chess]], or [[puzzle]] solving.&lt;ref name="Rittel and Webber 1973" /&gt;

== Characteristics ==
Rittel and Webber's 1973 formulation of wicked problems in [[social policy]] planning specified ten characteristics:&lt;ref name="Rittel and Webber 1973"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rittel |first=Horst W. J. |first2=Melvin M. |last2=Webber |title=Dilemmas in a General Theory of Planning |journal=Policy Sciences |year=1973 |volume=4 |pages=155–169 |url=http://www.uctc.net/mwebber/Rittel+Webber+Dilemmas+General_Theory_of_Planning.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930021510/http://www.uctc.net/mwebber/Rittel+Webber+Dilemmas+General_Theory_of_Planning.pdf |archive-date=30 September 2007 |doi=10.1007/bf01405730}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Ritchey|2013}}

#There is no definitive formulation of a wicked problem&lt;!-- defining a wicked problem cannot itself be a wicked problem, this list is its definition, we just solved it, not so wicked after all--&gt;.
#Wicked problems have no [[stopping rule]].
#Solutions to wicked problems are not [[Principle of bivalence|true-or-false]], but better or worse.
#There is no immediate and no ultimate test of a solution to a wicked problem.
#Every solution to a wicked problem is a "one-shot operation"; because there is no opportunity to learn by [[trial and error]], every attempt counts significantly.
#Wicked problems do not have an enumerable (or an exhaustively describable) set of potential solutions, nor is there a well-described set of permissible operations that may be incorporated into the plan.
#Every wicked problem is essentially unique.
#Every wicked problem can be considered to be a symptom of another problem.
#The existence of a discrepancy representing a wicked problem can be explained in numerous ways. The choice of explanation determines the nature of the problem's resolution.
#The social planner has no right to be wrong (i.e., planners are liable for the consequences of the actions they generate).

Conklin later generalized the concept of problem wickedness to areas other than planning and policy; Conklin's defining characteristics are:&lt;ref name="Conklin 2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Conklin|first=Jeffrey|title=Dialogue mapping : building shared understanding of wicked problems|year=2006|publisher=[[Wiley Publishing]]|location=Chichester, England|isbn=0-470-01768-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#The problem is not understood until after the formulation of a solution.
#Wicked problems have no [[stopping rule]].
#Solutions to wicked problems are not right or wrong.
#Every wicked problem is essentially novel and unique.
#Every solution to a wicked problem is a 'one shot operation.'
#Wicked problems have no given alternative solutions.

== Examples ==
Classic examples of wicked problems include [[economic]], [[Natural environment|environmental]], and [[political]] issues. A problem whose solution requires a great number of people to change their mindsets and behavior is likely to be a wicked problem. Therefore, many standard examples of wicked problems come from the areas of public planning and policy. These include global [[climate change]],{{sfn|Hulme|2009}} [[natural hazards]], [[healthcare]], the [[AIDS]] epidemic, [[pandemic influenza]], international [[drug trafficking]], [[nuclear weapons]], [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]], waste and [[social injustice]].

In recent years, problems in many areas have been identified as exhibiting elements of wickedness; examples range from aspects of design decision making and [[knowledge management]]{{sfn|Courtney|2008}} to [[business strategy]].{{sfn|Camillus|2008}}

== Background ==
Rittel and Webber coined the term in the context of problems of social policy, an arena in which a purely scientific-engineering approach cannot be applied because of the lack of a clear problem definition and differing perspectives of stakeholders. In their words, {{Quote|The search for scientific bases for confronting problems of social policy is bound to fail because of the nature of these problems... Policy problems cannot be definitively described. Moreover, in a pluralistic society there is nothing like the indisputable public good; there is no objective definition of equity; policies that respond to [[social problem]]s cannot be meaningfully correct or false; and it makes no sense to talk about "optimal solutions" to these problems... Even worse, there are no solutions in the sense of definitive answers.&lt;ref name="Rittel and Webber 1973" /&gt;}}

Thus wicked problems are also characterised by the following:{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

# The solution depends on how the problem is framed and vice versa (i.e., the problem definition depends on the solution)
# [[Stakeholder (corporate)|Stakeholders]] have radically different [[world view]]s and different frames for understanding the problem.
# The constraints that the problem is subject to and the resources needed to solve it change over time.
# The problem is never solved definitively.

Although Rittel and Webber framed the concept in terms of social policy and planning, wicked problems occur in any domain involving stakeholders with differing perspectives.&lt;ref name="Conklin 2006" /&gt; Recognising this, Rittel and Kunz developed a technique called [[Issue-Based Information System]] (IBIS), which facilitates documentation of the rationale behind a group decision in an objective manner.&lt;ref name="Kunz and Rittel 1970"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kunz|first=Werner|title=Issues as Elements of Information Systems|year=1970|location=Heidelberg, Germany|author2=Horst W. J. Rittel |accessdate=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recurring theme in research and industry literature is the connection between wicked problems and design.{{sfn|Rittel|1988}}{{sfn|Stolterman|2008}} Design problems are typically wicked because they are often ill defined (no prescribed way forward), involve stakeholders with different perspectives, and have no "right" or "optimal" solution.{{sfn|Conklin|2005|loc=Chapter 1}} Thus wicked problems cannot be solved by the application of standard (or known) methods; they demand creative solutions.{{sfn|Conklin|Basadur|VanPatter|2007a}}{{sfn|Conklin|Basadur|VanPatter|2007b}}

== Strategies to tackle wicked problems ==
Wicked problems cannot be tackled by the traditional approach in which problems are defined, analysed and solved in sequential steps. The main reason for this is that there is no clear problem definition of wicked problems. In a paper published in 2000, Nancy Roberts identified the following strategies to cope with wicked problems:{{sfn|Roberts|2000}}

;Authoritative
:These strategies seek to tame wicked problems by vesting the responsibility for solving the problems in the hands of a few people. The reduction in the number of stakeholders reduces problem complexity, as many competing points of view are eliminated at the start. The disadvantage is that authorities and experts charged with solving the problem may not have an appreciation of all the perspectives needed to tackle the problem.
;Competitive
:These strategies attempt to solve wicked problems by pitting opposing points of view against each other, requiring parties that hold these views to come up with their preferred solutions. The advantage of this approach is that different solutions can be weighed up against each other and the best one chosen. The disadvantage is that this adversarial approach creates a confrontational environment in which knowledge sharing is discouraged. Consequently, the parties involved may not have an incentive to come up with their best possible solution.
;Collaborative
:These strategies aim to engage all stakeholders in order to find the best possible solution for all stakeholders. Typically these approaches involve meetings in which issues and ideas are discussed and a common, agreed approach is formulated.

In his 1972 paper,{{sfn|Rittel|1972}} Rittel hints at a collaborative approach; one which attempts "to make those people who are being affected into participants of the planning process. They are not merely asked but actively involved in the planning process". A disadvantage of this approach is that achieving a shared understanding and commitment to solving a wicked problem is a time-consuming process. Research over the last two decades has shown the value of computer-assisted argumentation techniques in improving the effectiveness of cross-stakeholder communication.{{sfn|Shum|2003}} The technique of [[dialogue mapping]] has been used in tackling wicked problems in organizations using a collaborative approach.{{sfn|Conklin|2003}} More recently, in a four-year study of interorganizational collaboration across public, private, and voluntary sectors, steering by government was found to perversely undermine a successful collaboration, producing an organizational crisis which led to the collapse of a national initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fischer|first=Michael D|title=Organizational Turbulence, Trouble and Trauma: Theorizing the Collapse of a Mental Health Setting|journal=Organization Studies|date=28 September 2012|volume=33|issue=9|pages=1153–1173|doi=10.1177/0170840612448155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fischer|first=Michael Daniel|author2=Ferlie, Ewan |title=Resisting hybridisation between modes of clinical risk management: Contradiction, contest, and the production of intractable conflict|journal=Accounting, Organizations and Society|date=1 January 2013|volume=38|issue=1|pages=30–49|doi=10.1016/j.aos.2012.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Wholesome Design for Wicked Problems", Robert Knapp stated that there are ways forward in dealing with wicked problems: {{Quote|The first is to shift the goal of action on significant problems from "solution" to "intervention." Instead of seeking the answer that totally eliminates a problem, one should recognize that actions occur in an ongoing process, and further actions will always be needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Knapp|first1=Robert|title=Wholesome Design for Wicked Problems|url=http://publicsphereproject.org/content/wholesome-design-wicked-problems|website=Public Sphere Project|accessdate=8 November 2015|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Examining networks designed to tackle wicked problems in health care, such as caring for older people or reducing [[sexually transmitted infections]], Ferlie and colleagues suggest that managed networks may be the "least bad" way of "making wicked problems governable".&lt;ref&gt;Ferlie, E., Fitzgerald, L., McGivern, G., Dopson, S. &amp; Bennett, C. (2013) 'Making Wicked Problems Governable?: The Case of Managed Networks in Health Care.' Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ferlie, E., McGivern, G. &amp; Fitzgerald, L. (2012) 'A New Mode of Organising in Health Care? UK Cancer Services &amp; Governmentality'. Social Science &amp; Medicine, 74 (3) 340-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ferlie, E., McGivern, G., Fitzgerald, L., Dopson, S. &amp; Bennett, C. (2011) 'Public Policy Networks &amp; 'Wicked Problems': A Nascent Solution?' Public Administration,  89 (2) 307–324.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Problem structuring methods ===
{{Main|Problem structuring methods}}
A range of approaches called ''problem structuring methods'' (PSMs) have been developed in [[operations research]] since the 1970s to address problems involving complexity, uncertainty and conflict. PSMs are usually used by a group of people in [[collaboration]] (rather than by a solitary individual) to create a [[consensus]] about, or at least to facilitate [[negotiation]]s about, what needs to change. Some widely adopted PSMs include [[soft systems methodology]], the strategic choice approach, and strategic options development and analysis (SODA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rosenhead |first=Jonathan |date=2013 |chapter=Problem structuring methods |editor1-last=Gass |editor1-first=Saul I. |editor2-last=Fu |editor2-first=Michael C. |title=Encyclopedia of operations research and management science |edition=3rd |location=New York; London |publisher=[[Springer Verlag]] |pages=1162–1172 |isbn=978-1-4419-1137-7 |oclc=751832290 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4419-1153-7_806}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{anchor|Social mess}}Messes and social messes ===
[[Russell Ackoff|Russell L. Ackoff]] wrote about complex problems as messes: "Every problem interacts with other problems and is therefore part of a set of interrelated problems, a system of problems.... I choose to call such a system a mess."{{sfn|Ackoff|1974}}

Extending Ackoff, [[Robert E. Horn|Robert Horn]] says that "a Social Mess is a set of interrelated problems and other messes.  Complexity—systems of systems—is among the factors that makes Social Messes so resistant to analysis and, more importantly, to resolution."

According to Horn, the defining characteristics of a social mess are:{{sfn|Horn|Weber|2007}}
# No unique "correct" view of the problem;
# Different views of the problem and contradictory solutions;
# Most problems are connected to other problems;
# Data are often uncertain or missing;
# Multiple value conflicts;
# [[Ideological]] and cultural constraints;
# Political constraints;
# Economic constraints;
# Often a-logical or illogical or multi-valued thinking;
# Numerous possible intervention points;
# Consequences difficult to imagine;
# Considerable uncertainty, ambiguity;
# Great resistance to change; and,
# Problem solver(s) out of contact with the problems and potential solutions.

=== Divergent and convergent problems ===
[[E. F. Schumacher]] distinguishes between ''divergent and convergent problems'' in his book ''[[A Guide for the Perplexed]]''. Convergent problems are those for which attempted solutions gradually converge on one solution or answer. Divergent problems are those for which different answers appear to increasingly contradict each other all the more they are elaborated, requiring a different approach involving faculties of a higher order like love and empathy.

=== Wicked problems in software development ===
In 1990 DeGrace and Stahl introduced the concept of wicked problems to [[software development]].{{sfn|DeGrace|Stahl|1990}} In the last decade, other [[computer scientist]]s{{sfn|Conklin|2003b}}{{sfn|Sølvberg|Kung|1993}} have pointed out that software development shares many properties with other [[design]] practices (particularly that people-, [[business process|process]]-, and [[technology]]-problems have to be considered equally), and have incorporated Rittel's concepts into their [[software design]] methodologies. The design and integration of complex software-defined services that use the Web ([[web services]]) can be construed as an evolution from previous models of software design, and therefore becomes a wicked problem also.

=== Super wicked problems ===
Kelly Levin, Benjamin Cashore, [[Graeme Auld]] and Steven Bernstein introduced the distinction between "wicked problems" and "super wicked problems" in a 2007 conference paper, which was followed by a 2012 journal article in ''Policy Sciences''. In their discussion of [[Global warming|global climate change]], they define super wicked problems as having the following additional characteristics:&lt;ref name="Levin 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levin|first=Kelly|author2=Cashore, Benjamin |author3=Bernstein, Steven |author4= Auld, Graeme |title=Overcoming the tragedy of super wicked problems: constraining our future selves to ameliorate global climate change|journal=Policy Sciences|date=23 May 2012|volume=45|issue=2|pages=123–152|doi=10.1007/s11077-012-9151-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Time is running out.
# No central authority.
# Those seeking to solve the problem are also causing it.
# Policies discount the future irrationally.

While the items that define a wicked problem relate to the problem itself, the items that define a super wicked problem relate to the agent trying to solve it. Global warming is a super wicked problem, and the need to intervene to tend to our longer term interests has also been taken up by others, including [[Richard Lazarus (law professor)|Richard Lazarus]].&lt;ref name="Lazarus 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lazarus|first=Richard|title=Super Wicked Problems and Climate Change: Restraining the Present to Liberate the Future|journal=Cornell Law Review|date=July 2009|volume=94|issue=5|pages=1153–1233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''World peace''', or '''peace on Earth''', is the concept of an [[ideal (ethics)|ideal]] state of happiness, [[freedom (political)|freedom]] and [[peace]] within and among all people and nations on earth. This idea of world [[non-violence]] is one motivation for people and nations to willingly cooperate, either voluntarily or by virtue of a system of governance that objects it will be solved by cookie 
love and peace. Different cultures, religions, philosophies and organisations have varying concepts on how such a state would come about.

Various religious and secular organisations have the stated aim of achieving world peace through addressing human rights, technology, education, engineering, medicine or [[diplomat|diplomacy]] used as an end to all forms of fighting. Since 1945, the [[United Nations]] and the 5 [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|permanent members]] of its [[Security Council]] (the US, Russia, China, France and the UK) have operated under the aim to resolve conflicts without war or declarations of war. Nonetheless, nations have entered numerous military conflicts since then.

==World peace theories==
{{Main|Peace and conflict studies}}
Many theories as to how world peace could be achieved have been proposed. Several of these are listed below.

===Peace through strength===
{{Main|Peace through strength}}

The term is traced back to the Roman Emperor [[Hadrian]] (reigned AD 117 – 138) but the concept is as old as the recorded history. The Egyptian god [[Ptah]] says that [[Ramses II]]'s (1279–1213 BC) "strength" causes every country "to crave peace":
{{quote|
I have set for thee the might, victory and strength of thy mighty sword in every land ... I assign them to thy mighty sword ... I have thy terror in every heart ... I have set thy fear in every country, thy fear encircles the mountains, and the chiefs tremble at the mention of thee...; they come to thee, crying out together, to crave peace from thee.&lt;ref&gt;''Ancient Records of Egypt. Historical Documents from the Earliest Times to the Persian Conquest'', (ed. [[James Henry Breasted]], London: Nabu Press, 1988), vol III:408, p 179-180.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In 1943, at the peak of [[World War II]], the founder of the [[Paneuropean Union]], [[Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi]], argued that after the War the United States is bound to take "command of the skies" to ensure the lasting world peace:
{{quote|
But the inauguration of such a glorious century of peace demands from us abandonment of old conceptions of peace. The new Angel of Peace must no longer be pictured as a charming but helpless lady with an olive branch in her hand, but like the Goddess of Justice with a balance in her left and a sword in her right; or like the Archangel Michael, with a fiery sword and wings of steel, fighting the devil to restore and protect the peace of heaven.&lt;ref&gt;''Crusade for Pan-Europe'', (New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1943), p 299, 305.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In fact, near the entrance to the headquarters of the [[Strategic Air Command|SAC]] at Offutt Air Base stands a large sign with a SAC emblem and its motto: "Peace is our profession."&lt;ref&gt;Cited in [[Thomas S. Power]], ''Design for Survival'', (New York: Coward McCann, 1964), p 139.&lt;/ref&gt; The motto "was a staggering paradox that was also completely accurate."&lt;ref&gt;Phillip S. Meilinger, ''Bomber: The Formation and Early History of Strategic Air Command'', (Alabama: Air University Press, 2012), p XVIII.&lt;/ref&gt; One SAC Bomber—[[Convair B-36 Peacemaker|Convair B-36]]—is called ''Peacemaker'' and one inter-continental missile-[[LGM-118 Peacekeeper|LGM-118]]-''Peacekeeper''.

In 2016, former US Secretary of Defense [[Ash Carter]] envisaged that the rebalance to the Asia-Pacific will make the region "peaceful" through "strength": 
{{quote|
You, and your fellow soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines will solidify the rebalance, you will make this network work, and you will help the Asia-Pacific ... realize a principled and peaceful and prosperous future.  And play the role only America can play ... You'll do so with strength.&lt;ref&gt;"The Future of the Rebalance: Enabling Security in the Vital &amp; Dynamic Asia-Pacific," (Secretary of Defense Speech, September 29, 2016, Washington: Department of Defense), https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech-View/Article/959937/remarks-on-the-future-of-the-rebalance-enabling-security-in-the-vital-dynamic-a?source=GovDelivery&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Introduction to US National Security and Defense Strategies of 2018 states: The US force posture combined with the allies will "preserve peace through strength." The document proceeds to detail what "achieving peace through strength requires."&lt;ref&gt;US National Secusrity and Defense Strategies, (Washington: Department of Defense, 2018), p 1, 6, https://www.defense.gov/Portals/1/Documents/pubs/2018-National-Defense-Strategy-Summary.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Associated with ''peace through strength'' are concepts of ''preponderance of power'' (as opposed to [[Balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]]), [[hegemonic stability theory]], ''unipolar stability'', and imperial peace (such as [[Pax Romana]], [[Pax Britannica]], or [[Pax Americana]]).

===Marxism: World peace via world revolution===

World peace would be a consequence of the anarchist communist world. According to the dialectic materialist theory of Karl Marx, the humanity is divided in just 2 classes in capitalism, the proletarians -that do not possess the means of production- and the bourgeoisie -that possesses the means of production-, once that the communist revolution, that shall abolish the private propriety of the means of production, have happened, humanity will not be divided anymore and a lot of changes will happen. Through a period called socialism the dictatorship of the proletarians will take charge of getting rid of the last vestiges of capitalism, and help to make the revolution worldwide. Once the private propriety have been abolished worldwide, the state will not longer be useful and will disappear, because the government only exists to protect the dominant class, effectively dominating with violence and fear the submitted class, but there will not be classes anymore, and therefore none will require to dominate anyone. Instead organisations of workers will manage the production of things, but no organisation will have any military power, neither police force or prisons.

The main principle of Marx's theory is that the material conditions limit the spiritual conditions. People will not be violent but respecting, peaceful and altruistic, because the material conditions will finally allow them to be so. They do not longer need to live just aiming to earn money, but they live to develop themselves spiritually. With the material problems solved, and everyone receiving education and being provided  the appropriate circumstances for their intellectual development, there will not any problem, and society will work getting from each one what one has the capacity to give, and providing to each one what one need.

[[Leon Trotsky]] argued that a proletariat [[world revolution]] would lead to world peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1914/war/ | first = Leon | last = Trotsky | title = War and the International | year = 1914 | publisher = Marxists}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Democratic peace theory===
Proponents of the [[democratic peace theory]] claim that strong empirical evidence exists that democracies never or rarely wage war against each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/ray.htm |publisher=M Tholyoke |title=International relations |contribution=Ray |place=USA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217032515/http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/ray.htm |archivedate=17 February 2008 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/politics/faculty/smith/dempeace.PDF |format=[[PDF]] |publisher=New York University |place=USA |last=Smith |title=Politics |contribution=Democracy &amp; peace}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=https://www.academia.edu/2486355/Dyadic_Democratic_Peace_Strikes_Back_Reconstructing_the_Social_Constructivist_Approach_After_the_Monadic_Renaissance |title=Dyadic Democratic Peace Strikes Back |accessdate=31 July 2013 |author=Müller, Harald and Jonas Wolff |booktitle=5th Pan-European International Relations ConferenceThe Hague |date=September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20051101fareviewessay84611/john-m-owen-iv/iraq-and-the-democratic-peace.html |work=ForeignAffairs.org |date=1 November 2005 |title=Fareview essay |first=John M, IV |last=Owen |id="Iraq and the democratic peace" |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051221155722/http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20051101fareviewessay84611/john-m-owen-iv/iraq-and-the-democratic-peace.html |archivedate=21 December 2005 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are, however, several [[List of wars between democracies|wars between democracies]] that have taken place, historically.

===Capitalism peace theory===
In her essay "The Roots of War", [[Ayn Rand]] held that the major wars of history were started by the more controlled economies of the time against the freer ones and that capitalism gave mankind the longest period of peace in history—a period during which there were no wars involving the entire civilized world—from the end of the Napoleonic wars in 1815 to the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914, with the exceptions of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (1870), the [[Spanish–American War]] (1898), and the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865), which notably occurred in perhaps the most liberal economy in the world at the beginning of the industrial revolution.

===Cobdenism===
Proponents of [[Cobdenism]] claim that by removing tariffs and creating international [[free trade]] wars would become impossible, because free trade prevents a nation from becoming [[self-sufficient]], which is a requirement for long wars.

However, free trade does not prevent a nation from establishing some sort of emergency plan to become temporarily self-sufficient in case of war or that a nation could simply acquire what it needs from a different nation. A good example of this is [[World War I]], during which both Britain and Germany became partially self-sufficient. This is particularly important because Germany had no plan for creating a [[war economy]].

More generally, free trade—while not making wars impossible—can make wars, and restrictions on trade caused by wars, very costly for international companies with production, research, and sales in many different nations. Thus, a powerful lobby—unless there are only national companies—will argue against wars.

===Mutual assured destruction===
[[Mutual assured destruction]] is a [[doctrine]] of military strategy in which a full-scale use of [[nuclear weapons]] by two opposing sides would effectively result in the destruction of both belligerents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.nuclearfiles.org/menu/key-issues/nuclear-weapons/history/cold-war/strategy/strategy-mutual-assured-destruction.htm | publisher = Nuclear files | title = Strategy | contribution = Mutual Assured Destruction}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Col. Alan J | last = Parrington | publisher = Air Force | place = USA | url = http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj97/win97/parrin.html | contribution = Mutually Assured Destruction Revisited, Strategic Doctrine in Question | title = Airpower Journal | date = Winter 1997 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150620055606/http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj97/win97/parrin.html | archivedate = 20 June 2015 | df = dmy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the policy of mutual assured destruction during the Cold War attributed this to the increase in the lethality of war to the point where it no longer offers the possibility of a net gain for either side, thereby making wars pointless.

===United Nations Charter and international law===
After World War II, the United Nations was established by the [[United Nations Charter]] to "save successive generations from the scourge of war which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind" (Preamble). The [[Preamble to the United Nations Charter]] also aims to further the adoption of fundamental human rights, to respect obligations to [[sources of international law]] as well as to unite the strength of independent countries in order to maintain international peace and [[international security|security]]. All treaties on [[international human rights law]] make reference to or consider "the principles proclaimed in the Charter of the United Nations, recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and "peace in the world".

===Declaration of Peace and Cessation of War===
Declaration of Peace and Cessation of War (DPCW) with 10 article and 38 clauses is an international legal framework drafted by HWPL International Law Peace Committee, composed of international law experts from 15 countries. DPCW is proclaimed as a law for peace, which promotes the engagement of civil society actors, by provoking their advocacy and promoting voluntary practices of democratic values, as peace is considered difficult to be achieved only by the voices of the elites or with current institutions. 

The Preambles of DPCW are:1. Prohibit the threat or use of force; 2. Reduce war potential and repurpose weapons to benefit humanity; 3. Develop friendly relations and prohibit acts of aggression; 4. Prohibit coercion against internationally recognised state boundaries; 5. Ensure the right to self-determination of peoples of states; 6. Settle international disputes through peaceful means; 7. Acknowledge the right to self-defence; 8. Foster religious freedom; 9. Promote peaceful coexistence amongst religious and ethnic groups; 10. Spread a culture of peace.&lt;ref&gt;http://hwpl.kr/en/initiative/lawForPeace&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the global movement of support from civil society, increasing awareness and support of DPCW from former and current heads of states, civil society actors and government representatives from different countries are received such that the legal document to be submitted and introduced into the UN. 

===Globalization===
[[Gordon B. Hinckley]] saw a trend in national politics by which [[city-states]] and [[nation-states]] have unified and suggests that the international arena will eventually follow suit. Many countries such as China, Italy, the United States, Australia, Germany, India and Britain have unified into single nation-states with others like the [[European Union]] following suit, suggesting that further [[globalization]] will bring about a [[world state]].

===Self-organized peace===
World peace has been depicted as a consequence of local, self-determined behaviors that inhibit the institutionalization of power and ensuing violence.  The solution is not so much based on an agreed agenda, or an investment in higher authority whether divine or political, but rather a [[Self-organization|self-organized]] network of mutually supportive mechanisms, resulting in a viable politico-economic social fabric. The principal technique for inducing convergence is [[thought experiment]], namely [[backcasting]], enabling anyone to participate no matter what cultural background, religious doctrine, political affiliation or age demographic. Similar collaborative mechanisms are emerging from the Internet around [[open-source model|open-source]] projects, including Wikipedia, and the evolution of other [[social media]].

===Economic norms theory===
[[Michael Mousseau|Economic norms theory]] links economic conditions with institutions of governance and conflict, distinguishing personal [[clientelism|clientelist]] economies from impersonal market-oriented ones, identifying the latter with permanent peace within and between nations.&lt;ref name = "Mousseau 2009"&gt;{{Citation | first = Michael | last = Mousseau | contribution = The Social Market Roots of Democratic Peace | title = International Security | volume = 33 | number = 4 | date = Spring 2009 | pages = 52–86}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Michael | last = Mousseau | author-mask = 8 | contribution = Market Civilization and its Clash with Terror | title = International Security | volume = 27 | number = 3 | date = Winter 2002–2003 | pages = 5–29}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through most of human history societies have been based on personal relations: individuals in groups know each other and exchange favors. Today in most lower-income societies hierarchies of groups distribute wealth based on personal relationships among group leaders, a process often linked with clientelism and corruption. [[Michael Mousseau]] argues that in this kind of socio-economy conflict is always present, latent or overt, because individuals depend on their groups for physical and economic security and are thus loyal to their groups rather than their states, and because groups are in a constant state of conflict over access to state coffers. Through processes of [[bounded rationality]], people are conditioned towards strong in-group identities and are easily swayed to fear outsiders, psychological predispositions that make possible sectarian violence, genocide, and terrorism.&lt;ref name = "Mousseau 2003"&gt;{{Citation | first = Michael |last= Mousseau |author-mask = 8 | year = 2003 |title= The Nexus of Market Society, Liberal Preferences, and Democratic Peace: Interdisciplinary Theory and Evidence | journal= International Studies Quarterly | volume= 47 |number= 4 |pages= 483–510 | doi=10.1046/j.0020-8833.2003.00276.x}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Market-oriented socio-economies are integrated not with personal ties but the impersonal force of the market where most individuals are economically dependent on trusting strangers in contracts enforced by the state.  This creates loyalty to a state that enforces the rule of law and contracts impartially and reliably and provides equal protection in the freedom to contract – that is, liberal democracy.  Wars cannot happen within or between nations with market-integrated economies because war requires the harming of others, and in these kinds of economies everyone is always economically better off when others in the market are also better off, not worse off. Rather than fight, citizens in market-oriented socio-economies care deeply about everyone's rights and welfare, so they demand economic growth at home and economic cooperation and human rights abroad.  In fact, nations with market-oriented socio-economies tend to agree on global issues&lt;ref name = "Mousseau 2003" /&gt; and not a single fatality has occurred in any dispute between them.&lt;ref name = "Mousseau 2009" /&gt;

Economic norms theory should not be confused with classical liberal theory. The latter assumes that markets are natural and that freer markets promote wealth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Milton Friedman|Friedman, Milton]]. 1970. ''[[Capitalism and Freedom]]''. Chicago : University of Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Economic norms theory shows how market-contracting is a learned norm, and state spending, regulation, and redistribution are necessary to ensure that almost everyone can participate in the "social market" economy, which is in everyone's interests. One proposed mechanism for world peace involves consumer purchasing of renewable and equitable local food and power sources involving [[artificial photosynthesis]] ushering in a period of social and ecological harmony known as the [[Sustainocene]].

==International Day of Peace==
The [[International Day of Peace]], sometimes called World Peace Day, is observed annually on 21 September. It is dedicated to peace, and specifically the absence of war and violence, and can be celebrated by a temporary ceasefire in a combat zone. The International Day of Peace was established in 1981 by the United Nations General Assembly. Two decades later, in 2001, the General Assembly unanimously voted to designate the day as a day of preventing violence and a cease-fire. The celebration of this day is recognized by many nations and people. In 2013, for the first time, the day has been dedicated to [[peace education]], i.e. by the key preventive means to reduce war sustainably.

==Religious views==
[[File:Mt._Ecclesia-3.jpg|upright=1.5|thumb|A long-standing suggestion for World Peace Meditation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rosicrucian.com/zineen/pamen050.htm Suggestion For World Peace Meditation]. [[Mount Ecclesia]], CA, USA&lt;/ref&gt; along with annual purposeful devotional dates,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rosicrucian.com/docs/dates2017s_eng.pdf World Peace Meditation: 2017 Devotional Services Dates and Times]. Mount Ecclesia, CA, USA&lt;/ref&gt; as faithfully performed by a [[fraternal organization]] whose founder taught, in the 1910s, that "'''[[Peace education|Peace is a matter of education]]''', and impossible of achievement until we have learned to deal charitably, justly, and openly with one another, as nations as well as [[individual]]s."&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Heindel|Heindel, Max]]. ''Letters to Students'': LETTER NO. 92, July 1918. [[Rosicrucian Fellowship|TRF]], CA, USA (various editions/publishers)&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Many religions and religious leaders have expressed a desire for an end to violence.

===Bahá'í Faith===
{{Main|Bahá'í Faith and the unity of humanity}}
The central aim of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] is the establishment of the unity of the peoples of the world. [[Bahá'u'lláh]], the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, stated in no uncertain terms, "the fundamental purpose animating the Faith of God and His Religion is to safeguard the interests and promote the unity of the human race ..." In His writings, Bahá'u'lláh described two distinct stages of world peace – a lesser peace and a most great peace.

The lesser peace is essentially a collective security agreement between the nations of the world. In this arrangement, nations agree to protect one another by rising up against an aggressor nation, should it seek the usurpation of territory or the destruction of its neighbors. The lesser peace is limited in scope and is concerned with the establishment of basic order and the universal recognition of national borders and the sovereignty of nations. Bahá'ís believe that the lesser peace is taking place largely through the operation of the Divine Will, and that Bahá'í influence on the process is relatively minor.

The most great peace is the eventual end goal of the lesser peace and is envisioned as a time of spiritual and social unity – a time when the peoples of the world genuinely identify with and care for one another, rather than simply tolerating one other's existence. The Bahá'ís view this process as taking place largely as a result of the spread of Bahá'í teachings, principles and practices throughout the world. The larger world peace process and its foundational elements are addressed in the document ''[[The Promise of World Peace]]'', written by the [[Universal House of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=P. |year=1999 |title=A Concise Encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location=Oxford, UK |isbn=1-85168-184-1 |pages=363–364 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
{{Main|Buddhism}}
Many [[Buddhist]]s believe that world peace can only be achieved if we first establish [[peace]] within our minds. The idea is that [[anger]] and other negative states of [[mind]] are the cause of wars and fighting. Buddhists believe people can live in [[peace]] and [[harmony]] only if we abandon negative emotions such as anger in our minds and cultivate positive emotions such as love and [[compassion]].  As with all [[Dharmic religions]] (Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism), [[ahimsa]] (avoidance of violence) is a central concept.

[[Peace pagoda]]s are monuments that are built to symbolize and inspire world peace and have been central to the peace movement throughout the years. These are typically of Buddhist origin, being built by the Japanese Buddhist organisation [[Nipponzan Myohoji]]. They exist around the world in cities such as London, Vienna, New Delhi, Tokyo and [[Lumbini]].

===Christianity===
{{Main|Christian pacifism}}
The basic Christian ideal specifies that [[peace]] can only come by the Word and love of God, which is perfectly demonstrated in the life of Christ:

{{quote|Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.|{{bibleref|John|14:27|NIV}}}}

As christologically interpreted from {{bibleref|Isaiah|2|NIV}}, whereupon the  "Word of the Lord" is established on the earth, the material human-political result will be 'nation not taking up sword against nation; nor will they train for war anymore'. Christian world peace necessitates the living of a proactive life replete with all good works in direct light of the Word of God. The details of such a life can be observed in the Gospels, especially the historically renowned Sermon on the Mount, where [[forgiveness|forgiving]] those who do wrong things against oneself is advocated among other pious precepts.

However, not all Christians expect a lasting world peace on this earth:

{{quote|Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword. For I have come to turn a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law—a man's enemies will be the members of his own household.|{{bibleverse|Matt|10:34–36|NIV}}}}

Many Christians believe that world peace is expected to be manifest upon the "new earth" that is promised in Christian scripture such as {{bibleref|Revelation|21|NIV}}.

The [[Roman Catholic]] religious conception of "[[Consecration of Russia]]", related to the Church's high-priority [[Our Lady of Fátima|Fátima]] [[Marian apparitions]], promises ''world peace'' as a result of this process being fulfilled.

===Hinduism===
{{Main|Hinduism}}
Traditionally, [[Hinduism]] has adopted an ancient [[Sanskrit]] phrase ''[[Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam|Vasudha eka kutumbakam]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindudharmaforums.com/showthread.php?t=969&amp;page=3|title=Dharmic Wisdom Quotes – Page 3|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which translates as "The world is one family." The essence of this concept is the observation that only base minds see dichotomies and divisions. The more we seek wisdom, the more we become inclusive and free our internal spirit from worldly illusions or ''[[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]''. World peace is hence only achieved through internal means—by liberating ourselves from artificial boundaries that separate us all.  As with all [[Dharmic religions]] (Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism), [[ahimsa]] (avoidance of violence) is a central concept.

===Islam===
{{Main|Islamic Peace}}

According to [[Islamic eschatology]], the whole world will be united under the leadership of prophet [[Jesus in Islam|Isa ]] in his [[second coming]].&lt;ref&gt;Bukhari, Kitab Ahadith al-Ambiya; Bab: Nuzul 'Isa Ibn Maryam; Muslim, Bab: Bayan Nuzul 'Isa; Tirmidhi, Abwab-al-Fitan; Bab Fi Nuzul 'Isa; Musnad Ahmad, Marwiyat Abu Huraira.http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Books/M_fop/fop11.htm&lt;/ref&gt; At that time love, justice and peace will be so abundant that the world will be in likeness of [[paradise]].

===Judaism===
{{Main|Judaism}}

The concept of ''[[Tikkun olam]]'' (Repairing the World) is central to modern [[Rabbinic Judaism]]. ''Tikkun olam'' is accomplished through various means, such as ritualistically performing God's commandments, charity and social justice, as well as through example persuading the rest of the world to behave morally. According to some views, Tikkun Olam would result in the beginning of the Messianic Age. It has been said that in every generation, a person is born with the potential to be the spiritual [[Mashiach|Messiah]]. If the time is right for the Messianic Age within that person's lifetime, then that person will be the mashiach. But if that person dies before he completes the mission of the Messiah, then that person is not the Messiah (Mashiach).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/mashiach.htm|title=Judaism 101: Mashiach: The Messiah|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, in [[Jewish messianism]] it is considered that at some future time a ''Messiah'' (literally "a King appointed by God") will rise up to bring all Jews back to the [[Land of Israel]], followed by everlasting global peace and prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;Rambam, [[Mishneh Torah]], Hilkhot Melachim, ch. 11–12&lt;/ref&gt; This idea originates from passages in the [[Old Testament]] and the [[Talmud]].
{{quote|And he shall judge between the nations and reprove many peoples, and they shall beat their [[Swords to ploughshares|swords into plowshares]] and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift the sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore.|{{bibleref|Isaiah|2:4|JPR}}}}

===Jainism===
{{Main|Jainism}}
[[Ahimsa in Jainism|Compassion for all life, human and non-human]], is central to [[Jainism]].They have adopted the wordings of Lord Mahvira [[Jiyo aur Jeeno Do]] Human life is valued as a unique, rare opportunity to reach enlightenment; to kill any person, no matter what crime he may have committed, is considered unimaginably abhorrent. It is a religion that requires monks and laity, from all its sects and traditions, to be vegetarian. Some Indian regions, such as Gujarat, have been strongly influenced by Jains and often the majority of the local Hindus of every denomination have also become vegetarian.&lt;ref&gt;Titze, Kurt, Jainism: A Pictorial Guide to the Religion of Non-Violence, Mohtilal Banarsidass, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Famous quote on world peace as per Jainism by a 19th-century Indian legend, [[Virchand Gandhi]]: "May peace rule the universe; may peace rule in kingdoms and empires; may peace rule in states and in the lands of the potentates; may peace rule in the house of friends and may peace also rule in the house of enemies."&lt;ref&gt;Useful instructions, In Matter religious, moral and others by Motilal M. Munishi, 1904&lt;/ref&gt; As with all [[Dharmic religions]] (Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism), [[ahimsa]] (avoidance of violence) is a central concept.

===Sikhism===
{{Main|Sikhism}}
Peace comes from God.  Meditation, the means of communicating with God, is unfruitful without the noble character of a devotee, there can be no worship without performing good deeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Angela|title=Movement and Change|year=1997|publisher=Nelson Thornes|isbn=9780174370673|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guru Nanak stressed now ''[[kirat karō]]'': that a Sikh should balance work, worship, and charity, and should defend the rights of all creatures, and in particular, fellow human beings. They are encouraged to have a ''[[chaṛdī kalā]]'', or ''optimistic'' – ''resilience'', view of life. Sikh teachings also stress the concept of sharing—''[[vaṇḍ chakkō]]''—through the distribution of free food at Sikh [[gurdwara]]s (''[[Langar (Sikhism)|laṅgar]]''), giving charitable donations, and working for the good of the community and others (''[[Selfless service|sēvā]]''). Sikhs believe that no matter what race, sex, or religion one is, all are equal in God's eyes. Men and women are equal and share the same rights, and women can lead in prayers. As with all [[Dharmic religions]] (Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism), [[ahimsa]] (avoidance of violence) is a central concept.

==Economic implications==
A report in June 2015 on the [[Global Peace Index]] highlighted that the impact of violence on the global economy reached US$14.3&amp;nbsp;trillion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-33161837|title=Global conflicts 'cost 13% of world GDP'|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report also found that the economic cost of violence is 13.4% of world GDP, equal to the total economic output of Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Spain and the UK combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/16/global-cost-conflict-reaches-14tn-says-report|title=Global cost of conflict reaches $14.3tn, says report|author=Mark Anderson|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Āhrīkya''' (Sanskrit; Pali: ''ahirika''; Tibetan phonetic: ''ngotsa mepa'') is a [[Buddhist]] term that is translated as "lack of shame", "lack of conscience", etc. In the Theravada tradition, ''ahirika'' is defined as the absence of disgust at physical or verbal misconduct.&lt;ref name=bodhi1&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ACrogsyJmoAC&amp;q=vitakka#v=snippet&amp;q=ahirika&amp;f=false Bhikkhu Bodhi (2003), pp. 83]&lt;/ref&gt; In the Mahayana tradition, ''āhrīkya'' is defined as not restraining from wrongdoing due to one's own conscience.&lt;ref name=g1&gt;Guenther (1975), Kindle Locations 931–932.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eric1&gt;Kunsang (2004), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Āhrīkya is identified as:
* One of the [[Mental factors (Buddhism)#Fourteen unwholesome mental factors|fourteen unwholesome mental factors]] within the Theravada Abhidharma teachings
* One of the [[Mental factors (Buddhism)#Twenty secondary unwholesome factors|twenty secondary unwholesome factors]] within the Mahayana Abhidharma teachings

==Explanations==

===Theravada===
In the [[Visuddhimagga]] (XIV, 160), ahirika (consciencelessness) is defined together with [[anottappa]] (shamelessness) as follows:
:Herein, it has no conscientious scruples, thus it is consciencelessness (ahirika). It is unashamed, thus it is shamelessness (anottappa). Of these, ahirika has the characteristic of absence of disgust at bodily misconduct, etc., or it has the characteristic of immodesty. Anottappa has the characteristic of absence of dread on their account, or it has the characteristic of absence of anxiety about them...&lt;ref name=gorkom1&gt;Gorkom (2010), [http://www.zolag.co.uk/Cetasikas/html_node/Ignorance-Shamelessness-Recklessness-and-Restlessness.html#Ignorance-Shamelessness-Recklessness-and-Restlessness Definition of Ignorance, Shamelessness, Recklessness and Restlessness]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nina van Gorkom explains:
:The two cetasikas shamelessness and recklessness seem to be very close in meaning, but they have different characteristics. Shamelessness does not shrink from evil because it is not ashamed of it and does not abhor it. The “Paramattha Mañjūsā” compares it to a domestic pig which does not abhor filth. Defilements ([[kilesa]]) are like filth, they are unclean, impure. Shamelessness does not abhor defilements, be it attachment, aversion, ignorance, avarice, jealousy, conceit or any other kind of unwholesomeness.

:As to recklessness, it does not abhor, draw back from evil because it does not see the danger of akusala and it does not fear its consequences such as an unhappy rebirth. The “Paramattha Mañjūsā” compares recklessness to a moth which is attracted to the fire, although this is dangerous for it. Are we enslaved by pleasant experiences? We may even commit evil through body, speech or mind on account of them. Then recklessness does not fear the danger of akusala, it does not care about the consequences of akusala.&lt;ref name=gorkom1/&gt;

===Mahayana===
The [[Abhidharma-samuccaya]] states: 
:What is shamelessness (ahrīkya)? It is not restraining oneself by taking one's perversions as one's norm. It is an emotional event associated with passion-lust ([[Raga (Buddhism)|raga]]), aversion-hatred ([[dvesha]]), and bewilderment-erring ([[Moha (Buddhism)|moha]]). It aids all basic and proximate emotions.&lt;ref name=g1/&gt;

Alexander Berzin explains:
:No moral self-dignity (ngo-tsha med-pa, no sense of honor) is a part of any of the three poisonous emotions. It is the lack of any sense to refrain from destructive behavior because of caring how our actions reflect on ourselves. According to [[Vasubandhu]], this subsidiary awareness means having no sense of values. It is a lack of respect for positive qualities or persons possessing them.&lt;ref name=b1&gt;Berzin (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;
