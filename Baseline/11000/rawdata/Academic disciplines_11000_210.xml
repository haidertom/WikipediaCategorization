'''Anthropotechnic''' is a term used in [[art]], [[science]] and [[literature]] to denote something with aspects of both man and machine.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;Charwat, Hans Jürgen: Lexikon der Mensch-Maschine-Kommunikation. Oldenbourg, 1994, {{ISBN|3-486-22618-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Painting]]s such as [[Max Ernst]]'s "Oedipus Rex" are early examples of the use of this quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.famous-painters.org/Max-Ernst/Oedipus-Rex.shtm |title=Oedipus Rex - Max Ernst Painting Gallery |publisher=Famous-painters.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In technology, it is any field of science that attempts to make machines and automation more user-friendly. In sociology, it is used to describe the relationship between man and anything that is perceived as inflexible or inhumane such as slavery, religion or animals.

The '''Architecture Studies Library''' (ASL) is located in the ''Paul B. Sogg Architecture Building'', located on the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]] campus. The services of the library  address both the needs of the faculty and students of the  [[UNLV School of Architecture]], and also responds to the needs of researchers  through an email reference service.  The Library provides historical and current information and resources about [[architecture in Las Vegas]], primarily through its [http://www.library.unlv.edu/arch/archdb/arch.php  Las Vegas Architects and Buildings Database]. 

==History==
The building was completed and occupied in August 1997. The Architecture Studies Library (approximately 16,000 gross square feet) includes spaces for book and periodical stacks, individual carrels on both of its floors, current periodicals display shelving, exhibits, a reference area, clippings files, special collections, group study rooms, and a computer lab.

The architect for the building was Swisher &amp; Hall Architects of Las Vegas. The interiors furniture selection and placement was a project of one of the School's interior design classes.

==Collections==
The ASL provides an archival collection of Nevada AIA design awards spanning over a quarter of a century, in addition to summarized data on architectural projects, firms and individuals both through its inhouse collection of materials as well as its online materials, a few of which are listed below:

'''Biological soil crusts''' are communities of living organisms on the [[soil]] surface in [[arid]] and [[semi-arid]] ecosystems. They are found throughout the world with varying species composition and cover depending on [[topography]], soil characteristics, [[climate]], [[plant community]], [[microhabitats]], and [[disturbance regimes]]. Biological soil crusts perform important ecological roles including carbon fixation, nitrogen fixation, soil stabilization, alter soil albedo and water relations, and affect germination and nutrient levels in vascular plants. They can be damaged by fire, recreational activity, grazing, and other disturbance and can require long time periods to recover composition and function. Biological soil crusts are also known as ''cryptogamic'', ''microbiotic'', ''microphytic'', or ''cryptobiotic'' soils.

==Natural History==
===Biology and composition===
Biological soil crusts are most often&lt;ref name="belnap crypto 2013"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geochange.er.usgs.gov/sw/impacts/biology/crypto/ |title=Cryptobiotic Soils: Holding the Place in Place |first=Jayne |last=Belnap |publisher=[[U.S. Geological Survey]] |date=August 5, 2013 |accessdate=May 10, 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6hPb2odvA?url=http://geochange.er.usgs.gov/sw/impacts/biology/crypto/ |archivedate=May 10, 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; composed of [[fungi]], [[lichens]], [[cyanobacteria]], [[bryophytes]], and [[algae]] in varying proportions. These organisms live in intimate association in the uppermost few millimeters of the soil surface, and are the biological basis for the formation of soil crusts.

'''Cyanobacteria'''
{{main|Cyanobacteria}}
Cyanobacteria are the main photosynthetic component of biological soil crusts,&lt;ref name="moore sonoran 2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mineralarts.com/artwork/cryptos.html |title=Cryptobiotic Crust in the Sonoran Desert |date=March 23, 2010 |first=Lorena B. |last=Moore |publisher=Southern Arizona Desert Botany |accessdate=May 10, 2016 |archivedate=May 10, 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6hPbc2N4S?url=http://www.mineralarts.com/artwork/cryptos.html |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to other photosynthetic taxa such as mosses, lichens, and green algae. The most common cyanobacteria found in soil crusts belong to large filamentous species such as those in the genus ''[[Microcoleus]]''.&lt;ref name="belnap crypto 2013"/&gt; These species form bundled filaments that are surrounded by a gelatinous sheath of [[polysaccharides]]. These filaments bind soil particles throughout the uppermost soil layers, forming a 3-D net-like structure that holds the soil together in a crust. Other common cyanobacteria species are as those in the genus ''[[Nostoc]]'', which can also form sheaths and sheets of filaments that stabilize the soil. Some ''Nostoc'' species are also able to fix atmospheric nitrogen gas into bio-available forms such as [[ammonia]].

'''Bryophytes'''
{{main|Bryophyte}}
Bryophytes in soil crusts include [[mosses]] and [[liverworts]]. Mosses are usually classified as short annual mosses or tall perennial mosses. Liverworts can be flat and ribbon-like or leafy. They can reproduce by spore formation or by asexual fragmentation, and photosynthesize to fix carbon from the atmosphere.

'''Lichens'''
{{main|Lichen}}
Lichens are often distinguished by growth form and by their photosymbiont. Crust lichens include crustose and [[aerolate]] lichens that are appressed to the soil substrate, [[squamulose]] lichens with scale- or plate-like bodies that are raised above the soils, and foliose lichens with more “leafy” structures that can be attached to the soil at only one portion. Lichens with algal symbionts can fix atmospheric carbon, while lichens with cyanobacterial symbionts [[Lichens and nitrogen cycling|can fix nitrogen]] as well. Lichens produce many pigments that help protect them from radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=UV-induction of sun-screening pigments in lichens |date=April 2003 |first=Knut Asbjørn |last=Solhaug |first2=Yngvar |last2=Gauslaa |first3=Line |last3=Nybakken |first4=Wolfgang |last4=Bilger |journal=New Phytologist |pages=91–100 |doi=10.1046/j.1469-8137.2003.00708.x |deadurl=yes |df= |volume=158 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fungi'''

[[Microfungi]] in biological soil crusts can occur as free-living species, or in [[symbiosis]] with algae in lichens. Free-living microfungi often function as decomposers, and contribute to soil microbial biomass. Many microfungi in biological soil crusts have adapted to the intense light conditions by evolving the ability to produce [[melanin]], and are called black fungi or [[black yeast]]s. Fungal [[hyphae]] can bind soil particles together.

'''Free-living green algae'''
{{main|Green algae}}
[[Green algae]] in soil crusts are present just below the soil surface where they are partially protected from UV radiation. They become inactive when dry and reactivate when moistened. They can photosynthesize to fix carbon from the atmosphere.

===Formation and succession===
Biological soil crusts are formed in open spaces between [[vascular plants]]. Frequently, single-celled organisms such as cyanobacteria or spores of free-living fungi colonize bare ground first. Once filaments have stabilized the soil, lichens and mosses can colonize. Appressed lichens are generally earlier colonizers or persist in more stressful conditions, while more three-dimensional lichens require long disturbance-free growth periods and more moderate conditions.
Recovery following disturbance varies. Cyanobacteria cover can recover by propagules blowing in from adjacent undisturbed areas rapidly after disturbance. Total recovery of cover and composition occurs more rapidly in fine soil textured, moister environments (~2 years) and more slowly (&gt;3800 years)&lt;ref name=BSCEM/&gt; in coarse soil textured, dry environments. Recovery times also depend on disturbance regime, site, and availability of propagules.

==Distribution==
===Geographical range===
[[File:Cryptobiotic soil crust in Natural Bridges National Monument near Sipapu 20100906 - number 5.png|thumb|right|Biological soil crust in [[Natural Bridges National Monument]] near [[Sipapu Bridge]].]]
Biological soil crusts are found on almost all soil types, but are more commonly found in arid regions of the world where plant cover is low and plants are more widely spaced. This is because crust organisms have a limited ability to grow upwards and cannot compete for light with vascular plants. Across the globe, biological soil crusts can be found on all continents including Antarctica.&lt;ref name=FGBSC&gt;Rosentreter, R., M. Bowker, and J. Belnap. 2007. A Field Guide to Biological Soil Crusts of Western U.S. Drylands. U.S. Government Printing Office, Denver, Colorado.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Variation throughout range===
The species composition and physical appearance of biological soil crusts vary depending on the climate, soil, and disturbance conditions. For example, biological soil crusts are more dominated by green algae on more acidic and less salty soils, whereas cyanobacteria are more favored on alkaline and haline soils. Within a [[climate zone]], the abundance of lichens and mosses in biological soil crusts generally increases with increasing clay and silt content and decreasing sand. Also, habitats that are more moist generally support more lichens and mosses.

The morphology of biological soil crust surfaces can range from smooth and a few millimeters in thickness to pinnacles up to 15&amp;nbsp;cm high. Smooth biological soil crusts occur in hot deserts where the soil does not freeze, and consist mostly of cyanobacteria, algae, and fungi. Thicker and rougher crusts occur in areas where higher precipitation results in increased cover of lichen and mosses, and [[frost heaving]] of these surfaces cause microtopography such as rolling hills and steep pinnacles. Due to the intense [[UV]] radiation present in areas where biological soil crusts occur, biological soil crusts appear darker than the crustless soil in the same area due to the UV-protective pigmentation of cyanobacteria and other crust organisms.&lt;ref name=FGBSC/&gt;

==Ecology==
===Ecosystem function and services===
====Biogeochemical cycling====

'''Carbon cycling'''
Biological soil crusts contribute to the [[carbon cycle]] through [[Soil gas|respiration]] and [[photosynthesis]] of crust microorganisms which are active only when wet. Respiration can begin in as little as 3 minutes after wetting whereas photosynthesis reaches full activity after 30 minutes. Some groups have different responses to high water content, with some lichens showing decreased photosynthesis when water content was greater than 60% whereas green algae showed little response to high water content.&lt;ref name=BSCEM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soilcrust.org/crust.pdf|format=PDF|title=Biological Soil Crusts:  Ecology and Management|last1=Belnap |first1=Jayne |display-authors=etal |date=2001|publisher=[[U.S. Department of the Interior]]: [[Bureau of Land Management]] and [[U.S. Geological Survey]]|id=Technical Reference 1730-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Photosynthesis rates are also dependent on temperature, with rates increasing up to approximately {{convert|28|°C|°F}}.

Estimates for annual carbon inputs range from 0.4 to 37 g/cm*year depending on successional state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Housman | first1 = D.C. | last2 = Powers | first2 = H.H. | last3 = Collins | first3 = A.D. | last4 = Belnap | first4 = J. | year = 2006 | title = Carbon and nitrogen fixation differ between successional stages of biological soil crusts in the Colorado Plateau and Chihuahuan Desert | journal = Journal of Arid Environments | volume = 66 | issue = 4| pages = 620–634 | doi=10.1016/j.jaridenv.2005.11.014| type = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of total net carbon uptake by crusts globally are ~3.9 pg/year (2.1-7.4 pg/year).&lt;ref name="Elbert, W. 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Elbert | first1 = W. | last2 = Weber | first2 = B. | last3 = Burrows | first3 = S. | last4 = Steinkamp | first4 = J. | last5 = Budel | first5 = B. | last6 = Andreae | first6 = M. O. | last7 = Poschl | first7 = U. | year = 2012 | title = Contribution of cryptogamic covers to the global cycles of carbon and nitrogen | url = | journal = Nature Geoscience | volume = 5 | issue = 7| pages = 459–462 | doi=10.1038/ngeo1486}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nitrogen cycling'''
Biological soil crust contributions to the [[nitrogen cycle]] varies by crust composition because only cyanobacteria and cyanolichens fix nitrogen. [[Nitrogen fixation]] requires energy from photosynthesis products, and thus increase with temperature given sufficient moisture. Nitrogen fixed by crusts has been shown to leak into surrounding substrate and can be taken up by plants, bacteria, and fungi. 
Nitrogen fixation has been recorded at rates of 0.7–100&amp;nbsp;kg/ha*year, from hot deserts in Australia to cold deserts.&lt;ref&gt;Evans R. D. and Johansen J. R. 1999. Microbiotic Crusts and Ecosystem Processes. Critical Reviews in Plant Sciences 18(2): 183-225.&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of total biological nitrogen fixation are ~ 49 Tg/year (27-99 Tg/year).&lt;ref name="Elbert, W. 2012"/&gt;

====Geophysical and geomorphological properties====
'''Soil stability'''

Soils in arid regions are slow-forming{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} and easily eroded. Crust organisms contribute to increased soil stability where they occur. Cyanobacteria have filamentous growth forms that bind soil particles together, and hyphae of fungi and [[rhizine]]s/[[rhizoid]]s of lichens and mosses also have similar effects. The increased surface roughness of crusted areas compared to bare soil further improves resistance to wind and water [[erosion]]. Aggregates of soil formed by crust organisms also increase soil aeration and provide surfaces where nutrient transformation can occur.&lt;ref name=WAYF&gt;Belnap, J. (2003). The world at your feet: desert biological soil crusts. Front. Ecol. Environ., 1&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|181–89}}

'''Soil water relations'''

The effect of biological soil crusts on [[water infiltration]] and [[soil moisture]] depends on the dominant crust organisms, soil characteristics, and climate. In areas where biological soil crusts produce rough surface microtopography, water is detained longer on the soil surface and this increases water infiltration. However, in warm deserts where biological soil crusts are smooth and flat, infiltration rates can be decreased by [[bioclogging]].&lt;ref name=BSCEM/&gt;

'''Albedo'''

The darkened surfaces of biological soil crusts decreases soil [[albedo]] (a measure of the amount of light reflected off of the surface) compared to nearby soils, which increases the energy absorbed by the soil surface. Soils with well-developed biological soil crusts can be over 12&amp;nbsp;°C (22&amp;nbsp;°F) warmer than adjacent surfaces. Increased soil temperatures are associated with increased metabolic processes such as photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation, as well as higher soil water evaporation rates and delayed seedling germination and establishment.&lt;ref name=BSCEM/&gt; The activity levels of many arthropods and small mammals are also controlled by soil surface temperature.&lt;ref name=WAYF/&gt;

'''Dust-trapping'''

The increased surface roughness associated with biological soil crusts increase the capture of [[dust]]. These [[Aeolian processes|Aeolian]] deposits of dust are often enriched in [[plant-essential nutrients]], and thus increase both the fertility and the [[water holding capacity]] of soils.&lt;ref name=WAYF/&gt;

===Role in the biological community===
====Effects on vascular plants====
'''Germination and establishment'''

The presence of biological soil crust cover can differentially inhibit or facilitate plant seed catchment and [[germination]]. The increased micro-topography generally increases the probability that plant seeds will be caught on the soil surface and not blown away. Differences in water infiltration and soil moisture also contribute to differential germination depending on the plant species. It has been shown that while some native desert plant species have seeds with self-burial mechanisms can establish readily in crusted areas, many exotic invasive plants do not. Therefore, the presence of biological soil crusts may slow the establishment of [[invasive plant species]] such as cheatgrass (''[[Bromus tectorum]]'').&lt;ref&gt;L. Deines, R. Rosentreter, D.J. Eldridge, M.D. Serpe. Germination and seedling establishment of two annual grasses on lichen-dominated biological soil crusts. Plant Soil, 295 (2007), pp. 23–35&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nutrient levels'''

Biological soil crusts do not compete with vascular plants for nutrients, but rather have been shown to increase nutrient levels in plant tissues, which results in higher [[biomass]] for plants that grow near biological soil crusts. This can occur through N fixation by cyanobacteria in the crusts, increased trapment of nutrient-rich dust, as well as increased concentrations of [[micronutrients]] that are able to [[chelate]] to the negatively charged clay particles bound by cynaobacterial filaments.&lt;ref name=WAYF/&gt;

====Effects on animals====
The increased nutrient status of plant tissue in areas where biological soil crusts occur can directly benefit [[herbivore]] species in the community. [[Microarthropod]] populations also increase with more developed crusts due to increased microhabitats produced by the crust microtopography.&lt;ref name=BSCEM/&gt;

==Human impacts and management==
===Human disturbance===
Biological soil crusts are extremely susceptible to disturbance from human activities. Compressional and shear forces can disrupt biological soil crusts especially when they are dry, leaving them to be blown or washed away. Thus, animal hoof impact, human footsteps, [[off-road vehicles]], and tank treads can remove crusts and these disturbances have occurred over large areas globally. Once biological soil crusts are disrupted, wind and water can move sediments onto adjacent intact crusts, burying them and preventing photosynthesis of non-motile organisms such as mosses, lichens, green algae, and small cyanobacteria, and of motile cyanobacteria when the soil remains dry. This kills remaining intact crust and causes large areas of loss.

Invasive species introduced by humans can also affect biological soil crusts. Invasive annual grasses can occupy areas once occupied by crusts and allow fire to travel between large plants, whereas previously it would have just jumped from plant to plant and not directly affected the crusts.&lt;ref name=WAYF/&gt;

[[Climate change]] affects biological soil crusts by altering the timing and magnitude of [[precipitation]] events and [[temperature]]. Because crusts are only active when wet, some of these new conditions may reduce the amount of time when conditions are favorable for activity.&lt;ref name="Ferrenberg et al 2015"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281754117_Climate_change_and_physical_disturbance_cause_similar_community_shifts_in_biological_soil_crusts |title=Climate change and physical disturbance cause similar community shifts in biological soil crusts|first1=Scott |last1=Ferrenberg |first2=Sasha C. |last2=Reed |first3=Jayne |last3=Belnap |date= September 2015 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |doi= 10.1073/pnas.1509150112 |accessdate=7 November 2018 |volume=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biological soil crusts require stored carbon when reactivating after being dry. If they do not have enough moisture to photosynthesize to make up for the carbon used, they can gradually deplete carbon stocks and die.&lt;ref name="belnap et al 2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Belnap | first1 = J | last2 = Phillips | first2 = SL | last3 = Miller | first3 = ME | year = 2004 | title = Response of desert biological soil crusts to alteration in precipitation frequency | url = | journal = Oecologia | volume =  141| issue = 2| pages =  306–316| doi = 10.1007/s00442-003-1438-6 | pmid = 14689292 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reduced carbon fixation also leads to decreased nitrogen fixation rates because crust organisms do not have sufficient energy for this energy-intensive process. Without carbon and nitrogen available, they are not able to grow nor repair damaged cells from excess radiation.

===Conservation and management===
Removal of stressors such as [[grazing]] or protection from disturbance are the easiest ways to maintain and improve biological soil crusts. Protection of relic sites that have not been disturbed can serve as reference conditions for restoration.
There are several successful methods for stabilizing soil to allow recolonization of crusts including coarse litter application (such as straw) and planting vascular plants, but these are costly and labor-intensive techniques. Spraying [[polyacrylamide]] gel has been tried but this has adversely affected photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation of ''[[Collema]]'' species and thus is less useful. Other methods such as fertilization and inoculation with material from adjacent sites may enhance crust recovery, but more research is needed to determine the local costs of disturbance.&lt;ref&gt;Bowker, M.

In [[marketing]], '''brand implementation''' refers to the physical representation and consistent application of [[brand identity]] across [[Visual brand language|visual]] and [[Brand language|verbal]] media. In visual terms, this can include [[signage]], [[uniforms]], [[Livery|liveries]], interior design and branded merchandise. Brand implementation encompasses facets of [[architecture]], [[product design]], [[industrial design]], [[quantity surveying]], [[engineering]], [[procurement]], [[project management]] and [[retail design]].

Brand implementation is an integrated part of a branding cycle and needs to be initiated during the brand design and development phase. Brand implementation is the continuous and consistent application of the [[brand]]'s image in all business units, communication channels and media.

This refers to marketing and branding as a unified whole. In that respect, brand implementation is a continuous process, which requires controlling the brand's image and presence despite changes in markets and company structure.&lt;ref&gt;Misof, Guenther (2007). „Brand Implementation. Managing and Controlling Brand Identity“, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Brand implementation emerged as a discipline in the 1990s when brand owners recognized the need for consistency across branded estates. Traditionally, brand implementation was handled by various parties, including shop-fitters, interior designers and sign companies. Lack of centralized project management led to inconsistencies, while information dissymmetry meant suppliers had too much control over brand issues. Brand implementation was consequently coined as an umbrella term for all aspects of the application and maintenance of physical brand assets.

==Key problem fields==
The experience of more than 80 companies operating worldwide shows that a lack of planning before the rebrand,&lt;ref&gt;Brand Implementation: TBC, Tony Lorenz, 2012 {{cite web|url=http://www.endpoint.co.uk/implementation-tbc/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202222529/http://www.endpoint.co.uk/implementation-tbc/ |archivedate=2013-12-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; consistent implementation and complete control are the key problems of brand implementation. Eight large stumbling blocks  stand in the way of effective implementation: 
* Inadequate communication 
* No situation and needs analysis
* Lack of consequence
* Undefined processes
* Fragmented (organizational) structures.&lt;ref&gt;Study in more than 80 companies operating worldwide. Brand Implementation Group, 2006-2011&lt;/ref&gt;

* No localisation strategy&lt;ref&gt;Localisation of your brand: Why it's important to get it right, Paul Veness, 2012 http://www.endpoint.co.uk/localisation-of-your-global-brand-why-its-important-to-get-it-right/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Magic and Logic==
Brand implementation does not involve the design or creation of brand identity; brand implementation agencies work closely with [[Branding agency|branding agencies]] to ensure that their work is applied accurately and consistently. This relationship is referred to as Magic and Logic (RTM of Marketing Supply Chain International). Branding agencies look after the Magic (creative) and brand implementation agencies look after the Logic (implementation).

'''Broadcast-safe''' video ('''broadcast legal''' or '''legal signal''') is a term used in the [[broadcast]] industry to define [[video]] and [[content (media and publishing)|audio]] compliant with the technical or regulatory broadcast requirements of the target area or region the feed might be broadcasting to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://livedocs.adobe.com/en_US/AfterEffects/8.0/help.html?content=WSE0A9B424-9673-4fd0-BED7-2ED4E1EB1E8D.html|title=Learn|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) is the regulatory authority; in most of Europe, standards are set by the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU).

=== Broadcast safe High Definition video ===

Digital broadcasting is very different from analog.  The NTSC and PAL standards describe both transmission of the signal and how the electrical signal is converted into an image.  In digital, there is a separation between the subject of how data is to be transmitted from tower to TV, and the subject of what content that data might contain.  While data transmission is likely to be a fixed and consistent affair, the content could vary from High Definition video one hour, to SD multicasting the next, and even to non-video datacasting.  In the US, [[8VSB]] transmits the data, while [[MPEG-2]] encodes pictures and sound.

==Broadcast safe audio==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

Broadcast engineers in [[North America]] usually line up their audio gear to nominal reference level of 0&amp;nbsp;dB on a [[VU meter]] aligned to +4dBu or -20dBFs, in [[Europe]] equating to roughly +4 dBm or -18 [[dBFS]]. Peak signal levels must not exceed the nominal level by more than +10&amp;nbsp;dB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.shure.com/shure-notes/shure-tech-tip-vu-and-ppm-audio-meters-an-elementary-explanation/|title=Shure Tech Tip: VU and PPM Audio Meters – An Elementary Explanation|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadcast audio as a rule must be as free as possible of [[Gaussian noise]], that is to say, it must be as close to the [[noise floor]], as is reasonably possible, considering the storage or transmission medium.

Broadcast audio must have a good [[signal-to-noise ratio]], where speech or music is a bare minimum of 16db above the noise of the recording or transmission system. For audio that has a much poorer signal-to-noise ratio (like [[cockpit voice recorder]]s), sonic enhancement is recommended.

==Non-Standard Video==
Although almost any video gear can create problems when broadcast, equipment aimed at consumers sometimes produces video signals which are not broadcast safe. Usually this is to reduce the cost of the gear, since a non-standard video signal in the home might not create the problems that one might find in a broadcast facility.
Potential flaws exist with:

* '''VHS and 8&amp;nbsp;mm:''' Consumer devices generally lack [[time base correction]] that may cause problems with [[genlock]] and sync with some analogue and digital broadcast equipment. Consumer analogue video systems have greater system noise and lower chrominance and luminance than is normal for standard definition TV. As a general broadcast engineering rule all analogue videotape origin material should be genlocked before transmission, but this is not mandatory or necessary for all conditions. All analogue videotape by default is broadcast safe under normal playing conditions.
* '''Older videogame systems:''' Video game consoles before the [[History of video game consoles (sixth generation)|sixth generation]] and 8-bit [[home computer]]s generated a video signal lacking the half scan line needed to make [[interlaced video|interlace]] happen. This subtle simplification caused NTSC sets to scan 240p/60 instead of [[480i60]], with similar results for [[PAL]]. While this actually improved picture quality for the kind of [[Low-definition television|low-definition images]] that videogames of this era generated, such a signal modification could cause problems in a broadcast environment as the signal behaviour is outside the original television system specifications. Genlocking—but not timebase correction—are the recommended broadcast engineering solutions.
* '''Computer video signals:''' Computer video can be set up to run at many different frame or field rates, ranging 50 frame/s to more than 240 frame/s. Computer video is generally progressive by default, but many interlaced modes exist. A [[scan converter]] is typically needed to convert these signals to one of the many acceptable broadcast standards, such as 59.97&amp;nbsp;Hz or 50&amp;nbsp;Hz.  This type of conversion typically degrades the quality of the broadcast image, usually resulting with either "motion artifacts" or a lower resolution. It is recommended that the display rate be set to equal the target television rate if possible.

== In digital television only environments ==
In nations that have fully converted to digital television, broadcast safe analogue television takes on a slightly different meaning. All broadcasting systems will have been mostly converted to digital only outputs, leaving fewer entry points for analogue television signals.

What this means is that all devices that feed to the television transmitter must take in and feed standard analogue television signals into the transmission chain. Mostly it is up to the switcher to notify if there is non-broadcast safe video to the programmer. However, due to the limitations of many switchers for DTV and HDTV it ultimately is up to the automation systems to alert the programmer of non-broadcast safe video inputs.

As a matter of broadcast engineering practice, 4:3 analogue television signals will always pose the most problems with broadcast safe compliance. The use of portable and cheap timebase-genlock systems for analogue television inputs in the digital television studio will be clearly mandatory for the next 50 years.{{OR|date=November 2013}}

{{Buddhism}}
'''Buddhist art''' is the [[art|artistic practices]] that are influenced by [[Buddhism]]. It includes art media which depict [[Buddha]]s, [[bodhisattva]]s, and other entities; notable Buddhist figures, both historical and mythical; narrative scenes from the lives of all of these; [[mandala]]s and other graphic aids to practice; as well as physical objects associated with Buddhist practice, such as [[vajra]]s, bells, [[stupa]]s and [[Buddhist architecture|Buddhist temple architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What is Buddhist Art? |url=http://buddhistartnews.wordpress.com/what-is-buddhist-art/ |publisher=Buddhist Art News |accessdate=2014-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhist art originated on the [[Indian subcontinent]] following the historical life of [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhartha Gautama]], 6th to 5th century BCE, and thereafter evolved by contact with other cultures as it spread throughout Asia and the world.

Buddhist art followed believers as the dharma spread, adapted, and evolved in each new host country. It developed to the north through [[Central Asia]] and into [[Eastern Asia]] to form the Northern branch of Buddhist art, and to the east as far as [[Southeast Asia]] to form the Southern branch of Buddhist art. In India, Buddhist art flourished and co-developed with [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Jainism|Jain]] art, with cave temple complexes built together, each likely influencing the other.&lt;ref name=blurton113&gt;T. Richard Blurton (1994), Hindu Art, Harvard University Press, {{ISBN|978-0674391895}}, pages 113-116, 160-162, 191-192&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-iconic phase (5th century – 1st century BCE)==
{{See also|Aniconism in Buddhism}}
[[File:Buddha-Footprint.jpeg|thumb|upright|right|Footprint of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. 1st century BCE, [[Gandhara]].]]
During the 2nd to 1st century BCE, sculptures became more explicit, representing episodes of the Buddha’s life and teachings. These took the form of votive tablets or [[frieze]]s, usually in relation to the decoration of stupas.
Although India had a long sculptural tradition and a mastery of rich iconography, the Buddha was never represented in human form, but only through [[Buddhist symbolism]]. This period may have been [[aniconism in Buddhism|aniconic]].

Artists were reluctant to depict the Buddha anthropomorphically, and developed sophisticated aniconic symbols to avoid doing so (even in narrative scenes where other human figures would appear). This tendency remained as late as the 2nd century CE in the southern parts of India, in the art of the [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district#Amaravati School|Amaravati School]] (see: [[Mara (demon)|Mara's assault on the Buddha]]).
It has been argued that earlier anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha may have been made of wood and may have perished since then. However, no related archaeological evidence has been found.

The earliest works of Buddhist art in India date back to the 1st century BCE The
[[Mahabodhi Temple]] at Bodh Gaya became a model for similar structures in Burma
and Indonesia. The frescoes at [[Sigiriya]] are said to be even older than the
[[Ajanta Caves]] paintings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frontline.in/archives.htm Buddhist Art ]  Frontline Magazine 13–26 May 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconic phase (1st century CE – present)==
{{see also|Greco-Buddhist art|Mathura art}}
[[File:Bodhisattva Padmapani, cave 1, Ajanta, India.jpg|thumb|left|Over life-size figure of the [[bodhisattva]] [[Padmapani]], cave 1, [[Ajanta Caves]], 5th century]]
Anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha started to emerge from the 1st century CE in [[Northern India]]. The two main centers of creation have been identified as [[Gandhara]] in today’s [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|North West Frontier Province]], in [[Pakistan]], and the region of [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]], in central northern India.

Hellenistic culture was introduced in Gandhara during the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] in 332&amp;nbsp;BCE. [[Chandragupta Maurya]] (reign: 321–298 BCE), founder of the [[Mauryan Empire]], conquered the Macedonian satraps during the [[Seleucid-Mauryan War]] of 305–303 BCE. Chandragupta's grandson [[Ashoka]] (reign: 268-232 BCE), who formed the largest Empire in the Indian subcontinent, converted to Buddhism following the [[Kalinga War]]. Abandoning an expansionist ideology, Ashoka worked to spread the religion and philosophy throughout his empire as described in the [[edicts of Ashoka]]. Ashoka claims to have converted the Greek populations within his realm to Buddhism:
{{quote|Here in the king's domain among the Greeks, the [[Kambojas]], the Nabhakas, the Nabhapamkits, the Bhojas, the Pitinikas, the Andhras and the Palidas, everywhere people are following Beloved-of-the-Gods' instructions in [[Dharma]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Edicts of Ashoka|Rock Edict Nb13]]'' (S. Dhammika)&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

After the overthrow of the Mauryan Empire by the [[Shunga Empire]], the  [[Greco-Bactrian]] and subsequently the [[Indo-Greek]] Kingdoms invaded north-western India. They facilitated the spread of Greco-Buddhist art style to other parts of the subcontinent. The Indo-Greek King [[Menander I]] was renown as a great patron of Buddhism, attaining the title of an [[arhat]].&lt;ref&gt;"(In the Milindapanha) Menander is declared an arhat", McEvilley, p. 378.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile [[Pushyamitra Shunga]] persecuted Buddhism, presumably to further erase the legacy of the Mauryan Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Simmons, Caleb; Sarao, K. T. S. (2010). "Pushyamitra Sunga, a Hindu ruler in the second century BCE, was a great persecutor of Buddhists". In Danver, Steven L. Popular Controversies in World History. ABC-CLIO. p. 89. {{ISBN|9781598840780}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the decline of Buddhist art east of Mathura.

Gandharan Buddhist sculpture displays [[Hellenistic influence on Indian art|Hellenistic artistic influence]] in the forms of human figures and ornament. Figures were much larger than any known from India previously, and also more naturalistic, and new details included wavy hair, drapery covering both shoulders, shoes and sandals, and [[acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]] leaf ornament.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}
[[File:Inscribed Seated Buddha Image in Abhaya Mudra - Kushan Period - Katra Keshav Dev - ACCN A-1 - Government Museum - Mathura 2013-02-24 5972.JPG|thumb|Mathura school Buddha, [[Kushan Empire|Kushan period]]]]

The art of Mathura tends to be based on an Indian tradition, exemplified by the anthropomorphic representation of divinities such as the [[Yaksha|Yaksas]], although in a style rather archaic compared to the later representations of the Buddha. The Mathuran school contributed clothes covering the left shoulder of thin [[muslin]], the wheel on the palm, the lotus seat.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Mathura and Gandhara also influenced each other. During their artistic florescence, the two regions were even united politically under the [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]], both being capitals of the empire. It is still a matter of debate whether the anthropomorphic representations of Buddha was essentially a result of a local evolution of Buddhist art at Mathura, or a consequence of Greek cultural influence in Gandhara through the [[Greco-Buddhism|Greco-Buddhist]] [[syncretism]].

This iconic art was characterized from the start by a realistic idealism, combining realistic human features, proportions, attitudes and attributes, together with a sense of perfection and serenity reaching to the divine. This expression of the Buddha as both man and God became the iconographic canon for subsequent Buddhist art.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Remains of early Buddhist painting in India are vanishingly rare, with the later phases of the [[Ajanta Caves]] giving the great majority of surviving work, created over a relatively short up to about 480 CE.  These are highly sophisticated works, evidently produced in a well-developed tradition, probably painting secular work in palaces as much as religious subjects.

Buddhist art continued to develop in India for a few more centuries. The pink [[sandstone]] sculptures of Mathura evolved during the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] period (4th to 6th century CE) to reach a very high fineness of execution and delicacy in the modeling. The art of the Gupta school was extremely influential almost everywhere in the rest of Asia. At the end of the 12th century CE, Buddhism in its full glory came to be preserved only in the Himalayan regions in India. These areas, helped by their location, were in greater contact with Tibet and China - for example the art and traditions of [[Ladakh]] bear the stamp of Tibetan and Chinese influence.
[[File:Buddhist Expansion.svg|thumb|right|240px|Buddhist expansion throughout Asia.]]
As Buddhism expanded outside of India from the 1st century CE, its original artistic package blended with other artistic influences, leading to a progressive differentiation among the countries adopting the faith.
* A '''Northern route''' was established from the 1st century CE through [[Central Asia]], [[Nepal]], [[Tibet]], [[Bhutan]], [[China]], [[Korea]], [[Japan]] and [[Vietnam]], in which [[Mahayana]] Buddhism prevailed.
* A '''Southern route''', where [[Theravada]] Buddhism dominated, went through [[Myanmar]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Thailand]], [[Cambodia]], and [[Laos]].

==Northern Buddhist art==
[[File:Wood Bodhisattva.jpg|left|thumb|A Chinese wooden [[Bodhisattva]] from the [[Song Dynasty]] (960-1279 CE)]]

The [[Silk Road transmission of Buddhism]] to Central Asia, China and ultimately Korea and Japan started in the 1st century CE with a semi-legendary account of an embassy sent to the West by the Chinese Emperor [[Emperor Ming of Han China|Ming]] (58-75&amp;nbsp;AD). However, extensive contacts started in the 2nd century CE, probably as a consequence of the expansion of the [[Kushan Empire]] into the Chinese territory of the [[Tarim Basin]], with the missionary efforts of a great number of Central Asian Buddhist monks to Chinese lands. The first missionaries and translators of Buddhists scriptures into [[Chinese language|Chinese]], such as [[Lokaksema (Buddhist monk)|Lokaksema]], were either [[Parthia]]n, [[Kushan]], [[Sogdiana|Sogdian]] or [[Kuchean]].

Central Asian missionary efforts along the [[Silk Road]] were accompanied by a flux of artistic influences, visible in the development of [[Serindian art]] from the 2nd through the 11th century in the Tarim Basin, modern [[Xinjiang]]. Serindian art often derives from the [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of the [[Gandhara]] district of what is now [[Pakistan]], combining Indian, Greek and [[Roman art|Roman]] influences. Silk Road Greco-Buddhist artistic influences can be found as far as Japan to this day, in architectural motifs, Buddhist imagery, and a select few representations of [[Kami|Japanese gods]].

The art of the northern route was also highly influenced by the development of [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] Buddhism, an inclusive branch of Buddhism characterized by the adoption of new texts, in addition to the traditional [[Āgama (Buddhism)|āgamas]], and a shift in the understanding of Buddhism. Mahāyāna goes beyond the traditional [[Early Buddhist schools|Early Buddhist]] ideal of the release from suffering ([[dukkha|duḥkha]]) of [[arhat]]s, and emphasizes the [[bodhisattva]] path. The Mahāyāna sutras elevate the Buddha to a transcendent and infinite being, and feature a pantheon of bodhisattvas devoting themselves to the [[Paramita|Six Perfections]], ultimate knowledge ([[Prajnaparamita|Prajñāpāramitā]]), enlightenment, and the liberation of all sentient beings. Northern Buddhist art thus tends to be characterized by a very rich and syncretic Buddhist pantheon, with a multitude of images of the various [[Buddhahood|buddhas]], bodhisattvas, and heavenly beings ([[deva (Buddhism)|devas]]).

===Afghanistan===
[[File:GBA1(trimmed).jpg|thumb|upright|Statue from a Buddhist monastery, 700&amp;nbsp;AD, Afghanistan]]
Buddhist art in [[Afghanistan]] (old [[Bactria]]) persisted for several centuries until the spread of Islam in the 7th century. It is exemplified by the [[Buddhas of Bamyan]]. Other sculptures, in [[stucco]], [[schist]] or [[clay]], display very strong blending of Indian post-[[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] mannerism and Classical influence, [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] or possibly even [[Greco-Roman]].

Although Islamic rule was somewhat tolerant of other religions "[[People of the Book|of the Book]]", it showed little tolerance for Buddhism, which was perceived as a religion depending on "[[idolatry]]". Human figurative art forms also being prohibited under Islam, Buddhist art suffered numerous attacks, which culminated with the systematic destructions by the [[Taliban]] regime. The Buddhas of Bamyan, the sculptures of [[Hadda, Afghanistan|Hadda]], and many of the remaining artifacts at the Afghanistan museum have been destroyed.

The multiple conflicts since the 1980s also have led to a systematic pillage of archaeological sites apparently in the hope of reselling in the international market what artifacts could be found.

===Central Asia===
{{See also|Dunhuang|Mogao Caves|Kingdom of Khotan|Silk Road|Silk Road transmission of Buddhism}}
[[File:SerindianGroup.jpg|thumb|left|[[Serindian art]], 6th-7th century [[Terra cotta|terracotta]], Tumshuq (Xinjiang).]]
[[Central Asia]] long played the role of a meeting place between China, India and [[Iran|Persia]]. During the 2nd century BCE, the expansion of the [[Han Dynasty|Former Han]] to the West led to increased contact with the Hellenistic civilizations of Asia, especially the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]].

Thereafter, the expansion of Buddhism to the North led to the formation of Buddhist communities and even Buddhist kingdoms in the oasis of Central Asia. Some [[Silk Road]] cities consisted almost entirely of Buddhist stupas and monasteries, and it seems that one of their main objectives was to welcome and service travelers between East and West.

The eastern part of Central Asia  ([[Chinese Turkestan]] ([[Tarim Basin]], [[Xinjiang]]) in particular has revealed an extremely rich [[Serindian art]] ([[cave painting|wall paintings]] and [[relief]]s in numerous caves, portable paintings on canvas, sculpture, ritual objects), displaying multiple influences from Indian and Hellenistic cultures. Works of art reminiscent of the Gandharan style, as well as scriptures in the Gandhari script [[Kharoshti]] have been found. These influences were rapidly absorbed however by the vigorous Chinese culture, and a strongly Chinese particularism develops from that point.

===China===
{{see also|Chinese Buddhist sculpture}}
Buddhism arrived in [[China]] around the 1st century CE, and introduced new types of art into China, particularly in the area of [[statue|statuary]]. Receiving this distant religion, strong Chinese traits were incorporated into Buddhist art.

====Northern Dynasties====
In the 5th to 6th centuries, the [[Northern Dynasties]] developed rather symbolic and abstract modes of representation, with schematic lines. Their style is also said to be solemn and majestic. The lack of corporeality of this art, and its distance from the original Buddhist objective of expressing the pure ideal of enlightenment in an accessible and realistic manner, progressively led to a change towards more naturalism and realism, leading to the expression of Tang Buddhist art.

Sites preserving Northern Wei Dynasty Buddhist sculpture:
*[[Yungang Grottoes]], [[Shanxi]]
*[[Longmen Grottoes]], [[Henan]]
*[[Bingling Temple]], [[Gansu]]

====Tang Dynasty====
[[File:Tejaprabhā Buddha and the Five Planets by Chang Huai-hsing.jpg|thumb|right|''{{ill|Tejaprabhā Buddha and the Five Planets|yue|熾盛光佛並五星圖}}'', 897 A.D.]]
Following a transition under the [[Sui Dynasty]], Buddhist sculpture of the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] evolved towards a markedly lifelike expression. Because of the dynasty's openness to foreign influences, and renewed exchanges with Indian culture due to the numerous travels of Chinese Buddhist monks to India, Tang dynasty Buddhist sculpture assumed a rather classical form, inspired by the Indian art of the Gupta period. During that time, the Tang capital of [[Chang'an]] (today's [[Xi'an]]) became an important center for Buddhism. From there Buddhism spread to [[Korea]], and [[Japanese missions to Tang China]] helped it gain a foothold in Japan.

However, foreign influences came to be negatively perceived in China towards the end of the Tang dynasty. In the year 845, the Tang emperor [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang China|Wuzong]] outlawed all "foreign" religions (including Christian [[Nestorianism]], [[Zoroastrianism]] and [[Buddhism]]) in order to support the indigenous religion, [[Taoism]]. He confiscated Buddhist possessions, and forced the faith to go underground, therefore affecting the development of the religion and its arts in China.

[[Chán]] Buddhism however, as the origin of Japanese [[Zen]], continued to prosper for some centuries, especially under the [[Song Dynasty]] (960-1279), when Chan monasteries were great centers of culture and learning.

[[File:Chinesischer Maler von 1238 001.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait of the Chinese [[Zen]] Buddhist [[Wuzhun Shifan]], painted in 1238&amp;nbsp;AD, [[Song Dynasty]].]]

Early paintings by Chán monks tended to eschew the meticulous realism of [[Gongbi]] painting in favour of vigorous, monochrome paintings, attempting to express the impact of enlightenment through their brushwork.&lt;ref&gt;Cotterell, A; ''The imperial capitals of China: an inside view of the celestial empire'', Random House 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-84595-010-1}} p179&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of [[Neo-Confucianism]] under [[Zhu Xi]] in the twelfth century resulted in considerable criticism of the monk-painters. Connected as they were with the then-unpopular school of Chan Buddhism, their paintings were discarded and ignored. Some paintings survived after being transported to Japan by visiting Zen monks, but the school of Chan painting gradually diminished.&lt;ref&gt;Ortiz, Valérie Malenfer; ''Dreaming the southern song landscape: the power of illusion in Chinese painting'', BRILL 1999, {{ISBN|978-90-04-11011-3}} p161-2&lt;/ref&gt;

====Qing Dynasty====
During the Qing Dynasty, Manchu emperors supported Buddhist practices for a range of political and personal reasons. The [[Shunzhi Emperor]] was a devotee of Chan Buddhism, while his successor, the [[Kangxi Emperor]] promoted [[Tibetan Buddhism]], claiming to be the human embodiment of the bodhisattva [[Manjusri]].&lt;ref&gt;Weidner, Marsha Smith, and Patricia Ann Berger. Latter Days of the Law : Images of Chinese Buddhism, 850-1850. Lawrence, KS: Spencer Museum of Art, University of Kansas, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was under the rule of the third Qing ruler, the [[Qianlong Emperor]], that imperial patronage of the Buddhist arts reached its height in this period. He commissioned a vast number of religious works in the Tibetan style, many of which depicted him in various sacred guises.&lt;ref&gt;Berger 1994, pg.113&lt;/ref&gt;

Works of art produced during this period are characterized by a unique fusion of Tibetan and Chinese artistic approaches. They combine a characteristically Tibetan attention to iconographic detail with Chinese-inspired decorative elements. Inscriptions are often written in Chinese, Manchu, Tibetan, Mongolian and Sanskrit, while paintings are frequently rendered in vibrant colors.&lt;ref&gt;Berger 1994, pg.114-118&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Vairochana the Cosmic Buddha 720p.webm|thumb|Vairochana the Cosmic Buddha 720p]]
Additionally, the [[Qianlong Emperor]] initiated a number of large-scale construction projects; in 1744 he rededicated the [[Yonghe Temple]] as Beijing's main Tibetan Buddhist monastery, donating a number of valuable religious paintings, sculptures, textiles and inscriptions to the temple.&lt;ref&gt;Berger 1994, pg.114&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Xumi Fushou Temple]], and the works housed within, is another project commissioned by the [[Qianlong Emperor]] that embodies the unique blend of Tibetan and Manchu artistic styles that characterized Buddhist art produced in China under Qianlong's reign.

After the [[Qianlong Emperor]]'s abdication in 1795, the popularity of Tibetan Buddhism at the Qing court declined. The motives behind the Qing emperors' promotion of Tibetan Buddhism have been interpreted as a calculated act of political manipulation, and a means of forging ties between Manchu, Mongolian, and Tibetan communities, though this has been challenged by recent scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Patricia Ann. Empire of Emptiness : Buddhist Art and Political Authority In Qing China. Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legacy====
[[File:Gathering of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas 720p.webm|thumb|Gathering of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas 720p]]
The popularization of Buddhism in China has made the country home to one of the richest collections of Buddhist arts in the world. The [[Mogao Caves]] near [[Dunhuang]] and the [[Bingling Temple]] caves near [[Yongjing County|Yongjing]] in [[Gansu]] province, the [[Longmen Grottoes]] near [[Luoyang]] in [[Henan]] province, the [[Yungang Grottoes]] near [[Datong]] in [[Shanxi]] province, and the [[Dazu Rock Carvings]] near [[Chongqing]] municipality are among the most important and renowned Buddhist sculptural sites. The [[Leshan Giant Buddha]], carved out of a hillside in the 8th century during the [[Tang Dynasty]] and looking down on the confluence of three rivers, is still the largest stone Buddha statue in the world.

===Korea===
{{see also|Buddhism in Korea|Korean Buddhist sculpture|Korean art}}
[[Korea]]n Buddhist art generally reflects an interaction between other Buddhist influences and a strongly original Korean culture. Additionally, the art of the steppes, particularly Siberian and [[Scythia]]n influences, are evident in early Korean Buddhist art based on the excavation of artifacts and burial goods such as [[Silla]] [[Crown of Silla|royal crowns]], belt buckles, daggers, and comma-shaped [[gogok]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/explore/Korea/koreaonline/crown.htm |title=Crown |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |work=Arts of Korea |accessdate=2007-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grayson (2002), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The style of this indigenous art was geometric, abstract and richly adorned with a {{clarify span|characteristic "barbarian" luxury|date=November 2012}}. Although many other influences were strong, Korean Buddhist art, "bespeaks a sobriety, taste for the right tone, a sense of abstraction but also of colours that curiously enough are in line with contemporary taste" (Pierre Cambon, ''Arts asiatiques- Guimet''').

====Three Kingdoms of Korea====
[[File:Pensive Bodhisattva 02.jpg|upright|thumb|right|[[Gilt-bronze Maitreya in Meditation (National Treasure No. 83)|Bangasayusang]], semi-seated contemplative Maitreya probably from Silla circa early 7th century.]]
The first of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] to officially receive Buddhism was [[Goguryeo]] in 372.&lt;ref name=graysonp25&gt;Grayson (2002), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Chinese records and the use of Buddhist motifs in Goguryeo murals indicate the introduction of Buddhism earlier than the official date.&lt;ref&gt;Grayson (2002), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Baekje]] Kingdom officially recognized Buddhism in 384.&lt;ref name=graysonp25/&gt; The [[Silla]] Kingdom, isolated and with no easy sea or land access to China, officially adopted Buddhism in 535 although the foreign religion was known in the kingdom due to the work of Goguryeo monks since the early 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=The Encyclopedia of World History: ancient, medieval, and modern, chronologically arranged |author1=Peter N.

Particularly important in the transmission of sophisticated art styles to the Korean kingdoms was the art of the "barbarian" Tuoba, a clan of non-Han Chinese Xianbei people who established the [[Northern Wei]] Dynasty in China in 386. The Northern Wei style was particularly influential in the art of the Goguryeo and Baekje. Baekje artisans later transmitted this style along with Southern Dynasty elements and distinct Korean elements to Japan.

While Goguryeo Buddhist art exhibited vitality and mobility akin with Northern Wei prototypes, the Baekje Kingdom was also in close contact with the [[Southern Dynasties]] of China and this close diplomatic contact is exemplified in the gentle and proportional sculpture of the Baekje, epitomized by Baekje sculpture exhibiting the fathomless smile known to art historians as the [[Baekje smile]].&lt;ref name="metmuseum"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/kobs/hd_kobs.htm |title=Korean Buddhist Sculpture (5th–9th century) &amp;#124; Thematic Essay &amp;#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &amp;#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=metmuseum.org |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Silla Kingdom also developed a distinctive Buddhist art tradition epitomized by the [[Gilt-bronze Maitreya in Meditation (National Treasure No. 83)|Bangasayusang]], a half-seated contemplative maitreya whose Korean-made twin, the Miroku Bosatsu, was sent to Japan as a proselytizing gift and now resides in the Koryu-ji Temple in Japan.&lt;ref name="kenyon"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Religion/Fac/Adler/Reln275/Jap-Kor-art.htm |title=Japanese Art and Its Korean Secret |publisher=www2.kenyon.edu |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhism in the Three Kingdoms period stimulated massive temple-building projects, such as the [[Mireuksa]] Temple in the Baekje Kingdom and the [[Hwangnyongsa]] Temple in Silla.

Particularly, the semi-seated Maitreya form was adapted into a highly developed Korean style which was transmitted to Japan as evidenced by the Koryu-ji Miroku Bosatsu and the Chugu-ji Siddhartha statues. Although many historians portray Korea as a mere transmitter of Buddhism, the Three Kingdoms, and particularly Baekje, were instrumental as active agents in the introduction and formation of a Buddhist tradition in Japan in 538 or 552.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book |title=Korea: A Religious History |author=Grayson, J.H. |date=2002 |publisher=RoutledgeCurzon |isbn=9780700716050 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e1BzL2lwPqEC |page=33 |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Unified Silla====
[[File:Goryeo Pagoda.jpg|thumb|160px|The Goryeo era [[Gyeongcheonsa Pagoda]] sits on the first floor of the [[National Museum of Korea]].]]
During the [[Unified Silla]] period, [[East Asia]] was particularly stable with China and Korea both enjoying unified governments. Early Unified Silla art combined Silla styles and Baekje styles. Korean Buddhist art was also influenced by new [[Tang Dynasty]] styles as evidenced by a new popular Buddhist motif with full-faced Buddha sculptures. Tang China was the cross roads of East, Central, and South Asia and so the Buddhist art of this time period exhibit the so-called international style. State-sponsored Buddhist art flourished during this period, the epitome of which is the [[Seokguram]] Grotto.

====Goryeo Dynasty====
The fall of the Unified Silla Dynasty and the establishment of the [[Goryeo]] Dynasty in 918 indicates a new period of Korean Buddhist art. The Goryeo kings also lavishly sponsored Buddhism and Buddhist art flourished, especially Buddhist paintings and illuminated sutras written in gold and silver ink. [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/07/eak/ht07eak.htm]. The crowning achievement of this period is the carving of approximately 80,000 woodblocks of the [[Tripitaka Koreana]] which was done twice.

====Joseon Dynasty====
The [[Joseon Dynasty]] actively suppressed Buddhism beginning in 1406 and Buddhist temples and art production subsequently decline in quality in quantity although beginning in 1549, Buddhist art does continue to be produced.

[[File:ASURA detail Kohfukuji.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The ASURA in [[Kōfuku-ji]], [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] (734)]]
Before the introduction of Buddhism, [[Japan]] had already been the seat of various cultural (and artistic) influences, from the abstract linear decorative art of the indigenous Neolithic [[Jōmon]] from around 10500&amp;nbsp;BC to 300&amp;nbsp;BC, to the art during the [[Yayoi]] and [[Kofun]] periods, with developments such as [[Haniwa]] art.

The cultural exchange between India and Japan was not direct, as Japan received Buddhism through Korea, China, Central Asia and eventually India. The Japanese discovered Buddhism in the 6th century when missionary monks travelled to the islands together with numerous scriptures and works of art. The cultural contact between Indian Dharmic civilization and Japan through the adoption of Buddhist ideas and aesthetic has contributed to the development of a national cultural order in the subsequent century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Indian Influence on the Art of Japan | author = Sampa Biswas | publisher = Northern Book Centre | year = 2010 | isbn = 9788172112691 | url = https://books.google.co.id/books?id=fLjcMfMGP10C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Buddhist+art+of+Japan&amp;hl=id&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwisg5jQrPrVAhWKMo8KHXxoBpEQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Buddhist%20art%20of%20Japan&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddhist religion was adopted by the state in the following century. Being geographically at the end of the [[Silk Road]], Japan was able to preserve many aspects of Buddhism at the very time it was disappearing in India, and being suppressed in Central Asia and China.

From 711, numerous temples and monasteries were built in the capital city of [[Nara, Nara|Nara]], including a five-story [[pagoda]], the Golden Hall of the Horyuji, and the [[Kōfuku-ji]] temple. Countless paintings and sculptures were made, often under governmental sponsorship. Indian, Hellenistic, Chinese and Korean artistic influences blended into an original style characterized by realism and gracefulness. The creation of Japanese Buddhist art was especially rich between the 8th and 13th centuries during the periods of [[Nara period|Nara]], [[Heian period|Heian]] and [[Kamakura period|Kamakura]].
Japan developed an extremely rich figurative art for the pantheon of Buddhist deities, sometimes combined with [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Shinto]] influences. This art can be very varied, creative and bold.

From the 12th and 13th, a further development was [[Zen]] art, and it faces golden days in [[Muromachi Period]], following the introduction of the faith by [[Dogen]] and [[Eisai]] upon their return from China. Zen art is mainly characterized by original paintings (such as [[sumi-e]]) and poetry (especially [[haiku]]s), striving to express the true essence of the world through impressionistic and unadorned "non-dualistic" representations. The search for enlightenment "in the moment" also led to the development of other important derivative arts such as the [[Chanoyu]] tea ceremony or the [[Ikebana]] art of flower arrangement. This evolution went as far as considering almost any human activity as an art with a strong spiritual and aesthetic content, first and foremost in those activities related to combat techniques ([[martial art]]s).

Buddhism remains very active in Japan to this day. Still around 80,000 Buddhist temples are preserved. Many of them are in wood and are regularly restored.

===Tibet and Bhutan===
{{See also|Bhutanese art|Tibetan art}}
[[File:Yama tibet.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Yama (Buddhism and Chinese mythology)|Yama]] 18th century, Tibet]]
[[Tantric Buddhism]] started as a movement in eastern India around the 5th or the 6th century. Many of the practices of Tantric Buddhism are derived from [[Vedic Brahmanism|Brahmanism]] (the usage of [[mantra]]s, [[yoga]], or the burning of sacrificial offerings). Tantrism became the dominant form of Buddhism in [[Tibet]] from the 8th century. Due to its geographical centrality in Asia, Tibetan Buddhist art received influence from Indian, [[Nepal]]i, Greco-Buddhist and Chinese art.

One of the most characteristic creations of Tibetan Buddhist art are the [[mandala]]s, diagrams of a "divine temple" made of a circle enclosing a square, the purpose of which is to help Buddhist devotees focus their attention through meditation and follow the path to the central image of the Buddha.
Artistically, Buddhist [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] art and Hindu art tend to be the two strongest inspirations of Tibetan art.

In 10th to 11th centuries, [[Tabo Monastery]] in [[Himachal Pradesh]], Northern India (at that time part of Western Tibet Kingdom) serves an important role as an intermediary between India and Tibet cultural exchange, especially Buddhist art and philosophy. Notable example of Tibetan Buddhist art in Tabo is its exquisite frescoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Tabo: a lamp for the kingdom : early Indo Tibetan Buddhist art in the western Himalaya, Archeologia, arte primitiva e orientale | author1 =Deborah E.

===Vietnam===
[[File:National Museum Vietnamese History 35 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|The boy Buddha rising up from lotus. Crimson and gilded wood, Trần-Hồ dynasty, Vietnam, 14th-15th century]]
Chinese influence was predominant in the north of [[Vietnam]] (Tonkin) between the 1st and 9th centuries, and [[Confucianism]] and Mahayana Buddhism were prevalent. Overall, the art of Vietnam has been strongly influenced by Chinese Buddhist art.

In the south thrived the former kingdom of [[Champa]] (before it was later overtaken by the Vietnamese from the north). [[Champa]] had a strongly Indianized art, just as neighboring [[Cambodia]]. Many of its statues were characterized by rich body adornments. The capital of the kingdom of Champa was annexed by Vietnam in 1471, and it totally collapsed in the 1720s, while [[Cham (Asia)|Cham people]] remain an abundant minority across [[Southeast Asia]].

==Southern Buddhist art==
The orthodox forms of Buddhism, also known as Southern Buddhism are still practised in Sri Lanka, Myanmar (Burma), Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia. During the 1st century CE, the trade on the overland Silk Road tended to be restricted by the rise of the [[Parthia]]n empire in the [[Middle East]], an unvanquished enemy of [[Roman Empire|Rome]], just as Romans were becoming extremely wealthy and their demand for Asian luxury was rising. This demand revived the sea connections between the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and China, with India as the intermediary of choice. From that time, through trade connections, commercial settlements, and even political interventions, India started to strongly influence [[Southeast Asia]]n countries. Trade routes linked India with southern [[Burma]], central and southern [[Thailand|Siam]], lower [[Cambodia]] and southern [[Vietnam]], and numerous urbanized coastal settlements were established there.

[[File:CambodianBuddha.JPG|thumb|upright|A Cambodian Buddha, 14th century]]
For more than a thousand years, Indian influence was therefore the major factor that brought a certain level of cultural unity to the various countries of the region. The [[Pāli|Pali]] and [[Sanskrit]] languages and the Indian script, together with [[Mahayana]] and [[Theravada]] Buddhism, [[Vedic Brahmanism|Brahmanism]] and [[Hinduism]], were transmitted from direct contact and through sacred texts and Indian literature such as the [[Ramayana]] and the [[Mahabharata]]. This expansion provided the artistic context for the development of Buddhist art in these countries, which then developed characteristics of their own.

Between the 1st and 8th centuries, several kingdoms competed for influence in the region (particularly the Cambodian [[Kingdom of Funan|Funan]] then the Burmese [[Mon (ethnic group)|Mon]] kingdoms) contributing various artistic characteristics, mainly derived from the Indian [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] style. Combined with a pervading Hindu influence, Buddhist images, votive tablets and Sanskrit inscriptions are found throughout the area. Between 8th- and 12th-century, under the patronage of [[Pala Empire|Pala dynasty]], arts and ideas of Buddhism and Hinduism co-developed and became increasingly intermeshed.&lt;ref name=richardblurton202/&gt; However, with Muslim invasion and sacking of monasteries in India, states Richard Blurton,  "Buddhism collapsed as a major force in India".&lt;ref name=richardblurton202&gt;T. Richard Blurton (1994), Hindu Art, Harvard University Press, {{ISBN|978-0674391895}}, pages 202-204, Quote: "Buddhism flourished in this part of India throughout the first millennium AD, especially under the patronage of Pala kings of the eighth and twelfth centuries. Towards the end of this period, popular Buddhism and Hinduism became increasingly intermeshed. However, when Muslim invaders from further west sacked the monasteries in the twelfth century, Buddhism collapsed as a major force in India."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Buddha Mendut.jpg|thumb|left|The statue of Dhyani Buddha [[Vairocana]], [[Avalokitesvara]], and [[Vajrapani]] inside the [[Mendut]] temple.]]

By the 8th to 9th century, [[Sailendra]]n Buddhist art were developed and flourished in [[Medang Kingdom|Medang Mataram]] kingdom of [[Central Java]], Indonesia. This period marked the renaissance of Buddhist art in Java, as numerous exquisite monuments were built, including [[Kalasan]], [[Sewu|Manjusrigrha]], [[Mendut]] and [[Borobudur]] stone mandala. The traditions would continue to the 13th century [[Singhasari]] Buddhist art of East Java.

From the 9th to the 13th centuries, Southeast Asia had very powerful empires and became extremely active in Buddhist architectural and artistic creation. The [[Sri Vijaya]] Empire to the south and the [[Khmer Empire]] to the north competed for influence, but both were adherents of Mahayana Buddhism, and their art expressed the rich Mahayana pantheon of the [[Bodhisattva]]s.
The [[Theravada]] Buddhism of the Pali canon was introduced to the region around the 13th century from [[Sri Lanka]], and was adopted by the newly founded [[Thai ethnic groups|ethnic Thai]] kingdom of [[Sukhothai kingdom|Sukhothai]]. Since in Theravada Buddhism of the period, Monasteries typically were the central places for the laity of the towns to receive instruction and have disputes arbitrated by the monks, the construction of temple complexes plays a particularly important role in the artistic expression of Southeast Asia from that time.

From the 14th century, the main factor was the spread of [[Islam]] to the maritime areas of Southeast Asia, overrunning [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], and most of the islands as far as the [[Southern Philippines]]. In the continental areas, Theravada Buddhism continued to expand into Burma, [[Laos]] and Cambodia.

===Sri Lanka===
[[File:Sri lanka aukana buddha statue.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Buddha statue in Sri Lanka.]]
According to tradition, Buddhism was introduced in Sri Lanka in the 3rd century BCE by Indian missionaries under the guidance of Thera [[Mahinda (Buddhist monk)|Mahinda]], the son of the Mauryan Emperor [[Ashoka]]. Prior to the expansion of Buddhism, the indigenous population of Sri Lanka lived in an animistic world full of superstition. The assimilation and conversion of the various pre-Buddhist beliefs was a slow process. In order to gain a foothold among the rural population, Buddhism needed to assimilate the various categories of spirits and other supernatural beliefs.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} The earliest monastic complex was the [[Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya|Mahāvihāra]] at [[Anuradhapura|Anurādhapura]] founded by [[Devanampiya Tissa of Anuradhapura|Devānampiyatissa]] and presented to Mahinda Thera. The Mahāvihāra became the centre of the orthodox Theravāda doctrine and its supreme position remained unchallenged until the foundation of the [[Abhayagiri Vihāra]] around BC 89 by [[Valagamba of Anuradhapura|Vaţţagāmaņĩ]].

The Abhayagiri Vihāra became the seat of the reformed Mahāyāna doctrines. The rivalry between the monks of the Mahāvihāra and the Abhayagiri led to a further split and the foundation of the [[Jetavanaramaya|Jetavanarama]] near the Mahāvihāra. The main feature of Sinhala Buddhism was its division into three major groups, or ''nikāyas'', named after the three main monastic complexes at Anurādhapura; the Mahāvihāra, the Abhayagiri, and the Jetavanārāma. This was the result in the deviations in the disciplinary rules ''(vinaya)'' and doctrinal disputes. All the other monasteries of Sri Lanka owed ecclesiastical allegiance to one of the three. Sri Lanka is famous for its creations of Buddhist sculptures made of stone and cast in bronze alloy.&lt;ref&gt;von Schroeder, Ulrich. 1990. ''Buddhist Sculptures of Sri Lanka''.

===Myanmar===
[[File:Buddha 00004.JPG|thumb|upright|A Mandalay-style statue of Buddha]]
A neighbor of India, [[Myanmar]] (Burma) was naturally strongly influenced by the eastern part of Indian territory. The [[Mon people|Mon]] of southern Burma are said to have been converted to Buddhism around 200&amp;nbsp;BC under the proselytizing of the Indian king [[Ashoka]], before the schism between [[Mahayana]] and [[Hinayana]] Buddhism.

Early Buddhist temples are found, such as Beikthano in central Myanmar, with dates between the 1st and the 5th centuries. The Buddhist art of the Mons was especially influenced by the Indian art of the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] and post-Gupta periods, and their mannerist style spread widely in Southeast Asia following the expansion of the Mon Empire between the 5th and 8th centuries.

Later, thousands of Buddhist temples were built at [[Bagan]], the capital, between the 11th and 13th centuries, and around 2,000 of them are still standing. Beautiful jeweled statues of the Buddha are remaining from that period. Creation managed to continue despite the seizure of the city by the [[Mongols]] in 1287.
[[File:Bodleian MS. Burm. a. 12 Life of the Buddha 15-18.jpg|thumbnail|left|Scenes from the life of the Buddha in an 18th-century Burmese watercolour]]
During the [[Ava Kingdom|Ava period]], from the 14th to 16th centuries, the Ava (Innwa) style of the Buddha image was popular. In this style, the Buddha has large protruding ears, exaggerated eyebrows that curve upward, half-closed eyes, thin lips and a hair bun that is pointed at the top, usually depicted in the bhumisparsa [[mudra]].&lt;ref name="niu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seasite.niu.edu/burmese/cooler/Chapter_4/Part1/post_pagan_period__part_1.htm |title=The Post Pagan Period - Part 1 |publisher=seasite.niu.edu |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Konbaung dynasty]], at the end of the 18th century, the Mandalay style of the Buddha image emerged, a style that remains popular to this day.&lt;ref name="niu2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seasite.niu.edu/burmese/cooler/Chapter_4/Part3/post_pagan_period__part_3.htm |title=The Post Pagan Period - Part 3 |publisher=seasite.niu.edu |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a marked departure from the Innwa style, and the Buddha's face is much more natural, fleshy, with naturally-slanted eyebrows, slightly slanted eyes, thicker lips, and a round hair bun at the top. Buddha images in this style can be found reclining, standing or sitting.&lt;ref name="buddhaartgallery"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buddhaartgallery.com/mandalay_buddha_statues.html |title=buddhaartgallery.com |publisher=buddhaartgallery.com |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandalay-style Buddhas wear flowing, draped robes.

Another common style of Buddha images is the Shan style, from the [[Shan people]], who inhabit the highlands of Myanmar. In this style, the Buddha is depicted with angular features, a large and prominently pointed nose, a hair bun tied similar to Thai styles, and a small, thin mouth.&lt;ref name="buddhaartgallery2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buddhaartgallery.com/shan_buddha_statues.html |title=buddhaartgallery.com |publisher=buddhaartgallery.com |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cambodia===
{{See|Khmer art|Khmer sculpture}}
[[File:Bodhisattva Lokesvara statue.jpg|thumb|upright|Bodhisattva [[Avalokitesvara|Lokesvara]], [[Cambodia]] 12th century.]]
[[Cambodia]] was the center of the [[Kingdom of Funan|Funan]] kingdom, which expanded into Burma and as far south as Malaysia between the 3rd and 6th centuries. Its influence seems to have been essentially political, most of the cultural influence coming directly from India.

Later, from the 9th to 13th centuries, the Mahayana Buddhist and Hindu [[Khmer Empire]] dominated vast parts of the Southeast Asian peninsula, and its influence was foremost in the development of Buddhist art in the region. Under the Khmer, more than 900 temples were built in Cambodia and in neighboring Thailand. The royal patronage for Khmer Buddhist art reached its new height with the patronage of [[Jayavarman VII]], a Buddhist king that built [[Angkor Thom]] walled city, adorned with the smiling face of [[Lokeshvara]] in Angkor Thom ''dvaras'' (gates) and ''prasat'' towers [[Bayon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Buddhist Monuments and Temples of Cambodia and Laos | author = W.

A great deal of Cambodian Buddhist sculpture is preserved at Angkor; however, organized looting has had a heavy impact on many sites around the country.

Often, Khmer art manages to express intense spirituality through divinely beaming expressions, in spite of spare features and slender lines.

===Thailand===

[[File:Wat Si Chum in Sukhothai.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Phra Atchana [[Wat Si Chum]], [[Sukhothai Province]], [[Thailand]]]]
The Thai Buddhist art encompasses period for more than a millennia, from pre Thai culture of Dvaravati and Srivijaya, to the first Thai capital of Thai 13th century Sukhothai, all the way to  succeeding Thai kingdoms of Ayutthaya and Rattanakosin.&lt;ref name="Thai Buddhist Art"&gt;{{cite book | title = Thai Buddhist Art: Discover Thai Art | author = Dawn F.

From the 1st to the 7th centuries, Buddhist art in [[Thailand]] was first influenced by direct contact with Indian traders and the expansion of the [[Mon (ethnic group)|Mon]] kingdom, leading to the creation of Hindu and Buddhist art inspired from the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] tradition, with numerous monumental statues of great virtuosity.

From the 9th century, the various schools of Thai art then became strongly influenced by Cambodian [[Khmer Empire|Khmer]] art in the north and [[Sri Vijaya]] art in the south, both of Mahayana faith. Up to the end of that period, Buddhist art is characterized by a clear fluidness in the expression, and the subject matter is characteristic of the [[Mahayana]] pantheon with multiple creations of [[Bodhisattva]]s.

From the 13th century, [[Theravada]] Buddhism was introduced from Sri Lanka around the same time as the [[Thai ethnic groups|ethnic Thai]] kingdom of [[Sukhothai kingdom|Sukhothai]] was established.&lt;ref name="Thai Buddhist Art"/&gt; The new faith inspired highly stylized images in Thai Buddhism, with sometimes very geometrical and almost abstract figures.

During the [[Ayutthaya kingdom|Ayutthaya]] period (14th-18th centuries), the Buddha came to be represented in a more stylistic manner with sumptuous garments and jeweled ornamentations. Many Thai sculptures or temples tended to be [[gilding|gilded]], and on occasion enriched with inlays.

The ensuing period of [[Thonburi Kingdom|Thonburi]] and [[Rattanakosin Kingdom]] saw the further development of Thai Buddhist art.&lt;ref name="Thai Buddhist Art"/&gt; By the 18th century, [[Bangkok]] was established as the royal center of the kingdom of [[Siam]]. Subsequently, the Thai rulers filled the city with imposing Buddhist monuments to demonstrate their Buddhist piety as well as to showcase their authority. Among others are the celebrated [[Wat Phra Kaew]] which hosts the [[Emerald Buddha]]. Other Buddhist temples in Bangkok includes [[Wat Arun]] with ''prang'' style towers, and [[Wat Pho]] with its famous image of [[Reclining Buddha]].

[[File:Borobudur-perfect-buddha.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A Buddha in [[Borobudur]].]]
Like the rest of Southeast Asia, [[Indonesia]] seems to have been most strongly influenced by India from the 1st century CE. The islands of [[Sumatra]] and [[Java (island)|Java]] in western Indonesia were the seat of the empire of [[Sri Vijaya]] (8th-13th century), which came to dominate most of the area around the Southeast Asian peninsula through maritime power. The Sri Vijayan Empire had adopted Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism, under a line of rulers named the [[Sailendra]]. The Sailendras was the ardent temple builder and the devoted patron of Buddhism in Java.&lt;ref name="Buddhist Art in India, Ceylon, and Java"&gt;{{cite book | title = Buddhist Art in India, Ceylon, and Java | author1 = Jean Philippe Vogel | author2 = Adriaan Jacob Barnouw | publisher = Asian Educational Services | year = 1936 | isbn = 9788120612259 | url = https://books.google.co.id/books?id=wQ2x0cbZkn0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Buddhist+art+of+Java&amp;hl=id&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjLm_6o6PfVAhXKo48KHUc_DuEQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Buddhist%20art%20of%20Java&amp;f=false| pages = 90–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sri Vijaya spread Mahayana Buddhist art during its expansion into the Southeast Asian peninsula. Numerous statues of Mahayana [[Bodhisattva]]s from this period are characterized by a very strong refinement and technical sophistication, and are found throughout the region. One of the earliest Buddhist inscription in Java, the [[Kalasan inscription]] dated 778, mentioned about the construction of a [[Kalasan|temple]] for the goddess [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]].&lt;ref name="Buddhist Art in India, Ceylon, and Java"/&gt;

Extremely rich and refined architectural remains are found in Java and Sumatra. The most magnificent is the temple of [[Borobudur]] (the largest Buddhist structure in the world, built  around 780-850&amp;nbsp;AD), built by Sailendras.&lt;ref name="Buddhist Art in India, Ceylon, and Java"/&gt; This temple is modelled after the Buddhist concept of universe, the [[Mandala]] which counts 505 images of the seated Buddha and unique bell-shaped stupa that contains the statue of Buddha. Borobudur is adorned with long series of bas-reliefs narrated the holy Buddhist scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Borobudur: Golden Tales of the Buddhas | author = John Miksic | publisher = Tuttle Publishing | year = 2012 | isbn = 9781462909100 | url = https://books.google.co.id/books?id=jwzQAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=borobudur+golden+tales+of+the+buddhas&amp;hl=id&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjP45O7r_rVAhWJtY8KHcpuAfYQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=buddhist%20art&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest Buddhist structure in Indonesia probably is the [[Batujaya Archaeological Site|Batujaya]] stupas at Karawang, West Java, dated from around the 4th century. This temple is some plastered brick stupas. However, Buddhist art in Indonesia reach the golden era during the [[Sailendra]] dynasty rule in Java. The bas-reliefs and statues of [[Boddhisatva]], [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]], and [[Kinnara]] found in [[Kalasan]], [[Candi Sewu|Sewu]], [[Candi Sari|Sari]], and [[Candi Plaosan|Plaosan]] temple is very graceful with serene expression, While [[Mendut]] temple near Borobudur, houses the giant statue of [[Vairocana]], [[Avalokitesvara]], and [[Vajrapani]].

In [[Sumatra]] Sri Vijaya probably built the temple of Muara Takus, and [[Muaro Jambi Temple Compounds|Muaro Jambi]]. The most beautiful example of classical Javanese Buddhist art is the serene and delicate statue of [[Prajnaparamita]] (the collection of National Museum Jakarta) the goddess of transcendental wisdom from [[Singhasari]] kingdom.&lt;ref name ="VCM"&gt;{{cite web|title = Prajnaparamita | publisher =Virtual Collections of Asian Masterpieces| url  =http://masterpieces.asemus.museum/masterpiece/detail.nhn?objectId=12147| accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indonesian Buddhist Empire of Sri Vijaya declined due to conflicts with the [[Chola]] rulers of India, then followed by [[Majapahit]] empire.

==Contemporary Buddhist art==
[[File:Buddha and the gospel of Buddhism (1916) (14779469804).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Illustration from the book "Buddha and the gospel of Buddhism" (1916).]]
Many contemporary artists have made use of Buddhist themes. Notable examples are [[Bill Viola]], in his video installations,&lt;ref&gt;Buddha Mind in Contemporary Art, University of California Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Connell]], in sculpture,&lt;ref&gt;ARTlines, April 1983&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Allan Graham]] in his multi-media "Time is Memory".&lt;ref&gt;The Brooklyn Rail, December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK [[The Network of Buddhist Organisations]] has interested itself in identifying Buddhist practitioners across all the arts. In 2005 it co-ordinated the UK-wide Buddhist arts festival, "A Lotus in Flower";&lt;ref&gt;a poster advertising one of the events is archived here - http://www.nbo.org.uk/whats%20on/poster.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050824213345/http://www.nbo.org.uk/whats%20on/poster.pdf# |date=24 August 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2009 it helped organise the two-day arts conference, "Buddha Mind, Creative Mind".&lt;ref name="blogspot"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fwbo-news.blogspot.com/2009/07/report-from-buddha-mind-creative-mind.html |title=Triratna Buddhist Community News: Report from ‘Buddha Mind - Creative Mind?’ conference |author=Lokabandhu |publisher=fwbo-news.blogspot.com |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the latter an association of Buddhist artists was formed.&lt;ref name="ning"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dharmaarts.ning.com/ |title=Dharma Arts Network - Launched at Buddha Mind - Creative Mind ? |publisher=dharmaarts.ning.com |accessdate=2014-12-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010000408/http://dharmaarts.ning.com/# |archive-date=10 October 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2690">'''Cognized environment''' is a concept first introduced by the late anthropologist, [[Roy Rappaport]] (1968), in contrast to what he called the ''operational environment'' (see Rappaport 1979:97-144, 1984:337-352).  Rappaport was an ecological anthropologist, like [[Andrew P. Vayda]], and wished to contrast the actual reality and adaptations (the operational environment) within a people's ecological niche  – say, the existence of tsetse flies and their role in causing sleeping sickness among humans – with how the people’s culture understands nature (the cognized environment) – say, the belief that witches live in those areas that science knows is the habitat of the tsetse.  Rappaport’s principal concern was the role of ritual in mediating the cognized and operational environments.

Another group of anthropologists later took up the use of Rappaport’s concepts and applied them toward developing a school of [[neuroanthropology]] called [[Biogenetic Structuralism]] (see Laughlin and Brady 1978: 6, d'Aquili, Laughlin and McManus 1979: 12ff, Rubinstein, Laughlin and McManus 1984: 21ff, and Laughlin, McManus and d'Aquili 1990:82-90).  According to this group, all properties and qualities of experience are mediated by our body’s neuroendocrine systems.  These systems function individually and collectively to model reality.  The sum total of these models in the brain is the cognized environment.  The operational environment refers to the actual niche in which the human or other animal with a brain dwells and adapts.  The operational environment is the real world that is modelled by our cognized environment.

{{Semiotics}}
In [[semiotics]], '''connotation''' arises when the [[Denotation (semiotics)|denotative]] relationship between a signifier and its signified is inadequate to serve the needs of the [[community]]. A second level of [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]]s is termed connotative. These meanings are not [[object (philosophy)|objective]] representations of the ''thing'', but new usages produced by the language group.

==Discussion==
Drawing from the original definition proposed by [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]] (1857–1913), a [[sign (semiotics)|sign]] has two parts:
*as a signifier, i.e. it will have a form that a person can see, touch, smell, or hear, and
*as the signified, i.e. it will represent an idea or mental construct of a thing rather than the thing itself. 
Connotative meanings are developed by the community and do not represent the inherent qualities of the thing or [[concept]] originally signified as the meaning. The addition of such meanings introduces complexity into the [[code (semiotics)|coding]] system. If a signifier has only a single denotational meaning, the use of the sign will always be unambiguously decoded by the [[audience]]. But connotative meanings are context-dependent, i.e. the addresser must  learn how to match the meaning intended by the addresser to one of the various possible meanings held in [[memory]]. 

The power of connotation is that it enables the addresser to more easily consider [[abstraction|abstract]] concepts and to introduce subtlety into the [[discourse]]. For example, a digital [[thermometer]] produces a numerical value that indicates the current state of a specific operational parameter. This technology provides an ''indexical'' sign of [[heat]] (adopting the classification of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] (1839–1914), an indexical sign by real connection between the signifier and the signified). The number is a denotative value, i.e. it speaks only for itself. The doctor, nurse or patient will relate to the number as a visual [[Trope (linguistics)|trope]], in this case a [[metaphor]], for the health of the body. Such [[information]] adds to other [[data]] forming a symptomology for the patient, a summation that takes place at a connotative [[cognitive]] level. Hence, the meanings as to health or illness are selected from the connotational framework which the interpreter has constructed through training and experience given that each possible state of well-being is represented by a cluster of [[symbol]]ic attributes, one of which is the patient's temperature.

Connotation is concerned with how the sign system is used in each message. The [[semantic]] content is selected by the addresser and represents that individual's [[value (semiotics)|values]] and intentions. Limiting an analysis purely to the sign system comprised by [[paradigm]]s and [[syntagm]]s excludes key elements in the interpretive process. Thus, [[subject (philosophy)|subjective]] tests such as the [[commutation test]] have been developed to map connotations and so decode more of the addresser's intentions. This is achieved by changing the form of the signifiers, by substituting signifiers to assess what the alternative connotations would be and by considering what signifiers are absent and why their absences might be significant. Changes of form would require substituting different [[typeface|font]]s for the same text, or different colours or designs for the same visual content. The use of [[synonym]]s and [[antonym]]s clarifies connotational choices as between, say, [[pejorative]] and [[euphemistic]] usages. As to absences, if a modern image of a group of people employed in a major public enterprise only contains individuals of the same gender and ethnicity, the analyst would enquire into the significance of the exclusion of those of the opposite gender and a different ethnicity. The editorial decision may be supporting social values, attitudes and beliefs that are embedded into the culture—for example, that nations ought to conscript only men to serve on the front-lines of a war. Other explanations of different contexts may expose cultural [[mythology|myth]]s and [[prejudice]]s which are less reasonable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9952">In biochemistry, '''docosanoids''' are [[lipid signaling|signaling molecules]] made by the metabolism of twenty-two-carbon fatty acids (EFAs), especially the [[omega-3 fatty acid]], [[Docosahexaenoic acid]] (DHA) (i.e. 4''Z'',7''Z'',10''Z'',13''Z'',16''Z'',19''Z''-docosahexaenoic acid) by [[lipoxygenase]], [[cyclooxygenase]], and [[cytochrome P450]] enzymes. Other docosanoids are metabolites of n-3 docosapentaenoic acid (i.e. 7''Z'',10''Z'',13''Z'',16''Z'',19''Z''-docosahexaenoic acid), n-6 DHA (i.e. 4''Z'',7''Z'',10''Z'',13''Z'',16''Z''-docosahexaenoic acid, and docosatetraenoic acid (i.e. 7''Z'',10''Z'',13''Z'',16''Z''-docosatetraenoic acid, DTA, or adrenic acid). Prominent docosanoid metabolites of DHA and n-3 DHA are members of the specialized proresolving mediator class of [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]] metabolites that possess potent anti-[[inflammation]], tissue healing, and other activities (see [[specialized proresolving mediators]]).

==Prominent docosanoids==

===Specialized proresolving mediator docosanoids===
Potently bioactive agents of the specialized proresolving mediator class include:

These DHA metabolites possess anti-[[inflammation]] and tissue-protection activities in animal models of inflammatory diseases; they are proposed to inhibit [[innate immune response]]s and thereby to protect from and to resolve a wide range of inflammatory responses in animals and humans. These metabolites are also proposed to contribute to the anti-inflammatory and other beneficial effects of dietary omega-3 fatty acids by being metabolized to them.&lt;ref name="pmid25149823"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Calder PC | title = Marine omega-3 fatty acids and inflammatory processes: Effects, mechanisms and clinical relevance | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1851 | issue = 4 | pages = 469–84 | year = 2015 | pmid = 25149823 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbalip.2014.08.010 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25359497"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Serhan CN, Chiang N, Dalli J, Levy BD | title = Lipid mediators in the resolution of inflammation | journal = Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = a016311 | year = 2015 | pmid = 25359497 | doi = 10.1101/cshperspect.a016311 | pmc=4315926}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid26655290"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barden AE, Mas E, Mori TA | title = n-3 Fatty acid supplementation and proresolving mediators of inflammation | journal = Current Opinion in Lipidology | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | pages = 26–32 | year = 2016 | pmid = 26655290 | doi = 10.1097/MOL.0000000000000262 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid26545300"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Balas L, Durand T | title = Dihydroxylated E,E,Z-docosatrienes.

===Neurofuran docosanoids===
DHA can be converted non-enzymatically by free radical-mediated peroxidation to 8 different [[neurofuran]] regio[[isomers]] termed neuroprostanes and neurofuranes including 4-, 7-, 10-, 11-, 13-, 14-, 17-, and 20-series neurofurans/neuroporstanes for a total of 128 different racemic compounds. The most studied DHA-derived of these products are members of the 4-series, neurofuran 4-F&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;neuroprostane and 4(''RS'')-ST-Δ6-8-neurofurane. These metabolites have been used mainly as [[biomarker]]s of [[oxidative stress]] that are formed in nerve tissues of the [[central nervous system]].&lt;ref name="pmid17954232"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Arneson KO, Roberts LJ | title = Measurement of products of docosahexaenoic acid peroxidation, neuroprostanes, and neurofurans | journal = Methods in Enzymology | volume = 433 | issue = | pages = 127–43 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17954232 | doi = 10.1016/S0076-6879(07)33007-3 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25184341"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Leung KS, Galano JM, Durand T, Lee JC | title = Current development in non-enzymatic lipid peroxidation products, isoprostanoids and isofuranoids, in novel biological samples | journal = Free Radical Research | volume = 49 | issue = 7 | pages = 816–26 | year = 2015 | pmid = 25184341 | doi = 10.3109/10715762.2014.960867 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydroxy-docosanoids===
Cells metabolize DHA to 17''S''-hydroperoxy-4''Z'',7''Z'',10''Z'',13''Z'',15''E'',19''Z''-docahexaenoicacid acid (17-HpDHA) and then rapidly reduce this hydroperoxide to  17''S''-hydroxy-4''Z'',7''Z'',10''Z'',13''Z'',15''E'',19''Z''-docahexaenoicacid acid (17-HDHA) and similarly metabolize DHA to 13''S''-hydroperoxy-4''Z'',7''Z'',10''Z'',14''Z'',16''Z'',19''Z''-docahexaenoicacid acid (13-HpDHA) and then to 13''S''-hydroxy-4''Z'',7''Z'',10''Z'',14''Z'',16''Z'',19''Z''-docahexaenoicacid acid (13-HDHA). 17-HDHA exhibits potent in vitro as well as in vivo (animal model) anti-inflammatory activity while 17-HpDHA and to a lesser extent 17-HDHA inhibit the growth of cultured human breast cancer cells.&lt;ref name="pmid22618200"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chiu CY, Gomolka B, Dierkes C, Huang NR, Schroeder M, Purschke M, Manstein D, Dangi B, Weylandt KH | title = Omega-6 docosapentaenoic acid-derived resolvins and 17-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid modulate macrophage function and alleviate experimental colitis | journal = Inflammation Research| volume = 61 | issue = 9 | pages = 967–76 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22618200 | doi = 10.1007/s00011-012-0489-8 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid23029040"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Flaherty JT, Hu Y, Wooten RE, Horita DA, Samuel MP, Thomas MJ, Sun H, Edwards IJ | title = 15-lipoxygenase metabolites of docosahexaenoic acid inhibit prostate cancer cell proliferation and survival | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 7 | issue = 9 | pages = e45480 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23029040 | pmc = 3447860 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0045480 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other SPM docosanoids, e.g. RvD1 and RvD2, have anti-growth effects against cancer cells in animal models.&lt;ref name="pmid25857211"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Serhan CN, Chiang N, Dalli J | title = The resolution code of acute inflammation: Novel pro-resolving lipid mediators in resolution | journal = Seminars in Immunology | volume = 27 | issue = 3 | pages = 200–15 | year = 2015 | pmid = 25857211 | pmc = 4515371 | doi = 10.1016/j.smim.2015.03.004 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oxo-docosanoids===
Cells can metabolize DHA to products that possess an oxo (i.e. [[ketone]]) residue. These products include 13-oxo-DHA (termed EFOXD6) and 17-oxo-DHA (termed 18-EFOXD6).  Both oxo metabolites  possess anti-inflammatory activity as assesses in in vitro systems (see [[Specialized proresolving mediators#Oxo-DHA and oxo-DPA metabolites]]).&lt;ref name="pmid26546723"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weylandt KH | title = Docosapentaenoic acid derived metabolites and mediators - The new world of lipid mediator medicine in a nutshell | journal = European Journal of Pharmacology | volume = | issue = | pages = | year = 2015 | pmid = 26546723 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejphar.2015.11.002 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the term first appeared in a 1964 paper by Michael Beldoch, it gained popularity in the 1995 book by that title, written by author and science journalist [[Daniel Goleman]].&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=Emotional+intelligence&amp;case_insensitive=on&amp;year_start=1900&amp;year_end=2008&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=0&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t4%3B%2CEmotional%20intelligence%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Bemotional%20intelligence%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BEmotional%20Intelligence%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BEmotional%20intelligence%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BEMOTIONAL%20INTELLIGENCE%3B%2Cc0 | Google Ngram graph&lt;/ref&gt; Since this time, EI, and Goleman's 1995 analysis, have been criticized within the [[scientific community]],&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Kevin R.

[[Empathy]] is typically associated with EI, because it relates to an individual connecting their personal experiences with those of others. However, a number of models exist that aim to measure levels of (empathy) EI. There are currently several models of EI. Goleman's original model may now be considered a ''mixed model'' that combines what has since been modeled separately as ''ability EI'' and ''trait EI''. Goleman defined EI as the array of skills and characteristics that drive leadership performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Goleman |first= Daniel |year= 1998 |title= What Makes a Leader? |publisher= Harvard Business Review |location= |page= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''trait model'' was developed by Konstantin Vasily Petrides in 2001.  It "encompasses behavioral dispositions and self perceived abilities and is measured through self report".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last1 = Petrides| first1 = Konstantin| author-link =| last2 = Furnham| first2 = Adrian| author2-link =| title = Trait Emotional Intelligence: Psychometric Investigation with Reference to Established Trait Taxonomies| newspaper = European Journal of Personality| pages = 425–448| year = 2001| url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''ability model'', developed by [[Peter Salovey]] and [[John D. Mayer|John Mayer]] in 2004, focuses on the individual's ability to process emotional information and use it to navigate the [[social environment]].&lt;ref name = "Emotional Intelligence: Theory, Findings, and Implications"&gt;{{Citation |last1= Salovey |first1= Peter |last2 = Mayer |first2 =John |last3 = Caruso |first3 = David |year= 2004|title= Emotional Intelligence: Theory, Findings, and Implications | newspaper = Psychological Inquiry | pages = 197–215 |publisher= |location= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have shown that people with high EI have greater [[mental health]], [[job performance]], and [[leadership skills]] although no [[causal relationships]] have been shown and such findings are likely to be attributable to [[general intelligence]] and specific [[personality traits]] rather than emotional intelligence as a construct. For example, Goleman indicated that EI accounted for 67% of the abilities deemed necessary for superior performance in leaders, and mattered twice as much as technical expertise or IQ.&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, D. (1998). Working With Emotional Intelligence. New York, NY.

== History ==
The term "emotional intelligence" seems first to have appeared in a 1964 paper by Michael Beldoch,&lt;ref&gt;Beldoch, M. (1964), Sensitivity to expression of emotional meaning in three modes of communication, in J. R. Davitz et al., The Communication of Emotional Meaning, McGraw-Hill, pp. 31–42&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LKqQM3CLAyQC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;dq=%22Sensitivity+to+expression+of+emotional+meaning+in+three+modes+of+communication%22+Beldoch&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oqKrhg_zer&amp;sig=ZS86mte_m-BGbNb24vZ_bTwoUjA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAGoVChMIk4vYqYzMyAIVglwsCh344g3I#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Sensitivity%20to%20expression%20of%20emotional%20meaning%20in%20three%20modes%20of%20communication%22%20Beldoch&amp;f=false "Contributions to social interactions: Social Encounters"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905144115/https://books.google.com/books?id=LKqQM3CLAyQC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;dq=%22Sensitivity+to+expression+of+emotional+meaning+in+three+modes+of+communication%22+Beldoch&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oqKrhg_zer&amp;sig=ZS86mte_m-BGbNb24vZ_bTwoUjA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAGoVChMIk4vYqYzMyAIVglwsCh344g3I |date=2017-09-05 }} Editor: Michael Argyle, reprint online on Google Books&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 1966 paper by B. Leuner entitled ''Emotional intelligence and emancipation'' which appeared in the psychotherapeutic journal: ''Practice of child psychology and child psychiatry''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leuner | first1 = B | year = 1966 | title = Emotional intelligence and emancipation | url = | journal = Praxis der Kinderpsychologie und Kinderpsychiatrie | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 193–203 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, [[Howard Gardner]]'s ''Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences''&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, H. (1983). Frames of mind. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the idea that traditional types of intelligence, such as [[IQ]], fail to fully explain cognitive ability. He introduced the idea of [[multiple intelligences]] which included both ''interpersonal intelligence'' (the capacity to understand the intentions, motivations and desires of other people) and ''intrapersonal intelligence'' (the capacity to understand oneself, to appreciate one's feelings, fears and motivations).&lt;ref&gt;Smith, M.K. (2002) "Howard Gardner and multiple intelligences", ''The Encyclopedia of Informal Education'', downloaded from {{cite web |url=http://www.infed.org/thinkers/gardner.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-11-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051102035039/http://www.infed.org/thinkers/gardner.htm |archivedate=2005-11-02 |df= }} on October 31, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term subsequently appeared in Wayne Payne's [[doctoral thesis]], ''A Study of Emotion: Developing Emotional Intelligence'' in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, W.L. (1983/1986). A study of emotion: developing emotional intelligence; self integration; relating to fear, pain and desire" ''Dissertation Abstracts International'' 47, p. 203A (University microfilms No. AAC 8605928)&lt;/ref&gt;

The first published use of the term 'EQ' (Emotional Quotient) is an article by Keith Beasley in 1987 in the British Mensa magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Beasley, K. (1987). The Emotional Quotient. ''Mensa'', May 1987, p25. It should be noted that earlier use of the term E.Q has been found in a [http://stanforddailyarchive.com/cgi-bin/stanford?a=d&amp;d=stanford19791205-01.2.86.1# 1979 Stamford Daily Ad Campaign] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160625165121/http://stanforddailyarchive.com/cgi-bin/stanford?a=d&amp;d=stanford19791205-01.2.86.1 |date=2016-06-25 }} but was used to denote something quite different, The Economic Quotient&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=July 2016}}{{verification needed|date=July 2016}}{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

In 1989 [[Stanley Greenspan]] put forward a model to describe EI, followed by another by [[Peter Salovey]] and John Mayer published in the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Salovey | first1 = P. | last2 = Mayer | first2 = J.D. | year = 1989 | title = Emotional intelligence | url = http://ei.yale.edu/journal/imagination-cognition-and-personality/ | journal = Imagination, Cognition, and Personality | volume = 9 | issue = 3| pages = 185–211 | doi=10.2190/dugg-p24e-52wk-6cdg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the term became widely known with the publication of [[Daniel Goleman|Goleman]]'s book: ''Emotional Intelligence – Why it can matter more than IQ''&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, D., (1995) Emotional Intelligence, New York, NY, England: Bantam Books, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; (1995). It is to this book's best-selling status that the term can attribute its popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dan-goleman/ |title=Dan Goleman |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |accessdate=2014-03-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304084501/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dan-goleman/ |archivedate=2014-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dan Schawbel |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/danschawbel/2011/09/15/daniel-goleman-on-leadership-and-the-power-of-emotional-intelligence |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104185806/http://www.forbes.com/sites/danschawbel/2011/09/15/daniel-goleman-on-leadership-and-the-power-of-emotional-intelligence |archivedate=2012-11-04 |title=Daniel Goleman on Leadership and The Power of Emotional Intelligence – Forbes |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goleman has followed up with several further popular publications of a similar theme that reinforce use of the term.&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, D.

To date, tests measuring EI have not replaced IQ tests as a standard metric of intelligence. Emotional Intelligence has also received criticism on its role in leadership and business success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505125_162-57376240/why-emotional-intelligence-is-just-a-fad/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128120307/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505125_162-57376240/why-emotional-intelligence-is-just-a-fad/ |archivedate=2012-11-28 |title=Why emotional intelligence is just a fad – CBS News |date=2012-02-13 |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinction between trait emotional intelligence and ability emotional intelligence was introduced in 2000.&lt;ref name="pet2000"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Petrides | first1 = K.V. | last2 = Furnham | first2 = A. | year = 2000a | title = On the dimensional structure of emotional intelligence | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 29 | issue = 2| pages = 313–320 | doi=10.1016/s0191-8869(99)00195-6| citeseerx = 10.1.1.475.5285 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==
Emotional intelligence has been defined as "the ability to monitor one's own and other people's emotions, to discriminate between different emotions and label them appropriately, and to use emotional information to guide thinking and behavior" by Peter Salovey and John Mayer. This definition was later broken down and refined into four proposed abilities: perceiving, using, understanding, and managing emotions. These abilities are distinct yet related.&lt;ref name="A Dictionary of Psychology" /&gt; Emotional intelligence also reflects abilities to join intelligence, empathy and emotions to enhance thought and understanding of interpersonal dynamics.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5907081|title = Human Abilities: Emotional Intelligence|last = Mayer|first = John D|date = 2008|journal = Annual Review of Psychology|doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.59.103006.093646|pmid = 17937602|access-date = |volume = 59|pages = 507–536|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151222125327/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5907081_Human_Abilities_Emotional_Intelligence|archivedate = 2015-12-22|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, substantial disagreement exists regarding the definition of EI, with respect to both terminology and operationalizations. Currently, there are three main models of EI:
# Ability model
# Mixed model (usually subsumed under trait EI)&lt;ref name="Kluemper, D.H. 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kluemper | first1 = D.H. | year = 2008 | title = Trait emotional intelligence: The impact of core-self evaluations and social desirability | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 44 | issue = 6| pages = 1402–1412 | doi=10.1016/j.paid.2007.12.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2010.05.029 | last1 = Martins | first1 = A. | last2 = Ramalho | first2 = N. | last3 = Morin | first3 = E. | year = 2010 | title = A comprehensive meta-analysis of the relationship between emotional intelligence and health | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 49 | issue = 6| pages = 554–564 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Trait model

Different models of EI have led to the development of various instruments for the [[psychometrics|assessment]] of the construct. While some of these measures may overlap, most researchers agree that they tap different constructs.

Specific ability models address the ways in which emotions facilitate thought and understanding. For example, emotions may interact with thinking and allow people to be better decision makers (Lyubomirsky et al. 2005).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A  person who is more responsive emotionally to crucial issues will attend to the more crucial aspects of his or her life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Aspects of  emotional  facilitation factor is to also know how  to include or exclude emotions from thought depending on context and situation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is also related to [[emotional reasoning]] and understanding in response to the people, environment and circumstances one encounters in his or her day-to-day life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Ability model ==

Salovey and Mayer's conception of EI strives to define EI within the confines of the standard criteria for a new intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mayer | first1 = J.D. | last2 = Salovey | first2 = P. | last3 = Caruso | first3 = D.L. | last4 = Sitarenios | first4 = G. | year = 2001 | title = Emotional intelligence as a standard intelligence | url = | journal = Emotion | volume = 1 | issue = 3| pages = 232–242 | doi=10.1037/1528-3542.1.3.232}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = MacCann | first1 = C. | last2 = Joseph | first2 = D.L. | last3 = Newman | first3 = D.A. | last4 = Roberts | first4 = R.D. | year = 2014 | title = Emotional intelligence is a second-stratum factor of intelligence: Evidence from hierarchical and bifactor models | url = | journal = Emotion | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 358–374 | doi=10.1037/a0034755| pmid = 24341786 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following their continuing research, their initial definition of EI was revised to "The ability to perceive emotion, integrate emotion to facilitate thought, understand emotions and to regulate emotions to promote personal growth." However, after pursuing further research, their definition of EI evolved into "the capacity to reason about emotions, and of emotions, to enhance thinking. It includes the abilities to accurately perceive emotions, to access and generate emotions so as to assist thought, to understand emotions and emotional knowledge, and to reflectively regulate emotions so as to promote emotional and intellectual growth." &lt;ref name="Emotional Intelligence: Theory, Findings, and Implications" /&gt;

The ability-based model views emotions as useful sources of information that help one to make sense of and navigate the social environment.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, J.D., &amp; Salovey, P. (1997). What is emotional intelligence? In P. Salovey &amp; D. Sluyter (Eds.), Emotional development and emotional intelligence: Implications for educators (pp. 3–31). New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grewal"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Salovey | first1 = P | last2 = Grewal | first2 = D | year = 2005 | title = The Science of Emotional Intelligence | url = | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 14 | issue = 6| page = 6 | doi=10.1111/j.0963-7214.2005.00381.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model proposes that individuals vary in their ability to process information of an emotional nature and in their ability to relate emotional processing to a wider cognition. This ability is seen to manifest itself in certain adaptive behaviors. The model claims that EI includes four types of abilities:
# Perceiving emotions – the ability to detect and decipher emotions in faces, pictures, voices, and cultural artifacts—including the ability to identify one's own emotions. Perceiving emotions represents a basic aspect of emotional intelligence, as it makes all other processing of emotional information possible.
# Using emotions – the ability to harness emotions to facilitate various cognitive activities, such as thinking and problem solving. The emotionally intelligent person can capitalize fully upon his or her changing [[mood (psychology)|moods]] in order to best fit the task at hand.
# Understanding emotions – the ability to comprehend emotion language and to appreciate complicated relationships among emotions. For example, understanding emotions encompasses the ability to be sensitive to slight variations between emotions, and the ability to recognize and describe how emotions evolve over time.
# Managing emotions – the ability to regulate emotions in both ourselves and in others. Therefore, the emotionally intelligent person can harness emotions, even negative ones, and manage them to achieve intended goals.

The ability EI model has been criticized in the research for lacking face and predictive validity in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.psicothema.com/pdf/3277.pdf|author1=Bradberry, T.|author2=Su, L.|date=2003|title=Ability-versus skill-based assessment of emotional intelligence|journal=Psicothema|volume=18|pages=59–66|format=PDF|accessdate=2014-03-07|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905061723/http://www.psicothema.com/pdf/3277.pdf|archivedate=2012-09-05|df=|pmid=17295959}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in terms of construct validity, ability EI tests have great advantage over self-report scales of EI because they compare individual maximal performance to standard performance scales and do not rely on individuals' endorsement of descriptive statements about themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Convergent, discriminant, and incremental validity of competing measures of emotional intelligence|last = Brackett M.A. &amp; J.D.

=== Measurement ===

The current measure of Mayer and Salovey's model of EI, the [[Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test]] (MSCEIT) is based on a series of emotion-based problem-solving items.&lt;ref name="grewal"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mayer | first1 = J.D. | last2 = Salovey | first2 = P. | last3 = Caruso | first3 = D.R. | last4 = Sitarenios | first4 = G. | year = 2003 | title = Measuring emotional intelligence with the MSCEIT V2.0 | url = | journal = Emotion | volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 97–105 | doi=10.1037/1528-3542.3.1.97| pmid = 12899321 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consistent with the model's claim of EI as a type of intelligence, the test is modeled on ability-based [[IQ tests]]. By testing a person's abilities on each of the four branches of emotional intelligence, it generates scores for each of the branches as well as a total score.

Central to the four-branch model is the idea that EI requires attunement to [[social norms]]. Therefore, the [[Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test|MSCEIT]] is [[consensus based assessment|scored in a consensus fashion]], with higher scores indicating higher overlap between an individual's answers and those provided by a worldwide sample of respondents. The MSCEIT can also be expert-scored, so that the amount of overlap is calculated between an individual's answers and those provided by a group of 21 [[emotion|emotion researchers]].&lt;ref name="grewal"/&gt;

Although promoted as an ability test, the [[Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test|MSCEIT]] is unlike standard IQ tests in that its items do not have objectively correct responses. Among other challenges, the consensus scoring criterion means that it is impossible to create items (questions) that only a minority of respondents can solve, because, by definition, responses are deemed emotionally "intelligent" only if the majority of the sample has endorsed them. This and other similar problems have led some cognitive ability experts to question the definition of EI as a genuine intelligence.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

In a study by Føllesdal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psykologi.uio.no/studier/drpsych/disputaser/follesdal_summary.html |title=Emotional Intelligence as Ability: Assessing the Construct Validity of Scores from the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT) |author=Hallvard Føllesdal |others=PhD Thesis and accompanying papers – University of Oslo 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216094950/http://www.psykologi.uio.no/studier/drpsych/disputaser/follesdal_summary.html |archivedate=2008-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test|MSCEIT]] test results of 111 business leaders were compared with how their employees described their leader. It was found that there were no correlations between a leader's test results and how he or she was rated by the employees, with regard to [[empathy]], ability to motivate, and leader effectiveness. Føllesdal also criticized the Canadian company Multi-Health Systems, which administers the [[Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test|MSCEIT]] test. The test contains 141 questions but it was found after publishing the test that 19 of these did not give the expected answers. This has led Multi-Health Systems to remove answers to these 19 questions before scoring but without stating this officially.

=== Other measurements ===
Various other specific measures have also been used to assess ability in emotional intelligence. These measures include:
# Diagnostic Analysis of Non-verbal Accuracy&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; – The Adult Facial version includes  24 photographs of equal amount of happy, sad, angry, and fearful facial expressions of both high and low intensities which are balanced by gender. The tasks of the participants is to answer which of the four emotions is present in the given stimuli.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Japanese and Caucasian Brief Affect Recognition test&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; – Participants try to identify 56 faces of Caucasian and Japanese individuals expressing seven emotions such happiness, contempt, disgust, sadness, anger, surprise, and fear, which may also trail  off for 0.2 seconds to a different emotion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Levels of Emotional Awareness Scale&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; – Participants reads 26 social scenes and answers their anticipated feelings and continuum of low to high emotional awareness.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Mixed model ==

The model introduced by Daniel Goleman&lt;ref name="goleman98"&gt;Goleman, D. (1998). Working with emotional intelligence. New York: Bantam Books&lt;/ref&gt; focuses on EI as a wide array of competencies and skills that drive leadership performance. Goleman's model outlines five main EI constructs (for more details see "What Makes A Leader" by Daniel Goleman, best of Harvard Business Review 1998):

# [[Self-awareness]] – the ability to know one's emotions, strengths, weaknesses, drives, values and goals and recognize their impact on others while using [[gut feeling]]s to guide decisions.
# [[Emotional self-regulation|Self-regulation]] – involves controlling or redirecting one's disruptive emotions and impulses and adapting to changing circumstances.
# [[Social skill]] – managing relationships to move people in the desired direction
# [[Empathy]] – considering other people's feelings especially when making decisions
# [[Motivation]] – being driven to achieve for the sake of achievement

Goleman includes a set of [[emotional competence|emotional competencies]] within each construct of EI. Emotional competencies are not innate talents, but rather learned capabilities that must be worked on and can be developed to achieve outstanding performance. Goleman posits that individuals are born with a general emotional intelligence that determines their potential for learning emotional competencies.&lt;ref name="boy"&gt;Boyatzis, R., Goleman, D., &amp; Rhee, K. (2000). Clustering competence in emotional intelligence: insights from the emotional competence inventory (ECI). In R. Bar-On &amp; J.D.A. Parker (eds.): Handbook of emotional intelligence (pp. 343–362). San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt; Goleman's model of EI has been criticized in the research literature as mere "[[pop psychology]]" (Mayer, Roberts, &amp; Barsade, 2008).

=== Measurement ===

Two measurement tools are based on the Goleman model:
# The Emotional Competency Inventory (ECI), which was created in 1999, and the Emotional and Social Competency Inventory (ESCI), a newer edition of the ECI was developed in 2007. The Emotional and Social Competency – University Edition (ESCI-U) is also available. These tools developed by Goleman and [[Richard Boyatzis|Boyatzis]] provide a behavioral measure of the Emotional and Social competencies.
# [[The Emotional Intelligence Appraisal]], which was created in 2001 and which can be taken as a self-report or 360-degree assessment.&lt;ref&gt;Bradberry, Travis and Greaves, Jean. (2009). ''[[Emotional Intelligence 2.0]]''. San Francisco: Publishers Group West. {{ISBN|978-0-9743206-2-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trait model ==
{{See also|Trait theory}}
Konstantinos Vasilis Petrides ("K. V. Petrides") proposed a conceptual distinction between the ability based model and a [[Phenotypic trait|trait]] based model of EI and has been developing the latter over many years in numerous publications.&lt;ref name="pet2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="petrides07"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Petrides | first1 = K.V. | last2 = Pita | first2 = R. | last3 = Kokkinaki | first3 = F. | year = 2007 | title = The location of trait emotional intelligence in personality factor space | url = | journal = British Journal of Psychology | volume = 98 | issue = 2| pages = 273–289 | doi=10.1348/000712606x120618| pmid = 17456273 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Trait EI is "a constellation of emotional self-perceptions located at the lower levels of personality."&lt;ref name="petrides07"/&gt; In lay terms, trait EI refers to an individual's self-perceptions of their emotional abilities. This definition of EI encompasses behavioral dispositions and self-perceived abilities and is measured by [[self-report inventory|self report]], as opposed to the ability based model which refers to actual abilities, which have proven highly resistant to scientific measurement. Trait EI should be investigated within a [[personality psychology|personality]] framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Petrides | first1 = K.V. | last2 = Furnham | first2 = A. | year = 2001 | title = Trait emotional intelligence: Psychometric investigation with reference to established trait taxonomies | url = | journal = European Journal of Personality | volume = 15 | issue = 6| pages = 425–448 | doi=10.1002/per.416}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative label for the same construct is trait emotional [[self-efficacy]].

The trait EI model is general and subsumes the Goleman model discussed above. The conceptualization of EI as a personality trait leads to a construct that lies outside the [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of human cognitive ability. This is an important distinction in as much as it bears directly on the operationalization of the construct and the theories and hypotheses that are formulated about it.&lt;ref name="pet2000"/&gt;

=== Measurement ===

There are many self-report measures of EI,&lt;ref&gt;Pérez, J.C., Petrides, K.V., &amp; Furnham, A. (2005). [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.474.294&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Measuring trait emotional intelligence]. In R. Schulze and R.D. Roberts (Eds.), International Handbook of Emotional Intelligence (pp.181–201). Cambridge, Massachusetts: Hogrefe &amp; Huber.&lt;/ref&gt; including the EQ-i, the Swinburne University Emotional Intelligence Test (SUEIT), and the Schutte EI model. None of these assess intelligence, abilities, or skills (as their authors often claim), but rather, they are limited measures of trait emotional intelligence.&lt;ref name="petrides07" /&gt; The most widely used and widely researched measure of self-report or self-schema (as it is currently referred to) emotional intelligence is the EQ-i 2.0. Originally known as the [[Reuven Bar-On|BarOn]] EQ-i, it was the first self-report measure of emotional intelligence available, the only measure predating Goleman's best-selling book. There are over 200 studies that have used the EQ-i or EQ-i 2.0. It has the best norms, reliability, and validity of any self-report instrument and was the first one reviewed in Buros Mental Measures Book. The EQ-i 2.0 is available in many different languages as it is used worldwide.

The TEIQue provides an operationalization for the model of Petrides and colleagues, that conceptualizes EI in terms of personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Petrides | first1 = K.V. | last2 = Furnham | first2 = A. | year = 2003 | title = Trait emotional intelligence: behavioral validation in two studies of emotion recognition and reactivity to mood induction | url = | journal = European Journal of Personality | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 39–75 | doi=10.1002/per.466}}&lt;/ref&gt; The test encompasses 15 subscales organized under four factors: [[Quality of life|well-being]], [[self-control]], [[emotionality]], and [[sociability]]. The [[psychometrics|psychometric]] properties of the TEIQue were investigated in a study on a French-speaking population, where it was reported that TEIQue scores were globally [[normally distributed]] and [[reliability (statistics)|reliable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mikolajczak | first1 = Luminet | last2 = Leroy | last3 = Roy | year = 2007 | title = Psychometric Properties of the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire: Factor Structure, Reliability, Construct, and Incremental Validity in a French-Speaking Population | url = | journal = Journal of Personality Assessment | volume = 88 | issue = 3| pages = 338–353 | doi=10.1080/00223890701333431| pmid = 17518555 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The researchers also found TEIQue scores were unrelated to nonverbal reasoning ([[Raven's Progressive Matrices|Raven's matrices]]), which they interpreted as support for the personality trait view of EI (as opposed to a form of intelligence). As expected, TEIQue scores were positively related to some of the [[Big Five personality traits]] ([[extraversion]], [[agreeableness]], [[openness to experience|openness]], [[conscientiousness]]) as well as inversely related to others ([[alexithymia]], [[neuroticism]]). A number of quantitative genetic studies have been carried out within the trait EI model, which have revealed significant genetic effects and heritabilities for all trait EI scores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1037/a0013439 | last1 = Vernon | first1 = P.A. | last2 = Petrides | first2 = K.V. | last3 = Bratko | first3 = D. | last4 = Schermer | first4 = J.A. | year = 2008 | title = A behavioral genetic study of trait emotional intelligence | url = | journal = Emotion | volume = 8 | issue = 5| pages = 635–642 | pmid = 18837613 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two recent studies (one a meta-analysis) involving direct comparisons of multiple EI tests yielded very favorable results for the TEIQue.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/00049530903312857 | last1 = Gardner | first1 = J.

== General effects ==
A review published in the journal of ''Annual Psychology'' found that higher emotional intelligence is positively correlated with:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Better social relations for children – Among children and teens, emotional intelligence positively correlates with good social interactions, relationships and negatively correlates with deviance from social norms, anti-social behavior measured both in and out of school as reported by children themselves, their own family members as well as their teachers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Better social relations for adults – High emotional intelligence among adults is correlated with better self-perception of social ability and more successful interpersonal relationships while less interpersonal aggression and problems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Highly emotionally intelligent individuals are perceived more positively by others – Other individuals perceive those with high EI to be more pleasant, socially skilled and empathic to be around.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Better family and intimate relationships – High EI is correlated with better relationships with the family and intimate partners on many aspects.
# Better academic achievement – Emotional intelligence is correlated with greater achievement in academics as reported by teachers but generally not  higher grades once the factor of IQ is taken into account.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Better social relations during work performance and in negotiations – Higher emotional intelligence is correlated with better social dynamics at work as well as better negotiating ability.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Better psychological well-being - Emotional intelligence is positively correlated with higher [[life satisfaction]], self-esteem and lower levels of insecurity or depression. It is also negatively correlated with poor health choices and behavior.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Allows for self-compassion - Emotionally intelligent individuals are more likely to have a better understanding of themselves, and to make conscious decisions based on emotion and rationale combined. Overall, it leads a person to [[Self-actualization|self-actualization]].&lt;ref name="Self-compassion"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heffernan|first1=Mary|last2=Quinn|first2=Mary|last3=McNulty|first3=Rita|last4=Fitzpatrick|first4=Joyce|date=2010|title=Self-compassion and emotional intelligence in nurses|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c8f7/332816fda3b9f702204718ff69e773f1ed05.pdf|journal=International Journal of Nursing Practice|volume=16|pages=366–373|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms of theoretical foundation ==

=== Cannot be recognized as form of intelligence ===
Goleman's early work has been criticized for assuming from the beginning that EI is a type of intelligence or [[cognitive ability]]. Eysenck (2000)&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite book|author-link = Hans Eysenck|last = Eysenck|first = H.J.|title = Intelligence: A New Look|year = 2000|isbn = 978-0-7658-0707-6|postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; writes that Goleman's description of EI contains unsubstantiated assumptions about intelligence in general, and that it even runs contrary to what researchers have come to expect when studying types of intelligence:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"[Goleman] exemplifies more clearly than most the fundamental absurdity of the tendency to class almost any type of behavior as an 'intelligence'... If these five 'abilities' define 'emotional intelligence', we would expect some evidence that they are highly correlated; Goleman admits that they might be quite uncorrelated, and in any case if we cannot measure them, how do we know they are related? So the whole theory is built on quicksand: there is no sound scientific basis."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Similarly, Locke (2005)&lt;ref name="locke"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/job.318 | last1 = Locke | first1 = E.A. | year = 2005 | title = Why emotional intelligence is an invalid concept | url = | journal = Journal of Organizational Behavior | volume = 26 | issue = 4| pages = 425–431 }}&lt;/ref&gt; claims that the concept of EI is in itself a misinterpretation of the intelligence construct, and he offers an alternative interpretation: it is not another form or type of intelligence, but intelligence—the ability to grasp [[abstractions]]—applied to a particular life domain: emotions. He suggests the concept should be re-labeled and referred to as a skill.

The essence of this criticism is that scientific inquiry depends on valid and consistent construct utilization, and that before the introduction of the term EI, psychologists had established theoretical distinctions between factors such as abilities and achievements, skills and habits, attitudes and values, and personality traits and emotional states.&lt;ref name="everydaypsychology"&gt;Mattiuzzi, P.G. (2008) [http://everydaypsychology.com/2008/12/emotional-intelligence-im-not-feeling.html Emotional Intelligence? I'm not feeling it.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720053237/http://everydaypsychology.com/2008/12/emotional-intelligence-im-not-feeling.html |date=2009-07-20 }} everydaypsychology.com&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, some scholars believe that the term ''EI'' merges and conflates such accepted concepts and definitions.

=== Confusing skills with moral qualities ===

[[Adam Grant]] warned of the common but mistaken perception of EI as a desirable moral quality rather than a skill, Grant asserting that a well-developed EI is not only an instrumental tool for accomplishing goals, but has a dark side as a weapon for manipulating others by robbing them of their capacity to reason.&lt;ref name=TheAtlantic20140102&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/01/the-dark-side-of-emotional-intelligence/282720/ |title=The Dark Side of Emotional Intelligence |last=Grant |first=Adam |date=January 2, 2014 |website=The Atlantic |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6MsAko357?url=http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/01/the-dark-side-of-emotional-intelligence/282720/ |archivedate=January 24, 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Has little predictive value ===

Landy (2005)&lt;ref name="landy"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Landy | first1 = F.J. | year = 2005 | title = Some historical and scientific issues related to research on emotional intelligence | url = | journal = Journal of Organizational Behavior | volume = 26 | issue = 4| pages = 411–424 | doi=10.1002/job.317}}&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that the few [[wikt:incremental|incremental]] validity studies conducted on EI have shown that it adds little or nothing to the explanation or prediction of some common outcomes (most notably academic and work success). Landy suggested that the reason why some studies have found a small increase in [[predictive validity]] is a [[methodology|methodological]] fallacy, namely, that alternative explanations have not been completely considered:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"EI is compared and contrasted with a measure of abstract intelligence but not with a personality measure, or with a personality measure but not with a measure of academic intelligence." Landy (2005)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Similarly, other researchers have raised concerns about the extent to which self-report EI measures [[correlation|correlate]] with established personality dimensions. Generally, self-report EI measures and personality measures have been said to converge because they both purport to measure personality traits.&lt;ref name="petrides07"/&gt; Specifically, there appear to be two dimensions of the [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five]] that stand out as most related to self-report EI&amp;nbsp;– [[neuroticism]] and [[extroversion]]. In particular, neuroticism has been said to relate to negative emotionality and [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]]. Intuitively, individuals scoring high on neuroticism are likely to score low on self-report EI measures.

The interpretations of the correlations between EI questionnaires and personality have been varied. The prominent view in the scientific literature is the Trait EI view, which re-interprets EI as a collection of personality traits.&lt;ref name="Mikolajczak07"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mikolajczak | first1 = M. | last2 = Luminet | first2 = O. | last3 = Leroy | first3 = C. | last4 = Roy | first4 = E. | year = 2007 | title = Psychometric properties of the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire | url = | journal = Journal of Personality Assessment | volume = 88 | issue = 3| pages = 338–353 | doi=10.1080/00223890701333431| pmid = 17518555 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith08"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = L. | last2 = Ciarrochi | first2 = J. | last3 = Heaven | first3 = P.

== Criticisms of measurement ==

=== Ability model ===
[[File:Tom Reed speaks at NAVAIR’s “Mentoring at the Speed of Life” event.jpg|thumb|right|A speaker describes four stages of emotional intelligence: [[self-awareness]], [[social consciousness]], [[self-care]] and relationship management, as part of [[NAVAIR]]’s “Mentoring at the Speed of Life” event]]

====Measures conformity, not ability ====
One criticism of the works of Mayer and Salovey comes from a study by Roberts et al. (2001),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roberts | first1 = R.D. | last2 = Zeidner | first2 = M. | last3 = Matthews | first3 = G. | year = 2001 | title = Does emotional intelligence meet traditional standards for an intelligence? Some new data and conclusions | url = | journal = Emotion | volume = 1 | issue = 3| pages = 196–231 | doi=10.1037/1528-3542.1.3.196| pmid = 12934681 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which suggests that the EI, as measured by the MSCEIT, may only be measuring conformity. This argument is rooted in the MSCEIT's use of consensus-based assessment, and in the fact that scores on the MSCEIT are negatively distributed (meaning that its scores differentiate between people with low EI better than people with high EI).

==== Measures knowledge, not ability ====
Further criticism has been leveled by Brody (2004),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brody |first1=N |year=2004 |title=What cognitive intelligence is and what emotional intelligence is not |url=http://psychometriclab.com/Brody.pdf |journal=Psychological Inquiry |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=234–238 |doi=10.1207/s15327965pli1503_03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160207093225/http://psychometriclab.com/Brody.pdf |archivedate=2016-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; who claimed that unlike tests of cognitive ability, the MSCEIT "tests knowledge of emotions but not necessarily the ability to perform tasks that are related to the knowledge that is assessed". The main argument is that even though someone knows how he or she should behave in an emotionally laden situation, it doesn't necessarily follow that the person could actually carry out the reported behavior.

==== Measures personality and general intelligence ====
New research is surfacing that suggests that ability EI measures might be measuring personality in addition to general intelligence. These studies examined the multivariate effects of personality and intelligence on EI and also corrected estimates for measurement error (which is often not done in some validation studies)[cite source]. For example, a study by Schulte, Ree, Carretta (2004),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schulte | first1 = M. J. | last2 = Ree | first2 = M. J. | last3 = Carretta | first3 = T. R. | year = 2004 | title = Emotional intelligence: Not much more than g and personality | url = | = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 37 | issue = 5| pages = 1059–1068 | doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2003.11.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that general intelligence (measured with the Wonderlic Personnel Test), agreeableness (measured by the NEO-PI), as well as gender could reliably be used to predict the measure of EI ability.

They gave a multiple correlation (R) of .81 with the MSCEIT (perfect prediction would be 1). This result has been replicated by Fiori and Antonakis (2011),;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fiori | first1 = M. | last2 = Antonakis | first2 = J. | year = 2011 | title = The ability model of emotional intelligence: Searching for valid measures | url = https://serval.unil.ch/notice/serval:BIB_B46FDCF00E58| journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 50 | issue = 3| pages = 329–334 | doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2010.10.010 | type = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; they found a multiple R of .76 using Cattell’s "Culture Fair" intelligence test and the Big Five Inventory (BFI); significant covariates were intelligence (standardized beta = .39), agreeableness (standardized beta = .54), and openness (standardized beta = .46). Antonakis and Dietz (2011a),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Antonakis | first1 = J. | last2 = Dietz | first2 = J. | year = 2011a | title = Looking for Validity or Testing It?

§

=== Self-report measures susceptible to faking ===
More formally termed socially desirable responding (SDR), faking good is defined as a response pattern in which test-takers systematically represent themselves with an excessive positive bias (Paulhus, 2002). This bias has long been known to contaminate responses on personality inventories (Holtgraves, 2004; McFarland &amp; Ryan, 2000; Peebles &amp; Moore, 1998; Nichols &amp; Greene, 1997; Zerbe &amp; Paulhus, 1987), acting as a mediator of the relationships between self-report measures (Nichols &amp; Greene, 1997; Gangster et al., 1983).{{full citation needed|date=July 2012}}

It has been suggested that responding in a desirable way is a response set, which is a situational and temporary response pattern (Pauls &amp; Crost, 2004; Paulhus, 1991). This is contrasted with a response style, which is a more long-term trait-like quality. Considering the contexts some self-report EI inventories are used in (e.g., employment settings), the problems of response sets in high-stakes scenarios become clear (Paulhus &amp; Reid, 2001).

There are a few methods to prevent socially desirable responding on behavior inventories. Some researchers believe it is necessary to warn test-takers not to fake good before taking a personality test (e.g., McFarland, 2003). Some inventories use validity scales in order to determine the likelihood or consistency of the responses across all items.

=== Predictive power unsubstantiated ===
Landy&lt;ref name="landy"/&gt; distinguishes between the "commercial wing" and "the academic wing" of the EI movement, basing this distinction on the alleged predictive power of EI as seen by the two currents. According to Landy, the former makes expansive claims on the applied value of EI, while the latter is trying to warn users against these claims. As an example, Goleman (1998) asserts that "the most effective leaders are alike in one crucial way: they all have a high degree of what has come to be known as emotional intelligence. ...emotional intelligence is the sine qua non of leadership". In contrast, Mayer (1999) cautions "the popular literature's implication—that highly emotionally intelligent people possess an unqualified advantage in life—appears overly enthusiastic at present and unsubstantiated by reasonable scientific standards." Landy further reinforces this argument by noting that the data upon which these claims are based are held in "proprietary databases", which means they are unavailable to independent researchers for reanalysis, replication, or verification.&lt;ref name="landy"/&gt; Thus, the credibility of the findings cannot be substantiated in a scientific way, unless those datasets are made public and available for independent analysis.

In an academic exchange, Antonakis and Ashkanasy/Dasborough mostly agreed that researchers testing whether EI matters for leadership have not done so using robust research designs; therefore, currently there is no strong evidence showing that EI predicts leadership outcomes when accounting for personality and IQ.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Antonakis | first1 = J. | last2 = Ashkanasy | first2 = N. M. | last3 = Dasborough | first3 = M. | year = 2009 | title = Does leadership need emotional intelligence? | url = https://serval.unil.ch/notice/serval:BIB_F989E68B6F71| journal = The Leadership Quarterly | volume = 20 | issue = 2| pages = 247–261 | doi = 10.1016/j.leaqua.2009.01.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Antonakis argued that EI might not be needed for leadership effectiveness (he referred to this as the "curse of emotion" phenomenon, because leaders who are too sensitive to their and others' emotional states might have difficulty making decisions that would result in [[emotional labor]] for the leader or followers). A recently published meta-analysis seems to support the Antonakis position: In fact, Harms and Credé found that overall (and using data free from problems of common source and common methods), EI measures correlated only [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|ρ]] = 0.11 with measures of [[transformational leadership]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Harms | first1 = P.

Meta-analytic evidence confirms that self-reported emotional intelligence predicting job performance is due to mixed EI and trait EI measures' tapping into self-efficacy and self-rated performance, in addition to the domains of Neuroticism, Extraversion, Conscientiousness, and IQ.

=== NICHD pushes for consensus ===
The [[National Institute of Child Health and Human Development]] has recognized that because there are divisions about the topic of emotional intelligence, the mental health community needs to agree on some guidelines to describe good mental health and positive mental living conditions. In their section, "Positive Psychology and the Concept of Health", they explain. "Currently there are six competing models of positive health, which are based on concepts such as being above normal, character strengths and core virtues, developmental maturity, social-emotional intelligence, subjective well-being, and [[Psychological resilience|resilience]]. But these concepts define health in philosophical rather than empirical terms. Dr. [Lawrence] Becker suggested the need for a consensus on the concept of positive psychological health...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Nitkin |first1=Ralph |last2=Harris |first2=Meredith |date=August 29, 2006 |title=National Advisory Board on Medical Rehabilitation Research: Meeting for Minutes for December 2–3, 2004 |url=http://www.nichd.nih.gov/about/overview/advisory/nmrrab/minutes/2004dec.cfm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716163703/http://www.nichd.nih.gov/about/overview/advisory/nmrrab/minutes/2004dec.cfm |archivedate=July 16, 2009 |publisher=[[National Institute of Child Health and Human Development]] |accessdate=April 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bullying]] is [[abusive]] [[social interaction]] between peers which can include [[aggression]], [[harassment]], and [[violence]]. Bullying is typically repetitive and enacted by those who are in a position of [[Abusive power and control|power]] over the victim. A growing body of research illustrates a significant relationship between bullying and emotional intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Approach to bullying and victimization|journal = Canadian Family Physician|date = 2009-04-01|issn = 0008-350X|pmc = 2669002|pmid = 19366941|pages = 356–360|volume = 55|issue = 4|first = Jennifer|last = Lamb|first2 = Debra J.|last2 = Pepler|first3 = Wendy|last3 = Craig}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The relationship between bullying, victimization, trait emotional intelligence, self-efficacy and empathy among preadolescents|journal = Social Psychology of Education|date = 2011-07-26|issn = 1381-2890|pages = 41–58|volume = 15|issue = 1|doi = 10.1007/s11218-011-9168-9|first = Constantinos M.|last = Kokkinos|first2 = Eirini|last2 = Kipritsi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Brief report: Emotional intelligence, victimisation and bullying in adolescents|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014019711100025X|journal = Journal of Adolescence|date = 2012-02-01|pages = 207–211|volume = 35|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/j.adolescence.2011.03.002|pmid = 21470670|first = Justine|last = Lomas|first2 = Con|last2 = Stough|first3 = Karen|last3 = Hansen|first4 = Luke A.|last4 = Downey}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also have shown that emotional intelligence is a key factor in the analysis of cases of cybervictimization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rey|first=Lourdes|last2=Quintana-Orts|first2=Cirenia|last3=Mérida-López|first3=Sergio|last4=Extremera|first4=Natalio|date=2018-07-01|title=Emotional intelligence and peer cybervictimisation in adolescents: Gender as moderator|journal=Comunicar|language=es|volume=26|issue=56|pages=09–18|doi=10.3916/c56-2018-01|issn=1134-3478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

by demonstrating a relevant impact on health and social adaptation.   Emotional intelligence (EI) is a set of abilities related to the understanding, use and management of emotion as it relates to one's self and others. Mayer et al., (2008) defines the dimensions of overall EI as: "accurately perceiving emotion, using emotions to facilitate thought, understanding emotion, and managing emotion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mayer | first1 = J.D. | last2 = Roberts | first2 = R.D | last3 = Barasade | first3 = S.G. | year = 2008 | title = Human abilities: Emotional intelligence | url = | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 59 | issue = | pages = 507–536 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.59.103006.093646 | pmid = 17937602 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept combines emotional and intellectual processes.&lt;ref name="Tolegenova"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tolegenova | first1 = A.A. | last2 = Jakupov | first2 = S.M. | last3 = Cheung Chung | first3 = Man | last4 = Saduova | first4 = S. | last5 = Jakupov | first5 = M.S | year = 2012 | title = A theoretical formation of emotional intelligence and childhood trauma among adolescents | journal = Procedia – Social and Behavioral Sciences | volume = 69 | issue = | pages = 1891–1894 | doi = 10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.12.142 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lower emotional intelligence appears to be related to involvement in bullying, as the bully and/or the victim of bullying. EI seems to play an important role in both bullying behavior and [[victimization]] in bullying; given that EI is illustrated to be malleable, EI education could greatly improve bullying prevention and intervention initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mckenna | first1 = J. | last2 = Webb | first2 = J. | year = 2013 | title = Emotional intelligence | url = | journal = British Journal of Occupational Therapy | volume = 76 | issue = 12| page = 560 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research of EI and [[job performance]] shows mixed results: a positive relation has been found in some of the studies, while in others there was no relation or an inconsistent one.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; This led researchers Cote and Miners (2006)&lt;ref name="Côté 2006" /&gt; to offer a compensatory model between EI and IQ, that posits that the association between EI and job performance becomes more positive as cognitive intelligence decreases, an idea first proposed in the context of academic performance (Petrides, Frederickson, &amp; Furnham, 2004). The results of the former study supported the compensatory model: employees with low IQ get higher task performance and organizational citizenship behavior directed at the organization, the higher their EI. It has also been observed that there is no significant link between emotional intelligence and work attitude behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Relojo|first1=D.|last2=Pilao|first2=S.J.|last3=Dela Rosa|first3=R.|title=From passion to emotion: Emotional quotient as predictor of work attitude behavior among faculty member|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|date=2015|volume=8|issue=4|pages=1–10|url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1098164.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent study suggests that EI is not necessarily a universally positive trait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Farh|first=C. C.|author2=Seo, Tesluk|title=Emotional Intelligence, Teamwork Effectiveness, and Job Performance: The Moderating Role of Job Context|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|date=March 5, 2012|volume=97|issue=4|doi=10.1037/a0027377|pages=890–900|pmid=22390388}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found a negative correlation between EI and managerial work demands; while under low levels of managerial work demands, they found a negative relationship between EI and teamwork effectiveness. An explanation for this may suggest gender differences in EI, as women tend to score higher levels than men.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; This furthers the idea that job context plays a role in the relationships between EI, teamwork effectiveness, and job performance. Another find was discussed in a study that assessed a possible link between EI and entrepreneurial behaviors and success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ahmetoglu|first=Gorkan|author2=Leutner, Franziska|author3=Chamorro-Premuzic, Tomas|title=EQ-nomics: Understanding the relationship between individual differences in trait emotional intelligence and entrepreneurship|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|date=December 2011|volume=51|issue=8|pages=1028–1033|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2011.08.016&lt;!--pmid=893295016--&gt;|url=http://www.drtomascp.com/uploads/EQNomics_PAID_2011.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101125012/http://www.drtomascp.com/uploads/EQNomics_PAID_2011.pdf|archivedate=2013-11-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although studies between emotional intelligence (EI) and job performance has shown mixed results of high and low correlations, EI is undeniably better predictor than most of the hiring methods commonly used in companies, such as [[Recommendation letter|letter of references]], [[cover letter]], among others. By 2008, 147 companies and consulting firms in U.S had developed programmes that involved EI for training and hiring employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Joseph|first=Dana L.|last2=Jin|first2=Jing|last3=Newman|first3=Daniel A.|last4=O’Boyle|first4=Ernest H.|title=Why does self-reported emotional intelligence predict job performance?

These findings may contribute organisations in different ways. For instance, employees high on EI would be more aware of their own emotions and from others, which in turn, could lead companies to better profits and less unnecessary expenses. This is especially important for expatriate managers, who have to deal with mixed emotions and feelings, while adapting to a new working culture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Moreover, employees high in EI show more confidence in their roles, which allow them to face demanding tasks positively.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sy|first=Thomas|last2=Tram|first2=Susanna|last3=O’Hara|first3=Linda A.|date=2006-06-01|title=Relation of employee and manager emotional intelligence to job satisfaction and performance|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001879105001260|journal=Journal of Vocational Behavior|volume=68|issue=3|pages=461–473|doi=10.1016/j.jvb.2005.10.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a popular science book by the journalist Daniel Goleman, emotional intelligence accounts for more career success than IQ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goleman|first1=Daniel|title=Emotional Intelligence|date=1994|publisher=Bantam Books|isbn=9780747526254}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, other studies argued that employees high on EI perform substantially better than employees low in EI. This measured by self-reports and different work performance indicators, such as wages, promotions and salary increase.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Law|first=Kenneth S.|last2=Wong|first2=Chi-Sum|last3=Song|first3=Lynda J.|title=The Construct and Criterion Validity of Emotional Intelligence and Its Potential Utility for Management Studies|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|volume=89|issue=3|pages=483–496|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.89.3.483|pmid=15161407|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lopes and his colleagues (2006),&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lopes|first=Paulo N.|last2=Grewal|first2=Daisy|last3=Kadis|first3=Jessica|last4=Gall|first4=Michelle|last5=Salovey|first5=Peter|date=2006-01-01|title=Evidence that emotional intelligence is related to job performance and affect and attitudes at work|journal=Psicothema|volume=18 Suppl|pages=132–138|issn=0214-9915|pmid=17295970}}&lt;/ref&gt; EI contributes to develop strong and positive relationships with co-workers and perform efficiently in work teams. This benefits performance of workers by providing emotional support and instrumental resources needed to succeed in their roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seibert|first=Scott E.|last2=Kraimer|first2=Maria L.|last3=Liden|first3=Robert C.|date=2001-01-01|title=A Social Capital Theory of Career Success|jstor=3069452|journal=The Academy of Management Journal|volume=44|issue=2|pages=219–237|doi=10.2307/3069452}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, emotional intelligent employees have better resources to cope with stressing situations and demanding tasks, which enable them to outperform in those situations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; For instance, Law et al. (2004)&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; found that EI was the best predictor of job performance beyond general cognitive ability among IT scientist in computer company in China. Similarly, Sy, Tram, and O’Hara (2006)&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; found that EI was associated positively with job performance in employees from a food service company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vratskikh|first=Ivan|last2=Masa'deh|first2=Ra'ed (Moh’dTaisir)|last3=Al-Lozi|first3=Musa|last4=Maqableh|first4=Mahmoud|date=2016-01-25|title=The Impact of Emotional Intelligence on Job Performance via the Mediating Role of Job Satisfaction|url=http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/ijbm/article/view/55548|journal=International Journal of Business and Management|volume=11|issue=2|pages=69|doi=10.5539/ijbm.v11n2p69|issn=1833-8119|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416060903/http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/ijbm/article/view/55548|archivedate=2016-04-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the job performance – emotional intelligence correlation is important to consider the effects of [[Managing up and managing down|managing up]], which refers to the good and positive relationship between the employee and his/her supervisor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hbr.org/2015/01/what-everyone-should-know-about-managing-up|title=What Everyone Should Know About Managing Up|website=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2016-04-19|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426042345/https://hbr.org/2015/01/what-everyone-should-know-about-managing-up|archivedate=2016-04-26|df=|date=2015-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous research found that quality of this relationship could interfere in the results of the subjective rating of job performance evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Janssen|first=Onne|last2=Yperen|first2=Nico W. Van|date=2004-06-01|title=Employees' Goal Orientations, the Quality of Leader-Member Exchange, and the Outcomes of Job Performance and Job Satisfaction|url=http://amj.aom.org/content/47/3/368|journal=Academy of Management Journal|volume=47|issue=3|pages=368–384|doi=10.2307/20159587|issn=0001-4273|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321034021/http://amj.aom.org/content/47/3/368|archivedate=2015-03-21|df=|jstor=20159587|hdl=2066/64290}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emotional intelligent employees devote more of their working time on managing their relationship with supervisors. Hence, the likelihood of  obtaining better results on performance evaluation is greater for employees high in EI than for employees with low EI.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Based on theoretical and methodological approaches, EI measures are categorized in three main streams: (1) stream 1: ability-based measures (e.g. MSCEIT), (2) stream 2: self-reports of abilities measures (e.g. SREIT, SUEIT and WLEIS) and (3) stream 3: mixed-models (e.g. AES, ECI, EI questionnaire, EIS, EQ-I and GENOS), which include measures of EI and traditional social skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ashkanasy|first=Neal M.|last2=Daus|first2=Catherine S.|date=2005-06-01|title=Rumors of the death of emotional intelligence in organizational behavior are vastly exaggerated|journal=Journal of Organizational Behavior|volume=26|issue=4|pages=441–452|doi=10.1002/job.320|issn=1099-1379|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; O’Boyle Jr. and his colleagues (2011)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Boyle|first=Ernest H.|last2=Humphrey|first2=Ronald H.|last3=Pollack|first3=Jeffrey M.|last4=Hawver|first4=Thomas H.|last5=Story|first5=Paul A.|date=2011-07-01|title=The relation between emotional intelligence and job performance: A meta-analysis|journal=Journal of Organizational Behavior|volume=32|issue=5|pages=788–818|doi=10.1002/job.714|issn=1099-1379|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that the three EI streams together had a positive correlation of 0.28 with job performance. Similarly, each of EI streams independently obtained a positive correlation of 0.24, 0.30 and 0.28, respectively. Stream 2 and 3 showed an incremental validity for predicting job performance over and above personality ([[Big Five personality traits|Five Factor model]]) and [[G factor (psychometrics)|general cognitive ability]]. Both, stream 2 and 3 were the second most important predictor of job performance below [[G factor (psychometrics)|general cognitive ability.]] Stream 2 explained 13.6% of the total variance; whereas stream 3, explained 13.2%. In order to examine the reliability of these findings, a publication bias analysis was developed. Results indicated that studies on EI-job performance correlation prior to 2010 do not present substantial evidences to suggest the presence of [[publication bias]].

Despite the validity of previous findings, some researchers still question whether EI – job performance correlation makes a real impact on business strategies. They argue that popularity of emotional intelligence’s studies is due to media advertising, rather than objective scientific findings.&lt;ref name="Côté 2006"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Côté|first=Stéphane|last2=Miners|first2=Christopher T. H.|date=2006-01-01|title=Emotional Intelligence, Cognitive Intelligence, and Job Performance|jstor=20109857|journal=Administrative Science Quarterly|volume=51|issue=1|pages=1–28|doi=10.2189/asqu.51.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, it is mentioned that relationship between job performance and EI is not as strong as suggested. This relationship requires the presence of other constructs to rise important outcomes. For instance, previous studies found that EI is positively associated with teamwork effectiveness under job contexts of high managerial work demands, which improves job performance. This is due to activation of strong emotions during performance on this job context. In this scenario, emotional intelligent individuals show a better set of resources to succeed on their roles. However, individuals with high EI show a similar level of performance than non-emotional intelligent employees under different job contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Farh|first=Crystal I. C.

Moon and Hur (2011)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moon|first=Tae Won|last2=Hur|first2=Won-Moo|date=2011-09-01|title=Emotional Intelligence, Emotional Exhaustion, And Job Performance|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/sbp/sbp/2011/00000039/00000008/art00008?token=004e15b5ca926383a4b3b2570507b457a2438383b40664c2a726e2d58464340592f3f3b575b18b|journal=Social Behavior and Personality: An International Journal|volume=39|issue=8|pages=1087–1096|doi=10.2224/sbp.2011.39.8.1087|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624215721/http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/sbp/sbp/2011/00000039/00000008/art00008?token=004e15b5ca926383a4b3b2570507b457a2438383b40664c2a726e2d58464340592f3f3b575b18b|archivedate=2016-06-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that [[emotional exhaustion]] (“burn-out”) significantly influences the job performance – EI relationship. [[Emotional exhaustion]] showed a negative association with two components of EI (optimism and social skills). This association impacted negatively to job performance, as well. Hence, job performance – EI relationship is stronger under contexts of high emotional exhaustion or burn-out; in other words, employees with high levels of optimism and social skills possess better resources to outperform when facing high [[emotional exhaustion]] contexts.

=== Health ===
A 2007 meta-analysis of 44 effect sizes by Schutte found that emotional intelligence was associated with better mental and physical health. Particularly, trait EI had the stronger association with mental and physical health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/216626194|title=A meta-analytic investigation of the relationship between emotional intelligence and health|author=Schutte|date=1 April 2007|website=ResearchGate|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208060534/http://www.researchgate.net/publication/216626194_A_meta-analytic_investigation_of_the_relationship_between_emotional_intelligence_and_health|archivedate=8 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was replicated again in 2010 by researcher Alexandra Martin  who found trait EI as a strong predictor for health after conducting a meta-analysis based on 105 effect sizes and 19,815 participants. This meta-analysis also indicated that this line of research reached enough sufficiency and stability in concluding EI as a positive predictor for health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222693042|title=A comprehensive meta-analysis of the relationship between Emotional Intelligence and health|author=Alexandra Martins|date=1 October 2010|website=ResearchGate|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208045106/http://www.researchgate.net/publication/222693042_A_comprehensive_meta-analysis_of_the_relationship_between_Emotional_Intelligence_and_health|archivedate=8 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-esteem and drug dependence ===
A 2012 study cross examined emotional intelligence, [[self-esteem]] and [[marijuana]] dependence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nehra|first=D. K.|author2=Sharma, Mushtaq, Sharma, Sharma, Nehra|title=Emotional intelligence and self esteem in cannabis abusers|journal=[[Journal of the Indian Academy of Applied Psychology]] |date=July 2012|volume=38|issue=2|pages=385–393}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of a sample of 200, 100 of whom were dependent on cannabis and the other 100 emotionally healthy, the dependent group scored exceptionally low on EI when compared to the control group. They also found that the dependent group also scored low on self-esteem when compared to the control.

Another study in 2010 examined whether or not low levels of EI had a relationship with the degree of [[Substance dependence|drug]] and [[alcoholism|alcohol]] addiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=Chiu|author2=Chiu, Edmond|author3=Neill, Lloyd|author4=Tobin, Juliet|author5=Reid, John|title=Is low emotional intelligence a primary causal factor in drug and alcohol addiction?|journal=Australian Academic Press (Bowen Hills, QLD, Australia)|date=16 Jan 2012|pages=91–101|url=http://0-search.proquest.com.helin.uri.edu/docview/916528622?accountid=28991}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the assessment of 103 residents in a drug rehabilitation center, they examined their EI along with other psychosocial factors in a one-month interval of treatment. They found that participants' EI scores improved as their levels of addiction lessened as part of their treatment.

== Utilization ==
It has been noted that having EI as a skill can increase one's own [https://eclass.teicrete.gr/modules/document/file.php/IP-ERLSF116/Mayer-Salovey.1993-libre.pdf well being]. In other words, individuals who are conscious of the emotions of themselves and others have the privilege of enhancing relationships. It also allows people to see the multiple perspectives of a given situation, and acknowledge others' feelings about the event.

'''Environmental assessment'''&lt;section begin=overview /&gt;&lt;!--This paragraph is transcluded to [[Environmental law]] --&gt; ('''EA''') is the assessment of the [[environmental impact|environmental consequences]] (positive and negative) of a plan, policy, program, or actual projects prior to the decision to move forward with the proposed action. In this context, the term "'''environmental impact assessment'''" ('''EIA''') is usually used when applied to actual projects by individuals or companies and the term "[[strategic environmental assessment]]" (SEA) applies to policies, plans and programmes most often proposed by organs of state.&lt;ref&gt;MacKinnon, A. J., Duinker, P. N., Walker, T. R. (2018). The Application of Science in Environmental Impact Assessment. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eccleston, Charles H. (2011).

Chapter 5. {{ISBN|978-1439828731}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental assessments may be governed by rules of [[Administrative law|administrative procedure]] regarding public participation and documentation of decision making, and may be subject to judicial review. &lt;section end=overview /&gt;&lt;!--This paragraph is transcluded to [[Environmental law]]. Please do not delete this code --&gt;

The purpose of the assessment is to ensure that decision makers consider the environmental impacts when deciding whether or not to proceed with a project. The International Association for Impact Assessment (IAIA) defines an environmental impact assessment as "the process of identifying, predicting, evaluating and mitigating the [[Biophysics|biophysical]], social, and other relevant effects of development proposals prior to major decisions being taken and commitments made".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaia.org/publicdocuments/special-publications/Principles%20of%20IA_web.pdf |title=Principle of Environmental Impact Assessment Best Practice |publisher=International Association for Impact Assessment |date=1999 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507084339/http://www.iaia.org/publicdocuments/special-publications/Principles%20of%20IA_web.pdf |archivedate=2012-05-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; EIAs are unique in that they do not require adherence to a predetermined environmental outcome, but rather they require decision makers to [[environmental full-cost accounting|account for environmental values]] in their decisions and to justify those decisions in light of detailed environmental studies and public comments on the potential environmental impacts.&lt;ref&gt;Holder, J., (2004), Environmental Assessment: The Regulation of Decision Making, Oxford University Press, New York; For a comparative discussion of the elements of various domestic EIA systems, see Christopher Wood Environmental Impact Assessment: A Comparative Review (2 ed, Prentice Hall, Harlow, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Environmental impact assessments commenced in the 1960s, as part of increasing [[environmental awareness]].&lt;ref group=notes&gt;The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]  was established on 2 December 1970, in response to elevated concern about [[environmental pollution]].&lt;/ref&gt; EIAs involved a technical evaluation intended to contribute to more objective decision making. In the United States, environmental impact assessments obtained formal status in 1969, with enactment of the [[National Environmental Policy Act]]. EIAs have been used increasingly around the world. The number of "Environmental Assessments" filed every year "has vastly overtaken the number of more rigorous [[Environmental Impact Statement]]s (EIS)."{{sfn|Clark|Canter|1997|p=199}} An Environmental Assessment is a "mini-EIS designed to provide sufficient information to allow the agency to decide whether the preparation of a full-blown Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is necessary."{{sfn|Rychlak|Case|2010|p=111-120}}{{sfn|Kershner|2011}}
EIA is an activity that is done to find out the impact that would be done before development will occur.

== Methods ==
General and industry specific assessment methods are available including:

* ''Industrial products'' – Product environmental [[life cycle analysis]] (LCA) is used for identifying and measuring the impact of industrial products on the environment. These EIAs consider activities related to extraction of raw materials, ancillary materials, equipment; production, use, disposal and ancillary equipment.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel, S., Tsoulfas, G., Pappis, C., &amp; Rachaniotis, N. (2004) Aggregating and evaluating the results of different Environmental Impact Assessment methods Ecological indicators 4:125–138&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Genetically modified plants'' – Specific methods available to perform EIAs of [[genetically modified organisms]] include GMP-RAM and INOVA.&lt;ref&gt;Hitzschky, K., &amp; Silviera, J. (2009) A proposed impact assessment method for genetically modified plants (As-GMP method) Environmental Impact Assessment review 29: 348–368&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Fuzzy logic]]'' – EIA methods need measurement data to estimate values of impact indicators. However, many of the environment impacts cannot be quantified, e.g. landscape quality, lifestyle quality and social acceptance. Instead information from similar EIAs, expert judgment and community sentiment are employed. Approximate reasoning methods known as fuzzy logic can be used.&lt;ref&gt;Peche, R., &amp; Rodriguez, E., (2009) Environmental impact Assessment procedure: A new approach based on Fuzzy logic Environmental Impact Assessment review 29:275–283&lt;/ref&gt; A fuzzy arithmetic approach has also been proposed&lt;ref&gt;Duarte O.

== Follow-up ==
At the end of the project, an audit evaluates the accuracy of the EIA by comparing actual to predicted impacts. The objective is to make future EIAs more valid and effective. Two primary considerations are:
* ''Scientific'' – to examine the accuracy of predictions and explain errors
* ''Management'' – to assess the success of mitigation in reducing impacts

Audits can be performed either as a rigorous assessment of the [[null hypothesis]] or with a simpler approach comparing what actually occurred against the predictions in the EIA document.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, L., (1998), A Practical Method for Environmental Impact Assessment Audits Environ Impact Assess Rev 18: 59–71&lt;/ref&gt;

After an EIA, the [[Precautionary principle|precautionary]] and [[polluter pays principle]]s may be applied to decide whether to reject, modify or require [[strict liability]] or [[insurance]] coverage to a project, based on predicted harms.

The [[Hydropower Sustainability Assessment Protocol]] is a sector specific method for checking the quality of Environmental and Social assessments and management plans.

== Around the world ==

=== Australia ===

The history of EIA in Australia could be linked to the enactment of the [[National Environmental Policy Act|U.S. National Environment Policy Act]] (NEPA) in 1970, which made the preparation of environmental impact statements a requirement. In Australia, one might say that the EIA procedures were introduced at a State Level prior to that of the Commonwealth (Federal), with a majority of the states having divergent views to the Commonwealth. One of the pioneering states was New South Wales, whose State Pollution Control Commission issued EIA guidelines in 1974. At a Commonwealth (i.e. Federal) level, this was followed by passing of the ''Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974'' (Cth) in 1974. The ''Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999'' (Cth) (EPBC Act) superseded the ''Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974'' (Cth) and is the current central piece for EIA in Australia on a Commonwealth (i.e. Federal) level. An important point to note is that this federal legislation does not override the validity of the States or Territories environmental and development assessments and approvals; rather the EPBC Act runs as a parallel to the State/Territory Systems.&lt;ref name="Elliott"&gt;Elliott, M. &amp; Thomas, I. (2009), "Environment Impact Assessment in Australia: Theory and Practice, 5th Edn, Federation Press, Sydney"&lt;/ref&gt; Overlap between federal and state requirements is addressed via bilateral agreements or one-off accreditation of state processes, as provided for in the EPBC Act.

==== The Commonwealth Level ====

The EPBC Act provides a legal framework to protect and manage nationally and internationally important flora, fauna, ecological communities and heritage places-defined in the EPBC Act as matters of ‘National Environmental Significance’. Following are the nine matters of ‘National Environmental Significance’ to which the EPBC Act applies:&lt;ref name="department" /&gt;

* World Heritage properties;
* National Heritage places;
* Wetlands of international importance (listed under the Ramsar Convention);
* Listed threatened species and ecological communities;
* Migratory species protected under international agreements;
* Commonwealth marine areas;
* the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park;
* Nuclear actions (including uranium mining); and
* Water resources, in relation with coal seam gas development and large coal mining development.

In addition to this, the EPBC Act aims at providing a streamlined national assessment and approval process for activities. These activities could be by the Commonwealth, or its agents, anywhere in the world or activities on Commonwealth land; and activities that are listed as having a ‘significant impact’ on matters of ‘national environment significance'.&lt;ref name="department"&gt;{{citation|publisher=The Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts|location=Australia|title=The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/epbc/|accessdate=9 September 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007230525/http://www.environment.gov.au/epbc/|archivedate=7 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EPBC Act comes into play when a person (a ‘proponent') wants an action (often called a ‘proposal’ or ‘project’) assessed for environmental impacts under the EPBC Act, he or she must refer the project to the Department of the Environment and Energy (Commonwealth). This ‘referral’ is then released to the public, as well as relevant state, territory and Commonwealth ministers, for comment on whether the project is likely to have a significant impact on matters of national environmental significance.&lt;ref name="department" /&gt; The Department of the Environment and Energy assess the process and makes recommendation to the minister or the delegate for the feasibility. The final discretion on the decision remains of the minister, which is not solely based on matters of ‘national environmental significance’ but also the consideration of social and economic impact of the project.&lt;ref name="department" /&gt;

The Australian Government Minister for the Environment and Energy cannot intervene in a proposal if it has no significant impact on one of the eight matters of ‘national environmental significance’ despite the fact that there may be other undesirable environmental impacts.&lt;ref name="department" /&gt; This is primarily due to the division of powers between the States and the Federal government and due to which the Australian Government environment minister cannot overturn a state decision.

There are strict civil and criminal penalties for the breach of EPBC Act. Depending on the kind of breach, civil penalty (maximum) may go up to $550,000 for an individual and $5.5 million for a body corporate, or for criminal penalty (maximum) of seven years imprisonment and/or penalty of $46,200.&lt;ref name="department" /&gt;

==== The State and Territory Level ====

===== Australian Capital Territory (ACT) =====

EIA provisions within Ministerial Authorities in the ACT are found in the Chapters 7 and 8 of the ''Planning and Development Act 2007'' (ACT). EIA in ACT was previously administered with the help of Part 4 of the Land (Planning and Environment) Act 1991 (Land Act) and Territory Plan (plan for land-use).&lt;ref name="Elliott" /&gt;
Note that some EIA may occur in the ACT on Commonwealth land under the EPBC Act (Cth). Further provisions of the ''Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988'' (Cth) may also be applicable particularly to national land and "designated areas".

===== New South Wales (NSW) =====

In New South Wales, the ''Environment Planning and Assessment Act 1979'' (EP&amp;A Act) establishes two pathways for EIA. The first is under Division 5.2 of the EP&amp;A Act, which provides for EIA of 'State Significant Infrastructure' projects (from June 2011, this Part replaced the previous Part 3A, which previously covered EIA of major projects). The second is under Part 4 of the EP&amp;A Act dealing with development assessments for local, regional, and State Significant Developments (other than State Significant Infrastructure).&lt;ref name="Elliott" /&gt;

===== Northern Territory (NT) =====
The EIA process in Northern Territory is chiefly administered under the Environmental Assessment Act (EAA).&lt;ref&gt;The Northern Territory Government, viewed 10 September 2010,&lt;/ref&gt; Although EAA is the primary tool for EIA in Northern Territory, there are further provisions for proposals in the Inquiries Act 1985 (NT).&lt;ref name="Elliott" /&gt;

=====Queensland (QLD)=====
There are four main EIA processes in Queensland.&lt;ref name=Defenders&gt;The Environment Defenders, viewed 10 September 2010, [http://www.edo.org.au/edoqld/edoqld/factsheets/factsheet11%2009.07.pdf EDO factsheet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716023121/http://www.edo.org.au/edoqld/edoqld/factsheets/factsheet11%2009.07.pdf |date=2011-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, under the Integrated Planning Act 1997 (IPA) for development projects other than mining. Secondly, under the Chapter 3 of the ''Environmental Protection Act 1994'' (Qld) (EP Act) for some mining and petroleum activities. Thirdly, under the ''State Development and Public Works Organisation Act 1971'' (Qld) (State Development Act) for ‘significant projects’. Finally, under the ''Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999'' (Cth) for ‘controlled actions’.&lt;ref name="Defenders" /&gt;

'''South Australia (SA)'''

The local governing tool for EIA in South Australia is the ''Development Act 1993'' (SA). There are three levels of assessment possible under the Act in the form of an environment impact statement (EIS), a public environmental report (PER) or a Development Report (DR).&lt;ref name="Elliott" /&gt;

=====Tasmania (TAS)=====
In Tasmania, an integrated system of legislation is used to govern development and approval process, this system is a mixture of the E''nvironmental Management and Pollution Control Act 1994'' (Tas) (EMPC Act), ''Land Use Planning and Approvals Act 1993'' (Tas) (LUPA Act), ''State Policies and Projects Act 1993'' (Tas) (SPPA), and ''Resource Management and Planning Appeals Tribunal Act 1993'' (Tas).&lt;ref name="Elliott" /&gt;

=====Victoria (VIC)=====
The EIA process in Victoria is intertwined with the ''[[Environment Effects Act 1978]]'' (Vic) and the Ministerial Guidelines for Assessment of Environmental Effects (made under the s 10 of the EE Act).&lt;ref&gt;The Law Handbook, viewed 9 September 2010,&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Western Australia (WA)=====
Part 4 of the ''Environmental Protection Act 1986'' (WA) provides the legislative framework for the EIA process in Western Australia.&lt;ref&gt;The Government of Western Australia, viewed 9 September 2010,&lt;/ref&gt; The EPA Act oversees the planning and development proposals and assesses their likely impacts on the environment.

===Canada===
In ''Friends of the Oldman River Society v. Canada (Minister of Transportation)'',{{harv|SCC|1992}} [[Gérard La Forest|La Forest J]] of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] described environmental impact assessment in terms of the proper scope of federal jurisdiction with respect to environments matters,{{quotation|"Environmental impact assessment is, in its simplest form, a planning tool that is now generally regarded as an integral component of sound decision-making."{{sfn|SCC|1992}}}}
[[Gérard La Forest|Supreme Court Justice La Forest]] cited {{harv|Cotton|Emond|1981|245}}, "The basic concepts behind environmental assessment are simply stated: (1) early identification and evaluation of all potential environmental consequences of a proposed undertaking; (2) decision making that both guarantees the adequacy of this process and reconciles, to the greatest extent possible, the proponent’s development desires with environmental protection and preservation."&lt;ref name="Cotton1981"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Cotton |last1=Roger|first2=D. Paul |last2=Emond|title=Environmental Impact Assessment|editor=John Swaigen|series=Environmental Rights in Canada|location=Toronto, Ontario|publisher=Butterworths|year=1981 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

La Forest referred to {{harv|Jeffrey|1989||loc= 1.2,1.4}} and {{harv|Emond|1978|p=5}} who described "...environmental assessments as a planning tool with both an information-gathering and a decision-making component" that provide "...an objective basis for granting or denying approval for a proposed development."&lt;ref name="Jeffrey1989"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jeffery |first=Michael I.|title=Environmental Approvals in Canada|location=Toronto, Ontario|publisher=Butterworths|year=1989 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Emond1978"&gt;{{cite book|last=Emond |first=D.

===China===
The Environmental Impact Assessment Law (EIA Law) requires that an environmental impact assessment be completed prior to project construction. However, if a developer completely ignores this requirement and builds a project without submitting an environmental impact statement, the only penalty is that the environmental protection bureau (EPB) may require the developer to do a make-up environmental assessment. If the developer does not complete this make-up assessment within the designated time, only then is the EPB authorized to fine the developer. Even so, the possible fine is capped at a maximum of about US$25,000, a fraction of the overall cost of most major projects. The lack of more stringent enforcement mechanisms has resulted in a significant percentage of projects not completing legally required environmental impact assessments prior to construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Wang| first=Alex| authorlink=| coauthors=| title=Environmental protection in China: the role of law| work=| publisher=| date=2007-02-05| url=http://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/745-Environmental-protection-in-China-the-role-of-law| format=| doi=| accessdate=| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516123917/http://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/745-Environmental-protection-in-China-the-role-of-law| archivedate=2012-05-16| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

China's [[State Environmental Protection Administration]] (SEPA) used the legislation to halt 30 projects in 2004, including three hydro-power plants under the [[Three Gorges]] Project Company. Although one month later (Note as a point of reference, that the typical EIA for a major project in the USA takes one to two years.), most of the 30 halted projects resumed their construction, reportedly having passed the environmental assessment, the fact that these key projects' construction was ever suspended was notable.

A joint investigation by SEPA and the Ministry of Land and Resources in 2004 showed that 30–40% of the mining construction projects went through the procedure of environment impact assessment as required, while in some areas only 6–7% did so. This partly explains why China has witnessed so many mining accidents in recent years.

SEPA alone cannot guarantee the full enforcement of environmental laws and regulations, observed Professor [[Wang Canfa]], director of the centre to help environmental victims at [[China University of Political Science and Law]]. In fact, according to Wang, the rate of China's environmental laws and regulations that are actually enforced is estimated at barely 10%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Egypt ===
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)
EIA is implemented in Egypt under the umbrella of the Ministry of state for environmental affairs. The Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency (EEAA) is responsible for the EIA services.

In June 1997, the responsibility of Egypt's first full-time Minister of State for Environmental Affairs was assigned as stated in the Presidential Decree no.275/1997. From thereon, the new ministry has focused, in close collaboration with the national and international development partners, on defining environmental policies, setting priorities and implementing initiatives within a context of sustainable development.

According to the Law 4/1994 for the Protection of the Environment, the Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency (EEAA) was restructured with the new mandate to substitute the institution initially established in 1982. At the central level, EEAA represents the executive arm of the Ministry.

The purpose of EIA is to ensure the protection and conservation of the environment and natural resources including human health aspects against uncontrolled development. The long-term objective is to ensure a sustainable economic development that meets present needs without compromising future generations ability to meet their own needs. EIA is an important tool in the integrated environmental management approach.

EIA must be performed for new establishments or projects and for expansions or renovations of existing establishments according to the Law for the Environment.

In 2001, the issue was enlarged to the assessment of plans and programmes by the so-called ''[[Strategic Environmental Assessment|Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA)]] Directive'' (2001/42/EC), which is now in force.&lt;ref name="watson" /&gt;
Under the EU directive, an EIA must provide certain information to comply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001L0042:EN:HTML|title=EUR-Lex – 32001L0042 – EN|author=|date=|website=eur-lex.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are seven key areas that are required:
# Description of the project
#* Description of actual project and site description
#* Break the project down into its key components, i.e. construction, operations, decommissioning
#* For each component list all of the sources of environmental disturbance
#* For each component all the inputs and outputs must be listed, e.g., [[air pollution]], noise, [[hydrology]]
# Alternatives that have been considered
#* Examine alternatives that have been considered
#* Example: in a [[biomass]] power station, will the fuel be sourced locally or nationally?
# Description of the environment
#* List of all aspects of the environment that may be affected by the development
#* Example: populations, [[fauna]], flora, air, soil, water, humans, landscape, cultural heritage
#* This section is best carried out with the help of local experts, e.g. the [[RSPB]] in the UK
# Description of the significant effects on the environment
#* The word significant is crucial here as the definition can vary
#* 'Significant' must be defined
#* The most frequent method used here is use of the [[Leopold matrix]]
#* The matrix is a tool used in the systematic examination of potential interactions
#* Example: in a windfarm development a significant impact may be collisions with birds
# Mitigation
#* This is where EIA is most useful
#* Once section 4 is complete, it is obvious where impacts are greatest
#* Using this information ways to avoid negative impacts should be developed
#* Best working with the developer with this section as they know the project best
#* Using the windfarm example again, construction could be out of bird nesting seasons.  Or removal of hardstanding on a potentially contaminated land site, out of the rainy season.
# Non-technical summary (EIS)
#* The EIA is in the public domain and be used in the decision making process
#* It is important that the information is available to the public
#* This section is a summary that does not include jargon or complicated diagrams
#* It should be understood by the informed lay-person
# Lack of know-how/technical difficulties
#* This section is to advise any areas of weakness in knowledge
#* It can be used to focus areas of future research
#* Some developers see the EIA as a starting block for poor environmental management

====Annexed projects====
All projects are either classified as Annex 1 or Annex 2 projects. Those lying in Annex 1 are large scale developments such as motorways, chemical works, bridges, powerstations etc. These always require an EIA under the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive (85,337,EEC as amended). Annex 2 projects are smaller in scale than those referred to in Annex 1. Member States must determine whether these project shall be made subject to an assessment subject to a set of criteria set out in Annex 3 of codified Directive 2011/92/EU.

====The Netherlands====
EIA was implemented in Dutch legislation on September 1, 1987. The categories of projects that require an EIA are summarised in Dutch legislation, the Wet milieubeheer. The use of thresholds for activities makes sure that EIA is obligatory for those activities that may have considerable impacts on the environment.

For projects and plans that fit these criteria, an EIA report is required. The EIA report defines a.o. the proposed initiative, it makes clear the impact of that initiative on the environment and compares this with the impact of possible alternatives with less a negative impact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs1.eia.nl/cms/engelse_c-d-lijsten.pdf List of criteria for EIA/SEA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724151830/http://docs1.eia.nl/cms/engelse_c-d-lijsten.pdf |date=2011-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===
EIA in Hong Kong, since 1998, is regulated by the ''Environmental Impact Assessment Ordinance 1997''.

The original proposal to construct the [[Lok Ma Chau Spur Line]] overground across the [[Long Valley, Hong Kong|Long Valley]] failed to get through EIA, and the [[Kowloon–Canton Railway Corporation]] had to change its plan and build the railway underground. In April 2011, the EIA of the Hong Kong section of the [[Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge]] was found to have breached the ordinance, and was declared unlawful. The appeal by the government was allowed in September 2011. However, it was estimated that this EIA court case had increased the construction cost of the Hong Kong section of the bridge by HK$6.5 billion in money-of-the-day prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201110/26/P201110260238.htm |title=LCQ1: Judicial review case regarding the Environmental Impact Assessment reports of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge |author= |date=October 26, 2011 |work=Press Releases |publisher=www.info.gov.hk |accessdate=October 27, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119072107/http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201110/26/P201110260238.htm |archivedate=January 19, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Iraq ===
Ministry of Environment of the federal government of Iraq is in charge of issuing Environmental compliance certificate based on an EIA report prepared by professional consultant and thoroughly reviewed by MOE. Any project or activity prior to its establishment or even already existing project has to be approved and obtain such certificate from the MOE. Projects are classified into 3 categories; “A”, “B” and “C”. EIA report is usually obligatory for those projects and activities falling under categories “A” (large-scale) and “B” (small-scale) that may have considerable impacts on environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/env/eia/documents/WG14_MOS3_nov2010/Diagram_EIA_process_in_Iraq.pdf|title=EIA process in Iraq|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831221814/https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/env/eia/documents/WG14_MOS3_nov2010/Diagram_EIA_process_in_Iraq.pdf|archivedate=2017-08-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of “A” category activities such as: dams and reservoirs, forestry production projects, industrial plants, irrigation, drainage and flood control, land clearance and leveling, port and harbor development, river basin development, thermal power and hydro-power development, manufacture, transportation and use of pesticides or other hazardous materials, hazardous waste management and disposal....etc. An example of “B” category activities such as: agro-industries, electrical transmission, renewable energy, rural electrification, tourism, rehabilitation or maintenance of highway or rural roads, rehabilitation or modification of existing industrial facilities...etc. preparation of EIA report is usually exempt for projects falling under category “C” that may have low to no impact on environment, and example of “C” category activities: small fish breeding pond, institutional development, most human resources projects...etc.

The main environmental legislations in Iraq are: Law No.64 for cities and land use (1965), Law No.21 for noise prevention (1966), Law No.25 for system of rivers and other water resources protection (1967), Law No.99 for ionized radiation (1980), Law No.89 for public health (drinking water provision, sanitation and environmental monitoring (1981), Law No.79 for protection and improvement of environment (1986), Environmental criteria for agricultural, industrial and public service projects (1990), Law No.3 for protection and improvement of environment (1997), Law No.2 for water systems protection (2001), Law No.44 for creation of Ministry of Environment instead of the council of protection and improvement of environment (2003), Law No.27 for environmental protection and improvement (2009),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://extwprlegs1.fao.org/docs/pdf/irq100188E.pdf|title=Law No.27 of 2009 for protection and improvement of environment|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170901160232/http://extwprlegs1.fao.org/docs/pdf/irq100188E.pdf|archivedate=2017-09-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Law No.4 for protection of ambient air system (2012).

Meanwhile, Environmental Protection and Improvement Board in the regional government of Kurdistan in the northern Iraq (Erbil, Duhok, Sulaimany and Garmyan) is responsible of issuing Environmental compliance certificate, the board was established according to law No.3 Environmental protection and improvement board in Iraqi Kurdistan Region (2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.natureiraq.org/uploads/5/2/9/9/52997379/english.pdf|title=Environmental Legislation guides in Kurdistan Region-Iraq|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110130412/http://www.natureiraq.org/uploads/5/2/9/9/52997379/english.pdf|archivedate=2017-01-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The board is responsible of issuing such certificate for all projects and activities except of petroleum operation which EIA process is organized and implemented by the Ministry of Natural Resources of Kurdistan Regional government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mnr.krg.org/images/pdfs/MNR%20-%20EIA%20Instructions%20Draft%20for%20consultation%20-%201%20December%202013.pdf|title=INSTRUCTIONS (NO. 1) OF 2013 ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF PETROLEUM OPERATIONS|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same Iraqi Environmental Legislations mentioned are adopted but the procedure of EIA in Iraqi-Kurdistan region government may differ from the one in the Federal government of Iraq.

=== India ===
The [[Ministry of Environment and Forests (India)|Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change]] (MoEFCC) of India has been in a great effort in Environmental Impact Assessment in India. The main laws in action are the Water Act(1974), the Indian [[Wildlife Protection Act of 1972|Wildlife (Protection) Act (1972)]], the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act (1981) and the Environment (Protection) Act (1986),Biological Diversity Act(2002).&lt;ref&gt;Shibani Ghosh, [http://www.nujslawreview.org/pdf/articles/2013_3/03shibanighosh.pdf "Demystifying the Environmental Clearance Process in India"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221023322/http://nujslawreview.org/pdf/articles/2013_3/03shibanighosh.pdf |date=2015-02-21 }}, ''NUJS LAW REVIEW'', January 2, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The responsible body for this is the Central Pollution Control Board.
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) studies need a significant amount of primary and secondary environmental data. Primary data are those collected in the field to define the status of the environment (like air quality data, water quality data etc.). Secondary data are those collected over the years that can be used to understand the existing environmental scenario of the study area. The environmental impact assessment (EIA) studies are conducted over a short period of time and therefore the understanding of the environmental trends, based on a few months of primary data, has limitations. Ideally, the primary data must be considered along with the secondary data for complete understanding of the existing environmental status of the area. In many EIA studies, the secondary data needs could be as high as 80% of the total data requirement. EIC is the repository of one stop secondary data source for environmental impact assessment in India.

The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) experience in India indicates that the lack of timely availability of reliable and authentic environmental data has been a major bottle neck in achieving the full benefits of EIA. The environment being a multi-disciplinary subject, a multitude of agencies are involved in collection of environmental data. However, no single organization in India tracks available data from these agencies and makes it available in one place in a form required by environmental impact assessment practitioners. Further, environmental data is not available in enhanced forms that improve the quality of the EIA. This makes it harder and more time-consuming to generate environmental impact assessments and receive timely environmental clearances from regulators. With this background, the Environmental Information Centre (EIC) has been set up to serve as a professionally managed clearing house of environmental information that can be used by MoEF, project proponents, consultants, NGOs and other stakeholders involved in the process of environmental impact assessment in India. EIC caters to the need of creating and disseminating of organized environmental data for various developmental initiatives all over the country.

EIC stores data in GIS format and makes it available to all environmental impact assessment studies and to EIA stakeholders in a cost effective and timely manner. So that we can manage that in different proportions such as remedy measures etc.,

In Malaysia, Section 34A, Environmental Quality Act, 1974&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doe.gov.my/portal/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Appendix_1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721014734/http://www.doe.gov.my/portal/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Appendix_1.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; requires developments that have significant impact to the environment are required to conduct the Environmental impact assessment.

=== Nepal ===
In Nepal, EIA has been integrated in major development projects since the early 1980s. In the planning history of Nepal, the sixth plan (1980–85), for the first time, recognized the need for EIA with the establishment of Environmental Impact Study Project (EISP) under the Department of Soil Conservation in 1982 to develop necessary instruments for integration of EIA in infrastructure
development projects. However, the government of Nepal enunciated environment conservation related
policies in the seventh plan (NPC, 1985–1990). To enforce this policy and make necessary arrangements, a series of guidelines were developed, thereby incorporating the elements of environmental factors right from the project formulation stage of the development plans
and projects and to avoid or minimize adverse effects on the ecological system. In addition, it has also emphasized that EIAs of industry, tourism, water resources, transportation, urbanization, agriculture, forest and other developmental projects be conducted.

In Nepal, the government's Environmental Impact Assessment Guideline of 1993 inspired the enactment of the Environment Protection Act (EPA) of 1997 and the Environment Protection Rules (EPR) of 1997 (EPA and EPR have been enforced since 24 and 26 June 1997 respectively in Nepal) to internalizing the environmental assessment system. The process institutionalized the EIA process in development proposals and enactment, which makes the integration of IEE and EIA legally binding to the prescribed projects. The projects, requiring EIA or IEE, are included in Schedules 1 and 2 of the EPR, 1997
(GoN/MoLJPA 1997).

=== New Zealand ===
In New Zealand, EIA is usually referred to as ''Assessment of Environmental Effects'' (AEE).  The first use of EIA's dates back to a Cabinet minute passed in 1974 called Environmental Protection and Enhancement Procedures. This had no legal force and only related to the activities of government departments. When the [[Resource Management Act 1991|Resource Management Act]] was passed in 1991, an EIA was required as part of a resource consent application. Section 88 of the Act specifies that the AEE must include "such detail as corresponds with the scale and significance of the effects that the activity may have on the environment".  While there is no duty to consult any person when making a resource consent application (Sections 36A and Schedule 4), proof of consultation is almost certain required by local councils when they decide whether or not to publicly notify the consent application under Section 93.

=== Russian Federation ===
As of 2004, the state authority responsible for conducting the State EIA in Russia has been split between two Federal bodies: 1) Federal service for monitoring the use of natural resources – a part of the Russian Ministry for Natural Resources and Environment and 2) Federal Service for Ecological, Technological and Nuclear Control. The two main pieces of environmental legislation in Russia are: The Federal Law ‘On Ecological Expertise, 1995 and the ‘Regulations on Assessment of Impact from Intended Business and Other Activity on Environment in the Russian Federation, 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Environmental Protection, Russia&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Federal Service for monitoring the use of natural resources ====
In 2006, the parliament committee on ecology in conjunction with the Ministry for Natural Resources and Environment, created a working group to prepare a number of amendments to existing legislation to cover such topics as stringent project documentation for building of potentially environmentally damaging objects as well as building of projects on the territory of protected areas.
There has been some success in this area, as evidenced from abandonment of plans to construct a gas pipe-line through the only remaining habitat of the critically endangered Amur leopard in the Russian Far East.

==== Federal Service for Ecological, Technological and Nuclear Control ====
The government's decision to hand over control over several important procedures, including state EIA in the field of all types of energy projects, to the Federal Service for Ecological, Technological and Nuclear Control had caused a major controversy and criticism from environmental groups that blamed the government for giving nuclear power industry control over the state EIA.

Not surprisingly the main problem concerning State EIA in Russia is the clear differentiation of jurisdiction between the two above-mentioned Federal bodies.

=== Sri Lanka ===

The National Environmental Act, 1998 requires environmental impact assessment for large scale projects in sensitive areas. It is enforced by the Central Environmental Authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Central Environmental Authority|title=Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Procedure in Sri Lanka|url=http://www.cea.lk/web/index.php/en/environmental-impact-assessment-eia-procedure-in-sri-lanka|website=Central Environmental Authority|publisher=Central Environmental Authority|accessdate=1 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161103215340/http://www.cea.lk/web/index.php/en/environmental-impact-assessment-eia-procedure-in-sri-lanka|archivedate=3 November 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ukraine ===
The new law of Ukraine on evaluation of impact on surroundings prescribes the requirements of environmental safety, rational use of national resources, minimizing of harmful impact on surroundings in the process of making managerial decisions about planned activity. The designing of the conclusion of evaluation of impact is a result of its conducting. The key moment of the law on evaluation of impact on surroundings is a substitution of conclusion of state environmental experise on the conclusion of evaluation of impact on surroundings. Business entity is forbidden to conduct or to start its planned activity without the conclusion of impact on surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MCL LLC|title=Evaluation of impact on surroundings|url=http://www.mcl.kiev.ua/en/evaluation-of-impact-on-surroundings-2/|website=MCL LLC|publisher=Eric Firado|accessdate=1 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201043929/http://www.mcl.kiev.ua/en/evaluation-of-impact-on-surroundings-2/|archivedate=1 December 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
{{Main|National Environmental Policy Act}}
The [[National Environmental Policy Act]] of 1969 (NEPA), enacted in 1970, established a policy of environmental impact assessment for federal agency actions, federally funded activities or federally permitted/licensed activities that in the U. S. is termed "environmental review" or simply "the NEPA process."&lt;ref&gt;United States. National Environmental Policy Act, [http://www.usinfo.org/enus/government/branches/nepaeqia.htm P.L. 91-190] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516090600/http://www.usinfo.org/enus/government/branches/nepaeqia.htm |date=2013-05-16 }}, {{USStat|83|852|1969}}, {{USC|42|4321}} ''et seq.'' Approved January 1, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; The law also created the [[Council on Environmental Quality]], which promulgated regulations to codify the law's requirements.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Council on Environmental Quality. "NEPA and Agency Planning." ''Code of Federal Regulations,'' {{USCFR|40|1501}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[United States environmental law]] an Environmental Assessment (EA) is compiled to determine the need for an ''[[Environmental Impact Statement]]'' (EIS).  Federal or federalized actions expected to subject or be subject to significant environmental impacts will publish a Notice of Intent to Prepare an EIS as soon as significance is known.  Certain actions of [[federal government of the United States|federal]] [[government agency|agencies]] must be preceded by the NEPA process.  Contrary to a widespread misconception, NEPA does not prohibit the federal government or its licensees/permittees from harming the environment, nor does it specify any penalty if an environmental impact assessment turns out to be inaccurate, intentionally or otherwise.  NEPA requires that plausible statements as to the prospective impacts be disclosed in advance. The purpose of NEPA process is to ensure that the decision maker is fully informed of the environmental aspects and consequences prior to making the final decision.

==== Environmental assessment ====
An '''environmental assessment''' (EA) is an environmental analysis prepared pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act to determine whether a federal action would significantly affect the environment and thus require a more detailed ''Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)''. The certified release of an Environmental Assessment results in either a ''Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI)'' or an [[Environmental Impact Statement|EIS]].&lt;ref&gt;Eccleston, Charles H. and J. Peyton Doub (2010). [https://www.amazon.com/Preparing-NEPA-Environmental-Assessments-Professional/dp/1439808821/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1486949351&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=charles+eccleston Preparing NEPA Environmental Assessments: A User’s Guide to Best Professional Practices]. {{ISBN|978-1439808825}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Council on Environmental Quality]] (CEQ), which oversees the administration of NEPA, issued regulations for implementing the NEPA in 1979. Eccleston reports that the NEPA regulations barely mention preparation of EAs. This is because the EA was originally intended to be a simple document used in relatively rare instances where an agency was not sure if the potential significance of an action would be sufficient to trigger preparation of an EIS. But today, because EISs are so much longer and complicated to prepare, federal agencies are going to great effort to avoid preparing EISs by using EAs, even in cases where the use of EAs may be inappropriate. The ratio of EAs that are being issued compared to EISs is about 100 to 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Eccleston |first1=Charles |last2=Doub |first2=J. Peyton |year=2012 |title=Preparing NEPA Environmental Assessments: A User's Guide to Best Professional Practices |location= |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=9781439808825}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, even the preparation of an accurate EA is viewed today as an onerous burden by many entities responsible for the environmental review of a proposal. Federal agencies have responded by streamlining their regulations that implement NEPA environmental review, by defining categories of projects that by their well understood nature may be safely excluded from review under NEPA, and by drawing up lists of project types that have negligible material impact upon the environment and can thus be exempted.

===== Content =====
The Environmental Assessment is a concise public document prepared by the federal action agency that serves to:
# briefly provide sufficient evidence and analysis for determining whether to prepare an EIS or a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI)
# Demonstrate compliance with the act when no EIS is required
# facilitate the preparation of an EIS when a FONSI cannot be demonstrated

The Environmental Assessment includes a brief discussion of the purpose and need of the proposal and of its alternatives as required by NEPA 102(2)(E), and of the human environmental impacts resulting from and occurring to the proposed actions and alternatives considered practicable, plus a listing of studies conducted and agencies and stakeholders consulted to reach these conclusions.  The action agency must approve an EA before it is made available to the public. The EA is made public through notices of availability by local, state, or regional clearing houses, often triggered by the purchase of a public notice advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation in the proposed activity area.

===== Structure =====
The structure of a generic Environmental Assessment is as follows:
# Summary
# Introduction
#* Background
#* Purpose and Need for Action
#* Proposed Action
#* Decision Framework
#* Public Involvement
#* Issues
# Alternatives, including the Proposed Action
#* Alternatives
#* Mitigation Common to All Alternatives
#* Comparison of Alternatives
# Environmental Consequences
# Consultation and Coordination

===== Procedure =====
The EA becomes a draft public document when notice of it is published, usually in a newspaper of general circulation in the area affected by the proposal. There is a 15-day review period required for an Environmental Assessment (30 days if exceptional circumstances) while the document is made available for public commentary, and a similar time for any objection to improper process. Commenting on the Draft EA is typically done in writing or email, submitted to the lead action agency as published in the notice of availability. An EA does not require a public hearing for verbal comments.  Following the mandated public comment period, the lead action agency responds to any comments, and certifies either a FONSI or a Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare an EIS in its public environmental review record.  The preparation of an EIS then generates a similar but more lengthy, involved and expensive process.

==== Environmental impact statement ====
{{main|Environmental impact statement}}
The adequacy of an environmental impact statement (EIS) can be challenged in [[United States federal courts|federal court]].  Major proposed projects have been blocked because of an agency's failure to prepare an acceptable EIS.  One prominent example was the [[Westway (New York)|Westway]] landfill and highway development in and along the [[Hudson River]] in [[New York, New York|New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elr.info/litigation/vol13/13.20326.htm ''Sierra Club v. United States Army Corps of Engineers,''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040328074514/http://www.elr.info/litigation/vol13/13.20326.htm |date=2004-03-28 }}
701 F.2d 1011, 18 ERC 1748. (2d Cir., 02/25/1983)&lt;/ref&gt; Another prominent case involved the [[Sierra Club]] suing the [[Nevada Department of Transportation]] over its denial of the club's request to issue a supplemental EIS addressing air emissions of [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]] and hazardous [[air pollutants]] in the case of widening [[U.S. Route 95 in Nevada|U.S. Route 95]] through [[Las Vegas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ritter |first=John |title=Lawsuit pits risks and roads |publisher=USA Today |date=2003-06-03 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-03-06-vegas-highway-usat_x.htm |accessdate= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629064153/http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-03-06-vegas-highway-usat_x.htm |archivedate=2011-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The case reached the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]], which led to construction on the highway being halted until the court's final decision. The case was settled prior to the court's final decision.

Several [[State governments of the United States|state governments]] that have adopted "little NEPAs," [[state law]]s imposing EIS requirements for particular state actions. Some of those state laws such as the [[California Environmental Quality Act]] refer to the required environmental impact study as an '''environmental impact report'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sprlaw.com/pdf/spr_little_nepa_ali_aba_0605.pdf |title=Sive,D. &amp; Chertok,M., "Little NEPAs" and Environmental Impact Assessment Procedures |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-01-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004091103/http://www.sprlaw.com/pdf/spr_little_nepa_ali_aba_0605.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This variety of state requirements produces voluminous data not just upon impacts of individual projects, but also in insufficiently researched scientific domains. For example, in a seemingly routine ''Environmental Impact Report'' for the city of [[Monterey, California]], information came to light that led to the official federal endangered species listing of [[Hickman's potentilla]], a rare coastal [[wildflower]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rogers|first1=Mark|title=Endangered Flora of California|publisher=lulu.com|ISBN=978-1312862784|page=106|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O17xCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA106&amp;lpg=PA106&amp;dq=C.M.+Hogan,+G.+Deghi,+M.+Papineau+et+al.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZKZSMO9-Y6&amp;sig=gezVDrq4tzoDHNmrQfNjAXjcguw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi7-KmQsMTQAhXP0RoKHRzOBAUQ6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=C.M.%20Hogan%2C%20G.%20Deghi%2C%20M.%20Papineau%20et%20al.&amp;f=false|accessdate=November 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C.M.

Prepared for the city of Monterey and State of California Clearinghouse (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. [[Federal Register]]: August 2, 1995 (Volume 60, Number 148, Pages 39326-39337)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transboundary application ==
Environmental threats do not respect national borders. International pollution can have detrimental effects on the atmosphere, oceans, rivers, [[aquifer]]s, farmland, the weather and biodiversity. Global climate change is transnational. Specific pollution threats include [[acid rain]], [[radioactive contamination]], [[Space debris|debris in outer space]], [[Stratosphere|stratospheric]] [[ozone depletion]] and toxic [[oil spill]]s. The [[Chernobyl disaster]], precipitated by a [[Nuclear and radiation accidents|nuclear accident]] on April 26, 1986, is a stark reminder of the devastating effects of transboundary nuclear pollution.&lt;ref&gt;Sands, P., (1989), The Environment, Community and International Law, Harvard International Law Lournal, 393, p402&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental protection is inherently a cross-border issue and has led to the creation of transnational regulation via multilateral and bilateral treaties. The [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] (UNCHE or Stockholm Conference) held in [[Stockholm]] in 1972 and the [[Earth Summit|United Nations Conference on the Environment and Development]] (UNCED or Rio Summit, Rio Conference, or Earth Summit) held in [[Rio de Janeiro]] in 1992 were key in the creation of about 1,000 international instruments that include at least some provisions related to the environment and its protection.&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, E., (1999), Understanding Compliance with International Environmental Agreements: The Bakers Dozen Myths, Univ Richmond L.R. 32, 1555&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe|United Nations Economic Commission for Europe's]] [[Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context]] was negotiated to provide an international legal framework for transboundary EIA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unece.org/env/eia/welcome.html |title=Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context (Espoo, 1991) |publisher=Unece.org |date= |accessdate=2013-01-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126142541/http://www.unece.org/env/eia/welcome.html |archivedate=2013-01-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as there is no universal legislature or administration with a comprehensive mandate, most international treaties exist parallel to one another and are further developed without the benefit of consideration being given to potential conflicts with other agreements. There is also the issue of international enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfrum, R., &amp; Matz, N., (2003), Conflicts in International Environmental Law, Max-Planck-Institut für Ausländisches Öffentliches Recht und Völkerrech&lt;/ref&gt;
This has led to duplications and failures, in part due to an inability to enforce agreements. An example is the failure of many international 
fisheries regimes to restrict harvesting practises.&lt;ref&gt;Young, O., (1999), The Effectiveness of International Environmental Regimes, [[MIT Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
As per Jay ''et al.'', EIA is used as a decision aiding tool rather than decision making tool. There is growing dissent about them as their influence on decisions is limited. Improved training for practitioners, guidance on bestpractice and continuing research have all been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jay |first1=S. |last2=Jones |first2=C. |last3=Slinn |first3=P. |last4=Wood |first4=C. |year=2007 |title=Environmental Impact Assessment: Retrospect and Prospect |url= |journal=Environmental Impact Assessment Review |publisher=Elsevier |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=289–300 |doi=10.1016/j.eiar.2006.12.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EIAs have been criticized for excessively limiting their scope in space and time. No accepted procedure exists for determining such boundaries. The boundary refers to ‘the spatial and temporal boundary of the proposal’s effects’. This boundary is determined by the applicant and the lead assessor, but in practice, almost all EIAs address only direct and immediate on-site effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lenzen |first1=M. |last2=Murray |first2=S. |last3=Korte |first3=B. |last4=Dey |first4=C. |year=2003 |title=Environmental impact assessment including indirect effects—a case study using input-output analysis |url= |journal=Environmental Impact Assessment Review |publisher=Elsevier |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=263–282 |doi=10.1016/S0195-9255(02)00104-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development causes both direct and indirect effects. Consumption of goods and services, production, use and disposal of building materials and machinery, additional land use for activities of manufacturing and services, mining and refining, etc., all have environmental impacts. The indirect effects of development can be much higher than the direct effects examined by an EIA. Proposals such as [[airports]] or [[shipyards]] cause wide-ranging national and international effects, which should be covered in EIAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shepherd |first1=A. |last2=Ortolano |first2=L. |year=1996 |title=Strategic environmental assessment for sustainable urban development |url= |journal=Environmental Impact Assessment Review |publisher=Elsevier |volume=16 |issue=4–6 |pages=321–335 |doi=10.1016/S0195-9255(96)00071-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadening the scope of EIA can benefit the conservation of threatened species. Instead of concentrating on the project site, some EIAs employed a [[habitat]]-based approach that focused on much broader relationships among humans and the environment. As a result, alternatives that reduce the negative effects to the population of whole species, rather than local subpopulations, can be assessed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fernandes |first1=João P. |year=2000 |title=EIA procedure, Landscape ecology and conservation management—Evaluation of alternatives in a highway EIA process |url= |journal=Environmental Impact Assessment Review |publisher=Elsevier |volume=20 |issue=6 |pages=665–680 |doi=10.1016/S0195-9255(00)00060-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thissen and Agusdinata&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Thissen |first1=WIH |last2=Agusdinata |first2=DB |year=2008 |title=Handling deep uncertainties in impact assessment|url= |journal=In proceedings of the 28th annual conference of the IAIA May 5–9, 2008, Perth, Australia. |publisher=IAIA |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that little attention is given to the systematic identification and assessment of uncertainties in environmental studies which is critical in situations where uncertainty cannot be easily reduced by doing more research. In line with this, Maier et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Maier  |first1=HR |last2=Ascough  |first2=JC |last3=Wattenbach  |first3=M |last4=Renschler  |first4=CS |last5=Labiosa   |first5=WB |year=2008 |title=Uncertainty in Environmental Decision Making: Issues, Challenges and Future Directions |url= |journal=Publications from USDA-ARS/UNL Faculty. Paper 399.|publisher=USDA-ARS/UNL Faculty |volume= |issue= |pages=|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have concluded on the need to consider uncertainty at all stages of the decision-making process. In such a way decisions can be made with confidence or known uncertainty. These proposals are justified on data that shows that environmental assessments fail to predict accurately the impacts observed. Tenney et al.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tenney   |first1=A |last2=Kværner   |first2=J |last3=Gjerstad   |first3=KI |year=2006 |title=Uncertainty in environmental impact assessment predictions: the need for better communication and more transparency|url= |journal=Impact Assessment and Project Appraisal| publisher=|volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=45–56|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Wood et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wood    |first1=C |last2=, Dipper |first2=B |last3= Jones    |first3=C |year=2000 |title=Auditing the assessments of the environmental impacts of planning projects|url= |journal=Journal of Environmental Planning and Management| publisher=|volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=23–47|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have reported evidence of the intrinsic uncertainty attached to EIAs predictions from a number of case studies worldwide. The gathered evidence consisted of comparisons between predictions in EIAs and the impacts measured during, or following project implementation. In explaining this trend, Tenney et al.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; have highlighted major causes such as project changes, modelling errors, errors in data and assumptions taken and bias introduced by people in the projects analyzed.

The [[Flynn effect]] has been often cited as an example of euthenics. Another example is the steady increase in body size in industrialized countries since the beginning of the 20th century.

Euthenics is not normally interpreted to have anything to do with changing the composition of the human gene pool by definition, although everything that affects society has some effect on who reproduces and who does not.&lt;ref name="definitionsnet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.definitions.net/definition/Euthenics|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Definitions for Euthenics|website=definitions.net|year=|accessdate=23 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the term==
[[File:Ellen Swallow Richards.jpg|thumb|280px|right|[[Ellen Swallow Richards]], the first female student and instructor at MIT.]]
The term was derived in the late 19th century from the [[Greek language|Greek]] verb ''eutheneo'', εὐθηνέω (''eu'', well; the, root of τίθημι ''tithemi'', to cause).

(To be in a flourishing state, to abound in, to prosper.—''[[Demosthenes]]''. To be strong or vigorous.—''[[Herodotus]]''. To be vigorous in body.—''[[Aristotle]]''.&lt;ref name="EllenSwallowRichards" /&gt;)

Also from the Greek [[Euthenia]], Εὐθηνία. Good state of the body: prosperity, good fortune, abundance.—''Herodotus''.&lt;ref name="EllenSwallowRichards" /&gt;

The opposite of Euthenia is [[Penia]], Πενία ("deficiency" or "[[poverty]]") the personification of poverty and need.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Daimon/Penia.html Theoi Project - Penia]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Ellen Swallow Richards|Ellen H. Swallow Richards]] (1842&amp;ndash;1911; Vassar Class of '70) was one of the first writers to use the term, in ''The Cost of Shelter'' (1905), with the meaning "the science of better living".&lt;ref name="askdefine" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JohnKGrandy"&gt;{{cite book | last = Grandy | first = John K. | authorlink = John K. Grandy | editor-last = Birx | editor-first = H.J. | title = Euthenics | series = Encyclopedia of Anthropology | publisher = [[SAGE Publications]] | volume = 5 Vols. | location = Thousand Oaks, CA | year = 2006 | isbn = 9781412952453 | doi = 10.4135/9781412952453 | url =http://knowledge.sagepub.com/view/anthropology/n312.xml }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear if (and probably unlikely that) any of the study programs of euthenics ever completely embraced Richards' multidisciplinary concept, though several nuances remain today, especially that of [[interdisciplinarity]].

===Vassar College Institute of Euthenics===
[[File:Julia Clifford Lathrop first chief US Childrens Bureau.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Julia Clifford Lathrop as the first chief of the U.S. Children's Bureau.]]
After Richards' death in 1911, [[Julia Lathrop]] (1858&amp;ndash;1932; VC '80)—one of Vassar's most distinguished alumnae—continued to promote the development of an interdisciplinary program in euthenics at the college.  Lathrop soon teamed with alumna [[Minnie Cumnock Blodgett]] (1862–1931; VC '84), who with her husband, [[John W. Blodgett|John Wood Blodgett]], offered financial support to create a program of euthenics at [[Vassar College]]. Curriculum planning, suggested by Vassar president [[Henry Noble MacCracken]] in 1922, began in earnest by 1923, under the direction of Professor Annie Louise Macleod (Chemistry; First woman PhD, McGill University, 1910).&lt;ref name="VassarEuthenicsHistory" /&gt;

According to Vassar's chronology entry for March 17, 1924, "the faculty recognized euthenics as a satisfactory field for sequential study (major). A Division of Euthenics was authorized to offer a [[Interdisciplinarity|multidisciplinary program]] [radical at the time] focusing the techniques and disciplines of the arts, sciences and social sciences on the life experiences and relationships of women. Students in euthenics could take courses in horticulture, food chemistry, sociology and statistics, education, child study, economics, economic geography, physiology, hygiene, public health, psychology and domestic architecture and furniture. With the new division came the first major in child study at an American liberal arts college."&lt;ref name="VassarChronicle"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://chronology.vassar.edu/records/1924/1924-03-17-euthenics.html |title= A Division of Euthenics was authorized to offer a multidisciplinary program focusing the techniques and disciplines of the arts, sciences and social sciences on the life experiences and relationships of women. - A Documentary Chronicle of Vassar College |author= Vassar Historian |date= |website= chronology.vassar.edu |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a typical major in child study in euthenics includes introductory psychology, laboratory psychology, applied psychology, child study and social psychology in the Department of Psychology; the three courses offered in the Department of Child Study; beginning economics, programs of social reorganization and the family in Economics; and in the Department of Physiology, human physiology, child hygiene, principles of public health.&lt;ref name="Lockwood"&gt;*{{cite book | last = Lockwood | first = Helen Drusilla | authorlink = Helen Drusilla Lockwood | title = The Meaning of Euthenics; An Essay on Action as a Tool of Knowledge. | publisher = [[Vassar College]] | location = [[Poughkeepsie, NY]] | year = 1929 | isbn = | url = http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015019910382;view=1up;seq=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vassar [[Summer Institute of Euthenics]] accepted its first students in June 1926. Created to supplement the controversial euthenics major which began February 21, 1925, it was also located in the new Minnie Cumnock Blodgett Hall of Euthenics ([[York &amp; Sawyer]], architects; ground broke October 25, 1925). Some Vassar faculty members (perhaps emotionally upset with being displaced on campus to make way, or otherwise politically motivated) contentiously "believed the entire concept of euthenics was vague and counter-productive to women's progress."&lt;ref name="SummerInstitute"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu/organizations-events-activities/the-vassar-summer-institute.html |title= The Vassar Summer Institute |author= Vassar Historian |date=  |website= vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu |publisher=  |accessdate= 26 August 2013 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120304011536/http://vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu/organizations-events-activities/the-vassar-summer-institute.html |archivedate= 4 March 2012 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having overcome a lukewarm reception, Vassar College officially opened its Minnie Cumnock Blodgett Hall of Euthenics in 1929.&lt;ref name="VassarEuthenicsHistory"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu/three-chapters/the-disappointing-first-thrust-of-euthenics.html |title=The Disappointing First Thrust of Euthenics |author=Vassar Historian |date= |website=vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140127020842/http://vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu/three-chapters/the-disappointing-first-thrust-of-euthenics.html |archivedate=27 January 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Ruth Wheeler (Physiology and Nutrition – VC '99) took over as director of euthenics studies in 1924. Wheeler remained director until [[Mary Shattuck Fisher Langmuir]] (VC '20) succeeded her in 1944, until 1951.&lt;ref name="SummerInstitute" /&gt;

The college continued for the 1934–35 academic year its successful cooperative housing experiment in three residence halls.  Intended to help students meet their college costs by working in their residences. For example, in Main, students earned $40 a year by doing relatively light work such as cleaning their rooms.&lt;ref name="VassarChronicle1934"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://chronology.vassar.edu/records/1934/1934-03-10-coops.html |title= The college announced the trustees' decision to continue for the 1934-35 academic year this year's successful cooperative housing experiment in three residence halls. - A Documentary Chronicle of Vassar College |author= Vassar Historian |date= |website= chronology.vassar.edu |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, Katharine Blodgett Hadley (VC '20) donated $400,000, through the [[Rubicon Foundation]], to Vassar to help fund operating deficits in the current and succeeding years and to improve faculty salaries.&lt;ref name="VassarChronicleMay1951"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://chronology.vassar.edu/records/1951/1951-05-23-blodgett-gift.html |title= President Blanding announced a $400,000 gift to the college from the chair of the board of trustees, Katharine Blodgett Hadley '20, through the Rubicon Foundation. - A Documentary Chronicle of Vassar College |author= Vassar Historian |date= |website= chronology.vassar.edu |publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elmira College]] is noted as the oldest college still in existence which (as a [[Timeline of women's colleges in the United States#First and oldest|college for women]]) granted degrees to women which were the equivalent of those given to men (the first to do so was the now-defunct [[Mary Sharp College]]).&lt;ref name="WomensCollegesUS"&gt;{{cite book

|accessdate=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elmira College became coeducational in all of its programs in 1969.

A special article was written in the December 12, 1937 ''[[New York Times]]'', quoting recent graduates of Elmira College, urging for courses in colleges for men on the care of children. Reporting that "preparation for the greatest of all professions, that of motherhood and child-training, is being given the students at Elmira College in the Nursery School which is Conducted as part of the Department of Euthenics."&lt;ref name="NYTimesElmiraCollegeFirst" /&gt;

Elmira College was one of the first of the liberal arts colleges to recognize the fact that women should have some special training, integrated with the so-called liberal studies, which would prepare them to carry on, with less effort and fewer mistakes, a successful family life. Courses in nutrition, household economics, clothing selection, principles of foods and meal planning, child psychology, and education in family relations are a part of the curriculum.&lt;ref name="NYTimesElmiraCollegeFirst"&gt;{{cite web

The Elmira College nursery school for fifteen children between the ages of two and five years was opened primarily as a laboratory for college students, but it had become so popular with parents in the community that there was always a long waiting list.&lt;ref name="NYTimesElmiraCollegeFirst" /&gt;

The ''New York Times'' article notes how the nursery had become one of the essential laboratories of the college, where recent mothers testified to the value of the training they received while in college. "Today," one graduate said, "when it is often necessary for young women to continue professional work outside the home after marriage, it is important that young fathers, who must share in the actual care and training of the children, should have some knowledge of correct methods."&lt;ref name="NYTimesElmiraCollegeFirst" /&gt;

===Today===
Many factors led to the movement never getting the funding it needed to remain relevant, including: vigorous debate about the exact meaning of euthenics, a strong [[antifeminism]] movement paralleling even stronger [[women's rights]] movements, confusion with the term eugenics, the economic impact of the [[Great Depression]] and two world wars. These factors also prevented the discipline from gaining the attention it needed to put together a lasting, vastly [[interdisciplinarity|multidisciplinary]] curriculum. Therefore, it split off into separate disciplines. Child Study is one such curriculum.

Martin Heggestad of the Mann Library notes that "Starting around 1920, however, home economists tended to move into other fields, such as nutrition and textiles, that offered more career opportunities, while health issues were dealt with more in the hard sciences and in the professions of nursing and public health. Also, improvements in public sanitation (for example, the wider availability of sewage systems and of food inspection) led to a decline in infectious diseases and thus a decreasing need for the largely household-based measures taught by home economists."&lt;ref&gt;[http://hearth.library.cornell.edu/h/hearth/hygiene.html HEARTH Library-Cornell University]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the end of euthenics as originally defined by Ellen Swallow Richards ensued.

==Relationship with eugenics==
According to Ellen Richards, in her book ''Euthenics: the science of controllable environment'' (1910):&lt;ref name="EllenSwallowRichards" /&gt;
{{quote|The betterment of living conditions, through conscious endeavor, for the purpose of securing efficient human beings, is what the author means by Euthenics.

"Human vitality depends upon two primary conditions—[[heredity]] and [[hygiene]]—or conditions preceding birth and conditions during life."

[[Eugenics]] deals with race improvement through heredity.

Euthenics deals with race improvement through environment.

Eugenics is hygiene for the future generations.

Euthenics is hygiene for the present generation.

Eugenics must await careful investigation.

Euthenics has immediate opportunity.

Euthenics precedes eugenics, developing better men now, and thus inevitably creating a better race of men in the future. Euthenics is the term proposed for the preliminary science on which Eugenics must be based.}}

==Debate, misconceptions and opposition==
[[File:ЛестерФВорд.jpeg|200px|left|thumb|[[Lester Frank Ward]]]][[Image:aflexner21.jpg|200px|thumbnail|left|[[Abraham Flexner]], c. 1895.]]
[[File:MargaretSanger-Underwood.LOC.jpg|200px|left|thumb|[[Margaret Sanger]], 1922]]
[[File:Charles Benedict Davenport.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Charles Benedict Davenport]], ca. 1929]]
Debate over misconceptions about the movement started almost from the beginning. In his comparison "Eugenics, Euthenics, And Eudemics", ([[American Journal of Sociology]], Vol. 18, No. 6, May 1913), [[Lester Frank Ward|Lester F. Ward]] of [[Brown University]] opens the second section regarding euthenics lamenting: 
{{quote|Is there, then, nothing to do? Are we to accept that modem scientific fatalism known as [[laissez faire]], which enjoins the folding of the arms? Are we to preach a gospel of inaction? I for one certainly am not content to do so, and I believe that nothing I have thus far said [about eugenics] is inconsistent with the most vigorous action, and that in the direction of the betterment of the human race. The end and aim of the eugenists cannot be reproached. The race is far from perfect. Its condition is deplorable. Its improvement is entirely feasible, and in the highest degree desirable. Nor do I refer merely to economic conditions, to the poverty and misery of the disinherited classes. The intellectual state of the world is deplorable, and its improvement is clearly within the reach of society itself. It is therefore a question of method rather than of principle that concerns us.}}

Ward later noted about the organic environment that:
{{quote|[[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] has taught us that the chief barrier to the advance of any species of plants or animals is its competition with other plants and animals that contest the same ground. And therefore the fiercest opponents of any species are the members of the same species which demand the same elements of subsistence. Hence the chief form of relief in the organic world consists in the thinning-out of competitors. Any species of animals or plants left free to propagate at its normal rate would overrun the earth in a short time and leave no room for any other species. Any species that is sufficiently vigorous to resist its organic environment will crowd out all others and monopolize the earth. If nature permitted this there could be no variety, but only one monotonous aspect devoid of interest or beauty. Whatever we may think of the harsh method by which this is prevented, we cannot regret that it is prevented, and that we have a world of variety, interest, and aesthetic attractiveness.}}

Vassar historians note that "critics faulted the new program as a weakening of science and a slide into vocationalism.  The influential educator and historian of education, [[Abraham Flexner]]—one of the founders of the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study—attacked the program, along with other “ad hoc” innovations like intercollegiate athletics and student governments, in Universities, American, English, German (1930)."&lt;ref name="VassarChronicle" /&gt;{{cquote|
"Well, what is euthenics?  Euthenics is the 'science of efficient living;' and the 'science' is artificially pieced together of bits of mental hygiene, child guidance, nutrition, speech development and correction, family problems, wealth consumption, food preparation, household technology, and horticulture....  The institute is actually justified in an official publication by the profound question of a girl student who is reported as asking, 'What is the connection of Shakespeare with having a baby?'  The Vassar Institute of Euthenics bridges this gap!"}}

In the summer of 1926, [[Margaret Sanger]] created a stir when she gave a radio address, called "Racial Betterment", in the first Euthenics Institute, where she praised attempts to "close our gates to the so-called 'undesirables'" and proposed efforts to "discourage or cut down on the rapid multiplication of the unfit and undesirable at home", by government-subsidized voluntary sterilization.  (from ''The Selected Papers of Margaret Sanger'', vol. 1 (2003), Esther Katz, ed.)

Eugenicist, [[Charles Benedict Davenport]], noted in his article "Euthenics and Eugenics," found reprinted in the ''Popular Science Monthly'' of January 1911, page 18, 20:&lt;ref name="CharlesBenedictDavenport"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Davenport | first = Charles Benedict | authorlink = Charles Benedict Davenport | title = Euthenics and Eugenics | journal = [[Popular Science Monthly]] | volume = 78 | location = New York |date=January 1911 | pages =16–20 | url = https://archive.org/stream/popularsciencemo78newyuoft#page/2/mode/2up | accessdate=September 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Thus the two schools of euthenics and eugenics stand opposed, each viewing the other unkindly.  Against eugenics it is urged that it is a fatalistic doctrine and deprives life of the stimulus toward effort.  Against euthenics the other side urges that it demands an endless amount of money to patch up conditions in the vain effort to get greater efficiency.  Which of the two doctrines is true?

The thoughtful mind must concede that, as is so often the case where doctrines are opposed, each view is partial, incomplete and really false.  The truth does not exactly lie between the doctrines; it comprehends them both. What a child becomes is always the resultant of two sets of forces acting from the moment the fertilized egg begins its development—one is the set of internal tendencies and the other is the set of external influences.  What the result of an external influence—a particular environmental condition—shall be depends only in part upon the nature of the influence; it depends also upon the internal nature of the reacting [[protoplasm]].

Incest, cousin marriage, the marriage of defectives and tuberculous persons, are, in wide circles, taboo.  This fact affords the basis for the hope that, when the method of securing strong offspring, even from partially defective stock—and where is the strain without any defect?—is widely known, the teachings of science in respect even to marriage matings will be widely regarded and that in the generations to come the teachings and practice of euthenics will yield greater result because of the previous practice of the principles of eugenics.}}

{{cquote|From intensive study we realize the importance of eugenics—the right of birth, and also the subject of euthenics—the right to environment. Too little credit is given to environment when we speak of children having hereditary traits as "Like father, like son," or "Chip off the old block." Such phrases have their origin from the study of eugenics.  No one has ever taken an [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Edwards]] baby and reared it in a [[Jukes family|Jukes]] environment.}}

The '''Fisheries and Illinois Aquaculture Center''' at [[Southern Illinois University Carbondale]] (SIUC) was founded by Dr. [[William M. Lewis, Senior]] in 1950.  The Center is administratively housed in the Graduate School.  Faculty have joint appointments in the Center and the Department of Zoology within the College of Science or in the Department of Animal Science, Food and Nutrition in the College of Agricultural Sciences.

Research faculty in the Center have diverse capabilities including molecular genetics, aquatic toxicology, aquatic ecology, [[bioenergetics]], fish [[nutrition]], fish physiology, [[fisheries]] policy and management, and [[aquaculture]] technology.

Facilities include several research laboratories, an experimental pond facility (90 ponds), a large wet laboratory, research boats (including a {{convert|27|ft|m|adj=on}} research vessel with advanced [[hydroacoustics]]), and offices.

The Center generates many peer-reviewed publications and garners grant support from many state and federal agencies as well as foundations.&lt;ref&gt;2009 Annual Report for Fisheries http://fishdata.siu.edu/rep09.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5659">In the [[Bible]], the word "'''flesh'''" is often used simply as a description of the [[Flesh|fleshy]] parts of an animal, including that of human beings, and typically in reference to dietary laws and sacrifice.&lt;ref name="degruyter"&gt;[http://www.degruyter.com/view/EBR/MainLemma_41781?pi=0&amp;moduleId=common-word-wheel&amp;dbJumpTo=flesh "Flesh, from the Encyclopedia of the Bible and its Reception"] DeGruyter (Berlin, Boston) 2014. Retrieved on 22 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Less often it is used as a metaphor for familial or [[kinship]] relations, and (particularly in the [[Christianity|Christian]] tradition) as a metaphor to describe [[sin|sinful]] tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studylight.org/encyclopedia/isb/view.cgi?n=3456 "International Standard Bible Encyclopedia - Flesh"]&lt;/ref&gt; A related turn of phrase identifies certain sins as "carnal" sins, from [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:caro|caro, carnis]]'', meaning "flesh."  

== Etymology ==
{{Wiktionary}}
The word '''flesh''' (from the Old English ''flǣsc'', of Germanic origin) is translated from the Hebrew lexemes bāśār and šĕēr, and from the Greek σάρξ (sárx), and κρέας (kréas).&lt;ref name="degruyter" /&gt; 

== Meaning and Use ==

=== Old Testament ===
In the [[Hebrew Bible]], ''the way of all flesh'' is a religious phrase that in its original sense meant [[death]], the [[fate]] of all [[Living being|living things]]. This phrase does not appear verbatim in the King James Bible either, but is clearly prefigured in that translation:
: ''And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.'' ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 6:13)

[[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]], by contrast, used ''[[The Way of All Flesh (novel)|The Way of All Flesh]]'' as the title of a semi-autobiographical [[family saga]], using the phrase to refer ambiguously to either the religious or to a [[Sex|sexual]] sense.

=== New Testament ===
[[File:Bernardino_Pinturicchio_-_Saint_Jerome_in_the_Wilderness_-_Walters_371089.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Saint Jerome in the Desert (Pinturicchio)|Saint Jerome in the Wilderness]]'' The saint spent four years in the Syrian desert as a hermit, [[Mortification of the flesh|mortifying]] his flesh and elevating his spirit through study.]]

[[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]] makes this connection in [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 7:18, in which he says:
:''For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.'' ([[KJV]])

However, the (fourth century) [[Apostles' creed]] affirms 'carnis resurrectionem' (the resurrection of the flesh), the body being an essential part of a person.

In religious language, the "flesh" took on specific connotations of sexual sins.  It was in this sense that the nineteenth century critic [[Robert Williams Buchanan|Robert Buchanan]] condemned a ''[[Fleshly School|Fleshly School of Poetry]]'', accusing [[Algernon Charles Swinburne|Swinburne]], [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti|Rossetti]], and [[William Morris|Morris]] with preoccupation with sex and sensual matters.

A traditional turn of phrase condemns "the [[World (theology)|world]], the flesh, and the [[Devil]]" as the sources of [[temptation]] to [[sin]]. This specific phrase does not appear in the [[King James Version of the Bible|King James Bible]], but a similar sense appears in passages such as [[First Epistle of John|1 John]] 2:16:

:''For all that is in the world, the [[lust]] of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the [[pride]] of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.'' (KJV)

The phrase definitely appears in the writings of [[Abelard]], who writes that "there are three things that tempt us: the world, the flesh, and the devil."&lt;ref&gt;''Tria autem sunt quae nos tentant, caro, mundus, diabolus.'' Abelard, ''[http://www.abaelard.de/abaelard/050511expositio.htm Exposition of the Lord's Prayer]'', sixth petition ("And lead us not in temptation")&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[litany]] of the 1662 edition of the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' contains the petition:

:''From fornication, and all other deadly sin; and from all the deceits of the world, the flesh, and the devil,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''Spare us, good Lord.'''''

and the English translations of [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] litanies often contain a similar petition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vulcanhammer.org/anglican/bcp-1662.pdf ''Book of Common Prayer''], 1662 edition&lt;/ref&gt;

This traditional turn of phrase gave rise to the title of ''[[The World, the Flesh and the Devil (1959 film)|The World, the Flesh and the Devil]]'', a 1959 apocalyptic science fiction film.

A '''flexible alternating current transmission system''' (FACTS) is a system composed of static equipment used for the [[alternating current|AC]] [[electric power transmission|transmission of electrical energy]]. It is meant to enhance controllability and increase power transfer capability of the network. It is generally a [[power electronics]]-based system.

FACTS is defined by the [[IEEE]] as "a power electronic based system and other static equipment that provide control of one or more AC transmission system parameters to enhance controllability and increase power transfer capability."&lt;ref&gt;''Proposed terms and definitions for flexible AC transmission system(FACTS)'', IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery, Volume 12, Issue 4, October 1997, pp.&amp;nbsp;1848–1853. {{DOI|10.1109/61.634216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Siemens "FACTS Increase the reliability of AC grids and reduce power delivery costs. They improve transmission quality and efficiency of power transmission by supplying inductive or reactive power to the grid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energy.siemens.com/hq/en/power-transmission/facts/ Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS) - Siemens&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
[[Image:FACTS theory1.PNG|thumb|Transmission on a no-loss line.]]
[[Image:FACTS theory series compensation.PNG|thumb|Series compensation.]]
[[Image:FACTS theory shunt compensation1.PNG|thumb|Shunt compensation.]]

===Shunt compensation===
In shunt compensation, power system is connected in [[shunt (electrical)|shunt]] (parallel) with the FACTS. It works as a controllable [[current source]].  Shunt compensation is of two types:

;Shunt capacitive compensation: This method is used to improve the [[power factor]]. Whenever an inductive load is connected to the transmission line, power factor lags because of lagging load current. To compensate, a shunt capacitor is connected which draws current leading the source [[voltage]]. The net result is improvement in power factor.

;Shunt inductive compensation: This method is used either when charging the [[transmission line]], or, when there is very low load at the receiving end. Due to very low, or no load&amp;nbsp;– very low current flows through the transmission line. Shunt capacitance in the transmission line causes voltage amplification ([[Ferranti effect]]). The receiving end voltage may become double the sending end voltage (generally in case of very long transmission lines). To compensate, shunt inductors are connected across the transmission line. The power transfer capability is thereby increased depending upon the power equation

&lt;math&gt;
P=\left(\frac{EV}{X}\right)\sin(\delta)
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\delta =&lt;/math&gt; power angle

==Theory==

In the case of a no-loss line, voltage magnitude at the receiving end is the same as voltage magnitude at the sending end: V&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;=V.
Transmission results in a phase lag &lt;math&gt; \delta &lt;/math&gt; that depends on line reactance X.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\underline{V_s}&amp;=V \cos\left(\frac{\delta}{2}\right) +jV \sin\left(\frac{\delta}{2}\right)\\
\underline{V_r}&amp;=V \cos\left(\frac{\delta}{2}\right)-jV \sin\left(\frac{\delta}{2}\right)\\
\underline{I}&amp;=\frac{\underline{V_s}-\underline{V_r}}{jX}=\frac{2V\sin{\left(\frac{\delta}{2}\right)}}{X}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

As it is a no-loss line, active power P is the same at any point of the line:

&lt;math&gt;P_s=P_r=P=V \cos\left(\frac{\delta}{2}\right) \cdot \frac{2V\sin{\left(\frac{\delta}{2}\right)}}{X}=\frac{V^2}{X}\sin(\delta)&lt;/math&gt;

Reactive power at sending end is the opposite of reactive power at receiving end:

&lt;math&gt;Q_s=-Q_r=Q=V\sin\left(\frac{\delta}{2}\right) \cdot \frac{2V\sin\left(\frac{\delta}{2}\right)}{X}=\frac{V^2}{X}(1-\cos \delta)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!--Thus, active power is &lt;math&gt;P=\frac{V^2}{X}\sin \delta&lt;/math&gt; whereas reactive power is &lt;math&gt;Q=\frac{V^2}{X}(1-cos \delta)&lt;/math&gt;--&gt;
As &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is very small, active power mainly depends on &lt;math&gt; \delta &lt;/math&gt; whereas reactive power mainly depends on voltage magnitude.

===Series compensation===
FACTS for series compensation modify line impedance: X is decreased so as to increase the transmittable active power. However, more reactive power must be provided.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
P&amp;=\frac{V^2}{X-Xc}\sin(\delta)\\
Q&amp;=\frac{V^2}{X-Xc}(1-\cos \delta)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

===Shunt compensation===

Reactive current is injected into the line to maintain voltage magnitude. Transmittable active power is increased but more reactive power is to be provided.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
P&amp;=\frac{2V^2}{X}\sin\left(\frac{\delta}{2}\right)\\
Q&amp;=\frac{2V^2}{X}\left[1-\cos\left(\frac{\delta}{2}\right)\right]   
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Fresh water''' (or '''freshwater''') is  any naturally occurring [[water]] except seawater and [[brackish water]]. Fresh water includes water in [[ice sheet]]s, [[ice cap]]s, [[glacier]]s, [[iceberg]]s, [[bog]]s, [[pond]]s, [[lake]]s, [[river]]s, [[stream]]s, and even underground water called [[groundwater]]. Fresh water is generally characterized by having low [[concentration]]s of dissolved [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] and other [[total dissolved solids]]. Though the term specifically excludes [[seawater]] and [[brackish water]], it does include mineral-rich waters such as [[chalybeate]] springs. 

Fresh water is not the same as [[drinking water|potable water]] (or drinking water). Much of the earth's fresh water (on the surface and groundwater) is unsuitable for drinking without some treatment. Fresh water can easily become [[Water pollution|polluted by human activities]] or due to naturally occurring processes, such as erosion.

Water is critical to the survival of all living organisms. Some organisms can thrive on salt water, but the great majority of higher plants and most [[mammal]]s need fresh water to live. 

==Definitions==
=== Numerical definition ===
Fresh water can be defined as water with less than 500 [[parts per million]] (ppm) of dissolved [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.groundwater.org/gi/gwglossary.html#F | title=Groundwater Glossary | date=27 March 2006 | accessdate=14 May 2006 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060428102341/http://www.groundwater.org/gi/gwglossary.html#F | archivedate=28 April 2006 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fresh water habitats are classified as either [[lake ecosystem|lentic systems]], which are the still-waters including [[pond]]s, lakes, [[swamp]]s and [[Bog|mire]]s ; [[lotic]] which are running-water systems; or [[groundwater]]s which flow in rocks and [[aquifer]]s. There is, in addition, a zone which bridges between groundwater and lotic systems, which is the [[hyporheic zone]], which underlies many larger rivers and can contain substantially more water than is seen in the open channel. It may also be in direct contact with the underlying underground water. 

The majority of fresh water on Earth is in [[ice cap]]s.

== Sources ==
The source of almost all fresh water is [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] from the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], in the form of [[mist]], [[rain]] and [[snow]]. Fresh water falling as mist, rain or snow contains materials dissolved from the [[atmosphere]] and material from the sea and land over which the rain bearing clouds have traveled.  In [[industry|industrialized]] areas rain is typically [[acidic]] because of dissolved oxides of [[sulfur]] and [[nitrogen]] formed from burning of fossil fuels in cars, factories, trains and aircraft and from the atmospheric emissions of industry. In some cases this [[acid rain]] results in [[pollution]] of lakes and rivers.

In coastal areas fresh water may contain significant concentrations of salts derived from the sea if windy conditions have lifted drops of seawater into the rain-bearing clouds. This can give rise to elevated concentrations of [[sodium]], [[chloride]], [[magnesium]] and [[sulfate]] as well as many other compounds in smaller concentrations.

In [[desert]] areas, or areas with impoverished or dusty soils, rain-bearing winds can pick up [[sand]] and [[dust]] and this can be deposited elsewhere in precipitation and causing the freshwater flow to be measurably contaminated both by insoluble solids but also by the soluble components of those soils. Significant quantities of [[iron]] may be transported in this way including the well-documented transfer of iron-rich rainfall falling in Brazil derived from sand-storms in the [[Sahara]] in [[north Africa]].

== Water distribution ==
{{main article|Water distribution on Earth}}

Out of all the water on [[Earth]], saline water in [[ocean]]s, [[sea]]s and saline [[groundwater]] make up about 97% of it. Only 2.5–2.75% is fresh water, including 1.75–2% frozen in [[glacier]]s, [[ice]] and [[snow]], 0.5–0.75% as fresh [[groundwater]] and [[soil]] moisture, and less than 0.01% of it as [[surface water]] in [[lake]]s, [[swamp]]s and [[river]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/earthwherewater.html Where is Earth's water?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214091601/http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/earthwherewater.html |date=14 December 2013 }}, [[United States Geological Survey]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/8b.html Physicalgeography.net] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126072955/http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/8b.html |date=26 January 2016 }}. Physicalgeography.net. Retrieved on 29 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Freshwater lakes contain about 87% of this fresh surface water, including 29% in the [[African Great Lakes]], 22% in [[Lake Baikal]] in Russia, 21% in the [[North American Great Lakes]], and 14% in other lakes. [[Swamp]]s have most of the balance with only a small amount in rivers, most notably the [[Amazon River]]. The atmosphere contains 0.04% water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Gleick |first= Peter |authorlink=Peter Gleick|editor= Stephen H. Schneider |title= Encyclopedia of Climate and Weather|publisher= Oxford University Press |year= 1996|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In areas with no fresh water on the ground surface, fresh water derived from [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] may, because of its lower density, overlie saline ground water in lenses or layers. Most of the world's fresh water is frozen in [[ice sheet]]s. Many areas suffer from lack of distribution of fresh water, such as deserts.

== Aquatic organisms ==
{{Further|Aquatic animal}}
Water is a critical issue for the survival of all living organisms. Some can use salt water but many organisms including the great majority of higher plants and most [[mammal]]s must have access to fresh water to live. Some terrestrial mammals, especially desert [[rodent]]s appear to survive without drinking but they do generate water through the [[metabolism]] of [[cereal]] seeds and they also have mechanisms to conserve water to the maximum degree.

Fresh water creates a [[Hypotonicity|hypotonic]] environment for aquatic organisms. This is problematic for some organisms with pervious skins or with [[gill]] membranes, whose cell membranes may burst if excess water is not excreted. Some [[protist]]s accomplish this using [[contractile vacuole]]s, while [[freshwater fish]] excrete excess water via the [[kidney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/V/VertebrateKidneys.html | title=Vertebrate Kidneys | date=3 November 2002 | accessdate=14 May 2006 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060429045409/http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/V/VertebrateKidneys.html | archivedate=29 April 2006 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most aquatic organisms have a limited ability to regulate their [[osmotic]] balance and therefore can only live within a narrow range of salinity, [[diadromous]] [[fish]] have the ability to [[Fish migration|migrate]] between fresh water and [[seawater|saline]] water bodies. During these migrations they undergo changes to adapt to the surroundings of the changed salinities; these processes are hormonally controlled. The [[eel]] (''[[Anguilla anguilla]]'') uses the [[hormone]] [[prolactin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kalujnaia|first=S.|author2=et. al.|year=2007|title=Salinity adaptation and gene profiling analysis in the European eel (Anguilla anguilla) using microarray technology|journal= Gen Comp Endocrinol.|publisher=National Center for Biotechnology Information|issue=2007|pages=274–80|pmid=17324422|doi=10.1016/j.ygcen.2006.12.025|volume=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in [[salmon]] (''Salmo salar'') the hormone [[cortisol]] plays a key role during this process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bisal|first=G.A.|author2=Specker, J.L.|date=24 January 2006|title=Cortisol stimulates hypo-osmoregulatory ability in Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L|journal=Journal of Fish Biology |publisher=Wiley|volume=39|issue=3|pages=421–432|doi=10.1111/j.1095-8649.1991.tb04373.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[sea bird]]s have special glands at the base of the bill through which excess salt is excreted. Similarly the [[marine iguana]]s on the [[Galápagos Islands]] excrete excess salt through a nasal gland and they sneeze out a very salty excretion.

[[Freshwater mollusc]]s include [[freshwater snails]] and [[freshwater bivalve]]s. Freshwater crustaceans include [[freshwater crab]]s and [[crayfish]].

==Problems==

=== Limited resource ===
{{Main|Water scarcity}}

Fresh water is a renewable and variable, but finite natural resource.  Fresh water can only be replenished through the process of the water cycle,in which water from seas, lakes, forests, land, rivers, and [[reservoirs]] evaporates, forms clouds, and returns as precipitation. Locally however, if more fresh water is consumed through human activities than is naturally restored, this may result in reduced fresh water availability from surface and underground sources and can cause serious damage to surrounding and associated environments.

Fresh and unpolluted water accounts for 0.003% of total water available globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Water is not an infinite resource and the world is thirsty|first=Gianfranco|last=Nitti|date=May 2011|newspaper=The Italian Insider|page=8|location=Rome}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increase in the world population and the increase in per capita water use puts increasing strains on the finite resources availability of clean fresh water. The World Bank adds that the response by freshwater ecosystems to a changing climate can be described in terms of three interrelated components: water quality, water quantity or volume, and water timing. A change in one often leads to shifts in the others as well.&lt;ref&gt;The World Bank, 2009 {{cite web |url=http://water.worldbank.org/water/publications/water-and-climate-change-understanding-risks-and-making-climate-smart-investment-decisi |title=Water and Climate Change: Understanding the Risks and Making Climate-Smart Investment Decisions |pages=19–22 |accessdate=24 October 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407105752/http://water.worldbank.org/water/publications/water-and-climate-change-understanding-risks-and-making-climate-smart-investment-decisi/ |archivedate=7 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Water pollution]] and subsequent [[eutrophication]]  also reduces the availability of fresh water.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/nutrients-in-freshwater/nutrients-in-freshwater-assessment-published-6 "Nutrients in fresh water"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many areas of the world are already experiencing stress on water availability (or water scarcity). Due to the accelerated pace of population growth and an increase in the amount of water a single person uses, it is expected that this situation will continue to get worse. A shortage of water in the future would be detrimental to the [[human population]] as it would affect everything from sanitation, to overall health and the production of grain.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/water_cities.shtml "Fresh Water in the Future"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230010235/http://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/water_cities.shtml |date=30 December 2016 }}.

An important concern for hydrological ecosystems is securing minimum [[streamflow]], especially preserving and restoring [[Instream use|instream water allocations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The world's water, 2006–2007: the biennial report on freshwater resources |author1=Peter Gleick |authorlink1=Peter Gleick|author2=Heather Cooley |author3=David Katz  |year=2006 |publisher=Island Press |isbn= 1-59726-106-8|pages=29–31 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=Lttb1qPh4Z8C|accessdate=12 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fresh water is an important natural resource necessary for the survival of all [[ecosystem]]s.  The use of water by humans for activities such as irrigation and industrial applications can have adverse impacts on down-stream ecosystems.  

Fresh water withdrawal is the quantity of water removed from available sources for use in any purpose, excluding evaporation losses.
Water drawn off is not necessarily entirely consumed and some portion may be returned for further use downstream.

===Water pollution===
{{Main|Water pollution}}
[[Water pollution|Pollution]] from human activity, including oil spills and also presents a problem for freshwater resources.  The largest [[petroleum]] spill that has ever occurred in fresh water was caused by a [[Royal Dutch Shell]] tank ship in Magdalena, [[Argentina]], on 15 January 1999, polluting the environment, drinkable water, plants and animals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.petroleomagdalena.com Petroleomagdalena.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100514095121/http://www.petroleomagdalena.com/ |date=14 May 2010 }}. Petroleomagdalena.com (15 January 1999). Retrieved on 29 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Chemical contamination of fresh water can also seriously damage eco-systems.

== Human uses ==

=== Agriculture ===
Water used for agriculture is called ''agricultural water'' or ''[[farm water]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = USDA Economic Research Service - Irrigation &amp; Water Use|url = http://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/farm-practices-management/irrigation-water-use.aspx|website = www.ers.usda.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-17|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151115155026/http://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/farm-practices-management/irrigation-water-use.aspx|archive-date = 2015-11-15|dead-url = no|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Changing landscape for the use of agriculture has a great effect on the flow of fresh water. Changes in landscape by the removal of trees and [[soil]]s changes the flow of fresh water in the local environment and also affects the cycle of fresh water. As a result, more fresh water is stored in the soil which benefits agriculture. However, since agriculture is the [[human]] activity that consumes the most fresh water,&lt;ref name="Gordon"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gordon L., D. M. |year=2003|title= Land cover change and water vapour flows: learning from Australia|volume= 358 |issue=1440|pages= 1973–1984|doi=10.1098/rstb.2003.1381 |jstor=3558315|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |pmid=14728792 |pmc=1693281}}&lt;/ref&gt; this can put a severe strain on local freshwater resources resulting in the destruction of local ecosystems. 

In Australia,  over-abstraction of fresh water for intensive [[irrigation]] activities has caused 33% of the land area to be at risk of salination.&lt;ref name="Gordon" /&gt; With regards to agriculture, the [[World Bank]] targets food production and water management as an increasingly global issue that will foster debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://water.worldbank.org/water/publications/reengaging-agricultural-water-management-challenges-and-options |title=Reengaging in Agricultural Water Management: Challenges and Options |publisher=The World Bank |accessdate=30 October 2011 |pages=4–5 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105012930/http://water.worldbank.org/water/publications/reengaging-agricultural-water-management-challenges-and-options/ |archivedate=5 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Gestell''''' (or sometimes '''''Ge-stell''''') is a [[German language|German]] word used by twentieth-century German [[philosophy|philosopher]] [[Martin Heidegger]] to describe what lies behind or beneath modern [[technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

It was derived from the root word ''stellen'', which means "to put" or "to place" and combined with the German prefix ''Ge-'', which denotes a form of "gathering" or "collection".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Heidegger on Technology|last=Wendland|first=Aaron|last2=Merwin|first2=Christopher|last3=Hadjioannou|first3=Christos|publisher=Routledge|year=2018|isbn=9781138674615|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term gathers together all kinds of entities and orders them in a certain way.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

==Heidegger's notion of ''Gestell''==
Heidegger applied the concept of ''Gestell'' to his exposition of the [[essence]] of [[technology]]. He concluded that technology is fundamentally '''Enframing''' (''Gestell'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

As such, the essence of technology is ''Gestell''. Indeed, "''Gestell'', literally 'framing', is an all-encompassing view of technology, not as a means to an end, but rather a mode of [[human]] [[existence]]".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.regent.edu/acad/schcom/rojc/mdic/martin1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060110153844/http://www.regent.edu/acad/schcom/rojc/mdic/martin1.html |archivedate=2006-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such enframing pertains to the manner reality appears or unveils itself in the period of modern technology and people born into this "mode of ordering" are always embedded into the Gestell (enframing).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gendered Bodies and New Technologies: Rethinking Embodiment in a Cyber-era|last=du Preez|first=Amanda|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2009|isbn=9781443813235|location=Newcastle upon Tyne, UK|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In defining the essence of technology as ''Gestell'', Heidegger indicated that all that has come to presence in the world has been enframed. Thus what is revealed in the world, what has shown itself as itself (the truth of itself) required first an Enframing, literally a way to exist in the world, to be able to be seen and understood. Concerning the essence of technology and how we see things in our technological age, the world has been framed as the "standing-reserve." Heidegger writes,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Enframing means the gathering together of that setting-upon which sets upon man, i.e., challenges him forth, to reveal the real, in the mode of ordering, as standing-reserve. Enframing means that way of revealing which holds sway in the essence of modern technology and which is itself nothing technological.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, ''The Question Concerning Technology and Other Essays'' (New York: Harper, 1977), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Furthermore, Heidegger uses the word in a way that is uncommon by giving ''Gestell'' an active role. In ordinary usage the word would signify simply a display apparatus of some sort, like a book rack, or picture frame; but for Heidegger, ''Gestell'' is literally a challenging forth, or ''perform''ative "gathering together", for the purpose of revealing or presentation. If applied to science and modern technology, "standing reserve" is active in the case of a river once it generates electricity or the earth if revealed as a coal-mining district or the soil as a mineral deposit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Heidegger and the Work of Art History|last=Boetzkes|first=Amanda|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781409456131|location=Oxon|pages=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For some scholars, Gestell effectively explains the violence of technology. This is attributed to Heidegger's explanation that, when Gestell holds sway, "it drives out every other possibility of revealing" and that it "conceals that revealing which, in the sense of ''[[poiesis]]'', lets what presences come forth into appearance."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Heidegger's Later Philosophy|last=Young|first=Julian|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|isbn=0521809223|location=Cambridge|pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22809">[[File:Samarkand Shah-i Zinda Tuman Aqa complex cropped2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Girih pattern with inlaid floral decoration from [[:en:Shah-i-Zinda|Shah-i-Zinda]] in [[Samarkand]], [[Uzbekistan]]]]

'''Girih''' ({{lang-fa|[[wikt:گره#Persian|گره]]}}, "knot") is a decorative [[Islamic geometric patterns|Islamic geometric artform]] used in [[architecture]] and handicraft objects, consisting of angled lines that form an [[Interlace (art)|interlaced]] [[strapwork]] pattern. 

Girih decoration is believed to have been inspired by [[Roman Syria|Syrian Roman]] knotwork patterns from the 2nd century AD. The earliest girih dates from around 1000 AD, and the artform flourished until the 15th century. Girih patterns can be created in a variety of ways, including the traditional [[Compass and straightedge constructions|compass and straightedge]]; the construction of a grid of polygons; and the use of a set of [[girih tiles]] with lines drawn on them: the lines form the pattern. Patterns may be elaborated by the use of two levels of design, as at the 1453 [[Darb-e Imam]] shrine. Square repeating units of known patterns can be copied as [[stencil|templates]], and historic pattern books may have been intended for use in this way.

The 15th century [[Topkapı Scroll]] explicitly shows girih patterns together with the tilings used to create them. A set of tiles consisting of a dart and a kite shape can be used to create aperiodic [[Penrose tiling]]s, though there is no evidence that such a set was used in medieval times. Girih patterns have been used to decorate varied materials including stone screens, as at [[Fatehpur Sikri]]; plasterwork, as at [[mosque]]s and [[madrasa]]s such as Hunat Hatun, [[Kayseri]]; metal, as at [[Mosque-Madrassa of Sultan Hassan|Sultan Hassan mosque, Cairo]]; and in wood, as at the [[Great Mosque of Cordoba]].

==History==
{{further|Islamic geometric patterns}}

===Origins===
[[File:Bosra mosaic.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|2nd century Roman mosaic in [[Bosra]] with curvilinear knot patterns]]

The girih style of ornamentation is thought to have been inspired by 2nd century AD [[Roman Syria|Syrian Roman]] knotwork patterns.&lt;ref name="iranica"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gereh Sazi | work=Encyclopaedia Iranica Online| accessdate=2013-01-01| url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/gereh-sazi }}&lt;/ref&gt; These had curvilinear interlaced strapwork with three-fold rotational symmetry. The [[Umayyad Mosque]] (709–715) in Damascus, Syria has window screens made of interlacing undulating strapwork in the form of six-pointed stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Broug, Eric |title=Islamic Geometric Patterns |publisher=[[Thames and Hudson]] |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-500-28721-7 |page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early examples of [[Islamic geometric patterns]] made of straight strap lines can be seen in the architecture of the surviving gateway of the [[Rabati Malik|Ribat-i Malik]] caravanserai, Uzbekistan, built in 1078.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Broug, Eric |title=Islamic Geometric Patterns |publisher=[[Thames and Hudson]] |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-500-28721-7 |page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Islamic forms===

The earliest form of girih on a book is seen in the frontispiece of a [[Koran]] manuscript from the year 1000, found in [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Materials and Mediums | work=Pattern in Islamic Art  | accessdate=2012-02-08 |  url=http://www.patterninislamicart.com/background-notes/materials-and-mediums/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is illuminated with interlacing octagons and [[thuluth]] calligraphy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The transformation of Islamic art during the Sunni revival | author=Tabbaa, Yasser | year=2002 | publisher=I. B. Tauris | page=84| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ph7EdrzSpGoC&amp;pg=PA84 | isbn=978-1-85043-392-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In woodwork, one of the earliest surviving examples of Islamic geometric art is the 13th-century [[minbar]] (pulpit) of the [[Ibn Tulun Mosque]] in Cairo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jami' Ibn Tulun |url=http://archnet.org/sites/1522/media_contents/6256 |accessdate=25 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Broug, Eric |title=Islamic Geometric Patterns |publisher=[[Thames and Hudson]] |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-500-28721-7 |pages=66–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Girih patterns can be created in woodwork in two different ways. In one, a wooden grille with polygons and stars is created; the holes can be left as they are, or filled with some material. In the other, called ''gereh-chini''&lt;ref name="iranSociety"&gt;{{cite web| title=Pattern, Cognition and contemplation: Exploring the Geometric Art of Iran | author=Henry, Richard | year=2007 | publisher=Iran Society | url=http://www.iransociety.org/docs/journal_2007.pdf | accessdate=2012-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; small wooden panels of geometric shapes are created individually, and combined to create an elaborate design.&lt;ref name="iranica"/&gt;

The term "girih" was used in Turkish for polygonal strap patterns in architecture as early as the late 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Bir Belgeye Göre Amasya II. Bayezid Külliyesi | author=Dündar, A. | journal= Ankara Üniverstesi İlahiyat Fakültesi Dergisi | volume= 44 | issue=2 | pages= 131–172 | year=2003 | url=http://dergiler.ankara.edu.tr/dergiler/37/727/9212.pdf | language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same period, artisans compiled girih pattern books such as the [[Topkapı Scroll]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Mathematics of Egypt, Mesopotamia, China, India, and Islam | author=Katz, V. J. | page=620 | publisher=Princeton University Press | year=2007 | isbn=978-0-691-11485-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ullzl036UEC&amp;pg=PA620 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While curvilinear precedents of girih were seen in the 10th century, fully developed girih patterns were not seen before the 11th century in Iran. It became a dominant design element in the 11th and 12th centuries, as in the carved [[stucco]] panels with interlaced girih of the [[Kharraqan towers]] (1067) near [[Qazvin Province|Qazvin, Iran]].&lt;ref name="iranica"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Architecture – iv. Central Asian | work=Encyclopaedia Iranica | url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/architecture-iv | accessdate=2012-02-08| date=August 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stylized plant decorations were sometimes co-ordinated with girih.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Urban development and architecture | author=Pugachenkova, G. A.; Dani, A. H. Dani; Yinsheng, Liu | work=History of Civilizations of Central Asia Volume IV: The Age of Achievement: A.D. 750 to the End of the Fifteenth Century – Part Two: The Achievements | isbn=978-92-3-103654-5 | url=http://unesco.culture.free.fr/asia-new/html_eng/chapitre4218/chapitre1.htm| publisher=UNESCO | year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Safavid]] period, the use of girih continued in the [[Seljuk dynasty|Seljuk]] and [[Ilkhanid]] periods. In the 14th century, girih became a minor element in the decorative arts; it was largely replaced by vegetal patterns during the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] era, but continued to be important in decorative arts in Central Asian monuments after that time.&lt;ref name="iranica"/&gt;

===Compass and straight edge===
{{further|Compass and straightedge constructions}}

Girih consists of geometric designs, often of stars and polygons, which can be constructed in a variety of ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Allen, Terry |year=2004| title=Islamic Art and the Argument from Academic Geometry | url=http://sonic.net/~tallen/palmtree/academicgeometry.htm | accessdate=2012-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Girih star and polygon patterns with 5- and 10-fold rotational symmetry are known to have been made as early as the 13th century. Such figures can be drawn by [[Compass and straightedge constructions|compass and straightedge]]. The first girih patterns were made by copying a pattern template on a [[Lattice graph|regular grid]]; the pattern was drawn with [[Compass (drawing tool)|compass]] and [[straightedge]]. Today, artisans using traditional techniques use a pair of [[Caliper#Divider caliper|dividers]] to leave an incision mark on a paper sheet that has been left in the sun to make it brittle.

===Polygons in contact===
One of the early Western students of Islamic patterns, [[Ernest Hanbury Hankin]], defined a "geometrical arabesque" as a pattern formed "with the help of construction lines consisting of polygons in contact."&lt;ref name=Hankin&gt;{{cite book |last=Hankin |first=Ernest Hanbury |authorlink=Ernest Hanbury Hankin |title=The Drawing of Geometric Patterns in Saracenic Art. Memoirs of the Archaeological Survey of India No. 15 |date=1925 |publisher=Government of India Central Publication Branch |url=http://www.islamic-art.org/ArticlesOnline/BAViewPDF.asp?ArticleID=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; He observed that many different combinations of polygons can be used as long as the residual spaces between the polygons are reasonably symmetrical. For example, a grid of octagons in contact has squares (of the same side as the octagons) as the residual spaces. Every octagon is the basis for an 8-point star, as seen at [[Tomb of Akbar the Great|Akbar's tomb, Sikandra]] (1605–1613). Hankin considered the "skill of the Arabian artists in discovering suitable combinations of polygons&amp;nbsp;... almost astounding."&lt;ref name=Hankin/&gt;

===Girih tiles===

{{main|Girih tiles}}

By the 15th century, some girih patterns were no longer periodic, and may have been constructed using [[girih tiles]]. This method is based on a set of five tiles with lines drawn on them; when used to tile the plane with no gaps, the lines on the tiles form a girih pattern. It is not yet known when girih tiles were first used for architectural decoration instead of compass and straightedge, but it was probably at the start of the 13th century.&lt;ref name="Lu and Steinhardt"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Peter J.

===Two-level design===
{{triple image|right|Darb-i Imam shrine spandrel.JPG|125|Spandrel-large scale pattern.svg|125|Darbeimam subdivision rule.svg|125|Girih pattern on a [[spandrel]] from the [[Darb-i Imam]] shrine, Isfahan, Iran|Reconstruction of the larger-scale thick line pattern with larger tiles, and a spandrel in yellow|Subdivision rule for the spandrel's pattern|||}}

The girih patterns on the [[Darb-e Imam]] shrine built in 1453 at [[Isfahan]] had a much more complex pattern than any previously seen. The details of the pattern indicate that girih tiles, rather than compass and straightedge, were used for decorating the shrine. The patterns appear [[aperiodic]]; within the area on the wall where they are displayed, they do not form a regularly repeating pattern; and they are drawn at two different scales. A large-scale pattern is discernible when the building is viewed from a distance, and a smaller-scale pattern forming part of the larger one can be seen from closer up.&lt;ref name="Lu and Steinhardt"/&gt;

Although there is evidence that some ancient girih tilings used a [[finite subdivision rule|subdivision rule]] to draw a two-level pattern, there are no known historic examples that can be repeated an infinite level of times. For example, the pattern used in the spandrel of the Darb-i Imam shrine (see figure) consists only of decagons and bowties, while the subdivision rule uses an elongated hexagon tile alongside these two shapes. Therefore, this design lacks self-similarity between the two levels.&lt;ref name="Lu and Steinhardt"/&gt;{{-}}

====Aperiodicity====
A periodic tiling of the plane is the regular repetition of a "unit cell", in the manner of a wallpaper, without any gaps. Such tilings can be seen as a two-dimensional crystal, and because of the [[crystallographic restriction theorem]], the unit cell is restricted to a rotational symmetry of 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold. It is therefore impossible to tile the plane periodically with a figure that has five-fold rotational symmetry, such as a five-pointed star or a decagon. Patterns with infinite perfect quasi-periodic translational order can have crystallographically forbidden rotational symmetries such as pentagonal or decagonal shapes. These [[quasi-crystalline tiling]]s contain shapes with five-fold symmetry that repeat periodically, in between other shapes that do not repeat.&lt;ref name="Lu and Steinhardt"/&gt;

One way to create quasi-periodic patterns is to create a [[Penrose tiling]]. Girih tiles can be subdivided into Penrose tiles called "dart" and "kite", but there is no evidence that this approach was used by medieval artisans.&lt;ref name="Lu and Steinhardt"/&gt; Another way to create quasiperiodic patterns is by subdividing girih tiles repeatedly into smaller tiles using a subdivision rule. In the limit the plane would be divided into girih tiles that repeat with frequencies that are aperiodic. The use of such a subdivision rule would serve as evidence that Islamic artisans of the 15th century were aware that girih tiles can produce complex patterns that never exactly repeat themselves. However, no known patterns made with girih tiles have more than a two-level design. There would have been no practical need for a girih pattern with more than two levels of design, as a third level would be either too large or too small to be perceived. It appears that medieval Islamic artisans were using a tool that had the potential of creating highly complex patterns, but they never realized it. As E. Makovicky argues,&lt;ref name=Makovicky&gt;{{cite web| author=Emil Makovicky| title=Comment on "Decagonal and Quasi-Crystalline Tilings in Medieval Islamic Architecture" |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/318/5855/1383.1.full | accessdate=2012-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|The artisans were satisfied by creating a large fundamental domain without being concerned with the mathematical notion of indefinitely expandable quasiperiodic patterns. However, they understood and used to their advantage some of the local geometric properties of the quasi-crystalline patterns they constructed.&lt;ref name=Makovicky/&gt;}}

====The Topkapı Scroll====
{{multiple image|align=right|image1=Panel50.PNG|width1=100|caption1=A [[Topkapı Scroll]] panel; featuring a girih pattern in black with red tiles|image2=Panel29.JPG |width2=150 |caption2=Topkapı scroll panel with patterns at two scales and tiles used|image3=Panel28a.PNG|width3=150|caption3=Reconstruction of the small scale pattern (thick black lines) in left panel, using small tiles|image4=Panel28b.PNG|width4=150|caption4=Reconstruction of the large scale pattern (thick red lines) in left panel, using large tiles}}

The [[Topkapı Scroll]], from the late 15th century, documents the use of girih tiles to create girih patterns. The drawings in this pattern book show the girih lines superimposed on the tiles used to generate the pattern, making the construction fully evident.&lt;ref name="Lu and Steinhardt"/&gt;

===Templates===
Once a repeating pattern has been constructed, regardless of the method used, the pattern can be recreated by copying a repeating unit of it, like the pattern of a wallpaper, as a paper [[stencil|template]]. The pattern can then simply be pricked through on to the surface to be decorated. The Topkapı Scroll grids may well have been meant for use as such templates.&lt;ref name=Necipoglu/&gt;&lt;!--p47--&gt; The ''Anonymous Compendium'' contains square repeat units for many girih patterns.&lt;ref name=Necipoglu/&gt;&lt;!--p42--&gt; Ibn al-Razzaz al-Jazari's ''Compendium of Science and Useful Practice in the Mechanical Arts'' contains explicit templates for special purposes such as cast bronze doors.&lt;ref name=Necipoglu/&gt;&lt;!--p44--&gt;

== Girih on varied surfaces ==

=== Girih on windows ===
[[File:Colorful window, Dowlat Abad Garden - panoramio.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|Colourful window of Dowlad Abad Garden]]
The girih has been widely applied on the architecture. The patterns on the Persian geometric windows meet the need of the Persian architecture, as the ornateness of windows indicated the social and economic status of the owner. A good example is Azad Koliji, a Dowlatabad Garden in Iran. With the girih patterns on its window, the architects manage to demonstrate multiple layers. The first layer is the actual garden which people can see when they open the window. And the second layer is the artificial garden as the girih patterns are on the outside of the window is the carved pattern and a colorful glass is below it which creates an illusion of a beautiful garden. The multi-colour layer create a sense of a mass of flowers. The artificial layer is abstract which forms a clear contradiction with the real layer outside the window and gives the audience enough space of imagination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koliji|first=Hooman|date=2015|title=Built on Light: The 'Crafty' Art of Geometric Patterned Windows|url=http://openurl.ingenta.com/content/xref?genre=article&amp;issn=2045-5895&amp;volume=4&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=75|journal=International Journal of Islamic Architecture|volume=4|pages=75-108|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Girih on domes ===
In addition to the plain platforms like the windows, the girih patterns on the domes are very popular as well. However, due to the curve shape, the domes need special techniques. The most important one is called “Dast-Garden” method. This method refers to the number of star polygons applied to the pattern are depending on the change of the dome curvature. Decreasing the curvature of a dome surface leads to the decreasing of the number of points on a star polygon. Thus, the shape of the girih pattern is heavily relying on the dome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mohammad|first=Kasraei|date=2016|title=Girih for Domes: Analysis of Three Iranian Domes|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00004-015-0282-4|journal=Nexus Network Journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Girih on walls ===
The girih patterns are very likely to be all over the walls in some Islamic architectures. The decorating lines connect to each other and form a continuous network across the entire tiling with edges combine together. The girih patterns vary a lot on the surface, with different geometric shapes including decagons, hexagons, bowties and rhombuses. Among all these patterns, a special technique is shared: "self-similar transformation". The mapping is completed by using this freedom to eliminate the edge difference of these patterns and reduce the edge mismatches to the lowest degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lu|first=Peter|date=February 2017|title=Decagonal and Quasi-Crystalline Tilings in Medieval Islamic Architectur|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.1135491|journal=Science|volume=315|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Goedele Maria Gertrude Liekens''' (born 21 January 1963),&lt;ref name="B&amp;G"&gt;{{nl}} [http://www.beeldengeluidwiki.nl/index.php/Goedele_Liekens Goedele Liekens] Beeld en Geluid wiki, retrieved 30 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Flanders|Flemish]] [[psychologist]] and [[sexologist]].&lt;ref name="Leuven"&gt;{{nl}} [http://nieuws.kuleuven.be/node/14323 Leven na Leuven: seksuologe en presentatrice Goedele Liekens], kuleuven.be, 19 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; She is a former [[Miss Belgium]] (1986) and currently also works as a [[television presenter]], in the [[Netherlands]] as well as her native Belgium. Outside the [[Low Countries]], she may be best known for presenting ''[[Sex in Class]]'' on [[Channel 4]] in the UK, early August 2015. She and [[Steve Jones (presenter)|Steve Jones]] present the second series of ''[[Sex Box]]''.

==Career==
Liekens became famous by winning the Miss Belgium contest in May 1986.&lt;ref name="B&amp;G" /&gt; During the following [[Miss Universe]] contest in [[Panama]] Liekens refused to attend extracurricular events for guests that paid extra for those. She also refused to shake hands with then head of state [[Manuel Noriega]] for his "leading a wrong regime".

Liekens studied psychology and [[sexology]], receiving a degree from the [[Free University of Brussels]] in 1987. She re-attended university in 1991, studying Family and Sexual Studies at the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven|KU]] in [[Leuven]], earning her degree in 2003. She worked for the sexuality and planned parenthood organisation [[Rutgers Nisso Group]] from 1992 to 1996.&lt;ref name="Leuven" /&gt;

===Media===
Liekens appeared as a sexology expert in several programs of Flemish and Dutch television and did a radio show for a while.&lt;ref name="B&amp;G" /&gt; She got her first show to present in the late 1980s and has done about a dozen since.&lt;ref name="B&amp;G" /&gt; At first her programmes centred on sex and sex education, but from the mid 1990s onwards Liekens hosted other shows as well, like the Flemish version of ''[[International versions of The Weakest Link|Weakest Link]]''. Liekens worked for a variety of stations in Belgium and the Netherlands, most notably the [[Vtm]] and [[RTL 4]].&lt;ref name="B&amp;G" /&gt;

She has published several books on sex-related matters, wrote columns for magazines including [[Playboy]] and has had two magazines of her own. Liekens co-founded the now defunct production company Jok Foe in 2001,&lt;ref name="Leuven" /&gt; which produced various programs, such as ''The Planckaerts'', a reality soap starring former road racing cyclist [[Eddy Planckaert]].

===UNFPA===
Since 1999 Liekens is a [[United Nations Population Fund Goodwill Ambassador]] in the area of [[reproductive health]].&lt;ref name="Leuven" /&gt; In this work she has advocated women's rights,&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.unfpa.org/goedele-liekens Goedele Liekens] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20151126115052/http://web.unfpa.org/goedele-liekens |date=26 November 2015 }}, UNFPA.org, retrieved 30 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; helped to fight [[obstetric fistula]] in developing countries and generally argued for a broader sexual education that must include the pleasures of it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unfpa.org/news/girls%E2%80%99-rights-goedele-liekens-looks-back-15-years-progress Girls’ rights: Goedele Liekens looks back on 15 years of progress], UNFPA.org, retrieved 30 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Sex in Class''===
In August 2015, Channel 4 aired a show in which Liekens talked to thirteen British [[teenagers]] about sex and [[pornography]].&lt;ref name="LE"&gt;Brunskell-Evans, H. (2015); "[https://theconversation.com/sex-in-class-liekens-is-right-to-teach-teenagers-about-sexual-pleasure-45678 Sex in Class: Liekens is right to teach teenagers about sexual pleasure]"; website Leicester University, retrieved 30 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The one-off programme made headlines across the UK, mainly for her open attitude towards sensitive subjects.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/11779957/Sex-in-Class-Channel-4-brings-pornography-into-the-classroom.html Channel 4 sex education documentary brings pornography into the classroom], ''The Telegraph'', 3 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; According to some the show pointed out that British teenagers suffer a serious deficiency in their sex education, a gap they fill by watching [[pornography]], with a horde of misconceptions as a result.&lt;ref name="LE" /&gt; Liekens has argued that the [[General Certificate of Secondary Education]] must include a much broader and mandatory sexual education than at present.&lt;ref name="LE" /&gt;

The '''heat death of the universe''' is a plausible [[ultimate fate of the universe]] in which the [[universe]] has evolved to a state of no [[thermodynamic free energy]] and therefore can no longer sustain processes that increase [[entropy]]. Heat death does not imply any particular [[Thermodynamic temperature#Internal energy at absolute zero|absolute temperature]]; it only requires that temperature differences or other processes may no longer be exploited to perform [[work (thermodynamics)|work]]. In the language of [[physics]], this is when the universe reaches [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] (maximum entropy).

If the topology of the universe is [[Big Freeze|open or flat]], or if [[dark energy]] is a positive [[cosmological constant]] (both of which are consistent with current data), the universe will continue expanding forever, and a heat death is expected to occur,&lt;ref name="DftS"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the universe cooling to approach equilibrium at a very low temperature after a very long time period.

The hypothesis of heat death stems from the ideas of [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin]] (Lord Kelvin), who in the 1850s took the [[theory of heat]] as [[mechanical energy]] loss in nature (as embodied in the first two [[laws of thermodynamics]]) and extrapolated it to larger processes on a universal scale.

==Origins of the idea==
The idea of heat death stems from the [[second law of thermodynamics]], of which one version states that entropy tends to increase in an [[isolated system]]. From this, the hypothesis infers that if the universe lasts for a sufficient time, it will [[asymptotically]] approach a state where all [[energy]] is evenly distributed. In other words, according to this hypothesis, there is a tendency in nature to the [[dissipation]] (energy transformation) of [[mechanical energy]] (motion) into [[thermal energy]]; hence, by extrapolation, there exists the view that, in time, the mechanical movement of the universe will run down as work is converted to heat because of the second law.

The conjecture that all bodies in the universe cool off, eventually becoming too cold to support life, seems to have been first put forward by the French astronomer [[Jean Sylvain Bailly]] in 1777 in his writings on the history of astronomy and in the ensuing correspondence with [[Voltaire]]. In Bailly's view, all planets have an [[Internal heating|internal heat]] and are now at some particular stage of cooling. [[Jupiter]], for instance, is still too hot for life to arise there for thousands of years, while the [[Moon]] is already too cold. The final state, in this view, is described as one of "equilibrium" in which all motion ceases.&lt;ref&gt;

The idea of heat death as a consequence of the laws of thermodynamics, however, was first proposed in loose terms beginning in 1851 by William Thomson, who theorized further on the mechanical energy loss views of [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] (1824), [[James Joule]] (1843), and [[Rudolf Clausius]] (1850). Thomson's views were then elaborated on more definitively over the next decade by [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] and [[William Rankine]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

===History===
The idea of heat death of the universe derives from discussion of the application of the first two laws of thermodynamics to universal processes. Specifically, in 1851, William Thomson outlined the view, as based on recent experiments on the dynamical [[theory of heat]]: "heat is not a substance, but a dynamical form of mechanical effect, we perceive that there must be an equivalence between mechanical work and heat, as between cause and effect."&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, Sir William. (1851). [https://zapatopi.net/kelvin/papers/on_the_dynamical_theory_of_heat.html "On the Dynamical Theory of Heat, with numerical results deduced from Mr Joule’s equivalent of a Thermal Unit, and M. Regnault’s Observations on Steam"] Excerpts. [§§1–14 &amp; §§99–100], ''[[Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh]]'', March 1851, and ''[[Philosophical Magazine|Philosophical Magazine IV]]'', 1852. [from ''Mathematical and Physical Papers'', vol. i, art. XLVIII, pp. 174]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Lord Kelvin photograph.jpg|175px|right|thumb|[[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]] originated the idea of universal heat death in 1852.]]

In 1852, Thomson published ''On a Universal Tendency in Nature to the Dissipation of Mechanical Energy'', in which he outlined the rudiments of the second law of thermodynamics summarized by the view that mechanical motion and the energy used to create that motion will naturally tend to dissipate or run down.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, Sir William (1852). [https://zapatopi.net/kelvin/papers/on_a_universal_tendency.html "On a Universal Tendency in Nature to the Dissipation of Mechanical Energy"] ''[[Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh]]'' for 19 April 1852, also ''[[Philosophical Magazine]]'', Oct. 1852. [This version from ''Mathematical and Physical Papers'', vol. i, art. 59, pp. 511.]&lt;/ref&gt; The ideas in this paper, in relation to their application to the age of the [[Sun]] and the dynamics of the universal operation, attracted the likes of William Rankine and Hermann von Helmholtz. The three of them were said to have exchanged ideas on this subject.&lt;ref name="Energy and Empire"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1862, Thomson published "On the age of the Sun’s heat", an article in which he reiterated his fundamental beliefs in the indestructibility of energy (the [[first law of thermodynamics|first law]]) and the universal dissipation of energy (the second law), leading to diffusion of heat, cessation of useful motion ([[work (physics)|work]]), and exhaustion of [[potential energy]] through the material universe, while clarifying his view of the consequences for the universe as a whole. In a key paragraph, Thomson wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The result would inevitably be a state of universal rest and death, if the universe were finite and left to obey existing laws. But it is impossible to conceive a limit to the extent of matter in the universe; and therefore science points rather to an endless progress, through an endless space, of action involving the transformation of [[potential energy]] into [[Work (physics)|palpable motion]] and hence into [[heat]], than to a single finite mechanism, running down like a clock, and stopping for ever.&lt;ref&gt;

In the years to follow both Thomson's 1852 and the 1865 papers, Helmholtz and Rankine both credited Thomson with the idea, but read further into his papers by publishing views stating that Thomson argued that the universe will end in a "''heat death''" (Helmholtz) which will be the "''end of all physical phenomena''" (Rankine).&lt;ref name="Energy and Empire" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Proposals about the final state of the universe depend on the assumptions made about its ultimate fate, and these assumptions have varied considerably over the late 20th century and early 21st century. In a hypothesized [[Shape of the universe|"open" or "flat" universe]] that continues expanding indefinitely, either a heat death or a [[Big Rip]] is expected to eventually occur.&lt;ref name="DftS" /&gt; If the [[cosmological constant]] is zero, the universe will approach absolute zero temperature over a very long timescale. However, if the cosmological constant is [[Cosmological constant#Positive value|positive]], as appears to be the case in recent observations, the temperature will asymptote to a non-zero positive value, and the universe will approach a state of maximum entropy.&lt;ref&gt;

If a Big Rip doesn't happen long before that, the "heat death" situation could be avoided if there is a method or mechanism to regenerate [[hydrogen]] atoms from [[radiation]], [[dark matter]], [[dark energy]], [[zero-point energy]], or other sources so that [[star formation]] and [[heat transfer]] can continue to avoid a gradual running down of the universe due to the conversion of matter into energy and heavier elements in [[Stellar nucleosynthesis|stellar processes]] and the absorption of matter by [[black hole]]s and their subsequent evaporation as [[Hawking radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;

From the [[Big Bang]] through the present day, [[matter]] and [[dark matter]] in the universe are thought to have been concentrated in [[star]]s, [[galaxies]], and [[galaxy cluster]]s, and are presumed to continue to be so well into the future.

A recent analysis of entropy states, "The entropy of a general gravitational field is still not known", and, "gravitational entropy is difficult to quantify". The analysis considers several possible assumptions that would be needed for estimates and suggests that the [[observable universe]] has more entropy than previously thought. This is because the analysis concludes that supermassive black holes are the largest contributor.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lee Smolin]] goes further: "It has long been known that gravity is important for keeping the universe out of thermal equilibrium. Gravitationally bound systems have negative specific heat—that is, the velocities of their components increase when energy is removed. ... Such a system does not evolve toward a homogeneous equilibrium state. Instead it becomes increasingly structured and heterogeneous as it fragments into subsystems."&lt;ref&gt;

'''GEC Hirst Research Centre''' was one of the first specialised industrial research laboratories to be built in Britain, and was part of the [[General Electric Company plc]] empire. It was demolished in the early 1990s primarily because GEC had stopped funding serious research, as it was not immediately profitable. 

It was named after [[Baron Hirst|Hugo Hirst]], one of the founders of the company that would become [[General Electric Company plc]]. One of the centre's most famous achievements was the production of the [[cavity magnetron]] during [[World War II]], the concept of which was established by [[John Randall (physicist)|Randall]] and [[Harry Boot|Boot]] working at [[University of Birmingham|Birmingham University]]. Staff of the center were also important in developing [[radars]] for use during the war.  The 60 m [[Radio mast]] at the back of the building became, along with [[Wembley Stadium (1924)|Wembley Stadium]], one of the landmarks of the area. Hirst was also instrumental in setting up the [[National Grid (UK)|National Grid]] system which provides power to the whole of the UK. The centre also worked on the design of electrical power systems used on the British railways network.

The research centre was based in East Lane, [[Wembley]], [[Middlesex]], [[UK]], and then in the 1990s moved to [[Borehamwood]], [[UK]].

After GEC had left the Wembley site, it was used as the set for some scenes of the 1995 film, [[Young Poisoner's Handbook]].

'''''Hunger Makes Me a Modern Girl''''' is a 2015 memoir by [[Carrie Brownstein]], a bisexual guitarist and singer.&lt;ref name="Compton2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rowe2015/&gt; Named for one of her lyrics, is about her life in and around music. Starting with her as a young hyper-performative young nerd, who runs for vice president of her Washington State elementary school. The story goes on to cover Brownstein's escape from a turbulent family life into a world where music was the means toward self-invention, community, and rescue. Along the way, Brownstein chronicles the excitement and contradictions within the era’s flourishing and fiercely independent music subculture, including experiences that sowed the seeds for the observational satire of the popular television series ''Portlandia,'' years later.

==Publication history==
Brownstein published the 256-page memoir with [[Riverhead Books|Riverhead]], an imprint of [[Penguin Group]], on October 27, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/9781594486630|title=Nonfiction Book Review: Hunger Makes Me a Modern Girl: A Memoir by Carrie Brownstein.

==Reception==
The book received largely positive reviews. In ''[[The Guardian]]'', Michelle Dean compared Brownstein's writing to her band [[Sleater-Kinney]]'s "intensity", saying "Brownstein’s book has a similarly fierce approach," and felt that even if "there are certainly places where an editor could and should have chiseled her prose down to make her points sharper and more affecting, this book is the clear product of a very intelligent person, and filled with flashes of insight and wit."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/nov/07/hunger-makes-me-a-modern-girl-by-carrie-brownstein-review|title=Hunger Makes Me a Modern Girl: Carrie Brownstein's darkly compelling read|last=Dean|first=Michelle|date=2015-11-07|work=The Guardian|access-date=2018-01-11|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in ''[[The New York Times]]'', John Williams contrasted the tone of ''Hunger'' with Brownstein's work in Sleater-Kinney, saying "readers who have...thrilled to Ms. Brownstein’s supremely confident antics onstage...may be disappointed by this memoir’s nearly incessant tone of self-deprecation...But Ms. Brownstein is interested in telling us who she is — and how she sees herself — without a guitar in her hands. 'I was relieved that music had done exactly what I had always wanted it to do,' she writes in this both candid and evasive book, 'which was turn me into someone else.'"&lt;ref name=Williams2015 /&gt;

==Television adaptation==
Brownstein is adapting her memoir into a half-hour television [[Pilot (television episode)|pilot]], entitled ''Search and Destroy'', for streaming service [[Hulu]]. She is set to write, direct, and executive produce alongside [[Megan Ellison]], [[Sue Naegle]], and Ali Krug. The pilot is being produced by [[Annapurna Pictures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goldberg|first1=Lesley|title=Carrie Brownstein Adapting Her Memoir as Hulu Comedy Pilot|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/carrie-brownstein-adapting-her-memoir-as-hulu-comedy-pilot-1074036|website=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=January 11, 2018|language=en|date=January 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andreeva|first1=Nellie|title=Hulu Orders ‘Search &amp; Destroy’ Comedy Pilot From Carrie Brownstein &amp; Annapurna|url=http://deadline.com/2018/01/carrie-brownstein-search-destroy-based-hunger-makes-me-a-modern-girl-memoir-pilot-hulu-1202240837/|website=Deadline|accessdate=January 11, 2018|date=January 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 8, 2018, it was announced that [[Taylor Dearden]] and [[Aubrey Peeples]] had been cast in the show's lead roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goldberg|first1=Lesley|title=Hulu's Carrie Brownstein Comedy Finds Leads in Taylor Dearden, Aubrey Peeples|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/hulus-carrie-brownstein-comedy-finds-leads-taylor-dearden-aubrey-peeples-1093201|website=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=March 9, 2018|language=en|date=March 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 18, 2018, it was reported that [[Brad Morris]], Leah Harvey, [[Jessica Hecht]], and Imogen Tear had joined the main cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Petski|first1=Denise|title=‘Search and Destroy’: Hulu’s Carrie Brownstein Comedy Pilot Adds Four To Cast|url=http://deadline.com/2018/05/search-and-destroy-hulu-carrie-brownstein-comedy-pilot-cast-brad-morris-leah-harvey-jessica-hecht-imogen-tear-1202393535/|website=Deadline|accessdate=May 18, 2018|date=May 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''King's Manor''' is a Grade I [[listed building]] in [[York]], [[England]], and is part of the [[University of York]].

==History==
King's Manor was originally built to house the abbots of [[St Mary's Abbey, York]].&lt;ref name=past&gt;{{PastScape|mnumber=58182 |mname=King's Manor, York|accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Abbot's house probably occupied the site since the eleventh century, but the earliest remains date from the fifteenth century.  When the abbey was dissolved in 1539, [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] instructed that it be the seat of the [[Council of the North]].&lt;ref name=past/&gt; It performed this role until the Council was abolished in 1641.&lt;ref name=past/&gt;  From 1667 to 1688, it was the residence of the Governor of York. During the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, the Governor, [[Sir John Reresby, 2nd Baronet]], remained loyal to the King, James II, but a party of armed men, led by Thomas Osborne, Earl of Danby, captured the Manor and the City of York, and held them for [[William III of England|William of Orange]]. After 1688, the building was hired out to private tenants until the nineteenth century, when it was taken over and expanded by the Yorkshire School for the Blind.&lt;ref name=past/&gt; For a detailed description of the history and architecture of the building, perhaps the best source is that contained in the RCHME Inventory of the City of York, Volume IV.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/rchme/york/vol4/pp30-43|title=The King's Manor {{!}} British History Online|website=www.british-history.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use by University of York ==
On the departure of the Blind School in 1958, the Manor was acquired by York City Council, who leased it to the University in 1963.&lt;ref name="past" /&gt;  The main University later moved to the Heslington Campus. From 1966, the principal academic department to use the Manor was the Institute of Advanced Architectural Studies (IoAAS). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ip51.icomos.org/~fleblanc/projects/1971-1979_PC/p_pc_uk_york_course/p_pc_york_course_program.pdf|title=IoAAS courses description|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IoAAS was a leading UK provider of mid-career education for architects and related professionals, specialising latterly in architectural conservation studies. The main public room of the Manor is the Huntingdon Room, used for courses and meetings. As well as the IoAAS, there were several other Departments in the King’s Manor, the main ones being the Centre for Medieval Studies, a Language Teaching centre and the Design Unit (an architectural practice, but part of the IoAAS). The building also housed six University staff flats. The Dining Room provided an important place for the meeting of ‘town and gown’, especially in the early years of the University. Following the closure of the IoAAS, the main occupant became the [[Department of Archaeology at the University of York|Department of Archaeology]] (including the [[Archaeology Data Service]]), plus the Centre for Medieval Studies and the Centre for Eighteenth Century Studies.&lt;ref name="past" /&gt;

The most widely used type of speaker in the 2010s is the '''dynamic speaker,''' invented in 1925 by [[Edward W. Kellogg]] and [[Chester W. Rice]].  The dynamic speaker operates on the same basic principle as a [[dynamic microphone]], but in reverse, to produce sound from an electrical signal. When an alternating current electrical [[audio signal]] is applied to its [[voice coil]], a coil of wire suspended in a circular gap between the poles of a [[permanent magnet]], the coil is forced to move rapidly back and forth due to [[Faraday's law of induction]], which causes a [[diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]] (usually conically shaped) attached to the coil to move back and forth, pushing on the air to create [[sound wave]]s. Besides this most common method, there are several alternative technologies that can be used to convert an electrical signal into sound. The sound source (e.g., a sound recording or a microphone) must be amplified or strengthened with an [[audio power amplifier]] before the signal is sent to the speaker.

Speakers are typically housed in a [[speaker enclosure]] or speaker cabinet which is often a rectangular or square box made of wood or sometimes plastic. The enclosure's materials and design  play an important role in the quality of the sound.   Where [[high fidelity]] reproduction of sound is required, multiple loudspeaker transducers are often mounted in the same enclosure, each reproducing a part of the audible frequency range ''(picture at right)''.  In this case the individual speakers are referred to as "drivers" and the entire unit is called a loudspeaker.  Drivers made for reproducing high audio frequencies are called [[tweeter]]s, those for middle frequencies are called [[mid-range speaker|mid-range]] drivers, and those for low frequencies are called [[woofer]]s. Smaller loudspeakers are found in devices such as [[Radio receiver|radios]], [[television]]s, portable audio players, [[computer]]s, and [[electronic musical instrument]]s. Larger loudspeaker systems are used for music, [[Sound reinforcement system|sound reinforcement]] in theatres and concerts, and in [[public address system]]s.

==Terminology==
The term "loudspeaker" may refer to individual transducers (also known as "drivers") or to complete speaker systems consisting of an [[Loudspeaker enclosure|enclosure]] including one or more drivers.
 
To adequately reproduce a wide range of frequencies with even coverage, most loudspeaker systems employ more than one driver, particularly for higher [[sound pressure level]] or maximum accuracy. Individual drivers are used to reproduce different frequency ranges. The drivers are named [[subwoofer]]s (for very low frequencies); [[woofer]]s (low frequencies); [[mid-range speaker]]s (middle frequencies); [[tweeter]]s (high frequencies); and sometimes [[supertweeters]], optimized for the highest audible frequencies. The terms for different speaker drivers differ, depending on the application. In two-way systems there is no mid-range driver, so the task of reproducing the mid-range sounds falls upon the woofer and tweeter. Home stereos use the designation "tweeter" for the high frequency driver, while professional concert systems may designate them as "HF" or "highs". When multiple drivers are used in a system, a "filter network", called a [[Audio crossover|crossover]], separates the incoming signal into different frequency ranges and routes them to the appropriate driver. A loudspeaker system with ''n'' separate frequency bands is described as "''n''-way speakers": a two-way system will have a woofer and a tweeter; a three-way system employs a woofer, a mid-range, and a tweeter. Loudspeaker driver of the type pictured are termed  "dynamic" (short for electrodynamic) to distinguish them from earlier drivers (i.e., [[moving iron speaker]]), or speakers using [[Piezoelectric speakers#Piezo tweeter|piezoelectric]] or [[Electrostatic loudspeaker|electrostatic]] systems, or any of several other sorts.

==History==
[[Johann Philipp Reis]] installed an electric loudspeaker in his ''[[telephone]]'' in 1861; it was capable of reproducing clear tones, but also could reproduce muffled [[speech]] after a few revisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.integratednetworkcable.com/technology/the-forgotten-johann-philipp-reis |title=The Forgotten Johann Philipp Reis |accessdate=2015-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612190406/https://www.integratednetworkcable.com/technology/the-forgotten-johann-philipp-reis |archivedate=2015-06-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Graham Bell]] patented his first electric loudspeaker (capable of reproducing intelligible speech) as part of his telephone in 1876, which was followed in 1877 by an improved version from [[Ernst Werner von Siemens|Ernst Siemens]].  During this time, [[Thomas Edison]] was issued a British patent for a system using compressed air as an amplifying mechanism for his early cylinder phonographs, but he ultimately settled for the familiar metal horn driven by a membrane attached to the stylus. In 1898, Horace Short patented a design for a loudspeaker driven by compressed air; he then sold the rights to [[Charles Algernon Parsons|Charles Parsons]], who was issued several additional British patents before 1910. A few companies, including the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] and [[Pathé]], produced record players using compressed-air loudspeakers. However, these designs were significantly limited by their poor sound quality and their inability to reproduce sound at low volume. Variants of the system were used for [[public address]] applications, and more recently, other variations have been used to test space-equipment resistance to the very loud sound and vibration levels that the launching of rockets produces.

The first experimental moving-coil (also called ''dynamic'') loudspeaker was invented by [[Oliver Lodge]] in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/recording/loudspeaker.html |title=Loudspeaker History |accessdate=2007-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060905003027/http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/recording/loudspeaker.html |archivedate=September 5, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first practical moving-coil loudspeakers were manufactured by Danish engineer [[Peter L. Jensen]] and [[Edwin Pridham]] in 1915, in [[Napa, California]].&lt;ref name=korn&gt;Kornum, Rene.

Jensen was denied patents. Being unsuccessful in selling their product to telephone companies, in 1915 they changed their target market to radios and [[public address system]]s, and named their product [[Magnavox]]. Jensen was, for years after the invention of the loudspeaker, a part owner of The Magnavox Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/recording/jensen.html |title=Jensen History |accessdate=2009-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509055508/http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/recording/jensen.html |archivedate=May 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The moving-coil principle commonly used today in speakers was patented in 1924 by [[Chester W. Rice]] and [[Edward W. Kellogg]]. The key difference between previous attempts and the patent by Rice and Kellogg is the adjustment of mechanical parameters so that the fundamental resonance of the moving system is below the frequency where the cone's radiation impedance becomes uniform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of the Audio Engineering Society|volume= 52|issue=4|year=2004|pages=412–432 (p. 416)|url=http://www.aes.org/journal/online/JAES_V52/jaes.cfm?file=JAES_V52_4/JAES_V52_4_PG412.pdf|author=[[John M.

These first loudspeakers used [[electromagnet]]s, because large, powerful [[permanent magnet]]s were generally not available at a reasonable price. The coil of an electromagnet, called a field coil, was energized by current through a second pair of connections to the driver. This winding usually served a dual role, acting also as a [[inductor|choke coil]], filtering the [[power supply]] of the [[audio power amplifier|amplifier]] that the loudspeaker was connected to. AC ripple in the current was attenuated by the action of passing through the choke coil. However, AC line frequencies tended to modulate the audio signal going to the voice coil and added to the audible hum.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}&lt;!-- Fact tag for entire paragraph --&gt; In 1930 [[Peter L. Jensen|Jensen]] introduced the first commercial fixed-magnet loudspeaker; however, the large, heavy iron magnets of the day were impractical and field-coil speakers remained predominant until the widespread availability of lightweight [[Alnico]] magnets after World War II.

In the 1930s, loudspeaker manufacturers began to combine two and three bandpasses' worth of drivers in order to increase [[frequency response]] and [[sound pressure]] level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Audio Signal Processing and Coding |last=Spanias |first=Andreas |author2=Ted Painter |author3=Venkatraman Atti  |year=2007 |publisher=Wiley-Interscience |isbn=0-470-04196-X |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J7_nVWzx1Q4C }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937, the first film industry-standard loudspeaker system, "The [http://www.audioheritage.org/html/profiles/lmco/shearer.htm Shearer Horn] System for Theatres"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lansingheritage.org/images/lmco/bulletins/2b.jpg Lansingheritage.com: (1937 brochure image) ''The Shearer Horn System for Theatres'']&lt;/ref&gt; (a two-way system), was introduced by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. It used four 15″ low-frequency drivers, a crossover network set for 375&amp;nbsp;Hz, and a single multi-cellular horn with two compression drivers providing the high frequencies. [[John Kenneth Hilliard]], [[James Bullough Lansing]], and [[Douglas Shearer]] all played roles in creating the system. At the [[1939 New York World's Fair]], a very large two-way [[public address]] system was mounted on a tower at [[Flushing Meadows]]. The eight 27″ low-frequency drivers were designed by [[Rudy Bozak]] in his role as chief engineer for Cinaudagraph. High-frequency drivers were likely made by [[Western Electric]].&lt;ref&gt;Bozak, R.T., ''Electronics'' magazine, June 1940.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Altec Lansing]] introduced the ''604'', which became their most famous coaxial [[Altec Lansing Duplex|Duplex]] driver, in 1943. It incorporated a high-frequency horn that sent sound through the middle of a 15-inch woofer for near-point-source performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lansingheritage.org/images/altec/catalogs/1943/page05.jpg Lansing Heritage.

In 1954, [[Edgar Villchur]] developed the [[acoustic suspension]] principle of loudspeaker design in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].  This allowed for better bass response than previously from drivers mounted in smaller cabinets which was important during the transition to stereo recording and reproduction.  He and his partner [[Henry Kloss]] formed the [[Acoustic Research]] company to manufacture and market speaker systems using this principle.  Subsequently, continuous developments in enclosure design and materials led to significant audible improvements.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}&lt;!--citation also needed in [[Acoustic suspension]]--&gt; The most notable improvements to date in modern dynamic drivers, and the loudspeakers that employ them, are improvements in cone materials, the introduction of higher-temperature adhesives, improved permanent [[magnet]] materials, improved measurement techniques, computer-aided design, and finite element analysis.  At low frequencies, the application of electrical network theory to the acoustic performance allowed by various enclosure designs (initially by Thiele, and later by Small) has been very important at the design level.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

The most common type of driver, commonly called a '''dynamic loudspeaker''', uses a lightweight [[diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]], or ''cone'', connected to a rigid ''basket'', or ''frame'', via a flexible suspension, commonly called a ''spider'', that constrains a [[voice coil]] to move axially through a cylindrical magnetic gap. When an electrical signal is applied to the [[voice coil]], a [[magnetic field]] is created by the electric [[Current (electricity)|current]] in the voice coil, making it a variable electromagnet. The coil and the driver's magnetic system interact, generating a mechanical force that causes the coil (and thus, the attached cone) to move back and forth, accelerating and reproducing sound under the control of the applied electrical signal coming from the [[audio power amplifier|amplifier]]. The following is a description of the individual components of this type of loudspeaker.

The diaphragm is usually manufactured with a cone- or dome-shaped profile. A variety of different materials may be used, but the most common are paper, plastic, and metal. The ideal material would 1) be rigid, to prevent uncontrolled cone motions; 2) have low mass, to minimize starting force requirements and energy storage issues; 3) be well [[Absorption (acoustics)|damped]], to reduce vibrations continuing after the signal has stopped with little or no audible ringing due to its [[resonance]] frequency as determined by its usage. In practice, all three of these criteria cannot be met simultaneously using existing materials; thus, driver design involves [[trade-off]]s. For example, paper is light and typically well damped, but is not stiff; metal may be stiff and light, but it usually has poor damping; plastic can be light, but typically, the stiffer it is made, the poorer the damping. As a result, many cones are made of some sort of composite material. For example, a cone might be made of cellulose paper, into which some [[carbon fiber]], [[Kevlar]], [[Glass (fiber)|glass]], [[hemp]] or [[bamboo]] fibers have been added; or it might use a honeycomb sandwich construction; or a coating might be applied to it so as to provide additional stiffening or damping.

The chassis, frame, or basket, is designed to be rigid, avoiding deformation that could change critical alignments with the magnet gap, perhaps causing the voice coil to rub against the sides of the gap. Chassis are typically [[Casting (metalworking)|cast]] from aluminum alloy, or [[machine press|stamped]] from thin steel sheet, though in some drivers with large magnets cast chassis are preferable as sheet metal can easily be warped in whenever the loudspeaker is subjected to rough handling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rumsey|first1=Francis|last2=McCormick|first2=Tim|title=Sound and recording|date=2009|publisher=Focal Press|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=978-0-240-52163-3|page=81|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other materials such as molded plastic and damped plastic compound baskets are becoming common, especially for inexpensive, low-mass drivers.   Metallic chassis can play an important role in conducting heat away from the voice coil; heating during operation changes resistance, causes physical dimensional changes, and if extreme, may even demagnetize permanent magnets.

The suspension system keeps the coil centered in the gap and provides a restoring (centering) force that returns the cone to a neutral position after moving. A typical suspension system consists of two parts: the ''spider'', which connects the diaphragm or voice coil to the frame and provides the majority of the restoring force, and the ''surround'', which helps center the coil/cone assembly and allows free pistonic motion aligned with the magnetic gap. The spider is usually made of a corrugated fabric disk, impregnated with a stiffening resin. The name comes from the shape of early suspensions, which were two concentric rings of [[Bakelite]] material, joined by six or eight curved "legs." Variations of this topology included the addition of a felt disc to provide a barrier to particles that might otherwise cause the voice coil to rub. The German firm Rulik still offers drivers with uncommon spiders made of wood.

The cone surround can be [[rubber]] or polyester [[foam]], or a ring of corrugated, resin coated fabric; it is attached to both the outer diaphragm circumference and to the frame. These diverse surround materials, their shape and treatment can dramatically affect the acoustic output of a driver; each implementation having advantages and disadvantages. Polyester foam, for example, is lightweight and economical, though usually leaking air to some degree, but is degraded by exposure to ozone, UV light, humidity and elevated temperatures, significantly limiting useful life with adequate performance.

The wire in a voice coil is usually made of [[copper]], though [[aluminum]]—and, rarely, [[silver]]—may be used.  The advantage of aluminum is its light weight, which reduces the moving mass compared to copper.  This raises the resonant frequency of the speaker and increases its efficiency.  A disadvantage of aluminum is that it is not easily soldered, and so connections are instead often crimped together and sealed.  These connections must be made well or they may fail in an intense environment of mechanical vibration.  Voice-coil wire cross sections can be circular, rectangular, or hexagonal, giving varying amounts of wire volume coverage in the magnetic gap space. The coil is oriented co-axially inside the gap; it moves back and forth within a small circular volume (a hole, slot, or groove) in the magnetic structure. The gap establishes a concentrated magnetic field between the two poles of a permanent magnet; the outside of the gap being one pole, and the center post (called the pole piece) being the other. The pole piece and backplate are often a single piece, called the poleplate or yoke.

Modern driver magnets are almost always permanent and made of [[ceramic]], [[ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]], [[Alnico]], or, more recently, [[Rare-earth magnet|rare earth]] such as [[neodymium]] and [[Samarium-cobalt magnet|samarium cobalt]]. Electrodynamic drivers were often used in musical instrument amplifier/speaker cabinets well into the 1950s;  there were economic savings in those using tube amplifiers as the field coil could, and usually did, do double duty as a power supply choke. A trend in design — due to increases in transportation costs and a desire for smaller, lighter devices (as in many home theater multi-speaker installations) — is the use of the last instead of heavier ferrite types. Very few manufacturers still produce [[field coil loudspeaker|electrodynamic loudspeakers with electrically powered field coils]], as was common in the earliest designs;  one of the last is a French firm. When high field-strength permanent magnets became available after WWII, Alnico, an alloy of aluminum, nickel, and cobalt became popular, since it dispensed with the problems of field-coil drivers. Alnico was used almost exclusively until about 1980, despite the embarrassing problem of Alnico magnets being partially degaussed (i.e., demagnetized) by accidental 'pops' or 'clicks' caused by loose connections, especially if used with a high-power amplifier. The damage can be reversed by "recharging" the magnet, but this requires uncommon specialist equipment and knowledge.

After 1980, most (but not quite all) driver manufacturers switched from Alnico to ferrite magnets, which are made from a mix of ceramic clay and fine particles of barium or strontium ferrite. Although the energy per kilogram of these ceramic magnets is lower than Alnico, it is substantially less expensive, allowing designers to use larger yet more economical magnets to achieve a given performance.

The size and type of magnet and details of the magnetic circuit differ, depending on design goals. For instance, the shape of the pole piece affects the magnetic interaction between the voice coil and the magnetic field, and is sometimes used to modify a driver's behavior. A "shorting ring", or [[Faraday loop]], may be included as a thin copper cap fitted over the pole tip or as a heavy ring situated within the magnet-pole cavity. The benefits of this complication is reduced impedance at high frequencies, providing extended treble output, reduced harmonic distortion, and a reduction in the inductance modulation that typically accompanies large voice coil excursions. On the other hand, the copper cap requires a wider voice-coil gap, with increased magnetic reluctance; this reduces available flux, requiring a larger magnet for equivalent performance.

Driver design—including the particular way two or more drivers are combined in an enclosure to make a speaker system—is both an art, involving subjective perceptions of [[timbre]] and sound quality and a science, involving measurements and experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Davis |first=Don |author2=Carolyn Davis |title=Sound System Engineering |publisher=Focal Press |year=1997 |edition=2 |page=350 |chapter=Loudspeakers and Loudspeaker Arrays |isbn=0-240-80305-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ouyzH6vsIIwC&amp;pg=PA350 |accessdate=March 30, 2010 |language= |quote=We often give lip service to the fact that audio allows its practitioners to engage in both art and science.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fremer |first=Michael |date=April 2004 |title=Aerial Model 20T loudspeaker |journal=Stereophile |publisher=Source Interlink Media |url=http://www.stereophile.com/floorloudspeakers/404aerial/# |accessdate=March 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/06/arts/home-entertainment-speaker-design-goes-modern.html?pagewanted=1 |title=Speaker Design Goes Modern |last=Fantel |first=Hans |date=June 6, 1993 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=March 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adjusting a design to improve performance is done using a combination of magnetic, acoustic, mechanical, electrical, and material science theory, and tracked with high precision measurements and the observations of experienced listeners. A few of the issues speaker and driver designers must confront are distortion, radiation lobing, phase effects, off-axis response, and crossover artifacts. Designers can use an [[anechoic chamber]] to ensure the speaker can be measured independently of room effects, or any of several electronic techniques that, to some extent, substitute for such chambers. Some developers eschew anechoic chambers in favor of specific standardized room setups intended to simulate real-life listening conditions.

Fabrication of finished loudspeaker systems has become segmented, depending largely on price, shipping costs, and weight limitations. High-end speaker systems, which are typically heavier (and often larger) than economic shipping allows outside local regions, are usually made in their target market region and can cost $140,000 or more per pair.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nolaspeakers.com/reviews/tas/EditorsChoice2007.html The Absolute Sound, issue 175, October 2007. hp's Workshop: HP's Editor's Choice Awards.

===Driver types===
[[File:Lautsprecher 4-wege 2.jpg|thumb|A four-way, high fidelity '''loudspeaker system'''. Each of the four drivers outputs a different frequency range; the fifth aperture at the bottom is a [[bass reflex]] port.]]

Individual electrodynamic drivers provide their best performance within a limited frequency range. Multiple drivers (e.g., subwoofers, woofers, mid-range drivers, and tweeters) are generally combined into a complete loudspeaker system to provide performance beyond that constraint. The three most commonly used sound radiation systems are the cone, dome and horn type drivers.

====Full-range drivers====
{{Main article|Full-range speaker}}
A full-range driver is a speaker designed to be used alone to reproduce an audio channel without the help of other drivers, and therefore must cover the entire audio frequency range. These drivers are small, typically {{convert|3|to|8|in|cm}} in diameter to permit reasonable high frequency response, and carefully designed to give low-distortion output at low frequencies, though with reduced maximum output level. Full-range (or more accurately, wide-range) drivers are most commonly heard in public address systems, in televisions (although some models are suitable for hi-fi listening), small radios, intercoms, some [[computer speaker]]s, etc. In [[hi-fi]] speaker systems, the use of wide-range drive units can avoid undesirable interactions between multiple drivers caused by non-coincident driver location or crossover network issues. Fans of wide-range driver hi-fi speaker systems claim a coherence of sound due to the single source and a resulting lack of interference, and likely also to the lack of crossover components. Detractors typically cite wide-range drivers' limited frequency response and modest output abilities (most especially at low frequencies), together with their requirement for large, elaborate, expensive enclosures—such as transmission lines, quarter wave resonators or horns—to approach optimum performance. With the advent of neodymium drivers, low-cost quarter-wave transmission lines are made possible and are increasingly made availably commercially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kvart-bolge.com/#!concept/c1w4l|title=Kvart &amp; Bølge - Audiophile Quarter-Wave Full-Range Speakers -|author=|date=|website=Kvart &amp; Bølge - Audiophile Quarter-Wave Full-Range Speakers -|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askmen.com/top_10/celebrity/october-kickstarter-projects_1.html|title=Top 10 Entertainment|author=|date=|website=AskMen|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Full-range drivers often employ an additional cone called a ''whizzer'': a small, light cone attached to the joint between the voice coil and the primary cone. The whizzer cone extends the high-frequency response of the driver and broadens its high frequency directivity, which would otherwise be greatly narrowed due to the outer diameter cone material failing to keep up with the central voice coil at higher frequencies. The main cone in a whizzer design is manufactured so as to flex more in the outer diameter than in the center. The result is that the main cone delivers low frequencies and the whizzer cone contributes most of the higher frequencies. Since the whizzer cone is smaller than the main diaphragm, output dispersion at high frequencies is improved relative to an equivalent single larger diaphragm.

Limited-range drivers, also used alone, are typically found in computers, toys, and [[clock radio]]s. These drivers are less elaborate and less expensive than wide-range drivers, and they may be severely compromised to fit into very small mounting locations. In these applications, sound quality is a low priority. The human ear is remarkably tolerant of poor sound quality, and the distortion inherent in limited-range drivers may enhance their output at high frequencies, increasing clarity when listening to spoken word material.

====Subwoofer====
{{Main article|Subwoofer}}
A [[subwoofer]] is a woofer driver used only for the lowest-pitched part of the audio spectrum: typically below 200&amp;nbsp;Hz for consumer systems,&lt;ref name="crutchfield.com"&gt;[http://www.crutchfield.com/S-5VsEXVgtser/Learn/learningcenter/home/speakers_glossary.html Home Speakers Glossary].

Since sound in this frequency range can easily bend around corners by [[diffraction]], the speaker aperture does not have to face the audience, and subwoofers can be mounted in the bottom of the enclosure, facing the floor.  This is eased by the limitations of human hearing at low frequencies;  such sounds cannot be located in space, due to their large wavelengths compared to higher frequencies which produce differential effects in the ears due to shadowing by the head, and diffraction around it, both of which we rely upon for localization clues.

To accurately reproduce very low bass notes without unwanted resonances (typically from cabinet panels), subwoofer systems must be solidly constructed and properly braced to avoid unwanted sounds of cabinet vibrations. As a result, good subwoofers are typically quite heavy. Many subwoofer systems include integrated [[power amplifier]]s and electronic [[Infrasound|subsonic]] (sub)-filters, with additional controls relevant to low-frequency reproduction (e.g., a crossover knob and a phase switch). These variants are known as "active" or "powered" subwoofers, with the former including a power amplifier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.home-theater-designers.com/glossary.html |title=Glossary of Terms |work=Home Theater Design |publisher=ETS-eTech |page=1 |accessdate=March 3, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723231911/http://www.home-theater-designers.com/glossary.html |archivedate=July 23, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, "passive" subwoofers require external amplification.

In typical installations, subwoofers are physically separated from the rest of the speaker cabinets.  Because of propagation delay, their output may be somewhat out of phase from another subwoofer (on another channel) or slightly out of phase with the rest of the sound.  Consequently, a subwoofer's power amp often has a phase-delay adjustment (approximately 1 ms of delay is required for each additional foot of separation from the listener) which may improve performance of the system as a whole at subwoofer frequencies (and perhaps an octave or so above the crossover point).  However, the influence of room resonances (sometimes called [[standing waves]]) is typically so large that such issues are secondary in practice. Subwoofers are widely used in large concert and mid-sized venue [[sound reinforcement system]]s. Subwoofer cabinets are often built with a [[bass reflex]] port (i.e., a hole cut into the cabinet with a tube attached to it), a design feature which if properly engineered improves bass performance and increases efficiency.

====Woofer====
{{Main article|Woofer}}
A [[woofer]] is a driver that reproduces low frequencies. The driver works with the characteristics of the enclosure to produce suitable low frequencies (see [[speaker enclosure]] for some of the design choices available). Indeed, both are so closely connected that they must be considered together in use.  Only at design time do the separate properties of enclosure and woofer matter individually. Some loudspeaker systems use a woofer for the lowest frequencies, sometimes well enough that a subwoofer is not needed. Additionally, some loudspeakers use the woofer to handle middle frequencies, eliminating the mid-range driver. This can be accomplished with the selection of a tweeter that can work low enough that, combined with a woofer that responds high enough, the two drivers add coherently in the middle frequencies.

====Mid-range driver====
{{Main article|Mid-range speaker}}
A [[mid-range speaker]] is a loudspeaker driver that reproduces a band of frequencies generally between 1–6&amp;nbsp;kHz, otherwise known as the 'mid' frequencies (between the woofer and tweeter). Mid-range driver diaphragms can be made of paper or composite materials, and can be direct radiation drivers (rather like smaller woofers) or they can be [[compression driver]]s (rather like some tweeter designs). If the mid-range driver is a direct radiator, it can be mounted on the front baffle of a loudspeaker enclosure, or, if a compression driver, mounted at the throat of a horn for added output level and control of radiation pattern.

====Tweeter====
[[File:Tw15ul9.jpg|right|thumb|[[Exploded view drawing|Exploded view]] of a dome tweeter.]]
{{Main article|Tweeter}}
A [[tweeter]] is a high-frequency driver that reproduces the highest frequencies in a speaker system.  A major problem in tweeter design is achieving wide angular sound coverage (off-axis response), since high frequency sound tends to leave the speaker in narrow beams.  Soft-dome tweeters are widely found in home stereo systems, and horn-loaded compression drivers are common in professional sound reinforcement. Ribbon tweeters have gained popularity in recent years, as the output power of some designs has been increased to levels useful for professional sound reinforcement, and their output pattern is wide in the horizontal plane, a pattern that has convenient applications in concert sound.&lt;ref&gt;Nieuwendijk, Joris A.

====Coaxial drivers====
A coaxial driver is a loudspeaker driver with two or several combined concentric drivers. Coaxial drivers have been produced by many companies, such as [[Altec Lansing|Altec]], [[Tannoy]], [[Pioneer Corporation|Pioneer]], [[KEF]], SEAS, B&amp;C Speakers, BMS, [[Cabasse (company)|Cabasse]] and [[Genelec]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Genelec 8260A Technical Paper |url=http://www.genelec.com/documents/other/Genelec%208260A%20Technical%20Paper.pdf |date = September 2009|work= |publisher=Genelec |pages=3–4 |accessdate=24 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crossover===
{{Main article|Audio crossover}}
[[File:Passive Crossover.svg|thumb|right|A passive crossover.]]
[[File:Active Crossover.svg|thumb|right|Bi-amped.]]Used in [[multi-driver speaker systems]], the crossover is an assembly of filters that separate the input signal into different frequency ranges (i.e. "bands"), according to the requirements of each driver. Hence the drivers receive power only at their operating frequency (the sound frequency range they were designed for), thereby reducing distortion in the drivers and interference between them. The ideal characteristics of a crossover may include perfect out-of-band attenuation at the output of each filter, no amplitude variation ("ripple") within each passband, no phase delay between overlapping frequency bands, to name just a few.

Crossovers can be ''passive'' or ''active''. A [[Audio crossover#Passive crossovers|passive crossover]] is an electronic circuit that uses a combination of one or more [[resistor]]s, inductors, or non-polar [[capacitor]]s. These components are combined to form a filter network and are most often placed between the full frequency-range power amplifier and the loudspeaker drivers to divide the amplifier's signal into the necessary frequency bands before being delivered to the individual drivers. Passive crossover circuits need no external power beyond the audio signal itself, but have some disadvantages: they may require larger inductors and capacitors due to power handling requirements (being driven by the amplifier), limited component availability to optimize the crossover's characteristics at such power levels, etc. Unlike active crossovers which include a built-in amplifier, passive crossovers have an inherent attenuation within the passband, typically leading to a reduction in [[damping factor]] before the voice coil &lt;ref name=ActivePassive&gt;Elliott Sound Products. Rod Elliott, 2004. [http://sound.whsites.net/biamp-vs-passive.htm ''Active Vs. Passive Crossovers.''] Retrieved on June 16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Audio crossover#Active crossovers|active crossover]] is an electronic filter circuit that divides the signal into individual frequency bands ''before'' power amplification, thus requiring at least one power amplifier for each bandpass.&lt;ref name=ActivePassive/&gt; Passive filtering may also be used in this way before power amplification, but it is an uncommon solution, being less flexible than active filtering. Any technique that uses crossover filtering followed by amplification is commonly known as bi-amping, tri-amping, quad-amping, and so on, depending on the minimum number of amplifier channels.&lt;ref&gt;Boston Acoustic Society. ''The B.A.S. Speaker'', September 1978. Peter W. Mitchell: "The D-23 crossover can be used for bi-amping, tri-amping, or even quad-amping."&lt;/ref&gt;

Some loudspeaker designs use a combination of passive and active crossover filtering, such as a passive crossover between the mid- and high-frequency drivers and an active crossover between the low-frequency driver and the combined mid- and high frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;EAW [http://www.eaw.com/products/KF/kf300.html ''KF300/600 Series&amp;nbsp;— Compact three-way VAT Systems''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424065507/http://www.eaw.com/products/kf/kf300.html |date=2012-04-24 }}. Three-way loudspeakers switchable between bi-amped and other modes. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yorkville [http://www.yorkville.com/products.asp?cat=38&amp;id=268&amp;type=29 ''U215 Speaker&amp;nbsp;– 1600w 2x15 / 3x5 inch / 1 inch''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322012059/http://www.yorkville.com/products.asp?cat=38&amp;id=268&amp;type=29 |date=2012-03-22 }}. Three-way loudspeaker switchable between bi-amped and fully passive modes. &lt;/ref&gt;

Passive crossovers are commonly installed inside speaker boxes and are by far the most usual type of crossover for home and low-power use. In car audio systems, passive crossovers may be in a separate box, necessary to accommodate the size of the components used. Passive crossovers may be simple for low-order filtering, or complex to allow steep slopes such as 18 or 24&amp;nbsp;dB per octave. Passive crossovers can also be designed to compensate for undesired characteristics of driver, horn, or enclosure resonances,&lt;ref name=PassiveDesign&gt;Elliott Sound Products. Rod Elliott, 2004. [http://sound.whsites.net/lr-passive.htm ''Design of Passive Crossovers.''] Retrieved on June 16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and can be tricky to implement, due to component interaction. Passive crossovers, like the driver units that they feed, have power handling limits, have insertion losses (10% is often claimed), and change the load seen by the amplifier. The changes are matters of concern for many in the hi-fi world.&lt;ref name=PassiveDesign/&gt; When high output levels are required, active crossovers may be preferable. Active crossovers may be simple circuits that emulate the response of a passive network, or may be more complex, allowing extensive audio adjustments. Some active crossovers, usually digital loudspeaker management systems, may include electronics and controls for precise alignment of phase and time between frequency bands, equalization, [[dynamic range compression]] and limiting) control.&lt;ref name=ActivePassive/&gt;

===Enclosures===
{{Main article|Loudspeaker enclosure}}
[[File:4-Wege Lautsprecher.jpg|thumb|right|An unusual three-way speaker system. The cabinet is narrow to raise the frequency where a diffraction effect called the "baffle step" occurs.]]
Most loudspeaker systems consist of drivers mounted in an [[loudspeaker enclosure|enclosure]], or cabinet. The role of the enclosure is to prevent sound waves emanating from the back of a driver from interfering destructively with those from the front.  The sound waves emitted from the back are 180° [[out of phase]] with those emitted forward, so without an enclosure they  typically cause cancellations which significantly degrade the level and quality of sound at low frequencies.

The simplest driver mount is a flat panel (i.e., baffle) with the drivers mounted in holes in it. However, in this approach, sound frequencies with a wavelength longer than the baffle dimensions are canceled out, because the antiphase radiation from the rear of the cone interferes with the radiation from the front. With an infinitely large panel, this interference could be entirely prevented. A sufficiently large sealed box can approach this behavior.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jun04/articles/qa0604-6.htm Q. Sound On Sound, June 2004. ''What's the difference between ported and un-ported monitors?'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.record-producer.com/learn.cfm?a=97 Record Producer. ''Infinite baffle''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102014320/http://www.record-producer.com/learn.cfm?a=97 |date=January 2, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since panels of infinite dimensions are impossible, most enclosures function by containing the rear radiation from the moving diaphragm. A sealed enclosure prevents transmission of the sound emitted from the rear of the loudspeaker by confining the sound in a rigid and airtight box. Techniques used to reduce transmission of sound through the walls of the cabinet include thicker cabinet walls, lossy wall material, internal bracing, curved cabinet walls—or more rarely, [[visco-elastic]] materials (e.g., mineral-loaded [[bitumen]]) or thin [[lead]] sheeting applied to the interior enclosure walls.

However, a rigid enclosure reflects sound internally, which can then be transmitted back through the loudspeaker diaphragm—again resulting in degradation of sound quality. This can be reduced by internal absorption using absorptive materials (often called "damping"), such as [[glass wool]], wool, or synthetic fiber batting, within the enclosure. The internal shape of the enclosure can also be designed to reduce this by reflecting sounds away from the loudspeaker diaphragm, where they may then be absorbed.

Other enclosure types alter the rear sound radiation so it can add constructively to the output from the front of the cone. Designs that do this (including ''[[bass reflex]]'', ''passive radiator'', ''transmission line'', etc.) are often used to extend the effective low-frequency response and increase low-frequency output of the driver.

To make the transition between drivers as seamless as possible, system designers have attempted to time-align (or phase adjust) the drivers by moving one or more driver mounting locations forward or back so that the acoustic center of each driver is in the same vertical plane. This may also involve tilting the face speaker back, providing a separate enclosure mounting for each driver, or (less commonly) using electronic techniques to achieve the same effect. These attempts have resulted in some unusual cabinet designs.

The speaker mounting scheme (including cabinets) can also cause [[diffraction]], resulting in peaks and dips in the frequency response. The problem is usually greatest at higher frequencies, where wavelengths are similar to, or smaller than, cabinet dimensions. The effect can be minimized by rounding the front edges of the cabinet, curving the cabinet itself, using a smaller or narrower enclosure, choosing a strategic driver arrangement, using absorptive material around a driver, or some combination of these and other schemes.

====Horn loudspeakers====
[[File:3-way horn speaker.png|thumb|A three-way loudspeaker that uses horns in front of each of the three drivers: a shallow horn for the tweeter, a long, straight horn for mid frequencies and a folded horn for the woofer]]
{{Main article|Horn loudspeaker}}
[[Horn loudspeaker]]s are the oldest form of loudspeaker system. The use of [[Horn (acoustic)|horns]] as voice-amplifying [[megaphone]]s dates at least to the 17th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Trumpet, Speaking and Hearing}}&lt;/ref&gt; and horns were used in mechanical [[Phonograph|gramophones]] as early as 1857. Horn loudspeakers use a shaped waveguide in front of or behind the driver to increase the directivity of the loudspeaker and to transform a small diameter, high pressure condition at the driver cone surface to a large diameter, low pressure condition at the mouth of the horn. This improves the acoustic—electro/mechanical impedance match between the driver and ambient air, increasing efficiency, and focusing the sound over a narrower area.

The size of the throat, mouth, the length of the horn, as well as the area expansion rate along it must be carefully chosen to match the drive to properly provide this transforming function over a range of frequencies (every horn performs poorly outside its acoustic limits, at both high and low frequencies). The length and cross-sectional mouth area required to create a bass or sub-bass horn require a horn many feet long. 'Folded' horns can reduce the total size, but compel designers to make compromises and accept increased complication such as cost and construction. Some horn designs not only fold the low frequency horn, but use the walls in a room corner as an extension of the horn mouth. In the late 1940s, horns whose mouths took up much of a room wall were not unknown amongst hi-fi fans. Room sized installations became much less acceptable when two or more were required.

A horn loaded speaker can have a sensitivity as high as 110&amp;nbsp;dB at 2.83 volts (1 watt at 8 ohms) at 1 meter. This is a hundredfold increase in output compared to a speaker rated at 90&amp;nbsp;dB sensitivity, and is invaluable in applications where high sound levels are required or amplifier power is limited.

===Wiring connections===
[[File:Banana plugs speaker.jpg|thumb|right|[[Binding post|Two-way binding posts]] on a loudspeaker, connected using [[Banana connector|banana plugs]].]]
[[File:bi-amp capable.jpg|thumb|right|A 4-ohm loudspeaker with two pairs of binding posts capable of accepting bi-wiring after the removal of two metal straps.]]

Most home [[hi-fi]] loudspeakers use two wiring points to connect to the source of the signal (for example, to the audio amplifier or [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]]). To accept the wire connection, the loudspeaker enclosure may have [[binding post]]s, spring clips, or a panel-mount jack. If the wires for a pair of speakers are not connected with respect to the proper [[electrical polarity]] (the + and − connections on the speaker and amplifier should be connected + to + and − to −;  speaker cable is almost always marked so that one conductor of a pair can be distinguished from the other, even if it has run under or behind things in its run from amplifier to speaker location), the loudspeakers are said to be "out of phase" or more properly "out of polarity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d7ft6F8ZUdcC&amp;pg=PA186|title=The Sound Reinforcement Handbook|first1=Gary|last1=Davis|first2=Gary D.|last2=Davis|date=14 April 1989|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|accessdate=14 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L38MrvScG3gC&amp;pg=PA298|title=The Audio Dictionary: Third Edition, Revised and Expanded|first1=Glenn D.|last1=White|first2=Gary J.|last2=Louie|date=1 October 2011|publisher=University of Washington Press|accessdate=14 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given identical signals, motion in one cone is in the opposite direction of the other. This typically causes monophonic material in a stereo recording to be canceled out, reduced in level, and made more difficult to localize, all due to destructive interference of the sound waves. The cancellation effect is most noticeable at frequencies where the loudspeakers are separated by a quarter wavelength or less; low frequencies are affected the most. This type of miswiring error does not damage speakers, but is not optimal for listening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lesWAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA57|title=Audio in Media|first=Stanley R.|last=Alten|date=22 January 2013|publisher=Cengage Learning|accessdate=14 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K1t0GxyvVbMC&amp;pg=PA130|title=Guide to Sound Systems for Worship|first=Jon F.|last=Eiche|date=14 April 1990|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|accessdate=14 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[sound reinforcement system]], [[PA system]] and [[instrument amplifier]] speaker enclosures, cables and some type of jack or connector are typically used. Lower- and mid-priced sound system and instrument speaker cabinets often use 1/4" speaker cable jacks. Higher-priced and higher powered sound system cabinets and instrument speaker cabinets often use [[Speakon]] connectors. Speakon connectors are considered to be safer for high wattage amplifiers, because the connector is designed so that human users cannot touch the connectors.

===Wireless speakers===
{{main article|Wireless speaker}}
[[File:HP Roar Wireless Speaker.jpg|thumbnail|right|HP Roar Wireless Speaker]]
[[Wireless speakers]] are very similar to traditional (wired) loudspeakers, but they receive audio signals using radio frequency (RF) waves rather than over audio cables. There is normally an amplifier integrated in the speaker's cabinet because the RF waves alone are not enough to drive the speaker. This integration of amplifier and loudspeaker is known as an [[active loudspeaker]]. Manufacturers of these loudspeakers design them to be as lightweight as possible while producing the maximum amount of audio output efficiency.

Wireless speakers still need power, so require a nearby AC power outlet, or possibly batteries. Only the wire to the amplifier is eliminated.

==Specifications==
[[File:Eltax Silverstone 200 loudspeaker label.jpg|thumb|Specifications label on a loudspeaker.]]
Speaker specifications generally include:
* '''Speaker or driver type''' (individual units only)&amp;nbsp;– [[Full-range]], woofer, tweeter, or [[Mid-range speaker|mid-range]].
* '''Size''' of individual drivers. For cone drivers, the quoted size is generally the outside diameter of the basket.&lt;ref&gt;EIA RS-278-B "Mounting Dimensions for Loudspeakers"&lt;/ref&gt; However, it may less commonly also be the diameter of the cone surround, measured apex to apex, or the distance from the center of one mounting hole to its opposite. Voice-coil diameter may also be specified. If the loudspeaker has a compression horn driver, the diameter of the horn throat may be given.
* '''Rated Power'''&amp;nbsp;– Nominal (or even continuous) [[Electrical power|power]], and peak (or maximum short-term) power a loudspeaker can handle (i.e., maximum input power before destroying the loudspeaker; it is never the sound output the loudspeaker produces). A driver may be damaged at much less than its rated power if driven past its mechanical limits at lower frequencies.&lt;ref name=SpeakerDamage&gt;Elliott Sound Products. Rod Elliott, 2006. [http://sound.whsites.net/bi-amp-p1.htm ''Speaker Damage''] Retrieved on June 16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Tweeters can also be damaged by amplifier clipping (amplifier circuits produce large amounts of energy at high frequencies in such cases) or by music or sine wave input at high frequencies. Each of these situations might pass more energy to a tweeter than it can survive without damage.&lt;ref name=WhyTweetersBlow&gt;Elliott Sound Products. Rod Elliott, 2006. [http://sound.whsites.net/tweeters.htm ''Why Do Tweeters Blow When Amplifiers Distort?''] Retrieved on June 16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In some jurisdictions, power handling has a legal meaning allowing comparisons between loudspeakers under consideration. Elsewhere, the variety of meanings for power handling capacity can be quite confusing.
* '''[[Electrical impedance|Impedance]]'''&amp;nbsp;– typically 4&amp;nbsp;Ω (ohms), 8&amp;nbsp;Ω, etc.&lt;ref&gt;EIA RS-299 "Loudspeakers, Dynamic; Magnetic Structures and Impedance"&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Baffle or enclosure type''' (enclosed systems only)&amp;nbsp;– Sealed, bass reflex, etc.
* '''Number of drivers''' (complete speaker systems only)&amp;nbsp;– two-way, three-way, etc.
* '''Class''' of loudspeaker:&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, Bob. ''Sound Systems: Design and Optimization: Modern Techniques and Tools for Sound System Design and Alignment''. CRC Press, 2016. p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;
**Class 1: maximum SPL 110-119 dB, the type of loudspeaker used for reproducing a person speaking in a small space or for [[background music]]; mainly used as fill speakers for Class 2 or Class 3 speakers; typically small 4" or 5" woofers and dome tweeters
**Class 2: maximum SPL 120-129 dB, the type of medium power-capable loudspeaker used for reinforcement in small to medium spaces or as fill speakers for Class 3 or Class 4 speakers; typically 5" to 8" woofers and dome tweeters
**Class 3: maximum SPL 130-139 dB, high power-capable loudspeakers used in main systems in small to medium spaces; also used as fill speakers for class 4 speakers; typically 6.5" to 12" woofers and 2" or 3" compression drivers for high frequencies
**Class 4: maximum SPL 140 dB and higher, very high power-capable loudspeakers used as mains in medium to large spaces (or for fill speakers for these medium to large spaces); 10" to 15" woofers and 3" compression drivers

and optionally:
* '''Crossover frequency(ies)''' (multi-driver systems only)&amp;nbsp;– The nominal frequency boundaries of the division between drivers.
* '''[[Frequency response]]'''&amp;nbsp;– The measured, or specified, output over a specified range of frequencies for a constant input level varied across those frequencies. It sometimes includes a variance limit, such as within "± 2.5&amp;nbsp;dB."
* '''[[Thiele/Small|Thiele/Small parameters]]''' (individual drivers only)&amp;nbsp;– these include the driver's ''F''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; (resonance frequency), ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;ts&lt;/sub&gt; (a driver's ''Q''; more or less, its [[damping factor]] at resonant frequency), ''V''&lt;sub&gt;as&lt;/sub&gt; (the equivalent air compliance volume of the driver), etc.
* '''Sensitivity'''&amp;nbsp;– The sound pressure level produced by a loudspeaker in a non-reverberant environment, often specified in dB and measured at 1 meter with an input of 1 watt (2.83 rms volts into 8&amp;nbsp;Ω), typically at one or more specified frequencies. Manufacturers often use this rating in marketing material.
* '''Maximum sound pressure level'''&amp;nbsp;– The highest output the loudspeaker can manage, short of damage or not exceeding a particular distortion level. Manufacturers often use this rating in marketing material—commonly without reference to frequency range or distortion level.

===Electrical characteristics of dynamic loudspeakers===
{{Main article|Electrical characteristics of dynamic loudspeakers}}

The load that a driver presents to an amplifier consists of a complex [[electrical impedance]]—a combination of resistance and both [[Capacitance|capacitive]] and [[Inductance|inductive]] [[Electrical reactance|reactance]], which combines properties of the driver, its mechanical motion, the effects of crossover components (if any are in the signal path between amplifier and driver), and the effects of air loading on the driver as modified by the enclosure and its environment. Most amplifiers' output specifications are given at a specific power into an ideal [[resistive]] load; however, a loudspeaker does not have a constant impedance across its frequency range. Instead, the voice coil is inductive, the driver has mechanical resonances, the enclosure changes the driver's electrical and mechanical characteristics, and a passive crossover between the drivers and the amplifier contributes its own variations. The result is a load impedance that varies widely with frequency, and usually a varying phase relationship between voltage and current as well, also changing with frequency. Some amplifiers can cope with the variation better than others can.

To make sound, a loudspeaker is driven by modulated electric current (produced by an [[audio power amplifier|amplifier]]) that pass through a "speaker coil"  which then (through [[Electrical inductance|inductance]]) creates a magnetic field around the coil, creating a [[magnetic field]]. The electric current variations that pass through the speaker are thus converted to a varying magnetic field, whose interaction with the driver's magnetic field moves the speaker diaphragm, which thus forces the driver to produce air motion that is similar to the original signal from the amplifier.

===Electromechanical measurements===
Examples of typical [[Loudspeaker measurement|measurements]] are: amplitude and phase characteristics vs. frequency; impulse response under one or more conditions (e.g., square waves, sine wave bursts, etc.); directivity vs. frequency (e.g., horizontally, vertically, spherically, etc.); [[harmonic distortion|harmonic]] and [[intermodulation distortion]] vs. [[Sound pressure|sound pressure level]] (SPL) output, using any of several test signals; stored energy (i.e., ringing) at various frequencies; impedance vs. frequency; and small-signal vs. large-signal performance. Most of these measurements require sophisticated and often expensive equipment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nti-audio.com/en/solutions/testing-devices/speaker.aspx|title=Equipment used for speaker, driver &amp; cabinet testing|first=[[NTi Audio|NTi]]|last=Audio|website=www.nti-audio.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; to perform, and also good judgment by the operator, but the raw sound pressure level output is rather easier to report and so is often the only specified value—sometimes in misleadingly exact terms. The sound pressure level (SPL) a loudspeaker produces is measured in [[decibel]]s ([[DBSPL|dB&lt;sub&gt;spl&lt;/sub&gt;]]).

===Efficiency vs. sensitivity===
Loudspeaker efficiency is defined as the [[sound power]] output divided by the electrical power input. Most loudspeakers are inefficient transducers; only about 1% of the electrical energy sent by an amplifier to a typical home loudspeaker is converted to acoustic energy. The remainder is converted to heat, mostly in the voice coil and magnet assembly. The main reason for this is the difficulty of achieving proper [[impedance matching]] between the [[acoustic impedance]] of the drive unit and the air it radiates into. (At low frequencies, improving this match is the main purpose of speaker enclosure designs). The efficiency of loudspeaker drivers varies with frequency as well. For instance, the output of a woofer driver decreases as the input frequency decreases because of the increasingly poor match between air and the driver.

Driver ratings based on the SPL for a given input are called sensitivity ratings and are notionally similar to efficiency. [[Sensitivity (electronics)|Sensitivity]] is usually defined as so many decibels at 1&amp;nbsp;W electrical input, measured at 1 meter (except for [[headphones]]), often at a single frequency. The voltage used is often 2.83&amp;nbsp;V&lt;sub&gt;RMS&lt;/sub&gt;, which is 1&amp;nbsp;watt into an 8&amp;nbsp;Ω (nominal) speaker impedance (approximately true for many speaker systems). Measurements taken with this reference are quoted as dB with 2.83&amp;nbsp;V @ 1&amp;nbsp;m.

The sound pressure output is measured at (or mathematically scaled to be equivalent to a measurement taken at) one meter from the loudspeaker and on-axis (directly in front of it), under the condition that the loudspeaker is radiating into an infinitely large space and mounted on an [[infinite baffle]]. Clearly then, sensitivity does not correlate precisely with efficiency, as it also depends on the directivity of the driver being tested and the acoustic environment in front of the actual loudspeaker. For example, a cheerleader's horn produces more sound output in the direction it is pointed by concentrating sound waves from the cheerleader in one direction, thus "focusing" them. The horn also improves impedance matching between the voice and the air, which produces more acoustic power for a given speaker power. In some cases, improved impedance matching (via careful enclosure design) lets the speaker produce more acoustic power.

* Typical home loudspeakers have sensitivities of about 85 to 95&amp;nbsp;dB for 1&amp;nbsp;W @ 1&amp;nbsp;m—an efficiency of 0.5–4%.
* Sound reinforcement and public address loudspeakers have sensitivities of perhaps 95 to 102&amp;nbsp;dB for 1&amp;nbsp;W @ 1&amp;nbsp;m—an efficiency of 4–10%.
* Rock concert, stadium PA, marine hailing, etc. speakers generally have higher sensitivities of 103 to 110&amp;nbsp;dB for 1&amp;nbsp;W @ 1&amp;nbsp;m—an efficiency of 10–20%.

A driver with a higher maximum power rating cannot necessarily be driven to louder levels than a lower-rated one, since sensitivity and power handling are largely independent properties. In the examples that follow, assume (for simplicity) that the drivers being compared have the same electrical impedance, are operated at the same frequency within both driver's respective pass bands, and that power compression and distortion are low. For the first example, a speaker 3&amp;nbsp;dB more sensitive than another produces double the sound power (is 3&amp;nbsp;dB louder) for the same power input. Thus, a 100&amp;nbsp;W driver ("A") rated at 92&amp;nbsp;dB for 1&amp;nbsp;W @ 1&amp;nbsp;m sensitivity puts out twice as much acoustic power as a 200&amp;nbsp;W driver ("B") rated at 89&amp;nbsp;dB for 1&amp;nbsp;W @ 1&amp;nbsp;m when both are driven with 100&amp;nbsp;W of input power. In this particular example, when driven at 100&amp;nbsp;W, speaker A produces the same SPL, or [[loudness]] as speaker B would produce with 200&amp;nbsp;W input. Thus, a 3&amp;nbsp;dB increase in sensitivity of the speaker means that it needs half the amplifier power to achieve a given SPL. This translates into a smaller, less complex power amplifier—and often, to reduced overall system cost.

The interaction of a loudspeaker system with its environment is complex and is largely out of the loudspeaker designer's control. Most listening rooms present a more or less reflective environment, depending on size, shape, volume, and furnishings. This means the sound reaching a listener's ears consists not only of sound directly from the speaker system, but also the same sound delayed by traveling to and from (and being modified by) one or more surfaces. These reflected sound waves, when added to the direct sound, cause cancellation and addition at assorted frequencies (e.g., from [[resonant room modes]]), thus changing the timbre and character of the sound at the listener's ears. The human brain is very sensitive to small variations, including some of these, and this is part of the reason why a loudspeaker system sounds different at different listening positions or in different rooms.

A significant factor in the sound of a loudspeaker system is the amount of absorption and diffusion present in the environment. Clapping one's hands in a typical empty room, without draperies or carpet, produces a zippy, fluttery echo due both to a lack of absorption and to reverberation (that is, repeated echoes) from flat reflective walls, floor, and ceiling. The addition of hard surfaced furniture, wall hangings, shelving and even baroque plaster ceiling decoration changes the echoes, primarily because of diffusion caused by reflective objects with shapes and surfaces having sizes on the order of the sound wavelengths. This somewhat breaks up the simple reflections otherwise caused by bare flat surfaces, and spreads the reflected energy of an incident wave over a larger angle on reflection.

===Placement===
In a typical rectangular listening room, the hard, parallel surfaces of the walls, floor and ceiling cause primary [[acoustic resonance]] nodes in each of the three dimensions: left-right, up-down and forward-backward.&lt;ref&gt;"Acoustics", Leo Beranek, chapter 10, McGraw Hill Books, 1954&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, there are more complex resonance modes involving three, four, five and even all six boundary surfaces combining to create [[standing wave]]s. Low frequencies excite these modes the most, since long wavelengths are not much affected by furniture compositions or placement. The mode spacing is critical, especially in small and medium size rooms like recording studios, home theaters and broadcast studios. The proximity of the loudspeakers to room boundaries affects how strongly the resonances are excited as well as affecting the relative strength at each frequency. The location of the listener is critical, too, as a position near a boundary can have a great effect on the perceived balance of frequencies. This is because standing wave patterns are most easily heard in these locations and at lower frequencies, below the [[Schroeder frequency]]&amp;nbsp;– typically around 200–300&amp;nbsp;Hz, depending on room size.

===Directivity===
Acousticians, in studying the radiation of sound sources have developed some concepts important to understanding how loudspeakers are perceived. The simplest possible radiating source is a point source, sometimes called a simple source. An ideal point source is an infinitesimally small point radiating sound. It may be easier to imagine a tiny pulsating sphere, uniformly increasing and decreasing in diameter, sending out sound waves in all directions equally, independent of frequency.

Any object radiating sound, including a loudspeaker system, can be thought of as being composed of combinations of such simple point sources. The radiation pattern of a combination of point sources is not the same as for a single source, but depends on the distance and orientation between the sources, the position relative to them from which the listener hears the combination, and the frequency of the sound involved. Using geometry and calculus, some simple combinations of sources are easily solved; others are not.

One simple combination is two simple sources separated by a distance and vibrating out of phase, one miniature sphere expanding while the other is contracting. The pair is known as a doublet, or dipole, and the radiation of this combination is similar to that of a very small dynamic loudspeaker operating without a baffle. The directivity of a dipole is a figure 8 shape with maximum output along a vector that connects the two sources and minimums to the sides when the observing point is equidistant from the two sources, where the sum of the positive and negative waves cancel each other. While most drivers are dipoles, depending on the enclosure to which they are attached, they may radiate as monopoles, dipoles (or bipoles). If mounted on a finite baffle, and these out of phase waves are allowed to interact, dipole peaks and nulls in the frequency response result. When the rear radiation is absorbed or trapped in a box, the diaphragm becomes a monopole radiator. Bipolar speakers, made by mounting in-phase monopoles (both moving out of or into the box in unison) on opposite sides of a box, are a method of approaching omnidirectional radiation patterns.

In real life, individual drivers are complex 3D shapes such as cones and domes, and they are placed on a baffle for various reasons. A mathematical expression for the directivity of a complex shape, based on modeling combinations of point sources, is usually not possible, but in the far field, the directivity of a loudspeaker with a circular diaphragm is close to that of a flat circular piston, so it can be used as an illustrative simplification for discussion. As a simple example of the mathematical physics involved, consider the following:
the formula for far field directivity of a flat circular piston in an infinite baffle is &lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt;p(\theta) = \frac{p_0 J_1(k_a \sin \theta)}{k_a \sin \theta}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
where &lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt;k_a=\frac{2\pi a}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt;p_0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt; is the pressure on axis, &lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt; is the piston radius, &lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt; is the wavelength (i.e. &lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt;\lambda = \frac{c}{f} = \frac{\text{speed of sound}}{\text{frequency}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt;) &lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt; is the angle off axis and &lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt;J_1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt; is the [[Bessel function]] of the first kind.

A planar source radiates sound uniformly for low frequencies' wavelengths longer than the dimensions of the planar source, and as frequency increases, the sound from such a source focuses into an increasingly narrower angle. The smaller the driver, the higher the frequency where this narrowing of directivity occurs. Even if the diaphragm is not perfectly circular, this effect occurs such that larger sources are more directive. Several loudspeaker designs approximate this behavior. Most are electrostatic or planar magnetic designs.

Various manufacturers use different driver mounting arrangements to create a specific type of sound field in the space for which they are designed. The resulting radiation patterns may be intended to more closely simulate the way sound is produced by real instruments, or simply create a controlled energy distribution from the input signal (some using this approach are called [[studio monitor|monitors]], as they are useful in checking the signal just recorded in a studio). An example of the first is a room corner system with many small drivers on the surface of a 1/8 sphere. A system design of this type was patented and produced commercially by Professor Amar Bose—the 2201. Later [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] models have deliberately emphasized production of both direct and reflected sound by the loudspeaker itself, regardless of its environment. The designs are controversial in [[Bose Corporation#Criticisms|high fidelity circles]], but have proven commercially successful. Several other manufacturers' designs follow similar principles.

Directivity is an important issue because it affects the frequency balance of sound a listener hears, and also the interaction of the speaker system with the room and its contents. A very directive (sometimes termed 'beamy') speaker (i.e., on an axis perpendicular to the speaker face) may result in a reverberant field lacking in high frequencies, giving the impression the speaker is deficient in treble even though it measures well on axis (e.g., "flat" across the entire frequency range). Speakers with very wide, or rapidly increasing directivity at high frequencies, can give the impression that there is too much treble (if the listener is on axis) or too little (if the listener is off axis). This is part of the reason why on-axis frequency response measurement is not a complete characterization of the sound of a given loudspeaker.

==Other speaker designs==

While dynamic cone speakers remain the most popular choice, many other speaker technologies exist.

===With a diaphragm===

====Moving-iron loudspeakers====
{{main article|Moving iron speaker}}
[[image:Moving-iron_cone_speaker_1929.png|thumb|right|200px|Moving iron speaker]]
The moving iron speaker was the first type of speaker that was invented. Unlike the newer dynamic (moving coil) design, a moving-iron speaker uses a stationary coil to vibrate a magnetized piece of metal (called the iron, reed, or armature).  The metal is either attached to the diaphragm or is the diaphragm itself.  This design was the original loudspeaker design, dating back to the early telephone.  Moving iron drivers are inefficient and can only produce a small band of sound.  They require large magnets and coils to increase force.&lt;ref name="moving iron"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Moving-Iron Speaker|url=http://www.vias.org/crowhurstba/crowhurst_basic_audio_vol1_042.html|website=vias.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Balanced armature drivers (a type of moving iron driver) use an armature that moves like a see-saw or diving board.  Since they are not damped, they are highly efficient, but they also produce strong resonances.  They are still used today for high end [[earphones]] and hearing aids, where small size and high efficiency are important.&lt;ref name="balanced armature"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hertsens|first1=Tyll|title=How Balanced Armature Receivers/Drivers Work|url=http://www.innerfidelity.com/content/how-balanced-armature-receiversdrivers-work#IboPCt5E0YtmLTAL.97|website=innerfidelity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Piezoelectric speakers====
{{main article|Piezoelectric speaker}}
{{See also|Piezo tweeter}}
[[File:2007-07-24 Piezoelectric buzzer.jpg|thumb|A piezoelectric buzzer. The white ceramic piezoelectric material can be seen fixed to a metal diaphragm.]]
Piezoelectric speakers are frequently used as beepers in [[watch]]es and other electronic devices, and are sometimes used as tweeters in less-expensive speaker systems, such as computer speakers and portable radios. Piezoelectric speakers have several advantages over conventional loudspeakers: they are resistant to overloads that would normally destroy most high frequency drivers, and they can be used without a crossover due to their electrical properties. There are also disadvantages: some amplifiers can oscillate when driving capacitive loads like most piezoelectrics, which results in distortion or damage to the amplifier. Additionally, their frequency response, in most cases, is inferior to that of other technologies. This is why they are generally used in single frequency (beeper) or non-critical applications.

Piezoelectric speakers can have extended high frequency output, and this is useful in some specialized circumstances; for instance, [[sonar]] applications in which piezoelectric variants are used as both output devices (generating underwater sound) and as input devices (acting as the sensing components of underwater microphones). They have advantages in these applications, not the least of which is simple and solid state construction that resists seawater better than a ribbon or cone based device would.

In 2013, [[Kyocera]] introduced piezoelectric ultra-thin medium-size film speakers with only 1 millimeter of thickness and 7 grams of weight for their 55" [[OLED]] televisions and they hope the speakers will also be used in PCs and tablets. Besides medium-size, there are also large and small sizes which can all produce relatively the same quality of sound and volume within 180 degrees. The highly responsive speaker material provides better clarity than traditional TV speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/08/29/kyocera-piezoelectric-film-speaker/#continued |title=Kyocera piezoelectric film speaker delivers 180-degree sound to thin TVs and tablets (update: live photos) |date=August 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Magnetostatic loudspeakers====
{{Main article|Magnetostatic loudspeaker}}
[[File:Magnepan MG1.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Magnetostatic loudspeaker]]
Instead of a voice coil driving a speaker cone, a magnetostatic speaker uses an array of metal strips bonded to a large film membrane. The magnetic field produced by signal current flowing through the strips interacts with the field of permanent bar magnets mounted behind them. The force produced moves the membrane and so the air in front of it.  Typically, these designs are less efficient than conventional moving-coil speakers.

====Magnetostrictive speakers====
Magnetostrictive transducers, based on [[magnetostriction]], have been predominantly used as [[sonar]] ultrasonic sound wave radiators, but their use has spread also to audio speaker systems. Magnetostrictive speaker drivers have some special advantages: they can provide greater force (with smaller excursions) than other technologies; low excursion can avoid distortions from large excursion as in other designs; the magnetizing coil is stationary and therefore more easily cooled; they are robust because delicate suspensions and voice coils are not required. Magnetostrictive speaker modules have been produced by Fostex&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Takeyoshi |last=Yamada |title=Fostex Prototypes Tabletop Vibration Speaker System Using Super Magnetostrictor |url=http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/english/NEWS_EN/20051117/110823/ |publisher=Tech-On! |location= |date=November 2005 |accessdate=2009-10-05 |quote=The cone-shaped speaker system is 95 mm in diameter and 90 mm high.

====Electrostatic loudspeakers====
{{Main article|Electrostatic loudspeaker}}
[[Image:Es spk.gif|frame|right|170px|Schematic showing an electrostatic speaker's construction and its connections. The thickness of the diaphragm and grids has been exaggerated for the purpose of illustration.]]
[[Electrostatic loudspeaker]]s use a high voltage electric field (rather than a magnetic field) to drive a thin statically charged membrane. Because they are driven over the entire membrane surface rather than from a small voice coil, they ordinarily provide a more linear and lower-distortion motion than dynamic drivers. They also have a relatively narrow dispersion pattern that can make for precise sound-field positioning.  However, their optimum listening area is small and they are not very efficient speakers.  They have the disadvantage that the diaphragm excursion is severely limited because of practical construction limitations—the further apart the stators are positioned, the higher the voltage must be to achieve acceptable efficiency.  This increases the tendency for electrical arcs as well as increasing the speaker's attraction of dust particles. Arcing remains a potential problem with current technologies, especially when the panels are allowed to collect dust or dirt and are driven with high signal levels.

Electrostatics are inherently dipole radiators and due to the thin flexible membrane are less suited for use in enclosures to reduce low frequency cancellation as with common cone drivers. Due to this and the low excursion capability, full range electrostatic loudspeakers are large by nature, and the bass [[roll-off|rolls off]] at a frequency corresponding to a quarter wavelength of the narrowest panel dimension. To reduce the size of commercial products, they are sometimes used as a high frequency driver in combination with a conventional dynamic driver that handles the bass frequencies effectively.

Electrostatics are usually driven through a step-up transformer that multiplies the voltage swings produced by the power amplifier.  This transformer also multiplies the capacitive load that is inherent in electrostatic transducers, which means the effective impedance presented to the power amplifiers varies widely by frequency.  A speaker that is nominally 8 ohms may actually present a load of 1 ohm at higher frequencies, which is challenging to some amplifier designs.

====Ribbon and planar magnetic loudspeakers====
A '''ribbon speaker''' consists of a thin metal-film ribbon suspended in a magnetic field. The electrical signal is applied to the ribbon, which moves with it to create the sound. The advantage of a ribbon driver is that the ribbon has very little [[mass]]; thus, it can accelerate very quickly, yielding very good high-frequency response. Ribbon loudspeakers are often very fragile—some can be torn by a strong gust of air. Most ribbon tweeters emit sound in a dipole pattern. A few have backings that limit the dipole radiation pattern. Above and below the ends of the more or less rectangular ribbon, there is less audible output due to phase cancellation, but the precise amount of directivity depends on ribbon length. Ribbon designs generally require exceptionally powerful magnets, which makes them costly to manufacture. Ribbons have a very low resistance that most amplifiers cannot drive directly. As a result, a step down transformer is typically used to increase the current through the ribbon. The amplifier "sees" a load that is the ribbon's resistance times the transformer turns ratio squared. The transformer must be carefully designed so that its frequency response and parasitic losses do not degrade the sound, further increasing cost and complication relative to conventional designs.

Planar magnetic speakers (having printed or embedded conductors on a flat diaphragm) are sometimes described as ribbons, but are not truly ribbon speakers. The term planar is generally reserved for speakers with roughly rectangular flat surfaces that radiate in a bipolar (i.e., front and back) manner. Planar magnetic speakers consist of a flexible membrane with a voice coil printed or mounted on it. The [[Laplace force|current flowing through the coil interacts with the magnetic field]] of carefully placed magnets on either side of the diaphragm, causing the membrane to vibrate more or less uniformly and without much bending or wrinkling. The driving force covers a large percentage of the membrane surface and reduces resonance problems inherent in coil-driven flat diaphragms.

====Bending wave loudspeakers====
Bending wave transducers use a diaphragm that is intentionally flexible. The rigidity of the material increases from the center to the outside. Short wavelengths radiate primarily from the inner area, while longer waves reach the edge of the speaker. To prevent reflections from the outside back into the center, long waves are absorbed by a surrounding damper. Such transducers can cover a wide frequency range (80&amp;nbsp;Hz to 35,000&amp;nbsp;Hz) and have been promoted as being close to an ideal point sound source.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stereophile.com/floorloudspeakers/687ohm/ Stereophile magazine. ''Ohm Walsh 5 loudspeaker'' (review by Dick Olsher, June 1987)]&lt;/ref&gt; This uncommon approach is being taken by only a very few manufacturers, in very different arrangements.

The Ohm Walsh loudspeakers use a unique driver designed by [[Lincoln Walsh]], who had been a radar development engineer in WWII. He became interested in audio equipment design and his last project was a unique, one-way speaker using a single driver. The cone faced down into a sealed, airtight enclosure. Rather than move back-and-forth as conventional speakers do, the cone rippled and created sound in a manner known in RF electronics as a "transmission line". The new speaker created a cylindrical sound field. Lincoln Walsh died before his speaker was released to the public. The Ohm Acoustics firm has produced several loudspeaker models using the Walsh driver design since then.  German Physiks, an audio equipment firm in Germany, also produces speakers using this approach.

The German firm, Manger, has designed and produced a bending wave driver that at first glance appears conventional. In fact, the round panel attached to the voice coil bends in a carefully controlled way to produce full range sound.&lt;ref&gt;Manger, Josef W. [http://issuu.com/manger-msw/docs/acoustical_reality-1-?mode=window&amp;viewMode=singlePage "Acoustical Reality"].&lt;/ref&gt; Josef W. Manger was awarded with the "Diesel Medal" for extraordinary developments and inventions by the German institute of inventions.

====Flat panel loudspeakers====
There have been many attempts to reduce the size of speaker systems, or alternatively to make them less obvious. One such attempt was the development of "exciter" transducer coils mounted to flat panels to act as sound sources, most accurately called exciter/panel drivers.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} These can then be made in a neutral color and hung on walls where they are less noticeable than many speakers, or can be deliberately painted with patterns, in which case they can function decoratively. There are two related problems with flat panel techniques: first, a flat panel is necessarily more flexible than a cone shape in the same material, and therefore moves as a single unit even less, and second, resonances in the panel are difficult to control, leading to considerable distortions. Some progress has been made using such lightweight, rigid, materials such as [[Styrofoam]], and there have been several flat panel systems commercially produced in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theengineer.co.uk/Articles/300328/Sound+ideas.htm|title=The Engineer June 2007 article discussing solutions to direct sound|author=|date=|website=theengineer.co.uk|accessdate=14 April 2018}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Heil air motion transducers====
{{Main article|Air Motion Transformer}}
[[Image:AirMotionTransformer.png|right|thumb|300px|In Heil's air motion transducer, current through the membrane 2 causes it to move left and right in magnetic field 6, moving air in and out along directions 8; barriers 4 prevent air from moving in unintended directions.]]
[[Oskar Heil]] invented the air motion transducer in the 1960s. In this approach, a pleated diaphragm is mounted in a magnetic field and forced to close and open under control of a music signal. Air is forced from between the pleats in accordance with the imposed signal, generating sound. The drivers are less fragile than ribbons and considerably more efficient (and able to produce higher absolute output levels) than ribbon, electrostatic, or planar magnetic tweeter designs. ESS, a California manufacturer, licensed the design, employed Heil, and produced a range of speaker systems using his tweeters during the 1970s and 1980s. [[Lafayette Radio]], a large US retail store chain, also sold speaker systems using such tweeters for a time. There are several manufacturers of these drivers (at least two in Germany—one of which produces a range of high-end professional speakers using tweeters and mid-range drivers based on the technology) and the drivers are increasingly used in professional audio. Martin Logan produces several AMT speakers in the US and GoldenEar Technologies incorporates them in its entire speaker line.

====Transparent ionic conduction speaker====
In 2013, a research team introduced Transparent ionic conduction speaker which a 2 layers transparent conductive gel and a layer of transparent rubber in between to make high voltage and high actuation work to reproduce good sound quality. The speaker is suitable for robotics, mobile computing and adaptive optics fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/08/30/transparent-gel-speaker-ionic-conduction/#continued |title=Transparent gel speaker plays music through the magic of ionic conduction (video) |date=August 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Without a diaphragm===

====Plasma arc speakers====
{{Main article|Plasma speaker}}
[[File:Moeller Plasma.jpg|thumb|Plasma speaker]]
[[Plasma arc loudspeaker]]s use electrical [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] as a radiating element. Since plasma has minimal mass, but is charged and therefore can be manipulated by an [[electric field]], the result is a very linear output at frequencies far higher than the audible range. Problems of maintenance and reliability for this approach tend to make it unsuitable for mass market use. In 1978 Alan E. Hill of the Air Force Weapons Laboratory in Albuquerque, NM, designed the [[Plasmatronics]] Hill Type I, a tweeter whose plasma was generated from [[helium]] gas.&lt;ref name=nutshellhifi&gt;[http://www.nutshellhifi.com/library/speaker-design1.html Hill Plasmatronics] described. Retrieved March 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This avoided the [[ozone]] and [[nitrous oxide]]&lt;ref name=nutshellhifi/&gt; produced by [[Radio frequency|RF]] decomposition of air in an earlier generation of plasma tweeters made by the pioneering DuKane Corporation, who produced the Ionovac (marketed as the Ionofane in the UK) during the 1950s. Currently, there remain a few manufacturers in Germany who use this design, and a do-it-yourself design has been published and has been available on the Internet.

A less expensive variation on this theme is the use of a flame for the driver, as flames contain ionized (electrically charged) gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/feb98/888372043.Ot.r.html|title=Re: COULD YOU PLEASE FIND RESEARCH RE:SOUND REPRODUTION VIA GAS FLAME &amp; ELECTRI|author=|date=|website=www.madsci.org|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Thermoacoustic speakers====
In 2008, researchers of Tsinghua University demonstrated a thermoacoustic loudspeaker of [[carbon nanotube]] thin film,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Xiao|first=Lin|author2=Kaili Jiang |title=Flexible, Stretchable, Transparent Carbon Nanotube Thin Film Loudspeakers|journal=Nano Letters|year=2008|volume=8|issue=12|pages=4539–4545|doi=10.1021/nl802750z|pmid=19367976}}&lt;/ref&gt;  whose working mechanism is a thermoacoustic effect. Sound frequency electric currents are used to periodically heat the CNT and thus result in sound generation in the surrounding air. The CNT thin film loudspeaker is transparent, stretchable and flexible.

====Rotary woofers====

A [[rotary woofer]] is essentially a fan with blades that constantly change their pitch, allowing them to easily push the air back and forth.  Rotary woofers are able to efficiently reproduce [[infrasound]] frequencies, which are difficult to impossible to achieve on a traditional speaker with a diaphragm.  They are often employed in movie theaters to recreate rumbling bass effects, such as explosions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iar-80.com/page142.html|title=Eminent Technology TRW-17 Subwoofer Part I: The Only Subwoofer|website=International Audio/Video Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guttenberg|first1=Steve|title=World's most amazing subwoofer has no woofer|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/worlds-most-amazing-subwoofer-has-no-woofer/|website=Cnet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New technologies ===

====Digital speakers====
{{Main article|Digital speaker}}

[[Digital speakers]] have been the subject of experiments performed by [[Bell Labs]] as far back as the 1920s.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} The design is simple; each [[bit]] controls a driver, which is either fully 'on' or 'off'. Problems with this design have led manufacturers to abandon it as impractical for the present. First, for a reasonable number of bits (required for adequate [[Sound recording and reproduction|sound reproduction]] quality), the physical size of a speaker system becomes very large. Secondly, due to inherent [[analog digital conversion]] problems, the effect of [[aliasing]] is unavoidable, so that the audio output is "reflected" at equal amplitude in the frequency domain, on the other side of the [[sampling frequency]], causing an unacceptably high level of [[ultrasound|ultrasonic]]s to accompany the desired output. No workable scheme has been found to adequately deal with this.

The term "digital" or "digital-ready" is often used for marketing purposes on speakers or [[headphones]], but these systems are not digital in the sense described above. Rather, they are conventional speakers that can be used with digital sound sources (e.g., [[optical media]], [[MP3]] players, etc.), as can any conventional speaker.

'''Mahavihara''' ({{IAST|Mahāvihāra}}) is the [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]] term for a great [[vihara]] (Buddhist monastery) and is used to describe a monastic complex of viharas.

==Mahaviharas of India==
A range of monasteries grew up in ancient [[Magadha]] (modern [[Bihar]]) and [[Bengal]]. According to Tibetan sources, five great mahaviharas stood out during the [[Pala empire|Pāla]] period: Vikramashila, the premier university of the era; Nalanda, past its prime but still illustrious, Somapura, Odantapurā, and Jaggadala.&lt;ref&gt;Vajrayogini: Her Visualization, Rituals, and Forms by Elizabeth English. Wisdom Publications. {{ISBN|0-86171-329-X}} pg 15&lt;/ref&gt; The five monasteries formed a network; "all of them were under state supervision" and there existed "a system of co-ordination among them . . it seems from the evidence that the different seats of Buddhist learning that functioned in eastern India under the Pāla were regarded together as forming a network, an interlinked group of institutions," and it was common for great scholars to move easily from position to position among them.&lt;ref&gt;''Buddhist Monks And Monasteries Of India: Their History And Contribution To Indian Culture.'' by Dutt, Sukumar. George Allen and Unwin Ltd, London 1962. pg 352-3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nalanda===
{{Main|Nalanda}}
The famous Nalanda Mahavihara was founded a few centuries earlier; [[Xuanzang]] speaks about its magnificence and grandeur. Reference to this monastery is found in Tibetan and Chinese sources. During the Pāla period, Nālānda was less singularly outstanding, as other Pālā establishments "must have drawn away a number of learned monks from Nālānda when all of the  . . came under the aegis of the Pālās."&lt;ref&gt;''Buddhist Monks And Monasteries Of India: Their History And Contribution To Indian Culture.'' by Dutt, Sukumar. George Allen and Unwin Ltd, London 1962. pg 344&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the fame of this monastery lingered even after the Pala period.

===Odantapura===
{{Main|Odantapura}}
Odantapuri, also called Odantapura or Uddandapura, was a Buddhist vihara in what is now Bihar, India. It was established by King Gopala of the Pala dynasty in the 7th century. It is considered the second oldest of India's universities and was situated in Magadh. Currently it is known as the Bihar Sharif city (Headquarters of Nalanda District). Acharya Sri Ganga of Vikramashila had been a student here. According to the Tibetan records there were about 12,000 students at Odantapuri. Odantpuri was situated at a mountain called Hiranya Prabhat Parvat and the bank of the river Panchanan.

===Vikramashila===
{{Main|Vikramashila}}
Reference to a monastery known as Vikramashila is found in Tibetan records. The Pala ruler Dharmapala was its founder. The exact site of this vihara is at Antichak, a small village in Bhagalpur district (Bihar). The monastery had 107 temples and 50 other institutions providing room for 108 monks. It attracted scholars from neighbouring countries.

==Mahaviharas of Bangladesh==

===Somapura===
{{Main|Somapura}}
Somapura Mahavihara was located at Paharpur, 46.5&amp;nbsp;km to the north-west of [[Mahasthangarh]] in [[Bangladesh]]. The available data suggests that the Pala ruler Dharmapala founded the vihara. It followed the traditional [[cruciform]] plan for the central shrine. There were 177 individual cells around the central courtyard. There were central blocks in the middle of the eastern, southern and western sides. These might have been subsidiary chapels. It was the premier vihara of its kind and its fame lingered till the 11th century CE.

===Jagaddala===
{{Main|Jagaddala}}
Jagaddala Mahavihara was a [[Buddhist]] monastery and seat of learning in [[Varendra]], a geographical unit in present north Bengal.&lt;ref name="India 1962. pg 377"&gt;''Buddhist Monks And Monasteries Of India: Their History And Contribution To Indian Culture.'' by Dutt, Sukumar. George Allen and Unwin Ltd, London 1962. pg 377&lt;/ref&gt;  It was founded by the later kings of the [[Pāla dynasty]], probably [[Ramapala]] ({{circa|1077|1120}}), most likely at a site near the present village of Jagdal in [[Dhamoirhat Upazila]] in the north-west [[Bangladesh]] on the border with India,  near Paharapur.&lt;ref name="UNESCO World Heritage website"&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1212/ UNESCO World Heritage website]&lt;/ref&gt;



===Shalban Vihara===
{{Main|Shalban Vihara}}
also known as Bhavadev Bihar is another large monastery which flourished between 7th to 12th centuries AD&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Shalvan_Vihara |website=Banglapedia |accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Located in Comilla, Bangladesh,it was established by King Bhava Deva in the Lalmai Hills Ridge.

==Mahavihara of Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka==
{{Main|Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya}}
The '''Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya''' ([[Pāli|Pali]] for "Great Monastery") was an important monastery for [[Theravada Buddhism]] in [[Sri Lanka]]. It was founded by king [[Devanampiya Tissa]] (247–207 BCE) in his capital [[Anuradhapura]]. The Mahavihara was the place where the Mahavihara orthodoxy was established by monks such as [[Buddhaghosa]]. The traditional Theravadin account provided by the Mahavamsa stands in contrast to the writings of the [[Chinese Buddhism|Chinese Buddhist]] monk [[Faxian]] (Ch. 法顯), who journeyed to [[India]] and Sri Lanka in the early 5th century (between 399 and 414 CE). He recorded that the Mahavihara was not only intact, but housed 3000 monks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chapter XXXIX: The Cremation of an Arhat |work=A Record of Buddhistic Kingdoms |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/2124 |accessdate=2010-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Malaysia and the Club of Doom''''' (The Collapse of The Islamic Countries) is a book published in 2006 by [[Syed Akbar Ali]] who argues that countries with a [[Muslim]] majority population have collapsed economically, politically and socially.

==Theses==
With a particular focus on [[Malaysia]], the thesis of the book is that growing [[Islamization|Islamisation]] of the political and social climate in Islamic countries are causing democracy and freedom to be threatened by religious irrationalism. He attempts to show how the curtailing of [[democracy]] and [[freedom of speech]] have caused those countries to collapse.  He further draws a distinction between Islam and its current practises, and offers his perspective that current practises of Muslims are not in vein with the true meaning of [[Islam]] with that being the underlying cause for the collapse of those countries.

The book takes pains to stress that many practises that define Islam on the world stage like stringent laws, cruel punishments and irrational beliefs cannot be found in the [[Quran]]. Syed Akbar Ali then proceeds to show that many of these extra Quranic beliefs and practises which have brought about the downfall of the Muslims are actually taken from the [[Bible]].

In the Malaysian context, his book also exposes a masquerade whereby certain 'Islamic' laws pertaining to divorce are actually a reworded version of [[English common law|English Law]] taken from the Marriage and Divorce Act -  a left over of British colonialism. The book also dismisses '[[Islamic banking]]' as 'Arabic banking' i.e. conventional banking with Arabic prefixes attached for camouflage.

==Author==
Syed Akbar Ali (49 years' old) is well known among the Malaysian [[intelligentsia]], especially among its Muslim intellectuals.  A graduate of an American university who developed a career in banking, Syed was also an often controversial newspaper columnist - pushing the envelope on free and unfettered discussion on religious and political issues in Malaysia.

His debut book ''To Digress A Little'', published in July 2005, stirred much discussion in Malaysia for its frank and honest appraisal of Malaysia's [[affirmative action]] policies which it claims have now outlived their usefulness.

The '''Malcolm Knapp Research Forest''' is located in the [[Coast Mountains]], about 60&amp;nbsp;km from [[Vancouver]], in [[Maple Ridge, British Columbia]]. The forest is approximately 5,157 hectares and has many different types of terrain. The forest is home to some 400-year-old trees, though the vast majority of trees are 70–120 years old. It was a site of major logging from the 1800s to 1931, but was officially established as the UBC/Malcolm Knapp Research Forest in 1949 because of the major influence from the late UBC professor [[Malcolm Knapp]]. Although today it is dedicated to research and education, it is also a popular destination for trail hiking and camps. 

__TOC__

==Historic influence and UBC research==

In 1922 when the forestry program at UBC was just two years old, [[Malcolm Knapp]], a professor of forestry, had a vision to conduct research for forestry. He taught courses on logging, wood technology and forestry products. At this time, the university only had a small forest on the edge of campus for research, so his influence was immense{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=June 2015}} when the [[University of British Columbia]] took over management of the forest in 1949. His vision of having a large and vast forest became reality. This vision, along with his passion for [[salvage archaeology|salvaging]] and [[silviculture]] for the Forestry Program at UBC, was of great importance{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=June 2015}} as his 41 years of service for the university ended in 1963. After his many years of service to the forest and the university, the Research Forest officially changed its name to Malcolm Knapp/UBC Research Forest in 1988, and then he died a year later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Malcolm Knapp&amp;#124; History|url=http://www.mkrf.forestry.ubc.ca/about/history/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UBC also holds a spot at the top of one of the mountains for a [[liquid mirror telescope]] observatory (UBC LMTO). It was established in 1995 as part of development for liquid-mirror technology. The telescope overlooks the [[Fraser Valley]] and is far enough away from the city lights to provide a great{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=June 2015}} research facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UBC LMTO|url=http://www.mkrf.forestry.ubc.ca/research/liquid-mirror-telescope/|accessdate=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are currently{{When|date=June 2015}} 84 research projects going on at the forest, all related to riparian management, silviculture, wildlife, hydrology, ecology, and other applied science fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UBC Research Projects Database|url=http://www.mkrf.forestry.ubc.ca/research/research-projects-database/}}&lt;/ref&gt; UBC also releases annual reports in which one can see what is going on in the forest, what research they are conducting and any updates on projects. Staff changes, silviculture reports (including clear-cuts, thinning, etc.), along with major events for the forest are all summarized in these reports. Please see external links for archives.

==Ecology==

[[File:Old growth Douglas-fir, Malcolm Knapp Research Forest, BC, Canada.jpg|thumb]]

[[File:Blooming Skunk Cabbage.JPG|thumb]]

The forest is about {{convert|5,157|ha}}. It measures 13&amp;nbsp;km from west to east and 4&amp;nbsp;km north to south. It contains every type of terrain found on Coastal B.C which means that it has a wide variety of many plants, animals and trees. The highest elevation is in the north-east corner and is about 1000m above sea level in the [[Golden Ears (peaks)|Golden Ears Mountains]], and it spans down to sea level, touching [[Pitt Lake]]. Typically, the most precipitation that is seen at the forest is rain, which averages about 2200mm in the northern end of the forest. This end also receives snow in the winter. However, the south end is closer to sea level and receives around 3000mm of rain per year.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=Malcolm Knapp Research Forest|url=http://www.mkrf.forestry.ubc.ca/about/location-and-ecology/|accessdate=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malcolm Knapp Research Forest is categorized in the [[Biogeoclimatic zones of British Columbia|Coast Western Hemlock Biogeoclimatic zone]], with the lower portion of the forest in the dry maritime subzone and the upper portion in the very wet maritime subzone. It has a vast collection of trees, plants and animals including [[Douglas fir]], [[western red cedar]], [[western hemlock]] and [[amabilis fir]] trees. The forest still has some patches of intact old growth forest that is over 400 years old, but since ongoing research is being done, some of the forest is as young as 40 years old, though most of the forest is covered in trees that are about 70 years old.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Some other trees and plants you can find are [[bigleaf maple]], [[vine maple]], [[Lysichiton americanus|skunk cabbage]] (yellow flower pictured beside), [[Oregon grape]], [[salmonberry]], and many ferns like [[Polystichum munitum|sword fern]] and [[Dryopteris expansa|spiny wood fern]].

==Recreation==
[[File:Trails at Malcolm Knapp.JPG|thumb]]
The maximum trail length is about 8&amp;nbsp;km; that will take the average hiker around 3 hours to walk. The trails at Malcolm Knapp are categorized as an intermediate hike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vancouver Trails &amp;#124; UBC Malcolm Knapp|url=http://www.vancouvertrails.com/trails/ubc-malcolm-knapp-research-forest/|accessdate=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Malcolm Knapp hiking===
[[File:Markers.JPG|thumb]]
The south part of Malcolm Knapp Research Forest has an abundance of trails which are all colour coded into Red, Green, Yellow, and blue, with red being the easiest and blue being the hardest. Please see external links for a map of the trails.

===Loon Lake hiking===
The Loon Lake Trail is for guests of Loon Lake Research and Education Centre wishing to embark on this 6&amp;nbsp;km hike. Please see external links for a map of the trails.

====Loon Lake Research and Education Center====

On the trails at Loon Lake, there is a research and education center. Loon Lake is the largest lake in the forest, which has its own trail around the lake that will take about 6 hours to complete as it is 6&amp;nbsp;km in length. The lake opened an outdoor education camp in 2000, and now provides an area for forestry and environmental education, as well as outdoor recreation with activities such as:&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Loon Lake Lodge and Retreat Center|url=http://loonlake.ubc.ca/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Canoe &amp; Water Adventures
* SKY Helicopter Tours
* Eco-Tours and Hiking
* Inspired Learning educational programs
* Pinnacle Pursuits
* Rock-climbing, rappelling, high/low ropes, team building

====Camp Goodtimes====
Loon Lake also houses Camp Goodtimes, a summer recreation program for children and teens affected by cancer and their families. It is divided into six weeks throughout July and August: four weeks for kids' camp, one week for teen, and one week for family. It is held at Loon Lake at no cost to participants.

[[File:Milky sea nightcolor5x5.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Milky sea effect off the coast of [[Somalia]] in the [[Indian Ocean]]]]

'''Milky seas''', also called '''mareel''', is a luminous phenomenon in the [[ocean]] in which large areas of [[seawater]] (up to {{convert|6000|mi2|km2|abbr=on|disp=or}}) appear to glow brightly enough at night to be seen by [[satellite]]s [[geocentric orbit|orbiting]] [[Earth]]. Modern science only tentatively attributes this effect to [[bioluminescent]] [[bacteria]] or [[dinoflagellate]]s, causing the sea to uniformly display an eerie blue glow at night. However, no modern research proves that bioluminescent bacteria are capable of illuminating the ocean from horizon to horizon and for days at a time, as described in [[sailor|mariners]]' tales for centuries (notably appearing in chapter 23 of [[Jules Verne]]'s ''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]]''). In fact, the effect has not been rigorously documented nor thoroughly explained, even in modern times.

==Effect==
[[File:Noctiluca scintillans.jpg|thumb|This [[long-exposure photo]] shows the [[bioluminescence]] of ''[[Noctiluca scintillans]]'' in the yacht port of [[Zeebrugge]], Belgium]]

Between 1915 and 1993, 235 sightings of milky seas were documented,&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=ty8eAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22235+reports+ascribable+to+milky+seas%22&amp;dq=%22235+reports+ascribable+to+milky+seas%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZQv2VL7ZDYe8ggTrjYGYAw&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA&lt;/ref&gt; most of which are concentrated in the northwestern [[Indian Ocean]] and near [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=1242338|year=2005|author1=Miller|first1=S.

In 1985, a research vessel in the [[Arabian Sea]] took water samples during milky seas. Their conclusions were that the effect was caused by the [[bacteria]] ''[[Vibrio harveyi]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ramaiah |first=N. D. Chandramohan |year=1992 |title=Ecology and biology of luminous bacteria in the Arabian Sea |work=Oceanography of the Indian Ocean |editor=Desai, B. N. |page=11–23 |publisher=Oxford and [[India Book House]] |location=New Delhi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mareel is typically caused by ''[[Noctiluca scintillans]]'' (popularly known as "sea sparkle"), a [[dinoflagellate]] that glows when disturbed and is found in oceans throughout much of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Tada; Pithakpol; and Montami (2004).

Journal of Plankton Research 17(1): 29-40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oceana: ''[http://oceana.org/en/explore/marine-wildlife/noctiluca-scintillans Noctiluca scintillans.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111212503/http://oceana.org/en/explore/marine-wildlife/noctiluca-scintillans |date=2012-11-11 }}'' Marine Animal Encyclopedia. Retrieved 27 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
In July 2015, at Alleppey, Kerala, India, the phenomenon occurred and the National Institute of Oceanography and Kerala Fisheries Department researched it, finding that the glittering waves were the result of the Noctiluca scintillans.
In 2005, Steven Miller of the [[Naval Research Laboratory]] in [[Monterey, California]], was able to match 1995 [[satellite images]] with a first-hand account of a merchant ship.  U.S. [[Defense Meteorological Satellite Program]] showed the milky area to be approximately {{convert|15400|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} (roughly the size of [[Connecticut]]). The luminescent field was observed to glow over three consecutive nights.

While monochromatic photos make this effect appear white, [[Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute]] scientist [[Steven Haddock]] (an author of a milky seas effect study) has commented, "the light produced by the bacteria is actually blue, not white. It is white in the graphic because of the monochromatic sensor we used, and it can appear white to the eye because the rods in our eye (used for night vision) don't discriminate color."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=David Pescovitz at 9:51 am Tue, Oct 4, 2005 |url=http://www.boingboing.net/2005/10/04/first_milky_sea_phot.html |title=First milky sea photo |publisher=Boing Boing |date=2005-10-04 |accessdate=2014-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709084920/http://www.boingboing.net/2005/10/04/first_milky_sea_phot.html |archivedate=2011-07-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Shetland]] (where generally caused by ''Noctiluca scintillans''), mareel has sometimes been described as being green,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moncrieff|first1=Helen|title=Mareel - Lights From The Sea|url=http://www.rspb.org.uk/community/getinvolved/b/seabirds/archive/2011/03/01/mareel-lights-from-the-sea.aspx|website=The RSPB Community|accessdate=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than the traditional blue or white milky seas effect seen by the rest of the world. It is not known whether this difference depends on the area, or simply a perception of a [[cyan]]ic colour as being green.

==Etymology==
The phenomenon is known as ''[[wikt:mareel|mareel]]'' in Shetland. This term is derived from the [[Norn language|Norn]] word ''*mareld'', which is itself derived from the [[Old Norse]] word ''mǫrueldr'', which is a compound of ''marr'' (mere, sea) and ''eldr'' (fire). {{efn|Cognates of ''mareel'' include the [[Icelandic language|Icelandish]] term ''maurildi'' which refers to both the mareel itself, and also to the [[Noctilucales]] order of marine [[dinoflagellates]] that bring about the mareel, [[Danish language|Danish]] ''morild'', [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] ''morild'' or ''moreld'', [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''mareld'', and [[Finnish language|Finnish]] ''merituli''.}}

'''OPC Unified Architecture''' ('''OPC UA''') is a [[machine to machine]] [[communication protocol]] for [[industrial automation]] developed by the [[OPC Foundation]]. Distinguishing characteristics are:
* Focus on communicating with industrial equipment and systems for data collection and control
* [[open standard|Open]] - freely available and implementable under GPL 2.0 license &lt;ref&gt;https://opcfoundation.org/license/gpl.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Cross-platform]] - not tied to one operating system or programming language
* [[Service-oriented architecture]] (SOA)
* Inherent complexity - the specification consists of 1250 pages in 14 documents
* Robust [[Information security|security]]
* Integral [[information model]], which is the foundation of the infrastructure necessary for information integration where vendors and organizations can model their complex data into an OPC UA namespace to take advantage of the rich service-oriented architecture of OPC UA. There are over 35 collaborations with the OPC Foundation currently. Key industries include [[pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical]], [[oil and gas industry|oil and gas]], [[building automation]], [[industrial robotics]], security, manufacturing and [[process control]].

== History ==
Although developed by the same organization, OPC UA differs significantly from its predecessor, [[Open Platform Communications]] (OPC). The Foundation's goal for OPC UA was to provide a path forward from the original [[OLE for process control|OPC]] communications model (namely the [[Microsoft Windows]]-only process exchange COM/[[Distributed Component Object Model|DCOM]]) that would better meet the emerging needs of [[industrial automation]].&lt;ref&gt;Mahnke, Wolfgang; Leitner, Stefan-Helmut https://library.e.abb.com/public/75d70c47268d78bfc125762d00481f78/56-61%203M903_ENG72dpi.pdf OPC Unified Architecture - The future standard for communication and information modeling in automation], 3/2009 [http://www.abb.com/abbreview ABB Review 3/2009, page 56-61]&lt;/ref&gt;

After more than three years of specification work and another year for a prototype implementation, the first version of the Unified Architecture was released in 2006.

The current version of the specification is on 1.04 (22 Nov 2017&lt;ref&gt;https://opcfoundation.org/developer-tools/specifications-unified-architecture&lt;/ref&gt;). The new version of OPC UA now has added publish/subscribe in addition to the client/server communications infrastructure.

== Innovations ==
Although the original binding to COM/[[Distributed Component Object Model|DCOM]] helped [[OLE for process control|OPC]] to distribute well, it had several drawbacks:
* Frequent configuration issues with DCOM;
* No configurable time-outs;
* [[Microsoft Windows]] only;
* Lower security;
* No control over DCOM (COM/DCOM is kind of a black box, developers have no access to sources and therefore have to deal with bugs or insufficient implementations).

These drawbacks along with a number of other considerations pushed the decision to develop a new and independent stack for OPC UA, which replaces COM/DCOM. The main characteristics of this communication stack were:
* Multi-platform implementation, including portable [[ANSI C]], [[Java (software platform)|Java]] and [[.NET Framework|.NET]] implementations;
* Scalability: from smart sensors and smart actuators to mainframes;
* Multi-threaded, as well as single-threaded/single-task operation&amp;mdash;necessary for porting the stack to embedded devices;
* Security, based on new standards;
* Configurable time-outs for each service;
* Chunking of big datagrams.

This communication stack reflects the beginning of various innovations. The OPC UA architecture is a service-oriented architecture (SOA) and is based on different logical levels.

OPC Base Services are abstract method descriptions, which are protocol independent and provide the basis for OPC UA functionality. The transport layer puts these methods into a protocol, which means it serializes/deserializes the data and transmits it over the network.
Two [[communication protocol|protocols]] are specified for this purpose. One is a binary [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] protocol, optimized for high performance and the second is [[Web service]]-oriented.

The OPC information model is a so-called Full Mesh Network based on [[node (networking)|node]]s. These nodes can include any kind of meta information, and are similar to the objects of [[object-oriented programming]] (OOP). A node can have attributes for read access (DA, HDA), methods that can be called (Commands), and triggered events that can be transmitted (AE, DataAccess, DataChange). Nodes hold process data as well all other types of [[metadata]]. The OPC namespace contains the type model.

Client software can verify what Profiles a server supports. This is necessary to obtain information, if a server only supports DA functionality or additionally AE, HDA, etc. Additionally, information can be obtained about whether a server supports a given profile. New and important features of OPC UA are:
* '''Redundancy''' support
* '''Heartbeat''' for connections in both directions (to indicate whether the other end is "alive"). This means that both server and client recognize interrupts.
* '''Buffering''' of data and acknowledgements of transmitted data. Lost connections don't lead to lost data anymore. Lost datagrams can be refetched.

At the OPC UA DevCon in October 2006 in Munich the first prototypes were presented live. Various UA Servers have been shown on a [[Beckhoff]] [[programmable logic controller]] and an embedded test board from Euros. The Beckhoff PLC is based on Windows XP Embedded and the embedded controller is based on the [[real-time operating system]] Euros. The company Embedded Labs Ltd demonstrated an OPC-UA Server based on their own C++ UA Stack executing on a single chip [[ARM Holdings|ARM]] microcontroller with 64kB [[RAM]]. In October 2012 the German Fraunhofer-Application Center IOSB-INA and the Institute for industrial Information Technologies (inIT) shows, that an OPC-UA server is scalable downto 15 kB RAM and 10 kB ROM and therefore usable at chip level.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hs-owl.de/init/en/aktuelles/news/news-detail/news/the-worlds-smallest-opc-ua-server-comes-from-germany.html The world's smallest OPC-UA server comes from Germany]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protocols==
OPC UA supports two protocols.&lt;ref&gt;Leitner, Stefan-Helmut; Mahnke, Wolfgang [http://pi.informatik.uni-siegen.de/stt/26_4/01_Fachgruppenberichte/ORA2006/07_leitner-final.pdf OPC UA – Service-oriented Architecture for Industrial Applications], 11/2006 [http://pi.informatik.uni-siegen.de/stt/index.html Softwaretechnik-Trends] {{ISSN|0720-8928}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is visible to application programmers only via changes to the URL. The binary protocol is '''opc.tcp://Server''' and '''&lt;nowiki&gt;http://Server&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' is for Web Service. Otherwise OPC UA works completely transparent to the [[Application programming interface|API]].

The binary protocol offers the best performance/least overhead, takes minimum resources (no XML Parser, [[SOAP]] and [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] required, which is important for embedded devices), offers best interoperability (binary is explicitly specified and allows fewer degrees of freedom during implementation) and uses a single arbitrarily choosable TCP port for communication easing tunneling or easy enablement through a firewall.

The Web Service (SOAP) protocol is best supported from available tools, e.g., from Java or .NET environments, and is firewall-friendly, using standard HTTP(S) ports.

Binary is supported by all implementations, while only .NET implementation supports SOAP.

==Specifications==
The OPC UA specification is a multi-part specification and consists of the following parts:
# Concepts
# Security Model
# Address Space Model
# Services
# Information Model
# Mappings
# Profiles
# Data Access
# Alarms and Conditions
# Programs
# Historical Access
# Discovery
# Aggregates
# PubSub

In contrast to the COM-based specifications, the UA specifications are not pure application specifications. They describe typically UA internal mechanisms, which get handled through the communication stack and are normally only of interest for those that port a stack to a specific target or those that want to implement their own UA stack.

The OPC UA application developers code against the OPC UA API and therefore mainly use API documentation. Nevertheless, part 3, 4, and 5 may be of interest for application developers.&lt;ref&gt;Massaro, Simone [http://www.plantengineering.com/index.php?id=1792&amp;cHash=081010&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=35007 What is OPC UA and how does it affect your world?], 5/15/2008 [http://www.plantengineering.com planetengineering.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discussion==
The OPC-UA protocol specification consists of 14 documents for a total of 1250 pages. Due to this complexity, existing implementations are usually incomplete. In addition, the existence of several serialization formats, as well as the possibility of selectively implementing certain services such as PubSub, eventually lead to a great heterogeneity of the OPC-UA connection points. Under these conditions, it is finally difficult to develop client applications that are independent of the specific implementation of each server. In this sense, OPC-UA does not achieve its promise of ensuring good interoperability of systems. This can be seen typically in factory and infrastructure projects integrating various PLC technologies, each delivered with a different and limited implementation of the OPC-UA protocol.

The specification is still evolving, the last specification document volume 14 is dated February 6, 2018, while the first publication of the standard OPC-UA dates from 2006.

As a result, despite considerable marketing efforts to support its adoption, OPC-UA may be considered at this stage as a standardization attempt rather than an established standard.

==UA communication stack==
The architecture of a UA application, independent of whether it is the server or client part, is structured into levels.

Some parts equalize to the former COM Proxy/Stubs and get provided by the OPC Foundation. The portability level is new; it simplifies porting the UA ANSI C stack also to other target platforms. A port layer for Windows and [[Linux]] gets also provided by the OPC Foundation.

==UA security==
UA Security consists of authentication and authorization, encryption and data integrity via signatures. For Web Services the [[WS-SecureConversation]] gets used and is therefore compatible to [[.NET Framework|.NET]] and other [[SOAP]] implementations. For the binary variant, the algorithms of WS-SecureConversation have been followed and also converted to a binary equivalent. This is named as UA Secure Conversation.

There is also a mixed version where the code is binary, but the transport layer is SOAP. This is a compromise between efficient binary coding and firewall-friendly transmission. Binary coding always requires UA Secure Conversation.
The authentication uses [[X.509]] certificates exclusively. It relies on the application developer to choose which certificate store the UA application gets bound to. For instance, it is possible to use the [[public key infrastructure]] (PKI) of an [[Active Directory]].

==OPC UA APIs==
UA APIs are available in several programming languages. Commercial SDK are available for C, C++, Java, and .NET. Open-source stacks are available at least for C, C++, Java, Javascript(node) and Python [https://github.com/open62541/open62541/wiki/List-of-Open-Source-OPC-UA-Implementations].

==C++ Implementation==
* The [https://github.com/open62541/open62541 open62541] project provides an Open Source implementation for OPC UA server and clients and is licensed under the [[Mozilla Public License]] v2.0. Besides Linux and Windows, it also supports OS X, QNX and different embedded systems as compilation target.
* The ASNeG project provides a C++ open source (Apache License 2.0) OPC UA Application Server and an OPC UA Web Server (beta state, currently only base functions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://asneg.de |title=ASNeG – open source OPC UA Application Server | accessdate=2015-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [https://freeopcua.github.io/ FreeOpcUa] project provides an open source ([[GNU Lesser General Public License|LGPL]]) server and client implementation in C++.
* The [https://github.com/uaf/uaf UAF] project offers an open source (LGPL) C++/Python implementation .

==.NET implementation==
The .NET implementation uses ANSI C for the lower levels and implements the rest natively in .NET. That means only the handling of the socket and the Message-Chunking gets integrated from the ANSI C stack. De-serialization takes place directly in .NET and therefore gets converted directly into .NET structures and objects. This provides better performance than de-serializing into a C structure first and then copying the data to a .NET structure afterwards.

==Java implementation==
Various stacks for Java were being developed. Similar to .NET, there are principally three variants:
#Encapsulate the complete ANSI C stack via [[Java Native Interface|JNI]], which complicates portability. Although the stack can be ported to different operating systems, it needs to get compiled for those individually. Also, the data needs to get copied to the JNI boundary, but benefits from the performance of C during de-serialization.
#Code directly on the network layer (similar to the current .Net implementation) and de-serialize in Java. This saves one data copy execution, but still depends on the C stack.
#Write a native Java OPC UA stack. This was observed to be the most portable, but estimated to take the most engineering effort to implement. The Eclipse Milo project provides a pure-Java, open-source, implementation of the UA 1.03 client and server specification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/milo |title=OPC Unified Architecture (UA) client and/or server functionality in any JVM-based project |accessdate=22 Aug 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, there is the simple variant to only support the WebService protocol. For that, a SOAP Toolkit that supports [[WS-Security]] is needed.

== Python implementation ==
The [https://freeopcua.github.io/ FreeOpcUa] project provides an implementation entirely in the Python programming language (compatible with Python 2, 3 and pypy) and provides high-level abstractions of an OPC-UA client and server which can be used as is or readily extended for custom applications.

A '''phallus''' is a [[penis]] (especially when [[Erection|erect]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/phallus "Definition of phallus in English"] Oxford Dictionaries. Retrieved 16 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; an object that resembles a penis, or a [[mimesis|mimetic]] image of an erect penis.

Any object that symbolically—or, more precisely, iconically—resembles a penis may also be referred to as a phallus; however, such objects are more often referred to as being '''phallic''' (as in "'''phallic symbol'''"). Such symbols often represent fertility and cultural implications that are associated with the male sexual organ, as well as the [[male orgasm]].

==Etymology==
[[File:Tintinnabulum Pompeii MAN Napoli Inv27839.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Tintinnabulum (Ancient Rome)|Tintinnabulum]] from Pompeii showing a phallus]]
The term is a loanword from [[Latin]] ''phallus'', itself borrowed from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|φαλλός}}, which is ultimately a derivation from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] [[Root (linguistics)|root]] *''bʰel''- "to inflate, swell". Compare with [[Old Norse]] (and [[Icelandic language|modern Icelandic]]) ''boli'' "[[bull]]", [[Old English]] ''bulluc'' "[[Cattle|bullock]]", Greek {{lang|grc|φαλλή}} "[[whale]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=penis&amp;searchmode=none etymonline.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeology==

The Hohle phallus, a 28,000-year-old siltstone phallus discovered in the [[Hohle Fels]] cave and reassembled in 2005, is among the oldest phallic representations known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jonathan|last=Amos

==Religion==

===Classical antiquity===
[[File:Bronze ithyphallic figurine with a head of phalluses.jpg|thumb|left|125px|Polyphallic wind chime from [[Pompeii]]; a bell hung from each phallus]]
[[File:0007MAN-Herma.jpg|thumb|100px|left|[[Herma|Herm]]]]
In traditional [[Greek mythology]], [[Hermes]], god of boundaries and exchange (popularly the ''messenger'' god) is considered to be a phallic deity by association with representations of him on [[herms]] (pillars) featuring a phallus. There is no scholarly consensus on this depiction and it would be speculation to consider Hermes a type of fertility god.  [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], son of [[Hermes]], was often depicted as having an exaggerated erect phallus.

[[Priapus]] is a Greek god of fertility whose symbol was an exaggerated phallus. The son of [[Aphrodite]] and either [[Dionysus]] or [[Adonis]], according to different forms of the original myth, he is the protector of livestock, fruit plants, gardens, and male genitalia.  His name is the origin of the medical term [[priapism]].

The city of [[Tyrnavos]] in Greece holds an annual [[Phallic processions|Phallus festival]], a traditional phallophoric event on the first days of [[Lent]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,553070,00.html "The Annual Phallus Festival in Greece"], ''Der Spiegel'', English edition, Retrieved on the 15-12-08&lt;/ref&gt;

The phallus was ubiquitous in [[culture of ancient Rome|ancient Roman culture]], particularly in the form of the ''[[fascinum]]'', a phallic charm. The ruins of [[Pompeii]] produced bronze wind chimes ''([[Tintinnabulum (Ancient Rome)|tintinnabula]])'' that featured the phallus, often in multiples, to ward off the [[evil eye]] and other malevolent influences. Statues of Priapus similarly guarded gardens. Roman boys wore the ''[[Bulla (amulet)|bulla]]'', an amulet that contained a phallic charm, until they formally came of age. According to [[Augustine of Hippo]], the cult of [[Liber|Father Liber]], who presided over the citizen's entry into political and sexual manhood, involved a phallus. The phallic deity [[Mutunus Tutunus]] promoted marital sex. A sacred phallus was among the objects considered vital to the security of the Roman state which were in the keeping of the [[Vestal Virgins]]. [[Sexuality in ancient Rome]] has sometimes been characterized as "[[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Phallic sexuality|phallocentric]]".

===Ancient India===

===Ancient Egypt===
[[File:Osiris statuette cropped.jpg|thumb|Egyptian statuette of Osiris with phallus and [[amulet]]s]]
The phallus played a role in the cult of [[Osiris]] in [[ancient Egyptian religion]]. When Osiris' body was cut in 14 pieces, [[Set (mythology)|Set]] scattered them all over Egypt and his wife [[Isis]] retrieved all of them except one, his penis, which was swallowed by a fish; see the [[Legend of Osiris and Isis]]. Isis made him a wooden replacement.

The phallus was a symbol of fertility, and the god [[Min (god)|Min]] was often depicted as ithyphallic, that is, with an erect penis.

===Indonesia===
According to the Indonesian chronicles of the [[Babad Tanah Jawi]], Prince Puger gained the kingly power from [[God]], by ingesting sperm from the phallus of the already-dead [[Amangkurat II of Mataram|Sultan Amangkurat II of Mataram]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moertono|first=Soemarsaid|title=State and Statecraft in Old Java: A Study of the Later Mataram Period, 16th to 19th Century|year=2009|publisher=Equinoc Publishing|isbn=9786028397438|pages=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Darmaputera|first=Eka|title=Pancasila and the search for identity and modernity in Indonesian society: a cultural and ethical analysis|year=1988|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004084223|pages=108–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
The Mara Kannon Shrine (麻羅観音) in [[Nagato, Yamaguchi|Nagato]], [[Yamaguchi prefecture]] is one of many fertility shrines in Japan that still exist today. Also present in festivals such as the [[Danjiri Matsuri]] (だんじり祭)&lt;ref name=farstrider1&gt;[http://farstrider.net/Japan/Festivals/DanjiriMatsuri/index.htm Danjiri Matsuri Festival]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Kishiwada, Osaka|Kishiwada]], [[Osaka prefecture]], the [[Kanamara Matsuri]], in [[Kawasaki, Kanagawa|Kawasaki]], and the [[Hōnen Matsuri|Hōnen Matsuri (豊年祭 Harvest Festival)]], in [[Komaki, Aichi|Komaki (小牧市 Komaki-shi)]], [[Aichi Prefecture|Aichi Prefecture (愛知県 Aichi-ken)]], though historically phallus adoration was more widespread.

[[File:Cucutenireperezentarefalica.jpg|thumb|Phallus representation [[Cucuteni Culture]] 3000 BC]]

''Kuker'' is a divinity personifying fecundity, sometimes in [[Bulgaria]] and [[Serbia]] it is a plural divinity. In Bulgaria, a ritual spectacle of spring (a sort of [[carnival]] performed by [[Kukeri]]) takes place after a scenario of folk theatre, in which Kuker's role is interpreted by a man attired in a sheep- or goat-pelt, wearing a horned mask and girded with a large wooden phallus. During the ritual, various physiological acts are interpreted, including the sexual act, as a symbol of the god's sacred marriage, while the symbolical wife, appearing pregnant, mimes the pains of giving birth. This ritual inaugurates the labours of the fields ([[ploughing]], [[sowing]]) and is carried out with the participation of numerous allegorical personages, among which is the Emperor and his entourage.&lt;ref name="Kernbach"&gt;Kernbach, Victor (1989).

===Switzerland===
[[File:Portein wappen.svg|thumb|The bear on the arms of [[Portein]], [[Switzerland]] has a clearly visible red phallus, in accordance with [[Vilené|the long-held tradition.]]]]

In [[Switzerland]], the heraldic bears in a coat of arms had to be painted with bright red [[penis]]es, otherwise they would have been mocked as being she-bears. In 1579, a calendar printed in [[St. Gallen]] omitted the genitals from the heraldic bear of [[Appenzell]], nearly leading to war between the two cantons.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | last1=Neubecker | first1=Ottfried | title=Heraldry : sources, symbols, and meaning | date=1976 | publisher=McGraw-Hill | location=New York | isbn=9780070463080 | page=120 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | last1=Strehler | first1=Hermann | title=Das Churer Missale von 1589 | journal=Gutenberg-Jahrbuch | date=1965 | volume=40 | page=186 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | last1=Grzimek | first1=Bernhard | title=Grzimek's Animal life encyclopedia | date=1972 | publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold Co. | location=New York | volume=12 | page=119 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=7UgQAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22An+armorial+bear+once+nearly+caused+war+between+Appenzell+and+St.+Gallen+%28Switzerland%29+in+1578.%22&amp;dq=%22An+armorial+bear+once+nearly+caused+war+between+Appenzell+and+St.+Gallen+%28Switzerland%29+in+1578.%22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Americas===
Figures of [[Kokopelli]] and [[Itzamna]] (as the Mayan tonsured maize god) in [[Pre-Columbian America]] often include phallic content. Additionally, over forty large monolithic sculptures (''Xkeptunich'') have been documented from Terminal Classic Maya sites with the majority of examples occurring in the Puuc region of Yucatán (Amrhein 2001). Uxmal has the largest collection with eleven sculptures now housed under a protective roof on site. The largest sculpture was recorded at Almuchil measuring more than 320&amp;nbsp;cm high with a diameter at the base of the shaft measuring 44&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref&gt;Amrhein, Laura Marie (2001). An Iconographic and Historic Analysis of Terminal Classic Maya Phallic Imagery. Unpublished PhD dissertation, Richmond: [[Virginia Commonwealth University]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative sects===

[[St. Priapus Church]] (French: ''Église S. Priape'') is a North American new religion that centres on the worship of the phallus.  Founded in the 1980s in Montreal, Quebec, by D. F. Cassidy, it has a following mainly among homosexual men in Canada and the United States.  Semen is also treated with reverence and its consumption is an act of worship.&lt;ref&gt;J. Gordon Melton (1996, 5th ed.). Encyclopedia of American Religions (Detroit, Mich.: Gale) {{ISBN|0-8103-7714-4}} p. 952.&lt;/ref&gt; Semen is esteemed as sacred because of its divine life-giving power.

==Psychoanalysis==
[[File:Phallic-Head Plate, 1536 .jpg|170px|thumb|Phallic-Head Plate, [[Gubbio, Italy]], 1536]]
The symbolic version of the phallus, a phallic symbol is meant to represent male generative powers. According to [[Sigmund Freud]]'s theory of [[psychoanalysis]], while males possess a penis, no one can possess the symbolic phallus. [[Jacques Lacan]]'s ''Ecrits: A Selection'' includes an essay titled ''The Signification of the Phallus'' in which sexual differentiation is represented in terms of the difference between "being" and "having" the phallus, which for Lacan is the transcendent signifier of desire. Men are positioned as men insofar as they wish to ''have'' the phallus. Women, on the other hand, wish to ''be'' the phallus.  This difference between having and being explains some tragicomic aspects of sexual life.  Once a woman becomes, in the realm of the signifier, the phallus the man wants, he ceases to want it, because one cannot desire what one has, and the man may be drawn to other women. Similarly, though, for the woman, the gift of the phallus deprives the man of what he has, and thereby diminishes her desire. 

In ''Gender Trouble'', [[Judith Butler]] explores Freud's and Lacan's discussions of the symbolic phallus by pointing out the connection between the phallus and the penis. She writes, "The law requires conformity to its own notion of 'nature'. It gains its legitimacy through the binary and asymmetrical naturalization of bodies in which the phallus, though clearly not identical to the penis, deploys the penis as its naturalized instrument and sign". In ''Bodies that Matter'', she further explores the possibilities for the phallus in her discussion of ''The Lesbian Phallus''. If, as she notes, Freud enumerates a set of analogies and substitutions that rhetorically affirm the fundamental transferability of the phallus from the penis elsewhere, then any number of other things might come to stand in for the phallus.

==Modern use of the phallus==
The phallus is often used to advertise [[pornography]], as well as the sale of [[contraception]]. It has often been used in provocative practical jokes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=525595|title=Yale Band Punished for Half-Time Show|work=The Harvard Crimson|accessdate=2008-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been the central focus of adult-audience performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2002/11/01/DD88346.DTL|title=Puppetry of the Penis|work=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=2008-12-01 | first=Robert | last=Hurwitt|date=2002-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phallus had a new set of art interpretations in the 20th century with the rise of [[Sigmund Freud]], the founder of modern [[psychoanalysis]] of [[psychology]].  One example is "[[Princess X]]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/51035.html Philamuseum.org]&lt;/ref&gt; by the Romanian modernist sculptor [[Constantin Brâncuși]]. He created a scandal in the Salon in 1919 when he represented or caricatured  [[Princess Marie Bonaparte]] as a large gleaming bronze phallus. This phallus likely symbolizes Bonaparte's obsession with the penis and her lifelong quest to achieve vaginal orgasm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Mary Roach]] | title=[[Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex]] | publisher=W. W. Norton and Co, New York (2008)}} page 66f, page 73&lt;/ref&gt;

The rules and regulations concerning '''prisoners of war in Islam''' are covered in manuals of [[Fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]],  based upon [[Islam]]ic teachings, in both the [[Qur'an]] and [[hadith]].

The historical legal principles governing the treatment of [[prisoners of war]], in [[shar'iah]], Islamic law, (in the traditional [[madhabs]] schools of Islamic jurisprudence), was then a significant improvement{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} over the pre-existing norms of society during [[Muhammad]]'s time (see [[Early reforms under Islam]]). Men, women, and children may all be taken as prisoners of war under traditional interpretations of Islamic law. Generally, a prisoner of war could be, at the discretion of the military leader, freed, ransomed, exchanged for Muslim prisoners, or kept in bondage.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tafsir]] of the [[Qur'an]] by [[Ibn Kathir]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20050115105038/http://users.mo-net.com/mcruzan/pows_02.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ahkaam al-Sijn wa’l-Sujana’ wa Mu’aamalat al-Sujana’ fi’l-Islam of the [[Hadith]] by Hasan Abi’l-Ghuddah [http://islamqa.info/en/ref/13241]&lt;/ref&gt; In earlier times, the ransom sometimes took an educational dimension, where a literate prisoner of war could secure his or her freedom by teaching ten Muslims to read and write.&lt;ref&gt;Shirazi, Imam Muhammad. ''The Prophet Muhammad - A Mercy to the World''.

During his life, Muhammad made it the responsibility of the Islamic government to provide food and clothing, on a reasonable basis, to captives, regardless of their religion.{{additional citation|date=June 2017}} If the prisoners were in the custody of a person, then the responsibility was on the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Maududi (1967), ''Introduction of Ad-Dahr'', "Period of revelation", p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;{{additional citation|date=June 2017}}

Historically, Muslims routinely captured large number of prisoners. Aside from those who converted to Islam, most were ransomed or enslaved.&lt;ref&gt;(Crone (2004), pp. 371-72)&lt;/ref&gt; Pasquier writes,
{{quote|It was the custom to enslave prisoners of war and the Islamic state would have put itself at a grave disadvantage vis-a-vis its enemies had it not reciprocated to some extent. By guaranteeing them [male POWs] humane treatment, and various possibilities of subsequently releasing themselves, it ensured that a good number of combatants in the opposing armies preferred captivity at the hands of Muslims to death on the field of battle.&lt;ref&gt;Roger DuPasquier. Unveiling Islam. Islamic Texts Society, 1992, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to accounts written by [[Muhammad]]'s followers, after the [[Battle of Badr]], some prisoners were executed for their earlier crimes in Mecca,{{additional citation|date=June 2017}} but the rest were given options: They could convert to Islam and thus win their freedom; they could pay ransom and win their freedom; they could teach 10 Muslims to read and write and thus win their freedom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.al-islam.org/lifeprophet/14.htm The Life of Muhammad The Prophet&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

During his rule, [[Caliph]] [[Umar]] made it illegal to separate related prisoners of war from each other, after a captive complained to him for being separated from her daughter.&lt;ref name="Naqvi"&gt;Naqvi (2000), pg. 456&lt;/ref&gt;{{additional citation|date=June 2017}}

These principles were also honoured during the [[Crusades]], as exemplified by sultans such as [[Saladin]]{{additional citation|date=June 2017}} and [[al-Kamil]]. For example, after al-Kamil defeated the [[Franks]] during the [[Crusades]], Oliverus Scholasticus praised the Islamic [[laws of war]], commenting on how al-Kamil supplied the defeated Frankish army with food:&lt;ref name=Weeramantry&gt;{{Cite book|title=Justice Without Frontiers|first=Christopher G.|last=Judge Weeramantry |year=1997 |publisher=[[Brill Publishers]] |isbn=90-411-0241-8 |page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{additional citation|date=June 2017}}

{{quote|Who could doubt that such goodness, friendship and charity come from God? Men whose parents, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, had died in agony at our hands, whose lands we took, whom we drove naked from their homes, revived us with their own food when we were dying of hunger and showered us with kindness even when we were in their power."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Justice Without Frontiers |first=Christopher G. |last=Judge Weeramantry |year=1997 |publisher=[[Brill Publishers]] |isbn=90-411-0241-8|pages=136–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Treatment of prisoners==
Upon capture, the prisoners must be guarded and not ill-treated.&lt;ref name = Nigosian&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic law holds that the prisoners must be fed and clothed, either by the Islamic government or by the individual who has custody of the prisoner. This position is supported by the verse {{quran-usc-range|76|8}} of the [[Quran]]. The prisoners must be fed in a dignified manner, and must not be forced to beg for their subsistence.&lt;ref&gt;Maududi (1967), introduction of [[Ad-Dahr]], "Period of revelation", pg. 159&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad's early followers also considered it a principle to not separate prisoners from their relatives.&lt;ref name="Naqvi" /&gt;

After the fighting is over, prisoners are to be released, with some prospect of survival, or ransomed. The freeing or ransoming of prisoners by Muslims themselves is highly recommended as a charitable act.&lt;ref name = Nigosian/&gt; The Qur'an also urges kindness to captives&lt;ref&gt;({{Quran-usc|4|36}}, {{Quran-usc|9|60}}, {{Quran-usc|24|58}})&lt;/ref&gt; and recommends, their liberation by purchase or [[manumission]]. The freeing of captives is recommended both for the expiation of sins&lt;ref&gt;({{Quran-usc|4|92}}, {{Quran-usc|5|92}}, {{Quran-usc|58|3}})&lt;/ref&gt; and as an act of simple benevolence.&lt;ref&gt;({{Quran-usc|2|177}}, {{Quran-usc|24|33}}, {{Quran-usc|90|13}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 1990, page 6. All Qur'anic citations are his.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women and children===
Some Muslim scholars claim that women and children prisoners of war cannot be killed under any circumstances, regardless of their faith,&lt;ref&gt;(Patricia Crone. God’s Rule: Government and Islam. New York: Columbia University Press, 2004, pp. 371-72)&lt;/ref&gt; but that they may be enslaved, freed or ransomed. Women who are neither freed nor ransomed by their people were to be kept in bondage and referred to as ''[[ma malakat aymanukum]]'' (slaves).

[[Abubakar Shekau]], the leader of [[Boko Haram]], a Nigerian extremist group, said in an interview "I shall capture people and make them slaves" when claiming responsibility for the [[2014 Chibok kidnapping]].&lt;ref name=CNNEssenceTerror&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/06/world/africa/nigeria-boko-haram-analysis/ |publisher=CNN |title=Boko Haram: The essence of terror |last=Lister |first=Tim |date=6 May 2014 |accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shekau has justified his actions by appealing to the [[Quran]] saying "[w]hat we are doing is an order from Allah, and all that we are doing is in the Book of Allah that we follow".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ferran|first1=Lee|title=Boko Haram: Kidnappers, Slave-Owners, Terrorists, Killers|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/boko-haram-kidnappers-slave-owners-terrorists-killers/story?id=23598347|publisher=ABC News|date=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2014, in its digital magazine ''[[Dabiq (magazine)|Dabiq]]'', ISIL explicitly claimed religious justification for enslaving [[Yazidis|Yazidi]] women.

===Men===
One traditional opinion holds that executing prisoners of war is strictly forbidden; this is the most-widely accepted view, and one upheld by the [[Hanafi]] [[madh'hab|madhab]].&lt;ref name="ElFadl"&gt;El Fadl (2003), pg. 115&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=June 2017}}

However, the opinion of the [[Maliki]], [[Shafi'i]], [[Hanbali]] and [[Jafari]] madhabs is that adult male prisoners of war may be executed.&lt;ref&gt;El Fadl (2003), pg. 116&lt;/ref&gt; The decision for an execution is to be made by the Muslim leader. This opinion was also upheld by the Muslim judge, [[Sa'id bin Jubair]] (665-714 AD) and [[Abu Yusuf]], a classical jurist from the [[Hanafi]] school of jurisprudence.&lt;ref name="AbuYusuf" /&gt; El Fadl argues the reason Muslim jurists adopted this position was largely because it was consistent with the war practices of the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="ElFadl" /&gt; [[Muhammad Hamidullah]], while reminding that execution in such cases was exceptional and depending on many factors, further precises that [[beheading]] was discouraged: "[[ijma|unanimity]] was reached among the [[Sahaba|Companions]] of the Prophet not to behead prisoners of war. In short, capital punishment for prisoners of war is only permissible in extreme cases of necessity and in the higher interests of the State."&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad Hamidullah, ''Muslim Conduct of State'', Muhammad Ashraf (1945), pp. 208-209&lt;/ref&gt;

Most contemporary Muslim scholars prohibit altogether the killing of prisoners and hold that this was the policy practiced by [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref&gt;Hashmi (2003), pg. 145&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=June 2017}} The 20th-century Muslim scholar, [[Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi]] states that no prisoner should be "put to the sword" in accordance with a [[hadith|saying]]{{which|date=June 2017}} of [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref name="Maududi 1998, p. 34"&gt;Maududi (1998), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abdullah Yusuf Ali|Yusuf Ali]], another 20th-century [[Muslim]] scholar, while commenting on verse {{Quran-usc|9|6}}, writes,

{{quote|Even those the [[Persecution of Muslims|enemies of Islam]], actively fighting against Islam, there may be individuals who may be in a position to require protection. Full asylum is to be given to them, and opportunities provided for hearing the Word of Allah...If they do not see their way to accept Islam, they will require double protection: (1) from the Islamic forces openly fighting against their people, and (2) from their own people, as they detached themselves from them. Both kinds of protection should be ensured for them, and they should be safely escorted to a place where they can be safe.&lt;ref&gt;Ali (1991), p. 498&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Maududi further states that Islam forbids torturing, especially by fire, and quotes Muhammad as saying, "Punishment by fire does not behoove anyone except the Master of the Fire [God]."&lt;ref name="Maududi 1998, p. 34"/&gt;

Quoting from the sources, Muhammad Munir, from the Department of Law  of the [[International Islamic University, Islamabad|International Islamic University]], [[Pakistan]], says that early religious authorities standing against the execution of POWs ''at all'' include [[Ali ibn Abi Talib|'Ali b. Abi Tãlib]], [[Hasan of Basra|Al-Hasan b. al-Hasan al-Basrl]]  (d. 110/728), [[Hammad ibn Salamah|Hammãd b. Abi Sulaymän]] (d. 120/737), [[Ibn Sirin|Muhammad b. Sirin]]  (d. 110/728), [[Mujahid ibn Jabr|Mujãhid b. Jabr]] (d. 103/721),  [[Ibn Jurayj|'Abd al-Mãlik b. 'Abd al-'Azïz b. Jurayj]] (d. 150/767), [[Ata ibn Abi Rabah|'Atâ' b. Abi Rabãh]]  (d. 114/732) and Abû  'Ubayd  ibn Sallãm,&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad Munir, "Debates on the Rights of Prisoners of War in Islamic Law" in ''Islamic Studies'',  Vol. 49, No. 4 (Winter 2010), p. 469&lt;/ref&gt; while later scholars favouring the same opinion include [[Qurtubi|Muhammad b. Ahmad al-Qurtubl]] (d. 671/1272), who shares {{Quran-usc|47|4}} to vindicate the sheer impossibility of execution if we follow the letter of the Qur'an.&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad Munir, "Debates on the Rights of Prisoners of War in Islamic Law" in ''Islamic Studies'',  Vol. 49, No. 4 (Winter 2010), p. 473&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn Rushd]] (d. 594/1198)  is also quoted: "[A] number of jurists did not permit executing the prisoners  of war. Al-Hasan b. Muhammad al-Tamïmï (d. 656/1258) stated consensus ([[ijma]]) of the [[Sahaba|Companions]] on this view."&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad Munir, "Debates on the Rights of Prisoners of War in Islamic Law" in ''Islamic Studies'',  Vol. 49, No. 4 (Winter 2010), p. 470&lt;/ref&gt; He further shows that the rare executions were more due to the crimes they committed before the captivity than their status of POW itself. A famous case being  [[Abdullah ibn Khatal|'Abd Allah b. Khatal]]. One of the few persons who weren't granted immunity at the [[conquest of Mecca]]. A group of people which "could have been punished by  a tribunal should there have been one at the time”. But he was the only one executed for what we would today call [[high treason]] (as he collected tax money from Muslims before defecting and fighting them).&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad Munir, "Debates on the Rights of Prisoners of War in Islamic Law" in ''Islamic Studies'',  Vol. 49, No. 4 (Winter 2010), p. 472&lt;/ref&gt; More generically, he also shows that "in the first one hundred years of Islamic military history, that is, from the time of the Prophet (peace be upon him) till the time of Caliph [[Umar II|'Umar b. 'Abdul 'Aziz]], there were only six or seven such cases, even if we were to accept the spurious reports of such executions."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10907">'''Process safety management''' is a regulation promulgated by the [[U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA). A process is any activity or combination of activities including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling or the on-site movement of highly hazardous chemicals (HHCs) as defined by OSHA and the [[Environmental Protection Agency]].
[[File:29 CFR 1910.119 14 Elements of Process Safety Management.png|thumb|380x380px|Fourteen elements of OSHA's process safety management program]]
==Definition==

Process safety management is an analytical tool focused on preventing releases of any substance defined as a "highly hazardous chemical" by the EPA or OSHA. Process Safety Management (PSM) refers to a set of interrelated approaches to managing hazards associated with the process industries and is intended to reduce the frequency and severity of incidents resulting from releases of chemicals and other energy sources (US OSHA 1993). These standards are composed of organizational and operational procedures, design guidance, audit programs, and a host of other methods.

==Elements of process safety management==
The process safety management program is divided into 14 elements. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 1910.119 define all 14 elements of the process safety management plan. 

* Process Safety Information
* Process Hazard Analysis
* Operating Procedures
* Training
* Contractors
* Mechanical Integrity
* Hot Work
* Management of Change
* Incident Investigation
* Compliance Audits
* Trade Secrets
* Employee Participation
* [[Pre-start-up audit|Pre-startup Safety Review]]
* Emergency Planning and Response

All of those elements mentioned above are interlinked and interdependent. There is a tremendous interdependency of the various elements of PSM. All elements are related and are necessary to make up the entire PSM picture. Every element either contributes information to other elements for the completion or utilizes information from other elements in order to be completed.

===Process safety information===
Process safety information (PSI) might be considered the keystone of a PSM Program in that it tells you what you are dealing with from both the equipment and the process standpoint. 
In order to be in compliance with the OSHA PSM regulations the process safety information should include information pertaining to the hazards of the highly hazardous chemicals used or produced by the process, information pertaining to the technology of the process and information pertaining to the equipment in the process.{{ref label|EPA|5|^}}

Information pertaining to the hazards of the highly hazardous chemicals in the process should consist of at least the following:
* Toxicity information
* Permissible exposure limit
* Physical data
* Reactivity data
* Corrosivity data
* Thermal and chemical stability data
* Hazardous effects of inadvertent mixing of different materials that could foreseeably occur.
Information pertaining to the technology of the process should include at least the following:
* A block flow diagram or simplified process flow diagram
* Process chemistry and its properties
* Maximum intended inventory
* Safety upper and lower limits for such items as temperatures, pressures, flows or compositions
* An evaluation of the consequences of deviations, including those affecting the safety and health of the employees

Information pertaining to the equipment in the process should include the following:
* Materials of construction
* Piping and instrument diagram (P&amp;IDs)
* Electrical classification
* Relief system design and design basis
* Ventilation system design
* Design codes and standards employed
* Material and energy balances for processes built after May 26, 1992
* Safety system (for example, interlocks, detection or suppression systems)

The employer should document that equipment complies with recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices (RAGAGEP).

For existing equipment designed and constructed in accordance with codes, standards or practices that are no longer in general use, the employer should determine and document that the equipment is designed, maintained, inspected, tested and operating in a safe manner.

==Compliance==
A process includes any group of vessels which are interconnected or separate and contain Highly Hazardous Chemicals (HHCs) which could be involved in a potential release. A process safety incident is the "Unexpected release of [[Toxicity|toxic]], [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactive]], or [[flammability|flammable]] liquids and gases in processes involving highly [[hazardous material|hazardous chemicals]]. Incidents continue to occur in various industries that use highly hazardous chemicals which exhibit toxic, reactive, flammable, or even [[explosive]] properties, or may exhibit a combination of these properties. Regardless of the industry that uses these highly hazardous chemicals, there is a potential for an [[Accidental release source terms|accidental release]] any time they are not properly controlled. This, in turn, creates the possibility of disaster. To help assure safe and healthy workplaces, OSHA has issued the Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals regulation (Title 29 of [[Code of Federal Regulations|CFR]] Section 1910.119)&lt;ref name=OSHAPSM&gt;{{cite web|title=Occupational Safety and Health Standards 29 CFR 1910.119|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=9760|work=United States Department of Labor Occupational Safety and Health Administration|publisher=OSHA|accessdate=22 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which contains requirements for the management of hazards associated with processes using highly hazardous chemicals."&lt;ref name=OSHASummary&gt;{{cite web|title=Process Safety Management|url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/processsafetymanagement/|work=OSHA.gov|publisher=United States Department of Labor Occupational Safety and Health Administration|accessdate=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any facility that stores or uses a defined "highly hazardous chemical" must comply with OSHA's process safety management (PSM) regulations as well as the quite similar [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) Risk management program (RMP) regulations (Title 40 CFR Part 68). The EPA has published a model RMP plan for an ammonia refrigeration facility&lt;ref name=RMPModel&gt;{{cite web|title=MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM AND PLAN FOR  AMMONIA REFRIGERATION|url=http://www.epa.gov/ttn/oarpg/t3/memoranda/ammon.pdf|work=Environmental Protection Agency|publisher=Science Applications International Corporation|accessdate=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which provides excellent guidance on how to comply with either OSHA's PSM regulations or the EPA's RMP regulations.

The Center for Chemical Process Safety (CCPS) of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers ([[AIChE]]) has published a widely used book that explains various methods for identifying hazards in industrial facilities and quantifying their potential severity.&lt;ref name="(CCPS)2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Center for Chemical Process Safety (CCPS)|title=Guidelines for Hazard Evaluation Procedures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fw5vuel7EA0C|date=23 September 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-21166-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Appendix D of the OSHA's PSM regulations endorses the use of the methods explained in that book. AIChE publishes additional guidelines for process safety documentation,&lt;ref name="PSD1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

In Australia, consideration of process safety management is a key consideration for the management of [[Major hazard facility|major hazard facilities]] (MHFs).

{{Distinguish|Psychopathy}}
'''Psychopathology''' is the scientific study of [[mental disorder]]s, including efforts to understand their genetic, [[biological]], [[psychological]], and social [[Causality|causes]]; develop classification schemes ([[nosology]]) which can improve treatment planning and treatment outcomes; understand the course of psychiatric illnesses across all stages of [[developmental psychopathology|development]]; more fully understand the manifestations of mental disorders;{{efn|For example, schizophrenia usually causes [[amotivation]], which, along with other symptoms and functional limitations, contributes to some patients becoming homeless, which in turn renders them more vulnerable to physical and sexual assault and other crimes. Amotivation is a ''symptom'', whereas ''homelessness ''and ''victimization ''are '''manifestations '''(consequences) of the mental illness.}} and investigate potentially effective [[Therapy|treatments]].{{efn|To provide a richer understanding of what is meant by ''psychopathology'', particularly the [[phenomenology (psychology)|phenomonelogy]] (internal experience) of those afflicted with a mental disorder, consider the word's [[etymology]]. ''Psychopathology'' is derived from three roots: (1) ''psyche'' (noun), from [[Ancient Greek]] ψυχή (''psukhē'', "soul, breath, mind, life-breath, spirit"). (2) ''pathos'' (noun), from Ancient Greek πάθος, which is from πάσχω (''paskhō'', "I feel, suffer"), and in this context means a condition or state in which the individual experiences pain, loss, anguish, hurt, and woe. (3) ''-ology'' (suffix), from Ancient Greek -λογία ''-logia'', ''the study of'' (see [[pathology]]).

Thus, ''psychopathology'' is the scientific study of [[abnormal psychology]], i.e., abnormal perceptions, thoughts, beliefs, emotions, and behavior that lead to distress, pain and misery, even to the point that an afflicted person feels as if their very "life-breath" (soul) is being damaged or sucked out.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/153923|title=Oxford English Dictionary|last=|first=|work=OED Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2007|isbn=|edition=3rd|location=Oxford, England, UK|pages=|quote='''psychopathology''', ''n.'' - 1. The study of pathological mental and behavioural processes ...; 2.  Abnormal psychology; an abnormal psychological process or state.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least conceptually,{{efn|The prepositional phrase, "At least conceptually" refers to the fact that the two disciplines--pathology and psychopathology--have largely developed independent of each other.}} psychopathology is a subset of [[pathology]], which is the "... scientific study of the nature of disease and its causes, processes, development, and consequences."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.thefreedictionary.com/pathology|title=American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|last=|first=|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year=2016|isbn=|edition=6th|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Early explanations for mental illnesses were influenced by religious belief and [[superstition]]. Psychological conditions that are now classified as mental disorders were initially attributed to possessions by evil spirits, demons, and the devil. This idea was widely accepted up until the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Individuals who suffered from these so-called "possessions" were tortured as treatment.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Doctors used this technique in hoping to bring their patients back to sanity. Those who failed to return to sanity after torture were executed.&lt;ref name="AllPsych"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Heffner|first1=Christopher | name-list-format = vanc |title=Chapter 9: Section 1: Psychopathology|url=http://allpsych.com/psychology101/psychopathology/#.VOUVvvnF-VJ|website=AllPsych.com|publisher=AllPsych|access-date=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=May 2016}}

The Greek physician [[Hippocrates]] was one of the first to reject the idea that mental disorders were caused by possession of demons or the devil. He firmly believed the symptoms of mental disorders were due to diseases originating in the brain. Hippocrates suspected that these states of insanity were due to imbalances of fluids in the body. He identified these fluids to be four in particular: blood, black bile, yellow bile, and phlegm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hamshar|first1=Mercedes | name-list-format = vanc |title=The History of Psychopathology|url=https://suite.io/mercedes-hamshar/43nd21f|website=Suite|access-date=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, not far from Hippocrates, the philosopher [[Plato]] would come to argue the mind, body, and spirit worked as a unit. Any imbalance brought to these compositions of the individual could bring distress or lack of harmony within the individual. This philosophical idea would remain in perspective{{vague|date=May 2016}} until the seventeenth century.&lt;ref name="AllPsych"/&gt;

In the eighteenth century's Romantic Movement, the idea that healthy parent-child relationships provided sanity became a prominent idea. Philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] introduced the notion that trauma in childhood could have negative implications later in adulthood.&lt;ref name="AllPsych"/&gt;

In the nineteenth century, greatly influenced by Rousseau's ideas and philosophy, Austrian psychoanalyst [[Sigmund Freud]] would bring about psychotherapy and become the father of psychoanalysis, a clinical method for treating psychopathology through dialogue between a patient and a psychoanalyst. Talking therapy would originate from his ideas on the individual's experiences and the natural human efforts to make sense of the world and life.&lt;ref name="AllPsych"/&gt;

==As the study of psychiatric disorders==

The scientific discipline of psychopathology was founded by [[Karl Jaspers]] in 1913. It was referred to as "static understanding" and its purpose was to graphically recreate the "mental phenomenon" experienced by the client.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marlet JJ | title = Development of cranial hyperostosis. A radiological approach to a process | journal = Radiologia Clinica Et Biologica | volume = 43 | issue = 6 | pages = 473–82 | date = 2015 | pmc = 4421897 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of psychopathology is interdisciplinary, with contributions coming from clinical, social, and developmental psychology, as well as neuropsychology and other psychology subdisciplines; psychiatry; neuroscience generally; criminology; social work; sociology; epidemiology; statistics; and more.&lt;ref name="A TEXT BOOK OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shah|first1=Syed Ahmad |last2=Mushtaq|first2=Shahnawaz |last3=Naseer|first3=Miss Naureen |last4=Ahmad|first4=Aijaz |last5=Sharma|first5=Gargi|last6=Kovur|first6=Harpreet | name-list-format = vanc | title = A text book of psycholopathology |date=2017|publisher=RED'SHINE Publication. Pvt. Ltd |isbn=9789386483201 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IIY4DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; Practitioners in clinical and academic fields are referred to as psychopathologists.

How do scientists (and people in general) distinguish between ''unusual or odd behavior'' on one hand, and a ''mental disorder'' on the other?  One strategy is to assess a person along four dimensions: ''deviance, distress, dysfunction. and danger'', known collectively as the Four D's.

===The four Ds===
A description of the four Ds when defining abnormality:

#'''[[Deviance (sociology)|Deviance]]''': this term describes the idea that specific thoughts, behaviours and emotions are considered deviant when they are unacceptable or not common in society. Clinicians must, however, remember that minority groups are not always deemed deviant just because they may not have anything in common with other groups. Therefore, we define an individual's actions as deviant or abnormal when their behaviour is deemed unacceptable by the culture they belong to. However, many disorders have a relation between patterns of deviance and therefore need to be evaluated in a differential diagnostic model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Davis T | title=Conceptualizing Psychiatric Disorders Using "Four D’s" of Diagnoses|journal=The Internet Journal of Psychiatry|date=2009|volume=1|issue=1|page=1|url=https://print.ispub.com/api/0/ispub-article/5049|access-date=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''[[Distress (medicine)|Distress]]''': this term accounts for negative feelings by the individual with the disorder. They may feel deeply troubled and affected by their illness. Behaviors and feelings that cause distress to the individual or to others around him or her are considered abnormal, if the condition is upsetting to the person experiencing it. Distress is related to dysfunction by being a useful asset in accurately perceiving dysfunction in an individual’s life. These two are not always related because an individual can be highly dysfunctional and at the same time experiencing minimal stress. One should know the important characteristic of distress is not involved with dysfunction, but rather the limit to which an individual is stressed by an issue.&lt;ref name="print.ispub.com"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davis|first1=T|title=Conceptualizing Psychiatric Disorders Using "Four D’s" of Diagnoses|journal=The Internet Journal of Psychiatry|date=2009|volume=1|issue=1|page=2|url=https://print.ispub.com/api/0/ispub-article/5049|access-date=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''[[Abnormality (behavior)|Dysfunction]]''': this term involves maladaptive behaviour that impairs the individual's ability to perform normal daily functions, such as getting ready for work in the morning, or driving a car. This maladaptive behaviour has to be a problem large enough to be considered a diagnosis. It's highly noted to look for dysfunction across an individual's life experience because there is a chance the dysfunction may appear in clear observable view and in places where it is less likely to appear.&lt;ref name="print.ispub.com" /&gt; Such maladaptive behaviours prevent the individual from living a normal, healthy lifestyle. However, dysfunctional behaviour is not always caused by a disorder; it may be voluntary, such as engaging in a hunger strike.
#'''[[Violence|Danger]]''': this term involves dangerous or violent behaviour directed at the individual, or others in the environment. The two important characteristics of danger is, danger to self and danger to others. When diagnosing, there is a large vulnerability of danger in which there is some danger in each diagnosis and within these diagnoses there is a continuum of severity.&lt;ref name="print.ispub.com" /&gt; An example of dangerous behaviour that may suggest a psychological disorder is engaging in suicidal activity. Behaviors and feelings that are potentially harmful to an individual or the individuals around them are seen as abnormal.

===The p factor===
{{refimprove section|date=April 2018}}
Instead of conceptualizing psychopathology as consisting of several discrete categories of mental disorders, groups of psychological and psychiatric scientists have proposed a "general psychopathology" construct, named the p-factor, because of its conceptual similarity with the [[Cognitive Abilities Test|g factor of general intelligence]]. Although researchers initially conceived a tripartite (three factor) explanation for psychopathology generally, subsequent study provided more evidence for a unitary, factor that is sequentially comorbid, recurrent/chronic, and exists on a continuum of severity and chronicity. Thus, the p factor is a dimensional, as opposed to a categorical, construct.&lt;ref name="Caspi2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Caspi A, Houts RM, Belsky DW, Goldman-Mellor SJ, Harrington H, Israel S, Meier MH, Ramrakha S, Shalev I, Poulton R, Moffitt TE | display-authors = 6 | title = The p Factor: One General Psychopathology Factor in the Structure of Psychiatric Disorders? | journal = Clinical Psychological Science | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 119–137 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 25360393 | pmc = 4209412 | doi = 10.1177/2167702613497473 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Higher scores on the p factor dimension have been found to be correlated with higher levels of functional impairment, greater incidence of problems in developmental history, and more diminished early-life brain function. In addition, those with higher levels of the p factor are more likely to have inherited a [[genetic predisposition]] to mental illness. The existence of the p factor may explain why it has been "... challenging to find causes, consequences, biomarkers, and treatments with specificity to individual mental disorders."&lt;ref name=Caspi2014 /&gt;

The p factor has been likened to the [[Cognitive Abilities Test|g factor of general intelligence]], which is also a dimensional system by which overall cognitive ability can be defined. As psychopathology has typically been studied and implemented as a categorical system, like the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]] system developed for clinicians, the dimensional system of the p factor provides an alternative conceptualization of mental disorders that might improve our understanding of psychopathology in general; lead to more precise diagnoses; and facilitate more effective treatment approaches.
 
[[Benjamin Lahey]] and colleagues first proposed a general psychopathology factor in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lahey BB, Applegate B, Hakes JK, Zald DH, Hariri AR, Rathouz PJ | title = Is there a general factor of prevalent psychopathology during adulthood? | journal = Journal of Abnormal Psychology | volume = 121 | issue = 4 | pages = 971–7 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 22845652 | pmc = 4134439 | doi = 10.1037/a0028355 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As mental symptoms==
The term ''psychopathology'' may also be used to denote behaviors or experiences which are indicative of mental illness, even if they do not constitute a formal diagnosis. For example, the presence of a [[hallucination]] may be considered as a psychopathological sign, even if there are not enough symptoms present to fulfill the criteria for one of the disorders listed in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]] or [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems|ICD]].

In a more general sense, any behaviour or experience which causes impairment, distress or [[disability]], particularly if it is thought to arise from a functional breakdown in either the [[cognitive]] or [[neurocognitive]] systems in the brain, may be classified as psychopathology. It remains unclear how strong the distinction between maladaptive traits and mental disorders actually is,&lt;ref name="NeuroticismMA"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jeronimus BF, Kotov R, Riese H, Ormel J | title = Neuroticism's prospective association with mental disorders halves after adjustment for baseline symptoms and psychiatric history, but the adjusted association hardly decays with time: a meta-analysis on 59 longitudinal/prospective studies with 443 313 participants | journal = Psychological Medicine | volume = 46 | issue = 14 | pages = 2883–2906 | date = October 2016 | pmid = 27523506 | doi = 10.1017/S0033291716001653 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ormel2014"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors = Ormel J, Laceulle OM, Jeronimus BF |year=2014|title= Why Personality and Psychopathology Are Correlated: A Developmental Perspective Is a First Step but More Is Needed|journal= European Journal of Personality|volume=28|issue=4|pages=396–98|doi=10.1002/per.1971|url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/per.1971/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''e.g.'' [[neuroticism]] is often described as the personal level of minor psychiatric symptoms.&lt;ref name="Ormel2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ormel J, Jeronimus BF, Kotov R, Riese H, Bos EH, Hankin B, Rosmalen JG, Oldehinkel AJ | title = Neuroticism and common mental disorders: meaning and utility of a complex relationship | journal = Clinical Psychology Review | volume = 33 | issue = 5 | pages = 686–697 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23702592 | pmc = 4382368 | doi = 10.1016/j.cpr.2013.04.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders''==
{{Main|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders}}
The ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM) is an guideline for the diagnosis and understanding of mental disorders. It serves as reference for a range of professionals in medicine and mental health in the United States particularly. These professionals include psychologists, counselors, physicians, social workers, psychiatric nurses and nurse practitioners, marriage and family therapists, and more.&lt;ref name=APA&gt;{{cite web|title=DSM|url=http://www.psychiatry.org/practice/dsm|website=American Psychiatric Association|access-date=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of mental disorders classified within the DSM include:
* '''[[Major depressive disorder]]''' is a [[mood disorder]] defined by symptoms of loss of motivation, decreased mood, lack of energy and thoughts of suicide.
* '''[[Bipolar disorder]]s''' are mood disorders characterized by depressive and manic episodes of varying lengths and degrees.
* '''[[Dysthymia]]''' is a mood disorder similar to depression. Characterized by a persistent low mood, dysthymia is a less debilitating form of depression with no break in ordinary functioning.
* '''[[Schizophrenia]]''' is characterized by altered perception of reality, including delusional thoughts, hallucinations, and disorganized speech and behaviour. Most cases arise in patients in their late teens or early adulthood, but can also appear later on in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding Schizophrenia|url=http://www.helpguide.org/articles/schizophrenia/schizophrenia-signs-types-and-causes.htm|website=Helpguide.org|publisher=HelpGuide.org|access-date=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Borderline personality disorder]]''' occurs in early adulthood for most patients; specific symptoms include patterns of unstable and intense relationships, chronic feelings of emptiness, emotional instability, paranoid thoughts, intense episodes of anger, and suicidal behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Borderline Personality Disorder Symptoms|url=http://psychcentral.com/disorders/borderline-personality-disorder-symptoms/|website=PsychCentral|access-date=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Bulimia nervosa]]''' "binge and purge", an eating disorder specified as reoccurring episodes of uncontrollable binge eating followed by a need to vomit, take laxatives, or exercise excessively. Usually begins occurring at adolescence but most individuals do not seek help until later in life when it can be harder to change their eating habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bulimia Nervosa Symptoms|url=http://psychcentral.com/disorders/bulimia-bulimia-nervosa-symptoms/|website=PsychCentral|access-date=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Phobias]]''' Found in people of all ages. Characterized by an abnormal response to fear or danger. Persons diagnosed with Phobias suffer from feelings of terror and  uncontrollable fear, exaggerated reactions to danger that in reality is not life-threatening, and is usually accompanied by physical reactions related to extreme fear: panic, rapid heartbeat, and/or shortened breathing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Phobias|url=http://www.psychiatry.org/phobias|website=American Psychiatric Association|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|access-date=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Pyromania]]''' this disorder is indicated by fascination, curiosity, or attraction to purposely setting things on fire. Pyromaniacs find pleasure and/or relief by watching things burn. Can occur due to delusional thinking, impaired judgement due to other mental disorders, or simply as aggressive behavior to express anger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pyromania Symptoms|url=http://psychcentral.com/disorders/pyromania-symptoms/|website=PsychCentral.com|publisher=PsychCentral|access-date=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==DSM/RDoc debate==

Some scholars have argued that field should switch from the DSM categorical approach of mental disorders to the [[Research Domain Criteria]] (RDoC) dimensional approach of mental disorders, although the consensus at present is to retain DSM for treatment, insurance, and related purposes, while emphasizing RDoC conceptualizations for planning and funding psychiatric research.&lt;ref name="pmid24135697"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Casey BJ, Craddock N, Cuthbert BN, Hyman SE, Lee FS, Ressler KJ | title = DSM-5 and RDoC: progress in psychiatry research? | journal = Nature Reviews.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="988">'''Salt equivalent''' is usually quoted on food [[nutrition]] information tables on food labels, and is a different way of defining sodium intake, noting that salt is chemically [[sodium chloride]].

To convert from sodium to the approximate salt equivalent, multiply sodium content by 2.5:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{m_\mathrm{NaCl}}{m_\mathrm{Na}} = \frac{m_\mathrm{Na}+m_\mathrm{Cl}}{m_\mathrm{Na}} \approx \frac{23\mathrm{u} + 35.5\mathrm{u}}{23\mathrm{u}} = \frac{58.5}{23} \approx 2.5&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13276">'''Saponification''' is a process that involves conversion of fat or oil into [[soap]] and alcohol by the action of heat in the presence of aqueous alkali (e.g. [[Sodium_hydroxide|NaOH]]). Soaps are salts of fatty acids whereas fatty acids are saturated monocarboxylic acids that have long carbon chains (at least 10) e.g. [[Palmitic_acid|CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;COOH]].

== Saponification of fats ==
[[Vegetable oil]]s and [[animal fat]]s are the traditional materials that are saponified.  These greasy materials, triesters called [[triglyceride]]s,  are mixtures derived from diverse fatty acids. Triglycerides can be converted to soap in either a one- or a two-step process.  In the traditional one-step process, the triglyceride is treated with a strong base (e.g. [[lye]]), which cleaves to the ester bond, releasing [[fatty acid]] salts (soaps) and [[glycerol]].  This process is also the main industrial method for producing glycerol.  In some soap-making, the glycerol is left in the soap.  If necessary, soaps may be [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitated]] by [[salting out|salting it out]] with [[sodium chloride]]. 
[[Image:stearin.png|thumb|250px|Skeletal formula of stearin, a triglyceride that is converted by saponification with sodium hydroxide into glycerol and soap.]]

Fat in a [[Dead body|corpse]] converts into [[adipocere]], often called "grave wax". This process is more common where the amount of [[adipose tissue|fatty tissue]] is high and the agents of [[decomposition]] are absent or only minutely present.

===Saponification value===
The [[saponification value]] is the amount of base required to saponify a fat sample.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quality Laboratory Oil Examination Procedures and Practices|url=http://www.aocs.org/index.cfm|publisher=American Oil Chemists' Society|accessdate=17 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121225133305/http://www.aocs.org/index.cfm|archivedate=25 December 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Soap makers formulate their recipes with a small deficit of lye to account for the unknown deviation of saponification value between their oil batch and laboratory averages.

=== Mechanism of base hydrolysis ===
{{Main|ester}}
The hydroxide anion adds to (or "attacks") the carbonyl group of the ester.  The immediate product is called an [[orthoester]].

:[[File:Verseifungsreaktion 1.svg|280px|Saponification part I]]
Expulsion of the alkoxide generates a carboxylic acid:
:[[File:Verseifungsreaktion 2.svg|320px|Saponification part II]]
The alkoxide ion is a [[acid strength#Strong acids|strong base]] so that the proton is transferred from the carboxylic acid to the alkoxide ion creating an alcohol:
:[[File:Verseifungsreaktion 3.svg|360px|saponification part III]]

In a classic laboratory procedure, the triglyceride [[trimyristin]] is obtained by extracting it from [[nutmeg]] with [[diethyl ether]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=G. D. Beal|doi=10.15227/orgsyn.006.0100|url=http://www.orgsyn.org/demo.aspx?prep=CV1P0538|title=Trimyristin|journal=Organic Syntheses|volume=6|pages=100|year=1926}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saponification to the sodium soap of [[myristic acid]] takes place using NaOH in water. The acid itself can be obtained by adding dilute [[hydrochloric acid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=G. D. Beal|url=http://www.orgsyn.org/demo.aspx?prep=CV1P0379|doi=10.15227/orgsyn.006.0066|title=Myristic Acid|journal=Organic Syntheses|volume=6|pages=66|year=1926}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Saponification of fatty acids==
The reaction of fatty acids with base is the other main method of saponification.  In this case, the reaction involves neutralization of the [[carboxylic acid]].  The neutralization method is used to produce industrial soaps such as those derived from magnesium, the transition metals, and aluminium.  This method is ideal for producing soaps that are derived from a single fatty acid, which leads to soaps with predictable physical properties, as required by many engineering applications.

== Applications ==
=== Soft versus hard soap ===
Depending on the nature of the alkali used in their production, soaps have distinct properties. [[Sodium hydroxide]] (NaOH) gives "hard soap"; hard soaps can also be used in water containing Mg, Cl, and Ca salts.  By contrast, [[potassium]] soaps, (derived using [[Potassium_hydroxide|KOH]]) are soft soap. The fatty acid source also affects the soap's melting point. Most early hard soaps were manufactured using animal fats and KOH extracted from wood ash; these were broadly solid.  However, the majority of modern soaps are manufactured from polyunsaturated triglycerides such as vegetable oils. As in the triglycerides they are formed from&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/science/aqa/plantoilsanduses/vegoilsrev4.shtml|publisher=BBC |work=GCSE Bitesize|title= Double bonds and hydrogenation}}&lt;/ref&gt; the salts of these acids have weaker inter-molecular forces and thus lower melting points.

=== Lithium soaps ===
Lithium derivatives of [[Lithium_12-hydroxystearate|12-hydroxystearate]] and other fatty acids are important constituents of lubricating greases. In [[lithium-based grease]]s, lithium [[carboxylate]]s are thickeners.  "Complex soaps" are also common, these being combinations of metallic soaps, such as lithium and calcium soaps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|doi=10.1002/14356007.a15_423|chapter=Lubricants and Lubrication|title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|year=2003|last1=Bartels|first1 =Thorsten|last2=Bock|first2=Wolfgang|last3=Braun|first3=Jürgen|last4= Busch|first4=Christian|last5=Buss|first5= Wolfgang|last6= Dresel|first6= Wilfried|last7=Freiler|first7= Carmen|last8=Harperscheid|first8=Manfred|last9=Heckler|first9=Rolf-Peter|last10=Hörner|first10=Dietrich|last11=Kubicki|first11=Franz|last12= Lingg|first12=Georg|last13=Losch|first13 =Achim|last14= Luther|first14=Rolf|last15=Mang|first15=Theo|last16=Noll|first16=Siegfried|last17=Omeis|first17=Jürgen|isbn=3-527-30673-0|publisher= Wiley-VCH|location= Weinheim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fire extinguishers ===
Fires involving [[cooking fat]]s and oils (classified as [[Fire classes#Cooking oil|class K (US) or F (Australia/Europe/Asia)]]) burn hotter than most flammable liquids, rendering a standard [[Fire classes#Flammable liquid and gas|class B]] extinguisher ineffective. Flammable liquids have [[flash point]]s under 37 degrees Celsius (98.6 Fahrenheit).  Cooking oil is a combustible liquid, since it has a flash point over 37 degrees Celsius.  Such fires should be extinguished with a [[fire extinguisher#Wet chemical and water additives|wet chemical extinguisher]]. Extinguishers of this type are designed to extinguish cooking fats and oils through saponification. The extinguishing agent rapidly converts the burning substance to a non-combustible soap. This process is [[endothermic]], meaning that it absorbs [[thermal energy]] from its surroundings, which decreases the temperature of the surroundings, further inhibiting the fire.

== Oil paints ==
[[File:Detail of Madame X (Madame Pierre Gautreau), John Singer Sargent, 1884.jpg|thumb|Detail of Madame X (Madame Pierre Gautreau), John Singer Sargent, 1884, showing saponification in the black dress.]]
Saponification can occur in [[oil painting]]s over time, causing visible damage and deformation.  Oil paints are composed of pigment molecules suspended in an oil binding [[Drying oil|medium]]. Heavy metal salts are often used as pigment molecules, such as in [[lead white]], [[red lead]], and [[zinc white]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/view/10.1093/gao/9781884446054.001.0001/oao-9781884446054-e-7000067586|title=Pigment {{!}} Grove Art|doi=10.1093/gao/9781884446054.001.0001/oao-9781884446054-e-7000067586|access-date=2018-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If those heavy metal salts react with [[free fatty acid]]s in the oil medium, metal  soaps may form in a paint layer that can then migrate outward to the painting's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Silvia A. Centeno |author2= Dorothy Mahon|title=The Chemistry of Aging in Oil Paintings: Metal Soaps and Visual Changes|journal=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin|date=Summer 2009|publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]| jstor=40588562| url= http://metmuseum.org/art/metpublications/Scientific_Research_in_the_Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art_The_Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art_Bulletin_v_67_no_1_Summer_2009?Tag=Chemistry&amp;title=&amp;author=Centeno&amp;pt=0&amp;tc=0&amp;dept=0&amp;fmt=0# |volume=67|issue=1| pages=12–19|editor=Macro Leona }} See pages: 12–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saponification in oil paintings was described as early as 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fleury|first1=Paul|title=The Preparation and Uses of White Zinc Paints|date=1912|location=London|edition=1st|url=http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/paul-fleury/the-preparation-and-uses-of-white-zinc-paints-hci/page-11-the-preparation-and-uses-of-white-zinc-paints-hci.shtml|chapter=MANUFACTURE AND TREATMENTS OF WHITE ZINC |publisher=London, Scott, Greenwood &amp; son|quote="and although Petit declares this theory false, it is none the less on it and on its data that he bases his system of manufacture of hydrated white zinc, of which he is the inventor that is to say, the saponification of the oil, or the formation of metallic salts, dissolved therein"}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is believed to be widespread, having been observed in many works dating from the fifteenth through the twentieth centuries; works of different geographic origin; and works painted on various supports, such as canvas, paper, wood, and copper.  Chemical analysis may reveal saponification occurring in a painting’s deeper layers before any signs are visible on the surface, even in paintings centuries old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Silvia A. Centeno |author2= Dorothy Mahon|title=The Chemistry of Aging in Oil Paintings: Metal Soaps and Visual Changes|journal=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin|date=Summer 2009|publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]| jstor=40588562| url= http://metmuseum.org/art/metpublications/Scientific_Research_in_the_Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art_The_Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art_Bulletin_v_67_no_1_Summer_2009?Tag=Chemistry&amp;title=&amp;author=Centeno&amp;pt=0&amp;tc=0&amp;dept=0&amp;fmt=0# |volume=67|issue=1| pages=12–19|editor=Macro Leona }} See page 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The saponified regions may deform the painting's surface through the formation of visible lumps or protrusions that can scatter light.  These soap lumps may be prominent only on certain regions of the painting rather than throughout.  In [[John Singer Sargent]]'s famous ''[[Portrait of Madame X]]'', for example, the lumps only appear on the blackest areas, which may be because of the artist’s use of more medium in those areas to compensate for the tendency of black pigments to soak it up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Silvia A. Centeno |author2= Dorothy Mahon|title=The Chemistry of Aging in Oil Paintings: Metal Soaps and Visual Changes|journal=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin|date=Summer 2009|publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]| jstor=40588562| url= http://metmuseum.org/art/metpublications/Scientific_Research_in_the_Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art_The_Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art_Bulletin_v_67_no_1_Summer_2009?Tag=Chemistry&amp;title=&amp;author=Centeno&amp;pt=0&amp;tc=0&amp;dept=0&amp;fmt=0# |volume=67|issue=1| pages=12–19|editor=Macro Leona }} See pages  12–13, 15.&lt;/ref&gt;  The process can also form chalky white deposits on a painting's surface, a deformation often described as "blooming" or "efflorescence", and may also contribute to the increased transparency of certain paint layers within an oil painting over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Silvia A. Centeno |author2= Dorothy Mahon|title=The Chemistry of Aging in Oil Paintings: Metal Soaps and Visual Changes|journal=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin|date=Summer 2009|publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]| jstor=40588562| url= http://metmuseum.org/art/metpublications/Scientific_Research_in_the_Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art_The_Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art_Bulletin_v_67_no_1_Summer_2009?Tag=Chemistry&amp;title=&amp;author=Centeno&amp;pt=0&amp;tc=0&amp;dept=0&amp;fmt=0# |volume=67|issue=1| pages=12–19|editor=Macro Leona }} See pages 16, 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saponification does not occur in all oil paintings and many details are unresolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Silvia A. Centeno |author2= Dorothy Mahon|title=The Chemistry of Aging in Oil Paintings: Metal Soaps and Visual Changes|journal=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin|date=Summer 2009|publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]| jstor=40588562| url= http://metmuseum.org/art/metpublications/Scientific_Research_in_the_Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art_The_Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art_Bulletin_v_67_no_1_Summer_2009?Tag=Chemistry&amp;title=&amp;author=Centeno&amp;pt=0&amp;tc=0&amp;dept=0&amp;fmt=0# |volume=67|issue=1| pages=12–19|editor=Macro Leona }} See page 19.&lt;/ref&gt;  At present, retouching is the only known restoration method.

'''Science Research Associates Inc.''', commonly known as '''SRA''', is a [[Chicago]]-based publisher of educational materials and schoolroom reading comprehension products.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[https://www.sraonline.com/about_history.html SRA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Science Research Associates Inc. was founded in 1938.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt; Early on, it had a trade and occupational focus. In 1957, it moved into individualized classroom instruction with the iconic SRA [[Reading (process)|Reading]] Laboratory Kit, a format that later translated to mathematics, science, and social studies.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Commonly called '''SRA cards''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/lost-generation-finds-new-pride-20100604-xkiv.html|title=Lost generation finds new pride|first= Miranda |last= Devine|work= [[Sydney Morning Herald]]| date= 2010-06-05|accessdate=2011-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; the labs were large boxes filled with color-coded cardboard sheets. Each sheet included a reading exercise for students. Each student would have an independent topic, and would work on it independently of the other students in the class, consulting with the teacher only if they got stuck. The student would then follow up with [[multiple choice]] questions. As the child moved ahead, he or she would advance in difficulty.

SRA was purchased by [[IBM]] in 1964,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://ed-thelen.org/1401Project/Highlights-of-IBM-History.html| deadurl= yes| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071206054110/http://ed-thelen.org/1401Project/Highlights-of-IBM-History.html| website= ed-thelen.org| title= Highlights of IBM History| archivedate= December 6, 2007| access-date= July 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by that time its products geared to primary and secondary schools had increased, especially at a time when math education was seen as critical during the [[Cold War]] and [[Space Race]]. Despite being an IBM subsidiary, SRA produced both [[IBM PC]] and [[Apple II]] software in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="pc198311"&gt;{{cite news | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=q8fwTt09_MEC&amp;lpg=RA1-PA696&amp;pg=RA1-PA265#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true | title=Cross Clues / Free Enterprise | work=PC Magazine | date=November 1983 | accessdate= 22 October 2013 | author=Advertisement | pages=263, 265}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maxwell Communications Corporation]] bought SRA in 1988. SRA became part of [[Macmillan/McGraw-Hill]] when the joint venture with [[McGraw-Hill]] was created in 1989. When Maxwell Communications collapsed, McGraw-Hill acquired full ownership of Macmillan/McGraw-Hill and SRA.

==Educational programs==
Since the 1960s, SRA has been the publisher of Direct Instruction programs, also known as [[DISTAR]] (Direct Instruction System for Teaching Arithmetic and Reading).  These include ''Language for Learning, Reading Mastery, Reasoning and Writing, Connecting Math Concepts'' and ''Corrective Reading''.  SRA purchased [[Open Court Reading]] in the 1990s.

In the early 2000s, the company was purchased by [[McGraw-Hill Education]] and the brand name and products are now part of the PreK-12 business of McGraw-Hill Education.  The ''Imagine It!'' reading program was launched in 2007.  McGraw-Hill Education also competes as a publisher of mathematics and science materials with programs such as ''Real Math, Number Worlds'' and ''Snapshots Video Science''.

{{Expert needed|Marine life|ex2=Oceans|reason=Terminological confusion, poorly referenced|date=January 2014}}

'''Sea snot''' or '''marine mucilage''' is a collection of [[mucus]]-like organic matter found in the sea. The substance is described as "jello-like sheets of disease-carrying mucus" that holds a strong presence in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and has been spreading into farther-flung waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Gilson|url=https://www.motherjones.com/blue-marble/2009/10/sea-snot-climate-change|title=Sea Snot: Climate Change Gets Gross|date=October 13, 2009|accessdate=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==
Sea snot forms when globs of [[marine snow]] coagulate into large globs that can span distances as large as 124 miles.&lt;ref name="Dell'Amore"&gt;{{cite web|author=Christine Dell'Amore|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/10/091008-giant-sea-mucus-blobs.html|title=Giant, Mucus-Like Sea Blobs on the Rise, Pose Danger|publisher=National Geographic|date=October 8, 2009|accessdate=2010-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mucilage has many components, including a wide range of microorganisms including [[virus]]es and [[prokaryote]]s, and [[exopolymer]]ic compounds with [[colloidal]] properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007006|title=Climate Change and the Potential Spreading of Marine Mucilage and Microbial Pathogens in the Mediterranean Sea|date=September 16, 2009|publisher=PLoS One|author1=Roberto Danovaro|author2=Serena Fonda Umani|author3=Antonio Pusceddu|accessdate=2009-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sea snot is also produced by [[phytoplankton]] when they are stressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Xeni Jardin|url=http://boingboing.net/2010/09/24/sea-snot-explodes-ne.html|title=Sea snot explodes near BP spill disaster site, threatening marine ecosystem|date=September 24, 2010|accessdate=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Effects ==
A recent increase in the amount of sea snot in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and other seas may be the result of [[climate change]].  Warmer, slower moving waters increase the production of sea snot and allow it to accumulate in massive blobs.&lt;ref name="Dell'Amore" /&gt;
Sea snot was first reported in 1729 and has long been seen as a nuisance to the fishing industry and coastal populations.&lt;ref name="Dell'Amore" /&gt; Recently, sea snot has emerged not only as a nuisance, but as a major hazard. Globs of sea snot can harbor bacteria such as ''[[E. coli]]'' that threaten maritime flora and fauna as well as humans exposed to contaminated water.

The [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]] in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] created large amounts of sea snot. Scientists are not sure how exactly the spill caused so much sea snot to form, but one theory asserts that the sea snot could have been the result of a massive kill of [[Marine microorganism|microscopic marine life]] creating a "blizzard" of [[marine snow]]. Scientists worry that the mass of sea snot could pose a biohazard to surviving [[marine life]] in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Christine Dell'Amore|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/09/100916-sea-snot-gulf-bp-oil-spill-marine-snow-science-environment/|title=Sea Snot" Explosion Caused by Gulf Oil Spill?|publisher=National Geographic|date=September 23, 2010|accessdate=2010-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely believed that the Sea Snot left by the spill directly resulted in the loss of sealife in the Gulf of Mexico based upon [[Environmental impact of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill#Impacts to marine species#Corals|a dead field of deepwater coral]] 11 kilometers away from the Deepwater Horizion station.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110413/full/472152a.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23365">The '''sleeper effect''' is a psychological phenomenon that relates to persuasion. It is a delayed increase of the effect of a message that is accompanied by a discounting cue.

==The sleeper effect==
When people are exposed normally to a persuasive message (such as an engaging or persuasive television advertisement), their attitudes toward the advocacy of the message display a significant increase.

Over time, however, their newly formed attitudes seem to gravitate back toward the opinion held prior to receiving the message, almost as if they were never exposed to the communication.  This pattern of normal decay in attitudes has been documented as the most frequently observed longitudinal pattern of persuasion research (Eagly &amp; Chaiken, 1993).

In contrast, some messages are often accompanied with a discounting cue (e.g., a message disclaimer, a low-credibility source) that would arouse a recipient’s suspicion of the validity of the message and suppress any attitude change that might occur by exposure to the message alone.  Furthermore, when people are exposed to a persuasive message followed by a discounting cue, people tend to be more persuaded over time; this is referred to as the sleeper effect (Hovland &amp; Weiss, 1951; Cook &amp; Flay, 1978).

For example, in [[political campaign]]s during important elections, [[Swing vote|undecided voters]] often see negative advertisements about a party or candidate for office.  At the end of the advertisement, they also might notice that the opposing candidate paid for the advertisement.  Presumably, this would make voters question the truthfulness of the advertisement, and consequently, they may not be persuaded initially.  However, even though the source of the advertisement lacked credibility, voters will be more likely to be persuaded later (and ultimately, vote against the candidate disfavored by the advertisement).

This pattern of attitude change has puzzled social psychologists for nearly half a century, primarily due to its counter-intuitive nature and for its potential to aid in understanding attitude processes (Eagly &amp; Chaiken, 1993).  It has been a very widely studied phenomenon of persuasion research (Kumkale &amp; Albarracín, 2004; see also Cook &amp; Flay, 1978).
Despite a long history, the sleeper effect has been notoriously difficult to obtain 
or to replicate, with the exception of a pair of studies by Gruder et al. (1978).

== Controversy about the existence of a "sleeper effect" ==
One of the more challenging aspects that the sleeper effect posed to some researchers in early studies was the sheer difficulty of obtaining the effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Capon|first=N|author2=J. Hulbert |title=The Sleeper Effect - An awakening.|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|year=1973|doi=10.1086/268097|volume=37|page=333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sleeper effect is controversial because the influence of a persuasive communication is greater when one measures the effect closer to the presentation instead of farther from the time of the reception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cook|first=TD|author2=BR FLay |title=The persistence of experimentally induced attitude change|year=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eagly|first=Ah|author2=S. Chaiken |title=The psychology of attitudes|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After attempting to replicate the effect and failing, some researchers suggested that it might be better to accept the [[null hypothesis]] and conclude that the sleeper effect does not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gillig|first=PM|author2=AG Greenwald |title=Is it time to lay the sleeper effect to rest?|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1974|doi=10.1037/h0035744}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sleeper effect is involved with initial message impression so the phenomenon has implications for models of persuasion, including teaching methods, as well as more recent conceptualizations, such as the [[heuristic-systematic model]] and the [[elaboration likelihood model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kumkale|first=G. Tarcan|author2=Dolores Albarracín |title=The Sleeper Effect in Persuasion: A Meta-Analytic Review|date=23 May 2011|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.130.1.143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Cook and his associates responded by suggesting that previous studies failed to obtain the sleeper effect because the requirements for a strong test were not met.  Specifically, they argued that the sleeper effect will occur only if:
:(a) the message is persuasive;
:(b) the discounting cue has a strong enough effect to suppress initial attitude change;
:(c) enough time has elapsed between immediate and delayed post-tests; and
:(d) the message itself still has an effect on attitudes during the delayed post-test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cook|first=TD|author2=CL Gruder |author3=KM Hennigan |author4=BR Flay |title=History of the Sleeper Effect: Some Logical Pitfalls in Accepting the Null Hypothesis|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1979|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.86.4.662 |volume=86 |pages=662–679}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experimental studies conducted did, in fact, provide evidence for the sleeper effect occurring under such theoretically relevant conditions.  Furthermore, the sleeper effect did not occur when any of the four requirements were not met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gruder|first=CL|author2=TD Cook |author3=KM Hennigan |author4=BR Flay |author5=C Alessis |author6=J Halamaj |title=Empirical tests of the absolute sleeper effect predicted from the discounting-cue hypothesis.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1978|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.36.10.1061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the dissociation interpretation, a sleeper effect appears to happen when a convincing message is conferred with a discounting cue (such as a low-credible source or counterargument). A sleeper effect occurs because of an impulsive dissociation of a message and a discounting cue over time (contrasting to a simple forgetting of a source).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pratkanis|first=Anthony R. |author2=Leippe |author3=Greenwald |author4=Baumgardner|title=In Search of Reliable Persuasion Effects: The Sleeper Effect is Dead. Long Live the Sleeper Effect|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1988|volume=54| doi=10.1037/0022-3514.54.2.203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First identified==
The sleeper effect was first identified in U.S. soldiers during World War II, after attempts to change their opinions and morals. Hovland et al. measured the soldier’s opinions five days or nine weeks after they were shown a movie presentation of army propaganda.  It was found that the difference in opinions of those who had observed the army propaganda movie and those who did not watch the movie were greater nine weeks after viewing it than five days.  The difference in delayed persuasion is (which Hovland et al. termed) the sleeper effect, where there was a significant increase of persuasion in the experimental group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kumkale|first=G. Tarcan|author2=Dolores Albarracín |title=The Sleeper Effect in Persuasion: A Meta-Analytic Review|date=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first efforts to justify the effect were consistent with the understanding of persuasion processes at that time.  Hovland and his colleagues introduced a program of research to study how recall of the message and the source persuaded the sleeper effect.  They first hypothesized that message receivers forget the noncredible communicator as time goes by, and therefore the initial message rejection diminishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hovland|first=CL|author2=W Weiss |title=The Influence of Source Credibility on Communication Effectiveness.|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|year=1951|doi=10.1086/266350|volume=15|page=635}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, they later propositioned that message receivers may not entirely forget the cue, yet the association between the representations of the discounting cue and the message content may fade over time and produce a sleeper effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hovland|first=CL|author2=W Weiss |title=The Influence of Source Credibility on Communication Effectiveness.|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|year=1951|doi=10.1086/266350|volume=15|page=635}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two formulations vary in that (a) '''forgetting''' suggests that the traces of the cue disappear or become unavailable in memory over time, while (b) '''dissociation''' suggests that cue remains available in memory but is simply less easily retrieved (less accessible) in relation to the topic of communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kumkale|first=G. Tarcan|author2=Dolores Albarracin |title=The Sleeper Effect in Persuasion: A Meta-Analytic Review|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hypotheses on how the sleeper effect occurs==
Because the sleeper effect has been considered to be counter-intuitive, researchers since the early 1950s have attempted to explain how and why it occurs.
[[Image:Sleeper Effect2.jpg|thumb|right|Figure A: Forgetting&lt;br /&gt;Figure B: Dissociation&lt;br /&gt;Figure C: Differential-Decay]]

===Forgetting and dissociation===
According to the forgetting hypothesis, a discounting cue associated with a message initially decreases acceptance of the message. As time goes by, one may observe a delayed increase of persuasion if the recipient forgets the cue but recalls the merits of the message (Hovland et al., 1949). To test this hypothesis, Hovland and his colleagues (Hovland &amp; Weiss, 1951; Kelman &amp; Hovland, 1953; Weiss, 1953) initiated a series of experiments in which participants received messages attributed to either trustworthy or untrustworthy sources and then completed measures of opinions as well as of recall of the message content and the source. Overall, messages with credible sources produced greater initial persuasion than messages delivered by non credible sources.

[[Carl Hovland|Hovland]], Lumsdaine, and Sheffield (1949) first discovered the effect by a well-known study that demonstrated the delayed impact of a [[World War II]] [[propaganda film|propaganda movie]] on American soldiers.

With a subset of conditions that caused participants to question the credibility of the source in the movie, participants later reported a slight increase of persuasion (much to the researchers’ surprise). After examining the results, they initially hypothesized that forgetting of the discounting cue (in this case, the non-credible source) was causing the effect. Over time, however, the effect of the messages presented by credible sources decayed, whereas the effect of the messages presented by non-credible sources either remained the same or increased slightly. Despite evidence for the sleeper effect from this series of studies, the recall measures indicated that recipients could still remember the non-credible sources of the messages at the time of the delayed follow-up.

This is when the forgetting hypothesis was replaced by the dissociation hypothesis. Now according to the dissociation hypothesis the sleeper effect does not need to imply that the discounting cue becomes permanently unavailable in memory. A weakened association between the cue and the message may be sufficient for the sleeper effect to occur. As the association weakens over time, rendering the cue less accessible in relation to the communication topic, there may be a delayed increase in persuasion as long as the message arguments are still memorable. To this extent, factors that facilitate retention of the message content should create settings conducive to the sleeper effect.

According to this reasoning, the sleeper effect occurs because the association between the discounting cue and the message in one’s memory becomes weakened over time; hence, when the message is recalled for purposes of producing an attitude, the source is not readily associated.

===Differential decay===

Something that Hovland and his team ignored that is important is why over time, the discounting cue becomes less accessible than the message even when both pieces are similarly effective at the onset.  To answer this question Greenwald, Pratkanis, and their team (Greenwald et al., 1986; Pratkanis et al., 1988) implemented a study to identify the conditions by which the sleeper effect does and does not occur.
Pratkanis directed a series of seventeen experiments in which he presented the discounting cue either before or after the message and found that the sleeper effect occurred mostly when the cue followed the message but not when the cue was first. 
In order to explain his findings, Pratkanis and his team proposed a modified forgetting hypothesis, which suggested that the sleeper effect occurs because the effect of the message and the cues decay at different rates. Based on this suggestion the message and the cue act like two communications operating in opposite directions. The sleeper effect emerges when the effect of these communications is about equal, promptly following message exposure, but the effect of the cue later decays more rapidly than that of the message. However, the timing of the discounting cue is essential to produce the effect because information presented first lasts longer, whereas more recent information dissipates more rapidly (Miller &amp; Campbell, 1959). Thus, the sleeper effect should occur when the discounting cue occurs at the end of a persuasive communication and stimulates a primacy effect of the message content.
Years later, Pratkanis, Greenwald, Leippe, and Baumgardner (1988) offered an [[Alternate hypothesis|alternative hypothesis]] that differed from Hovland and his colleagues.

They argued that the conditions under which the sleeper effect is more likely to occur were not emphasized by the dissociation hypothesis.  Additionally, the requirements for a sleeper effect specified by Gruder et al. (1978) did not detail the empirical conditions necessary to observe the sleeper effect.

Tobler first presented his seminal idea during a meeting of the [[International Geographical Union]]'s Commission on Qualitative Methods held in 1969 and later published by him in 1970. Though simple in its presentation, this idea is profound. Without it, "the full range of conditions anywhere on the Earth's surface could in principle be found packed within any small area. There would be no regions of approximately homogeneous conditions to be described by giving attributes to area objects. Topographic surfaces would vary chaotically, with slopes that were everywhere infinite, and the contours of such surfaces would be infinitely dense and contorted. Spatial analysis, and indeed life itself, would be impossible."&lt;ref&gt;De Smith, Michael John; Goodchild, Michael F.; Longley, Paul. "Geospatial Analysis: A Comprehensive Guide to Principles, Techniques and Software Tools", Troubador Publishing Ltd, 2007, p44&lt;/ref&gt;

Less well known is his second law, which complements the first: "The phenomenon external to an area of interest affects what goes on inside".&lt;ref&gt;Linear pycnophylactic reallocation—Comment on a paper by D. Martin, ''International Journal of Geographical Information Science'', 13(1), 85-90, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundation and background==
The theory is based upon the concept of the [[friction of distance]] "where distance itself hinders interaction between places. The farther two places are apart, the greater the hindrance",&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, Meredith; Alagona, Peter S. "AP Human Geography 2008", Barron's Educational Series, 91-92, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; or cost. For example, one is less likely to travel across town to purchase a sandwich than walk to the corner store for the same sandwich. In this example hindrance, or cost, can readily be counted in time and transportation costs which are added to the price of the purchase and thus result in high levels of friction. The friction of distance and the increase in cost combine causing the [[distance decay]] effect.

'''Underwater archaeology''' is [[archaeology]] practiced underwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/gprc/docDetail.action?|title=Underwater and Maritime Archeology in Latin America and the Caribbean|page=21 | id=docid 10408690 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As with all other branches of archaeology, it evolved from its roots in pre-history and in the [[classical era]] to include sites from the historical and industrial eras. Its acceptance has been a relatively late development due to the difficulties of accessing and working underwater sites, and because the application of archaeology to underwater sites initially emerged from the skills and tools developed by shipwreck salvagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.se/~pa/uwa/history.htm |title=A history of underwater archaeology |first=Per |last=Akesson |work=Nordic Underwater Archaeology}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, underwater archaeology initially struggled to establish itself as bona fide archaeological research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gibbins |first1=David |lastauthoramp=yes |last2=Adams |first2=Jonathan |title=Shipwrecks and maritime archaeology |journal=World Archaeology |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=279–291 |year=2001 |doi=10.1080/00438240120048635}}&lt;/ref&gt; The situation changed when universities began teaching the subject and when a theoretical and practical base for the sub-discipline was firmly established. Underwater archaeology now has a number of branches including, after it became broadly accepted in the late 1980s, [[maritime archaeology]]: the scientifically based study of past [[human]] life, behaviours and cultures and their activities in, on, around and (lately) under the sea, estuaries and rivers. This is most often effected using the physical remains found in, around or under [[Sea water|salt]] or [[fresh water]] or buried beneath water-logged [[sediment]].&lt;ref name="Muckelroy"&gt;{{cite book |last=Muckelroy |first=K. |title=Maritime archaeology |location= |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1978 |isbn=0-521-29348-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, the study of submerged WWII sites and of submerged aircraft in the form of underwater [[aviation archaeology]] have also emerged as bona fide activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Broken Wings|url=http://museum.wa.gov.au/research/research-areas/maritime-archaeology/treasures-from-the-deep/broken-wings|website=[[Western Australian Museum]]|publisher=[[Government of Western Australia]]|accessdate=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though often mistaken as such, underwater archaeology is not restricted to the study of shipwrecks. Changes in [[sea-level|sea level]] because of local [[seismic]] events such as the earthquakes that devastated [[Port Royal]] and [[Alexandria]] or more widespread [[climatic]] changes on a [[continent]]al scale mean that some sites of human occupation that were once on dry land are now submerged.&lt;ref name="PortRoyal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nautarch.tamu.edu/portroyal/|title=Port Royal Project: Home|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BouldnerCliff"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soton.ac.uk/mediacentre/news/2007/jul/07_90.shtml|title=:: University of Southampton|author=University of Southampton|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819063330/http://www.soton.ac.uk/mediacentre/news/2007/jul/07_90.shtml|archivedate=2007-08-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the last ice age, the [[North Sea]] was a great plain, and anthropological material, as well as the remains of animals such as [[mammoths]], are sometimes recovered by trawlers. Also, because human societies have always made use of water, sometimes the remains of structures that these societies built underwater still exist (such as the foundations of [[crannogs]],&lt;ref name="crannog"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crannog.co.uk/|title=The Scottish Crannog Centre|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; bridges and [[harbours]]) when traces on dry land have been lost. As a result, underwater [[archaeological]] sites cover a vast range including: submerged indigenous sites and places where people once lived or visited that have been subsequently covered by water due to rising [[sea level]]s; wells, cenotes, wrecks ([[shipwrecks]]; [[aircraft]]); the remains of structures created in water (such as [[crannogs]], [[bridge]]s or [[harbours]]); other port-related structures; [[refuse]] or [[debris]] sites where people disposed of their [[waste]], garbage and other items, such as ships, aircraft, munitions and machinery, by [[ocean dumping|dumping]] into the water.

Underwater archaeology is often complementary to archaeological research on terrestrial sites because the two are often linked by many and various elements including geographic, social, political, economic and other considerations. As a result, a study of an archaeological landscape can involve a multidisciplinary approach requiring the inclusion of many specialists from a variety of disciplines including prehistory, historical archaeology, maritime archaeology, and anthropology. There are many examples. One is the wreck of the VOC ship ''[[Zuytdorp]]'' lost in 1711 on the coast of Western Australia, where there remains considerable speculation that some of the crew survived and, after establishing themselves on shore, intermixed with indigenous tribes from the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museum.wa.gov.au/maritime-archaeology-db/wrecks/id-811 |publisher=Shipwreck Databases Western Australian Museum |title= Zuiddorp (Zuytdorp) (1712/06) North of Kalbarri}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The archaeological signature at this site also now extends into the interaction between indigenous people and the European pastoralists who entered the area in the mid-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mm.wa.gov.au/Museum/march/shipwrecks/Zuytdorp/Zuytdorp.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040603062706/http://www.mm.wa.gov.au/Museum/march/shipwrecks/Zuytdorp/Zuytdorp.html |archivedate=2004-06-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research potential ==
There are many reasons why underwater archaeology can make a significant contribution to our knowledge of the past. In the shipwreck field alone, individual [[shipwreck]]s can be of significant historical importance either because of the magnitude of loss of life (such as the [[RMS Titanic|''Titanic'']]) or circumstances of loss (''[[USS Housatonic (1861)|Housatonic]]'' was the first vessel in history sunk by an enemy submarine).&lt;ref name="Titanic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.titanicinquiry.org/|title=TIP – United States Senate Inquiry|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Housatonic&gt;{{cite web|title=Housatonic i|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/h/housatonic-i.html|publisher=[[Naval History and Heritage Command]]|accessdate=5 June 2015|date=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shipwrecks such as ''[[Mary Rose]]'' can also be important for archaeology because they can form a kind of accidental [[time capsule]], preserving an assemblage of human [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] at the moment in time when the ship was lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/documentaries/2008/08/080821_what_lies_beneath.shtml|title=BBC World Service – Documentaries – What Lies Beneath|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maryrose"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maryrose.org/|title=The Mary Rose|work=The Mary Rose}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes it is not the wrecking of the ship that is important, but the fact that we have access to the remains of it, especially where the vessel was of major importance and significance in the history of science and engineering (or warfare), due to being the first of its type of vessel. The development of submarines, for example, can be traced via underwater archaeological research, via the ''[[H. L. Hunley (submarine)|Hunley]]'', which was the first submarine to sink an enemy ship (''Hunley'' also had unique construction details not found in previous vessels and was one of the few historic warships ever raised intact);&lt;ref name="Housatonic" /&gt; the ''[[Resurgam]]'' ''II'', the first powered submarine;&lt;ref name=ACHW2005&gt;{{cite web|title=Advisory Committee on Historic  Wreck  Sites Annual Report 2005 |url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/upload/pdf/ACHWS_annual_report_2005.pdf |publisher=[[Department for Culture, Media and Sport (United Kingdom)|Department for Culture, Media and Sport]] |accessdate=5 June 2015 |format=pdf |date=June 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070114115741/http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/upload/pdf/ACHWS_annual_report_2005.pdf |archivedate=January 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Holland 5]]'', which provides insight into the development of submarines in the British Navy.&lt;ref name=DCMS&gt;{{cite web|title=Heritage Minister Andrew McIntosh Acts To Protect Wreck Site Of Prototype Submarine|url=http://www.culture.gov.uk/Reference_library/Press_notices/archive_2005/dcms001_05.htm|publisher=[[Department for Culture, Media and Sport (United Kingdom)|Department for Culture, Media and Sport]]|accessdate=5 June 2015|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20060926083354/http://www.culture.gov.uk/Reference_library/Press_notices/archive_2005/dcms001_05.htm|archivedate=26 September 2006|date=4 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== UNESCO Convention ==
All traces of human existence underwater which are one hundred years old or more are protected by the [[UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage]]. This convention aims at preventing the destruction or loss of historic and cultural information and looting. It helps states parties to protect their underwater cultural heritage with an international legal framework.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO, Convention on the protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/underwater-cultural-heritage/]&lt;/ref&gt;
On the basis of the recommendations defined in the above-mentioned UNESCO Convention various European projects have been funded such as the CoMAS project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comasproject.eu/index.php?lang=en |title=CoMAS project |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919052158/http://www.comasproject.eu/index.php?lang=en |archive-date=September 19, 2016 |access-date=January 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challenges ==
Underwater sites are inevitably difficult to access, and more hazardous, compared with working on dry land. In order to access the site directly, [[diving equipment]] and [[Diver training|diving skills]] are necessary. The depths that can be [[scuba diving|accessed by divers]], and the length of time available at depths, are limited. For deep sites beyond the reach of divers, [[submarines]] or [[remote sensing]] equipment are needed.

For a marine site, while  some form of working platform (typically a [[boat]] or [[ship]]) is  often needed, shore-based activities are common. Notwithstanding, underwater archaeology is a field plagued by [[logistics]] problems. A working platform for underwater archeology needs to be equipped to provide for  the delivery of air for example,  recompression and medical  facilities, or specialist remote sensing equipment, analysis of archaeological results, support for activities being undertaken in the water, storage of supplies, facilities for conservation for any items recovered from the water, as well as accommodation for workers. Equipment used for archaeological investigation, including [[water dredge]] and [[air lifts]] create additional [[safety|hazards]] and logistics issues. Moreover, marine sites may be subject to strong [[tidal]] flows or poor weather which mean that the site is only accessible for a limited amount of time. Some marine creatures also pose a threat to diver safety.

Underwater sites are often dynamic, that is they are subject to movement by [[Ocean current|currents]], [[Ocean surface wave|surf]], [[storm]] damage or tidal flows. Structures may be unexpectedly uncovered, or buried beneath sediments. Over time, exposed structures will be eroded, broken up and scattered. The dynamic nature of the environment may make [[in-situ conservation]] infeasible, especially as exposed organics, such as the wood of a shipwreck, are likely to be consumed by marine organisms such as [[Pholadidae|piddocks]]. In addition, underwater sites can be chemically active, with the result that iron can be leached from metal structures to form [[concretions]]. The original metal will then be left in a fragile state. [[Artifact (archaeology)|Artifacts]] recovered from underwater sites need special care.

[[Visibility]] may be poor, because of sediments or [[algae]] in the water and lack of light penetration.&lt;ref name="Cantelas1997"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=FJ |last1=Cantelas |first2=BA |last2=Rodgers |title=Tools, Techniques, and Zero Visibility Archaeology. |journal=In: EJ Maney, Jr and CH Ellis, Jr (Eds.) Diving for Science...1997. |volume=Proceedings of the American Academy of Underwater Sciences |issue=17th Annual Scientific Diving Symposium |year=1997 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/4636 |accessdate=20 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that survey techniques that work well on land (such as triangulation), generally can not be used effectively under water.

In addition it can be difficult to allow access to the results of the archaeological research as underwater sites do not provide good [[outreach]] possibilities or access for the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deepwater Archaeology in Oil and Gas – By Kimberly L. Faulk|url=https://muablog.wordpress.com/2010/12/14/deepwater-archaeology-in-oil-and-gas-by-kimberly-l-faulk-nee-eslinger/|website=Museum of Underwater Archaeology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work has been done to bridge this difficulty through the use of the [[World Wide Web]] for [[webcasting]] projects. An example is  the excavation of the ''[[Queen Anne's Revenge]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=C |last1=Southerly |first2=J |last2=Gillman-Bryan |title=Diving on the Queen Anne's Revenge |journal=In: SF Norton (ed).

== Techniques ==
Although specialised techniques and tools have been developed to address the challenges of working under water, the archaeological goals and process are essentially the same as in any other context. Investigating an underwater site however, is likely to take longer and be more costly than an equivalent terrestrial one.&lt;ref name="Muckelroy" /&gt;

An important aspect of project design is likely to be managing the [[logistics]] of operating from a boat and of managing [[diving operations]]. The depth of water over the site, and whether access is constrained by tides, currents and adverse weather conditions will create substantial constraints on the techniques that can feasibly be used and the amount of investigation that can be carried out for a given cost or in a set timescale. Many of the most carefully investigated sites, including the ''Mary Rose'' have relied substantially on avocational archaeologists working over a considerable period of time.&lt;ref name="Maryrose" /&gt;

As with archaeology on land, some techniques are essentially manual, using simple equipment (generally relying on the efforts of one or more scuba divers), while others use advanced technology and more complex logistics (for example requiring a large support vessel, with equipment handling cranes, underwater communication and computer visualisation).

=== Position fixing ===
Knowing the location of an archaeological site is fundamental to being able to study it. In the open sea there are no landmarks, so [[position fixing]] is generally achieved using [[GPS]]. Historically, sites within sight of the shore would have been located using [[Navigational transit|transects]]. A site may also be located by visually [[Position fixing|surveying]] some form of marker (such as a [[buoy]]) from two known (mapped) points on land. The depth of water at a site can be determined from charts or by using the depth sounding [[sonar]] equipment that is standard equipment on ships. Such sonar can often be used to locate an upstanding structure, such as a shipwreck, once GPS has placed the research vessel in approximately the right location.

=== Site survey ===
[[File:Laevavrakk "Aid".png|thumb|[[Side-scan sonar]] image of shipwreck ''Aid'' in [[Estonia]].]]
The type of survey required depends on the information that is needed to resolve archaeological questions, but most sites will need at least some form of topographical survey and a site plan showing the locations of artifacts and other archaeological material, where samples were taken and where different types of archaeological investigation were carried out. Environmental assessment of archaeological sites will also require that environmental conditions (water chemistry, dynamic properties) as well as the natural organisms present on the site are recorded. For shipwrecks, particularly post-industrial age shipwrecks, pollution threats from wreck material may need to be investigated and recorded.

The simplest approach to survey is to carry out three-dimensional [[surveying]] by divers using [[depth gauge]]s and [[tape measure]]ments.&lt;ref name="3H"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.threeh.demon.co.uk/ |title=3D survey resource site from 3H |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210160101/http://www.threeh.demon.co.uk/ |archive-date=February 10, 2006 |access-date=January 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that such measurements are typically less accurate than similar surveys on land.&lt;ref name="3Htapeerrors"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.threeh.demon.co.uk/Downloads/Tape%20Accuracy%20Paper.pdf |title=Research on the accuracy of tape survey methods from 3H |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060601204853/http://www.threeh.demon.co.uk/Downloads/Tape%20Accuracy%20Paper.pdf |archive-date=June 1, 2006 |access-date=January 24, 2018 |last=Holt |first=Peter |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where it is not practical or safe for divers to physically visit a site, [[Remotely Operated Vehicle]]s (ROVs) enable observation and intervention with control by personnel located at the surface.&lt;ref name=NOAAROV&gt;{{cite web|title="ROV" stands for remotely operated vehicle|url=http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/facts/rov.html|website=Ocean Explorer|publisher=[[Office of Ocean Exploration]]|accessdate=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The low technology approach of measuring using tape measures and depth gauges can be replaced with a more accurate and quicker high technology approach using acoustic positioning.&lt;ref name="Wessexacoustic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wessexarch.co.uk/projects/marine/alsf/wrecks_seabed/round2/acoustic-positioning.html|title=The Acoustic Tracking System|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ROV technology was used during the ''Mardi Gras'' Shipwreck Project. The "Mardi Gras Shipwreck" sank some 200 years ago about 35 miles off the coast of [[Louisiana]] in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] in 4,000 feet (1220 meters) of water.&lt;ref name="Mystery Mardi Gras Shipwreck"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mystery Mardi Gras Shipwreck|url=http://nautilusproductions.com/projects/mystery-mardi-gras-shipwreck-documentary|website=Nautilus Productions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Remote sensing]] or Marine Geophysics&lt;ref name="WessexGeophysics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wessexarch.co.uk/projects/marine/alsf/wrecks_seabed/geophysical_survey_methodology.html|title=Geophysical Survey Methodology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is generally carried out using equipment towed from a vessel on the surface and therefore does not require any one, or any equipment to actually penetrate to the full depth of the site.  Sensitive [[sonar]], especially [[side-scan sonar]] or multi-beam sonar&lt;ref name="Wessexmultibeam"&gt;[http://www.wessexarch.co.uk/projects/marine/alsf/wrecks_seabed/multibeam_sonar.html Multibeam sonar evaluated by Wessex Archaeology] as part of ALSF funded "Wrecks on the Seabed" project&lt;/ref&gt; may be used to image an underwater site.

Sub-bottom profiling&lt;ref name="Wessexsubbottom"&gt;[http://www.wessexarch.co.uk/projects/marine/alsf/wrecks_seabed/sub_bottom_profiler.html Sub-bottom profiling sonar evaluated by Wessex Archaeology] as part of ALSF funded "Wrecks on the Seabed" project&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gracedieu"&gt;[http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/39914/01/pdf_paper.pdf Sub-bottom profile investigation of the ''Grace Dieu'' from The University of Southampton]&lt;/ref&gt; utilizes sonar to detect structures buried beneath sediment.

=== Recording ===
[[File:Diver&amp;shipsbell.jpg|thumb|LAMP archaeologist recording a scaled drawing of the ship's bell discovered on the late 18th century "Storm Wreck" off St. Augustine, Florida]]
A variety of techniques are available to divers to record findings underwater. [[Scale drawing]] is the basic tool of archaeology and can be undertaken underwater. Pencils will write underwater on permatrace, plastic [[Slate (writing)|dive slates]], or matt [[laminated]] paper.

[[Photography]] and [[videography]] are the mainstays of recording, which has become much more convenient with the advent of reasonably priced digital still and HD video cameras. [[Cameras]], including [[video cameras]] can be provided with special underwater housings that enable them to be used for [[underwater videography]]. Low visibility underwater and distortion of image due to refraction mean that perspective photographs can be difficult to obtain. However, it is possible to take a series of photographs at adjacent points and then combined into a single [[Photomontage|photomontage or photomosaic]] image of the whole site. 3D [[photogrammetry]] has also become a very popular way to image underwater cultural materials and shipwreck sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Van Damme |first=T |title=Computer Vision Photogrammetry for Underwater Archaeological Site Recording in a Low-Visibility Environment |url=http://www.int-arch-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/XL-5-W5/231/2015/isprsarchives-XL-5-W5-231-2015.pdf |website=The International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences |doi=10.5194/isprsarchives-XL-5-W5-231-2015 |accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Excavation ===
Where intrusive underwater excavation is appropriate, silts and sediments can be removed from an area of investigation using a [[water dredge]] or [[airlift (dredging device)|airlift]]. When used correctly, these devices have an additional benefit in tending to improve the visibility in the immediate vicinity of the investigation. It is also important to note that for very deep sea excavation submarines are sometimes used to view sites. Underwater photography can also be conducted from these submarines which assists the recording process.

=== Archaeological science ===
A variety of [[archaeological science]]s are used in underwater archaeology. [[Dendrochronology]] is an important technique especially for dating the timbers of wooden ships. It may also provide additional information, including the area where the timber was harvested (i.e. likely to be where the ship was built) and whether or not there are later repairs or reuse of salvaged materials. Because plant and animal material can be preserved underwater, [[archaeobotany]] and [[archaeozoology]] have roles in underwater archaeology. For example, for submerged terrestrial sites or inland water, identification of [[pollen]] samples from sedimentary or silt layers can provide information on the plants growing on surrounding land and hence on the nature of the landscape. Information about metal artifacts can be obtained through [[X-ray]] of concretions. [[Geology]] can provide insight into how the site evolved, including changes in sea-level, [[erosion]] by rivers and [[Deposition (sediment)|deposition]] by rivers or in the sea.

=== Artifact recovery and conservation ===
[[Artifact (archaeology)|Artifacts]] recovered from underwater sites need stabilization to manage the process of removal of water and conservation.&lt;ref name="denix"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hamilton |first=Donny L. |title=Basic Methods of Conserving Underwater Archaeological Material Culture |url=http://www.denix.osd.mil/cr/cultural-resources-program-management/archaeology/uploads/basic-methods-of-conserving-underwater-archaeological-material-culture-report-legacy/ |year=1997 |publisher=[[Texas A&amp;M University]] |location=Washington D.

Artifacts recovered from [[sea water|salt water]], particularly [[metals]] and [[glass]] need be stabilized following absorption of salt or leaching of metals. [[In situ conservation (archaeology)|In-situ conservation]] of underwater structures is possible, but consideration needs to be given to the dynamic nature of the site. Changes to the site during intrusive investigation or removal of artifacts may result in scouring which exposes the site to further deterioration.

=== Interpretation and presentation of underwater archaeology ===
Diver trails also called wreck trails can be used to allow scuba-divers to visit and understand archaeological sites that are suitable for scuba-diving&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Souter, C., 2006 Cultural Tourism and Diver Education. In Maritime Archaeology: Australian Approaches. The Springer Series in Underwater Archaeology. Staniforth, M. &amp; Nash, M. (eds) Springer, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; One excellent example is the [[Florida Public Archaeology Network]]'s (FPAN) "Florida Panhandle Shipwreck Trail."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Florida Panhandle Shipwreck Trail|url=http://www.floridapanhandledivetrail.com/|website=Florida Panhandle Dive Trail}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Florida Panhandle Shipwreck Trail features 12 [[shipwrecks]] including [[artificial reefs]] and a variety of sea life for diving, snorkeling and fishing offshore of Pensacola, Destin, Panama City and Port St. Joe, [[Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blair|first1=Kimberly|title=Florida Panhandle Shipwreck Trail beckons divers|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/2014/08/07/florida-panhandle-shipwreck-trail/13751693/|website=usatoday.com|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise presentation will typically rely on publication (book or [[academic journal|journal]] articles, web-sites and electronic media such as CD-ROM). Television programs, web videos and social media can also bring an understanding of underwater archaeology to a broad audience. The ''Mardi Gras'' Shipwreck Project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mardi Gras Shipwreck|url=http://uwf.edu/jkent/fpan_preCMS/mardigras/|website=uwf.edu|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150516045935/http://uwf.edu/jkent/fpan_preCMS/mardigras/|archivedate=2015-05-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; integrated a one-hour HD documentary,&lt;ref name="Mystery Mardi Gras Shipwreck"/&gt; short videos for public viewing and video updates during the expedition as part of the educational outreach. Webcasting is also another tool for educational outreach. For one week in 2000 and 2001, live [[Underwater videography|underwater video]] of the ''[[Queen Anne's Revenge]]'' Shipwreck Project was [[webcast]] to the [[Internet]] as a part of the ''QAR DiveLive''&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; educational program that reached thousands of children around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=C Southerly and J Gillman-Bryan. |title=Diving on the Queen Anne's Revenge |journal=In: SF Norton (ed).

Furthermore, thanks to the adoption of modern technologies, such as Virtual and Augmented reality systems, it is now possible to develop immersive and interactive digital environments for the exploitation of the underwater archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bruno, F. et al.|title=Project VISAS: Virtual and augmented exploitation of submerged archaeological sites—Overview and first results|journal=Marine Technology Society Journal|date=2016|volume=50|issue=4|page=119-129|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.4031/MTSJ.50.4.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications ==
Publication is an essential part of the archaeological process and is particularly crucial for underwater archaeology, where sites are generally not accessible and it is often the case that sites are not preserved in-situ.

The specialist journals on [[maritime archaeology]], which include the long established ''[[Nautical Archaeology Society#International Journal of Nautical Archaeology|International Journal of Nautical Archaeology]]'', ''The Bulletin of the Australasian Institute for Maritime Archaeology'' (AIMA)  and the recently launched ''Journal of Maritime Archaeology'' publish articles about maritime archaeological research and underwater archaeology.&lt;ref name="JMA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.springer.com/11457|title=Journal of Maritime Archaeology|work=springer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, research on underwater sites can also be published in mainstream archaeological journals, or thematic archaeological journals.  Some institutions also make their unpublished  reports, often called  'Grey Literature',  accessible thereby allowing access to  far more detail and a wider range of  archaeological data than is otherwise the case with  books and journals. An example is the works of the Department of Maritime Archaeology at the  [[Western Australian Museum]].&lt;ref name="WAM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.wa.gov.au/research/research-areas/#maritime-archaeology/maritime-archaeology-publications|title=Research Areas|publisher=Western Australian Museum|accessdate=20 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The public interest market is covered by a number of diving, shipwreck and underwater archaeology books, beginning with the works of [[Jacques Cousteau]].

The techniques of underwater archaeology are also documented in published works, including a number of handbooks,&lt;ref name="IHUA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.springer.com/978-0-306-46345-7|title=International Handbook of Underwater Archaeology|work=springer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AU1"&gt;Archaeology Underwater, The NAS Guide to Principles and Practice; eds Martin dean, Ben Ferrari, Ian Oxley, Mark Redknap and Kit Watson. Published by Nautical Archaeology Society, Archetype Press, 1992 {{ISBN|1-873132-25-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Keith Muckelroy|Muckelroy]]'s classic work on Maritime Archaeology.&lt;ref name="Muckelroy" /&gt;

Founded in 1883, the '''University of Sioux Falls''' ('''USF''') is a Christian [[liberal arts]] [[university]] located in [[Sioux Falls, South Dakota]]. USF's mission is to foster academic excellence and the development of mature Christian persons for service to God and humankind in the world. In fall 2014, the University enrolled a total of 1,142 undergraduate students and 311 graduate students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://apps.usiouxfalls.edu/download/FastFacts |title=Download: USF Fast Facts|website=apps.usiouxfalls.edu|accessdate=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Founding and early history===

On June 5, 1872, pastors and delegates of nine Baptist churches in the [[Dakota Territory]] gathered in [[Vermillion, South Dakota]], at the first meeting of the Baptist Association.  They adopted the following resolution:  "Be it resolved that we take immediate steps for the establishment of an institution among us and that we devote a suitable portion of time at each annual meeting of the consideration of this important subject and give our individual associated influence to encourage a more general and complete education of our youth under distinctly Christian influence."

Under the name of Dakota Collegiate Institute, secondary and collegiate programs began on September 8, 1883. The institution's name changed to Sioux Falls University in 1885, with the secondary program called the Academy and the collegiate department branded Sioux Falls College. Although the college grew, the Academy's enrollment declined, forcing it to close in 1925.

Between 1929 and 1931, Sioux Falls College acquired four Baptist schools that had ceased to operate: Des Moines University, [[Des Moines, Iowa]]; [[List of colleges and universities in Nebraska#Defunct colleges|Grand Island College]], [[Grand Island, Nebraska]]; Cedar  Valley Seminary, [[Osage, Iowa]]; and Parker College, [[Winnebago, Minnesota]]. With the 1931 merger of Grand Island College with what was still legally Sioux Falls University, the institution's official name became Sioux Falls College.

During the Second World War, the college lost its accreditation and offered 200 students, mainly women, two-year degrees. Enrollment surged when the veterans returned home, only to lapse to meager numbers two years later. Financially, the school was in dire straits.

===Expansion===

Reuben P. Jeschke (1953–1970) helped regain full, regional accreditation in 1958, and under his leadership enrollment grew from 378 in 1958 to 1,006 in 1968 – a 166 percent increase. The institution's endowment, although modest, also grew, and what Jeschke described as a "near miracle" happened – a history of balanced budgets.

The most-visible change during this time was the campus. Jeschke oversaw the building of Mears Library, Salsbury Student Union, Salsbury Science Center, Jeschke Fine Arts Center and three residence halls. In fact, ''Time'' magazine featured the College's growth in 1967. The caption read: "Seven Buildings in Seven Years." The subtitle added: "But our stature comes from people." By the end of Jeschke's tenure, Sioux Falls College was well-positioned for the steady success of the 1970s and 1980s.

The 1980s saw the addition of a Degree Completion Program and graduate studies. Today, USF offers four graduate programs: Master of Education (M.Ed.), Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.), Education Specialist (Ed.S.) and a joint doctoral degree in leadership with the University of St. Thomas in Saint Paul, Minn. USF also offers adult education programs: accelerated nursing and RN-to-BSN.

==="Naming the future"===

The 1990s ushered in a new era of excellence. In order to better reflect the Board of Trustees' desire to "name the future", one with growth in student body, expansion of academic programs, improvement in facilities and enhancement of the institution's reputation, Sioux Falls College became the University of Sioux Falls, effective January 1995.

Dr. Mark Benedetto became the 22nd president in 1997, and under his leadership the University has experienced several years of record enrollment and has added graduate programs in business and education. The number of full-time faculty has also more than doubled. In addition, 14 renovation and construction projects have been added to the 24-acre residential campus and the 82-acre USF Sports Complex at 69th Street and Cliff Avenue. New construction has included the following projects: Cleveland Professional Development Center, Collier Baker Hall, Bill and Marian Sullivan Faith and Living Center, Sports and Fitness Complex, McDonald Center and Salsbury Science Center addition and renovation.

In 2008, USF received a $2 million Title III grant from the Department of Education to start a nursing program. This grant provided funds for two simulation labs and renovation of existing science lab facilities. Today the nursing program offers a 15-month accelerated program, an RN-to-BSN program and a traditional undergraduate program.

In 2011, the University added the USF Sculpture Walk to its campus and publicly kicked off its fundraising campaign titled the Uncampaign that will run through 2020.

===Technology===

In 2012, USF built a new Media Studies Center, created a new Music Technology lab for Music majors and added an IdeaLab for Entrepreneurial Studies majors.&lt;ref name="usiouxfalls.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usiouxfalls.edu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=43|title=Course Offerings|website=www.usiouxfalls.edu|accessdate=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==

The University of Sioux Falls is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission and is a member of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hlcommission.org/|title=The Higher Learning Commission|website=www.hlcommission.org|accessdate=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The undergraduate and graduate teacher education programs in the Fredrikson School of Education are accredited by the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) and are approved by the South Dakota Division of Education. Future accreditation standards will be determined by the newly formed accrediting body, Council for Accreditation of Educator Preparation (CAEP). The University's social work program is accredited by the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE) and the University's nursing programs are accredited by the Commission for Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE). The undergraduate and graduate programs in the Vucurevich School of Business are accredited by the International Assembly for Collegiate Business Education (IACBE). Proof of academic accreditation is housed in the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs' Office.

The University also maintains membership in the South Dakota Association of Independent Colleges, the Council of Independent Colleges, the Association of South Dakota Colleges and Universities, the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education and the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities.&lt;ref name="usiouxfalls.edu"/&gt;

Students may also apply for international study in one of USF's 10 CCCU semester-abroad programs.&lt;ref name="usiouxfalls.edu"/&gt;

The University is affiliated with the American Baptist Churches, USA, and welcomes students of any faith or denomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usiouxfalls.edu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2894|title=Mission and Vision|website=www.usiouxfalls.edu|accessdate=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student life==

USF offers more than 100 clubs, organizations and activities to join, 16 NCAA Division II Varsity sports and a wide variety of service opportunities. In addition, USF has weekly activities on campus such as Winter and Summer Olympics, monster golf, Pac Man competitions, speed dating and more. Campus growth has been paramount since 1997, with the addition of new programs, the increase in enrollment and the expansion of USF's physical footprint.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

[[File:2012-05-28 Fotoflug Cuxhaven Wilhelmshaven DSCF9867 (crop).jpg|thumb|Wastewater treatment plant in [[Cuxhaven]], Germany]]

'''Wastewater treatment''' is a process used to convert [[wastewater]] into an [[effluent]] that can be returned to the [[water cycle]] with minimum impact on the environment, or directly reused. The latter is called [[Reclaimed water|water reclamation]] because treated wastewater can then be used for other purposes. The treatment process takes place in a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), often referred to as a Water Resource Recovery Facility (WRRF) or a [[sewage treatment plant]].  Pollutants in municipal wastewater (households and small industries) are removed or broken down.

The treatment of wastewater is part of the overarching field of [[sanitation]]. Sanitation also includes the management of [[human waste]] and [[solid waste]] as well as [[stormwater]] (drainage) management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/topics/sanitation/en/ |publisher=World Health Organization |work=Health topics |title=Sanitation }}&lt;/ref&gt; By-products from wastewater treatment plants, such as screenings, grit and [[sewage sludge]] may also be treated in a wastewater treatment plant.&lt;ref name="M&amp;E-2003"&gt;{{cite book |author=Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc. |title = Wastewater Engineering: Treatment and Reuse |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |isbn=0-07-112250-8|edition = 4th |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Ch.14}}

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Disposal or reuse==
Although disposal or [[reuse]] occurs after treatment, it must be considered first. Since disposal or reuse are the objectives of wastewater treatment, disposal or reuse options are the basis for treatment decisions. Acceptable impurity concentrations may vary with the type of use or location of disposal. Transportation costs often make acceptable impurity concentrations dependent upon location of disposal, but expensive treatment requirements may encourage selection of a disposal location on the basis of impurity concentrations. Ocean disposal is subject to international treaty requirements. International treaties may also regulate disposal into rivers crossing international borders. Water bodies entirely within the jurisdiction of a single nation may be subject to regulations of multiple local governments. Acceptable impurity concentrations may vary widely among different jurisdictions for disposal of wastewater to [[evaporation pond]]s, [[infiltration basin]]s, or [[injection well]]s.

== Processes used ==



===Phase separation===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1984-1002-002, Güstrow, Zuckerwerk, Klärwerk.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Clarifier]]s are widely used for wastewater treatment.]]
Phase separation transfers impurities into a [[non-aqueous phase liquid|non-aqueous phase]]. Phase separation may occur at intermediate points in a treatment sequence to remove solids generated during [[oxidation]] or polishing. Grease and oil may be recovered for fuel or [[saponification]]. Solids often require [[dewatering]] of [[sludge]] in a [[wastewater treatment plant]]. Disposal options for dried solids vary with the type and concentration of impurities removed from water.

Production of [[brine|waste brine]], however, may discourage wastewater treatment removing dissolved inorganic solids from water by methods like [[ion exchange]], [[reverse osmosis]], and [[distillation]]. 
[[File:Vorklärung - primary settling tank (12359073495).jpg|thumb|Primary settling tank of wastewater treatment plant in Dresden-Kaditz, Germany]]

====Sedimentation====
{{further|Sedimentation (water treatment)}}
[[Solid]]s and [[non-polar]] [[liquid]]s may be removed from wastewater by [[gravity]] when [[density]] differences are sufficient to overcome dispersion by [[turbulence]]. [[Sedimentation (water treatment)|Gravity separation]] of solids is the primary treatment of [[sewage]], where the unit process is called "primary settling tanks" or "primary sedimentation tanks". It is also widely used for the treatment of other wastewaters. Solids that are heavier than water will accumulate at the bottom of quiescent [[settling basin]]s. More complex [[clarifier]]s also have skimmers to simultaneously remove floating grease like soap scum and solids like feathers or wood chips. Containers like the [[API oil-water separator]] are specifically designed to separate non-polar liquids.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, pp.111-138&lt;/ref&gt;

====Filtration====

[[Colloid]]al suspensions of fine solids may be removed by [[filtration]] through fine physical barriers distinguished from coarser screens or [[sieve]]s by the ability to remove particles smaller than the openings through which the water passes. Other types of [[water filter]]s remove impurities by chemical or biological processes described below.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, pp.139-196&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oxidation===
Oxidation reduces the [[biochemical oxygen demand]] of wastewater, and may reduce the toxicity of some impurities. [[Secondary treatment]] converts organic compounds into [[carbon dioxide]], water, and [[biosolids]]. Chemical oxidation is widely used for disinfection.
[[File:Belebungsbecken - aeration tank (12359229313).jpg|thumb|Aeration tank of an [[activated sludge]] process at the wastewater treatment plant in Dresden-Kaditz, Germany]]

====Biochemical oxidation====
{{main|Secondary treatment}}
Secondary treatment by [[biochemical]] oxidation of dissolved and colloidal [[organic compound]]s is widely used in [[sewage treatment]] and is applicable to some agricultural and industrial wastewaters. Biological oxidation will preferentially remove organic compounds useful as a food supply for the treatment [[ecosystem]].  Concentration of some less digestible compounds may be reduced by [[co-metabolism]]. Removal efficiency is limited by the minimum food concentration required to sustain the treatment ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;Steel &amp; McGhee, pp. 477–521&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chemical oxidation====
{{main|Redox}}
Chemical oxidation may remove some [[persistent organic pollutant]]s and concentrations remaining after biochemical oxidation.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, pp.363-408&lt;/ref&gt; Disinfection by chemical oxidation kills bacteria and microbial [[pathogen]]s by adding [[ozone]], [[Water chlorination|chlorine or hypochlorite]] to wastewater.&lt;ref name="M&amp;E-2003"/&gt;{{rp|1220}}

===Polishing===
Polishing refers to treatments made following the above methods. These treatments may also be used independently for some industrial wastewater. [[Chemical reduction]] or [[pH]] adjustment minimizes chemical reactivity of wastewater following chemical oxidation.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, p.439&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carbon filtering]] removes remaining contaminants and impurities by chemical absorption onto activated carbon.&lt;ref name="M&amp;E-2003"/&gt;{{rp|1138}} Filtration through sand (calcium carbonate) or fabric filters is the most common method used in municipal wastewater treatment.

== Wastewater treatment plants ==

{{For|[[plant]] species utilized in water treatment|Organisms involved in water purification}}
Wastewater treatment plants may be distinguished by the type of wastewater to be treated, i.e. whether it is sewage, industrial wastewater, agricultural wastewater or leachate.
[[File:WWTP Antwerpen-Zuid.jpg|thumb|Overview of the wastewater treatment plant of Antwerpen-Zuid, located in the south of the agglomeration of Antwerp (Belgium)]]

===Sewage treatment plants===
{{main|Sewage treatment plant}}
A typical municipal sewage treatment plant in an industrialized country may include primary treatment to remove solid material, [[secondary treatment]] to digest dissolved and suspended organic material as well as the nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus, and – sometimes but not always – disinfection to kill [[pathogenic bacteria]]. The [[sewage sludge]] that is produced in sewage treatment plants undergoes [[sewage sludge treatment|sludge treatment]]. Larger municipalities often include factories discharging industrial wastewater into the municipal sewer system. The term "sewage treatment plant" is now often replaced with the term "wastewater treatment plant".&lt;ref name="M&amp;E-2003"/&gt; Sewage can also be treated by processes using "[[Nature-based solutions]]". 

==== Tertiary treatment ====
{{Main|Sewage treatment#Tertiary treatment}}
Tertiary treatment is a term applied to polishing methods used following a traditional sewage treatment sequence. Tertiary treatment is being increasingly applied in industrialized countries and most common technologies are [[micro filtration]] or [[synthetic membranes]]. After membrane filtration, the treated wastewater is nearly indistinguishable from waters of natural origin of drinking quality (without its minerals). [[Nitrate]]s can be removed from wastewater by natural processes in wetlands but also via microbial [[denitrification]]. Ozone wastewater treatment is also growing in popularity, and requires the use of an [[ozone generator]], which decontaminates the water as [[ozone]] bubbles percolate through the tank, but this treatment is energy intensive. The latest, and very promising treatment technology is the use [[aerobic granulation]].

===Industrial wastewater treatment plants===

{{Main|Industrial wastewater treatment}}
Disposal of wastewaters from an industrial plant is a difficult and costly problem. Most [[petroleum refineries]], chemical and [[petrochemical]] plants&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Beychok, Milton R. |title=[[Aqueous Wastes from Petroleum and Petrochemical Plants]] |edition=1st |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |year=1967 |id=[[LCCN]] 67019834}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="M&amp;E-2003"/&gt;{{rp|1412}} have onsite facilities to treat their wastewaters so that the pollutant concentrations in the treated wastewater comply with the local and/or national regulations regarding disposal of wastewaters into community treatment plants or into rivers, lakes or oceans. [[Constructed wetland]]s are being used in an increasing number of cases as they provided high quality and productive on-site treatment. Other industrial processes that produce a lot of waste-waters such as [[paper and pulp production]] has created environmental concern, leading to development of processes to recycle water use within plants before they have to be cleaned and disposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Byrd |first1=J.F. |last2=Ehrke |first2=M.D. |last3=Whitfield |first3=J.I. |date=April 1984 |title=New Bleached Kraft Pulp Plant in Georgia: State of the Art Environmental Control |url= |journal=Journal ''(Water Pollution Control Federation)'' |volume=56 |issue=4 |pages=378–385 |doi= |jstor=25042250}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Industrial wastewater treatment plants are required where municipal sewage treatment plants are unavailable or cannot adequately treat specific industrial wastewaters. Industrial wastewater plants may reduce raw water costs by converting selected wastewaters to reclaimed water used for different purposes. Industrial wastewater treatment plants may reduce wastewater treatment charges collected by municipal sewage treatment plants by pre-treating wastewaters to reduce concentrations of pollutants measured to determine user fees.&lt;ref name="mjh"&gt;Hammer, pp.300-302&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[economies of scale]] may favor use of a large municipal sewage treatment plant for disposal of small volumes of industrial wastewater, industrial wastewater treatment and disposal may be less expensive than correctly apportioned costs for larger volumes of industrial wastewater not requiring the conventional sewage treatment sequence of a small municipal sewage treatment plant.&lt;ref&gt;Kemmer, pp.40-4-40-11&lt;/ref&gt;

An industrial wastewater treatment plant may include one or more of the following rather than the conventional primary, secondary, and disinfection sequence of sewage treatment:
* An [[API oil-water separator]], for removing separate phase oil from wastewater.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, p.180&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[clarifier]], for removing solids from wastewater.&lt;ref&gt;Kemmer, p.41-15&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[trickling filter|roughing filter]], to reduce the [[biochemical oxygen demand]] of wastewater.&lt;ref&gt;Kemmer, p.23-11&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[carbon filtration]] plant, to remove toxic dissolved organic compounds from wastewater.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, p.210&lt;/ref&gt;
* An advanced [[electrodialysis reversal |electrodialysis reversal (EDR)]] system with [[ion exchange membranes]].

===Agricultural wastewater treatment plants===
{{Main|Agricultural wastewater treatment}}
[[Agricultural wastewater treatment]] for continuous confined animal operations like milk and egg production may be performed in plants using mechanized treatment units similar to those described under industrial wastewater; but where land is available for ponds, [[settling basin]]s and [[facultative lagoon]]s may have lower operational costs for seasonal use conditions from breeding or harvest cycles.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, Middlebrooks &amp; Crites, pp.6-8&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Leachate treatment plants ===
[[Leachate]] treatment plants are used to treat leachate from [[landfill]]s. Treatment options include: biological treatment, mechanical treatment by [[ultrafiltration]], treatment with [[Active Carbon|active carbon]] filters and reverse osmosis using disc tube module technology.

{{Commons|Wolfson Centre for Magnetics}}

'''Wolfson Centre for Magnetics''' ('''WCM''') is a research and knowledge centre operating within School of Engineering at [[Cardiff University]].

__TOC__

==Research==
WCM is a centre for research, teaching and technology transfer over a wide spectrum of magnetics, including magnetic engineering, magnetic materials, magnetic devices, and the physics of magnetism.

Research within WCM focuses on several areas related to production, characterisation and applications of [[magnetic materials]]. The scope of the Centre's research activities has recently been broadened by the addition of several new academic staff, allowing the Wolfson Centre for Magnetics to capitalise on the anticipated growth of research opportunities in collaborative, interdisciplinary projects in [[magnetism]] and magnetic materials. [[Computer aided design]] in magnetics, [[electromagnetic machine]]s, [[magnetic imaging]], high permeability materials, [[magnetostriction]], magnetic [[sensors]] and [[actuators]], [[nanomagnetic materials]], magnetic [[thin films]] and multilayers, magnetic material for [[data storage device|data storage]], theory and modelling of magnetic materials are all areas of research currently under investigation in the centre.

Postgraduate research and industrial contract projects are carried out with the support of equipment and research facilities recently upgraded through major infrastructure investments.

WCM has collaborative links with leading research groups in magnetics throughout [[Europe]], [[Asia]], [[North America|North]] and [[South America]], [[Japan]], [[China]], [[India]] and [[Korea]]. Its members participate regularly in [[Academic conference|conference]]s, networking and collaborative research projects both nationally and internationally.

==Facilities==
The Wolfson Centre for Magnetics has a wide range of state of the facilities within its laboratories, which support the research and industrial consultancy activities. Ongoing investment, including an award  from the [[EPSRC]]/[[Energy Saving Trust|EST]] [[Joint Infrastructure Fund|Joint Infrastracture Fund (JIF)]] in 2003 helped in continuous improvement of existing infrastructure and a [[Strategic Research Investment Fund|Strategic Research Investment Fund (SRIF)]] awarded in 2005-2006.

The existing facilities include:

[[File:WCM universal measuring system.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An example of a measuring system]]

===AC and DC properties===

The [[power loss]], [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]], [[apparent power]], [[flux density]], [[magnetic field]], [[Barkhausen noise]], [[magnetostriction]] characteristics of [[soft magnetic materials]] and [[hard magnetic materials]] can be measured with a range of test systems under [[Direct current|DC]], [[Alternating current|AC]] and rotational magnetising conditions. These systems enable material in a wide range of geometries to be tested from 0.001&amp;nbsp;Hz up to 200&amp;nbsp;kHz with controlled arbitrary [[waveform]]s.

===Stress and temperature annealing===

Several of the AC and DC characterisation systems can be used with the sample under stress (±50 [[kilonewton|kN]]) or at a pre-defined temperature (varied from &amp;minus;150&amp;nbsp;°C to +600&amp;nbsp;°C using an environmental chamber, [[laboratory oven]] or [[oil bath]]).

===Micro/nano scale characterisation===

High magnification domain observation system uses the longitudinal and polar [[Kerr effect]] for dynamic observation of surface domain structures at a maximumum rate of 1825 [[Film frame|frames]] per second and maximum magnetification of 500 times.

Vibrating Sample [[Magnetometer]] is used for the DC characterisation of magnetic [[film]]s, [[magnetic tape|tape]]s and [[Powder (substance)|powders]] at magnetic fields up to 3 T in the temperature range from 8 [[Kelvin|K]] to 1270 K.

Magnetic Property Measurement System (MPMS) performs DC characterisation utilising a reciprocating sample and SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device) detection for ultimate resolution at magnetic fields up to 5 T.

Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS) enables the measurement of phenomena such as the magnetocaloric effect, magnetostriction and magnetoresistance over a wide range of temperatures at magnetic fields of up to 7 T.

Magnetic properties close to the surface of soft magnetic materials can be analysed using the Magneto-Optic Kerr Effect Potter (MOKE) which utilises the transverse Kerr effect to measure magnetisation loops in samples such as ferromagnetic films.

[[File:WCM wire production.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A system for production of amorphous microwires]]

===Fabrication of materials===

There is a magnetic [[microwire]]-making room, which is equipped with all units necessary for the production of uncoated and glass-coated amorphous and nanocrystalline wires using [[rapid quenching]] from the melt techniques. The room contains:
* Pre-alloy preparation unit - capacity 20-200 g, provides 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; atm vacuum or inert gas atmosphere. It consist of a [[quartz]] chamber and an [[Edwards Diffstak]] combined vacuum system. Can be used to prepare metallic pre-alloys containing [[metal]]s ([[iron|Fe]], [[cobalt|Co]], [[nickel|Ni]]), [[metaloid]]s ([[phosphorus|P]], [[boron|B]], [[carbon|C]]) and [[rare earth elements]].
* In rotating-water quenched wires preparation unit - used for the preparation of metallic [[amorphous]] and [[nanocrystalline]] wires with cross section diameter around 125 μm and length up to 100 m.
* Glass-coated wires preparation unit - used for the preparation of glass-coated wires (amorphous and nanocrystalline), with diameter 1-50 μm of metallic part and 3-15 μm thickness of the glass coating.

An induction heater providing an output power of 5&amp;nbsp;kW at an operating frequency of up to 400&amp;nbsp;kHz, which operates with multiple workheads and with induction coils of various geometry is used to supply the power for all the above-mentioned units.

===Modelling and simulation===

The Centre employs electromagnetic design and analysis software. These are used in the simulation of [[2D geometric model|2D]] and [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] electromagnetic applications, such as the design and optimization of [[electrical machine]]s, [[non-destructive evaluation]], sensors and actuators, [[permanent magnet]] devices and high frequency applications.

===Performance of electromagnetic devices===

A 3 phase [[transformer]] tester is available for the characterisation of production transformers or simulated cores with a rating up to 15 [[kilovolt-ampere|kVA]] driven by either a constant voltage transformer or selected [[inverter drive]]s through computer controlled [[variac]]s.

A range of dynamometers are used for the assessment of the performance of rotating machines up to a maximum speed of 24,000 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]] and maximum rating of 24 [[kilowatt|kW]].  Variable loads may be applied using [[eddy current]] brakes or DC [[Electrical generator|generator]]s.

A wide range of electromagnetic emissions and immunity testing (including conducted, radiated, ESD, [[Voltage spike|surge]]s, interrupts, [[harmonics]] and [[flicker noise|flicker]]) can be performed with the EMC test suite, which is housed within custom built electromagnetically shielded enclosures. [[Electromagnetic shielding|Shielding]] efficiency of sheet materials under DC and low frequency magnetic fields can also be assessed.

Low levels of ambient magnetic field are attained using a 5 layer [[Mumetal]] enclosure. Various coil systems and highly sensitive field sensors may be used for the calibration of novel magnetic sensors.

Acoustic noise emanating from devices such as transformers, motors and actuators can be measured in the [[hemi-anechoic]] [[acoustic chamber]] using calibrated [[microphone]]s.

==History==
In 1969 a grant from the Wolfson Foundation of £132,000 was awarded to the [[University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology]] (UWIST) to establish a research centre to carry out basic and applied studies on magnetic materials and their industrial applications. Professor [[Jack E. Thompson]] was appointed the Director of the '''Wolfson Centre for the Technology of Soft Magnetic Materials'''. The original objective was to create a unique UK Centre capable of competing at the international level. This objective remains broadly the same today. A property was purchased in 30 The Parade - a street near the University's buildings.

In the 1970s the WCM was awarded the multidisciplinary [[Center of excellence|Centre of Excellence]] recognition by the [[Science Research Council]], the forerunner of today's [[EPSRC]]. Professor Thompson was appointed Head of Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at [[Cardiff University|University College Cardiff]] (UCC) and by mutual agreement WCM was transferred to UCC.

WCM hosted the Second [[Soft Magnetic Materials Conference]] (SMM2) in 1975 and the Centre's name was changed to the Wolfson Centre for Magnetics Technology reflecting its broader range of expertise and activities. The Wolfson Centre hosted SMM5 in 1985 and research carried out at the Centre became commercialised with the establishment of one of the University's first spin out companies, [[MR Sensors Ltd.]], to manufacture [[thin film]] [[sensor]]s in Cardiff.

When UWIST and UCC merged in 1988 the Wolfson Centre became part of the School of Electrical, Electronic and Systems Engineering, which later became the [[Cardiff School of Engineering]]. The Centre later moved to its present location in purpose built laboratories in the Queen's Buildings on Newport Road, which was part of a £30 million refurbishment of Engineering and Science buildings at Cardiff University.

Professor Thompson retired in 1990 and [[Anthony J. Moses|Professor Moses]] became the new Director. In 1994 the WCM was designated a [[Centre of Expertise]] by the [[Welsh Development Agency]]. The Wolfson Centre hosted another major international conference, the [[International Symposium on Non-Linear Electromagnetics]] (ISEM) in 1995.

In 1999, major government funding of £1.3 million under the [[Joint Infrastructure Fund]] (JIF) was awarded to the Wolfson Centre to expand and improve facilities and enable the Wolfson Centre research staff to carry out cutting-edge magnetics research into the next decade.

In 2000 [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] visited Cardiff University and also saw some activity of the WCM.

In 2001 the Wolfson Centre hosted the first UK [[Joint Magnetics Workshop]] (JMW) of the new millennium and was approved as one of 20 [[Centre of Excellence for Technology and Industrial Collaboration|Centres of Excellence for Technology and Industrial Collaboration]] (CETIC) within [[Wales]]. The formal opening of new Wolfson Centre facilities established as a result of the £1.3 million investment awarded under the Joint Infrastructure Fund took place in January 2003.

In 1995, the WCM hosted the [[ISEM]] Conference on its first visit to Europe.

On 14 May 2003 Prof. A.J. Moses was awarded an [[honorary degree]] - ''Doctor Honoris Causa'' by the [[Lublin]] University of Technology (LUT), Poland. This was partially a part of recognition of the strong cooperation between LUT, other Polish Institutes and WCM, which started in 1985.

In June 2004 the Wolfson Centre was host to the Fifth [[European Magnetic Sensors and Actuators Conference]] (EMSA).

In August 2005 Professor [[David Jiles]] was appointed as the new Director and the name of the Centre was changed to its current form Wolfson Centre for Magnetics to better reflect the range of activities being undertaken within the Centre, which includes not only magnetics technology but also basic scientific aspects of magnetics.

In 2005-2006 the WCM was awarded a [[Strategic Research Investment Fund|Strategic Research Investment Fund (SRIF)]] (£1.5 million).

==Present and future==
WCM is a multinational centre and its members come from various countries around the world: [[Bangladesh]], [[Brazil]], [[Burma]], [[China]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Ghana]], [[Greece]], [[India]], [[Iraq]], [[Japan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[South Africa]], [[Spain]], [[Turkey]], [[UK]], [[Ukraine]], [[Thailand]] and [[United States]].

Cardiff University plans a further major expansion of the WCM to increase the number of faculty working in magnetics and to continue the improvement of the existing research facilities. The expansion will focus on aspects of magnetics related to energy, healthcare, nanoscale magnetics, sensors. These include: bulk hard magnetic materials, high frequency materials, low-dimensional materials (micro and nano), nanoscale magnetic structures, magnetic non-destructive evaluation methods, and biomedical applications of magnetics.

On completion the Wolfson Centre for Magnetics will be one of the largest and best-equipped research centres in magnetics in Europe.

In 2007 the WCM was the host for the [[Soft Magnetic Materials Conference]] (SMM18) and in 2008 will be for [[International Workshop on 1 &amp; 2 Dimensional Magnetic Measurement and Testing|1&amp;2DM Workshop]].
