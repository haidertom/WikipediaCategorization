The '''2010 Hong Kong electoral reform''' was the series of events began in 2009 and finalised in 2010 under the '''''Consultation Document on the Methods for Selecting the Chief executive and for Forming the LegCo in 2012''''', a document published on 18 November 2009 by the [[Government of Hong Kong]], ostensibly to broaden the scope of political participation and increase the democratic elements in the 2012 elections in line with the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]].

The proposals included modifying the arrangements for electing the [[Chief executive of Hong Kong]] and the composition and ways of electing the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|city's legislature]] in 2012, in line with the December 2007 decision of the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] (NPCSC). While the [[Pro-democracy camp in Hong Kong|pan-democracy camp]] attacked the conservative proposals as a rehash of those already rejected in 2005, the government said its proposals were "more democratic", and could not exceed what was authorised by Beijing.

The consultations took place in the backdrop of talks about a ''de facto'' referendum, and the [[Hong Kong by-election, 2010]] precipitated by the resignation of five pan-democrat legislators in January 2010. Official attempts to secure the passage of the proposals resulted in a media campaign by the city's leaders and an unprecedented televised debate between the Chief executive and a leader of an opposition party; it also resulted in renewing of dialogue between Beijing and the Pan-democrats which ceased after the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]].

Following the Central Government's acceptance at the eleventh hour of a proposal by the Democratic Party concerning the new District Council functional constituency seats which they had up to that point opposed as being in contravention of the Basic Law, the consultation package was accepted by LegCo on 25 June, with 46 votes. The pan-democrat camp was split when the Democratic Party voted with the government amidst severe recriminations and protests of betrayal; the [[League of Social Democrats]] and the [[Civic Party]] remained opposed to the package but were unable to block the passage. The Chief executive assented on 29 June 2010, and China's parliament ratified the decision on 28 August.

==Background==

=== Pan-democrats' blueprint ===
In March 2007, the pan-democrats published their own blueprint, the 'mainstream transitional proposal' drawn up with the support of 21 legislators in accordance with principles of equal and universal suffrage and which they said reflected public opinion. They proposed that 400 elected district councillors would join the existing 800-member [[Election Committee]], making a total of 1,200-members; Nominations threshold would be set at 50 EC members, and the candidate for CE would be elected in a one-person, one-vote election. Ultimately, the nomination committee would be scrapped. For the legislature, they propose returning half Legco's seats by direct election in single-seat constituencies, with the other half determined by proportional representation.&lt;ref&gt;Leung, Ambrose; Hung, Denise &amp; Lee, Klaudia (3 March 2007) "Democrats agree on suffrage road map", ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chief executive's report===
During his campaign in the CE election in 2007, [[Donald Tsang]] promised that he would "endeavour to forge consensus within the community within his new term, so that universal suffrage could be implemented as soon as possible." A [[Green Paper on Constitutional Development]] was published on 11 July to open discussion on the options, roadmap and timetable for implementing universal suffrage for the CE and the LegCo. According to the consultation document, the CE submitted a report to the NPCSC on 12 December 2007, that "reflect[ed] faithfully the views of different sectors of the community on the issue of universal suffrage received during the public consultation period." The government document asserted that "more than half of the public supported the implementation of universal suffrage for the CE and the LegCo ('dual universal suffrage') in 2012, and at the same time, implementing universal suffrage for the CE first by no later than 2017 would stand a better chance of being accepted by the majority in our community."&lt;ref name=consult2012/&gt;

===NPCSC resolution===
On 29 December 2007, the NPCSC resolved&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081223214014/http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/2211/longtitle.html Decision Of The Standing Committee Of The National People's Congress On Issues Relating To The Methods For Selecting The Chief Executive Of The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region And For Forming The Legislative Council Of The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region In The Year 2012 And On Issues Relating To Universal Suffrage (Adopted By The Standing Committee Of The Tenth National People's Congress At Its Thirty-First Session On 29 December 2007)], Hong Kong Legal Information Institute&lt;/ref&gt; that: &lt;blockquote&gt;that the election of the fifth Chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in the year 2017 may be implemented by the method of universal suffrage; that after the Chief executive is selected by universal suffrage, the election of the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region may be implemented by the method of electing all the members by universal suffrage... Appropriate amendments conforming to the principle of gradual and orderly progress may be made to the specific method for selecting the fourth Chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in the year 2012 and the specific method for forming the fifth term Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in the year 2012 in accordance with the provisions of Articles 45 and 68, and those of Article 7 of Annex I and Article III of Annex II to the Basic Law
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The decision stipulated that:

of the Legislative Council and the consent of the Chief executive&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== The consultation ==
The NPCSC decision became the backbone of the document published by the government on 18 November 2009, entitled the "''Consultation Document on the Methods for Selecting the Chief executive and for Forming the LegCo in 2012''". The government said proposals broadened the scope of political participation and increase substantially the democratic elements in the 2012 elections.&lt;ref name=consult2012&gt;[http://www.cmab-cd2012.gov.hk/doc/consultation_document_en.pdf Public Consultation on the Methods for Selecting the Chief Executive and for Forming the Legislative Council in 2012] Government of Hong Kong, 18 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The consultation ended three months later with 47,200 written submissions being received.&lt;ref&gt;Qiao Xiaoyang (15 April 2010). [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=9&amp;art_id=96927&amp;sid=27735875&amp;con_type=3&amp;d_str=20100415&amp;fc=7 Door to universal suffrage is open] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430162406/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=9&amp;art_id=96927&amp;sid=27735875&amp;con_type=3&amp;d_str=20100415&amp;fc=7 |date=30 April 2010 }}, ''The Standard''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Variables ===
The government notes that, despite calls from some quarters to discuss universal suffrage models, it has only been authorised by the NPCSC to determine the methods for selecting the CE and for forming the LegCo in 2012; how the two electoral methods should be amended for attaining universal suffrage is outside of its scope.&lt;ref name=consult2012/&gt; It said that "there is still ample room for making amendments to the electoral method to enhance its democratic elements" in 2012, and proposed the following for LegCo elections:&lt;ref name=consult2012/&gt;
* To increase the number of LegCo seats to 70 (from 60). The number of seats to be returned by geographical constituencies ("GCs") through direct elections and those returned by functional constituencies ("FCs") to be increased to 35 respectively;
* to have all the five new FC seats and the existing [[District Councils of Hong Kong|District Council]] seat returned through election by elected District Council members from among themselves, i.e. appointed District Council members will not take part in the election;
* the six District Council seats should be returned through election from among elected District Council members by proportional representation, so that in the 2012 LegCo, 41 seats (i.e. close to 60% of all seats) will be returned through geographical direct or indirect elections;
* that Hong Kong permanent residents who are not of Chinese nationality or who have the right of abode in foreign countries may stand in the elections for 12 FC seats (no change);
* that only elected District Council members will participate in the election of District Council seats in the Election Committee and the LegCo, thus enhancing the democratic elements of the elections.

For Chief executive elections, it proposes:&lt;ref name=consult2012/&gt;
* to increase the number of members of the Election Committee to 1,200;
* to increase the proportion of elected District Council members in the Election Committee;
* to maintain the ratio of one-eighth of the total membership of the Election Committee (i.e. 150 members);
* no upper limit on the number of subscribers should be set at this stage;
* the requirement that the CE should not have any political affiliation should not be changed for the 2012 CE election, but can be reviewed in the longer term.

The ''[[Asia Times]]'' remarked that both proposals for LegCo and for the Chief executive "hedged in with so many ifs and buts that there is no guarantee of Hong Kong getting anything at all... "&lt;ref name="Atimes1"&gt;[http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/JA11Ad01.html ''Hong Kong on the march – again.]'' ''Asia Times Online'', 11 January 2008. Retrieved 14 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the level of interest in, and the knowledge of, the proposals was low: A poll conducted by the [[University of Hong Kong]] on 18 November of 1,001 people found 68 per cent knew 'little' of what the consultation was all about; a similar survey three months later remained at 70 per cent. The pollster said the resignation plan by five legislators, without sufficient focus on the details of the reforms, shifted attention away from the plan. Albert Ho said the end game needed to be in the sights, because 2012 was only a transition. He dismissed the proposal as "meaningless" because it failed to address the pan-democrats' real concerns.&lt;ref name=wiser&gt;Leung, Ambrose (20 February 2010). "Three months of consultation and none the wiser", ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt; On a three-day trip to Beijing in late December, Donald Tsang was asked by President [[Hu Jintao]] to handle Hong Kong's constitutional reforms 'in an appropriate manner'. He was told by Premier [[Wen Jiabao]] that Hong Kong 'should start to study major macro-issues relating to holistic developments and plan for the future. It should better resolve some deep-rooted conflicts in Hong Kong, make good uses of Hong Kong's advantages, sharpen Hong Kong's competitiveness and pay more attention to social services and people's livelihood.'&lt;ref name=greener&gt;Cheung, Gary (1 January 2010). "Hopes high for a wealthier, greener and fairer world – Political Reform", ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

Pan-democrats all agreed that the proposals do not go far enough, but were divided on what action is needed.&lt;ref name=greener/&gt; Significantly, the Democratic Party opted to engage with Beijing to negotiate, parting company with the Civic Party and the LSD. In January 2010, five legislators from the Civic Party and the LSD resigned their seats as part of the 'Five Constituencies Resignation' concept for meaningful political reform; [[Albert Chan]], [[Alan Leong]], [[Tanya Chan]], [[Leung Kwok-hung|"Longhair" Leung Kwok-hung]] and [[Wong Yuk-man]] resigned from LegCo.&lt;ref name="sinares"&gt;Sina.com.

Retrieved 24 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Their resignations were submitted on 26 January 2010, with effect on 29 January 2010.&lt;ref name=EU&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=30&amp;art_id=93510&amp;sid=26784783&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20100122&amp;sear_year=2010 |title=Eu denies polls independence ploy |author=Chiang, Scarlett |date=22 January 2010 |work=The Standard |accessdate=23 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629154641/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=30&amp;art_id=93510&amp;sid=26784783&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20100122&amp;sear_year=2010 |archivedate=29 June 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beijing warned the five legislator not to resign. Chief executive Donald Tsang said the "so-called referendum" had no legal grounding.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/26/hong-kong-democracy-bid Hong Kong MPs quit in attempt to push Beijing towards direct elections] ''The Guardian'', 26 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The resignations precipitated [[Hong Kong by-election, 2010|a by-election]] throughout the territory which takes place on 16 May 2010.

== The 2009 package ==
In a surprise move, the government unveiled the revised package before they were scheduled. Key proposals, such as increasing the Election Committee for the chief executive election from 800 members to 1,200 in 2012 and increasing the number of Legislative Council members from 60 to 70, remain unchanged. It was proposed that the five additional Legco seats for the district council constituency will be elected by proportional representation instead of block voting as suggested by pan-democrats.&lt;ref name=golden&gt;Lee, Diana, (15 April 2010). [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=11&amp;art_id=96973&amp;sid=27736844&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20100415&amp;fc=7 'Grab this golden chance'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629165410/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=11&amp;art_id=96973&amp;sid=27736844&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20100415&amp;fc=7 |date=29 June 2011 }}, ''The Standard''&lt;/ref&gt; Announcing the plan, Chief Secretary [[Henry Tang]] said the government tried to find the "maximum latitude to enhance the democratic elements of the two elections in 2012." He urged legislators to accept this 'golden opportunity' because there was no room for further concessions.&lt;ref name=golden/&gt; The proposals will be put before Legco on 23 June, before the summer recess.&lt;ref&gt;Leung, Regina (7 June 2010) Political reform vote set for 23 June, ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Views on the 2009 package ==

=== Central Government ===
[[Qiao Xiaoyang]], head of the NPC's Hong Kong Basic Law committee, said the reason the Standing Committee ruled that Hong Kong "may" and not "must" have universal suffrage for the 2017 chief executive and 2020 Legislative Council elections was because any change in electoral methods required approval by local lawmakers. He added that passage of the reform package would "create excellent conditions for universal suffrage in the future."&lt;ref name=hks-clout&gt;Lee, Colleen (15 April 2010) [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=11&amp;art_id=96965&amp;sid=27736915&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20100415&amp;fc=7 "Qiao adds clout to reforms"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629165426/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=11&amp;art_id=96965&amp;sid=27736915&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20100415&amp;fc=7 |date=29 June 2011 }}, ''The Standard''&lt;/ref&gt;

At a seminar organised by a coalition of Beijing-friendly groups, deputy director of the [[Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region|central government's liaison office]], Li Gang said that lawmakers should act bravely and responsibly to reach consensus, and create favourable conditions for realising the universal suffrage timetable. Li said: "It is impossible for a winner to take all on the issue of constitutional development. There can only be win-win. If one wants to win alone, the result may be lose-lose."&lt;ref name=warns&gt;Fung, Fanny &amp; Leung, Ambrose (5 May 2010). "Beijing warns against another reform veto", ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

After the government unveiled the procedures for the LegCo vote, deputy secretary general of the National People's Congress Standing Committee, Qiao Xiaoyang, defined 'universal suffrage'&lt;ref name=define&gt;Wong, Albert &amp; Leung, Ambrose (8 June 2010). "Beijing offers definition of HK suffrage", ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt; as:
* conferring an equal and universal right to vote
* taking into consideration Hong Kong’s legal status
* being compatible with the executive-led political system
* balancing the interests of different sectors of society
* being beneficial for the development of the city’s capitalist economy
Pan-democrats said Qiao's statement reinforced their concerns, as it offered only the right to vote rather than to stand and nominate others in an election, and paved the way for keeping functional constituencies indefinitely.&lt;ref name=define/&gt;

=== Hong Kong Government ===
Constitutional Affairs minister [[Stephen Lam]] insists the reform proposal is more democratic than the [[2005 Hong Kong electoral reform|2005 package]] which was voted down by the Legislative Council, and was more likely to advance the city's political system if approved. He said that the timetable of universal suffrage in 2017 and 2020 was not an ideal, but asserted that it was "a practical one that is accepted by over 60 percent of residents."&lt;ref name=hks27778167/&gt;

Chief Secretary Henry Tang said the government would consider scrapping appointed district councillors if sufficient opposition lawmakers promise to support the 2012 political reform package.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Colleen (16 April 2010) [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&amp;art_id=97007&amp;sid=27752091&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20100416&amp;sear_year=2010 "Tang ready to cut – a deal on reform"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629170354/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&amp;art_id=97007&amp;sid=27752091&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20100416&amp;sear_year=2010 |date=29 June 2011 }}, ''The Standard''&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking at a seminar, Tang warned pan-democrats that being "led by the nose by a small group of loud people, one will only step onto a road of no return paved with thorns."&lt;ref name=warns/&gt; He said that there was time to have an in-depth discussion on whether functional constituencies should exist, and how legislators should be elected under universal suffrage, but said: "It is undemocratic, unscientific and impractical to simplify the matter as `scrapping functional constituencies' and peg it with the 2012 political reform package."&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Colleen (5 May 2010) [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=30&amp;art_id=97803&amp;sid=28117080&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20100505&amp;sear_year=2010 "Reform group warned of `lose-lose situation'"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629171953/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=30&amp;art_id=97803&amp;sid=28117080&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20100505&amp;sear_year=2010# |date=29 June 2011 }}, ''The Standard''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pan-democrats ===
Pan-democrats expressed their deep disappointment with the proposals; their 18 legislators intimated their preparedness to vote down the package if no further progress is made on democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Colleen (15 April 2010) [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=11&amp;art_id=96974&amp;sid=27736845&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20100415&amp;fc=7 Pan-democrats set to vote down package] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629165443/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=11&amp;art_id=96974&amp;sid=27736845&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20100415&amp;fc=7 |date=29 June 2011 }}, ''The Standard''&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Democratic Party (Hong Kong)|Democratic Party]] condemned the consultation document for failing to bring in dual universal suffrage (for LegCo and for the Chief executive elections) by 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=30&amp;art_id=90800&amp;sid=26144276&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20091119&amp;sear_year=2009 |title=Familiar lines drawn over package |date=18 November 2009 |work==The Standard |accessdate=20 February 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629171126/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=30&amp;art_id=90800&amp;sid=26144276&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20091119&amp;sear_year=2009# |archive-date=29 June 2011 |dead-url=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and again demanded the functional constituencies, which were untouched by the proposal, to be abolished for good.  The "One person, two votes" concept was also brought up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&amp;art_id=92071&amp;sid=26488912&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20091221&amp;sear_year=2009 |title=Debate rages at prospect of `one man, two votes' |author=Scarlett Chiang |date=21 December 2009 |work=The Standard |accessdate=20 February 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629171205/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&amp;art_id=92071&amp;sid=26488912&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20091221&amp;sear_year=2009# |archive-date=29 June 2011 |dead-url=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Democratic Party stopped short of refusing the proposal outright, and expressed the view that if there is no universal suffrage in 2012, the proposal must state that there will be 'real' universal suffrage in 2017 and 2020.

The Democratic Party opting for engagement with Beijing, having assessed was that Beijing was keen to see a breakthrough in the reform talks because it realised that Chief executive Donald Tsang's administration would become a lame-duck administration if his reform package was again defeated. Believed that Beijing wanted reform in Hong Kong to offset international pressure over the lack of human rights, and to set an example for Taiwan, they set, they abandoned the 'radicals' to their referendum plan.&lt;ref name=resign&gt;Leung, Ambrose (14 June 2010). "Top Democrats could resign if talks fail", ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Alliance for Universal Suffrage]] – an umbrella group of moderates with Democratic Party at its core which counts 15 legislators as its members – entered into discussions with representatives of Beijing. They asked for guarantees of the abolition of functional constituencies before they would accept an increase in the government's proposal.&lt;ref&gt;Wong, Albert (26 April 2010). "Pan-democrat alliance indicates it will reject political reform package", ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sink&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=30&amp;art_id=93510&amp;sid=26784783&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20100122&amp;sear_year=2010 |title=Vow to sink early move on reform plan |author=Chiang, Scarlett |date=26 April 2010 |work=The Standard |accessdate=26 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629154641/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=30&amp;art_id=93510&amp;sid=26784783&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20100122&amp;sear_year=2010 |archivedate=29 June 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May, Pan-democrat groups reported having been in contact with mainland officials for several months to discuss ideas for reform; they quote officials as saying that a statement on electoral reform beyond 2012 will be made, conditional upon LegCo's approval of the current package. However, one member of the Alliance said "Pan-democrats would be reluctant to take the political risk to back the proposal for the 2012 elections before Beijing makes a statement on the electoral arrangements beyond 2016."&lt;ref&gt;Cheung, Gary (4 May 2010). "Beijing hints at way ahead on reform", ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

Civic Party lawmaker [[Audrey Eu]] said her party will not support the "regressive and unacceptable" reform package, that increases the number of functional constituency seats.&lt;ref name=hks27778167&gt;Lee, Colleen (19 April 2012). [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&amp;art_id=97077&amp;sid=27778167&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20100419&amp;sear_year=2010 Poll plan a big step forward, insists Lam] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629170124/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&amp;art_id=97077&amp;sid=27778167&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20100419&amp;sear_year=2010 |date=29 June 2011 }}, ''The Standard''&lt;/ref&gt; She said the current proposals, still lacking a roadmap and is thus confined to discussing change for 2012, and not beyond, are no improvement on those vetoed five years ago. She criticised the government for dodging important questions such as how universal suffrage reconciled with functional constituencies; how reform will not be blocked in Legco by functional constituency legislators, who make up half the chamber; and how the political system should evolve to improve governance and mitigate the increasing societal conflict and widening wealth gap.&lt;ref name=views/&gt;

LSD chairman [[Andrew To]] understood that Donald Tsang does not have the power to initiate democratic reform. He said the package was 'old wine in a new bottle', written to give the illusion of reform, while allowing Hong Kong's vested interests to maintain their political power. He lamented the relegation of real reform off into the vague future.&lt;ref name=views/&gt; To warned Tsang and the pro-Beijing camp not to twisted the definition of universal suffrage against the people's interests, and rejected the pro-Beijing camp's assertions that functional constituencies were compatible with the concept of full universal suffrage.&lt;ref name=views/&gt;

[[Anson Chan]] dismissed the latest package as "retrograde": increasing functional constituencies further entrenched narrow vested interests. She called on the government give a clear commitment to abolishing functional constituencies by 2020 at the latest; to make the composition of Election Committee for the chief executive more representative and its workings more transparent; to broaden the electoral base by rebalancing constituencies.&lt;ref name=views/&gt;

[[Cardinal Joseph Zen]] expressed his outrage, anger and helplessness at being "treat[ed] like idiots" by the government. He denounced the ''faux-consultation'' on a package which was little different from the undemocratic proposal voted down in 2005, in that it lacked direction, and road map for universal suffrage. "Even if we reject it, it will not affect the introduction of universal suffrage in 2017 and 2020," he said.&lt;ref name=views/&gt;

=== Government-friendly groups ===
DAB chairman, [[Tam Yiu-chung]], said that while the proposals could be improved upon, his party supported enlarging the Election Committee to 1,200, and creating five district council functional constituency seats in 2012. He proposed to then open up the six district council functional constituency seats for all members of the public, not just district councillors, to contest.&lt;ref name=views/&gt; In late April, LegCo president [[Jasper Tsang]] increased pressure on pan-democrats, whilst triggering controversy when he indicated his willingness to resign his post to vote for reform proposals.&lt;ref name=marchers&gt;Wong Albert &amp; Cheung, Simpson (3 May 2010) "Marchers call for more progressive reforms", '' South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt; He said "Government officials probably also agree my vote is more important than my being Legco president. My post can be temporarily taken by someone else."&lt;ref name=quit&gt;Moy, Patsy (30 April 2010). [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&amp;art_id=97642&amp;sid=28066409&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20100430&amp;sear_year=2010 Quit threat over key reform vote] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629171232/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&amp;art_id=97642&amp;sid=28066409&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20100430&amp;sear_year=2010# |date=29 June 2011 }}, '' The Standard''&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst believing the reform package represents a step forward in democratisation, the [[Liberal Party (Hong Kong)|Liberal Party]] expressed disappointment that the package did not address the need to expand the electorate base of functional constituencies.&lt;ref name=views&gt;20 February 2010, "Political Reform: Views On The Big Issue", ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Tien (politician)|James Tien]] said that in failing to offer concrete proposals on functional constituencies, the government was "not scratching where it itches". He suggested that under a model where functional constituencies would be retained, voters should be able choose a functional constituency in which to cast a second vote. He said that people would enjoy equal voting rights compatible with the principle of universal suffrage; expert views and sectoral interests would still be represented in a legislature otherwise dominated by career politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Leung, Ambrose (30 April 2010). "James Tien proposes 'one person, two votes' for functional impasse", ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

Independent legislator and former security minister [[Regina Ip]] criticised the precipitation of the by-election. She urged the public to refocus on the two methods for selecting the chief executive and electing the legislature in 2012, to forge a consensus on how to move forward in 2012, and lay the foundation for universal suffrage in 2017 and 2020.&lt;ref name=views/&gt;

=== The legal profession ===
The [[Law Society of Hong Kong|Law Society]] and [[Hong Kong Bar Association|Bar Association]] reiterated their call for the abolition of functional constituencies as being non-compliant with international law – Article 25(b) of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] and Article 21 of the Bill of Rights. They urged the government to put forward a revised consultation document with more progressive proposals, a clear road map on the way forward, and a commitment to abolish functional constituencies.&lt;ref name=views/&gt;

Law Society observed that structure of the proposals places a very heavy burden on the chief executive in the three years 2017 to 2020 when major changes were required, and expressed concern that it may thus breach the requirement of the principle of 'gradual and orderly progress' enshrined in Articles 45 and 68 of the Basic Law.&lt;ref name=views/&gt; The Bar Association said that corporate or directors' voting was also incompatible with international law; they said the failure to comply is not mitigated by replacing corporate voting by an authorised representative with voting by directors, executives, member associations, individual members.&lt;ref name=views/&gt;

=== Business groups ===
The [[Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce]] supported maintaining functional constituencies, to provide Legco with the necessary expertise in scrutinising bills and policies. But was open to discuss ways to broaden their voter base, such as 'one-person, two-votes'. They hope to see alignment of chief executive with a political party to facilitate governance, and the CE able to appoint legislators from like-minded groups as principal officials to further cement the link between the administration and the legislature.&lt;ref name=views/&gt; In a survey conducted by TNS, more than 60 percent of business and opinion leaders in Hong Kong want Beijing to promise to take steps in 2016 to pave the way for universal suffrage and abolish functional constituencies; 43% of those surveyed believed the central government should make more concessions to ensure the passage of the package, while one-quarter say the pan-democratic camp should offer concessions.&lt;ref name=TNS&gt;Cheung, Gary (24 May 2010).  "Most want vow from Beijing on 2016 progress". ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt; However, on the possible veto, 43% of the respondents would favour a veto if there was no roadmap for universal suffrage, compared with 39 per cent who disagreed. A pro-Beijing legislator for [[Kowloon East (constituency)|Kowloon East]] said the majority of Hong Kong people considered the proposal inadequate and hoped Beijing would make more concessions.&lt;ref name=TNS/&gt;

=== Pundits ===
[[Joseph Wong]], former secretary for civil service, suggested the government could go further in broadening the democratic base of electorates for the Election Committee by adding new seats in three sub-sectors, to be returned by individual voting; the nomination threshold for the 2012 chief executive election should be lowered from one-eighth to one-tenth, or 160 nominations. He suggest that Legco should remain at 60, but five trade-based seats – education, legal, medical, health services and social welfare – should be returned by 'one man, one vote'.&lt;ref name=views/&gt;

Simon Young, director of the Centre of Comparative and Public Law at the University of Hong Kong, said they hoped for a gradual rearrangement of functional constituencies sectors to achieve greater balance, and to diminish the influence of the most problematic functional constituencies – the commercial, industrial and financial sectors, which operate by corporate or directors' votes, and then abolishing them by 2020.&lt;ref name=views/&gt;

=== Civic groups ===
Former legislator, [[Christine Loh]] of [[Civic Exchange]] acknowledged the HK government had little room for manoeuvre. She said it was widely held that Hong Kong elections were unfair. Functional constituencies and sub-sector elections for the legislature and chief executive selection respectively needed urgent change to remove corporate voting because vested business interests enjoy an excessively dominant role in politics – the alignment of commercial interests with political interests creating a deadly combination.&lt;ref name=views/&gt; She said it was regrettable that Tsang and his team of officials could not be seen to stand and fight side by side with Hong Kong people, but were instead little more than Beijing's messengers.&lt;ref name=Loh1&gt;Christine Loh (18 June 2010) "HK officials' authority under threat in political reform deadlock", ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

Teachers' group Education Convergence said there needed to be a road map for universal suffrage for the chief executive and LegCo elections in 2017 and 2020. The one-eighth nomination threshold for chief executive candidates must be lowered to 50 votes. The government must promise that all functional constituencies will be abolished in 2020.&lt;ref name=views/&gt;

=== Public view ===
In a Hong Kong University poll in May, 48% respondents said legislators should accept the proposals, while the government cited a [[One Country Two Systems Research Institute]] survey of 856 people, which suggested 60 per cent supported the proposals.&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose Leung (4 May 2010). "48pc of people back reform, survey shows", ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

"More HK democrats meet Li Gang", ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt; The Democrats demanded that district council functional constituency lawmakers, instead of being chosen in 2012 by Councillors, that they be nominated by Councillors but elected through universal suffrage.

Following the by-election, the government stepped up efforts to gain support for the reform package. It commissioned two television advertisements which emphasised the need to move forwards with democratisation. Tsang began to campaign via radio interviews, and he and his ministers took to the streets to mobilise support. The roadshow culminated with a televised debate with Audrey Eu of the Civic Party.

On 17 May, one day after the by-election, Donald Tsang gave an interview to Metro Radio in the final push to gain support for the constitutional reform proposals.

Ministers continued their campaign roadshow on the weekend of 5/6 June: they split into three teams to cover the territory. Henry Tang led a team into shopping malls in Kowloon; Donald Tsang made stops at destinations on Hong Kong Island, while John Tsang led colleagues to the New Territories in an attempt to distribute leaflets and badges to the public. Despite the government disclosing ministers' itineraries at short notice, the roadshow was greeted the destinations by students, activists and pan-democratic supporters who had gathered to show their opposition and to demand abolition of functional constituencies.

==Pro-government rally==
On the day, organisers estimated 120,000 participated in the pro-government rally; Police estimated 70,000, and said 43,000 of them subsequent marched on to Central. Attendees at the rally included Donald Tsang, Liberal Party leader, [[Miriam Lau]], DAB chairman [[Tam Yiu-chung]] and Executive Council convenor [[Leung Chun-ying]].&lt;ref&gt;Wan, Adrian (20 June 2010). "70,000 rally in support of electoral reform proposals", ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation phase or the rally was marred by controversies– there were accusations that organisers were buying support, and certain schools were caught up in exerting undue pressure:

===Junket controversy===
Pro-government groups planning a rally on 19 June were attempting to attract participants to their rally in support of the reform proposals by offering free or low-priced junkets. The Hong Kong Quanzhou Association offered registered participants a HK$200 "meal allowance";&lt;ref&gt;Wong, Albert (7 June 2010) "Questions raised over offer of HK$200 each to rally participants", ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patrick Lau]], a government-appointed member of Eastern district council, Wong Wang-tai and Stephen Ng of [[Wan Chai]] district council advertised a "promotional tour" through New Century Society and the Happy Valley Residents' Association for HK$30 (US$3.80). A promotional leaflet reads: "Have fun on a tour to Lei Yu Mun, and support the political system to move forward". The organisers denied it was of a political nature, saying it was "only a cheap tour", so it was not inappropriate to ask for a [[quid pro quo]].&lt;ref&gt;Ng Kang-chung (8 June 2010) "A tempting offer to rally support", ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt; The Beijing-friendly Federation of Trade Unions counter-accused the CTU of offering participants of a Labour Day march an eight-course seafood meal and transportation for HK$40. The FTU, which expects 20,000 to join the rally, said it had been "negligent" in failing to issue a guideline to affiliated organisations, but reiterated the alliance would not accept handing out cash to participants.&lt;ref&gt;Fung, Fanny &amp; Chong, Tanna (11 June 2010). "Meal for marchers nothing new, unionist says", ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

===School controversy===
Schools were also the subject of controversy when it was revealed that the MFBM Chan Lui Chung Tak Memorial College in [[Tin Shui Wai]] tried to force its students to attend the rally by making it part of the curriculum for which academic credit would be awarded. After the school's notice had circulated widely on the Internet, and outcry among parents, the school's principal made participation voluntary.&lt;ref&gt;Yau, Elaine (16 June 2010). "School tells pupils they have to march", ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt; Teaching staff at the Federation of Education Workers Wong Cho Bau Secondary School in [[Tung Chung]] complained to the media that the principal declared participation in the march "an [compulsory] extra-professional development activity" aimed to provide teachers with an opportunity to gain a better understanding of the political situation. The school later denied compulsion, saying it merely informed teachers about the march during a regular conference and never asked them to make public their stance on political development.&lt;ref&gt;Yu, Rebecca &amp; Ho, Serinah (18 June 2010).

The one-hour televised debate between Audrey Eu duly took place at 18:35 on 17 June at the [[Central Government Offices]] with only a TV audience as planned. A three-member panel – headed by the debate moderator Ng Ming-lam – sifted through the 2,876 questions received, and drew lots to select questions for the debate.&lt;ref&gt;16 June 2010 "2,876 questions for TV debate", RTHK News&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislative vote==
The Hong Kong government announced on 7 June that their proposals, basically unchanged since they were unveiled, would be submitted to LegCo in two motions on 23 June: 1) the Amendment to method for forming HK's LegCo, and 2) Amendment to method of selecting the Chief executive.

Chief Secretary Henry Tang said: "The package was put forth after careful deliberations. It was formulated after extensive consultation and discussions among members of the public, different sectors of the community and Legco." He reiterated that there was little room, if any, for more changes since the government had already "pushed to the limit" its authority to reform the political structure arising from a 2007 decision by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. Pan-democrats, who said any proposals which gave no indication of how universal suffrage would eventually be implemented in 2017 and 2020 were unacceptable, further said the division of new seats in the Election Committee would effectively give more political power to unelected, pro-Beijing figures; all 23 pan-democrat lawmakers signed a declaration pledging to veto the government proposal unless clauses are added to indicate a commitment to abolish functional constituencies.&lt;ref&gt;Wong, Albert (8 June 2010) "Die is cast on electoral reform proposals", ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

One week before the LegCo vote, while the government was continuing with its 'Act Now' campaign – described by Albert Ho as "a hard sell" – activists were mobilising a protest in front of LegCo on the day of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;Wong, Albert &amp; Chong, Tanna (14 June 2010).

Over the weekend of 19 June, the official stance softened considerably: senior officials were quoted in the press saying that proposals which once supposedly violated the Basic Law or the NPCSC decision were now viewed as acceptable. The ''South China Morning Post'' revealed that Donald Tsang had written a letter the previous week to [[Xi Jinping]], Vice-president in charge of Hong Kong affairs, requesting Beijing's endorsement. One SCMP source was quoted as saying, "The chief executive warned in the letter that Hong Kong could face a serious governance crisis if the electoral reform package was vetoed by Legco again, and his ability to govern Hong Kong effectively would be in doubt". The source said [[Hu Jintao]] personally approved the proposals, as the leadership feared further strengthening of the "radical" pan-democrats.&lt;ref name=uturn/&gt;

At their meeting on 21 June, the Democratic Party membership voted by a two-thirds majority in support of their leadership's proposal.&lt;ref name=uturn&gt;Cheung, Gary (22 June 2010) "Beijing's U-turn 'to thwart radicals'", ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt; However, the breakthrough was not without cost. Within the party, Martin Lee dissented, and said he was contemplating resigning from the party he helped to found, lamenting, "It's not the party I knew". Legislators [[Andrew Cheng]] and [[James To]] said they were still undecided on their LegCo votes, as their loyalty to the party was in conflict with their responsibility to their constituents.

Audrey Eu said that voting just hours after rough proposal was "extremely disrespectful to the people, disrespectful to this council, and there are a number of issues left blank which should be resolved"; Albert Chan said the new proposal lacked consultation, and criticised the government of using political power to hijack public opinion. [[Lau Kong-wah]] of the DAB dismissed those who supported the adjournment as people who just "oppose everything".&lt;ref name=quitter/&gt; [[Margaret Ng]] (Civic Party) expressed concern that the government's drafting of vague and open resolutions would give them the opportunity to make last-minute changes without notifying Legco. The adjournment motion failed, after a 5-hour debate; it was supported by directly elected legislators, who voted 18:10 in favour of adjournment, but functional constituency legislators voted 24:6 against. [[Ip Kwok-him]] (DAB) later criticised pan-democrats for filibustering with Ho's motion.&lt;ref&gt;Cheung, Gary; Fung, Fanny &amp; Wong, Albert (24 June 2010) "Campaign to defer reform vote fails", ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legco speeches ===
Founding member of the Democratic Party, [[Andrew Cheng]], who had publicly pondered his moral dilemma in supporting the vote, announced in his Legco speech that he would quit the party because "small, but critical differences of opinion" prevented him from fulfilling his election pledge to strive for universal suffrage in 2012. He however urged other pan-democrats not to doubt the party's sincerity, to stop these personal attacks and continue to pave the way to democracy. Unionist lawmaker [[Lee Cheuk-yan]], who declared his intention to vote against the revised proposals, also urged fellow pan-democrats not to forget human relationships: "How has Hong Kong come to this, where we are scolding our own friends? ... Why do people feel the Democratic Party is no longer one of us? I absolutely do not feel like this ... I absolutely cannot utter the words that they have 'betrayed the people'."&lt;ref name=quitter/&gt;

This did not stop Albert Chan from accusing the Democrats of putting party interests above those of the people, and of distortion and misleading them: "To strive for universal suffrage in 2012, that was your election pledge ... If you vote in contradiction to your election pledge, then you have betrayed the people."&lt;ref name=quitter/&gt; A subdued Emily Lau conceded she was effectively reneging on her election pledge, saying: "I want to apologise to all those who voted for me ... I accept the condemnation of the people."&lt;ref name=quitter/&gt; James To, who had been 'undecided', supported the proposal. Expressing his grave misgivings, he said he feared the creation of "super-functional constituencies" with an even larger mandate than geographical constituency lawmakers, would make them impossible to abolish. To reserved a lament for the change he remarked in Emily Lau, who once had the reputation of a firebrand: "I thought she would bring a firmer and harder stance on principles and influence the Democratic Party. But instead, it has been the party that has changed her."&lt;ref&gt;Wong, Albert and Fung, Fanny (25 June 2010). "James To criticises – and votes for proposal"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Amendment to method for selecting the Chief executive===
After a nine-hour debate, the resolution which increases the size of the [[Election Committee]] which elects the chief executive in 2012 from 800 to 1,200 members, won endorsement at 2.20&amp;nbsp;pm on 24 June by the legislature by 46 votes to 13. Pan-democrats who supported the proposals included eight from the Democratic Party, [[Joseph Lee (Hong Kong politician)|Joseph Lee Kok-long]] and [[Frederick Fung]] of the ADPL.&lt;ref name=cheers&gt;Cheung, Gary; Wong, Albert &amp;  Fung, Fanny (25 June 2010) "Cheers and jeers for political reform vote", ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt; James To, who had earlier expressed misgivings about giving his support, voted in favour.&lt;ref name=cheers/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yau, Thomas (25 June 2010), [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=30&amp;art_id=99802&amp;sid=28703160&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20100625&amp;sear_year=2010 "Reluctant James To toes the party line"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010184141/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=30&amp;art_id=99802&amp;sid=28703160&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20100625&amp;sear_year=2010 |date=10 October 2012 }} ''The Standard''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Amendment to method for forming the Hong Kong Legislative Council ===
The loyalist DAB, which had enthusiastically endorsed the original government proposals from the outset, was annoyed at having its credibility weakened by the last minute proposal.&lt;ref name=cheers/&gt; The 'Amendment to method for forming the Hong Kong Legislative Council' was approved by LegCo at 13:30 on 25 June, with 46 votes in favour and 12 against. 'Longhair' Leung Kwok-hung was ejected from the chamber just prior to the vote.&lt;ref&gt;Balfour, Frederik &amp; Lui, Marco (25 June 2010).

===Assent===
Formal assent to the draft amendments to Annexes I and II to the Basic Law concerning the methods of selecting the Chief executive and forming the Legislative Council was given by the Chief executive on 29 June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Press release (29 June 2010).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1354">'''722 Redemption''' is a process within the [[Bankruptcy in the United States|U.S. bankruptcy code]] under [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|section 11 U.S.C. 722]] that allows a debtor to redeem collateral based on the market value of the collateral. The bankruptcy code allows a debtor to pay the retail value of the collateral in a lump sum payment to the creditor in exchange for the lien on the collateral being released. 

In order for 722 redemption to apply the item in question must be personal property intended primarily for personal, family or household use. The [[interest]] in the property must be exempted under the bankruptcy code or has to be abandoned by the bankruptcy estate in order for 722 redemption to be used. Once a bankruptcy case is filed a debtor must file a motion in court and obtain a court order to redeem the property. This process is most commonly used to redeem vehicles that are worth less than the outstanding loan on the vehicle. The process allows a debtor to pay the current market value of the vehicle versus the outstanding [[loan]] on the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/722|title=11 U.S. Code § 722 - Redemption|website=LII / Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Africa Travel Association''' ('''ATA''') is a [[non-profit]] international travel industry [[trade association]] established in 1975.

ATA defines its mission as to "promote travel, tourism and transport to and within [[Africa]], and to strengthen intra-Africa partnerships."

ATA serves both the public and private sectors of the international travel and [[tourism]] industry. ATA membership comprises African governments, their tourism ministers, tourism bureaus and boards, airlines, cruise lines, hotels, resorts, front-line travel sellers and providers, tour operators and travel agents, media and affiliate members.

ATA partners with the [[African Union Commission]] (AUC) to promote the sustainable development of tourism to and across Africa. ATA's annual events in Africa and the [[United States]] bring together industry leaders to shape Africa's tourism agenda.

==Structure==

ATA is registered as a [[501(c)|501(c)6]] non-profit trade association in the [[United States|USA]], with its headquarters in [[Washington D.C.]] and chapters around the world. ATA is overseen by an international [[board of directors]] and managed daily by an [[executive director]] and management team.

==Objectives==

*Advocate for Africa as a leading global travel destination
*Raise awareness of Africa as a destination with rich and diverse tourism opportunities and products
*Promote positive news on Africa
*Develop and promote travel programs to and across Africa
*Assist country and [[private sector]] members with [[marketing]]
*Serve as a liaison on tourism matters in Africa between member countries
*Present opportunities for members to market and showcase their products and services
*Offer members [[continuing education]], training and learning opportunities
*Help members increase business through exposure, networking and referrals
*Organize events where tourism stakeholders meet to discuss issues of common interest and concern
*Conduct research with partner organizations on tourism matters in Africa

== Events ==

===The Presidential Forum===

ATA's Annual Presidential Forums on Tourism, which are hosted by [[New York University]]'s Africa House, take place in New York every September in parallel with the [[United Nations General Assembly]] meetings. This one-day event offers Africa's leaders an important opportunity to speak about how travel and tourism contributes to a country's economy and development. Ten African leaders from the [[African Union Commission]], [[Benin]], [[Burundi]], [[Ghana]], [[the Gambia]], [[Liberia]], [[Malawi]], [[Morocco]], [[Tanzania]] and the [[World Bank]] addressed the 2010 forum.

===The US-Africa Tourism Seminar===

ATA's leading industry event in the USA takes place in conjunction with a leading travel [[trade show]], attracting tourism industry professionals and diplomatic representatives eager to learn about possible policy choices related to tourism in Africa. Participants also explore key growth trends that have helped African tourism grow steadily in recent years and help connect to other companies to develop strategic business partnerships.

===Promotional road shows===

ATA increases the visibility of Africa as a destination in the North American marketplace by showcasing the destination and its private sector partners' products in largely untapped metropolitan marketplaces like [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] and [[Montreal]] as well as in major cities like New York, [[Los Angeles]] and [[Atlanta]]. ATA also participates in global industry travel trade shows in Europe, Asia and Africa.

===The Eco and Cultural Tourism Symposium===

Tourism professionals specializing in [[sustainable tourism]], art, culture, heritage travel, [[responsible tourism]], [[green travel]], and [[Conservation movement|conservation]] come together to explore Africa's emerging [[Ecotourism|eco]] and [[cultural tourism]] industries. Countries hosting symposiums share their travel products with delegates through on-site field visits and case studies.

Past symposium:

2007/8: Djibouti City, Djibouti,
2006: Calabar, Nigeria,
2005: Luanda Angola,
2004: Kampala, Uganda,
2003: Zanzibar, Tanzania,
2002: Fez, Morocco,
2001: Yaoundé, Cameroon,
2000: Abuja, Nigeria,
1996: Marrakech, Morocco,
1994: Cape Town, South Africa,
1992: Saly/Dakar, Senegal.

===Annual World Congress===

ATA's signature event in Africa provides a networking, learning and agenda-shaping platform for 300-500 travel professionals from around the world. The event addresses timely industry topics and offers [[professional development]] opportunities. Delegates also participate in roundtables for tourism ministers, an African [[Bazaar]] for buyers and sellers, networking events, host country day(s), gala dinners and pre- and post-country tours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africatravelassociation.org/userfiles/2014%20Post-Uganda%20Congress%20PR_FINAL.pdf ATA convenes 39th ANNUAL WORLD CONGRESS in Uganda] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216153312/http://www.africatravelassociation.org/userfiles/2014%20Post-Uganda%20Congress%20PR_FINAL.pdf |date=December 16, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rwanda will host ATA’s 41st Annual World Congress in Spring 2017.

==Initiatives==

===The Young Professionals Program===

The mission of the Africa Travel Association’s Young Professionals Program (YPP) is to engage tourism and [[hospitality]] students and young industry professionals in Africa’s tourism industry and to cultivate future ATA membership. To achieve this mission, YPP offers two programs that serve young people at different points in their education and professional development: (1) The ATA Student Union; and, (2) the ATA Young Professionals Network. Through these two programs, YPP aims to help future industry leaders gain access to tourism professionals focusing on Africa in order to help them build the relationships and networks now that will serve the industry and ATA later. By encouraging the exchange of knowledge, ideas and interests and by providing opportunities for training and travel to Destination Africa, YPP also connects a new generation to ATA and its members who are accomplished tourism professionals.

===Africa diaspora===

[[Africa diaspora]] is a critical resource for tourism promotion and investment. To encourage the participation in the industry, ATA has launched the ATA African Diaspora Initiative with the goal of engaging African diaspora leaders, entrepreneurs and media in tourism promotion to Africa.

===Strategic partnership with the African Union Commission===

In May 2010, the [[African Union Commission]] (AUC) and the Africa Travel Association (ATA) signed a [[Memorandum of Understanding]] supporting the "promotion of the sustainable development of tourism in Africa". The MoU was signed with the understanding that major regions of the world have established effective regional tourism bodies, like the [[Pacific Asia Travel Association]] (PATA) and the [[Caribbean Tourism Organization]] (CTO) and that "Africa has yet to formally adopt as a continent an organization as such to service its tourism marketing, research and advocacy".

He is head of the Intelligence and National Defense Program of the [[Institute for National Security Studies (Israel)|Tel Aviv University's Institute for National Security Studies (INSS)]].

According to ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', before Ze'evi-Farkash's retirement from the military he set up a secret commission to evaluate all available information on the missing Israeli navigator [[Ron Arad (pilot)|Ron Arad]]. The commission concluded that Arad died between 1993 and 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Christoph Schult|author2=Holger Stark|date=7 September 2009|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,647423-2,00.html|title= Missing for 23 Years: Secret Israeli Report Reveals Truth about Ron Arad's Fate|work=Der Spiegel|accessdate=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family and later life==
[[File:Dvorac Erdödy Jastrebarsko.jpg|thumb|Erdödy Castle in [[Jastrebarsko]], once owned by Ehrmann family]]
While living in Varaždin, at the age of 27, Ehrmann meet Dora ([[Married and maiden names|née]] Wilczek), the daughter of a wealthy Jewish entrepreneur Albert Wilczek and his wife Elizabeth [[Married and maiden names|née]] Deutsch. They married on December 22, 1907, at the Varaždin [[synagogue]]. After wedding, Ehrmann moved with his wife to Slavonski Brod, where his company was located. In 1909 their oldest daughter Ada was born. In 1912 Ehrmann family moved to Zagreb. In 1913 their second daughter Hedi was born, and in 1916 son Leon. In April 1918, Ehrmann moved with his family to Budapest, and in March 1919 they returned to Zagreb. Given the fact that Ehrmann family permanently settled in Zagreb, in 1922 architect [[Viktor Kovačić]] built the villa for the Ehrmann family which was located at Jurjevska ulica 23. Ehrmann and his family were known philanthropists who aided the poor and needy, city of Zagreb, various Catholic and Jewish organizations, [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] Croatia and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} Jutarnji list (br. 9.571) 18. rujna 1938. Svečanost u domu konzula Ehrmanna.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} Potvrde se nalaze u PAOB-ZG.&lt;/ref&gt; On May 16, 1926 Ehrmann bought a castle, from [[Erdődy|Ljudevit Erdödy]], in [[Jastrebarsko]] with the whole estate and hunting ground for the amount of 2,5 million [[Yugoslav dinar|dinars]]. Ehrmann had invested a large sum of funds on the  castle reconstruction, which was in poor condition.&lt;ref name="FFSZ"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} Zemljišnoknjižni odjel Općinskog suda u Jastrebarskom, Zbirka isprava, Kupoprodajni ugovor

br. Z-1418/26, Čl. 1. ugovora.&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], with the [[Independent State of Croatia]] regime in power, Ehrmann and his family were required to submit mandatory application of wealth to the office for the Jews at Ministry of Public economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} HDA-ZG, Fond obnove privrede Ministarstva narodnog gospodarstva, kutija 666.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ante Pavelić]] ordered that Ehrmann is to be treated as the representative of Portugal in Croatia.&lt;ref name = "holokaust u zagrebu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Horvat"/&gt; Ehrmann helped Jews escape the Independent State of Croatia, by issuing them visas for Portugal.&lt;ref name="ff"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "holokaust u zagrebu"/&gt; His son Leon was jailed in [[Nazi Germany]] as an officer of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] army, and his daughter Ada escaped to [[Split, Croatia|Split]] with her husband Julius Weinreb, which was under [[Kingdom of Italy|Fascist Italy]] occupation. During the war, Ehrmann helped, protected and saved the victims of the Nazi terror. From 1939 to 1942 he also gave considerable sums of money for the fight against the Nazis.&lt;ref name="FFSZ"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} PAOB-ZG, Potvrda dr. Srećka Šilovića&lt;/ref&gt;

Sáenz is a Director of the Foundation Conde de Barcelona, the Foundation Empresa y Sociedad, the Foundation Cruz Roja Española, and the Foundation Ayuda Contra la Drogadicción.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Acknowledgements==
-2006: Alfredo Sáenz receives the Manager Award 2006, awarded by the consulting firm AT Kearney, in the form of best manager in financial institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rrhhdigital.com/ampliada.php?sec=45&amp;page=2&amp;id=41448 "Alfredo Sáenz, mejor gestor en entidades financieras". ''rrhhdigital.com''. Madrid, 15 December 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt;

-2012: Alfredo Saenz has been chosen the second best CEO of European banks. The degree has been awarded by 1,470 analysts from 150 companies that participated in the magazine's annual ranking Institutional Investor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.es/20120316/economia/abci-alfrendo-saenz-elegido-segundo-201203162033.html "Alfredo Sáenz, elegido segundo mejor consejero de la banca europea". ''Abc''. Madrid, 16 March 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt; This same study has also ranked as the third best in accordance with the vote of the 825 investors and managers funds of 435 companies participating in the study.

==Banned==

In 2011, the [[Supreme Court of Spain]] gave Sáenz a three-month ban from working as a banker, after a long legal action. He was convicted of false accusations against presumed debtors to Banesto, now a Santander subsidiary, who were briefly jailed over the affair in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/c7dee9b6-1764-11e1-b20e-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2KZinTALV|title=Santander chief pardoned in 17-year-old case|author=Victor Mallet|date=November 25, 2011|work=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Santander said he would appeal the decision, and that Sáenz would continue in his job.&lt;ref&gt;Reuters. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/8373353/Santander-chief-Alfredo-Saenz-banned-from-working-as-banker-for-three-months.htmlSantander chief Alfredo Saenz banned from working as banker for three months]. The Telegraph. 10 March 2011. Retrieved 28 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

If the crime stood as convicted then he would lose his job as CEOs in Spain must be of good moral repute. On account of this the authorities converted his prison sentence to a pardon and replaced it with a lower penalty, a nominal fine.

==Pay==

According to Forbes.com, in 2007 Sáenz had a salary of €3 million, with a bonus of €5.5 million and additional earnings of just under €0.9 million for a total "compensation" of €9.6 million. In 2009, his total compensation was €10.2 million.&lt;ref&gt;[https://people.forbes.com/profile/alfredo-saenz-abad/9847 Forbes.com] ''Alfredo Saenz Abad. Second Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Banco Santander SA, Madrid''. Retrieved 28 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ThisisMoney.co.uk, Sáenz will be Santander's top earner in 2012 with pay of £10.6 million as well as £1.2 million in shares awarded in earlier years but only to be received in 2012, and a £0.9 million pension contribution. ThisisMoney remarked that this was "despite the bank suffering a huge slump in profits due to a £538 million bill for mis-selling."&lt;ref&gt;James Salmon.

'''Atlantia S.p.A.''' (formerly '''Autostrade S.p.A.''') is an [[Italy|Italian]] [[holding company]] operating toll motorways and airports. Its primary asset is '''Autostrade per l'Italia''', the largest [[Concession (contract)|concessionaire]] on the [[Autostrade of Italy|Italian autostrade]] network.&lt;ref name=atlantia-&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atlantia.it/en/operations/aspi |title=Italian motorways |publisher=Atlantia |accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another subsidiary of Atlantia, Autostrade of Virginia, is a member of the consortium that operates the [[Dulles Greenway]].

On 14 August 2018, the highway bridge [[Ponte Morandi]] in [[Genoa]] managed by this group suffered a catastrophic collapse, causing the death of many. The Italian Government, in addition to possible penalties, is considering the possibility of removing the concessions of Italian motorways away from this group.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|language=it|url=http://www.ansa.it/liguria/notizie/2018/08/14/crolla-ponte-su-autostrada-a10-a-genova-_78dafcff-5ac9-47f9-a8a6-9caadf2e11bc.html|title=Genova, Governo: revocare concessione Autostrade. Società: possiamo ricostruire il ponte in 5 mesi - Liguria|periodical=ANSA.it|date=2018-08-14|accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The firm is publicly traded on the [[Borsa Italiana|Milan Stock Exchange]] and is a constituent of the [[FTSE MIB]] Index. Atlantia's largest single shareholder with around 38% of the company is Sintonia, an investment vehicle of the [[Benetton family]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

As of 2018 the group operates 5,000&amp;nbsp;km of toll motorways in Italy, Brazil, Chile, India and Poland, and manages airports in Italy and France.&lt;ref name=atlantia-group&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atlantia.it/en/the-group |title=The Group |publisher=Atlantia |accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The subsidiary Autostrade International of Virginia O &amp; M, Inc. was formed in 1993 to operate the [[Dulles Greenway]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Virginia]].&lt;ref name="archive"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050828082057|website=web.archive.org|title=Wayback Machine|accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The company was founded in 2006 from the former company Autostrade S.p.A.&lt;ref name="repubblica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/economia/finanza/2013/12/01/news/gemina_addio_fusione_atlantia-72456970/|title=Gemina saluta Piazza Affari, dopo la fusione con Atlantia|website=Repubblica.it|accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018 Atlantia S.p.A bought 15&amp; of GTlink for 1&amp;nbsp;billion Euro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/economia/finanza/2018/03/02/news/atlantia_entra_nel_tunnel_della_manica_1_miliardo_per_il_15_di_getlink-190187993/|title=Atlantia entra nel tunnel della Manica: 1 miliardo per il 15,5% di Getlink|date=2 March 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A section of the company that controlled the [[Ponte Morandi]] bridge collapsed on 14 August 2018, causing the death of 43 people; Atlantia removed its company stand at the [[Communion and Liberation]] [[Meeting for friendship among peoples|Meeting of Rimini]] on 15 August 2018.&lt;ref name="ilfattoquotidiano"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2018/08/17/ponte-morandi-autostrade-toglie-stand-al-meeting-di-rimini-e-inopportuno/4565530/|title=Ponte Morandi, Autostrade toglie stand al Meeting di Rimini: &amp;quot;È inopportuno&amp;quot;|website=Il Fatto Quotidiano|accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bates Australia''' is a leading [[saddle]] manufacturer originally established in 1934. Bates Saddlery was formed when Mr. George Bates borrowed $100 from his sister, bought a sewing machine and began to make saddles on the veranda of his home in Perth, Western Australia.&lt;ref name="Bates Australia"&gt;[http://www.batessaddles.com.au Bates Australia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Bates Australia is the parent company to [[Bates Saddles]] and [[Wintec]].&lt;ref name="The Horse"&gt;[http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=4285 The Horse: The Right Saddle for the Job&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Body-centred countertransference''' involves a psychotherapist's experiencing the physical state of the patient in a clinical context.&lt;ref&gt;Louise Phillips, ''Mental Illness and the Body'' (2006) p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; Also known as [[Countertransference#Body-centred countertransference|somatic countertransference]], it can incorporate the therapist's gut feelings, as well as changes to breathing, to heart rate and to tension in muscles.&lt;ref&gt;Su Fox, ''Relating to clients'' (2008) p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

==Various approaches==

[[Dance therapy]] has understandably given much weight to the concept of somatic countertransference.&lt;ref&gt;Patrizia Pallaro, 'Somatic countertransference', in ''Authentic Movement'' vol 2 (2007) Chap 7&lt;/ref&gt; Jungian [[James Hillman]] also emphasised the importance of the therapist using the body as a sounding-board in the clinical context.&lt;ref&gt;Pallaro, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-[[Wilhelm Reich|Reichian]] therapies like [[bioenergetic analysis]] have also stressed the role of the body-centered countertransference.&lt;ref&gt;Katya Bloom, ''The Embodied Self'' (2006) p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some evidence that [[Narcissism|narcissistic]] patients and those suffering from [[Borderline personality disorder]] create more intense embodied countertransferences in their therapists,&lt;ref&gt;Tamara Latawec, ''When the Professional is Personal'' (2008) p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; their personalities favouring such non-verbal communication by impact&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (1990) p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; over more verbalised, less somatic interactions.

==Orbach==

[[Susie Orbach]] has written emotively of what she described as "wildcat sensations in my own body...a wildcat countertransference"&lt;ref&gt;Susie Orbach, 'Speaking Bodies' in ''Bodies'' (London 2009) 48-76, p. 50-1&lt;/ref&gt; in the context of body countertransference. She details her [[Joseph J. Sandler#Role responsiveness and actualization|role responsiveness]] to one patient who evoked in her what she called "an unfamiliar body experience...this purring, reliable and solid body"&lt;ref&gt;Orbach, p. 52-5&lt;/ref&gt; to counterbalance the fragmented body image of the patient herself.

==The Irish experience==
===In female trauma therapists===
Irish psychologists at NUI Galway and University College Dublin&lt;ref&gt;Egan, J. &amp; Carr, A. (2005).  [[Burnout (psychology)|Burnout]] in female counsellor/therapists of the NCS: Studies I, II and III. Papers presented at the 35th Annual conference of the psychological society of Ireland, Derry, Nov 17-20th&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Egan, J. &amp; Carr, A. (2008).  Body-centred countertransference in female [[trauma therapists]]. Eisteach, 8, 22-27.&lt;/ref&gt; have recently begun to measure body-centred countertransference in female trauma therapists using their recently developed 'Egan and Carr Body-Centred Countertransference Scale' (2005), a sixteen symptom measure.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lenus.ie/hse/bitstream/10147/121271/1/BodycentredCounter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

Their research was influenced by developments in the psychotherapy world which was beginning to see a therapist's role in a therapeutic dyad as reflexive; that a therapist uses their bodies and 'self' as a tuning fork to understand their client's internal experience and to use this attunement as another way of being empathic with a client's internal world.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, M. (2006).  The analyst's body as a tuning fork:  Embodied resonance in countertransference.  Journal of Analytical Psychology, 51, 109-124&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wosket, V.  (1999).  The therapeutic use of self.  London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;  Pearlman and  Saakvitne's seminal book on [[vicarious traumatization]] and the effect of trauma work on therapists has also been an important directional model for all researchers studying the physical effects of trauma work on a therapist.&lt;ref&gt;Pearlman, L. A., &amp; Saakvitne, K. W. (1995). Trauma and the therapist: Countertransference and vicarious traumatization in psychotherapy with incest survivors.  New York: Norton&lt;/ref&gt; 

High levels of body-centred countertransference have since been found in both Irish female trauma therapists and clinical psychologists.&lt;ref&gt;Booth, A., Trimble, T., &amp; Egan, J. (2010).  Body-centred countertransference in a sample of Irish Clinical Psychologists.  The Irish Psychologist, 36, 284-289.&lt;/ref&gt;  This phenomenon is also known as 'somatic countertransference' or 'embodied countertransference' and it links to how [[mirror neurons]] might lead to 'unconscious automatic somatic countertransference' as a result of [[postural mirroring]] by the therapist.&lt;ref&gt;Egan, J. &amp; Carr, A. (2008).  Body-centred countertransference in female trauma therapists. Eisteach, 8, 22-27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rothschild, B. (2006).  Help for the helper: self-care strategies for managing burnout and stress. London:  W. W. Norton &amp; Company.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Loughran (2002) found that 38 therapists out of 40 who had responded to a questionnaire (which was distributed to a sample of 124 therapists) on a therapist's use of body as a medium for transference and countertransference communication reported that they had experienced bodily sensations (nausea or churning stomach, sleepiness, shakiness, heart palpitations, sexual excitement, etc.) while in session with patients.&lt;ref&gt;Loughran, E. H. (2002). The therapists's use of body as a medium for [[transference]] and countertransference communication. Unpublished Doctor of Psychology Dissertation.  Wright Institute:  California.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frequency of symptom occurrence===

A list of the frequency of occurrence of body-centred countertransference symptoms reported by trauma therapists (Sample A: 35 Female Irish Trauma therapists&lt;ref&gt;Egan, J. &amp; Carr, A. (2008).  Body-centred countertransference in female trauma therapists. Eisteach, 8, 22-27.&lt;/ref&gt;) and Irish clinical psychologists (Sample B: 87 Irish Clinical Psychologists&lt;ref&gt;Booth, A., Trimble, T., &amp; Egan, J. (2010).  Body-centred countertransference in a sample of Irish Clinical Psychologists.  The Irish Psychologist, 36, 284-289.&lt;/ref&gt;)in the previous six months 'when in-session with a client' is given below in order of frequency:
{{Col-begin}}
{{Col-2}}
#Sleepiness (A; 92%, B; 76%)
#Muscle Tension (A; 83%, B; 79%)
#Yawning (A; 65%, B; 77%)
#Unexpected shift in body (A; 77%, B; 57%)
#Tearfulness (A; 71%, B; 61%)
#Headache (A; 54%, B; 53%)
#Stomach Disturbance (A; 41%, B; 46%)
#Throat Constriction (A; 34%, B; 36%)
{{Col-3}}
#Raised Voice (A; 29%, B; 33%)
#Dizziness (A; 26%, B; 19%)
#Loss of voice (A; 32%, B; 18%)
#Aches in joints (A; 37%, B; 18%)
#Nausea (A; 23%, B; 18%)
#Numbness (A; 29%, B; 15%)
#Sexual Arousal (A; 26%, B; 11%)
#Genital pain (A; 6%, B; 2%)
{{Col-end}}

===Somatization===

A small but significant relationship was found between female trauma therapists' level of body-centred countertransference and number of sick leave days taken, suggesting a possible relationship between uncensored body-centred countertransference and [[somatization]]. This relationship was not however found in [[clinical psychologists]] who were working mainly with a non-trauma population. Therapists have noted the connection between a tendency for some clients to express emotional discomfort by focusing on [[bodily symptoms]] rather than being able to put their emotional distress into words.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lenus.ie/hse/bitstream/10147/121822/1/SomatizationDis.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  It is thought that such processes are more common in people who have experienced [[childhood abuse]] and trauma.&lt;ref&gt;Pribor, E. F., Yutzy, S. H., Dean, J. T., Wetzel, R. D.  (1993).  [[Briquet's syndrome]], dissociation and abuse.  American Journal of Psychiatry, 150, 1507-1511.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Recent research which measured female [[genital arousal]] in response to rape cues found that women when listening to rape, consent or violence developed genital arousal more frequently than men. It also might explain the relatively frequent reported experience of sexual arousal amongst Irish female trauma therapists.&lt;ref&gt;Suschinsky, K. D. &amp; Lalumiere, M. L. (2010).  Prepared for anything?  An investigation of female genital arousal in response to rape cues.  Psychological Science OnlineFirst@  10.1177/0956797610394660&lt;/ref&gt;  Further validation of body-centred countertransference in psychologists and therapists is on-going in both [[NUI Galway]] and Trinity College Dublin.

==Cautions==

Therapists have been warned against assuming too automatically that their body-feelings always involve somatic resonance to the client, as opposed to being produced from their own feelings/experiences - the same problem appearing with countertransference generally.&lt;ref&gt;Christiane Sanderson, ''Counselling Adult Survivors of Child Sexual Abuse'' (2006) p. 136-7 and p. 395&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chief information officer''' ('''CIO'''), '''chief digital information officer''' ('''CDIO''') or '''information technology''' ('''IT''') '''director''', is a job title commonly given to the most senior executive in an enterprise who works for the traditional [[information technology]] and computer systems that support enterprise goals.

Typically, the CIO reports directly to the [[chief executive officer]] but may also report to the [[chief operating officer]] or [[chief financial officer]].  In military organizations, they report to the [[commanding officer]]. The Chief Information Officer role was first defined&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.williamgruber.com/strategic-information|title=williamgruber|website=williamgruber}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1981 by  William R. Synnott, former Senior Vice President of the Bank of Boston, and William H. Gruber, former professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management.&lt;ref&gt;Synnott W.R. and Gruber W.H. (1981) Information Resource Management: Opportunities and Strategies for the 1980s. New York: Wiley-Interscience.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The need for CIOs==
CIOs or CDIOs form a key part of any business that utilizes technology and data. In recent times, it has been identified that an understanding of just business or just IT is not sufficient.&lt;ref name="Business Week"&gt;{{cite web|last1=von Simson|first1=Ernest|title=The new role of the CIO|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-05-22/the-new-role-of-the-cio|website=ww.businessweek.com|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; CIOs manage IT resources and plan "[[Information and communications technology|ICT]] including policy and practice development, planning, budgeting, resourcing and training”.&lt;ref name=Nottingham.ac.uk&gt;{{cite web|last1= University of Nottingham|title=The role of a Chief Information Officers (CIO) or equivalent Senior ICT Manager|url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/gradschool/sict/toolkit/knowledge-base/ict-services/role-cio|website=www.nottingham.ac.uk|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, CIOs are becoming increasingly important in calculating how to increase profits via the use of ICT frameworks, as well as the vital role of reducing expenditure and limiting damage by setting up controls and planning for possible disasters. ''[[Computer Weekly]]'' magazine highlights that “53% of IT leaders report a shortage of people with high-level personal skills” in the workplace.&lt;ref name="Computer Weekly"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Manwani|first1=Sharm|last2=Flint|first2=David|title=From manager to chief information officer|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/feature/From-manager-to-chief-information-officer|website=www.computerweekly.com|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most organisations can't expect to fill demand for skilled resources and 57% of CIOs don't have the right learning and support mechanisms in place to enable current staff to meet the skill shortage.&lt;ref name="CIO WaterCooler"&gt;{{cite web|title=CIOWaterCooler - The Changing Shape of IT|url=https://ciowatercooler.co.uk/cio-survey-the-changing-shape-of-it|accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; CIOs are needed to decrease the gulf between roles carried out by both IT professionals and non-IT professionals in businesses in order to set up effective and working relationships.

==Roles and responsibilities==
The Chief Information Officer of an organization is responsible for a number of roles. First and most importantly, the CIO must fulfill the role of business leader.&lt;ref name="Business Leader Journal"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peppard|first1=Joe|title=Unlocking the Performance of the Chief Information Officer (CIO)|journal=California Management Review|date=August 2010|volume=52|issue=4|page=5|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/52640613/unlocking-performance-chief-information-officer-cio|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a CIO must make executive decisions regarding things such as the purchase of IT equipment from suppliers or the creation of new systems, they are therefore responsible for leading and directing the workforce of their specific organization. In addition, the CIO is ‘required to have strong organizational skills’.&lt;ref name="Roles and Responsibilities Journal"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lawry|first1=Rachel|last2=Waddell|first2=Dianne|last3=Singh|first3=Mohini|title=Roles, Responsibilities and Futures of Chief Information Officers (CIOs) in the Public Sector|date=2007|page=3|url=http://www.hadjarian.com/esterategic/tarjomeh/arzi1.pdf|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly relevant for a Chief Information Officer of an organization who must balance roles in order to gain a competitive advantage and keep the best interests of the organization's employees. CIOs also have the responsibility of recruiting, so it is important that they take on the best employees to complete the jobs the company needs fulfilling.

In addition, CIOs are directly required to map out both the ICT strategy and ICT policy of an organization. The ICT strategy covers future proofing, procurement, and the external and internal standards laid out by an organization. Similarly, the CIO must write up the ICT policy, detailing how ICT is utilized and applied. Both are needed for the protection of the organization in the short and long term and the process of strategizing for the future. Paul Burfitt, former CIO of [[AstraZeneca]], also outlines the CIO's role of IT governance, which he refers to as the “clarifying” of “accountability and the role of committees”.&lt;ref name="Roles and Responsibility Computer Weekly"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Computer Weekly|title=What exactly does a chief information officer do?|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240061366/What-exactly-does-a-chief-information-officer-do|website=www.computerweekly.com|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years the CIO and their close cousin has become more closely involved in customer facing products. With the rising awareness in organisations that their customers are expecting digital services as part of their relationship with an organisation, CIOs have been tasked with product oriented responsibilities. Clear examples of this are seen at facilities management company MITIE where former CIO of energy firm Centrica Davi Cooper is the CTIO and has an agenda to create online services for their customers.&lt;ref name="CIO Interview: David Cooper, CTIO of Mitie"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Horizon CIO Network|title=CIO Interview: David Cooper, CTIO of Mitie|url=https://horizoncio.network/cio-interview-david-cooper-ctio-of-mitie|website=horizoncio.network|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risks involved==
As the CIO has a large number of responsibilities such as provision of finance, recruitment of professionals and development of policy and strategy, the risks are consequently vast. The CIO of U.S company [[Target Corporation|Target]] was forced into resignation in 2014 after the theft of 40 million credit card details and 70 million customer details by hackers.&lt;ref name="CIO Resigntion Article"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vaas|first1=Lisa|title=Target CIO Beth Jacob resigns in breach aftermath|url=http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2014/03/06/target-cio-beth-jacob-resigns-in-breach-aftermath/|website=www.nakedsecurity.sophos.com|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; CIOs carry out a large number of roles and therefore the chance of failure is very high. In this way, any CIO must be knowledgeable about the industry so they can adapt and reduce the chance of error.

With the introduction of legislation such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) CIOs have now become increasingly focused on how their role is regulated and can lead to financial and reputation damage to a business.  However, regulations such as GDPR have also been advantageous to CIOs enabling them to have the budget and authority in the organisation to make significant changes to the way information is managed.  Sabah Khan-Carter of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp described GDPR as "a really big opportunity for most organisations".&lt;ref name="CIO Podcast: GDPR is a business opportunity"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Horizon CIO Network|title=CIO Podcast: GDPR is a business opportunity|url=https://horizoncio.network/cio-podcast-gdpr-is-a-business-opportunity|website=horizoncio.network|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information technology==
Information technology and its systems have become so important that the CIO has come to be viewed in many organizations as a key contributor in formulating [[strategic]] goals for an organization.  The prominence of the CIO position has greatly risen as information, and the information technology that drives it, has become an increasingly important part of the modern organization.  Many CIOs are adding additional [[c-level]] titles to reflect the growing importance of technology in successfully running companies; this trend is referred to as the [[CIO-plus]].  The CIO may be a member of the executive committee of an organization, and/or may often be required to engage at board level depending on the nature of the organization and its operating structure and governance environment.  No specific qualifications are intrinsic to the CIO position, though the typical candidate may have expertise in a number of technological fields - [[computer science]], [[software engineering]], or [[information systems]]. However, in healthcare there is a rising demand for CIOs to be qualified. The benefit of this is that they will then be seen as peers to their clinical peers and able to command greater respect and opportunity in the organisation.&lt;ref name="Healthcare CIOs chime agreement for professional recognition"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Horizon CIO Network|title=UK's leading NHS CIOs discuss the need for professional qualification|url=https://horizoncio.network/healthcare-cios-chime-agreement-for-professional-recognition/|website=horizoncio.network|accessdate=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 Many candidates have [[Master of Business Administration]] or [[Master of Science in Management]] degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Meridith Levinson |url=http://www.cio.com/article/122507/Should_You_Get_an_MBA_ |title=Should You Get an MBA? - CIO.com - Business Technology Leadership |publisher=CIO.com |date=2007-07-05 |accessdate=2012-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently, CIOs' leadership capabilities, business acumen and strategic perspectives have taken precedence over technical skills. It is now quite common for CIOs to be appointed from the business side of the organization, especially if they have [[project management]] skills.

Despite the strategic nature of the role, a 2017 survey, conducted by [[Logicalis]], of 890 CIOs across 23 countries found that 62% of CIOs spend 60% or more of their time on day to day IT activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.logicalis-thinkhub.com/|title=Logicalis CIO Survey 2017-2018 {{!}} Think Hub {{!}}|last=|first=|date=2017-11-15|website=www.logicalis-thinkhub.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[Gartner]] Executive Programs conducted a global CIO survey and received responses from 2,053 CIOs from 41 countries and 36 industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2304615|title=Gartner Executive Program Survey of More Than 2,000 CIOs Shows Digital Technologies Are Top Priorities in 2013 |publisher=Gartner |accessdate=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gartner reported that survey results indicated that the top ten technology priorities for CIOs for 2013 were [[analytics]] and [[business intelligence]],  [[mobile technologies]], [[cloud computing]], [[Collaborative software|collaboration technologies]], [[Software modernization|legacy modernization]], [[IT management]], [[customer relationship management]], [[virtualization]], [[security]], and [[enterprise resource planning]].

''CIO'' magazine's "State of the CIO 2008" survey asked 558 IT leaders whom they report to.  The results were: [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] (41%), [[chief financial officer|CFO]] (23%), [[Chief operating officer|COO]] (16%), Corporate CIO (7%) and Other (13%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cio.com/article/147950/_State_of_the_CIO_2008_Data_Shows_CIO_Salaries_Influence_Rising |title=State of the CIO 2008 Data Shows CIO Salaries, Influence Rising |publisher=CIO |accessdate=27 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, a CIO is involved with driving the analysis and re-engineering of existing business processes, identifying and developing the capability to use new tools, reshaping the enterprise's physical infrastructure and network access, and with identifying and exploiting the enterprise's knowledge resources.  Many CIOs head the enterprise's efforts to integrate the Internet into both its long-term strategy and its immediate business plans. CIOs are often tasked with either driving or heading up crucial IT projects that are essential to the strategic and operational objectives of an organization.  A good example of this would be the implementation of an [[Enterprise Resource Planning]] (ERP) system, which typically has wide-ranging implications for most organizations.

Another way that the CIO role is changing is an increased focus on service management.&lt;ref name="servMgmt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cio.com/article/558564/Recession_Shifts_IT_Service_Management_Into_Fast_Lane |title=CIO Magazine: Recession Shifts IT Service Management into Fast Lane |publisher=Cio.com |date=2010-02-26 |accessdate=2012-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[SaaS]], [[IaaS]], [[Business process outsourcing|BPO]] and other more flexible value delivery techniques are brought into organizations the CIO usually functions as a 3rd party manager for the organization.  In essence, a CIO in the modern organization is required to possess business skills and the ability to relate to the organization as a whole, as opposed to being a technological expert with limited functional business expertise.  The CIO position is as much about anticipating trends in the market place with regard to technology as it is about ensuring that the business navigates these trends through expert guidance and proper strategic IT planning that is aligned to the corporate strategy of the organization.

==Distinction between CIO, CDO and CTO==
The roles of Chief Information Officer, [[Chief Digital Officer]] and [[Chief Technology Officer]] are commonly blurred. Tom Silver, the North American senior vice president for Dice, states that CTOs are concerned with technology itself, often customer-facing, whereas CIOs are much more concerned with its applications in the business and how this can be managed.&lt;ref name="Oracle CTO"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zetlin|first1=Minda|title=CIO or CTO- What's in a Title?|url=http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/profit/features/050110-ciocto-143658.html|website=www.oracle.com|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More specifically, CIOs manage a business's IT systems and functions, creates and delivers strategies and policies, and places great emphasis on internal customers. In contrast to this, CTOs place emphasis on the external customers to the organization and focus on how different technology can make the company more profitable.&lt;ref name="Tech Republic CTO"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hiner|first1=Jason|title=Sanity check: What's the difference between CIO and CTO?|url=http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/tech-sanity-check/sanity-check-whats-the-difference-between-cio-and-cto/|website=www.techrepublic.com|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional definition of CTOs focused on using technology as an external competitive advantage now includes CDOs who use the power of modern technologies, online design and [[big data]] to digitalise a business.

==Awards and recognition==

It is not uncommon for CIOs to be recognised and awarded annually, particularly in the technology space. These awards are commonly dictated by the significance of their contribution to the industry and generally occur in local markets only. Awards are generally judged by industry peers, or senior qualified executives such as the [[chief executive officer]], [[chief operating officer]] or [[chief financial officer]]. Generally awards recognise substantial impact to the local technology market.

In [[Australia]], the top 50 CIOs are recognised annually under the [[CIO50]] banner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cio.com.au/cio50/|title=Home- CIO 50- CIO|website=CIO}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States|United States of America]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[New Zealand]] CIOs are recognised under the [[CIO100]] banner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cio.com/category/cio100/|title=CIO 100 Symposium and Awards|website=CIO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cio.co.uk/cio100/archive/|title=CIO 100 Archive - CIO UK|website=www.cio.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cio.co.nz/cio100nz/|title=CIO 100- CIO New Zealand|website=CIO New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Creative services''' are a subsector of the [[creative industries]], a part of the economy that creates wealth by offering [[creativity]] for hire to other businesses. Creative Services also means a department within a company that does creative work such as writing, designing, and production. It is often a sub-department of the [[Marketing]] organization. Examples include:

*[[Design]] and production agencies
** [[Studio]]s 
** Ideation consultancies
** [[Software development]] firms
*[[Marketing]] firms 
**[[Public relations]] agencies
**[[Advertising]] agencies
**[[Sales promotion|Promotional]] agencies
**[[Brand]]ing agencies
*[[Entertainment]] Industries 
** [[Talent agency]]
** [[Guild]]s

Like lawyers and accountants in the [[professional services]] sector, [[creative services firm]]s sell a specialised technical service to satisfy the needs of companies that do not have this expertise themselves.

Creative services firms provide creative services to other companies or to the public: they 'do [[creativity]]' to order.

Typical [[business models]] revolve around selling the time of skilled [[professionals]], either on a project-by-project basis, or through a [[service level agreement]] and providing [[Service (economics)|services]] on an ongoing basis for a fixed monthly fee. In this sense they share much in common with [[professional services]] firms but there are also key differences:

* Creative services firms tend not to be bound by requirements for professional [[Professional certification|accreditation]]
* There are low [[barriers to entry]] for new [[Startup company|startup businesses]]

'''Donald Alvin Coleman''' (born January 11, 1952) is an American entrepreneur, advertising executive and a pioneer in the growing field of multicultural advertising. Coleman is the founder, chairman and CEO of [[GlobalHue]], the largest multicultural advertising agency in the United States, working with blue chip brands and organizations to communicate with African-American, Asian and Hispanic consumers.  He is also a former [[American football]] player, having played [[college football]] at the [[University of Michigan]] from 1971 to 1973 and professional football for the [[New Orleans Saints]] and [[New York Jets]] from 1974 to 1978.

==Early years==
Coleman was born in [[Toledo, Ohio]] in 1952,&lt;ref name=PFR/&gt; and grew up in that city's [[Old West End District (Toledo, Ohio)|Old West End]] neighborhood.  His mother, Dorothy Coleman, worked for the [[Department of Housing and Urban Development]], and his father, Augustus Coleman, worked as a [[skycap]] for [[United Airlines]] and as a janitor at a library.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

At the suggestion of teachers at his public school, who told his parents that Coleman was not sufficiently challenged, he transferred to [[St. John's Jesuit High School and Academy]].  He attended St. John's from 1966 to 1970 where he excelled in academics and sports.  Coleman was an All-City and All-State running back for St. John's and was recruited by multiple colleges to play football. He later recalled: "When it came time to select a university, I had about 20 coaches visiting the house, talking up their programs. I chose the University of Michigan. I received a full scholarship."&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|author=Don Coleman|title=Boss: Lessons From the Gridiron|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 17, 2010|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/18/jobs/18boss.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==University of Michigan==
Coleman enrolled at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1970 on a football scholarship. He played [[college football]] for the [[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan Wolverines]] under head coach [[Bo Schembechler]] from 1971 to 1973.  Coleman began the 1971 season as a backup [[Fullback (American football)|fullback]], but Schembechler moved him to [[defensive end]] in late September 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Michigan Shifts Coleman To End|newspaper=The Blade, Toledo, Ohio|date=September 29, 1971|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nMlOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3AEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7556,4727795&amp;dq=don-coleman+michigan&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=U-M's Grambau Making Comeback|newspaper=The Owosso Argus-Press|date=September 29, 1972|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nUkiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4aoFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=883,2976106&amp;dq=don-coleman+michigan&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Coleman played at defensive end from 1972 to 1973 and helped the Wolverines tie for first place in the [[Big Ten Conference]] both years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1972 Football Team|publisher=University of Michigan, Bentley Historical Library|url=http://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/fbteam/1972fbt.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1973 Football Team|publisher=University of Michigan, Bentley Historical Library|url=http://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/fbteam/1973fbt.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University of Michigan All-time Rosters Search Page |publisher=University of Michigan, Bentley Historical Library |url=http://141.211.39.65/allroster/fbsearch.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928200732/http://141.211.39.65/allroster/fbsearch.htm |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }}(Enter "Coleman" for last name and "Donald" for first name on the search page, and press enter)&lt;/ref&gt;  Although still listed as a defensive end, Schembechler described Coleman's role as follows in 1973: "In our defense we use a flop-end.

==Advertising career==
While recovering from football injuries, Coleman obtained an [[M.B.A.]] degree in marketing from [[Hofstra University]] in New York in 1976.&lt;ref name=Hist/&gt;  In 1978, he was hired as an assistant account executive at the [[Campbell-Ewald]] advertising agency in Detroit. He later recalled: "I was the only black person in account management in the office. It was boring work, but I was speedy and accurate, persevered and became a full account executive."&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;  In 1983, he became senior vice president and management supervisor on the [[Chevrolet]] account.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

Coleman next began a career in advertising directed to minority communities.  He was hired in 1983 as a senior vice president and account director for Burrell Advertising, a Chicago firm specializing in advertising to minorities.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

In 1988, he formed Don Coleman Associates, which became Don Coleman Advertising in 1991.  He sold a minority interest in the company and bought two additional agencies, one focused on the Asian-American market (Innovasia Communications) and one focused on the Hispanic market (Montemayor y Asociados).  He combined the companies into [[GlobalHue]], specializing in a culture based approach to marketing.   He is the chairman and chief executive of GlobalHue.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

In 2009, GlobalHue's capitalized billings were $833.7 million. The company has approximately 300 employees in [[Southfield, Michigan]] and New York City.

In 2009, Coleman launched The Coleman Entrepreneurial Scholarship (CES), which strives to promote entrepreneurship as a career choice among college students of ethnic backgrounds, particularly African-American and Hispanic.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blackenterprise.com/b-e-100s-rename-test/be100s-news/2009/02/03/advertising-mogul-creates-scholarship-to-promote-entrepreneurialism/&lt;/ref&gt;  CES awards $50,000 in scholarships annually.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.targetmarketnews.com/storyid02040903.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European Committee for Banking Standards''' ('''ECBS''') was formed in December 1992  by leading [[European Banking Federation|European banking associations]] to enhance the European technical banking infrastructure by developing standards.

The '''Figaro Coffee Company''' (Figaro) is a [[Philippine]] coffee company and [[List of coffeehouse chains|coffeehouse chain]]. Figaro works on the [[franchising|franchise model]]. {{As of|September 2013}}, it had 55 outlets in Philippines, [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Papua New Guinea]]. The company does not own roasting facilities, but rather employs the facilities of a sister company, Boyd’s Coffee Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nuguid-Anden|first=Charmaine|title=Figaro Coffee Company Case Study|publisher=U.N Volunteers - New Academy of Business|location=UK|page=4|url=http://www.bitc.org.uk/sites/default/files/kcfinder/files/Figaro_Coffee_Company.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jiao (3rd from left), together with the Filipino and expatriate staff members of Figaro in Qatar during the 2016 opening of a Figaro Coffee Shop in Doha.]]
Figaro was established in November 1993 by seven college friends&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Profile and past jobs - Reena Francisco|url=http://ph.linkedin.com/pub/reena-s-francisco/20/3b0/86b|publisher=Linked In|accessdate=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (including Pacita "Chit" Juan, who was the CEO of Figaro, and Reena S. Franciso, who became its COO till 2008) as a small kiosk in [[Glorietta]] mall ([[Makati]], [[Manila]]) selling fresh ground coffee and tea paraphernalia. Two of the founders, including Pacita Juan and Reena S. Franciso Pacita, were classmates at the [[University of the Philippines]], where Pacita had studied Hotel and Restaurant Administration. Pacita in her family business and then decided to start a coffee shop, something that she had earlier dabbled with while still in college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sanford|first=Alpha Miguel|title=Success story : Pacita Juan, entrepreneur|url=http://amsdaily.net/2012/10/13/success-story-pacita-juan-entrepreneur/|accessdate=5 September 2013|newspaper=A.M.S Daily|date=13 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Figaro - Official facebook page|url=https://www.facebook.com/figarocoffeecompany/info|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first outlet was called ''the'' ''"F" store'' and employed one managing partner and two employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Figaro Coffee Shop|url=http://www.franphil.com/figaro-coffee-shop-franchise/|publisher=www.franphil.com|accessdate=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shop had coffee and tea paraphernalia including fresh ground coffee beans. After a few trying initial months, the owners decided to give the coffee shop a name. In April 1994, the founders chose the name "[[wikt:Special:Search/figaro|Figaro]]", inspired by the opera ''[[Barber of Seville]]'', thus Figaro was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Figaro Coffee Company|url=http://www.figarocoffee.com/about.php|publisher=Official website - Figaro|accessdate=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pacita and her friends wanted to set up a place where "Filipinos can get the perfect coffee and all the necessary accoutrements for coffee making”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nuguid-Anden|first=Charmaine|title=Figaro Coffee Company Case Study|publisher=New Academy|location=UK|page=3|url=http://www.bitc.org.uk/sites/default/files/kcfinder/files/Figaro_Coffee_Company.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pacita subsequently became the CEO of Figaro, a position she retained till 2008 when the chain was sold to Jerry Liu, a Taiwanese businessman. Jose Fernando Alcantara took Pacita's place in 2008, followed by CrisMel Verano in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Reyes|first=Mary Anne|title=Row at Figaro|url=http://www.philstar.com/business/720836/row-figaro|accessdate=6 September 2013|newspaper=Phil Star|date=28 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reena remained the Chief Operating Officer till 2008.

In 1998, Pacita met Father Roger Bagao, a coffee farmer and priest from [[Tagaytay]] City who headed a farmers' coffee cooperative. In 1999, Figaro introduced Cafe [[Barako]], as part of the "Save the Barako" campaign. Around the same time, the Figaro foundation was set up, to help coffee farmers grow coffee profitably. In 2002, while at Figaro, Pacita became the President of the National Coffee Development Board (now Philippine Coffee Board Inc). After Figaro, Pacita went on to set up ECHOstore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ravanona|first=Anne|title=Interview with Pacita Juan|url=http://www.globalleaderpost.com/pacita-juan-president-echostore--president-womens-business-council.html |accessdate=5 September 2013|newspaper=Global Leader Post|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Figaro opened its first overseas outlet in Shanghai. By mid-2006, Figaro had grown to 53 outlets, most of which were in [[Metro Manila]], with two in [[Baguio]] and one in [[Davao City|Davao]]. In 2006 (and again in 2009), Figaro voiced plans on an [[IPO]] in [[Makati Stock Exchange]]; however, those did not materialise. In December 2006, Figaro opened its first branch in Cebu city, and opened another 12 stores in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Felix|first=Rocel|title=Figaro Coffee prepares for initial public offering|url=http://www.philstar.com/business/355008/figaro-coffee-prepares-initial-public-offering|accessdate=6 September 2013|newspaper=Phil Star|date=28 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2008 marked a turning point for Figaro, as Pacita and Reena left it, while the Tanseco family became its majority shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Figaro all set for expansion|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/150074/economy/figaro-all-set-for-expansion-minor-owner-say-plan-contestable|accessdate=6 September 2013|newspaper=GMA Network|date=24 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the company underwent financial restructuring and closed some of its overseas branches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Go|first=Marianne|title=Figaro needs P200 million to pay debts|url=http://www.philstar.com/business/494838/figaro-needs-p200-million-pay-debts|accessdate=6 September 2013|newspaper=Phil Star|date=12 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Finance sidebar}}

'''Financial risk''' is any of various types of [[risk]] associated with [[finance|financing]], including [[financial transaction]]s that include company loans in risk of [[default (finance)|default]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financialrisk.asp#axzz1b9QLCKIO|accessdate=1 October 2011|publisher=Investopedia|title=Financial Risk: Definition | date = 2018-03-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/hmwsw/financial_risk|publisher=Credo Reference|year=2003|title=In Wall Street Words | accessdate = 1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often it is understood to include only [[downside risk]], meaning the potential for financial loss and uncertainty about its extent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Quantitative risk management: concepts, techniques and tools|first1=Alexander J.|last1=McNeil|first2=Rüdiger|last2=Frey|first3=Paul|last3=Embrechts|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-691-12255-7|pages=2–3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Essentials of financial risk management|first1=Karen A.|last1=Horcher|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=2005|isbn=978-0-471-70616-8|pages=1–3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A science has evolved around [[financial risk management|managing market and financial risk]] under the general title of [[modern portfolio theory]] initiated by Dr. [[Harry Markowitz]] in 1952 with his article, "Portfolio Selection".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Markowitz|first=H.M.|date=March 1952|title=Portfolio Selection|journal=The [[Journal of Finance]]|volume=7|issue=1|pages=77–91|doi=10.2307/2975974|jstor=2975974}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In modern portfolio theory, the [[variance]] (or [[standard deviation]]) of a portfolio is used as the definition of risk.

==Types==

===Asset-backed risk===
Asset-backed risk is the risk that changes in one or more assets that support an [[asset-backed security]] will significantly impact the value of the supported security.  Risks include interest rate, term modification, and [[Prepayment of loan|prepayment]] risk.

===Credit risk===
{{Main|Credit risk}}

Credit risk, also called ''default risk'', is the risk associated with a borrower going into [[default (finance)|default]] (not making payments as promised).  Investor losses include lost [[principal sum|principal]] and [[interest]], decreased [[cash flow]], and increased [[collection cost]]s.  An investor can also assume credit risk through direct or indirect use of [[Leverage (finance)|leverage]].  For example, an investor may purchase an investment using [[Margin (finance)|margin]].  Or an investment may directly or indirectly use or rely on [[Repurchase agreement|repo]], forward commitment, or [[Derivative (finance)|derivative]] instruments.

===Foreign investment risk===
Foreign investment risk is the risk of rapid and extreme changes in value due to: smaller markets; differing [[Accountancy|accounting]], [[Financial statement|reporting]], or [[Financial audit|auditing]] standards; [[nationalization]], [[Confiscation|expropriation]] or confiscatory taxation; [[Economic sanctions|economic conflict]]; or political or diplomatic changes.  Valuation, liquidity, and regulatory issues may also add to foreign investment risk.

===Liquidity risk===
{{Main|Liquidity risk}}
{{See also|Liquidity}}

This is the risk that a given security or asset cannot be traded quickly enough in the market to prevent a loss (or make the required profit). There are two types of liquidity risk:
*''Asset liquidity'' – An asset cannot be sold due to lack of liquidity in the market – essentially a sub-set of market risk.  This can be accounted for by:
**Widening [[bid-offer spread]]
**Making explicit liquidity reserves
**Lengthening holding period for [[value at risk|VaR]] calculations
*''Funding liquidity'' – Risk that liabilities:
**Cannot be met when they fall due
**Can only be met at an uneconomic price
**Can be name-specific or [[systemic risk|systemic]]

===Market risk===
{{Main|Market risk}}

The four standard market risk factors are equity risk, interest rate risk, currency risk, and commodity risk:
* [[Equity risk]] is the risk that [[share price|stock prices]] in general (not related to a particular company or industry) or the [[implied volatility]] will change.
* [[Interest rate risk]] is the risk that [[interest rate]]s or the implied volatility will change.
* [[Currency risk]] is the risk that [[exchange rate|foreign exchange rates]] or the implied volatility will change, which affects, for example, the value of an asset held in that currency.
* [[Commodity risk]] is the risk that [[commodity]] prices (e.g. corn, copper, crude oil) or implied volatility will change.

===Operational risk===
{{Main|Operational risk}}
Operational risk means the risk that a company or individual has to face due their own operation and decisions made for the investment

===Other risks===
*[[Reputational risk]]
*[[Legal risk]]
*[[IT risk]]

===Model risk===
{{Main|Model risk}}

==Diversification==

{{Main|Diversification (finance)}}

Financial risk, market risk, and even inflation risk can at least partially be moderated by forms of [[diversification (finance)|diversification]].

The returns from different assets are highly unlikely to be perfectly correlated and the correlation may sometimes be negative. For instance, an increase in the price of oil will often favour a company that produces it,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7535787.stm | work=BBC News | title=Another record profit for Exxon | date=31 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but negatively impact the business of a firm such an airline whose variable costs are heavily based upon fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/05/16/idUKN16550720110516 | work=Reuters | first=John | last=Crawley | title=U.S. airline shares up as oil price slides | date = 16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, share prices are driven by many factors, such as the general health of the economy which will increase the correlation and reduce the benefit of diversification.
If one constructs a portfolio by including a wide variety of equities, it will tend to exhibit the same risk and return characteristics as the market as a whole, which many investors see as an attractive prospect, so that [[index fund]]s have been developed that invest in equities in proportion to the weighting they have in some well-known index such as the FTSE.

However, history shows that even over substantial periods of time there is a wide range of returns that an index fund may experience; so an index fund by itself is not "fully diversified". Greater diversification can be obtained by diversifying across asset classes; for instance a portfolio of many bonds and many equities can be constructed in order to further narrow the dispersion of possible portfolio outcomes.

A key issue in diversification is the [[correlation]] between assets, the benefits increasing with lower correlation. However this is not an observable quantity, since the future return on any asset can never be known with complete certainty. This was a serious issue in the [[late-2000s recession]] when assets that had previously had small or even negative correlations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.eurojournals.com/irjfe_35_14.pdf|title=The Impacts of Extreme Events of Dynamic Interactions on Interest Rate, Real House Price and Stock Markets|journal=International Research Journal of Finance &amp; Economics|year=2010|issue=35|p=187|author1=Hsiu-Jung Tsai|author2=Ming-Chi Chen|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930040053/http://www.eurojournals.com/irjfe_35_14.pdf|archivedate=2011-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; suddenly starting moving in the same direction causing severe financial stress to market participants who had believed that their diversification would protect them against any plausible market conditions, including funds that had been explicitly set up to avoid being affected in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://web.mit.edu/Alo/www/Papers/august07.pdf | title=What Happened To The Quants In August 2007?∗ | author=Amir E. Khandani|author2=Andrew W. Lo | year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diversification has costs. Correlations must be identified and understood, and since they are not constant it may be necessary to rebalance the portfolio which incurs transaction costs due to buying and selling assets. 
There is also the risk that as an investor or fund manager diversifies, their ability to monitor and understand the assets may decline leading to the possibility of losses due to poor decisions or unforeseen correlations.

==Hedging==
{{Main|Hedge (finance)}}
[[Hedge (finance)|Hedging]] is a method for reducing risk where a combination of assets are selected to offset the movements of each other.
For instance, when investing in a stock it is possible to buy an option to sell that stock at a defined price at some point in the future. The combined portfolio of stock and option is now much less likely to move below a given value. As in diversification there is a cost, this time in buying the option for which there is a premium. [[Derivative (finance)|Derivatives]] are used extensively to mitigate many types of risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagofed.org/webpages/publications/understanding_derivatives/index.cfm|title=Understanding Derivatives: Markets and Infrastructure - Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago|website=www.chicagofed.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globally, [[India]] ranks as the 2nd largest freelance workforce after the US with over 15 million people working independently in various sectors such as [[Information technology|IT]] and [[Programming language|programming]], finance, sales and marketing, designing, animation, videography, content and [[academic writing]]. By 2020, 50% of workers are expected to go freelance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/60-of-freelancers-in-india-are-under-30/articleshow/64743696.cms|title=Infographic: 60% of freelancers in India are under 30 - Times of India|website=The Times of India|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Government  ==
There has not been much effort from India's government towards assisting freelancers until recently when it set up the ''Digital India Platform'' (DIP), an initiative to digitalize all government documents and where freelancers would be hired to help carry out the task. Anyone with a knowledge of computers, has access to the Internet and owns a valid Aadhar card would be eligible to apply for this freelance opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Miles. The Principles Of Successful Freelancing. 1st ed., Collingwood, Vic., Sitepoint, 2008,.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economic contributions ==
India has about 15 million freelancers&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mbopartners.com/uploads/files/state-of-independence-reports/2016_MBO_Partners_State_of_Independence_Report.pdf. America's Independents: A Rising Economic Force]. MBO Partners, Inc, Herndon, Virginia, 2016,&lt;/ref&gt; and they have been significantly boosting the growth of start-ups. While fostering the start-up economy in the country, Indian freelancers are also increasingly providing expertise to top-drawer corporations as business environments and needs evolve.&lt;ref&gt;Indian Companies Say I Do To The Freelance Economy. FlexingIt, New Delhi, 2016,.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Female Indian freelance workers ==
There are numerous highly educated women armed with masters and doctorate degrees in India who cannot pursue a regular occupation due to family and social obligations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/jobs/heres-why-freelancers-are-in-great-demand/articleshow/54538358.cms|title=Here’s why freelancers are in great demand - The Economic Times|newspaper=The Economic Times|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rather than cutting short their professional careers, these women seek out freelancing options.

Despite freelancing providing a viable career option for women looking for flexibility and control the number of Indian women taking up freelancing is still small as compared to their male counterparts. In a survey conducted by Payoneer, a payments services provider based in New York in 2015, only 22 per cent of Indian freelancers are women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/tech/tech-internet-combine-to-create-unconventional-career-options/story-1kHKXGcYpUiEMgyTYT9nNO.html|title=Thanks to internet, India has most freelance professionals after US|last=|first=|date=2015-12-07|work=|newspaper=Hindustan Times|language=en|access-date=2017-01-31|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only this but the same report reveals that women are paid lesser than the men who freelance. While a male freelancer earns $19 per hour on an average, a female freelancer apparently earns $17 per hour for the same project.&lt;ref name="Scroll.in"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://scroll.in/article/720242/work-more-earn-less-four-charts-sum-up-the-economics-of-freelancing-in-india|title=Work more, earn less: four charts sum up the economics of freelancing in India|last=Jain|first=Mayank|newspaper=Scroll.in|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Companies and freelancers ==
The distinct shifts in areas like technology, culture, demographics and professional needs and goals have driven companies to reassess their human resource policies in order to accommodate the burgeoning freelance economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/jobs/heres-why-freelancers-are-in-great-demand/articleshow/54538358.cms|title=Here’s why freelancers are in great demand - The Economic Times|newspaper=The Economic Times|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; It comes as no surprise that the start-ups in India are hiring 50 per cent of the total freelancing workforce. These companies are not only hiring freelancers or independent consultants at lower management. In fact, freelance CFO’s are also getting on board in order to help streamline a company’s finances. According to industry estimates, hiring their services of an outsourced CFO can result in operational savings of 30 to 70 per cent and depending upon the nature of the job, fees charged can range from Rs 30,000 to a few lakhs per month.&lt;ref&gt;Nilika Mehrotra (2013), Disability, gender and caste intersections in Indian economy, in Sharon N.

'''Humberto González''' (born March 25, 1966) is a Mexican former world [[boxing]] champion. He held the WBC three times, IBF and Lineal Jr. Flyweight titles. He was nicknamed ''Chiquita''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/jrfly.htm|title=Humberto "Chiquita" Gonzalez - Lineal Junior Flyweight Champion|publisher=The Cyber Boxing Zone Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Professional career ==
Gonzalez made his professional boxing debut on September 1, 1984 in [[Mexico City]] with a four round decision win over [[Jorge Ortega Perez]]. Little over three months later, he had his first [[knockout]] win, as he beat [[Narciso Perez]] in the first round.

The win over Perez began a streak of 18 knockout wins in a row for Gonzalez, mostly against little known Mexican opposition. The streak lasted until September 26, 1987, when he outpointed Mexican Jr. Flyweight champion [[Jorge Cano (boxer)|Jorge Cano]] over 12 rounds to win the national title in [[Cancún]].

In 1988, he won four fights, all by knockout. He retained the national belt against [[Jose Luis Zepeda]] in six rounds at [[Tijuana]], and [[Javier Vazquez (boxer)|Javier Vazquez]], beaten in five at Mexico City.

His next fight, on June 25, 1989, brought two ''firsts'' to his career: Celebrated in [[Chonju]], [[South Korea]], it was his first fight abroad. Being for the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] world Jr. Flyweight championship, it was also his first world title try. Gonzalez outpointed world champion [[Yul-Woo Lee]] over 12 rounds to crown himself world champion. On December 9, he again fought in South Korea, retaining his world championship against former world champion [[Jung-Koo Chang]] by a decision in 12.

In 1990, Gonzalez retained the title four times, including a win against future champion [[Francisco Tejedor]], but on December 19, he suffered a shocking defeat to [[Rolando Pascua]], a boxer who was unknown to most boxing experts, in [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]]. The knockout in round five suffered by Gonzalez that night cost him the world title.

After a win in 1991, Gonzalez recovered the world title, by defeating the man who had taken the world championship away from Pascua: [[Melchor Cob Castro]]. Gonzalez and Castro met on June 3 at [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], and Gonzalez won a 12 round decision.

In 1992, he retained the title four times, beating Castro in a rematch, [[Domingo Sosa (boxer)|Domingo Sosa]] and former world champion [[Napa Kiatwanchai]] among others.

By then, talks about a ''superfight'' between him and [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] world champion [[Michael Carbajal]] were common among boxing fans. The fight, which came on March 13, 1993, was the first million-dollar fight in Jr. Flyweight boxing history (both fighters were guaranteed one million [[US dollars|dollars]] in earnings) and also the first Jr. Flyweight fight in history to head a [[Pay Per View]] boxing card. In front of many [[Hollywood]] stars and thousands of fans at the arena, Gonzalez dropped Carbajal in rounds two and five, but Carbajal recovered to knock Gonzalez out in round seven. He finished the year with two ten round decision wins, including one against [[Pablo Tiznado]], a boxer who also fought against [[Alex Sánchez (boxer)|Alex Sanchez]].

Carbajal and Gonzalez met in a rematch February 19, 1994 at Inglewood, and the second time around, Gonzalez became a three time world Jr. Flyweight champion by beating Carbajal by decision in 12. With that win, he joined an exclusive group of boxers who have been world champions three times or more in the same division, alongside such others as [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Carlos De León]], [[Evander Holyfield]] and [[Sugar Ray Robinson]]. Gonzalez won two more fights, one a non-title bout, and the other a title defense versus [[Juan Domingo Córdoba]]. Then, on November 12 of the same year, he and Carbajal had a rubber match, this time in Mexico City. Gonzalez again prevailed, on points over 12 rounds.

After retaining the title once in 1995, on July 15 of that year, he fought for the last time. Again, he dropped his rival, [[Saman Sorjaturong]], a couple of times before being knocked out in round seven to lose his world title.

== Retirement ==
Immediately after the fight with Sorjaturong, he announced he was retiring, to pursue another dream of his: to become a successful businessman in Mexico City. Gonzalez had a record of 43 wins and 3 losses as a professional boxer, with 30 wins by knockout.

== Life after boxing ==
Gonzalez has stayed retired ever since, and he has been able to open three meat markets in Mexico. He is a part-time butcher in his shops, and has been able to reach the business success he dreamed about.

== Trivia ==
His first fight with Carbajal and his fight with Sorjaturong were both chosen as 1995's [[Fight of the Year]] by ''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]''. ''The Ring'' also placed Carbajal and Gonzalez on their list of the 100 greatest punchers of all time.

Both Humberto González and former rival Michael Carbajal were elected into the [[International Boxing Hall of Fame]] in 2006.

He earned many admirers during his professional boxing career. [[Women's boxing|Female boxer]] [[Delia Gonzalez]] was one of them, and is nicknamed ''Chikita'' after Humberto.

Educated at Parsons School of Design in New York, he joined [[Grey Global Group|Grey Advertising]] New York where he was employed as an art director working on national and international businesses in the realm of print, television and radio. While at Grey NY he worked on campaigns for Kohler, American Museum of Natural History, Bloomingdales, Domino's Pizza and Mitsubishi, amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/18/business/advertising-kohler-chooses-grey.html]&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=February 2012}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/28/business/media-business-advertising-domino-s-pizza-gives-grey-second-chance-deliver.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

He then joined relatively new startup Ryan Partnership started by ex Marketing Corporation of America executive David Ryan. There he earned awards and praise&lt;ref&gt;[http://promomagazine.com/mag/marketing_desperately_seeking_creativity/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt; as he worked on the Pepsi business focusing on the new youth market being identified as "Generation Next" and working with Sir Richard Branson&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Branson]]&lt;/ref&gt; and Simon Wright launching Virgin Megastores in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gemusic.com/portfolio/portfolio_commercials.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ryanpartnership.com/about_us_leadership.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301052008/http://www.ryanpartnership.com/about_us_leadership.aspx |archivedate=2012-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He then joined the startup cable network [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] in New York&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120712124831/http://1057crushfm.com/remember-fx-in-1994-video/]&lt;/ref&gt; as a writer/producer, which was new concept in television programming. The entire network took place live within one large apartment located downtown in New York City, switching between rooms for different shows and dayparts.

After a relatively short term of one year, he joined the agency Fusion 5 as creative director.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/10/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-people-008940.html?scp=6&amp;sq=Sequenzia&amp;st=cse]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 he was hired by [[Cyrk (company)|Cyrk]] to be the creative director of their newly formed marketing arm based in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://promomagazine.com/news/marketing_whos_news_4/]&lt;/ref&gt; There he worked on initiating consumer loyalty programs for Marlboro, FUSA, MasterCard, McDonald's and the Pepsi-Stuff program&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising/cyrk-intends-acquire-arnold-communications-23490]&lt;/ref&gt; Additional clients included [[Howard Schultz]], aiding [[Starbucks]] in their loyalty program, and forming a new venture with NBA basketball player [[Shaquille O'Neal]] called "TWISM" ("the world is mine").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Shaquille+O%27Neal%27s+clothing+company,+TWIsM,+hires+executive+vice...-a019085507]&lt;/ref&gt; This led to Cyrk being named PROMO magazine's '''Agency of the Year''' in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chiefmarketer.com/agencies/agencies-whos-news-4]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sequenzia was then hired by Interpublic Group's Draft Worldwide [[Draft Worldwide]] (now DraftFCB) as executive vice president, executive creative director of Draft NY,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/17/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-people-402303.html]&lt;/ref&gt; under the condition that he run, then shut down their now fledgling acquisition of Marketing Corporation of America through the end of the buyout term of eighteen months.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/17/business/the-media-business-advertising-addenda-people-402303.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Living in [[New York City]] and witnessing the [[September 11 attacks]] he had a life changing moment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.911memorial.org/cobblestone-donors]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legacy.com/guestbooks/guestbook.aspx?n=louis-inghilterra&amp;pid=102251#sthash.fGpjZjZf.dpbs]&lt;/ref&gt; He quit Draft the next day and began his own pursuit, ultimately founding '''milk'''* initially in New York, then moving the agency to Connecticut in 2003.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4097">'''Kevin Malloy''' (born 1965) is an advertising executive currently based in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]] but with international roles.&lt;ref name="Malloy"&gt;[http://www.sharechat.co.nz/article/ad944578/auckland-as-hq.html  Vincent Heeringa, "Auckland as HQ", ''Sharechat'', Sunday 1st February 2004.] (Retrieved 30 August 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; He is responsible for [[Starcom MediaVest Group]]'s (SMG) [[Coca-Cola]] assignments globally and is also the [[VivaKi]] Country Chair responsible for Starcom, [[ZenithOptimedia]] and [[Razorfish (company)|Razorfish]] across [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref name="Vivaki"&gt;[http://www.vivaki.com/leadership/kevin-malloy Vivaki,''Our Global Leadership''] (Retrieved 30 August 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Malloy is from [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]]. He was educated at [[St Peter's College, Auckland|St Peter's College]]. As  a 21-year-old Malloy left for [[London]], and ended up in the [[advertising agency]] [[Publicis|DMB&amp;B]] where he spent nine years, six of which were in the "International Media" operation. In 1994 he was moved to [[Hong Kong]] as Regional Media Director and after two years was sent to [[New York City]] to be groomed for a role as Worldwide Media Director. Malloy returned home at the end of 2002 after six years in New York and 17 years away. From his [[Auckland]] base he still looks after the global assignment for [[Coca-Cola]] and oversees [[Publicis Groupe]]'s media and digital operations across [[New Zealand]] and [[Australia]].&lt;ref name="Malloy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vivaki"/&gt;

==International management==
Before the formation of [[MediaVest]], Malloy held the position of Executive Vice President, Worldwide Media Director at D’Arcy. He was a key member of the D’Arcy media team that won the [[P&amp;G]] AOR assignment in the [[United States|U.S.]] – at the time the biggest advertising assignment in history (US$1.2 billion). He spent a total of six years in [[New York City]].

Prior to moving to New York in 1996, Malloy spent two years at D’Arcy’s [[Hong Kong]] office as regional media director for Asia-Pacific. Before that, Malloy was based in D’Arcy [[London]] for nine years. During that time, he spent three years working in the [[United Kingdom]] operation before taking on full [[Europe]]an media responsibilities for such multi-national clients as [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] (P&amp;G), [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]], [[Mars Inc.|Mars]] and [[Philips]].

After seventeen years abroad, Malloy relocated back to [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]] in December 2002 where he initially continued to play a key role for [[Starcom MediaVest Group]] by maintaining his global role on both P&amp;G and [[Coca-Cola]] while overseeing SMG’s operations in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]. In October 2008 Malloy was asked to take on the newly formed position of [[VivaKi]] Chair for [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]. This role encompassed [[Starcom MediaVest Group|SMG]] and [[ZenithOptimedia]] in these markets and required the launch of [[Publicis Groupe]]’s key digital asset [[Digitas]]. Malloy has now dropped his role on P&amp;G with the expanded [[VivaKi]] requirements but continues to travel extensively as he continues to lead [[Starcom MediaVest Group|SMG]]’s global efforts on [[Coca-Cola]].

Malloy’s international career has involved numerous speaking engagements and industry recognition. In 1998, he was named one of [[Advertising Age]]’s worldwide ‘Media Innovators’ following Media and Marketing Europe’s designation as one of the world’s ‘Top 40 Under 40’ media people in 1997. Malloy has also contributed to such publications as [[Advertising Age International]], [[A&amp;M Magazine]], [[Media Magazine]] and [[The Economist]].&lt;ref name="Malloy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vivaki"/&gt;

'''Koo Hsien-jung''' ({{zh|c=辜顯榮|p=Gū Xiǎnróng|w=Ku&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Hsien&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-jung&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|poj=Ko͘ Hián-êng}}; [[Romaji]]: Kō Ken’ei; 2 February 1866 &amp;ndash; 9 December 1937) was a [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] businessman and politician who enjoyed strong links to the colonial administration of [[Taiwan under Japanese rule]].  He founded the [[Koos Group]] of companies, the largest business group in Taiwan.

Koo was a businessman at the time of the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] in which [[Qing dynasty]] China ceded Taiwan to Japan.  When the Japanese forces [[Japanese invasion of Taiwan (1895)|arrived in Taiwan]] in 1895, Koo initiated contact with the Japanese forces in [[Keelung]] and urged them to enter [[Taipei]] to restore order.

Koo's close links to the Japanese allowed him both to pursue a successful political career (he became the first Taiwanese to be appointed by the emperor to the [[Japanese House of Peers|House of Peers]] of Japan, in 1934) and to build a collection of businesses that formed the nucleus of today's Koos Group of companies.

Koo had four [[concubine]]s, eight sons and four daughters.  His fifth son, [[Koo Chen-fu]], inherited control of his father's business and served as the negotiator for Taiwan during the [[Wang–Koo summit]].  His eighth son, [[Koo Kwang-ming]], became a leader of the [[Taiwan Independence]] movement. His grandson is [[Richard Koo]], an economist specializing in [[Recession#Balance sheet recession|balance sheet recession]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7514">'''Leaching''' is the process of extracting substances from a [[solid]] by dissolving them in a [[liquid]], either naturally or through an [[industrial process]]. In the [[chemical process]]ing industry, leaching has a variety of commercial applications, including [[Separation technique|separation]] of [[metal]] from [[ore]] using [[acid]], and [[sugar]] from [[sugar beet]]s using hot [[water]].

Another term for this is lixiviation, or the extraction of a soluble particle from its constituent parts&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Oliva P. Canencia |author2=angelo Mark P. Walag |title= Coal Combustion from Power Plant Industry Inmisamis Oriental, Philippines: a Potential Groundwater Contamination and Heavy Metal Detection |journal=Asian Journal of Microbiology, Biotechnology &amp; Environmental Sciences |volume=18 |issue=1 |year=2016 |pages=55–59 |issn=0972-3005 |url=https://www.academia.edu/24631111/Coal_Combustion_from_Power_Plant_Industry_in_Misamis_Oriental_Philippines_A_Potential_Groundwater_Contamination_and_Heavy_Metal_Detection |access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{not in citation|date=April 2016}}&lt;!-- the word "lixiviation" is not used in the referenced article --&gt;.

In a typical leaching operation, the solid mixture to be separated consists of particles, [[Chemically inert|inert]] insoluble carrier A and [[Solution|solute]]&amp;nbsp;B. The [[solvent]],&amp;nbsp;C, is added to the mixture to selectively dissolve&amp;nbsp;B. The overflow from the stage is free of solids and consists of only solvent C and dissolved&amp;nbsp;B. The underflow consists of slurry of liquid of similar composition in the liquid overflow and solid carrier&amp;nbsp;A. In an ideal leaching [[wikt: equilibrium| equilibrium]] stage, all the solute is dissolved by the solvent; none of the carrier is dissolved. The mass ratio of the solid to liquid in the underflow is dependent on the type of equipment used and properties of the two phases.

Leaching is the process by which inorganic, organic contaminants or radionuclides are released from the solid phase into the water phase under the influence of mineral [[dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]], [[desorption]], [[complexation]] processes as affected by pH, [[redox]], dissolved organic matter and (micro)[[biological activity]]. The process itself is universal, as any material exposed to contact with water will leach components from its surface or its interior depending on the [[porosity]] of the material considered.

One such reaction is:
:Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S + 4NaCN → 2Na[Ag(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] + Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S

==Leaching processes for biological substances==

Many biological organic and inorganic substances occur in a mixture of different components in a solid. In order to separate the desired solute constituent or remove an undesirable solute component from the solid phase, the solid is brought into contact with a liquid. The solid and liquid are in contact, and the solute or solutes can diffuse from the solid into the solvent, resulting in separation of the components originally in the solid. This separation process is called ''liquid-solid leaching'' or simply ''leaching''. Because in leaching the solute is being extracted from the solid this is also called ''extraction''. In leaching, when an undesirable component is removed from a solid with water, the process is called ''washing''.&lt;ref name=Geankoplis&gt;{{cite book|last=Geankoplis|first=Christie|title=Transport Process and Separation Principles|year=2004|publisher=Pretence Hall|location=NJ|isbn=978-0-13-101367-4|pages=802–817}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the biological and food processing industries, many products are separated from their original natural structure by liquid-solid leaching. An important process for example is the leaching of sugar from [[sugar beet]]s with hot water. In the production of vegetable oils, organic solvents such as [[hexane]], [[acetone]], or [[ether]] are used to extract oil from nuts, beans, and seeds.

In the pharmaceutical industry, many different pharmaceutical products are obtained by leaching plant roots, leaves, and stems.&lt;ref name=Geankoplis/&gt;

==Leaching processes for inorganic and organic materials==
Leaching is extensively used in metal processing industries. The useful metal may occur in mixtures with very large amounts of undesirable constituents, and leaching is used to remove the metals as soluble salts.&lt;ref name=Geankoplis/&gt; The use of acids is prevalent in the metal processing industry. [[Sulfate]]s are normally used to remove metals from the solid phase.  These processes result in harmful sulfate-rich environmental byproducts. Because acids solubilize metals, large-scale release of heavy-metal-rich acidic mine drainage (AMD) can thereby occur.

==Shrinking-core model==
As mentioned above when leaching a solid with a liquid the desired solid goes to the liquid phase while undesired solid remains. The removal of the solid as the liquid dissolves into the particle leads to a diameter of unleached core that shrinks with time. A mathematical model can be used for this process, derived using [[Fick's law of diffusion]] taking pore diffusion as rate limiting step:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Seader and Henley|first=J.D. and Ernest J.|title=Separation Process Principles|year=2001|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons inc.|location=U.K|isbn=978-0-471-46480-8|pages=639–641}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;t=\frac{\rho _Br_s^2}{6D_ebM_Bc_{A_b}} \left[ 1-3 \left(\frac{r_c}{r_s}\right)^2 + 2 \left(\frac{r_c}{r_s}\right)^3 \right]&lt;/math&gt;

==Environmentally friendly leaching==
Some recent work has been done to see if organic acids can be used to leach [[lithium]] and [[cobalt]] from spent [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] with some success. Experiments performed with varying temperatures and concentrations of [[malic acid]] show that the optimal conditions are 2.0 m/L of organic acid at a temperature of 90 °C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Li|first=Li|author2=Jing Ge |author3=Renjie Chen |author4=Feng Wu |author5=Shi Chen |author6=Xiaoxiao Zhang |title=Environmental friendly leaching reagent for cobalt and lithium recovery|journal=International Journal of Integrated Waste Management, Science and Technology|date=March 16, 2010|volume=30|series=Waste Management|issue=12|pages=2615–2621|url=http://www.journals.elsevier.com/waste-management/#description|accessdate=December 22, 2011|doi=10.1016/j.wasman.2010.08.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reaction had an overall efficiency exceeding 90% with no harmful byproducts.

:4 LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(solid) + 12 C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(liquid) → 4 LiC&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(liquid) + 4 Co(C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(liquid) + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(liquid) + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(gas)

The same analysis with [[citric acid]] showed similar results with an optimal temperature and concentration of 90 °C and 1.5 molar solution of citric acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Li|first=Li|author2=Jing Ge |author3=Feng Wu |author4=Renjie Chen |author5=Shi Chen |author6=Borong Wu |title=Recovery of cobalt and lithium from spent lithium ion batteries using organic citric acid as leachant|journal=Journal of Hazardous Materials|date=2010-04-15|volume=176|issue=1-3|pages=288–293|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030438940901810X|accessdate=December 22, 2011|doi=10.1016/j.jhazmat.2009.11.026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2450">'''Liquid logistics''' is a special category of [[logistics]] that relates to [[liquid]] products, and is used extensively in the "supply chain for liquids" discipline.

Standard logistics techniques are generally used for discrete or [[unit (measurement)|unit]] products.  Liquid products have logistics characteristics that distinguish them from discrete products.  Some of the major characteristics of liquid products that impact their logistics handling are:

* Liquids flowing from a higher level to a lower level provide the ability to move the liquids without mechanical propulsion or manual intervention.
* Liquids' adaptation to the shape of the container they are in provides a great deal of flexibility in the design of storage systems and the use of “dead” space for storage.
* The level of a liquid as it has settled in a tank may be used to automatically and continuously know the quantity of liquid in the tank.
* Liquids provide indications through changes in their characteristics that may be sensed and translated into measures of the quality of the liquid.
* Many security and safety risks are significantly reduced or eliminated using liquid logistics techniques. Tools such as liquid level sensors and flow meters can be useful in reducing security risk by providing directly,near real-time and accurate measurements of  product's movement and balance along the supply-chain flow. The safety risk is reducing as product movement through the process of supply stream is independent and controlled.
* Liquids may in some cases be "processed" well downstream from the original production facility and thus offer the opportunity for improved efficiencies throughout the supply stream together with more flexibility as to the nature of the product at the point of final usage.

Each of these points represents a differentiation of liquid logistics from logistics techniques used for discrete items.  When properly planned for and handled these points of differentiation may lead to business advantages for companies that produce, process, move, or use liquid products.

In the 1980s, he attempted to broker a peace deal in the Lebanese Civil War with his business partner [[Hani Salaam]].&lt;ref name="richest-arabs"/&gt;

Al Tajir has an extensive collection of silver artifacts and carpets.&lt;ref&gt;''The Glory of the Goldsmith: Magnificent Gold and Silver from the Al-Tajir Collection'', Christie's, 1989, {{ISBN|0903432366}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993 Al Tajir paid the record price for a piece of silver at auction, when he bought a 1736 silver chandelier made by Balthasar Friedrich Behrens for £2.27 million at [[Christie's]] in Monaco.&lt;ref name="grandmother-fraud"&gt;{{Cite news|date=7 December 1993|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/prints-fraud-led-by-grandmother-1465939.html|title=Prints fraud led by grandmother|work=[[The Independent]]|location=London|first=Dalya|last=Alberge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al Tajir formed a joint venture with [[Bonhams]] fine art auction house to open an office in Dubai.&lt;ref name="richest-arabs"/&gt;

==Business career==
Appointed head of customs in Dubai by [[Sheikh]] [[Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum]], he became one of Sheikh Rashid's most trusted advisors and was made the first Ambassador of the United Arab Emirates to the United Kingdom when the UAE was founded in 1971.&lt;ref name="richest-arabs"/&gt; Under a thinly disguised name, Al Tajir's exploits as a negotiator were recorded in the 1976 novel ''Dubai'' by [[Robin Moore]].&lt;ref name="richest-arabs"/&gt; In 1963 Al Tajir became director of Sheikh Rashid's Petroleum affairs and effectively the most powerful man in Dubai after Sheikh Rashid himself. Al Tajir lost or resigned his position in 1981 with the downfall of Sheikh Rashid's health and the waning of his personal power, with the ascedency of Shekih Rashid's sons. Al Tajir remained UAE ambassador to the United Kingdom until 1987. [http://www.ucc.ie/law/restitution/archive/englcases/dubai.htm]

In London in the late 1960s, the Egyptian businessman [[Mohamed Al-Fayed]] was introduced to Al Tajir by Salim Abu Alwan, an Iraqi businessman.&lt;ref name="Bower"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bower |first=Tom |title=Fayed: The Unauthorized Biography|page=43|publisher=Macmillan |year=1998|isbn=978-0-333-74554-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bower 1998, p.27.&lt;/ref&gt; Al Tajir informed Al-Fayed that Dubai was penniless and needed to borrow £1 million for the future construction of modern harbour facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Bower 1998, p.31.&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Fayed secured a loan of £9 million from Imre Rochlitz, an American lawyer. Rochlitz's Jewish ancestry caused embarrassment to Al Tajir, and later caused Rochlitz to reject Al-Fayed's offer of a formal partnership.&lt;ref&gt;Bower 1998, p.33.&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Fayed earned £1.5 million commission from the contract for British engineering company [[Costain Group|Costain]] to carry out the improvement works to the port. Al-Fayed also assisted with securing the financing for the [[Dubai World Trade Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;Bower 1998, p.36.&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid 1970s Costain had gained over £280 million of contracts thanks to Al-Fayed and Al Tajir.&lt;ref&gt;Bower 1998, p.50.&lt;/ref&gt; Al Tajir's influence in Dubai was waning by 1977, and Al-Fayed was excluded from the commission process for a new aluminium smelter, and the development of [[Jebel Ali]], putting Costain's future profits at risk.&lt;ref&gt;Bower 1998, p.71.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993 Al-Fayed was visited at his department store [[Harrods]] by [[Mohammed bin Ali Al Abbar|Mohammed Alabbar]], the director of Dubai's Department of Economic Development.&lt;ref&gt;Bower 1998, p.302.&lt;/ref&gt; Alabbar had been appointed by [[Sheikh Maktoum]] to eradicate the system of large commission payments from previous decades. Al Tajir was challenged in the British courts to repay his alleged excessive profits earned from the construction of Dubai's aluminum smelter, and Al-Fayed was targeted over his management contract of the [[Dubai World Trade Centre]].

The construction of Dubai's aluminium smelter caused Al Tajir to fall out with Sheikh Rashid’s sons.&lt;ref name="richest-arabs"/&gt; In the judgement of a British court case, Al Tajir conspired to defraud Dubai Aluminium of millions of dollars in connivance with commodities trader [[Marc Rich]], who owned a neighbouring property in Switzerland.&lt;ref name="richest-arabs"/&gt; 

Al Tajir owns a glass-bottling company in Dubai and a private bank in the [[tax haven]] of the [[Cayman Islands]].&lt;ref name="richest-arabs"/&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Morisada Matsudaira'''|松平 保定|Matsudaira Morisada|1926 – 9 Aug 2011}} was a Japanese businessman who was active in historical preservation. The grandson of [[Matsudaira Katamori]], he spent a fair amount of time in Aizu. Morisada was approached by the [[Imperial Household Agency]] in the late 1980s, with a request to serve as an official at the mourning ceremony for [[Emperor Hirohito]]; simultaneously, they expressed a desire to install him as chief priest of [[Yasukuni Shrine]]. Morisada declined the Yasukuni appointment, as the shrine was built to enshrine the soldiers of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] who died in the [[Boshin War]] and exclude those who fought against them, including men of the [[Aizu]], [[Sendai Domain|Sendai]], [[Nihonmatsu Domain|Nihonmatsu]], and [[Morioka Domain|Morioka]] domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{ja icon}} [http://www.zaikai21.co.jp/zaifuku/back/0306.html 財界21 福島の経済情報誌「財界ふくしま」&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008133552/http://www.zaikai21.co.jp/zaifuku/back/0306.html |date=2007-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morisada had one son, [[Morihisa Matsudaira]].&lt;ref&gt;Kobiyama Rokurō, ''Matsudaira Katamori no Shōgai: Shashinshu''. Tokyo: Shin Jinbutsu Ōraisha, 2003, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Politics-administration dichotomy''' is a theory that constructs the boundaries of [[public administration]] and asserts the normative relationship between elected officials and administrators in a democratic society.&lt;ref name="Svara 51–58"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Svara |first=James |date=Jan–Feb 1998 |title=The Politics-Administration Dichotomy Model as Aberration |journal=Public Administration Review |volume=58 |pages=51–58 |doi=10.2307/976889|jstor=976889 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase ''politics-administration dichotomy'' itself does not appear to have a known inventor, even after exhaustive research, the combination of words that make up the phrase was first found in [[public administration]] literature from the 1940s with no clear originator.&lt;ref&gt;Overeem, Patrick (2012).

== History ==

[[File:Thomas Woodrow Wilson, Harris &amp; Ewing bw photo portrait, 1919.jpg|thumbnail|right|Portrait of Woodrow Wilson 1919]]

[[Woodrow Wilson]] is credited with the politics-administration dichotomy via his theories on public administration in his 1887 essay, "[[The Study of Administration]]". Wilson came up with a theory that politics and administration are inherently different and should be approached as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Stillman, II |first=Richard |date=June 1973 |title=Woodrow Wilson and the Study of Administration |journal=The American Political Science Review |volume=67 |issue=2 |pages=582–588 |doi=10.2307/1958787|jstor=1958787 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson wrote in his essay in regards to [[public administration]]: “The field of administration is a field of business. It is removed from the hurry and strife of politics.... Administration lies outside the proper sphere of politics. Administrative questions are not political questions. Although politics sets the tasks for administration, it should not be suffered to manipulate its offices.”&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, W., 1887, “The Study of Administration”. Political Science Quarterly, Reprinted in 1997 in Classics of Public Administration, 2d ed. Shafritz, J, and Hyde, A, Chicago: Dorsey Press.&lt;/ref&gt; With these words, Wilson started a debate that has been going on for decades and continues to this day. The politics-administration dichotomy is an important concept in the field of public administration and shows no signs of going away because it deals with the policy-makers role as an administrator and the balancing act that is the relationship between politics and administration.&lt;ref&gt;Reza Tahmasebi &amp; Seyyed Mohammad Mahdi Musavi. (2011).
"Politics-Administration Dichotomy: A Century Debate," ''Revista Administratie Si Management Public'', Faculty of Administration and Public Management, Academy of Economic Studies, Bucharest, Romania, vol. 2011(17), pages 130-143, November 27, 2013. http://www.ramp.ase.ro/en/_data/files/articole/2011/17-09.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This essay is considered to be the first source to be analyzed and studied in the public administration field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Link|first=Arthur S.|title=Woodrow Wilson and the Study of Administration|journal=American Philosophical Society|date=December 9, 1968|volume=112|issue=6|pages=431–433}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson was primarily influenced by Richard Ely and Herbert Adams who taught at [[Johns Hopkins University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosser|first=Christian|title=Woodrow Wilson's Administrative Thought and German Political Theory|journal=Public Administration Review|date=July 1, 2010|volume=70|issue=4|pages=547–556|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6210.2010.02175.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Perceived Advantages ==

Woodrow Wilson’s politics-administration dichotomy can potentially be substantial in sustaining a strong productive government. The complexity, difficulty level and ample multiplication of governmental functions can be seen as a main component in the cause to implement the politics-administration dichotomy. Due to Wilson's lack of faith in republican self-government and the overwhelming amount of “selfish, ignorant, timid, stubborn, or foolish” persons whom the “bulk of can vote,” this model provides a solution that would counteract the majority of the incumbent voters. By employing the elite philosophical leaders to improve, shape, condition and sway public opinion, politics-administration dichotomy, if carried out in an unselfish manner leaves little to no room for error. 

Woodrow Wilson’s model created one of the first concepts of checks and balances, which is one of the most predominant systems of democratic accountability used to shape the United States government. Nevertheless “separating the will of the people from politics” could be extremely beneficial and institutionally separating administration from politics could prove valuable in sustaining government accountability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jewison|first=Blayne|date=Feb 1996|title=A Case For Reinterpreted Dichotomy of Politics and Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Woodrow|date=July 1887|title=The Study of Administration|journal=Political Science Quarterly}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Politics-administration dichotomy also leads to political neutrality. The blurring of "politics" and "policy" has cause to the advocations to dismiss "partisan politics" rather than "policy politics."
The importance of neutrality in politics and policy are established within the politics-administration dichotomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Overeem, |first=Patrick|title=THE VALUE OF THE DICHOTOMY: POLITICS, ADMINISTRATION, AND THE POLITICAL NEUTRALITY OF ADMINISTRATORS|journal=Administrative Theory &amp; Praxis (Administrative Theory &amp; Praxis).|date=June 2005|volume=27|issue=2|pages=311–329}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

Standard definition is too narrow . If [[politics]] includes all of what we know as policy making, then the dichotomy would bar administrators, presumably including city managers, from participation. The dichotomy of policy and administration was a conceptual distinction underlying a theory of democratic accountability. It was not intended to guide behavior, it was intended as a behavioral prescription directed against contemporary practices of machine politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Montjoy |first=Robert |last2=Watson |first2=Douglas |date=May–June 1995 |title=A Case for Reinterpreted Dichotomy of Politics and Administration as a Professional Standard in Council-Manager Government  |jstor=3110241  |journal=Public Administration Review |publisher=Wiley |volume=55 |issue=3 |pages=231–239 |doi=10.2307/3110241}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The strict definition is the model. It is not conceptually possible to have a one way dichotomy that keeps elected official out of administration but allows administrators to be active in policy. The dichotomy model standing alone is an aberration.&lt;ref name="Svara 51–58"/&gt;
{{quote|Arguably the father of American political administration, Wilson, in his essay '[[The Study of Administration]]', suggested that in order to have objectivity and progress, the administration must be separate from politics ... The political/administration dichotomy aimed to separate the power between political leaders and the merit-based appointment of professional permanent civil servants in the administrative state ... At the turn of the 20th century, the field focused on making the bureaucracy more effective ... The field’s basic premise was to take a business-like approach to government and its activities.&lt;ref name="blogspot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heydeesmeet.blogspot.com/2011/03/politicaladministrative-dichotomy.html|title=Urban-imagination: The political/administrative dichotomy|publisher=heydeesmeet.blogspot.com|accessdate=2014-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} By Wilson making the statement, "Government should be run like a business," he thereby opened up many loop holes for the capitalist society to exploit the government for things they didn’t actually have. This statement ends in a very dangerous uncharted territory for people now. Based on the fact government could be run like a business. The concept "everyone has a boss" with creating the business like mindset running our country it makes everyone have to answer to someone (higher on the totem pole) than the other, it creates a sense of working for your job when you are supposed to be working for the people whom you represent. So now, instead of implementing policy to help the people, administrators and politicians are more concerned about who is funding/appointing than they are worried about the common man. That isn’t just the biggest problem for Politic administration Dichotomy it is a huge problem for the sustainability of our government and the world.&lt;ref name="blogspot"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sagepub"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aas.sagepub.com/content/16/2/141.short|title=American Public Administration and the Idea of Reform|publisher=aas.sagepub.com|accessdate=2014-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="839">The '''Post-Capitalist Society''' (1993) is a book by management professor and sociologist [[Peter Drucker]].

==Overview==

The book states that the "[[First world|First World Nations]]" and in particular the [[United States]] have entered a [[Post-capitalism]] system of production where the capital is no longer present because it doesn't belong to one person or family but to a series of organizations such as insurance companies, banks, etc. Because of this, normal citizens become virtually owners of the great American enterprises, being owners of the capital, therefore, not destroying but overcoming the capitalism. The book foresees that the post-capitalist society will become a society of organizations where every organization will be highly specialized in its particular field.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10022">'''Pregnancy options counseling''' is a form of [[counseling]] that provides information and support regarding a women's [[pregnancy]]. Woman seeking pregnancy options counseling are typically doing so in the case of an unintended pregnancy. Limited access to birth control and family planning resources, as well as misuse of birth control are some of the major contributing factors to unintended pregnancies around the world. In 2012, the global rate of unintended pregnancies was estimated to be 40 percent, or eighty-five million pregnancies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sedgh|first=Gilda|last2=Singh|first2=Susheela|last3=Hussain|first3=Rubina|date=2017-03-27|title=Intended and Unintended Pregnancies Worldwide in 2012 and Recent Trends|journal=Studies in family planning|volume=45|issue=3|pages=301–314|doi=10.1111/j.1728-4465.2014.00393.x|issn=0039-3665|pmc=4727534|pmid=25207494}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pregnancy options counselors educate women about the different options that are available and help guide them to a decision on how to proceed with their pregnancy. The options include [[abortion]], [[adoption]], or [[parenting]]. The job of a pregnancy options counselor is to neither encourage nor discourage a woman’s particular decision, nor do they profit from the woman’s choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.contracept.org/options-counseling.php|title=Options Counseling for Pregnancy|website=www.contracept.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, they present unbiased information about each of the options non-judgmentally, then help the woman explore her feelings and come to a decision that fits her best based on her values, culture, future plans, etc. Pregnancy options counseling centers are not the same thing as [[crisis pregnancy center]]s, which may not provide unbiased information.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Abortion ==

One option that a woman with an unplanned pregnancy may consider is [[abortion]], the deliberate termination of a pregnancy. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), about 40–50 million abortions are performed worldwide each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldometers.info/abortions/|title=Abortion Statistics - Worldometers|website=www.worldometers.info|language=en|access-date=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 20 million of these abortions are considered unsafe and result in around 67,000 deaths each year.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/12/world/12abortion.html|title=Legal or Not, Abortion Rates Compare|last=Rosenthal|first=Elisabeth|date=12 October 2007|work=The New York Times|access-date=23 March 2017|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abortion rates are similar across countries despite its being legal in some and illegal in others. In other words, just as many women get abortions in countries where it is illegal as in countries where it is legal. The only difference is that they proceed with illegal abortions, which are more likely to be provided under unsafe conditions by poorly trained providers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A woman’s pregnancy options in regards to abortion would be presented differently by her counselor, depending on the country they are in. The [[Mexico City policy|Mexico City Policy]] is an example of governments restricting this aspect of pregnancy options counseling.

=== Worldwide abortion policies ===
Different countries have different abortion policies, which are based on the extent to which the unplanned pregnancy is affecting mother and fetus. 96 percent of countries allow abortions to save a woman whose life is at risk. Six countries in the world do not permit the termination of a pregnancy under any circumstance; that is 3% of the worlds countries that don't allow abortion at all. There are 50 countries (26%) that allow an abortion only if it is to save the mother’s life, 82 countries (42%) that allow abortion to save the mother’s life or for at least one of the following reasons: to preserve the woman’s physical health, to preserve the woman’s mental health, in the case of rape or incest, to avoid fetal impairment, or for economic or social reasons. Lastly, 58 countries (30%) allow abortions on request for any reason, though these countries usually do not allow the pregnancy to be terminated beyond a certain stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/10/06/how-abortion-is-regulated-around-the-world/|title=How abortion is regulated around the world|date=6 October 2015|work=Pew Research Center|access-date=23 March 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Types of abortion ===
Should a pregnant woman’s country allow her to get an abortion, a pregnancy counselor can help her to address the tough questions that might arise and give her information on the types of abortion. Once a woman has decided on abortion, there are two ways in which one can be induced. The first type of abortion is a medical abortion that involves the use of drugs. This option is only feasible within the first 9 weeks of pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.emedicinehealth.com/abortion/article_em.htm|title=Abortion: Get Facts About the Procedure and Statistics|work=eMedicineHealth|access-date=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that, the only other option is a surgical abortion which involves the removal of the placenta and fetus.

== Adoption ==
[[Adoption]] is a permanent, legal transfer of parental rights and responsibilities from  child’s birth parents to the adoptive parents. Pregnant women looking to place their child up for adoption have many options as to how much involvement they wish to have in choosing the adoptive parents and to some degree. Nonetheless, birthmothers choosing to put their child up for adoption are legally terminating their parental rights to the child. Adoption laws differ state by state; adoption agencies, counselors, and lawyers can be used to provide information to the birth parents and adoptive parents about this process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/pregnancy/pregnant-now-what/adoption|title=About Adoption {{!}} Placing Your Child for Adoption|website=www.plannedparenthood.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Types of adoption ===
There are two general types of adoption to choose from: [[closed adoption]], and [[open adoption]]. Closed adoptions are when the birthmother and adoptive parents have no contact with one another. In this case, the records of the biological parents are kept sealed.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://family.findlaw.com/adoption/open-vs-closed-adoption.html|title=Open vs. Closed Adoption - FindLaw|work=Findlaw|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Closed adoptions are becoming less common within the United States but are still prevalent in international adoptions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Open adoptions occur when the biological mother and adoptive parents chose to keep in touch, though the amount and type of contact varies case by case, depending on what both parties agree on.

== Choosing to parent ==

=== Prenatal care ===
If a pregnant woman seeking pregnancy options counseling is considering completing her pregnancy, whether it be in the case of adoption or that she is choosing to parent, her next step would be to start [[prenatal care]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/pregnancy/pregnant-now-what|title=Pregnancy Options {{!}} What To Do If You're Pregnant|website=www.plannedparenthood.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prenatal care is a type of [[Preventive healthcare|preventative healthcare]] which serves to prevent potential health problems and promote a healthy lifestyle during the pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://medlineplus.gov/prenatalcare.html|title=Prenatal Care {{!}} Prenatal Testing {{!}} MedlinePlus|access-date=2017-03-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lifestyle changes ===
If a mother choses to parent her child, she should also expect to make some lifestyle changes to ensure the health and safety of her unborn child. The suggested lifestyle changes include stopping the consumption of caffeine, alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana, recreational drugs, and prescription drugs. The mother is also encouraged to have a healthy diet and excursive regularly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://kidspot.co.nz/article+3344+116+Lifestyle-changes-during-pregnancy.htm|title=Lifestyle changes during pregnancy{{!}}First Trimester{{!}}Pregnancy - Kidspot New Zealand..|last=Australia|first=Kidspot New Zealand.. / Get Started|work=New Zealand|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Princess [[Lalla (title)|Lalla]] Hasna of Morocco''' ({{lang-ar|الأميرة لالة حسناء}}, born 19 November 1967 in Rabat) is the youngest daughter of [[Hassan II of Morocco|King Hassan II]] and his second wife, [[Lalla Latifa Hammou]]. She is sister to the current king, [[Mohammed VI of Morocco|Mohammed VI]] and [[Prince Moulay Rachid of Morocco|Prince Moulay Rachid]].

== Biography ==
{{BLP sources section|date=June 2018}}
She was educated at the Royal College (Rabat).

Since her childhood, Princess Hasna has been interested in social and cultural activities, with special emphasis to environmental issues in Morocco. In 1999 she launched the national campaign for the protection of the environment and gave the prize for the most beautiful and cleanest beach in Morocco.

To shore up her work, the Mohammed VI Foundation for the protection of the environment was created in 2001 and chaired by Princess Hasna. She presides over the governing board of the foundation and regularly pays on the terrain visits to sensitize the population about environmental issues.

In 2002, Princess Lalla Hasna set up the prize of young reporters for the environment and in 2003 a prize for photography annually awarded on the international environment day.

She is Honorary President of the Hassanate Association for Human Development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201209220001.html|title=Morocco: HRH Princess Lalla Hasnaa Persides Over Inauguration of Renovated Internal Medicine Service At Ibn Sina Hospital|date=2012-09-22|work=Maghreb Arabe Presse (Rabat)|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Silicon Glen''' is a nickname for the [[high tech]] sector of [[Scotland]], the name inspired by [[Silicon Valley]] in California. It is applied to the [[Central Belt]] triangle between [[Dundee]], [[Inverclyde]] and [[Edinburgh]], which includes [[Fife]], Glasgow and [[Stirling]]; although electronics facilities outside this area may also be included in the term.  The term has been in use since the 1980s.  It does not technically represent a ''[[glen]]'' as it covers a much wider area than just one valley.

==History==
[[Image:Advance Factories.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Swiss electronics company [[Micronas]] have a large site in [[Glenrothes]]]]
Silicon Glen had its origins in the [[electronics]] business with [[Ferranti]] establishing a plant in [[Edinburgh]] in 1943. [[NCR Corporation]], [[Honeywell]] and [[Burroughs Corporation]] followed in the late 1940s with [[IBM]] being a very significant import when it opened a manufacturing facility in [[Greenock]] in 1953. Indeed, this was typical of much of the early days of Silicon Glen, which were dominated by electronics manufacturing for foreign companies much more than research and development or the establishment of home grown companies.

The emphasis on electronics came about due to the decline in traditional Scottish heavy industries such as [[shipbuilding]] and mining. The government development agencies saw electronics manufacturing as being a positive replacement for people made redundant through [[heavy industry]] closures and the associated training and reskilling was relatively easy to achieve.

Like the bedrock of [[Silicon Valley]] was in [[semiconductors]], Silicon Glen also had a significant influence in [[semiconductor]] design and manufacturing starting in 1960 with [[Hughes Aircraft]] (now [[Raytheon]]) establishing its first facility outside the US in [[Glenrothes]] to manufacture [[germanium]] and [[silicon]] [[Semiconductor diode|diode]]s. In 1965 [[Elliott Automation]] established a production facility in [[Glenrothes]] followed by a [[Metal Oxide Semiconductor|MOS]] research laboratory in 1967. This was followed in 1969 by the establishment of [[wafer]] fabs by [[General Instrument]] in [[Glenrothes]], [[Motorola]] (now [[Freescale]]) in [[East Kilbride]] and [[National Semiconductor]] in [[Greenock]]. [[Signetics]] also opened a facility in [[Linlithgow]] in 1969. In 1970 [[Compugraphics]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.compugraphics-photomasks.com&lt;/ref&gt; relocated from [[Aldershot]] to [[Glenrothes]] to provide [[photomask]] manufacturing for these companies. Other companies who developed semiconductor wafer fabrication or other manufacturing plants included [[STMicroelectronics|SGS]] in [[Falkirk]], [[NEC]], [[Burr-Brown Corporation]], IPS (then [[Seagate Technology]]) and [[Kymata]] (now Kaiam) in [[Livingston, West Lothian|Livingston]], [[Cambridge Systems Technology|CST]] in Glasgow and [[Micronas]] in [[Glenrothes]].

There were some other notable successes such as the large [[Sun Microsystems]] plant in [[Linlithgow]] and the [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] semiconductor manufacturing plant in [[South Queensferry]] where the pioneering [[64-bit]] [[Alpha 21064]] and its derivatives were made. Digital also opened an office in [[Livingston, West Lothian|Livingston]], developing their flagship [[VAX/VMS]] operating system.

[[Rodime]] of [[Glenrothes]] pioneered the 3.5&amp;nbsp;inch hard disk drive in 1983 and spent subsequent years defending its patents against (and collecting [[royalties]] from) [[Seagate Technology|Seagate]], [[Quantum Corporation|Quantum]], [[IBM]] and others.

The manufacturing sector grew to such an extent that at its peak it produced approximately 30% of Europe's PCs, 80% of its [[workstation]]s, 65% of its [[Automated teller machine|ATMs]] and a significant percentage of its [[integrated circuit]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicservice.co.uk/pdf/europe/spring2001/p20.pdf Vaz, Keith (2001). ''Success of British companies in the rest of Europe'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Today==
[[Image:Rockstar North building, shot from hill.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rockstar North]], the creators and developers of popular video game series ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'', are based in [[Edinburgh]]]]
The heavy dependency on electronics manufacturing hit Silicon Glen hard after the collapse of
the hi-tech economy in 2000. [[Viasystems]], [[National Semiconductor]] (now [[Texas Instruments]]), [[Motorola]] and [[Chunghwa Picture Tubes|Chunghwa]] all laid off substantial numbers of employees or closed factories completely. The effects of the Viasystems closure are still felt in the [[Scottish Borders]] today. Digital sold their Alpha facility to [[Motorola]] who eventually closed it down. [[Motorola]] also closed their factory in [[Bathgate]] and the substantial [[NEC Corporation|NEC]] plant in [[Livingston, West Lothian|Livingston]] was also closed. In 2009 Sun ceased manufacturing at its Linlithgow plant&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/business/155-scots-jobs-lost-since-sun-takeover-by-oracle-1-1533449 |title=155 Scots jobs lost since Sun takeover by Oracle |work=The Scotsman |date=10 March 2011 |accessdate=25 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, after successive years of downsizing, NCR ended all manufacturing in Dundee.

However, there are many promising signs as well as a recognition that diversification away from electronics and manufacturing produces a more balanced and stronger economy. There is also more of an interest in encouraging home grown talent.

To diversify away from electronics and manufacturing, the development agencies now see global services as being a potential area of growth, but there is also substantial interest in the software development industry, including [[Rockstar North]], developers of the market leading [[Grand Theft Auto]] series. There is also a dynamic and fast growing electronics design and development industry, based around links between the very strong [[Education in Scotland|universities]] and indigenous companies and projects like the Alba Campus. The software sector has also notably attracted [[Amazon.com]] to set up a software development centre in [[Edinburgh]], the first such centre outside the US. There remains a significant presence of global players like [[National Semiconductor]], [[IBM]], [[Shin Etsu Handotai Europe Ltd]] and [[Freescale]]. The move from a primarily manufacturing dominated region to a wealth creation one has been successful as demonstrated in a report from UBS Wealth Management in 2006 showing Scotland with more venture backed companies per capita than any other UK region.

In addition to the indigenous companies, Silicon Glen continues to have quite a significant semiconductor design community of inward investment companies including [[Atmel]], [[Freescale]], [[Texas Instruments]], [[Micrel]], [[Analog Devices]], [[Allegro MicroSystems]], [[Micro Linear]], [[Micronas]] and [[ST Microelectronics]].

Semefab, the former [[General Instrument]] semiconductor foundry, has been funded as the UK's Primary Centre for the development of [[microelectromechanical systems]] (MEMS) and [[nanotechnology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.semefab.co.uk/mainstory.php?PHPSESSID=3c845f8a4afa5c1ec016e3e378925500 ''Semefab to offer UK’S first MEMS open access facility'']{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scotland had 1,000 companies in electronics employing 25,000 people in 2004, this number has been in decline since 2000 when 48,000 people were employed in the industry in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fifedirect.org.uk/uploadfiles/publications/c64_ufgcov.pdf Fife Council (2006). ''Sector Profiles - Electronics'']&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 2016 the Silicon Glen has begun to boom once again, with new digital start ups - such as [[Skyscanner]] - choosing Scotland for headquarters or offices. In 2015 a new Scottish digital currency was proposed called the [[Scots pound|ScotPound]]. Although the Scottish government hasn't yet begun work on this digital currency, a private project called ScotCoin, inspired by the idea, has emerged.&lt;ref&gt;https://scotcoinproject.com/&lt;/ref&gt; [[SCOTEX]] is a proposed Scottish Stock Exchange, started in 2016, seeking to provide listing for many of these tech sector companies.&lt;ref&gt;http://scotex.uk/&lt;/ref&gt;

18% of the UK's space industry is based in Scotland, and Glasgow builds more satellites than any other city in Europe. Two locations in Scotland - Prestwick Airport and the [[A' Mhòine|A' Mhòine peninsula]] - are up for consideration for the UK's first spaceport.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scotsman.com/future-scotland/tech/scotland-in-strong-position-to-host-first-uk-spaceport-1-4662079&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/highlands-peninsula-marked-for-spaceport-bthccwth5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/16046345.The_first_Scottish_spaceport_could_be_publicly_owned/&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Open_Source_Awards_–_UK|Open Source Awards]] (formerly the Scottish Open Source Awards) have been run from Scotland since 2007. It was initially a subset of the Scottish Software Awards.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3059">'''Yehuda Arazi''' ({{lang-he|יהודה ארזי}}; 1907–1959), code name ''Alon'', was an [[Israel]]i who was active in the [[Haganah]] in Palestine during the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] era.

==Biography==
Arazi was born in [[Łódź]] to a Jewish family in 1907. He immigrated with his parents to [[Tel Aviv]] in the [[Mandatory Palestine]] in 1924, studying in the [[Gymnasia Herzlia]].  While in Palestine, Arazi joined the [[Haganah]] and the [[Palestine Police Force]]. As a police officer, he was most notably involved as the investigating officer in the 1933 murder of [[Chaim Arlosoroff]]. In 1936, Arazi was sent back to Poland to help smuggle [[matériel]] to Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Commander of the Exodus |author=Yoram Kaniuk |year=2001|publisher=Grove Press|isbn=0-8021-3808-X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2aKk4E8Rcc8C&amp;pg=PA101&amp;dq=%22Yehudah+Arazi%22&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;output=html| page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931 he married Rivka Albin, a year later their daughter Ruth was born. She married in 1955 the Supreme Court judge [[Gabriel Bach]]. His son Dan was born in 1941.

In 1943 he stole 5,000 rifles from the British Police for the Haganah, and had to go into hiding. In 1945, after two years of living in hiding as a wanted man in Palestine, Arazi and his partner Yitzhak Levy traveled to Egypt by train dressed as [[Royal Engineers]] sergeants. From there, they traveled through North Africa and into Italy, where they joined the [[Jewish Brigade]] of the British Army using falsified names. He was head of the Italy branch of the [[Mossad LeAliyah Bet]], the Haganah agency involved in facilitating illegal Jewish immigration to Palestine, and was involved in the “[[La Spezia]]” affair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A New Jewry?: America Since the Second World War |author= Peter Medding|year=1992|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-507449-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the independence of [[Israel]] in 1948, Arazi became a private businessman and built the Ramat Aviv Hotel. He died of brain cancer in 1959. Shortly before his death, he befriended the artist Chaim Goldberg, also a Polish Jew, who was commissioned to execute several sculptures and a fully functional water fountain for the front of his hotel. The artist established his studio in a former munitions factory that he received from Arazi, that was located behind the hotel.

Arazi and the La Spezia affair gave the inspiration to [[Leon Uris]] for Ari Ben Canaan in ''[[Exodus (Uris novel)|Exodus]]''.

Arazi was known as “King of Ruses” changing disguises and characters according to needs.
