'''Agip''' (''Azienda Generale Italiana Petroli''—General Italian Oil Company) is an Italian former automotive [[gasoline]], diesel, [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]], [[lubricant]]s, [[fuel oil]], and [[bitumen]] retailer established in 1926. It has been a subsidiary of the multinational petroleum company [[Eni]]. In 2003, [[Eni S.p.A.|Eni]] acquired Agip Petroli S.p.A., creating the '''Refining and Marketing Division (R&amp;M)'''.

==History==

[[Sinclair Oil]] was a U.S. oil company that, with the [[Italian Ministry of National Economy]] in 1924, reached a fifty-year agreement for which both companies were issued a permit to conduct oil research in [[Emilia-Romagna]] and in [[Sicily]], for an area of 40,000&amp;nbsp;km ². Sinclair and the Italian ministry constituted a joint enterprise; 40% of the capital was the ministry's property, all expenditure incurred by Sinclair Oil and 25% of profits to the Italian ministry. The agreement was judged to cause serious damage to the nation and the opposition, headed by [[Giacomo Matteotti]] and [[Don Sturzo]], started a controversy which aligned the suspicion of corruption; Matteotti indeed had prepared a speech on this issue for June 12, but was killed two days earlier. Don Sturzo continued the controversy, stating in a public company was the only way for a national energy independence. 

[[Coal]] in Italy was scarce and of poor quality. It was imported from abroad at prices that seriously weighed on currency balance and limited industrial growth. [[Power plants]], which were not very developed and mainly concentrated in the north of the country, could not satisfy the needs of energy.

===The constitution of the company and the ''ad aziendam'' laws===
With a [[royal decree]] on April 3, 1926, the government of the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] ordered the establishment of the ''Azienda Generale Italiana Petroli'' (AGIP), in the conduct of all activities relating to industry and the commerce of [[petroleum]]; the company was created in the form of [[joint stock companies]]. The share capital was given for a 60% from the [[Ministry of the Treasury (Italy)|Ministry of the Treasury]], for a 20% by [[Istituto Nazionale Assicurazioni]] (INA) and the remaining 20% by the Social Insurance. The first president was [[Ettore Conti]], contractor in the electricity sector. The establishment of the company was attributed by many analysts to [[Giuseppe Volpi di Misurata]], Ministry of Finance, and [[Giuseppe Belluzzo]], Ministry for the National Economy. Volpi di Misurata, however, was directly involved in oil-related interests, working together with [[Fiat Automobiles|FIAT]] of [[Giovanni Agnelli]], and with the financial backing of [[Banca Commerciale Italiana]], which had searched for oil in Emilia-Romagna, unsuccessfully.
In 1927 the ''Mining Act'' was issued, which gave the ownership of the subsoil to the State and imposed the rule that any oil-related activity was subject to authorization and / or government grant. 

It experienced difficulties after the [[crisis of 1929]], but began to flourish in the 1930s. In 1933, a new law was issued in the field of protectionist [[refineries]] and AGIP could operate with greater ease in this area.

===Early stages and development===

AGIP had a facility for refining at [[Fiume]] and in 1936 it took over a [[Oil refinery|refinery]] at [[Porto Marghera]], owned by Volpi di Misurata. Soon after it made an agreement with Montecatini for the creation of the joint enterprise [[Azienda Nazionale Idrogenazione Combustibili|Anic]] (Fuel Hydrogenation National Company), which was to pursue the derivation of fuel by hydrogenation of [[brown coal]]. Then Anic built two refineries to process the oil extracted in [[Albania]] from [[Azienda Italiana Petroli Albanesi]] (AIPA), a subsidiary of AGIP. However the Albanian oil was of poor quality and its processing proved uneconomical. 

Simultaneously, however, because of the costs to support colonial campaigns, Agip had to give up to continue in some foreign investment, in particular it had to abandon their exploration campaigns in [[Iraq]]. It was the explorer [[Ardito Desio]] who found oil in [[Libya]] and in 1939 came the so-called "Petrolibia operation", in which AGIP was linked to FIAT, with which the year before it had created an Italian company for synthetic fuels who wanted to explore the possibility of obtaining gasoline from [[synthetic chemistry]].

[[Malay titles|Datuk]] '''Ahmad bin Ismail''' (born 1955&lt;ref name="The Sun details"&gt;{{cite news|date=10 September 2008 |url=http://www.sun2surf.com/article.cfm?id=25544 |title=Man of controversy |work=Himanshu Bhatt |publisher=[[The Sun (Malaysia)|Sun2Surf]] |accessdate=10 September 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210152441/http://www.sun2surf.com/article.cfm?id=25544 |archivedate=10 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), is a Malaysian politician and a member of the [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO), serving as the chief of UMNO's [[Penang Hill|Bukit Bendera]] ([[Penang Hill]]) division in the state of [[Penang]].&lt;ref name="The Sun details"/&gt;

Ahmad Ismail is known for controversial actions and remarks made in the fields of politics, business and sports, including the latest controversy in which he uttered incendiary remarks about the Chinese community during and after the [[Permatang Pauh by-election, 2008|Permatang Pauh by-election in August 2008]], leading to his suspension by UMNO in September 2008.

== Political career ==

=== Accusations of racism ===

==== "Chinese as squatters" remark ====
In late August 2008, Ahmad Ismail was highlighted over racist remarks uttered during campaigning in [[Permatang Pauh by-election, 2008|a by-election]] in [[Permatang Pauh]] that primarily pitted [[Barisan Nasional]] candidate Arif Shah Omar Shah (UMNO) against [[Pakatan Rakyat]] candidate [[Anwar Ibrahim]] (PKR) for the [[Permatang Pauh]] parliamentary seat.

On 25 August 2008 local Chinese daily ''[[Sin Chew Daily]]'' reported a speech made by Ahmad Ismail on the evening of 23 August 2008 at [[Kampung Pelet]] to campaign for Arif Shah, in which he allegedly stated [[Malaysian Chinese]] were "immigrants" and "squatters", and could not have equal rights.&lt;ref name="The Sun details"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reuters via Yahoo"&gt;{{cite news|date=9 September 2008 | url=http://in.news.yahoo.com/137/20080910/362/twl-malaysia-ruling-party-suspends-offic_1.html| title=Malaysia ruling party suspends official in race row | agency=[[Reuters]] | publisher=[[Yahoo! News]] | accessdate=10 September 2008}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 6 September statement by Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi, Ahmad was quoted that he merely uttered the remark based on historical facts and claimed it was not a racist statement as reported by ''Sin Chew Daily'', accusing the paper of misinterpreting him.&lt;ref name="Don't create tension"&gt;{{cite news | date=6 September 2008 | url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/9/6/nation/20080906213834 | title=PM: Don't create tension among races | work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] | accessdate=10 October 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604005213/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2008%2F9%2F6%2Fnation%2F20080906213834 | archive-date=4 June 2011 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite criticism of his remark in the by-election and expressing regret that it resulted in controversy, Ahmad remained defiant and refused to apologise. In a further outburst during a press conference on 8 September, Ahmad seditiously warned the Chinese community not to seek political power:&lt;ref name="AFP via Yahoo"&gt;{{cite news|date=9 September 2008 |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20080909/wl_asia_afp/malaysiapoliticsrace_080909145027| title=Malaysia faces race row over 'anti-Chinese' comments | agency = [[Agence France-Presse]] | publisher = [[Yahoo!

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The patience of the Malays and Muslims has a limit. Do not push us to the wall, as when we turn back we will be forced to push the Chinese in the interests of our own survival [...] The Chinese should not try to be like the [[Jews]] in [[United States|America]]. It is not enough they control the economy, now they want political control."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following a meeting with Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi on 9 September,&lt;ref name="Meeting Utusan"&gt;{{cite news|date = 9 September 2008 |url = http://www.utusan.com.my/utusan/arkib.asp?y=2008&amp;dt=0909&amp;pub=utusan_malaysia&amp;sec=terkini&amp;pg=bt_10.htm&amp;arc=hive |language=Malay| title = Ahmad Ismail jumpa PM di Putrajaya  | publisher = [[Utusan Malaysia]] | quote = ''Ketua UMNO Bahagian Bukit Bendera, Datuk Ahmad Ismail tiba di pejabat Perdana Menteri di sini pukul 12.50 tengah hari ini untuk mengadakan pertemuan dengan Datuk Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi. [...] Beliau dipanggil oleh Perdana Menteri untuk memberi penjelasan mengenai tindak-tanduknya selepas satu ucapannya berhubung kedudukan orang Cina sebelum merdeka menimbulkan keretakan politik Barisan Nasional (BN).''| accessdate=10 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahmad would later be quoted in stating Malays were "frustrated" and that Malay "dignity" was at stake, remaining convinced that he is more nationalistic defending the Malays rather than being racist:&lt;ref name="AFP via Yahoo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MSN news"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Half the Chinese say I'm a racist but most Malays say I'm a nationalist defending my race [...] What I see now is a rise of the Malay people, and I feel we should capitalise on the strength, the support we get from the Malay people... I know they are with me."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Reaction to His Comments ====
Revelations of Ahmad Ismail's comments during and after the by-election drew widespread criticism predominantly from the Chinese community. On 27 August, the youth wing of the [[Malaysian Chinese Association]] (MCA) demanded an apology from Ahmad, with secretary-general [[Wee Ka Siong]] stating Ahmad had angered the Chinese as well as other non-Malay communities; Wee had also received numerous complaints from the Chinese community in the past two days.&lt;ref name="Star MCA Youth"&gt;{{cite news | date = 9 September 2008 | url = http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/8/27/nation/20080827152034 | title = MCA Youth want apology from Umno chief for racist statement | author = Sim Leoi Leoi | work = [[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] | accessdate = 10 October 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110604005227/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2008%2F8%2F27%2Fnation%2F20080827152034 | archive-date = 4 June 2011 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 September, [[Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia|Gerakan]] president [[Koh Tsu Koon]] announced Penang Gerakan has dissociated itself from UMNO's Penang branch, holding leaders of UMNO Penang accountable for failing to condemn Ahmad's conduct:&lt;ref name="MT Gerakan"&gt;{{cite news|date = 9 September 2008 |url = http://www.malaysiatoday.com/Latest-News/we-no-longer-want-to-be-associated-with-penang-umno-dr-koh.html | title =  We no longer want to be associated with Penang Umno – Dr Koh | work = Zen | publisher = [[Malaysia Today]] | accessdate = 10 October 2008}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"We no longer want to be associated with Penang UMNO. We condemned the statement and irresponsible behaviour by Ahmad and his supporters. We are also extremely disappointed and saddened by the fact that many Penang UMNO leaders were present and condoned such irresponsible and insensitive statement and behaviour. He had twisted and turned a personal mistake into a conflict and crisis among BN component parties and the communities."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Views among members of UMNO were less conclusive.

== Business ==
In 1995, Peninsular Metroworks {{h:title|Private Limited|Sdn Bhd|}} was founded with Ahmad Ismail as its executive chairman.
The company was a special purpose vehicle, intended to receive concession to develop the [[Penang Outer Ring Road]] (PORR), a project which was subsequently delayed by the federal government in 2008 following the [[Malaysian general election, 2008|2008 general election]].&lt;ref name="The Sun details"/&gt; Additionally, a majority stake in Peninsular Metroworks was indirectly linked to Ahmad Ismail: A 55% stake in the company was held in its early years by Nadi Senandung Sdn Bhd, which Ahmad was the director of; the remaining 45% was held by Setegap Bhd and Kumpulan Pinang Holdings Sdn Bhd, the latter a full subsidiary of Yayasan Bumiputra Pulau Pinang {{h:title|Limited|Bhd|}}.&lt;ref name="The Sun details"/&gt;

Ahmad Ismail was also the director of Popular Profile Sdn Bhd, which the Penang Development Corporation believed had wrongfully taken and kept RM500,000 from the state in a botched land transaction for [[Bukit Minyak]] in 1998, before winding up in 2005; Ahmad was believed to have cut links with the company in 1998.&lt;ref name="The Sun details"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Star PDC"&gt;{{cite news |date = 3 September 2008 |url = http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/9/3/nation/20080903173006 |title = PDC lodges report against Ahmad and former company |author = Andrea Filmer |work = [[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] |accessdate = 10 October 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110604005259/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2008%2F9%2F3%2Fnation%2F20080903173006 |archive-date = 4 June 2011 |dead-url = yes |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A police report was lodged by Penang Development Corporation on 3 September 2008.&lt;ref name="The Sun details"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Star PDC"/&gt;

Crossback Arowana Farm at Bukit Merah Perak is Ahmad's latest business venture. He is a major shareholder for this golden arowana breeding farm and most of his pricey arowanas are exported to Mainland China.

== Sports ==
In addition to interests in politics and business, Ahmad Ismail was also the president of the Malaysian Sepak Takraw Association.&lt;ref name="The Sun details"/&gt; During the [[2007 Southeast Asian Games]] in [[Korat]], [[Thailand]], Ahmad led the pullout of Malaysia's [[sepak takraw]] team at the last minute.&lt;ref name="The Sun details"/&gt;

'''Alfred H. Peet''' (March 10, 1920 &amp;ndash; August 29, 2007) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]]-[[United States|American]] entrepreneur and the founder of [[Peet's Coffee &amp; Tea]] in [[Berkeley, California]], in 1966. He is most famous for introducing custom [[coffee]] roasting to the United States using top quality beans at a time when Americans were typically drinking coffee that came out of a can.{{what|date=May 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/03/us/03peet.html?_r=0 Alfred H. Peet, 87, Dies; Leader of a Coffee Revolution, by Carolyn Marshall, September 3, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;  Peet taught his style of roasting beans to [[Jerry Baldwin]], [[Zev Siegl]] and [[Gordon Bowker]], who took the technique to [[Seattle]] and founded [[Starbucks]] in 1971. Peet is widely credited with starting the specialty coffee revolution in the US. Among coffee historians, Peet is labeled as "the Dutchman who taught America how to drink coffee."&lt;ref name="NOS" /&gt;

==Life and career==
Peet was born in [[Alkmaar]], The [[Netherlands]], where his father ran a small coffee roastery before [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=cvbt&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.centralvalleybusinesstimes.com/stories/001/?ID=6166 | title=Coffee pioneer Peet dies | date=31 August 2007 | accessdate=2007-08-31 | work=Central Valley Business Times | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929063236/http://www.centralvalleybusinesstimes.com/stories/001/?ID=6166 | archivedate=2007-09-29 | deadurl=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, Peet left London, where he had apprenticed with a coffee and tea company, and worked as a [[Tea tasting|tea taster]] in the [[Dutch East Indies]] and [[New Zealand]] before [[emigrate|emigrating]] to [[San Francisco, California]], in 1955, where he worked in the coffee importing industry.&lt;ref name=sfsen&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sanfranciscosentinel.com/?p=4524 | title=The passing of Al Peet—the founder of Peet's Coffee | date=August 31, 2007 | accessdate=2007-08-31 | last=Murphy | first=Pat | work=San Francisco Sentinel| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070902101032/http://www.sanfranciscosentinel.com/?p=4524| archivedate= 2 September 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mailtrib&gt;{{cite news | url=http://archive.mailtribune.com/archive/2003/0601/local/stories/03local.htm | title=Peet now calls Medford his home | date=2003-06-01 | last=Stiles | first=Greg | work=Mail-Tribune | accessdate=2007-08-31| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070929092847/http://archive.mailtribune.com/archive/2003/0601/local/stories/03local.htm| archivedate= 29 September 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After becoming dismayed at the poor quality of coffee in the United States (according to Peet, the reason that the quality of coffee was so bad in the USA is that people were still drinking World War II style "rationed" coffee),&lt;ref name="NOS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nederlander leerde Amerika koffie drinken |url=https://nos.nl/artikel/64234-nederlander-leerde-amerika-koffie-drinken.html |website=NOS Nieuws |accessdate=9 October 2016 |date=2007-09-04 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120929222917/http://nos.nl/artikel/64234-nederlander-leerde-amerika-koffie-drinken.html |archivedate=29 September 2012 |df= }} (in Dutch).&lt;/ref&gt; he opened his own coffee store in [[Berkeley, California]], in 1966. Although often encouraged to expand the business, he remained stalwart in keeping the single location at Walnut and Vine and zealously guarding the quality of the coffee bearing his name.

Peet sold the business in 1979 to Sal Bonavita and remained a mentor and teacher to Sal for the next five years. Bonavita soon opened new stores in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[Mill Valley, California|Mill Valley]] and [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work=San Francisco Chronicle | title=Coffee pioneer Alfred Peet dies | author=George Raine | date=2007-09-01 | url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/09/01/BUEIRTFAV.DTL | accessdate=2007-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An interview with Alfred Peet is included in the documentary "Coffee Culture USA" released in 2008.

'''Breakage''' is a term used in [[telecommunications]] and [[accounting]] to indicate any type of service which is unused by the customer. A good example would be [[gift cards]] or [[Telephone card|calling cards]] that have been sold but never redeemed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.servicelevel.net/rating_matters/newsletters/issue10.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Revenue from breakage is almost entirely profitable, since companies need not provide any goods or services for unredeemed gift cards. It should not be confused with [[Shrinkage (accounting)]] (items which are not used by the customer because they disappeared from inventory).

In 2006, a blog called "The Stalwart" criticized [[Best Buy]] for using estimated breakage to improve their revenue numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thestalwart.com/the_stalwart/2005/12/best_buy_neithe.html
|title=The Stalwart|accessdate=2006-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In telecommunications ==
In telecommunications, breakage can occur in several ways. The key elements in maximizing revenue versus service via breakage are:

* Use of quanta (pay for more than you use).
* [[Product bundling|Bundling of mixed services]] (force purchase of other services).
* Expiry of purchased service (ideally expire monthly).
* Inflexibility of plans (with high charges for exceeding arbitrary fixed limits).
* Low flexibility in changing plans (e.g. upgrade for free, pay to downgrade).
* Low transparency of service usage and fees.

The following examples are given in terms of voice calling, although they may also apply to data, short message or other services.

*''[[Rounding|Rounding-Up]]'': A call will often be rounded-up to a billing quantum. E.g. a call of 12 seconds may be billed as 60 seconds, and a call of 61 seconds billed as 120 seconds.
*''Minimum Balance Requirement'': A calling service may require a minimum balance before it can be used. E.g. The billing quanta is 60 seconds, however the service will not let you begin a call unless you have sufficient funds for at least two minutes of calling.
*''Unusable Amounts'': The unit charge values may be such that it is impossible to use all of the nominal amount purchased. A $10 calling card is charged at $1.05 per minute. After $9.45 is used, the remaining $.55 is not sufficient to make any call.
*''Abandoned Accounts'': Accounts or calling cards which are lost or abandoned while still retaining significant credit. This is the equivalent of the meaning of the term "Breakage" in the gift card context.
*''Expired Amounts'': The subscriber is forced to pre-purchase large services amounts which expire if not used within a specified period.
*''Unused/Unbalanced Bundles'': A bundle of services includes a mix of features. For example, a $30 per month package may include 3000 free Short Messages and 60 national calling voice minutes. Many customers may use most of the short messages, but not use the voice minutes. Other customers may use most of the voice minutes, but not the short messages.
*''Flat Plans, Bumpy Usage'': A service plan may include a flat rate, e.g. 10 GB of data per month. However, the client's usage may be highly variable. E.g. one month they may use only 1 GB, despite having paid for 10 GB. The following month, they may use 20 GB, with the additional 10 GB being charged at a significantly higher "overflow" rate.

Careful research and planning can maximise some forms of breakage. For example, if a high percentage of mobile voice calls on the network are less than one minute in duration, then a rating plan could use an initial quanta of 60 seconds, followed by 1 second quanta. The plan appears to use a low quanta, but in fact many calls will be hit by the initial 60 second quanta.

Similarly, if many users are shown to use 14 GB of data per month on a data plan, then offering data plans of 10 GB or 30 GB will force many users to pay for much more data than they need, which will expire at the end of each month.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24641">'''Customer Configuration Updating''' (CCU) is a [[software development]] method for structuring the process of providing customers with new versions of products and updates production. This method is developed by researchers of the [[Utrecht University]].

This article is about the delivery phase of the CCU method. Delivery concerns the process which starts at the moment a product is finished until the actual shipping of the product to the customer.

== Introduction to the delivery process ==

As described in the general entry of CCU, the delivery phase is the second phase of the CCU method. In figure one the CCU method is depicted. The phases of CCU that are not covered in this article are concealed by a transparent grey rectangle.

As can be seen in figure one, the delivery phase is in between the release phase and the deployment phase. A software vendor develops and releases a software product and afterwards it has to be transported to the customer. This phase is the delivery process. This process is highly complex because the vendor often has to deal with a product which has multiple versions, variable features, dependency on external products, and different kinds of [[distribution (business)|distribution]] options. The CCU method helps the software vendor in structuring this process.

In figure 2, the [[process-data diagram]] of the delivery phase within CCU is depicted. This way of modeling was invented by Saeki (2003). On the left side you can see the meta-process model and on the right side the meta-data model. The two models are linked to each other by the relationships visualized as dotted lines. The meta-data model (right side) shows the concepts involved in the process and how the concepts are related to each other. For instance it is visible that a package consists of multiple parts, being the: [[Software package (installation)|software package]], system description, manual, and license and management information. The numbers between the relations indicate in what quantity the concepts are related. For example the “1..1” between package and software package means that a package has to contain at least 1 software package and at the most 1 software package. So in this case a package just has to contain 1 software package. On the left side of the picture the process-data model is depicted. This consists of all the activities within the delivery process. This article is based on this process-data model. The meta-process model (left side of the process-data diagram) is divided into several parts which are presented along with the corresponding paragraphs throughout the article to make it easier to understand.

The tables that describe the concepts of the meta-data model and the activities of the process-data model are presented beneath figure 2.

=== Table of concepts ===
The table of concepts contains all concepts used in the meta-data model with their explanations along with the source from which the explanations are derived.

== Package software ==

In order to deliver the developed product to the customer, the vendor needs to package the different components of its product into a package. By doing this, the customer will receive all the information and [[software components]] at once fulfilling all its needs. After combining all elements into one package the software vendor will carefully have to check if the package is complete. The package will have to provide the customer with all the tools and information to use the product. When this is not the case the software vendor will get a lot of questions from its customers which will consume a lot of time. It is therefore very important that the package is checked carefully before it is shipped. The package can be a physical combination of different elements packed into for example a box, but it can also be a digital combination of files which contain all the elements. Within the CCU process it is stated that a package will consist of five elements, being: [[Software package (installation)|software package]], system description, manual, and license and management information. In the following paragraphs is explained how these elements fit into the CCU delivery phase.

=== Software package ===
One of the elements of the package will be the [[Software package (installation)|software package]]. The software package is a package in itself, because it consists of the different [[software components]] that together form the product. In contrast with the overall package, the software package is always a technical package in which all the files needed are combined in order to run the software product.&lt;ref&gt;Examples of tools which can perform this packaging are: [http://www.lokigames.com/ Loki-Update], [http://www.kleemann.org/rpm-update/oldindex.html/ RPM-update] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060221051432/http://www.kleemann.org/rpm-update/oldindex.html# |date=2006-02-21 }}, [http://swup.trustix.org/ SWUP] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060512162529/http://swup.trustix.org/# |date=2006-05-12 }} and [http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/portage-manual.xml/ Portage] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041021012956/http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/portage-manual.xml# |date=2004-10-21 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another concept of the software package is the version. This keeps track of the modifications made to the software product. By relating it to the software package the vendor and the customer are able to keep track of the functionality and properties of the product the customer is using.

=== System description ===
It is a general description of what the product and its functionalities. In addition it will also describe of what components, the product consists and how these are related to other product software already in place. In case of a software [[patch (computing)|update]] it will for example describe how the previous version of the software is modified by this product. Besides this, it will also describe the requirements needed to run the software product properly. For example what other products and configurations need to be in place in order to let this product run properly.

=== Manual ===
The manual is the document that will provide the customer with guidance in deploying and using the product.

=== License ===
The license is in this case a [[Software license agreement]] in which is stated how the customer is permitted to use the product. For example it can state how many users are permitted to use the software product. In this situation the license agreement is a contract or a certificate which is the customers prove of its using permits. The software vendor has its own part of the agreement which in most cases is stored in a system. An elaboration of this part can be found at the receive [[feedback]] section of this article. The license agreement shipped to the customer can be a digital document as well as a physical document.

=== Management information ===
This piece of information should contain the information that is relevant for managing the system at the customer site. In many cases this information is already part of the manual. However in particular situations this information is meant only for the management of the system and not for the users of the system and is therefore supplied as a separate document.

== Distribution ==

After the package is assembled it needs to be [[distribution (business)|distributed]] to the customers. This section within the delivery process is about the actual delivery of the package to the customers.

=== Offline vs Online ===
The software distribution of a product can be done offline as well as online. In an offline situation the package is a physical package which contains all the elements. The software is stored on a data carrier such as a CD or a DVD, and the documents might also be stored in a digital form on this data carrier, or they might be in physical form such as a booklet. The package as a whole is a physical product. In an online situation the entire package needs to be in a digital form. The consequences on the [[distribution (business)|distribution]] process are described in the following paragraphs. CCU is designed to fit both situations but as bandwidth is growing it is making more sense to distribute especially updates and new versions to existing customers online. In this article both ways are discussed. In the process-data model it is assumed that the software vendor conducts both [[distribution (business)|distribution]] channels. As a practical example: HISComp, a provider of medical information systems distributes its software straightforward via CDs. However they use their website to distribute patches for the software products.

=== Preparation of distribution ===

After a new package is assembled, the customer needs to be made aware of the new release. In the process-data model this is being depicted as a loop which states advertising the update until the customers are being properly informed. Besides this, the package ready for delivery, needs to be stored in a repository for the online [[distribution (business)|distribution]]. In addition the vendor needs to create transfer channels. For the online [[distribution (business)|distribution]] this means that the vendor needs to create online channels to its repository. In most cases this means that a link to the product on the website of the vendor is created. In case of updates it is largely applicable that the current version of the software product at the customer site automatically checks the [[wikt:repository|repository]] for new updates of the product. In case of offline [[distribution (business)|distribution]], the vendor needs to create physical transfer channels. This can be shops or just a contract with a courier company.

=== The actual distribution ===
The [[distribution (business)|distribution]] begins with the request for a product by the customer. This can be done automatically when the current product of the customer searches for an update at the online repository. The customer can also manually do a request for a product via the website of the vendor. A third option is that the customer does the request via telephone or e-mail.

When the vendor is aware of the customer request it will determine the customer needs. By checking what the customer current configuration is and what the customer desires. This process can also take place automatically by checking the customer configuration in the [[configuration management]] system. More information on this system is provided in the next chapter. When it is clear what product the customer needs and the possible modifications to this product it is necessary to determine if the customer current configuration suits the new product. The current configuration is compared to the constraints of the new product. This can also be done automatically by the [[configuration management]] system. When the configuration of the customer appears to be insufficient the customer is informed about this. For example the vendor can make clear to the customer that it will need an external product for this new product to run properly. Besides this the [[Customer Relationship Management]] (CRM) system of the vendor is updated. There is more information about this in the chapter about CRM.

When the customer configuration is sufficient the vendor will check the current license of the customer. If the customer does not have a proper license for the requested product the license needs to be obtained. The customer will be informed about this and the CRM system will be updated again. If the customer has the proper license or wants to buy the proper license along with the product, the product is delivered to the customer.

== Software configuration management ==
The [[Software Configuration Management]] system, is a system at the vendor’s site which keeps track of the configurations at the customer site. By storing this in a system the vendor will be able to give the customer particular service when it needs a new product. In the software [[configuration management]] system information about the products used by the customer, the version of these products, as well as which updates are already being done, is stored. In some cases it is possible that the vendor did some modifications to the product particularly for this customer. This will also have to be stored in the system. Also there needs to be [[computer configuration|configuration data]], some generic information about the configuration the customer is using. For example what operating platform the customer uses for its software. What also should be stored in this system is information about the [[feedback]] that the vendor gets from the customer. This includes bug reports, product usage data, error reports and usage questions. More information about this [[feedback]] can be found in the CCU phase activation and usage.

By storing all this information the vendor can determine the customer needs very precisely whenever a customer requests a product or an update. As already stated the vendor can also easily inform the customer about some adaptations the customer needs to make to its configuration in order to let the product function properly. Another advantage of storing this information in a system is that it will ease the process of online delivery. The checking of the configuration needs and constraints can all be done automatically when a customer does a request.

== CRM system ==
The [[customer relationship management]] system contains all kinds of data about the customers of a company. In this article we will discuss the function of this customer data in the CCU delivery process. Information about the license agreement between the customer and the software vendor is stored in the CRM system. In the meta-data model this [[wikt:repository|repository]] and online [[distribution (business)|distribution]] is linked to the CRM system this can again be done automatically. The system will check if the license of a customer is sufficient to obtain a certain product or update.

== Receiving feedback and updating the systems ==

In order to keep all the described systems up-to-date at the vendor site it is important that the vendor receives a lot of

== Example ==
An example of a successful application of the CCU method can be found at Exact Software (ES). ES is a manufacturer of accounting and [[enterprise resource planning]] software based in the Netherlands. ES has combined [[Product Data Management]] (PDM), [[Customer Relationship Management]] (CRM) and [[Software Configuration Management]] (SCM) in order to maintain the configuration at the customer site in a better and less complex way. ES has a module in its CRM software that contains all contracts of each customer. This is linked to their PDM system. Every contract corresponds to files that can be downloaded for a new version or update of a previous version. In the delivery phase this means that the customers are able to obtain all the products through an online connection. So ES sells contracts (licenses) and stores them into their CRM system, the delivery of the actual products can be done by the customers themselves completely automated requiring little effort. The PDM system is on its turn linked to the SCM system which keeps track of the configurations the customers are using. In the delivery phase this means that ES is able to automatically determine the customer needs whenever a customer does a request.

'''CTQ trees''' ([[critical-to-quality]] trees) are the key measurable characteristics of a product or process whose performance standards or specification limits must be met in order to satisfy the customer. They align improvement or design efforts with customer requirements.

CTQs are used to decompose broad [[customer]] [[requirement]]s into more easily quantified elements. CTQ trees are often used as part of [[six sigma]] methodology to help prioritize such requirements. 

CTQs represent the product or service characteristics as defined by the customer/user. Customers may be surveyed to elicit quality, service and performance data. They may include upper and lower specification limits or any other factors. A CTQ must be an actionable, quantitative business specification.

CTQs reflect the expressed needs of the customer. The CTQ practitioner converts them to measurable terms using tools such as [[DFMEA]]. Services and products are typically not monolithic. They must be decomposed into constituent elements (tasks in the cases of services).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6673">Göran Albert '''Casimir "Casse" Ehrnrooth''', titled ''[[Vuorineuvos]]'' (April 6, 1931 – July 8, 2015), was a Finnish magnate and former chairman of the [[Nokia|Nokia Corporation]]. His business career began in the forest industry, and later he was a director of [[UPM-Kymmene]] and [[Nordea|Merita-Nordbanken]].

The eldest son of the President of [[Nordic Union Bank]], one of the then two biggest banks in Finland, Ehrnrooth inherited substantial holdings in important companies from both his paternal and maternal families. His paternal family were in [[banking]], while his maternal forefathers were founders of [[Fiskars]] and [[Kaukas]] industries. His earlier family tree includes notable military men. He had a [[degree in law]] from [[Helsinki University]].

== Kaukas ==
[[File:Kaukas Paper Mills.jpg|thumb|270px|Kaukaa paper factory in [[Lappeenranta]] and [[Saimaa]] lake]]

Casimir Ehrnrooth succeeded his maternal relatives as President and CEO of Kaukas paper factory, in small town of Lauritsala (annexed to [[Lappeenranta]] in 1967), [[Southern Karelia]] in 1962; and he served there for long.

Casimir Ehrnroth was successor of [[Jacob von Julin]] (1906–1987) as CEO of Kaukas paper factory. He was Jacob von Julin’s sister's son. Casimir Ehrnrooth was selected in the Kaukas Board of Directors in 1954 and as CEO in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kansallisbiografia.fi/talousvaikuttajat/?iid=666 Vuorineuvos Jacob von Julin (1906–1987) Oy Kaukas Ab:n toimitusjohtaja] National Bibliograsphy [[Finnish Literature Society]] {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, he arranged the merger between [[Kymi-Strömberg]] industrial corporation and his Kaukas, becoming President and Chairman of the new [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]], [[Kymmene Corporation]], in which position he served until retirement. As such, Casimir Ehrnrooth was in the late 1980s and early 1990s the top businessman and decision-maker of Finnish [[forest industry]], a branch most important to overall Finnish economy. His influence was felt in several governmental policies of Finland, such as some [[devaluation]]s of [[currency]].

== Union Bank and Nokia Corporation ==
As side occupation, he also served in the council of Union Bank, and as chairman of [[Nokia|Nokia Corporation]] (1992–1999), a company which just in those years rose to position of a worldwide developer of [[telecommunications]] devices.

Ehrnrooth lived in [[Helsinki]] retired from daily business. He also owned [[Vanantaka]] manor, in [[Janakkala]], [[Tavastia Proper]], [[Finland]].

== Forcit ==
Casimir Ehrnrooth was Forcit Oy Board of Directors chairman in 2003–2009 and is a member in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Who is who in Finland 2010 Otava&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finder.fi/R%C3%A4j%C3%A4hdysaineita%20ja%20r%C3%A4j%C3%A4ytyst%C3%B6it%C3%A4/Forcit%20Oy%20Ab%20/HANKO%20POHJOINEN/paattajat/162748/ Forcit]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Supreme Administration Court claims in the case of stone business in Tuusula the stone business is concentrated in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yle.fi/uutiset/alueet/helsinki/2011/03/juhani_sjoblom_jattaa_tuusulan_kunnanvaltuuston_2407036.html Juhani Sjöblom jättää Tuusulan kunnanvaltuuston] yle 3.3.2011, the corresponding KHO material in the Supreme Administration Court Helsinki&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Competition Authorities in Finland (15.2.2010) Forcit produce and import the majority of explosives in Finland, but several foreign companies are competing. Forcit Oy produce explosives for civil and military use. Explosive are used in mines, rock construction of large buildings, and road and railway construction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kilpailuvirasto.fi/cgi-bin/suomi.cgi?luku=ratkaisut/esitykset-MOlle&amp;sivu=ratk/r-2005-61-0236 Kilpailuvirasto 15.2.2010] “Forcit on tällä hetkellä merkittävin räjähdysaineiden tuottaja ja maahantuoja Suomessa, ja suuri osa Suomessa käytetyistä räjähdysaineista on Forcitin valmistamia tai maahantuomia räjähdysaineita.

== Family ==
{{See also|Ehrnrooth}}

Casimir Ehrnrooth's father [[Göran Ehrnrooth]] (1905–1996) was a bank manager at Pohjoismaiden Yhdyspankki, and later [[Nordea]] after several mergers. His mother Louise von Julin came from a rich family. Ehrnrooth has been married twice.

'''Downtown Halifax''' is the [[central business district|city centre]] of [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]]. Located on the eastern-central portion of the [[Halifax Peninsula]], on [[Halifax Harbour]], it serves as the business, entertainment, and tourism hub of the region.

==Architecture==
===Historic areas and buildings===
Unlike other historic Canadian cities such as [[Quebec City|Quebec]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/300 "Historic District of Old Quebec", ''UNESCO Heritage Sites'']&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Montreal]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vieux.montreal.qc.ca/histoire/eng/citea.htm "Old Montreal, Centuries of History", ''Old Montreal District']&lt;/ref&gt; or comparably size New England cities such as [[Portland, Maine]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portlandlandmarks.org/advocacy/Preservation-Movement.php "History of Heritage Preservation in Portland", ''Greater Portland Landmarks''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515084117/http://www.portlandlandmarks.org/advocacy/Preservation-Movement.php |date=May 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Halifax has not preserved any heritage districts and has few intact blocks of historic buildings, although the downtown is known for the historic architecture of some individual landmark buildings. Demolition and urban renewal in the 1960s and 1970s replaced most of the downtown with blocks with office towers.&lt;ref&gt;"Disasters and Loss ~ When Built Heritage is Destroyed", ''Nova Scotia Archives and Records Management'']&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Granville Mall Halifax 2016.jpg|thumb|[[Granville Mall (Halifax)|Granville Mall]] is a [[pedestrian mall]] surrounded by [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] era buildings.]]
One of the few blocks to have retained its heritage character is [[Granville Mall (Halifax)|Granville Mall]], a pedestrian mall formerly part of Granville Street, made up of an array of shops and pubs in a conglomeration of rowed historic buildings built in the 1860s. It is known for the stone facades on each building. [[Historic Properties (Halifax)|Historic Properties]], a collection of 19th-century warehouses converted into shops and restaurants, is located nearby. Despite the heritage focus of these remaining blocks of heritage buildings, none are protected as heritage districts. 

The downtown is home to individual government landmarks such as [[Province House (Nova Scotia)|Province House]], built in 1819 and home to the [[Nova Scotia House of Assembly]]. Builders such as [[George Lang (builder)|George Lang]] created many landmark Victorian Era buildings.

[[Citadel Hill (Fort George)|Citadel Hill]], a {{convert|40|acre|m2|adj=on}} star-shaped fort, is another historic attraction in the downtown. Originally established with the arrival of [[Edward Cornwallis]] and the out break of [[Father Le Loutre's War]] (1749), the current fort was built in the [[Victorian Era]] as the hub of the historic defence system for the port. As a result, there is viewplane legislation that restricts vertical development that might block the direct line of sight from Citadel Hill to the harbour and [[Georges Island (Nova Scotia)|George's Island]] in particular. Recent developments have challenged the viewplane limits.

The [[Halifax Public Gardens]] and [[Victoria Park, Halifax|Victoria Park]] bear many Victorian era monuments.

==Economy==
Downtown Halifax is the financial centre of [[Atlantic Canada]]. [[Bell Aliant]] and [[Emera]] are headquartered in downtown Halifax. All [[Big Five banks|Big Five Canadian banks]] have major operations in the CBD. The [[Bank of Canada]] also has one of its five Canadian regional offices located in the area.
[[File:TD Tower, Halifax.JPG|thumb|upright|TD Centre on Barrington and George Street. All [[Big Five banks|Big Five Canadian banks]] have major operations downtown.]]
Major recent commercial developments include the [[Waterside Centre]] and the [[Nova Centre]]. The latter development will house the new [[Halifax Convention Centre]].

=== Hotels ===
Many of the Halifax region's [[hotel]]s are located in the downtown area, with many major hotel chains maintaining a location here. There are also a considerable number of small [[hostel]]s nearby. 

Hotels in the downtown area include:

==Government==
[[File:Province House (Nova Scotia).jpg|thumb|Downtown Halifax is home to [[Province House (Nova Scotia)|Province House]], home of the [[Nova Scotia House of Assembly]].]]
Downtown Halifax is the home of the [[Halifax Regional Council]] chamber at [[Halifax City Hall]]. Offices for the mayor, city councillors, and additional staff can also be found downtown.

At the provincial level, the downtown is the home of [[Nova Scotia]]'s [[Province House (Nova Scotia)|Province House]] where the [[Nova Scotia House of Assembly]] meets. [[Government House (Nova Scotia)|Government House]], where the [[Lieutenant-Governors of Nova Scotia|Lieutenant-Governor]] resides, is located on [[Barrington Street]]. The provincial government also has offices in several other downtown office buildings.

Canada's federal government also maintains a significant presence in the area, working from various buildings including the [[Dominion Public Building (Halifax)|Dominion Public Building]], the Ralston Building, and previously, the Maritime Centre.

==Recreation==
Downtown Halifax has hotels, annual festivals and events, an array of attractions, and many restaurants.

===Museums===
There are several museums and art galleries in downtown Halifax. [[Pier 21]], an immigrant entry point prominent throughout the 1930s, 40s, and 50s, was opened to the public as a [[National Historic Site of Canada]] in 1999. The [[Maritime Museum of the Atlantic]] is a [[maritime museum]] containing extensive galleries including a large exhibit on the famous {{RMS|Titanic||2}}, over 70 small craft and a {{convert|200|ft|m|adj=on|0}} steamship {{ship|CSS|Acadia}}. In summertime the preserved World War II [[Flower-class corvette|corvette]] {{HMCS|Sackville}} operates as a museum ship and Canada's naval memorial. The [[Art Gallery of Nova Scotia]] is housed in a 150-year-old building containing over 9,000 works of art.

===Waterfront===
[[File:Halifax boardwalk.JPG|thumb|The downtown waterfront area is home to the [[Halifax Boardwalk]].]]
The waterfront in Downtown Halifax is the site of the [[Halifax Boardwalk|''Halifax Harbourwalk'']], a {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on|0}} [[boardwalk]] popular amongst tourists and locals alike. Many mid-sized ships dock here at one of the many wharves. The harbourwalk is home to a [[Halifax Transit]] ferry terminal, hundreds of stores, ''Historic Properties'', several office buildings, the [[Casino Nova Scotia]], and several public squares where [[busking|buskers]] perform, most prominently at the annual [[Halifax International Busker Festival]] in August.

===Shopping===
Downtown Halifax, being home to many small shops and vendors, is a major shopping area in the [[Halifax Regional Municipality|HRM]]. It is also home to several small malls, including [[Scotia Square]], [[Barrington Place Shops]], and [[Maritime Centre|Maritime Mall]]. Numerous malls on [[Spring Garden, Halifax|Spring Garden Road]] are also located nearby.

===Restaurants and nightlife===
[[File:ArgyleStreet.jpg|thumb|Bars on Argyle Street. Downtown Halifax is home to approximately 200 restaurants and bars.]]
The area is home to approximately 200 restaurants and bars, providing an interesting array of world cuisine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.downtownhalifax.ns.ca/default.asp?mn=1.8.37 Downtownhalifax.ns.ca] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060221063554/http://www.downtownhalifax.ns.ca/default.asp?mn=1.8.37 |date=February 21, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also over 60 sidewalk cafes that open in the summer months. The nightlife is made up of bars and small music venues as well as [[Casino Nova Scotia]], a large facility built partially over the water.

===Theatre===
[[Neptune Theatre (Halifax)|Neptune Theatre]], a 43-year-old establishment located on Argyle Street, is Halifax's largest theatre. It performs an assortment of professionally produced plays year-round. The [[Shakespeare by the Sea, Halifax|Shakespeare by the Sea]] theatre company performs at nearby [[Point Pleasant Park]]. Eastern Front Theatre performs at [[Alderney Landing]] in [[Downtown Dartmouth|Downtown]] [[Dartmouth, Nova Scotia|Dartmouth]] which can easily be accessed from the area via the [[Halifax Transit]] [[ferry]] service.

===Events and festivals===
The [[Scotiabank Centre]] is one of the largest buildings in Downtown Halifax, as well as the largest arena in [[Atlantic Canada]]. It is the home of the popular [[Halifax Mooseheads]] hockey team, and it also plays host to most of the major sporting events and concerts that visit Halifax. The [[Nova Scotia International Tattoo]] is held here every year. It is connected to the [[Downtown Halifax Link]], and directly to the [[World Trade and Convention Centre]]. The [[Atlantic Film Festival]], [[Atlantic Jazz Festival]] and the [[Halifax Pop Explosion]] also take place in some downtown venues.

The [[Halifax Convention Centre]], presently under construction, will offer more than {{convert|120000|sqft|m2}} of space for meetings and events.

==Transportation==
=== Harbour ===
[[File:Halifax-Dartmouth Ferry - Halifax Skyline Sunset (22756203545).jpg|thumb|A [[Halifax Transit]] [[ferry]] heads towards [[Dartmouth, Nova Scotia|Dartmouth]] from Downtown Halifax.]]
The waterfront area is home to a [[Halifax Transit]] ferry terminal, which takes commuters across [[Halifax Harbour]] to terminals at [[Alderney Landing]] and [[Woodside, Nova Scotia|Woodside]] in [[Dartmouth, Nova Scotia|Dartmouth]]. These trips usually take around 12 minutes, and cost $2.25 for adults and $1.50 for seniors or children. Additional routes are being planned, and in mid-2005 a high-speed [[ferry]] route between the downtown terminal and a new Bedford terminal was demonstrated. The results were generally positive.

There are also many tour boats available at the waterfront, ranging from spacious [[Paddle steamer|paddleboats]] to [[amphibious vehicle]]s such as the locally famous Harbour Hoppers, adapted [[LARC-V]] vehicles.

=== Road ===
The streets in the downtown area are set in a grid pattern like the rest of the [[Halifax Peninsula]], the way the town officials originally planned in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.halifax.ca/legislation/adminorders/ao29.pdf halifax.ca]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eservices.halifax.ca/StreetDirectory/streetList.jsf eservices.halifax.ca]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these streets have been altered in recent years due to large developments, such as the [[Scotiabank Centre]], which split Albemarle Street into two sections when it was constructed. The street was renamed Market Street and only recently did one segment revert to its original name.

City planners in the 1960s developed a controversial plan for a six-lane elevated [[freeway]] called Harbour Drive. This project was cancelled after protests over the proposed destruction of many historic buildings. All that remains of the project today is the [[Cogswell Interchange]], a massive concrete structure that some consider a barrier between the North End and the downtown area. Its demolition is currently being considered. Traffic problems are currently avoided through the use of [[one-way street]]s, and mass transit.

Many Halifax Transit bus routes also pass through the downtown, with major terminals at Scotia Square and on Lower Water Street (adjacent to the ferry terminal). [[Barrington Street]] is the primary bus route through the area.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22527">'''Energy management''' includes planning and operation of [[energy production]] and [[energy consumption]] units. Objectives are [[Energy conservation|resource conservation]], [[climate protection]] and [[Saving|cost savings]], while the users have permanent access to the energy they need. It is connected closely to [[environmental management]], [[Manufacturing process management|production management]], [[logistics]] and other established business functions. The [[Verein Deutscher Ingenieure|VDI-Guideline]] 4602 released a definition which includes the economic dimension: “Energy management is the proactive, organized and systematic coordination of procurement, [[Energy transformation|conversion]], [[Energy distribution|distribution]] and use of energy to meet the requirements, taking into account environmental and economic objectives”.&lt;ref&gt;VDI-Guideline VDI 4602, page 3, Beuth Verlag, Berlin 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy efficiency ==

===Base line of energy assessment===
One of initial steps for an effective energy cost control program is the base line energy assessment, which examines the pattern of existing energy usage by the government or any sub-entity of the government or private organization. This program will set the reference point for improvements in energy efficiency. Energy efficiency can improve the existing energy usage and benchmarking of every individual section such as area, sub-area and the industry etc .

== Organizational integration ==
It is important to integrate the energy management in the organizational structure, so that the energy management can be implemented. Responsibilities and the interaction of the decision makers should be regularized. The delegation of functions and competencies extend from the top management to the executive worker. Furthermore, a comprehensive [[wikt:coordination|coordination]] can ensure the fulfillment of the tasks.

It is advisable to establish a separate organizational unit “energy management” in large or energy-intensive companies. This unit supports the senior management and keeps track. It depends on the basic form of the [[organizational structure]], where this unit is connected. In case of a [[functional organization]] the unit is located directly between the first ([[CEO]]) and the second hierarchical level (corporate functions such as production, [[procurement]], [[marketing]]). In a divisional organization, there should be a central and several sector-specific energy management units. So the diverse needs of the individual [[Sector (economic)|sector]]s and the coordination between the branches and the head office can be fulfilled. In a [[matrix management|matrix organization]] the energy management can be included as a matrix function and thus approach most functions directly.

== Energy management in operational functions ==

=== Facility management ===
[[Facility management]] is an important part of energy management, because a huge proportion (average 25 per cent) of complete [[operating cost]]s are energy costs. According to the [[International Facility Management Association]] (IFMA), facility management is "a profession that encompasses multiple disciplines to ensure functionality of the built environment by integrating people, place, processes and technology."

The central task of energy management is to reduce costs for the provision of energy in buildings and facilities without compromising work processes. Especially the availability and service life of the equipment and the ease of use should remain the same. The German Facility Management Association (GEFMA e.V.) has published guidelines (e.g. GEFMA 124-1 and 124-2), which contain methods and ways of dealing with the integration of energy management in the context of a successful facility management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gefma.de/uploads/tx_ttproducts/datasheet/GEFMA124-1S1.2009-11.pdf|title=GEFMA: Energiemanagement Grundlagen und Leistungsbild|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this topic the facility manager has to deal with economic, ecological, risk-based and quality-based targets. He tries to minimize the total cost of the energy-related processes (supply, distribution and use).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energy20.net/pi/index.php?StoryID=317&amp;articleID=154847 |title=viewed 10. November 2012 |publisher=Energy20.net |date=2010-02-03 |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Passive house scheme 1.svg|thumb|300px|The '''Passivhaus''' uses a combination of [[:category:low-energy building|low-energy building]] techniques and technologies]]

The most important key figure in this context is [[kilowatt-hour]]s per square meter per year (kWh/m²a). Based on this key figure properties can be classified according to their energy consumption.

* Europe: In Germany a [[low-energy house]] can have a maximum energy consumption of 70 kWh/m²a.
*North America: In the [[United States]], the [[ENERGY STAR]] program is the largest program defining low-energy homes. Homes earning ENERGY STAR certification use at least 15% less energy than standard new homes built to the International Residential Code, although homes typically achieve 20%-30% savings.&lt;ref&gt;"Features of ENERGY STAR Qualified New Homes." - EnergyStar.gov, Retrieved 7 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In comparison, the [[Passive house]] (Passivhaus in German) ultra-low-energy standard, currently undergoing adoption in some other European countries, has a maximum space heating requirement of 15 kWh/m²a. A Passive House is a very well-insulated and virtually air-tight building. It does not require a conventional heating system. It is heated by solar gain and internal gains from people. Energy losses are minimized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://passiv.de/en/02_informations/01_whatisapassivehouse/01_whatisapassivehouse.htm |title=retrieved 8 December 2012 |publisher=Passiv.de |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also buildings that produce more energy (for example by [[solar water heating]] or [[photovoltaic system]]s) over the course of a year than it imports from external sources. These buildings are called [[energy-plus-house]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plusenergiehaus.de/index.php?p=home&amp;pid=8&amp;L=0&amp;host=1#a1 |title=retrieved 3 December 2012 |publisher=Plusenergiehaus.de |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the work regulations manage competencies, roles and responsibilities. Because the systems also include risk factors (e.g., oil tanks, gas lines), you must ensure that all tasks are clearly described and distributed. A clear regulation can help to avoid liability risks.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kals: Betriebliches Energiemanagement - Eine Einführung, p. 75 – 77, Kohlhammer, Stuttgart 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-17-021133-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Logistics ===
[[File:A8 bei Derching LKW Richtung München MAN Mercedes.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Carriage of goods]]
Logistics is the [[management]] of the flow of [[resources]] between the point of origin and the point of destination in order to meet some requirements, for example of customers or corporations. Especially the core logistics task, transportation of the goods, can save costs and protect the environment through efficient energy management. The relevant factors are the choice of means of transportation, duration and length of transportation and cooperation with logistics service providers.

The logistics causes more than 14% percent of CO2 emissions worldwide. For this reason the term [[Green Logistics]] is becoming increasingly important.

Possible courses of action in terms of green logistics are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iml.fraunhofer.de/de/themengebiete/umwelt_ressourcenlogistik/umwelt_ressourcen/Green_Logistics.html |title=retrieved on November 10, 2012 |publisher=Iml.fraunhofer.de |date=2013-12-20 |accessdate=2013-12-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101010036/http://www.iml.fraunhofer.de/de/themengebiete/umwelt_ressourcenlogistik/umwelt_ressourcen/Green_Logistics.html |archivedate=2014-01-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Shift to ecofriendly transport carrier such as railroad and waterway
* Route and load optimization
* Formation of corporate networks, which are connected by logistics service
* Optimizing physical logistics processes by providing a sophisticated IT support

Besides transportation of goods, the transport of persons should be an important part of the logistic strategy of organizations. In case of business trips it is important to attract attention to the choice and the proportionality of the means of transport. It should be balanced whether a physical presence is mandatory or a telephone or video conference is just as useful. Home Office is another possibility in which the company can protect the environment indirectly.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kals: ''Betriebliches Energiemanagement - Eine Einführung.'' Kohlhammer, Stuttgart 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-17-021133-9}}, p.103-105.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy procurement ===
Procurement is the acquisition of goods or services. Energy prices fluctuate constantly, which can significantly affect the energy bill of organizations. Therefore poor energy procurement decisions can be expensive. Organizations can control and reduce energy costs by taking a proactive and efficient approach to buying energy. Even a change of the energy source can be a profitable and eco-friendly alternative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energieagentur.nrw.de/unternehmen/energiebeschaffung-3699.asp |title=retrieved 10 November 2012 |publisher=Energieagentur.nrw.de |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Production ===
Production is the act of creating output, a good or service which has value and contributes to the utility of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Kotler, P., Armstrong, G., Brown, L., and Adam, S. (2006) Marketing, 7th Ed. Pearson Education Australia/Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; This central process may differ depending on the industry. Industrial companies have facilities that require a lot of energy. Service companies, in turn, do not need many materials, their energy-related focus is mainly facility management or Green IT. Therefore the energy-related focus has to be identified first, then evaluated and optimize.

=== Production planning and control ===
Usually, production is the area with the largest energy consumption within an organization. Therefore also the production planning and control becomes very important. It deals with the operational, temporal, quantitative and spatial planning, control and management of all processes that are necessary in the production of goods and commodities. The "production planner" should plan the production processes so that they operate in an energy efficient way. For example, strong power consumer can be moved into the night time. Peaks should be avoided for the benefit of a unified [[load profile]].

The impending changes in the structure of energy production require an increasing demand for storage capacity. The Production planning and control has to deal with the problem of limited [[energy storage|storability of energy]]. In principle there is the possibility to store energy electrically, mechanically or chemically. Another trend-setting technology is lithium-based electrochemical storage, which can be used in electric vehicles or as an option to control the power grid. The German [[Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology]] realized the significance of this topic and established an initiative with the aim to promote technological breakthroughs and support the rapid introduction of new energy storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmwi.de/English/Navigation/Press/press-releases,did=487632.html |title=retrieved 6 December 2012 |language=de |publisher=Bmwi.de |date=2012-04-24 |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Maintenance ===
Maintenance is the combination of all technical and administrative actions, including supervision actions, intended to retain an item in, or restore it to, a state in which it can perform a required function.&lt;ref&gt;British Standard Glossary of terms (3811:1993)&lt;/ref&gt; Detailed maintenance is essential to support the energy management. Hereby power losses and cost increases can be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ps-consulting.de/industrie/IH-Energiemanagement.html |title=abgerufen am 12. November 2012 |publisher=Ps-consulting.de |date=2013-11-21 |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy management challenge===
Through the energy efficiency it management is remain the key for the any industrial user across globe , to achieve  the energy management goal for the federal government or  industry  the efficiency of water and energy resources play a vital role

Examples of how it is possible to save energy and costs with the help of maintenance:

* Defrost the fridges
* Check the barometer of cars and trucks
* Insulation of hot systems
* Improve leaks in building envelopes

== Energy strategies ==
A long-term energy strategy should be part of the overall strategy of a company. This strategy may include the objective of increasing the use of renewable energies. Furthermore, criteria for decisions on energy investments, such as yield expectations, are determined.&lt;ref&gt;J. Kals, K. Würtenberger: IT-unterstütztes Energiemanagement in: HMD - Praxis der Wirtschaftsinformatik HMD, Heft 285/2012, S. 73-81.&lt;/ref&gt; By formulating an energy strategy companies have the opportunity to avoid risks and to assure a competitive advance against their business rivals.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kals: ''Betriebliches Energiemanagement - Eine Einführung.'' Kohlhammer, Stuttgart 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-17-021133-9}}, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Potential energy strategies ===
According to Kals there are the following energy strategies:&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kals: ''Betriebliches Energiemanagement - Eine Einführung.'' Kohlhammer, Stuttgart 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-17-021133-9}}, p. 182-184.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Passive Strategy: There is no systematic planning. The issue of energy and environmental management is not perceived as an independent field of action. The organization only deals with the most essential subjects.
* Strategy of short-term profit maximization: The management is concentrating exclusively on measures that have a relatively short [[payback period]] and a high return. Measures with low profitability are not considered.
* Strategy of long-term profit maximization: This strategy includes that you have a high knowledge of the energy price and technology development. The relevant measures (for example, [[heat exchanger]]s or [[power station]]s) can have durations of several decades. Moreover, these measures can help to improve the [[image]] and increase the [[motivation]] of the employees.
* Realization of all financially attractive energy measures: This strategy has the goal to implement all measures that have a positive return on investment.
* Maximum strategy: For the climate protection one is willing to change even the object of the company.

In reality, you usually find hybrid forms of different strategies.

=== Energy strategies of companies ===
Many companies are trying to promote its image and time protect the climate through a proactive and public energy strategy. [[General Motors]] (GM) strategy is based on continuous improvement. Furthermore they have six principles: e.g. restoring and preserving the environment, reducing waste and pollutants, educating the public about environmental conservation, collaboration for the development of environmental laws and regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gm.com/vision/environment1/our_commitment.html |title=retrieved 21. December 2012 |publisher=Gm.com |date=2012-01-13 |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nokia]] created its first climate strategy in 2006. The strategy tries to evaluate the energy consumption and [[greenhouse gas]] emissions of products and operations and sets reduction targets accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Global&amp;nbsp; Change country |url=http://www.nokia.com/global/about-nokia/people-and-planet/operations/operations/ |title=retrieved 22. December 2012 |publisher=Nokia.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, their environmental efforts is based on four key issues: substance management, energy efficiency, recycling, promoting environmental sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Global&amp;nbsp; Change country |url=http://www.nokia.com/global/about-nokia/people-and-planet/strategy/strategy-and-reports/ |title=retrieved 22. December 2012 |publisher=Nokia.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The energy strategy of [[Volkswagen]] (VW) is based on environmentally friendly products and a resource-efficient production according to the "Group Strategy 2018".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volkswagenag.com/content/vwcorp/content/en/sustainability_and_responsibility/Model_of_Sustainable_Development/Strategy_2018.html |title=retrieved 22. December 2012. |publisher=Volkswagenag.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all locations of the Group are certified to the international standard ISO 14001 for environmental management systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.volkswagen.de/de/Volkswagen/nachhaltigkeit/management_und_daten/management/umweltzertifikat.html retrieved 22. December 2012.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114083829/http://www.volkswagen.de/de/Volkswagen/nachhaltigkeit/management_und_daten/management/umweltzertifikat.html |date=November 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When looking at the energy strategies of companies it is important to you have the topic [[greenwashing]] in mind. This is a form of propaganda in which green strategies are used to promote the opinion that an organization's aims are environmentally friendly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenwashingindex.com/about-greenwashing/ |title=retrieved 16.01.2013 |publisher=Greenwashingindex.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy strategies of politics ===
Even many countries formulate energy strategies. The [[Swiss Federal Council]] decided in May 2011 to resign nuclear energy medium-dated. The nuclear power plants will be shut down at the end of life and will not be replaced. In Compensation they put the focus on energy efficiency, [[renewable energies]], [[fossil energy]] sources and the development of [[water power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfe.admin.ch/themen/00526/00527/index.html?lang=de |title=retrieved 14. December 2012 |publisher=Bfe.admin.ch |date=2013-12-12 |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Union]] has clear instructions for its members. The "20-20-20-targets" include, that the [[Member state of the European Union|Member States]] have to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% below 1990 levels, increase energy efficiency by 20% and achieve a 20% share of renewable energy in total energy consumption by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmwi.de/DE/Themen/Energie/Energiepolitik/europaeische-energiepolitik.html |title=retrieved 14. December 2012 |language=de |publisher=Bmwi.de |date=2012-07-04 |accessdate=2013-12-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101085821/http://www.bmwi.de/DE/Themen/Energie/Energiepolitik/europaeische-energiepolitik.html |archivedate=2014-01-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethical and normative basis of the energy strategies ===
The basis of every energy strategy is the [[corporate culture]] and the related ethical standards applying in the company.&lt;ref&gt;J. Kals, K. Würtenberger: IT-unterstütztes Energiemanagement in: HMD - Praxis der Wirtschaftsinformatik HMD, Heft 285/2012, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ethics]], in the sense of [[business ethics]], examines ethical principles and moral or ethical issues that arise in a business environment. Ethical standards can appear in company guidelines, energy and environmental policies or other documents.

The most relevant ethical ideas for the energy management are:

* [[Utilitarianism]]: This form of ethics has the maxim that the one acts are good or right, whose consequences are optimal for the welfare of all those affected by the action (principle of maximum happiness). In terms of energy management, the existence of external costs should be considered. They do not directly affect those who profit from the economic activity but non-participants like future generations. This error in the market mechanism can be solved by the [[internalization]] of [[external cost]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kals: ''Betriebliches Energiemanagement - Eine Einführung.'' Kohlhammer, Stuttgart 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-17-021133-9}}, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Discourse ethics|Argumentation Ethics]]: This fundamental ethical idea says that everyone who is affected by the [[Decision making|decision]], must be involved in decision making. This is done in a fair [[dialogue]], the result is completely uncertain.&lt;ref name="odpowiedzialny6"&gt;Johannes Kals: Business Ethics and Corporate Energy Management, in: Karczewski, Leszek; Kretek, Henryk (eds): Odpowiedzialny biznes i konsumerysm wyzwaniem XXI Wieku (Responsible Business and Responsible Consumerism as a Challenge of the 21st Century), Polen, Raciborz 2012, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Deontological ethics]]: The deontological ethics assigns individuals and organizations certain obligations. A general example is the [[golden rule]]: "One should treat others as one would like others to treat oneself." Therefore everyone should manage their duties and make an energy economic contribution.&lt;ref name="odpowiedzialny6"/&gt;

Typical ExaaS providers are [[consultants]], [[lawyers]], [[Physician|physicians]], [[teachers]] etc.

ExaaS is the general term for newer consulting or expertise based [[online services]] like CaaS (Consulting-as-a-Service) or JaaS (Justice-as-a-Service) &lt;ref name="henrikzillmer1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://henrikzillmer.com/justice-as-a-service |title=Justice-as-a-Service |publisher=Henrik Zillmer |date= |accessdate=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fractional Executives are professionals who have decided to offer their advice and skills to organizations on a for-hire basis. These executives have typically served a number of years in a business environment in roles such as Chairman, Owner, CxO, SVP, VP or Director . Their skills may be focused in one discipline or could be more broad based, depending on the role(s) they have served.

Fractional Executives may offer their services as an independent consultant or through a company that offers these types of services. They may also be known as Interim Executive, Contract Executive, Part-time Executive, Temporary Executive, Fractional Business Executive, On-Demand Executive or Executive-as-a-Service.

Fractional Executives are not employees of a company or organization. Instead they offer their services to many, which gives them exposure to different cultures and management styles. Fractional Executives may have diverse perspectives if they serve many customers, their perspectives may also be further enhanced if they served multiple industries. Fractional Executives may be hired on a project basis, for a certain period of time or in some cases on retainer.

Advantages of hiring such professionals is their experience and that they don't require a full-time position. While Fractional Executives are highly skilled within their area(s) of expertise they may require time to get acclimated to new industries.

A couple of examples of specifically names Fractional Executives are [[Fractional CIO]], Fractional CMO, Fractional CEO, Fractional Sales Manager, [[Virtual CFO|Fractional CFO]] [http://www.heinzmarketing.com/2015/07/what-is-a-fractional-cmo/ (http://www.heinzmarketing.com/2015/07/what-is-a-fractional-cmo/]).

The '''Global Peter Drucker Forum''' is an international management conference dedicated to the management philosophy of [[Peter Drucker]]. Drucker, who lived from 1909 to 2005, was a management professor, writer, and consultant, frequently referred to as a "management guru." The Forum is held annually in November, in Drucker's home town of [[Vienna]], Austria and is put on by the Peter Drucker Society Europe, an affiliate of the [http://www.druckerinstitute.com Drucker Institute] at [[Claremont Graduate University]].

==Editions==
The first Global Peter Drucker Forum was held on November 19, 2009, marking what would have been the 100th birthday of the late Peter Drucker.&lt;ref name=people&amp;strategy /&gt;  The forum included presentations by management philosopher and author [[Charles Handy]], [[Kellogg School of Management]] professor [[Philip Kotler]], economist [[Peter Lorange]], economist and consultant [[Fredmund Malik]], [[C.K. Prahalad]] of the [[Stephen M. Ross School of Business]] and [[Simon-Kucher &amp; Partners]] chairman [[Hermann Simon]].&lt;ref name=people&amp;strategy&gt;{{cite journal|title=HRPS, People &amp; Strategy Attend First Global Drucker Forum|journal=People &amp; Strategy|year=2009|url=http://drucker-ws.org/pdf/HRPS_PSIssue32%204_Final.pdf#page=69|accessdate=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Halfdan Gyth Dehli''' (15 June 1881 – August 1963) was a [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] businessperson and aviator.

He was a son of barrister [[Ole Dehli]] (1851–1924) and women's health pioneer [[Maria Dehli]], née Gyth (1851–1926).{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} His sister Bergljot was married to Colonel [[Jacob Ager Laurantzon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=1930|title=Laurantzon, Jacob Ager|encyclopedia=[[Hvem er hvem?]]|editor=Steenstrup, Bjørn|publisher=Aschehoug|location=Oslo|url=http://runeberg.org/hvemerhvem/1930/0256.html|page=256|language=Norwegian|accessdate=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and through them he was an uncle of [[Trygve Dehli Laurantzon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Trygve Dehli Laurantzon |encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Hans |last=Torpen |authorlink= |editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo |url=http://nbl.snl.no/Trygve_Dehli_Laurantzon/utdypning |language=Norwegian |accessdate=22 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''Internet booking engine''' (IBE) is a website that allows consumers and [[travel agent]]s to book flights, hotels, holiday packages, insurance and other services online. 

== History ==
In the early days of American aviation, passengers were very few and the airlines did not fly regularly as at present. Ticket fares were regulated by the [[United States government role in civil aviation|Civil Aeronautics Board]]. All routes, fares and flight schedules were published in the [[Official Airline Guide]] and travel agents requested reservations by phone or [[telex]]. As the number of passengers flying annually began to grow, this manual system could not cope and the airlines looked at upgrading their method of ticketing.

In 1946 [[American Airlines]] were the very first to come out with an automated booking system. This was called the [[Reservisor|Electromechanical Reservisor]] which comprised a temporary storage of [[Drum memory|magnetic drums]]. The airline’s operators had to do the actual lookups as travel agents could not directly query this system.
 
1953 marked the birth of complex airline reservation systems when American Airlines launched the [[Sabre (computer system)|SABRE]] ([[Semi-Automatic Business Research Environment]]) reservation system. Next came DATAS by [[Delta Air Lines|Delta]], Apollo by [[United Airlines]] and [[Programmed Airline Reservation System|PARS]] by [[Trans World Airlines]]. Eventually these were replaced{{fact|date=August 2016}} by complex [[computer reservations system]]s (CRSs). Originally operated by airlines, CRSs were later extended for the use of travel agents who could query the systems and make reservations themselves.
 
In the early 1980s CRSs were extended with more features and the new systems were able to book and sell tickets for multiple airlines where the earlier CRSs could handle only one. These newly developed systems were called [[global distribution system]]s (GDS). Eventually airlines divested their direct holdings in GDS companies, with the notable exception of the Asian carriers who remain owners of the following GDSs: Abacus, Topas, Axess, Infini and Travelsky. In addition [[Amadeus CRS|Amadeus]] has [[Air France-KLM|Air France/ KLM]], [[Lufthansa]] and [[Iberia (airline)|Iberia]] as minority shareholders.

Through a GDS, travel agents could easily retrieve the information needed about many airlines. They had greater information-searching and booking capabilities.

Yet passengers themselves needed a travel agent’s assistance when making a booking. If any passenger wanted to book a seat or to go through a schedule they would have to contact the travel agents. So the airlines needed a web-based booking system which will allow the passengers to directly retrieve information about the air schedules, make booking etc. That is when the Internet booking engines (IBEs) were introduced. IBEs are used by nearly every airline at present to cut off extra expenses and to support instant booking and payment.

== Overview ==
An internet booking engine allows a customer to specify their travel requirements such as city of departure, destination, departure date, return date and class of travel. Once this information is received, the IBE will offer a list of available air tickets, hotels and excursions which the customer can then book.

The real value of an IBE is in the [[business rules]] and processes that package the content and provide the capability to shop and purchase. This includes packaging and pricing rules, customized displays for different customers and channels, business rules, and check out and payment processes.

===How it works===
An IBE is installed on the home page of an airline to enable easy access for customers. When shoppers enter their travel preferences the IBE contacts the GDS or CRS/HRS ([[computer reservations system]]) to receive the relevant information which is then shown to the user in an appropriate interface.

The flights and fares may differ according to type of customer accessing the IBE. For example, corporate members or frequent flyers may have access to discounted fares or will enjoy privileges such as redemption of loyalty points against the airfare.

With the Super [[Passenger Name Record]] (Super PNR) function an IBE offers the capability of booking non-air elements such as hotels, cars, holidays and insurance.

After the customer has finished selecting their flights they must choose a payment method. There are several options to choose from; credit card payment, redeeming [[frequent flyer program]] (FFP) points or miles in exchange for a flight ticket, discount vouchers as well as alternative payment methods such as PayPal or direct transfers from a customer's bank account - the number of options mostly depending on the point-of-sale country. If a customer prefers to pay in cash they will need to visit an [[airline]] office to complete the purchase. Once the customer has completed the payment process, a [[Passenger Name Record]] (PNR) is created in the airline's reservation systems and an [[e-ticket]] will be issued.  

As the IBE is an online booking system the interface is often in [[HTML]]. With the growth of broadband, technologies such as [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] or [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] are now used to support the change of the user’s interactivity.

An IBE has real time connectivity to a credit card clearance agency as most payments are made through credit card. Some IBEs offer multi-lingual and multi-currency support for customer convenience.

A good security system which supports authentication and authorization is a must for an IBE.

== Recent developments ==

IBE providers keep adding new features to internet booking engines such as multiple search options so that a customer can book the flight in a manner that suits his/her requirements. If the customer is “schedule sensitive” or needs to adhere to specific travel dates, the IBE offers ticket fares giving priority to the travel calendar. Some IBEs also support passengers who desire to have multiple stops on their way to their destination. As many passengers are very concerned about the ticket price, the IBE of an airline shows a comparison between the low and high ticket fares, with the services included in each.

A user may be able to access a seat map and reserve a preferred seat which is available. The selection of a front row, aisle seat, or window seat is possible. This feature, which is known as web check-in, allows a passenger to check-in online and print their own boarding pass.

Carbon offset programs are also a new feature offered through IBEs. Here, a passenger can contribute to the airline’s environmental initiatives by making a special donation at the time of booking a ticket.

There are also IBE providers who now focus solely on the Vacation Condo, Vacation Villa and Vacation Apartment rental industries along with IBE providers who focus on smaller boutique and independent family owned motel and hotels.

More recently, the leisure, tour and activity market has been digitalized by IBE providers focussing solely on this segment.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tnooz.com/article/regiondo-takes-multi-million-funding-round-from-german-dragon/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internet booking engine websites==
Online travel bookings will represent almost a third of worldwide volume by the end of 2012, according to yStats.com "Global Online Travel Report 2012" report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Online Travel Report 2012|url= http://www.newmediatrendwatch.com/world-overview/91-online-travel-market?start=1|year=2012|publisher=yStats.com|accessdate=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the growth of online travel booking has come from the development of travel websites that allow booking of flights, hotels, and car rentals. In the past 15 years, there has been a significant shift towards more online booking. This shift started with the creation of internet booking engine websites which search across multiple independent travel sites &amp; booking engines.

'''Ivana Marie Trump''' (''[[née]]'' '''Zelníčková'''; {{IPA-cs|ˈzɛlɲiːtʃkovaː|lang}}, born February 20, 1949) is a Czech former model and businesswoman, who was the first wife of [[Donald Trump]]. They married in 1977 and divorced in 1992. They have three children together, [[Donald Trump Jr.]], [[Ivanka Trump]], and [[Eric Trump]].

==Early life==
Ivana Zelníčková was born on February 20, 1949 in the [[Moravia]]n town of [[Zlín]] (formerly known as Gottwaldov), [[Czechoslovakia]], the daughter of Miloš Zelníček, who was [[Czech people|Czech]], and Marie Francová, who was [[Austrian people|Austrian]].&lt;ref name="Gupta"&gt;[http://www.cosmopolitan.com/politics/a56426/ivana-trump-donald-trump-first-wife/ Prachi Gupta, "6 Things You Need to Know About Donald Trump's First Wife, Ivana"]. ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]''. March 16, 2017. Retrieved October 1, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; From the age of 13, her father nurtured and encouraged her skiing talent. In the early 1970s, she attended [[Charles University in Prague]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine| last1= van Meter| first1 = Johnathan| date= May 1989| title = That's Why the Lady is a Trump| trans-title  = | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=xaCC4gI-zJkC&amp;lpg=PA98&amp;q=trump%20master's%20degree&amp;pg=PA86&amp;v=onepage| issn         = 0890-1759| magazine = [[Spy (magazine)|Spy]]| publisher = Sussex Publishers, LLC| access-date  = | via      = [[Google Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:. V. de Valenzuela, R. Reyes Jr., Gen. R. Reyes, and J. M. Eder.jpg|thumb|220px|James Martin Eder circa 1913 with [[Rafael Reyes Prieto]]]]

'''James Martin Eder''' (June 24, 1838&amp;nbsp;– December 26, 1921), known in [[Colombia]] as '''Santiago Martín Eder Kaiser''', '''[[Don (honorific)|don]] Santiago Eder''' or simply "El Fundador", is considered the pioneer of the [[sugar]] industry in [[Colombia]], and is widely recognized as one of Colombia's leading 19th century industrial pioneers.

==Early life==
{{main|Jews in Colombia}}
Eder was born in [[Kuldiga|Goldingen]] in the [[Duchy of Courland]] in the [[Russian Empire]]. He was the son of Martin Sass Eder and Dorina Kaiser, and was the youngest of their seven children. In 1851 Santiago Eder immigrated from Courland to [[New York City]] where his older brother and most of his siblings already lived.  He completed his education and after some work experience entered [[Harvard Law School]] in 1858. In 1861 he moved to [[San Francisco]], and from there moved to the Colombian sea port of [[Buenaventura, Valle del Cauca|Buenaventura]] where he worked as a lawyer and a commercial representative for [[Panama]]nian trading firms when Panama was still part of Colombia. In 1864 he bought the [[Manuelita]] sugar and coffee farm near the city of [[Palmira, Colombia|Palmira]] in the [[Cauca River|Cauca]] Valley of Colombia. He bought this farm at a public auction in [[Cali]] from the father of leading Colombian novelist [[Jorge Isaacs]]. In 1866 Eder became the [[consul (representative)|consul]] of the [[United States]] in Buenaventura, as well as the vice-consul of [[Chile]]. In 1867 he traveled to [[London]] where he met and married Elizabeth 'Lizzie' Benjamin in the New Synagogue.  In their marriage certificate, the name of don Santiago's father is given as 'Moses Eder'. From this marriage were born his children Henry, Charles, Luisa, Walter, Phanor, Fanny and Edith Eder.

==Industrial pioneer in Colombia==

In 1901 [[Manuelita]] became the first Colombian [[sugar mill]] to move from [[mule]] to [[steam engine|steam powered]] mills. As such, don Santiago became one of Colombia's first industrialists. In 1903 he left his children Charles James and Henry James Eder in charge of his business interests and moved with his wife to [[New York City|New York]]. He remained there until his death at 83 in 1921. Eder is buried at the [[Shearith Israel]] Cemetery in [[Cypress Hills, Brooklyn]]. His nephew  [[Montague David Eder]] was one of England's Leading Zionist.

After his death, the Manuelita sugar company saw further expansions in 1927 and 1939. In 1952 under management of [[Harold Henry Eder]], Santiago's grandson, Manuelita became the first [[sugarcane]] mill in Colombia to make refined sugar. Under Santiago Eder's great grandson [[Henry James Eder]] Manuelita started an international expansion, and today is one of Colombia's leading agro/industrial companies with operations in Colombia, [[Peru]], [[Brazil]] and [[Chile]]. The current president of Manuelita is [[Harold Eder Garcés]], is don Santiago's great-great-grandson and belongs to the fifth generation of the Eder Family in Colombia.

Much of Santiago Eder's correspondence, mostly business related, but also dealing with the Colombian government and personal family matters, are preserved at the Phanor James Eder Collection at the [[University of Miami]].

'''Jesse David Bright''' (December 18, 1812 &amp;ndash; May 20, 1875) was the [[Lieutenant Governor of Indiana|ninth Lieutenant Governor of Indiana]] and [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] from [[Indiana]] who served as [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|President pro tempore]] of the Senate on three separate occasions. He was the only senator from a Northern state to be [[Expulsion from the United States Congress|expelled]] for being a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] sympathizer. As a leading [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperhead]] he opposed the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].

==Early life and career==
Born in [[Norwich (town), New York|Norwich, New York]], Bright was born into a German family. Bright moved to [[Madison, Indiana]], with his parents in 1820 and attended public schools as a child. He studied law and was [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admitted to the bar]] in 1831, commencing practice in Madison. He was elected a judge of the [[Probate Court|probate court]] of [[Jefferson County, Indiana]], in 1834, was a [[United States Marshals Service|United States Marshal]] for the district of [[Indiana]] from 1840 to 1841 and served in the [[Indiana Senate]] from 1841 to 1843. In 1842, he was elected [[Lieutenant Governor of Indiana]] and served as such from 1843 to 1845.

==U.S. Senate==
Bright was elected as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] to the [[United States Senate]] in 1844, was reelected in 1850 and 1856, serving from 1845 to 1862. He was chairman of the Committee on Enrolled Bills from 1845 to 1847, of the [[United States Senate Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds|Committee on Public Buildings]] from 1845 to 1847, of the [[United States Senate Committee on Claims|Committee on Revolutionary Claims]] from 1847 to 1849, of the Committee on Roads and Canals from 1849 to 1855 and of the [[United States Senate Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds|Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds]] from 1857 to 1861. He was also [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|President pro tempore of the Senate]] from 1854 to 1856, 1856 to 1857, and in 1860. As such, he was [[United States presidential line of succession|first in the presidential line of succession]] in the first two terms due to the death of [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[William R. King]] in April 1853.

In the Senate, Bright was not known as a great orator, but was very able in committee work. One enemy of his was [[List of United States Senators from Illinois|Illinois Senator]] [[Stephen A. Douglas]] after he voted against keeping Bright in the Senate. He was, however, a very close friend and confidant of [[William Hayden English]], a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] from [[Indiana]]. In 1857, [[President of the United States|President]] [[James Buchanan]] offered him the post of [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], but he declined.&lt;ref&gt;[http://myindianahome.net/gen/jeff/records/history/woollen/brightjd.html Jesse D. Bright: Biographical and Historical Sketches of Early Indiana] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913231532/http://myindianahome.net/gen/jeff/records/history/woollen/brightjd.html |date=2007-09-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the beginning of 1862, the Senate of the [[37th United States Congress|37th Congress]], which was composed of twenty-nine [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and ten [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], voted to [[List of United States senators expelled or censured|expel]] him for acknowledging [[Jefferson Davis]] as [[President of the Confederate States of America|President of the Confederate States]] and for facilitating the sale of arms to the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. The issue was brought up when [[List of United States Senators from Minnesota|Minnesota Senator]] [[Morton S. Wilkinson]] introduced the Senate to a letter dated March 1, 1861, written to Davis and signed by Bright, involving [[firearm]] trades. The letter was found on a captured gun trader crossing the Confederate border during the [[First Battle of Bull Run]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Friendship_or_Treason.htm Friendship or Treason?]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the fourteenth senator expelled from Congress during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], and was (as of 2017) the last senator ever to be expelled. Soon after his expulsion from the Senate, [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] authorities confiscated his property in [[Port Fulton, Indiana]], which became [[Jefferson General Hospital]], the third-largest hospital during the Civil War. He was an unsuccessful candidate in filling the vacancy caused by his own expulsion in 1863. Bright's longtime intra-party rival, [[United States Ambassador to Germany|Envoy to Prussia]] and [[War Democrats|War Democrat]] [[Joseph A. Wright]], succeeded him in the Senate.

==Later life and career==
After losing his home in [[Indiana]], Bright moved to [[Covington, Kentucky]]. He was a member of the [[Kentucky House of Representatives]] from 1867 to 1871, was a [[United States Electoral College|presidential elector]] on the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] ticket from [[Kentucky]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1868|1868 presidential election]], and was president of the Raymond City Coal Company from 1871 to 1875. He moved to [[Baltimore, Maryland]], in 1874 and died there on May 20, 1875. He was interred in [[Green Mount Cemetery]] in Baltimore.

[[Image:Jönköping tändsticksfabrik, 1872.jpg|thumb|250px|Jönköpings match industry 1872.]]
'''Johan Edvard Lundström''' (1815–1888) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] industrialist and inventor who pioneered the production of safety [[match]]es. Johan is spelt '''John''' outside Scandinavia.

== Biography ==
Johan was born in 1815 in the town of Jönköping, Sweden. Johan Edvard is most of all recognized to have improved the safety match and made it possible to commercially exploit it. The safety match had been invented and patented by the Swedish chemist [[Gustaf Erik Pasch]] (1788–1862) in 1844, but at that time, it was too difficult to produce it. In 1845 Johan Edvard started to experiment with these new type of matches in a small workshop he had rented.  In 1846 his younger brother [[Carl Frans Lundström|Carl Frans]] (1823–1917) joined his small workshop. In 1847 they were ready to set up a production plant and bought an estate on the coast of Lake [[Vättern]] where they built a large match factory. Today, their original factory is a museum.

Before the safety match was invented, matches were dangerous for the workers in the factory because the use of the very poisonous white/yellow [[phosphorus]] that the workers were inhaling, in particular those who worked with the application on the sticks. After some years of exposure they could get infected from the poisonous phosphorus and get a disease called “[[Phossy jaw]]” and could lose their teeth. This disease was very deadly. When the cause for the disease was discovered, the ventilation in the production process was improved, but the dangerous type of phosphorus were soon forbidden to use for matches. The safety match used the non-poisonous red phosphorus that was placed on the striking surface, not the match itself. The reason they were called “safety matches” was because they would only ignite on the striking surface on the box, nowhere else would the match ignite. The safety match patent included the combination of using red phosphorus and separating it from the stick. Johan made it possible to mass-produce the safety match.

The Lundström safety match got an award at the “World Exhibition” in Paris 1855. [[Alexander Lagerman]] (1836–1904), a Swedish engineer that was employed by the Lundström brothers, invented the first fully automatic match machine. The safety match combined with the advanced machines that the company developed themselves, soon made the company in Jönköping the largest match company in Scandinavia and one of the world's largest match production companies. Today the safety match is the most widely used match in the world.

J. E. Lundström left the match business in Jönköping around 1862–63 to work with his [[cellulose]] factory, Munksjö Cellulose, in Jönköping that he had founded in 1862 together with [[Lars Johan Hierta]]. In 1869 he left the Munksjö factory and founded Katrinefors cellulose industry in [[Mariestad]], but left that business in 1875. He then worked as a government inspector in the match industry between 1875–77 in Sweden and was to a great extent involved in the work to prevent and forbid the use of the dangerous white [[phosphorus]].

J. E. Lundström died in 1888 at the age of 73, having never married.  His brother Carl Frans had left the match industry in 1863 and moved to [[Stockholm]] to work with other projects. A new generation took over the factory in Jönköping but details about this is not very well documented. Most likely, the brothers both sold their shares in Jönköping factory around 1863. Whether J. E. Lundström had any children or any other relatives that were involved in the factory is not known.

In 1917 the company in Jönköping was sold to [[Ivar Kreuger]] and incorporated in the company ''Svenska Tändsticks AB'', today known as [[Swedish Match]].

Mack's father's original family name was Makhoul; he came to the United States from [[Lebanon]] when he was 12 years old, following Mack's grandfather, who had arrived at [[Ellis Island]] in 1909.&lt;ref name=NYTimes-LebaneseAmerican-2006&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thomas Jr.|first1=Landon|title=From Lebanese-American Financiers, Differing Views on the Strife|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/01/business/worldbusiness/01wall.html|accessdate=12 November 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The family settled in [[North Carolina]]. Mack's father ran a wholesale grocery, clothing, and general merchandise store called John Mack &amp; Son in [[Mooresville, North Carolina]].&lt;ref name=MackandMack-Madeline-2006&gt;{{cite news|title=Madeline Mack (1914-2006)|url=https://mamclothing.com/madelines-influence/|accessdate=13 November 2015|work=Mack and Mack Clothing}}&lt;/ref&gt; The business occupied The John Mack Building from 1937 to the 1990s.&lt;ref name=MooresvilleHistoricWalkingTour-pamphlet&gt;{{cite web|title=Mooresville Historic Walking Tour|url=http://68.71.163.9/walkingtour/WalkingTour.pdf|website=Town of Mooresville|accessdate=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mack is the youngest of six sons. The family was Catholic.&lt;ref name=HoratioAlbergAssn-Mack-2004&gt;{{cite web|title=John J.

In 1968, Mack graduated from [[Duke University]], where he attended on a [[American football|football]] scholarship and majored in history. Mack's first job in finance was as a clerk at a small brokerage house during his junior year at Duke, after a cracked vertebra made it impossible for him to continue on his football scholarship.&lt;ref name=HoratioAlbergAssn-Mack-2004 /&gt;

== Career ==

=== Morgan Stanley ===
Mack worked at several firms around Wall Street before starting his career at Morgan Stanley in 1972 as a salesman, and has since worked for the company for nearly thirty years. Rising steadily to positions of increasing responsibility, Mack eventually headed the firm's Worldwide Taxable Fixed Income Division from 1985 to 1992.&lt;ref name=CNBC-MS-Farewell-2011&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carney|first1=John|title=Morgan Stanley Bids John Mack Farewell|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/45587614|accessdate=11 January 2016|work=[[CNBC]]|date=8 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, he became a member of the board of directors. In March 1992, he assumed responsibility for Morgan Stanley's day-to-day operations as chairman of the operating committee. He was named President of Morgan Stanley in June 1993. Mack served as president, chief operating officer and a director of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &amp; Co. from May 1997 when the firm was created by the merger of Morgan Stanley and Dean Witter, two of the world's leading financial services companies.&lt;ref name=NYTimes-MSDW-1997&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barboza|first1=David|title=Veteran Executive Is 'Tough And Direct'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/06/business/veteran-executive-is-tough-and-direct.html|accessdate=12 November 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=6 February 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Mack left Morgan Stanley after a power struggle with [[Philip J. Purcell|Phil Purcell]]; Purcell became CEO of Morgan Stanley after the 1997 merger of Morgan Stanley and [[Dean Witter Reynolds|Dean Witter]], of which Purcell was already CEO.

=== Credit Suisse ===
Six months later, in June 2001, Mack was hired as CEO of [[Credit Suisse]], then known as [[Credit Suisse First Boston]] (CSFB).&lt;ref name=NYTimes-CSFB-TechPenalty-2002&gt;{{cite news|last1=McGeehan|first1=Patrick|title=His Rallying Cry at First Boston: Smaller, Cleaner, Fairer|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/27/business/his-rallying-cry-at-first-boston-smaller-cleaner-fairer.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=12 November 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=27 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mack's time at Credit Suisse was marked much restructuring and by compliances issues created by [[Frank Quattrone]]'s Technology Group.&lt;ref name=Fortune-CSFB-2003&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sellers|first1=Patricia|title=The Trials of John Mack|url=http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2003/09/01/348191/index.htm|accessdate=13 November 2015|work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]|date=1 September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Mack joined [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts]] as a Senior Advisor.&lt;ref name=NYTimes-KKR-2012&gt;{{cite news|last1=De La Merced|first1=Michael J.|title=K.K.R.

=== Rosneft ===
In 2013 Mack joined [[Rosneft]], the Russian, state-owned, oil company that has BP as an investor of approximately 20%.

Different reasons were given for his departure; Mack said his contract had only been for a year, while Rosneft spokespeople said he had decided to leave for personal reasons.

== Insider trading accusations ==
In 2006, Mack was accused by former [[United States Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] investigator [[Gary J. Aguirre]] of [[insider trading]].&lt;ref name=Forbes-SECInsider-2006&gt;{{cite news|last1=Moyer|first1=Liz|title=SEC Wants Mack|url=https://www.forbes.com/2006/07/21/mack-ubs-sec-fund-cx_lm_0721mack.html|accessdate=13 November 2015|work=[[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]]|date=21 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTimes-SECInsider-2007&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morgenson|first1=Gretchen|last2=Bogdanich|first2=Walt|title=Report Says S.E.C.

In late November 2006, Mack and Pequot were notified that the investigation had been closed and no action would be taken against them.

==Compensation==
While CEO of Morgan Stanley in 2006, Mack earned a total compensation of $41,399,010, which included a base salary of $800,000, stocks granted of $36,179,923, and options granted of $4,019,934.&lt;ref name=Equilar-Compensation-2007&gt;{{cite web|title=Executive Compensation: 2007 Annual Comp.: John J.

In 2008, he earned a total compensation of $1,235,097, which included a base salary of $800,000 and other compensation of $435,097.

== Financial crisis of 2007–2009 ==
{{see also|Financial crisis of 2007–08}}
Mack guided the firm through the [[financial crisis of 2008]],&lt;ref name=Forbes-CitiCrisis-2008&gt;{{cite news|last1=Raghavan|first1=Anita|title=Citi's Bad Bet|url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/05/14/old-lane-citigroup-biz-cx_ar_0514oldlane.html|accessdate=13 November 2015|work=[[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]]|date=14 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; building its capital position and overseeing the firm's conversion to a bank holding company. To stabilize the firm, he forged strategic alliances with China Investment Corporation and Mitsubishi UFJ Group and entered into a joint venture with Smith Barney, forming at the time the world's largest wealth management firm. During the crisis, Mack was advised by U.S. Treasury Secretary [[Hank Paulson]] and the head of the Federal Reserve Bank [[Ben Bernanke]] to sell Morgan Stanley. He has stated that during negotiations he was under considerable pressure from the president of the New York Federal Reserve, [[Tim Geithner]], to sell or merge Morgan Stanley to one of his competitors such as [[JPMorgan Chase|JP Morgan]].&lt;ref name=WSJ-WallStreetDied-2008&gt;{{cite news|last1=Craig|first1=Susanne|last2=McCracken|first2=Jeffrey|last3=Luccetti|first3=Aaron|last4=Kelly|first4=Kate|title=The Weekend That Wall Street Died|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123051066413538349|accessdate=12 November 2015|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=29 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mack saw this as being contrary to the interests of Morgan Stanley shareholders and employees, similar to the demise of [[Bear Stearns]] in a forced sale to JP Morgan for $2 per share, (the deal was later revised to $10 a share), and insisted on finding other sources of financing instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Mack on Saving Morgan Stanley, Inside the Bunker  |publisher=[[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]]|date=October 14, 2009 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9sQtmPAYO0 |format= [[Flash Video]] (26:22) |accessdate=May 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1974, she was one of the first two women on the Jackson County Legislature. She was elected to the Kansas City council in 1979.

Barnes was the first female mayor of Kansas City. Mayor Barnes has received the most credit for her work in improving [[Downtown Kansas City]] and working for beginning the revitalization of the urban core. She is also credited with the [[Sprint Center]] arena in Kansas City that opened on October 10, 2007. She was first elected mayor on her birthday in 1999, and re-elected for a second term in 2003. She was succeeded as mayor of Kansas City on May 1, 2007, when [[Mark Funkhouser]] took office.

At Missouri Democratic functions, beginning in April, 2007, Mayor Barnes made it clear that she was seriously considering a run for [[U.S. House elections, 2008|Congress in 2008]], and on May 14, 2007, she officially announced her candidacy. She was endorsed by [[Emily's List]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emilyslist.org/candidates/kay_barnes/ Kay Barnes, U.S. House, MO] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513002208/http://emilyslist.org/candidates/kay_barnes/ |date=2008-05-13 }} ''Emily's List''&lt;/ref&gt; On August 5, 2008, Barnes won against Ali Allon Sherkat in the Democratic primary with 84.5% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sos.mo.gov/enrweb/raceresults.asp?eid=195&amp;oid=44676&amp;arc= U.S. Representative - District 6] ''Missouri Secretary of State'' election results&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2007, Barnes announced she would run in the Democratic primary for Missouri's 6th congressional district, held by four-term [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Sam Graves]]. She had spent most of her life in the district; she lives in the 6th's portion of Kansas City, and grew up in St. Joseph, the largest city entirely in the 6th.  Although the race was initially thought to be competitive, Barnes was soundly defeated, taking only 37 percent of the vote.  She even lost the district's share of Kansas City.

She is Senior Director for University Engagement at [[Park University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.park.edu/news/kay-barnes-new-role/ | title=Barnes Appointed to New Position at Park University | publisher=[[Park University]] | date=July 2, 2018 | first= | last= | accessdate=2018-07-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marquis Industrial''' is an [[industrial park]] located in the [[North Industrial SDA, Saskatoon|North Industrial SDA]] Suburban Development Area of [[Saskatoon]], [[Saskatchewan]]. Industrial parks are usually located close to [[transport]] facilities, especially where [[intermodal freight transport|more than one transport modalities]] coincide.  [[Saskatchewan Highway 11|Sk Hwy 11]], and  [[Saskatchewan Highway 12|Sk Hwy 12]] are all accessed directly from Marquis Industrial. The [[Saskatoon John G. Diefenbaker International Airport]] is west of the [[Saskatchewan Highway 11|Sk Hwy 11]] [[Saskatchewan Highway 12|Sk Hwy 12]] concurrency along Idylwyld Drive.

==Geography==
The land was annexed from the [[rural municipality]] of [[Corman Park No. 344, Saskatchewan|Corman Park]] between 1975 and 1984 and 1990-1994. In 2005 land was annexed for Akzo (Marquis Industrial).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Saskatchewan Highway 11|Sk Hwy 11]] to [[Prince Albert, Saskatchewan|Prince Albert]] via [[Warman, Saskatchewan|Warman]], and  [[Saskatchewan Highway 12|Sk Hwy 12]] to [[Blaine Lake]] via [[Martensville, Saskatchewan|Martensville]] mark the western boundary. Commercial and industrial enterprises along both sides of 71st Street are the northern perimeter of the industrial park.

From the 1980s until recently, the portion of Marquis Industrial east of the rail line and north of the [[Silverwood Heights, Saskatoon|Silverwood Heights]] community was demarcated as '''Silverwood Industrial'''.

==Economy==
The Marquis Industrial park is a mix of commercial and industrial concerns. Merlin-Ford Lincoln is a car dealership located in the Marquis Industrial area and has not relocated to the [[auto mall]] in the Stonegate subdivision. Cover-all Building Systems, Case-New Holland agricultural machinery manufacturer, Peavey Mart, Maple Leaf pork processing facility, Akzo Nobel Chemicals Ltd., Beachcomber Hot Tubs, Centennial Plumbing and Heating are a few of the Marquis Industrial businesses. The Saskatoon Correctional Centre also is located in the Marquis Industrial park. NORAC Systems International Inc. opened their {{convert|2.87|acre|m2|adj=on}} land, [[Canadian dollar|$]]2.5-million industrial plant in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Transportation==
Until recently, the area was primarily accessed via Wanuskewein Road and Miller Avenue from the south and north and 71st Street from the west. An extension of Marquis Drive has now provided the region with its major road access, and in 2013 the city approved plans for a north commuter bridge off the east end of Marquis that will connect to an extension of [[McOrmond Drive]] from the east, providing a major commuter link between Marquis Industrial and the residential communities in northeast and east Saskatoon. The bridge is not, however, being considered a truck route.

'''Martifer''' is a family group based in [[Oliveira de Frades]], [[Portugal]], with over 3,000 employees, focusing its activity on the [[metalworking|metal construction]] and [[renewable energy]] areas.

The company launched its first operations in 1990 in the metal structure industry. In 2004, it entered the renewables business, leveraging know-how from the metal construction operation to develop the energy equipment division.

Martifer is market leader in [[Iberia]] for metal construction, and aims to become the top player in other specific markets, namely [[Europe]] and [[Angola]].

In renewable energies, Martifer would like to become established as an integrated producer of turn-key solutions for the wind and solar segments. Furthermore, within renewable energies, Martifer operates as a promoter of electricity generation projects, with a portfolio of holdings in projects at different phases of development.

Martifer SGPS, SA is the Group’s holding company and has been listed on the Euronext Lisbon since June 2007. In 2008, its core activity operating revenues reached EUR 650 million. The main shareholder structure is made up of the founding partners, through I’M SGPS, S.A., and the [[Mota Engil|Mota-Engil Group]], both control approximately 80% of the company.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.martifer.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2009, Martifer and [[Hirschfeld Wind Energy Solutions]], a part of [[Hirschfeld Industries]] in [[Texas]], United States, announced a [[Joint venture]] for the manufacture of [[wind towers]] and related components in the United States. The project cost was estimated to cost $40 million US dollars to build a new facility in San Angelo, Texas. Production was originally expected to reach a capacity of 400 towers a year by 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hirschfeld.com/news_item.asp?ID=18 Hirschfeld Industries press release] June 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; However, the operation was unable to compete effectively in the very difficult pricing environment for wind towers in the 2009-2011 time frame and the investment failed to reach its objectives. In July 18, 2012, Hirschfeld announced that it had acquired the remaining 50 percent of the joint venture from Martifer for a small cash payment, and as of 2014, had converted the plant to build steel bridge structures. The last wind tower was produced there in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Waller|first=Matthew|title=Martifer leaves wind tower plant: Hirschfeld buys out stake in company|url=http://www.gosanangelo.com/news/2012/jul/18/martifer-out-of-hirschfeld-partnership/|accessdate=July 19, 2012|newspaper=San Angelo Standard Times|date=July 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Martifer Out of Hirschfeld Joint Venture|url=http://stateofthedivision.blogspot.com/2012/07/martifer-out-of-hirschfeld-joint.html|work=State of the Division Blog|accessdate=July 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Waller|first=M|title=Martifer leaves wind tower plant|url=http://www.power-eng.com/news/2012/07/19/martifer-leaves-wind-tower-plant.html|work=Power Engineering|publisher=PennWell|accessdate=July 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mary Eleanor Brackenridge''' (March 7, 1837 – February 14, 1924) was one of three women on the first board of regents at [[Texas Woman's University]], the first women in the state of Texas to sit on a governing board of any university. She was active in women's clubs and was a co-founder of the [[Woman's Club of San Antonio]]. Brackenridge was a leader in Texas suffrage organizations and helped get the [[19th Amendment to the United States Constitution]] passed.  She was the first woman in San Antonio to register to vote. Although it's the Brackenridge name in Texas that is associated with wealth, philanthropy and achievement, Brackenridge qualified as a member of the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] through her mother's lineage.

==Background==
Mary Eleanor Brackenridge was born March 7, 1837 in [[Warrick County, Indiana]]. She was the eldest daughter in a family of eight children born to John Adams Brackenridge and his wife Isabella Helena McCullough. She is often referred to as Eleanor, or M. Eleanor, in historical documentation.  The family moved to [[Jackson County, Texas]] in 1853, but she remained behind and graduated in 1855 from Anderson's Female Academy in [[New Albany, Indiana|New Albany]], Indiana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Logan|first=Mary Simmerson Cunningham|title=The Part Taken by Women in American History|year=1911|publisher=The Perry-Nalle Publishing Company|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hnIEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA420&amp;dq=new+albany+indiana+%22Anderson%27s+Female+Seminary+%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xJe3UNGcArCUigLwoIDoBQ&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=new%20albany%20indiana%20%22Anderson%27s%20Female%20Seminary%20%22&amp;f=false|author2=Logan, John A|page=420}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her father died during the [[Civil War (United States)|Civil War]], and she and her mother later moved into the [[San Antonio]] home of her brother [[George Washington Brackenridge]]. He appointed her director of the [[San Antonio National Bank]] and the [[San Antonio Loan and Trust]], both institutions established by him. In San Antonio, she was active in the [[Women's Christian Temperance Union]] (WCTU), the [[Order of the Eastern Star]] and the [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)|Presbyterian Church]].  She was a member of the Texas Mothers' Congress, a predecessor to the Texas Congress of Parents and Teachers (Texas PTA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schmidt|first=May|title=Texas Congress of Parents and Teachers (Texas PTA)|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/kat02|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=December 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, Brackenridge was named vice-president of the San Antonio Health Protection Association, formed to combat [[tuberculosis]] in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Medical Insurance and Health Conservation, Volume 16|year=1906|publisher=Kress &amp; Owen Co.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=trxXAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA188&amp;dq=women%27s+club+of+san+antonio+%22eleanor+brackenridge%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=e6i6ULjkKqvFiwLD6YC4DA&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=women%27s%20club%20of%20san%20antonio%20%22eleanor%20brackenridge%22&amp;f=false|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MEBTSHA"&gt;{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=A.

==Women's suffrage==
Her achievements through women's clubs and suffrage organizations lived beyond her lifetime. Most notably, the Woman's Club of San Antonio and Texas Woman's University are still active today.  Through these efforts, she was able to promote the welfare and advancement of women and children.  In 1911, she made a study of the state's legal code and published a pamphlet entitled ''The Legal Status of Texas Women''.  The WCTU and women's organizations often worked hand-in-hand for suffrage. The Texas Woman Suffrage Association was begun in 1903 in Houston by [[Annette Finnigan]] who served as its first president. When Finnigan left Texas, the organization stalled. It was fused with new energy in 1913 and was renamed the Texas Equal Suffrage Association.  At the organization's convention in San Antonio, Brackenridge was named its president.  Within two years, the organization had twenty-one chapters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cullen|first=David O'Donald|title=The Texas Left: The Radical Roots of Lone Star Liberalism|year=2010|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press|isbn=978-1-60344-189-6|pages=134–137|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AZNEAqTauREC&amp;pg=PA135&amp;dq=suffrage+%22Eleanor+Brackenridge%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=L5u6UKq9A8WJiwLt74DQAw&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=suffrage%20%22Eleanor%20Brackenridge%22&amp;f=false|author2=Wilkison, Kyle Grant}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On June 28, 1919, Texas became the first southern state to ratify the passage of the [[19th Amendment to the United States Constitution]], giving women the right to vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Texas Senate ratifies women's right to vote|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/day-by-day/30244|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=December 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Brackenridge became the first woman in San Antonio to register to vote.&lt;ref name="MEBTSHA"/&gt;

===The Woman's Club of San Antonio===
On October 1, 1898, the [[Woman's Club of San Antonio]] was organized by Brackenridge and [[Marin B. Fenwick]].,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cottrell|first=Debbie Mauldin|title=Marin B. Fenwick|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/ffeen|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=December 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a precursor of other similar civic and social organizations in the city. The organization was the vanguard of Texas women's clubs in promoting [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage]]. Brackenridge served as the organization's president for the first seven years of its existence. There were eighteen charter members when the organization began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Guide to the Woman's Club of San Antonio Records, 1892–2004|url=http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/utsa/00051/utsa-00051.html|publisher=[[University of Texas at San Antonio|UTSA]] Libraries|accessdate=December 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club's organization included departments that focused on specific needs of women and children. The departments represented needs such as legal issues, employment for women, health needs, community activism, and educational needs. In 1905, the club established the Isabella H. Brackenridge Scholarship for students at [[University of Texas Medical Branch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The University of Texas Record, Volume 6|year=1905|publisher=[[The University of Texas]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_CrOAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=%22woman%27s+club+of+san+antonio%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=L3y6ULOMG4WJiwLFs4EQ&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22woman%27s%20club%20of%20san%20antonio%22&amp;f=false|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On July 8, 1926, the organization bought the [[David J. and May Bock Woodward House]] and currently uses it as their headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David J. and May Bock Woodward House|url=https://atlas.thc.state.tx.us/Details/5029005890|publisher=[[Texas Historical Commission]]|accessdate=December 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Woodward house was placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Bexar County, Texas]] February 16, 1996.

===Texas Woman's University===
Texas Woman's University (TWU) came into being as a result of lobbying efforts of individual proponents working in conjunction with the [[Women's Christian Temperance Union]] (WCTU), Texas Federation of Women's Clubs (TFWC), Texas Woman's Press Association (TWPA). and the [[The National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry|Grange]]. The Girls Industrial College was created by House Bill 35 of the [[Twenty-seventh Texas Legislature]]. It was signed into law by Texas Governor  [[Joseph D. Sayers]] on April 6, 1901.  The name was changed in 1905 to the College of Industrial Arts. In 1934 the school was renamed as Texas College for Women,  and renamed to its current [[Texas Woman's University]] in 1957.  The school's first board of regents was appointed by Governor Sayers in 1902. The three influential women who served on that first board were instrumental in the establishment of the university: Mary Eleanor Brackenridge, Texas WCTU president [[Helen M. Stoddard]] and [[Eliza S. R. Johnson]], wife of State Senator Cone Johnson and daughter of [[Elijah Sterling Clack Robertson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TWU Timeline|url=http://www.twu.edu/twunews/twu-timeline.asp|publisher=Texas Woman's University|accessdate=December 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were the first women to sit on a governing board of any university in Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thompson|first=Joyce|title=Texas Woman's University|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/kct37|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=December 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brackenridge served as a regent until her death.

==Family lineage and DAR membership==
Mary Eleanor Brackenridge was a member of the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]], qualified by an ancestor through her maternal lineage.&lt;ref name="Lineage"/&gt;

The Brackenridge name in Texas descended from [[Scotch-Irish American|Scotch-Irish]] Robert Breckenridge Sr., who emigrated from [[Northern Ireland]] with his brother Alexander c1730.  Alexander, whose descendents spell their name [[Breckinridge family|Breckinridge]], moved to [[Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Breckinridge|url=http://politicalgraveyard.com/bio/breckinridge.html#RQ603KDX7|publisher=Political Graveyard|accessdate=December 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Robert Sr., whose descendants spell their name either Breckenridge or Brackenridge, stayed in [[Cumberland County, Pennsylvania]].  Robert Jr. (c1735-c1779) was killed in an Indian raid. His son [[John Brackenridge (clergyman)|John Brackenridge]] ({{circa|1772}} – May 2, 1844) was raised in [[Washington, D.C.]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Records|year=1922|volume=24|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m_07AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA123&amp;dq=%22Rev.+John+Brackenridge%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fi-yULbzEOnLigLu0oHICQ&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Rev.%20John%20Brackenridge%22&amp;f=false|page=123|publisher=Columbia Historical Society, Washington D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and was appointed [[Chaplain of the United States Senate]] in 1811.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Senate Chaplain|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Senate_Chaplain.htm|publisher=United States Senate|accessdate=December 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Welk|first=Jesse W|title=The Real Lincoln: A Portrait|year=2003|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=978-0-8032-9822-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pMFlBVZtaWUC&amp;pg=PA318&amp;dq=%22Rev.+John+Brackenridge%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9SyyUL_UFqnYigKP2ID4DA&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Rev.%20John%20Brackenridge%22&amp;f=false|author2=Burlingame, Michael|page=318|chapter=G.W.

Isabella Helena McCullough (1811–1886)  married John Adams Brackenridge in 1827.&lt;ref name="Putman"/&gt;  Her maternal Scotch-Irish ancestor Rev. John Craig was from [[County Antrim]], [[Northern Ireland]]. Her father James McCullough was from [[Belfast]], Northern Island.&lt;ref name="Lincoln"/&gt;  The lineage of James McCullough's wife Mary Craig Grimes was the criteria for acceptance into the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]]. The parents of Mary Craig Grimes were William Grimes and Isabella Helena Baskin.  Tracing the lineage through Isabella Helena Baskin, her grandparents were Charles Baskin and Mary Craig. The DAR certified that Charles Baskin (1741–1822) served during the [[American Revolutionary War]] under General Daniel Morgan.&lt;ref name="Lineage"&gt;{{cite book|title=Lineage Book|year=1913|publisher=Daughters of the American Revolusion, Vol 37|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1WUZAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA186&amp;dq=%22Mary+Eleanor+Brackenridge%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xm23ULenOsy6yAGz1oGwAw&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Mary%20Eleanor%20Brackenridge%22&amp;f=false|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave|24835429|Charles Baskin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Galis played the [[point guard]] position during his [[college basketball]] years at [[Seton Hall Pirates men's basketball|Seton Hall University]], but turned into a [[shooting guard]] as a [[professional sports|professional]]. He spent most of his career in [[Aris BC|Aris]], before having a late stint with [[Panathinaikos BC|Panathinaikos]]. He is the [[EuroLeague]]'s all-time leader in points per game (counting both [[FIBA Europe]] and [[Euroleague Basketball Company]] era games [[1958 FIBA European Champions Cup|1958 season]]–present), [[EuroLeague Top Scorer|leading the competition in scoring]] eight times. In [[EuroLeague|the premier European club scene]], he reached the [[EuroLeague Final Four]] on four occasions, three consecutive times with Aris ([[1988 EuroLeague Final Four|1988]], [[1989 EuroLeague Final Four|1989]], and [[1990 EuroLeague Final Four|1990]]), and another one with Panathinaikos ([[1994 EuroLeague Final Four|1994]]). An eight-time [[Greek Basket League|Greek league]] champion, Galis is the [[Greek Basketball Championship career statistical leaders#A National Category all-time stats leaders (since the 1963–64 season) (unofficial)|Greek Championship's unofficial all-time leading scorer]], in both career points scored and career scoring average, counting all league formats (since the 1963–64 season, [[Greek Basket League career stats leaders|official stats are recognized since the 1992–93 season]]).

Galis led the senior [[Greece national basketball team|Greek national team]] to a [[EuroBasket]] gold medal in [[EuroBasket 1987|1987]], as well as to a EuroBasket silver medal in [[EuroBasket 1989|1989]], earning the [[FIBA EuroBasket MVP|tournament MVP]] honor in 1987, and being elected to the [[FIBA EuroBasket All-Tournament Team|All-EuroBasket Team]] four times. Among his myriad accomplishments, he holds the [[FIBA EuroBasket Records|EuroBasket record]] for highest career scoring average (31.2 points per game), and was [[FIBA EuroBasket Top Scorer|the leading scorer of four EuroBasket tournaments]] in [[EuroBasket 1983|1983]], [[EuroBasket 1987|1987]], [[EuroBasket 1989|1989]], and [[EuroBasket 1991|1991]]. In addition to that, he holds the [[FIBA World Cup]] [[FIBA World Cup records|record]] for highest career scoring average (33.5 points per game), as well as for most points ever scored in a single tournament, which he set at the [[1986 FIBA World Cup]]. Following the stunning success of the EuroBasket title in 1987, he won the [[Mr. Europa|Mr. Europa Player of the Year]] and the [[Euroscar Award|Euroscar]] awards the same year.

==Early life and high school==
Galis was born in [[Union City, New Jersey]]. The child of a poor immigrant family, from the Greek islands of [[Rhodes]] and [[Nisyros]], Galis took up [[boxing]] in his early years, after his father, George Georgalis, who had also been a boxer in his youth. He was later persuaded to give up boxing by his mother, Stella Georgalis, who was terrified after each time that her son would return home from boxing training with a new facial injury. As a result, Galis started playing the sport of basketball instead of boxing. He attended [[Union Hill High School]], in Union City, where he also played high school basketball.&lt;ref name="fibaeurope.com"/&gt;

==College career==
After high school, Galis enrolled at [[Seton Hall University]], where he played [[college basketball]] as a member of the [[Seton Hall Pirates men's basketball|Seton Hall Pirates]]. In his senior season, Galis saw his scoring average reach 27.5 points per game, which was third in the nation, behind [[Idaho State Bengals men's basketball|Idaho State's]] [[Lawrence Butler (basketball)|Lawrence Butler]] (30.1 points per game) and [[Indiana State Sycamores men's basketball|Indiana State's]] [[Larry Bird]] (28.6 points per game),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Magic Keeps Bird In Hand |url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1123258/index.htm |work=Sports Illustrated |publisher= |date=1980-03-13 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; including a 48-point outburst against the [[Santa Clara Broncos men's basketball|University of Santa Clara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://graphics.fansonly.com/photos/schools/sacl/sports/m-baskbl/auto_pdf/cablecar-history-12300.pdf|title=Cable Car Classic Records.|publisher=|accessdate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Also in his senior year of college, Galis won the [[Haggerty Award]] (the New York City metro area's best player award), and the [[Eastern College Athletic Conference]] Player of the Year award. The same year, he also played in the Pizza Hut All-American game, alongside Bird and [[Vinnie Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Galis and Larry Bird (Pizza Hut All American Game 1979) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUdOiTjIcxo |work=Youtube|publisher= |date=2010-03-10 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During his 4 year college career, Galis played in a total of 107 games and scored 1,651 points, for a career scoring average of 15.4 points per game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/nick-galis-1.html|title=Nick Galis College Stats - College Basketball at Sports-Reference.com|website=College Basketball at Sports-Reference.com|accessdate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Galis' head coach at Seton Hall, [[Bill Raftery|Billy Raftery]], would later state that Galis was the best player he ever coached. While at Seton Hall, Galis was a good friend and roommate of [[Italian-American]] professional basketball player [[Dan Callandrillo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.app.com/story/sports/college/2017/09/08/insane-nick-galis-journey-naismith-hall-fame-took-off-seton-hall/646390001/|title=For 'insane' Nick Galis, journey to Naismith Hall of Fame took off at Seton Hall|publisher=|accessdate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galis was later inducted into the [[Seton Hall]] Athletic Hall of Fame, in 1991.

==Professional career==
===Boston Celtics===
After finishing his collegiate career in 1979, Galis signed with agent Bill Manon, who also managed [[Diana Ross]]. Manon did not have Galis work out with any [[NBA]] team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interbasket.net/players/galis.htm|title=Nikos Galis, Greece - Player Profiles by Interbasket|website=www.interbasket.net|accessdate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galis was eventually selected by the [[Boston Celtics]] in the 4th round of the [[1979 NBA Draft]], 68th overall. Due to a severe ankle injury that Galis suffered during the [[Boston Celtics|Celtics]] preseason training camp of the [[1979–80 Boston Celtics season|1979–80 season]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/article/2017/08/31/euroleague-legend-nikos-galis-made-mark-five-greek-league-mvp-awards|title=2017 Hall of Fame: Euroleague legend, cast of NCAA standouts get their due - NBA.com|first=Scott|last=Howard-Cooper|publisher=|accessdate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the franchise was no longer interested in offering him a contract because [[Gerald Henderson]] had taken his place on the team, and his injury would keep him out for the foreseeable future. 

Galis then decided to pursue a professional career in [[Greece]]'s top-tier level [[Greek Basket League|Basket League]]. Later, while still playing in Greece, he would be offered [[NBA]] contracts by the Celtics and the [[New Jersey Nets]]. However, he turned the offers down, because at the time, and until 1989, [[FIBA]] did not have [[professional sports|professional]] status, and consequently did not allow NBA players to compete at the [[national sports team|national team]] level. Since playing with the senior [[Greek national basketball team|Greek national team]] meant so much to him, he stayed in Greece. Celtics legend [[Red Auerbach]] later said that the single biggest mistake he ever made in his career was not keeping Galis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://turkey2010.fiba.com/pages/eng/fe/10/fwcm/event-guide/p/nid/41921/legend-bio.html# |title=Fiba official website, Tribute to Nikos Galis |access-date=2010-10-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101107144242/http://turkey2010.fiba.com/pages/eng/fe/10/fwcm/event-guide/p/nid/41921/legend-bio.html# |archive-date=2010-11-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.celticslife.com/2011/10/top-5-celtics-that-never-were-5-nick.html|title=Top 5 Celtics That Never Were-   #5: Nick Galis|website=www.celticslife.com|accessdate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aris Thessaloniki===
[[File:Nikos Galis Keith Williams.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Galis (on the right), and [[Keith Williams (basketball)|Keith Williams]] (on the left), during a [[EuroLeague]] [[1991–92 FIBA European League|1991–92 season]] game.]]

After suffering an ankle injury in the [[Boston Celtics]] [[1979–80 Boston Celtics season|1979–80]] preseason training camp, which prevented him from receiving a contract with the Celtics, Galis made the move across the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], and signed to play with [[Aris BC|Aris]] of [[Thessaloniki]], Greece, in 1979. [[Panathinaikos B.C.|Panathinaikos]] and [[Olympiacos B.C.|Olympiacos]] had also shown some interest in signing the newcomer, but it was Aris' interest that was the most persuasive. His move to the country would eventually help Greek [[sports club|club]] basketball to reach a level of popularity that had never been previously imagined. 

Averaging more than 30 points per game every season, Galis was the indisputable leader of Aris. While playing alongside other great players at Aris such as [[Panagiotis Giannakis]] and [[Slobodan Subotić]] (who was known in Greece as Lefteris Soumpotits), Galis won 8 [[Greek Basket League|Greek League]] championships (7 of them consecutively, and 3 undefeated, in the years 1983, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, and 1991), 6 [[Greek Basketball Cup|Greek Cups]] (4 of them consecutively, in the years 1985, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, and 1992), and led Aris to 3 consecutive appearances at the [[EuroLeague|FIBA European Champions' Cup]] (now called EuroLeague) [[EuroLeague Final Four|Final Four]] ([[1988 EuroLeague Final Four|'88]], [[1989 EuroLeague Final Four|'89]], and [[1990 EuroLeague Final Four|'90]]). In the one disappointment of an otherwise glittering career with Aris, all three of the FIBA European Champions' Cup Final Four appearances ended in defeat in the semifinals, thus depriving Galis of the opportunity to shine all the way on Europe's biggest club stage, at the [[EuroLeague Finals|FIBA European Champions' Cup Finals]]. The team's performances and general standard of play, however, won the hearts of most basketball fans in Greece. Indeed, cinemas and theaters in Greece would often reduce their admission prices on Thursday evenings, when Aris was playing games, as large segments of the country settled down to watch them on television.

After a disappointing season in 1991–92, Galis was forced to leave Aris.&lt;ref&gt;Rabotas, G., ''Nikos Galis'', p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; The new management of the team, and the fact that the club was in decline, were the main causes for his departure. Galis, who adored the city of [[Thessaloniki]], had originally insisted on remaining in the club and playing for the team, as he believed that he still had a lot to offer the club.

===Panathinaikos Athens===
[[Image:Nikos Galis Panathinaikos 1992.jpg|right|thumb|160px|Galis with [[Panathinaikos B.C.|Panathinaikos]], during the 1992–93 season.]]

Galis moved to [[Athens]] in the summer of 1992, to play with [[Panathinaikos B.C.|Panathinaikos]], and he was the player who then led the "Greens" to a club rebirth, after it had suffered through a long drought period, during which the historical team remained without titles. The previous season (1991–92) had been particularly disappointing for the club, with the team finishing eighth in the Greek league. As the team's [[Captain (sports)|captain]], Galis inspired the young players of Panathinaikos, such as [[Fragiskos Alvertis]] and [[Nikos Oikonomou]], and gradually brought back hope to the team's fans. So much so, as to the point that the club's then home arena, [[Glyfada Indoor Hall]], was always overcrowded. In that season (1992–93), Panathinaikos finished second in the [[Greek Basket League|Greek league]], and won the [[Greek Basketball Cup|Greek Cup]], which was the seventh Greek Cup title for Galis.

The following season ([[1993–94 FIBA European League|1993–94]]), Galis was the FIBA European League (now called EuroLeague) [[EuroLeague Top Scorer|Top Scorer]] averaging 23.8 points per game in 21 games, and passer, averaging 4.7 assists per game, in 21 games. In the decisive game 3 of the EuroLeague quarterfinals, against the reigning [[EuroLeague|FIBA European League]] champions, [[Limoges CSP|Limoges]], Galis truly led Panathinaikos into a new club era, with their qualification to the [[1994 EuroLeague Final Four|1994 FIBA European League Final Four]], by scoring 30 points on 75% field goal shooting in the game. The "Greens" eventually finished in 3rd place in the FIBA European League that season, after losing in the semifinal, but it was still a success they had never reached before. Galis scored 30 points in the third place game against [[FC Barcelona Bàsquet|FC Barcelona]], leading all scorers in the game.

In his third season in Panthinaikos ([[1994–95 FIBA European League|1994–95]]), Galis teamed up with [[Panagiotis Giannakis]] and [[Žarko Paspalj]], to make a strong effort to win the FIBA European League. Galis was the player who led Panathinaikos to the Top 16 group, as he prevented the elimination of Panathinaikos by [[Budivelnik Kiev]], with a team-high 23 points in the decisive second-leg victory. He was also the leader of the team in the [[Greek Basketball Cup|Greek Cup]] win against [[Olympiacos B.C.|Olympiacos]], at [[Sporting Sports Arena]]. But Galis' career controversially ended on October 18, 1994,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazzetta.gr/basket/a1/item/105797-Ηταν-απλά-ο-καλύτερος Gazetta.gr Ήταν απλά ο καλύτερος {{el icon}}.]&lt;/ref&gt; a few games after the start of the Greek League 1994–95 season. [[Kostas Politis]], Panathinaikos' head coach at the time, chose not to include Galis in the starting line-up of a [[Greek Basket League|Greek League]] game against [[Ampelokipoi B.C.|Ambelokipi]]. Galis left the court, and never again returned to playing action.&lt;ref&gt;Rabotas, G., ''Nikos Galis'', p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; His last game in professional basketball, was as a player of Panathinaikos, in a game against [[Dafnis B.C.|AO Dafni]], on October 12, 1994. In the game, Galis scored 8 points in 35 minutes of playing time, as his team won in a blowout, 82–60.

==National team career==
On 20 November 1983, while playing in an [[exhibition game]] at the Demetria Tournament '83, with the senior [[Greek national basketball team|Greek national basketball team]], against the [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina Tar Heels]], at [[Alexandreio Melathron]], Greece's shooting guard Galis, while being guarded by North Carolina's [[shooting guard]], [[Michael Jordan]], scored 24 points during the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eurohoops.net/en/nba-news/511452/nick-galis/|title=Nick Galis versus Michael Jordan - Eurohoops|date=9 September 2017|publisher=|accessdate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VNv6gT1RWk|title=GREECE - NORTH CAROLINA (JORDAN vs GALIS, Oct. 20, 1983)|last=NickGalis Archive|date=7 June 2016|publisher=|accessdate=13 November 2018|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Galis next led the Greek national team to the [[EuroBasket 1987]] gold medal. Averaging 37.0 points per game during the tournament, he was named the [[FIBA EuroBasket MVP|MVP of the tournament]], after scoring 40 points in the final against the [[Soviet Union national basketball team]] and its legendary player, [[Šarūnas Marčiulionis]], for a 103–101 victory. Galis also led Greece to the second place at the [[EuroBasket 1989]], averaging 35.6 points per game. Galis is most remembered from that tournament, for a stunning effort against the Soviet team led by Marčiulionis, and its other star player, [[Arvydas Sabonis]], in the semifinal game. He scored 45 out of his team's 81 total points in a dramatic, last-gasp 81–80 victory.&lt;ref&gt;FIBA Europe official website on EuroBasket 1989 [http://www.fibaeurope.com/cid_f43ulKJBGLcVnbH-aqLVu2.gameID_937-4-A-1.compID_qMRZdYCZI6EoANOrUf9le2.season_1989.roundID_937.teamID_.html FIBA Europe.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek team then settled for a second-place finish, after losing against the ever-dominant [[Yugoslavia national basketball team|Yugoslavian national basketball team]] in the tournament's final.

With the senior men's Greek national team, Galis averaged 33.3 points per game at the [[EuroBasket 1983]], 33.5 points per game at the [[1986 FIBA World Championship]], 37.0 points per game at the [[EuroBasket 1987]], 35.6 points per game at the [[EuroBasket 1989]], and 32.4 points per game at the [[EuroBasket 1991]].

== Player profile ==
It has been noted that Galis was not only a legendary scorer, but that he was also a great play maker and passer. The majority of his points scored came inside the paint, due to his penetrating ability.&lt;ref name="ironman"&gt;Arbel, Y. ,"Iron Man Galis", November 08, 2006, FIBA Europe official website [http://www.fibaeurope.com/cid_wro9VQVdG7cxqdc3r6woH2.coid_OetsMywJJtcKppVVZ6xGT3.articleMode_on.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Galis' mid-range jumper was one of his biggest offensive weapons, being able to consistently pull it off under pressure. His post game was excellent, as he used his strength and leaping ability to counter his lack of height. Another enormous competitive advantage that Galis possessed was his incredible stamina, which was due to his exemplary physical condition. This led to his being given the nickname of "Iron Man". At the [[EuroBasket 1987]], he was never once substituted out of any game after the second day of the competition, completing 7 games in 9 days.&lt;ref name="ironman" /&gt;

==Post-playing career==
Since his official retirement on September 29, 1995, and up until early 2006, Galis was the owner of a summer basketball camp in [[Chalkidiki]], Greece. The basketball camp is listed at the [[Athens Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.galiscamp.gr/# |title=Official website of Galis's basketball camp |access-date=2006-09-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904231417/http://www.galiscamp.gr/# |archive-date=2006-09-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a token of appreciation for his contribution to Greek sport, Galis was chosen to be the first torch bearer in the final round of the [[Olympic Flame]], for the [[Athens 2004|Athens 2004 Olympics]]. Galis entered the stadium at the conclusion of the [[2004 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|Opening Ceremony]], and set off the procession of the flame to the altar.

In September 2007, Galis was elected as a member of the first class of the [[FIBA Hall of Fame]], which includes the best basketball players in the history of the game internationally. Galis was inducted as a player. [[Bill Russell]] of the famous [[Boston Celtics]] dynasty was another one of the 16 inaugural player inductees. Galis is also a member of the [[Eurobasket.com]] website's European Basketball Hall of Fame, inducted as a player. Galis is married to Eleni Panagiotou, and he has one daughter, named Stella.

In May 2013, his former club team [[Aris BC|Aris]], renamed their home arena to [[Nick Galis Hall]], organized a celebration of Galis' life and career, and [[Aris B.C.#Retired numbers|retired his number 6 Aris jersey]]. The event was attended by many of his teammates and opponents from the 1980s and 1990s. Attendees included Greek legends such as the majority of the [[1987 EuroBasket]] gold medal winning team, as well as international stars who played against Galis over the years, such as [[Dino Rađja]], [[Jordi Villacampa]], and [[Doron Jamchi]].

On April 1, 2017, it was announced that Galis will be inducted to the [[List of players in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame|Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]] as part of the 2017 class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/article/2017/04/01/tracy-mcgrady-jerry-krause-rebecca-lobo-naismith-memorial-basketball-hall-fame|title=Tracy McGrady, Jerry Krause, Rebecca Lobo headline Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame class - NBA.com|first=The Associated|last=Press|publisher=|accessdate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galis was accepted to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame on September 9, 2017. He became one of the very few basketball players from around the world, that joined the Hall of Fame, without having ever played in the [[NBA]]. On June 14, 2016, exactly 29 years after [[Greek national basketball team|Greece]] won the [[1987 EuroBasket|EuroBasket in 1987]], the biggest basketball arena in Greece, [[OAKA Olympic Indoor Hall]] was named 'Nikos Galis' in his honour.

{{Patriot Act titles}}
The [[USA PATRIOT Act]] was passed by the [[United States Congress]] in 2001 as a response to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]]. It has ten titles, with the [[USA PATRIOT Act, Title III|third title]] ("Title III: International Money Laundering Abatement and Financial Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001") written to prevent, detect, and prosecute international [[money laundering]] and the financing of [[terrorism]].

Title III is itself divided into three subtitles. The first subtitle, entitled '''Subtitle A: International Counter Money Laundering and Related Measures''', is designed to put measures into place that counter international money laundering. It does this by requiring that financial institutions take several new special measures against money laundering — identification is dealt with particularly; by restricting or prohibiting the use of certain types of bank accounts; through adding further legislation that regulates a financial institution's dealing with foreign concerns; by adding new penalties for non-compliance of the law; and through regulations that are designed to facilitate and encourage reporting and communication between financial institutions and the U.S. government.

==Sec. 311: Special measures for jurisdictions, financial institutions, or international transactions of primary money laundering concern==
{{wikisource|USA PATRIOT Act/Title III}}
A new section was added to Title 31, subchapter IV, chapter 53, subchapter II ("Records and reports on monetary instruments transactions") of the [[U.S. Code]]. The section was 5318A, entitled "Special measures for jurisdictions, financial institutions, or international transactions of primary money laundering concern". It specifies that financial institutions or financial agencies may be required to take special measures when so directed by the [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]]. Any such order by the [[United States Treasury]], with the exception of orders that require additional record keeping or reporting for any transaction over an amount greater than the Secretary describes, is issued with a notice of [[rule making]] regarding the special measure. Orders may not remain in effect for more than 120 days, though any ruling may be extended by the Treasury.

When the Secretary of Treasury orders special measures, that person must first consult with the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the [[Federal Reserve System]], any other appropriate Federal banking agency (as defined in section 3 of the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Act]]), the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]], the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]], the [[National Credit Union Administration Board]] and any other relevant parties the Secretary of Treasury decides to call on. The special measures must take into account whether similar actions were taken by other nations and multilateral groups; whether the measure will cause any competitive disadvantage for U.S. financial organizations; how the timing or impact of the decision will affect legitimate business activities; and what effect the action would have on U.S. national security and foreign policy.

The special measures must be undertaken for all transactions that are made outside the U.S. in areas where money-laundering has been identified as a concern. The measures involve:
# the maintenance of records of the aggregate amount of transactions made in such areas. Such records must include:
#* the identity and address of the participants in a transaction or relationship, including the identity of the originator of any funds transfer;
#* the legal capacity in which a participant in any transaction is acting;
#* the identity of the beneficial owner of the funds involved in any transaction, in accordance with such procedures as the Secretary determines to be reasonable and practicable to obtain and retain the information; and
#* a description of any transaction.
# undertaking reasonable steps to obtain and retain information on foreigners who gain a benefit of ownership of an account which is opened and maintained in the U.S., and yet who do not own the account itself (this is called [[beneficial ownership]])
# the identification of any foreign customers who are authorized to use or route transactions through a [[payable-through account]] in the U.S.

The section also details what is considered a "primary money-laundering concern". The Secretary of Treasury ultimately makes the decision on such areas in consultation with [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] and the [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]]. Several jurisdictional factors must be taken into account, including:
* evidence that [[organized crime]], [[terrorism|international terrorists]], or both, have transacted business in that jurisdiction;
* the extent to which [[bank secrecy]] or special regulatory advantages are given to nonresidents or [[nondomiciliaries]] in the jurisdiction;
* the substance and quality of administration of the bank supervisory and counter-money laundering laws of the jurisdiction;
* the relationship between the volume of financial transactions occurring in the jurisdiction and the size of the economy of the jurisdiction;
* the extent to which the jurisdiction is characterized as an offshore banking or secrecy haven by credible international organizations or multilateral expert groups;
* whether the U.S. has a [[mutual legal assistance treaty]] with the jurisdiction, and the experience of U.S. law enforcement officials and regulatory officials in obtaining information about transactions originating in or routed through or to the jurisdiction; and
* whether there are high levels of official or institutional [[Political corruption|corruption]]
The Secretary of Treasury also considers whether financial institutions facilitate or promote money laundering, balanced against the extent to which they perform and promote legitimate business activities. He or she must also decide whether the financial institutions is undertaking any of the special measures specified above when considering whether the jurisdiction, financial institutions, types of accounts, or transactions are or are not primarily a money laundering concern.

==Sec. 312. Special due diligence for correspondent accounts and private banking accounts==
Extra [[due diligence]] requirements were added to {{usc|31|5318}}. Each financial institution that has a correspondent bank account held and managed on behalf of a non-U.S. person must enable (or in some cases enhance) their due diligence policies, procedures and controls to detect and report instances of money laundering. The due diligence requirements focus on identifying the direct and indirect (beneficial) owners of the accounts.

Financial institutions must now undertake steps to identify the owners of any non-U.S. bank that is not [[public company|publicly listed]], along with the interests of each of the owners in the bank. It is expected that additional scrutiny will be applied by the U.S. institution to such banks to make sure they are not engaging in money laundering. Reasonable efforts must be undertaken to determine whether the non-U.S. bank provides correspondent bank accounts to other foreign banks and, if it is discovered they do, the U.S. financial institution is expected to try to identify the foreign banks the non-U.S. bank deals with.

Similarly, U.S. financial institutions must also identify the nominal and beneficial owners of any private bank account opened and maintained in the U.S. by non-U.S. citizens. The institution must undertake enhanced scrutiny of the account if it is owned by, or is being maintained on behalf of, any [[politician|senior political figure]] where there is reasonable suspicion of corruption. A "private bank account" is defined as any account that has over [[$US]]1 million deposited by one or more people who have a direct or beneficial ownership of the account. Further, the account must be administered in whole or in part by an employee, officer or agent of a financial institution, and who acts as a liaison between the institution and the owners of the account.

==Sec. 313. Prohibition on United States correspondent accounts with foreign shell banks==
{{usc|31|5318}} was amended to prohibit U.S. financial institutions from establishing, maintaining, administering, or managing a [[correspondent account]] in the U.S. for, or on behalf of, a foreign bank that does not have a physical presence in any country (otherwise known as a [[shell bank]]). U.S. financial institutions must also take steps to prevent the indirect servicing of a foreign shell bank by allowing a correspondent account to be established and maintained by another foreign bank who acts on behalf of that foreign shell bank. However, exceptions are made if the shell bank is an affiliate (under the control) of a bank that has a physical presence in the U.S. or if the foreign shell bank is subject to supervision by a banking authority in the non-U.S. country regulating the affiliated depository institution, credit union, or foreign bank.

==Sec. 314. Cooperative efforts to deter money laundering==
In order to foster improved communication between financial institutions, the regulators of the financial institutions and law enforcement authorities the U.S. Treasury secretary was directed to create regulations within 120 days after the enactment of the Patriot Act that set out how information was to be shared. The aim of the act was more to encourage law enforcement authorities and financial regulation agencies to share the information they had on foreign individuals or organisations engaged in terrorism. Due to the complex nature of the task on February 26, 2002 the U.S. Treasury initially put together a proposed rule to amend the [[Code of Federal Regulations]],&lt;ref name=Initial103CFR100&gt;[http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/po1044.htm Treasury announces USA PATRIOT Act Regulations to improve information sharing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060415003855/https://www.treas.gov/press/releases/po1044.htm |date=2006-04-15 }}, [[United States Treasury]], February 26, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; and then on March 14, 2002 they released [https://web.archive.org/web/20051129045328/http://a257.g.akamaitech.net/7/257/2422/08aug20031600/edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2003/julqtr/31cfr103.100.htm 31 CFR 103.100] which was entitled "Special Information Sharing Procedures To Deter Money Laundering and Terrorist Activity".&lt;ref name=103CFR100&gt;[http://a257.g.akamaitech.net/7/257/2422/08aug20031600/edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2003/julqtr/31cfr103.100.htm Also found at] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051129045328/http://a257.g.akamaitech.net/7/257/2422/08aug20031600/edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2003/julqtr/31cfr103.100.htm |date=2005-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The regulation allows [[FinCEN]] to solicit, on behalf of a Federal law enforcement agency, information from a financial institution or group of financial institutions. In order to gain such information, a law enforcement agency must provide a certificate which shows who is the target of the information request — the regulation states that enough information must be provided to the institution to allow them to distinguish between common or similar names — and a contact person from the agency who knows about the request. The financial institution must then expeditiously search records for information that satisfies the request, though at any time the institution can contact the law enforcement agency to clarify the scope or terms of the request. The information that an agency must disclose is:
* any current amounts held for a named suspect
* any account maintained by the suspect during the previous 12 months
* any transaction conducted by or on behalf of a suspected, or any transfer of funds where the suspect was the recipient or the giver of the funds
After identifying the account asked for by FinCEN, the financial institution must provide a report back to FinCEN with:
* the name of the suspect
* the number of accounts owned, or transaction made
* the [[social security number]], taxpayer ID number, passport number, date of birth, address or any other identity information provided by the suspect to the financial institution when they opened their account or performed their transaction

The regulation specifically prohibits the financial institution from using information provided by FinCEN to do anything other than report information back to FinCEN, make a determination whether to do business with the named suspect or suspects, or to help them comply with an order given under the regulation. Furthermore, the financial institution may not disclose that FinCEN made a request for or obtained information to anyone other than FinCEN or to the Federal agency who was using FinCEN to gather information about the suspects. Under the regulation,  financial institutions are expected to maintain appropriate security to keep such information confidential in order to satisfy the [[Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act]].

The section also allows financial institutions to share information with other financial institutions when so allowed by the Secretary of Treasury, and they are now legally immune from prosecution if they gather or share information relating to terrorism or financial money-laundering in order to identify and report such activities. The section also gives immunity against breaches of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act to any organisation who undertakes actions to comply with this section.

Finally, the section directs the Secretary of Treasury to produce a report semiannually to the financial services industry "containing a detailed analysis identifying patterns of suspicious activity and other investigative insights derived from suspicious activity reports and investigations conducted by Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies". This report must be distributed to every financial institution in the United States.

==Sec. 315. Inclusion of foreign corruption offenses as money laundering crimes==
Section [https://www.law.cornell.edu/usc-cgi/newurl?title=18&amp;section=1956&amp;type=titlesect 1956(c)(7)] of title 18 of the U.S. Code was amended to further include specific acts of unlawful activity in relation to money laundering. Unlawful acts include:
* making a financial transaction in the U.S. in order to commit a crime of violence,&lt;ref name=Sec315_18USC1956c7Bii&gt;Amendment made to {{usc-clause|18|1956|(c)(7)(B)(ii)}} — for some reason an extra parenthesis was inserted into {{usc-clause|18|1956|(c)(7)(B)(iii)}}, according to [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1956-#FN-1 Cornell University], this was probably mistakenly added by law makers&lt;/ref&gt;
* the bribery of public officials and fraudulent dealing with public funds,
* the smuggling or illegal export of controlled munitions;&lt;ref name=Sec315_MunitionsIllegalExport&gt;Illegal export of controlled munitions is defined in the [[United States Munitions List]], which is part of the [[Arms Export Control Act]] ({{usc|22|2778}})&lt;/ref&gt; and the importation or bringing in of any firearm or ammunition not authorised by the U.S. Attorney General,&lt;ref name=315_UnauthorisedFirearmAmmunition&gt;See {{usc-clause|18|922|(l)}} and {{usc-clause|18|925|(d)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the smuggling of any item controlled under the [[Export Administration Regulations]],&lt;ref name="Sec315_ExportAdminRegulations"&gt;Defined in 15 [[Code of Federal Regulations|CFR]] 730-774&lt;/ref&gt;
* any offense where the U.S. would be obligated under a [[mutual treaty]] with a foreign nation to [[extradite]] a person, or where the U.S. would need to submit a case against a person for prosecution due to the treaty,
* the importation of falsely classified goods,&lt;ref name=Sec315_FalselyClassifiedGoods&gt;Defined in {{usc|18|541}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[computer crime]],&lt;ref name=Sec315_ComputerCrime&gt;Defined in {{usc|18|1030}}&lt;/ref&gt; and
* any [[felony]] violation of the [[Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938]]

==Sec. 316. Anti-terrorist forfeiture protection==
This section allows the incorrect seizure of the assets of those suspected to be international terrorist to be contested. The contesting party can file a claim under the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] and can either assert as an [[affirmative defense]] that their property was seized improperly or plead an [[innocent owner defense]]. The act also states that:

:''In considering a claim filed under this section, a court may admit evidence that is otherwise inadmissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence, if the court determines that the evidence is reliable, and that compliance with the Federal Rules of Evidence may jeopardize the national security interests of the United States.''

However, this clause does not deny a property owner of their right to contest the confiscation of assets that are suspected to be owned by international terrorists under the [[Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution]] or under the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedures Act]]. It also does not limit the remedies available to property owners defined under the civil forfeiture laws defined in the U.S. Code.&lt;ref name=CivilForfeitureLaws&gt;{{usc|18|981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The section also made a technical amendment to the General Rules for Civil Forfeiture Proceedings&lt;ref name=GeneralRulesForCivilForfeitureProcedings&gt;Defined in {{usc|18|983}}&lt;/ref&gt; by amending the definition of the term "civil forfeiture statute" to exclude the [[International Emergency Economic Powers Act]] (IEEPA).&lt;ref name=IEEPA&gt;{{usc-clause|18|983|(i)(2)(D)}} was amended&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sec. 317. Long-arm jurisdiction over foreign money launderers==
[https://www.law.cornell.edu/usc-cgi/newurl?title=18&amp;section=1956&amp;type=titlesect Section 1956 of title 18] was amended in several ways. [[U.S. district court]]s are now given jurisdiction over any foreign person or financial institution where action is undertaken to prosecute them under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedures or under the laws of the country in which the foreigner is found. Offenses where the District court can have jurisdiction are in cases where that person commits an offense that involves money laundering under {{usc|18|1956}}; in cases where that person converts property that a U.S. court has seized; or where the foreigner is a financial institution that maintains a bank account at a U.S. financial institution.

The amendment gives the court the power to freeze bank accounts and property so they can satisfy a judgement under 18&amp;nbsp;[[United States Code|USC]]&amp;nbsp;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/usc-cgi/newurl?title=18&amp;section=1956&amp;type=titlesect §&amp;nbsp;1956]. The courts may appoint a [[Federal Receiver]] to seize or control all assets of a defendant in order to satisfy a judgement of the court. The judgement may be a civil judgement about money laundering; the civil or criminal forfeiture of assets;&lt;ref name=Sec317_Forfeiture&gt;Defined in {{usc|18|981}} and {{usc|18|982}}, respectively&lt;/ref&gt; or made against those who act as a [[Fence (criminal)|fence]]. The Federal Receiver is appointed by the court after an application is made by a Federal prosecutor or Federal or State regulator, and they must be an officer of the court. The Federal Receiver is governed by {{usc|28|754}} and is able to gain the same information about a defendants assets from FinCen, the Department of Treasury or a foreign government (where a treaty or other agreement is in place with the U.S. government) as a Federal prosecutor.

==Sec. 318. Laundering money through a foreign bank==
This section expanded the definition of a financial institution to be any foreign bank, as defined in section 1 of the [[International Banking Act of 1978]].&lt;ref name=Sec318_sec1IntlBankingAct1978&gt;{{usc|12|3101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sec. 319. Forfeiture of funds in United States Interbank accounts==
Section 319 deals with the forfeiture of funds in [[Interbank account]]s and the ability of Federal banking agencies to subpoena bank records or summons banking staff in order to gain access to bank records. It also gave U.S. courts the authority to order convicted criminal to return property located abroad. Paragraph (c) allowed a (since expired) grace period of 60 days from the enactment of the Act with which financial institutions were required to comply with the provisions of {{usc-clause|31|5318|(k)}}.

Any deposits into foreign banks are considered to be deposited into any Interbank account the foreign bank may have in the U.S., and thus any restraining order, seizure warrant or arrest warrant may be made against the funds in the Interbank account held at a U.S. financial institution, up to the amount deposited in the account at the foreign bank.&lt;ref name="18USC981k-1-A"&gt;{{usc-clause|18|981|(k)(1)(A)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Provisions were made to allow the Attorney General to suspend or stop such a forfeiture if the Attorney General determines that a [[conflict of law]] exists between the laws of the foreign country in which the foreign bank resides in and with the laws of the U.S.. The Attorney General must also decide whether halting such a forfeiture would be in the interest of justice and that it would not harm the national interests of the U.S.&lt;ref name="18USC981k-1-B"&gt;{{usc-clause|18|981|(k)(1)(B)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The funds that are forfeited in the Interbank account can be contested by the foreign bank under the general rules of civil forfeiture proceedings.&lt;ref name="GenRulesCivilForfeitureProc"&gt;The general rules of civil forfeiture proceedings are defined in {{usc|18|983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="18USC981k-3"&gt;{{usc-clause|18|981|(k)(3)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. government does not need to show that the funds being forfeited are directly traceable to the funds deposited at the foreign bank and the government is also not required to apply {{usc|18|984}}, which deals with the civil forfeiture of [[fungible]] property.&lt;ref name="18USC981k-2"&gt;{{usc-clause|18|981|(k)(2)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 319 requires a financial institution to respond to a request for information from a Federal banking agency within 120 hours of the receipt of the request. Federal banking agencies can request information relating to any money-laundering activities — financial institutions must provide documentation for any account opened, maintained, administered or managed by the institution in the U.S.&lt;ref name="31USC5318k-2"&gt;{{usc-clause|31|5318|(k)(2)}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[summon]]s or [[subpoena]] may be issued to any representative of a foreign bank that as a corresponding account in the U.S. — they may be required to include records (even those maintained outside the U.S.) that relate to the deposit of funds into the foreign bank. The summons may be issued to a bank with a representative in the U.S. or in foreign countries where the U.S. has a mutual legal assistance treat, a [[multilateral agreement]] or where the U.S. can expect that they will respond to a request for international law enforcement assistance.&lt;ref name="31USC5318k-3-A"&gt;{{usc-clause|31|5318|(k)(3)(A)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign banks who maintain corresponding accounts must maintain records in the U.S. that will identify the owners' real names and addresses. The banks must be able to provide this information within 7 days of receipt of the request.&lt;ref name="31USC5318k-3-B"&gt;{{usc-clause|31|5318|(k)(3)(B)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a requirement that when so ordered by the Attorney General or the Secretary of Treasury (they must consult each other first) the financial institution must terminate any corresponding accounts within 10 days. Corresponding accounts can be ordered to be closed if the foreign bank fails to comply with a summons or subpoena (see above), or has failed to legally contest the summons in the U.S.&lt;ref name="31USC5318k-3-C-i"&gt;{{usc-clause|31|5318|(k)(3)(C)(i)}}&lt;/ref&gt; A financial institution is further protected from liability if they terminate a corresponding relationship in accordance with the section,&lt;ref name="31USC5318k-3-C-ii"&gt;{{usc-clause|31|5318|(k)(3)(C)(ii)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in fact the financial institution faces penalties of [[$US]]10,000 for each day the account remains open after the 10-day limit has expired.&lt;ref name="31USC5318k-3-C-iii"&gt;{{usc-clause|31|5318|(k)(3)(C)(iii)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Code was amended by section 319 to allow a court to order a convicted criminal to return property that is located abroad.&lt;ref name=Sec319_21USC853p&gt;{{usc-clause|21|853|(p)}} was amended&lt;/ref&gt; If that property cannot be located, has been transferred or sole, is placed beyond the jurisdiction of the court, is substantially reduced in value, or has been comingled with other property in such a way that it cannot be divided without difficulty&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|21|853|(p)(1)}}&lt;/ref&gt; then the court may order that property be forfeited in substitution of the property that must be returned.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|21|853|(p)(2)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court can also order that any property beyond the jurisdiction of the court must be returned to the jurisdiction of the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|21|853|(p)(3)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a defendant enters into a pretrial restraint order to stop goods from being seized, then the defendant may be required to deposit the property either into the registry of the court, with the [[United States Marshals Service]], or with the U.S. Secretary of Treasury in an interest-bearing account.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|21|853|(e)(4)(A)}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the defendant refuses the law states that they will be charged with [[contempt of court]] and their final sentence may be enhanced under the [[obstruction of justice]] provision of the [[Federal Sentencing Guidelines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|21|853|(e)(4)(B)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sec. 320. Proceeds of foreign crimes==
The U.S. Code was amended to allow the forfeiture of any property within the jurisdiction of the United States that was gained as the result of an offense against a foreign nation that involves the manufacture, importation, sale, or distribution of a controlled substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|18|981|(A)(1)(B)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sec. 321. Financial institutions specified in Subchapter II of Chapter 53 of Title 31, United States Code==
[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode31/usc_sup_01_31_08_IV_10_53_20_II.html Subchapter II of Chapter 53 of Title 31, United States Code] requires certain reports or records from various financial institutions where they have a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax, or regulatory investigations or proceedings, or in the conduct of intelligence or counterintelligence activities, including analysis, to protect against international terrorism. Section 321 of the USA PATRIOT Act included [[credit union]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|31|5312|(2)(E)}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Futures commission merchant]]s, [[commodity trading]] advisors and [[commodity pool operator]]s in its definition of a financial institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|31|5312|(2)(A)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also defined in all legislation that the term "Federal functional regulator" includes the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]] (CFTC).

==Sec. 322. Corporation represented by a fugitive==
The U.S. Code was amended to disallow a corporation whose majority shareholder or owner is a [[fugitive]] from mounting an innocent owner defense to contest the forfeiture of property by authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|28|2466|(b)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sec. 323. Enforcement of foreign judgments==
The U.S. Code defines the means by which a foreign nation may seek to have a forfeiture or judgement notification enforced by a district court of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|28|2467}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was amended under section 323 by adding a new paragraph that specifies how the U.S. government may apply for a restraining order&lt;ref&gt;Pursuant to {{usc-clause|18|983|(j)}}&lt;/ref&gt; to preserve the availability of property which is subject to a foreign forfeiture or confiscation judgement.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|28|2467|(d)(3)(A)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In evaluating whether to issue the restraining order, the court may rely on information provided in an affidavit which describes the overseas investigation that is underway and why the property in question should be restrained.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|28|2467|(d)(3)(A)(i)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. court may also register and enforce a restraining order that has already been issued by a foreign court and which is certified by the Attorney General.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|28|2467|(d)(3)(A)(ii)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any objections to the restraining order must not include any made on grounds that are part of any parallel foreign litigation over the same property.

Section 323 places a large emphasis on the ability of a foreign court to follow [[due process]] when considering an application for a forfeiture or confiscation judgement to be registered and enforced in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|28|2467|(b)(1)(c)}} &amp; {{usc-clause|28|2467|(d)(1)(D)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of "forfeiture and confiscation" is defined to mean a final order of a foreign nation which compels a person or entity to pay money for "any violation of foreign law that would constitute a violation or an offense for which property could be forfeited under Federal law if the offense were committed in the United States".&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|28|2467|(a)(2)(A)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sec. 324. Report and recommendation==
Provisions were made to allow the Secretary of Treasury and various other agencies (including the Attorney General, the Federal banking agencies as defined in section 3 of the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Act]], the National Credit Union Administration Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission) the ability to evaluate the operations of the provisions of title III and make recommendations to Congress. These were to be made within 30 months of the enactment of the Act.

==Sec. 325. Concentration accounts at financial institutions==
A [[concentration account]] is a single account used for the internal purposes of a financial institution to facilitate the processing and settlement of multiple or individual customer transactions within the bank, usually on the same day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ffiec.gov/bsa_aml_infobase/pages_manual/OLM_037.htm Expanded Overview - Concentration Accounts], Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) / Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Examination Manual&lt;/ref&gt; Such accounts can lead to the concealment by financial institutions transactions made by customers, however section 325 bans their use for such purposes by prohibiting financial institutions from allowing clients to direct transactions that move their funds into, out of, or through the concentration accounts of the financial institution. Financial institutions are also prohibited from informing clients about the existence of such accounts and disallows any disclosure that may give customer a way of identifying such accounts that the financial institution may use. The section also requires that financial institutions document and follow methods of identifying where the funds are for each customer in a concentration account that commingles funds belonging to one or more customers.

==Sec. 326. Verification of identification==
The Secretary of the Treasury was given the task of prescribing regulations that set forth the minimum standards that financial institutions must undertake to verify the identity of customers who open accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|31|5318|(l)(1)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rules implementing section 326 became effective on June 9, 2003, although financial institutions had until October 1, 2003 to
come into compliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|31|5318|(l)(6)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The minimum requirements under the section require financial institutions to establish procedures to take reasonable and practicable measures to verify the identity of those applying for an account with the institution;&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|31|5318|(l)(2)(A)}}&lt;/ref&gt; maintain records of the information used to verify a person's identity, including name, address, and other identifying information;&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|31|5318|(l)(2)(B)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to consult lists of known or suspected terrorists or terrorist organizations provided to the financial institution by any government agency to determine whether a person seeking to open an account appears on any such list.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|31|5318|(l)(2)(C)}}&lt;/ref&gt; When prescribing the regulations, the Secretary was ordered to take into account the types of accounts available to financial institutions, the various methods someone can use to open accounts, and the various types of identifying information available to the institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|31|5318|(l)(3)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Bank Holding Company Act of 1956]], banks and other financial institutions are restricted from carrying out activities that do not relate to financial activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sia.com/capitol_hill/html/bank_holding_company_act_of_19.html Bank Holding Company Act of 1956], ''SIA Primer on Securities''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bank Holding Company Act of 1956]] Sec. 4(k) ({{usc-clause|12|1843|(k)}})&lt;/ref&gt; In these cases, the regulations must be prescribed jointly by the Secretary and each Federal functional regulator&lt;ref&gt;The section states that this includes regulators "defined in section 509 of the [[Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act]], including the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]]"&lt;/ref&gt; appropriate for such financial institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|31|5318|(l)(4)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Secretary also has the power to exempt such institutions from the regulations proscribed under section 326.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|31|5318|(l)(5)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The section also required a report with 6 months of the enactment of the Patriot Act from the Secretary of Treasury in consultation with Federal functional regulators as defined in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. As such, on July 23, 2002 the Department of Treasury, FinCEN, the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]] (OCC), the [[Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System]], the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Commission]] (FDIC), the [[Office of Thrift Supervision]] (OTS) and the [[National Credit Union Association]] (NCUA) jointly released a joint notice of rule-making in the [[Federal Register]] for banks,&lt;ref&gt;67 FR 48290&lt;/ref&gt; and Treasury simultaneously released an identical notice in the Federal Register for credit unions, private banks and trust companies who did not have a functional regulator.&lt;ref&gt;67 FR 48299&lt;/ref&gt; After a considerable response, alterations to the proposed rule making were made and Treasury and the Federal functional agencies released 31 CFR 103.121. The regulation sets out the minimum requirements for setting up a [[Customer Identification Program]] (CIP). These requirements for the CIP are that it must:
# be appropriate for the financial institution's size and type of business, and if it must have an anti-money laundering compliance program then the CIP must be part of this. Credit Unions, private banks and trust companies without a Federal functional regulator must have a CIP approved by their [[board of directors]],
# have identity verification procedures. These must include risk-based procedures that allow the bank to form a reasonable belief that it knows the identities of each customer. The regulation specifies what is required to identify a customer. If a customer does not provide sufficient information to allow their verification the CIP must include procedures the bank must undertake. The procedures must cover (1) circumstances when the bank cannot verify the customer's identity; (2) should cover circumstances when the bank should not open an account; (3) specify what terms in which a customer may use an account while the bank tries to verify the customer's identity; (4) when a bank should close an account after being unable to verify a customer's identity; and (5) when a bank should file a Suspicious Activity Report,
# have procedures for making and maintaining a record of all verification information gathered by the financial institution,
# have procedures for determining whether a customer appears on any government list of known or suspected terrorists or terrorist organizations - the bank must determine this within a "reasonable time",
# have procedures for giving adequate notice to customers that the bank is requesting information to verify their identities, and
# have procedures that specify when another financial institution will rely on another financial institution to perform any of the procedures set out in their CIP
The regulation allows any Federal regulator, in concurrence with the Secretary of Treasury, to exempt a bank or type of account from the regulations given.

==Sec. 327. Consideration of anti-money laundering record==
The [[Bank Holding Company Act of 1956]] makes it unlawful, except with prior approval of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, for a bank to take any action that makes another company into a [[bank holding company]] or subsidiary of one; for a bank holding company to acquire direct or indirect shares of more than 5% of a bank; for bank holding companies to acquire all or most of the assets of a bank; and in most circumstances for a bank holding company to merge or consolidate with another bank holding company.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|12|1842|(a)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Section 327 amends the Act to make the Board take into consideration the effectiveness of the company or companies in combatting money laundering activities, including in overseas branches.&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph (6) was added to {{usc-clause|12|1842|(c)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Federal Deposit Insurance Act]] prevents the merger of insured depository institutions with non-insured depository institutions without the written approval of a responsible agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|12|1828|(c)(1)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act was amended by section 327 to take into consideration the effectiveness of any insured depository institution involved in the proposed merger transaction in combatting money laundering activities, including in overseas branches, when approving such mergers.&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph (11) was designated as paragraph (12) and the amendment was added as paragraph (11) to {{usc-clause|12|1828|(c)(1)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both of the amendments only apply to applications submitted to either the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or responsible agency after December 31, 2001, and which were not approved by the Board or responsible agency before the date of enactment of the Patriot Act.

==Sec. 328. International cooperation on identification of originators of wire transfers==
The Secretary of the Treasury must take all reasonable steps to encourage foreign governments to require the inclusion of the name of the originator in [[wire transfer]] instructions sent to the United States and other countries, with the information to remain with the transfer from its origination until the point of [[wikt:disburse|disbursement]]. They must also report annually to the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate on the progress Treasury is making on this issue and what is impeding progress of implementing the wire transfer identification scheme.

==Sec. 329. Criminal penalties==
An official or employee of the government who acts corruptly — as well as the person who induces the corrupt act — by being influenced for any official act, who is influenced to allow or collude with any fraudulent act, or who is induced to take or not take some action which is in violation of the person's official duties will be fined by an amount that is not more than three times the monetary equivalent of the bribe in question. Alternatively they may be imprisoned for not more than 15 years, or they may be fined and imprisoned. All violations are subject to [http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sup_01_18_10_II_20_227.html chapter 227 of title 18, United States Code], and the provisions of the [[United States Sentencing Guidelines]].

At last, he was also member of the Conselho de Desenvolvimento Econômico e Social (CDES) of the President.

==Biography==


Paulo Skaf was born at Vila Mariana, a neighborhood of São Paulo, son of Lebanese immigrant and prominent entrepreneur in the textile Antoine Skaf and Clotilde Habeyche Skaf.  He attended the Colégio Elvira Brandão and finished his high school at Colégio Santo Américo. He studied Business Administration at Universidade Presbiteriana Mackenzie but dropped out before completion.&lt;ref&gt;http://ultimosegundo.ig.com.br/os-60-mais-poderosos/paulo-skaf/5213bc5f26db567e47000003.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, he met Luzia Helena Pamplona de Menezes, who arrived at the same year. They have five sons, Paulo, André, Raphael, Gabriel, and Antoine, and three grandchildren.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eleicoes2014.com.br/skaf/&lt;/ref&gt;

In his teenage years, he started working with his father, but his entrepreneurial spirit soon flourished and made him follow his own steps. Dedicated in textile, his mid-sized factories was located at the east side of São Paulo – one at Ipiranga, another at Mooca and one at Belenzinho. In order to consolidate all in one unit, years later, it was relocated to Pindamonhangaba, at Vale do Paraíba.

The arrival of the Koreans in Brazil and the downfall of his company’s products competitivity, he felt the necessity of a drastic measure and redirect his business. He then focused his investments to industrial construction sector.  It was only after his activities in the real estate businesses that he realized another one of his passions: politics.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eleicoes2014.com.br/candidatos-governador-sao-paulo/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business career ==
Skaf, besides business, stood out for his leadership and innovation in the textile sector, at the Sindicato das Indústrias de Fiação e Tecelagem do Estado de São Paulo (Sinditêxtil) and at the Associação Brasileira da Indústria Têxtil e de Confecção, for two mandates, where it developed an important part in the fashion industry.
In September 27th, 2004, it was elected, in his first mandate, as the President at Federação das Indústrias do Estado de São Paulo, at Ciesp, at Sesi-SP, at Senai-SP and at last for the Instituto Roberto Simonsen (IRS).

At FIESP, his management focused in research of Brazil’s sustainable growth. The aim was always to work in order to obtain structural changes capable to provide a better public services back to society, mainly at education, health and security. Thus, as the head of the institution, Skaf innovated with the implementation of full time education and articulated the integration between high school and technical school. Nowadays, Sesi_SP is the major institution of private school in the country. In 2013, the number of enrollment at Senai-SP, surpassed 1,2 Millions and 150 thousands at Sesi-SP.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dgabc.com.br/Noticia/102509/escolas-do-sesi-terao-periodo-integral-a-partir-de-2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Skaf also actively worked in tax exemption, debureaucratization of processes, increasing the investments of infrastructure and expand external markets. Created a “entrepreneurial diplomacy” policy, which helped in the formation of qualified human resources to operate in private sector with international matters and micro and small businesses act in the external Market, decisively contributing in the international insertion of Brazil.

Another striking moment in Skaf’s trajectory was the action moved against the CPMF (tax applied in financial transaction). This taxation was implemented in 1997 and abolished in 2007 after a fierce dispute in the Senate.  In São Paulo, Skaf worked hard in order that the matter was discussed at specialized sector. In December 13, 2007, Skaf was able to celebrate the end of CPMF as the Senate declared its end from December 31 of the same year and preventing its reestablishment in 2008. An official notice from FIESP on behalf of Skaf, declared a “victory of Brasil”.&lt;ref&gt;http://ojornaldoestado.com.br/paulo-skaf-tem-interesse-em-disputar-governo-de-sao-paulo-em-2014/&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also under his management in which FIESP led a campaign for two achievements: the creation of the General law for micro and small businesses and de dismiss of taxes over products derived from wheat, which led to a decrease in price of bread and pasta.

In 2009, one of the most successful actions of Paulo Skaf was the decrease of 30% over spreads, easing the obtainment of bank credit, therefore, generating employment and production. Another highlight was the leadership at FIESP, defending the receipt, from exporters, of credits related to the legal reimbursement of IPI provided at external sales.

In 2011, the campaign Energia a Preço Justo (Fair price for energy), with the aim to mobilize the population against the renovation without biddings from overdue energy companies. The result was a discount of 20% in the energy bills of brazilians, announced by brazilian government in 2013. This campaign was able to generate an economy of 30 billions per year.


From June 2011 to April 2012, FIESP promoted a strong mobilization towards the provisional measure to put an end at the port war, resolution nº 72, and that it should be approved by the senate. This measure proposed the annulment of tax breaks over imported products via discount over the Imposto sobre Circulação de Mercadoria e Serviços (ICMS) putting an end to the so called port war. 

Another important achievement for the industry was the dismiss of payroll. After two years fighting,  was enacted in 2013 the law that deprives taxation of social security contributions of employers in certain sectors, calculated over the payroll, which creates less pressure on the costs of those who produce and more Jobs for those who work.

In 2013, FIESP campaigned for the approval of the provisional measure of the Ports, which provides for the modernization of port facilities, stimulating competition and moving lower priced cargoes.

Also in 2013, FIESP and CIESP were able to stop the IPTU's abusive increase of an average of 55% in the residences and 88% in the commerce in the city of São Paulo, which was well above the readjustment of the workers in the period, with a preliminary injunction in justice. Thus, the city of São Paulo was only able to correct the IPTU for annual inflation.&lt;ref&gt;http://spnoticias.com.br/?p=10177&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political career ==


Skaf's political career dates back to the 1970s, when, as a young man, he decided to join CPOR. "My vocation has always been to serve Brazil." He once said in an interview. In addition to the business, Skaf was distinguished by his leadership as a leader of entities in the sector, such as the Sinditêxtil and the Associação Brasileira da Indústria Têxtil e de Confecção (ABIT).

On September 27, 2004, he assumed the Presidency of the Federation of Industries of the State of São Paulo (Fiesp). He also took over Ciesp, Sesi-SP, Senai-SP and Instituto Roberto Simonsen (IRS), as well as being the first vice-president of CNI. He was also a member of the Conselho de Desenvolvimento Econômico e Social (CDES - Economic and Social Development Council) of the Presidency.

At Fiesp, his management adopted measures such as the implementation of full-time education and the articulation of secondary education with the technician. This year, Sesi is the largest private education network in the country. In 2009, 1.2 million enrollments were registered in Senai-SP and 120 thousand in regular Sesi-SP education. Aside from this, Skaf also worked to tax exemptions, to debureaucratize processes, to increase investments in infrastructure, to expand foreign markets (created the "Business Diplomacy").

On September 30, 2009, Skaf joined the PSB, and in the 2010 elections, he applied for the PSB to government of São Paulo. Despite the socialist legend, Skaf presented neoliberal proposals such as the collection of tuition fees in state public universities. He was ranked 4th with 1,038,430 votes (4.56% of the valid votes), behind Geraldo Alckmin (PSDB) - 1st place and elected in the first round with 11,519,314 votes (50.63% of the valid votes) Of Aloizio Mercadante (PT) - 2nd place with 8.016.866 votes (35.23% of valid votes) - and Celso Russomano (PP) - 3rd place with 1,233,897 votes (5.42% of valid votes).

After invitation from Michel Temer, Skaf left the PSB in early 2011 and joined PMDB in São Paulo. Skaf was again a candidate for the government of São Paulo in 2014, now by the PMDB, obtaining the 2nd place with 4,594,708 votes (21.53% of the valid ones) - behind only the candidate for reelection Geraldo Alckmin (PSDB), who obtained 12,230,807 Votes (57.31% of the valid ones.

== Honors ==

'''Reminiscence therapy''' is defined by the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) as "the use of life histories – written, oral, or both – to improve psychological well-being.  The therapy is often used with older people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=chief|first=Gary R. VandenBos, editor in|title=APA dictionary of psychology|year=2006|publisher=American Psychological Association|location=Washington, DC.|isbn=978-1-59147-380-0|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This form of therapeutic intervention respects the life and experiences of the individual with the aim to help the patient maintain good mental health.  The majority of research on reminiscence therapy has been done with the elderly community, especially those suffering from depression, although a few studies have looked at other elderly samples.&lt;ref name=Webster&gt;{{cite book|last=Webster|first=Jeffrey|title=Critical Advances in Reminiscence Work: From Theory to Application|year=2002|publisher=Springer|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780826197832 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reminiscence]] serves different psychological functions, including the taxonomy presented by Webster.&lt;ref name=RFS&gt;{{cite journal|last=Webster|first=J.D.|title=Construction and Validation of the Reminiscence Functions Scale|journal=Journals of Gerontology|year=1993|volume=48|pages=256–262}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Webster's Reminiscence Functions Scale (RFS) includes eight reasons why people reminisce: boredom reduction, bitterness revival, prepare for death, conversation, identity, intimacy maintenance, problem solving, and teach/inform.  Psychologists have looked at using reminiscence therapeutically to improve affect and coping skills, although the effectiveness of this therapy has been debated.&lt;ref name="Watt and Cappeliez"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Watt|first=L.

==What is reminiscence?==

[[File:Robert N. Butler 2004.jpg|thumb|alt=text|Dr. Robert Butler]]
	
Reminiscence has been described as “the volitional or non-volitional act or process of recollecting memories of oneself in the past”.&lt;ref name=Bluck&gt;Bluck, S., &amp; Levine, L.J. 1998. “Reminiscence as autobiographical memory: a catalyst for Reminiscence Theory Development.” ''Aging and Society.'' 18, 185-208.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, it involves the recalling and re-experiencing of one's life events. This involves having an intact [[autobiographical memory]] in order to be able to recall certain life events. However meaningful the reminisce process ends up being, depends on how meaningful the memories being recalled are.&lt;ref name=Martin&gt;Martin, J.R. 1940. “Reminiscence and Gestalt Theory” ''The American Psychological Association.'' 52, (4), 1-37.&lt;/ref&gt; Different ways to make these memories more meaningful are to ask questions which suggest the importance of the event as well as using historical materials from ones past.&lt;ref name=Bluck/&gt;

There are different types of reminiscence which can take place. The two main subtypes are intrapersonal and [[Interpersonal psychotherapy|interpersonal reminiscence.]]&lt;ref name=Lin&gt;Lin, Y.C., Dai, Y.T., &amp; Hwang, S.L. August, 2003. “The Effect of Reminiscence on the Elderly Population: A systematic Review.” ''Public Health Nursing.'' 20, (4), 297-306&lt;/ref&gt; Intrapersonal takes a cognitive stance and occurs individually. Interpersonal takes more of a conversational side and is a group-based therapy. Reminiscence can then be further broken down into three specific types which are: information, evaluation, and obsessive.&lt;ref name=Lin/&gt; Information reminiscence is done to be able to enjoy the retelling of stories from one’s past.&lt;ref name=Gerfo&gt;Gerfo, M.L. 1980. “Three Ways of Reminiscence in Theory and Practice.” ''The International Journal of Aging and Human Development.'' 12, (1), 39-48.&lt;/ref&gt; This type can also be used to help someone who may be lacking interest in his or her life and relationships. The ability to recall good memories can help them remember what they do have to be happy about. Evaluative reminiscence is the main type of reminiscence therapy as it is based on [[Robert Neil Butler|Dr. Robert Butler's]] life review. This process involves recalling memories throughout one’s entire life and sharing these stories with other people.&lt;ref name=Gerfo/&gt; Often this is done within group therapy.  Obsessive reminiscence occurs when somebody needs to be able to let go of any stress of guilt that may be lingering.&lt;ref name=Gerfo/&gt; By working through these issues it allows them to be at peace with themselves. Reminiscence has also been used to help people deal with the death of a loved one.&lt;ref&gt;Comana, M.T., Brown, V.M., &amp; Thomas, J.D. 1998. “The Effects of Reminiscence Therapy on Family Coping.” ''Journal of Family Nursing.'' 4, (2), 182-197.&lt;/ref&gt; By sharing stories about the loved one's life they can remember fond memories and gain a sense of peace with the death.

==Method==

Psychological research has identified two types of reminiscence therapies that are particularly effective: integrative and instrumental.&lt;ref name="Watt and Cappeliez" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wu /&gt;  
*  '''Integrative reminiscence therapy''' is a process in which individuals attempt to accept negative events in the past, resolve past conflicts, reconcile the discrepancy between ideals and reality, identify continuity between past and present, and find meaning and worth in life.&lt;ref name="Watt and Cappeliez" /&gt;  An integrative life review provides individuals with the opportunity to examine events in their lives that may disconfirm negative self-evaluations associated with depression.  Many depressed people ignore positive information and focus on memories that support their dysfunctional views, so this therapy helps lead clients to seek fuller, more detailed accounts of their life story and more balanced interpretations of past events.  Participants review both good and bad experiences within the context of the entire life, which shows them that negative experiences in one life domain can be mediated with positive events in another.  Individuals may disconfirm global, negative evaluations of the self that are associated with depression and begin to develop a more realistic, adaptive view of the self that incorporates both positive and negative attributes.&lt;ref name="Watt and Cappeliez" /&gt;
*  '''Instrumental reminiscence therapy''' helps the elderly recollect past coping activities and strategies, including memories of plans developed to solve difficult situations, goal-directed activities, and the achievement of one’s own goals or goals one helped others meet.&lt;ref name="Watt and Cappeliez" /&gt;  Instrumental reminiscence therapy may exert a positive effect on individuals’ self-esteem and efficacy by recollection of successful experiences in which individuals acted effectively to control their environment.  This approach to reminiscence therapy puts roles and commitments that are no longer rewarding or attainable to the periphery and helps these patients invest in other goals that are more in tune with current conditions of living.  This can be especially helpful for the elderly who may not be able to do what they were once capable of doing.&lt;ref name="Watt and Cappeliez" /&gt;

==History of reminiscence==

Before the late 1950s reminiscence was seen as a negative symptom which often lead to mental deterioration. [[Erik Erikson]] introduced his concept of the eight stages of psychosocial development which involved the progression of one’s life and development from birth until death. The last stage known as late adulthood, brought up the idea of integrity vs. despair.&lt;ref name="Lin"/&gt; At this stage it becomes important for one to look back on one’s life with satisfaction before they die.  In 1963, Dr. Robert Butler published a paper on the critical points surrounding the importance of life review and reminiscence.&lt;ref name="Bluck"/&gt; Butler is credited with starting the movement of reminiscence therapy.&lt;ref name=Woods&gt;Woods, B., Spector, A.E., Jones, C.A., Orell, M., Davies, S.P.2009. "Reminiscence therapy for dementia (Review)." The Cochrane Library. 1: 1-34.&lt;/ref&gt; The next advancement in this area was done by Charles Lewis in 1971. Lewis was able to create the first experimental study of reminiscence.&lt;ref name=Lin/&gt; Lewis wanted to look at any cognitive changes that may occur from reminiscence as well as how people perceive themselves.&lt;ref name=Lewis&gt;Lewis, C.N. 1971. “Reminiscing and Self-Concept in Old Age.” ''Journal of Gerontology.'' 26, (2), 240-243.&lt;/ref&gt; This experiment proved to be worthwhile as in the following years this area became very popular to research. In the following years, research on reminiscence was focused on the functions and benefits of reminiscence. In 1978 The Department of Health and Social Security started a project called “The Reminiscence Aids Project”.&lt;ref name=Bornat&gt;Bornat, J. 1989. “Oral History as a Social Movement: Reminiscence and Older People.” ''Oral History Society.'' 17, (2), 16-24.&lt;/ref&gt; This project was done in order to start reminiscence as a therapy process. Finally in the 1980s, reminiscence therapy was recognized by institutions and has begun to be used as group therapy. During this time period, there was an increase in the number of professionals trained in this therapeutic process.&lt;ref name=Bornat/&gt; Reminiscence therapy has continued to be an area of research to this day. While there have been many studies done on reminiscence therapy lately, Butler and Erikson remain the two researchers most associated with this field of work.

==Theories of reminiscence==

===Disengagement theory===

Disengagement theory in reminiscence is used by some therapists and researchers and focuses on the patient withdrawing from social responsibilities.&lt;ref name=Lin/&gt; This movement away from social life is encouraged so that the patient (in many cases an elderly person) can brace themselves for the rapid changes associated with the end of life. In withdrawing from interaction with others, disengagement theory aims to prepare the person for the most powerful and taxing separation of death.&lt;ref name =Lin/&gt; The hope in using this therapy is that when death comes, it will not be as painful or upsetting an experience as typically thought. The notion can be a comforting one that instead of being fearful patients that participate in the disengagement aspect of reminiscence theory will no longer be afraid but empowered when meeting their end.

===Ego integrity theory===

Ego Integrity Theory is based on the individual having a sense of fulfillment and success when looking back on their life and accomplishments.&lt;ref name=Kasl-Godley&gt;Kasl-Godley, J., &amp; Gatz, M. (2000). "Psychosocial Interventions for Individuals With Dementia: An Integration of Theory, Therapy and Clinical Understanding of Dementia." ''Clinical Psychology Review'', 20(6), 755–782.&lt;/ref&gt; A person who has achieved ego integrity does not fear the uncertainty that comes with meeting their death. In a successful case of ego integrity theory the patient is at peace with the eventuality of death. This theory was developed from Eric Erikson’s stages of development in which [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development|Integrity vs Despair]] is a crucial stage for later life psychological development.&lt;ref name=Erikson&gt;Erikson, E. (1959). "Identity and the life cycle: Selected papers." ''Psychological Issues'', 1, 50-100&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continuity theory===

Disengagement and ego-integrity may offer tools helping the elderly or ill deal with the prospect of death but it is thought that Continuity Theory offers more profound insights when trying to fully understand the true meaning of reminiscence theory.&lt;ref name=Butler&gt;Butler, R.N. (1963). "The life review: an interpretation of reminiscence in the aged." ''Psychiatry'', 26, 65-76.&lt;/ref&gt; A passage from Lin&lt;ref name =Lin/&gt; illustrates the concept of continuity the best &lt;blockquote&gt;"As individuals move from one stage to the next and encounter changes in their lives, they attempt to order and interpret changes by recalling their pasts. This provides an important sense of continuity and facilitates adaptation. Change is linked to the person’s perceived past, producing continuity in inner psychological characteristics and in social behavior and social circumstances."&lt;/blockquote&gt; Reminiscence can provide a mechanism by which individuals adapt to changes that occur throughout life Continuity Theory requires the effective use of remote memory. Reminiscence processes occur in this type of memory which is usually the last memory system to deteriorate. Research has found that frequent exercise of this system improves general cognitive function.&lt;ref name =Lin/&gt;

==What is reminiscence therapy?==
Reminiscence therapy makes use of life events by having participants vocally recall episodic memories from their past.&lt;ref name=Wang/&gt; It helps provide people with a sense of continuity in terms of their life events.&lt;ref name="Jons"/&gt;  Reminiscence therapy may take place in a group setting, individually,&lt;ref name=Hsieh&gt;Hsieh, H.F. &amp; Wang, J.(2003. "Group reminiscence therapy for cognitive and affective function of demented elderly in Taiwan" ''International Journal of Geriatric Psychology''40,335-345&lt;/ref&gt; or in pairs depending on the aim of the treatment&lt;ref name=Jons&gt;Jonsdottir, H., Jonsdottir, G., Steingrimsdottir, E., &amp; Tryggvadottir, B. (2001). "Group reminiscence among people with end-stage chronic lung diseases" ''Journal of Advanced Nursing.'' 35(1), 79-87&lt;/ref&gt; Reminiscence therapy can also be structured or unstructured within these configurations.&lt;ref name=Stinson2006/&gt;   While the primary aim of reminiscence therapy is to strengthen cognitive memory components, a secondary goal may be to encourage either intrapersonal development or interpersonal development.&lt;ref name="Hsieh"/&gt; These individual needs will determine whether the therapy is conducted in a group setting or alone with a practitioner.&lt;ref name="Hsieh"/&gt; Memories are processed chronologically starting at birth and focusing on major, significant life events.&lt;ref name="Hsieh"/&gt; The focus is reflection, not simply recall.&lt;ref name="Hsieh"/&gt; Reminiscence therapy may use prompts such as photographs, household items, music, or personal recordings.&lt;ref name="Woods"/&gt;

===Applications of reminiscence therapy===
Reminiscence Therapy is used predominately in elderly patients&lt;ref name=Lin/&gt; This may in part be due to the common disorders reminiscence therapy has been used for are prevalent in the elderly, such as depression.&lt;ref name=Lin/&gt; It has often been used in nursing homes or assisted living facilities, as it provides a sense of continuity in one's life and therefore may aid these types of transitions.&lt;ref name="Jons"/&gt; Patients with chronic conditions may also benefit from reminiscence therapy, as they often suffer socially and emotionally.&lt;ref name="Jons"/&gt; Other issues have been addressed using reminiscence therapy, including behavioural, social, and cognitive problems.&lt;ref name="Jons"/&gt; Studies have found group reminiscence therapy sessions may lead to strengthened social relationships and friendships within the group.&lt;ref name="Jons"/&gt;

====Mental health and life improvement====
Many studies have examined the effects of reminiscence therapy on overall affect.&lt;ref name=Fujiwara /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wu /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chiang"/&gt;   One group of researchers implemented reminiscence therapy into a community in response to a rash of suicides.  The researchers administered the therapy to older adults (predominantly women) at a local community center for the elderly.  A questionnaire administered after the group reminiscence therapy session revealed that 97.3% of participants enjoyed the experience of talking, 98.7% enjoyed listening to others, 89.2% felt that the group work with reminiscence therapy would help in their daily life, and 92.6% wished to continue in the program.  The researchers suggest their results support the previously reported effects of increased [[life satisfaction]] and self-esteem.&lt;ref name=Fujiwara /&gt;  Another study showed that after one session a week for 12 weeks of integrative reminiscence therapy, institutionalized older veterans in Taiwan experienced significant increases in self-esteem and life satisfaction as compared to the control group.&lt;ref name=Wu /&gt; However, there is some evidence that RT can improve quality of life, cognition, communication and possibly mood in people with dementia in some circumstances, although all the benefits were small. More research is needed to understand these differences and to find out who is likely to benefit most from what type of RT. A recent Cochrane review (2018) concluded that reminiscence therapy can improve quality of life, cognition, communication and possibly mood in people with dementia in some circumstances, although all the benefits were small.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Woods|first=Bob|last2=O'Philbin|first2=Laura|last3=Farrell|first3=Emma M.|last4=Spector|first4=Aimee E.|last5=Orrell|first5=Martin|date=1 March 2018|title=Reminiscence therapy for dementia|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=3|pages=CD001120|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001120.pub3|issn=1469-493X|pmid=29493789}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Coping skills====
A few researchers have posited that the positive effects of reminiscence therapy are the result of increased coping skills.&lt;ref name="Watt and Cappeliez" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cappeliez and Robitaille"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cappeliez|first=Philippe|author2=Robitaille, Annie |title=Coping mediates the relationships between reminiscence and psychological well-being among older adults|journal=Aging &amp; Mental Health|date=1 September 2010|volume=14|issue=7|pages=807–818|doi=10.1080/13607861003713307}}&lt;/ref&gt;    Essentially, these researchers argue reminiscence therapy works because it increases the patient's ability to cope and deal with new situations effectively.

Self-positive reminiscences relate to improved psychological well-being through '''assimilative''' and '''accommodative coping''', while self-negative reminiscences are associated with reduced psychological well-being through their negative relationships with both types of coping.&lt;ref name="Cappeliez and Robitaille" /&gt;   Assimilative and accommodative coping are protective mechanisms through which the self establishes continuity and meaning for one's life.&lt;ref name="Cappeliez and Robitaille"/&gt;

*  '''Assimilative coping''' aims to alter the life situation so that it concurs with one’s preferences and objectives, helping people pursue personal goals despite limitations and obstacles.&lt;ref name="Cappeliez and Robitaille"/&gt;
*  '''Accommodative coping''' helps patients adjust their goals to accommodate constraints and impairments by revising values and priorities, constructing new meaning from the situation, and potentially transforming personal identity.&lt;ref name="Cappeliez and Robitaille" /&gt;

Instrumental reminiscence therapy facilitates two additional types of coping: '''problem focused coping''' and '''emotion focused coping'''.&lt;ref name="Watt and Cappeliez" /&gt; Problem focused coping involves the individual in a goal-oriented effort to alter the situation with an analytic approach to solving the problem.  Emotion focused coping helps to create positive interpretations of stress by focusing on personal growth,
helps the patient accept responsibility for one’s own role in creating the stress and a desire to address this stress, and a distancing of the self from the stressful situation by not being too serious about it or looking for the positive aspects of the stress.&lt;ref name="Watt and Cappeliez" /&gt;

====Depression====
Many studies have looked at the effectiveness of reminiscence therapy in clinically depressed older adults.&lt;ref name="Watt and Cappeliez" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wu /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chiang&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chiang|first=Kai-Jo |author2=Chu, Hsin |author3=Chang, Hsiu-Ju |author4=Chung, Min-Huey |author5=Chen, Chung-Hua |author6=Chiou, Hung-Yi |author7=Chou, Kuei-Ru|title=The effects of reminiscence therapy on psychological well-being, depression, and loneliness among the institutionalized aged|journal=International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry|date=1 April 2010|volume=25|issue=4|pages=380–388|doi=10.1002/gps.2350}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cully&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cully|first=J.A.|author2=LaVoie, D. |author3=Gfeller, J.D. |title=Reminiscence, personality, and psychological functioning in older adults|journal=The Gerontologist|year=2001|volume=4|issue=1|pages=89–95|doi=10.1093/geront/41.1.89}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Karimi|first=H.|author2=Dolatshahee, B. |author3=Momeni, K. |author4=Khodabakhshi, A. |author5=Rezaei, M. |author6=Kamrani, A.A. |title=Effectiveness of integrative and instrumental reminiscence therapies on depression symptoms reduction in institutionalized older adults: An empirical study|journal=Aging &amp; Mental Health|date=1 September 2010|volume=14|issue=7|pages=881–887|doi=10.1080/13607861003801037}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s10597-009-9246-z | title=The Effects of Integrative Reminiscence on Depressive Symptomatology and Mastery of Older Adults | journal=Community Mental Health Journal | date=2009 | volume=45 | issue=6 | pages=476–484 | first=Ernst | last=Bohlmeijer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Housden|first=S.|title=The use of reminiscence in the prevention and treatment of depression in older people living in care home: A literature review|journal=Groupwork: An Interdisciplinary Journal for Working with Groups|year=2009|volume=19|issue=2|pages=28–45|doi=10.1921/095182410x490296}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This research suggests reminiscence therapy is a very effective way to reduce depressive symptoms in the elderly.  Integrative and instrumental reminiscence therapy helped participants' affect improve over the long term by significantly decreasing depressive symptoms.&lt;ref name="Watt and Cappeliez" /&gt; Another study found that after 12 weeks of integrative reminiscence therapy, institutionalized older veterans experienced significant decreases in depressive symptoms.&lt;ref name=Wu /&gt;   Older adults with depressive symptoms frequently reminisce as a way to refresh bitter memories, reduce boredom, and prepare for death from Webster's taxonomy (as opposed to conversation, teach/inform, intimacy maintenance, problem solving, identity).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cully|first=J.A.|author2=LaVoie, D. |author3=Gfeller, J.D. |title=Reminiscence, personality, and psychological functioning in older adults|journal=The Gerontologist|year=2001|volume=41|issue=1|pages=89–95|doi=10.1093/geront/41.1.89}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to this finding, the researchers concluded that if depressed older adults were already reminiscing, although in negative ways, they would make good candidates for reminiscence therapy since they would be comfortable with this activity.  Reminiscence therapy may even help alleviate depressive symptoms in patients also suffering from cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ando|first=M. |author2=Tsuda, Akira |author3=Moorey, Stirling|title=Preliminary study of reminiscence therapy on depression and self-esteem in cancer patients|journal=Psychological Reports|date=1 April 2006|volume=98|issue=2|pages=339–346|doi=10.2466/PR0.98.2.339-346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dementia====
Researchers have also studied the effects of reminiscence therapy on older adults who suffer from dementia.&lt;ref name=Tadaka /&gt;&lt;ref name=Brooker&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brooker|first=D.|author2=Duce, L.L. |title=Wellbeing and activity in dementia: A comparison of group reminiscence therapy, structured goal-directed group activity and unstructured time|journal=Aging and Mental Health|year=2000|volume=4|issue=4|pages=354–358|doi=10.1080/713649967}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tanaka&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tanaka|first=Katsuaki |author2=Yamada, Yukiko |author3=Kobayashi, Yoshio |author4=Sonohara, Kazuki |author5=Machida, Ayako |author6=Nakai, Ryuhei |author7=Kozaki, Koichi |author8=Toba, Kenji|title=Improved cognitive function, mood and brain blood flow in single photon emission computed tomography following individual reminiscence therapy in an elderly patient with Alzheimer's disease|journal=Geriatrics &amp; Gerontology International|date=1 September 2007|volume=7|issue=3|pages=305–309|doi=10.1111/j.1447-0594.2007.00418.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kunz&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kunz|first=J.A.|title=Targeted reminiscence interventions for older adults with dementia|journal=Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry|year=2002|volume=35|issue=1|pages=25–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kim&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kim|first=E.S.|author2=Cleary, S.J. |author3=Hopper, T. |author4=Bayles, K.A. |author5=Mahendra, N. |author6=Azuma, T. |author7=Rackley, A. |title=Evidence-based practive recommendations for working with individuals with dementia: group reminiscence therapy|journal=Journal of Medical Speech-Language Pathology|year=2006|volume=14|issue=3|pages=xxiii-xxxiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shik&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shik|first=A.Y.|author2=Yue, J. |author3=Tang, K. |title=Life is beautiful: Using reminiscence groups to promote well-being among Chinese older people with mild dementia|journal=Groupwork: An Interdisciplinary Journal for Working with Groups|year=2009|volume=19|issue=2|pages=8–27|doi=10.1921/095182410x490368}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In particular, studies have focused on two main benefits of reminiscence therapy for demented elderly: improved cognitive function and an improvement in quality of life (with a focus on improved emotions and overall happiness/mood).&lt;ref name=Wang&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wang JJ |title=Group reminiscence therapy for cognitive and affective function of demented elderly in Taiwan |journal=Int J Geriatr Psychiatry |volume=22 |issue=12 |pages=1235–40 |year=2007 |pmid=17503545 |doi=10.1002/gps.1821 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Okumura&gt;Okumura, Y., Tanimukai, S., &amp; Asada, T. (2008). "Effects of short-term reminiscence therapy on elderly with dementia: A comparison with everyday conversation approaches". ''Psychogeriatrics'', ''8''(3), 124-133.&lt;/ref&gt;

A study in 2007 looked at how reminiscence therapy affected both cognitive and affective function in 102 demented elderly.  The study used established scales to determine the effect of reminiscence treatment using a pre- and post-test self-report design.  For cognitive function, the study used the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).  For affective function the researchers used the Geriatric Depression Scale short form (GDS-SF) to determine the personal opinion of the demented elderly on their state of well-being and the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD) to analyze how their caregivers felt the patient was doing emotionally.  The randomized study found significant improvements in both the MMSE and CSDD scores pre to post test, which is an encouraging sign that reminiscence therapy has a positive effect in helping both cognitive and emotional functions for the demented elderly.&lt;ref name="Wang"/&gt;

One of the questions in seeing improvement through reminiscence therapy is if the gains are because of the actual type of therapy being used (reminiscing about certain subjects) or if just the increase social interactions with peers causes the progress in cognition and overall mood.  A study in 2008 examined this, using an experimental group treated with reminiscence therapy and a control group where they also had group conversations about every-day subjects.  MMSE was used to determine the level of dementia prior to the study, and like the 2007 study, examined the cognitive and affective effect of both the reminiscence and conversation therapies on the two groups.  For cognition the groups were given a four-item verbal fluency test.  For evaluating the participants’ mood, quality of daily life, and interest in the treatment, the study used the Todai-shiki Observational Rating Scale (TORS), and for self-report on their overall happiness, the participants took the Saint Marianna Hospital’s Elderly Dementia Patients’ Daycare Evaluation Table.  The results in cognition agreed with the 2007 study, with the reminiscence group recalling more words pre to post test.  The control conversation group, however, saw a decrease in words recalled from pre to post test, supporting the argument that it is the actual reminiscing type of therapy that causes the positive cognitive effect, not just any conversation with peers.  Finally, the study also showed improvements in both TORS and the Daycare Evaluation Table scores for the reminiscence group over the control, meaning the participants were happier, had improved quality of daily life, and were more attentive to treatment, compared to pre-treatment and versus control group results.&lt;ref name="Okumura"/&gt;

One study looked at reminiscence therapy for people with two types of dementia: [[Alzheimer's disease]] and [[vascular dementia]].&lt;ref name=Tadaka /&gt;   Those with Alzheimer's disease experienced significant improvement of withdrawal (so they withdrew less and interacted with others more) compared with the control group immediately after intervention.  Participants suffering from vascular dementia showed significant improvement of withdrawal and cognitive function compared with the control immediately after intervention and after a 6 month follow up.&lt;ref name=Tadaka /&gt;   Sustained intervention may be required to maintain these effects over time, especially in elderly people with Alzheimer’s disease whose improvement in withdrawal was no longer seen after 6 months.

One study that explored the effects of reminiscence therapy on those diagnosed with dementia found that the participants who received reminiscence therapy experienced significantly higher well-being than participants who had been in either the goal-directed group activity or unstructured free time.&lt;ref name=Brooker /&gt;   A case-study of an 88-year-old man suffering from [[Alzheimer's disease]] showed that he experienced improved cognitive functioning after individual reminiscence therapy.&lt;ref name=Tanaka /&gt;

==Outcomes==
To evaluate the changes the patients who undergo reminiscence therapy various behavioural measures are used and recently, brain imaging has begun to be a part of the assessment after treatment.

=== Behavioural evaluation===
The most frequent characteristics used to measure the outcome of reminiscence therapy on the patients involved are:&lt;ref name=Pinquart&gt;Pinquart, M. and Forstmeier, S. 2012. "Effects of reminiscence interventions on psychosocial outcomes: A meta-analysis." ''Aging and Mental Health.'' 1-18.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Depressive symptoms
* Psychological well-being
* Ego-integrity
* Meaning or purpose in life
* Mastery
* Cognitive performance
* Social interactions

===Neuroimaging===
In patients with vascular dementia, a significant increase in cortical glucose metabolism in bilateral anterior [[cingulate cortex|cingulate]] and in the left inferior [[temporal lobe]], which are areas important for social interaction and remote memories, respectively.&lt;ref name=Akanuma&gt;Akanuma, K., Meguro, K., Meguro, M., Sasaki, E., Chiba, K., Ishii, H., and Tanaka, N. 2010. "Improved social interaction and increased anterior cingulate metabolism after group reminiscence with reality orientation approach for vascular dementia." ''Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging.'' 192: 183–187&lt;/ref&gt; The use of [[single photon emission computed tomography]] on an elderly patient with [[Alzheimer's Disease]] revealed greater blood flow to the [[frontal lobe]] of the brain, an area that degenerates in those with this disease. This was coupled with positive changes in evaluated behavioural traits.&lt;ref name=Tanaka/&gt;

===Influencing factors===
Overall, positive outcomes seem to result from reminiscence therapy, although to differing degrees. The variability in the results is thought to be due to various factors, including the form of reminiscence therapy, the format of the sessions (group versus individual setting), the number of sessions completed, the health, age and gender of the individual, where the patient lives and if the individual had experienced any events that cause major changes in their life.

An evaluation on the '''forms''' of reminiscence therapy found life-review therapy had the strongest positive effects on psychological well being when compared to other life review and simple reminiscence.&lt;ref name=Pinquart/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bohlmeijer&gt;Bohlmeijer, E., Roemer, M, Phd, P.C and Smit, F. 2007. "The effects of reminiscence on psychological well-being in older adults: A meta-analysis." ''Aging and Mental Health''. 11:3, 291-300&lt;/ref&gt; Life review has been thought to produce greater positive effects compared to reminiscence therapy, due to the increased organization of methods and purpose of this therapy. The benefits of reminiscence therapy occurs independent of the '''format''' of the therapy.

Many specific groups have been targeted for studying the effects of reminiscence therapy and were evaluated using different measures based on their previously existing condition and the problems associated with it. Those ranking higher in their [[Depression (mood)|depression]] rating showed a greater rate of improvement of their symptoms compared to those exhibiting less depressive symptoms before the therapy began, although improvements were seen across depression levels.&lt;ref name=Bohlmeijer/&gt; Across studies, reminiscence therapy positively influenced patients with [[dementia]] evaluated using various measures &lt;ref name="Woods"/&gt; Specifically in vascular dementia, cortical glucose metabolism increase in areas important for social interaction and remote memories.&lt;ref name=Akanuma/&gt; Those with Alzheimer's Disease had improved blood flow to areas in brain, as previously discussed, and positive changes in evaluated behavioural traits.&lt;ref name=Tanaka/&gt; In patients with [[leprosy]], the greatest positive effects were seen in those with depression but reminiscence therapy did not effect the stage of dementia or cognitive scores.&lt;ref name=Su&gt;Su, T.S., Wu, L.L., and Lin, C.P. 2012.

Initially reminiscence was intended for older adults. However, this therapy my prove to be a valuable tool for adults at earlier stages of their life as well. In the '''elderly''', improvement in satisfaction with life and self, self-esteem, increase in social involvement which led to an improvement in their ability to deal with social situations, lower loneliness and alienation.&lt;ref name=Fujiwara/&gt; In addition, depressive symptoms, psychological symptoms, psychological well-being, ego-integrity, meaning of/purpose in life, mastery, cognitive performance, social integration, preparation for death all showed improvements after the therapy was concluded. At a follow up depression, other indicators of mental health, well-being, ego-integrity, cognitive performance, death preparation all remained to be improved from pre treatment.&lt;ref name=Pinquart/&gt; Improvements comparable to those found in the elderly have been found in studies that included '''younger''' age brackets.&lt;ref name=Pinquart/&gt; Improvements in depression occur in both females &lt;ref name=Stinson2006&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Stinson CK, Kirk E |title=Structured reminiscence: an intervention to decrease depression and increase self-transcendence in older women |journal=J Clin Nurs |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=208–18 |year=2006 |pmid=16422738 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2702.2006.01292.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; and males.&lt;ref name=Wu/&gt; Comparative analysis between males and females on the effects of reminiscence therapy found no evidence for a difference in the success of the therapy between '''genders'''.&lt;ref name=Pinquart/&gt; Reminiscence therapy has been conducted in groups composed of '''residents''' from group centres and those living in broader communities. Recent analysis suggests that no differences in outcomes from reminiscence exist between the type of community that the individuals are living in during the time of therapy,&lt;ref name=Pinquart/&gt; which contradicts the earlier findings that those living in group homes or care centres benefited less from these programs.&lt;ref name=Bohlmeijer/&gt; Those who experienced various major '''life events''' showed improved mental stability including a decrease in depressive symptoms and anxiety.&lt;ref name=Korte&gt;Korte, J., Bohlmeijer, E.T, Westerhof, G.J and Pot, A.M. 2011. "Reminiscence and adaptation to critical life events in older adults with mild to moderate depressive symptoms." ''Aging and Mental Health''.15(5):638-646&lt;/ref&gt; Institutionalized elderly male veterans showed increased self-esteem and life satisfaction and a decrease in symptoms of depression who were involved in a 12-week reminiscence therapy program compared to those that were not.&lt;ref name=Wu/&gt;

==Summary==
Overall, reminiscence therapy is an inexpensive and potentially beneficial approach to helping the elderly age successfully and happily.  It appears to provide them with a sense of overall life satisfaction and coping skills, and may also help to ameliorate the symptoms of depression and dementia.&lt;ref name="Hill 265–272"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lin 297–306"/&gt;

'''Screen Digest''' Ltd is a company providing [[business intelligence]], research and analysis on the global media markets based in [[London]], United Kingdom, that has grown out of a monthly journal of that name that was founded in 1971. It was acquired by the technology researcher iSuppli in 2010, which was in turn acquired by information services company [[IHS Inc.]]

== Company history ==
''Screen Digest'' was founded in 1971 by journalist and documentary film-maker [[John Chittock]], then film and video correspondent of the [[Financial Times]], together with his business partner and wife Joy Chittock.  Initially it was a news digest containing abstracts of a range of media, including film and cinema, television and in particular the nascent video sector and with editorial emphasis on the relevance and brevity of stories.

From the first issue,&lt;ref&gt;''Screen Digest'', October 1971. London: Screen Digest, 1971, 12pp&lt;/ref&gt; it has been characterised by the use of [[Computer icon|icons]] to identify the broad media subject area of each news story and the inclusion of contact information for companies and organisations mentioned in news items.  Other features from the start were the inclusion in the subscription of a free binder and detailed annual index, based on the concept of acting as a [[journal of record]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

In February 1972 a four-page centre section on yellow paper was introduced, initially to carry a page of reference material and articles from members of the industry. Among early contributors were Robert W Sarnoff, then chairman of [[RCA]], film director and teacher [[Thorold Dickinson]] and the [[BBC]] director-general [[Charles Curran (broadcaster)|Charles Curran]].  This developed into a data-related eight-page section based on the company's recent research.  Also in that month [[David Fisher (editor)|David Fisher]] joined as news editor and led in the shaping of the standards of the commercial publication.  He became editor in July 1974 and held that position until January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Update by FIsher&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid 1970s, Chittock and Fisher produced a daily half-hour closed-circuit radio programme for delegates at the 1976 British Industrial Film Festival in [[Brighton]] and repeated the exercise the following year's 18th International Industrial Film Festival&lt;ref&gt;[http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/event/2867 BFI | Film &amp; TV Database | International Industrial Film Festival&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[National Film Theatre]] in London.

In 1976 Screen Digest formed an alliance with Nord Media, a London-based research business owned by Ebav, an audio-visual company jointly owned by the Scandinavian enterprises [[Esselte]] and [[Bonnier Group|Bonnier]]. The partnership ended in May 1980.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Chittock sold the company in July 1996 to a management team comprising David Fisher, Allan Hardy, Ben Keen and Mark Smith. At that time the company had one full-time employee. Since then Screen Digest has expanded its consultancy and report publishing activities, as well as developing a set of continuously updated online information and data services on Advertising, Broadband Media, Cinema, Games, Mobile Media, Television, Television technology and Video. Screen Digest now counts over 50 full-time employees, with bases in New York and California in the US and Melbourne, Australia, as well as London.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

In 2007, Screen Digest acquired the US video market research company Adams Media Research (AMR),&lt;ref&gt;[http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=9709978 Adams Media Research, Inc.: Private Company Information – BusinessWeek&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adamsmediaresearch.com/site/contact/pressreleases.asp Adams Media Research :: Press Releases&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and established Screen Digest Inc. The Global Media Intelligence (GMI) division was formed in 2007 to supply reports on media companies for corporate investors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ml.com/index.asp?id=7695_7696_8149_74412_82725_84553 Merrill Lynch Agrees to Exclusive Distribution Agreement With Global Media Intelligence, a Producer of Independent Research in the Media Sector&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media conferences==
In its association with Nord Media, Screen Digest staged two  video conferences: Video Disc 77&lt;ref&gt;David Fisher (compiler): ''Video Disc 77''. London: Nord Media, November 1977, 40pp.&lt;/ref&gt; and Video Disc and Videogram 79.&lt;ref&gt;David Fisher (compiler): Video Disc and Videogram 79. London: Nord Media, February 1979, 40pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1981 Screen Digest was involved in conference organisation for the International Video Week,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/event/289 BFI | Film &amp; TV Database |&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; co-ordinated by [[The Economist]] and held on the [[South Bank]], London. The event was staged again the following year. Several industry lunches were also held in London around this time at which guest speakers included [[Buckminster Fuller]] and Rosita Sarnoff, granddaughter of [[David Sarnoff]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

In 1996 Screen Digest became responsible for arranging the conference programme for the annual European Video Perspective (PEVE) home entertainment conferences and in 2007 acquired the sole ownership of the event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.screendigest.com/events/peve/index_html/view.html Screen Digest PEVE Digital Entertainment conference&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Edwards Deming''' (October 14, 1900 – December 20, 1993) was an American engineer, statistician, professor, author, lecturer, and management consultant. Educated initially as an [[electrical engineer]] and later specializing in  [[mathematical physics]], he helped develop the [[sampling technique]]s still used by the U.S. Department of the Census and the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
In his book, ''The New Economics for Industry, Government, and Education'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Deming|first=W. Edwards|title=The New Economics for Industry, Government, and Education|date=1993|publisher=MIT Press|location=Boston, Ma|isbn=0262541165|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deming championed the work of [[Walter Shewhart]], including [[statistical process control]], operational definitions, and what Deming called the "Shewhart Cycle"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Deming|first=W. Edwards|title=Out of the crisis|date=2000|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=0262541157|page=88|edition=1. MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had evolved into [[PDCA#About|Plan-Do-Study-Act]] (PDSA). This was in response to the growing popularity of [[PDCA]], which Deming viewed as tampering with the meaning of Shewhart's original work.&lt;ref name="MoenNorman2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moen |first1=Ronald D. |last2=Norman |first2=Clifford L. |title=Circling back: Clearing up myths about the Deming cycle and seeing how it keeps evolving |journal=Quality Progress |year=2010 |volume=43 |issue=11 |pages=21–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deming is best known for his work in Japan after WWII, particularly his work with the leaders of Japanese industry. That work began in August 1950 at the Hakone Convention Center in Tokyo, when Deming delivered a speech on what he called "Statistical Product Quality Administration". Many in Japan credit Deming as one of the inspirations for what has become known as the [[Japanese post-war economic miracle]] of 1950 to 1960, when Japan rose from the ashes of war on the road to becoming the second-largest economy in the world through processes partially influenced by the ideas Deming taught:&lt;ref name="lecture"&gt;[http://hclectures.blogspot.com/1970/08/demings-1950-lecture-to-japanese.html Deming's 1950 Lecture to Japanese Management].

Deming is best known in the [[United States]] for his 14 Points (''Out of the Crisis'', by W. Edwards Deming, preface) and his system of thought he called the "System of Profound Knowledge". The system includes four components or "lenses" through which to view the world simultaneously:
# Appreciating a system
# Understanding variation
# [[Psychology]]
# [[Epistemology]], the theory of knowledge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Deming|first=W. Edwards|title=The New Economics for Industry, Government, and Education|date=1993|publisher=MIT Press|location=Boston|isbn=0262541165|chapter=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deming made a significant contribution to Japan's reputation for innovative, high-quality products, and for its economic power. He is regarded as having had more impact on Japanese manufacturing and business than any other individual not of Japanese heritage. Despite being honored in Japan in 1951 with the establishment of the Deming Prize, he was only just beginning to win widespread recognition in the U.S. at the time of his death in 1993.&lt;ref name="America"&gt;{{cite video  |date=1991 |title=Deming of America  |url=http://priscillapetty.com/page7/page7.html |medium=Documentary |publisher=The Petty Consulting/Productions  |location=Cincinnati, OH}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ronald Reagan|President Ronald Reagan]] awarded him the [[National Medal of Technology]] in 1987. The following year, the [[National Academy of Sciences]] gave Deming the Distinguished Career in Science award.

== Overview ==

Deming received a BS in [[electrical engineering]] from the [[University of Wyoming]] at [[Laramie, Wyoming|Laramie]] (1921), an MS from the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]] (1925), and a PhD from [[Yale University]] (1928). Both graduate degrees were in mathematics and physics. He had an internship at [[Western Electric]]'s [[Hawthorne Works]] in [[Cicero, Illinois]], while studying at Yale. He later worked at the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Census Department. While working under Gen. Douglas MacArthur as a census consultant to the Japanese government, he was asked to teach a short seminar on [[statistical process control]] (SPC) methods to members of the Radio Corps, at the invitation of [[Homer Sarasohn]]. During this visit, he was contacted by the [[Japanese Union of Scientists and Engineers]] (JUSE) to talk directly to Japanese business leaders, not about SPC, but about his theories of management, returning to Japan for many years to consult. Later, he became a professor at [[New York University]], while engaged as an independent consultant in Washington, DC.

Deming was the author of ''Quality Productivity and Competitive Position'', ''Out of the Crisis'' (1982–1986), and ''The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education'' (1993), and books on statistics and sampling. Deming played the flute and drums and composed music throughout his life, including sacred choral compositions and an arrangement of ''The Star Spangled Banner''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://deming.org/?content=64 The Man: His Music]. W. Edwards Deming Institute. Accessed: 2006-06-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, he founded the W. Edwards Deming Institute in Washington, DC, where the Deming Collection at the U.S. [[Library of Congress]] includes an extensive audiotape and videotape archive. The aim of the institute is to "Enrich society through the Deming philosophy."  &lt;ref&gt;[https://deming.org/about-us/aim-vision]. W. Edwards Deming Institute. Accessed: 2008-10-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Deming's teachings and philosophy are clearly illustrated by examining the results they produced after they were adopted by Japanese industry, as the following example shows. [[Ford Motor Company]] was simultaneously manufacturing a car model with transmissions made in Japan and the United States. Soon after the car model was on the market{{when|date=November 2016}}, Ford customers were requesting the model with Japanese transmissions over the US-made transmissions, and they were willing to wait for the Japanese model. As both transmissions were made to the same specifications, Ford engineers could not understand the customer preference for the model with Japanese transmissions. Finally, Ford engineers decided to take apart the two different transmissions. The American-made car parts were all within specified tolerance levels. However, the Japanese car parts were virtually identical to each other, and much closer to the nominal values for the parts—e.g., if a part was supposed to be one foot long, plus or minus 1/8 of an inch—then the Japanese parts were all within 1/16 of an inch, less variation. This made the Japanese cars run more smoothly and customers experienced fewer problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dr. Deming: The American Who Taught the Japanese About Quality |last=Aguayo |first=Rafael |year=1991 |publisher=Fireside |pages=40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family ==
Born in [[Sioux City, Iowa]], William Edwards Deming was raised in [[Polk City, Iowa]], on his grandfather Henry Coffin Edwards's chicken farm, then later on a {{convert|40|acre|ha|adj=on}} farm purchased by his father in [[Powell, Wyoming]]. He was the son of William Albert Deming and Pluma Irene Edwards,&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;[http://deming.org/?content=61 The Man: Biography] W. Edwards Deming Institute. Accessed: 2006-06-17.&lt;/ref&gt;
His parents were well educated and emphasized the importance of education to their children. Pluma had studied in San Francisco and was a musician. William Albert had studied mathematics and law.

He was a direct descendant of [[John Deming]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Deming |first=Judson Keith |authorlink= |editor= |others= |title=John Deming and His Descendents |url= |edition= |series= |year=1904 |publisher=Press of Mathis-Mets Co. |location=Dubuque, Iowa |isbn= |oclc=2285125 |doi=  |page=4 |chapter= |chapterurl= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (1615–1705) an early [[Puritan]] settler and original patentee of the [[Connecticut Colony]], and Honor Treat, the daughter of [[Richard Treat]] (1584–1669), an early [[New England]] settler, deputy to the Connecticut Legislature and also a patentee of the Royal Charter of Connecticut, 1662.

Deming married Agnes Bell in 1922. She died in 1930, a little more than a year after they had adopted a daughter, Dorothy (-1984). Deming made use of various private homes to help raise the infant, and following his marriage in 1932 to Lola Elizabeth Shupe (- 1986), with whom he coauthored several papers, he brought her back home to stay. Lola and he had two more children, Diana (b. 1934) and Linda (b. 1943). Deming was survived by Diana and Linda, along with seven grandchildren.&lt;ref&gt;https://deming.org/deming/timeline&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and work ==
Deming was a professor of statistics at New York University's graduate school of business administration (1946–1993), and taught at [[Columbia University]]'s graduate school of business (1988–1993). He also was a consultant for private business.

In 1927, Deming was introduced to [[Walter A. Shewhart]] of the Bell Telephone Laboratories by C.H. Kunsman of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Deming found great inspiration in the work of Shewhart, the originator of the concepts of statistical control of processes and the related technical tool of the [[control chart]], as Deming began to move toward the application of statistical methods to industrial production and management. Shewhart's idea of common and special causes of variation led directly to Deming's theory of management. Deming saw that these ideas could be applied not only to manufacturing processes, but also to the processes by which enterprises are led and managed. This key insight made possible his enormous influence on the economics of the industrialized world after 1950.&lt;ref name="brief"&gt;''A Brief History of Dr. W. Edwards Deming'' British Deming Association SPC Press, Inc. 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, he studied under Sir [[Ronald Fisher]] and [[Jerzy Neyman]] at [[University College, London]], England.

Deming edited a series of lectures delivered by Shewhart at USDA, ''Statistical Method from the Viewpoint of Quality Control'', into a book published in 1939. One reason he learned so much from Shewhart, Deming remarked in a videotaped interview, was that, while brilliant, Shewhart had an "uncanny ability to make things difficult." Deming thus spent a great deal of time both copying Shewhart's ideas and devising ways to present them with his own twist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://deming.org/?content=652 The Man: Articles: "The Three Careers of W. Edwards Deming."] W. Edwards Deming Institute. Accessed: 2008-10-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Deming developed the sampling techniques that were used for the first time during the 1940 U.S. Census, formulating the Deming-Stephan algorithm for iterative proportional fitting in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deming | first1 = WE | last2 = Stephan | first2 = F | year = 1940 | title = On a least squares adjustment of a sampled frequency table when the expected marginal totals are known | url = | journal = Annals of Mathematical Statistics | volume = 11 | issue = 4| pages = 427–444 | doi = 10.1214/aoms/1177731829 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During World War II, Deming was a member of the five-man Emergency Technical Committee. He worked with H.F. Dodge, A.G. Ashcroft, Leslie E. Simon, R.E. Wareham, and John Gaillard in the compilation of the American War Standards ([[American Standards Association]] Z1.1–3 published in 1942)&lt;ref&gt;Editor's Preface ''Elementary Principles of Statistical Control Quality'' The Union of Japanese Scientists and Engineers (transcript of Deming's 1950 lectures in Japan)&lt;/ref&gt; and taught SPC techniques to workers engaged in wartime production. Statistical methods were widely applied during World War II, but faded into disuse a few years later in the face of huge overseas demand for American mass-produced products.{{citation needed |date=April 2013}}

=== Work in Japan ===
In 1947, Deming was involved in early planning for the 1951 Japanese Census. The [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]] were [[Occupied Japan|occupying Japan]], and he was asked by the [[United States Department of the Army]] to assist with the census. He was brought over at the behest of General Douglas MacArthur, who grew frustrated at being unable to complete so much as a phone call without the line going dead due to Japan's shattered postwar economy. While in Japan, his expertise in quality-control techniques, combined with his involvement in Japanese society, brought him an invitation from the Japanese Union of Scientists and Engineers (JUSE).&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

JUSE members had studied Shewhart's techniques, and as part of Japan's reconstruction efforts, they sought an expert to teach statistical control. From June–August 1950, Deming trained hundreds of engineers, managers, and scholars in SPC and concepts of quality. He also conducted at least one session for top management (including top Japanese industrialists of the likes of [[Akio Morita]], the cofounder of [[Sony Corp]].)&lt;ref name="legacy"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Noguchi |first=Junji  |title=The Legacy of W. Edwards Deming |journal=Quality Progress |date=October 1995 |volume=28 |issue=12 |pages=35–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deming's message to Japan's chief executives was that improving [[Quality (business)|quality]] would reduce expenses, while increasing [[Productivity (economics)|productivity]] and market share.&lt;ref name="lecture" /&gt; Perhaps the best known of these management lectures was delivered at the Mt. Hakone Conference Center in August 1950.

A number of Japanese manufacturers applied his techniques widely and experienced heretofore unheard-of levels of quality and productivity. The improved quality combined with the lowered cost created new international demand for Japanese products.

Deming declined to receive royalties from the transcripts of his 1950 lectures, so JUSE's board of directors established the [[Deming Prize]] (December 1950) to repay him for his friendship and kindness.&lt;ref name="legacy" /&gt; Within Japan, the Deming Prize continues to exert considerable influence on the disciplines of quality control and quality management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://deming.org/index.cfm?content=511 | title=What is the Deming Prize? | publisher=The W. Edwards Deming Institute. | accessdate=2010-05-20 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100629043330/http://deming.org/index.cfm?content=511 | archive-date=June 29, 2010 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Honors ===
In 1960, the Prime Minister of Japan ([[Nobusuke Kishi]]), acting on behalf of Emperor [[Hirohito]], awarded Deming Japan's [[Order of the Sacred Treasure|Order of the Sacred Treasure, Second Class]]. The citation on the medal recognizes Deming's contributions to Japan's industrial rebirth and its worldwide success. The first section of the meritorious service record describes his work in Japan:&lt;ref name="legacy" /&gt;
:*1947, Rice Statistics Mission member
:*1950, assistant to the [[Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers]]
:*instructor in sample survey methods in government statistics
The second half of the record lists his service to private enterprise through the introduction of epochal ideas, such as quality control and market survey techniques.

Among his many honors, an exhibit memorializing Deming's contributions and his famous Red Bead Experiment is on display outside the board room of the [[American Society for Quality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=Spring 2005|title=Red beads on display at ASQ headquarters |journal=Deming Interaction | volume = 9 | issue = 1|page = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was inducted into the [[Automotive Hall of Fame]] in 1991.

== Later work in the U.S. ==
[[David Salsburg]] wrote:

:"He was known for his kindness to and consideration for those he worked with, for his robust, if very subtle, humor, and for his interest in music. He sang in a choir, played drums and flute, and published several original pieces of sacred music."&lt;ref&gt;Salsburg (2002) page 254&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deming and his statistical methods are profiled  by Salsburg(2002, Chapter 24)&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, from his home in Washington, DC, Deming continued running his own consultancy business in the United States, largely unknown and unrecognized in his country of origin and work. In 1980, he was featured prominently in an [[NBC]] TV documentary titled ''[[If Japan can... Why can't we?]]'' about the increasing industrial competition the United States was facing from Japan. As a result of the broadcast, demand for his services increased dramatically, and Deming continued consulting for industry throughout the world until his death at the age of 93.

Ford Motor Company was one of the first American corporations to seek help from Deming. In 1981, Ford's sales were falling. Between 1979 and 1982, Ford had incurred $3 billion in losses. Ford's newly appointed Corporate Quality Director, Larry Moore, was charged with recruiting Deming to help jump-start a quality movement at Ford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Deming Management Method |last=Walton |first=Mary |publisher=Penguin Group |year=1986 |pages=138–139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deming questioned the company's culture and the way its managers operated. To Ford's surprise, Deming talked not about quality, but about management. He told Ford that management actions were responsible for 85% of all problems in developing better cars. In 1986, Ford came out with a profitable line of cars, the Taurus-Sable line. In a letter to ''Autoweek'', [[Donald Petersen]], then Ford chairman, said, "We are moving toward building a quality culture at Ford and the many changes that have been taking place here have their roots directly in Deming's teachings."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sme.org/cgi-bin/get-press.pl?&amp;&amp;20012513&amp;ND&amp;&amp;SME&amp; Ford Embraces Six-Sigma Quality Goals.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312105954/http://www.sme.org/cgi-bin/get-press.pl?&amp;&amp;20012513&amp;ND&amp;&amp;SME&amp; |date=March 12, 2007 }} Accessed: 2006-07-31.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1986, Ford had become the most profitable American auto company. For the first time since the 1920s, its earnings had exceeded those of archrival [[General Motors]] (GM). Ford had come to lead the American automobile industry in improvements. Ford's following years' earnings confirmed that its success was not a fluke, for its earnings continued to exceed GM and Chrysler's.

In 1982, Deming's book ''Quality, Productivity, and Competitive Position'' was published by the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] Center for Advanced Engineering, and was renamed ''Out of the Crisis'' in 1986. In it, he offers a theory of management based on his famous 14 Points for Management. Management's failure to plan for the future brings about loss of market, which brings about loss of jobs. Management must be judged not only by the quarterly dividend, but also by innovative plans to stay in business, protect investment, ensure future dividends, and provide more jobs through improved products and services. "Long-term commitment to new learning and new philosophy is required of any management that seeks transformation. The timid and the fainthearted, and the people that expect quick results, are doomed to disappointment."

In 1982, Deming, along with Paul Hertz and Howard Gitlow of the [[University of Miami]] Graduate School of Business in Coral Gables, founded the W. Edwards Deming Institute for the Improvement of Productivity and Quality. In 1983, the institute trained consultants of Ernst and Whinney Management Consultants in the Deming teachings. E&amp;W then founded its Deming Quality Consulting Practice which is still active today.

His methods and workshops regarding [[Total quality management|Total Quality Management]] have had broad influence. For example, they were used to define how the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Underground Storage Tanks program would work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epaalumni.org/userdata/pdf/602BCE06FAFAB29B.pdf#page=6|title=Transcript of ‘The Underground Storage Tank Program’s Early Management Challenges’ video|last=Brand|first=Ron|date=April 24, 2013|website=EPA Alumni Association|access-date=August 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of his career, Deming received dozens of academic awards, including another, honorary, PhD from [[Oregon State University]]. In 1987, he was awarded the [[National Medal of Technology]]: "For his forceful promotion of statistical methodology, for his contributions to sampling theory, and for his advocacy to corporations and nations of a general management philosophy that has resulted in improved product quality."  In 1988, he received the Distinguished Career in Science award from the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

Deming and his staff continued to advise businesses large and small. From 1985 through 1989, Deming served as a consultant to Vernay Laboratories, a rubber manufacturing firm in Yellow Springs, Ohio, with fewer than 1,000 employees. He held several week-long seminars for employees and suppliers of the small company where his infamous example "Workers on the Red Beads" spurred several major changes in Vernay's manufacturing processes.

Deming joined the Graduate School of Business at Columbia University in 1988. In 1990, during his last year, he founded the W. Edwards Deming Center for Quality, Productivity, and Competitiveness at [[Columbia Business School]] to promote operational excellence in business through the development of research, best practices and strategic planning.

In 1990, [[Marshall Industries]] (NYSE:MI, 1984–1999) CEO [[Robert Rodin]] trained with the then 90-year-old Deming and his colleague Nida Backaitis. Marshall Industries' dramatic transformation and growth from $400 million to $1.8 billion in sales was chronicled in Deming's last book ''The New Economics'', a Harvard Case Study, and Rodin's book, ''Free, Perfect and Now''.

In 1993, Deming published his final book, ''The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education'', which included the System of Profound Knowledge and the 14 Points for Management.  It also contained educational concepts involving group-based teaching without grades, as well as management without individual merit or performance reviews.

Deming died in his sleep at the age of 93 in his Washington home from cancer on December 20, 1993.&lt;ref name="NYT931221"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/21/obituaries/w-edwards-deming-expert-on-business-management-dies-at-93.html |title= W.

== Deming philosophy synopsis ==
The philosophy of W. Edwards Deming has been summarized as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Dr. W. Edwards Deming taught that by adopting appropriate principles of management, organizations can increase quality and simultaneously reduce costs (by reducing waste, rework, staff attrition and litigation while increasing customer loyalty). The key is to practice continual improvement and think of manufacturing as a system, not as bits and pieces."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dharma-haven.org/five-havens/deming.htm Dr. Deming's Management Training.] Accessed: 2006-06-18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the 1970s, Deming's philosophy was summarized by some of his Japanese proponents {{Citation needed|reason=Who exactly?|date=March 2017}} with the following "a"-versus-"b" comparison:

:(a) When people and organizations focus primarily on quality, defined by the following ratio,

::&lt;math&gt;\text{Quality} = \frac{\text{Results of work efforts}}{\text{Total costs}}&lt;/math&gt;

:quality tends to increase and costs fall over time.

:(b) However, when people and organizations focus primarily on ''costs'', costs tend to rise and quality declines over time.

=== The Deming System of Profound Knowledge ===
{{Over-quotation|section|date=December 2012}}
"The prevailing style of management must undergo transformation. A system cannot understand itself. The transformation requires a view from outside. The aim of this chapter is to provide an outside view—a lens—that I call a system of profound knowledge. It provides a map of theory by which to understand the organizations that we work in.

"The first step is transformation of the individual. This transformation is discontinuous. It comes from understanding of the system of profound knowledge. The individual, transformed, will perceive new meaning to his life, to events, to numbers, to interactions between people."

"Once the individual understands the system of profound knowledge, he will apply its principles in every kind of relationship with other people. He will have a basis for judgment of his own decisions and for transformation of the organizations that he belongs to. "

Deming advocated that all managers need to have what he called a System of Profound Knowledge, consisting of four parts:
# ''Appreciation of a system'': understanding the overall processes involving suppliers, producers, and customers (or recipients) of goods and services (explained below);
# ''Knowledge of variation'': the range and causes of variation in quality, and use of statistical sampling in measurements;
# ''Theory of knowledge'': the concepts explaining knowledge and the limits of what can be known.
# ''Knowledge of psychology'': concepts of human nature.
He explained, "One need not be eminent in any part nor in all four parts in order to understand it and to apply it. The 14 points for management in industry, education, and government follow naturally as application of this outside knowledge, for transformation from the present style of Western management to one of optimization."

"The various segments of the system of profound knowledge proposed here cannot be separated. They interact with each other. Thus, knowledge of psychology is incomplete without knowledge of variation.

"A manager of people needs to understand that all people are different. This is not ranking people. He needs to understand that the performance of anyone is governed largely by the system that he works in, the responsibility of management. A psychologist that possesses even a crude understanding of variation as will be learned in the experiment with the [[Red Beads]] (Ch. 7) could no longer participate in refinement of a plan for ranking people."&lt;ref name="new"&gt;Deming, W. Edwards. 1993. ''The New Economics for Industry, Government, Education'', second edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Appreciation of a system'' involves understanding how interactions (i.e., feedback) between the elements of a system can result in internal restrictions that force the system to behave as a single organism that automatically seeks a [[steady state]]. It is this steady state that determines the output of the system rather than the individual elements. Thus it is the structure of the organization rather than the employees, alone, which holds the key to improving the quality of output.

The ''Knowledge of variation'' involves understanding that everything measured consists of both "normal" variation due to the flexibility of the system and of "special causes" that create defects. Quality involves recognizing the difference to eliminate "special causes" while controlling normal variation. Deming taught that making changes in response to "normal" variation would only make the system perform worse. Understanding variation includes the mathematical certainty that variation will normally occur within six [[standard deviation]]s of the mean.

The System of Profound Knowledge is the basis for application of Deming's famous 14 Points for Management, described below.

=== Key principles ===
Deming offered 14 key principles to managers for transforming business effectiveness. The points were first presented in his book ''Out of the Crisis.'' (p.&amp;nbsp;23–24)&lt;ref name="crisis"&gt;{{cite book |last=Deming |first=W. Edwards |title=Out of the Crisis |year=1986 |publisher=MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Deming does not use the term in his book, it is credited with launching the [[Total Quality Management]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realisation.com.au/site2/Articles/Deming%2014%20points.htm|title=Deming's 14 Points|first=Phil|last=Cohen|publisher=Realisation|accessdate=June 25, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218101907/http://www.realisation.com.au/site2/Articles/Deming%2014%20points.htm|archive-date=February 18, 2011|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Create constancy of purpose toward improvement of product and service, with the aim to become competitive, to stay in business and to provide jobs.
# Adopt the new philosophy. We are in a new economic age. Western management must awaken to the challenge, must learn their responsibilities, and take on leadership for change.
# Cease dependence on inspection to achieve quality. Eliminate the need for massive inspection by building quality into the product in the first place.
# End the practice of awarding business on the basis of a price tag. Instead, minimize total cost. Move towards a single supplier for any one item, on a long-term relationship of loyalty and trust.
# [[Continual improvement process|Improve constantly and forever]] the system of production and service, to improve quality and productivity, and thus constantly decrease costs.
# Institute training on the job.
# Institute leadership (see Point 12 and Ch. 8 of ''Out of the Crisis''). The aim of supervision should be to help people and machines and gadgets do a better job. Supervision of management is in need of overhaul, as well as supervision of production workers.
# Drive out [[Culture of fear#In the workplace|fear]], so that everyone may work effectively for the company. (See Ch. 3 of ''Out of the Crisis'')
# Break down barriers between departments. People in research, design, sales, and production must work as a team,  to foresee problems of production and usage that may be encountered with the product or service.
# Eliminate slogans, exhortations, and targets for the work force asking for zero defects and new levels of productivity. Such exhortations only create adversarial relationships, as the bulk of the causes of low quality and low productivity belong to the system and thus lie beyond the power of the work force.
## Eliminate work standards ([[Vitality curve|quotas]]) on the factory floor. Substitute with leadership.
## Eliminate [[management by objective]].  Eliminate [[management by numbers]] and numerical goals.  Instead substitute with leadership.
# Remove barriers that rob the hourly worker of his right to [[pride of workmanship]]. The responsibility of supervisors must be changed from sheer numbers to quality.
# Remove barriers that rob people in management and in engineering of their right to pride of workmanship. This means, ''inter alia'', abolishment of the annual or merit [[Performance rating (work measurement)|rating]] and of [[management by objectives]] (See Ch. 3 of ''Out of the Crisis'').
# Institute a vigorous program of education and self-improvement.
# Put everybody in the company to work to accomplish the transformation. The transformation is everybody's job.

"Massive training is required to instill the courage to break with tradition. Every activity and every job is a part of the process."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Reilly |first=Norman B. |year=1994 |title=Quality: What Makes it Happen? |publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold |page=31 |isbn=0-442-01635-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====PDCA myth====
It is a common myth to credit Plan-Do-Check-Act ([[PDCA]]) to Deming. Deming referred to the PDCA cycle as a "corruption."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Personal letter to Ronald D. Moen|last=Deming|first=W. Edwards|publisher=|year=November 1990|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deming worked from the [[Walter A. Shewhart|Shewhart]] cycle and over time eventually developed the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle, which has the idea of deductive and inductive learning built into the learning and improvement cycle.  Deming finally published the PDSA cycle in 1993, in ''The New Economics'' on p.&amp;nbsp;132. Deming has added to the myth that he taught the Japanese the PDSA cycle with this quote on p.&amp;nbsp;247, "The PDSA Cycle originated in my teaching in Japan in 1950. It appeared in the booklet ''Elementary Principles of the Statistical Control of Quality'' (JUSE, 1950: out of print)."

=== Seven Deadly Diseases ===
The "Seven Deadly Diseases" include:
# Lack of constancy of purpose
# Emphasis on short-term profits
# Evaluation by performance, merit rating, or annual review of performance
# Mobility of management
# Running a company on visible figures alone
# Excessive medical costs
# Excessive costs of warranty, fueled by lawyers who work for contingency fees

"A Lesser Category of Obstacles" includes:
# Neglecting long-range planning
# Relying on technology to solve problems
# Seeking examples to follow rather than developing solutions
# Excuses, such as "our problems are different"
# The mistaken belief that management skills can be taught in classes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Deming Management Method |last=Walton |first=Mary |publisher=Penguin Group |year=1986 |page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Reliance on quality control departments rather than management, supervisors, managers of purchasing, and production workers
# Placing blame on workforces who are only responsible for 15% of mistakes where the system designed by management is responsible for 85% of the unintended consequences
# Relying on quality inspection rather than improving product quality

Deming's advocacy of the [[Plan–do–study–act|Plan-Do-Study-Act cycle]], his 14 Points and Seven Deadly Diseases have had tremendous influence outside manufacturing and have been applied in other arenas, such as in the relatively new field of [[sales process engineering]].&lt;ref name="Selden"&gt;{{cite book |title=Sales Process Engineering: A Personal Workshop |last=Selden |first=Paul H. |publisher=ASQ Quality Press|location=Milwaukee, WI|year=1997|pages=60–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:W J Young family photo.jpg|thumb|W.J. Young family]]

'''William John Young''' (February 27, 1827 at [[Belfast]], [[Ireland]] – June 8, 1896 at [[Clinton, Iowa|Clinton]], [[Iowa]]) was the founder of the W.J. Young Company.  He revolutionized the slow system of rafting logs by floatage with the current of the river in 1865 by a successful experiment of pushing log rafts ahead of a steam boat, independent of the river currents, and this with his introduction of the system of brail rafting, facilitated the movement of log stock while greatly lessening the expense of delivering them from the booms at Reef Slough and other points, to the mills at various points on the lower river; but for these advantages, the work of the mills would never have reached the vast volume to which they soon attained.  Mr. Young was one of the original members of the Mississippi River Logging Company, his interest in which he sold in 1893, after being for many years one of the most active and influential members of the company.

==Family==
He married Miss Esther Elderkin of [[Richmond, Indiana]] in 1858. They had six children.

==Early business years==
Few men have acquired equal prominence in the lumber circles of the northwest with that which was accorded to that pioneer lumberman of the Mississippi Valley, W.J. Young of [[Clinton, Iowa]].  Mr. Young came to America in 1846.  For several years he was employed in railroad offices and in ten years was given the position of general freight agent of the Cincinnati, Logansport &amp; Chicago railroad.  In 1858 he settled at [[Clinton, Iowa]], in the retail lumber business of what was then a rapidly developing village, and surrounding country.  About this time (see history of [[La Crosse, Wisconsin]]) a company of capitalists who had erected a saw mill at La Crosse, became dissatisfied with the management of their representative at that place, and induced Mr. Young to go there and investigate the conditions of the business.  Upon his representations they decided not only to change their representative but to remove the mill to Clinton, and induced Mr. Young to take charge of the operation.

==Building his lumber business==
The machinery proved the nucleus of the vast mills and business, which but a few years later, brought Mr. Young's name and extensive operations into a prominence.  In 1860 a new mill was erected, which commenced operations in August.  In the statistical reports for 1873 the record shows there were two mills, built in 1867, with an estimated capacity of {{convert|50000000|board feet|m3|sigfig=1}} yearly, operating two rotaries, eight gangs and five double edgers, employing 300 operators;. The cut of 1874 is stated at {{convert|29665000|board feet|m3}} of lumber and 17,295,000 shingles, that of 1875 being {{convert|35218000|board feet|m3}} of lumber and 14,470,000 shingles, showing a rapid evolution from the original mill of up to {{convert|8000|board feet|m3|sigfig=1}} per day while much larger, proved inadequate to the growing demands of his rapidly expanding operations.  In twenty years, Mr. Young had become proprietor of the largest saw mill in operation on the American continent.  In his earlier venture, the two Cincinnati men who had been connected with the La Crosse mill, and in whose interest it was removed to Clinton, were partners in the firm known as "W.J. Young &amp; Co.," but a few years later Mr. Young purchased their interests, and formed a connection with John McGraw of [[Ithaca, New York]], who was a member of the firm of Sage &amp; McGraw of [[Albany, New York]] and one of the largest lumbermen of the Allegheny region, and with large mills at Saginaw, and at [[Innisfil|Belle Ewart]], Canada, and in connection with him purchased much of the land of the [[Cornell University]] of Ithaca, which had been donated by the State of New York from a large grant of Wisconsin lands donated by the general government in aid of its school fund, and which comprised some of the best pine land of Wisconsin.  Under this arrangement the firm name of W.J. Young &amp; Co. was continued until the death of Mr. McGraw, as well as of his daughter Jennie McGraw Fisk, his beneficiary, who died a few years later, when Mr. Young purchased the interest of the estate, and continued the firm name, although being the only party in interest.

==Later lumber business development==
In 1880 the cut of Mr. Young's mills reached {{convert|50000000|board feet|m3|sigfig=1}} of lumber and 20,000,000 shingles, of which {{convert|18000000|board feet|m3|sigfig=1}} of lumber and 8,000,000 shingles was at the close of the season in pile on his yard, for the supply of his now greatly expanded trade, being seasoned before shipment over a vast territory extending in all directions.  The mills of 1892 reported a cut of {{convert|90234156|board feet|m3}} of lumber and 39,144,750 shingles, with a stock on hand at the close of the season of {{convert|47000000|board feet|m3|sigfig=2}} of lumber and 16,600,000 shingles, and at this time no mill in the world could vie with the "big mill" of Mr. Young.  Mr. Young was an invalid from 1893 to his death in 1896, the mills did not operate in 1895-6, and were subsequently run to be a modicum of their capacity, the cut of 1897 being recorded at but {{convert|10000000|board feet|m3|sigfig=1}} of lumber, 2,000,000 shingles and 1,500,000 lath, a conservative estimate placing the total production since 1858 at {{convert|1700000000|board feet|m3|sigfig=2}} of lumber and 750,000,000 shingles.

==Other activities==
Mr. Young was active in banking.  He erected and presented to the Methodist denomination at Clinton, the beautiful "Esther Young Chapel."  He purchased and presented to the Young Men's Christian Association of Clinton a beautiful building.  His interest in educational matters was manifested also in liberal gifts to [[Cornell College]] at [[Mount Vernon, Iowa]].

He cared little for political honors, but in 1864 yielded to the almost unanimous call of the citizens of Clinton that he should take the mayoralty and the affairs of the city thrived under his administration.  He was for some time president of the Clinton Savings Bank, was a director of the Clinton National bank (http://www.clintonnational.com/).

'''William Franklin "Lovebird" Allen''' (January 19, 1883 – June 14, 1946) was an American businessman and politician. He was a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] member of the [[Delaware General Assembly]] and the [[United States House of Representatives]].

==Early life and family==
Allen was born in [[Bridgeville, Delaware]], son of William Franklin (Frank) Allen and Mollie (Smith) Allen. He moved to Seaford, Sussex County, Delaware with his family in 1889, and then to [[Laurel, Delaware|Laurel]], Delaware in 1903. He married Addie M. Davis on April 16, 1905 and they had three children, Robert, Franklin, and Doris. They belonged to the Methodist Church.

After completing school in 1902, Allen worked for the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] as an agent, telegrapher, and train dispatcher. In 1922, he returned to Seaford, Delaware, began a real estate business, and also formed a business buying and selling fruit and produce along the Delmarva Peninsula. In 1927, Allen diversified his businesses, and founded the Allen Petroleum Corporation and the Allen Package Company.

==Political career==
Allen was a public school commissioner in [[Seaford, Delaware|Seaford]] from 1920 until 1924, and was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1920.

Allen was elected to the State Senate in 1924. He served in the Senate from 1925 to 1929, serving as President ''pro tempore'' in 1927&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=A000151|title=Allen, William Franklin, (1883 - 1946)|publisher= Biographical Directory of the United States Congress|accessdate= September 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A strong supporter of U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal, Allen was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1936, defeating incumbent Republican U.S. Representative J. George Stewart. Allen lost his bid for a second term in 1938 to Republican George S. Williams, a businessman from [[Millsboro, Delaware|Millsboro]], Delaware. During his term, Allen was a member of the Democratic majority in the 75th Congress and served from January 3, 1937 until January 3, 1939, during the second administration of U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt.

Subsequently, he resumed his work in the oil and gasoline distribution business. In 1940, he challenged both major parties and ran for the U.S. Senate as an Independent "Liberal Democrat," but received only a small number of votes.

==Death==
Allen died at Lewes and is interred at the Odd Fellows Cemetery in Seaford, Delaware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/12644907|title= William Franklin|publisher=Find A Grave|accessdate= September 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electoral history==
Elections are held the first Tuesday after November 1. Members of the Delaware General Assembly take office the second Tuesday of January. The State Senate has a four-year term. U.S. Representatives take office January 3 and have a two-year term.

'''Yaron Kanner''' is an Israeli social entrepreneur and lawyer, director of the [https://merkazhinam.wixsite.com/hinam-center-wix-en Hinam Center] for Social Tolerance.

== Biography ==
Yaron Kanner was born in Tel Aviv in 1968. He studied at the Netiv Meir High School in Jerusalem and later at Yeshivat Ateret Cohanim (today known as Yeshivat Ateret Yerushalayim). He served in the "Shimshon" undercover unit in the IDF during the First Intifada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.israelhayom.co.il/article/533129|title=ירון קנר: "אין תחליף להיכרות עם האחר" {{!}} ישראל היום|work=ישראל היום|access-date=2018-09-15|language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mnews.co.il/stories/5113|title="יגאל עמיר הביט בי בחשדנות ושאל: "מי אתה? מאיפה אתה בא?"|website=www.mnews.co.il|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, he served as a correspondent for Israel Radio's Channel 2 network and, among others, was the first reporter to broadcast live on Israel Radio that shots were fired at then-prime minister Yitzhak Rabin. Later he broadcast a documentary program on television, mainly during "The Diary" on the IBA’s First Channel. He was also a reporter for Yedioth Ahronoth, writing for the "7 Days" supplement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mnews.co.il/stories/5113|title="יגאל עמיר הביט בי בחשדנות ושאל: "מי אתה? מאיפה אתה בא?"|website=www.mnews.co.il|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After working as a journalist, he began to study social law. As a lawyer, he served as the director of the Legal Department of the Tebeka Association and led legal battles against the private and institutional discrimination of members of the Ethiopian community. Among others, he was one of the leaders of the legal struggle in the affair of the "Nezer Etzion" school in Petach Tikvah, whose students (except one) were members of the Ethiopian community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.walla.co.il/item/1856479|title=דעה: סגירת בית הספר נר עציון רצף של טעויות - וואלה! חדשות|work=וואלה! חדשות|access-date=2018-09-15|language=he-IL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1000723886#utm_source=social&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=facebook|title=עו"ד ירון קנר מונה למנכ"ל החדש של רדיו קול ברמה|last=ברק|first=רועי|website=גלובס|language=he|access-date=2018-09-15|date=2012-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== As a Journalist ==
The investigative reports that Kanner published in Yedioth Ahronoth were characterized by an active approach, in which the journalist is not satisfied with presenting the evidence alone to prove the subject of his investigation, but is actively involved in the investigation itself. This way Kanner tried to produce articles that benefitted from high credibility.

About two months before the assassination of then Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, Kanner entered the Eyal organization, where Yigal Amir was a member. During his recruitment to the organization, Avishai Raviv visited his home, and after that Kanner held meetings with Yigal Amir and Hagai Amir in Hebron and was due to join the organization as a weapons instructor. The purpose of the debriefing was to examine the intentions of the organization and its members, in light of their public threats against Yitzhak Rabin. The investigative report, which was planned to continue for several months, was interrupted by Rabin's assassination. Kanner immediately published a series of articles about his meetings with Yigal Amir and the other members of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://m.news1.co.il/ArticlePage.aspx%3fdocid%3d106912%26subjectid%3d3%26TransID%3d0%26AfterAdd%3d1|title=לא חשבתי אחרת|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kanner served, at the time, as a reporter for the Israel Radio network. On November 4, 1995, he was sent by the radio network to cover the "Yes to Peace, No to Violence" rally held at Malkhei Yisrael Square (today Rabin Square in Tel Aviv). As stated, Kanner was the first reporter to report that shots were fired at Yitzhak Rabin as he descended the back stairs of the stage toward his car.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=yaron kanner|title=רצח רבין - הדיווח הראשון|date=2008-08-13|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amybp7tRGnA&amp;feature=youtu.be|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.10.tv/documentary/132387|title=לא חשבתי שהוא יצחק - הסרט המלא|website=ערוץ עשר|language=he|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Kanner conducted an investigation into forced psychiatric hospitalization, in which he managed to bring about his own hospitalization at the [http://www.hamichlol.org.il/%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%9B%D7%96_%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%90%D7%99_%D7%9C%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%90%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%94%D7%A0%D7%A4%D7%A9_%D7%90%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%A0%D7%90%D7%9C Abarbanel Psychiatric Hospital] for four days, following fictitious letters of complaint he sent to the Tel Aviv District Psychiatrist. In this, Kanner proved that the district psychiatrist was not conducting the necessary tests before ordering forced hospitalization. Following a series of articles published on the subject, an investigation committee was set up by the Ministry of Health, and some of the legal requirements relating to forced hospitalization were changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://shemtov1.com/lor/tag/%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9F-%D7%A7%D7%A0%D7%A8-%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%95%D7%98-%D7%91%D7%9E%D7%97%D7%9C%D7%A7%D7%94-5-%D7%91%D7%99%D7%AA-%D7%97%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%90%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%A0%D7%9C/|title=ירון קנר סיוט במחלקה 5 בית חולים אברבנל – לורי שם טוב מידעו"ס ומשפטפטת|website=shemtov1.com|language=he-IL|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://isra-health.blogspot.com/2014/12/Yaron-Kaner.html|title=פסיכיאטריה: משוגע בעל כורחו - ירון קנר - ידיעות אחרונות - 16.8.1996|website=פסיכיאטריה|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://social2017blog.wordpress.com/2014/12/11/%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9F-%D7%A7%D7%A0%D7%A8-%D7%90%D7%A9%D7%A4%D7%96-%D7%90%D7%AA-%D7%A2%D7%A6%D7%9E%D7%95-%D7%91%D7%90%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%A0%D7%90%D7%9C-%D7%9B%D7%93%D7%99-%D7%9C%D7%91%D7%93/amp/|title=ירון קנר אשפז את עצמו ב'אברבנאל' כדי לבדוק מה קורה בחדרי החדרים של המוסד|date=2014-12-11|work=חדשות רווחה|access-date=2018-09-15|language=he-IL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://social2017blog.wordpress.com/2014/12/11/%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%95%D7%98-%D7%91%D7%9E%D7%97%D7%9C%D7%A7%D7%94-5-%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9F-%D7%A7%D7%A0%D7%A8-7-%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%99%D7%93%D7%99%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%90%D7%97%D7%A8/amp/|title=סיוט במחלקה 5 – ירון קנר – 7 ימים – ידיעות אחרונות – 23.08.1996|date=2014-12-11|work=חדשות רווחה|access-date=2018-09-15|language=he-IL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://alaxon.co.il/article/%D7%A6%D7%99%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%A8-%D7%94%D7%A0%D7%A4%D7%A9-%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%91-%D7%9B%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%90%D7%94/|title=ציפור הנפש שוב כלואה – אלכסון|website=alaxon.co.il|language=he-IL|access-date=2018-09-15|date=2017-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/mlbdebate1/home/4/yaron-kenrer|title=ירון קנר - MLB Debate|website=sites.google.com|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His journalistic approach aroused controversy over the extent of the journalist's proper involvement in the subject of his investigation, as well as ethical questions related to the legitimacy of impersonation and misrepresentation of the authorities in order to expose information of public importance.

== In the World of Tolerance ==
Kanner advocates promoting a tolerant society through a long and meaningful acquaintance with the other.  The Hinam Center that he founded applies this approach through in-depth journeys into the Israeli society where participants live "the lives of others" and spend extended periods of time  in various communities in Israeli society (ultra-Orthodox, Arabs, settlers, Ethiopians, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/an-alternative-schedule-for-vp-pence/|title=An alternative schedule for VP Pence|access-date=2018-09-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.jewishlinknj.com/community-news/bergen/25129-yi-of-teaneck-hosts-mk-glick-hinam-s-kanner|title=YI of Teaneck Hosts MK Glick, Hinam’s Kanner|last=Staff|first=JLNJ|access-date=2018-09-01|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://jewishfed.org/2014/03/03/gvanim-10-1|title=Jewish Pluralism, Bay Area Style: Israeli Gvanim Fellows Travel to the Bay for Cultural Exchange|work=Jewish Community Federation|access-date=2018-09-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.israelhayom.com/2018/09/07/a-lesson-in-co-existence/?platform=hootsuite|title=A lesson in co-existence - Israel Hayom|date=2018-09-07|work=Israel Hayom|access-date=2018-09-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.israelhayom.co.il/article/533129|title=ירון קנר: "אין תחליף להיכרות עם האחר" {{!}} ישראל היום|work=ישראל היום|access-date=2018-09-15|language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-5013783,00.html|title=הינם כאן|last=חבוט|first=אילנית סולומונוביץ'|date=2017-08-09|work=Ynet|access-date=2018-09-15|language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, President Reuven Rivlin met members of one of the Hinam Center’s groups after they completeda four-month journey between communities in Israel.

'''Zapaday''' is a global [[news]] [[calendar]]. The website publishes upcoming news headlines per day and per topic as a resource for journalists, bloggers, political analysts, marketers, event organisers, public relation professionals, scientists and travellers. Zapaday uses both [[Internet bot|bots]] and [[human]] [[editor]]s to monitor over 4,000 news sites and calendars for future news stories, publishing its findings as news events on categorized calendars.

Users can create and publish their own events and calendars, re-using events and calendars of others for personal use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ejc.net/resources/article/zapaday/|title=About Zapaday section on Zapaday site|publisher=European Journalism Centre|date=October 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 6, 2014, Zapaday launched a new subscription service with paid premium news calendars. The company also announced a new marketplace where journalists can syndicate curated news calendars as premium content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zapaday.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/20140306-Zapaday-Premium-and-Syndicated-Calendars-EN1.pdf |title=Zapaday launches Premium News Calendars, offers new Revenue Opportunity to Journalists |date=March 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new model invites journalists and content creators to publish premium calendars and receive 50 per cent of earnings, while Zapaday will receive 20 per cent for hosting and handling. The remaining 30 per cent go to the seller, who can be either the content creator themselves, Zapaday, or one of the news agencies or other resellers that offer a [[white-label]] version of Zapaday to their clients.

Calendar events from Zapaday can be exported to a user's [[Microsoft Outlook|Outlook]], [[Google Calendar]], or a mobile phone at any time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appvita.com/2012/03/23/zapaday-a-wiki-style-events-calendar//|title=Zapaday – A Wiki-Style Events Calendar|publisher=Appvita|date=March 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zapaday won an award as most promising start-up company across Europe at Tech Media Europe 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilumy.com/tech-media-europe-award-for-zapaday/|title=Tech Media Europe Award for Zapaday|publisher=Illumy|date=February 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was a 2012 [[Accenture]] Innovation Awards finalist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accenture.com/microsites/innovation-awards/2012/cmt/news/Pages/zapaday.aspx|title=Zapaday, concept of the week and finalist: the news of tomorrow|publisher=[[Accenture]]|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, Zapaday, together with UK's [[GRNlive]], the Foreign Correspondents Network, launched a new global reporting service where each future news event on Zapaday is accompanied with GRNlive journalists available in the region to cover the story on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zapaday.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/GRNlive-and-Zapaday-launch-news-reporting-network-of-the-future.pdf/|title=GRNlive and Zapaday launch news reporting network of the future|publisher=Zapaday|date=December 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 January 2013, Zapaday, together with Dutch press agency [[Algemeen Nederlands Persbureau]] (ANP), launched the renewed ‘ANP Agenda’ based on the Zapaday platform. The ANP Agenda includes planned domestic and sports news events, curated by ANP editors, and foreign and economic events curated by both ANP and Zapaday editors.
Nearly 1.000 users from ANP, including journalists, broadcasters and communication professionals, now use the platform to spot upcoming news events and plan ahead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wan-ifra.org/system/files/.../20140123_ANP-Zapaday_finfin.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
