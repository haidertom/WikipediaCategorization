'''Adductomics''' is the study of [[DNA adducts]] in the context of an entire [[genome]].  DNA adducts are [[Chemical compound|compounds]] that bind to [[DNA]], causing damage and [[mutations]].  These mutations can result in [[cancer]] and [[birth defects]] in [[multicellular organisms]].  The science of adductomics seeks to identify all DNA adducts and the target sequence of each adduct.

The term "adductome" first appeared in a journal article in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;MATSUDA TOMONARI, ROBERT A. KANALY, HANAOKA TOMOYUKI, SUGIMURA HARUHIKO, TODA HIROKAZU, MATSUI SABURO.  2005.  "DNA adductome strategy for detection of multiple DNA adducts." Nippon Kankyo Hen'igen Gakkai Taikai Puroguramu, Yoshishu.  34:77&lt;/ref&gt;  Although originally the term related to adducts of DNA, the adductomic approach has now been adopted by [[protein]] chemists in their attempts to identify [[protein adducts]].

{{Anatomical terminology series}}

Standard '''anatomical terms of location''' deal unambiguously with the [[anatomy]] of [[animal]]s, including humans.

All [[vertebrate]]s (including humans) have the same basic [[body plan]]{{snd}} they are strictly [[symmetry in biology|bilaterally symmetrical]] in early embryonic stages and largely bilaterally symmetrical in adulthood.{{sfn|Wake|1992|p=1}} That is, they have mirror-image left and right halves if divided down the middle.&lt;ref name="Hickman et al. 2003"&gt;Hickman, C. P., Jr., Roberts, L. S. and Larson, A. ''Animal Diversity''. McGraw-Hill 2003 {{ISBN|0-07-234903-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; For these reasons, the basic directional terms can be considered to be those used in vertebrates. By extension, the same terms are used for many other ([[invertebrate]]) organisms as well.

While these terms are standardized within specific fields of [[biology]], there are unavoidable, sometimes dramatic, differences between some disciplines. For example, differences in terminology remain a problem that, to some extent, still separates the [[#Humans|terminology of human anatomy]] from that used in the study of various other zoological categories.

==Introduction==
[[File:1303 Human Neuroaxis.jpg|thumbnail|300px|&lt;center&gt;Because of differences in the way humans and other animals are structured, different terms are used according to the [[neuraxis]] and whether an animal is a [[vertebrate]] or [[invertebrate]].&lt;/center&gt;]]

Standardized [[anatomy|anatomical]] and [[zoology|zoological]] terms of location have been developed, usually based on [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] words, to enable all biological and medical scientists to precisely delineate and communicate information about animal bodies and their component organs, even though the meaning of some of the terms often is context-sensitive.&lt;ref name="Craigie1838"&gt;{{cite book |author=David Craigie |title=Elements of Anatomy, General, Special, and Comparative |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lA82AQAAMAAJ |year=1838 |publisher=A. and C. Black}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[vertebrate]]s and ''[[Craniata]]'' share a substantial heritage and common structure, so many of the same terms are used for location. To avoid ambiguities this terminology is based on the anatomy of each animal in a standard way.

For humans, one type of vertebrate, anatomical terms may differ from other forms of vertebrates. For one reason, this is because humans have a different [[neuraxis]] and, unlike animals that rest on four limbs, humans are considered when describing anatomy as being in the [[standard anatomical position]]. Thus what is on "top" of a human is the [[head]], whereas the "top" of a dog may be its back, and the "top" of a [[flounder]] could refer to either its left or its right side.

For [[invertebrate]]s, standard application of locational terminology often becomes difficult or debatable at best when the differences in [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] are so radical that common concepts are not [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] and do not refer to common concepts. For example, many species are not even [[symmetry in biology|bilaterally symmetrical]]. In these species, terminology depends on their type of symmetry (if any).

===Standard anatomical position===
{{Main|Standard anatomical position}}
[[File:Radiate Oral-aboral Axes.JPG|thumbnail|A [[jellyfish]] of the ''[[Chrysaora]]'' species. Like other animals, its [[appendage]]s move, and in this image are not in a standard anatomical position. In anatomical position, the proximodistal axis (labelled) is straight, and the point labelled "distal end" neither to the left or the right of the jellyfish's main axis.]]
Because [[animal]]s can change orientation with respect to their environment, and because [[appendage]]s like [[limb (anatomy)|limbs]] and [[tentacle]]s can change position with respect to the main body, positional descriptive terms need to refer to the animal as in its [[standard anatomical position]]. All descriptions are with respect to the organism in its standard anatomical position, even when the organism in question has appendages in another position. This helps avoid confusion in terminology when referring to the same organism in different postures.

In humans, this refers to the body in a standing position with arms at the side and palms facing forward (thumbs out). While the universal vertebrate terminology used in veterinary medicine would work in human medicine, the human terms are thought to be [[Status quo bias|too well established to be worth changing]].

=== Combined terms ===
[[File:Many-banded krait (2).JPG|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Dorsolateral flattening in the anatomy of a [[Bungarus|krait]] gives its body a triangular cross-section.&lt;/center&gt;]]
Many anatomical terms can be combined, either to indicate a position in two axes simultaneously or to indicate the direction of a movement relative to the body. For example, "anterolateral" indicates a position that is both anterior and lateral to the body axis (such as the bulk of the [[pectoralis major]] muscle). In [[radiology]], an [[X-ray]] image may be said to be "anteroposterior", indicating that the beam of X-rays pass from their source to patient's [[anterior]] body wall through the body to exit through [[posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] body wall.&lt;ref name=dorland&gt;''Dorland's Medical Dictionary for Health Consumers''. 2007 by Saunders, an imprint of Elsevier, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no definite limit to the contexts in which terms may be modified to qualify each other in such combinations. Generally the modifier term is truncated and an "o" or an "i" is added in prefixing it to the qualified term. For example, a view of an animal from an aspect at once dorsal and lateral might be called a "dorsolateral" view; and the effect of dorsolateral flattening in an organism such as a [[Bungarus|krait]] gives its body a triangular cross section. Again, in describing the [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] of an organ or [[Habit (biology)|habitus]] of an animal such as many of the [[Platyhelminthes]], one might speak of it as "dorsiventrally" flattened as opposed to bilaterally flattened animals such as [[ocean sunfish]].

Where desirable three or more terms may be [[Agglutination|agglutinated]] or [[Concatenation|concatenated]], as in "anteriodorsolateral". Such terms sometimes used to be hyphenated, but the modern tendency is to omit the hyphen. There is however little basis for any strict rule to interfere with choice of convenience in such usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dorsolateral |title=dorsolateral |publisher=Merriam-Webster}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Planes===
{{Main|Anatomical plane}}
[[File:BodyPlanes.jpg|thumb|right|299px|Anatomical planes in a human]]

Three basic reference planes are used to describe location.

* The '''[[sagittal plane]]''' is a plane parallel to the [[sagittal suture]]. All other sagittal planes (referred to as ''parasagittal planes'') are parallel to it. It is also known as a "longitudinal plane".{{sfn|Wake|1992|p=6}} The plane is a Y-Z plane, perpendicular to the ground. 
* The '''median plane''' or '''midsagittal plane''' is in the midline of the body, and divides the body into left and right (sinister and dexter) portions.{{sfn|Wake|1992|p=6}} This passes through the [[head]], [[spinal cord]], [[navel]], and, in many animals, the [[tail]].{{sfn|Wake|1992|p=6}} The term "median plane" can also refer to the midsagittal plane of other structures, such as a digit.
* The '''[[frontal plane]]''' or '''coronal plane''' divides the body into dorsal and ventral (back and front, or posterior and anterior) portions. For post-[[embryo]]nic humans a [[coronal plane]] is vertical and a transverse plane is horizontal, but for embryos and quadrupeds a coronal plane is horizontal and a transverse plane is vertical. A ''longitudinal plane'' is any plane perpendicular to the transverse plane. The [[coronal plane]] and the [[sagittal plane]] are examples of ''longitudinal planes''.
* A '''[[transverse plane]]''', also known as a ''cross-section'', divides the body into cranial and caudal (head and tail) portions.

In human anatomy:
* A '''transverse''' (also known as '''horizontal''') plane is an X-Z plane, parallel to the ground, which (in humans) separates the [[#Directions: human anatomy|superior]] from the [[#Directions: human anatomy|inferior]] or, put another way, the head from the feet.
* A '''coronal''' (also known as '''frontal''') plane is a X-Y plane, [[perpendicular]] to the ground, which (in humans) separates the anterior from the posterior, the front from the back, the ventral from the dorsal.

To begin with, distinct, polar-opposite ends of the [[organism]] are chosen. By definition, each pair of opposite points defines an '''[[Rotation around a fixed axis|axis]]'''. In a bilaterally symmetrical organism, there are 6 polar opposite points, giving three axes that intersect at right angles{{snd}} the x, y, and z axes familiar from three-dimensional geometry.

The terms "intermediate", "ipsilateral", "contralateral", "superficial", and "deep", while indicating directions, are relative terms and thus do not properly define fixed anatomical axes. Also, while the "rostrocaudal" and anteroposterior directionality are equivalent in a significant portion of the human body, they are different directions in other parts of the body.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Main terms==

===Superior and inferior===
{{Anchor|superior|inferior}}
In anatomical terminology '''superior''' ({{ety|la||above}}) is used to refer to what is above something, and '''inferior''' ({{ety|la||below}}) to what is below it. For example, in the [[anatomical position]] the most superior part of the human body is the head, and the most inferior is the feet.&lt;ref name="Marieb1995"&gt;{{cite book |last=Marieb |first=E. N. |title=Human Anatomy and Physiology |publisher=[[Benjamin Cummings]] |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-8053-4281-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tortora2006"&gt;{{cite book |last=Tortora |first=G. J. |last2=Derrickson |first2=B. |title=Principles of Anatomy and Physiology'' |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-471-68934-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a second example, in humans the [[neck]] is superior to the [[chest]] but inferior to the [[head]].

===Anterior and posterior===
{{Redirect|Anterior}}&lt;!-- [[Posterior]] is a dab page, not redirect --&gt;
'''Anterior''' refers to what is in front ({{ety|la|ante}}, meaning "before") and  '''posterior''', what is to the back of the subject ({{ety|la|post}}, meaning "after").{{sfn|Wake|1992|p=5}} For example, in a dog the [[nose]] is anterior to the eyes and the [[tail]] is considered the most posterior part; in many [[fish]] the [[gill]] openings are posterior to the eyes, but anterior to the tail.

===Medial and lateral===
{{Anchor|medial|median|lateral}}
'''Lateral''' ({{ety|la|lateralis|to the side}}) refers to the sides of an animal, as in "left lateral" and "right lateral". The term '''medial''' ({{ety|la|medius|middle}}) is used to refer to structures close to the centre of an organism, called the "median plane".&lt;ref name="Hickman et al. 2003" /&gt; For example, in a human, imagine a line down the center of the body from the head though the navel and going between the legs— the medial side of the foot would be the big toe side; the medial side of the knee would be the side adjacent to the other knee. To describe the sides of the knees touching each other would be "right medial" and "left medial".

The terms "left" and "right" are sometimes used, or their Latin alternatives ({{lang-la|dexter}}; "right", {{lang-la|sinister}}; "left"). However, as left and right sides are [[mirror images]], using these words is somewhat confusing, as structures are duplicated on both sides. For example, it is very confusing to say the [[dorsal fin]] of a [[dolphin]] is "right of" the left [[pectoral fin]], but is "left of" the right [[eye]], but much easier and clearer to say "the dorsal fin is medial to the pectoral fins".

Derived terms include:

* '''Contralateral''' ({{ety|la|contra|against}}): on the side opposite to another structure. For example, the right arm and leg are represented by the left, i.e., [[Contralateral brain|contralateral side of the forebrain]]. 
* '''Ipsilateral''' ({{ety|la|ipse|same}}): on the same side as another structure. For example, the left arm is ipsilateral to the left leg.
* '''Bilateral''' ({{ety|la|bis|twice}}): on both sides of the body. For example, bilateral [[orchiectomy]] (removal of testes on both sides of the body's axis) is surgical [[castration]].
* '''Unilateral''' ({{ety|la|unus|one}}): on one side of the body. For example, unilateral [[paresis]] is [[hemiparesis]].

[[Varus deformity|Varus]] and [[valgus deformity|valgus]] correspond to medial and lateral, respectively, regarding the distal segment's vector relative to the proximal segment's vector.

===Proximal and distal===
{{Redirect2|Proximal|distal|the linguistic terms|Demonstrative#Distal and proximal demonstratives|the dental terms|Glossary of dentistry}}
{{Anchor|proximal|distal}}
[[File:Blausen 0019 AnatomicalDirectionalReferences.png|thumb|350px|Anatomical directional reference]]
The terms '''proximal''' ({{ety|la|proximus|nearest}}) and '''distal''' ({{ety|la|distare|to stand away from}}) are used to describe parts of a feature that are close to or distant from the main mass of the body, respectively.{{sfn|Wake|1992|p=5}} Thus the upper arm in humans is proximal and the hand is distal.

These terms are frequently used when describing [[appendage]]s such as [[fins]], [[tentacle]]s, [[Limb (anatomy)|limbs]] or any structure that extends that can potentially move separately from the main body. Although the direction indicated by "proximal" and "distal" is always respectively towards or away from the point of attachment, a given structure can be either proximal or distal in relation to another point of reference. Thus the elbow is distal to a wound on the upper arm, but proximal to a wound on the lower arm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What Do Distal and Proximal Mean? |website=The Survival Doctor |url=http://www.thesurvivaldoctor.com/2011/10/04/what-do-distal-and-proximal-mean/ |accessdate=2016-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This terminology is also employed in molecular biology and therefore by extension is also used in chemistry, specifically referring to the atomic loci of molecules from the overall moiety of a given compound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Singh|first1=S|title=Chemistry, design, and structure-activity relationship of cocaine antagonists.|journal=Chemical Reviews|date=8 March 2000|volume=100|issue=3|pages=925–1024|pmid=11749256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central and peripheral ===
'''Central''' and '''peripheral''' are terms that are closely related to concepts such as proximal and distal, but they are so widely applicable that in many respects their flexibility makes them hard to define. Loosely speaking, they distinguish near and far, inside and out, or even organs of vital importance such as heart and lungs, from peripheral organs such as fingers, that undoubtedly may be important, but which it may not be life-threatening to dispense with. Examples of the application of the terms are the distinction between [[Central nervous system|central-]] and [[peripheral nervous system]]s, and between peripheral blood vessels and the central circulatory organs, such as the heart and major vessels. The terms also can apply to large and complex molecules such as proteins, where central amino acid [[Residue (chemistry)#Biochemistry|residues]] are protected from antibodies or the like, but peripheral residues are important in docking and other interactions. Other examples include ''Central and peripheral circadian clocks'',&lt;ref&gt;Mohawk JA1, Green CB, Takahashi JS. Central and peripheral circadian clocks in mammals. Annu Rev Neurosci. 2012; 35:445–62. {{doi|10.1146/annurev-neuro-060909-153128}}. Epub 2012 Apr 5&lt;/ref&gt; and ''central versus peripheral vision''.&lt;ref&gt;Adam M. Larson; Lester C. Loschky. The contributions of central versus peripheral vision to scene gist recognition. Journal of Vision September 2009, Vol. 9, 6. {{doi|10.1167/9.10.6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Superficial and deep===
{{Anchor|superficial|deep}}
These two terms relate to the distance of a structure from the surface of an animal.

'''Deep''' ({{ety|ang}}) refers to something further away from the surface of the organism. For example, the [[external oblique muscle]] of the abdomen is deep to the skin. "Deep" is one of the few anatomical terms of location derived from [[Old English]] rather than Latin – the anglicised Latin term would have been "profound" ({{ety|la|profundus|due to depth}}).

'''Superficial''' ({{ety|la|superficies|surface}}) refers to something near the outer surface of the organism. For example, in [[skin]] the [[epidermis]] is superficial to the [[subcutis]].

===Dorsal and ventral===
These two terms, used in anatomy and [[embryology]], refer to back (''dorsal'') and front or belly (''ventral'') of an organism.

The '''dorsal''' ({{ety|la|dorsum|back}}) surface of an organism refers to the back, or upper side, of an organism. If talking about the skull, the dorsal side is the top.{{sfn|GO|2014|loc="dorsal/ventral axis specification" (GO:0009950)}}

The '''ventral''' ({{ety|la|venter|belly}}) surface refers to the front, or lower side, of an organism.{{sfn|GO|2014|loc="dorsal/ventral axis specification" (GO:0009950)}}

For example, in a fish the [[pectoral fins]] are dorsal to the [[anal fin]], but ventral to the [[dorsal fin]].

===Cranial and caudal===
{{Anchor|caudal|cranial|rostral}}
[[File:Rostralcaudal.svg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;In the human skull the terms ''rostral'' and ''caudal'' are adapted to the curved [[neuraxis]] of [[Hominidae]]]]

Specific terms exist to describe how close or far something is to the head or tail of an animal. To describe how close to the head of an animal something is, three distinct terms are used:

* '''Rostral''' ({{ety|la|rostrum|beak, nose}}), meaning situated toward the oral or nasal region, or in the case of the brain, toward the tip of the frontal lobe.
* '''Cranial''' ({{ety|el|κρανίον|skull}}) or '''cephalic''' ({{ety|el|κεφαλή|head}}).&lt;ref name="Hickman et al. 2003"/&gt; 
* '''Caudal''' ({{ety|la|cauda|tail}}) is used to describe how close something is to the end{{when defined as|date=October 2018}} of an organism,

For example, in the [[horse]], the eyes are caudal to the nose and rostral to the back of the head.

These terms are generally preferred in veterinary medicine and not used as often in human medicine.&lt;ref name="Hickman et al. 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller 2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ruppert et al. 2004" /&gt; In humans, "cranial" and "cephalic" are used to refer to the skull, with "cranial" being used more commonly. The term "rostral" is rarely used in human anatomy, apart from embryology, and refers more to the front of the face than the superior aspect of the organism. Similarly, the term "caudal" is only occasionally used in human anatomy.&lt;ref name="Tortora2006"/&gt;  This is because the brain is situated at the superior part of the head whereas the nose is situated in the anterior part. Thus the "rostrocaudal axis" refers to a C shape (see image).

==Other terms and special cases==

===Anatomical landmarks===
The location of anatomical structures can also be described with relation to different [[anatomical landmark]]s.

Structures may be described as being at the level of a specific [[spinal vertebrae|spinal vertebra]], depending on the section of the [[vertebral column]] the structure is at. The position is often abbreviated. For example, structures at the level of the fourth [[cervical vertebra]] may be abbreviated as "C4", at the level of the fourth [[thoracic vertebra]] "T4", and at the level of the third [[lumbar vertebra]] "L3". Because the [[sacrum]] and coccyx are fused,  they are not often used to provide location.

References may also take origin from  [[superficial anatomy]], made to landmarks that are on the skin or visible underneath. For example, structures may be described relative to the [[anterior superior iliac spine]], the [[medial malleolus]] or the [[Medial epicondyle of the humerus|medial epicondyle]].

[[List of anatomical lines|Anatomical lines]], theoretical lines drawn through structures, are also used to describe anatomical location. For example, the mid-clavicular line is used as part of the [[cardiac examination|cardiac exam]] in medicine to feel the [[apex beat]] of the [[heart]].

===Mouth and teeth===
{{Main|Dental terminology}}
Fields such as [[osteology]], [[palaeontology]] and dentistry apply special terms of location to describe the mouth and teeth. This is because although teeth may be aligned with their main axes within the jaw, some different relationships require special terminology as well; for example teeth also can be rotated, and in such contexts terms like "anterior" or "lateral" become ambiguous.&lt;ref name="Folkens2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pieter A. Folkens|title=Human Osteology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lrLL-X5bg_0C&amp;pg=PA558|year=2000|publisher=Gulf Professional Publishing|isbn=978-0-12-746612-5|pages=558–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SmithDodson2003&gt;{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=J.

Terms used to describe structures include "buccal" ({{ety|la|bucca|cheek}}) and "palatal" ({{ety|la}}) referring to structures close to the [[cheek]] and [[hard palate]] respectively.

===Hands and feet===
[[Image:Hand Directional Axes.JPG|thumb|right|Anatomical terms used to describe a human hand]]

Several anatomical terms are particular to the hands and feet.

For improved clarity, the directional term '''palmar''' ({{ety|la|palma|palm of the hand}}) is usually used to describe the front of the hand, and '''dorsal''' is the back of the hand. For example, the top of a [[dog]]'s [[paw]] is its dorsal surface; the underside, either the palmar (on the forelimb) or the plantar (on the hindlimb) surface. The [[palmar fascia]] is palmar to the [[tendon]]s of muscles which flex the fingers, and the [[dorsal venous arch]] is so named because it is on the dorsal side of the foot.

'''Volar''' can also be used to refer to the underside of the [[hand#Areas|palm]] or [[sole (foot)|sole]], which are themselves also sometimes used to describe location as ''[[wikt:palmar#Adjective|palmar]]'' and ''[[wikt:plantar#Adjective|plantar]]''. For example, volar pads are those on the underside of hands, fingers, feet, and toes.

These terms are used to avoid confusion when describing the median surface of the hand and what is the "anterior" or "posterior" surface{{snd}} "anterior" can be used to describe the [[Hand|palm]] of the hand, and "posterior" can be used to describe the back of the hand and arm. This confusion can arise because the forearm can [[pronate]] and [[supinate]].

Similarly, in the forearm, for clarity, the sides are named after the bones. Structures closer to the [[radius (bone)|radius]] are '''radial''', structures closer to the [[ulna]] are '''ulnar''', and structures relating to both bones are referred to as '''radioulnar'''. Similarly, in the lower leg, structures near the [[tibia]] (shinbone) are '''tibial''' and structures near the [[fibula]] are '''fibular''' (or '''peroneal''').

===Rotational direction===
Most terms of anatomical location are relative to linear motion ([[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)#Six degrees of freedom|translation]]) along the X- Y- and Z-axes, but there are other [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)#Six degrees of freedom|degrees of freedom]] as well, in particular, rotation around any of those three axes.

'''Anteversion''' and '''retroversion''' are complementary anatomical terms of location, describing the degree to which an anatomical structure is rotated forwards (towards the front of the body) or backwards (towards the back of the body) respectively, relative to some datum position. The terms also describe the positioning of surgical implants, such as in [[arthroplasty]].

* '''Anteversion''' refers to an anatomical structure being tilted further ''forward'' than normal, whether pathologically or incidentally. For example, there may be a need to measure the anteversion of the neck of a bone such as a femur.&lt;ref&gt;http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/02841858909177461?journalCode=ard Evaluation of Three Methods for Measurement of Femoral Neck Anteversion Femoral neck anteversion, definition, measuring methods and errors 1989, Vol. 30, No. 1, pp. 69–73 by Arne Høiseth1†, O. Reikerås1 and E. Fønstelien&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a woman's [[uterus]] typically is anteverted, tilted slightly ''forward''. A misaligned [[pelvis]] may be anteverted, that is to say tilted ''forward'' to some relevant degree.
* '''Retroversion''' is rotation around the same axis as that of anteversion, but in the opposite sense, that is to say, tilting ''back''. A structure so affected is described as being [[retroverted uterus|retroverted]]. As with anteversion, retroversion is a completely general term and can apply to a backward tilting of such hard structures as bones, soft organs such as uteri, or surgical implants.

===Other directional terms===
Several other terms are also used to describe location. These terms are not used to form the fixed axes. Terms include:
* '''Axial''' ({{ety|la|axis|axle}}): around the central axis of the organism or the extremity. Two related terms, "abaxial" and "adaxial", refer to locations away from and toward the central axis of an organism, respectively
* '''Parietal''' ({{ety|la|paries|wall}}): pertaining to the wall of a body cavity. For example, the [[parietal peritoneum]] is the lining on the inside of the abdominal cavity. Parietal can also refer specifically to the [[parietal bone]] of the skull or associated structures.
* '''Posteromedial''' ({{ety|la|posterus|coming after||medius|middle}}): situated towards the middle of the posterior surface.
* '''Posterosuperior''' ({{ety|la|posterus|coming after}} and superior): situated towards the upper part of the posterior surface.
* '''Terminal''' ({{ety|la|terminus|boundary or end}}) at the extremity of a (usually projecting) structure, as in "...an antenna with a terminal sensory hair".
* '''Visceral''' and ''viscus'' ({{ety|la|viscera|internal organs}}): associated with organs ''within'' the body's cavities. For example, the [[stomach]] is covered with a lining called the visceral [[peritoneum]] as opposed to the parietal pertoneum. Viscus can also be used to mean "organ". For example, the stomach is a viscus within the abdominal cavity.

===Prefixes, suffixes, and other modifiers===
Directional and locational prefixes can modify many anatomical and morphological terms, sometimes in formally standard usage, but often attached arbitrarily according to need or convenience.

Prefixes
* '''Sub-''' ({{ety|la|sub|preposition beneath, close to, nearly etc}}) appended as a prefix, with or without the hyphen, qualifies terms in various senses. Consider ''subcutaneous'' as meaning beneath the skin, ''subterminal'' meaning near to the end of a structure. Sub- also may mean "nearly" or ''"more-or-less"''; for instance ''subglobular'' means almost globular. In many usages sub- is similar in application to "hypo-"
* '''Hypo-''' ({{ety|grc|ὑπό|under}}) Like "sub" in various senses as in ''hypolingual nerve'' beneath the tongue, or ''hypodermal'' fat beneath the skin 
* '''Infra-''' ({{ety|la|infra|preposition beneath, below etc}}) Similar to "sub"; a direct opposite to ''super-'' and ''supra-'', as in ''[[Infratemporal space]]'' or ''[[wikt:infraorbital|infraorbital]]''. 
* '''Inter-''' ({{ety|la|inter|between}}): between two other structures. For example, the [[navel]] is ''intermediate'' to the left arm and the contralateral (right) leg. The ''[[intercostal muscle]]s run between the ribs.
* '''Super-'' or ''Supra-''' ({{ety|la|super, supra|above, on top of, beyond etc}}) appended as a prefix, with or without the hyphen, as in ''[[superciliary arches]]'' or ''[[wikt:supraorbital|supraorbital]]''

Suffixes
* '''-ad''' ({{ety|la|''ad''|towards or up to}})
Commonly when, for example, one anatomical feature is nearer to something than another, one may use an expression such as "nearer the distal end" or "distal to". However, an unambiguous and concise convention is to use the Latin suffix ''-ad'', meaning "towards", or sometimes "to". {{sfn|Wake|1992|p=5}} So for example, "''distad''" means "in the distal direction", and "distad of the femur" means "beyond the femur in the distal direction". The suffix may be used very widely, as in the following examples: anteriad (towards the anterior), apicad (towards the apex), basad (towards the basal end), caudad, centrad, cephalad (towards the cephalic end), craniad, dextrad, dextrocaudad, dextrocephalad, distad, dorsad, ectad (towards the ectal, or exterior, direction), entad (towards the interior), laterad, mediad, mesad, neurad, orad, posteriad, proximad, rostrad, sinistrad, sinistrocaudad, sinistrocephalad, ventrad''.''&lt;ref name= "GGHDHD"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gordh |first=Gordon |last2=Headrick |first2=David H |title=A Dictionary of Entomology |publisher=CABI |year=2011 |edition=2nd |isbn=978-1845935429}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specific animals and other organisms==
The large variety of [[body plan|body shapes]] present in invertebrates presents a difficult problem when attempting to apply standard directional terms. Depending on the organism, some terms are taken by analogy from vertebrate anatomy, and appropriate novel terms are applied as needed. Some such borrowed terms are widely applicable in most invertebrates; for example proximal, literally meaning "near" refers to the part of an appendage nearest to where it joins the body, and distal, literally meaning "standing away from" is used for the part furthest from the point of attachment. In all cases, the usage of terms is dependent on the [[body plan]] of the organism.

For example, especially in organisms without distinct heads for reasons of broader applicability, "anterior" is usually preferred.&lt;ref name="Hickman et al. 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller 2002"&gt;Miller, S. A. ''General Zoology Laboratory Manual'' McGraw-Hill, {{ISBN|0-07-252837-0}} and {{ISBN|0-07-243559-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ruppert et al. 2004"&gt;Ruppert, E. E., Fox, R. S. and Barnes, R. D. ''Invertebrate Zoology: A Functional Evolutionary Approach''. Thomson, Belmont, 2004. {{ISBN|0-03-025982-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humans===
As humans are approximately [[symmetry in biology|bilaterally symmetrical]] organisms,{{sfn|Wake|1992|p=1}} anatomical descriptions usually use the same terms as those for vertebrates and other members of the taxonomic group [[Bilateria]]. However, for historical and other reasons, standard human directional terminology has several differences from that used for other bilaterally symmetrical organisms.

The terms of zootomy and anatomy came into use at a time when all scientific communication took place in Latin. In their original Latin forms the respective meanings of "anterior" and "posterior" are ''in front of'' (or ''before'') and ''behind'' (or ''after''), those of "dorsal" and "ventral" are ''toward the spine'' and ''toward the belly'', and those of "superior" and "inferior" are ''above'' and ''below''.

Humans, however, have the rare property of having an upright torso. This makes their anterior/posterior and dorsal/ventral directions the same, and the inferior/superior directions necessary.&lt;ref name= "Latin Tucker"&gt;{{cite book | author= Tucker, T. G.| title = A Concise Etymological Dictionary of Latin | publisher = Max Niemeyer Verlag | location = Halle (Saale)| year = 1931 | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most animals, furthermore, are capable of moving relative to their environment. So while "up" might refer to the direction of a standing human's head, the same term ("up") might be used to refer to the direction of the belly of a [[supine position|supine]] human. It is also necessary to employ some specific anatomical knowledge in order to apply the terminology unambiguously: For example, while the ears would be ''superior'' to (above) the shoulders in a human, this fails when describing the [[armadillo]], where the shoulders are above the ears. Thus, in [[Veterinary medicine|veterinary]] terminology, the ears would be ''cranial'' to (i.e., "toward the head from") the shoulders in the armadillo, the [[dog]], the [[kangaroo]], or any other [[wikt:terrestrial|terrestrial]] vertebrate, including the human. Likewise, while the belly is considered ''anterior'' to (in front of) the back in humans, this terminology fails for the flounder, the armadillo, and the dog. In veterinary terms, the belly would be ''ventral'' ("toward the abdomen") in all vertebrates.

While it would be possible to introduce a system of axes that is completely consistent between humans and other vertebrates by having two separate pairs of axes, one used exclusively for the head (e.g., anterior/posterior and inferior/superior) and the other exclusively for the torso (e.g., dorsal/ventral and caudal/rostral, or "toward the tail"/"toward the beak"), doing so would require the renaming of many anatomical structures.

===Asymmetrical and spherical organisms===
[[Image:Asymmetrical and Spherical.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Asymmetrical and spherical [[body plan|body shapes]]. (a) An organism with an asymmetrical, amoeboid, body plan (''Amoeba proteus''{{snd}} an amoeba). (b) An organism with a spherical body plan (''Actinophrys sol''{{snd}} a [[heliozoan]]).]]
In organisms with a changeable shape, such as [[amoeboid]] organisms, most directional terms are meaningless, since the shape of the organism is not constant and no distinct axes are fixed. Similarly, in [[Spherical symmetry|spherically symmetrical]] organisms, there is nothing to distinguish one line through the centre of the organism from any other. An indefinite number of triads of mutually perpendicular axes could be defined, but any such choice of axes would be useless, as nothing would distinguish a chosen triad from any others. In such organisms, only terms such as ''superficial'' and ''deep'', or sometimes ''proximal'' and ''distal'', are usefully descriptive.
[[Image:Longitudinal Diatom (Labelled).JPG|thumb|right|Four individuals of ''Phaeodactylum tricornutum'', a [[diatom]] with a fixed elongated shape.]]

===Elongated organisms===
In organisms that maintain a constant shape and have one dimension longer than the other, at least two directional terms can be used. The ''long'' or ''longitudinal axis'' is defined by points at the opposite ends of the organism. Similarly, a perpendicular ''transverse axis'' can be defined by points on opposite sides of the organism. There is typically no basis for the definition of a third axis. Usually such organisms are [[planktonic]] (free-swimming) [[protists]], and are nearly always viewed on [[microscope slide]]s, where they appear essentially two-dimensional. In some cases a third axis can be defined, particularly where a non-terminal [[cytostome]] or other unique structure is present.&lt;ref name="Ruppert et al. 2004" /&gt;

&lt;!-- Apical (anatomy) and Basal (anatomy) redirect here --&gt;
[[Image:Labelled Ciliates.JPG|thumb|left|Organisms where the ends of the long axis are distinct. (''Paramecium caudatum'', above, and ''[[Stentor roeselii]]'', below.)]]

Some elongated [[protists]] have distinctive ends of the body. In such organisms, the end with a mouth (or equivalent structure, such as the [[cytostome]] in ''[[Paramecium]]'' or ''[[Stentor]]''), or the end that usually points in the direction of the organism's [[Animal locomotion|locomotion]] (such as the end with the [[flagellum]] in ''[[Euglena]]''), is normally designated as the '''anterior''' end. The opposite end then becomes the '''posterior end'''.&lt;ref name="Ruppert et al. 2004" /&gt; Properly, this terminology would apply only to an organism that is always [[planktonic]] (not normally attached to a surface), although the term can also be applied to one that is [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] (normally attached to a surface).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=On the Origin of Phyla |last=Valentine |first=James W. |year=2004 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=978-0-226-84548-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Venus Flower Basket (sponge-labelled).JPG|thumb|right|A cluster of [[Venus' Flower Basket|''Euplectella aspergillum'' sponges (Venus flower baskets)]], showing the apical-basal axes.]]

{{Anchor|apical}}
Organisms that are attached to a [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]], such as [[Porifera|sponges]], or some [[Protista|animal-like protists]] also have distinctive ends. The part of the organism attached to the substrate is usually referred to as the '''basal end''' ({{ety|la|basis|support/foundation}}), whereas the end furthest from the attachment is referred to as the '''apical end''' ({{ety|la|apex|peak/tip}}).

===Radially symmetrical organisms===
[[Radial symmetry|Radially symmetrical organisms]] include those in the group [[Radiata]]{{snd}} primarily [[Cnidaria|jellyfish, sea anemones and corals]] and the [[Ctenophora|comb jellies]].&lt;ref name="Hickman et al. 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ruppert et al. 2004" /&gt; Adult [[Echinodermata|echinoderms]], such as [[starfish]], [[sea urchin]]s, [[sea cucumber]]s and others are also included, since they are pentaradial, meaning they have five [[rotational symmetry#n-fold rotational symmetry|discrete rotational]] [[symmetry (biology)|symmetry]]. Echinoderm [[larva]]e are not included, since they are [[symmetry in biology|bilaterally symmetrical]].&lt;ref name="Hickman et al. 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ruppert et al. 2004" /&gt; Radially symmetrical organisms always have one distinctive axis.

[[Cnidaria]]ns (jellyfish, sea anemones and corals) have an incomplete digestive system, meaning that one end of the organism has a mouth, and the opposite end has no opening from the gut (coelenteron).&lt;ref name="Ruppert et al. 2004" /&gt; For this reason, the end of the organism with the mouth is referred to as the '''oral end''' ({{ety|la|ōrālis|of the mouth}}), and the opposite surface is the '''aboral end''' ({{ety|la|ab-|away from}}).

Unlike vertebrates, cnidarians have no other distinctive axes. "Lateral", "dorsal", and "ventral" have no meaning in such organisms, and all can be replaced by the generic term '''peripheral''' ({{ety|grc|περιφέρεια|circumference}}). '''Medial''' can be used, but in the case of radiates indicates the central point, rather than a central axis as in vertebrates. Thus, there are multiple possible '''radial axes''' and '''medio-peripheral''' (half-) '''axes'''. However, it is noteworthy that some biradially symmetrical [[Ctenophora|comb jellies]] do have distinct "tentacular" and "pharyngeal" axes&lt;ref&gt;Ruppert ''et al.'' (2004), p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; and are thus anatomically equivalent to [[bilateria|bilaterally symmetrical]] animals.

As with vertebrates, [[appendage]]s that move independently of the body ([[tentacles]] in [[cnidaria]]ns and [[Ctenophora|comb jellies]]), have a definite ''proximodistal axis'' (Fig. 9).

===Spiders===
{{See also|Glossary of spider terms|Spider anatomy}}
Two specialized terms are useful in describing views of [[arachnid]] legs and [[pedipalp]]s. '''Prolateral''' refers to the surface of a leg that is closest to the anterior end of an arachnid's body. '''Retrolateral''' refers to the surface of a leg that is closest to the posterior end of an arachnid's body.&lt;ref name="Kaston1972"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaston|first=B.J.|author-link=B. J. Kaston|title=How to Know the Spiders|edition=3rd|year=1972|page=19|publisher=W.C. Brown Co.|location=Dubuque, IA|isbn=978-0-697-04899-8 |oclc=668250654 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the unusual nature and positions of the eyes of the [[Spider|Araneae]] (spiders), and their importance in taxonomy, evolution and anatomy, special terminology with associated abbreviations has become established in arachnology. Araneae normally have eight eyes in four pairs. All the eyes are on the [[carapace]] of the [[prosoma]], and their sizes, shapes and locations are characteristic of various spider families and other [[taxon|taxa]]. In some taxa not all four pairs of eyes are present, the relevant species having only three, two, or one pair of eyes. Some species (mainly [[troglobite]]s) have no functional eyes at all.

In what is seen as the likeliest ancestral arrangement of the eyes of the Araneae, there are two roughly parallel, horizontal, symmetrical, transverse rows of eyes, each containing two symmetrically placed pairs, respectively called: anterior and posterior lateral eyes (ALE) and (PLE); and anterior and posterior median eyes (AME) and (PME).

As a rule it is not difficult to guess which eyes are which in a living or preserved specimen, but sometimes it can be. Apart from the fact that in some species one or more pairs may be missing, sometimes eyes from the posterior and anterior rows may be very close to each other, or even fused. Also, either one row or both might be so grossly curved that some of the notionally anterior eyes actually may lie posterior to some of the eyes in the posterior row. In some species the curve is so gross that the eyes apparently are arranged into two anteroposterior parallel rows of eyes.

'''Anthony Charles Thiselton''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FBA}} (born 1937) is an English [[Anglican]] priest, [[theologian]], and academic. He has written a number of books and articles on a range of topics in [[Christian]] [[theology]], [[biblical studies]], and the [[philosophy of religion]].  He has served on the [[Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority]], appointed by the [[Minister of Health]].

He was educated at [[City of London School]], with degrees from [[King's College London]] (BD, MTh) the [[University of Sheffield]] (PhD) and the [[University of Durham]] (DD). He received an honorary doctorate from the [[University of Chester]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chester University profile|url=http://www.chester.ac.uk/node/12797|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in March 2012.  Thiselton is an Honorary Fellow of [[Cranmer Hall, Durham]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cranmer Hall - Honorary Fellows|url=http://www.dur.ac.uk/st-johns.college/cranmer/cranmer_staff/honorary-fellows/|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; fellow of Kings College London and fellow of the British Academy.

Thiselton is a former head of theology at the [[University of Nottingham]] and was also [[Principal (academia)|principal]] of both [[St John's College, Nottingham]] (1986 to 1988) and [[St John's College, Durham]] (1988 to 1992).&lt;ref name="Crockford"&gt;{{Crockford| surname = Thiselton | forenames = Anthony Charles | id = 19906 | accessed = 18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a priest and canon in the [[Church of England]], in which he represents the Diocese of Southwell on the church's [[General Synod]]. He is an associate priest in the parish of St Mary the Virgin, Attenborough, Nottingham. On 25 June 2002, he was presented with a [[Lambeth Degree]] of Doctorate of Divinity by the then Archbishop of Canterbury, [[George Carey]].

He was visiting Professor at Fuller Theological Seminary, Pasadena; Calvin College, Grand Rapids; Regent College, Vancouver; North Park, Seminary, Chicago; the University of Utrecht, Netherlands; several seminaries in South Korea; Senior Lecturer in the University of Sheffield; and Professor of Theology in the University of Chester.

He served on the Church of England General Synod membership, and its Commissions and Committees:  Crown Nominations Commission, 2000-2010); Appointments Committee (2008–13); and Theological Education and Training Committee (1999-2005).  Outside Synod he remained on the Doctrine Commission for nearly 30 years: Church of England Doctrine Commission (1976-2006); Acting Chairman, (1987); Church of England Faith and Order Group (1979–89); Theological Education in the Anglican Communion (2003–06).

His main published work has been in the areas of [[hermeneutics]] (especially hermeneutical theory and its relationship to biblical interpretation), Christian doctrine (including eschatology and pneumatology), and biblical studies, in particular with two substantial commentaries on [[1 Corinthians]]. He is unusual in academic theology for publishing research-level works across such a broad range of topics.

He received a ''[[Festschrift|festschrift]]'', edited by Stanley Porter and Matthew Malcolm, entitled ''Horizons in Hermeneutics'' (Eerdmans) in April 2013. In June 2012 he was also the subject of a one-day conference in his honour, at the University of Nottingham, at which he presented a response paper to several contributors who spoke in light of his work. Proceedings from this conference were published by Paternoster (in the UK) and IVP (in the US) as ''The Future of Biblical Interpretation'' (2013). St John's College, Nottingham, inaugurated a series of "Thiselton lectures" in 2013 to honour his work in hermeneutics. He gave the first of these himself, in June 2013.

'''BeBionic''' is a commercial [[prosthetic hand]] designed to enable [[amputees]] to perform everyday activities, such as eating, drinking, writing, typing, turning a key in a lock and picking up small objects. 

The first version of the bebionic hand was launched at the World Congress and Orthopädie &amp; Reha-Technik, Trade Show, [[Leipzig]], [[Germany]] in May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ORTHOPÄDIE International Trade Show|url=http://www.ot-leipzig.de/LeMMon/ort_web_eng.nsf/framessuchen?OpenPage&amp;Query=bebionic|publisher=ORTHOPAEDIE + REHA-TECHNIK 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RSLSteeper launches bebionic fully articulating myo-electric hand|url=http://www.gizmag.com/rslsteeper-bebionic-fully-articulating-myo-electric-hand/15501/|publisher=GizMag|accessdate=22 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Designed in the [[United Kingdom]], the bebionic hand is manufactured by RSL Steeper and is available worldwide.

== Technology ==

The bionic hand is said to receive instructions from sensors that detect the movement of the muscles in the patient’s arm. These instructions are processed, which are then directed to the 337 mechanical parts, which are present within this bionic hand that eventually, mimic natural human movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.todaysmedicaldevelopments.com/article/micromo-faulhaber-prosthetic-medical-device-bebionic-3917/|title=Bebionic myoelectric hand prosthesis - Today's Medical Developments|work=Today's Medical Developments|access-date=2017-09-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

== bebionic 2.0 ==

In September 2011, the bebionic second-generation prosthetic hand was updated with improvements to speed, accuracy, grip and durability. The updated version also saw the bebionic hand available two sizes - medium and large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bionic hand gets a grip on prosthetics market|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/pharmaceuticalsandchemicals/8816665/Bionic-hand-gets-a-grip-on-prosthetics-market.html|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=10 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The device was upgraded with new, higher capacity 2200mAh split cell internal batteries for increased usage time.

== Patients ==

During 2008, Jonathan Metz, from West Hartford, [[Connecticut]], got his arm wedged in his basement furnace. Trapped in his own basement for three days, he had no alternative to self-amputate his own arm. Since using the prosthetic hand, in 2010, his life has dramatically improved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NBC Connecticut, Self-Amputee Makes Amazing Strides With Prosthesis|publisher=NBC Connecticut|url=http://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/Self-Amputee-Makes-Amazing-Strides-With-Prosthesis-101479284.html|accessdate=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2012, [[Kingston upon Hull]] man, Mike Swainger, was the first person to receive bionic hand on the [[National Health Service|NHS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mike Swainger: Amputee becomes first person to receive bionic hand on NHS|publisher=Published by the Telegraph |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/9576029/Mike-Swainger-Amputee-becomes-first-person-to-receive-bionic-hand-on-NHS.html|accessdate=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, a 26-year old London-based woman, Ashwell who was born without a right hand received Bebionic's prosthetic hand.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://inhabitat.com/26-year-old-woman-receives-worlds-most-advanced-natural-bionic-hand/|title=26-year-old woman receives world's most advanced bionic hand|access-date=2017-09-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Margarita Gracheva, from the Moscow Serpukhov, had her hands cut off by her husband. After six months of rehabilitation, dozens of concerned viewers of the Program live with Andrey Malakhov of Russia 1 TV channel, helped to make it super-modern {{YouTube|ThIUgPLaK9Q|prosthesis Bebionic}}.

== Pop Culture ==

In the world of [[science fiction]], the bebionic hand has been compared to the artificial hands of fictional characters such as [[The Terminator]] and [[Luke Skywalker]] from [[Star Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Father who lost arm in work accident has bionic ‘Terminator hand’ fitted so accurate he can even TYPE|url=http://swns.com/news/father-lost-arm-work-accident-bionic-terminator-hand-fitted-27120/| publisher=Published by SWNS.com|accessdate=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dvice.com/archives/2012/11/luke_skywalkers.php&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[biochemistry]] and [[metabolism]], '''beta-oxidation''' is the [[catabolism|catabolic process]] by which [[fatty acid]] molecules are broken down&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Houten SM, Wanders RJ | title = A general introduction to the biochemistry of mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation | journal = Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease | volume = 33 | issue = 5 | pages = 469–77 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20195903 | pmc = 2950079 | doi = 10.1007/s10545-010-9061-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the cytosol in prokaryotes and in the [[mitochondria]] in eukaryotes to generate [[acetyl-CoA]], which enters the [[citric acid cycle]], and [[NADH]] and [[FADH2|FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], which are co-enzymes used in the [[electron transport chain]]. It is named as such because the [[alpha and beta carbon|beta carbon]] of the fatty acid undergoes oxidation to a [[carbonyl]] group. Beta-oxidation is primarily facilitated by the [[mitochondrial trifunctional protein]], an enzyme complex associated with the [[inner mitochondrial membrane]], although [[very long chain fatty acid]]s are oxidized in [[peroxisome]]s.

The overall reaction for one cycle of beta oxidation is:

:C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-acyl-CoA  +  FAD + {{chem|NAD|+}} + {{chem|H|2|O}} + CoA → C&lt;sub&gt;''n''-2&lt;/sub&gt;-acyl-CoA + {{chem|FADH|2}} + NADH + {{chem|H|+}} + acetyl-CoA

==Overview==
Fatty acid catabolism consists of:
#Activation and membrane transport of free fatty acids by binding to [[coenzyme A]].
#Oxidation of the beta carbon to a carbonyl group.
#Cleavage of two-carbon segments resulting in [[acetyl-CoA]].
#Oxidation of [[acetyl-CoA]] to [[carbon dioxide]] in the [[citric acid cycle]].
#Electron transfer from electron carriers to the [[electron transport chain]] in [[oxidative phosphorylation]].

==Activation and membrane transport==
[[File:Metabolism1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A diagrammatic illustration of the process of lipolysis (in a fat cell) induced by high [[epinephrine]] and low [[insulin]] levels in the blood. Epinephrine binds to a [[Adrenergic receptor#β receptors|beta-adrenergic]] receptor in the cell wall of the adipocyte, which causes [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]] to be generated inside the cell. The cAMP activates a [[protein kinase]], which phosphorylates and thus, in turn, activates a [[hormone-sensitive lipase]] in the fat cell. This lipase cleaves free fatty acids from their attachment to glycerol in the fat stored in the fat droplet of the adipocyte. The free fatty acids and glycerol are then released into the blood.]]

[[File:Metabolism2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A diagrammatic illustration of the transport of [[free fatty acids]] in the blood attached to [[Serum albumin|plasma albumin]], its diffusion across the cell membrane using a protein transporter, and its activation, using [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], to form [[acyl-CoA]] in the [[cytosol]]. The illustration is, for diagrammatic purposes, of a 12 carbon fatty acid. Most fatty acids in human plasma are 16 or 18 carbon atoms long.]]

[[File:Metabolism3.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A diagrammatic illustration of the transfer of an acyl-CoA molecule across the inner membrane of the [[mitochondrion]] by [[Carnitine O-palmitoyltransferase|carnitine-acyl-CoA transferase]] (CAT). The illustrated acyl chain is, for diagrammatic purposes, only 12 carbon atoms long. Most fatty acids in human plasma are 16 or 18 carbon atoms long. CAT is inhibited by high concentrations of [[malonyl-CoA]] (the first committed step in [[fatty acid synthesis]]) in the cytoplasm. This means that fatty acid synthesis and fatty acid catabolism cannot occur simultaneously in any given cell.]]

==General mechanism==

Once the fatty acid is inside the [[mitochondrial matrix]], beta-oxidation occurs by cleaving two carbons every cycle to form acetyl-CoA. The process consists of 4 steps.

#A long-chain fatty acid is [[dehydrogenation|dehydrogenated]] to create a trans [[double bond]] between C2 and C3. This is catalyzed by [[acyl CoA dehydrogenase]] to produce trans-delta 2-enoyl CoA. It uses FAD as an electron acceptor and it is reduced to FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  
#Trans-delta2-enoyl CoA is hydrated at the double bond to produce L-3-hydroxyacyl CoA by [[enoyl-CoA hydratase]]. 
#L-3-hydroxyacyl CoA is dehydrogenated again to create 3-ketoacyl CoA by 3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase. This enzyme uses NAD as an electron acceptor. 
#[[Thiolysis]] occurs between C2 and C3 (alpha and beta carbons) of 3-ketoacyl CoA. Thiolase enzyme catalyzes the reaction when a new molecule of coenzyme A breaks the bond by nucleophilic attack on C3. This releases the first two carbon units, as acetyl CoA, and a fatty acyl CoA minus two carbons. The process continues until all of the carbons in the fatty acid are turned into acetyl CoA.

Fatty acids are oxidized by most of the tissues in the body. However, some tissues such as the [[Erythrocytes|red blood cells]] of mammals (which do not contain mitochondria),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stier A, Bize P, Schull Q, Zoll J, Singh F, Geny B, Gros F, Royer C, Massemin S, Criscuolo F | title = Avian erythrocytes have functional mitochondria, opening novel perspectives for birds as animal models in the study of ageing | journal = Frontiers in Zoology | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 33 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23758841 | pmc = 3686644 | doi = 10.1186/1742-9994-10-33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and cells of the [[central nervous system]] do not use fatty acids for their energy requirements,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schönfeld P, Reiser G | title = Why does brain metabolism not favor burning of fatty acids to provide energy? Reflections on disadvantages of the use of free fatty acids as fuel for brain | journal = Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism | volume = 33 | issue = 10 | pages = 1493–9 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 23921897 | pmc = 3790936 | doi = 10.1038/jcbfm.2013.128 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but instead use carbohydrates (red blood cells and neurons) or [[ketone bodies]] (neurons only).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yoshida T, Shevkoplyas SS | title = Anaerobic storage of red blood cells | journal = Blood Transfusion = Trasfusione del Sangue | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = 220–36 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20967163 | pmc = 2957487 | doi = 10.2450/2010.0022-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Because many fatty acids are not fully saturated or do not have an even number of carbons, several different mechanisms have evolved, described below.
{{-}}
==Even-numbered saturated fatty acids==
Once inside the mitochondria, each cycle of β-oxidation, liberating a two carbon unit ([[acetyl-CoA]]), occurs in a sequence of four reactions:

{| class="wikitable"
| '''Description''' || '''Diagram''' || '''Enzyme''' || '''End product'''
 |- 
 | ''[[Dehydrogenation]] by [[flavin adenine dinucleotide|FAD]]:'' The first step is the oxidation of the fatty acid by Acyl-CoA-Dehydrogenase. The enzyme catalyzes the formation of a [[double bond]] between the C-2 and C-3.  || [[Image:Beta-Oxidation1.svg|center|400px]] || [[acyl CoA dehydrogenase]] || trans-Δ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-enoyl-CoA
 |- 
 | ''Hydration:'' The next step is the [[hydration reaction|hydration]] of the bond between C-2 and C-3. The reaction is [[stereospecific]], forming only the L [[isomer]]. || [[Image:Beta-Oxidation2.svg|center|400px]] ||  [[enoyl CoA hydratase]]  || L-β-hydroxyacyl CoA
 |- 
 | ''[[Oxidation]] by [[NADH|NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]]:'' The third step is the [[oxidation]] of L-β-hydroxyacyl CoA by NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. This converts the [[hydroxyl]] group into a [[ketone|keto]] group. || [[Image:Beta-Oxidation3.svg|center|400px]] || [[3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase]]  || β-ketoacyl CoA
 |- 
 | ''[[Thiolysis]]:'' The final step is the cleavage of β-ketoacyl CoA by the [[thiol]] group of another molecule of [[Coenzyme A]]. The thiol is inserted between C-2 and C-3. || [[Image:Beta-Oxidation4.svg|center|400px]] || [[β-ketothiolase]]  || An [[acetyl-CoA]] molecule, and an [[acyl-CoA]] molecule that is two carbons shorter 
|}

This process continues until the entire chain is cleaved into acetyl CoA units. The final cycle produces two separate acetyl CoAs, instead of one acyl CoA and one acetyl CoA.  For every cycle, the Acyl CoA unit is shortened by two carbon atoms. Concomitantly, one molecule of FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, NADH and acetyl CoA are formed.

==Odd-numbered saturated fatty acids==
In general, fatty acids with an odd number of carbons are found in the lipids of plants and some marine organisms. Many ruminant animals form a large amount of 3-carbon propionate during the fermentation of carbohydrates in the rumen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Nelson DL, Cox MM | date = 2005 | title = Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry | edition = 4th | location = New York | publisher = W. H. Freeman and Company | pages = 648–649 | isbn =  978-0-7167-4339-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Long-chain fatty acids with an odd number of carbon atoms are found particularly in ruminant fat and milk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Harper's Illustrated Biochemistry | publisher = McGraw-Hill Publishing Company | first = Victor W. | last = Rodwell | name-list-format = vanc | edition = 31st }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chains with an odd-number of [[carbon]]s are oxidized in the same manner as even-numbered chains, but the final products are [[propionyl-CoA]] and Acetyl CoA

Propionyl-CoA is first carboxylated using a [[bicarbonate]] [[ion]] into D-stereoisomer of methylmalonyl-CoA, in a reaction that involves a [[biotin]] [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|co-factor]], ATP, and the enzyme [[propionyl-CoA carboxylase]]. The bicarbonate ion's carbon is added to the middle carbon of propionyl-CoA, forming a D-methylmalonyl-CoA. However, the D conformation is enzymatically converted into the L conformation by [[methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase]], then it undergoes intramolecular rearrangement, which is catalyzed by [[methylmalonyl-CoA mutase]] (requiring B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; as a coenzyme) to form succinyl-CoA. The [[succinyl-CoA]] formed can then enter the [[citric acid cycle]].

However, whereas acetyl-CoA enters the citric acid cycle by condensing with an existing molecule of oxaloacetate, succinyl-CoA enters the cycle as a principal in its own right. Thus the succinate just adds to the population of circulating molecules in the cycle and undergoes no net metabolization while in it. When this infusion of citric acid cycle intermediates exceeds [[cataplerosis|cataplerotic]] demand (such as for [[aspartate]] or [[glutamate]] synthesis), some of them can be extracted to the [[gluconeogenesis]] pathway, in the liver and kidneys, through [[phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase]], and converted to free glucose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=King|first=Michael | name-list-format = vanc |title=Gluconeogenesis: Synthesis of New Glucose |url=http://themedicalbiochemistrypage.org/gluconeogenesis.php |work=Subsection: "Propionate" |publisher=themedicalbiochemistrypage.org, LLC |access-date=20 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unsaturated fatty acids==
β-Oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids poses a problem since the location of a cis bond can prevent the formation of a trans-Δ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; bond. These situations are handled by an additional two enzymes, [[Enoyl CoA isomerase]] or [[2,4 Dienoyl CoA reductase]].
[[File:Linoleic acid beta oxidation.svg|alt=|thumb|Complete beta oxidation of [[linoleic acid]] (an unsaturated fatty acid).]]
Whatever the conformation of the hydrocarbon chain, β-oxidation occurs normally until the acyl CoA (because of the presence of a double bond) is not an appropriate substrate for [[acyl CoA dehydrogenase]], or [[enoyl CoA hydratase]]:

*If the acyl CoA contains a ''cis-Δ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; bond'', then ''cis-Δ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''-[[Enoyl CoA isomerase]] will convert the bond to a ''trans-Δ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' bond, which is a regular substrate.
*If the acyl CoA contains a ''cis-Δ&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; double bond'', then its dehydrogenation yields a 2,4-dienoyl intermediate, which is not a substrate for enoyl CoA hydratase. However, the enzyme [[2,4 Dienoyl CoA reductase]] reduces the intermediate, using NADPH, into ''trans-Δ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''-enoyl CoA. As in the above case, this compound is converted into a suitable intermediate by 3,2-Enoyl CoA isomerase.

To summarize:
*''Odd-numbered'' double bonds are handled by the isomerase.
*''Even-numbered'' double bonds by the reductase (which creates an odd-numbered double bond)

==Peroxisomal beta-oxidation==
Fatty acid oxidation also occurs in [[peroxisome]]s when the fatty acid chains are too long to be handled by the mitochondria. The same enzymes are used in peroxisomes as in the mitochondrial matrix, and acetyl-CoA is generated. It is believed that very long chain (greater than C-22) fatty acids, branched fatty acids,&lt;ref name="pmid9059978"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Singh I | title = Biochemistry of peroxisomes in health and disease | journal = Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry | volume = 167 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 1–29 | date = February 1997 | pmid = 9059978 | doi = 10.1023/A:1006883229684 }}&lt;/ref&gt; some [[prostaglandin]]s and [[leukotriene]]s&lt;ref name="GibsonLake2013"&gt;{{cite book| first1 = G. Gordon | last1 = Gibson | first2 = Brian G. | last2 = Lake | name-list-format = vanc |title=Peroxisomes: Biology and Importance in Toxicology and Medicine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YwEMQLzH-bYC&amp;pg=PA69|date=2013-04-08|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-203-48151-6|pages=69–}}&lt;/ref&gt; undergo initial oxidation in peroxisomes until [[octanoyl-CoA]] is formed, at which point it undergoes mitochondrial oxidation.&lt;ref name="pmid627552"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lazarow PB | title = Rat liver peroxisomes catalyze the beta oxidation of fatty acids | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 253 | issue = 5 | pages = 1522–8 | date = March 1978 | pmid = 627552 | url = http://www.jbc.org/content/253/5/1522.short }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One significant difference is that oxidation in peroxisomes is not coupled to [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] synthesis. Instead, the high-potential electrons are transferred to O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which yields H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It does generate heat however. The enzyme [[catalase]], found exclusively in peroxisomes, converts the [[hydrogen peroxide]] into [[water]] and [[oxygen]].

Peroxisomal β-oxidation also requires enzymes specific to the peroxisome and to very long fatty acids. There are three key differences between the enzymes used for mitochondrial and peroxisomal β-oxidation:
#The NADH formed in the third oxidative step cannot be reoxidized in the peroxisome, so reducing equivalents are exported to the cytosol. 
#β-oxidation in the peroxisome requires the use of a peroxisomal [[carnitine acyltransferase]] (instead of carnitine acyltransferase I and II used by the mitochondria) for transport of the activated acyl group into the mitochondria for further breakdown.
#The first oxidation step in the peroxisome is catalyzed by the enzyme [[acyl-CoA oxidase]].
#The [[β-ketothiolase]] used in peroxisomal β-oxidation has an altered substrate specificity, different from the mitochondrial [[β-ketothiolase]].

Peroxisomal oxidation is induced by a high-fat diet and administration of hypolipidemic drugs like [[clofibrate]].

==Energy yield==
The ATP yield for every oxidation cycle is theoretically a maximum yield of 17, as NADH produces 2.5 ATP, FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; produces 1.5 and a full rotation of the citric acid cycle produces 10.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} In practice it is closer to 14 ATP for a full oxidation cycle as the theoretical yield is not attained - it is generally closer to 2.5 ATP per NADH molecule produced, 1.5 for each FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule produced and this equates to 10 per cycle of the TCA {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}(according to the [[P/O ratio]]), broken down as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
| '''Source''' || '''ATP''' || '''Total'''
 |- 
 |  1 [[FADH2|FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] || x 1.5 ATP  || = 1.5 ATP (Theoretically 2 ATP){{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}
 |- 
 |  1 [[NADH]] || x 2.5 ATP  || = 2.5 ATP (Theoretically 3 ATP){{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}
 |- 
 | 1 [[acetyl CoA]] ||  x 10 ATP  || = 10 ATP (Theoretically 12 ATP){{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}
 |- 
 | TOTAL  ||     || = 14 ATP
|}

For an even-numbered saturated fat (C&lt;sub&gt;2n&lt;/sub&gt;), n - 1 oxidations are necessary, and the final process yields an additional acetyl CoA. In addition, two equivalents of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] are lost during the activation of the fatty acid. Therefore, the total ATP yield can be stated as:

:(n - 1) * 14 + 10 - 2 = total ATP{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}
or
:14n-6 (alternatively)
For instance, the ATP yield of [[palmitate]] (C&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n = 8'') is:

:(8 - 1) * 14 + 10 - 2 = 106 ATP{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Represented in table form:

{| class="wikitable"
| '''Source''' || '''ATP''' || '''Total'''
 |- 
 |  7 FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || x 1.5 ATP  || = 10.5 ATP
 |- 
 |  7 NADH || x 2.5 ATP  || = 17.5 ATP
 |- 
 | 8 acetyl CoA ||  x 10 ATP  || = 80 ATP
 |- 
 | Activation ||     || = -2 ATP
 |- 
 | NET  ||     || = 106 ATP
|}{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

For sources that use the larger ATP production numbers described above, the total would be 129 ATP ={(8-1)*17+12-2} equivalents per palmitate.

Beta-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids changes the ATP yield due to the requirement of two possible additional enzymes.

==Similarities between beta-oxidation and citric acid cycle==
The reactions of beta oxidation and part of citric acid cycle present structural similarities in three of four reactions of the beta oxidation: the oxidation by FAD, the hydration, and the oxidation by NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Each enzyme of these metabolic pathways presents structural similarity.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==Clinical significance==
There are at least 25 enzymes and specific transport proteins in the β-oxidation pathway.&lt;ref name=Tein2013&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Tein I | title = Disorders of fatty acid oxidation | journal = Handbook of Clinical Neurology | volume = 113 | pages = 1675–88 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23622388 | doi = 10.1016/B978-0-444-59565-2.00035-6 | isbn = 9780444595652 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, 18 have been associated with human disease as [[inborn error of metabolism|inborn errors of metabolism]].

Caribmap is created and directed by a scientist, [[S. Blair Hedges]], who is responsible for managing all content.&lt;ref name="cm" /&gt; It has received large donations of map images from public and private institutions such as the [[Branner Earth Sciences Library|Branner Earth Sciences Library &amp; Map Collections]] of [[Stanford University]], the [[Norman B. Leventhal Map Center]] at the [[Boston Public Library]], the [[Perry–Castañeda Library|Perry-Castañeda Library]] of the [[University of Texas at Austin]], and the [[George A. Smathers Libraries]] of the [[University of Florida]].

== Contents ==

Caribmap encompasses the geographic range of the [[Caribbean Sea]] and its islands, including those bordering the Middle and South American mainland, such as the [[Bay Islands Department|Bay Islands]] of [[Honduras]], [[ABC islands (Lesser Antilles)|ABC Islands]] ([[Aruba]], [[Bonaire]], and [[Curaçao]]), [[Trinidad]], and [[Tobago]]. The [[Bahamas]] and [[Turks and Caicos Islands]] are also incorporated due to their cultural, economic, and historic links to the Caribbean islands.&lt;ref name="cm" /&gt;

The site features scans of high-resolution maps, organized by islands, which allow the capability to zoom in on details of historic or scientific importance. Map thumbnail images pertaining to that island are sorted in chronological order by the year the map was made, above the viewing area. Bibliographic information (title, year, maker, medium, size, and credit) is displayed under each map. The site also has a feature called “map tours,” focused on individual islands (currently only Jamaica), which are short videos featuring historical maps and 3D scenes from [[Google Earth]]. One demonstrated use of Caribmap, given its large number of high-resolution map images, has been quantitative historical analysis, which traces the use of [[toponymy|toponyms]] (place names) through time.&lt;ref name="cm" /&gt;

The '''Centre for Quantum Computation''' ('''CQC''') is an alliance of [[quantum information]] research groups at the [[University of Oxford]]. It was founded by [[Artur Ekert]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.istl.org/09-spring/internet.html/ Quantum Computing] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207074006/http://www.istl.org/09-spring/internet.html/ |date=December 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1998.

Until recently, the CQC also included research groups at the [[University of Cambridge]], but now the Cambridge groups operate as an independent entity called the '''Cambridge Centre for Quantum Information and Foundations''' ('''CQIF''').

==Research==
The CQC conducts theoretical and experimental research into [[quantum computing]], [[quantum cryptography]] and other forms of [[quantum information processing]], into the implications of the [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] of information for [[physics]] itself, and into foundational and conceptual questions in [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] and [[quantum information theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxfordquantum.org/ |title=Oxford Quantum |publisher=Oxford Quantum |date= |accessdate=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Groups==
Initially the CQC was based at the [[Clarendon Laboratory]], but it has now grown to span several departments at the University of Oxford:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qubit.org/qubit-blog/ CQC Research Groups] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206103346/http://www.qubit.org/qubit-blog/ |date=December 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The Centre has its origins in the early 80's when the computer industry began to worry about the limits of computing. In 1981, Oxford physicist [[David Deutsch]] attended a party in Texas given by the famous American physicist [[John Archibald Wheeler|John Wheeler]] who had invited a number of scientists interested in the foundations of computing. It was at this party that Deutsch gained the crucial insight that would lead to an entirely new branch of physics. At the time, computer scientists were turning to [[Newtonian physics]] to try to resolve certain fundamental puzzles in the field. But during a conversation at Wheeler’s party, Deutsch realised that this was the wrong approach. Physics is fundamentally governed by quantum theory, and Deutsch could see immediately that using quantum theory instead of Newtonian physics would give a different result. As a consequence of this insight, Deutsch published the paper in 1985 that is now generally regarded as a classic in the field.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030915061044/http://www.qubit.org/oldsite/resource/deutsch85.pdf  Deutsch, David (July 1985). "Quantum theory, the Church-Turing principle and the universal quantum computer". Proceedings of the Royal Society of London; Series A, Mathematical and Physical Sciences 400 (1818): pp. 97–117. ] {{doi|10.1098/rspa.1985.0070}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper describes how a computer might run using quantum mechanics and why such a computer is fundamentally different from ordinary computers.

In 1987, Artur Ekert arrived at Oxford to work on a PhD at the Department of Physics, where he met Deutsch. Whilst working at Oxford, Ekert developed a theory of cryptography based on quantum entanglement. A chance meeting on the ski slopes of the Alps with [[John Rarity]], a scientist at [[Defence Evaluation and Research Agency|DERA]] (the UK’s military research organisation), led to a collaboration in which Ekert’s scheme was tested experimentally in the early 90's. After finishing his phd, Ekert gained a junior research fellowship from [[Merton College, Oxford|Merton]] and took on his first PhD student. With Deutsch, this created a small team that within a year had acquired the title of the Quantum Computation and Cryptography Group.

A breakthrough in 1994 by [[Peter Shor]], a researcher at the labs of the American telecommunications giant [[AT&amp;T]], boosted the entire field of quantum information. Shor showed that Deutch’s quantum computer could actually solve an important problem that an ordinary computer would find impossible. For the first time, it became clear that quantum computers were far from unimportant curiosities. After Shor’s announcement, quantum information became increasingly popular with Oxford. In 1995, [[Andrew Steane]] began an experimental effort to study how quantum computers might be built from ionised atoms trapped by laser beams. In 1996, [[Jonathan A. Jones|Jonathan Jones]] started a group working on a quantum computer based on the same techniques used in magnetic resonance imaging in medicine.  And two years later, [[Dirk Bouwmeester]] arrived from [[Geneva]] to begin an experimental group working out how the quantum world could also revolutionise communication. The group changed its name to the Centre from Quantum Computation.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Today, feature on Quantum Computing, 27 Oct 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cambridge==
[[Image:CQCgroupphoto2006.jpg|thumb|right|alt=CQC group photo at Cambridge, 2006.|CQC group photo, Cambridge, 2006]]
When Artur Ekert moved to Cambridge to become the first Leigh Trapnell Professor of Quantum Physics in 2002, the '''Cambridge Centre for Quantum Computation''' was created. It continued under this name until 2010, when the existing research group was joined by [[Richard Jozsa]], and the centre was renamed the Cambridge Centre for Quantum Information and Foundations (CQIF), reflecting the broad range of its research activities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3874">'''Charlotte Elisheva Fonrobert''' (born 1965 in Düsseldorf, Germany) is a professor in the Religious Studies department of [[Stanford University]]. She specializes in [[Judaism]], especially talmudic literature and culture. Her research interests include gender in Jewish culture, the relationship between Judaism and Christianity in [[Late Antiquity]], the discourses of orthodoxy versus heresy, and rabbinic conceptions of Judaism with respect to Greco-Roman culture. She completed her graduate training at the [[Graduate Theological Union]] in Berkeley, CA. In 2007 she wrote the article [http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/gender-identity-in-halakhic-discourse Gender Identity In Halakhic Discourse] for ''Jewish Women: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia''; this is likely the first scholarly article on the topic.&lt;ref name="jweekly"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/72653/the-space-between-stanford-prof-talmudic-rabbis-were-into-analyzing-sexuali/|publisher=jweekly.com|title=the space between &amp;#124; Stanford prof: Talmudic rabbis were into analyzing sexuality &amp;#8211; J.|accessdate=2017-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, she was named to the inaugural membership of the [[Shalom Hartman Institute]] North American Scholars Circle.

Fonrobert is the author of ''Menstrual Purity: Rabbinic and Christian Reconstructions of Biblical Gender'' (2000), which won the Salo Baron Prize for a best first book in Jewish Studies of the year and was a finalist for the National Jewish Book Award in Jewish Scholarship. She also wrote the essay "Regulating the Human Body: Rabbinic Legal Discourse and the Making of Jewish Gender", which was included in the book ''Balancing on the Mechitza: Transgender in Jewish Community'', edited by Noach Dzmura, and in the book ''Keep Your Wives Away from Them: Orthodox Women, Unorthodox Desires: an Anthology'', edited by Miryam Kabakov.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Balancing on the Mechitza: Transgender in Jewish Community|author=Dzmura, N.|date=2014|publisher=North Atlantic Books|isbn=9781583949719|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KNLrAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA242|page=242|accessdate=2017-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Keep Your Wives Away from Them: Orthodox Women, Unorthodox Desires : an Anthology|author=Kabakov, M.|date=2010|publisher=North Atlantic Books|isbn=9781556438790|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=swe9abXKmYcC|accessdate=2017-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is currently working on a project which examines the relationship between religious identity and space, ranging from urban neighborhoods to the wilderness, in Jewish and Christian Late Antiquity. As part of this project, she edited and introduced a collection of articles on the subject of "Jewish Conceptions and Practices of Space" together with Vered Shemtov ([[Stanford University]]). She also co-edited the Cambridge Companion to Rabbinic Literature, with Martin Jaffee ([[University of Washington]]). It contains, among other things, her essay "Regulating the Human Body: Rabbinic Legal Discourse and the Making of Jewish Gender."&lt;ref name="menachemmendel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://menachemmendel.net/blog/cambridge-companion-to-rabbinic-literature/|publisher=menachemmendel.net|title=Cambridge Companion to Rabbinic Literature &amp;#171; Menachem Mendel|accessdate=2017-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chemokine receptors''' are [[cytokine receptor]]s found on the surface of certain cells that interact with a type of [[cytokine]] called a [[chemokine]].&lt;ref name="pmid10699158"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Murphy PM, Baggiolini M, Charo IF, Hébert CA, Horuk R, Matsushima K, Miller LH, Oppenheim JJ, Power CA | title = International union of pharmacology.

Following interaction with their specific chemokine [[ligand]]s, chemokine receptors trigger a [[flux#Biology|flux]] in [[intracellular]] calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) ions ([[calcium signaling]]). This causes cell responses, including the onset of a process known as [[chemotaxis]] that traffics the cell to a desired location within the organism.  Chemokine receptors are divided into different families, [[CXC chemokine receptors]], [[CC chemokine receptors]], [[CX3CR1|CX3C chemokine receptors]] and [[XCR1|XC chemokine receptors]] that correspond to the 4 distinct subfamilies of chemokines they bind. Four families of chemokine receptors differ in spacing of cysteine residues near N-terminal of the receptor.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kakinuma|first=Takashi|last2=Hwang|first2=Sam T.|date=2006-04-01|title=Chemokines, chemokine receptors, and cancer metastasis|journal=Journal of Leukocyte Biology|volume=79|issue=4|pages=639–651|doi=10.1189/jlb.1105633|issn=0741-5400|pmid=16478915}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structural characteristics==
Chemokine receptors are [[G protein-coupled receptor]]s containing 7 [[transmembrane]] domains &lt;ref name="Arimont_2017"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Arimont A, Sun S, Smit MJ, Leurs R, de Esch IJ, de Graaf C | title = Structural Analysis of Chemokine Receptor-Ligand Interactions | journal = J Med Chem | year = 2017 | pmid = 28165741 | doi = 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.6b01309}}&lt;/ref&gt;  that are found predominantly on the surface of [[leukocyte]]s. Approximately 19 different chemokine receptors have been characterized to date, which share many common structural features; they are composed of about 350 [[amino acid]]s that are divided into a short and acidic N-terminal end, seven helical transmembrane domains with three [[intracellular]] and three [[extracellular]] [[hydrophilic]] loops, and an intracellular C-terminus containing [[serine]] and [[threonine]] residues that act as [[phosphorylation]] sites during receptor regulation. The first two extracellular loops of chemokine receptors are linked together by [[disulfide bond]]ing between two conserved [[cysteine]] residues.  The [[N-terminal]] end of a chemokine receptor binds to chemokine(s) and is important for ligand specificity. [[G-protein]]s couple to the C-terminal end, which is important for receptor signaling following ligand binding. Although chemokine receptors share high amino acid identity in their primary sequences, they typically bind a limited number of ligands.&lt;ref name="Murdoch_2000"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Murdoch C, Finn A | title = Chemokine receptors and their role in inflammation and infectious diseases | journal = Blood | volume = 95 | issue = 10 | pages = 3032–43 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10807766 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemokine receptors are redundant in their function as more than one chemokine is able to bind to a single receptor.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Signal transduction==
{{details|G protein}}
[[Cell signaling|Intracellular signaling]] by chemokine receptors is dependent on neighbouring G-proteins. G-proteins exist as a heterotrimer; they are composed of three distinct subunits.   When the molecule [[Guanosine diphosphate|GDP]] is bound to the G-protein subunit, the G-protein is in an inactive state. Following binding of the chemokine ligand, chemokine receptors associate with G-proteins, allowing the exchange of GDP for another molecule called [[Guanosine triphosphate|GTP]], and the dissociation of the different G protein subunits. The subunit called Gα activates an [[enzyme]] known as [[Phospholipase C]] (PLC) that is associated with the [[cell membrane]]. PLC cleaves [[Phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate]] (PIP2) to form two [[second messenger]] molecules called [[inositol triphosphate]] (IP3) and [[diglyceride|diacylglycerol]] (DAG); DAG activates another enzyme called [[protein kinase C]] (PKC), and IP3 triggers the release of [[Calcium in biology|calcium]] from intracellular stores. These events promote many signaling cascades, effecting a cellular response.&lt;ref name="Murdoch blood"/&gt;  

For example, when CXCL8 (IL-8) binds to its specific receptors, [[CXC chemokine receptors#CXCR1 and CXCR2|CXCR1]] or [[CXC chemokine receptors#CXCR1 and CXCR2|CXCR2]], a rise in intracellular calcium activates the enzyme [[phospholipase D]] (PLD) that goes on to initiate an intracellular signaling cascade called the [[MAPK/ERK pathway|MAP kinase pathway]].  At the same time, the G-protein subunit Gα directly activates an enzyme called [[Tyrosine kinase|protein tyrosine kinase]] (PTK), which phosphorylates [[serine]] and [[threonine]] residues in the tail of the chemokine receptor, causing its desensitisation or inactivation.&lt;ref name="Murdoch blood"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Murdoch |first1=Craig |last2=Finn |first2=Adam |title=Chemokine receptors and their role in inflammation and infectious diseases |journal=Blood |date=2000 |volume=95 |page=3032-3043 |pmid=10807766}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiated [[MAP kinase]] pathway activates specific cellular mechanisms involved in [[chemotaxis]], [[degranulation]], release of [[superoxide]] anions, and changes in the avidity of [[cell adhesion molecule]]s called [[integrin]]s.&lt;ref name = Murdoch_2000/&gt; Chemokines and their receptors play a crucial role in cancer metastatis as they are involved in extravastation, migration, micrometastatis, and angiogenesis.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This role of chemokine is strikingly similar to their normal function of localizing leukocytes to an inflammatory site.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Selective pressures on Chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) ==
[[Human Immunodeficiency Virus|Human Immunodeficiency virus]] uses CCR5 receptor to target and infect host [[T cell|T-cells]] in humans. It weakens the immune system by destroying the CD4+ T-helper cells, making the body more susceptible to other infections. [[CCR5|CCR5-Δ32]] is an allelic variant of CCR5 gene with a 32 base pair deletion that results in a truncated receptor. People with this allele are resistant to AIDS as HIV cannot bind to the non-functional CCR5 receptor. An unusually high frequency of this allele is found in European [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] population, with an observed cline towards the north.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Most researchers have attributed the current frequency of this allele to two major epidemics of human history: plague and smallpox. Although this allele originated much earlier, its frequency rose dramatically about 700 years ago.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This led scientists to believe that bubonic plague acted as a selective pressure that drove [[CCR5|CCR5-Δ32]] to high frequency. It was speculated that allele may have provided protection against the [[Yersinia pestis|Yerisinia pestis]], which is the causative agent for plague. Many i[[In vivo|n vivo]] mouse studies have refuted this claim by showing no protective effects of  [[CCR5|CCR5-Δ32]] allele in mice infected with Y. pestis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mecsas|first=Joan|last2=Franklin|first2=Greg|last3=Kuziel|first3=William A.|last4=Brubaker|first4=Robert R.|last5=Falkow|first5=Stanley|last6=Mosier|first6=Donald E.|date=2004-02-12|title=Evolutionary genetics: CCR5 mutation and plague protection|journal=Nature|volume=427|issue=6975|pages=606|doi=10.1038/427606a|issn=1476-4687|pmid=14961112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Styer|first=Katie L.|last2=Click|first2=Eva M.|last3=Hopkins|first3=Gregory W.|last4=Frothingham|first4=Richard|last5=Aballay|first5=Alejandro|date=2007-07-01|title=Study of the role of CCR5 in a mouse model of intranasal challenge with Yersinia pestis|journal=Microbes and Infection / Institut Pasteur|volume=9|issue=9|pages=1135–1138|doi=10.1016/j.micinf.2007.04.012|issn=1286-4579|pmc=2754264|pmid=17644454}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory that has gained more scientific support links the current frequency of the allele to smallpox epidemic. Although plague has killed a greater number people in a given time period, smallpox has collectively taken more lives.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As [[smallpox]] has been dated back to 2000 years, a longer time period would have given smallpox enough time to exert selective pressure given an earlier origin of CCR5-Δ32.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Population genetic models that analyzed geographic and temporal distribution of both plague and smallpox provide a much stronger evidence for smallpox as the driving factor of CCR5-Δ32.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galvani|first=Alison P.|last2=Slatkin|first2=Montgomery|date=2003-12-09|title=Evaluating plague and smallpox as historical selective pressures for the CCR5-Delta 32 HIV-resistance allele|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=100|issue=25|pages=15276–15279|doi=10.1073/pnas.2435085100|issn=0027-8424|pmc=299980|pmid=14645720}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smallpox has a higher mortality rate than plague, and it mostly affects children under the age of ten.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; From an evolutionary viewpoint, this results in greater loss of reproductive potential from a population which may explain increased selective pressure by smallpox. Smallpox was more prevalent in regions where higher CCR5-Δ32 frequencies are seen. [[Myxoma]] and [[Variola Major|variola major]] belong to the same family of viruses and myxoma has been shown to use [[CCR5]] receptor to enter its host.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lalani|first=A. S.|last2=Masters|first2=J.|last3=Zeng|first3=W.|last4=Barrett|first4=J.|last5=Pannu|first5=R.|last6=Everett|first6=H.|last7=Arendt|first7=C.

Recent evidence provides a strong support for smallpox as the selective agent for CCR5-Δ32.

==Families==
* [[CXC chemokine receptors]] (seven  members)
* [[CC chemokine receptors]] (ten/eleven members)
* C chemokine receptors (one member, [[XCR1]])
* CX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C chemokine receptors (one member, [[CX3CR1]])
Fifty chemokines have been discovered so far, and most bind onto CXC and CC families.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Two types of chemokines that bind to these receptors are inflammatory chemokines and homeostatic chemokines. Inflammatory chemokines are expressed upon leukocyte activation, whereas homeostatic chemokines show continual expression.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19894">The '''conservation and restoration of Pompeian frescoes''' describes the activities, methods, and techniques that have historically and are currently being used to care for the preserved remains of the [[fresco]]es from the archeological site of [[Pompeii]], Italy. The ancient city of Pompeii is famously known for its demise in A.D. 79 after the fatal eruption of [[Mount Vesuvius]] wiped out the population and buried the city beneath layers of compact lava material.&lt;ref name=:1&gt;Moormann, E. M. (1987). Destruction and restoration of Campanian mural paintings in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In S. Cather (Ed.), The Conservation Of Wall Paintings (87-101).

(2015). Excavation and conservation at Pompeii. The Journal of Fasti Online: Archaeological Conservation.

Retrieved from https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/fall-rise-fall-pompeii-180955732/&lt;/ref&gt; After centuries of cronyism, recurring financial shortages, and on-again-off-again restoration, the city's frescoes and structures were left in poor condition.&lt;ref name=:3/&gt; In 1997, Pompeii was added to the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site|List of World Heritage Sites]].&lt;ref name=:2/&gt;

== Significant sites ==

=== Villa of the Mysteries ===
The [[Villa of the Mysteries]] is one of the best preserved homes in Pompeii.&lt;ref name=:4&gt;Cascone, S. (23 March, 2015). Pompeii unveils restoration of Dionysian frescoes at villa of mysteries. Artnetnews. Retrieved from https://news.artnet.com/exhibitions/pompeii-villa-of-mysteries-restored-280342 &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Villa of P. Fannius Synistor at Boscoreale ===
The Villa of P. Fannius Synistor at [[Boscoreale]] was excavated in 1900 and many of the frescoes were stripped from the walls and auctioned off. One of the more notable conservation and restoration projects has taken place at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York, NY, where they have restored and installed the paintings (2002-2007) from the Villa’s cubiculum, or bedroom, for the new Greek and Roman Galleries.&lt;ref name=:5&gt;Meyer, R.

=== House of the Vettii ===
The excavation of the [[House of the Vettii]] from 1894-1895 by Giuseppe Fiorelli led to the policy of completely restoring and reconstructing (select) houses and leaving all finds ''in situ'' as far as possible.&lt;ref name=:1/&gt; The House of the Vettii, located in Regio VI of Pompeii, suffered significant damage and loss of its fourth style artwork during bombings in [[WWII]].&lt;ref name=:6&gt;AD 79 Destruction and Re-discovery.

=== Praedia of Julia Felix ===
The [[House of Julia Felix|Praedia of Julia Felix]], located in Regio II of Pompeii, was one of the first houses to be thoroughly explored and is the site where the first complete [[mural]] of the tablinum was detached in 1755, led by sculptor Joseph Canart.&lt;ref name=:2/&gt;

== Composition and materials ==

=== Pigments ===
The pigments that were primarily used in the frescoes at Pompeii were mostly naturally occurring earth pigments such as:
* Red and yellow [[ochre]]s 
* [[Green earth]]
* [[Calcium carbonate]] (chalk) 
* Black produced from soot or charcoal 
* Egyptian blue (artificial pigment consisting of ground blue glass [[frit]])  
* Bright red [[cinnabar]] (toxic mercuric sulfide)&lt;ref name=:5/&gt;

=== Application ===
Pompeian frescoes were executed in the [[buon fresco]] (true fresco) technique, in which the pigments were painted onto a freshly applied, damp/wet plaster ground. The plaster contains liquid lime ([[calcium hydroxide]]). In the process of drying, the liquid lime in the plaster combines with the paints and turns into carbonate of lime, which is chemically equivalent to limestone or marble. Upon drying and setting, the pigments permanently fuse to the plaster to form a solid, durable painting.&lt;ref name=:5/&gt;

== Examination and analysis of frescoes ==
After the [[1980 Irpinia earthquake|Irpinia earthquake in 1980]] caused further weakening of Pompeii’s crumbling walls, systematic initiatives were put into place to evaluate the damage. The excavation team took documentary photographs, conducted a systematic survey, and recorded the qualitative data through a computer processing system.&lt;ref name=:2/&gt; From these findings, Mariette de Vos calculated that the number of existing paintings made up only ten percent of what was originally found in earlier excavations, while another ten percent was only known through drawings and photos.&lt;ref name=:1/&gt; For the first time, the team was able to show that Pompeii had indeed been over-excavated, and provide a comprehensive view of how, where, and to what extent conservation and restoration was needed.&lt;ref name=:2/&gt;

With innovative advances in technology, conservationists and archaeologists have now been able to reconstruct navigable [[3-D modeling|3-D models]] of the ancient Pompeian buildings and the rooms that held the frescoes. Through virtual models, and the introduction of digital architectural line drawings, missing parts of the frescoes have been virtually filled in.&lt;ref name=:5/&gt; The use of archival photographs of the frescoes from past excavations and reconstructions have also aided in the digital reconstruction of the paintings, and have allowed for their digital preservation for the future.&lt;ref name=:7&gt;Watts-Plumpkin, E.

[[Laser]]s, [[Ultrasonic testing|ultrasound]] and [[Thermography|thermal imagery]] have been used to analyze the frescoes and their level of deterioration.&lt;ref name=:4/&gt; Non-invasive measurements have been used to research and measure the level of fading, discoloration, and changes in chemical composition that have taken place in the original pigments of the frescoes, such as: VIS (Visible Light) [[spectroscopy]] with CIE L*a*b* measurements and EDXRF (Energy-Dispersive X-Ray Fluorescence) analyses; OM ([[Optical Microscopy]]) of cross sections and paint layers; [[Polarized light microscopy|PLM (Polarized Light Microscopy)]] of powder samples; FTIR/ATR ([[Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy]]/Attenuated Total Reflectance); and SEM-EDS (Scanning Electron Microscope-Energy Dispersive Spectrometry).&lt;ref name=:8&gt;EVTEK.

Extensive visitor observations and movement mapping have also been conducted in order to analyze how tourism impacts the safety of the frescoes.&lt;ref name=:9&gt;Wallace, A. (2012).

== Agents of deterioration ==

=== Physical ===
During the beginning of the excavation of Pompeii, inexperienced and untrained excavators cut out pieces of fresco they found without the use of linen and other facing materials to protect the plaster, resulting in many frescoes being broken into multiple fragments. Wall painting scenes that were considered worthy of detachment were brought to the Palazzo degli Studi in Naples, today known as the Museo Archeologico Nazionale, after 1827.&lt;ref name=:1/&gt;
[[File:Roman fresco Villa dei Misteri Pompeii 006.jpg|thumb|Roman fresco Villa dei Misteri Pompeii]]

The frescoes have been affected by rain and groundwater, which have caused water damage and [[Rising damp (structural)|rising damp]], resulting in deteriorating and collapsing walls.&lt;ref name=:10&gt;Ministero dei Beni e delle Attivita Culturali e del Turismo. (2016). Rapport de l'Etat partie sur l'état de conservation. UNESCO World Heritage Centre. Retrieved from http://whc.unesco.org/en/documents/155410&lt;/ref&gt; Frescoes are part of an open physical system in which they are in contact with contiguous structures—such as walls, roofs, and the ground—that are dynamically involved in series of chemical and physical events, such as the capillary movement and rise of moisture.&lt;ref name=:11&gt;Matteini, M. (1987). In review: An assessment of florentine methods of wall painting conservation based on the use of mineral treatments. In S. Cather (Ed.), The Conservation Of Wall Paintings (137-149). Retrieved from http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/pdf_publications/pdf/wall_paintings.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; Catastrophic physical forces such as earthquakes—which have been causing structural damage to the buildings and cracks in the walls since A.D. 62&lt;ref name=:5/&gt; —and the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, have contributed to the deterioration of the frescoes. The frescoes of Pompeii were both damaged by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius from heat and falling debris, which scratched and loosened the plaster and paint,&lt;ref name=:5/&gt; and simultaneously preserved by the volcanic ash until their discovery. In addition, the frost of 1816 entirely destroyed murals in the [[Amphitheatre of Pompeii|Amphitheatre]] in the Villa of Cicero at the Praedia of Julia Felix.&lt;ref name=:1/&gt;

Restoration efforts in the late eighteenth century resulted in poorly supported walls and masonry that have proven insufficient for the protection of the wall paintings and have contributed to their rapid degradation.&lt;ref name=:2/&gt; Plaster was fixed with heavy metal clamps, which have gradually come away and left holes and other damage, and the edges of the paintings were smeared with ordinary [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] that has yet to be replaced.&lt;ref name=:1/&gt;

Mass tourism that has taken place at Pompeii is another contributing factor to the deterioration of the frescoes. Wear and breakage have occurred due to people leaning on and touching the frescoes, as well as abrasions from bags and other objects rubbing against the frescoes in crowded areas.&lt;ref name=:9/&gt; Vandals have also defaced the frescoes with graffiti. In addition, the frescoes at Pompeii have deteriorated due to poor management, decreased internal maintenance, and a lack of sustainable methods for restoration and conservation.&lt;ref name=:12&gt;Wollner, J.L. (2013). Planning preservation in pompeii: Revising wall painting conservation method and management. Studies in Mediterranean Antiquity and Classics, 3:1. Retrieved from http://digitalcommons.macalester.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1023&amp;context=classicsjournal&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chemical ===
The constituent materials of wall paintings have a high and open [[porosity]]. Because of this, they are easily accessible to liquids and gases including: salt solutions, atmospheric pollutants, water vapor, solutions of materials used for conservation, etc.&lt;ref name=:11/&gt; Build-up from pollutants and contaminants such as waxes and gasoline—which were used in previous restoration attempts as cleaning agents—varnishes, and dust have caused the pigments in the frescoes to darken and discolor, and the figures to blur over time.&lt;ref name=:3/&gt;

Many of the frescoes were covered with varnish to protect them at their creation, in which the fragments were first washed with water and then covered with [[gum arabic]] thinned with [[aqua regia]]. However, this practice was later stopped once it was discovered that it bleached and damaged the pigments, though most of the fragments at the Museo Archeologico Nazionale are still covered in the gluey film.&lt;ref name=:1/&gt;

Experiments with hot wax were conducted by the ancient Pompeian painters. Painters either prepared the surfaces with melted wax or painted with pigments combined with wax that would then be burned into the plaster, which made them sturdy and durable.&lt;ref name=:1 /&gt; This same technique was tried in order to restore the frescoes in the late eighteenth century. While at first this made the paintings more lustrous and clear, years of heat and humidity and the restriction of normal evaporation for the paintings ''in situ'' turned the wax white and deteriorated the painted surfaces.&lt;ref name=:1/&gt; In the Museo Archeologico Nazionale, though they didn’t suffer from the same climatological effects, they still became white/crusty.&lt;ref name=:1/&gt;

The pigments used in the frescoes are of a very fragile nature and have faded as a result of exposure to [[UV]] rays, oxygen, and the environment/elements—especially those left ''in situ''.&lt;ref name=:9/&gt; Disintegration of plaster, and lifting and detachment of the paint has also been caused by the crystallization of soluble salts, such as sodium nitrate, in the surface layers of the frescoes as a result of fluctuating temperatures and humidity, and exposure to atmospheric pollutants.&lt;ref name=:11/&gt;
 
=== Biological ===
Invasive vegetation such as roots, moss, weeds, and grass have sprouted from the cracks in the eroded floors and walls of the rooms where the frescoes are located.&lt;ref name=:3/&gt;

== Preventive conservation ==
Conservators and leadership are working to better understand the current situation of the Pompeian frescoes and avoid further damage and deterioration. The Soprintendenza Speciale per i Beni Archeologici di Napoli e Pompei is working on a major reorganization and implementation of new policies and maintenance plans for the entire site of Pompeii.&lt;ref name=:12/&gt;

Attention has been given to non-intrusive and reversible reinforcement of the walls, structures and roofs of the buildings that house the frescoes. Recommendations have been made for the reconstruction of the building infrastructures using safe and sturdy materials, and light, modern supports, unlike the previous heavy materials placed in the walls, which caused significant damage.&lt;ref name=:12/&gt; Recommendations have also been made for roof reinforcement structures and other conservation interventions that block ventilation and rain infiltration,&lt;ref name=:10/&gt; and allow for humidity regulation to prevent the plaster of the frescoes from peeling off the walls.&lt;ref name=:12/&gt; Plans for engineering new drainage and sewer systems are also being made.&lt;ref name=:10/&gt;

Excavations of Pompeii have been significantly reduced, and barricades, fences, and locked doors have been placed to keep visitors out of vulnerable areas and buildings.&lt;ref name=:9/&gt; Select ''insulae'' are also being considered for re-burial in order to protect them from further vegetal growth, weather conditions, earthquake damage, and volcanic eruptions.&lt;ref name=:12/&gt;

As an open, reactive system, frescoes require more surveillance after conservation&lt;ref name=:11/&gt; The use of high-tech monitoring tools is also being put into place. An agreement was made with Italian technology and defense company, [[Finmeccanica]], for their donation of services concerning: protection of the artistic heritage from deterioration, pollution, hydrogeological and seismic risks; efficiency, sustainability and safety of the spaces dedicated to culture; and accessibility and fruition of the artistic heritage.&lt;ref name=:10/&gt;

The project includes an [[interferometric]] monitoring service that provides data on the shifts/movements of the grounds and buildings in Pompeii, and comes equipped with radar sensors that shoot daytime and nighttime pictures. Finmeccanica has also provided a ground-based remote sensing service that employs hyper-spectral imaging devices for the acquisition of images and the spectral signatures of the various materials and chemical components present in areas identified as critical.&lt;ref name=:10/&gt;

== Current conservation treatment techniques and methods ==
Efforts are being made to stabilize the frescoes' chemical and biological degradation and perform long-lasting restoration. In a holistic approach to conservation, the causes of decay are being addressed while increasing the site’s ability to prevent or slow future decay. Routine cleaning of all previously restored works and constant upkeep practices are being put into place.&lt;ref name=:12/&gt;

Conservators and restorers are meticulously stripping away layers of [[Paraffin wax|paraffin]], dirt, and varnish with cotton swabs that restorers applied between the 1930s and 1970s to prevent the paints from cracking and flaking.&lt;ref name=:3/&gt; Laser tools are being used to melt away wax and gasoline buildup while leaving the paint untouched.&lt;ref name=:3/&gt; Other conservation treatments include the consolidation of brittle plaster and paint layers, the removal of inadequate [[inpainting]] of losses, and improving old fills that were used with cement.&lt;ref name=:5/&gt;

== The Great Pompeii Project (Grande Progetto Pompei) ==
The Great Pompeii Project (GPP) is a €105 million project funded by the EU and Italian Government that began in 2012.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5543">[[File:Blenheim_Plan.png|thumb|[[Blenheim Palace]]: The cour d'honneur is the large axial entrance court framed by the secondary wings containing kitchens and domestic offices flanking the ''[[corps de logis]]'']]
[[File:Vue aérienne du domaine de Versailles le 20 août 2014 par ToucanWings - Creative Commons By Sa 3.0 - 28.jpg|thumb|[[Louis Le Vau]] opened up the interior court of the [[Palace of Versailles|Château de Versailles]] to create the expansive entrance cour d'honneur, subsequently copied all over Europe.]]
'''Cour d'honneur''' ({{IPA-fr|kuʁ dɔnœʁ}}, court of honor) is the architectural term for a three-sided ceremonial [[courtyard]], created by flanking the main central block, or ''[[corps de logis]]'', with symmetrical advancing secondary wings containing minor rooms. The [[Palace of Versailles]] (''illustration'') and [[Blenheim Palace]] (''plan'') both feature such entrance courts.

Some 16th-century symmetrical Western European country houses built on U-shaped groundplans resulted in a sheltered central door in a main range that was embraced between projecting wings, but the formalized cour d'honneur is first found in the great [[palace]]s and [[mansion]]s of 17th-century Europe, where it forms the principal approach and ceremonial entrance to the building.  Its open courtyard is presented like the classical permanent theatre set of a proscenium stage, such as the built Roman set of opposed ''palazzi'' in a perspective street at [[Andrea Palladio|Palladio]]'s Teatro Olimpico (Vicenza, 1584). Like the theatre set the built environment is defined and enclosed from the more public space by ornate [[wrought iron]] [[gilded]] railings.  A later development replaced the railings with an open architectural columnar screen, as at [[Palais Royal]] (Paris), [[Schönbrunn Palace]] (Vienna), [[Alexander Palace]] (Saint Petersburg), or [[Henry Holland (architect)|Henry Holland]]'s [[Ionic order|Ionic screen]] formerly at [[Carlton House, London|Carlton House]], London (''illustrated below'').

[[File:Carltonhs.jpg|thumb|left|[[Henry Holland (architect)|Henry Holland]]'s Ionic screen fronts a shallow cour d'honneur at the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]]'s Carlton House in [[Pall Mall, London|Pall Mall]], London]]
Technically, the term cour d'honneur can be used of any large building whether public or residential, ancient or modern, which has a symmetrical courtyard set apart in this way, at which the honored visitor arrives. (The rest may arrive without flourish, through a side entrance.)

Examples of a cour d'honneur can be found in many of the most notable [[Baroque]] and classicizing buildings of Europe including the [[Palazzo Pitti]], one of the first 16th century residences to open a cour d'honneur—in the Pitti's case by embracing three sides of an existing public space. Other 16th century urban ''palazzi'' remained resolutely enclosed, like [[Palazzo Farnese]], Rome. In Rome, the wings of [[Carlo Maderno]]'s [[Palazzo Barberini]] design (1627), were the first that reached forward from a central block to create a cour d'honneur floorplan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/schools/annenberg/asc/projects/comm544/library/images/082.html|title=Barberini Palace (plan of first floor)|work=usc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Palbarberini.jpg|thumb|[[Palazzo Barberini]]: without railings the entrance court is still public space.]]

On a condensed, urban scale the formula is expressed in Parisian private houses, ''[[Hôtel particulier|hôtels particuliers]]'' built ''entre cour et jardin'' ({{IPA-fr|ɑ̃ːtʁ kuːʁ e ʒaʁdɛ̃|pron}}), between court and garden. In these plans, the street front may be expressed as a range of buildings not unlike the ordinary houses (''maisons'') that flank it, but with a grand, often arched, doorway, through which a carriage could pass into the cour d'honneur secreted behind. In a cramped site, one of the flanking walls of the cour d'honneur may be no more than an architectural screen, balancing the wing of the hôtel opposite it, which would often contain domestic offices and a stable.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Gallet ''Les Demeures parisiennes: l'époque de Louis XVI'', (Paris: Le Temps) 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; On a grander scale, the [[Palais Royal]] was laid out in just this manner, among the first Paris ''hôtels particuliers'' to have a cour d'honneur, which once was separated from the public street by a wrought iron grille, later by an open architectural screen, with its grand open ''jardin'' behind, now a public space. Nearby, the [[Tuileries Palace]] is gone: but the cour d'honneur with its [[Place du Carrousel#The Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel|Arc du Carrousel]] remains, as do the [[Tuileries Gardens]] behind the former palace's site.
[[File:Villard Exterior 118503pv.jpg|thumb|left|The Villard Houses facing [[Madison Avenue]], New York]]

In densely built cities disposed on a rigorously democratic grid plan such as [[New York City|New York]], private houses with a cour d'honneur were rare, even in the [[Gilded Age]]; the [[Villard Houses]] on Madison Avenue and the former [[William K. Vanderbilt House]] on the Plaza were the rare exceptions. In London, [[Burlington House]] retains its cour d'honneur, whereas the [[Buckingham Palace]]'s is no longer extant, as it was remodeled to be enclosed on all 4 sides, thus becoming (and now known as) a [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]].{{Clear}}

'''Crisis Management Initiative''' ('''CMI''') is an independent [[Finland|Finnish]] [[non-governmental organisation]] that works to prevent and [[conflict resolution|resolve conflict]] through informal dialogue and mediation. [[Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate and former [[President of Finland]] [[Martti Ahtisaari]] founded CMI in 2000. CMI has offices in [[Helsinki]] and [[Brussels]] as well as a presence in selected countries. The organisation is officially registered as '''Crisis Management Initiative ry'''.

==Function==
CMI states it is focused on contributing to peace processes in three regions: [[MENA|the Middle East and North Africa]], [[Eurasia]] and [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. Self-statedly, CMI facilitates dialogue, mediates between conflicting sides, provides capacity-building and mediation support at all stages of conflict management and peace processes, and supports the broader peace building community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ngo-monitor.org/ngos/crisis-management-initiative-cmi/|title=Crisis Management Initiative (CMI)|last=|first=|date=2017-01-23|work=Institute for NGO Research|access-date=2018-01-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180124070753/https://www.ngo-monitor.org/ngos/crisis-management-initiative-cmi/|archive-date=2018-01-24|dead-url=no|language=en-US|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Nobel Peace laureate and former President of Finland Martti Ahtisaari founded CMI on 24 August 2000.&lt;ref name="yhdistysnetti_cmi"&gt;{{Cite web | URL = http://yhdistysrekisteri.prh.fi/pertied.htx?kieli=3&amp;reknro=179786 | title = Crisis Management Initiative ry | work = AssociationNet | date = 2017-05-10 | location = Helsinki | publisher = Finnish Patent and Registration Office | accessdate = 2017-05-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After stepping down as the President of Finland that year, Ahtisaari declined the post of [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] because he wanted to focus instead on addressing the root causes of conflicts. President Ahtisaari's long-term vision with CMI was to  contribute to as much as effectively as possible to solving violent conflict throughout the world. The main tasks of the organisation in its early years were to assist Martti Ahtisaari in his numerous international assignments, to participate in policy discussions, and to advocate capacity-building in civilian crisis management.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

This led to CMI taking its own projects, at first concerning crisis management and later on expanding to peace building and conflict resolution projects. One of CMI's most visible assignments, the [[Aceh]] peace process began in late 2004. CMI and its chairman president Ahtisaari were asked to facilitate talks between the Government of Indonesia and the Free Aceh Movement (GAM). In 2008, President Ahtisaari was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for his leading role in bringing independence to Namibia, Serbia's withdrawal from Kosovo, and autonomy for Aceh.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

'''Cryptobiosis''' is a metabolic state of life entered by an [[organism]] in response to adverse environmental conditions such as [[desiccation]], [[freezing]], and [[oxygen]] [[Hypoxia (medical)|deficiency]]. In the cryptobiotic state, all measurable metabolic processes stop, preventing [[reproduction]], development, and repair. When environmental conditions return to being hospitable, the organism will return to its [[metabolism|metabolic]] state of life as it was prior to the cryptobiosis.

Anhydrobiosis is the most studied form of cryptobiosis and occurs in situations of extreme [[desiccation]]. The term ''anhydrobiosis'' derives from the Greek for "life without water" and is most commonly used for the desiccation tolerance observed in certain invertebrate animals such as [[Bdelloidea|bdelloid rotifers]], [[tardigrade]]s, [[brine shrimp]], [[nematode]]s, and at least one insect, a species of [[chironomid]] (''[[Polypedilum vanderplanki]]'').

Invertebrates undergoing anhydrobiosis often contract into a smaller shape and some proceed to form a [[sugar]] called [[trehalose]]. Desiccation tolerance in plants is associated with the production of another sugar, [[sucrose]]. These sugars are thought to protect the organism from desiccation damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; These are mainly defense mechanisms against [[reactive oxygen species]] and [[xenobiotics]], expression of [[heat shock proteins]] and [[intrinsically disordered proteins]] as well as biosynthesis of [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]]s and [[polyamines]]. Some of them are conserved among anhydrobiotic plants and animals, suggesting that anhydrobiotic ability may depend on a set of common mechanisms. Understanding these mechanisms in detail might enable modification of non-anhydrobiotic cells, tissues, organs or even organisms so that they can be preserved in a dried state of [[suspended animation]] over long time periods.

As of 2004, such an application of anhydrobiosis is being applied to [[vaccine]]s. In vaccines, the process can produce a '''dry vaccine''' that reactivates once it is injected into the body. In theory, dry-vaccine technology could be used on any vaccine, including live vaccines such as the one for measles. It could also potentially be adapted to allow a vaccine's slow release, eliminating the need for boosters. This proposes to eliminate the need for refrigerating vaccines, thus making dry vaccines more widely available throughout the developing world where refrigeration, electricity, and proper storage are less accessible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3754504.stm |work=BBC NEWS |title=High hopes for fridge-free jabs | date=2004-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anoxybiosis ===
{{More footnotes|section|date=October 2013}}
{{cleanup|reason=copyedit needed to shorten and simplify sentences|date=July 2017}}

In situations lacking [[oxygen]] (a.k.a., anoxia), many cryptobionts (such as ''M. tardigradum'') take in water and become turgid and immobile, but can still survive for prolonged periods of time just as with other cryptobiological processes. While survival rate studies of organisms during supposed anoxybiosis in anoxia have historically given some conflicting results, the current consensus is that certain ectothermic vertebrates and some invertebrates (for example, [[brine shrimp]] (Clegg et al. 1999), [[copepod]]s (Marcus et al., 1994), nematodes (Crowe and Cooper, 1971), and sponge [[gemmule]]s (Reiswig and Miller, 1998)) are capable of successfully surviving in a seemingly inactive state during anoxic conditions for periods of time ranging from months to decades. Studies of the metabolic activity of these idling organisms during anoxia have been mostly inconclusive, primarily due to the technical difficulty of measuring very small degrees of metabolic activity with enough reliability to conclusively prove a cryptobiotic state is occurring rather than just an extreme case of the metabolic rate depression (MRD) phenomenon exhibited by all aerobic organisms to some degree (typically 1-10% of aerobic levels) when exposed to anoxia. Thus, anoxybiosis is not considered a legitimate form of naturally occurring cryptobiosis by some comparative biologists because of these inconclusive and conflicting experimental results regarding whether a truly complete metabolic standstill actually occurs in cryptobionts during anoxic conditions, or if the metabolism is merely such a tiny fraction of the aerobic metabolic rate that it falls below the limits of detection. Also, many experts are skeptical of the biological feasibility of anoxybiosis, because any preservation of biological structures during anoxic conditions would imply that a seemingly impossible situation is occurring, wherein the organism is managing to prevent damage to its cellular structures from the environmental negative free energy despite being both surrounded by plenty of water and thermal energy and, most remarkably, it does so without using any free energy of its own. However (as summarized by Professor James Clegg of the UC Davis Bodega Marine laboratory in a 2001 review article), while many studies have failed to find measurable quantities of metabolic activity in potential anoxybiotic organisms, and there is also some evidence that the stress-induced protein p26 may act as a protein chaperone that requires no energy in cystic ''[[Brine shrimp|Artemia franciscana]]'' embryos, more recent data suggest that most likely an extremely specialized and slow guanine polynucleotide pathway continues to provide metabolic free energy to the ''Artemia franciscana'' embryos during anoxic conditions. Although it is inherently difficult to prove that not a single organism in existence anywhere is capable of entering a truly anoxybiotic state, it seems to clearly be the case that most likely at least ''A. franciscana'' (a.k.a. sea monkeys, a well-known and commonly studied cryptobiont) is only capable of approaching, but not reaching, the above-mentioned implied violation of the usual biological conversion of environmental negative free energy into the negative entropy of cellular structures via metabolic processes.

=== Chemobiosis ===

Chemobiosis is the cryptobiotic response to high levels of environmental toxins. It has been observed in [[tardigrades]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Møbjerg|first1=N.|last2=Halberg|first2=K. A.|last3=Jørgensen|first3=A.|last4=Persson|first4=D.|last5=Bjørn|first5=M.|last6=Ramløv|first6=H.|last7=Kristensen|first7=R. M.|title=Survival in extreme environments – on the current knowledge of adaptations in tardigrades|journal=Acta Physiologica|date=2011|volume=202|issue=3|pages=409–420|doi=10.1111/j.1748-1716.2011.02252.x|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kenneth_Halberg/publication/49770874_Survival_in_extreme_environments_-_on_the_current_knowledge_of_adaptations_in_tardigrades/links/02e7e5266519e3cb47000000.pdf?disableCoverPage=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cryobiosis ===

Cryobiosis is a form of cryptobiosis that takes place in reaction to decreased [[temperature]]. Cryobiosis initiates when the water surrounding the organism's cells has been frozen, stopping molecule mobility allows the organism to endure the freezing temperatures until more hospitable conditions return. Organisms capable of enduring these conditions typically feature molecules that facilitate freezing of water in preferential locations while also prohibiting the growth of large ice crystals that could otherwise damage cells.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} One such organism is the [[lobster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfgate.com/science/article/Frozen-Lobsters-Brought-Back-To-Life-2807663.php |title=Frozen Lobsters Brought Back to Life |date=18 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Osmobiosis ===

Osmobiosis is the least studied of all types of cryptobiosis. Osmobiosis occurs in response to increased [[solution|solute]] concentration in the solution the organism lives in. Little is known for certain, other than that osmobiosis appears to involve a cessation of metabolism.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Examples ==

A commonly known organism that undergoes cryptobiosis is ''Artemia salina'', also known as the [[brine shrimp]] or by its brand name, [[Sea-Monkeys]].  This species, which can be found in the [[Makgadikgadi Pans]] in [[Botswana]],&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan (2008) [http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=22373&amp;mode=&amp;order=0''Makgadikgadi'', The Megalithic Portal, ed. A. Burnham]&lt;/ref&gt; survives over the dry season when the water of the pans evaporates, leaving a virtually desiccated lake bed.

The [[tardigrade]], or water bear, is a widely studied and notable example,&lt;ref&gt;Illinois Wesleyan University&lt;/ref&gt; partially because it can undergo all five types of cryptobiosis. While in a cryptobiotic state, the tardigrade's [[metabolism]] reduces to less than 0.01% of what is normal, and its water content can drop to 1% of normal.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ross Piper|Piper, Ross]] (2007), ''Extraordinary Animals: An Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual Animals'', [[Greenwood Publishing Group|Greenwood Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; It can withstand extreme [[temperature]], [[radiation]], and [[pressure]] while in a cryptobiotic state.

Some [[nematode]]s and [[rotifer]]s can also undergo cryptobiosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Watanabe|first=Masahiko|title=Anhydrobiosis in invertebrates|journal=Appl. Entomol. Zool.|year=2006|volume=41|issue=1|pages=15–31|doi=10.1303/aez.2006.15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6905">'''Dataflow architecture''' is a [[computer architecture]] that directly contrasts the traditional [[von Neumann architecture]] or [[control flow architecture]]. Dataflow architectures do not have a [[program counter]], or (at least conceptually) the executability and execution of instructions is solely determined based on the availability of input arguments to the instructions, so that the order of instruction execution is unpredictable: i. e. behavior is indeterministic.  

Although no commercially successful general-purpose computer hardware has used a dataflow architecture, it has been successfully implemented in specialized hardware such as in [[digital signal processing]], [[network routing]], [[graphics processing]], [[telemetry]], and more recently in data warehousing.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} It is also very relevant in many software architectures today including [[database]] engine designs and [[parallel computing]] frameworks.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Synchronous dataflow architectures tune to match the workload presented by real-time data path applications such as wire speed packet forwarding. Dataflow architectures that are deterministic in nature enable programmers to manage complex tasks such as processor load balancing, synchronization and accesses to common resources.&lt;ref name="EN-Genius"&gt;[http://www.en-genius.net/site/zones/networkZONE/product_reviews/netp_061608 "HX300 Family of NPUs and Programmable Ethernet Switches to the Fiber Access Market", ''EN-Genius'', June 18 2008].&lt;/ref&gt; 

Meanwhile, there is a clash of terminology, since the term ''[[dataflow]]'' is used for a subarea of parallel programming: for [[dataflow programming]]. 

== History ==
Hardware architectures for dataflow was a major topic in [[computer architecture]] research in the 1970s and early 1980s. [[Jack Dennis]] of [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] pioneered the field of static dataflow architectures while the Manchester Dataflow Machine&lt;ref name="Manchester-Dataflow"&gt;[http://cnc.cs.manchester.ac.uk/projects/dataflow.html Manchester Dataflow Research Project, Research Reports: Abstracts, September 1997]&lt;/ref&gt; and MIT Tagged Token architecture were major projects in dynamic dataflow.

The research, however, never overcame the problems related to:

* Efficiently broadcasting data tokens in a massively parallel system.
* Efficiently dispatching instruction tokens in a massively parallel system.
* Building [[Content-addressable_memory | CAM]]s large enough to hold all of the dependencies of a real program.
Instructions and their data dependencies proved to be too fine-grained to be effectively distributed in a large network. That is, the time for the instructions and tagged results to travel through a large connection network was longer than the time to actually do the computations.  

Nonetheless, [[out-of-order execution]] (OOE) has become the dominant computing paradigm since the 1990s. It is a form of restricted dataflow. This paradigm introduced the idea of an ''execution window''. The ''execution window'' follows the sequential order of the von Neumann architecture, however within the window, instructions are allowed to be completed in data dependency order. This is accomplished in CPUs that dynamically tag the data dependencies of the code in the execution window. The logical complexity of dynamically keeping track of the data dependencies, restricts [[out-of-order execution|''OOE'']] [[CPU]]s to a small number of execution units (2-6) and limits the execution window sizes to the range of 32 to 200 instructions, much smaller than envisioned for full dataflow machines.

== Dataflow architecture topics ==
=== Static and dynamic dataflow machines ===
Designs that use conventional memory addresses as data dependency tags are called static dataflow machines. These machines did not allow multiple instances of the same routines to be executed simultaneously because the simple tags could not differentiate between them. 

Designs that use [[content-addressable memory]] (CAM) are called dynamic dataflow machines. They use tags in memory to facilitate parallelism.

=== Compiler ===
Normally, in the control flow architecture, [[compiler]]s analyze program [[source code]] for data dependencies between instructions in order to better organize the instruction sequences in the binary output files.  The instructions are organized sequentially but the dependency information itself is not recorded in the binaries. Binaries compiled for a dataflow machine contain this dependency information. 

A dataflow compiler records these dependencies by creating unique tags for each dependency instead of using variable names. By giving each dependency a unique tag, it allows the non-dependent code segments in the binary to be executed ''out of order'' and in parallel. Compiler detects the loops, break statements and various programming control syntax for data flow.

=== Programs ===
Programs are loaded into the CAM of a dynamic dataflow computer. When all of the tagged operands of an instruction become available (that is, output from previous instructions and/or user input), the instruction is marked as ready for execution by an [[execution unit]]. 

This is known as ''activating'' or ''firing'' the instruction. Once an instruction is completed by an execution unit, its output data is sent (with its tag) to the CAM. Any instructions that are dependent upon this particular datum (identified by its tag value) are then marked as ready for execution. In this way, subsequent instructions are executed in proper order, avoiding [[race condition]]s. This order may differ from the sequential order envisioned by the human programmer, the programmed order.

=== Instructions ===
An instruction, along with its required data operands, is transmitted to an execution unit as a packet, also called an ''instruction token''. Similarly, output data is transmitted back to the CAM as a ''data token''. The packetization of instructions and results allows for parallel execution of ready instructions on a large scale. 

Dataflow networks deliver the instruction tokens to the execution units and return the data tokens to the CAM. In contrast to the conventional [[von Neumann architecture]], data tokens are not permanently stored in memory, rather they are transient messages that only exist when in transit to the instruction storage.

The '''Department of Physics''' in Lund is a department that belongs to both the Faculty of Natural Sciences and the [[Faculty of Engineering (LTH), Lund University|Faculty of Engineering]] at [[Lund University]]. The main goals are to expand the understanding of physics, its applications and to share scientific progress to new generations. Research is conducted in most of the [[physics]] subdivisions. The department also offers courses and a [[Master's degree|Masters's degree programs]] in pure physics and provides physics education for the [[Master of Science in Engineering|Master of Science in Engineering programs]].

== History ==
In 1666 [[Lund University]] was founded without a faculty of science, so the physics research was conducted under the faculty of philosophy. In addition, during its first 150 years the University had no [[professor]]ship in pure physics, so the teachings was instead given by professors in [[mathematics]]. There were however a course in [[experimental physics]] from the early 18th century, but that course was given by a professor in theoretical medicine; [[Kilian Stobæus]] was appointed as the first professor in 1728.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fysik i Lund under 300 år|last=Litzén|first=Ulf|publisher=Lunds universitetshistoriska sällskap|year=2015|isbn=9789175453200|location=Lund|pages=13–19|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; It wasn't until the early 19th century that the physics professorship split from the mathematics, but then the professorship was shared with the [[astronomy]]. The University received its first full professor in physics in 1839.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fysik i Lund under 300 år|last=Litzén|first=|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=48|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a pure department of [[science]] was not established until the late 19th century, the seeds for the department was established in 1735 when the physics teaching received its own space in the building Kungshuset.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fysik i Lund under 300 år|last=Litzén|first=|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=31–32|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The teaching was held inside Kungshuset until the late 19th century, when the department moved to its own building which had instrumental halls, auditoriums, workshops and a library.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fysik i Lund under 300 år|last=Litzén|first=|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=61–62|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The department moved again in 1950 to a large building complex named ''Fysicum'' due to increased space requirements, and its been where since then.

== Research ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2202">The '''Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background''' (DSNB) is a theoretical population of [[neutrino]]s (and anti-neutrinos) originating from all of the supernovae events which have occurred throughout the Universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Beacom |first1=John F. |title=The Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background |journal=Annual Review of Nuclear and Particle Science |date=2010 |volume=60 |pages=439–462 |doi=10.1146/annurev.nucl.010909.083331 |arxiv=1004.3311 |bibcode=2010ARNPS..60..439B}}&lt;/ref&gt; An individual supernova will release as many as &lt;math&gt;10^{57}&lt;/math&gt; neutrinos, which is detectable as a short burst of events on Earth provided that the supernova occurred within our own galaxy or its [[satellite galaxy]], the only current example of which is [[SN1987A]]. In contrast the DSNB is a continuous source of neutrino events for which currently only experimental upper limits exist e.g. from the [[Super Kamiokande]] experiment at a level of &lt;math&gt;2.9 \bar{\nu_e} \, \mathrm{cm}^{-2} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; for neutrino energies above 17.3 MeV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zhang et al. |first1=H. |title=Supernova Relic Neutrino Search with Neutron Tagging at Super-Kamiokande-IV |journal=Astroparticle Physics |year=2015 |volume=60 |page=41 |doi=10.1016/j.astropartphys.2014.05.004 |arxiv=1311.3738 |bibcode=2015APh....60...41Z}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretical predictions for the flux of the DSNB on Earth are difficult as they depend on many different parameters and assumptions e.g. the rate of supernovae events in the Universe as a function of time, the star formation rate and the neutrino spectrum from each supernova.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mirizzi et al. |first1=A. |title=Supernova Neutrinos: Production, Oscillations and Detection |journal=Rivista del Nuovo Cimento |volume=39 |issue=1–2 |pages=1–112 |doi=10.1393/ncr/i2016-10120-8 |arxiv=1508.00785 |bibcode=2016NCimR..39....1M|year=2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However even given these uncertainties the DSNB flux should not be more than an order of magnitude below the current experimental bound, and so will be detectable in the near future.

'''Edith Halpert''' or '''Edith Gregor Halpert''' (née Edith Gregoryevna Fivoosiovitch) (1900–1970) was a pioneering [[New York City]] [[Art dealer|dealer]] of [[American modernism|American modern art]] and [[American Folk Art|American folk art]]. She brought recognition and market success to many [[avant-garde]] American artists. Her establishment, the Downtown Gallery, was the first commercial art space in [[Greenwich Village]]. When it was founded in 1926, it was the only New York gallery dedicated exclusively to contemporary American art by living artists. Over her forty-year career, Halpert showcased such modern art luminaries as [[Elie Nadelman]], [[Max Weber (artist)|Max Weber]], [[Marguerite Zorach|Marguerite]] and [[William Zorach]], [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]], [[Peggy Bacon]], [[Charles Sheeler]], [[Marsden Hartley]], [[Yasuo Kuniyoshi]], [[Ben Shahn]], [[Jack Levine]], [[William Steig]], [[Jacob Lawrence]], Walter Meigs, [[Arthur Dove]], [[John Marin]], [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], and many others. Halpert later expanded her business to include American folk art, and certain nineteenth-century American painters, including [[Raphaelle Peale]], [[William Harnett|William Michael Harnett]], and [[John F. Peto|John Frederick Peto]], whom she considered to be precursors to American modernism.&lt;ref name="pollack"&gt;Pollock, Lindsay, ''The Girl With the Gallery: Edith Gregor Halpert And the Making of the Modern Art Market'', PublicAffairs, 2006. {{ISBN|978-1-58648-302-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although she arrived in the U.S. as a Russian Jewish immigrant of modest means, Halpert transformed the landscape of American art, and died a multimillionaire at the age of 70. [[Sotheby's]] credits her with putting American modern art auctions on the map with the posthumous sale of her personal collection for $3.6 million in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Pollock, p. 383, 384.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldstein"&gt;Goldstein, Malcolm, ''Landscape with Figures: A History of Art Dealing in the United States'', Oxford University Press, 2000. {{ISBN|978-0-19-513673-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Halpert was born Edith Gregoryevna Fivoosiovitch to Gregor and Frances Lucom Fivoosiovitch in [[Odessa]] (then [[Russia]], now [[Ukraine]]) on April 25, 1900. She had a sister, Sonia, five years older. Shortly after the deadly [[Odessa pogroms#1905 Pogrom|pogroms of October 1905]], Edith emigrated to New York City in 1906 with her mother and sister (her father died in 1904 of [[tuberculosis]]).&lt;ref name="Lindsay. 2006"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/70668720|title=The girl with the gallery : Edith Gregor Halpert and the making of the modern art market|last=Lindsay.|first=Pollock,|date=2006|publisher=Public Affairs|isbn=9781586483029|edition= 1st|location=New York|oclc=70668720}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time the family name changed to Fivisovitch.&lt;ref name="AAAFA" /&gt; They initially settled on the west side of [[Harlem]], then a predominantly Jewish immigrant neighborhood, and Edith attended the progressive [[Wadleigh High School for Girls]].&lt;ref name="Lindsay. 2006"/&gt; At 14, she further Americanized her name to Edith Georgina Fein and began to pursue a career as an artist. She studied drawing under [[Leon Kroll]] and [[Ivan Olinsky]] at the [[National Academy of Design]] and life drawing with [[George Bridgman|George Bridgeman]] at the [[Art Students League of New York|Art Students League]].&lt;ref name="AAAFA" /&gt; She was also a member of the [[Whitney Museum of American Art#History|Whitney Studio Club]] and [[John Weischel]]'s [[People's Art Guild]], a radical artists' cooperative for which she served as treasurer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Archino|first=Sarah|date=2013-09-01|title=The People’s Art Guild and the Forward Exhibition of 1917|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/674925|journal=American Art|volume=27|issue=3|pages=14–19|doi=10.1086/674925|issn=1073-9300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917, she met the American painter [[Samuel Halpert]] through the People's Art Guild, and they married the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Samuel Halpert: Art and Life 1884-1930|last=Tepfer|first=Diane|publisher=Millenium Partners|year=2001|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pollack" /&gt; The couple remained in New York City, where Samuel continued to paint while Edith worked to support them. In 1925, they lived at the Maison Watteau in Montparnasse, then Paris's liveliest artist community. The following summer the Halperts stayed at the artist colony founded by [[Hamilton Easter Field]] in [[Ogunquit]], [[Maine]]. They rented a cottage from [[Robert Laurent]], and mingled with other American artists who were residing there that summer: [[Stefan Hirsch]], [[Bernard Karfiol]], [[Walt Kuhn]], [[Yasuo Kuniyoshi]], [[Katherine Schmidt]], [[Niles Spencer]], and [[Marguerite Zorach|Marguerite]] and [[William Zorach]], all of whom would later join her gallery.&lt;ref name="AAAFA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pollack" /&gt; Many of the artists in Ogunquit were interested in folk art and used it to decorate their homes and as inspiration in their work.

Samuel and Edith Halpert divorced in 1930, just before his untimely death caused by streptococci [[meningitis]].&lt;ref name="pollack" /&gt;

== Business career ==
In order to support herself and her mother (and later, her husband), Halpert took a number of jobs in rapid succession and became a highly successful businesswoman. At 16 she worked at [[Bloomingdale's]] department store, first as a [[comptometer]] operator and then as an illustrator in the advertising department. She then worked in the foreign office of [[Macy's]] before becoming an advertising manager at [[Stern Brothers]]. She then switched careers, working as an efficiency expert for the garment manufacturers Cohen-Goldman and Fishman &amp; Co. Between 1920 and 1925, Halpert served in a number of capacities with S.W. Straus &amp; Company, the bank investment firm that originated real-estate mortgage bonds. By the age of 25, she was earning a substantial salary and had been appointed to the board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/34642572|title=Money of the mind : borrowing and lending in America from the Civil War to Michael Milken|last=James.|first=Grant,|date=1994|publisher=Noonday Press|isbn=9780374524012|edition= 1st Noonday Press|location=New York|oclc=34642572}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AAAFA" /&gt; Despite her high status as one of the few leading female executives of her day, she quit her association with Straus at her husband's urging in 1925.&lt;ref name="pollack" /&gt; This left her with more time to devote to her marriage and gave her an opportunity to refocus her ambitions on the business of art.

==Opening The Downtown Gallery==
After a successful rise in the business world, Halpert used money from bonuses to open Our Gallery at 113 West 13th Street with her friend Berthe Kroll Goldsmith in November 1926. The gallery featured contemporary American art, often by friends of Halpert and her husband, artist [[Samuel Halpert]]. The following year, the name of the gallery changed to the '''Downtown Gallery''' (a suggestion of [[William Zorach]])&lt;ref name="AAAFA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aaa.si.edu/files/resources/finding-aids/pdf/downgall.pdf|title=A Finding Aid to the Downtown Gallery Records,1824-1974, bulk 1926-1969, in the Archives of American Art|last=Stover Gaines|first=Catherine|date=|website=|publisher=Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early brochures, Halpert and Goldsmith described their mission thus: "The Downtown Gallery has no prejudice for any one school. Its selection is driven by quality--by what is enduring--not by what is in vogue."&lt;ref name=AAAFA /&gt;

==The Downtown Gallery, American Folk Art Gallery, and The Daylight Gallery==
The [[American Folk Art Gallery]], founded by [[Holger Cahill]] in partnership with Halpert and Goldsmith, opened in 1929 as the first folk art gallery, moving in upstairs from the Downtown Gallery. The affinity between Halpert's artists and folk art was strong and sales of folk art sustained the Downtown Gallery through the Depression. ([[Abby Aldrich Rockefeller]] was a consistent buyer.) A third space opened in 1930, the Daylight Gallery, was run behind the main gallery and emphasized art and sculpture displayed in diffuse natural light.&lt;ref name=AAAFA /&gt;

==Fortifying The Downtown Gallery==
Halpert's business skills helped her manage prices to encourage buying by collectors of modest means. She also used marketing and advertising and worked to get her artists included in museums and public collections to increase their exposure. In an attempt to fortify the gallery, after buying out Goldsmith in 1935, Halpert winnowed her artist roster down to twelve and focused her efforts on profitability. In 1940, the gallery relocated to 43 East 51st Street and again to 32 East 51st Street in 1945.&lt;ref name=AAAFA /&gt;

As an advisor for the [[WPA Federal Art Project]], Halpert had access to many non-New York based artists, who she brought to her gallery. She also worked to attract artists formerly represented by [[Alfred Stieglitz]] who died in 1946. Additionally, she took on artist estates such as [[Arthur Dove]] (a former Stieglitz artist). All of these artists added after 1936 were eventually transferred, without the artists' consent, to the Alan Gallery, led by Halpert's assistant director Charles Alan. The Downtown Gallery relocated one last time to the Ritz Tower Concourse at 465 Park Avenue in 1965.&lt;ref name=AAAFA /&gt;

==Contributions to the art world==
Halpert served as organizer and director of the [[First Municipal Exhibition of American Art]], Atlantic City, New Jersey, in 1929. Her work with the [[WPA Federal Art Project]] took her to Washington D.C. in the summer of 1936 to develop the Exhibition and Allocation Program, which facilitated nationwide circulation for works from regional art centers. In 1937, she formed the Bureau for Architectural Sculpture and Murals, a central clearing-house from which architects could review and select work by artists and sculptors experienced in working in architectural settings (similar in mission to her Daylight Gallery). Halpert served as curator of the art section of the American National Exhibition, sponsored by the [[United States Information Agency]] and the [[U.S. Department of Commerce]]; she traveled to the Soviet Union with the exhibition, installed the show, and gave daily gallery talks in Russian.

In 1952, to promote art history, Halpert established the Edith Gregor Halpert Foundation. Its activities included assisting universities to fund scholarships for the study of contemporary American art and championing the rights of artists to control the sale and reproduction of their work. In recognition of her dedication to the arts, Halpert received the Art in America Award in 1959, a [[USIA]] Citation for Distinguished Service in 1960, and the First Annual International Silver Prize from the [[University of Connecticut]] for "distinguished contribution to the arts" in 1968.&lt;ref name=AAAFA /&gt;

Halpert was an avid collector. Exhibitions drawn from her collection include: ''American Modernism: The First Wave, Painting from 1903-1933'', presented at [[Brandeis University]] Museum of Art, 1963; ''Six Decades of American Art'', shown at [[Leicester Galleries]], London, 1965; ''Image to Abstraction'', held at [[Amon Carter Museum]], 1967; and ''Edith Halpert and the Downtown Gallery'', exhibited at the [[University of Connecticut]], 1968. The Edith Gregor Halpert Collection was eventually sold at auction by Sotheby Parke-Bernet, 1973.&lt;ref name=AAAFA /&gt;

The term '''fundamental station''' is used for special observatories which combine several [[space]] positioning techniques like [[VLBI]], [[satellite laser ranging]], [[GPS]], [[Glonass]], etc. They are the basis of [[plate tectonic]] analysis, allowing the monitoring of [[continental drift]] rates with milimetre accuracies. A '''fundamental point''' is the geometric origin of a [[geodetic network]] and defines the [[datum (geodesy)|geodetic datum]] of a [[national survey]].

Some fundamental stations are an astronomical or satellite geodetic [[observatory]]. In any case, the [[geographic latitude]] and [[longitude]] of the station is precisely determined by methods of [[astrogeodesy]] and is chosen as [[ellipsoid]]al latitude and longitude at the [[Earth ellipsoid]] which is used to calculate the coordinates of the whole network.

Also, precise [[azimuth]]s to one or two network points are observed, and are taken over as orientated [[Direction (geometry)|directions]] of these network lines. By these procedure, the polar axis of the reference ellipsoid becomes parallel to the [[Earth rotation]] axis, and therefore the [[vertical deflection]] of the fundamental point is zero.

Important fundamental stations in Europe are located in:

* [[Grasse]], central France
* [[Graz]]-Lustbühel, Austria
* [[Malvern, Worcestershire|Malvern]], England (?{{clarify|date=April 2017}})
* [[Onsala Space Observatory]] (large [[radio telescope]]), Sweden
* [[Wettzell]] (20{{nbsp}}m radio telescope) in the Bayerischer Wald, Germany
* [[Zimmerwald]] near Berne, Switzerland.

Worldwide about 30 fundamental stations are in existence: about 5 in the United States and in [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] countries, and 2–3 in South America, Africa, Eastern Asia, Australia and Antarctica.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

The basic [[coordinate system]] is the [[International Terrestrial Reference System|ITRF]] reference frame, which is related to the [[International Celestial Reference System|ICRS]] celestial [[inertial system]] by means of very precise [[Earth Orientation Parameters]] (EOPs), containing [[polar coordinate]]s, [[Earth rotation]] and [[nutation]]  parameters. The ITRF data set is revised every 3–5 years, the actual accuracy is in the millimeter area. The ICRS is based on about 500 [[quasar]]s in the far universe, and on some 3000 [[fundamental star]]s of our [[galaxy]]. The actual coordinates of the latter ([[FK6]]) were published in 2000 by the [[Astronomisches Rechen-Institut]] (ARI) in [[Heidelberg]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4521">'''Johannes Gijsbrecht Kuenen''' (born 9 December 1940, [[Heemstede]]) is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[microbiologist]] who is [[professor emeritus]] at the [[Delft University of Technology]] and a visiting scientist at the [[University of Southern California]]. His research is influenced by, and a contribution to, the scientific tradition of the Delft School of Microbiology.

Kuenen studied at the [[University of Groningen]], where he received both his [[Doctorandus]] degree and in 1972 his Doctorate (PhD) under the supervision of Professor Dr. Hans Veldkamp. The title of his thesis was ‘‘Colourless sulphur bacteria from Dutch tidal mudflats’’. After a short post-doc at the [[University of California in Los Angeles]] (USA), he returned as a senior lecturer to Groningen. In 1980, he moved to [[Delft]] to become the 4th Professor of Microbiology (succeeding M.W. Beijerinck and A.J. Kluyver) at Delft University of Technology. Kuenen's initial research interests were (the application of) bacteria involved in the natural [[sulfur cycle]] and [[yeast]] physiology and metabolism. His later interest in the (eco)physiology of nitrifying and [[denitrifying]] bacteria has led a.o. to the discovery of the bacteria within the phylum  [[planctomycetes]] that perform the [[Anammox]] process. In addition, his research has been focussed on (halo) alkaliphilic [[sulfur-oxidizing bacteria]] from soda lakes. Gijs Kuenen retired in 2005 but remains active in science.

== Awards ==
In 2004 Gijs Kuenen became a Knight in the [[Order of the Netherlands Lion]], In 2005 he was elected  Fellow of the [[American Academy of Microbiology]]. In 2006 he received the Jim Tiedje Award for his outstanding contribution to microbial ecology at the 11th International Symposium on Microbial Ecology in Vienna and in 2007 he was awarded the Procter &amp; Gamble Award in Applied and Environmental Microbiology.

For his contribution to the founding of the education [[Life Science and Technology]] ([[Delft University of Technology]] and [[Leiden University]]) in 2005 he received an honorary membership of [[Study Association LIFE]].

==Named after Kuenen==
One of the five known anammox genera, with the single member [[Kuenenia stuttgartiensis]], has been named after Kuenen. The Kuenen lab had named the first discovered species [[Brocadia anammoxidans]], after the company Gist-Brocades (now [[DSM Gist]]), for which Kuenen did consulting work and in which wastewater the bacteria was discovered.

The '''Group of Seven''', also sometimes known as '''the Algonquin School''', was a group of Canadian landscape painters from 1920 to 1933, originally consisting of [[Franklin Carmichael]] (1890–1945), [[Lawren Harris]] (1885–1970), [[A.&amp;nbsp;Y. Jackson]] (1882–1974), [[Frank Johnston (artist)|Frank Johnston]] (1888–1949), [[Arthur Lismer]] (1885–1969), [[J.&amp;nbsp;E.&amp;nbsp;H. MacDonald]] (1873–1932), and [[Frederick Varley]] (1881–1969). Later, [[A.&amp;nbsp;J. Casson]] (1898–1992) was invited to join in 1926, [[Edwin Holgate]] (1892–1977) became a member in 1930, and [[LeMoine FitzGerald]] (1890–1956) joined in 1932.

Two artists commonly associated with the group are [[Tom Thomson]] (1877–1917) and [[Emily Carr]] (1871–1945). Although he died before its official formation, Thomson had a significant influence on the group.  In his essay "The Story of the Group of Seven", Harris wrote that Thomson was "a part of the movement before we pinned a label on it"; Thomson's paintings ''[[The West Wind (painting)|The West Wind]]'' and ''[[The Jack Pine]]'' are two of the group's most iconic pieces.&lt;ref name="Silcox"&gt;{{Citation|last=Silcox|first=David|title=The Group of Seven and Tom Thomson|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rm5yQgAACAAJ&amp;dq=silcox+the+group+of+seven+and+tom+thomson|publisher=Firefly Books, 2003|accessdate=19 October 2011|isbn=9781552976050|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emily Carr]] was also closely associated with the Group of Seven, though never an official member.

Believing that a distinct Canadian art could be developed through direct contact with nature,&lt;ref name='Housser'&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Housser | first1 = F. B. | title = A Canadian Art Movement | year = 1926 | location = Toronto, Ontario | page = 24}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Group of Seven is best known for its paintings inspired by the Canadian landscape, and initiated the first major Canadian national art movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Chilvers, Ian|first=Glaves-Smith, John|title=Group of Seven|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t5.e1084|work=A Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=18 October 2011|postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Group was succeeded by the [[Canadian Group of Painters]] in 1933, which included members from the [[Beaver Hall Group]] who had a history of showing with the Group of Seven internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meadowcroft|first1=Barbara|title=Painting friends: the Beaver Hall women painters|date=1999|publisher=Véhicule Press|location=Montreal, Quebec, Canada|isbn=1-55065-125-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Harris, Lawren;|first=Murray, Joan|title=The Best of the Group of Seven|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O96YPpkHUGEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the+best+of+the+group+of+seven+joan+murray#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher=McClelland &amp; Stewart, 1993|accessdate=19 October 2011|isbn=9780771066740|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections==
Large collections of work from the Group of Seven can be found at the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]] in Toronto, the [[National Gallery of Canada]] in Ottawa as well as the [[Ottawa Art Gallery]] (home to The [[Firestone Collection of Canadian Art]]) and the [[McMichael Canadian Art Collection]] in [[Kleinburg, Ontario]]. The National Gallery, under the directorship of Eric Brown, was an early institutional supporter of artists associated with the Group, purchasing art from some of their early exhibitions before they had identified themselves officially as the Group of Seven.&lt;ref name="Varley"&gt;{{Citation|last=Varley|first=Christopher|title=Group of Seven|url=http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0003476|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|publisher=Historica Foundation|accessdate=18 October 2011|postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Art Gallery of Ontario, in its earlier incarnation as the Art Gallery of Toronto, was the site of their first exhibition as the Group of Seven.&lt;ref name="Silcox"/&gt; The McMichael gallery was founded by Robert and Signe McMichael, who began collecting paintings by the Group of Seven and their contemporaries in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/artdesign/story/2007/07/05/mcmichael-signe-obit.html |title=McMichael gallery co-founder dies |publisher=CBC Arts |date=5 July 2007 |accessdate=2014-03-24 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113134551/http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/artdesign/story/2007/07/05/mcmichael-signe-obit.html |archivedate=13 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Red Maple (A. Y. Jackson).jpg|right|thumb|''Red Maple'', 1914, by [[A. Y. Jackson]], [[National Gallery of Canada]], [[Ottawa]]]]
Tom Thomson, J. E. H. MacDonald, Arthur Lismer, Frederick Varley, Frank Johnston and Franklin Carmichael met as employees of the [[design firm]] [[Grip Ltd.]] in Toronto. In 1913, they were joined by A. Y. (Alexander Young) Jackson and Lawren Harris. They often met at [[the Arts and Letters Club of Toronto]] to discuss their opinions and share their art.&lt;ref name="Silcox"/&gt;

This group received monetary support from Harris (heir to the Massey-Harris farm machinery fortune) and Dr. [[James MacCallum]]. Harris and MacCallum jointly built the [[Studio Building (Toronto)|Studio Building]] in 1914 in the Rosedale ravine to serve as a meeting and working place for the new Canadian art movement. MacCallum owned land on [[Georgian Bay]] and Thomson worked as a guide in nearby [[Algonquin Park]], both places where he and the other artists often travelled for inspiration.&lt;ref name="Hill"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hill|first=Charles C.|title=Group of Seven|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t148.e692|work=The Oxford Companion to Canadian History|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Frederick Varley - Gas Chamber at Seaford.jpg|thumb|left|''Gas Chamber at Seaford'', 1918, by [[Frederick Varley]], [[Canadian War Museum]], Ottawa]]
The informal group was temporarily split up during [[World War I]], during which Jackson&lt;ref name="brandon46"&gt;Brandon, Laura. (2008). {{Google books|kwg9g5vc4jUC|''Art and War,'' p. 46.|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Varley&lt;ref name="davis30"&gt;Davis, Ann. (1992). {{Google books|_9DmKQ3cACoC|''The Logic of Ecstasy: Canadian Mystical Painting, 1920–1940'', p. 30.|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; became official war artists. Jackson enlisted in June 1915 and served in France from November 1915 to 1917, at which point he was seriously injured.&lt;ref name="Mellen 70"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mellen|first1=Peter|title=The Group of Seven.|date=1970|publisher=McClelland and Stewart|location=Toronto|isbn=978-0771058158|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris enlisted in 1916 and taught [[Musket|musketry]] at [[CFB Borden|Camp Borden]].&lt;ref name="Roza"&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Roza|first=Alexandra M.|date=1997|title=Towards a Modern Canadian Art 1910-1936: The Group of Seven, A.J.M.

He appeared to have suffered a blow to the head and showed no signs of drowning. The circumstances of his death remain mysterious.&lt;ref name="Silcox"/&gt;

The seven who formed the original group reunited after the war. They continued to travel throughout [[Ontario]], especially the [[Muskoka District Municipality, Ontario|Muskoka]] and [[Algoma District, Ontario|Algoma]] regions, sketching the landscape and developing techniques to represent it in art. In 1919, they decided to make themselves into a group devoted to a distinct Canadian form of art which didn't exist yet, and began to call themselves the Group of Seven.&lt;ref name="Hill"/&gt; It is unknown who specifically chose these seven men, but it is believed to have been Harris.&lt;ref name='Silcox Pg 17'&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Silcox | first1 = David P. | title = The Group of Seven and Tom Thomson | chapter = Introduction | publisher = Firefly Books Ltd. | year = 2003 | location = Toronto, Ontario | page = 17 | isbn = 1-55297-605-X | quote = Someone decided whom to invite to that historic meeting, and probably Harris, or Harris after conferring with MacDonald, was responsible.}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1920, they were ready for their first exhibition thanks to the constant support and encouragement of Eric Brown, the director of the National Gallery at that time. Prior to this, many artists{{who?|date=May 2016}} believed the Canadian landscape was not worthy of being painted.  Reviews for the 1920 exhibition were mixed,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|last=Varley|first=Christopher|title=Group of Seven|url=http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0003476|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|publisher=Historica Foundation|accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but as the decade progressed the Group came to be recognized as pioneers of a new, Canadian, [[Art school|school of art]].

After Frank Johnston left the group in 1920 to move to Winnipeg, [[A. J. Casson]] was invited to join in 1926.&lt;ref name="Hill"/&gt; Franklin Carmichael had taken a liking to him and had encouraged Casson to sketch and paint for many years beforehand.

[[File:The Jack Pine, by Tom Thomson.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Jack Pine (painting)|The Jack Pine]]'', 1916–17, by [[Tom Thomson]], National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa]]
The Group's champions during its early years included [[Barker Fairley]], a co-founder of ''Canadian Forum magazine'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Symington|first=Rodney|title=Fairley, Barker|url=http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0002703|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|publisher=Historica Foundation|accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the warden of [[Hart House (University of Toronto)|Hart House]] at the [[University of Toronto]], J. Burgon Bickersteth.

The members of the Group began to travel elsewhere in Canada for inspiration, including [[British Columbia]], [[Quebec]], [[Nova Scotia]], and the [[Arctic]]. After [[Samuel Gurney Cresswell]] and other painters on Royal Navy expeditions, these were the first artists of European descent who depicted the Arctic. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} Soon, the Group made the decision that to be called a "national school of painters" there should be members from outside Toronto. As a result, in 1930 [[Edwin Holgate]] from Montreal, Quebec became a member, followed by [[LeMoine FitzGerald]] from Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1932.&lt;ref name="Varley"/&gt;

The Group's influence was so widespread by the end of 1931, and after J. E. H. MacDonald's death in 1932, they no longer found it necessary to continue as a group of painters. They announced that the Group had been disbanded and that a new association of painters would be formed, known as the Canadian Group of Painters. The Canadian Group—which eventually consisted of the majority of Canada's leading artists—held its first exhibition in 1933, and continued to hold exhibitions almost every year as a successful society until 1967.

==Legacy==
In 1995, the [[National Gallery of Canada]] compiled a Group of Seven retrospective show, for which they commissioned the Canadian rock band [[Rheostatics]] to write a [[Sheet music|musical score]]. That score was released on album as ''[[Music Inspired by the Group of Seven]]''.

Contemporary painter Rae Johnson has derived much of her style from the Group of Seven.&lt;ref name="HellerHeller2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jules Heller|author2=Nancy G. Heller|title=North American Women Artists of the Twentieth Century: A Biographical Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AYxmAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR11|date=19 December 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-63882-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Group of Seven has received criticism for its reinforcement of [[terra nullius]] presenting the region as pristine and untouched by humans when in fact the areas depicted have been lived in for many centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Mitchell|first=Thomas W.J.|title=Landscape and Power|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8E3yVlUUK9AC|publisher=University of Chicago Press, 2002|accessdate=19 October 2011|isbn=9780226532059|date=15 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sentiment was expressed by Jackson, who in his 1958 autobiography wrote,

{{quote|After painting in Europe where everything was mellowed by time and human associations, I found it a problem to paint a country in outward appearance pretty much as it had been when [[Samuel de Champlain|Champlain]] passed through its thousands of rock islands three hundred years before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jackson|first1=A.Y.|title=A Painter's Country|date=1958|publisher=Clarke Irwin|location=Toronto|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Recognition==
On 18 September 1970 Canada Post issued 'The Group of Seven', designed by [[Allan Fleming|Allan Robb Fleming]] and based on a painting, "Isles of Spruce" (1922), by Arthur Lismer and held in the Hart House Permanent Collection, University of Toronto. The 6¢ stamps are [[perforated 11]], and were printed by [[Ashton-Potter Limited]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data4.collectionscanada.gc.ca/netacgi/nph-brs?s1=(artist.A790,C790.)+Or+(null.B742.)&amp;l=50&amp;d=STMP&amp;p=1&amp;u=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/archivianet/02011702_e.html&amp;r=27&amp;f=G&amp;Sect1=STMP |title=Canada Post stamp |publisher=Data4.collectionscanada.gc.ca |date=18 September 1970 |accessdate=2014-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 June 1995, Canada Post issued 10 stamps, each based on a painting of a member of the group (7 original members and 3 additional members):

[[Image:201 Penelope light curve.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Light curve of the asteroid [[201 Penelope]] based on images taken on 6 October 2006 at [[Mount John University Observatory]]. Shows just over one full [[rotation period|rotation]], which lasts 3.7474 hours.]]

In [[astronomy]], a '''light curve''' is a graph of light intensity of a [[celestial object]] or region, as a function of time. The light is usually in a particular frequency interval or [[Frequency band|band]]. Light curves can be periodic, as in the case of [[eclipsing binary|eclipsing binaries]], [[Cepheid variable]]s, other periodic variables, and [[Methods of detecting extrasolar planets#Transit photometry|transiting]] [[extrasolar planets]], or [[aperiodic]], like the light curve of a [[nova]], a [[cataclysmic variable star]], a [[supernova]] or a [[Gravitational microlensing|microlensing event]] or binary as observed during [[occultation]] events. The study of the light curve, together with other observations, can yield considerable information about the physical process that produces it or constrain the physical theories about it.

== Variable stars ==
{{main|Variable star}}
[[File:Delta Cephei lightcurve.jpg|thumb|left|Light curve of [[δ Cephei]] showing [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] versus pulsation [[phase (waves)|phase]]]]

Graphs of the [[apparent magnitude]] of a variable star over time are commonly used to visualise and analyse their behaviour. Although the categorisation of variable star types is increasingly done from their spectral properties, the amplitudes, periods, and regularity of their brightness changes are still important factors. Some types such as [[Cepheid variable|Cepheids]] have extremely regular light curves with exactly the same period, amplitude, and shape in each cycle. Others such as [[Mira variable]]s have somewhat less regular light curves with large amplitudes of several magnitudes, while the [[semiregular variable]]s are less regular still and have smaller amplitudes.&lt;ref name=gcvs/&gt;

The shapes of variable star light curves give valuable information about the underlying physical processes producing the brightness changes. For eclipsing variables, the shape of the light curve indicates the degree of totality, the relative sizes of the stars, and their relative surface brightnesses.&lt;ref name=russell/&gt; It may also show the [[Eccentricity (astronomy)|eccentricity]] of the orbit and [[Ellipsoidal variable|distortions in the shape]] of the two stars.&lt;ref name=kron/&gt;  For pulsating stars, the amplitude or period of the pulsations can be related to the luminosity of the star, and the light curve shape can be an indicator of the pulsation mode.&lt;ref name=wood/&gt;

=== Supernovae ===
{{main|Supernova}}
[[File:Comparative supernova type light curves.png|thumb|left|Comparative [[supernova]] type light curves]]

Light curves from [[supernova]]e can be indicative of the type of supernova. Although supernova types are defined on the basis of their spectra, each has typical light curve shapes. [[Type I supernova]]e have light curves with a sharp [[Maxima and minima|maximum]] and gradually decline, while [[Type II supernova]]e have less sharp maxima. Light curves are helpful for classification of faint supernovae and for the determination of sub-types. For example, the type II-P (for plateau) have similar spectra to the type II-L (linear) but are distinguished by a light curve where the decline flattens out for several weeks or months before resuming its fade.&lt;ref name=hyperphysics/&gt;

== {{anchor|Planetology}} Planetary astronomy ==
{{main|Planetary science}}

In [[planetary science]], a light curve can be used to derive the [[rotation period]] of a [[minor planet]], [[natural satellite|moon]], or [[comet]] nucleus. From the [[Earth]] there is often no way to resolve a small object in the [[Solar System]], even in the most powerful of [[telescope]]s, since the apparent angular size of the object is smaller than one pixel in the detector. Thus, astronomers measure the amount of light produced by an object as a function of time (the light curve). The time separation of peaks in the light curve gives an estimate of the rotational period of the object. The difference between the maximum and minimum brightnesses (the [[amplitude]] of the light curve) can be due to the shape of the object, or to bright and dark areas on its surface. For example, an asymmetrical asteroid's light curve generally has more pronounced peaks, while a more spherical object's light curve will be flatter.&lt;ref name="lc"/&gt; This allows astronomers to infer information about the shape and spin (but not size) of asteroids.

=== Asteroid lightcurve database ===

==== {{anchor|LCDB quality code}} Light curve quality code ====

The ''Asteroid Lightcurve Database'' (LCDB) of the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link (CALL) uses a numeric code to assess the quality of a period solution for minor planet light curves (it does not necessarily assess the actual underlying data). Its quality code parameter "U" ranges from 0 (incorrect) to 3 (well-defined):&lt;ref name="LCDB"/&gt;
* ''U = 0'' → Result later proven incorrect
* ''U = 1'' → Result based on fragmentary light curve(s), may be completely wrong.
* ''U = 2'' → Result based on less than full coverage. Period may be wrong by 30 percent or ambiguous. 
* ''U = 3'' → Secure result within the precision given. No ambiguity.
* ''U = n.a.'' → Not available. Incomplete or inconclusive result.

A trailing plus sign (+) or minus sign (-) is also used to indicate a slightly better or worse quality than the unsigned value.&lt;ref name="LCDB" /&gt;

=== Occultation light curves ===
{{Further|Occultation#Occultations by minor planets}}
[[File:LightCurve AsteroidOccultation.png|thumb|Light Curve of the asteroid 1247 Dysona occulting 4UCAC 174-171272, showing instantaneous disappearance and reappearance. Duration is 6.48 seconds.]]

The [[Asteroid occultation|occultation]] light curve is often characterised as binary, where the light from the star is terminated instantaneously, remains constant for the duration, and is reinstated instantaneously. The duration is equivalent to the length of a [[Chord (astronomy)|chord]] across the occulting body.

Circumstances where the transitions are not instantaneous are;
* when either the occulting or occulted body are double , e.g. a [[double star]] or [[Binary asteroid|double asteroid]], then a step light curve is observed.

== Light curve inversion ==
Light curve inversion is a mathematical technique used to model the surfaces of rotating objects from their brightness variations. This can be used to effectively image [[starspot]]s or asteroid surface [[albedo]]s.&lt;ref name=harmon/&gt;&lt;ref name=roettenbacher/&gt;

== Microlensing ==
{{main|Gravitational microlensing}}

Microlensing is a process where relatively small and low-mass astronomical objects cause a brief small increase in the brightness of a more distant object. This is caused by the small [[general relativity|relativistic effect]] as larger [[gravitational lens]]es, but allows the detection and analysis of otherwise-invisible stellar and planetary mass objects. The properties of these objects can be inferred from the shape of the lensing light curve. For example, [[PA-99-N2]] is a microlensing event that may have been due to a star in the [[Andromeda galaxy]] that has an [[exoplanet]].&lt;ref name=haugan/&gt;

The '''Macchina of Santa Rosa''' is a 30 metre high tower, which is rebuilt every year in the months of July and August in honor of [[Rose of Viterbo|Saint Rose of Viterbo]], the patron saint of the city of [[Viterbo]], Italy. Every year on the evening of 3 September 100 men called "Facchini di Santa Rosa" (porters of Saint Rose) hoist the Macchina and carry it through the very narrow streets and squares of the medieval town centre. The whole route is a little bit more than {{convert|1|km|0|abbr=on}}.

The procession is an important event in Viterbo and attracts thousands of people. Today, the procession is included in the [[UNESCO]] Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.&lt;ref name=portale&gt;
[https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=it&amp;u=http://www.infoviterbo.it/macchina-di-santa-rosa.html&amp;prev=search "The Machine of Santa Rosa", il Portale del Turismo a Viterbo e Provincia]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The celebration consists of two distinct parts. On the afternoon of 2 September, a reliquary containing the heart of Santa Rosa is carried in procession accompanied by people in period costumes of the 14th through the 19th centuries. The transport of Machine of Santa Rosa takes place the following evening. The term "machine" is borrowed from classical Greek theater.&lt;ref name=sodality&gt;[https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=it&amp;u=http://www.facchinidisantarosa.it/&amp;prev=search Sodalizio Dei Facchini]&lt;/ref&gt;

The transport of the Macchina dates back to the transfer of the body of Saint Rose of Viterbo. In 1258, six years after her death, her body was moved at the wish of [[Pope Alexander IV]], from the former church Santa Maria del Poggio to the church Santa Maria delle Rose (today the pilgrimage chapel of Saint Rose). It is possible that originally a statue of St. Rose lit on a canopy was carried in procession.&lt;ref name=city&gt;[https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=it&amp;u=http://www.macchinasantarosa.it/&amp;prev=search "Trasporto della Macchina di Santa Rosa", City of Viterbo]&lt;/ref&gt; Guilds were very active in the processions in the 14th century. From 1654 through 1663 the procession was suspended due to the plague.

The first "machine" was probably designed by Count Sebastian Gregory Fani in 1686. The Civic Museum of Viterbo has a collection of sketches of the machine dating to 1690.&lt;ref name=city/&gt; In the 18th century the noble families of Viterbo sponsored lavish machines of Saint Rose.

In 1790 the machine fell during the move. In 1801 the cries of a spectator robbed of her jewels by some pickpockets in the Piazza Fontana Grande panicked some cavalry horses. Twenty-two people in the crowd died in the ensuing confusion and later that night the machine caught fire in Piazza delle Erbe. Because of these events, the transport was temporarily banned by [[Pope Pius VII]], only to resume around 1810. In 1814 tilted backwards and a few porters died.&lt;ref name=city/&gt;

In 1893 pouring rain prevented the transport, which proved fortunate when it was later discovered that some anarchists were planning to throw bombs at the machine. The transport was suspended with the outbreak of World War I, but resumed in 1918.&lt;ref name=mauro&gt;[https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=it&amp;u=http://www.cesarini.eu/santa%2520rosa.htm&amp;prev=search Galeotti, Mauro. "La Machina di Santa Rosa"]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1924 to 1951 (except for the interruption caused by the Second World War) the Machine of Santa Rosa was designed and constructed by Virgilio Papini, whose family had a long history of building the machines. In 1967 a new design did not get farther than the end of Via Cavour due to either excessive weight, or height, or tired Facchini.&lt;ref name=sodality/&gt;

On the occasion of the arrival of the pontifex [[John Paul II]], on 27 May 1984 there was organized a special transport.&lt;ref name=mauro/&gt; On 6 September 2009, Pope [[Benedict XVI]] viewed the new Macchina of Santa Rosa Fiore del Cielo in front of the pilgrimage chapel.

In April 2014 the "Flower of Heaven" was erected at the Milan Expo; the new tower for 2015 is called "Gloria".&lt;ref&gt;[https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=it&amp;u=http://milano.corriere.it/notizie/cronaca/15_aprile_17/expo-milano-arriva-macchina-santa-rosa-e8a509b8-e4ee-11e4-845e-5bcd794907be.shtml&amp;prev=search "The machinery of Santa Rosa comes to Milan Expo", ''Chronicle'' (Milan), 17 April 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
Until a few decades ago, the Machine of Santa Rosa was built with paper mache and mounted on a wooden frame.  Today, that system has been abandoned and replaced with various materials, such as resin, plastic and glass fiber, supported by a framework of steel pipes.

Every five years a design competition is launched for a new Macchina. 
The guidelines of the competition ask for a 28m high tower, which is measured from the shoulder of the porters. The construction's maximum weight is to be less than 5 tonnes and the maximum width 4.3 metres.
This is to respect the narrow parts of the historical centre, where eaves and balconies could strike the Macchina during transportation.

The appearance of the Macchina has changed throughout history. 
The altar-like constructions from the 18th century developed to constructions similar to church towers and in the 2nd half of the 20th century they developed to 30m high sculptural towers.
While originally the towers were mainly made from [[papier mâché]], today materials like steel, [[aluminium]] and [[fibre glass]] are used to achieve a light and fireproof construction.

The current model (since 2009) is called "Fiore del Cielo" (ital. Flower of Heaven).&lt;ref name=portale/&gt; It was designed by the architecture office [[Architecture and Vision]] (architects: [[Arturo Vittori]] and [[Andreas Vogler]]).
The design is characterized by the three golden helix surfaces which grow upwards.
In contrast to the former Macchina many innovations were introduced. Some of these are the golden color scheme and more than 1200 computer-controlled [[LED]] lights, which are illuminating the handmade textile roses. A special scenography was developed, which also includes a rain of rose petals on the spectators at a certain stop.

==Facchini==
The Sodality Facchini of Santa Rosa was founded in 1978 to keep alive the age old tradition and ensure it is done in a safe and responsible manner. The Sodality also promotes cultural activities, tourism, and mutual aid for its members. The Sodality was one of the signatories to the UNESCO project application. It is based at the Museum of the Society Facchini of Santa Rosa which opened in 1994.&lt;ref name=sodality/&gt;

The Facchini wear a white uniform with a red sash tied at the waist and a headdress covered in leather. To be selected as one of the Facchini is considered a particular honor, and one most pass a test of strength, carrying a 160-pound box on his shoulders for at least seventy meters without stopping. Before setting out they receive a special blessing.&lt;ref name=machine/&gt; At around 9 pm the Facchini lift the 5 ton Macchina and start the first leg of the passage to the cheers of onlookers. For most of the route, the Facchini walk without any visual aid, directed by the capofacchini and guides posted at the four corners of the machine.

==Transport==
[[File:La Macchina.JPG|thumb|Fiore del Cielo on 5 September 2009]]

The transport of the Macchina of Santa Rosa is the annual main event of the city of [[Viterbo]].
Already at the afternoon the streets of the historical centre are being filled with citizens and visitors.
The transport begins at the Porta Romana, where the assembled Macchina stays in a scaffold, which is covered with curtains.
At around 8 pm the 800 candles of the Macchina are lighted by the local fire brigade.
The street lighting will be switched off completely.

During the transport there are five breaks. During these breaks the Macchina is put on special frames. The stopping places are:

* Piazza Fontana Grande
* Piazza del Plebiscito (in front of the guildhall)
* Piazza delle Erbe
* Corso Italia (in front of the church Santa Maria del Suffragio)
* Piazza del Teatro.&lt;ref name=machine&gt;[https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=it&amp;u=http://www.macchinadisantarosa.viterbo.it/&amp;prev=search "The Machine of Santa Rosa Viterbo", City of Viterbo]&lt;/ref&gt;

The last stretch up to the church of Santa Rosa has a remarkable inclination. In order to overcome this slope, the Macchina is pulled by ropes and additional people and is eventually placed in front of the pilgrimage chapel. The Macchina is exposed there for some days after the event.

==Massing in architectural theory==

The '''mental lexicon''' is defined as a mental dictionary that contains information regarding a word's meaning, pronunciation, syntactic characteristics, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jackendoff|first=R.S|title=Foundations of Language: Brain, Meaning, Grammar, and Evolution|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mental lexicon is a construct used in [[linguistics]] and [[psycholinguistics]] to refer to individual speakers' lexical, or word, [[Mental representation|representations]]. However, not all scientists agree as to the utility of the mental lexicon as a scientific construct.

The mental lexicon differs from the [[lexicon]] in that it is not just a general collection of words; instead, it deals with how those words are activated, stored, processed, and retrieved by each speaker. An individual's mental lexicon changes and grows as new words are learned and is always developing, but there are several theorists that argue exactly how this occurs. Some theories about the mental lexicon include the spectrum theory, the [[dual-coding theory]], [[Chomsky]]'s [[Universal grammar|nativist theory]], as well as the semantic network theory. Scientists also study the areas of the brain involved in lexical representations. The following addresses some of the physiological, social, and linguistic aspects of the mental lexicon.

Recent studies have also shown the possibility that the mental lexicon can shrink as an individual ages, limiting the number of words they can remember and learn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Takashima,|first=H|author2=J Yamada|title=Shrinkage of the mental lexicon of Kanji in an elderly Japanese woman: The effect of a 10-year passage of time.|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Gerontology|year=2010|volume=25|pages=105–115|doi=10.1007/s10823-009-9106-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of a second mental lexicon (L2) in bilingual speakers has also emerged as a topic of interest, suggesting that a speaker's multiple languages are not stored together, but as separate entities that are actively chosen from in each linguistic situation.&lt;ref name=jiang&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jiang|first=Nan|title=Lexical Representation and Development in a Second Language|journal=Applied Linguistics|year=2000|volume=21|pages=47–77|doi=10.1093/applin/21.1.47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of inquiry==
Although the mental lexicon is often called a mental "dictionary", in actuality, research suggests that it differs greatly from a dictionary. For example, the mental lexicon is not organized alphabetically like a dictionary; rather, it seems to be organized in a more complex manner, with links between phonologically and semantically related lexical items.&lt;ref name = "Jean"&gt;{{cite book | author = Aitchison, Jean | title = Words in the Mind: An Introduction to the Mental Lexicon | location = Malden, MA | publisher = Blackwell | year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is suggested by evidence of phenomena such as [[slips of the tongue]], which showed that replacing words such as ''anecdote'' for ''antidote''.&lt;ref name = "Jean"/&gt;

Also, while dictionaries contain a fixed number of words to be counted, and remain outdated as language is continually changing, the mental lexicon consistently updates itself with new words and word meanings, while getting rid of old, unused words. The active nature of the mental lexicon makes any dictionary comparison unhelpful.&lt;ref name = "CLA"&gt;{{cite book | title = Contemporary Linguistic Analysis (5th Custom Edition for U of A) | publisher = Pearson Custom Publishing | location = Toronto, ON | year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research is continuing to identify the exact way that words are linked and accessed. A common method to analyze these connections is through a [[lexical decision task|lexical decision]]  task.&lt;ref name="CLA"/&gt;

'''Lexical Decision Tasks''' have been used for many years to access how the mental lexicon is structured. Participants in this task are required to respond as quickly and accurately as possible to a string of letters presented on a screen to say if the string is a non-word or a real word.&lt;ref name=altman&gt;{{cite book|last=Altman|first=Gerry|title=The Ascent of Babel: An Exploration of Language, Mind, and Understanding|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0198523777}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reaction times from this task indicate that certain words are more "active" in participants' minds after related words have been presented. An example of this would be to present the word "bread" to the participant and then see an decreased reaction time later to the word "butter". Since the word "bread" had activated all related words, including "butter", this decreased reaction time demonstrates that related words are stored closely in the mental lexicon.&lt;ref name=altman /&gt; By doing lexical decision tasks, researchers have been able to analyze what words are stored with what related counterparts, and what can activate these words.

==Theories and perspectives==
Not all linguists and psychologists believe in the mental lexicon's existence and there is much controversy over the concept. One theory about the mental lexicon states that it organizes our knowledge about words "in some sort of dictionary."&lt;ref name="Access"&gt;{{ cite book | title = Accessing the Mental Lexicon | url = http://homepage.mac.com/gerry_altmann/babel/assets/Chapter-6.pdf | format = PDF | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090807014649/http://homepage.mac.com/gerry_altmann/babel/assets/Chapter-6.pdf | archivedate = 2009-08-07 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another states that the mental lexicon is "a collection of highly complex neural circuits".&lt;ref name = "Access"/&gt; The latter, '''Semantic Network Theory''', proposes the idea of ''spreading activation'', which is a hypothetical mental process that takes place when one of the nodes in the semantic network is activated, and proposes three ways this is done: priming effects, neighborhood effects, and frequency effects, which have all been studied in depth over the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forster|first=Kenneth|author2=Chambers|title=Lexical Access and Naming Time|journal=Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior|date=December 1973|volume=12|issue=6|pages=627–635|doi=10.1016/S0022-5371(73)80042-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marslen-Wilson|first=William|title=Functional Parallelism in Spoken Word-Recognition|journal=Cognition|date=March 1987|volume=25|issue=1–2|pages=71–102|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(87)90005-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Priming''' is a term used in Lexical Decision Tasks that accounts for decreased reaction times of related words. Interchangeable with the word "activation" in many cases, priming refers to the ability to have related words assist in the reaction times of others. In the example above, the word bread "primed" butter to be retrieved quicker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Traxler|first=Matthew|title=Introduction to Psycholinguistics: Understanding Language Science|year=2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=1405198621}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Neighborhood Effects''' refer to the activation of all similar "neighbors" of a target word. Neighbors are defined as items that are highly confusable with the target word due to overlapping features of other words. An example of this would be that the word "game" has the neighbors "came, dame, fame, lame, name, same, tame, gale, gape, gate, and gave," giving it a neighborhood size of 11 because 11 new words can be constructed by only changing 1 letter of "game". The neighborhood effect claims that words with larger neighborhood sizes will have quicker reaction times in a lexical decision task suggesting that neighbors facilitate the activation of other neighborhood words.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Andrews|first=Sally|title=Frequency and Neighborhood Effects on Lexical Access: Activation or Search?|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|date=September 1989|volume=15|issue=5|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.15.5.802|pages=802–814}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Frequency Effects''' suggest that words that are frequent in an individual's language are recognized faster than words that are infrequent. Forster and Chambers, 1973, found that high frequency words were named faster than low frequency ones, and Whaley, 1978 found that high frequency words were responded to faster than low frequency ones in a lexical decision task.&lt;ref name="Access"/&gt;

In the '''spectrum theory''', at one end "each phonological form is connected to one complex semantic representation", at the opposite end, homonyms and polysemes have their "own semantic representation[s]".&lt;ref name = "Brown"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Brown, S. W | title = Polysemy in the Mental Lexicon. Colorado Research in Linguistics | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | year = 2008 |url=http://www.colorado.edu/ling/CRIL/Volume21_Issue1/paper_BROWN.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The middle of the spectrum contains the theories that "suggest that related senses share a general or core semantic representation".&lt;ref name = "Brown"/&gt; The "[[dual coding theory]] (DCT)"&lt;ref name = "Paivio"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Paivio, A | title = Dual coding theory and the mental lexicon | journal = The Mental Lexicon | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 205–230 | year = 2010 | doi=10.1075/ml.5.2.04pai}}&lt;/ref&gt; contrasts multiple and [[common coding theory|common coding theories]]. DCT is "an internalized nonverbal system that directly represents the perceptual properties and affordances of nonverbal objects and events, and an internalized verbal system that deals directly with linguistic stimuli and responses".&lt;ref name = "Paivio"/&gt; Similarly, we do not observe words "as elements in a data structure" that are "retrieved from memory, but rather as stimuli that alter mental states".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Elman, J. L | title = Lexical knowledge without a lexicon? | journal = The Mental Lexicon | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–33 | year = 2011 | doi=10.1075/ml.6.1.01elm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others work around Chomsky's theory that "all syntactic and semantic features are included directly in the abstract mental representation of a lexical word".&lt;ref name = "Paivio"/&gt;

==Development==

=== First language development ===
[[File:Chart updated.jpg|thumb|Average vocabulary size of an English-speaking child by age.]]One aspect of research on the development of the mental lexicon has focused on vocabulary growth. Converging research suggests that at least English children learn several words a day throughout development. The figure at left illustrates the growth curve of a typical English-speaking child's vocabulary size.&lt;ref name = "CLA"/&gt;

The words acquired in the early stages of language development tend to be nouns or nounlike, and there are some similarities in first words across children (e.g., ''mama, daddy, dog'').&lt;ref name = "CLA"/&gt; [[Fast mapping]] is the idea that children may be able to gain at least partial information about the meaning of a word from how it is used in a sentence, what words it is contrasted with, as well as other factors. This allows the child to quickly hypothesize about the meaning of a word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heibeck|first=Tracy|author2=Ellen M. Markman|title=Word Learning in Children: An Examination of Fast Mapping|journal=Child Development|year=1987|volume=58|pages=1021–1034|doi=10.2307/1130543}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research suggests that, despite the [[fast mapping]] hypothesis, words are not just learned as soon as we are exposed to them, each word needs some type of activation and/or acknowledgement before it is permanently and effectively stored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Miller |first= G.A |year= 1986|title= Dictionaries in the mind |journal= Language and Cognitive Processes |volume= 1|issue=3 |pages=171–185 |doi=10.1080/01690968608407059}}&lt;/ref&gt; For young children, the word may be accurately stored in their mental lexicon, and they can recognize when an adult produces the incorrect version of the word, but they may not be able to produce the word accurately.&lt;ref name = "CLA"/&gt;{{Clear}}

As a child acquires their vocabulary, two separate aspects of the mental lexicon develop named the [[lexeme]] and the [[Lemma (morphology)|lemma]].&lt;ref name=jiang /&gt; The lexeme is defined as the part of the mental lexicon that stores morphological and formal information about a word, such as the different versions of spelling and pronunciation of the word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levelt | first=Willem| authorlink = Willem Levelt | title=Accessing Words in Speech Production: Stages, Processes and Representations|journal=Cognition|year=1992|volume=42|issue=1–3|pages=1–22|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(92)90038-J}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The lemma is defined as the structure within the mental lexicon that stores semantic and syntactic information about a word, such as part of speech and the meaning of the word. Research has shown that the lemma develops first when a word is acquired into a child's vocabulary, and then with repeated exposure the lexeme develops.&lt;ref name=jiang /&gt;

[[File:Structure of a lexical entry.png|thumb|The Internal Structure of a Lexical Entry (adapted from [[Willem Levelt|Levelt]] 1989).]]

=== Bilingual development ===

The development of the mental lexicon in bilingual children has increased in research over recent years, and has shown many complexities including the notion that bilingual speakers contain additional and separate mental lexicons for their other languages. Selecting between two or more different lexicons has shown to have benefits extending past language processes. Bilinguals significantly outperform their monolingual counterparts on executive control tasks. Researchers suggest that this enhanced cognitive ability comes from continually choosing between L1 and L2 mental lexicons.&lt;ref name=bia&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bialystok|first=Ellen|title=Reshaping the Mind: The Benefits of Bilingualism|journal=Canadian Journal of Experimental Psychology|year=2011|volume=65|issue=4|pages=229–235|doi=10.1037/a0025406|pmc=4341987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bilinguals have also shown resilience against the onset of Alzheimer's disease, monolinguals being an average of 71.4 years old and the bilinguals 75.5 years old when symptoms of dementia were detected, a difference of 4.1 years.&lt;ref name=bia /&gt;

==Brain==
Studies have shown that the [[temporal lobe|temporal]] and [[parietal lobe|parietal]] lobes in the left hemisphere are particularly relevant for the processing of lexical items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pulvermüller, F. | title = Nouns and verbs in the intact brain: Evidence from event-related potentials and high-frequency cortical responses | journal = Tübingen: Oxford Journals | volume = 9 | pages = 497–506 | year = 1999 | doi=10.1093/cercor/9.5.497}} http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/content/9/5/497.short&lt;/ref&gt;

The following are some hypotheses pertaining to semantic comprehension in the brain:

# '''Organized Unitary Content Hypothesis (OUCH):''' this hypothesis posits that lexical items that co-occur with high frequency are stored in the same area in the brain.&lt;ref name = "Adorni"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Adorni, R. |author2=Proverbio, A. | title = New insights into name category-related effects: is the age of acquisition a possible factor? | journal = Milan: BioMed Central | volume = 5 | pages = 1–14 | year = 2009 | pmc=2726156 | pmid=19640289 | doi=10.1186/1744-9081-5-33}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Domain-Specific Hypothesis:''' this hypothesis uses the theory of evolution to posit that certain categories that have an evolutionary advantage over others (such as useful items like tools) have their specialized and functionally dissociated neural circuits in the brain.&lt;ref name = "Adorni"/&gt;
# '''Sensory/Functional Hypothesis:''' this hypothesis posits that the ability to identify (i.e. be able to recognize and name) living things depends on visual information, while the ability to identify non-living things depends on functional information. Thus this hypothesis implies that modality-specific subsystems compose an overarching semantic network of lexical items.&lt;ref name = "Adorni"/&gt;

==Impaired access ==

[[Anomic aphasia]], [[aphasia]] ([[expressive aphasia|expressive]] + [[receptive aphasia]]) and [[Alzheimer's disease]] can all affect recalling or retrieving words.  Anomia renders a person completely unable to name familiar objects, places and people,&lt;ref name = "Speech"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.speech-therapy-on-video.com/receptiveaphasia.html |title=Improving Receptive Aphasia: Your Source of Information and solutions |publisher=Speech-therapy-on-video.com |accessdate=2012-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; a involves specific naming difficulties; sufferers of anomia have difficulties recalling words.&lt;ref name = "Speech"/&gt; Anomia is a lesser level of dysfunction, a severe form of the "tip-of-the-tongue" phenomenon where the brain cannot recall the desired word.&lt;ref name = "Speech"/&gt; Stroke, head trauma and brain tumors can cause anomia.&lt;ref name = "Speech"/&gt;

Expressive and receptive aphasia are neurological language disorders.&lt;ref name = "Diseases"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alldiseases.org/what-is-a-dysnomia/ |title=What Is A Dysnomia? |publisher=Alldiseases.org |date=2012-01-12 |accessdate=2012-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expressive aphasia limits the ability to convey thoughts through the use of speech, language or writing.&lt;ref name = "Speech"/&gt; Receptive aphasia affects a person's ability to comprehend spoken words, causing disordered sentences that have little or no meaning and which can include addition of [[nonce words]].&lt;ref name = "Diseases"/&gt;

Harry Whitaker states that Alzheimer's disease patients are forgetful of proper names. Patients have difficulty generating names, especially with phonological tasks such as words starting with a certain letter.&lt;ref name = "Whitaker"&gt;{{cite book | author = Whitaker, Harry A | title = Concise Encyclopedia of Brain and Language  | chapter =  Alzheimer's Disease | pages = 19–22| location = Oxford, UK: Elsevier Ltd | year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also have word-retrieval difficulties in spontaneous speech but still have relatively preserved naming of presented stimuli.&lt;ref name = "Whitaker"/&gt; Later, loss of naming of low-frequency lexical items occurs. Eventually, the loss of ability to comprehend and name the same lexical item indicates semantic loss of the lexical item.

== Shrinking ==

The majority of current research focuses on the acquisition and functioning of the mental lexicon, without much focus on what happens to the mental lexicon over time. Current studies suggest that as individuals age, they become less capable of storing and remembering words indicating that their "mental dictionary" is, in fact, shrinking. One study showed that the size of a Japanese woman's healthy mental lexicon of kanji shrank at a rate of approximately 1% per year between ages 83 and 93 on average. This was tested through a simple naming task once when the subject was 83, and then again at the age of 93.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Takashima|first=H|author2=J Yamada|title=Shrinkage of the mental lexicon of Kanji in an elderly Japanese woman: The effect of a 10-year passage of time |year=2010|volume=25|issue=1|pages=105–115|doi=10.1007/s10823-009-9106-x|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Gerontology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other considerations==

===Storage of acronyms===

As research on the mental lexicon continues to expand into our modern world of abbreviations, researchers have begun to question whether the mental lexicon has the capacity to store acronyms as well as words. Using a lexical decision task with acronyms as priming words, researchers saw that acronyms could in fact prime other related information. This finding suggests that acronyms are stored alongside their related information in the mental lexicon just as a word would be. Research also demonstrated that these acronyms would still prime related information despite inaccurate capitalization (i.e. bbc had the same priming effects as BBC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brysbaert|first=M|author2=S Speybroeck |author3=D Vanderelst |title=Is there room for the BBC in the mental lexicon?

The '''nature study''' movement (alternatively, '''Nature Study''' or '''nature-study''') was a popular education movement in America in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  Nature study attempted to reconcile scientific investigation with spiritual, personal experiences gained from interaction with the natural world.  Led by [[progressive education|progressive]] educators and naturalists such as [[Anna Botsford Comstock]], [[Liberty Hyde Bailey]], [[Louis Agassiz]] and [[Wilbur S. Jackman]], nature study changed the way science was taught in schools by emphasizing learning from tangible objects, something that was embodied by the movement's mantra "study nature, not books".

The movement popularized scientific study outside of the classroom as well, and has proven highly influential for figures involved in the modern environmental movement, such as [[Aldo Leopold]] and [[Rachel Carson]].&lt;ref&gt;Armitage, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
By the mid-19th century, a growing concern for the state of the environment began to take shape.  In 1864, American diplomat [[George Perkins Marsh]] published the groundbreaking book ''[[Man and Nature]]''.  Highlighting people's responsibility to the natural world, the work marked the beginning of the conservation movement.&lt;ref&gt;Krech, p. 441&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the 1890s, the idea of nature study existed, but the "efforts had been sporadic and piecemeal".&lt;ref name="Kohlstedt, p. 327"&gt;Kohlstedt, "Nature, Not Books", p. 327&lt;/ref&gt;  Naturalist Louis Agassiz wanted to capture "learners in studying the natural world".  His students, who were influenced by this philosophy, went on to provide the nature study knowledge in public schools.&lt;ref name="Kohlstedt, p. 325"&gt;Kohlstedt, "Nature, Not Books", p. 325&lt;/ref&gt;   It was Agassiz who coined the phrase, "Study nature, not books."&lt;ref name="Kohlstedt, p. 325"/&gt;

==Definitions==
Nature study can be described as "conceiving of the movement as a loose coalition of communities composed of individuals, societies, and institutions able to find some common ground in the study and appreciation of the natural world".&lt;ref name="Tolley, p. 128"&gt;Tolley, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;  In "Leaflet I: What Is Nature-Study?" from a 1904 collection nature study lessons, [[Liberty Hyde Bailey]] presented the following description of nature study:

&lt;blockquote&gt;NATURE-STUDY, as a process, is seeing the things that one looks at, and the drawing of proper conclusions from what one sees.  Its purpose is to educate the child in terms of his environment, to the end that his life may be fuller and richer.  Nature-study is not the study of a science, as of botany, entomology, geology, and the like.  That is, it takes the things at hand and endeavors to understand them, without reference primarily to the systematic order or relationships of objects.  It is informal, as are the objects which one sees.  It is entirely divorced from mere definitions, or from formal explanations in books.  It is therefore supremely natural.  It trains the eye and the mind to see and to comprehend the common things of life; and the result is not directly the acquiring of science but the establishing of a living sympathy with everything that is.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Anna Comstock defined the idea extensively in her book, ''Handbook of Nature Study'':  "Nature Study is for the comprehension of the Individual life of the bird, insect or plant that is nearest at hand."&lt;ref name="Comstock, p. 5"&gt;Comstock, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;  Comstock continued that nature study aided "both discernment and in expression of things as they are".&lt;ref name="Comstock, p. 1"&gt;Comstock, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;  The movement came at a time when society was concerned with the future of the next generation&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Kohlstedt, "Nature, Not Books", pp. ?-?&lt;/ref&gt; and with [[conservation movement|nature conservation]] itself,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Tolley, pp. ?-?&lt;/ref&gt; and because of this was met with high regard and high expectations.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  Though many efforts had come before 1890 by some naturalist and scientists to teach and expand the movement, the nature-study movement really did not gain momentum with the public until the late 19th century, early 20th century.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  The Nature Study changed the curriculum for children in many of areas of the country,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and it also affected the way young and teenage girls were able to learn and find job placement.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;  The movement was often related to creating a less extensive or formal science training for females. {{citation needed|reason=claim not substantiated by previous text|date=July 2015}}

=="Study nature, not books"==
Many scientists, teachers, and leaders throughout the United States agreed on the value of nature study, and the subject became an important part of how the natural world was examined in many areas of the country by the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Kohlstedt, "Nature, Not Books", p. 324&lt;/ref&gt;  Scientists gave public support to the philosophy and added to the creation of a curriculum and courses.&lt;ref name="Kohlstedt, p. 327"/&gt;  The movement was particularly popular in the Northeast, the West, and the Midwest.  The South also found some use for the idea of natural science in their agriculture schools, as well as at Tuskegee Institute in Alabama (now [[Tuskegee University]]) and Hampton Institute in Virginia (now [[Hampton University]]).&lt;ref&gt;Kohlstedt, "Nature, Not Books", pp. 351–352&lt;/ref&gt;  Nature Study could be found in both urbanized, highly populated cities and in rural school systems because of the involvement of scientists in designing and implementing curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Kohlstedt, "Nature, Not Books", p. 326&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, Wilbur Jackman created an outline of nature study with "life and its phenomena" which examined how the study of plants and animals would consist of zoology and botany (under biology), physics, chemistry, meteorology, astronomy, geography, geology, and mineralogy.&lt;ref&gt;Kohlstedt, "Nature, Not Books", p. 334&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lucretia Crocker]] along with women's clubs and other help in the Boston area, created a "[[Teachers' School of Science]]" in Back Bay at the New Museum of the Boston society.   Along with a [[Ellen Swallow Richards]], Crocker created a mineralogy course for teachers.   Teacher found such education in the Boston area because of area scientist that would teach their courses.&lt;ref&gt;Kohlstedt, "Nature, Not Books", p. 328&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Nature Study Society was founded in 1908, and still exists today.&lt;ref name="Tolley, p. 129"&gt;Tolley, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;  The society was an important aspect as well in helping to bring about the Nature-Study movement. [[Anna Botsford Comstock]] is one of the society' past presidents.  It is considered to be America's oldest organization for environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.envirolink.org/resource.html?catid=5&amp;itemid=84 The American Nature Study Society]. EnviroLink Network. Retrieved on June 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anna Botsford Comstock]] studied and worked as the head of the Department of Nature Study at Cornell University with her husband, [[John Henry Comstock]].&lt;ref&gt;Herrick and Smith, caption of p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;  Cornell University was considered to be a major hub for the Nature Study movement.   She wrote the ''Handbook of Nature Study'', which includes sections on how to teach the subject and how to teach the courses to children, and also includes sections from different species of animals and plants to even the skies.

==Education for children==
Sciences were expanding in colleges and universities, and scientists felt "that students needed more and better preparation in secondary and primary schools".&lt;ref name="Kohlstedt, p. 329"&gt;Kohlstedt, "Nature, Not Books", p. 329&lt;/ref&gt;  Not only was the curriculum of schools evolving, but also was the system of education itself.  Populations were rising in big urban areas like New York and Chicago, and there was legislation to require students to spend required numbers of hours and days per year in the school system.&lt;ref name="Kohlstedt, p. 329"/&gt;  With a growing population due to immigration and other reasons, young people could be taught useful skills for life and academia in order to "share fundamental civic values and enlarged view of their world".&lt;ref&gt;Kohlstedt, "Nature, Not Books", p. 331&lt;/ref&gt;  The nature study became the way younger students learned of their natural world.&lt;ref&gt;Kohlstedt, "Nature, Not Books", p. 351&lt;/ref&gt;  This also came at a time when legislation was being passed for conservation in the country, which helped gather support from parents and educators in the country.&lt;ref name="Tolley, p. 129"/&gt;

Anna Botsford Comstock, stated in her book ''Handbook of Nature Study'', "nature-study cultivates the child's imagination, since there are so many wonderful and true stories that he may read with his own eyes, which affect his imagination as much as does fairy lore, at the same time nature study cultivates in him a perception and a regard for what is true, and the power to express it...Nature study gives the child practical and helpful knowledge.  It makes him familiar with nature's ways and forces, so that he is not so helpless in the presence of natural misfortune and disasters."&lt;ref name="Comstock, p. 1"/&gt;  Comstock also felt that the nature study did not begin with books, but through the observations of life and form from the first naturalists.&lt;ref&gt;Comstock, p. 5–6&lt;/ref&gt;  The point of the system being to "give pupils an outlook over all the forms of life and their relation one to another".&lt;ref name="Comstock, p. 5"/&gt;

Because of the importance placed on the new generation, the surrounding public watched the schools carefully with high expectations of the students in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Kohlstedt, "Nature, Not Books", p. 330&lt;/ref&gt;

A study in Kim Tolley's the ''Science Education of American Girls'' showed that of 127 public school systems, 49% offered Nature-study in all grades, 25% offered in at least six grades, 11% in at least four grades, 5% in three grades or lower, and 10% did not offer it at all in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Tolley, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women in the movement==
Women played many roles in this movement within American society.  Some were able to find supervisory jobs, or jobs as professor in natural history at school districts, or institutions of higher learning.  Some women helped to create the movement itself, like Anna Botsford Comstock, and also teachers were able to "[implement] nature study to varying degrees in their classrooms and occasionally modified the curriculum created by male professionals so that it favored the life sciences".&lt;ref name="Tolley, p. 129"/&gt;

Over the four years from 1915–16 to 1919–20 in the state of  [[Wisconsin]], the percentage of women high school biology teachers increased from 50% to 67%.  The number of women physics teachers increased from 3% in 1915–16 to 7% in 1919–20.&lt;ref&gt;Tolley, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

The nature study movement gave a new outlook to the [[education of young women]] in the United States. In the later 20th century, opinions started to change about the movement, and it declined.  Some male critics saw it as "romantic" or "sentimental".  This created a gender issue that was forcibly imposed on the nature-study movement.&lt;ref name="Tolley, p. 128"/&gt;  By the beginning of the 20th century, many young women were attracted to the natural history movement.&lt;ref&gt;Tolley, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

The Science Education of American Girls by Kim Tolley gives an explanation of high schools in America for females.  "Higher schools for females served as important centers for the dissemination of the nineteenth-century ideology of separate spheres, institutions commonly located in small towns and in rural, rather than urban, areas.  The ideology prevailed in antebellum southern institutions serving elite girls who never expected to work for wages outside the home, in northern schools that explicitly south to prepare teachers for the nation's growing common schools, and in Catholic academies on the western front."&lt;ref&gt;Tolley, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;

Others, such as [[Susanna Moodie]], and her daughter [[Agnes_Dunbar_Moodie_Fitzgibbon|Agnes Chamberlin]] who made nature studies to support her family, and Catharine Parr Traill investigated nature to describe the new territories where they found themselves in nineteenth century Canada.&lt;ref&gt;https://fishercollections.library.utoronto.ca/chamberlin_chrono&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28162">[[File:Dispersant Mechanism.jpg|thumb|Oil dispersant mechanism of action|alt=Color illustration of how oil dispersants work]]
An '''oil dispersant''' is a mixture of [[emulsifier]]s and [[solvent]]s that helps break oil into small droplets following an [[oil spill]]. Small droplets are easier to [[Biological dispersal|disperse]] throughout a water volume, and small droplets may be more readily [[biodegrade]]d by [[microbes]] in the water. Dispersant use involves a trade-off between exposing [[coastal ecology|coastal life]] to surface oil and exposing aquatic life to dispersed oil. While submerging the oil with dispersant may lessen exposure to [[marine life]] on the surface, it increases exposure for animals dwelling underwater, who may be harmed by [[toxicity]] of both dispersed oil and dispersant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Treating oil spills with chemical dispersants: Is the cure worse than the ailment?|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/07/130705212219.htm|accessdate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dispersants EPA.gov|url=http://www.epa.gov/bpspill/dispersants.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dispersants|url=http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/public_lands/energy/dirty_energy_development/oil_and_gas/gulf_oil_spill/dispersants.html|work=Center for Biological Diversity|accessdate=6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although dispersant reduces the amount of oil that lands ashore, it may allow faster, deeper penetration of oil into coastal terrain, where it is not easily biodegraded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Study: Dispersants Can Move Hydrocarbons Faster and Deeper into Gulf Sand|url=http://gulfresearchinitiative.org/study-dispersants-can-move-hydrocarbons-faster-and-deeper-into-gulf-sand/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Torrey Canyon}}''Torrey Canyon''===
{{Main article|Torrey Canyon oil spill}}
In 1967, the supertanker ''[[Torrey Canyon oil spill|Torrey Canyon]]'' leaked oil onto the English coastline.&lt;ref name=Clayton /&gt;  [[Alkylphenol]] [[surfactant]]s were primarily used to break up the oil, but proved very toxic in the marine environment; all types of marine life were killed. This led to a reformulation of dispersants to be more environmentally sensitive. After the ''Torrey Canyon'' spill, new boat-spraying systems were developed.&lt;ref name=Clayton /&gt; Later reformulations allowed more dispersant to be contained (at a higher concentration) to be [[aerosolize]]d.

==={{anchor|Exxon Valdez}}''Exxon Valdez''===
{{Main article|Exxon Valdez oil spill}}
Alaska had fewer than 4,000 gallons of dispersants available at the time of the ''Exxon Valdez'' oil spill, and no aircraft with which to dispense them. The dispersants introduced were relatively ineffective due to insufficient wave action to mix the oil and water, and their use was shortly abandoned.&lt;ref name="epa"&gt;EPA: Learning Center: Exxon Valdez.  http://www.epa.gov/oem/content/learning/exxon.htm accessed 5/23/2012&lt;/ref&gt;

A report by [[David Kirby (journalist)|David Kirby]] for [[TakePart]] found that the main component of the [[Corexit|Corexit 9527]] formulation used during Exxon Valdez cleanup, [[2-butoxyethanol]], was identified as "one of the agents that caused liver, kidney, lung, nervous system, and blood disorders among cleanup crews in Alaska following the 1989 ''Exxon Valdez'' spill."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Corexit: An Oil Spill Solution Worse Than the Problem?|url=http://www.takepart.com/article/2013/04/17/corexit-deepwater-horizon-oil-spill|work=TakePart|accessdate=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early use (by volume) ===
Dispersants were applied to a number of oil spills between the years 1967 and 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.purdue.edu/discoverypark/energy/shell_energy_day/assets/pdfs/Jafvert%20Shell%20Oil%20Day%20Talk.pdf|title = Understanding oil dispersants|date = 2011-09-23|accessdate = 2015-03-07|website = School of Civil Engineering &amp; Division of Environmental and Ecological Engineering|publisher = Purdue University|last = Jafvert|first = Chad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, an estimated 1.84 million gallons of [[Corexit]] was used in an attempt to reduce the amount of surface oil and mitigate the damage to coastal habitat. BP purchased one-third of the world's supply of Corexit soon after the spill began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Less Toxic Dispersants Lose Out in BP Oil Spill Cleanup|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/13/business/energy-environment/13greenwire-less-toxic-dispersants-lose-out-in-bp-oil-spil-81183.html?_r=1&amp;|accessdate=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nearly half (771,000 gallons) of the dispersants were applied directly at the wellhead.&lt;ref name="Gov't Commission"&gt;{{cite web|author=National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling |title=Use of Surface and Subsea Dispersants During the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill |url=https://www.hsdl.org/?view&amp;did=16795 |accessdate=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary dispersant used were [[Corexit]] [[Corexit#Composition|9527 and 9500]], which were controversial due to [[toxicity]].

[[Maritime New Zealand]] used the oil dispersant [[Corexit|Corexit 9500]] to help in the cleanup process.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/rena-crisis/5767822/Dispersants-worse-than-oil&lt;/ref&gt; The dispersant was applied for only a week, after results proved inconclusive.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/Science-Stories/Where-Land-Meets-Sea/Cleaning-up-the-oil-spill&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==

==={{anchor|Overview}}Overview===
Surfactants reduce oil-water [[interfacial tension]], which helps waves break oil into small droplets. A mixture of oil and water is normally unstable, but can be stabilized with the addition of surfactants; these surfactants can prevent coalescence of dispersed oil droplets. The effectiveness of the dispersant depends on the weathering of the oil, sea energy (waves), salinity of the water, temperature and the type of oil.&lt;ref name=Fingas&gt;{{cite book|last=Fingas|first=Merv|title=The Basics of Oil Spill Cleanup|year=2001|publisher=Lewis Publishers|isbn=1-56670-537-1|pages=120–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dispersion is unlikely to occur if the oil spreads into a thin layer, because the dispersant requires a particular thickness to work; otherwise, the dispersant will interact with both the water and the oil. More dispersant may be required if the sea energy is low. The salinity of the water is more important for ionic-surfactant dispersants, as salt [[Electric-field screening|screens]] electrostatic interactions between molecules. The [[viscosity]] of the oil is another important factor; viscosity can retard dispersant migration to the oil-water interface and also increase the energy required to shear a drop from the slick. Viscosities below 2,000 centi[[Poise (unit)|poise]] are optimal for dispersants. If the viscosity is above 10,000 centipoise, no dispersion is possible.&lt;ref name=NRC&gt;{{cite book|last=National Research Council (U.S.)|title=Using Oil Spill Dispersants on the Sea|year=1989|publisher=National Academy Press|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Requirements===
There are five requirements for surfactants to successfully disperse oil:&lt;ref name=Clayton/&gt; 
*Dispersant must be on the oil's surface in the proper concentration
*Dispersant must penetrate (mix with) the oil
* Surfactant molecules must orient at the oil-water interface (hydrophobic in oil and [[Hydrophile|hydrophilic]] in water)
* Oil-water interfacial tension must be lowered (so the oil can be broken up).
* Energy must be applied to the mix (for example, by waves)

===Effectiveness===
The effectiveness of a dispersant may be analyzed with the following equations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chandrasekar|first1=Subhashini|last2=Sorial|first2=George|last3=Weaver|first3=James|title=Dispersant effectiveness on oil spills – impact of salinity|journal=ICES Journal of Marine Science |date=2006|volume=63|pages=1418–1430|doi=10.1016/j.icesjms.2006.04.019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Area refers to the area under the absorbance/wavelength curve, which is determined using the trapezoidal rule. The absorbances are measured at 340, 370, and 400&amp;nbsp;nm.

Area = 30(Abs&lt;sub&gt;340&lt;/sub&gt; + Abs&lt;sub&gt;370&lt;/sub&gt;)/2 + 30(Abs&lt;sub&gt;340&lt;/sub&gt; + Abs&lt;sub&gt;400&lt;/sub&gt;)/2           (1)

The dispersant effectiveness may then be calculated using the equation below.

Effectiveness (%) = Total oil dispersed x 100/(ρ&lt;sub&gt;oil&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;oil&lt;/sub&gt;)

* ρ&lt;sub&gt;oil&lt;/sub&gt; = density of the test oil (g/L)
* V&lt;sub&gt;oil&lt;/sub&gt; = volume of oil added to test flask (L)
* Total oil dispersed = mass of oil x 120mL/30mL
* Mass of oil = concentration oil x V&lt;sub&gt;DCM&lt;/sub&gt;
* V&lt;sub&gt;DCM&lt;/sub&gt; = final volume of DCM-extract of water sample (0.020 L)
* Concentration of oil = area determined by Equation (1) / slope of calibration curve

==={{anchor|Dispersion Models}}Dispersion models===
Developing well-constructed models (accounting for variables such as oil type, salinity and surfactant) are necessary to select the appropriate dispersant in a given situation. Two models exist which integrate the use of dispersants: Mackay's model and Johansen's model.&lt;ref name="Using Oil Dispersants"&gt;National Research Council Committee on Effectiveness of Oil Spill Dispersants: Using Oil Dispersants on the Sea, National Academy Press, 1989 pp 63-75&lt;/ref&gt; There are several parameters which must be considered when creating a dispersion model, including oil-slick thickness, [[advection]], resurfacing and wave action.&lt;ref name="Using Oil Dispersants"/&gt; A general problem in modeling dispersants is that they change several of these parameters; surfactants lower the thickness of the film, increase the amount of diffusion into the water column and increase the amount of breakup caused by wave action. This causes the oil slick's behavior to be more dominated by vertical diffusion than horizontal advection.&lt;ref name="Using Oil Dispersants"/&gt;

One equation for the modeling of oil spills is:&lt;ref name= "Tkalich"&gt;Tkalich,P Xiaobo,C Accurate Simulation of Oil Slicks, Tropical marine science institute, Presented 2001 International Oil Spill Conference pp 1133-1135 http://www.ioscproceedings.org/doi/pdf/10.7901/2169-3358-2001-2-1133&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac {\partial h}{\partial t} + \vec \nabla \left(h \left( \vec {U} + \frac {\vec \tau }{f} \right) \right) - \vec \nabla (E \vec \nabla h) = R &lt;/math&gt;

where

* ''h'' is the oil-slick thickness
* &lt;math&gt;\vec {U}&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of ocean currents in the mixing layer of the water column (where oil and water mix together)
* &lt;math&gt;\vec \tau&lt;/math&gt; is the wind-driven shear stress
* ''f'' is the oil-water friction coefficient
* ''E'' is the relative difference in densities between the oil and water
* ''R'' is the rate of spill propagation

Mackay's model predicts an increasing dispersion rate, as the slick becomes thinner in one dimension. The model predicts that thin slicks will disperse faster than thick slicks for several reasons. Thin slicks are less effective at dampening waves and other sources of turbidity. Additionally, droplets formed upon dispersion are expected to be smaller in a thin slick and thus easier to disperse in water.
The model also includes:&lt;ref name="Using Oil Dispersants"/&gt;

* An expression for the diameter of the oil drop
* Temperature dependence of oil movement
* An expression for the resurfacing of oil
* Calibrations based on data from experimental spills

The model is lacking in several areas: it does not account for evaporation, the topography of the ocean floor or the geography of the spill zone.&lt;ref name="Using Oil Dispersants"/&gt;

Johansen's model is more complex than Mackay's model. It considers particles to be in one of three states: at the surface, [[Entrainment (hydrodynamics)|entrained]] in the water column or evaporated. The empirically based model uses probabilistic variables to determine where the dispersant will move and where it will go after it breaks up oil slicks. The drift of each particle is determined by the state of that particle; this means that a particle in the vapor state will travel much further than a particle on the surface (or under the surface) of the ocean.&lt;ref name="Using Oil Dispersants"/&gt; This model improves on Mackay's model in several key areas, including terms for:&lt;ref name="Using Oil Dispersants"/&gt;

* Probability of entrainment – depends on wind
* Probability of resurfacing – depends on density, droplet size, time submerged and wind
* Probability of evaporation – matched with empirical data

Oil dispersants are modeled by Johansen using a different set of entrainment and resurfacing parameters for treated versus untreated oil. This allows areas of the oil slick to be modeled differently, to better understand how oil spreads along the water's surface.

=={{anchor|Surfactants}}Surfactants==
{{Main article|Surfactants}}
Surfactants are classified into four main types, each with different properties and applications: [[anion]]ic, cationic, nonionic and [[zwitterion]]ic (or amphoteric). Anionic surfactants are compounds that contain an anionic polar group. Examples of anionic surfactants include [[sodium dodecyl sulfate]] and [[dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate]].&lt;ref name="Butler et. al." /&gt; Included in this class of surfactants are sodium alkylcarboxylates (soaps).&lt;ref name="Butt"&gt;Butt, Hans-Jürgen.  Graf, Karlheinz. Kappl, Michael.  "Physics and Chemistry of Interfaces".  2nd Edition.  WILEY-VCH. pp 265-299. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cationic surfactats are similar in nature to anionic surfactants, except the surfactant molecules carry a positive charge at the hydrophilic portion. Many of these compounds are [[Quaternary ammonium cation|quaternary ammonium salts]], as well as [[cetrimonium bromide]] (CTAB).&lt;ref name=Butt /&gt; Non-ionic surfactants are non-charged and together with anionic surfactants make up the majority of oil-dispersant formulations.&lt;ref name="Butler et. al." /&gt; The hydrophilic portion of the surfactant contains polar [[functional groups]], such as -OH or -NH.&lt;ref name=Butt /&gt; Zwitterionic surfactants are the most expensive, and are used for specific applications.&lt;ref name=Butt /&gt; These compounds have both positively and negatively charged components. An example of a zwitterionic compound is [[phosphatidylcholine]], which as a lipid is largely insoluble in water.&lt;ref name=Butt /&gt;

==={{anchor|HLB Values}}HLB values===
Surfactant behavior is highly dependent on the [[hydrophilic-lipophilic balance]] (HLB) value. The HLB is a coding scale from 0 to 20 for non-[[ion]]ic surfactants, and takes into account the chemical structure of the surfactant molecule. A zero value corresponds to the most [[Lipophilicity|lipophilic]] and a value of 20 is the most hydrophilic for a non-ionic surfactant.&lt;ref name=Clayton&gt;{{cite book|last=Clayton|first=John R.|title=Oil Spill Dispersants: Mechanisms of Action and Laboratory Tests|year=1992|publisher= C K Smoley &amp; Sons|isbn=0-87371-946-8|pages=9–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, compounds with an HLB between one and four will not mix with water. Compounds with an HLB value above 13 will form a clear solution in water.&lt;ref name="Butler et. al."&gt;Using Oil Spill Dispersants.  National Academy Press.  pp 29-32 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Oil dispersants usually have HLB values from 8–18.&lt;ref name="Butler et. al." /&gt;

Two formulations of different dispersing agents for oil spills, Dispersit and Omni-Clean, are shown below. A key difference between the two is that Omni-Clean uses ionic surfactants and Dispersit uses entirely non-ionic surfactants. Omni-Clean was formulated for little or no toxicity toward the environment. Dispersit, however, was designed as a competitor with Corexit. Dispersit contains non-ionic surfactants, which permit both primarily oil-soluble and primarily water-soluble surfactants. The partitioning of surfactants between the phases allows for effective dispersion.

=={{anchor|Degradation and Toxicity}}Degradation and toxicity==
Both the degradation and the toxicity of dispersants depend on the chemicals chosen within the formulation. Compounds which interact too harshly with oil dispersants should be tested to ensure that they meet three criteria:&lt;ref name=Mulkins&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mulkins-Phillips|first=G. J.|author2=Stewart, J.E.|title=Effect of Four Dispersants on Biodegradation and Growth of Bacteria on Crude Oil|journal=Applied Microbiology|date=October 1974|volume=28|pages=547–552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* They should be biodegradable.
* In the presence of oil, they must not be preferentially utilized as a carbon source.
* They must be nontoxic to indigenous bacteria.

Dispersants can be delivered in aerosolized form by an aircraft or boat. Sufficient dispersant with droplets in the proper size are necessary; this can be achieved with an appropriate pumping rate. Droplets larger than 1,000&amp;nbsp;µm are preferred, to ensure they are not blown away by the wind. The ratio of dispersant to oil is typically 1:20.&lt;ref name=Fingas /&gt;

'''Physical Cultural Studies''' (PCS) encompasses the diversely focused field of scholarly work which is united by a commitment toward engaging varied dimensions or expressions of (in)active bodies or physical culture (Andrews &amp; Silk, 2011). In this physical culture is understood as “cultural practices in which the physical body – the way it moves, is represented, has meanings assigned to it, and is imbued with power – is central” (Vertinsky, quoted in Silk &amp; Andrews, 2011)
Physical Cultural Studies is closely related to the fields of [[sociology of sport|sport sociology]], [[cultural studies]], [[sociology of the body]], [[body culture studies]], [[queer studies]] and [[disability studies]]. 

==Description==

===Empirical focus===
PCS is predominantly concerned with studying the active body. The aim of such a focus is to problematise the taken-for-granted aspects of human movement and embodiment in such a way that makes social divisions (class, gender, ethnicity, ability, generation, sex, nation, race), and the processes that produce, reproduce and contest these divisions become visible and changeable. In this respect, we can see that the 'physical' is of central importance to PCS. Indeed, it is this empirical focus ( and subsequent breadth) that separates PCS from fields such as the sociology of sport. This is because PCS scholars take as their subjects of study - all the many and varied, more or less 'legitimate', popular and emerging, work or leisure related - forms of physical culture. areas of study include: exercise, health, dance, recreation, leisure, fitness, daily living, and work related activities.

===Concern with Context===
In the analysis of these activities PCS considers context and contextualisation to be vital. Indeed, how can one understand a cultural practice without reference to all the surrounding factors, flows, processes, actors and institutions with which it is articulated? For example, PCS researchers identify and seek to understand the complex political, economic, social and technological relationships in which the event occurs in order to understand physical culture as relational.

===Social Change===
Those in the field of physical cultural studies believe that research into, or understanding of, physical culture is of little importance if it does not make a difference in the world. Therefore, the idea of 'value free' research is not accepted in PCS. Instead, [[Partisanship]] is the dominant ideal. Such a perspective is related to many aspects of PCS study that vary from 'mainstream' academia. For example, PCS is concerned with care and community in which public education is of central importance. In addition, PCS aims to be political, empowering and reflexive. Finally PCS researchers attempt to question their presupposed hierarchy over the researched.

See also [[praxis (process)|praxis]]

===Methodology===
PCS incorporates many methods of gathering data, oftentimes implementing a variety of methods together to create rich, contextual and multi-perspective analyses of physical culture. Such methods include ethnography, auto ethnography, contextual analysis, media analysis, discourse analysis and participant observation.

{{Redirect|Preamp|the device used in professional audio|Microphone preamplifier}}
[[Image:Musicfirstaudioclassicpreamplifier.jpg|thumb|right|An example of a typical high-end [[Stereophonic sound|stereo]] preamplifier.]]

A '''preamplifier''' (preamp or "pre") is an [[electronic amplifier]] that converts a weak electrical [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] into an output signal strong enough to be noise-tolerant and strong enough for further processing, or for sending to a [[power amplifier]] and a [[loudspeaker]]. Without this, the final signal would be noisy or distorted. They are typically used to amplify signals from analog sensors such as [[microphone]]s and [[pickup (guitar)|pickups]]. Because of this, the preamplifier is often placed close to the [[sensor]] to reduce the effects of [[Noise (electronics)|noise]] and [[Electromagnetic interference|interference]].

==Description==
An ideal preamp will be linear (have a constant [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] through its operating range), have high [[input impedance]] (requiring only a minimal amount of current to sense the input signal) and a low [[output impedance]] (when current is drawn from the output there is minimal change in the output voltage).  It is used to boost the signal strength to drive the cable to the main instrument without significantly degrading the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (SNR). The noise performance of a preamplifier is critical. According to [[Friis formulas for noise|Friis's formula]], when the gain of the preamplifier is high, the SNR of the final signal is determined by the SNR of the input signal and the [[noise figure]] of the preamplifier.

Three basic types of preamplifiers are available:
* current-sensitive preamplifier
* [[parasitic capacitance|parasitic-capacitance]] preamplifier
* [[charge amplifier|charge-sensitive preamplifier]].

==Audio systems==
In an audio system, they are typically used to amplify signals from analog sensors to [[line level]]. The second amplifier is typically a [[power amplifier]] (power amp).  The preamplifier provides [[voltage]] gain (e.g., from 10 mV to 1 V) but no significant [[Electric current|current]] gain. The power amplifier provides the higher voltage necessary to drive [[loudspeaker]]s. For these systems some common sensors are [[microphone]]s, [[pickup (music technology)|instrument pickups]], and [[phonograph]]s. Preamplifiers are often integrated into the audio inputs on [[mixing console]]s, [[DJ mixer]]s, and [[sound card]]s. They can also be stand-alone devices.

==Misnomer== 
In a home [[audio system]], the term 'preamplifier' may sometimes be used to describe equipment which merely [[switch]]es between different [[line level]] sources and applies [[attenuation|volume control]] and possibly [[tone control circuit]]s. Such equipment prepares the signal before amplification but, in fact, no actual amplification circuitry may be involved.

== Examples ==
* The integrated preamplifier in a foil [[electret microphone]].
* The first stages of an [[instrument amplifier]], which is then sent to the power amplifier. With instrument amplifiers, the preamp is often designed to produce [[distortion (music)|overdrive]] or distortion effects.
* A stand-alone unit for use in [[live music]] and [[recording studio]] applications.
* As part of a stand-alone [[channel strip]] or channel strip built into an audio [[mixing desk]].
* A [[Radio masts and towers|masthead]] amplifier used with [[television]] receiver [[antenna (electronics)|antenna]] or a [[satellite]] [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]] dish.
* The circuit inside of a hard drive connected to the magnetic heads or the circuit inside of CD/DVD drive which connects to the [[photodiode]]s.
* A [[switched capacitor]] circuit used to null the effects of mismatch offset in most [[CMOS]] comparator-based flash [[analog-to-digital converter]]s

'''Prone position''' ({{IPAc-en|p|r|oʊ|n}}) is a body position in which the person lies flat with the chest down and the back up. In [[anatomical terms of location]], the dorsal side is up, and the ventral side is down. The [[supine position]] is the 180° contrast.
[[File:Supine and prone 2012-02-20.jpg|thumb|Supine position and prone position]]
[[File:USMC-03344.jpg|thumb|290px|right|Two soldiers in prone position]]

==Etymology ==
The word "prone," meaning "naturally inclined to something, apt, liable," has been recorded in English since 1382; the meaning "lying face-down" was first recorded in 1578, but is also referred to as "lying down" or "going prone."

"Prone" derives from the Latin ''pronus'': "bent forward, inclined to," from the adverbial form of the prefix ''pro-'' "forward." Both the original, literal, and the derived figurative sense were used in Latin, but the figurative is older in English.

== Anatomy ==
In [[anatomy]], the prone position is a position of the [[human body|body]] lying face down. It is opposed to the [[supine position]] which is face up. Using the terms defined in the [[anatomical position]], the ventral side is down, and the dorsal side is up.

Concerning the forearm, [[Anatomical position|prone]] refers to that configuration where the palm of the [[hand]] is directed posteriorly, and the [[radius (bone)|radius]] and [[ulna]] are crossed.

== Shooting ==
In [[shooting sports|competitive shooting]], the '''prone position''' is the position of a shooter lying face down on the ground. It is considered the easiest and most accurate position as the ground provides extra stability.  It is the starting position in [[three positions]] events. Currently, the [[Olympic Games|Olympics]] only have one purely prone event, the fifty meters men's rifle prone. Both men and women also have the fifty meters rifle three positions. Many [[video games]] (particularly [[first-person shooter]]s) allow the [[player character]] to go into the prone position.

===50m Prone Men (ISSF)===
{{main article|50 metre rifle prone}}
Male shooters shoot a .22 LR calibre rifle (smallbore) over a course of fire of 60 shots to count, after unlimited sighting shots, in a time limit of 1 hour and 15 minutes (when using [[electronic target]]s). If necessary, an 'elimination' course of fire may be undertaken to reduce the number of shooters to the number that may fire simultaneously in a 'qualification' round. Each shot may score from 0 to 10 points, with no decimal points (e.g. 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10, but not 3.2 or 9.8 etc.) The maximum score for elimination or qualification round is 600 points. The top 8 shooters in the qualification round will be selected to shoot 'shot-for-shot' in an 'Olympic' final. The final is ten shots, shot after a five-minute period for unlimited sighters. The ten shots are shot on command in a 45-second time-span, where each shooter must shoot one shot. Following each finals shot, the individual shooter's score for that shot is read to the audience. Shots in the final are scored to one decimal place, e.g. a shooter may score 9.8 or 10.6 in the finals for a shot, whereas in the qualification or elimination round those same shots would score 9 or 10 respectively. The maximum score for 10 shots in the finals is 109.0, with 10.9 being the maximum score for each shot. The Finals score for the ten shots is added to the score for the qualification round.

===UK Prone (NSRA)===
The UK national shooting body also has courses of fire for prone shooting at multiple distances and targets. Commonly, this is split into what is known as 'short' and 'long' ranges.

====UK Prone Short Range====
The [[National Smallbore Rifle Association|NSRA]] generally refers to shooting .22 LR calibre rifles over a distance of between 15 yards and 25 metres 'indoors' as being short range shooting. Targets are generally outward gauging (touching a ring on the target scores the lower of the two adjacent scores), except on some of the Schools and older targets (e.g. 5 bull targets). Being indoors, no allowance is necessary for wind, light or other changes. Shots are scored as decimal values from 0 to 10, with no decimal places.

====UK Prone Long Range====
UK Long range shooting is generally over either 50 yards, 50 metres or 100 yards distance outdoors. Targets vary, but generally, the ISSF 50M (scaled) is used for 50 yards or 50 metres, and a proportionally sized target is used for 100 yards. A 50-yard, 50-metre or 100-yard target is generally constructed to allow 20 shots to count, to be executed during one 'detail' of 20 minutes duration. Sighting shots are included in that time period.

Outdoors, variables such as light, wind, temperature, humidity and mirage affect the target image and bullet trajectory. To help shooters, most ranges have wind flags placed at useful positions around the range to display the wind conditions.

==Pilots and the prone position==
[[Image:Hyener PA2006.jpg|thumb|Hang glider pilot in harness.]]
The '''prone position''' is also used to describe the way pilots and other crew may be positioned in an aircraft; lying on their stomachs rather than seated in a normal upright position. During [[World War II]], the [[bomb aimer]] in some bombers would be positioned this way to be better able to view the ground through a transparent panel or bubble in the nose of a bomber. Later, it was suggested that a pilot in the prone position might be more effective in some kinds of high-speed aircraft, because it would permit the pilot to withstand a greater [[g-force|''g''-force]] in the upward and downward direction with respect to the plane, and many speculative designs of the 1950s featured this arrangement. However, it never became mainstream, as testing revealed that the increased difficulty of operating aircraft controls in the prone position outweighed the advantages. Two examples of this approach are seen in the [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.93]] and the [[Gloster Meteor F8 "Prone Pilot"]]. Modern [[hang glider]]s are typically piloted in the prone position.

[[File:T72 Georgia.jpg|thumb|right|A [[T-72]] tank layered with reactive armour bricks.]]

'''Reactive armour''' is a type of [[vehicle armor|vehicle armour]] that reacts in some way to the impact of a weapon to reduce the damage done to the vehicle being protected. It is most effective in protecting against [[shaped charge]]s and specially hardened [[kinetic energy penetrator]]s. The most common type is ''explosive reactive armour'' (ERA), but variants include ''self-limiting explosive reactive armour'' (SLERA), ''non-energetic reactive armour'' (NERA), ''non-explosive reactive armour'' (NxRA), and electric reactive armour. NERA and NxRA modules can withstand multiple hits, unlike ERA and SLERA, but a second hit in exactly the same location may potentially penetrate any of those.

Essentially all anti-tank munitions work by piercing the armour and killing the crew inside, disabling vital mechanical systems, or both. Reactive armour can be defeated with multiple hits in the same place, as by [[tandem-charge]] weapons, which fire two or more [[shaped charge]]s in rapid succession. Without tandem charges, hitting the same spot twice is much more difficult.

==History==
[[File:IDET2007 reactive armor DYNA.jpg|thumb|right|Reactive armour "DYNA" for T-72 MBT]]

The idea of counterexplosion (''kontrvzryv'' in Russian) in armour was first proposed by the Scientific Research Institute of Steel (NII Stali) in 1949 in the USSR by academician [http://www.prometeus.nsc.ru/eng/science/schools/voitsekh/ Bogdan Vjacheslavovich Voitsekhovsky]{{failed verification|date=November 2017}}
(1922–1999). The first pre-production models were produced during the 1960s. However, insufficient theoretical analysis during one of the tests resulted in all of the prototype elements being blown up.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} For a number of reasons, including the accident, as well as a belief that Soviet tanks had sufficient armour, the research was ended. No more research was conducted until 1974 when the Ministry of the Defensive Industry announced a contest to find the best tank protection project.

A West German researcher, Manfred Held carried out similar work with the [[Israeli defence force|IDF]] in 1967–69.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-TtpAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA176&amp;lpg=PA176&amp;dq=Israel's+Clandestine+Diplomacies+MANFRED+HELD&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hmAx-J-DRN&amp;sig=5Q-zQU9yxOFn60BOqmWU9vbvs-Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiXmcyY37XUAhXHDxoKHVypARQQ6AEIIjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Israel's+Clandestine+Diplomacies+MANFRED+HELD&amp;f=false|title=Israel's Clandestine Diplomacies|first1=Clive|last1=Jones|first2=Tore T.|last2=Petersen|date=1 November 2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reactive armour created on the basis of the joint research was first installed on Israeli tanks during the [[1982 Lebanon war]] and was judged very effective.{{bywhom|date=June 2017}}

== Explosive reactive armour ==
[[File:Indian Army T-90.jpg|thumb|left|The advanced [[Kontakt-5]] explosive reactive armour on this [[T-90]]S is arranged in pairs of plates, giving the turret its prominent triangular profile.]]

[[File:IDET2007 reactive armor detail2.jpg|thumb|right|Reactive armour detail]]

[[File:Image Explosive Reactive Armor.png|thumb|right]]

An element of explosive reactive armour consists of a sheet or slab of high explosive sandwiched between two plates, typically metal, called the reactive or dynamic elements. On attack by a penetrating weapon, the explosive detonates, forcibly driving the metal plates apart to damage the penetrator. Against a shaped charge, the projected plates disrupt the metallic jet penetrator, effectively providing a greater path-length of material to be penetrated. Against a kinetic energy penetrator, the projected plates serve to deflect and break up the rod.

The disruption is attributed to two mechanisms.  First, the moving plates change the effective velocity and angle of impact of the shaped charge jet, reducing the angle of incidence and increasing the effective jet velocity versus the plate element.  Second, since the plates are angled compared to the usual impact direction of shaped charge warheads, as the plates move outwards the impact point on the plate moves over time, requiring the jet to cut through fresh plate material.  This second effect significantly increases the effective plate thickness during the impact.

To be effective against kinetic energy projectiles, ERA (Explosive Reactive Armour) must use much thicker and heavier plates and a correspondingly thicker explosive layer.  Such "heavy ERA," such as the Soviet-developed [[Kontakt-5]], can break apart a penetrating rod that is longer than the ERA is deep, again significantly reducing penetration capability.

An important aspect of ERA is the [[brisance]], or detonation speed of its explosive element.  A more brisant explosive and greater plate velocity will result in more plate material being fed into the path of the oncoming jet, greatly increasing the plate's effective thickness. This effect is especially pronounced in the rear plate receding away from the jet, which triples in effective thickness with double the velocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Held|first1=Manfred|title=Dr.|journal=Propellants, Explosives, Pyrotechnics|date=20 Aug 2004|volume=29|issue=4|page=245|doi=10.1002/prep.200400051|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/prep.200400051/pdf|accessdate=20 Jan 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ERA also counters explosively forged projectiles, as produced by a shaped charge.  The counter-explosion must disrupt the incoming projectile so that its momentum is distributed in all directions rather than towards the target, greatly diminishing its effectiveness.

Explosive reactive armour has been valued by the [[Soviet Union]] and its now-independent component states since the 1980s, and almost every tank in the eastern-European military inventory today has either been manufactured to use ERA or had ERA tiles added to it, including even the [[T-55]] and [[T-62]] tanks built forty to fifty years ago, but still used today by reserve units. The U.S. Army uses reactive armour on its Abrams tanks as part of the TUSK (Tank Urban Survivability Kit) package and on Bradley vehicles and the Israelis use it frequently on their American built [[M60 Patton|M60]] tanks.

ERA tiles are used as add-on (or "appliqué") armour to the portions of an [[armoured fighting vehicle]] that are most likely to be hit, typically the front ([[glacis]]) of the hull and the front and sides of the turret. Their use requires that a vehicle be fairly heavily armoured to protect itself and its crew from the exploding ERA.

A further complication to the use of ERA is the inherent danger to anyone near the tank when a plate detonates, disregarding that a [[high explosive anti-tank warhead|high explosive anti-tank]] (HEAT) warhead explosion would already cause great danger to anyone near the tank. Although ERA plates are intended only to bulge following detonation, the combined energy of the ERA explosive, coupled with the kinetic or explosive energy of the projectile, will frequently cause explosive fragmentation of the plate. The explosion of an ERA plate creates a significant amount of shrapnel, and bystanders are in grave danger of fatal injury. Thus, infantry must operate some distance from vehicles protected by ERA in combined arms operations.

== Non-explosive and non-energetic reactive armour ==

NERA and NxRA operate similarly to explosive reactive armour, but without the explosive liner.  Two metal plates sandwich an inert liner, such as rubber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.defense-update.com/features/du-1-04/feature-armor-protection.htm |title=Protection Systems For Future Armored Vehicles |accessdate=2008-08-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830004857/http://defense-update.com/features/du-1-04/feature-armor-protection.htm |archive-date=2008-08-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  When struck by a shaped charge's metal jet, some of the impact energy is dissipated into the inert liner layer, and the resulting high pressure causes a localized bending or bulging of the plates in the area of the impact.  As the plates bulge, the point of jet impact shifts with the plate bulging, increasing the effective thickness of the armour.  This is almost the same as the second mechanism that explosive reactive armour uses, but it uses energy from the shaped charge jet rather than from explosives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PG01&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=%2220060011057%22.PGNR.&amp;OS=DN/20060011057&amp;RS=DN/20060011057 Non-explosive energetic material and a reactive armour element using same], US Patent Application 20060011057, accessed August 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the inner liner is non-explosive, the bulging is less energetic than on explosive reactive armour, and thus offers less protection than a similarly-sized ERA.  However, NERA and NxRA are lighter, safe to handle, safer for nearby infantry, can theoretically be placed on any part of the vehicle, and can be packaged in multiple spaced layers if needed. A key advantage of this kind of armour is that it cannot be defeated via tandem warhead shaped charges, which employ a small forward warhead to detonate ERA before the main warhead fires.

== Electric reactive armour ==
{{Expand section|date=March 2008}}
A new technology called ''electric reactive armour'' (also termed ''electromagnetic reactive armour'', or colloquially as ''electric armour'') is in development. This armour is made up of two or more conductive plates separated by an air gap or by an insulating material, creating a high-power [[capacitor]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2002/08/54641 U.S. Military Uses the Force] (Wired News)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,539143,00.html 'Star Trek' shields to protect supertanks] (The Guardian)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

When an incoming body penetrates the plates, it closes the [[Electrical network|circuit]] to discharge the capacitor, dumping a great deal of energy into the penetrator, which may vaporize it or even turn it into a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], significantly diffusing the attack. It is not public knowledge whether this is supposed to function against both kinetic energy penetrators and shaped charge jets, or only the latter. This technology has not yet been introduced on any known operational platform. 

Another electromagnetic alternative to ERA uses layers of plates of electromagnetic metal with silicone spacers on alternate sides. The damage to the exterior of the armour passes electricity into the plates causing them to magnetically move together. As the process is completed at the [[speed of electricity]] the plates are moving when struck by the projectile causing the projectile energy to be deflected whilst the energy is also dissipated in parting the magnetically attracted plates.

== Directed energy reactive armour ==

Some active protection systems, like the German [[AMAP-ADS]] or the American [[Iron Curtain (countermeasure)|Iron Curtain]], have explosive modules that destroy projectiles with a directed energy explosion. This type of explosive module is similar in concept to the classic ERA, but without the metal plates and with directed energy explosives. The composition materials of the explosive modules are not public. The designer of the AMAP-ADS claims that his AMAP-ADS systems are effective against [[Explosively formed penetrator|EFP]] and [[Armour-piercing fin-stabilized discarding-sabot|APFSDS]].

It is a common role in [[systems engineering]] and [[software engineering]].

The first use of the term ''requirements engineering'' was probably in 1979 in  [[TRW Inc.|TRW]] technical report&lt;ref&gt;[http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA073132 Software Requirements Engineering Methodology (Development)] Alford, M. W. and Lawson,J. T. TRW Defense and Space Systems Group.  1979.&lt;/ref&gt; but did not come into general use until the 1990s with the publication of an [[IEEE Computer Society]] tutorial&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=Thayer |editor-first1=Richard H. |editor-last2=Dorfman |editor-first2=Merlin |title=Software Requirements Engineering |edition=2nd |publisher=[[IEEE Computer Society Press]] |date=March 1997 |isbn=0-8186-7738-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the establishment of a conference series on requirements engineering that has evolved into the current [[International Requirements Engineering Conference]].

In the [[waterfall model]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Royce |first1=W. W. |authorlink1=Winston W. Royce |title=Managing the Development of Large Software Systems: Concepts and Techniques |work=Proceedings of the 9th international conference on Software Engineering |conference=[[International Conference on Software Engineering|ICSE]]'87 |pages=1–9 |year=1970 |url=http://www.serena.com/docs/agile/papers/Managing-The-Development-of-Large-Software-Systems.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; requirements engineering is presented as the first phase of the development process. Later development methods, including the [[Rational Unified Process]] (RUP), for software, assume that requirements engineering continues through the lifetime of a system.

Requirement management, which is a sub-function of Systems Engineering practices, is also indexed in the INCOSE (International Council on Systems Engineering) manuals.

== Activities ==
The activities involved in requirements engineering vary widely, depending on the type of system being developed and the specific practices of the organization(s) involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sommerville |first1=Ian |authorlink1=Ian Sommerville (academic) | title=Software Engineering | edition=9th |year=2009 |publisher=[[Addison-Wesley]] |isbn=978-0-13-703515-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; These may include:

#[[Requirements inception]] or [[requirements elicitation]] – Developers and stakeholders meet, the latter are inquired concerning their needs and wants regarding the software product.
#[[Requirements analysis]] and negotiation – Requirements are identified (including new ones if the development is iterative) and conflicts with stakeholders are solved. Both written and graphical tools (the latter commonly used in the design phase but some find them helpful at this stage, too) are successfully used as aids. Examples of written analysis tools: [[use case]]s and [[user story|user stories]]. Examples of graphical tools: [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tynerblain.com/blog/2008/03/06/requirements-class-diagrams-1/|title=Uncovering Requirements With UML Class Diagrams Part 1|author=|date=7 March 2008|website=tynerblain.com|accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lifecycle Modeling Language|LML]].
#[[System modeling]] – Some engineering fields (or specific situations) require the product to be completely designed and modeled before its construction or fabrication starts and, therefore, the design phase must be performed in advance. For instance, blueprints for a building must be elaborated before any contract can be approved and signed. Many fields might derive models of the system with the [[Lifecycle Modeling Language]], whereas others, might use [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]]. Note: In many fields, such as software engineering, most modeling activities are classified as design activities and not as requirement engineering activities.
#Requirements specification – Requirements are documented in a formal artifact called a Requirements Specification (RS), which will become official only after validation. A RS can contain both written and graphical (models) information if necessary. Example: [[Software requirements specification]] (SRS).
#Requirements validation – Checking that the documented requirements and models are consistent and meet the needs of the stakeholder. Only if the final draft passes the validation process, the RS becomes official.
#[[Requirements management]] – Managing all the activities related to the requirements since inception, supervising as the system is developed and, even until after it is put into use (e. g., changes, extensions, etc.)

These are sometimes presented as chronological stages although, in practice, there is considerable interleaving of these activities.

==Problems==
One limited study in Germany presented possible problems in implementing requirements engineering and asked respondents whether they agreed that they were actual problems. The results were not presented as being generalizable but suggested that the principal perceived problems were incomplete requirements, moving targets, and time boxing, with lesser problems being communications flaws, lack of traceability, terminological problems, and unclear responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title=Naming the pain in requirements engineering: A design for a global family of surveys and first results from Germany| url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950584914001256 | journal=[[Information and Software Technology]] | date=2015 | pages=616–643 | volume=57 | doi=10.1016/j.infsof.2014.05.008 | first1=Daniel | last1=Méndez Fernández | first2=Stefan | last2=Wagner }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
There is no evidence that requirements engineering contributes to the success of software projects or systems. Problem structuring, a key aspect of requirements engineering, decreases design performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ralph|first1=Paul|last2=Mohanani|first2=Rahul|title=Is Requirements Engineering Inherently Counterproductive?|date=May 2015|publisher=IEEE|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272793687_Is_Requirements_Engineering_Inherently_Counterproductive}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some research suggests that software requirements are often an [[illusion]] misrepresenting design decisions as requirements in situations where no real requirements are evident.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi=10.1007/s00766-012-0161-4 | title=The illusion of requirements in software development| journal=Requirements Engineering | volume=18 | issue=3 | pages=293–296| date=September 2013| last=Ralph | first=P. | arxiv=1304.0116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Structural engineering]] depends upon a detailed knowledge of [[Structural load|loads]], [[physics]] and [[Building material|material]]s to understand and predict how structures support and resist self-weight and imposed loads. To apply the knowledge successfully structural engineers will need a detailed knowledge of [[mathematics]] and of relevant empirical and theoretical design codes. They will also need to know about the [[corrosion]] resistance of the materials and structures, especially when those structures are exposed to the external environment.

The criteria which govern the design of a structure are either serviceability (criteria which define whether the structure is able to adequately fulfill its function) or strength (criteria which define whether a structure is able to safely support and resist its design loads). A structural engineer designs a structure to have sufficient [[Strength of materials|strength]] and [[stiffness]] to meet these criteria.

Loads imposed on structures are supported by means of forces transmitted through structural elements. These forces can manifest themselves as [[Tension (physics)|tension]] (axial force), [[compression (physical)|compression]] (axial force), [[Shear stress|shear]], and [[bending]], or [[flexure]] (a bending moment is a force multiplied by a distance, or lever arm, hence producing a turning effect or [[torque]]).

==Strength==
[[Strength of materials|Strength]] depends upon material properties. The strength of a material depends on its capacity to withstand axial [[stress (mechanics)|stress]], [[shear stress]], bending, and torsion. The strength of a material is measured in force per unit area (newtons per square millimetre or N/mm², or the equivalent megapascals or MPa in the SI system and often pounds per square inch psi in the United States Customary Units system).

A structure fails the strength criterion when the [[stress (mechanics)|stress]] (force divided by area of material) induced by the loading is greater than the capacity of the structural material to resist the load without breaking, or when the [[Strain (materials science)|strain]] (percentage extension) is so great that the element no longer fulfills its function ([[Yield (engineering)|yield]]).

See also:
{{See also|Tensile strength|Compressive strength|Shear strength}}

==Stiffness==
[[Stiffness]] depends upon material properties and [[geometry]]. The stiffness of a structural element of a given material is the product of the material's [[Young's modulus]] and the element's [[second moment of area]]. Stiffness is measured in force per unit length (newtons per millimetre or N/mm), and is equivalent to the 'force constant' in [[Hooke's Law]].

The [[Deflection (engineering)|deflection]] of a structure under loading is dependent on its stiffness. The [[dynamic response]] of a structure to dynamic loads (the [[natural frequency]] of a structure) is also dependent on its stiffness.

In a structure made up of multiple structural elements where the surface distributing the forces to the elements is rigid, the elements will carry loads in proportion to their relative stiffness - the stiffer an element, the more load it will attract. This means that load/stiffness ratio, which is deflection, remains same in two connected (jointed) elements.  In a structure where the surface distributing the forces to the elements is flexible (like a wood framed structure), the elements will carry loads in proportion to their relative tributary areas.

A structure is considered to fail the chosen serviceability criteria if it is insufficiently stiff to have acceptably small [[Deflection (engineering)|deflection]] or [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamic]] response under loading.

The inverse of stiffness is [[flexibility (engineering)|flexibility]].

{{See also|Flexibility method|Direct stiffness method}}

==Safety factors==
The safe design of structures requires a design approach which takes account of the [[statistics|statistical]] likelihood of the failure of the structure. Structural design codes are based upon the assumption that both the loads and the material strengths vary with a [[normal distribution]].

The job of the structural engineer is to ensure that the chance of overlap between the distribution of loads on a structure and the distribution of material strength of a structure is acceptably small (it is impossible to reduce that chance to zero).

It is normal to apply a ''[[safety factor|partial safety factor]]'' to the loads and to the material strengths, to design using 95th percentiles (two [[standard deviations]] from the [[mean]]). The safety factor applied to the load will typically ensure that in 95% of times the actual load will be smaller than the design load, while the factor applied to the strength ensures that 95% of times the actual strength will be higher than the design strength.

The safety factors for material strength vary depending on the material and the use it is being put to and on the design codes applicable in the country or region.

===Load cases===
{{Globalize|date=December 2010}}
A '''load case''' is a combination of different types of loads with safety factors applied to them. A structure is checked for strength and serviceability against all the load cases it is likely to experience during its lifetime.

Typical load cases for design for strength (ultimate load cases; ULS) are:

: ''1.2 x Dead Load + 1.6 x Live Load''
: ''1.2 x Dead Load + 1.2 x Live Load + 1.2 x Wind Load''

A typical load case for design for serviceability (characteristic load cases; SLS) is:

: ''1.0 x Dead Load + 1.0 x Live Load''

Different load cases would be used for different loading conditions. For example, in the case of design for fire a load case of ''1.0 x Dead Load + 0.8 x Live Load'' may be used, as it is reasonable to assume everyone has left the building if there is a fire.

In multi-story buildings it is normal to reduce the total live load depending on the number of stories being supported, as the probability of maximum load being applied to all floors simultaneously is negligibly small.

It is not uncommon for large buildings to require hundreds of different load cases to be considered in the design.

==Newton's laws of motion==
{{Main|Newton's laws of motion}}

The most important natural laws for structural engineering are [[Newton's Laws of Motion]]

Newton's first law states that ''every body perseveres in its state of being at rest or of moving uniformly straight forward, except insofar as it is compelled to change its state by force impressed.''

Newton's second law states that ''the rate of change of momentum of a body is proportional to the resultant force acting on the body and is in the same direction.'' Mathematically, F=ma (force = mass x acceleration).

Newton's third law states that ''all forces occur in pairs, and these two forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.''

With these laws it is possible to understand the forces on a structure and how that structure will resist them. The Third Law requires that for a structure to be stable all the internal and external forces must be in [[Mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]]. This means that the sum of all internal and external forces on a ''[[free-body diagram]]'' must be zero:

* &lt;math&gt; \sum \vec F = 0 &lt;/math&gt;: the vectorial sum of the [[force]]s acting on the body equals zero. This translates to
::Σ ''H'' = 0: the sum of the horizontal components of the forces equals zero;
::Σ ''V'' = 0: the sum of the vertical components of forces equals zero;
* &lt;math&gt; \sum \vec M = 0 &lt;/math&gt;: the sum of the [[moment (physics)|moment]]s (about an arbitrary point) of all forces equals zero.

==Statical determinacy==
{{Main|Statically indeterminate}}

A structural engineer must understand the internal and external forces of a structural system consisting of structural elements and nodes at their intersections.

A statically determinate structure can be fully analysed using only consideration of equilibrium, from Newton's Laws of Motion.

A statically indeterminate structure has more unknowns than equilibrium considerations can supply equations for (see [[simultaneous equations]]). Such a system can be solved using consideration of equations of ''compatibility'' between geometry and deflections in addition to equilibrium equations, or by using [[virtual work]].

If a system is made up of &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; bars, &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; pin joints and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; support reactions, then it cannot be statically determinate if the following relationship does not hold:

&lt;math&gt;r + b = 2j&lt;/math&gt;

It should be noted that even if this relationship does hold, a structure can be arranged in such a way as to be statically indeterminate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Structural Modeling and Analysis|author=Dym, Clive L.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=1997|isbn=0-521-49536-9|pages=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elasticity==
{{Main|Elasticity (physics)|l1=Elasticity}}
{{See also|Hooke's Law}}

Much engineering design is based on the assumption that materials behave elastically. For most materials this assumption is incorrect, but empirical evidence has shown that design using this assumption can be safe. Materials that are elastic obey Hooke's Law, and plasticity does not occur.

For systems that obey Hooke's Law, the extension produced is directly proportional to the load:
:&lt;math&gt; \vec{\mathbf{F}}=k\vec{\mathbf{x}} \ &lt;/math&gt;
where
: ''x'' is the distance that the spring has been stretched or compressed away from the equilibrium position, which is the position where the spring would naturally come to rest [usually in meters],
: ''F'' is the restoring force exerted by the material [usually in newtons], and
: ''k'' is the '''force constant''' (or '''spring constant'''). This is the [[stiffness]] of the spring. The constant has units of force per unit length (usually in [[Newton (unit)|newtons]] per [[metre]])

==Plasticity==
[[File:Tresca stress 2D.png|right|thumb|Comparison of Tresca and Von Mises Criteria]]
{{Main|Plasticity (physics)|l1=Plasticity}}

Some design is based on the assumption that materials will behave [[Plasticity (physics)|plastically]].&lt;ref name=Heyman1&gt;{{cite book|title=Structural Analysis: A Historical Approach|author=Heyman, Jacques|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=1998|isbn=0-521-62249-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A plastic material is one which does not obey Hooke's Law, and therefore deformation is not proportional to the applied load. Plastic materials are [[ductile]] materials. Plasticity theory can be used for some reinforced concrete structures assuming they are underreinforced, meaning that the steel reinforcement fails before the concrete does.

Plasticity theory states that the point at which a structure collapses (reaches yield) lies between an upper and a lower bound on the load, defined as follows:

*If, for a given external load, it is possible to find a distribution of moments that satisfies equilibrium requirements, with the moment not exceeding the yield moment at any location, and if the boundary conditions are satisfied, then the given load is a '''lower bound''' on the collapse load.
*If, for a small increment of displacement the internal work done by the structure, assuming that the moment at every plastic hinge is equal to the yield moment and that the boundary conditions are satisfied, is equal to the external work done by the given load for that same small increment of displacement, then that load is an '''upper bound''' on the collapse load.

If the correct collapse load is found, the two methods will give the same result for the collapse load.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Design of Concrete Structures|author1=Nilson, Arthur H. |author2=Darwin, David |author3=Dolan, Charles W. |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|date=2004|isbn=0-07-248305-9|pages=486}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plasticity theory depends upon a correct understanding of when yield will occur. A number of different models for stress distribution and approximations to the [[yield surface]] of plastic materials exist:&lt;ref name=Heyman&gt;{{cite book|title=The Science of Structural Engineering|author=Heyman, Jacques|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Au34lwRovHIC&amp;dq=Leonhard+Euler+Daniel+Bernoulli+Beam+equation|date=1999|publisher=Imperial College Press|isbn=1-86094-189-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Euler-Bernoulli beam equation==
[[File:deflection.svg|thumb|right|Deflection of a cantilever under a point load (f) in engineering]]
{{Main|Euler-Bernoulli beam equation}}

The Euler-Bernoulli beam equation defines the behaviour of a beam element (see below). It is based on five assumptions:

(1) [[continuum mechanics]] is valid for a bending beam&lt;br /&gt;
(2) the [[Stress (physics)|stress]] at a [[Cross section (geometry)|cross section]] varies linearly in the direction of bending, and is zero at the [[centroid]] of every [[Cross section (geometry)|cross section]].&lt;br /&gt;
(3) the bending [[moment (physics)|moment]] at a particular cross section varies linearly with the second derivative of the deflected shape at that location.&lt;br /&gt;
(4) the beam is composed of an isotropic material&lt;br /&gt;(5) the applied load is orthogonal to the beam's neutral axis and acts in a unique plane.

A simplified version of Euler-Bernoulli beam equation is:

:&lt;math&gt;EI \frac{d^4 u}{d x^4} = w(x).\,&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is the deflection and &lt;math&gt;w(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a load per unit length. &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is the [[elastic modulus]] and &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the [[second moment of area]], the product of these giving the [[stiffness]] of the beam.

This equation is very common in engineering practice: it describes the deflection of a uniform, static beam.

Successive derivatives of u have important meaning:

:* &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{u}\,&lt;/math&gt;  is the deflection.

:* &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}}\,&lt;/math&gt;  is the slope of the beam.

:* &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{EI\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}}\,&lt;/math&gt;  is the [[Bending|bending moment]] in the beam.

:* &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{-\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(EI\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}\right)}\,&lt;/math&gt;  is the [[Shearing (physics)|shear force]] in the beam.

A bending moment manifests itself as a tension and a compression force, acting as a [[Couple (mechanics)|couple]] in a beam. The stresses caused by these forces can be represented by:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma = \frac{My}{I} = E y \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the stress, &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the bending moment, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is the distance from the [[neutral axis]] of the beam to the point under consideration and &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the [[second moment of area]]. Often the equation is simplified to the moment divided by the section modulus (S), which is I/y. This equation allows a structural engineer to assess the stress in a structural element when subjected to a bending moment.

==Buckling==
{{Main|Buckling}}
[[File:Buckled column.svg|thumb|A column under a centric axial load exhibiting the characteristic deformation of buckling.]]

When subjected to compressive forces it is possible for structural elements to deform significantly due to the destabilising effect of that load. The effect can be initiated or exacerbated by possible inaccuracies in manufacture or construction.

The Euler buckling formula defines the axial compression force which will cause a [[strut]] (or column) to fail in buckling.

:&lt;math&gt;F=\frac{\pi^2 EI}{(Kl)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; = maximum or critical [[force]] (vertical load on column),
:&lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; = [[modulus of elasticity]],
:&lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; = [[area moment of inertia]], or second moment of area
:&lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; = unsupported length of column,
:&lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; = column effective length factor, whose value depends on the conditions of end support of the column, as follows.
::For both ends pinned (hinged, free to rotate), &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; = 1.0.
::For both ends fixed, &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; = 0.50.
::For one end fixed and the other end pinned, &lt;math&gt;K\approx&lt;/math&gt; 0.70.
::For one end fixed and the other end free to move laterally, &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; = 2.0.

This value is sometimes expressed for design purposes as a critical buckling [[stress (mechanics)|stress]].

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma=\frac{\pi^2 E}{(\frac{Kl}{r})^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; = maximum or critical [[stress (mechanics)|stress]]
:&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; = the least [[radius of gyration]] of the cross section

Other forms of buckling include lateral torsional buckling, where the compression flange of a beam in bending will buckle, and buckling of plate elements in plate girders due to compression in the plane of the plate.

'''Sustainable architecture''' is [[architecture]] that seeks to minimize the negative environmental impact of buildings by efficiency and moderation in the use of materials, energy, and development space and the ecosystem at large. Sustainable architecture uses a conscious approach to energy and ecological conservation in the design of the built environment.&lt;ref&gt;"Sustainable Architecture and Simulation Modelling", Dublin Institute of Technology, [http://www.cebe.heacademy.ac.uk/learning/habitat/HABITAT4/beattie.html#_Toc397853444] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130506035740/http://www.cebe.heacademy.ac.uk/learning/habitat/HABITAT4/beattie.html |date=2013-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of sustainability, or [[ecological design]], is to ensure that our actions and decisions today do not inhibit the opportunities of future generations.&lt;ref&gt;Doerr Architecture, Definition of Sustainability and the Impacts of Buildings [http://www.doerr.org/services/sustainability.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sustainable energy use==
{{Main|Low-energy house|Zero-energy building}}
[[File:K2 apartments windsor.jpg|thumb|K2 sustainable apartments in [[Windsor, Victoria]], Australia by DesignInc (2006) features [[passive solar building design|passive solar design]], recycled and sustainable materials, [[photovoltaic cells]], [[wastewater]] treatment, [[Rainwater harvesting|rainwater collection]] and [[solar hot water]].]]

Shown is the town's new art center, which integrates its own solar panels and wind generators for energy self-sufficiency.]]

[[Efficient energy use|Energy efficiency]] over the entire life cycle of a building is the most important goal of sustainable architecture. [[Architect]]s use many different passive and active techniques to reduce the energy needs of buildings and increase their ability to capture or generate their own energy.&lt;ref name ="DeKayBrown"&gt;M. DeKay &amp; G.Z. Brown, Sun Wind &amp; Light, architectural design strategies, 3rd ed. ''Wiley'', 2014&lt;/ref&gt; One of the keys to exploit local environmental resources and influence energy-related factors such as daylight, solar heat gains and ventilation is the use of [[site analysis]].

===Heating, ventilation and cooling system efficiency===
Numerous passive architectural strategies have been developed over time. Examples of such strategies include the arrangement of rooms or the sizing and orientation of windows in a building,&lt;ref name ="DeKayBrown" /&gt; and the orientation of facades and streets or the ratio between building heights and street widths for urban planning.&lt;ref name ="Montavon"&gt;M. Montavon, Optimization of Urban Form by the Evaluation of the Solar Potential, ''EPFL'', 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

An important and [[Cost-effectiveness|cost-effective]] element of an efficient [[HVAC|heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC)]] system is a [[Building insulation|well-insulated building]]. A more efficient building requires less heat generating or dissipating power, but may require more ventilation capacity to expel [[indoor air quality|polluted indoor air]].

Significant amounts of energy are flushed out of buildings in the water, air and [[compost]] streams. [[Commercial off-the-shelf|Off the shelf]], on-site energy recycling technologies can effectively recapture [[Waste-to-energy|energy from waste]] hot water and stale air and transfer that energy into incoming fresh cold water or fresh air. Recapture of energy for uses other than gardening from compost leaving buildings requires centralized [[anaerobic digestion|anaerobic digesters]].

HVAC systems are powered by motors. [[Copper]], versus other metal conductors, helps to improve the electrical energy efficiencies of motors, thereby enhancing the sustainability of electrical building components. 

Site and building orientation have some major effects on a building's HVAC efficiency.

[[Passive solar building design]] allows buildings to harness the energy of the sun efficiently without the use of any [[active solar]] mechanisms such as [[photovoltaic cell]]s or [[solar hot water|solar hot water panels]]. Typically [[passive solar]] building designs incorporate materials with high [[thermal mass]] that retain heat effectively and strong [[Thermal insulation|insulation]] that works to prevent heat escape. Low energy designs also requires the use of solar shading, by means of awnings, blinds or shutters, to relieve the solar heat gain in summer and to reduce the need for artificial cooling.  In addition, [[low energy building]]s typically have a very low surface area to volume ratio to minimize heat loss. This means that sprawling multi-winged building designs (often thought to look more "organic") are often avoided in favor of more centralized structures. Traditional cold climate buildings such as [[United States|American]] [[American colonial architecture|colonial]] [[saltbox]] designs provide a good historical model for centralized heat efficiency in a small-scale building.

Windows are placed to maximize the input of heat-creating light while minimizing the loss of heat through glass, a poor insulator. In the [[Northern Hemisphere|northern hemisphere]] this usually involves installing a large number of south-facing windows to collect direct sun and severely restricting the number of north-facing windows. Certain window types, such as double or triple glazed [[insulated glazing|insulated windows]] with gas filled spaces and [[Low-emissivity|low emissivity (low-E)]] coatings, provide much better insulation than single-pane glass windows. Preventing excess solar gain by means of solar shading devices in the summer months is important to reduce cooling needs.  [[Deciduous trees]] are often planted in front of windows to block excessive sun in summer with their leaves but allow light through in winter when their leaves fall off.  Louvers or light shelves are installed to allow the sunlight in during the winter (when the sun is lower in the sky) and keep it out in the summer (when the sun is high in the sky).  [[Coniferous]] or [[Evergreen|evergreen plants]] are often planted to the north of buildings to shield against cold north winds.

In colder climates, heating systems are a primary focus for sustainable architecture because they are typically one of the largest single energy drains in buildings.

In warmer climates where cooling is a primary concern, passive solar designs can also be very effective. Masonry [[building material]]s with [[high thermal mass]] are very valuable for retaining the cool temperatures of night throughout the day. In addition builders often opt for sprawling single story structures in order to maximize surface area and heat loss.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} Buildings are often designed to capture and channel existing winds, particularly the especially cool winds coming from nearby [[Body of water|bodies of water]]. Many of these valuable strategies are employed in some way by the [[Vernacular architecture|traditional architecture]] of warm regions, such as south-western mission buildings.

In climates with four seasons, an integrated energy system will increase in efficiency: when the building is well insulated, when it is sited to work with the forces of nature, when heat is recaptured (to be used immediately or stored), when the heat plant relying on [[fossil fuel]]s or electricity is greater than 100% efficient, and when [[renewable energy]] is used.

===Renewable energy generation===

====Solar panels====
{{Main|Solar PV}}
[[Active solar]] devices such as [[photovoltaic]] [[Photovoltaic module|solar panel]]s help to provide sustainable electricity for any use. Electrical output of a solar panel is dependent on orientation, efficiency, latitude, and climate—solar gain varies even at the same latitude. Typical efficiencies for commercially available PV panels range from 4% to 28%. The low efficiency of certain photovoltaic panels can significantly affect the payback period of their installation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=shamilton |url=http://www.solarbuzz.com/Moduleprices.htm |title=Module Pricing |publisher=Solarbuzz |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This low efficiency does not mean that solar panels are not a viable energy alternative. In Germany for example, Solar Panels are commonly installed in residential home construction.

Roofs are often angled toward the sun to allow photovoltaic panels to collect at maximum efficiency. In the northern hemisphere, a true-south facing orientation maximizes yield for solar panels. If true-south is not possible, solar panels can produce adequate energy if aligned within 30° of south. However, at higher latitudes, winter energy yield will be significantly reduced for non-south orientation.

To maximize efficiency in winter, the collector can be angled above horizontal Latitude +15°. To maximize efficiency in summer, the angle should be Latitude -15°. However, for an annual maximum production, the angle of the panel above horizontal should be equal to its latitude.&lt;ref&gt;G.Z. Brown, Mark DeKay. Sun, Wind &amp; Light. 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wind turbines====
{{Main|Wind power}}
The use of undersized wind turbines in energy production in sustainable structures requires the consideration of many factors. In considering costs, small wind systems are generally more expensive than larger wind turbines relative to the amount of energy they produce. For small wind turbines, maintenance costs can be a deciding factor at sites with marginal wind-harnessing capabilities. At low-wind sites, maintenance can consume much of a small wind turbine's revenue.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Brower, Michael; ''Cool Energy, The Renewable Solution to Global Warming''; Union of Concerned Scientists, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Wind turbines begin operating when winds reach 8&amp;nbsp;mph, achieve energy production capacity at speeds of 32-37&amp;nbsp;mph, and shut off to avoid damage at speeds exceeding 55&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The energy potential of a wind turbine is proportional to the square of the length of its blades and to the cube of the speed at which its blades spin. Though wind turbines are available that can supplement power for a single building, because of these factors, the efficiency of the wind turbine depends much upon the wind conditions at the building site. For these reasons, for wind turbines to be at all efficient, they must be installed at locations that are known to receive a constant amount of wind (with average wind speeds of more than 15&amp;nbsp;mph), rather than locations that receive wind sporadically.&lt;ref&gt;Gipe, Paul; ''Wind Power: Renewable Energy for Farm and Business''; Chelsea Green Publishing, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; A small wind turbine can be installed on a roof. Installation issues then include the strength of the roof, vibration, and the turbulence caused by the roof ledge. Small-scale rooftop wind turbines have been known to be able to generate power from 10% to up to 25% of the electricity required of a regular domestic household dwelling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article706123.ece The Sunday Times, "Home wind turbines dealt killer blow"], April 16, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Turbines for residential scale use are usually between 7 feet (2 m) to 25 feet (8 m) in diameter and produce electricity at a rate of 900 watts to 10,000 watts at their tested wind speed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rapidcityjournal.com "Wind turbine, a powerful investment", Rapid City Journal], February 20, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Building integrated wind turbine performance can be enhanced with the addition of an aerofoil wing on top of a roof mounted turbine.&lt;ref&gt;Factors enhancing aerofoil wings for wind energy harnessing in buildings,7 November 2013 http://bse.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/11/07/0143624413509097.abstract?papetoc&lt;/ref&gt;

====Solar water heating====
{{Main|Solar thermal power}}
[[Solar water heater]]s, also called solar domestic hot water systems, can be a cost-effective way to generate hot water for a home. They can be used in any climate, and the fuel they use—sunshine—is free.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Solar Water Heaters, March 24, 2009 [http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/water_heating/index.cfm/mytopic=12850]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two types of solar water systems- active and passive. An active solar collector system can produce about 80 to 100 gallons of hot water per day. A passive system will have a lower capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toolbase.org/Technology-Inventory/Plumbing/solar-water-heaters |title=Solar Water Heaters |publisher=Toolbase.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130415230351/http://www.toolbase.org/Technology-Inventory/Plumbing/solar-water-heaters |archivedate=2013-04-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also two types of circulation, direct circulation systems and indirect circulation systems. Direct circulation systems loop the domestic water through the panels. They should not be used in climates with temperatures below freezing. Indirect circulation loops glycol or some other fluid through the solar panels and uses a heat exchanger to heat up the domestic water.

The two most common types of collector panels are Flat-Plate and Evacuated-tube. The two work similarly except that evacuated tubes do not convectively lose heat, which greatly improves their efficiency (5%-25% more efficient). With these higher efficiencies, Evacuated-tube solar collectors can also produce higher-temperature space heating, and even higher temperatures for absorption cooling systems.&lt;ref name="Gilbert M. Masters 2008"&gt;John Randolph and Gilbert M. Masters, 2008. "Energy for Sustainability: Technology, Planning, Policy," Island Press, Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt;

Electric-resistance water heaters that are common in homes today have an electrical demand around 4500&amp;nbsp;kW·h/year. With the use of solar collectors, the energy use is cut in half. The up-front cost of installing solar collectors is high, but with the annual energy savings, payback periods are relatively short.&lt;ref name="Gilbert M. Masters 2008"/&gt;

====Heat pumps====
Air-source heat pumps (ASHP) can be thought of as reversible air conditioners. Like an air conditioner, an ASHP can take heat from a relatively cool space (e.g. a house at 70&amp;nbsp;°F) and dump it into a hot place (e.g. outside at 85&amp;nbsp;°F). However, unlike an air conditioner, the condenser and evaporator of an ASHP can switch roles and absorb heat from the cool outside air and dump it into a warm house.

Air-source heat pumps are inexpensive relative to other heat pump systems. However, the efficiency of air-source heat pumps decline when the outdoor temperature is very cold or very hot; therefore, they are only really applicable in temperate climates.&lt;ref name="Gilbert M. Masters 2008"/&gt;

For areas not located in temperate climates, ground-source (or geothermal) heat pumps provide an efficient alternative. The difference between the two heat pumps is that the ground-source has one of its heat exchangers placed underground—usually in a horizontal or vertical arrangement. Ground-source takes advantage of the relatively constant, mild temperatures underground, which means their efficiencies can be much greater than that of an air-source heat pump. The in-ground heat exchanger generally needs a considerable amount of area. Designers have placed them in an open area next to the building or underneath a parking lot.

Energy Star ground-source heat pumps can be 40% to 60% more efficient than their air-source counterparts. They are also quieter and can also be applied to other functions like domestic hot water heating.&lt;ref name="Gilbert M. Masters 2008"/&gt;

In terms of initial cost, the ground-source heat pump system costs about twice as much as a standard air-source heat pump to be installed. However, the up-front costs can be more than offset by the decrease in energy costs. The reduction in energy costs is especially apparent in areas with typically hot summers and cold winters.&lt;ref name="Gilbert M. Masters 2008"/&gt;

Other types of heat pumps are water-source and air-earth. If the building is located near a body of water, the pond or lake could be used as a heat source or sink. Air-earth heat pumps circulate the building's air through underground ducts. With higher fan power requirements and inefficient heat transfer, Air-earth heat pumps are generally not practical for major construction.

==Sustainable building materials==
{{See also|Green building}}
Some examples of sustainable building materials include recycled [[denim]] or blown-in fiber glass insulation, sustainably harvested wood, [[Trass]], [[Linoleum]],&lt;ref&gt;Duurzaam en Gezond Bouwen en Wonen by Hugo Vanderstadt,&lt;/ref&gt; sheep wool, [[concrete]] (high and ultra high performance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1864315,00.html|title=Building Materials: Cementing the Future|first=PETER|last=GUMBEL|date=4 December 2008|publisher=|via=www.time.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; roman self-healing concrete&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4020-6250-6_9|title=Self Healing Materials|first=Henk M.|last=Jonkers|date=23 March 2018|publisher=Springer, Dordrecht|pages=195–204|via=link.springer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;), panels made from paper flakes, baked earth, rammed earth, clay, vermiculite, flax linnen, sisal, seegrass, expanded clay grains, coconut, wood fiber plates, calcium sand stone, locally obtained stone and rock, and [[bamboo]], which is one of the strongest and fastest growing [[woody plant]]s, and non-toxic low-[[Volatile Organic Compound|VOC]] glues and paints. Vegetative cover or shield over building envelopes also helps in the same. Paper which is fabricated or manufactured out of forest wood is supposedly hundred percent recyclable .thus it regenerates and saves almost all the forest wood that it takes during its manufacturing process.

===Recycled materials===

[[File:Discarded dreams 2 of 3.jpg|thumb|Recycling items for building]]
Sustainable architecture often incorporates the use of recycled or second hand materials, such as [[reclaimed lumber]] and [[Copper in architecture|recycled copper]]. The reduction in use of new materials creates a corresponding reduction in [[embodied energy]] (energy used in the production of materials). Often sustainable architects attempt to retrofit old structures to serve new needs in order to avoid unnecessary development.  Architectural salvage and reclaimed materials are used when appropriate. When older buildings are demolished, frequently any good wood is reclaimed, renewed, and sold as flooring. Any good [[dimension stone]] is similarly reclaimed.  Many other parts are reused as well, such as doors, windows, mantels, and hardware, thus reducing the consumption of new goods.  When new materials are employed, green designers look for materials that are rapidly replenished, such as [[bamboo]], which can be harvested for commercial use after only 6 years of growth, [[sorghum]] or wheat straw, both of which are waste material that can be pressed into panels, or [[cork oak]], in which only the outer bark is removed for use, thus preserving the tree.  When possible, building materials may be gleaned from the site itself; for example, if a new structure is being constructed in a wooded area, wood from the trees which were cut to make room for the building would be re-used as part of the building itself.

===Lower volatile organic compounds===

Low-impact building materials are used wherever feasible: for example, insulation may be made from low VOC ([[volatile organic compound]])-emitting materials such as [[Building insulation materials#Cotton batts (Blue Jean)|recycled denim]] or [[cellulose insulation]], rather than the [[building insulation materials]] that may contain carcinogenic or toxic materials such as formaldehyde. To discourage insect damage, these alternate insulation materials may be treated with [[boric acid]]. Organic or milk-based paints may be used.&lt;ref&gt;Information on low-emitting materials may be found at www.buildingecology.com/iaq_links.php [http://www.buildingecology.com/iaq_links.php IAQ links] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611163251/http://www.buildingecology.com/iaq_links.php |date=2008-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a common fallacy is that "green" materials are always better for the health of occupants or the environment. Many harmful substances (including formaldehyde, arsenic, and asbestos) are naturally occurring and are not without their histories of use with the best of intentions. A study of emissions from materials by the State of California has shown that there are some green materials that have substantial emissions whereas some more "traditional" materials actually were lower emitters. Thus, the subject of emissions must be carefully investigated before concluding that natural materials are always the healthiest alternatives for occupants and for the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Building Emissions Study accessed at [http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/GreenBuilding/Specs/Section01350/METStudy.htm California Integrated Waste Management web site]&lt;/ref&gt;

Volatile organic compounds (VOC) can be found in any indoor environment coming from a variety of different sources. VOCs have a high vapor pressure and low water solubility, and are suspected of causing [[sick building syndrome]] type symptoms. This is because many VOCs have been known to cause sensory irritation and central nervous system symptoms characteristic to sick building syndrome, indoor concentrations of VOCs are higher than in the outdoor atmosphere, and when there are many VOCs present, they can cause additive and multiplicative effects.

Green products are usually considered to contain fewer VOCs and be better for human and environmental health.   A case study conducted by the Department of Civil, Architectural, and Environmental Engineering at the University of Miami that compared three green products and their non-green counterparts found that even though both the green products and the non-green counterparts both emitted levels of VOCs, the amount and intensity of the VOCs emitted from the green products were much safer and comfortable for human exposure.&lt;ref&gt;James, J.P., Yang, X. Indoor and Built Environment, Emissions of Volatile Organic Compounds from Several Green and Non-Green Building Materials: A Comparison, January 2004.[http://ibe.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/14/1/69] Retrieved: 2008-04-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Materials sustainability standards===
Despite the importance of materials to overall building sustainability, quantifying and evaluating the sustainability of building materials has proven difficult. There is little coherence in the measurement and assessment of materials sustainability attributes, resulting in a landscape today that is littered with hundreds of competing, inconsistent and often imprecise eco-labels, [[Technical standard|standards]] and [[certifications]].  This discord has led both to confusion among consumers and commercial purchasers and to the incorporation of inconsistent sustainability criteria in larger building certification programs such as [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]].  Various proposals have been made regarding rationalization of the standardization landscape for sustainable building materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=1944523|title=Toward a Rational Framework for Sustainable Building Materials Standards|first1=Jorge L.|last1=Contreras|first2=Hannah|last2=Roth|first3=Meghan|last3=Lewis|date=1 September 2011|publisher=|via=papers.ssrn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Waste management==
Waste takes the form of spent or useless materials generated from households and businesses, construction and demolition processes, and manufacturing and agricultural industries. These materials are loosely categorized as municipal solid waste, construction and demolition (C&amp;D) debris, and industrial or agricultural by-products.&lt;ref&gt;John Ringel., University of Michigan, Sustainable Architecture, Waste Prevention [http://www.umich.edu/~nppcpub/resources/compendia/ARCHpdfs/ARCHr&amp;rA.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;  Sustainable architecture focuses on the on-site use of [[waste management]], incorporating things such as [[grey water]] systems for use on garden beds, and [[composting toilet]]s to reduce sewage. These methods, when combined with on-site food waste composting and off-site recycling, can reduce a house's waste to a small amount of packaging waste. 

==Building placement==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}
One central and often ignored aspect of sustainable architecture is building placement. Although the ideal environmental home or office structure is often envisioned as an isolated place, this kind of placement is usually detrimental to the environment. First, such structures often serve as the unknowing frontlines of [[Urban sprawl|suburban sprawl]]. Second, they usually increase the [[energy consumption]] required for transportation and lead to unnecessary auto emissions. Ideally, most building should avoid suburban sprawl in favor of the kind of light [[Urban planning|urban development]] articulated by the [[New Urbanist]] movement. Careful mixed use zoning can make commercial, residential, and light industrial areas more accessible for those traveling by foot, bicycle, or public transit, as proposed in the [[Principles of Intelligent Urbanism]]. The study of [[Permaculture]], in its holistic application, can also greatly help in proper building placement that minimizes energy consumption and works with the surroundings rather than against them, especially in rural and forested zones.

==Sustainable building consulting==
A sustainable building consultant may be engaged early in the design process, to forecast the sustainability implications of [[building materials]], orientation, glazing and other physical factors, so as to identify a sustainable approach that meets the specific requirements of a project.

Norms and standards have been formalized by performance-based rating systems e.g. [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usgbc.org/?CategoryID=19|title=U.S. Green Building Council|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Energy Star]] for homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energystar.gov/|title=ENERGY STAR - The Simple Choice for Energy Efficiency|website=www.energystar.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; They define [[Benchmarking|benchmarks]] to be met and provide [[Performance metric|metrics]] and testing to meet those benchmarks. It is up to the parties involved in the project to determine the best approach to meet those standards.

==Changing pedagogues==

Critics of the reductionism of modernism often noted the abandonment of the teaching of architectural history as a causal factor. The fact that a number of the major players in the shift away from modernism were trained at Princeton University's School of Architecture, where recourse to history continued to be a part of design training in the 1940s and 1950s, was significant. The increasing rise of interest in history had a profound impact on architectural education. History courses became more typical and regularized. With the demand for professors knowledgeable in the history of architecture, several PhD programs in schools of architecture arose in order to differentiate themselves from art history PhD programs, where architectural historians had previously trained. In the US, [[MIT]] and [[Cornell]] were the first, created in the mid-1970s, followed by [[Columbia University|Columbia]], [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]], and [[Princeton University|Princeton]]. Among the founders of new architectural history programs were [[Bruno Zevi]] at the Institute for the History of Architecture in Venice, Stanford Anderson and Henry Millon at MIT, Alexander Tzonis at the [[Architectural Association]], Anthony Vidler at Princeton, [[Manfredo Tafuri]] at the University of Venice, [[Kenneth Frampton]] at [[Columbia University]], and Werner Oechslin and Kurt Forster at [[ETH Zürich]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Jarzombek]], “The Disciplinary Dislocations of Architectural History,” ''Journal of the [[Society of Architectural Historians]]'' 58/3 (September 1999), p. 489. See also other articles in that issue by Eve Blau, Stanford Anderson, Alina Payne, Daniel Bluestone, Jeon-Louis Cohen and others.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term “sustainability” in relation to architecture has so far been mostly considered through the lens of building technology and its transformations. Going beyond the technical sphere of “green” design, invention and expertise, some scholars are starting to position architecture within a much broader cultural framework of the [[Nature#Human interrelationship|human interrelationship with nature]]. Adopting this framework allows tracing a rich history of cultural debates about our relationship to nature and the environment, from the point of view of different historical and geographical contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McGrath|first=Brian|title=Urban Design Ecologies: AD Reader|date=2013|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|isbn=978-0-470-97405-6|pages=220–237|url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470974052.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sustainable urbanism and architecture==
Concurrently, the recent movements of [[New Urbanism]] and [[New Classical Architecture]] promote a sustainable approach towards construction, that appreciates and develops [[smart growth]], [[Vernacular architecture|architectural tradition]] and [[Classical architecture|classical design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnu.org/charter|title=The Charter of the New Urbanism|first=|last=taotiadmin|date=20 April 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beauty, Humanism, Continuity between Past and Future|url=http://www.traditionalarchitecture.co.uk/aims.html|publisher=Traditional Architecture Group|accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This in contrast to [[Modern architecture|modernist]] and [[International Style (architecture)|globally uniform]] architecture, as well as leaning against solitary [[housing estate]]s and [[Urban sprawl|suburban sprawl]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aia.org/SiteObjects/files/smartgrowth05.pdf Issue Brief: Smart-Growth: Building Livable Communities]. American Institute of Architects. Retrieved on 2014-03-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Both trends started in the 1980s. The [[Driehaus Architecture Prize]] is an award that recognizes efforts in New Urbanism and New Classical Architecture, and is endowed with a prize money twice as high as that of the modernist [[Pritzker Architecture Prize|Pritzker Prize]].&lt;ref name="Driehaus Prize"&gt;{{cite web|title=Driehaus Prize|url=http://architecture.nd.edu/about/driehaus-prize/|work=''Together, the $200,000 Driehaus Prize and the $50,000 Reed Award represent the most significant recognition for classicism in the contemporary built environment.''|publisher=Notre Dame School of Architecture|accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
There are conflicting ethical, engineering, and political orientations depending on the viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= Sustainability - Architecture: between Fuzzy Systems and Wicked Problems |author= [[Mark Jarzombek]]| journal=  Blueprints  | url= http://web.mit.edu/mmj4/www/downloads/blueprints21_1.pdf | volume=21 | issue=1 | pages=6–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no doubt Green Technology has made its headway into the architectural community, the implementation of given technologies have changed the ways we see and perceive modern day architecture. While green architecture has been proven to show great improvements of ways of living both environmentally and technologically the question remains, is all this sustainable? Many building codes have been demeaned to international standards. "LEED" (Leadership in Energy &amp; Environmental Design) has been criticized for exercising flexible codes for building to follow. Contractors do this to save as much money as they possibly can. For example, a building may have solar paneling but if the infrastructure of the building's core doesn't support that over a long period of time improvements would have to be made on a constant basis and the building itself would be vulnerable to disasters or enhancements. With companies cutting paths to make shortcuts with sustainable architecture when building their structures it fuels to the irony that the "sustainable" architecture isn't sustainable at all. Sustainability comes in reference to longevity and effectiveness. 

Ethics and Politics also play into sustainable architecture and its ability to grow in urban environment. Conflicting viewpoints between engineering techniques and environmental impacts still are popular issues that resonate in the architectural community. With every revolutionary technology or innovation there comes criticisms of legitimacy and effectiveness when and how it is being utilized. Many of the criticisms of sustainable architecture do not reflect every aspect of it but rather a broader spectrum across the international community.

'''Sustainable development''' is the [[organizing principle]] for meeting [[Human development (humanity)|human development]] goals while at the same time [[Sustainability|sustaining]] the ability of natural systems to provide the [[natural resource]]s and [[ecosystem services]] upon which the [[economy]] and [[society]] depend. The desired result is a state of society where living conditions and resource use continue to meet human needs without undermining the integrity and stability of the natural system. Sustainable development can be classified as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations.

While the modern concept of sustainable development is derived mostly from the 1987 [[Brundtland Commission|Brundtland Report]], it is also rooted in earlier ideas about [[sustainable forest management]] and twentieth century environmental concerns. As the concept developed, it has shifted to focus more on [[economic development]], [[Social change|social development]] and environmental protection for future generations. It has been suggested that "the term 'sustainability' should be viewed as humanity's target goal of human-ecosystem equilibrium (homeostasis), while 'sustainable development' refers to the holistic approach and temporal processes that lead us to the end point of sustainability".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Shaker |first=Richard Ross |date=September 2015 |title=The spatial distribution of development in Europe and its underlying sustainability correlations |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143622815001745 |journal=Applied Geography |volume=63 |pages=&lt;!-- 304–314 --&gt; |at=p. 35 |doi=10.1016/j.apgeog.2015.07.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern economies are endeavouring to reconcile ambitious economic development and obligations of preserving the [[natural resource]]s and [[Ecosystem services|ecosystem]], the two are traditionally seen as of conflicting nature. Instead of holding climate change commitments and other sustainability measures as a drug to economic development, turning and leveraging them into market opportunities will do greater good. The economic development brought by such organized principles and practices in an [[economy]] is called Managed Sustainable Development (MSD).

The concept of sustainable development has been—and still is—subject to criticism, including the question of what is to be sustained in sustainable development. It has been argued{{weasel inline|date=October 2018}} that there is no such thing as a sustainable use of a [[non-renewable resource]], since any positive rate of exploitation will eventually lead to the exhaustion of earth's finite stock. The United Nations organized an international conference in Stockholm, Sweden from 5 to 16 June 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un-documents.net/unchedec.htm|title=Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment - A/CONF.48/14/Rev.1 Chapter I - UN Documents: Gathering a body of global agreements|last=Environment|first=United Nations Conference on the Human|website=www.un-documents.net|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|Sustainability|History of sustainability}}
[[File:The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|right|220px|thumb|[[The Blue Marble]] photograph, taken from [[Apollo 17]] on 7 December 1972, quickly became an icon of [[environmental conservation]].&lt;ref name="Blewitt-2015"/&gt;{{RP|7}}]]
Sustainability can be defined as the practice of maintaining processes of productivity indefinitely—natural or human made—by replacing resources used with resources of equal or greater value without degrading or endangering natural biotic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Communicating Sustainability for the Green Economy|publisher=M.E.

[[Sustainability science]] is the study of the concepts of sustainable development and environmental science. There is an additional focus on the present generations' responsibility to regenerate, maintain and improve planetary resources for use by future generations.&lt;ref name=Finn-2009&gt;{{cite book|last=Finn|first=Donovan|title=Our Uncertain Future: Can Good Planning Create Sustainable Communities?|publisher=University of Illinois|location=Champaign-Urbana|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|3-8}}

Sustainable development has its roots in ideas about [[sustainable forest management]] which were developed in Europe during the 17th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref name="Grober2"&gt;Ulrich Grober: Deep roots&amp;nbsp;— A conceptual history of "sustainable development" (Nachhaltigkeit), Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin für Sozialforschung, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blewitt-2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blewitt|first1=John|title=Understanding Sustainable Development|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780415707824|edition=2nd|url=https://www.routledge.com/Understanding-Sustainable-Development-2nd-Edition/Blewitt/p/book/9780415707824|accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|6-16}} In response to a growing awareness of the depletion of timber resources in England, [[John Evelyn]] argued that "sowing and planting of trees had to be regarded as a national duty of every landowner, in order to stop the destructive over-exploitation of natural resources" in his 1662 essay ''[[Sylva, or A Discourse of Forest-Trees and the Propagation of Timber|Sylva]]''. In 1713 [[Hans Carl von Carlowitz]], a senior mining administrator in the service of Elector [[Augustus II the Strong|Frederick Augustus I of Saxony]] published ''Sylvicultura oeconomica'', a 400-page work on forestry. Building upon the ideas of Evelyn and French minister [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]], von Carlowitz developed the concept of managing forests for [[sustained yield]].&lt;ref name="Grober2" /&gt; His work influenced others, including [[Alexander von Humboldt]] and [[Georg Ludwig Hartig]], eventually leading to the development of a science of forestry. This in turn influenced people like [[Gifford Pinchot]], first head of the [[US Forest Service]], whose approach to forest management was driven by the idea of wise use of resources, and [[Aldo Leopold]] whose [[land ethic]] was influential in the development of the [[environmental movement]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Grober2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Blewitt-2015"/&gt;

Following the publication of [[Rachel Carson]]'s ''[[Silent Spring]]'' in 1962, the developing environmental movement drew attention to the relationship between economic growth and development and environmental degradation. [[Kenneth E. Boulding]] in his influential 1966 essay ''The Economics of the Coming Spaceship Earth'' identified the need for the economic system to fit itself to the ecological system with its limited pools of resources.&lt;ref name="Blewitt-2015"/&gt; One of the first uses of the term sustainable in the contemporary sense was by the [[Club of Rome]] in 1972 in its classic report on the ''[[Limits to Growth]]'', written by a group of scientists led by [[Dennis Meadows|Dennis]] and [[Donella Meadows]] of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. Describing the desirable "state of global equilibrium", the authors wrote: "We are searching for a model output that represents a world system that is sustainable without sudden and uncontrolled collapse and capable of satisfying the basic material requirements of all of its people."&lt;ref name=Finn-2009/&gt;

Following the Club of Rome report, an MIT research group prepared ten days of hearings on "[http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/MIT/Growth%20and%20Its%20Implications.pdf Growth and Its Implication for the Future]" (Roundtable Press, 1973)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/MIT/Growth%20and%20Its%20Implications.pdf|title=Growth and its implications for the future|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the US Congress, the first hearings ever held on sustainable development.

Since the Brundtland Report, the concept of sustainable development has developed beyond the initial intergenerational framework to focus more on the goal of "socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable economic growth".&lt;ref name=Sachs-2015/&gt;{{RP|5}} In 1992, the [[UN Conference on Environment and Development]] published the [[Earth Charter]], which outlines the building of a just, sustainable, and peaceful global society in the 21st century. The action plan [[Agenda 21]] for sustainable development identified information, integration, and participation as key building blocks to help countries achieve development that recognises these interdependent pillars. It emphasises that in sustainable development everyone is a user and provider of information. It stresses the need to change from old sector-centered ways of doing business to new approaches that involve cross-sectoral co-ordination and the integration of environmental and social concerns into all development processes. Furthermore, Agenda 21 emphasises that broad public participation in decision making is a fundamental prerequisite for achieving sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;Will Allen. 2007.[http://learningforsustainability.net/susdev/ "Learning for Sustainability: Sustainable Development."]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the principles of the [[United Nations Charter]] the [[United Nations Millennium Declaration|Millennium Declaration]] identified principles and treaties on sustainable development, including [[economic development]], [[Social change|social development]] and [[environmental protection]]. Broadly defined, sustainable development is a systems approach to growth and development and to manage natural, produced, and [[social capital]] for the welfare of their own and future generations. The term sustainable development as used by the United Nations incorporates both issues associated with [[land development]] and broader issues of [[Human development (humanity)|human development]] such as education, public health, and standard of living.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)==
In September 2015, the United Nations General Assembly formally adopted the "universal, integrated and transformative" [https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdgs 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development], a set of 17 [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs). The goals are to be implemented and achieved in every country from the year 2016 to 2030.

Sustainable development, or sustainability, has been described in terms of three spheres, dimensions, domains or pillars, i.e. the environment, the economy and society. The three-sphere framework was initially proposed by the economist René Passet in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4RFOAQAAIAAJ|title=L'Économique et le vivant|last=Passet|first=René|date=1979-01-01|publisher=Payot|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been worded as "economic, environmental and social" or "ecology, economy and equity".&lt;ref name="Global Sustainability Report"&gt;{{cite book|last=United Nations|title=Prototype Global Sustainable Development Report|publisher=United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Division for Sustainable Development|location=New York|date=2014|edition=Online unedited|url=http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/globalsdreport/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been expanded by some authors to include a fourth pillar of culture, institutions or governance,&lt;ref name="Global Sustainability Report"/&gt; or alternatively reconfigured as four domains of the social - ecology, economics, politics and culture,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= with Magee | first2= Liam | last3= Scerri | first3= Andy | last4= Steger | first4= Manfred B. | title= Urban Sustainability in Theory and Practice: Circles of Sustainability | url= https://www.academia.edu/9294719/Urban_Sustainability_in_Theory_and_Practice_Circles_of_Sustainability_2015_ | year= 2015 | publisher= Routledge | location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus bringing economics back inside the social, and treating ecology as the intersection of the social and the natural.&lt;ref&gt;[http://citiesprogramme.com/archives/resource/circles-of-sustainability-urban-profile-process Circles of Sustainability Urban Profile Process] and {{Cite journal | year=2010 | first1= Andy |last1= Scerri | first2= Paul |  last2= James | authorlink2= Paul James (academic) | title= Accounting for sustainability: Combining qualitative and quantitative research in developing ‘indicators’ of sustainability | url= https://www.academia.edu/3230887/Accounting_for_Sustainability_Combining_Qualitative_and_Quantitative_Research_in_Developing_Indicators | journal= International Journal of Social Research Methodology | volume= 13 | issue= 1 | pages= 41–53 | doi=10.1080/13645570902864145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental sustainability concerns the [[natural environment]] and how it endures and remains diverse and productive. Since [[natural resources]] are derived from the environment, the state of air, water, and the climate are of particular concern. The [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report]] outlines current knowledge about scientific, technical and socio-economic information concerning [[climate change]], and lists options for [[Adaptation to global warming|adaptation]] and [[Climate change mitigation|mitigation]].&lt;ref name="Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental sustainability requires society to design activities to meet human needs while preserving the life support systems of the planet. This, for example, entails using water sustainably, utilizing renewable energy, and sustainable material supplies (e.g. harvesting wood from forests at a rate that maintains the biomass and biodiversity).{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

An unsustainable situation occurs when [[natural capital]] (the sum total of nature's resources) is used up faster than it can be replenished. Sustainability requires that human activity only uses nature's resources at a rate at which they can be replenished naturally. Inherently the concept of sustainable development is intertwined with the concept of carrying capacity. Theoretically, the long-term result of [[environmental degradation]] is the inability to sustain human life.  Such degradation on a global scale should imply an increase in human death rate until population falls to what the degraded environment can support.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}  If the degradation continues beyond a certain [[Planetary boundaries|tipping point]] or critical threshold it would lead to eventual [[extinction]] for humanity.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Integral elements for a sustainable development are research and innovation activities. A telling example is the [[European environmental research and innovation policy]], which aims at defining and implementing a transformative agenda to greening the economy and the society as a whole so to achieve a truly sustainable development. Research and innovation in Europe is financially supported by the programme [[Horizon 2020]], which is also open to participation worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;See Horizon 2020 – the EU's new research and innovation programme http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-1085_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt; A promising direction towards sustainable development is to design systems that are flexible and reversible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09613218.2012.702565|date=2012 | doi=10.1080/09613218.2012.702565 | volume=40 |title=Flexible strategies for long-term sustainability under uncertainty |journal=Building Research |pages=545–557 | last1 = Fawcett | first1 = William | last2 = Hughes | first2 = Martin | last3 = Krieg | first3 = Hannes | last4 = Albrecht | first4 = Stefan | last5 = Vennström | first5 = Anders}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vladan_Babovic/publication/269694158_HYDRO-D-09-00078/links/54925b6a0cf2484a3f3e0c41.pdf |last=Zhang|first=S.X.|author2=V.

Pollution of the public resources is really not a different action, it just is a reverse tragedy of the commons, in that instead of taking something out, something is put into the commons.  When the costs of polluting the commons are not calculated into the cost of the items consumed, then it becomes only natural to pollute, as the cost of pollution is external to the cost of the goods produced and the cost of cleaning the waste before it is discharged exceeds the cost of releasing the waste directly into the commons.  So, the only way to solve this problem is by protecting the ecology of the commons by making it, through taxes or fines, more costly to release the waste directly into the commons than would be the cost of cleaning the waste before discharge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Economics, Ecology, Ethics: Essays toward a Steady-State Economy|last=Daly|first=H. E.|publisher=W. H. Freeman and Company|others=Hardin, G. "The tragedy of the commons"|year=|isbn=|location=New York and San Francisco|pages=100–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So, one can try to appeal to the ethics of the situation by doing the right thing as an individual, but in the absence of any direct consequences, the individual will tend to do what is best for the person and not what is best for the common good of the public.  Once again, this issue needs to be addressed.  Because, left unaddressed, the development of the commonly owned property will become impossible to achieve in a sustainable way.  So, this topic is central to the understanding of creating a sustainable situation from the management of the public resources that are used for personal use.

====Agriculture====
{{See also|Sustainable agriculture}}
Sustainable agriculture consists of [[environment friendly]] methods of farming that allow the production of crops or livestock without damage to human or natural systems. It involves preventing adverse effects to soil, water, biodiversity, surrounding or downstream resources—as well as to those working or living on the farm or in neighboring areas. The concept of sustainable agriculture extends intergenerationally, passing on a conserved or improved natural resource, biotic, and economic base rather than one which has been depleted or polluted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Networld-Project |url=http://www.green-networld.com/facts/glossary.htm |title=Environmental Glossary |publisher=Green-networld.com |date=1998-02-09 |accessdate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elements of sustainable agriculture include [[permaculture]], [[agroforestry]], [[mixed farming]], [[multiple cropping]], and [[crop rotation]].&lt;ref&gt;Ben Falk, ''The resilient farm and homestead: An innovative permaculture and whole systems design approach''. Chelsea Green, 2013. pp. 61-78.&lt;/ref&gt; It involves agricultural methods that do not undermine the environment, smart farming technologies that enhance a quality environment for humans to thrive and reclaiming and transforming deserts into farmlands(Herman Daly, 2017). {{Citation needed|reason=reclaiming and transforming deserts is sustainable|date=December 2017}}

According to ecological economist [[:de:Malte Michael Faber|Malte Faber]], ecological economics is defined by its focus on nature, justice, and time. Issues of [[intergenerational equity]], [[irreversibility]] of environmental change, [[uncertainty]] of long-term outcomes, and sustainable development guide ecological economic analysis and valuation.&lt;ref name=Faber2008&gt;Malte Faber.

As early as the 1970s, the concept of sustainability was used to describe an [[economy]] "in equilibrium with basic ecological support systems".&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert L. Stivers|Stivers, R.]] 1976. The Sustainable Society: Ethics and Economic Growth.

In 1987 the economist Edward Barbier published the study ''The Concept of Sustainable Economic Development'', where he recognised that goals of environmental conservation and economic development are not conflicting and can be reinforcing each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Barbier |first=E. |year=1987 |title=The Concept of Sustainable Economic Development |journal=Environmental Conservation |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=101–110 |doi=10.1017/S0376892900011449 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[World Bank]] study from 1999 concluded that based on the theory of genuine savings, policymakers have many possible interventions to increase sustainability, in [[macroeconomics]] or purely environmental.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hamilton |first=K. |first2=M. |last2=Clemens |year=1999 |title=Genuine savings rates in developing countries |journal=World Bank Economy Review |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=333–356 |doi=10.1093/wber/13.2.333 | url=http://wber.oxfordjournals.org/content/13/2/333.abstract }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies have noted that efficient policies for renewable energy and pollution are compatible with increasing human welfare, eventually reaching a golden-rule steady state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=2001 |first=A.

The study, ''Interpreting Sustainability in Economic Terms'', found three pillars of sustainable development, interlinkage, [[intergenerational equity]], and [[dynamic efficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stavins |first=R. |first2=A. |last2=Wagner |first3=G. |last3=Wagner |title=Interpreting Sustainability in Economic Terms: Dynamic Efficiency Plus Intergenerational Equity |journal=[[Economic Letters]] |volume=79 |issue=3 |pages=339–343 |doi=10.1016/S0165-1765(03)00036-3 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But [[Gilbert Rist]] points out that the World Bank has twisted the notion of sustainable development to prove that economic development need not be deterred in the interest of preserving the ecosystem. He writes: "From this angle, 'sustainable development' looks like a cover-up operation. ... The thing that is meant to be sustained is really 'development', not the tolerance capacity of the ecosystem or of human societies."&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Development'', 3rd Ed. (New York: Zed, 2008) 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Bank, a leading producer of environmental knowledge, continues to advocate the win-win prospects for economic growth and ecological stability even as its economists express their doubts.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel P. Castillo, "Integral Ecology as a Liberationist Concept" in ''Theological Studies'', Vol 77, 2, June 2016, 374.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herman Daly]], an economist for the Bank from 1988 to 1994, writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;When authors of ''WDR'' '92 [the highly influential 1992 ''World Development Report'' that featured the environment] were drafting the report, they called me asking for examples of "win-win" strategies in my work. What could I say? None exists in that pure form; there are trade-offs, not "win-wins." But they want to see a world of "win-wins" based on articles of faith, not fact. I wanted to contribute because ''WDR''s are important in the Bank, [because] task managers read [them] to find philosophical justification for their latest round of projects. But they did not want to hear about how things really are, or what I find in my work..."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Goldman, ''Imperial Nature: the World Bank and the Struggle for Justice in the Age of Globalization.'' (New Haven: Yale University, 2005), 128, quoted in ''[[Theological Studies (journal)|Theological Studies]]'', supra.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Environmental economics ====
{{main|Environmental economics}}
The total environment includes not just the biosphere of earth, air, and water, but also human interactions with these things, with nature, and what humans have created as their surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Economics, 3rd Edition. J.J. Seneca/M.K. Taussig. 1984. Page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

As countries around the world continue to advance economically, they put a strain on the ability of the natural environment to absorb the high level of pollutants that are created as a part of this economic growth. Therefore, solutions need to be found so that the economies of the world can continue to grow, but not at the expense of the public good.  In the world of economics the amount of environmental quality must be considered as limited in supply and therefore is treated as a scarce resource. This is a resource to be protected. One common way to analyze possible outcomes of policy decisions on the scarce resource is to do a cost-benefit analysis. This type of analysis contrasts different options of resource allocation and, based on an evaluation of the expected courses of action and the consequences of these actions, the optimal way to do so in the light of different policy goals can be elicited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barbier|first1=E.B.|last2=Markandya|first2=A.|last3=Pearce|first3=D.W.|title=Environmental sustainability and cost-benefit analysis|journal=Environment and Planning A|date=1990|volume=22|doi=10.1068/a221259|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.335.1749&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|accessdate=11 November 2016|pages=1259–1266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benefit-cost analysis basically can look at several ways of solving a problem and then assigning the best route for a solution, based on the set of consequences that would result from the further development of the individual courses of action, and then choosing the course of action that results in the least amount of damage to the expected outcome for the environmental quality that remains after that development or process takes place. Further complicating this analysis are the interrelationships of the various parts of the environment that might be impacted by the chosen course of action.  Sometimes it is almost impossible to predict the various outcomes of a course of action, due to the unexpected consequences and the amount of unknowns that are not accounted for in the benefit-cost analysis.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

====Energy====
{{Main|Smart grid|Sustainable energy}}
Sustainable energy is clean and can be used over a long period of time. Unlike fossil fuels and biofuels that provide the bulk of the worlds energy, [[renewable energy]] sources like hydroelectric, solar and wind energy produce far less pollution.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-biofuels-idUSBRE90601A20130107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fainstein, Susan S. 2000. "New Directions in Planning Theory," ''Urban Affairs Review'' 35:4 (March)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Solar energy]] is commonly used on public parking meters, street lights and the roof of buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bedsworf | first1 = Louise W. | last2 = Hanak | first2 = Ellen | year = 2010 | title = Adaptation to Climate Change | url = | journal = Journal of the American Planning Association | volume = 76 | issue = | page = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wind power]] has expanded quickly, its share of worldwide electricity usage at the end of 2014 was 3.1%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/REN12-GSR2015_Onlinebook_low1.pdf pg31&lt;/ref&gt; Most of California's fossil fuel infrastructures are sited in or near low-income communities, and have traditionally suffered the most from California's fossil fuel energy system.  These communities are historically left out during the decision-making process, and often end up with dirty power plants and other dirty energy projects that poison the air and harm the area. These toxicants are major contributors to health problems in the communities. As renewable energy becomes more common, fossil fuel infrastructures are replaced by renewables, providing better social equity to these communities.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Scott. 1996. "Green Cities, Growing Cities, Just Cities?: Urban planning and the Contradictions of Sustainable Development," Journal of the American Planning Association&lt;/ref&gt;
Overall, and in the long run, sustainable development in the field of energy is also deemed to contribute to economic sustainability and national security of communities, thus being increasingly encouraged through investment policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farah|first1=Paolo Davide|title=Sustainable Energy Investments and National Security: Arbitration and Negotiation Issues|journal=JOURNAL OF WORLD ENERGY LAW AND BUSINESS|date=2015|volume=8|issue=6|ssrn=2695579}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Technology====
{{See also|Appropriate technology|Environmental engineering|Environmental technology}}
One of the core concepts in sustainable development is that technology can be used to assist people meet their developmental needs. Technology to meet these sustainable development needs is often referred to as [[appropriate technology]], which is an ideological movement (and its manifestations) originally articulated as [[intermediate technology]] by the economist [[E. F. Schumacher]] in his influential work, ''[[Small is Beautiful]].'' and now covers a wide range of technologies.&lt;ref name=BrownU&gt;{{cite book|title=Appropriate Technology: Tools, Choices, and Implications|year=1999|publisher=Academic Press|location=New York|isbn=0-12-335190-1|pages=3, 270|author=Hazeltine, B.|author2=Bull, C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Schumacher and many modern-day proponents of appropriate technology also emphasise the technology as people-centered.&lt;ref name=Akubue&gt;{{cite journal|last=Akubue|first=Anthony|title=Appropriate Technology for Socioeconomic Development in Third World Countries|journal=The Journal of Technology Studies|date=Winter–Spring 2000|volume=26|issue=1|pages=33–43.Retrieved March 2011|url=http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/JOTS/Winter-Spring-2000/akabue.html|doi=10.21061/jots.v26i1.a.6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today appropriate technology is often developed using [[Open-source model|open source]] principles, which have led to [[open-source appropriate technology]] (OSAT) and thus many of the plans of the technology can be freely found on the [[Internet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pearce | first1 = Joshua M. | year = 2012 | title = The Case for Open Source Appropriate Technology | url =https://www.academia.edu/1517361/The_Case_for_Open_Source_Appropriate_Technology | journal = Environment, Development and Sustainability | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 425–431 | doi = 10.1007/s10668-012-9337-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; OSAT has been proposed as a new model of enabling [[innovation]] for sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce J., Albritton S., Grant G., Steed G., &amp; Zelenika I. 2012.

====Transport====
{{See also|Sustainable transport}}
Transportation is a large contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. It is said that one-third of all gasses produced are due to transportation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sustainable Transport in Freiburg: Lessons from Germany's Environmental Capital|last = Buehler|first = Ralph|date = 2011|journal = International Journal of Sustainable Transportation&lt;!-- 23:04:16--&gt;|doi = 10.1080/15568311003650531|pmid = |last2 = Pucher|first2 = John|volume=5|pages=43–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motorized transport also releases exhaust fumes that contain particulate matter which is hazardous to human health and a contributor to climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-breathe-clean/?loclang=en_gb|title=LEDS in Practice: Breathe clean|work=The Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sustainable transport has many social and economic benefits that can accelerate local sustainable development. According to a series of reports by the [[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]], sustainable transport can help create jobs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-create-jobs/?loclang=en_gb|title=LEDS in Practice: Create jobs|work=The Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt; improve commuter safety through investment in bicycle lanes and pedestrian pathways,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-make-roads-safe/?loclang=en_gb|title=LEDS in Practice: Make roads safe|work=The Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt; make access to employment and social opportunities more affordable and efficient. It also offers a practical opportunity to save people's time and household income as well as government budgets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-save-time-money/?loclang=en_gb|title=LEDS in Practice: Save money and time|work=The Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt; making investment in sustainable transport a 'win-win' opportunity.

Some Western countries are making transportation more sustainable in both long-term and short-term implementations.&lt;ref&gt;Barbour, Elissa and Elizabeth A. Deakin. 2012. "Smart Growth Planning for Climate Protection"&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the modification in available transportation in [[Freiburg im Breisgau|Freiburg, Germany]]. The city has implemented extensive methods of public transportation, cycling, and walking, along with large areas where cars are not allowed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Since many Western countries are highly automobile-oriented, the main transit that people use is personal vehicles. About 80% of their travel involves cars.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Therefore, California, is one of the highest [[greenhouse gases]] emitters in the United States. The federal government has to come up with some plans to reduce the total number of vehicle trips in order to lower greenhouse gases emission. Such as:

* Improve public transit through the provision of larger coverage area in order to provide more mobility and accessibility, new technology to provide a more reliable and responsive public transportation network.&lt;ref&gt;Murthy, A.S. Narasimha Mohle, Henry. [http://site.ebrary.com/lib/alltitles/docDetail.action?docID=10447877&amp;p00=transportation%20improvement Transportation Engineering Basics (2nd Edition)]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. (American Society of Civil Engineers 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Encourage walking and biking through the provision of wider pedestrian pathway, bike share stations in downtowns, locate parking lots far from the shopping center, limit on street parking, slower traffic lane in downtown area.
* Increase the cost of car ownership and gas taxes through increased parking fees and tolls, encouraging people to drive more fuel efficient vehicles. This can produce a social equity problem, since lower income people usually drive older vehicles with lower fuel efficiency. Government can use the extra revenue collected from taxes and tolls to improve public transportation and benefit poor communities.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Jonathan. 2013. "Urban Transportation and Social Equity: Transportation Planning Paradigms that Impede Policy Reform," in Naomi Carmon and Susan S. Fainstein, eds. Policy, Planning and people: promoting Justice in Urban Development (Penn)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other states and nations have built efforts to [[knowledge translation|translate knowledge]] in [[behavioral economics]] into [[evidence-based]] [[sustainable transportation]] policies.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

====Business====

{{See also|Corporate sustainability}}
The most broadly accepted criterion for corporate sustainability constitutes a firm's efficient use of natural capital.  This [[eco-efficiency]] is usually calculated as the economic value added by a firm in relation to its aggregated ecological impact.&lt;ref&gt;Schaltegger, S. &amp; Sturm, A. 1998. Eco-Efficiency by Eco-Controlling. Zürich: vdf.&lt;/ref&gt;  This idea has been popularised by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development ([[WBCSD]]) under the following definition: "Eco-efficiency is achieved by the delivery of competitively priced goods and services that satisfy human needs and bring quality of life, while progressively reducing ecological impacts and [[resource intensity]] throughout the life-cycle to a level at least in line with the earth's carrying capacity" (DeSimone and Popoff, 1997: 47).&lt;ref&gt;DeSimone, L. &amp; Popoff, F. 1997. Eco-efficiency: The business link to sustainable development. Cambridge: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to the eco-efficiency concept but so far less explored is the second criterion for corporate sustainability. Socio-efficiency&lt;ref name="Dyllick, T. 2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dyllick | first1 = T. | last2 = Hockerts | first2 = K. | year = 2002 | title = Beyond the business case for corporate sustainability | url = | journal = Business Strategy and the Environment | volume = 11 | issue = 2| pages = 130–141 | doi=10.1002/bse.323}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes the relation between a firm's value added and its social impact. Whereas, it can be assumed that most corporate impacts on the environment are negative (apart from rare exceptions such as the planting of trees) this is not true for social impacts. These can be either positive (e.g. corporate giving, creation of employment) or negative (e.g. work accidents, mobbing of employees, human rights abuses). Depending on the type of impact socio-efficiency thus either tries to minimise negative social impacts (i.e. accidents per value added) or maximise positive social impacts (i.e. donations per value added) in relation to the value added.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Both eco-efficiency and socio-efficiency are concerned primarily with increasing economic sustainability. In this process they instrumentalise both natural and social capital aiming to benefit from win-win situations. However, as Dyllick and Hockerts&lt;ref name="Dyllick, T. 2002"/&gt; point out the business case alone will not be sufficient to realise sustainable development. They point towards eco-effectiveness, socio-effectiveness, sufficiency, and eco-equity as four criteria that need to be met if sustainable development is to be reached.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

CASI Global, New York "CSR &amp; Sustainability together lead to sustainable development. CSR as in corporate social responsibility is not what you do with your profits, but is the way you make profits. This means CSR is a part of every department of the company value chain and not a part of HR / independent department. Sustainability as in effects towards Human resources, Environment and Ecology has to be measured within each department of the company." http://casiglobal.us/

====Income====

At the present time, sustainable development can reduce [[poverty]]. Sustainable development reduces [[poverty]] through financial (among other things, a balanced budget), environmental (living conditions), and social (including equality of income) means.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wydawnictwoumk.pl/czasopisma/index.php/CJFA/article/view/CJFA.2014.001/3213 S. Adamiak, D. Walczak, Sustainable development and social solidarism in the context of social security, Copernican Journal of Finance &amp; Accounting, Vol 3, No 1, p. 12,17.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Architecture====

{{See also|Sustainable architecture}}
In sustainable architecture the recent movements of [[New Urbanism]] and [[New Classical architecture]] promote a sustainable approach towards construction, that appreciates and develops [[smart growth]], [[Vernacular architecture|architectural tradition]] and [[Classical architecture|classical design]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnu.org/charter Charter of the New Urbanism]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beauty, Humanism, Continuity between Past and Future|url=http://www.traditionalarchitecture.co.uk/aims.html|publisher=Traditional Architecture Group|accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This in contrast to [[Modern architecture|modernist]] and [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]] architecture, as well as opposing to solitary [[housing estate]]s and [[Urban sprawl|suburban sprawl]], with long commuting distances and large ecological footprints.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aia.org/SiteObjects/files/smartgrowth05.pdf Issue Brief: Smart-Growth: Building Livable Communities]. American Institute of Architects. Retrieved on 2014-03-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Both trends started in the 1980s. (It should be noted that sustainable architecture is predominantly relevant to the economics domain while architectural landscaping pertains more to the ecological domain.){{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Politics===
{{See also|Environmental politics|Environmental governance|Sustainability metrics and indices}}
A study concluded that social indicators and, therefore, sustainable development indicators, are scientific constructs whose principal objective is to inform public policy-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul-Marie Boulanger |url=http://sapiens.revues.org/index166.html |title=Sustainable development indicators: a scientific challenge, a democratic issue. '&amp;#39;S.A.P.I.EN.S.'&amp;#39; '&amp;#39;'1'&amp;#39;' (1) |publisher=Sapiens.revues.org |year=2008 |accessdate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Institute for Sustainable Development]] has similarly developed a political policy framework, linked to a sustainability index for establishing measurable entities and metrics. The framework consists of six core areas, international trade and investment, economic policy, climate change and energy, measurement and assessment, natural resource management, and the role of communication technologies in sustainable development.

The [[United Nations Global Compact]] Cities Programme has defined sustainable political development in a way that broadens the usual definition beyond states and governance. The political is defined as the domain of practices and meanings associated with basic issues of social power as they pertain to the organisation, authorisation, legitimation and regulation of a social life held in common. This definition is in accord with the view that political change is important for responding to economic, ecological and cultural challenges. It also means that the politics of economic change can be addressed. They have listed seven subdomains of the domain of politics:&lt;ref name="citiesprogramme.com"/&gt;

#Organization and governance
#Law and justice
#Communication and critique
#Representation and negotiation
#Security and accord
#Dialogue and reconciliation
#Ethics and accountability

This accords with the Brundtland Commission emphasis on development that is guided by human rights principles (see above).

===Culture===

[[File:Circles of Sustainability image (assessment - Melbourne 2011).jpg|250px|thumb|Framing of sustainable development progress according to the [[Circles of Sustainability]], used by the [[United Nations Global Compact|United Nations]].]]
Working with a different emphasis, some researchers and institutions have pointed out that a fourth dimension should be added to the dimensions of sustainable development, since the triple-bottom-line dimensions of economic, environmental and social do not seem to be enough to reflect the complexity of contemporary society. In this context, the [[Agenda 21 for culture]] and the [[United Cities and Local Governments]] (UCLG)  Executive Bureau lead the preparation of the policy statement "Culture: Fourth Pillar of Sustainable Development", passed on 17 November 2010, in the framework of the World Summit of Local and Regional Leaders&amp;nbsp;– 3rd World Congress of UCLG, held in Mexico City. This document inaugurates a new perspective and points to the relation between culture and sustainable development through a dual approach: developing a solid [[cultural policy]] and advocating a cultural dimension in all public policies. The [[Circles of Sustainability]] approach distinguishes the four domains of economic, ecological, political and cultural sustainability.&lt;ref name="agenda21culture.net"&gt;United Cities and Local Governments, [http://agenda21culture.net/index.php/16-official-documentation-all/agenda-21-culture-all/437-cultural-policies-and-sustainable-development "Culture: Fourth Pillar of Sustainable Development"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uclg.org/en/node/21824&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/15885475/Assessing_Cultural_Sustainability_Agenda_21_for_Culture&lt;/ref&gt;

Other organizations have also supported the idea of a fourth domain of sustainable development. The Network of Excellence "Sustainable Development in a Diverse World",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.susdiv.org/ |title=Sus.Div |publisher=Sus.Div |accessdate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; sponsored by the [[European Union]], integrates multidisciplinary capacities and interprets [[cultural diversity]] as a key element of a new strategy for sustainable development. The Fourth Pillar of Sustainable Development Theory has been referenced by executive director of IMI Institute at [[UNESCO]] Vito Di Bari&lt;ref&gt;"Agreement between UNESCO and the City of Milan concerning the International Multimedia Institute (IMI) - Appointment of Executive Director&amp;nbsp;— UNESCO Archives ICA AtoM catalogue". Atom.archives.unesco.org. 1999-10-08. Retrieved 2014-01-17.&lt;/ref&gt; in his manifesto of art and architectural movement [[Neo-Futurism]], whose name was inspired by the 1987 [[United Nations]]’ report [[Our Common Future]]. The [[Circles of Sustainability]] approach used by Metropolis defines the (fourth) cultural domain as practices, discourses, and material expressions, which, over time, express continuities and discontinuities of social meaning.&lt;ref name="citiesprogramme.com"&gt;http://citiesprogramme.com/archives/resource/circles-of-sustainability-urban-profile-process {{Cite journal

{{See also|Sustainable development goals}}
The [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development]] (UNCSD; also known as Rio 2012) was the third international conference on sustainable development,  which aimed at reconciling the economic and environmental goals of the global community. An outcome of this conference was the development of the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] that aim to promote sustainable progress and eliminate inequalities around the world. However, few nations met the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]]'s definition of sustainable development criteria established in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Living Planet Report 2006 |url= http://assets.panda.org/downloads/living_planet_report.pdf |publisher= [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], [[Zoological Society of London]], [[Global Footprint Network]] |date= 24 October 2006 |page= 19 |accessdate= 18 August 2012 }}; [http://www.science.org.au/nova/newscientist/107ns_004.htm World failing on sustainable development] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209164418/http://www.science.org.au/nova/newscientist/107ns_004.htm |date=9 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some nations are more developed than others, all nations are constantly developing because each nation struggles with perpetuating disparities, inequalities and unequal access to fundamental rights and freedoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Creating Capabilities: The Human Development Approach|last = Nussbaum|first = Martha|publisher = The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-674-05054-9|location = Cambridge, Massachusetts and London, England|pages = 16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 a report for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency stated: "While much discussion and effort has gone into sustainability indicators, none of the resulting systems clearly tells us whether our society is sustainable. At best, they can tell us that we are heading in the wrong direction, or that our current activities are not sustainable. More often, they simply draw our attention to the existence of problems, doing little to tell us the origin of those problems and nothing to tell us how to solve them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/1841126/Environmental-Protection-Agency-hechtepaordpaper |title=Joy E.

Those indicators are expected to be identified and adjusted through empirical observations (trial and error).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2006 | title = An adaptive learning process for developing and applying sustainability indicators with local communities | url = http://km.fao.org/uploads/media/An%20adaptative%20learning%20process%20for%20developing%20and%20applying%20sustainability%20indicators%20with%20local%20communities.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Ecological economics | volume = 59 | issue =  | pages = 406–418 | doi = 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2005.11.008 | last1 = Reed | first1 = Mark S. | access-date = 18 February 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110726045818/http://km.fao.org/uploads/media/An%20adaptative%20learning%20process%20for%20developing%20and%20applying%20sustainability%20indicators%20with%20local%20communities.pdf | archive-date = 26 July 2011 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common critiques are related to issues like data quality, comparability, objective function and the necessary resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nse-netz.de/downloads/nachh.pdf |title=Annette Lang, Ist Nachhaltigkeit messbar?, Uni Hannover, 2003 |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-09-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110802135133/http://www.nse-netz.de/downloads/nachh.pdf |archive-date=2 August 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However a more general criticism is coming from the project management community: How can a sustainable development be achieved at global level if we cannot monitor it in any single project?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://youth-partnership-eu.coe.int/youth-partnership/documents/Publications/T_kits/3/tkit3.pdf |title=Project Management T-kit, Council of Europe and European Commission, Strasbourg, 2000 |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grida.no/publications/et/ep4/page/2653.aspx |title=Do global targets matter?, The Environment Times, Poverty Times #4, UNEP/GRID-Arendal, 2010 |publisher=Grida.no |accessdate=2011-09-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629043039/http://www.grida.no/publications/et/ep4/page/2653.aspx |archive-date=29 June 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cuban-born researcher and entrepreneur Sonia Bueno suggests an alternative approach that is based upon the integral, long-term cost-benefit relationship as a measure and monitoring tool for the sustainability of every project, activity or enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.empai-matanzas.co.cu/revista/REVISTA_archivos/Page969.htm |title=Sostenibilidad en la construcción.

Reasonable qualifications of sustainability are seen U.S. Green Building Council's (USGBC) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). This design incorporates some ecological, economic, and social elements. The goals presented by LEED design goals are sustainable sites, water efficiency, energy and atmospheric emission reduction, material and resources efficiency, and indoor environmental quality. Although amount of structures for sustainability development is many, these qualification has become a standard for sustainable building.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Recent research efforts created also the [[SDEWES Centre#SDEWES Index|SDEWES Index]] to benchmark the performance of cities across aspects that are related to energy, water and environment systems. The [[SDEWES Centre|SDEWES]] Index consists of 7 dimensions, 35 indicators, and close to 20 sub-indicators. It is currently applied to 58 cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SDEWES Centre - SDEWES Index|url = http://www.sdewes.org/sdewes_index.php|website = www.sdewes.org|accessdate = 2015-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural capital===
[[File:Hillside deforestation in Rio de Janeiro.jpg|300px|thumb|alt=Deforastation of native rain forest in Rio de Janeiro City for extraction of clay for civil construction|[[Deforestation]] of native [[rain forest]] in Rio de Janeiro City for extraction of [[clay]] for [[civil engineering]] (2009 picture).]]
The sustainable development debate is based on the assumption that societies need to manage three types of capital (economic, social, and natural), which may be non-substitutable and whose consumption might be irreversible.&lt;ref name="Dyllick, T. 2002"/&gt; Leading [[Ecological economics|ecological economist]] and [[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state theorist]] [[Herman Daly]],&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt; for example, points to the fact that [[natural capital]] can not necessarily be substituted by economic capital. While it is possible that we can find ways to replace some natural resources, it is much more unlikely that they will ever be able to replace eco-system services, such as the protection provided by the ozone layer, or the climate stabilizing function of the Amazonian forest. In fact natural capital, social capital and economic capital are often complementarities. A further obstacle to substitutability lies also in the multi-functionality of many natural resources. Forests, for example, not only provide the raw material for paper (which can be substituted quite easily), but they also maintain biodiversity, regulate water flow, and absorb CO2.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Another problem of natural and social capital deterioration lies in their partial irreversibility. The [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]], for example, is often definitive. The same can be true for cultural diversity. For example, with globalisation advancing quickly the number of indigenous languages is dropping at alarming rates.  Moreover, the depletion of natural and social capital may have non-linear consequences. Consumption of natural and social capital may have no observable impact until a certain threshold is reached. A lake can, for example, absorb nutrients for a long time while actually increasing its productivity. However, once a certain level of algae is reached lack of oxygen causes the lake's ecosystem to break down suddenly.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Business-as-usual===
[[File:Air pollution by industrial chimneys.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Before [[flue-gas desulfurization]] was installed, the [[air pollution|air-polluting]] emissions from this power plant in [[New Mexico]] contained excessive amounts of [[sulfur dioxide]].]]
If the degradation of natural and social capital has such important consequence the question arises why action is not taken more systematically to alleviate it. Cohen and Winn&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cohen | first1 = B. | last2 = Winn | first2 = M. I. | year = 2007 | title = Market imperfections, opportunity and sustainable entrepreneurship | url = | journal = Journal of Business Venturing | volume = 22 | issue = 1| pages = 29–49 | doi=10.1016/j.jbusvent.2004.12.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; point to four types of market failure as possible explanations: First, while the benefits of natural or social capital depletion can usually be privatised, the costs are often externalised (i.e. they are borne not by the party responsible but by society in general). Second, natural capital is often undervalued by society since we are not fully aware of the real cost of the depletion of natural capital. Information asymmetry is a third reason—often the link between cause and effect is obscured, making it difficult for actors to make informed choices. Cohen and Winn close with the realization that contrary to economic theory many firms are not perfect optimisers. They postulate that firms often do not optimise resource allocation because they are caught in a "business as usual" mentality.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Education===
''Main page: [[Education for sustainable development]]''

Education must be revisited in light of a renewed vision of sustainable human and social development that is both equitable and viable. This vision of sustainability must take into consideration the social, environmental and economic dimensions of human development and the various ways in which these relate to education: ‘An empowering education is one that builds the human resources we need to be productive, to continue to learn, to solve problems, to be creative, and to live together and with nature in peace and harmony. When nations ensure that such an education is accessible to all throughout their lives, a quiet revolution is set in motion: education becomes the engine of sustainable development and the key to a better world.’&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Power of Education: Education for All, Development, Globalisation and UNESCO|last=Power|first=C|publisher=London, Springer|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002325/232555e.pdf|title=Rethinking Education: Towards a global common good?|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100088-1|location=|pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Higher education in sustainability across education streams including engineering, finance, supply chain and operations is gaining weight-age. Multiple institutes including Wharton, Columbia, CASI Global New York offer certifications in Sustainability.
Corporate's prefer employees certified in sustainability.

== Insubstantial stretching of the term ==
It has been argued that since the 1960s, the concept of sustainable development has changed from "conservation management" to "economic development", whereby the original meaning of the concept has been stretched somewhat.&lt;ref name=to01&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Riordan |first=Timothy |date=1993 |chapter=The Politics of Sustainability |editor-last=Turner |editor-first=R. Kerry |title=Sustainable Environmental Economics and Management: Principles and Practice. |location=London |publisher=Belhaven Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|48–54}}

In the 1960s, the international community realised that many African countries needed national plans to safeguard wildlife habitats, and that rural areas had to confront the limits imposed by soil, climate and water availability. This was a strategy of conservation management. In the 1970s, however, the focus shifted to the broader issues of the provisioning of basic human needs, community participation as well as appropriate technology use throughout the developing countries (and not just in Africa). This was a strategy of economic development, and the strategy was carried even further by the [[Brundtland Commission]]'s report on ''[[Our Common Future]]'' when the issues went from regional to international in scope and application.&lt;ref name=to01/&gt;{{rp|48–54}} In effect, the conservationists were crowded out and superseded by the developers.

But shifting the focus of sustainable development from conservation to development has had the imperceptible effect of stretching the original forest management term of [[sustainable yield]] from the use of renewable resources only (like forestry), to now also accounting for the use of non-renewable resources (like [[Natural resource#Classification|minerals]]).&lt;ref name=kt01&gt;{{cite book |last=Turner |first=R. Kerry |date=1988 |chapter=Sustainability, Resource Conservation and Pollution Control: An Overview |editor-last=Turner |editor-first=R. Kerry |title=Sustainable Environmental Management. |location=London |publisher=Belhaven Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13}} This stretching of the term has been questioned. Thus, environmental economist Kerry Turner has argued that literally, there can be no such thing as overall "sustainable development" in an industrialised [[world economy]] that remains heavily dependent on the extraction of earth's finite stock of exhaustible mineral resources: "It makes no sense to talk about the sustainable use of a non-renewable resource (even with substantial [[recycling]] effort and use rates). Any positive rate of exploitation will eventually lead to exhaustion of the finite stock."&lt;ref name=kt01/&gt;{{rp|13}}

In effect, it has been argued that the industrial revolution as a whole is unsustainable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Georgescu-Roegen |first=Nicholas |authorlink=Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen |date=1971 |title=The Entropy Law and the Economic Process |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/267519123/The-Entropy-Law-and-the-Economic-Process-by-Nicholas-Georgescu-Roegen-pdf |format=Full book accessible at Scribd |location=Cambridge |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0674257804 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|20f}}&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|22f}}&lt;ref name=jr01&gt;{{cite book |last=Rifkin |first=Jeremy |authorlink=Jeremy Rifkin |date=1980 |title=Entropy: A New World View. |url=http://www.foet.org/FOET-data/uploads/2017/03/Jeremy-Rifkin-Entropy-table-of-contents.pdf |format=PDF contains only the title and contents pages of the book |location=New York |publisher=The Viking Press |isbn=0670297178 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|61–67}}&lt;ref name="Monbiot-20171124"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Monbiot|first1=George|title=Everything Must Go|url=http://www.monbiot.com/2017/11/24/everything-must-go/|website=George Monbiot|accessdate=26 November 2017|date=2017-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One critic has argued that the [[Brundtland Commission]] promoted nothing but a business as usual strategy for world development, with the ambiguous and insubstantial concept of "sustainable development" attached as a public relations slogan:&lt;ref name=ap01&gt;{{cite book |last=Perez-Carmona |first=Alexander |date=2013 |chapter=Growth: A Discussion of the Margins of Economic and Ecological Thought |chapter-url=http://www.slideshare.net/lucieevers1/growth-in-margin-of-ecological-thought-by-perez |editor-last=Meuleman |editor-first=Louis |title=Transgovernance. Advancing Sustainability Governance. |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-28009-2_3 |chapter-format=Article accessible at SlideShare |location=Heidelberg |publisher=Springer |isbn=9783642280085 |pages=83–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|94–99}} The report on ''[[Our Common Future]]'' was largely the result of a political bargaining process involving many special interest groups, all put together to create a common appeal of political acceptability across borders. After World War II, the notion of "development" had been established in the West to imply the projection of the American model of society onto the rest of the world. In the 1970s and 1980s, this notion was broadened somewhat to also imply human rights, basic human needs and finally, ecological issues. The emphasis of the report was on helping poor nations out of poverty and meeting the basic needs of their growing populations—as usual. This issue demanded more economic growth, also in the rich countries, who would then import more goods from the poor countries to help them out—as usual. When the discussion switched to [[Steady-state economy#Present background: Exceeding global limits to growth|global ecological limits to growth]], the obvious dilemma was left aside by calling for economic growth with improved resource efficiency, or what was termed "a change in the ''quality'' of growth". However, most countries in the West had experienced such improved resource efficiency since the early-20th century already and as usual; only, this improvement had been more than offset by continuing industrial expansion, to the effect that world resource consumption was now higher than ever before—and these two historical trends were completely ignored in the report. Taken together, the policy of perpetual economic growth for the entire planet remained virtually intact. Since the publication of the report, the ambiguous and insubstantial slogan of "sustainable development" has marched on worldwide.&lt;ref name=ap01/&gt;{{rp|94–99}}

'''''The Epistle to the Romans''''' ({{lang-de|Der Römerbrief}}) is a commentary by Swiss theologian [[Karl Barth]] on the [[New Testament]] [[Epistle to the Romans]].  

Disillusioned with both German Protestant Liberalism and Religious Socialism after the outbreak of the [[World War I]] in 1914, Barth decided in the summer of 1916 to write a commentary on Paul's [[Epistle to the Romans]] as a way of rethinking his theological inheritance. Barth was a pastor in [[Safenwil]] at the time. Protestant Liberal theology had played a significant role in the rise of German nationalism prior to World War I, leading to Barth's disillusionment and attempts to restructure Protestant theology. The first edition of the commentary was published in December 1918 (but with a publication date of 1919). It was the first edition of the work, which has not been translated into English, which earned Barth his invitation to teach at the [[University of Göttingen]] and which [[Karl Adam (theologian)|Karl Adam]] said fell "like a bombshell on the theologians' playground."&lt;ref&gt;Karl Adam, ''Das Hochland'', June 1926, as referenced in J. McConnachie, "The Teaching of Karl Barth," ''Hibbert Journal'' 25 (1926–1927), p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1920 Barth decided that he needed to revise the first edition and worked for the next eleven months on rewriting the commentary, finishing around September 1921.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Oakes, ''Reading Karl Barth: A Companion to the Epistle to the Romans'', Eugene: Cascade, 2011, pp. 27–29.&lt;/ref&gt; The second edition was published in 1922 and translated into English in 1933. 

This work, like many of his others, emphasizes the saving grace of God and humanity's inability to know God outside of God's revelation in Christ. Specifically, the God who is revealed in the cross of Jesus challenges and overthrows any attempt to ally God with human cultures, achievements, or possessions. While famous for its use of [[dialectic]],&lt;ref&gt;Michael Beintker, ''Die Dialektik in der »dialektischen Theologie« Karl Barths: Studien zur Entwicklung der Barthschen Theologie und zur Vorgeschichte der »Kirchlichen Dogmatik «'', München: Kaiser, 1987, pp. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt; some scholars have argued that Barth makes extensive use of [[analogy]] in the work as well.&lt;ref&gt;Ingrid Spieckermann, ''Gotteserkenntnis: Ein Beitrag zur Grundfrage der neuen Theologie Karl Barths'', München: Kaiser, 1985. 129–31; Oakes, ''Reading Karl Barth'', pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Whole Lesbian Sex Book: A Passionate Guide for All of Us''''' is a 1999 book about [[lesbian sexual practices]] by sex educator [[Felice Newman]].

== Overview ==
First published in 1999 by Cleis Press, ''The Whole Lesbian Sex Book'' was written to "offer information and encouragement for all women who desire women."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-whole-lesbian-sex-book-felice-newman/1103671272|title=The Whole Lesbian Sex Book: A Passionate Guide for All of Us {{!}} Barnes and Noble|last=|first=|date=|work=Cleis Press|access-date=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intended audience includes lesbians, bisexuals, butch, femme, androgynous, and transgenders. The second edition was published October 5th, 2004 with an additional chapter, new research, an expanded resource guide, and extra illustrations.

== Topics ==
Topics include the importance of communication in any sexual relationship, how to communicate about lesbian sex, exploring personal desires and fantasies, how masturbation improves sex, how to achieve the preferred orgasm, where to find sex partners, expert advice on various lesbian sex techniques, and a guide to picking sex toys.

== Controversy ==
Two teenage brothers from [[Bentonville, Arkansas]], found the book in a [[public library]] and told their father, Earl Adams. The father complained to the library's director, Bentonville's [[mayor]], and to a local [[newspaper]]. He threatened to sue the library if the book was not removed. The [[Fox News Channel]] picked up the story in April 2007, which gave it and the book national attention.&lt;ref name=Ficera&gt;{{cite news

The participating research groups are based mainly at [[Imperial College London]], [[King's College London]], [[Queen Mary University of London]] (QMUL) and [[University College London]] (UCL), but there are also members at the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]] in Teddington.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thomasyoungcentre.org/people/&lt;/ref&gt; The aims of the TYC are to foster collaboration between TSM research groups in London, to provide a world-class source of graduate education in the field, and to address problems of major importance to industry and society. The current (2009) membership of TYC numbers about 80 research groups, of which six are led by Fellows of the [[Royal Society]].

== Participating academic departments ==

The breadth of scientific expertise offered by TYC can be inferred from the range of home academic departments of TYC research groups at the three main London Colleges:
* Imperial College:
** Aeronautical Engineering
** Chemical Engineering
** Chemistry
** Materials
** Mechanical Engineering
** Physics
* [[King's College London]]:
** Biomedical and Health Sciences
** Physics 
* University College London:
** Chemistry
** Civil, Geomatic and Environmental Engineering
** Earth Sciences
** Electronic and Electrical Engineering
** Physics and Astronomy
** Surgical and Interventional Science
Several TYC groups also belong to the [[London Centre for Nanotechnology]], a joint enterprise between Imperial College and UCL. The range of research work done by TYC groups is correspondingly broad, and includes topics such as the interaction of water with minerals, materials for the nuclear industry, the design of semiconductor materials for device applications, biomaterials, and many others.

{{Other uses|TDS (disambiguation){{!}}TDS}}
'''Total dissolved solids (TDS)''' is a measure of the dissolved combined content of all [[Inorganic compound|inorganic]] and [[organic compound|organic]] substances present in a liquid in molecular, ionized or micro-granular ([[sol (colloid)|colloidal sol]]) suspended form. Generally the operational definition is that the solids must be small enough to survive filtration through a filter with two-micrometer (nominal size, or smaller) pores. Total dissolved solids are normally discussed only for freshwater systems, as [[salinity]] includes some of the ions constituting the definition of TDS. The principal application of TDS is in the study of [[water quality]] for [[stream]]s, [[river]]s and [[lake]]s, although TDS is not generally considered a primary pollutant (e.g. it is not deemed to be associated with health effects) it is used as an indication of aesthetic characteristics of [[drinking water]] and as an aggregate indicator of the presence of a broad array of chemical contaminants.

Primary sources for TDS in receiving waters are [[agriculture|agricultural]] and residential runoff, clay rich mountain waters, leaching of [[soil contamination]] and [[Point source (pollution)|point source]] [[water pollution]] discharge from industrial or [[sewage treatment]] plants. The most common chemical constituents are [[calcium]], [[phosphate]]s, [[nitrate]]s, [[sodium]], [[potassium]] and [[chloride]], which are found in [[nutrient]] runoff, general [[stormwater]] runoff and runoff from snowy climates where road [[de-icing]] salts are applied. The chemicals may be [[cation]]s, [[anion]]s, [[molecule]]s or agglomerations on the order of one thousand or fewer molecules, so long as a soluble micro-[[:wikt:granule|granule]] is formed. More exotic and harmful elements of TDS are [[pesticide]]s arising from [[surface runoff]]. Certain naturally occurring total dissolved solids arise from the weathering and dissolution of rocks and soils. The United States has established a secondary water quality standard of 500&amp;nbsp;mg/l to provide for palatability of drinking water.

Total dissolved solids are differentiated from [[total suspended solids]] ('''TSS'''), in that the latter cannot pass through a sieve of two micrometers and yet are indefinitely suspended in solution. The term "settleable solids" refers to material of any size that will not remain suspended or dissolved in a holding tank not subject to motion, and excludes both TDS and TSS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=John| last=DeZuane|title=Handbook of Drinking Water Quality|publisher=John Wiley and Sons| year=1997 |isbn=0-471-28789-X|edition= 2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Settleable solids may include larger particulate matter or insoluble molecules.

==Measurement==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2016}}
The two principal methods of measuring total dissolved solids are [[gravimetric analysis]] and [[Conductivity (electrolytic)|conductivity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160223132222/http://www.epa.gov/quality/total-dissolved-solids-tds-epa-method-1601-gravimetric-dried-180-degrees-c |title=Total Dissolved Solids (TDS): EPA Method 160.1 (Gravimetric, Dried at 180 deg. C) |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=1999-11-16 |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gravimetric methods are the most accurate and involve evaporating the liquid [[solvent]] and measuring the mass of residues left. This method is generally the best, although it is time-consuming. If inorganic salts comprise the great majority of TDS, gravimetric methods are appropriate.

Electrical conductivity of water is directly related to the concentration of dissolved ionized solids in the water. Ions from the dissolved solids in water create the ability for that water to conduct an [[electric current]], which can be measured using a conventional [[EC meter|conductivity meter]] or [[TDS meter]]. When correlated with laboratory TDS measurements, [[Conductivity (electrolytic)|conductivity]] provides an approximate value for the TDS [[concentration]], usually to within ten-percent accuracy.

The relationship of TDS and specific conductance of groundwater can be approximated by the following equation:

:''TDS = k&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;EC''

where TDS is expressed in mg/L and EC is the electrical conductivity in microsiemens per centimeter at 25&amp;nbsp;°C. The correlation factor ''k&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' varies between 0.55 and 0.8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Atekwanaa |first=Eliot A. |last2=Atekwanaa |first2=Estella A. |last3=Roweb |first3=Rebecca S. |last4=Werkema Jr. |first4=D. Dale |last5=Legalld |first5=Franklyn D. |date=2004 |title=The relationship of total dissolved solids measurements to bulk electrical conductivity in an aquifer contaminated with hydrocarbon |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140801000000*/http://www.epa.gov/esd/cmb/pdf/JAG-TDSpublished.pdf |journal=Journal of Applied Geophysics |publisher=Elsevier |volume=56 |issue=4 |pages=281–294 |doi=10.1016/j.jappgeo.2004.08.003 |access-date=15 February 2016|bibcode=2004JAG....56..281A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hydrological simulation==
{{see also|Hydrological transport model}}
[[File:Pyramid Lake sat.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pyramid Lake (Nevada)|Pyramid Lake, Nevada]] receives dissolved solids from the [[Truckee River]].]]

Hydrologic transport models are used to mathematically analyze movement of TDS within river systems. The most common models address surface runoff, allowing variation in [[land use]] type, [[topography]], [[soil]] type, [[vegetation|vegetative]] cover, [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], and land management practice (e.g. the application rate of a [[fertilizer]]). Runoff models have evolved to a good degree of accuracy and permit the evaluation of alternative land management practices upon impacts to stream water quality.

Basin models are used to more comprehensively evaluate total dissolved solids within a [[catchment basin]] and dynamically along various stream reaches. The [[DSSAM]] model was developed by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA).&lt;ref name="hogan-papineau"&gt;C.M. Hogan, Marc Papineau et al. ''Development of a dynamic water quality simulation model for the Truckee River'', Earth Metrics Inc., Environmental Protection Agency Technology Series, Washington D.C. (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; This hydrology transport model is actually based upon the pollutant-loading metric called "[[Total Maximum Daily Load]]" (TMDL), which addresses TDS and other specific chemical pollutants. The success of this model contributed to the Agency’s broadened commitment to the use of the underlying TMDL protocol in its national policy for management of many river systems in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;EPA. [http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=00001KIO.txt "Guidance for Water Quality-Based Decisions: The TMDL Process."] Doc. No. EPA 440/4-91-001. April 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practical implications==
[[Image:bristol.zoo.aquarium.arp.jpg|thumb|right|Aquarium at [[Bristol Zoo|Bristol Zoo, England]]. Maintenance of filters becomes costly with high TDS.]]
When measuring water treated with [[water softener]]s, high levels of total dissolved solids do not correlate to hard water, as water softeners do not reduce TDS; rather, they replace magnesium and calcium ions, which cause hard water, with an equal charge of sodium or potassium ions, e.g. Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ⇌ 2&amp;nbsp;Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, leaving overall TDS unchanged&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=W. Adam Sigler |first1=Jim Bauder |title=TDS Fact Sheet |url=http://waterquality.montana.edu/docs/homeowners/tds_fact_sheet.shtml |website= |publisher=Montana State University |accessdate=23 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429145631/http://waterquality.montana.edu/docs/homeowners/tds_fact_sheet.shtml |archive-date=2015-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; or even increased. [[Hard water]] can cause scale buildup in pipes, [[valve]]s, and [[filter (water)|filter]]s, reducing performance and adding to system maintenance costs. These effects can be seen in [[aquarium]]s, [[destination spa|spas]], [[swimming pool]]s, and [[reverse osmosis]] [[water treatment]] systems. Typically, in these applications, total dissolved solids are tested frequently, and filtration membranes are checked in order to prevent adverse effects.

In the case of [[hydroponics]] and [[aquaculture]], TDS is often monitored in order to create a water quality environment favorable for [[organism]] productivity. For freshwater [[oyster]]s, [[trout]]s, and other high value [[seafood]], highest productivity and economic returns are achieved by mimicking the TDS and [[pH]] levels of each [[species]]' native environment. For hydroponic uses, total dissolved solids is considered one of the best indices of nutrient availability for the aquatic plants being grown.

Because the threshold of acceptable [[aesthetic]] criteria for human drinking water is 500&amp;nbsp;mg/l, there is no general concern for [[odor]], taste, and [[color]] at a level much lower than is required for harm. A number of studies have been conducted and indicate various species' reactions range from intolerance to outright toxicity due to elevated TDS. The numerical results must be interpreted cautiously, as true toxicity outcomes will relate to specific chemical constituents. Nevertheless, some numerical information is a useful guide to the nature of risks in exposing aquatic organisms or terrestrial animals to high TDS levels. Most aquatic ecosystems involving mixed fish fauna can tolerate TDS levels of 1000&amp;nbsp;mg/l.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Water Quality: An Introduction |first=Claude E. |last=Boyd |publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers Group |location=The Netherlands |year=1999 |isbn=0-7923-7853-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Daphnia magna01.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Daphnia|Daphnia magna]]'' with eggs]]

The Fathead [[Leuciscinae|minnow]] (''Pimephales promelas''), for example, realizes an {{LD50}} concentration of 5600 ppm based upon a 96-hour exposure. LD50 is the concentration required to produce a lethal effect on 50&amp;nbsp;percent of the exposed [[population]]. ''[[Daphnia]] magna'', a good example of a primary member of the [[food chain]], is a small [[plankton]]ic [[crustacean]], about 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm in length, having an LD50 of about 10,000&amp;nbsp;ppm TDS for a 96-hour exposure.&lt;ref&gt;''Position Paper on Total Dissolved Solids'', State of Iowa, IAC 567 61.3 (2)g et sequitur updated March 27, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Spawn (biology)|Spawning]] [[fish]]es and juveniles appear to be more sensitive to high TDS levels. For example, it was found that concentrations of 350&amp;nbsp;mg/l TDS reduced spawning of [[Striped bass]] (''Morone saxatilis'') in the [[San Francisco Bay]]-Delta region, and that concentrations below 200&amp;nbsp;mg/l promoted even healthier spawning conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser Engineers, California, ''Final Report to the State of California, San Francisco Bay-Delta Water Quality Control Program'', State of California, Sacramento, CA (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Truckee River]], EPA found that juvenile [[Lahontan cutthroat trout]] were subject to higher mortality when exposed to [[thermal pollution]] stress combined with high total dissolved solids concentrations.&lt;ref name="hogan-papineau"/&gt;

For terrestrial animals, poultry typically possess a safe upper limit of TDS exposure of approximately 2900&amp;nbsp;mg/l, whereas dairy cattle are measured to have a safe upper limit of about 7100&amp;nbsp;mg/l. Research has shown that exposure to TDS is compounded in toxicity when other [[stressor]]s are present, such as abnormal pH, high [[turbidity]], or reduced [[dissolved oxygen]] with the latter stressor acting only in the case of animalia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= 	http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=9101UVQ5.txt |title=Statistical Prediction of Dynamic Thermal Equilibrium Temperatures using Standard Meteorological Data Bases |publisher=EPA |last1=Hogan |first1=C.

In countries with often-unsafe/unclean tap water supplies, such as much of India, the TDS of drinking water is often checked by technicians to gauge how effectively their RO/Water Filtration devices are working. While TDS readings will not give an answer as to the amount of microorganisms present in a sample of water, they can get a good idea as to the efficiency of the filter by how much TDS is present.

== Water classification ==
{{unsourced|section|date=October 2018}}
Water can be classified by the level of total dissolved solids (TDS) in the water:
*[[Fresh water]]:  TDS = 500 ppm
*[[Brackish water]]: TDS = 500 - 30,000 ppm
*[[Saline water]]: TDS = 30,000 - 40,000 ppm
*[[Hypersaline]]:TDS greater than 40,000 ppm

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27073">A '''transgene''' is a [[gene]] or [[Genetics|genetic]] material that has been transferred naturally, or by any of a number of [[genetic engineering]] techniques from one organism to another. The introduction of a transgene (called "[[transgenesis]]") has the potential to change the [[phenotype]] of an organism.

In its most precise usage, the term ''transgene'' describes a segment of [[DNA]] containing a gene sequence that has been isolated from one organism and is introduced into a different organism.  This non-native segment of DNA may either retain the ability to produce [[RNA]] or [[protein]] in the transgenic organism or alter the normal function of the transgenic organism's genetic code. In general, the DNA is incorporated into the organism's [[germ line]].  For example, in [[higher vertebrates]] this can be accomplished by injecting the foreign DNA into the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] of a fertilized [[ovum]]. This technique is routinely used to introduce human disease genes or other genes of interest into strains of [[Laboratory mouse|laboratory mice]] to study the function or [[pathology]] involved with that particular gene.

The construction of a transgene requires the assembly of a few main parts. The transgene must contain a [[Promoter (genetics)|promoter]], which is a regulatory sequence that will determine where and when the transgene is active, an [[exon]], a protein coding sequence (usually derived from the [[complementary DNA|cDNA]] for the protein of interest), and a stop sequence. These are typically combined in a bacterial [[plasmid]] and the coding sequences are typically chosen from transgenes with previously known functions.&lt;ref name="renamed_from_1_on_20130507103349"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://mgc.wustl.edu/Protocols/TransgeneDesign/tabid/153/Default.aspx|authors=A.

Transgenic or [[genetically modified organism]]s, be they bacteria, viruses or fungi, serve all kinds of research purposes. [[Transgenic plant]]s, insects, fish and mammals have been bred. Transgenic plants such as corn and soybean have replaced wild strains in agriculture in some countries (e.g. the United States). Transgene escape has been documented for GMO crops since 2001 with persistence and invasiveness. Transgenetic organisms pose ethical questions and may cause [[biosafety]] problems.

==History==

The idea of shaping an organism to fit a specific need isn't a new science; selective breeding of animals and plants started before recorded history. However, until the late 1900s farmers and scientist could breed new strains of a plant or organism only from closely related species, because the DNA had to be compatible for offspring to be able to reproduce another generation.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

In the 1970 and 1980s, scientists passed this hurdle by inventing procedures for combining the DNA of two vastly different species with genetic engineering. The organisms produced by these procedures were termed transgenic. Transgenesis is the same as [[gene therapy]] in the sense that they both transform cells for a specific purpose. However, they are completely different in their purposes, as gene therapy aims to cure a defect in cells, and transgenesis seeks to produce a genetically modified organism by incorporating the specific transgene into every cell and changing the [[genome]]. Transgenesis will therefore change the germ cells, not only the somatic cells, in order to ensure that the transgenes are passed down to the offspring when the organisms reproduce. Transgenes alter the genome by blocking the function of a host gene; they can either replace the host gene with one that codes for a different protein, or introduce an additional gene.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The first transgenic organism was created in 1974 when Annie Chang and [[Stanley Norman Cohen|Stanley Cohen]] expressed ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' genes in ''[[Escherichia coli]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chang |first1=A.

Most of the very first transmutations were performed by [[microinjection]] of DNA directly into cells. Scientists were able to develop other methods to perform the transformations, such as incorporating transgenes into [[retrovirus]]es and then infecting cells, using electroinfusion which takes advantage of an electric current to pass foreign DNA through the cell wall, [[gene gun|biolistics]] which is the procedure of shooting DNA bullets into cells, and also delivering DNA into the egg that has just been fertilized.&lt;ref name="renamed_from_2_on_20130507103349"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://salempress.com/store/samples/encyclopedia_of_genetics_rev/encyclopedia_of_genetics_rev_transgenic.htm|editor=Bryan D.

The first transgenic animals were only intended for genetic research to study the specific function of a gene, and by 2003, thousands of genes had been studied.

==Use in plants==
A variety of [[transgenic plant]]s have been designed for agriculture to produce [[genetically modified crops]], such as corn, soybean, rapeseed oil, cotton, rice and more. {{As of|2012}}, these GMO crops were planted on 170&amp;nbsp;million hectares globally.&lt;ref name=gilbert&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gilbert |first=N. |title=Case studies: A hard look at GM crops |journal=Nature |date=2013 |volume=497 |number=7447 |pages=24–26 |pmid=23636378 |doi=10.1038/497024a |url=http://www.nature.com/news/case-studies-a-hard-look-at-gm-crops-1.12907 |accessdate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Golden rice===

One example of a transgenic plant species is [[golden rice]].  In 1997,{{Citation needed|reason=references used are from 1988|date=November 2017}} five million children developed [[xerophthalmia]], a medical condition caused by [[vitamin A]] deficiency, in Southeast Asia alone.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://jn.nutrition.org/content/119/1/96.full.pdf|title = New imperatives for an old vitamin (A)|last = Sommer|first = Alfred|date = 1988|journal = Journal of Nutrition|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Of those children, a quarter million went blind.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  To combat this, scientists used [[Gene gun|biolistics]] to insert the daffodil [[phytoene synthase]] gene into Asia indigenous rice [[cultivar]]s.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Transgenic Rice (Oryza Sativa) Endosperm Expressing Daffodil (Narcissus Pseudonarcissus) Phytoene Synthase Accumulates Phytoene, a Key Intermediate of Provitamin A Biosynthesis|last = Burkhardt|first = P.K.|date = 1997|journal = Plant Journal|doi = 10.1046/j.1365-313x.1997.11051071.x|pmid = 9193076 |pages=1071–1078 |volume=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The daffodil insertion increased the production of [[Beta-Carotene|ß-carotene]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The product was a transgenic rice species rich in vitamin A, called [[golden rice]].

===Transgene escape===
The escape of genetically-engineered plant genes via hybridization with wild relatives was first discussed and examined in Mexico&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Arias |first1=D. M. |last2=Rieseberg |first2=L.

There is agreement that escape of transgenes is inevitable, even "some proof that it is happening".&lt;ref name=gilbert/&gt;  Up until 2008 there were few documented cases.&lt;ref name=gilbert/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kristin L.

====Corn====
Corn sampled in 2000 from the [[Sierra Juarez, Oaxaca]], Mexico contained a transgenic 35S promoter, while a large sample taken by a different method from the same region in 2003 and 2004 did not. A sample from another region from 2002 also did not, but directed samples taken in 2004 did, suggesting transgene persistence or re-introduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Piñeyro-Nelson A, Van Heerwaarden J, Perales HR, Serratos-Hernández JA, Rangel A, Hufford MB, Gepts P, Garay-Arroyo A, Rivera-Bustamante R, Alvarez-Buylla ER.|title=Transgenes in Mexican maize: molecular evidence and methodological considerations for GMO detection in landrace populations|journal=Molecular Ecology|date=February 2009|volume=18|issue=4| pages=750–61 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-294X.2008.03993.x|pmid=19143938|pmc=3001031 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 study found recombinant proteins in 3.1% and 1.8% of samples, most commonly in southeast Mexico. Seed and grain import from the United States could explain the frequency and distribution of transgenes in west-central Mexico, but not in the southeast. Also, 5.0% of corn seed lots in Mexican corn stocks expressed recombinant proteins despite the moratorium on GM crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Dyer GA, Serratos-Hernandez JA, Perales HR, Gepts P, Pineyro-Nelson A|editor=Hany A.

====Cotton====
In 2011, transgenic cotton was found in Mexico among wild cotton, after 15 years of GMO cotton cultivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Wegier, A., Piñeyro-Nelson, A., Alarcón, J., Gálvez-Mariscal, A., Álvarez-Buylla, E.

====Rapeseed (canola)====
Transgenic rapeseed ''Brassicus napus'', hybridized with a native Japanese species ''[[Brassica rapa]]'', was found in Japan in 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Aono, M., Wakiyama, S., Nagatsu, M., Kaneko, Y., Nishizawa, T., Nakajima, N., Tamaoki, M., Kubo, A., Saji, H.|title=Seeds of a possible natural hybrid between herbicide-resistant Brassica napus and Brassica rapa detected on a riverbank in Japan|journal=GM Crops|year=2011|volume=2|issue=3|pages=201–10|doi=10.4161/gmcr.2.3.18931}}&lt;/ref&gt; after they had been identified 2006 in [[Québec]], Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Simard, M.-J., Légère, A., Warwick, S.I.|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233507005_Transgenic_Brassica_napus_field_and_Brassica_rapa_weeds_in_Quebec_Sympatry_and_weed-crop_in_situ_hybridization|title=Transgenic Brassica napus fields and Brassica rapa weeds in Québec: sympatry and weedcrop in situ hybridization|journal=Canadian Journal of Botany|year=2006|volume=84|issue=12|pages=1842–1851|doi=10.1139/b06-135}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were persistent over a 6-year study period, without herbicide selection pressure and despite hybridization with the wild form.

====Creeping bentgrass====
Transgenic [[Agrostis stolonifera|creeping bentgrass]], engineered to be [[glyphosate]]-tolerant as "one of the first wind-pollinated, perennial, and highly outcrossing transgenic crops", was planted in 2003 as part of a large (about 160 ha) field trial in central Oregon near [[Madras, Oregon]]. In 2004, its pollen was found to have reached wild growing bentgrass populations up to 14 kilometres away. Cross-pollinating ''[[Agrostis gigantea]]'' was even found at a distance of 21 kilometres.&lt;ref name=watrud&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Watrud, L.S., Lee, E.H., Fairbrother, A., Burdick, C., Reichman, J.R., Bollman, M., Storm, M., King, G.J., Van de Water, P.K. |year=2004|title=Evidence for landscape-level, pollen-mediated gene flow from genetically modified creeping bentgrass with CP4 EPSPS as a marker|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=101|issue=40|pages=14533–14538|pmid=15448206|doi=10.1073/pnas.0405154101|pmc=521937}}&lt;/ref&gt; The grower, [[Scotts Company]] could not remove all genetically engineered plants, and in 2007, the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] fined Scotts $500,000 for noncompliance with regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=USDA|url=http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome?contentidonly=true&amp;contentid=2007/11/0350.xml|title=USDA concludes genetically engineered creeping bentgrass investigation—USDA Assesses The Scotts Company, LLC $500,000 Civil Penalty|date=26 November 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208173644/http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome?contentidonly=true&amp;contentid=2007%2F11%2F0350.xml|archivedate=8 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Risk assessment====
The long-term monitoring and controlling of a particular transgene has been shown not to be feasible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=van Heerwaarden J, Ortega Del Vecchyo D, Alvarez-Buylla ER, Bellon MR.|PMC=3463572 |title=New genes in traditional seed systems: diffusion, detectability and persistence of transgenes in a maize metapopulation|journal=PLOS ONE|year=2012|volume=7|issue=10|page=e46123|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0046123|pmid=23056246}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Food Safety Authority]] published a guidance for risk assessment in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=EFSA|url=http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/1879|title=Guidance on the environmental risk assessment of genetically modified plants|journal=EFSA Journal|year=2010|volume=8|issue=11|page=1879|doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2010.1879}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in mice==

[[Genetically modified mouse|Genetically modified mice]] are the most common animal model for transgenic research.&lt;ref name="renamed_from_3_on_20130507103349"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geneticsandsociety.org/article.php?id=386|title=Background: Cloned and Genetically Modified Animals|work=Center for Genetics and Society|date=April 14, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transgenic mice are currently being used to study a variety of diseases including cancer, obesity, heart disease, arthritis, anxiety, and Parkinson’s disease.&lt;ref name="renamed_from_4_on_20130507103349"&gt;{{cite web|title=Knockout Mice|url=http://www.genome.gov/12514551|work=National Human Genome Research Institute|date=August 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two most common types of genetically modified mice are [[knockout mouse|knockout mice]] and [[oncomouse|oncomice]]. Knockout mice are a type of mouse model that uses transgenic insertion to disrupt an existing gene’s expression. In order to create knockout mice, a transgene with the desired sequence is inserted into an isolated mouse [[blastocyst]] using [[electroporation]]. Then, [[homologous recombination]] occurs naturally within some cells, replacing the gene of interest with the designed transgene. Through this process, researchers were able to demonstrate that a transgene can be integrated into the genome of an animal, serve a specific function within the cell, and be passed down to future generations.&lt;ref name="renamed_from_6_on_20130507103349"&gt;[[Genetically modified mouse#cite note-8]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Oncomice are another genetically modified mouse species created by inserting transgenes that increase the animal’s vulnerability to cancer. Cancer researchers utilize oncomice to study the profiles of different cancers in order to apply this knowledge to human studies.&lt;ref name="renamed_from_6_on_20130507103349"/&gt;

==Use in ''Drosophila''==

Multiple studies have been conducted concerning transgenesis in ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', the fruit fly.  This organism has been a helpful genetic model for over 100 years, due to its well-understood developmental pattern.  The transfer of transgenes into the ''Drosophila'' genome has been performed using various techniques, including [[P element]], [[Cre-Lox recombination|Cre-loxP]], and [[Site-specific recombinase technology|ΦC31]] insertion.  The most practiced method used thus far to insert transgenes into the ''Drosophila'' genome utilizes P elements. The transposable P elements, also known as [[Transposable element|transposons]], are segments of bacterial DNA that are translocated into the genome, without the presence of a complementary sequence in the host’s genome.  P elements are administered in pairs of two, which flank the DNA insertion region of interest.  Additionally, P elements often consist of two plasmid components, one known as the P element transposase and the other, the P transposon backbone.  The transposase plasmid portion drives the transposition of the P transposon backbone, containing the transgene of interest and often a marker, between the two terminal sites of the transposon. Success of this insertion results in the nonreversible addition of the transgene of interest into the genome. While this method has been proven effective, the insertion sites of the P elements are often uncontrollable, resulting in an unfavorable, random insertion of the transgene into the ''Drosophila'' genome.&lt;ref name="renamed_from_7_on_20130507103349"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Venken |first1=K. J. T. |last2=Bellen |first2=H. J. |date=2007 |title=Transgenesis upgrades for Drosophila melanogaster |journal=Development |volume=134 |pages=3571–3584 |doi=10.1242/dev.005686 |pmid=17905790}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To improve the location and precision of the transgenic process, an enzyme known as [[Cre recombinase|Cre]] has been introduced.  Cre has proven to be a key element in a process known as recombination-mediated cassette exchange [[Recombinase-mediated cassette exchange|(RMCE)]].  While it has shown to have a lower efficiency of transgenic transformation than the P element transposases, Cre greatly lessens the labor-intensive abundance of balancing random P insertions. Cre aids in the targeted transgenesis of the DNA gene segment of interest, as it supports the mapping of the transgene insertion sites, known as loxP sites.  These sites, unlike P elements, can be specifically inserted to flank a chromosomal segment of interest, aiding in targeted transgenesis.  The Cre transposase is important in the catalytic cleavage of the base pairs present at the carefully positioned loxP sites, permitting more specific insertions of the transgenic donor plasmid of interest.&lt;ref name="renamed_from_8_on_20130507103349"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Oberstein, A., Pare, A., Kaplan, L., Small, S.|year=2005|title=Site-specific transgenesis by Cre-mediated recombination in Drosophila|journal=Nature Methods|volume=2|pages=583–585|doi=10.1038/nmeth775|pmid=16094382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To overcome the limitations and low yields that transposon-mediated and Cre-loxP transformation methods produce, the bacteriophage [[Site-specific recombinase technology|ΦC31]] has recently been utilized. Recent breakthrough studies involve the microinjection of the bacteriophage ΦC31 integrase, which shows improved transgene insertion of large DNA fragments that are unable to be transposed by P elements alone. This method involves the recombination between an attachment (attP) site in the [[Bacteriophage|phage]] and an attachment site in the bacterial host genome (attB).  Compared to usual P element transgene insertion methods, ΦC31 integrates the entire transgene vector, including bacterial sequences and antibiotic resistance genes.  Unfortunately, the presence of these additional insertions has been found to affect the level and reproducibility of transgene expression.

==Future potential==

The study of application of transgenes is a rapidly growing area of [[molecular biology]]. In fact, it is predicted that in the next two decades, 300 000 lines of transgenic mice will be generated.&lt;ref name="renamed_from_9_on_20130507103349"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Houdebine, L.-M. |year=2005|title=Use of Transgenic Animals to Improve Human Health and Animal Production|journal=Reproduction in Domestic Animals|volume=40|issue=5|pages=269–281|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0531.2005.00596.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have identified many applications for transgenes, particularly in the medical field. Scientists are focusing on the use of transgenes to study the function of the [[human genome]] in order to better understand disease, adapting animal organs for [[Organ transplant|transplant]]ation into humans, and the production of [[pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceutical products]] such as [[insulin]], [[growth hormone]], and blood anti-clotting factors from the milk of transgenic cows.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

There are currently five thousand known [[genetic disease]]s, and the potential to treat these diseases using transgenic animals is, perhaps, one of the most promising applications of transgenes. There is a potential to use human [[gene therapy]] to replace a mutated gene with an unmutated copy of a transgene in order to treat the genetic disorder. This can be done through the use of Cre-Lox or [[Gene knockout|knockout]]. Moreover, genetic disorders are being studied through the use of transgenic mice, pigs, rabbits, and rats. More recently, scientists have also begun using transgenic goats to study genetic disorders related to [[fertility]].&lt;ref name="renamed_from_10_on_20130507103349"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kues WA, Niemann H|year=2004|title=The contribution of farm animals to human health|journal=Trends Biotechnol|volume=22|issue=6|pages=286–294|pmid=15158058|doi=10.1016/j.tibtech.2004.04.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transgenes may soon be used for xenotransplantation from pig organs. Through the study of xeno-organ rejection, it was found that an acute rejection of the transplanted organ occurs upon the organ's contact with blood from the recipient due to the recognition of foreign [[antibody|antibodies]] on [[endothelial cell]]s of the transplanted organ. Scientists have identified the antigen in pigs that causes this reaction, and therefore are able to transplant the organ without immediate rejection by removal of the antigen. However, the antigen begins to be expressed later on, and rejection occurs. Therefore, further research is being conducted.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Transgenes are being used by manufactures to produce goods such as milk with high levels of proteins, silk from the milk of goats, and [[microorganisms]] that are capable of producing [[protein]]s that contain [[enzyme]]s that increase the rate of industrial reactions. Agricultural applications aim to selectively breed animals for particular traits and animals that are resistant to diseases.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Ethical controversy==

Transgene use in humans is currently fraught with issues. Transformation of genes into human cells has not been perfected yet. The most famous example of this involved certain patients developing T-cell leukemia after being treated for [[X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency]] (X-SCID).&lt;ref name="renamed_from_11_on_20130507103349"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Woods, N.-B., Bottero, V., Schmidt, M., von Kalle, C. &amp; Verma, I. M. |journal=Nature|title=Gene therapy: Therapeutic gene causing lymphoma|volume=440|page=1123|year=2006|doi=10.1038/4401123a|pmid=16641981}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was attributed to the close proximity of the inserted gene to the [[LMO2]] promoter, which controls the transcription of the LMO2 proto-oncogene.&lt;ref name="renamed_from_12_on_20130507103349"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Hacein-Bey-Abina, S.|title=LMO2-Associated Clonal T Cell Proliferation in Two Patients after Gene Therapy for SCID-X1|journal=Science|date=17 October 2003|volume=302|number=5644|pages=415–419|doi=10.1126/science.1088547|display-authors=etal|pmid=14564000}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In common with most forms of genetic engineering, the use of transgenes for purposes other than to correct life-threatening genetic abnormalities is a major bioethical issue.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

The '''Universidad de la Sierra Juárez''' '''(UNSIJ)''' is a [[university]] located in the town of [[Ixtlán de Juárez]] in the [[Mexico|Mexican]] state of [[Oaxaca]].  It is part of the State University System of Oaxaca (SUNEO) and is public institution of [[higher education]] and scientific research.  The university is funded by the Oaxaca State Government and the Mexican Federal Government.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unsij.edu.mx/nuestrauniversidad.html|title=UNSIJ: About our University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ixtlán de Juárez===
The town of Ixtlán de Juárez existed before the [[Spanish Conquest of Mexico]].  It is thought to have been founded in the latter half of the 15th century, by [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] people from the region around [[Tarabundi]] and [[San Pedro Laduu]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cdi.gob.mx/planes_desarrollo/oaxaca/05_ixtlan_de_juarez.pdf |title=Ixtlán de Juárez: Plan for integrated, sustainable and pluricultural development |access-date=2009-10-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217091721/http://www.cdi.gob.mx/planes_desarrollo/oaxaca/05_ixtlan_de_juarez.pdf |archive-date=2012-02-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }} (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; (though there are also [[neolithic]] remains in the area).&lt;ref&gt;Entry for Ixtlán de Juárez in the Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; The first settlers were probably warriors establishing a defensive outpost against [[Aztec]] invaders.  In 1859 Ixtlán was the site of a battle during the [[Reform War]] between liberal and conservative forces.  Some of the other communities in the municipality are probably several centuries older than the town of Ixtlán &lt;ref&gt;Jaffee, op. cit., p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

===University establishment===
As a rural mountainous region, higher education had previously not been available.  In April 2005 the government of the state of Oaxaca established the Universidad de la Sierra Juarez to help further the development and education of citizens in the [[Sierra Madre de Oaxaca|Sierra Norte]] region.  Currently the university offers degrees in the fields of [[forestry]], [[computer science]], [[environmental science]], [[biology]] and natural resource technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unsij.edu.mx/ensenanza.html#oferta UNSIJ: Educational offerings]&lt;/ref&gt;    UNSIJ also encourages four core academic activities among its students, including: teaching, research, cultural enrichment, and promotion of regional development.&lt;ref name="University"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unsij.edu.mx/nuestrauniversidad.html|title=Universidad de la Sierra Juárez:¿Qué es la UNSIJ?}}&lt;/ref&gt;
