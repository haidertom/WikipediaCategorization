      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6616">In the mathematical field of [[category theory]], an '''allegory''' is a [[category (mathematics)|category]] that has some of the structure of the category of sets and [[binary relation]]s between them. Allegories can be used as an abstraction of categories of relations, and in this sense the theory of allegories is a generalization of [[relation algebra]] to relations between different sorts. Allegories are also useful in defining and investigating certain constructions in category theory, such as [[regular category|exact]] completions.

In this article we adopt the convention that morphisms compose from right to left, so ''RS'' means "first do ''S'', then do ''R''".

==Definition==

An allegory is a [[Category (mathematics)|category]] in which
* every morphism ''R'' : ''X → Y'' is associated with an '''anti-involution''', i.e. a morphism ''R''° : ''Y → X'' with ° satisfying ''R''°° = ''R'' and (''RS'')° = ''S''°''R''°; and
* every pair of morphisms ''R'',''S'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' with common domain/codomain is associated with an '''intersection''', i.e. a morphism ''R''∩''S'' : ''X'' → ''Y''
all such that
* intersections are idempotent (''R''∩''R'' = ''R''), commutative (''R''∩''S'' = ''S''∩''R''), and associative (''R''∩''S'')∩''T'' = ''R''∩(''S''∩''T'');
* anti-involution distributes over intersection ((''R''∩''S'')° = ''S''°∩''R''°);
* composition is semi-distributive over intersection (''R''(''S''∩''T'')⊆''RS''∩''RT'', (''R''∩''S'')''T''⊆''RT''∩''ST''); and
* the modularity law is satisfied: (''RS''∩''T''⊆(''R''∩''TS''°)''S'').
Here, we are abbreviating using the order defined by the intersection: "''R''⊆''S''" means "''R'' = ''R''∩''S''".

A first example of an allegory is the [[Category of relations|category of sets and relations]]. The objects of this allegory are sets, and a morphism ''X → Y'' is a binary relation between ''X'' and ''Y''. Composition of morphisms is [[composition of relations]]; intersection of morphisms is [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of relations.

==Regular categories and allegories==

===Allegories of relations in regular categories===

In a category ''C'', a '''relation''' between objects ''X'', ''Y'' is a [[span (category theory)|span]] of morphisms ''X←R→Y'' that is jointly-monic. Two such spans ''X←S→Y'' and ''X←T→Y'' are considered equivalent when there is an isomorphism between S and T that make everything commute, and strictly speaking relations are only defined up to equivalence (one may formalise this either using equivalence classes or using bicategories). If the category ''C'' has products, a relation between ''X'' and ''Y'' is the same thing as a [[monomorphism]] into ''X''×''Y'' (or an equivalence class of such). In the presence of pullbacks and a proper [[factorization system]], one can define the composition of relations. The composition of ''X←R→Y←S→Z'' is found by first pulling back the cospan ''R→Y←S'' and then taking the jointly-monic image of the resulting span ''X←R←·→S→Z''.

Composition of relations will be associative if the factorization system is appropriately stable. In this case one can consider a category Rel(''C''), with the same objects as ''C'', but where morphisms are relations between the objects. The identity relations are the diagonals ''X''→''X''×''X''.

Recall that a [[regular category]] is a category with finite limits and images in which covers are stable under pullback. A regular category has a stable regular epi/mono factorization system. The category of relations for a regular category is always an allegory. Anti-involution is defined by turning the source/target of the relation around, and intersections are intersections of subobjects, computed by pullback.

===Maps in allegories, and tabulations===

A morphism ''R'' in an allegory ''A'' is called a '''map''' if it is entire (1⊆''R''°''R'') and deterministic (''RR''°⊆1). Another way of saying this: a map is a morphism that has a [[adjoint functor|right adjoint]] in ''A'', when ''A'' is considered, using the local order structure, as a [[2-category]]. Maps in an allegory are closed under identity and composition. Thus there is a subcategory Map(''A'') of ''A'', with the same objects but only the maps as morphisms. For a regular category ''C'', there is an isomorphism of categories ''C''≅Map(Rel(''C'')). In particular, a morphism in Map(Rel('''Set''')) is just an ordinary set function.

In an allegory, a morphism ''R:X→Y'' is '''tabulated''' by a pair of maps ''f'':''Z→X'', ''g'':''Z→Y'' if ''gf''°=R and ''f''°''f''∩''g''°''g''=1. An allegory is called '''tabular''' if every morphism has a tabulation. For a regular category ''C'', the allegory Rel(''C'') is always tabular. On the other hand, for any tabular allegory ''A'', the category Map(''A'') of maps is a locally regular category: it has pullbacks, equalizers and images that are stable under pullback. This is enough to study relations in Map(''A'') and, in this setting, ''A''≅Rel(Map(''A'')).

===Unital allegories and regular categories of maps===

A '''unit''' in an allegory is an object ''U'' for which the identity is the largest morphism ''U→U'', and such that from every other object there is an entire relation to ''U''. An allegory with a unit is called '''unital'''. Given a tabular allegory ''A'', the category Map(''A'') is a regular category (it has a terminal object) if and only if ''A'' is unital.

===More sophisticated kinds of allegory===
Additional properties of allegories can be axiomatized. '''Distributive allegories''' have a [[union (set theory)|union]]-like operation that is suitably well-behaved, and '''division allegories''' have a generalization of the division operation of [[relation algebra]]. '''Power allegories''' are distributive division allegories with additional [[powerset]]-like structure. The connection between allegories and regular categories can be developed into a connection between power allegories and [[toposes]].

{{Hinduism_small}}
The [[Katha Upanishad]] (1.12-13) mentions aa  ''puruṣa'' (man, being) of the size of the thumb (''aṅgúṣṭha'') enshrined in the interiors of the heart (''hridaye guhaayaam'' "cave of the heart") of a human being.

:"The  purusha, who is of the size of a thumb, resides in the body.
:The purusha who is the size of a thumb is a light (jyoti) without smoke."

Certain other Upanishads describe the purusha to be of a golden (hiranmaya) hue and the purursha as a golden being (hiranmaya purusha). The purusha is seated inside the cave of the human heart. As per [[Hindu]] religious beliefs, the heart is identified as the abode of divinity within the body. In [[Bhagavat Gita|Gita]], Lord Krishna enunciated that he stays within heart of each human being.

This "being" dwelling inside the heart has been equated with the ‘jiva’ or the ‘self’ which carries the consciousness and a meta-physical body (prakriti), also termed as the ''karana sharira''. The ''karana sharira'' has most transcendental existence and accumulates the experiences of the physical, earthly life. This 'jiva' is a spark of divinity, and its place in the body is the heart region.(Heart means not the physical heart But the spiritual heart or the heart chakra.)

As per Sri [[Aurobindo]], the angustha purusha is made up of elements of ''chaitya'' (''chetna''), ''i.e.'' the angustha purusha is a being existing at the psychic (Chetas) sphere. Sri [[Aurobindo]] mentions that behind the ordinary [[chakra]] of the human heart region, inside a deep cave ''nihite guhayam'' as described by the Upanishads, is the center where a divine spark is present. This thumb-sized purusha is the bird in the twin-bird analogy of the [[Rigveda]] and [[Sankhya]] (''dvau suparna sayuja sakhaya'') which actually gets involved in the [[prakriti]] and suffers and/or enjoys the fruits of its [[Karma]].

As per Upanishads, the ''hiranmaya angustha purusha'' embodies the karana sharira. This ''hiranmaya angustha purusha'' is the vehicle of transmigration of soul among births.

The visualizations regarding the size of the 'self' has been of great significance in the Upansihads. The [[Brhadaranyaka]] Upanishad in V. 5.6.1 and the [[Chandogya]] Upanishad in V.3.14.3 maintain the size of the self to be equal to a seed. The  Shatapata Brahmana, V.10.6.3, mentions that the self:&lt;br&gt;
...in the interior of my heart, is as tiny like a rice or barley or millet seed and golden like a smokeless light (or flame).

The ''angustha purusha'' is indestructible and resplendent and is contra-distinct from the [[Purusha sukta#Purusha|purusha]] of the [[Purusha sukta]]. The ''angustha purusha'' is individualistic ''jivaatma'' while the primeval ''purursha'' of the [[purusha sukta]] is the collective ''paramatma''.

'''ArtFutura''' is a festival of digital culture and creativity that is celebrated annually in [[Barcelona]], [[Buenos Aires]], Ibiza, London, Montevideo and several other cities worldwide. It came about from the confluence of interests of some of the pioneers of the [[Cyberculture]] movement from the 90s, among whom were, [[Rebecca Allen (artist)|Rebecca Allen]], [[William Gibson]] and [[Montxo Algora]], who presently continues to direct the festival.

== Main venue and CircuitoFutura ==
[[Image:Festival ArtFutura Circuito.JPG|right|400px|thumb]]

Every edition of ArtFutura is dedicated to a central theme and includes a diversity of activities: conferences, workshops, exhibitions, live shows and an audiovisual program which includes the latest novelties in digital creativity.

The festival has a main venue, which started as being [[Barcelona]], later moved to [[Madrid]] and [[Seville]] and then to a different city every year.

A large part of the content of each edition is developed in Barcelona and Madrid although connections by means of video conferences are established with other cities in which the festival is held.

Among the cities in which ArtFutura is presented are included Buenos Aires, Bogotá, Granada, Lisbon, London, Madrid, México DF, Montevideo, Palma de Mallorca, Paris, Punta del Este,  São Paulo, Santiago de Chile, Torino, Tenerife, Vigo and Vitoria-Gasteiz.

== Souls&amp;Machines ==

A '''bicycle''', also called a '''cycle''' or '''bike''', is a [[human-powered transport|human-powered]] or [[motorized bicycle|motor-powered]], [[bicycle pedal|pedal-driven]], [[single-track vehicle]], having two [[bicycle wheel|wheels]] attached to a [[bicycle frame|frame]], one behind the other. A {{vanchor|bicycle rider|BICYCLE_RIDER}} is called a [[Cycling|cyclist]], or bicyclist.

Bicycles were introduced in the late 19th century in Europe, and by the early 21st century, more than 1 billion were in existence at a given time.&lt;ref name=Koeppel2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Economist2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=worldmeters/&gt; These numbers far exceed the number of cars, both in total and ranked by the number of individual models produced.&lt;ref name=Squatriglia2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=AMA2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt;
They are the principal [[means of transportation]] in many regions. They also provide a popular form of recreation, and have been adapted for use as children's toys, [[Physical fitness|general fitness]], military and police applications, [[courier services]], [[bicycle racing]] and bicycle stunts.

The basic shape and configuration of a typical [[Safety bicycle|upright or "safety bicycle"]], has changed little since the first [[Chain drive|chain-driven]] model was developed around 1885.{{sfn|Herlihy|2004|pp=200–50}}{{sfn|Herlihy|2004|pp=266–71}}{{sfn|Herlihy|2004|p=280}} However, many details have been improved, especially since the advent of [[modern materials]] and [[computer-aided design]]. These have allowed for a proliferation of specialized designs for many types of [[cycling]].

The bicycle's invention has had an enormous effect on society, both in terms of culture and of advancing modern industrial methods. Several components that eventually played a key role in the development of the automobile were initially invented for use in the bicycle, including [[ball bearing]]s, [[pneumatic tires]], [[chain-driven sprocket]]s and [[wire wheels|tension-spoked wheels]].&lt;ref&gt;Heitmann JA. ''The Automobile and American Life''. McFarland, 2009, {{ISBN|0786440139}}, pp. 11 and following&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''bicycle'' first appeared in English print in ''[[The Daily News (UK)|The Daily News]]'' in 1868, to describe "Bysicles and trysicles" on the "Champs Elysées and Bois de Boulogne".&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{OED|bicycle}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word was first used in 1847 in a French publication to describe an unidentified two-wheeled vehicle, possibly a carriage.&lt;ref name=OED/&gt; The design of the bicycle was an advance on the [[velocipede]], although the words were used with some degree of overlap for a time.&lt;ref name=OED/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bicycle |title=bicycle (n.) |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other words for bicycle include "bike",&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|bike}}&lt;/ref&gt; "pushbike",&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|pushbike}}&lt;/ref&gt; "pedal cycle",&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|pedal cycle}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "cycle".&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|cycle}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Unicode]], the [[code point]] for "bicycle" is 0x1F6B2. The [[Numeric character reference|entity]] &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#x1F6B2;&lt;/code&gt; in [[HTML]] produces 🚲.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1F680.pdf |title=Transport and Map Symbols |publisher=unicode.org |accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of the bicycle}}
[[File:Draisine or Laufmaschine, around 1820. Archetype of the Bicycle. Pic 01.jpg|thumb|Wooden ''[[Dandy horse|draisine]]'' (around 1820), the first two-wheeler and as such the archetype of the bicycle]]
The "[[Dandy horse]]", also called Draisienne or Laufmaschine, was the first human means of transport to use only two wheels in [[tandem]] and was invented by the German [[Freiherr|Baron]] [[Karl Drais|Karl von Drais]]. It is regarded as the modern bicycle's forerunner; Drais introduced it to the public in [[Mannheim]] in summer 1817 and in Paris in 1818.&lt;ref name=csts&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Canada Science and Technology Museum |title=Baron von Drais' Bicycle |url=http://www.sciencetech.technomuses.ca/english/collection/cycles2.cfm |accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Herlihy|2004|p=26}} Its rider sat astride a wooden frame supported by two in-line wheels and pushed the vehicle along with his or her feet while steering the front wheel.&lt;ref name=csts/&gt;

[[File:Michauxjun.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|Michaux's son on a velocipede 1868]]
The first mechanically-propelled, two-wheeled vehicle may have been built by [[Kirkpatrick MacMillan]], a Scottish blacksmith, in 1839, although the claim is often disputed.{{sfn|Herlihy|2004|pp=66–67}} He is also associated with the first recorded instance of a [[cycling]] traffic offense, when a [[Glasgow]] newspaper in 1842 reported an accident in which an anonymous "gentleman from Dumfries-shire... bestride a velocipede... of ingenious design" knocked over a little girl in Glasgow and was fined five [[shilling]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-13040607 |title=Is dangerous cycling a problem? |publisher=BBC News |date=13 April 2011 |accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1860s, Frenchmen [[Pierre Michaux]] and [[Pierre Lallement]] took bicycle design in a new direction by adding a mechanical [[Crank (mechanism)|crank]] drive with pedals on an enlarged front wheel (the [[velocipede]]). This was the first in mass production. Another French inventor named Douglas Grasso had a failed prototype of Pierre Lallement's bicycle several years earlier. Several inventions followed using rear-wheel drive, the best known being the rod-driven velocipede by Scotsman [[Thomas McCall]] in 1869. In that same year, bicycle wheels with wire spokes were patented by Eugène Meyer of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;''Bulletin des lois de la République française'' (1873) 12th series, vol. 6, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8S0UAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA648#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 648, patent no. 86,705: "Perfectionnements dans les roues de vélocipèdes"] (Improvements in the wheels of bicycles), issued: 4 August 1869.&lt;/ref&gt; The French ''vélocipède'', made of iron and wood, developed into the "[[penny-farthing]]" (historically known as an "ordinary bicycle", a [[retronym]], since there was then no other kind).{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=50}} It featured a tubular steel frame on which were mounted wire-spoked wheels with solid rubber tires. These bicycles were difficult to ride due to their high seat and poor [[weight distribution]]. In 1868 Rowley Turner, a sales agent of the Coventry Sewing Machine Company (which soon became the [[Hillman#History|Coventry Machinists Company]]), brought a Michaux cycle to [[Coventry]], England. His uncle, Josiah Turner, and business partner [[James Starley]], used this as a basis for the 'Coventry Model' in what became Britain's first cycle factory.&lt;ref&gt;McGrory, David. ''A History of Coventry'' (Chichester: Phillimore, 2003), p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1886 Starley 'Rover' Safety Cycle British Motor Museum 09-2016 (29928044262).jpg|thumb|1886 [[Rover Company#Before cars|Rover]] [[safety bicycle]] at the [[British Motor Museum]]. The first modern bicycle, it featured a rear-wheel-drive, [[chain-drive]]n cycle with two similar-sized wheels. Dunlop's [[pneumatic tire]] was added to the bicycle in 1888.]]
The ''dwarf ordinary'' addressed some of these faults by reducing the front wheel diameter and setting the [[bicycle seat|seat]] further back. This, in turn, required gearing—effected in a variety of ways—to efficiently use pedal power. Having to both pedal and steer via the front wheel remained a problem. Englishman [[John Kemp Starley|J.K. Starley]] (nephew of James Starley), J.H. Lawson, and Shergold solved this problem by introducing the [[chain drive]] (originated by the unsuccessful "bicyclette" of Englishman Henry Lawson),{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=47}} connecting the frame-mounted cranks to the rear wheel. These models were known as [[safety bicycle]]s, dwarf safeties, or upright bicycles for their lower seat height and better weight distribution, although without pneumatic tires the ride of the smaller-wheeled bicycle would be much rougher than that of the larger-wheeled variety. Starley's 1885 [[Rover Company|Rover]], manufactured in Coventry&lt;ref&gt;McGrory, p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; is usually described as the first recognizably modern bicycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cycle market: Moving into the fast lane|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/cycle-market-moving-into-the-fast-lane-1702191.html|agency=The Independent|date=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon the ''seat tube'' was added, creating the modern bike's double-triangle ''diamond frame''.

[[File:John Boyd Dunlop (c1915).jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[John Boyd Dunlop]] on a bicycle c. 1915]]
Further innovations increased comfort and ushered in a second [[bicycle craze]], the 1890s ''Golden Age of Bicycles''. In 1888, Scotsman [[John Boyd Dunlop]] introduced the first practical [[pneumatic tire]], which soon became universal. [[Willie Hume]] demonstrated the supremacy of Dunlop's tyres in 1889, winning the tyre's first-ever races in Ireland and then England.&lt;ref name="Gold Hume"&gt;[http://www.thepedalclub.org/archives/goldenbook/u-z/WilliamHume.html The Golden Book of Cycling – William Hume, 1938.

[[Derailleur gears|Dérailleur gears]] and hand-operated [[Bowden cable]]-pull brakes were also developed during these years, but were only slowly adopted by casual riders.

The [[Svea Velocipede]] with vertical pedal arrangement and [[locking hubs]] was introduced in 1892 by the Swedish engineers [[Fredrik Ljungström]] and [[Birger Ljungström]]. It attracted attention at the [[World Fair]] and was produced in a few thousand units.

[[File:Old CTC sign.jpg|thumb|[[Cycling UK|Cyclists' Touring Club]] sign on display at the [[National Museum of Scotland]]]]

In the 1870s many [[cycling club]]s flourished. They were popular in a time when there were not cars on the market and the principal mode of transportation was [[horse-drawn vehicle]]s, such the [[horse and buggy]] or the [[horsecar]]. Among the earliest clubs was [[Cycling UK|The Bicycle Touring Club]], which has operated since 1878.
By the turn of the century, cycling clubs flourished on both sides of the Atlantic, and touring and racing became widely popular. The [[Raleigh Bicycle Company]] was founded in Nottingham, England in 1888. It became the biggest bicycle manufacturing company in the world, making over two million bikes per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=On Your Bike...|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/eastmidlands/series2/raleigh_bikes_cycling.shtml|agency=BBC|date=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bicycles and horse buggies were the two mainstays of private transportation just prior to the automobile, and the grading of smooth roads in the late 19th century was stimulated by the widespread advertising, production, and use of these devices.{{sfn|Herlihy|2004|p=280}} More than 1 billion bicycles have been manufactured worldwide as of the early 21st century.&lt;ref name=Koeppel2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Economist2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=worldmeters/&gt; Bicycles are the most common [[vehicle]] of any kind in the world, and the most numerous model of any kind of vehicle, whether human-powered or [[motor vehicle]], is the Chinese [[Flying Pigeon]], with numbers exceeding 500 million.&lt;ref name=Koeppel2007/&gt; The next most numerous vehicle, the [[Honda Super Cub]] motorcycle, has more than 60 million units made, while most produced car, the [[Toyota Corolla]], has reached 35 million and counting.&lt;ref name=Squatriglia2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=AMA2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt;&lt;ref name=FoxBusiness/&gt;

==Uses==
From the beginning and still today, bicycles have been and are employed for many uses. In a utilitarian way, bicycles are used for transportation, [[bicycle commuting]], and [[utility cycling]]. It can be used as a 'work horse', used by [[Bicycle mail|mail carriers]], [[paramedic]]s, [[Police bicycle|police]], [[Bicycle messenger|messengers]], and [[Freight bicycle|general delivery]] services. Military uses of bicycles include [[Military communications|communications]], [[reconnaissance]], troop movement, supply of provisions, and [[patrol]]. See also: [[bicycle infantry]].

The bicycle is also used for recreational purposes, such as [[bicycle touring]], [[mountain biking]], [[physical fitness]], and play. [[Cycle sport|Bicycle competition]] includes [[Road bicycle racing|racing]], [[BMX racing]], [[Track cycling|track racing]], [[criterium]], [[bicycle rollers|roller racing]], [[cyclosportive|sportives]] and [[time trial]]s. Major multi-stage professional events are the [[Giro d'Italia]], the [[Tour de France]], the [[Vuelta a España]], the [[Tour de Pologne]], and the [[Volta a Portugal]].

Bikes can be used for entertainment and pleasure, such as in organised mass rides, [[artistic cycling]] and [[freestyle BMX]].

==Technical aspects==

The bicycle has undergone continual adaptation and improvement since its inception. These innovations have continued with the advent of modern materials and computer-aided design, allowing for a proliferation of specialized bicycle types, improved [[bicycle safety]], and riding comfort.

===Types===
{{Main|List of bicycle types}}
Bicycles can be categorized in many different ways: by function, by number of riders, by general construction, by gearing or by means of propulsion. The more common types include [[utility bicycle]]s, [[mountain bicycle]]s, [[racing bicycle]]s, [[touring bicycle]]s, [[hybrid bicycle]]s, [[cruiser bicycle]]s, and [[BMX bike]]s. Less common are [[tandem bicycle|tandems]], [[Lowrider bicycle|low riders]], [[tall bike]]s, [[Fixed-gear bicycle|fixed gear]], [[folding bicycle|folding models]], [[amphibious bicycles]], cargo bikes, [[recumbent bicycle|recumbents]] and [[electric bicycles]].

[[Unicycle]]s, [[tricycle]]s and [[Quadracycle (human-powered vehicle)|quadracycles]] are not strictly bicycles, as they have respectively one, three and four wheels, but are often referred to informally as "bikes" or "cycles".

===Dynamics===
{{Main|Bicycle and motorcycle dynamics}}
A bicycle stays upright while moving forward by being steered so as to keep its [[center of mass]] over the wheels.&lt;ref name=NS2581&gt;{{cite journal

The combined center of mass of a bicycle and its rider must lean into a turn to successfully navigate it. This lean is induced by a method known as [[countersteering]], which can be performed by the rider turning the handlebars directly with the [[hand]]s&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{cite book

===Performance===
{{Main|Bicycle performance}}
The bicycle is extraordinarily efficient in both biological and mechanical terms. The bicycle is the most efficient human-powered means of transportation in terms of energy a person must expend to travel a given distance.&lt;ref&gt;S. S. Wilson, "Bicycle Technology", ''[[Scientific American]]'', March 1973&lt;/ref&gt; From a mechanical viewpoint, up to 99% of the energy delivered by the rider into the pedals is transmitted to the wheels, although the use of gearing mechanisms may reduce this by 10–15%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pedal power probe shows bicycles waste little energy |url=http://www.jhu.edu/~gazette/1999/aug3099/30pedal.html |work=Johns Hopkins Gazette |date=August 30, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="whitt"&gt;{{cite book

In terms of the ratio of cargo weight a bicycle can carry to total weight, it is also an efficient means of cargo transportation.

A human traveling on a bicycle at low to medium speeds of around {{Convert|16|–|24|km/h|abbr=on|0}} uses only the power required to walk. Air drag, which is proportional to the square of speed, requires dramatically higher power outputs as speeds increase. If the rider is sitting upright, the rider's body creates about 75% of the total drag of the bicycle/rider combination. Drag can be reduced by seating the rider in a more [[aerodynamic]]ally streamlined position. Drag can also be reduced by covering the bicycle with an aerodynamic [[Bicycle fairing|fairing]]. The fastest recorded unpaced speed on a flat surface is {{Convert|144.18|km/h|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="upi"&gt;{{cite web

In addition, the [[carbon dioxide]] generated in the production and transportation of the food required by the bicyclist, per mile traveled, is less than 1/10 that generated by energy efficient motorcars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kenkifer.com/bikepages/advocacy/bike_co2.htm |title=How Much Do Bicycles Pollute?

==Parts==

===Frame===
{{Main|Bicycle frame}}

[[File:Bicycle diagram-en.svg|thumb|Diagram of a bicycle.]]

The great majority of modern bicycles have a frame with upright seating that looks much like the first chain-driven bike.{{sfn|Herlihy|2004|pp=200–50}}{{sfn|Herlihy|2004|pp=266–71}}{{sfn|Herlihy|2004|p=280}} These upright bicycles almost always feature the ''diamond frame'', a [[truss]] consisting of two triangles: the front triangle and the rear triangle. The front triangle consists of the head tube, top tube, down tube, and seat tube. The head tube contains the [[headset (bicycle part)|headset]], the set of bearings that allows the [[bicycle fork|fork]] to turn smoothly for steering and balance. The top tube connects the head tube to the seat tube at the top, and the down tube connects the head tube to the [[bottom bracket]]. The rear triangle consists of the seat tube and paired chain stays and seat stays. The chain stays run parallel to the [[bicycle chain|chain]], connecting the bottom bracket to the rear [[Fork end|dropout]], where the axle for the rear wheel is held. The seat stays connect the top of the seat tube (at or near the same point as the top tube) to the rear fork ends.

[[File:Triumph Bicycle.JPG|left|thumb|A [[Triumph Cycle Co. Ltd.|Triumph]] with a [[step-through frame]].]]
Historically, women's bicycle frames had a top tube that connected in the middle of the seat tube instead of the top, resulting in a lower [[Frame geometry|standover height]] at the expense of compromised structural integrity, since this places a strong bending load in the seat tube, and bicycle frame members are typically weak in bending. This design, referred to as a ''[[step-through frame]]'' or as an ''open frame'', allows the rider to mount and dismount in a dignified way while wearing a skirt or dress. While some women's bicycles continue to use this frame style, there is also a variation, the ''[[mixte]]'', which splits the top tube laterally into two thinner top tubes that bypass the seat tube on each side and connect to the rear fork ends. The ease of stepping through is also appreciated by those with limited flexibility or other joint problems. Because of its persistent image as a "women's" bicycle, step-through frames are not common for larger frames.

Step-throughs were popular partly for practical reasons and partly for social mores of the day. For most of the history of bicycles' popularity women have worn long skirts, and the lower frame accommodated these better than the top-tube. Furthermore, it was considered "unladylike" for women to open their legs to mount and dismount – in more conservative times women who rode bicycles at all were vilified as immoral or immodest. These practices were akin to the older practice of riding horse [[sidesaddle]].

Another style is the [[recumbent bicycle]]. These are inherently more aerodynamic than upright versions, as the rider may lean back onto a support and operate pedals that are on about the same level as the seat. The world's fastest bicycle is a recumbent bicycle but this type was banned from competition in 1934 by the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.recumbent-bikes-truth-for-you.com/history.html |title=History Loudly Tells Why The Recumbent Bike Is Popular Today |publisher=Recumbent-bikes-truth-for-you.com |date=1934-04-01 |accessdate=2011-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Trek Y Foil.jpg|thumb|right|A carbon fiber [[Trek Bicycle Corporation|Trek]] Y-Foil from the late 1990s]]
Historically, materials used in bicycles have followed a similar pattern as in aircraft, the goal being high strength and low weight. Since the late 1930s alloy steels have been used for frame and fork tubes in higher quality machines. By the 1980s aluminum welding techniques had improved to the point that aluminum tube could safely be used in place of steel. Since then aluminum alloy frames and other components have become popular due to their light weight, and most mid-range bikes are now principally aluminum alloy of some kind.{{Where?|date=August 2012}} More expensive bikes use [[carbon fibre]] due to its significantly lighter weight and profiling ability, allowing designers to make a bike both stiff and compliant by manipulating the lay-up. Virtually all professional racing bicycles now use carbon fibre frames, as they have the best strength to weight ratio. A typical modern carbon fiber frame can weighs less than {{convert|1|kg|lb}}.

Other exotic frame materials include [[titanium]] and advanced alloys. [[Bamboo]], a natural [[composite material]] with high strength-to-weight ratio and [[stiffness]]&lt;ref name=Lakkad&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0015056881900233 |title=Mechanical properties of bamboo, a natural composite |last1=Lakkad |last2=Patel |journal=Fibre Science and Technology |volume=14 |issue=4 |date=June 1981 |pages=319–22 |doi=10.1016/0015-0568(81)90023-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been used for bicycles since 1894.&lt;ref name=lukenbill&gt;{{cite web

===Drivetrain and gearing===
{{Main|Bicycle drivetrain systems}}
[[File:Dsb-1.jpg|thumb|left|text-top|A [[Shaft-driven bicycle|bicycle with shaft drive]] instead of a chain]]
[[File:Shimano xt rear derailleur.jpg|upright|thumb|A set of rear sprockets (also known as a cassette) and a derailleur]]
[[File:Hub gear.jpg|upright|thumb|Hub gear]]

The ''drivetrain'' begins with pedals which rotate the [[Crank set|cranks]], which are held in axis by the bottom bracket. Most bicycles use a chain to transmit power to the rear wheel. A very small number of bicycles use a shaft drive to transmit power, or special belts. Hydraulic bicycle transmissions have been built, but they are currently inefficient and complex.

Since cyclists' legs are most efficient over a narrow range of pedaling speeds, or [[Cadence (cycling)|cadence]], a variable [[gear ratio]] helps a cyclist to maintain an optimum pedalling speed while covering varied terrain. Some, mainly utility, bicycles use [[hub gear]]s with between 3 and 14 ratios, but most use the generally more efficient dérailleur system, by which the chain is moved between different cogs called chainrings and sprockets in order to select a ratio. A dérailleur system normally has two dérailleurs, or mechs, one at the front to select the [[chainring]] and another at the back to select the sprocket. Most bikes have two or three chainrings, and from 5 to 11 sprockets on the back, with the number of theoretical gears calculated by multiplying front by back. In reality, many gears overlap or require the chain to run diagonally, so the number of usable gears is fewer.

An alternative to chaindrive is to use a synchronous belt. These are toothed and work much the same as a chain – popular with commuters and long distance cyclists they require little maintenance. They can't be shifted across a cassette of sprockets, and are used either as single speed or with a hub gear.

[[Bicycle gearing|Different gears and ranges of gears]] are appropriate for different people and styles of cycling. Multi-speed bicycles allow gear selection to suit the circumstances: a cyclist could use a high gear when cycling downhill, a medium gear when cycling on a flat road, and a low gear when cycling uphill. In a lower gear every turn of the pedals leads to fewer rotations of the rear wheel. This allows the energy required to move the same distance to be distributed over more pedal turns, reducing fatigue when riding uphill, with a heavy load, or against strong winds. A higher gear allows a cyclist to make fewer pedal turns to maintain a given speed, but with more effort per turn of the pedals.

With a ''chain drive'' transmission, a ''chainring'' attached to a crank drives the chain, which in turn rotates the rear wheel via the rear sprocket(s) ([[cassette (bicycle part)|cassette]] or [[Cogset#Freewheels|freewheel]]). There are four gearing options: two-speed hub gear integrated with chain ring, up to 3 chain rings, up to 11 sprockets, hub gear built into rear wheel (3-speed to 14-speed). The most common options are either a rear hub or multiple chain rings combined with multiple sprockets (other combinations of options are possible but less common).

===Steering===
[[File:Anatomic bicycle grips made of leather.jpg|thumb|left|Bicycle grips made of leather. Anatomic shape distributes weight over [[hand|palm area]] to prevent Cyclist's palsy ([[Ulnar tunnel syndrome|Ulnar syndrome]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid = 12860549|year = 2003|last1 = Patterson|first1 = J.

I.|doi = 10.1177/03635465030310041801}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[Bicycle handlebar|handlebars]] connect to the [[Stem (bike)|stem]] that connects to the fork that connects to the front wheel, and the whole assembly connects to the bike and rotates about the steering axis via the [[Headset (bicycle part)|headset]] bearings. Three styles of handlebar are common. ''Upright handlebars'', the norm in Europe and elsewhere until the 1970s, curve gently back toward the rider, offering a natural grip and comfortable upright position. ''Drop handlebars'' "drop" as they curve forward and down, offering the cyclist best braking power from a more aerodynamic "crouched" position, as well as more upright positions in which the hands grip the brake lever mounts, the forward curves, or the upper flat sections for increasingly upright postures. Mountain bikes generally feature a 'straight handlebar' or 'riser bar' with varying degrees of sweep backwards and centimeters rise upwards, as well as wider widths which can provide better handling due to increased leverage against the wheel.

===Seating===
[[File:San marco selle1.jpg|thumb|left|A Selle San Marco saddle designed for women]]
[[Bicycle saddle|Saddles]] also vary with rider preference, from the cushioned ones favored by short-distance riders to narrower saddles which allow more room for leg swings. Comfort depends on riding position. With comfort bikes and hybrids, cyclists sit high over the seat, their weight directed down onto the saddle, such that a wider and more cushioned saddle is preferable. For racing bikes where the rider is bent over, weight is more evenly distributed between the handlebars and saddle, the hips are flexed, and a narrower and harder saddle is more efficient. Differing saddle designs exist for male and female cyclists, accommodating the genders' differing anatomies and sit bone width measurements, although bikes typically are sold with saddles most appropriate for men. Suspension seat posts and seat springs provide comfort by absorbing shock but can add to the overall weight of the bicycle.

A recumbent bicycle has a reclined [[Bicycle seat|chair-like seat]] that some riders find more comfortable than a saddle, especially riders who suffer from certain types of seat, back, neck, shoulder, or wrist pain. Recumbent bicycles may have either under-seat or over-seat [[Recumbent bicycle#Steering|steering]].

===Brakes===
{{Main|Bicycle brake}}
[[File:Brake.agr-edit.jpg|thumb|upright|Linear-pull brake, also known by the [[Shimano]] trademark: V-Brake, on rear wheel of a [[mountain bike]]]]
Bicycle brakes may be rim brakes, in which friction pads are compressed against the wheel rims; hub brakes, where the mechanism is contained within the wheel hub, or disc brakes, where pads act on a rotor attached to the hub. Most road bicycles use rim brakes, but some use disk brakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cyclingtips.com.au/2013/10/disc-brakes-and-road-bikes-what-does-the-future-hold/ |title=Disc Brakes and Road Bikes: What does the Future Hold? |publisher=cyclingtips.com.au |date=1 October 2013 |accessdate=24 February 2014 |author=Wade Wallace}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Disc brakes]] are more common for mountain bikes, tandems and recumbent bicycles than on other types of bicycles, due to their increased power, coupled with an increased weight and complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sheldonbrown.com/disc-brakes.html |title=Disc Brakes |publisher=sheldonbrown.com |author=John Allan |accessdate=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BrakeDiskVR.JPG|thumb|left|A front disc brake, mounted to the [[Bicycle fork|fork]] and hub]]
With hand-operated brakes, force is applied to brake levers mounted on the handlebars and transmitted via Bowden cables or [[hydraulic]] lines to the friction pads, which apply pressure to the braking surface, causing friction which slows the bicycle down. A rear hub brake may be either hand-operated or pedal-actuated, as in the back pedal ''coaster brakes'' which were popular in North America until the 1960s.

[[Track bicycle]]s do not have brakes, because all riders ride in the same direction around a track which does not necessitate sharp deceleration. Track riders are still able to slow down because all track bicycles are fixed-gear, meaning that there is no freewheel. Without a freewheel, coasting is impossible, so when the rear wheel is moving, the cranks are moving. To slow down, the rider applies resistance to the pedals, acting as a braking system which can be as effective as a conventional rear wheel brake, but not as effective as a front wheel brake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Suspension===
{{Main|Bicycle suspension}}

Bicycle suspension refers to the system or systems used to ''suspend'' the rider and all or part of the bicycle. This serves two purposes: to keep the wheels in continuous contact with the ground, improving control, and to isolate the rider and luggage from jarring due to rough surfaces, improving comfort.

Bicycle suspensions are used primarily on mountain bicycles, but are also common on hybrid bicycles, as they can help deal with problematic vibration from poor surfaces. Suspension is especially important on recumbent bicycles, since while an upright bicycle rider can stand on the pedals to achieve some of the benefits of suspension, a recumbent rider cannot.

Basic mountain bicycles and hybrids usually have front suspension only, whilst more sophisticated ones also have rear suspension. Road bicycles tend to have no suspension.

===Wheels and tires===
{{Main|Bicycle wheel|Bicycle tire}}

The wheel axle fits into fork ends in the frame and fork. A pair of wheels may be called a wheelset, especially in the context of ready-built "off the shelf", performance-oriented wheels.

Tires vary enormously depending on their intended purpose. [[Road bicycles]] use tires 18 to 25 millimeters wide, most often completely smooth, or [[slick tire|slick]], and inflated to high pressure in order to roll fast on smooth surfaces. Off-road tires are usually between {{Convert|38|and|64|mm|abbr=on}} wide, and have treads for gripping in muddy conditions or metal studs for ice.

===Accessories===
[[File:Loaded touring bicycle.JPG|thumb|Touring bicycle equipped with front and rear [[Luggage carrier|racks]], fenders/mud-guards, water bottles in [[Bottle cage|cages]], four [[pannier]]s and a handlebar bag.]]

Some components, which are often optional accessories on sports bicycles, are standard features on utility bicycles to enhance their usefulness, comfort, safety and visibility. [[Mudguard]]s, or [[Fender (vehicle)|fenders]], protect the cyclist and [[moving parts]] from spray when riding through wet areas and [[chainguard]]s protect clothes from oil on the chain while preventing clothing from being caught between the chain and [[crankset]] teeth. [[Kick stand]]s keep bicycles upright when parked, and [[bike lock]]s deter theft. Front-mounted [[bicycle basket|baskets]], front or rear [[luggage carrier]]s or racks, and [[pannier]]s mounted above either or both wheels can be used to carry equipment or cargo. Pegs can be fastened to one, or both of the wheel hubs to either help the rider perform certain tricks, or allow a place for extra riders to stand, or rest.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Parents sometimes add rear-mounted [[Baby transport|child seats]], an auxiliary saddle fitted to the crossbar, or both to transport children. [[Training wheels]] are sometimes used when learning to ride.

[[Clipless#Clipless pedals|Toe-clips]] and toestraps and [[Bicycle pedal#Clipless pedals|clipless pedals]] help keep the foot locked in the proper pedal position and enable cyclists to pull and push the pedals. Technical accessories include [[cyclocomputer]]s for measuring speed, distance, heart rate, GPS data etc. Other accessories include [[bicycle lighting|lights]], reflectors, mirrors, racks, trailers, bags, water bottles and [[Bottle cage|cages]], and [[Bicycle bell|bell]].&lt;ref name="bicycleuniverse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bicycleuniverse.info/eqp/accessories.html#safety |title=Safety Accessories |accessdate=2006-09-13 |last=Bluejay |first=Michael |work=Bicycle Accessories |publisher=BicycleUniverse.info| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061008024853/http://bicycleuniverse.info/eqp/accessories.html| archivedate= 8 October 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bicycle lights, reflectors, and helmets are required by law in some geographic regions depending on the legal code. It is more common to see bicycles with bottle generators, dynamos, lights, fenders, racks and bells in Europe. Bicyclists also have specialized form fitting and high visibility clothing.

[[Bicycle helmet]]s can reduce injury in the event of a collision or accident, and a suitable helmet is legally required of riders in many jurisdictions. Helmets may be classified as an accessory&lt;ref name="bicycleuniverse" /&gt; or as an item of clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bicycling.about.com/library/weekly/aa041098.htm |title=The Essentials of Bike Clothing |accessdate=2006-09-13 |work=About Bicycling |publisher=About.com| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060826085232/http://bicycling.about.com/library/weekly/aa041098.htm| archivedate= 26 August 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bicycle trainer|Bike trainers]] are used to enable cyclists to cycle while the bike remains stationary. They are frequently used to warm up before races or indoors when riding conditions are unfavorable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bicycleadvisor.com/best-bike-trainer/ |title= Bicycle Advisor |publisher=bicycleadvisor.com |accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bicycles can also be fitted with a hitch to tow a [[bicycle trailer|trailer]] for carrying cargo, a child, or both.

===Standards===
A number of formal and industry standards exist for bicycle components to help make spare parts exchangeable and to maintain a minimum product safety.

The [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) has a special technical committee for cycles, TC149, that has the scope of "Standardization in the field of cycles, their components and accessories with particular reference to terminology, testing methods and requirements for performance and safety, and interchangeability".

The [[European Committee for Standardization]] (CEN) also has a specific Technical Committee, TC333, that defines European standards for cycles. Their mandate states that EN cycle standards shall harmonize with [[List of ISO standards|ISO standards]]. Some CEN cycle standards were developed before ISO published their standards, leading to strong European influences in this area. European cycle standards tend to describe minimum safety requirements, while ISO standards have historically harmonized parts geometry.&lt;ref&gt;The TC149 ISO bicycle committee, including the TC149/SC1 ("Cycles and major sub-assemblies") subcommittee, has published the following standards:{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}
* [[ISO 4210]] Cycles—Safety requirements for bicycles
* [[ISO 6692]] Cycles—Marking of cycle components
* [[ISO 6695]] Cycles—Pedal axle and crank assembly with square end fitting—Assembly dimensions
* [[ISO 6696]] Cycles—Screw threads used in bottom bracket assemblies
* [[ISO 6697]] Cycles—Hubs and freewheels—Assembly dimensions
* [[ISO 6698]] Cycles—Screw threads used to assemble freewheels on bicycle hubs
* [[ISO 6699]] Cycles—Stem and handlebar bend—Assembly dimensions
* [[ISO 6701]] Cycles—External dimensions of spoke nipples
* [[ISO 6742]] Cycles—Lighting and retro-reflective devices—Photometric and physical requirements
* [[ISO 8090]] Cycles—Terminology (same as BS 6102-4)
* [[ISO 8098]] Cycles—Safety requirements for bicycles for young children
* [[ISO 8488]] Cycles—Screw threads used to assemble head fittings on bicycle forks
* [[ISO 8562]] Cycles—Stem wedge angle
* [[ISO 10230]] Cycles—Splined hub and sprocket—Mating dimensions
* [[ISO 11243]] Cycles—Luggage carriers for bicycles—Concepts, classification and testing

Other ISO Technical Committees have published various cycle relevant standards, for example:
* [[ISO 5775]] Bicycle tire and rim designations
* [[ISO 9633]] Cycle chains—Characteristics and test methods

Published cycle standards from CEN TC333 include:
* [[EN 14764]] City and trekking bicycles – Safety requirements and test methods
* [[EN 14765]] Bicycles for young children – Safety requirements and test methods
* [[EN 14766]] Mountain-bicycles – Safety requirements and test methods
* [[EN 14781]] Racing bicycles – Safety requirements and test methods
* [[EN 14782]] Bicycles – Accessories for bicycles – Luggage carriers
* [[EN 15496]] Cycles – Requirements and test methods for cycle locks

Yet to be approved cycle standards from CEN TC333:
* [[EN 15194]] Cycles—Electrically power assisted cycles ([[Electric bicycle#cite ref-15|EPAC]] bicycle)
* [[EN 15532]] Cycles—Terminology
* 00333011 Cycles – Bicycles trailers – safety requirements and test methods&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maintenance and repair==
Maintenance of adequate tire inflation is the most frequent and troublesome concern for cyclists and many means and methods are employed to preserve pneumatic integrity. Thicker tires, thicker tubes, tire liners (of a number of rather impenetrable devices installed between the tire and tube), liquid sealing compounds squeezed into the tube, and automotive-style patch kits are all used to reliably contain the typical tire pressures of 40 to 60 pounds per square inch that are required for bicycle operation. Thin, light bicycle tires are particularly vulnerable to penetration and subsequent deflation caused by [[goat's head]]s and other [[bur]]s, colloquially known as stickers. Inflation of bicycle tires to pressures higher than typical for automotive use requires special pumps. The complexity of bicycle tire maintenance and repair may cause many to not consider the bicycle for transport or leisure.

Some bicycle parts, particularly hub-based gearing systems, require considerable torque for dis-assembly and may thus need professional services. [[Self-service]] and assisted-service [[Maintenance, repair, and operations|maintenance and repair]] may be available.
* Some cyclists choose self-service: they maintain their own bicycles, perhaps as part of their enjoyment of the hobby of cycling or simply for economic reasons.
* There exist several hundred assisted-service Community Bicycle Organizations worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Bicycle Organizations|url=http://www.bikecollectives.org/wiki/index.php?title=Community_Bicycle_Organizations|publisher=Bike Collective Network wiki|accessdate=15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a Community Bicycle Organization, [[wikt:layperson#Noun|laypeople]] bring in bicycles needing repair or maintenance; volunteers teach them how to do the required steps.
* Full service is available from [[bicycle mechanic]]s at a [[local bike shop]]. In areas where it is available, some cyclists purchase roadside assistance from companies such as the [[Better World Club]] or the [[American Automobile Association]].

===Tools===
[[File:Puncture-repaire-kit.jpg|thumb|Puncture repair kit with tire levers, [[sandpaper]] to clean off an area of the inner tube around the puncture, a tube of rubber solution ([[Vulcanization|vulcanizing]] fluid), round and oval patches, a metal grater and piece of chalk to make chalk powder (to dust over excess rubber solution). Kits often also include a wax crayon to mark the puncture location.]]
{{main|Bicycle tools}}

There are specialized bicycle tools for use both in the shop and on the road. Many cyclists carry tool kits. These may include a tire patch kit (which, in turn, may contain any combination of a [[Bicycle pump|hand pump]] or [[Bicycle pump#CO2 Inflators|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Pump]], [[tire lever]]s, spare [[Inner tube|tubes]], self-adhesive patches, or tube-patching material, an adhesive, a piece of sandpaper or a metal grater (for roughing the tube surface to be patched), Special, thin wrenches are often required for maintaining various screw fastened parts, specifically, the frequently lubricated ball-bearing "cones".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

There are also cycling specific [[multi-tool]]s that combine many of these implements into a single compact device. More specialized bicycle components may require more complex tools, including proprietary tools specific for a given manufacturer.

==Social and historical aspects==
The bicycle has had a considerable effect on human society, in both the cultural and industrial realms.

===In daily life===
Around the turn of the 20th century, bicycles reduced crowding in inner-city tenements by allowing workers to commute from more spacious dwellings in the suburbs. They also reduced dependence on horses. Bicycles allowed people to travel for leisure into the country, since bicycles were three times as energy efficient as walking and three to four times as fast.

In built up cities around the world, [[urban planning]] uses [[cycling infrastructure]] like bikeways to reduce [[traffic congestion]] and [[air pollution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 3005092 | pmid=21174189 | doi=10.1007/s11524-010-9509-6 | volume=87 | issue=6 | title=Built environment influences on healthy transportation choices: bicycling versus driving | year=2010 | journal=J Urban Health | pages=969–93 | last1 = Winters | first1 = M | last2 = Brauer | first2 = M | last3 = Setton | first3 = EM | last4 = Teschke | first4 = K}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of cities around the world have implemented schemes known as [[bicycle sharing system]]s or community bicycle programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shaheen |first1=Susan |last2=Guzman |first2=Stacey |last3=Zhang |first3=Hua |title=Bikesharing in Europe, the Americas, and Asia |journal=Transportation Research Record |volume=2143 |year=2010 |pages=159–67 |doi=10.3141/2143-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaheen |first=Stacey |author2=Stacey Guzman |title=Worldwide Bikesharing |journal=Access Magazine |year=2011 |url=http://uctc.net/access/39/access39_bikesharing.shtml |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326063609/http://www.uctc.net/access/39/access39_bikesharing.shtml |archivedate=2012-03-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these was the White Bicycle plan in [[Amsterdam]] in 1965.

In [[Copenhagen]], a cyclists' organization runs a Cycling Embassy that promotes biking for commuting and sightseeing. The United Kingdom has a tax break scheme (IR 176) that allows employees to buy a new bicycle tax free to use for commuting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclescheme.co.uk/|title=Tax free bikes for work through the Government's Green Transport Initiative  |publisher=Cyclescheme}}{{psc|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Netherlands all train stations offer free bicycle parking, or a more secure parking place for a small fee, with the larger stations also offering bicycle repair shops. Cycling is so popular that the parking capacity may be exceeded, while in some places such as Delft the capacity is usually exceeded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

There are towns in some countries where [[bicycle culture]] has been an integral part of the landscape for generations, even without much official support. That is the case of [[Ílhavo Municipality|Ílhavo]], in Portugal.

In cities where bicycles are not integrated into the public transportation system, commuters often use bicycles as elements of a [[mixed-mode commuting|mixed-mode commute]], where the bike is used to travel to and from train stations or other forms of rapid transit. Some students who commute several miles drive a car from home to a campus parking lot, then ride a bicycle to class. [[Folding bicycle]]s are useful in these scenarios, as they are less cumbersome when carried aboard. Los Angeles removed a small amount of seating on some trains to make more room for bicycles and wheel chairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Some US companies, notably in the [[High tech#Technology sectors|tech sector]], are developing both innovative cycle designs and cycle-friendliness in the workplace. [[Foursquare]], whose [[CEO]] [[Dennis Crowley]] "pedaled to pitch meetings ...

Parking in the office was also integral to HQ planning. Mitchell Moss, who runs the [[Rudin Center for Transportation Policy &amp; Management]] at [[New York University]], said in 2012: "Biking has become the mode of choice for the educated high tech worker".&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Andrea, [http://www.marketplace.org/topics/tech/transportation-nation/techies-cutting-edge-bike-commuting "Techies on the cutting edge... of bike commuting"], ''[[Marketplace (radio program)|Marketplace]]'', February 22, 2012.

Bicycles offer an important mode of transport in many developing countries. Until recently, bicycles have been a staple of everyday life throughout Asian countries. They are the most frequently used method of transport for commuting to work, school, shopping, and life in general. In Europe, bicycles are commonly used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/parallels/2013/10/24/240493422/in-most-every-european-country-bikes-are-outselling-cars|title=In Almost Every European Country, Bikes Are Outselling New Cars|date=24 October 2013|publisher=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also offer a degree of exercise to keep individuals healthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.worldwatch.org/files/pdf/WP90BICYCLE.pdf |first=Marcia D. |last=Lowe |year=1989 |title=The Bicycle: Vehicle for a Small Planet |publisher=Worldwatch Institute |isbn=978-0916468910}}{{page needed|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transport, if analyzed for the cost-benefit analysis for rural [[Poverty reduction|poverty alleviation]], has given one of the best returns in this regard. For example, road investments in India were a staggering 3-10 times more effective than almost all other investments and subsidies in rural economy in the decade of the 1990s. What a road does at a macro level to increase transport, the bicycle supports at the micro level. The bicycle, in that sense, can be an important poverty-eradication tool in poor nations.

The safety bicycle gave women unprecedented mobility, contributing to [[Emancipation of women|their emancipation]] in Western nations. As bicycles became safer and cheaper, more women had access to the personal freedom that bicycles embodied, and so the bicycle came to symbolize the [[New Woman]] of the late 19th century, especially in Britain and the United States.{{sfn|Herlihy|2004|pp=266–71}}&lt;ref name="Distillations"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roberts |first1=Jacob |title=Women's work |journal=Distillations |date=2017|volume=3|issue=1 |pages=6–11 |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/womens-work|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bike boom#1890s|bicycle craze in the 1890s]] also led to a movement for so-called [[Victorian dress reform|rational dress]], which helped liberate women from corsets and ankle-length skirts and other restrictive garments, substituting the then-shocking [[bloomers (clothing)|bloomers]].{{sfn|Herlihy|2004|pp=266–71}}

The bicycle was recognized by 19th-century feminists and [[suffragist]]s as a "freedom machine" for women. American [[Susan B. Anthony]] said in a ''[[New York World]]'' interview on February 2, 1896:
"I think it has done more to emancipate woman than any one thing in the world. I rejoice every time I see a woman ride by on a wheel. It gives her a feeling of self-reliance and independence the moment she takes her seat; and away she goes, the picture of untrammelled womanhood."&lt;ref name=HustedHarper1898/&gt;{{rp|859}} In 1895 [[Frances Willard (suffragist)|Frances Willard]], the tightly laced president of the [[Woman’s Christian Temperance Union]], wrote ''A Wheel Within a Wheel: How I Learned to Ride the Bicycle, with Some Reflections by the Way'', a 75-page illustrated memoir praising "Gladys", her bicycle, for its "gladdening effect" on her health and political optimism.&lt;ref name=Willard1895/&gt; Willard used a cycling metaphor to urge other suffragists to action.&lt;ref name=Willard1895/&gt;

===Economic implications===
[[File:Columbia Bicycles 1886 Advertisement.svg|left|thumb|upright|[[Columbia Bicycles]] advertisement from 1886]]
[[Bicycle industry|Bicycle manufacturing]] proved to be a training ground for other industries and led to the development of advanced metalworking techniques, both for the frames themselves and for special components such as [[ball bearing]]s, [[washer (mechanical)|washers]], and sprockets. These techniques later enabled skilled metalworkers and mechanics to develop the components used in early automobiles and aircraft.

[[Wright brothers|Wilbur and Orville Wright]], a pair of businessmen, ran the [[Wright Cycle Company]] which designed, manufactured and sold their bicycles during the [[bike boom]] of the 1890s.&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11373/ |title = Wilbur Wright Working in the Bicycle Shop |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1897 |accessdate = 2013-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They also served to teach the industrial models later adopted, including mechanization and [[mass production]] (later copied and adopted by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[General Motors]]),{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=23}}{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=106}}{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=108}} vertical integration{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=106}} (also later copied and adopted by Ford), aggressive advertising{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|pp=142–47}} (as much as 10% of all advertising in U.S. periodicals in 1898 was by bicycle makers),{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=145}} lobbying for better roads (which had the side benefit of acting as advertising, and of improving sales by providing more places to ride),{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=108}} all first practiced by Pope.{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=108}} In addition, bicycle makers adopted the annual model change{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=23}}&lt;ref&gt;Babaian, Sharon. ''The Most Benevolent Machine: A Historical Assessment of Cycles in Canada'' (Ottawa: National Museum of Science and Technology, 1998), p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; (later derided as [[planned obsolescence]], and usually credited to General Motors), which proved very successful.&lt;ref&gt;Babaian, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early bicycles were an example of [[conspicuous consumption]], being adopted by the fashionable elites.{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=8}}{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=12}}{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=14}}{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=23}}{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|pp=147–48}}{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|pp=187–88}}{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=208}}{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|pp=243–45}} In addition, by serving as a platform for accessories, which could ultimately cost more than the bicycle itself, it paved the way for the likes of the [[Barbie doll]].{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=23}}{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=121}}{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=123}}

Bicycles helped create, or enhance, new kinds of businesses, such as bicycle messengers,{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=212}} traveling seamstresses,{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=214}} riding academies,{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=131}} and racing rinks.{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=30}}{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=131}} Their board tracks were later adapted to early [[motorcycle racing|motorcycle]] and [[automobile racing]]. There were a variety of new inventions, such as [[spoke]] tighteners,{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=125}} and specialized lights,{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=123}}{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=125}} socks and shoes,{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|pp=125–26}} and even cameras, such as the [[Eastman Kodak|Eastman Company]]'s Poco.{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=238}} Probably the best known and most widely used of these inventions, adopted well beyond cycling, is Charles Bennett's Bike Web, which came to be called the [[jock strap]].{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=128}}

[[File:Person mit fahrrad feb07.jpg|thumb|upright|A man uses a bicycle to carry goods in [[Ouagadougou]], [[Burkina Faso]]]]
They also presaged a move away from public transit{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|pp=214–15}} that would explode with the introduction of the automobile.

J. K. Starley's company became the Rover Cycle Company Ltd. in the late 1890s, and then simply the [[Rover Company]] when it started making cars. [[Morris Motors|Morris Motors Limited]] (in [[Oxford]]) and [[Škoda Auto|Škoda]] also began in the bicycle business, as did the [[Wright brothers]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alistair Craig, whose company eventually emerged to become the engine manufacturers [[Ailsa Craig Engines|Ailsa Craig]], also started from manufacturing bicycles, in Glasgow in March 1885.

In general, U.S. and European cycle manufacturers used to assemble cycles from their own frames and components made by other companies, although very large companies (such as Raleigh) used to make almost every part of a bicycle (including bottom brackets, axles, etc.) In recent years, those bicycle makers have greatly changed their methods of production. Now, almost none of them produce their own frames.

Many newer or smaller companies only design and market their products; the actual production is done by Asian companies. For example, some 60% of the world's bicycles are now being made in China. Despite this shift in production, as nations such as China and India become more wealthy, their own use of bicycles has declined due to the increasing affordability of cars and motorcycles.&lt;ref&gt;

===Environmental impact===
One of the profound economic implications of bicycle use is that it liberates the user from oil consumption.(Ballantine, 1972) The bicycle is an inexpensive, fast, healthy and environmentally friendly mode of transport. [[Ivan Illich]] stated that bicycle use extended the usable physical environment for people, while alternatives such as cars and motorways degraded and confined people's environment and mobility.&lt;ref&gt;Illich, I. (1974). ''Energy and equity''. New York, Harper &amp; Row.&lt;/ref&gt;
Currently, two billion bicycles are in use around the world. Children, students, professionals, laborers, civil servants and seniors are pedaling around their communities. They all experience the freedom and the natural opportunity for exercise that the bicycle easily provides. Bicycle also has lowest carbon intensity of travel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.worldbank.org/publicsphere/global-cyclists-say-no-carbon-opt-cdm "Global cyclists say NO to carbon – opt for CDM"], The World Bank, 27 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal requirements===
{{Main|Bicycle law}}
Early in its development, as with [[automobile]]s, there were restrictions on the operation of bicycles. Along with advertising, and to gain free publicity, [[Albert A. Pope]] litigated on behalf of cyclists.{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=108}}

The 1968 [[Vienna Convention on Road Traffic]] of the [[United Nations]] considers a bicycle to be a vehicle, and a person controlling a bicycle (whether actually riding or not) is considered an operator. The traffic codes of many countries reflect these definitions and demand that a bicycle satisfy certain legal requirements before it can be used on public roads. In many [[jurisdiction]]s, it is an offense to use a bicycle that is not in a roadworthy condition.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

In most jurisdictions, bicycles must have functioning front and rear lights when ridden after dark. As some generator or [[dynamo]]-driven lamps only operate while moving, rear [[retroreflector|reflectors]] are frequently also mandatory. Since a moving bicycle makes little noise, some countries insist that bicycles have a warning bell for use when approaching pedestrians, equestrians, and other cyclists, though sometimes a [[car horn]] can be used when a 12 volt battery is available.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Some countries require child and/or adult cyclists to wear helmets, as this may protect riders from head trauma. Countries which require adult cyclists to wear helmets include Spain, [[Bicycle helmets in New Zealand|New Zealand]] and Australia. Mandatory helmet wearing is one of the most controversial topics in the cycling world, with proponents arguing that it reduces head injuries and thus is an acceptable requirement, while opponents argue that by making cycling seem more dangerous and cumbersome, it reduces cyclist numbers on the streets, creating an overall negative health effect (fewer people cycling for their own health, and the remaining cyclists being more exposed through a reversed [[safety in numbers]] effect).{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

[[Conflict resolution]] is any reduction in the severity of a conflict. It may involve [[conflict management]], in which the parties continue the conflict but adopt less extreme tactics; settlement, in which they reach agreement on enough issues that the conflict stops; or removal of the underlying causes of the conflict. The latter is sometimes called "resolution", in a narrower sense of the term that will not be used in this article. Settlements sometimes end a conflict for good, but when there are deeper issues – such as value clashes among people who must work together, [[distressed relationships]], or mistreated members of one's ethnic group across a border – settlements are often temporary.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007|reason=Revision needed/Inaccurate definitions}}

==Unproductive conflict communication cycle==
Unproductive conflict; this can be done by analyzing the three stages executed during this type of communication: the early stage, the middle stage, and the later stage. Generally speaking, an argument's potential is determined within the first 3 minutes of exchange, setting the tone for the early stage. It is in this stage where cross-complaining becomes present – countering one's complaint with another complaint – a negative environment is immediately set and hostility is likely to be mirrored. Exiting the early stage and entering the middle stage, we can see the kitchen-sinking concept come into, "Once a negative climate has been set, it is stoked by other unconstructive communication. People often engage in kitchen-sinking, in which everything except the kitchen sink is thrown into the argument" (Wood 234).  Constant interruptions, underdeveloped thoughts and the continuation of cross-complaining is apparent, leaving no time, breath or desire to form resolutions. Eventually, the conflict floats into the later stage. By this stage participants are exhausted from arguing and individual prosperity is emphasized over mutual solution; counterproposals are exchanged. As you can see, unproductive conflict communication truly is ineffective and puts relationships in jeopardy.

==Constructive conflict communication==
Similar to the unproductive conflict communication cycle, the constructive conflict communication cycle can be divided into the same 3 parts – early stage, middle stage and later stage. To establish a positive early stage, it is crucial to acknowledge and confirm one another's concerns. Critical listening, open-mindedness and respect create a supportive climate. Once the solid groundwork is set, participants can shift into the middle stage and begin agenda building, that is, clarifying the concerns while staying on topic; interruptions are kept at a minimum and recognition is reinforced. Last but not least, solutions will be proposed as the conflict enters the later stage, where respect shall be maintained, ideas are exchanged, and resolutions are formed. Contrary to a negative climate, this form of communication seeks to create a positive, more tolerable environment.

==Negotiation research==

[[Negotiation]], the most heavily researched approach to conflict resolution, has mainly been studied in laboratory experiments, in which undergraduate participants are randomly assigned to conditions. These studies have mostly looked at antecedents of the strategies adopted by negotiators and the outcomes attained, including whether agreement is reached, the joint benefit to both parties, and the individual benefit to each party.

===Negotiation research findings===

Here are some of the more prominent findings from these studies (see Pruitt &amp; Carnevale, 1993):

* [[Problem solving behavior]], such as giving or requesting information about a party's priorities among the issues, encourages high joint benefit. 
* [[Contentious behavior]], such as making threats or standing firm on one's proposals, encourages failure to reach agreement or,  if agreement is reached, low joint benefit. 
* Conceding makes agreement more likely but favors the other party's interests. 
* [[Prosocial motivation]] (resulting, for example, from positive mood or the expectation of future interaction with the other party) encourages problem solving and high joint benefit and discourages contentious behavior, but only when resistance to yielding is high (De Dreu, Weingart, &amp; Kwon, 2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Influence of social motives on integrative negotiation: a meta-analytic review and test of two theories|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date = 2000-05-01|issn = 0022-3514|pmid = 10821196|pages = 889–905|volume = 78|issue = 5|first = C. K.|last = De Dreu|first2 = L. R.|last2 = Weingart|first3 = S.|last3 = Kwon|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.78.5.889}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The party who makes the first offer tends to achieve greater benefit than the other party. 
* Three states of mind discourage concession making: viewing concessions as producing loss rather than as foregoing gain; focusing attention on one's goal rather than one's limit (i.e., the alternative that is minimally tolerable); and adopting a fixed-pie perspective, in which one views the other's gain as one's loss, rather than an expandable pie perspective. 
* Adopting any of the states of mind above diminishes the likelihood of agreement; but if agreement is reached, it increases the likelihood of winning, especially if the other party adopts the opposite state of mind (Thompson, Neale, &amp; Sinaceur, 2004).

===Cultural differences shown in research findings===

Recent experiments have found cultural differences in negotiation behavior (Gelfand &amp; Brett, 2004):

* Negotiators from [[individualistic]] cultures tend to take a more contentious approach, while those from [[collectivistic]] cultures are more concerned about maintaining positive relationships and hence more likely to cooperate (concede or engage in problem solving). 
* Accountability to constituents encourages contentious behavior for individualists, it encourages [[cooperative behavior]] for collectivists. 
* Research tells us that people with a high [[need for closure]] (for rapid decision making) tend to think and act in accustomed ways. It follows that high need for closure should accentuate contentious behavior in [[individualistic]] societies and cooperative behavior in [[collectivistic]] societies, an hypothesis that has received support.

==Research into third party involvement==

Third parties often become involved in conflict resolution, either being called in by the disputants or acting on their own because the conflict annoys them or the community they serve. Two common forms of [[third-party intervention]] are [[arbitration]] and [[mediation]]. In arbitration, the third party listens to both sides and then renders a decision, which can be either binding or advisory. Most mediation consists of third-party assistance with negotiation. When conflict is severe and the disputants have difficulty talking calmly with each other, mediators can put them into contact and help them develop a [[cease-fire]] or settlement. If the disputants cannot or will not meet each other, mediators commonly become intermediaries and shuttle between them. Sometimes a chain of two intermediaries is necessary because there is no single individual who can communicate effectively with both sides.

===Mediation research findings===

Mediation has been studied in both the laboratory and the field. Research (see Kressel &amp; Pruitt, 1989) suggests that:

* [[Interpersonal mediation]] is usually successful in producing settlements. 
* Disputants generally prefer mediation over arbitration, since it allows them to retain control over the final decision. This means that in [[med-arb]], where failure to reach agreement in mediation is followed by [[binding arbitration]], disputants will work harder to reach agreement than in straight mediation. 
* In the case of small claims disputes, that mediation produces more compliance with the agreement than [[adjudication]] (a form of arbitration), perhaps because mediated decisions accord more with the parties' needs.
* To be fully successful, mediators must be seen as impartial between the two parties. 
* Having stronger initial ties to one side than the other is less damaging to the perception of impartiality than exhibiting bias during the mediation session. 
* Disputants even sometimes prefer that the mediator be close to the other party so that he or she can exert influence over that party.

===Mediator tactics discoveries===

More than 100 distinct [[mediator tactics]] have been identified.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Among the tactics that have been shown to work well, in the sense of producing long-lasting agreements beneficial to both sides are:

* Helping the parties to understand each other's positions, challenging them to come up with new ideas, and requesting their reactions to new ideas. 
* When conflict is severe, mediators often have to be quite active and even pushy (e.g., telling disputants that their demands are unrealistic) in order to achieve agreement. 
* When conflict is less intense, and the disputants are capable of talking productively with each other, it is best for mediators to be relatively inactive.
* When disputant discussions are unproductive it is best to separate the parties ("caucusing") and engage in problem solving with each of them. 
* Compliance to the terms of an agreement is enhanced when the parties emerge from the mediation with a positive relationship and when they view the mediation process as a fair one in which all of the issues came out. 
* Continued third-party attention to the conflict has been found to encourage compliance to agreements reached at the end of internal war (Hampson, 1996).
* When there is a continuing relationship between disputants, helping them find a settlement for their current disagreement is often not enough. New conflicts may arise or deeper issues resurface. 
* Within the specific continuing relationship of marriage, [[marital therapists]] have found that training both the parties in problem solving skills, such as effective communication, identifying key issues, developing solutions that satisfy both parties' needs, helps ease marital problems. Two evaluation studies have shown the value of this approach, and one of them (Johnson &amp; Greenberg, 1985) has demonstrated that [[emotionally focused therapy]] is even more effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Differential effects of experiential and problem-solving interventions in resolving marital conflict.|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-006X.53.2.175|journal = Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|pages = 175–184|volume = 53|issue = 2|doi = 10.1037/0022-006x.53.2.175|first = Susan M.|last = Johnson|first2 = Leslie S.|last2 = Greenberg|pmid=3998245|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Emotionally focused therapy is the practice where, persistent maladaptive interaction patterns are identified, and husband and wife are encouraged to reveal the feelings and needs associated with these patterns and to "accept and respond to" their partner's feelings and needs. 
* Programs have also been developed for training school children in problem solving skills, and evaluations of these programs have generally been quite positive. 
* In addition, many school systems have adopted [[peer mediation]] programs, in which students are trained to mediate conflicts that arise in their school. Evaluations of these programs have also been quite positive (Coleman &amp; Deutsch, 2001).

==Ethno-political conflict research==

Investigators have looked at the impact of several kinds of third-party interventions in [[international and ethno-political conflict]], including [[peacekeeping]], mediation, and problem solving workshops. Peacekeeping is the use of lightly armed troops to manage conflict in a war zone. Most peacekeeping has been done by the [[United Nations]], drawing on the military forces of its members. Traditional peacekeeping involved enforcing ceasefires, but in the last few years, the peacekeeper's duties have grown to include such services as the delivery of humanitarian aid, the supervision of elections, and maintenance of law and order. Research shows that as they go about these new responsibilities, peacekeepers – officers more so than enlisted men – often become heavily involved in negotiation and mediation. One study found that as conflict becomes more severe, peacekeeper mediators are more likely to meet separately with the disputants, to urge the disputants to relax, and to rely on force (Wall, Druckman, &amp; Diehl, 2002).

===Peacekeeping research findings===

Peacekeeper mediation is done at the local level. Mediation at the intergovernmental level is a much older practice that has recently come under study with statistical analyses of large samples of historical mediations (Bercovitch &amp; Houston, 2000). Among the findings in this research are:

* Mediation is more likely to be successful when the parties are of equal power, when they have been friendly in the past, when there have been relatively few fatalities in the period before mediation, when the mediator is of high rank, and when mediation comes after a test of strength between the parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Why Do They Do It Like This? An Analysis of the Factors Influencing Mediation Behavior in International Conflicts|url = http://jcr.sagepub.com/content/44/2/170|journal = Journal of Conflict Resolution|date = 2000-04-01|issn = 0022-0027|pages = 170–202|volume = 44|issue = 2|doi = 10.1177/0022002700044002002|language = en|first = Jacob|last = Bercovitch|first2 = Allison|last2 = Houston}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The latter finding is compatible with [[ripeness theory]] ([[I. William Zartman|Zartman]], 2000), which was developed from comparative case studies of violent ethno-political conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Ripeness: The hurting stalemate and beyond|last = Zartman|first = W.I.|publisher = National Academy Press|year = 2000|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory holds that two conditions are necessary for disputants to enter into and move forward in negotiation, bilateral or mediated: (a) both sides perceive that they are in a hurting stalemate, and (b) both sides develop optimism about the outcome of mediation—a "perceived way out."

==Putting conflict research to use==

Several types of [[negotiation#Negotiation strategies|negotiation strategies]] have been developed for repairing faulty international and inter-group relations. Negotiations are usually held over a period of several days, and attended by mid-level opinion leaders and decision makers from both sides of a conflict, under the leadership of scholar and/or practitioners.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} The aims of these workshops are to teach the parties about conflict in general and their conflict in particular, to forge understanding between the parties and, if possible, to develop joint projects that will contribute to reconciliation.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} One evaluation study conducted showed that these workshops improved attitudes toward the other side, increase complexity of thinking about the conflict, and facilitate further communication with people on the other side (Fisher, 1997). There is also evidence that some alumni of these workshops have later contributed to high level negotiations between the conflicting parties.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11024">The traditional [[culture of the Southern United States]] has been called a "culture of [[honor]]", that is, a culture where people avoid intentionally offending others, and maintain a [[reputation]] for not accepting improper conduct by others. A prevalent theory as to why the American South had or may have this culture is an assumed regional belief in [[Retributive justice|retribution]] to enforce one's rights and deter predation against one’s family, home and possessions. The concept was tested by social scientists [[Richard Nisbett]] and Dov Cohen in their book ''Culture of Honor''&lt;ref name="Nisbett, R.E. 1996"&gt;Nisbett, R.E., &amp; Cohen, D. (1996). ''Culture of honor: The psychology of violence in the South''. Boulder, CO: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and repopularized by a discussion in Chapter Six of ''[[Outliers (book)|Outliers]]'' by [[Malcolm Gladwell]].

==Background==

The "culture of honor" in the Southern United States is hypothesized by some social scientists&lt;ref name="Nisbett, R.E. 1996"/&gt; to have its roots in the livelihoods of the early settlers who first inhabited the region.  Unlike settlers with an agricultural heritage (mainly from the densely populated [[South East England]] and [[East Anglia]]) who settled in [[New England]], the [[Southern United States]] was settled by herders from [[Scotland]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Northern England]] and the [[West Country]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}  Herds, unlike crops, are vulnerable to theft because they are mobile and there is little government wherewithal to enforce property rights of herd animals. The theory is that developing a reputation for violent retribution against those who stole herd animals was one way to discourage [[Cattle raiding|theft]].

This thesis is limited, however, by modern evidence that a culture of honor in the American South is strongest not in the hill country, where this thesis suggests it has its cultural origins, but in Southern lowlands.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-human-beast/200904/is-southern-violence-due-culture-honor Nigel Barber, "Is Southern violence due to a culture of honor?", ''[[Psychology Today]]'' (April 2, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; These observers argue that [[poverty]] or [[religion]], which has been distinctive in the American South since the [[Second Great Awakening]] in the 19th century, may be a more important source of this cultural phenomenon.

Other theories  point out that the culture of honor may have its roots in the settlement of the region by members of British aristocratic families.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=PqWR2y-FKfYC&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of women==

The Southern culture of honor also includes a notion that [[Lady|ladies]] should not be insulted by [[gentlemen]]. Southern gentlemen are also expected to be [[Chivalry|chivalrous]] towards women, in words and deeds.

Although "culture of honor" qualities have been generally associated with men in the southern United States, women in this region have also been affected and even shown some of the same qualities. In ''Culture of Honor'', it is stated that women play a part in the culture, both "through their role in the socialization process, as well as active participation." By passing these ideas along to their children, they are taking part in [[social conditioning]].&lt;ref name="Culture of Honor p. 119"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard E. Nisbett and Dov Cohen|title=Culture of Honor: The Psychology of Violence in the South|year=1996|publisher=Colorado: Westview Press, Inc.|pages=119|url=http://personal.tcu.edu/swoodworth/cultureofhonor.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==

==Sociology==
The historian [[David Hackett Fischer]], a Professor of History at [[Brandeis University]], makes a  case for an enduring genetic basis for a "willingness to resort to violence" (citing especially the finding of high blood levels of [[testosterone]] as discussed [[#Psychology|above]]) in the four main chapters of his book ''[[Albion's Seed]]''.&lt;ref&gt; particularly the chapter titled "Borderlands to the Backcountry: The Flight from Middle Britain and Northern Ireland, 1717-1775"&lt;/ref&gt; He proposes that a Southern propensity for violence is inheritable by genetic changes wrought over generations living in traditional herding societies in [[Northern England]], the [[Scottish Borders]], and Irish [[Border Region]]. He proposes that this propensity has been transferred to other ethnic groups by shared culture, whence it can be traced to different urban populations of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Hackett Fischer]], ''[[Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America]]'', ({{ISBN|0-19-506905-6}}), [[Oxford University Press]], 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; However, honor cultures were and are widely prevalent in Africa&lt;ref&gt;Iliffe, John. ''Honour in African History''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005. xxiv + 404 pp. {{ISBN|978-0-521-54685-0}} (paper), {{ISBN|978-0-521-83785-9}} (cloth).&lt;/ref&gt; and many other places.

Randolph Roth, in his ''American Homicide'' (2009), states that the idea of a culture of honor is oversimplified.&lt;ref name="Roth2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Roth|first=Randolph|title=American Homicide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DNTu6vYe9wgC|accessdate=17 November 2016|date=30 October 2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-05454-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that the violence often committed by Southerners resulted from social tensions. He hypothesizes that when people feel that they are denied social success or the means to attain it, they will be more prone to commit violent acts. His argument is that Southerners were in tension, possibly due to poor Whites being marginalized by rich Whites, free and enslaved Blacks being denied basic rights, and rich and politically empowered Whites having their power threatened by Northern politicians pushing for more federal control of the South, especially over [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition]]. He argues that issues over honor just triggered the already present hostility, and that people took their frustration out through violent acts often on the surface over issues of honor. He draws historical records of violence across the U.S. and [[Europe]] to show that violence largely accompanies perceptions of political weakness and the inability to advance oneself in society. Roth also shows that although the South was "obsessed with honor" in the mid-18th century, there was relatively little homicide. &lt;!--{{Clarify|including or excluding duels and other killings widely seen as justified?|date=October 2010}}--&gt; Barring under-reported crime against some groups, low homicide may simply have been [[Gentleman#Robert E. Lee|gentlemanly self-restraint]] at a time when social order was stable, a trend that reverses in the 19th century and later.{{efn|name=fn1}}

== War ==
A 2016 study suggests that honor culture increases the risk of war. The study found that international conflicts under Southern presidents are "twice as likely to involve uses of force, last on average twice as long, and are three times more likely to end in victory for the United States than disputes under non-Southern presidents. Other characteristics of Southern presidencies do not seem able to account for this pattern of results."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dafoe|first=Allan|last2=Caughey|first2=Devin|date=2016-04-01|title=Honor and War|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0043887115000416|journal=World Politics|volume=68|issue=02|pages=341–381|doi=10.1017/S0043887115000416|issn=1086-3338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==
{{notelist|refs=
{{efn|name=fn1|In ''American Homicide'', Randolph Roth charts changes in the character and incidence of homicide in the U.S. from colonial times to the present. Roth argues that the United States is distinctive in its level of violence among unrelated adults—friends, acquaintances, and strangers. America was extraordinarily homicidal in the mid-seventeenth century, but it became relatively non-homicidal by the mid-eighteenth century, even in the slave South; and by the early nineteenth century, rates in the North and the mountain South were extremely low. But the homicide rate rose substantially among unrelated adults in the slave South after the American Revolution; and it skyrocketed across the United States from the late 1840s through the mid-1870s, while rates in most other Western nations held steady or fell. That surge—and all subsequent increases in the homicide rate—correlated closely with four distinct phenomena: political instability; a loss of government legitimacy; a loss of fellow-feeling among members of society caused by racial, religious, or political antagonism; and a loss of faith in the social hierarchy. Those four factors, Roth argues, best explain why homicide rates have gone up and down in the United States and in other Western nations over the past four centuries, and why the United States is today the most homicidal affluent nation.&lt;ref name="Roth2009" /&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14793">A '''discrete-event simulation''' ('''DES''') models the operation of a [[system]] as a [[discrete time|discrete]] [[sequence of events]] in time. Each event occurs at a particular instant in time and marks a change of [[State (computer science)|state]] in the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=''Simulation – The practice of model development and use''|author=Stewart Robinson|publisher=Wiley|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between consecutive events, no change in the system is assumed to occur; thus the [[simulation]] can directly jump in time from one event to the next.

This contrasts with [[continuous simulation]] in which the simulation continuously tracks the system dynamics over time. Instead of being [[Event-driven programming|event-based]], this is called an activity-based simulation; time is broken up into small time slices and the system state is updated according to the set of activities happening in the time slice.&lt;ref name="matloff"&gt;{{cite web|last=Matloff|first=Norm|title=Introduction to Discrete-Event Simulation and the SimPy Language|url=http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/~matloff/156/PLN/DESimIntro.pdf|accessdate=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because discrete-event simulations do not have to simulate every time slice, they can typically run much faster than the corresponding continuous simulation.

A more recent method is the three-phased approach to discrete event simulation (Pidd, 1998). In this approach, the first phase is to jump to the next chronological event. The second phase is to execute all events that unconditionally occur at that time (these are called B-events). The third phase is to execute all events that conditionally occur at that time (these are called C-events). The three phase approach is a refinement of the event-based approach in which simultaneous events are ordered so as to make the most efficient use of computer resources.  The three-phase approach is used by a number of commercial simulation software packages, but from the user's point of view, the specifics of the underlying simulation method are generally hidden.

== Example ==
A common exercise in learning how to build discrete-event simulations is to model a [[Queueing theory|queue]], such as customers arriving at a bank to be served by a teller.  In this example, the system entities are '''Customer-queue''' and '''Tellers'''.  The system events are '''Customer-Arrival''' and '''Customer-Departure'''.  (The event of '''Teller-Begins-Service''' can be part of the logic of the arrival and departure events.) The system states, which are changed by these events, are '''Number-of-Customers-in-the-Queue''' (an integer from 0 to n) and '''Teller-Status''' (busy or idle).   The [[random variable]]s that need to be characterized to model this system [[stochastic]]ally are '''Customer-Interarrival-Time''' and '''Teller-Service-Time'''. An agent-based framework for performance modeling of an optimistic parallel discrete event simulator is another example for a discrete event simulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Aditya Kurve |author2=Khashayar Kotobi |author3=George Kesidis |title=An agent-based framework for performance modeling of an optimistic parallel discrete event simulator |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2194-3206-1-12 | doi=10.1186/2194-3206-1-12 |volume=1 |journal=Complex Adaptive Systems Modeling |pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==
In addition to the logic of what happens when system events occur, discrete event simulations include the following:

===State===

A system state is a set of variables that captures the salient properties of the system to be studied. The state trajectory over time S(t) can be mathematically represented by a [[step function]] whose value can change whenever an event occurs.

===Clock===

The simulation must keep track of the current simulation time, in whatever measurement units are suitable for the system being modeled. In discrete-event simulations, as opposed to continuous simulations, time 'hops' because events are instantaneous – the clock skips to the next event start time as the simulation proceeds.

===Events list===

The simulation maintains at least one list of simulation events.  This is sometimes called the ''pending event set''
because it lists events that are pending as a result of previously simulated event but have yet to be simulated themselves.
An event is described by the time at which it occurs and a type, indicating the
code that will be used to simulate that event.  It is common for the event code to be parametrized, in which case, the event description also contains parameters to the event code.

When events are instantaneous, activities that extend over time are modeled as sequences of events.  Some simulation frameworks allow the time of an event to be specified as an interval, giving the start time and the end time of each event.

[[Single-threaded]] simulation engines based on instantaneous events have just one current event.  In contrast, [[Thread (computing)|multi-threaded]] simulation engines and simulation engines supporting an interval-based event model may have multiple current events.  In both cases, there are significant problems with synchronization between current events.

The pending event set is typically organized as a [[priority queue]], [[Sorting|sorted]] by event time.&lt;ref&gt;[[Douglas W. Jones]], ed.  [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=318242.318467 Implementations of Time], Proceedings of the 18th Winter Simulation Conference, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;  That is, regardless of the order in which events are added to the event set, they are removed in strictly chronological order.  Various priority queue implementations have been studied in the context of discrete event simulation&lt;ref&gt;[[Douglas W. Jones]], [http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/5684.5686 Empirical Comparison of Priority Queue and Event Set Implementations], ''Communications of the ACM, 29,'' April 1986, pages 300–311.&lt;/ref&gt;; alternatives studied have included [[splay tree]]s, [[skip list]]s, [[calendar queue]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Kah Leong Tan and Li-Jin Thng, [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=510378.510453 SNOOPy Calendar Queue], Proceedings of the 32nd Winter Simulation Conference, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; and ladder queues.
&lt;ref&gt;Tom Dickman, Sounak Gupta and Philip A. Wilsey, [https://doi.org/10.1145/2486092.2486106 Event pool structures for PDES on many-core Beowulf clusters], Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGSIM conference on Principles of advanced discrete simulation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Angelo Furfaro and Ludovica Sacco, [https://doi.org/10.1145/3200921.3200925 Adaptive Ladder Queue: Achieving O(1) Amortized Access Time in Practice], Proceedings of the 2018 ACM SIGSIM conference on Principles of advanced discrete simulation&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, events are scheduled dynamically as the simulation proceeds. For example, in the bank example noted above, the event CUSTOMER-ARRIVAL at time t would, if the CUSTOMER_QUEUE was empty and TELLER was idle, include the creation of the subsequent event CUSTOMER-DEPARTURE to occur at time t+s, where s is a number generated from the SERVICE-TIME distribution.

===Random-number generators===

The simulation needs to generate [[random variables]] of various kinds, depending on the system model. This is accomplished by one or more [[Pseudorandom number generator]]s. The use of pseudo-random numbers as opposed to true random numbers is a benefit should a simulation need a rerun with exactly the same behavior.

One of the problems with the random number distributions used in discrete-event simulation is that the steady-state distributions of event times may not be known in advance.  As a result, the initial set of events placed into the pending event set will not have arrival times representative of the steady-state distribution.  This problem is typically solved by bootstrapping the simulation model.  Only a limited effort is made to assign realistic times to the initial set of pending events.  These events, however, schedule additional events, and with time, the distribution of event times approaches its steady state.  This is called ''bootstrapping'' the simulation model.  In gathering statistics from the running model, it is important to either disregard events that occur before the steady state is reached or to run the simulation for long enough that the bootstrapping behavior is overwhelmed by steady-state behavior.  (This use of the term ''bootstrapping'' can be contrasted with its use in both [[Bootstrapping (statistics)|statistics]] and [[Bootstrapping (computing)|computing]]).

===Statistics===

The simulation typically keeps track of the system's [[statistic]]s, which quantify the aspects of interest. In the bank example, it is of interest to track the mean waiting times. In a simulation model, performance metrics are not analytically derived from [[probability distributions]], but rather as averages over [[replication (statistics)|replication]]s, that is different runs of the model. [[Confidence interval]]s are usually constructed to help assess the quality of the output.

===Ending condition===

Because events are bootstrapped, theoretically a discrete-event simulation could run forever. So the simulation designer must decide when the simulation will end.  Typical choices are "at time t" or "after processing n number of events" or, more generally, "when statistical measure X reaches the value x".

==Simulation engine logic==

The main loop of a discrete-event simulation is something like this:

===Start===
* Initialize Ending Condition to FALSE.
* Initialize system state variables.
* Initialize Clock (usually starts at simulation time zero).
* Schedule an initial event (i.e., put some initial event into the Events List).

=== “Do loop” or “while loop”===
While (Ending Condition is FALSE) then do the following:
* Set clock to next event time.
* Do next event and remove from the Events List.
* Update statistics.

===End===
* Generate statistical report.

== Common uses ==

===Diagnosing process issues===
Simulation approaches are particularly well equipped to help users diagnose issues in complex environments.  [[The Goal]] ([[Theory of Constraints]]) illustrates the importance of understanding bottlenecks in a system.  Only process ‘improvements’ at the bottlenecks will actually improve the overall system.  In many organizations bottlenecks become hidden by excess inventory, [[overproduction]], variability in processes and variability in routing or sequencing.  By accurately documenting the system inside a simulation model it is possible to gain a bird’s eye view of the entire system.

A working model of a system allows management to understand performance drivers.  A simulation can be built to include any number of [[performance indicator]]s such as worker utilization, on-time delivery rate, scrap rate, cash cycles, and so on.

===Hospital applications===
An operating theater is generally shared between several surgical disciplines.  Through better understanding the nature of these procedures it may be possible to increase the patient throughput.
Example:  If a heart surgery takes on average four hours, changing an operating room schedule from eight available hours to nine will not increase patient throughput.  On the other hand, if a hernia procedure takes on average twenty minutes providing an extra hour may also not yield any increased throughput if the capacity and average time spent in the recovery room is not considered.

===Lab test performance improvement ideas===
Many systems improvement ideas are built on sound principles, proven methodologies ([[Lean manufacturing|Lean]], [[Six Sigma]], [[Total quality management|TQM]], etc.) yet fail to improve the overall system.  A simulation model allows the user to understand and test a performance improvement idea in the context of the overall system.

===Evaluating capital investment decisions===
:''See also: [[Monte Carlo methods in finance]]; [[Corporate finance#Capital investment decisions|Corporate finance #Capital investment decisions]] and [[Corporate finance#Quantifying uncertainty|#Quantifying uncertainty]].''

Simulation modeling is commonly used to model potential investments.  Through modeling investments decision-makers can make informed decisions and evaluate potential alternatives.

===Network simulators===

Discrete event simulation is used in computer network to simulate new protocols for different network traffic scenarios before deployment.

'''Donaldson Wells King''' (1942–2014) was a writer and gay rights activist in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]].

King was born in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]]. He married in 1967 but later divorced his wife and gradually began "coming out." King would eventually become one of Charlotte's most outspoken activists for the civil rights of the [[LGBT]] community.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://goqnotes.com/32393/don-king-early-charlotte-lgbt-community-pioneer-dies-at-72/|title=Don King, early Charlotte LGBT community pioneer, dies at 72|date=2014-11-07|newspaper=QNotes|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King was a writer who enjoyed a career in journalism. He first worked in Durham in the 1960s, and in the 1970s he was hired by the ''[[The Charlotte Observer|Charlotte Observer]]''. His writing was marked by the positive way he portrayed the LGBT community. King's goal was to create an LGBT community that could stand by itself and push for equality within the  Charlotte area.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article9226121.html|title=Early Charlotte gay rights ‘warrior’ Don King dies of cancer|newspaper=charlotteobserver|access-date=2016-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981 he co-founded the Queen City Quordinators (QCQ), a joint fundraising umbrella group for LGBT groups in Charlotte. QCQ published a newsletter named "Q Notes" beginning in 1983. King was hired as the first editor of the newsletter, publishing it monthly through 1987.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; His ability to stand up for civil rights in a respectful and gentle manner helped him become well known and respected in Charlotte.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Police harassment and entrapment of gay men was an issue that King was passionate about. In the late 1980s he led efforts to change the way police officers treated gay men and to stop undercover officers from entrapping gay men.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

King helped start the [[Pride parade|Gay Pride Parade]] in Charlotte and later in the 1980s ran a gay and lesbian bookstore out of his apartment. He was also a devoted member of the Charlotte Bridge Club.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

King died October 30, 2014, from [[pancreatic cancer]] at the age of 72.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4734">'''[[Ecological]] [[goods and services]]''' ('''EG&amp;S''') are the benefits arising from the ecological functions of [[ecosystems]]. Such benefits accrue to all [[Organism|living organisms]], including animals and plants, rather than to humans alone. However, there is a growing recognition of the importance to society that ecological goods and services provide for health, social, cultural, and economic needs. 

==Introduction==
Examples of ecological goods include [[Air pollution|clean air]], and abundant [[fresh water]]. Examples of ecological services include purification of air and water, maintenance of biodiversity, decomposition of wastes, soil and vegetation generation and renewal, pollination of crops and natural vegetation, groundwater recharge through wetlands, [[Biological dispersal|seed dispersal]], [[greenhouse gas]] mitigation, and aesthetically pleasing landscapes. The products and processes of ecological goods and services are complex and occur over long periods of time. They are a sub-category of [[public goods]].

The concern over ecological goods and services arises because we are losing them at an unsustainable rate, and therefore [[land use]] managers must devise a host of tools to encourage the provision of more ecological goods and services. Rural and suburban settings are especially important, as lands that are developed and converted from their natural state lose their ecological functions. Therefore, ecological goods and services provided by privately held lands become increasingly important.

==Markets==
A market may be created wherein ecological goods and services are demanded by society and supplied by public and private landowners.  Some believe that [[public land]]s alone are not adequate to supply this market, and that privately held lands are needed to close this gap. What has emerged is the notion that rural landowners who provide ecological goods and services to society through good stewardship practices on their land should be duly compensated. The main tool to accomplish this to date has been to pay farmers directly to set-aside portions of their land that would otherwise be in production. This exemplifies a shift in thinking from the "polluter pays" to the "beneficiary pays". 

Financial incentives to landowners is one approach, but provision of EG&amp;S can also be achieved through regulation, stewardship incentives under existing programs such Environmental Farm Plans, [[market-based instruments]], and tax rebates.

==Biodiversity and EGS==
According to the [https://web.archive.org/web/20110423003943/http://www.maweb.org/en/index.aspx Millennium Ecosystem Assessment] project, [[biodiversity]] is a necessary underlying component of ecological goods and services.  Biodiversity supports ecological goods and services such as [[biological control]] and [[Genetics|genetic]] resources.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Costanza|Costanza, R.]], d'Arge, R., de Groot, R., Farber, S., Grasso, M., Hannon, B., Limburg, K., Naeem, S., O'Neill, R., Paruelo, J., Raskin, R.G., Sutton, P. &amp; van den Belt, M. (1997). The value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital. ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' '''387''':253-260&lt;/ref&gt;  However, biodiversity is also sometimes referred to as an actual ecological good or service which can be confusing.

In [[logic]], two formulae are '''equisatisfiable''' if the first formula is [[satisfiable]] whenever the second is and vice versa; in other words, either both formulae are satisfiable or both are not. Equisatisfiable formulae may disagree, however, for a particular choice of variables. As a result, equisatisfiability is different  from [[logical equivalence]], as two equivalent formulae always have the same models.

Equisatisfiability is generally used in the context of translating formulae, so that one can define a translation to be correct if the original and resulting formulae are equisatisfiable. Examples of translations involving this concept are [[Skolemization]] and some translations into [[conjunctive normal form]]. 

==Examples==

A translation from propositional logic into propositional logic in which every binary disjunction &lt;math&gt;a \vee b&lt;/math&gt; is replaced by &lt;math&gt;((a \vee n) \wedge (\neg n \vee b))&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is a new variable (one for each replaced disjunction) is a transformation in which satisfiability is preserved: the original and resulting formulae are equisatisfiable. Note that these two formulae are not equivalent: the first formula has the model in which &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is true while &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; are false, and this is not a model of the second formula, in which &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; has to be true in this case.

{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2016}}
{{Refimprove|date=October 2016}}

In [[physics]], '''exotic matter''' is [[matter]] that somehow deviates from normal matter and has "exotic" properties. A broader definition of exotic matter is any kind of non-baryonic matter—that is not made of [[baryons]], the subatomic particles (such as [[protons]] and [[neutrons]]) of which ordinary matter is composed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/E/exotic_matter.html|title=Exotic matter|publisher=[[daviddarling.info]]|accessdate=2015-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exotic mass has been considered a colloquial term for matters such as [[dark matter]], [[negative mass]], or [[Mass#Tachyonic particles and imaginary (complex) mass|complex mass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4517897/nobel-prize-physics-2016/|title=Why 'Exotic Matter' Matters—and Won the Nobel Prize in Physics|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4517897/nobel-prize-physics-2016/|title=Why 'Exotic Matter' Matters—and Won the Nobel Prize in Physics|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/scitech/science/356829/physicists-confirm-existence-of-new-exotic-matter/story/|title=Physicists confirm existence of new 'exotic' matter|work=GMA News Online|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.space.com/8012-exotic-antimatter-created-earth.html|title=Exotic Antimatter Created on Earth|work=Space.com|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nature.com/nature/supplements/insights/exoticmatter/index.html|title=Exotic matter  : Insight : Nature|website=www.nature.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anonymous|date=1998-08-03|title=Focus: Wormhole Construction: Proceed with Caution|url=https://physics.aps.org/story/v2/st7|journal=Physics|language=en-US|volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of exotic matter==
There are several types of exotic matter:

* Hypothetical [[subatomic particle|particles]] and states of matter that have "exotic" [[physical property|physical properties]] that would violate known [[laws of physics]], such as a particle having a [[negative mass]].
* [[Hypothetical particle]]s and states of matter that have not yet been encountered, but whose properties would be within the realm of mainstream physics if found to exist. 
* Several particles whose existence has been experimentally confirmed that are conjectured to be [[exotic hadron]]s and within the [[Standard Model]].
* [[State of matter|States of matter]] that are not commonly encountered, such as [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]s, [[fermionic condensate]]s, [[quantum spin liquid]], [[string-net liquid]], [[supercritical fluid]], [[color-glass condensate]],  [[quark–gluon plasma]], [[Rydberg matter]], [[Rydberg polaron]] and [[photonic matter]] but whose properties are entirely within the realm of mainstream physics.
* States of matter that are poorly understood, such as [[Dark matter]] and [[Mirror matter]].
* Ordinary matter placed under [[high pressure]], which may result in dramatic changes in its physical or chemical properties.
* [[Degenerate matter]]
* [[Exotic atoms]]

== Negative mass ==
{{main article|Negative mass}}

Negative mass would possess some strange properties, such as accelerating in the direction opposite of applied [[force]]. Despite being inconsistent with the expected behavior of "normal" matter, negative mass is mathematically consistent and introduces no violation of [[conservation of momentum]] or [[conservation of energy|energy]]. It is used in certain speculative theories, such as on the construction of artificial [[wormhole]]s and the [[Alcubierre drive]]. The closest known real representative of such exotic matter is the region of pseudo-[[Pressure#Negative pressures|negative-pressure]] density produced by the [[Casimir effect]].

According to [[mass–energy equivalence]], mass  &lt;math&gt;m &lt;/math&gt; is in proportion to energy  &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; and the coefficient of proportionality is &lt;math&gt;c^2 &lt;/math&gt;. Actually,  &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is still equivalent to  &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; although the coefficient is another constant &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wang, Z.Y |author2=Wang P.Y |author3=Xu Y.R | date=2011 | title=Crucial experiment to resolve Abraham-Minkowski Controversy | journal=Optik | volume=122 | pages=1994–1996 | doi=10.1016/j.ijleo.2010.12.018 | issue= 22|bibcode = 2011Optik.122.1994W |arxiv=1103.3559 }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as &lt;math&gt;-c^2 &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wang, Z.Y.|title=Modern Theory for Electromagnetic Metamaterials|journal=Plasmonics|date=2016|volume=11|pages=503–508|doi=10.1007/s11468-015-0071-7|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, it is unnecessary to introduce a [[negative energy]] because the mass can be negative although the energy is positive. That is to say,

:&lt;math&gt;E=-mc^2&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;m= -\frac{E}{c^2}&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;

Under the circumstances，

:&lt;math&gt;dE=Fds=\frac{dp}{dt}ds=\frac{ds}{dt}dp=vdp=vd(mv)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;-c^2dm=vd(mv)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;-c^2(2m)dm=2mvd(mv)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;-c^2d(m^2)=d(m^2v^2)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;-m^2c^2=m^2v^2+C&lt;/math&gt;

When &lt;math&gt;v=0&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;C=-m_0^2c^2&lt;/math&gt;

Consequently,

:&lt;math&gt;-m^2c^2=m^2v^2-m_0^2c^2&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;m={m_0\over \sqrt{1+\displaystyle{v^2\over c^2}}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;m_0&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; is [[invariant mass]] and [[invariant energy]] equals &lt;math&gt;E_0=-m_0 c^2&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.  The squared mass is still positive and the particle can be stable.

Since &lt;math&gt;m= {m_0\over \sqrt{1+\displaystyle{v^2\over c^2}}}&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;p=mv= {m_0 v\over \sqrt{1+\displaystyle{v^2\over c^2}}}&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;

The [[negative momentum]] is applied to explain [[negative refraction]], [[inverse Doppler effect]] and [[reverse Cherenkov effect]] observed in a [[negative index metamaterial]]. The [[radiation pressure]] in the [[metamaterial]] is also negative&lt;ref name="Veselago1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Veselago|first=V. G.|title=The electrodynamics of substances with simultaneously negative values of permittivity and permeability|journal=Soviet Physics Uspekhi|year=1968|volume=10|issue=4|pages=509–514 |doi=10.1070/PU1968v010n04ABEH003699|bibcode = 1968SvPhU..10..509V }}&lt;/ref&gt; because the force is defined as &lt;math&gt;F=\frac{dp}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;. [[Pressure#Negative pressures|Negative pressure]] exists in [[dark energy]] too. Using these above equations, the [[energy-momentum relation]] should be

:&lt;math&gt;E^2 =- p^2c^2+ m_0^2 c^4&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the [[Planck-Einstein relation]] &lt;math&gt;E=\hbar\omega&lt;/math&gt; and [[de Broglie]]'s &lt;math&gt;p=\hbar k&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain the following [[dispersion relation]] 
 
:&lt;math&gt;\omega^2 =- k^2c^2+ \omega_p^2&lt;/math&gt;,    &lt;math&gt;(E_0=\hbar\omega_p=-m_0c^2&gt;0)&lt;/math&gt;

of the wave consists of a stream of particles whose [[energy-momentum relation]] is &lt;math&gt;E^2 =- p^2c^2+ m_0^2 c^4&lt;/math&gt;([[wave–particle duality]]) can be excited in a [[negative index metamaterial]].The velocity of such a particle is equal to

:&lt;math&gt;v=c\sqrt{\frac{E_0^2}{E^2}-1}=c\sqrt{\frac{\omega_p^2}{\omega^2}-1}&lt;/math&gt;

and range is from zero to infinity

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\omega_p^2}{\omega^2}&lt;2&lt;/math&gt;,      &lt;math&gt;v&lt;c&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\omega_p^2}{\omega^2}&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;,      &lt;math&gt;v&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;

Moreover, the [[kinetic energy]] is also negative

:&lt;math&gt;E_k = E-E_0=-mc^2-(-m_0 c^2)=-{m_0c^2\over\sqrt{1+\displaystyle{v^2\over c^2}}} + m_0 c^2= m_0 c^2 (1-{1\over\sqrt{1+\displaystyle{v^2\over c^2}}})&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;(m_0&lt;0)&lt;/math&gt;

In fact, the [[negative kinetic energy]] exists in some models&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Caldwell, R.R.|title=A phantom menace? Cosmological consequences of a dark energy component with super-negative equation of state|journal=Physics Letters B|volume=545|pages=23–29|date=2002|doi=10.1016/S0370-2693(02)02589-3|issue=1–2|arxiv = astro-ph/9908168 |bibcode = 2002PhLB..545...23C }}&lt;/ref&gt; to describe [[dark energy]] ([[phantom energy]]) whose pressure is negative. In this way, the [[negative mass]] of exotic matter is now associated with [[negative momentum]], [[Pressure#Negative pressures|negative pressure]], negative kinetic energy and FTL ([[faster-than-light]]).

== Complex mass ==
{{Main article|Tachyon#Mass}}

A hypothetical particle with [[Complex number|complex]] rest mass would always travel faster than the [[speed of light]]. Such particles are called [[tachyon]]s. There is no confirmed existence of tachyons.

: &lt;math&gt;E = \frac{m\cdot c^2}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{\left|\mathbf{v}\right|^2}{c^2}}}&lt;/math&gt;

If the rest mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is complex this implies that the denominator is complex because the total energy is [[observable]] and thus must be [[real number|real]]. Therefore, the quantity under the square root must be negative, which can only happen if [[speed|''v'']] is greater than [[speed of light|''c'']]. As noted by [[Gregory Benford]] ''et al.,'' [[special relativity]] implies that tachyons, if they existed, could be used to communicate backwards in time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=G. A. Benford |author2=D. L. Book |author3=W. A. Newcomb |year=1970|title=The Tachyonic Antitelephone|journal=[[Physical Review D]]|volume=2 |page=263|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.2.263|bibcode = 1970PhRvD...2..263B }}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[tachyonic antitelephone]]). Because [[time travel]] is considered to be non-physical, tachyons are believed by physicists either not to exist, or else to be incapable of interacting with normal matter.

In quantum field theory, complex mass would induce [[tachyon condensation]].

== Materials at high pressure ==
At high pressure, materials such as [[sodium chloride]] (NaCl) in the presence of an excess of either chlorine or sodium were transformed into compounds "forbidden" by classical chemistry, such as {{chem|Na|3|Cl}} and {{chem|Na|Cl|3}}. Quantum mechanical calculations predict the possibility of other compounds, such as {{chem|Na|Cl|7}}, {{chem|Na|3|Cl|2}} and {{chem|Na|2|Cl}}. The materials are thermodynamically stable at high pressures. Such compounds may exist in natural environments that exist at high pressure, such as the deep ocean or inside planetary cores. The materials have potentially useful properties. For instance, {{chem|Na|3|Cl}} is a two-dimensional metal, made of layers of pure sodium and salt that can conduct electricity. The salt layers act as insulators while the sodium layers act as conductors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/scientists-create-forbidden-compounds-table-salt/30520/ |title=Scientists turn table salt into forbidden compounds that violate textbook rules |publisher=Gizmag.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Zhang | first1 = W. | last2 = Oganov | first2 = A.

WHO has defined [[health]] as "a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity."&lt;ref name="Constitution of the World Health Organization - Basic Documents, Forty-fifth edition"&gt;{{cite report |author=World Health Organization|title=Constitution of the World Health Organization - Basic Documents, Forty-fifth edition|year=2006|url=http://www.who.int/governance/eb/who_constitution_en.pdf|accessdate=7 Apr 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Identified by the ''2012 World Development Report'' as one of two key [[human capital]] endowments, health can influence an individual's ability to reach his or her full potential in [[society]].&lt;ref name="World Development Report 2012: Gender Equality and Development"&gt;{{cite report|author=The World Bank|date=2012 |title=World Development Report 2012: Gender Equality and Development |publisher=The World Bank |location=Washington, DC }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet while gender equality has made the most progress in areas such as education and labor force participation, health inequality between men and women continues to plague many societies today. While both males and females face [[health disparities]], girls and women experience a majority of [[health disparities]]. This comes from the fact that many cultural ideologies and practices have structured society in a way whereby women are more vulnerable to abuse and mistreatment, making them more prone to [[illnesses]] and early [[death]].&lt;ref name="Women &amp; Health: Today's Evidence, Tomorrow's Agenda"&gt;{{cite report|author=World Health Organization|date=2009 |title=Women &amp; Health: Today's Evidence, Tomorrow's Agenda |publisher=WHO Press|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2009/9789241563857_eng.pdf |accessdate=18 Mar 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women are also restricted from receiving many opportunities, such as [[education]] and paid labor, that can help improve their accessibility to better health care resources.

==Definition of health disparity==

[[Health disparity]] has been defined by the [[World Health Organization]] as the differences in health care received by different groups of people that are not only unnecessary and avoidable but unfair and unjust.&lt;ref name="The concepts and principles of equity and health"&gt;{{Cite report |last=Whitehead |first=M |date=1990 |title=The Concepts and Principles of Equity in Health. |url=http://salud.ciee.flacso.org.ar/flacso/optativas/equity_and_health.pdf |publisher=Copenhagen: WHO, Reg. Off. Eur. |page=29 |accessdate=18 Mar 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of health disparity implies that [[health equity]] does not exist in many parts of the world. Equity in health refers to the situation whereby every individual has a fair opportunity to attain their full health potential.&lt;ref name="The concepts and principles of equity and health"/&gt; Overall, the term "health disparities", or "health inequalities", is widely understood as the differences in health between people who are situated in different positions in a socioeconomic hierarchy.&lt;ref name="Health Disparities and Health Equity: Concepts and Measurement"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Braveman | first1 = P. | doi = 10.1146/annurev.publhealth.27.021405.102103 | title = Health Disparities and Health Equity: Concepts and Measurement | journal = Annual Review of Public Health | volume = 27 | pages = 167–194 | year = 2006 | pmid =  16533114| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender as an axis of difference==

===Predominantly female-bias===
The social structures of many countries perpetuate the marginalization and oppression of women in the form of [[social norms|cultural norms]] and [[Code (law)|legal codes]]. As a result of this unequal social order, women are usually relegated into positions where they have less access and control over healthcare resources, making women more vulnerable to suffering from health problems than men. For example, women living in areas with a patriarchal system are often less likely to receive tertiary education or to be employed in the paid labor market due to gender discrimination.&lt;ref name="Women &amp; Health: Today's Evidence, Tomorrow's Agenda"/&gt; As a result, female [[life expectancy]] at birth and nutritional well-being, and immunity against [[communicable diseases|communicable]] and [[non-communicable diseases]], are often lower than those of men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vlassoff|first=C|title=Gender differences in determinants and consequences of health and illness.|journal=Journal of health, population, and nutrition|date=March 2007|volume=25|issue=1|pages=47–61|pmid=17615903|pmc=3013263}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="More Than 100 Million Women Are Missing"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sen|first=Amartya|title=More Than 100 Million Women Are Missing|year=1990|journal=New York Review of Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disparities against males===
While a majority of the global health gender disparities is weighted against women, there are situations in which men tend to fare poorer. One such instance is [[armed conflicts]], where men are often the immediate victims. A study of conflicts in 13 countries from 1955 to 2002 found that 81% of all violent [[war]] deaths were male.&lt;ref name="World Development Report 2012: Gender Equality and Development" /&gt; Apart from armed conflicts, areas with high incidence of violence, such as regions controlled by [[drug cartels]], also see men experiencing higher mortality rates. This stems from social beliefs that associate ideals of [[masculinity]]  with aggressive, confrontational behavior.&lt;ref name="The Street Is My Home: Youth and Violence in Caracas"&gt;{{cite book |last=Márquez |first=Patricia |title=The Street Is My Home: Youth and Violence in Caracas |year=1999 |publisher=Stanford University Press |location=Stanford, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, sudden and drastic changes in economic environments and the loss of [[social safety net]]s, in particular social subsidies and food stamps, have also been linked to higher levels of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] consumption and [[psychological stress]] among men, leading to a spike in male mortality rates. This is because such situations often makes it harder for men to provide for their family, a task that has been long regarded as the "essence of masculinity."&lt;ref name="Autopsy on an Empire: Understanding Mortality in Russia and the Former Soviet Union"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brainerd |first=Elizabeth |last2=Cutler |first2=David |title=Autopsy on an Empire: Understanding Mortality in Russia and the Former Soviet Union |year=2005 |publisher=William Davidson Institute |location=Ann Arbor, MI}}&lt;/ref&gt; A retrospective analyses of people infected with the common cold found that doctors underrate the symptoms of men, and are more willing to attribute symptoms and illness to women than men. &lt;ref&gt; Sue, Kyle.

==Forms of gender disparities==

===Male-female sex ratio===

At [[birth]], boys outnumber girls with the ratio of 105 or 106 [[male]] to 100 [[female]] children.&lt;ref name="More Than 100 Million Women Are Missing"/&gt; However, after conception, biology favors women. Research has shown that if men and women received similar nutrition, medical attention, and general health care, women would live longer than men.&lt;ref name="Ageing Beyond 2000: One World One Future"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dennerstein|first=L|last2=Feldman|first2=S|last3=Murdaugh|first3=C|last4=Rossouw|first4=J|last5=Tennstedt|first5=S|title=1997 World Congress of Gerontology: Ageing Beyond 2000 : One World One Future|year=1977|publisher=International Association of Gerontology|location=Adelaide}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because women, on a whole, are more resistant to diseases and less prone to debilitating genetic conditions.&lt;ref name="X chromosomes key to sex differences in health"&gt;{{cite web|last=Huang|first=Audrey|title=X chromosomes key to sex differences in health|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-03/jaaj-xck031606.php|publisher=JAMA and Archives Journals|accessdate=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite medical and scientific research that shows that when given the same care as males, females tend to have better survival rates than males, the ratio of women to men in developing regions such as [[South Asia]], West Asia, and [[China]] can be as low as 0.94, or even lower. This deviation from the natural male to female sex ratio has been described by Indian philosopher and economist [[Amartya Sen]] as the [[Missing women of Asia|"missing women" phenomenon]].&lt;ref name="More Than 100 Million Women Are Missing"/&gt; According to the 2012 World Development Report, the number of missing women is estimated to be about 1.5 million women per year, with a majority of the women missing in [[India]] and [[China]].&lt;ref name="World Development Report 2012: Gender Equality and Development"/&gt;

===Female mortality===
In many developing regions, women experience high levels of [[mortality rate|mortality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Prata|first=Ndola|author2=Passano, Paige |author3=Sreenivas, Amita |author4= Gerdts, Caitlin Elisabeth |title=Maternal mortality in developing countries: challenges in scaling-up priority interventions|journal=Women's Health|date=1 March 2010|volume=6|issue=2|pages=311–327|doi=10.2217/WHE.10.8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of these deaths result from [[Maternal death|maternal mortality]] and [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] infection. Although only 1,900 maternal deaths were recorded in high-income nations in 2008, [[India]] and [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] experienced a combined total of 266,000 deaths from [[pregnancy]]-related causes. In [[Somalia]] and [[Chad]], one in every 14 women die from causes related to child birth.&lt;ref name="World Development Report 2012: Gender Equality and Development"/&gt; In addition, the [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] epidemic also contributes significantly to female mortality. The case is especially true for [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], where women account for 60% of all adult HIV infections.&lt;ref name="Women, girls, and HIV"&gt;{{cite report |author=UNAIDS|title="Women, Girls, and HIV" UNAIDS Factsheet 10|year=2010|publisher=UNAIDS|location=Geneva}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health outcome===
Women tend to have poorer health outcomes than men for several reasons ranging from sustaining greater risk to diseases to experiencing higher [[mortality rates]]. In the Population Studies Center Research Report by Rachel Snow that compares the [[disability-adjusted life years]] (DALY) of both male and females, the global DALYs lost to females for sexually transmitted diseases such as [[gonorrhea]] and [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]] are more than ten times greater than those of the males.&lt;ref name="Sex, Gender and Vulnerability"&gt;{{cite report |author=Rachel Snow|title=Population Studies Center Research Report 07-628: Sex, Gender and Vulnerability|year=2007|publisher=Population Studies Center, University of Michigan, Institute for Social Research|url=http://www.psc.isr.umich.edu/pubs/pdf/rr07-628.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the female DALYs to male DALYs ratio for malnutrition-related diseases such as [[Iron-Deficiency Anemia]] are often close to 1.5, suggesting that poor [[nutrition]] impacts women at a much higher level than men.&lt;ref name="Sex, Gender and Vulnerability"/&gt; Additionally, in terms of mental illnesses, women are also two to three times more likely than men to be diagnosed with depression.&lt;ref name="Global burden of depressive disorders in the year 2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Usten|first=T|last2=Ayuso-Mateos|first2=J|last3=Chatterji|first3=S|last4=Mathers|first4=C|last5=Murray|first5=C|title=Global burden of depressive disorders in the year 2000|year=2004|journal=Br J Psychiatry|volume=184|pages=386–92|doi=10.1192/bjp.184.5.386}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regards to suicidal rates, up to 80% of those who [[committed suicide]] or attempted suicide in [[Iran]] are women.&lt;ref name="Suicidal attempt and psychiatric disorders in Iran"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Mohammadi | first1 = M. R. | last2 = Ghanizadeh | first2 = A. | last3 = Rahgozart | first3 = M. | last4 = Noorbala | first4 = A.

In developed countries with more social and legal gender equality, overall health outcomes can disfavor men.  For example, in the United States, as of 2001, men's life expectancy is 5 years lower than women's (down from 1 year in 1920), and men die at higher rates from all top 10 causes of death, especially [[heart disease]] and [[stroke]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.webmd.com/men/features/mens-top-5-health-concerns&lt;/ref&gt;  Men die from suicide more frequently, though women more frequently have suicidal thoughts and the suicide attempt rate is the same for men and women (see [[Gender differences in suicide]]).  Men may suffer from undiagnosed depression more frequently, due to gender differences in the expression of emotion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.webmd.com/men/features/mens-top-5-health-concerns?page=3&lt;/ref&gt;  American men are more likely to consume alcohol, smoke, engage in risky behaviors, and defer medical care.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/menshealth.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Incidence of [[melanoma]] has strong gender-related differences which vary by age.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aad.org/media/stats/conditions/skin-cancer&lt;/ref&gt;

Women outlive men in 176 countries. Data from 38 countries shows women having higher life expediencies than men for all years both at birth and at age 50. Men are more likely to die from 13 of the 15 major causes of death in the U.S. However, women are more likely to suffer from disease than men and miss work due to illness throughout life. This is called the mortality-morbidity paradox &lt;ref&gt; Austad, Steven N. Fischer, Kathleen E. "Sex Differences in Lifespan." Cell Metabolism 23, June 14, 2016 https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2016.05.019. pages 1026-1028 &lt;/ref&gt; This is explained by an excess of psychological, rather than physical, distress among women, as well as higher smoking rates among men. &lt;ref&gt; Macintyre, Sally.

===Access to healthcare===
Women tend to have poorer access to health care resources than men. In certain regions of [[Africa]], many women often lack access to malaria treatment as well as access to resources that could protect them against [[Anopheles]] [[mosquitoes]] during [[pregnancy]]. As a result of this, pregnant women who are residing in areas with low levels of malaria transmission are still placed at two to three times higher risk than men in terms of contracting a severe [[malaria infection]].&lt;ref name="The Africa Malaria Report 2003"&gt;{{cite report |author=WHO/UNICEF |title=The Africa Malaria Report 2003|year=2003|publisher=WHO/UNICEF|location=Geneva}}&lt;/ref&gt; These disparities in access to healthcare are often compounded by cultural norms and expectations imposed on women. For example, certain societies forbid women from leaving their homes unaccompanied by a male relative, making it harder for women to receive healthcare services and resources when they need it most.&lt;ref name="Women &amp; Health: Today's Evidence, Tomorrow's Agenda"/&gt;

Gender factors, such as women's status and empowerment (i.e., in [[education]], [[employment]], intimate partner relationships, and [[reproductive health]]), are linked with women's capacity to access and use maternal health services, a critical component of [[maternal health]].&lt;ref&gt;Gill, R, DE Stewart. 2011. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21185987 "Relevance of gender-sensitive policies and general health indicators to compare the status of South Asian women’s health"] Women’s Health Issues 21(1): 12–18, {{DOI|10.1016/j.whi.2010.10.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, [[family planning]] is typically viewed as the responsibility of women, with programs targeting women and overlooking the role of men—even though men's dominance in decision making, including contraceptive use, has significant implications for family planning &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schuler | first1 = S. | last2 = Rottach | first2 = E. | last3 = Mukiri | first3 = P. | year = 2011 | title = Gender Norms and Family Planning Decision-Making in Tanzania: A Qualitative Study | url = http://www.publichealthinafrica.org/index.php/jphia/article/view/25 | journal = Journal of Public Health in Africa | volume = 2 | issue = | page = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and access to reproductive health services.&lt;ref&gt;Hou, X., and N. Ma. 2011. [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1747446  "Empowering Women: The Effect of Women's Decision-Making Power on Reproductive Health Services Uptake—Evidence from Pakistan."] World Bank Policy Research Working Paper No. 5543.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="healthpolicyproject.com"&gt;Rottach, E., K.

In order to promote equity in access to reproductive health care, health programs and services should conduct analyses to identify [[gender inequalities]] and barriers to health, and determine the programmatic implications. The analyses will help inform decisions about how to design, implement, and scale up health programs that meet the differential needs of women and men.&lt;ref name="healthpolicyproject.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rottach, E. 2013.

==Causes==

===Cultural norms and practices===

Cultural norms and practices are two of the main reasons why gender disparities in health exist and continue to persist. These cultural norms and practices often influence the roles and behaviors that men and women adopt in society. It is these gender differences between men and women, which are regarded and valued differently, that give rise to gender inequalities as they work to systematically empower one group and oppress the other. Both gender differences and gender inequalities can lead to disparities in health outcomes and access to health care. Some of the examples provided by the [[World Health Organization]] of how cultural norms can result in gender disparities in health include a woman's inability to [[travel]] alone, which can prevent them from receiving the necessary health care that they need.&lt;ref name="World Health Organization: Gender. Women and Health"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/gender/genderandhealth/en/index.html |title=Gender, Women, and Health|publisher=WHO |accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another societal standard is a woman's inability to insist on [[condom]] use by her [[spouse]] or sex partners, leading to a higher risk of contracting [[HIV]].&lt;ref name="World Health Organization: Gender. Women and Health" /&gt; 

====Son preference====
One of the better documented cultural norms that augment gender disparities in health is the preference for sons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Edlund|first=Lena|title=Son Preference, Sex Ratios, and Marriage Patterns|journal=Journal of Political Economy|date=1 December 1999|volume=107|issue=6, Part 1|pages=1275|doi=10.1086/250097|citeseerx=10.1.1.585.5921}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Das Gupta|first=Monica|author2=Zhenghua, Jiang |author3=Bohua, Li |author4=Zhenming, Xie |author5=Chung, Woojin |author6= Hwa-Ok, Bae |title=Why is Son preference so persistent in East and South Asia? a cross-country study of China, India and the Republic of Korea|journal=Journal of Development Studies|date=1 December 2003|volume=40|issue=2|pages=153–187|doi=10.1080/00220380412331293807}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[India]], for instance, the 2001 census recorded only 93 girls per 100 boys. This is a sharp decline from 1961, when the number of girls per 100 boys was nearly 98.&lt;ref name="Women &amp; Health: Today's Evidence, Tomorrow's Agenda"/&gt; In certain parts of India, such as [[Kangra, Himachal Pradesh|Kangra]] and [[Rohtak]] the number of girls for every 100 boys can be as low as in the 70s.&lt;ref name="Disappearing Daughters"&gt;{{cite report|last=John |first=Mary E. |last2=Kaur |first2=Ravinder |last3=Palriwala |first3=Rajni |last4=Raju |first4=Saraswati |last5=Sagar |first5=Alpana |title=Disappearing Daughters |year=2008 |publisher=ActionAid |location=London, UK |url=http://www.actionaid.org.uk/doc_lib/disappearing_daughters_0608.pdf |accessdate=25 Apr 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, low female to male numbers have also been recorded in other Asian countries – most notably in [[China]] where, according to a survey in 2005, only 84 girls were born for every 100 boys. Although this was a slight increase from 81 during 2001–2004, it is still much lower than the 93 girls per 100 boys in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name="Women &amp; Health: Today's Evidence, Tomorrow's Agenda"/&gt; The increasing number of unborn girls in the late 20th century has been attributed to technological advances that made pre-birth sex determination, also known as [[prenatal sex discernment]], such as the [[ultrasound]] test more affordable and accessible to a wider population. This allowed parents who prefer a son to determine the sex of their unborn child during the early stages of pregnancy. By having early identification of their unborn child's sex, parents could practice [[sex-selective abortion]], where they would abort the [[fetus]] if it was not the preferred sex, which in most cases is that of the female.&lt;ref name="World Development Report 2012: Gender Equality and Development"/&gt;

Additionally, the culture of [[son preference]] also extends beyond birth in the form of preferential treatment of boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arnold|first=Fred|author2=Choe, Minja Kim |author3=Roy, T.K. |title=Son Preference, the Family-building Process and Child Mortality in India|journal=Population Studies|date=1 November 1998|volume=52|issue=3|pages=301–315|doi=10.1080/0032472031000150486}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic benefits of having a son in countries like India also explain the preferential treatment of boys over girls. For example, in Indian culture it is the sons that provide care and economic stability to their parents as they age, so having a boy helps to ensure the futures of many Indian families.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosenblum|first=Daniel|date=2016-07-15|title=Estimating the Private Economic Benefits of Sons Versus Daughters in India|url=https://tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13545701.2016.1195004|journal=Feminist Economics|language=en|volume=23|issue=1|pages=77–107|doi=10.1080/13545701.2016.1195004|issn=1354-5701|via=Taylor and Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; This preferential care can be manifested in many ways, such as through differential provision of food resources, attention, and medical care. Data from [[household]] surveys over the past 20 years has indicated that the female disadvantage has persisted in India and may have even worsened in some other countries such as [[Nepal]] and [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="World Development Report 2012: Gender Equality and Development"/&gt;

====Female genital mutilation====
[[File:FGM prevalence UNICEF 2015.svg|thumb|Prevalence of [[female genital mutilation]] in Africa, Yemen and Iraq]]
Harmful cultural practices such as [[female genital mutilation]] (FGM) also cause girls and women to face health risks. Millions of females are estimated to have undergone FGM, which involves partial or total removal of the external female [[genitalia]] for non-medical reasons. It is estimated that 92.5 million females over 10 years of age in [[Africa]] are living with the consequences of FGM. Of these, 12.5 million are girls between 10 and 14 years of age. Each year, about three million girls in Africa are subjected to FGM.&lt;ref name="World Health Organization: Gender. Women and Health"/&gt;

Often performed by traditional practitioners using unsterile techniques and devices, FGM can have both immediate and late complications.&lt;ref name="Care of women with female genital mutilation/cutting"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abdulcadir|first=J|author2=Margairaz, C |author3=Boulvain, M |author4= Irion, O |title=Care of women with female genital mutilation/cutting|journal=Swiss Medical Weekly|date=6 January 2011|doi=10.4414/smw.2011.13137}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kelly|first=Elizabeth|author2=Hillard, Paula J Adams|title=Female genital mutilation|journal=Current Opinion in Obstetrics and Gynecology|date=1 October 2005|volume=17|issue=5|pages=490–494|doi=10.1097/01.gco.0000183528.18728.57}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include excessive bleeding, [[urinary tract infections]], wound infection, and in the case of unsterile and reused instruments, hepatitis and HIV.&lt;ref name="Care of women with female genital mutilation/cutting" /&gt; In the long run, [[scars]] and [[keloids]] can form, which can obstruct and damage the urinary and genital tracts. According to a 2005 [[UNICEF]] report on FGM, it is unknown how many girls and women die from the procedure because of poor record keeping and a failure to report fatalities.&lt;ref name="Changing a Harmful Social Convention: Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting"&gt;{{cite report |author=UNICEF|title=Changing a Harmful Social Convention: Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting|year=2005 |publisher=Innocenti Digest/UNICEF|location=Florence, Italy}}&lt;/ref&gt; FGM may also complicate pregnancy and place women at a higher risk for obstetrical problems, such as prolonged labor.&lt;ref name="Care of women with female genital mutilation/cutting" /&gt; According to a 2006 study by the WHO involving 28,393 women, [[neonatal mortality]] increases when women have experienced FGM; an additional ten to twenty babies were estimated to die per 1,000 deliveries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Female genital mutilation and obstetric outcome: WHO collaborative prospective study in six African countries|journal=The Lancet|date=1 June 2006|volume=367|issue=9525|pages=1835–1841|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68805-3|pmid=16753486 | last1 = Banks | first1 = E | last2 = Meirik | first2 = O | last3 = Farley | first3 = T | last4 = Akande | first4 = O | last5 = Bathija | first5 = H | last6 = Ali | first6 = M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychological complications are related to cultural context. Women who undergo FGM might be emotionally affected when they move outside their traditional circles and are confronted with the view that mutilation is not the norm.&lt;ref name="Care of women with female genital mutilation/cutting" /&gt;

====Violence and abuse====

[[File:NIH child sex abuse disorders graph.svg|thumb|National Institute of Health: Among more than 1,400 adult females, childhood sexual abuse was associated with increased likelihood of drug dependence, alcohol dependence, and psychiatric disorders]]

Violence against women is a widespread global occurrence with serious public health implications. This is a result of social and gender bias.&lt;ref name="World Health Organization: Violence and injuries to/against women"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/gho/women_and_health/diseases_risk_factors/violence_injuries_text/en/ |title=Violence and injuries to/against women|publisher=WHO |accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many societies in [[developing nations]] function on a [[patriarchal]] framework, where women are often viewed as a form of property and as socially inferior to men. This unequal standing in the social hierarchy has led women to be physically, emotionally, and sexually abused by men, both as children and adults. These abuses usually constitute some form of violence. Although children of both sexes do suffer from physical [[maltreatment]], [[sexual abuse]], and other forms of exploitation and violence, studies have indicated that young girls are far more likely than boys to experience [[sexual abuse]]. In a 2004 study on child abuse, 25.3% of all girls surveyed experienced some form of sexual abuse, a percentage that is three times higher than that of boys (8.7%).&lt;ref name="Comparative quantification of health risks: global and regional burden of disease attributable to selected major risk factors"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ezzati |first=M |last2=Lopez |first2=A |last3=Rodgers |first3=A |last4=Murray |first4=C |title=Comparative quantification of health risks: global and regional burden of disease attributable to selected major risk factors|year=2004|publisher=World Health Organization|location=Geneva}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such violence against women, especially sexual abuse, is increasingly being documented in areas experiencing armed conflicts. Presently, women and girls bear the brunt of social turmoil worldwide, making up an estimated 65% of the millions who are displaced and affected.&lt;ref name="Focus: Women’s health"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Garcia-Moreno|first=C|last2=Reis|first2=C|title=Overview on women’s health in crises|year=2005|journal=Health in emergencies |issue=20 |url=http://www.who.int/entity/hac/network/newsletter/Final_HiE_n20_%20Jan_2005_finalpdf.pdf| publisher=World Health Organization |location=Geneva}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these places which are facing such problems include [[Rwanda]], [[Kosovo]], and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].&lt;ref name="Focus: Women’s health"/&gt; This comes as a result of both the general instability around the region, as well as a tactic of [[warfare]] to intimidate enemies. Often being placed in emergency and refugee settings, girls and women alike are highly vulnerable to abuse and exploitation by military combatants, [[security forces]], and members of rival communities.&lt;ref name="Comparative quantification of health risks: global and regional burden of disease attributable to selected major risk factors"/&gt;

The [[sexual violence]] and abuse of both young and adult women have both short and long-term consequences, contributing significantly to a myriad of health issues into [[adulthood]]. These range from debilitating physical injuries, [[reproductive health]] issues, substance abuse, and psychological trauma. Examples of the above categories include [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and drug use and dependence, sexually transmitted diseases, and [[suicide]] attempts.&lt;ref name="Focus: Women’s health"/&gt;

Abused women often have higher rates of unplanned and problematic [[pregnancies]], [[abortions]],  neonatal and infant health issues, [[sexually transmitted infections]] (including HIV), and mental disorders (such as depression, [[anxiety disorders]], [[sleep disorders]] and eating disorders) as compared to their non-abused peers.&lt;ref name="World Development Report 2012: Gender Equality and Development"/&gt; During [[peacetime]], most violence against women is perpetrated by either male individuals whom them know or intimate male partners. An eleven-country study conducted by WHO between 2000 and 2003 found that, depending on the country, between 15% and 71% of women have experienced physical or sexual violence by a [[husband]] or partner in their lifetime, and 4% to 54% within the previous year.&lt;ref name="Prevalence of intimate partner violence: findings from the WHO multi-country study on women’s health and domestic violence against women"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Garcia-Moreno | first1 = C. | last2 = Jansen | first2 = H.

Studies from [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Israel]], [[South Africa]] and the United States show that between 40% and 70% of female murders were carried out by intimate partners.&lt;ref name="World report on violence and health"&gt;{{cite report |last=Krug|first=E|title=World report on violence and health|year=2002|publisher=World Health Organization|location=Geneva}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other forms of violence against women include [[sexual harassment]] and abuse by authority figures (such as [[teachers]], [[police officers]] or employers), trafficking for forced labour or sex, and traditional practices such as forced [[child marriages]] and dowry-related violence. At its most extreme, violence against women can result in female infanticide and violent death. Despite the size of the problem, many women do not report their experience of [[abuse]] and do not seek help. As a result, violence against [[women]] remains a hidden problem with great human and health care costs.&lt;ref name="World Health Organization: Violence and injuries to/against women"/&gt; Worldwide men account for 79% of all victims of homicide. [[Homicide statistics by gender]]

===Poverty===
[[Poverty]] is another factor that facilitates the continual existence of gender disparities in health.&lt;ref name="World Development Report 2012: Gender Equality and Development"/&gt; Poverty often works in tandem with various cultural norms to indirectly impact women's health. While many [[communities]] and [[households]] are not opposed to helping women attain better health through [[education]], better [[nutrition]], and financial stability, poverty often act as a form of barrier against [[gender equity]] in health for women. Oftentimes, due to financial constraints and limited capital, only a select few are able to receive opportunities, like [[education]] and [[employment]], that might help them attain better health outcomes. However, cultural norms would often prioritized men in receiving these opportunities. This prioritization of males stems from the societal perception that the potential returns to both the household and the community is higher for men than women.&lt;ref name="Women's Education: A Global Challenge"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Nussbaum | first1 = M. C. | title = Women's Education: A Global Challenge | doi = 10.1086/378571 | journal = Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society | volume = 29 | issue = 2 | pages = 325–355 | year = 2004 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Healthcare system===
The [[World Health Organization]] defines health systems as "all the activities whose primary purpose is to promote, restore, or maintain health".&lt;ref name="World Health Report 2001"&gt;{{cite report |author= World Health Organization|title=World Health Report 2001|year=2001|url=http://www.who.int/whr/2001/en/whr01_en.pdf|location=Geneva}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, factors outside of healthcare systems can influence the impact healthcare systems have on the health of different demographics within a population. This is because healthcare systems are known to be influenced by social, cultural and economic frameworks. As a result, health systems are regarded as not only "producers of health and health care", but also as "purveyors of a wider set of societal norms and values," many of which are biased against women&lt;ref name="Trust and the development of health care as a social institution"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gilson|first=L|title=Trust and the development of health care as a social institution|year=2003|journal=Soc Sci Med|volume=56|pages=1453–68|doi=10.1016/s0277-9536(02)00142-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Women and Gender Equity Knowledge Network's Final Report to the WHO Commission on Social Determinants of Health in 2007, health systems in many countries were noted to have been unable to deliver adequately on [[gender equity]] in health. One explanation for this issue is that many healthcare systems tend to neglect the fact that men and women's health needs can be very different.&lt;ref name="Unequal, Unfair, Ineffective and Inefficient Gender Inequity in Health: Why it exists and how we can change it"&gt;{{cite report |last=Sen|first=Gita|last2=Östlin|first2=Piroska|title=Unequal, Unfair, Ineffective and Inefficient Gender Inequity in Health: Why it exists and how we can change it; Final Report to the WHO Commission on Social Determinants of Health|year=2007|publisher=Women and Gender Equity Knowledge Network|url=http://www.who.int/social_determinants/resources/csdh_media/wgekn_final_report_07.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the report, studies have found evidence that the healthcare system can promote gender disparities in health through the lack of [[gender equity]] in terms of the way women are regarded - as both [[consumers]] (users) and producers (carers) of health care services.&lt;ref name="Unequal, Unfair, Ineffective and Inefficient Gender Inequity in Health: Why it exists and how we can change it"/&gt; For instance, healthcare systems tend to regard women as objects rather than subjects, where services are often provided to women as a means of something else rather on the well-being of women.&lt;ref name="Unequal, Unfair, Ineffective and Inefficient Gender Inequity in Health: Why it exists and how we can change it"/&gt; In the case of reproductive health services, these services are often provided as a form of [[fertility control]] rather than as care for women's well-being.&lt;ref name="Reproductive health and human rights - Integrating medicine, ethics and law"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cook|first=R|last2=Dickens|first2=B|last3=Fathalla|first3=M|title=Reproductive health and human rights - Integrating medicine, ethics and law|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, although the majority of the workforce in health care systems are female, many of the working conditions remain discriminatory towards women. Many studies have shown that women are often expected to conform to male work models that ignore their special needs, such as childcare or protection from violence.&lt;ref name="Human Resources for Health: a gender analysis"&gt;{{cite journal |last=George|first=A|title=Human Resources for Health: a gender analysis|year=2007|publisher=Women and Gender Equity Knowledge Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; This significantly reduces the ability and efficiency of female [[caregivers]] providing care to patients, particularly female ones.&lt;ref name="Expanding the care continuum for HIV/AIDS: bringing carers into focus"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ogden|first=J|last2=Esim|first2=S|last3=Grown|first3=C|title=Expanding the care continuum for HIV/AIDS: bringing carers into focus|year=2006|journal=Health Policy Plan|volume=21|pages=333–42|doi=10.1093/heapol/czl025}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="World Health Report 2006"&gt;{{cite report |author= World Health Organization|title=World Health Report 2006|year=2006|url=http://www.who.int/whr/2006/whr06_en.pdf|location=Geneva}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structural gender oppression===
Structural gender inequalities in the allocation of resources, such as [[income]], [[education]], health care, [[nutrition]] and political voice, are strongly associated with poor health and reduced well-being. Very often, such structural [[gender discrimination]] of women in many other areas has an indirect impact on women's health. For example, because women in many [[developing nations]] are less likely to be part of the formal [[labor market]], they often lack access to job security and the benefits of social protection, including access to health care. Additionally, within the formal workforce, women often face challenges related to their lower status, where they suffer [[workplace discrimination]] and [[sexual harassment]]. Studies have shown that this expectation of having to balance the demands of paid work and work at home often give rise to work-related [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], infections, mental ill-health and other problems, which results in women faring poorer in health.&lt;ref name="Gender inequalities in health: the significance of work"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wamala |first=S |last2=Lynch |first2=J|title=Gender and socioeconomic inequalities in health |year=2002|location=Lund, [[Studentlitteratur]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women's health is also put at a higher level of risk as a result of being confined to certain traditional responsibilities, such as [[cooking]] and water collection. Being confined to unpaid [[domestic labor]] not only reduces women's opportunities to education and formal job employment (both of which can indirectly contribute to better health in the long run), but also potentially expose women to higher risk of health issues. For instance, in developing regions where [[solid fuel]]s are used for cooking, women are exposed to a higher level of indoor air pollution due to extended periods of cooking and preparing meals for the family. Breathing air tainted by the burning of [[solid fuel]]s is estimated to be responsible for 641,000 of the 1.3 million deaths of women worldwide each year due to [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder]] (COPD).&lt;ref name="The global burden of disease: 2004 update"&gt;{{cite report |author= World Health Organization |title=The global burden of disease: 2004 update |year=2008 |url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/GBD_report_2004update_full.pdf |location=Geneva }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some settings, structural gender inequity is associated with particular forms of violence, marginalization, and oppression against females. This includes violent assault by men, [[child sexual abuse]], strict regulation of women's behavior and movement, female genital mutilation, and exploitative, forced labor.&lt;ref name="Women &amp; Health: Today's Evidence, Tomorrow's Agenda"/&gt;  Women and girls are also vulnerable to less well-documented forms of abuse or exploitation, such as [[human trafficking]] or "[[honor killings]]" for perceived behavioral transgressions and deviation of their social roles. These acts are associated with a wide range of health problems in women such as physical injuries, unwanted [[pregnancies]], [[abortions]], mental disorders such as [[depression (mood)|depression]], and [[anxiety]], substance abuse, and [[sexually transmitted infections]], all of which can potentially lead to premature death.&lt;ref name="Health consequences of intimate partner violence"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Campbell | first1 = J. C. | title = Health consequences of intimate partner violence | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08336-8 | journal = The Lancet | volume = 359 | issue = 9314 | pages = 1331–1336 | year = 2002 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Prevalence of violence and its implications for women’s health"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Plichta | first1 = S. B. | last2 = Falik | first2 = M. | doi = 10.1016/S1049-3867(01)00085-8 | title = Prevalence of violence and its implications for women's health | journal = Women's Health Issues | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = 244–258 | year = 2001 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability of women to utilize health care is also heavily influenced by other forms of structural gender inequalities. These include unequal restriction on one's mobility and behavior, as well as unequal control over financial resources. Many of these social gender inequalities can impact the way women's health is regarded, which can in turn determine the level of access women have to healthcare services and the extent by which households and the larger community are willing to invest in women's health issues.&lt;ref name="Unequal, Unfair, Ineffective and Inefficient Gender Inequity in Health: Why it exists and how we can change it"/&gt;

===Other axes of oppression===

[[File:Uninsured Children by Poverty Status, Household Income, Age, Race and Hispanic Origin and Nativity 2009p28.pdf|thumb|Uninsured Children by Poverty Status, Household Income, Age, Race and Hispanic Origin and Nativity in the United States in 2009]]

Apart from gender discrimination, other axes of oppression also exist in society to further marginalize certain groups of women, especially those who are living in poverty or of minority status in which they live.&lt;ref name="Women &amp; Health: Today's Evidence, Tomorrow's Agenda"/&gt;

====Race and ethnicity====
[[Race (human classification)|Race]] is a well known axis of oppression, where people of color tend to suffer more from [[structural violence]]. For people of color, race can serve as a factor, in addition to gender, that can further influence one's health negatively.&lt;ref name="Pathologies of Power"&gt;{{cite book |last=Farmer |first=Paul |title=Pathologies of Power: Health, Human Rights, and the New War On the Poor |year=2005 |publisher=University of California Press |location=California}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that in both high-income and low-income countries, levels of [[maternal mortality]] may be up to three times higher among women of disadvantaged [[ethnic groups]] than among white women. In a study on race and mother-death within the US, the [[maternal mortality]] rate for [[African Americans]] is close to four times higher than that of white women. Similarly in [[South Africa]], the maternal mortality rate for black/African women and women of color is approximately 10 and 5 times greater respectively than that of white/European women.&lt;ref name="The Penguin Atlas of Women in the World"&gt;{{cite book |last=Seager |first=Roni |title=The Penguin Atlas of Women in the World, 4th Edition |year=2009 |publisher=The Penguin Group |location=New York, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Socioeconomic status====
Although women around the world share many similarities in terms of the health-impacting challenges, there are also many distinct differences that arise from their varying states of socioeconomic conditions. The type of living conditions in which women live is largely associated with not only their own socioeconomic status, but also that of their nation.&lt;ref name="Women &amp; Health: Today's Evidence, Tomorrow's Agenda"/&gt;

At every single age category, women in [[high income countries]] tend to live longer and are less likely to suffer from ill health than and premature mortality than those in [[low income countries]]. Death rates in high-income countries are also very low among children and younger women, where most deaths occur after the age of 60 years. In low-income countries however, the death rates at young ages are much higher, with most death occurring among girls, adolescents, and younger adult women. Data from 66 developing countries show that child mortality rates among the poorest 20% of the population are almost double those in the top 20%.
&lt;ref name="World health statistics 2009"&gt;{{cite report |author=World Health Organization |title=World health statistics 2009 |publisher=World Health Organization, 2009.|year=2009 |location=Geneva}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most striking health outcome difference between rich and poor countries is [[maternal mortality]]. Presently, an overwhelming proportion of maternal mortality is concentrated within the nations that are suffering from poverty or some other form of [[humanitarian crises]], where 99% of the more than half a million maternal deaths every year occur. This comes from the fact that institutional structures which could protect women's health and well-being are either lacking or poorly developed in these places.&lt;ref name="Women &amp; Health: Today's Evidence, Tomorrow's Agenda"/&gt;

The situation is similar within countries as well, where the health of both girls and women is critically affected by social and economic factors. Those who are living in poverty or of lower [[socioeconomic status]] tend to perform poorly in terms of health outcomes. In almost all countries, girls and women living in wealthier households experience lower levels of mortality and higher usage of health care services than those living in the poorer households. Such socioeconomic status-related health disparities is present in every nation around the world, including developed regions.&lt;ref name="Women &amp; Health: Today's Evidence, Tomorrow's Agenda"/&gt;

==Management==

The Fourth World Conference on Women asserts that men and women share the same right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of [[physical health|physical]] and [[mental health]].&lt;ref name="Report of the Fourth World Conference on Women"&gt;{{cite report |author=United Nations|title=Report of the Fourth World Conference on Women, Beijing 4–15 September 1995|year=1996|publisher=United Nations|location=New York|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/beijing/pdf/Beijing%20full%20report%20E.pdf|accessdate=9 Apr 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, women are disadvantaged{{Where|date=October 2013}} due to social, cultural, political and economic factors that directly influence their [[health]] and impede their access to health-related information and care.&lt;ref name="Women &amp; Health: Today's Evidence, Tomorrow's Agenda" /&gt; In the 2008 World Health Report, the [[World Health Organization]] stressed that strategies to improve women's health must take full account of the underlying determinants of health, particularly [[gender inequality]]. Additionally, specific socioeconomic and cultural barriers that hamper women in protecting and improving their [[health]] must also be addressed.&lt;ref name="The World Health Report 2008, Primary Health Care: Now more than ever"&gt;{{cite report |author=World Health Organization|title=The World Health Report 2008, Primary Health Care: Now more than ever |year=2008 |publisher=World Health Organization |location=Geneva |url=http://www.who.int/whr/2008/whr08_en.pdf |accessdate=9 Apr 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender mainstreaming===

[[File:Training rural women in Oral Health Promotion activities in Nepal.jpg|thumb|Training rural women in Oral Health Promotion activities in Nepal]]

[[Gender mainstreaming]] was established as a major global strategy for the promotion of [[gender equality]] in the [[Beijing]] Platform for Action from the Fourth United Nations World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995.&lt;ref name="Gender Mainstreaming: An Overview"&gt;{{cite report |author=United Nations|title=Gender Mainstreaming: An Overview|year=2002|publisher=United Nations|location=New York|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/osagi/pdf/e65237.pdf|accessdate=4 Apr 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender mainstreaming is defined by the [[United Nations]] Economic and Social Council in 1997 as follows: &lt;blockquote&gt;“Mainstreaming a gender perspective is the process of assessing the implications for women and men of any planned action, including legislation, policies or programmes, in all areas and at all levels. It is a strategy for making women’s as well as men’s concerns and experiences an integral dimension of the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies and programmes in all political, economic and societal spheres so that women and men benefit equally and inequality is not perpetuated. The ultimate aim is to achieve gender equality.”&lt;ref name="Gender Mainstreaming: An Overview"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Over the past few years, "[[gender mainstreaming]]" has become a preferred approach for achieving greater health parity between men and women. It stems from the recognition that while technical strategies are necessary, they are not sufficient in alleviating gender disparities in health unless the [[gender discrimination]], bias and inequality that in organizational structures of [[governments]] and organizations – including health systems - are being challenged and addressed.&lt;ref name="Women &amp; Health: Today's Evidence, Tomorrow's Agenda"/&gt; The [[gender mainstreaming]] approach is a response to the realisation that gender concerns must be dealt with in every aspect of [[policy development]] and programming, through systematic gender analyses and the implementation of actions that address the balance of power and the distribution of resources between women and men.&lt;ref name="Gender mainstreaming in health: looking back, looking forward"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ravindran|first=T.K.S.|author2=Kelkar-Khambete, A.|title=Gender mainstreaming in health: looking back, looking forward|journal=Global Public Health|date=1 April 2008|volume=3|issue=sup1|pages=121–142|doi=10.1080/17441690801900761}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to address gender health disparities, gender mainstreaming in health employs a dual focus. First, it seeks to identify and address gender-based differences and inequalities in all health initiatives; and second, it works to implement initiatives that address women's specific health needs that are a result either of
biological differences between women and men (e.g. maternal health) or of gender-based
discrimination in society (e.g. gender-based violence; poor access to health services).&lt;ref name="Women’s health policies and programmes and gender mainstreaming in health policies, programmes and within the health sector institutions."&gt;{{cite report |last=Ravindran |first=TKS |last2=Kelkar-Khambete |first2=A |title=Women’s health policies and programmes and gender mainstreaming in health policies, programmes and within the health sector institutions.

[[Sweden]]’s new public health policy, which came into force in 2003, has been identified as a key example of mainstreaming gender in health policies. According to the [[World Health Organization]], [[Sweden]]’s public health policy is designed to address not only the broader [[social determinants of health]], but also the way in which gender is woven into the public health strategy.&lt;ref name="Women’s health policies and programmes and gender mainstreaming in health policies, programmes and within the health sector institutions."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Equity-oriented national strategy for public health in Sweden: A case study"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ostlin|first=P|last2=Diderichsen|first2=F|title=Equity-oriented national strategy for public health in Sweden: A case study|year=2003|journal=European Centre for Health Policy |url=http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/119916/E69911.pdf |accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Linell|first=A.|author2=Richardson, M.

===Female Empowerment===

The [[United Nations]] has identified the enhancement of women's involvement as way to achieve [[gender equality]] in the realm of education, work, and health.&lt;ref name="Enhancing Participation of Women in Development through an Enabling Environment for Achieving Gender Equality and the Advancement of Women"&gt;{{cite report |author=Division for Advancement of Women, United Nations|title=Enhancing Participation of Women in Development through an Enabling Environment for Achieving Gender Equality and the Advancement of Women, Expert Group Meeting, Bangkok, Thailand, 8 - 11 November 2005| year=2005 |url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/egm/enabling-environment2005/|accessdate=9 Apr 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because women play critical roles as caregivers, formally and informally, in both the household and the larger community. Within the United States, an estimated 66% of all caregivers are female, with one-third of all female caregivers taking care of two or more people&lt;ref name="Caregiving in the U.S. 2009"&gt;{{cite report |author=National Alliance for Caregiving in collaboration with AARP|title=Caregiving in the U.S. 2009 |year=2009 |url=http://www.caregiving.org/data/Caregiving_in_the_US_2009_full_report.pdf|accessdate=9 Apr 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the World Health Organization, it is important that approaches and frameworks that are being implemented to address gender disparities in health acknowledge the fact that majority of the care work is provided by women.&lt;ref name="Women &amp; Health: Today's Evidence, Tomorrow's Agenda"/&gt; A meta-analysis of 40 different women's empowerment projects found that increased female participation have led to a broad range of [[quality of life]] improvements. These improvements include increases in women's advocacy demands and organization strengths, women-centered policy and governmental changes, and improved economic conditions for [[Working class|lower class]] women.&lt;ref name="What is the evidence on effectiveness of empowerment to improve health?"&gt;{{cite report |last=Wallerstein|first=N|title=What is the evidence on effectiveness of empowerment to improve health?

In Nepal, a community-based participatory intervention to identify local [[birthing]] problems and formulating strategies has been shown to be effective in reducing both [[neonatal mortality|neonatal]] and [[maternal mortality]] in a rural population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Manandhar|first=Dharma S|last2=Osrin |first2=David |last3=Shrestha |first3=Bhim Prasad |last4=Mesko |first4=Natasha |last5=Morrison |first5=Joanna |last6=Tumbahangphe |first6=Kirti Man |last7=Tamang |first7=Suresh |last8=Thapa |first8=Sushma |last9=Shrestha |first9=Dej |last10=Thapa |first10=Bidur |last11=Shrestha |first11=Jyoti Raj |last12=Wade |first12=Angie |last13=Borghi |first13=Josephine |last14=Standing |first14=Hilary |last15=Manandhar |first15=Madan |last16=de L Costello |first16=Anthony M|title=Effect of a participatory intervention with women's groups on birth outcomes in Nepal: cluster-randomised controlled trial|journal=The Lancet|date=1 September 2004|volume=364|issue=9438|pages=970–979|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(04)17021-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community-based programs in [[Malaysia]] and [[Sri Lanka]] that used well-trained [[midwives]] as front-line [[health workers]] also produced rapid declines in [[maternal mortality]].&lt;ref name="Investing in maternal health : learning from Malaysia and Sri Lanka"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pathmanathan |first=Indra |last2=Liljestrand |first2=Jerker |last3=Martins |first3=Jo.

'''Global intellectual history''' is the history of thought in the world across the span of human history, from the [[invention of writing]] to the present. For information about the methodology of [[intellectual history]], please see the [[intellectual history|relevant article]].

In recent years, historians such as [[Christopher Bayly|C. A. Bayly]] have been calling for a ''global intellectual history'' to be written. They stress that to understand the history of ideas across time and space, it is necessary to study from a [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] or global point of view the connections and the parallels in intellectual development across the world. Yet these separate histories and their convergence in the modern period have yet to be brought together into a single historical narrative. Nonetheless, some global histories, like Bayly's own ''Birth of the Modern World'' or [[David Armitage (historian)|David Armitage]]'s ''The Declaration of Independence: A Global History'' offer contributions to the huge and necessarily collaborative project of writing the history of thought in a comparative and especially connective way. Other examples of transnational intellectual histories include [[Albert Hourani]]'s ''Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age''.

The origins of human intellectual history arguably began before the [[invention of writing]], but historians are by definition only concerned with the eras in which writing was present. In the spirit of a historiographic project that is relevant to all human beings and that has yet to be completed, the sections that follow briefly review currents of thought in pre-modern and modern history of the world, and are organized by geographic area (and within each section, chronologically).

==Europe and the Americas==
The modern intellectual history of Europe cannot be separated from various bodies of ancient thought, from the works of classical Greek and Latin authors to the writings of the fathers of the Christian Church. Such a broad survey of topics is not attempted here, however. A debatable but defensible starting point for modern European thought might instead be identified with the birth of [[scholasticism]] and [[humanism]] in the 13th and 14th centuries. Both of these intellectual currents were associated with classical revivals (in the case of scholasticism, the rediscovery of [[Aristotle]]; in the case of humanism, of Latin antiquity, especially [[Cicero]]) and with prominent founders, [[Aquinas]] and [[Petrarch]] respectively. But they were both significantly original intellectual experiences, as well as self-consciously modern, so that they make an appropriate starting point for this survey.

What follows below is a selective and far from complete listing of significant trends and individuals in the history of European thought. While movements such as the Enlightenment or Romanticism are relatively imprecise approximations, rarely taken too seriously by scholars, they are good starting points for approaching the enormous complexity of the history of Europe's intellectual heritage. It is hoped that interested readers will pursue the listed topics in greater depth by consulting the respective articles and the suggestions for further reading.

The intellectual history of western [[Europe]] and the [[Americas]] includes:
{{div col|colwidth=30em}}
*[[Scholasticism]]: Associated especially with [[Aquinas]] and the [[recovery of Aristotle]], a movement that was popular in universities and provided a new way of reasoning especially in law, philosophy, theology.
*[[Humanism]]: Humanists were associated with the discipline of [[rhetoric]] but they were not just orators, they also learned ancient languages, especially [[classical Greek]] and created new knowledge about the secular past. The revival of ancient literature and philosophy was of immense importance for the further development of European thought. The first humanist is considered to be [[Petrarch]]. Later exponents of note were [[Leonardo Bruni]], [[Lorenzo Valla]], and [[Erasmus of Rotterdam]].
*[[The Renaissance]]: A movement in the arts and letters, it is associated particularly with humanism, but also with new trends in painting and with the efflorescence of a new courtly culture that from [[Italy]] (c.1350) spread across Europe in the 15th and 16th centuries.
*[[Scientific Revolution|The New Philosophy]]: The 20th century dubbed this the [[Scientific Revolution]], but in the 17th century, the new science was more often considered to be a new way of doing philosophy. It is associated mainly with the thought of [[Francis Bacon]] and [[Descartes]]. Other important philosophers were: [[Hobbes]], [[Pierre Gassendi|Gassendi]], [[Nicolas Malebranche|Malebranche]], [[Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]. Advances in [[astronomy]] were made by [[Copernicus]], [[Tycho Brahe|Brahe]], [[Kepler]] and [[Galileo]].
*[[The Royal Society]]: A secular creation of an intellectual world led by figures such as [[Isaac Newton]], [[Robert Hooke]], [[Christopher Wren]], [[Joseph Addison]], and [[Bishop Sprat]].
*[[The Enlightenment]]: Key developments in thought included [[Human rights|The rights of man]], [[representative democracy|political representation]], [[political economy]], [[deism]]. Notable participants counted [[Pierre Bayle|Bayle]], [[David|Hume]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Adam Ferguson]], [[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle|Fontenelle]], the [[Comte de Buffon]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Voltaire]], [[Rousseau]], [[Diderot]], [[Moses Mendelssohn]], [[Giambattista Vico|Vico]].
*[[The Encyclopaedists]]: The creation of central repositories of knowledge available to all outside of academies, including mass-market encyclopaedias and dictionaries: [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]], [[Samuel Johnson]], [[Voltaire]], and [[Ephraim Chambers]].
*[[Romanticism]] : Individual, subjective, imaginative, personal, visionary (scholarly sources [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], [[Sidney Hook|Hook]], and [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]]).
*[[Post-romanticism]]: Reaction to [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]], opposes external-only observations by adding internal observations (scholarly sources [[Auguste Comte|Comte]], [[Leopold von Ranke|von Ranke]]).
*[[Modernism]] : Rejects Christian academic scholarly tradition (scholarly sources [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Jacob Burckhardt]], [[Charles A. Beard|Charles Beard]], [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Carl Jung]]).
*[[Pragmatism]] : Links the meaning of beliefs to the actions of a believer, and the truth of beliefs to success of those actions in securing a believer's goals. [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[William James]], [[John Dewey]], [[F.C.S. Schiller]], [[Richard Rorty]]. Originated in late nineteenth century America.
*[[Existentialism]]: Pre- and post-WW2 rejection of Western norms and cultural values.  [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Albert Camus]], [[Hannah Arendt]], [[Hans Jonas]], [[Karl Löwith]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], [[Martin Buber]], [[Edmund Husserl]]. Engaged with the intellectual prominence of fascism and socialism in Europe during in the 1930s and 1940s, which they saw needed both repudiation and study, as a way to re-establish the individual against the values of a hostile and destructive series of communities creating alienation, isolation, and individual meaninglessness.
*[[Postmodernism]] : Rejects Modernism, [[meta-narrative]] - multiple perspective, role of individual (scholarly sources [[Jean-François Lyotard|Lyotard]], [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], [[Roland Barthes|Barthes]], [[Clifford Geertz|Geertz]]).
*[[Structuralism]] : Many phenomena do not occur in isolation but in relation to each other (scholarly sources [[Clifford Geertz|Geertz]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Lévi-Strauss]]).
*[[Poststructuralism]] :[[Deconstruction]], destabilizes the relationship between language and objects the language refers to (scholarly sources [[Jean-François Lyotard|Lyotard]], [[Jacques Derrida|Derrida]], [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]).

==South and East Asia==
''Pre-Modern East Asia''

The intellectual history of China is connected to the birth of scholarship in ancient China, the creation of [[Confucianism]] with its extensive exegesis of the texts of [[Confucius]], and the active part of scholars in governments. In Korea, the [[yangban]] scholar movement drove the development of [[Traditional Korean thought|Korean intellectual history]] from the late [[Goryeo]] to the golden age of intellectual achievement in the [[Joseon Dynasty]].

In [[China]], ''literati'' referred to the government officials who formed the ruling class in China for over two thousand years. These ''[[scholar-bureaucrats]]'' were a [[status group]] of educated [[laymen]], not ordained [[priest]]s. They were not a [[hereditary]] group as their position depended on their knowledge of writing and literature. After 200 B.C. the system of selection of candidates was influenced by [[Confucianism]] and established its ethic among the literati.

Confucianism (儒家, literally "scholarly tradition") is a Chinese ethical and philosophical system originally developed from the teachings of the early Chinese sage Confucius. Confucius is seen as the founder of the teachings of Confucianism, although he claimed to follow the ways of people before him. Confucianism is a complex system of moral, social, political, philosophical, and religious thought which has had tremendous influence on the culture and history of East Asia. Some people in Europe have considered it to have been the "state religion" in East Asian countries because of governmental promotion of Confucianist values and needs.

Other ancient intellectual currents in East Asia include [[Buddhism]] and [[Daoism]].

''Modern East Asia''

The modern intellectual history of [[China]] is considered to begin with the arrival of the [[Jesuits]] in the sixteenth century. The Jesuits brought with them new astronomical and cartographic knowledge, and were responsible for new developments in [[Chinese science]]. Science in modern China has been the subject of the work of the historian [[Benjamin Elman]].

''Pre-Modern South Asia''

Indian thought is a broad topic that includes the ancient epics of South Asia, the development of what is now called [[Hinduism]] and [[Hindu philosophy]] and the rise of [[Buddhism]], as well as many other topics relating to the political and artistic lives of pre-modern South Asia.

[[Ram Sharan Sharma]]'s work ''Aspects of Political Ideas and Institutions in India'' ([[Motilal Banarsidass]] is the most authoritative account of ancient Indian political ideas and institutions. It deals with the intellectual standards in ancient India in terms of political institutions.

==Africa and the Middle East==
''Pre-Modern History''

The culture of the ancient [[Near East]] and eventually of much of Africa as well was modified significantly by the arrival of [[Islam]] beginning in the seventh century CE. The history of [[Islam]] has been the work of many scholars, both Muslim and non-Muslim, and including such luminaries as [[Ignác Goldziher]], [[Marshall Hodgson]] and in more recent times [[Patricia Crone]]. Islamic culture is not a simple and unified entity. The history of Islam, like that of other religions, is a history of different interpretations and approaches to Islam. There is no a-historical Islam outside the process of historical development.

[[Islamic thought]] includes a variety of different intellectual disciplines, including theology, the study of the [[Qur'an]], the study of [[Hadith]], [[history]], [[grammar]], [[rhetoric]] and [[Islamic philosophy|philosophy]]. For more information see the [[Islamic Golden Age]].

Classical Islamic scholars and authors include:
{{div col|colwidth=22em}}
*[[Ali al-Masudi]]
*[[Ibn Khaldūn]]
*[[Al-Ma'arri]]
*[[Taftazani]]
*[[Muhammad al-Bukhari]]
*[[Ibn Sina]]
*[[Ibn Rushd]]
*[[Ibn Arabi]]
*[[Ibn Hisham]]
*[[al-Tabari]]
{{div col end}}

[[Persian philosophy]] can be traced back as far as to Old Iranian philosophical traditions and  thoughts which originated in ancient [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]] roots and were considerably influenced by  [[Zarathustra]]'s teachings. Throughout Iranian history and due to remarkable political and social changes such as the [[Alexander the Great|Macedonian]], [[Islamic conquest of Persia|Arab]] and [[Mongol invasion of Central Asia|Mongol]] invasions of Persia a wide spectrum of schools of thoughts showed a variety of views on philosophical questions extending from Old Iranian and mainly [[Zoroastrianism]]-related traditions to schools appearing in the late pre-Islamic era such as [[Manicheism]] and [[Mazdakism]] as well as various post-Islamic schools. Iranian philosophy after Arab invasion of [[Persia]], is characterized by different interactions with the [[Ancient philosophy|Old Iranian philosophy]], the [[Greek philosophy]] and with the development of [[Islamic philosophy]]. The [[Illumination School]] and the [[Transcendent Philosophy]] are regarded as two of the main philosophical traditions of that era in Persia.

''Modern Near and Middle East''

[[Islam and modernity]] encompass the relation and compatibility between the phenomenon of modernity, its related concepts and ideas, and the religion of Islam. In order to understand the relation between Islam and modernity, one point should be made in the beginning. Similarly, modernity is a complex and multidimensional phenomenon rather than a unified and coherent phenomenon. It has historically had different schools of thoughts moving in many directions.

[[Intellectual movements in Iran]] involve the Iranian experience of [[modernism]], through which Iranian modernity and its associated art, science, literature, poetry, and political structures have been evolving since the 19th century. [[Religious intellectualism in Iran]] develops gradually and subtly. It reached its apogee during the Persian Constitutional Revolution (1906–11). The process involved numerous philosophers, sociologists, political scientists and cultural theorists. However the associated art, cinema and poetry remained to be developed.

''Modern Africa''

Recent concepts about African culture include the [[African Renaissance]] and [[Afrocentrism]]. The [[African Renaissance]] is a concept popularized by [[President of South Africa|South African President]] [[Thabo Mbeki]] who called upon the African people and nations to solve the many problems troubling the [[Africa]]n continent.  It reached its height in the late 1990s but continues to be a key part of the post-[[apartheid]] intellectual agenda in South Africa. The concept however extends well beyond intellectual life to politics and economic development.

With the rise of [[Afrocentrism]], the push away from [[Eurocentrism]] has led to the focus on the contributions of [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African people]] and their model of world civilization and [[history]]. Afrocentrism aims to shift the focus from a perceived European-centered history to an [[Africa]]n-centered history. More broadly, Afrocentrism is concerned with distinguishing the influence of [[Demography of Europe|European]] and [[Oriental]] peoples from African achievements.

Notable modern African intellectual include:
{{div col|colwidth=22em}}
*[[Taban Lo Liyong]]
*[[Wole Soyinka]]
*[[Frantz Fanon]]
*[[Chinua Achebe]]
*[[Yusuf Bala Usman]]
*[[W. E. B. Du Bois]] spent his final years in Ghana

'''IMFI''' is an acronym for '''I'''nitial, '''M'''edial, '''F'''inal, '''I'''solated, a [[writing system]] in which each character has four different potential shapes:

* ''initial'' - used for the first character in a word
* ''medial'' - used in the middle of a word
* ''final'' - used for the last character in a word
* ''isolated'' - used for single-letter words

The [[Arabic]] and [[Syriac script]] is an example of an IMFI writing system.

[[File:Paris - Playing chess at the Jardins du Luxembourg - 2966.jpg|thumb|Intellect is often referred to the rational and logical side of the human mind.]]&lt;!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: See talk page: this mini-article is an attempt to provide a suitable target for the many current and future article text links to "Intellect". It is not appropriate to leave them as "links to disambiguation page". It may be non-standard, but seems appropriate in this case where experts in the field cannot agree which article is really "Intellect". --&gt;

'''Intellect''' is a term used in studies of the [[human]] [[mind]], and refers to the ability of the mind to come to correct conclusions about what is [[truth|true]] or [[reality|real]], and about how to [[problem solving|solve problems]]. Historically the term comes from the Greek philosophical term ''nous'', which was translated into Latin as ''[[wikt:intellectus|intellectus]]'' (derived from the verb ''intelligere'', "to understand", from ''inter'', "between" and ''legere'', "to choose"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Colman|first1=Andrew M.|title=A dictionary of psychology|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford [etc.]|isbn=9780191726828|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and into French and then English as ''[[wikt:intelligence#French|intelligence]]'' (other than ''intellect''). Intellect is in fact considered as a branch of [[intelligence]] (see [[#Intellect vs intelligence|Intellect vs intelligence]]).

Discussion of the intellect can be divided into two broad areas. In both of these areas, the terms "intellect" and "intelligence" have continued to be used as related words.

* In philosophy, especially in [[classical philosophy|classical]] and [[medieval philosophy]] the intellect or ''[[nous]]'' is an important subject connected to the question of how humans can [[knowledge|know things]]. Especially during [[late antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]], the intellect was often proposed as a concept which could reconcile philosophical and scientific understandings of [[nature (philosophy)|nature]] with [[monotheism|monotheistic]] religious understandings, by making the intellect a link between each human [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], and the divine intellect (or intellects) of the [[cosmos]] itself. (During the Latin Middle Ages a distinction developed whereby the term "intelligence" was typically used to refer to the incorporeal beings which governed the celestial spheres in many of these accounts.&lt;ref name=Davidson&gt;{{Citation|title=Alfarabi, Avicenna, and Averroes, on Intellect|last=Davidson|first=Herbert|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1992}} page 6.&lt;/ref&gt;) Also see: [[passive intellect]] and [[active intellect]].
* In modern [[psychology]] and [[neuroscience]], intelligence and intellect are used as terms describing mental ability (or [[Theory of multiple intelligences|abilities]]) that allow people to [[understanding|understand]]. A distinction is sometimes made whereby intellect is considered to be related to "facts" in contrast to intelligence concerning "feelings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-consciousness-question/201205/intellect-and-intelligence|title=Intellect and Intelligence|website=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intellect refers to the cognition and rational mental processes gained through external input rather than internal.

A person who uses intelligence (thought and reason) and [[critical thinking|critical]] or [[Logic|analytical]] reasoning in either a [[profession]]al or a [[Individual capacity|personal capacity]] is often referred to as an [[intellectual]].

== Intellect vs intelligence ==
Intellect is often considered to be a branch of [[intelligence]] reflecting mainly its logical and rational side.

Because of the lack of [[emotion]]al and sensitive engagement, intellect is sometimes considered to be strictly limited to [[fact]]s and not going beyond mere raw knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.dhyanapeetam.org/article/instinct-intellect-intelligence-intuition#gsc.tab=0|title = Instinct, intellect, intelligence, intuition|date = |accessdate = 29 October 2015|website = Nithyananda Sangha|publisher = |last = Sangha|first = Nithyananda}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, intellect can carry a high level of complexity and thus avoid linear and formal logic patterns by referring to such mental processes as, for example, [[fuzzy logic]] and [[dialectical logic]].&lt;ref&gt;Rowan, John (1989). ''The Intellect''. SAGE Social Science Collections.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development of intellect&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Psychology of Knowledge, Development of the Intellect|url = http://augustinianparadigm.com/psychology_of_knowledge.htm|website = augustinianparadigm.com|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==
[[Experience]] plays a crucial role in the formation of intellect. Through solving life problems people can reach intellectual enlightenment and improve their [[behavior]]al patterns to act more reasonably and appropriately in the future. Therefore, intellectual development is encouraged by the feeling of dissatisfaction gained from particular situation’s outcome and the emanating search for better solutions. Only experience can provide people with genuine and thoughtful [[understanding]] of [[reality]], which consequently contributes to intellectual development.

Understanding is built upon creating a [[conceptual model|model]] of the reality through human [[perception]] and [[cognition|cognitive reflection]]. The process of finding solutions to life problems enriches human mental “database” of reality attributes. When acquiring the most accurate understanding of the surrounding world, the model mirrored in human [[mind]] becomes very similar or identical to the reality and that is when the intellect releases its full potential.

Intellect that reaches its maturity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=chief|first1=Gary R. VandenBos, editor in|title=APA dictionary of psychology|date=2006|publisher=American Psychological Association|location=Washington, DC.|isbn=978-1-59147-380-0|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; is referred as self-management. At this state intellect can encounter every problem it faces and not only change itself in the most efficient manner, but also alter the reality in the most desirable way. Overall, success and [[failure]] turn to depend primarily on the extent of intellectual capabilities.
[[File:Guilford model.jpg|thumb|349x349px|Intellect structure by J.P.Guilford]]

== Intellect structure ==
According to [[J. P. Guilford|J.P.Guilford]], intellect consists of three key parameters: operations, contents and products. Each parameter contains specific elements, which are independent and therefore should be measured individually and considered as autonomous units of human intellect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Structure of Intellect (J.P. Guilford)|url = http://www.instructionaldesign.org/theories/intellect.html|website = www.instructionaldesign.org|accessdate = 2015-10-28|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Operations are represented by [[cognition]], [[memory]], [[divergent thinking|divergent]] and [[convergent thinking|convergent production]], and [[evaluation]]. Content can be figural, [[symbol]]ic, [[semantics|semantic]] and behavioral. Products are divided into units, classes, [[Relation of Ideas|relations]], systems, transformations and implications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Guilford's 'structure of intellect' model|url = http://homepages.which.net/~gk.sherman/mbaaaaab.htm|website = homepages.which.net|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intellect in therapy ==
[[Intellectualization]] is a therapeutic method, which is based on avoiding emotional penetration through intense intellectual focus. When exercising this technique, the problem that can cause psychological disturbance is approached from rational, cool and scientific attitude. It is one of the [[defense mechanisms]] described by [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] that blocks [[feeling]]s to prevent human [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]] from [[anxiety]] and [[Stress (psychological)|stress]].
	
The principle that shapes intellectualization involves Freud’s concept of [[Id, ego and super-ego]]. [[Ego psychology|Ego]] is a conscious part of [[Personality|human personality]], Id refers to unconscious, “dark” side of human nature driven by animal instincts, and super-ego is a controlling mechanism that adjusts people’s actions and behavior to social norms and expectations. The purpose of intellectualization is to isolate Id and make conscious aspects of life the only object of reflection and consideration. Therefore, this defense mechanism aims to protect ego from unconscious processes, which are often impossible to handle and control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Teaching Psychology - Defense Mechanisms|url = http://www.healthguidance.org/entry/13951/1/Teaching-Psychology--Defense-Mechanisms.html|website = www.healthguidance.org|accessdate = 2015-10-25|last = Lemouse, M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the ways to launch intellectualization is to use [[jargon]] and complex [[Scientific terminology|scientific terms]] instead of regularly used words. A common example is saying “carcinoma” instead of “cancer” if a doctor wants to mitigate the effect of announcing the disease by driving patient’s attention away from the illness and approaching it more systematically to avoid emotional outburst.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Intellectualization: isolation from emotions!(A Psychological Tranquilizer) {{!}} Mindful Cogitations|url = http://abhakhetarpal.in/blog/intellectualization-isolation-from-emotions|website = abhakhetarpal.in|accessdate = 2015-10-26|last = Khetarpal, A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, intellectualization is sometimes criticized because of its disregard of feelings. That subsequently leads to the full denial of [[intuition]], which sometimes contributes to [[Decision-making|decision-making process]]. Moreover, the absence of emotional stimuli can deprive people from [[motivation]] and therefore lead to dissatisfaction and [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]]. Furthermore, “emotional constipation” threats human [[Creativity|creativity capabilities]] by replacing them with more matter-of-fact solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = On Finding Out How We Don't Know Ourselves in Therapy and Counselling.

The '''Interpolation Theory''', also known as the '''Intercalation Theory''' or the '''Antithetic Theory''', is a theory that attempts to explain the origin of the [[alternation of generations]] in [[plants]].  The Interpolation Theory suggests that the [[sporophyte]] generation progenated from a [[haploid]], green [[algal]] [[thallus]] in which repeated [[mitotic]] cell divisions of a [[zygote]] produced an [[embryo]] retained on the [[thallus]] and gave rise to the [[diploid]] phase ([[sporophyte]]).  Ensuing [[evolution]] caused the [[sporophyte]] to become increasingly complex, both organographically and anatomically.

The Interpolation Theory was introduced by [[Ladislav Josef Čelakovský|Čelakovský]] (1874) as the Antithetic Theory.  Bower (1889) further developed this theory and renamed it the Interpolation Theory.  The theory was later supported by Overton (1893), Scott (1896), Strasburger (1897), Williams (1904), and others.

The gradual [[evolution]] of an independent, [[sporophyte]] phase was viewed by Bower as being closely related to the transition from aquatic to terrestrial plant life on Earth. 

Evidence supporting this theory can be found in the life cycle of modern [[Bryophytes]] in which the [[sporophyte]] is physiologically dependent on the [[gametophyte]].  Competing theories include the [[Transformation theory (biology)|Transformation theory]], which was introduced as the [[Homologous theory]] by Čelakovský, and also renamed by Bower.

'''James J. Kay''' (June 18, 1954 – May 30, 2004) was an ecological scientist and policy-maker.  He was a respected physicist best known for his theoretical work on [[complexity]] and [[thermodynamics]].

==Biography==
James Kay held a BS in Physics from [[McGill University]] and a Ph.D in Systems Design Engineering from the [[University of Waterloo]]. His Ph.D. thesis was entitled ''Self-Organization in Living Systems''.&lt;ref name="KayPhDThesis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KaysWebsite"/&gt;  Much of his work relates to integrating thermodynamics into an understanding of self-organization in biological systems.&lt;ref name="eulogy"/&gt;  For example, when water in a pot is heated, it will spontaneously form convection currents such as [[Bénard cells|Bénard_cell]].  This is an example where as the amount of energy available to a system increases, the system self-organizes in order to dissipate energy more efficiently.  Kay has examined how similar types of self-organization can occur within living systems at the level of individual organisms and ecosystems.  In other words, organisms and ecosystems evolve to use the maximum amount of energy available to them.  This has been backed up by studies showing that more mature ecosystems such as [[Old-growth forest|old growth forests]] are cooler (i.e. dissipate more incoming energy) than [[Clearcutting|clear cuts]] or bare rock that receive the same amount of energy.&lt;ref name="NewScientist"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ExergyAnalysisOfEcoSystems"/&gt;

Kay was an Associate Professor of Environment and Resource Studies at the [[University of Waterloo]], with cross-appointments in Systems Design Engineering, Geography, Management Sciences, and the School of Planning. He was also cross-posted to the School of Rural Planning and Development at the [[University of Guelph]].&lt;ref name="KaysWebsite"/&gt;

==Public Policy==

===Local===
Kay was founding Chair of the University of Waterloo's Greening the Campus Committee (1990–1996), which is responsible for overseeing the transition to a sustainable campus.  He was also a founding member of the City of Kitchener's Environment Committee, which developed a Strategic Plan for the Environment and an [[ecosystem-based management|ecosystem-based]] plan for the Huron Natural Area. He sat on the committee which developed the award-winning (Canadian Institute of Planners) bicycle master plan for Kitchener, and was on the City's committee for the transition to a [[hydrogen economy]].&lt;ref name="KaysWebsite"/&gt;

===Provincial and National===
Kay served as an adviser to the Ontario Ministry of the Environment and delivered guest lectures to the National Ministry of the Environment. He served on the Long Term Ecosystem Research and Monitoring Panel of the Royal Society of Canada.&lt;ref name="KaysWebsite"/&gt;

===International===
Kay was a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, Beijer Institute, Working Group on Complex Ecological Economic Systems Modeling. He was also an active member of the United States National Science Foundation Advisory Committee on Environmental Research and Education.&lt;ref name="KaysWebsite"/&gt;

Traditional '''Japanese units of measurement''' or the '''shakkanhō''' ({{lang|ja|{{linktext|尺貫法}}}}, "''shaku–kan'' system") is the [[customary units|traditional]] [[system of measurement]] used by the people of the [[Japanese archipelago]]. It is largely based on the [[Chinese units of measurement|Chinese system]], which spread to Japan and the rest of the [[Sinosphere]] in antiquity. It has remained mostly unaltered since the adoption of the measures of the [[Tang Dynasty]] in {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}701.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} Following the [[Meiji Restoration]], [[Imperial Japan]] [[metrication|adopted]] the [[metric system]] and defined the traditional units in metric terms on the basis of a [[prototype metre]] and [[prototype kilogram|kilogram]]. The present values of most [[Korean units|Korean]] and [[Taiwanese units of measurement]] derive from these values as well, owing to their occupations by the Japanese.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

For a time in the early [[20th century]], the traditional, metric, and [[English units|English systems]] were all legal in Japan. Although commerce has since been legally restricted to using the metric system, the old system is still used in some instances. The old measures are common in [[Japanese carpentry|carpentry]] and [[Japanese agriculture|agriculture]], with tools such as [[Japanese chisel|chisel]]s, spatels, saws, and hammers manufactured in ''sun'' and ''bu'' sizes. [[Floorspace]] is expressed in terms of [[tatami mat]]s, and land is sold on the basis of price in ''tsubo''. Many [[rice cooker]]s are sold with measuring cups of 1{{nbsp}}''[[gō (unit)|gō]]''.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

==History==
Customary Japanese units are a local adaption of the [[Chinese units|traditional Chinese system]], which was adopted at a very early date. They were imposed and adjusted at various times by local and imperial statutes. The details of the system have varied over time and location in Japan's history.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

Japan signed the [[Treaty of the Metre]] in 1885, with its terms taking effect in 1886.&lt;ref name=mitsua/&gt; It received its [[prototype metre]] and [[prototype kilogram|kilogram]] from the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] in 1890.&lt;ref name=mitsua/&gt; The next year, a weights and measurements law codified the Japanese system, taking its fundamental units to be the ''shaku'' and ''kan'' and deriving the others from them.&lt;ref name=mitsua/&gt; The law codified the values of the traditional and metric units in terms of one another,&lt;ref name=mitsua/&gt; but retained the traditional units as the formal standard and metric values as secondary.{{sfnp|Lyon|1901|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=yShJAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA933 933]}}

In 1909, [[English units]] were also made legal within the [[Empire of Japan]].&lt;ref name=mitsua/&gt; Following [[Japan in World War I|World War I]], the [[Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce]] established a Committee for Weights and Measures and Industrial Standards, part of whose remit was to investigate which of Japan's three legal systems should be adopted.&lt;ref name=mitsua/&gt; Upon its advice, the Imperial Diet established the metric system as Japan's legal standard, effective 1 July 1924,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution=改正度量衡法規 |contribution-url=http://kindai.da.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/796077 |title=Digital Collections |url=http://dl.ndl.go.jp/?__lang=en |location=Tokyo |publisher=National Diet Library }}. {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; with use of the other systems permitted as a transitional measure.&lt;ref name=mitsua/&gt; The government and "leading industries" were to convert within the next decade, with others following in the decade after that.&lt;ref name=mitsub&gt;{{harvp|Tamano|1971|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dFLL50miMpgC&amp;pg=PA98 98]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Education in Japan|Public education]]—at the time compulsory through [[primary school]]—began to teach the metric system.&lt;ref name=mitsub/&gt; Governmental agencies and the Japanese Weights and Measures Association undertook a gradual course of education and conversion but opposition became vehemently outspoken in the early 1930s. [[Japanese nationalism|Nationalist]]s decried the "foreign" system as harmful to Japanese pride, language, and culture, as well as restrictive to international trade. In 1933, the government pushed the deadline for the conversion of the first group of industries to 1939; the rest of the country was given until 1954.&lt;ref name=mitsub/&gt; Emboldened, the nationalists succeeded in having an Investigating Committee for Weights and Measures Systems established. In 1938, it advised that the government should continue to employ the "Shaku–Kan" system alongside the metric one.&lt;ref name=mitsub/&gt; The next year, the imperial ordinance concerning the transition to the metric system was formally revised, indefinitely exempting real estate and historical objects and treasures from any need for metric conversion. The deadline for compulsory conversion in all other fields was moved back to 31 December 1958.&lt;ref name=mitsub/&gt;

Following [[Surrender of Japan|its defeat]] in [[Pacific War|World War II]], Japan was [[Occupation of Japan|occupied by America]] and saw an expanded use of [[US customary units]]. [[Gasoline]] was sold by the [[gallon]] and [[cloth]] by the [[yard (unit)|yard]].&lt;ref name=mitsuc&gt;{{harvp|Tamano|1971|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dFLL50miMpgC&amp;pg=PA99 99]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Diet revisited the nation's measurements and, with the occupation's approval, promulgated a Measurements Law in June 1951 that reaffirmed its intention to continue Japan's metrication, effective on the first day of 1959.&lt;ref name=mitsuc/&gt; An unofficial and ''ad hoc'' Metric System Promotion Committee was established by interested scholars, public servants, and businessmen in August 1955, undertaking a public awareness campaign and seeking to accomplish as much of the conversion ahead of schedule as possible.&lt;ref name=mitsuc/&gt; Its first success was the conversion of candy sales in Tokyo department stores from the ''momme'' to the gram in September 1956; others followed, with [[NHK]] taking the lead in media use.&lt;ref name=mitsud&gt;{{harvp|Tamano|1971|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dFLL50miMpgC&amp;pg=PA100 100]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the majority of the public now exposed to it since childhood,&lt;ref name=mitsub/&gt; the metric system became the sole legal measurement system in most fields of Japanese life on 1 January 1959.&lt;ref name=mitsua&gt;{{harvp|Tamano|1971|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dFLL50miMpgC&amp;pg=PA97 97]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Redrafting of laws to use metric equivalents had already been accomplished, but conversion of the [[land registry|land registries]] required until 31 March 1966 to complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution=メートル条約 |publisher=International Metrology Cooperation Office |contribution-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722110749/http://www.intermet.jp/metric/ |url=http://www.intermet.jp/en/ |title=''Official site'' |location=Ibaraki |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309141632/http://www.intermet.jp/en/ |archivedate=9 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}. {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mitsud/&gt; Industry transitioned gradually at its own expense, with compliance sometimes being nominal, as in the case of {{convert|1/4|in|adj=on|lk=on}} screws becoming "¼ screws".&lt;ref name=mitsue&gt;{{harvp|Tamano|1971|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dFLL50miMpgC&amp;pg=PA101 101]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the original fines for noncompliance were around [[USD|$]]140 and governmental agencies mostly preferred to wait for voluntary conversion, metric use by December 1959 was estimated at only 85%.&lt;ref name=mitsuf&gt;{{harvp|Tamano|1971|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dFLL50miMpgC&amp;pg=PA102 102]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Since research showed that individual Japanese did not intend to actually use the metric units when given other options, however, sale and verification of devices marked with non-metric units (such as rulers and tape measures noting ''shaku'' and ''sun'') were criminalised after 1961.&lt;ref name=mitsue/&gt; 

Some use of the traditional units continues. Some Japanese describe their weight in terms of ''kan''.&lt;ref name=mitsue/&gt; Homes continue to be reckoned in terms of ''tsubo'', even on the [[Japanese census|national census]] as late as 2005, although the practice was discontinued in 2010.{{fact|date=June 2017}} [[English unit]]s continue to be employed in [[aviation]],&lt;ref name=mitsuf/&gt; [[munitions]],&lt;ref name=mitsuf/&gt; and various sports, including [[golf]] and [[Japanese baseball|baseball]].&lt;ref name=mitsue/&gt;

== Length ==
The base unit of Japanese length is the ''shaku'' based upon the Chinese ''[[chi (unit)|chi]]'', with other units derived from it and changing over time based on its dimensions. The ''chi'' was originally a [[span (unit)|span]] taken from the end of the [[thumb]] to the tip of an outstretched middle finger, but which gradually increased in length to about {{convert|1/3|m|cm|lk=on}}, just a few centimeters longer than the size of a [[US foot|foot]].{{fact|date=June 2018}}

As in China and Korea, Japan employed different ''shaku'' for different purposes. The "carpentry" ''shaku'' ({{lang|ja|{{linktext|曲尺}}}}, ''kanejaku'') was used for construction. It was a little longer in the 19th century prior to its metric redefinition.{{efn|In the 10th lunar month of the 3rd year of [[Meiji period|Meiji]] (around November 1871), the [[Ministry of Railways (Japan)|Railways Ministry]] defined the "[[US foot|English foot]]" as 1 ''shaku'' 4 ''rin'', making the ''shaku'' equivalent to about 0.996{{nbsp}}ft.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=''日本鉄道史 [''Nippon Tetsud&amp;#333;-shi'', ''Japanese Railway History''], Vol. I'' |publisher=Ministry of Railways |location=Tokyo |date=1921 |p=49 }}. {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The "cloth"&lt;ref name=uswd/&gt; or "whale" ''shaku'' ({{lang|ja|{{linktext|鯨尺}}}}, ''kujirajaku''), named for tailors' and fabric merchants' [[baleen]] rulers, was ¼ longer&lt;ref name=uswd/&gt; and used in measuring cloth. (A longer unit of about 25{{nbsp}}cloth ''shaku'' was the ''tan''.)&lt;ref name=uswd/&gt; [[Traditional Japanese clothing]] was reckoned using the "traditional clothing" ''shaku'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|呉服尺}}}}, ''gofukujaku''), about {{frac|5}} longer than the carpentry ''shaku''. The [[Shosoin|Shōsōin]] in [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] has ivory 1-''shaku''{{which?|date=June 2017}} rulers, the {{nihongo|''kōgebachiru-no-shaku''|紅牙撥鏤尺|}}.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

The Japanese ri is now much longer than the [[Li (unit)|Chinese]] or [[Korean li]], comprising 36 ''chō'', 2160 ''ken'',&lt;ref name=reny&gt;{{harvp|Renouard|1845|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=LDxOAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA486 486]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or 12,960{{nbsp}}''shaku''. A still longer unit was formerly standard in [[Ise Province|Ise]] on [[Honshu]] and throughout the [[Saikaidō|9 provinces]] of [[Kyushu]], which comprised 50 ''chō'', 3000 ''ken'',&lt;ref name=reny/&gt; or 18,000{{nbsp}}''shaku''. The [[imperial nautical mile]] of 6080{{nbsp}}[[imperial feet|feet]] (1853.19{{nbsp}}m) was also formerly used by the Japanese in maritime contexts as a "marine ri".&lt;ref name=uswd&gt;{{harvp|USWD|1944|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-s4DDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA400 400]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A fourth and shorter ri of about 600{{nbsp}}m is still evident in some beach names. The "99-Ri" beach at Kujukuri is about 60&amp;nbsp;km. The "7-Ri" beach at Shichiri is 4.2&amp;nbsp;km long.{{fact|date=June 2017}}

The traditional units are still used for construction materials in Japan. For example, plywood is usually manufactured in {{nowrap|182 cm × 91 cm}} (about {{nowrap|72 in × 36 in}}) sheets known in the trade as {{nihongo|''saburokuhan''|3&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;6版|}}, or 3&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;6 ''shaku''. Each sheet is about the size of one [[tatami]] mat. The thicknesses of the sheets, however, are usually measured in millimetres. The names of these units also live in the name of the bamboo flute {{nihongo|[[shakuhachi]]|尺八|}}, literally "shaku eight", which measures one ''shaku'' and eight ''sun'', and the Japanese version of the Tom Thumb story, {{nihongo|[[One-inch boy|Issun Bōshi]]|一寸法師|}}, literally "one ''sun'' boy", as well as in many [[Japanese proverbs]].{{fact|date=June 2018}}

== Area ==
The base unit of Japanese area is the ''[[tsubo]]'', equivalent to a square [[ken (architecture)|ken]] or 36 square ''shaku''. It is twice the size of the ''jō'', the area of the Nagoya [[tatami]] mat. Both units are used informally in discussing real estate [[floorspace]]. Due to [[Taiwan_under_Japanese_rule|historical connections]], the tsubo is still used as the official base unit of [[Taiwanese_units_of_measurement#Area|area in Taiwan]].{{fact|date=June 2018}}

In agricultural contexts, the ''tsubo'' is known as the ''bu''. The larger units remain in common use by Japanese farmers when discussing the sizes of fields.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

== Volume ==
[[File:1 Go.jpg|thumb|A sake cup (1 ''gō '') for celebrations.]]
The base unit of Japanese volume is the ''shō'', although the ''[[gō (unit)|gō]]'' now sees more use since it is reckoned as the appropriate size of a [[serving size|serving]] of rice or [[sake]]. Sake bottles are now marketed as containing 1800{{nbsp}}mL exactly.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

The ''[[koku]]'' is historically important: since it was reckoned as the amount of rice necessary to feed a person for a single year, it was used to compute agricultural output and official salaries.{{fact|date=June 2017}} The ''koku'' of rice was sometimes reckoned as 3000{{nbsp}}"sacks".&lt;ref name=reny/&gt; By the 1940s the shipping ''koku'' was {{frac|10}} of the [[shipping ton]]&lt;ref name=uswd/&gt; of 40 or 42{{nbsp}}[[cubic foot|ft³]] (i.e., {{convert|4|-|4.2|cuft|L|disp=out}}); the ''koku'' of [[timber]] was about 10{{nbsp}}[[cubic foot|ft³]] ({{convert|10|cuft|L|disp=out}});&lt;ref name=uswd/&gt; and the ''koku'' of fish, like many modern [[bushel]]s, was no longer reckoned by volume but computed by weight (40{{nbsp}}''kan'').&lt;ref name=uswd/&gt; The ''shakujime'' of timber was about 12{{nbsp}}[[cubic foot|ft³]] ({{convert|12|cuft|L|disp=out}}) and the ''taba'' about 108{{nbsp}}[[cubic foot|ft³]] ({{convert|108|cuft|L|disp=out}} or {{convert|108|cuft|m3|disp=out}}).&lt;ref name=uswd/&gt;

==Weight==
The base unit of Japanese [[weight]] or [[mass]] is the ''kan'', although the ''momme'' is in more common use. It is a recognized unit in the international [[pearl]] industry.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

The Japanese form of the [[Chinese units of measure|Chinese]] [[tael]] was the ''ryō'' ({{lang|ja|{{linktext|両}}}}).{{efn|The ''ryō'' is sometimes written in English as ryo, without its [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]].{{sfn|''OED''|loc=[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/169267 "ryo, ''n.''"]}} It also appears in English sources as the [[tael]],{{sfn|''OED''|loc=[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/196989 "tael, ''n.''"]}} the ''táīl'', the ''táhil'', and the ''táïl''.&lt;ref name=reny/&gt;}} It was customarily reckoned as around 4 or 10{{nbsp}}momme&lt;ref name=reny/&gt; but, because of its importance as a fundamental unit of the [[silver]] and [[gold]] [[bullion]] used as [[Japanese currency|currency]] in medieval Japan, it varied over time and location from those notional values.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

==English units==
[[English units]]—both [[US units|US]] and [[imperial units|imperial]]—see use in some Japanese contexts. [[US foot|Feet]] and [[inch]]es are used for most non-sport [[bicycle]]s, whose [[tire]] sizes follow a British system; for sizes of [[magnetic tape]] and many pieces of [[computer industry|computer]] hardware; for [[photograph]] sizes; and for the sizes of [[Display device|display screen]]s for electronic devices. Photographic prints, however, are usually rounded to the nearest millimetre and screens are not ''described'' in terms of inches but "type" ({{lang|ja|{{linktext|型}}}}, ''gata''). For instance, a television whose screen has a 17-inch diagonal is described as a "17-type" (17{{lang|ja|{{linktext|型}}}}) and one with a 32-inch [[widescreen]] screen is called a "32-vista-type" (32V{{lang|ja|{{linktext|型}}}}).{{fact|date=June 2018}}

'''Jewish Autonomism''' was a non-[[Zionism|Zionist]] [[Jewish political movements|political movement]] that emerged in [[Eastern Europe]] in the late 19th and early 20th century. One of its major proponents was the historian and activist [[Simon Dubnow]], who also called his ideology [[Folkspartei|folkism]].

[[Image:SimonDubnow.jpg|thumb|150px|Simon Dubnow]]
The Autonomists believed that the future survival of the [[Jews]] as a [[nation]] depends on their spiritual and cultural strength, in developing "spiritual nationhood" and in viability of [[Jewish diaspora]] as long as Jewish communities maintain [[self-rule]], and rejected [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]]. Autonomists often stressed the vitality of modern [[Yiddish]] culture.

Various concepts of the Autonomism were adopted in the platforms of the [[Folkspartei]], the [[Sejmists]] and [[socialist]] Jewish parties such as the [[General Jewish Labor Union|Bund]].

Some groups blended Autonomism with [[Zionism]]: they favored Jewish self-rule in the diaspora until diaspora Jews make [[Aliyah]] to their national homeland in [[Zion]].

The movement's beliefs were similar to those of the [[Austromarxists]], who advocated [[national personal autonomy]] within the multinational [[Austro-Hungarian empire]], and [[cultural pluralism|cultural pluralists]] in America, such as [[Randolph Bourne]] and [[Horace Kallen]].

In 1941, Simon Dubnow was one of thousands of Jews murdered in the [[Rumbula massacre]]. After [[the Holocaust]], the notion of Autonomism practically disappeared from [[Jewish philosophy]].

It is not connected to the contemporary political movement [[autonomism]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17812">'''Land law''' is the form of [[law]] that deals with the [[rights]] to [[usufruct|use]], [[alienation (property law)|alienate]], or [[right to exclude|exclude]] others from [[wikt:land|land]]. In many jurisdictions, these kinds  of [[property]] are referred to as [[real estate]] or [[real property]], as distinct from [[personal property]]. [[Land use]] agreements, including [[renting]], are an important intersection of property and [[contract law]]. [[Encumbrance]] on the land rights of one, such as an [[easement]], may constitute the land rights of another. [[Mineral rights]] and [[water rights]] are closely linked, and often interrelated concepts.

Land rights are such a basic form of law that they develop even where there is no state to enforce them; for example, the [[claim club]]s of the [[American West]] were institutions that arose organically to enforce the system of rules appurtenant to mining. [[Squatting]], the occupation of land without ownership, is a globally ubiquitous phenomenon.

==National sovereignty==
[[Sovereignty]], in [[common law]] jurisdictions, is often referred to as [[absolute title]], [[radical title]], or [[allodial title]].  Nearly all of these jurisdictions have a system of [[land registration]], to record [[fee simple]] interests, and a [[land claim]] process to resolve disputes.

==Land rights==

[[Indigenous land rights]] are recognized by [[international law]], as well as the national legal systems of common law and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries. In common law jurisdictions, the land rights of [[indigenous peoples]] are referred to as [[aboriginal title]]. In [[customary law]] jurisdictions, [[customary land]] is the predominant form of land ownership.

[[Land reform]] refers to government policies that take and/or redistribute land, such as a [[land grant]].

Land rights refer to the inalienable ability of individuals to freely obtain, use, and possess land at their discretion, as long as their activities on the land do not impede on other individuals’ rights.&lt;ref name="Adi, D.N. 2009"&gt;Adi, D.N. (2009). Critical Mass Representation in Uganda. 1-38.&lt;/ref&gt; This is not to be confused with access to land, which allows individuals the use of land in an economic sense (i.e. farming). Instead, land rights address the ownership of land which provides security and increases [[Capability approach|human capabilities]]. When a person only has access to land, they are in constant threat of expulsion depending on the choices of the land owner, which limits financial stability.&lt;ref name="Adi, D.N. 2009" /&gt;

Land rights are an integral part of Land Laws, as they socially enforce groups of individuals’ rights to own land in concurrence with the land laws of a nation. Land Law addresses the legal mandates set forth by a country in regards to land ownership, while land rights refer to the social acceptance of land ownership. [[Landesa]] takes the stance that although the law may advocate for equal access to land, land rights in certain countries and cultures may hinder a group’s right to actually own land.&lt;ref&gt;Hanstad, T. (2010). Secure Land Rights. Landesa.&lt;/ref&gt; Laws are important, but they must be backed up by cultural tradition and social acceptance. Therefore, laws concerning land ownership and land rights of a country must be in agreement.

Globally, there has been an increased focus on land rights, as they are so pertinent to various aspects of development. According to Wickeri and Kalhan, land ownership can be a critical source of capital, financial security, food, water, shelter, and resources.&lt;ref name=Wickeri-Kalhan&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wickeri |first1=Elisabeth |last2=Kalhan |first2=Anil |title=Land Rights Issues in International Human Rights Law |journal=Malaysian Journal on Human Rights |date=2010 |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=16–25 |ssrn=1921447}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN Global Land Tool organisation has found that rural landlessness is a strong predictor of poverty and hunger,&lt;ref&gt;Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions (2009), Housing and Property Restitution for Refugees and Displaced Persons, 3-5.&lt;/ref&gt; and negatively impacts [[Empowerment]] and the realisation of [[Human rights]].&lt;ref&gt;UN Global Land Tool Network (2010) {{cite web |url=http://www.unhabitat.org/content.asp?cid=2798&amp;catid=283&amp;typeid=24&amp;subMenuId=0 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111152637/http://www.unhabitat.org/content.asp?cid=2798&amp;catid=283&amp;typeid=24&amp;subMenuId=0 |archivedate=2012-01-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to home in on this critical problem of inadequate land rights, The [[Millennium Development Goals|Millennium Development Goal 7D]] strives to improve the lives of 100 million slum dwellers.&lt;ref&gt;Millennium Development Goal Monitor: Tracking the Mellennium Development Goals. (2010) http://www.mdgmonitor.org/goal7.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; This includes increased land rights for impoverished people, which will ultimately lead to a higher quality of life.&lt;ref name=Wickeri-Kalhan /&gt;

Although land rights are fundamental in achieving higher standards of living, certain groups of individuals are consistently left out of land ownership provisions. The law may provide access to land, however, cultural barriers and [[poverty trap]]s limit minority groups’ ability to own land.&lt;ref name="Hanstad, T. 2010"&gt;Hanstad, T. (2010). Secure Land Rights. Rural Development Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to reach equality, these groups must obtain adequate land rights that are both socially and legally recognised.

==Land rights and women==
Several scholars argue that women’s lack of sufficient land rights negatively affects their immediate families and the larger community, as well.&lt;ref name="Hanstad, T. 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Agarwal, B. 1988"&gt;Agarwal, B. (1988). “Who Sows? Who Reaps? Women and Land Rights in India” Journal of Peasant Studies. 531-581.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Agarwal, B. 1994"&gt;Agarwal, B. (1994). “A Field of One’s Own: Gender and Land Rights in South Asia”. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; With land ownership, women can develop an income and allocate this income more fairly within the household.&lt;ref name="Agarwal, B. 2005"&gt;Agarwal, B. (2005). “Marital Violence, Human Development, and Women’s Property Status in India” World Development. 823-850.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Deere, C.D. 2006"&gt;Deere, C.D., &amp; Doss, C. R. (2006). “Gender and the Distribution of Wealth in Developing Countries. World Institute for Development Economics Research, 1-27.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tim Hanstad]] claims that providing sufficient land rights for women is beneficial because, once women can exercise those rights the following will be promoted:&lt;ref&gt;Hanstad, T. (2010). Secure Land Rights. Rural Development Institute&lt;/ref&gt;
* Women will be less likely to contract and spread [[HIV/AIDS]] as they do not have to resort to prostitution
* Women will be less likely to be victims of [[Domestic violence]]
* Their children will be more likely to get an education and stay in school longer
* Women will be better positioned to get access to [[Microcredit]]

In many parts of the world, women have access to land in order to farm and cultivate the land; however, there are traditions and cultural norms which bar women from inheriting or purchasing land.&lt;ref name="Hanstad, T. 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Deere, C.D. 2006" /&gt; This puts women in a place of dependence on their husbands, brothers, or fathers for their livelihood and shelter.&lt;ref name="Agarwal, B. 1994" /&gt; Should there be an illness, domestic violence, or death in the family, women would be left landless and unable to either grow crops for food, or rent land for profit. Land ownership for women is a crucial form of security and income, increasing [[Empowerment]] and decreasing [[Poverty]].

===India===
Kanakalatha Mukund makes the important point that although women in [[India]] have the legal right to own land, very few actually do as a result of the [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] practices which dominate the nation.&lt;ref&gt;Mukund, K. (1999). “Women's Property Rights in South India: A Review”. Economic and Political Weekly.&lt;/ref&gt; Up until recently, Indian women have been left out of laws regarding the distribution of public land and were forced to rely on the small possibility of obtaining private land from their families.&lt;ref name="Agarwal, B. 1994" /&gt; [[Inheritance]] laws which cater towards men are one of the key issues behind inequality in land rights. According to [[Bina Agarwal]], land ownership defines social status and political power in the household and in the village, shaping relationships and creating family dynamics.&lt;ref name="Agarwal, B. 1994" /&gt; Therefore, inheritance of land automatically puts men above women both in the household, and in the community. Without political pull in the village, and with limited bargaining powers within the household, women lack the voice to advocate for their own rights.&lt;ref name="Agarwal, B. 1994" /&gt;

Another issue with land rights in India is that they leave women completely dependent on the lives of their husbands. A study by Bina Agarwal found that in [[West Bengal]], prosperous families turn destitute when the male head of the household dies, as women are not permitted to take over their husband’s land.&lt;ref name="Agarwal, B. 1994" /&gt; Also, due to cultural tradition, the higher the status of the woman, the less likely she is to have any developed skills that would be useful in finding work.&lt;ref name="Agarwal, B. 1994" /&gt; These women are forced to beg for food and shelter once their husbands die because they have not been allowed to gain work experience.&lt;ref name="Agarwal, B. 1994" /&gt;

Bina Agarwal argues that land ownership significantly decreases the chance of domestic violence against Indian women.&lt;ref name="Agarwal, B. 2005" /&gt; Owning property elevates women to a higher status within the household, allowing more equality and bargaining power. In addition, owning property separately from their husbands allowed women an opportunity of escape from [[Relational aggression|abusive relationships]].&lt;ref name="Agarwal, B. 2005" /&gt; Agarwal concluded that the prospect of a safe shelter outside of the main household decreases the longevity of domestic violence.&lt;ref name="Agarwal, B. 2005" /&gt;

Land rights are critical for women in India due to the heavily patriarchal society in which they live. Cultural perspectives play a key role in the acceptance of equality within land ownership. Women owning land ultimately benefits the household and society as a whole.&lt;ref name="Agarwal, B. 1988" /&gt;

The most recent advance towards equality in land rights in India was the [[Hindu Succession Act, 1956|Hindu Succession Act of 2005]]. This act aimed to remove the gender discrimination which was present in the [[Hindu Succession Act, 1956]]. In the new amendment, daughters and sons have equal rights to obtain land from their parents.&lt;ref&gt;Hindu Succession Act 2005. September 5, 2005. http://www.hrln.org/admin/issue/subpdf/HSA_Amendment_2005.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This act was both a legally and socially important move for women’s rights to land ownership. Not only did it legally mandate equality in land succession, it also validated women’s roles as equals in society.

===Uganda===
[[Constitution of Uganda|Uganda’s 1995 Constitution]] enforces equality between men and women, including the acquisition and ownership of land.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of Uganda. (1995). http://www.ugandaonlinelawlibrary.com/files/constitution/constitution_1995.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However, research from Women’s Land Link Africa reveals that women remain excluded from land ownership due to customs and deeply ingrained cultural habits.&lt;ref name="Land Link Africa 2010"&gt;Women’s Land Link Africa. (2010). “The Impact of National Land Policy and Land Reform On Women in Uganda”. WLLA. 1-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Even when women save up enough money to purchase land, the land is signed in their husband’s name, while women sign as the witness.&lt;ref name="Land Link Africa 2010" /&gt; [[Inheritance]] practices are a particular obstacle which reduces [[Empowerment|women empowerment]], as well. Land is passed down through male lineage which reinforces women’s exclusion from land ownership.&lt;ref name="cohre.org"&gt;Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions. (2010). “Uganda-Women’s Land Rights: The Gap Between Policy and Practice”. {{cite web |url=http://www.cohre.org/news/press-releases/uganda-women-s-land-rights-the-gap-between-policy-and-practice |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124010924/http://www.cohre.org/news/press-releases/uganda-women-s-land-rights-the-gap-between-policy-and-practice |archivedate=2011-01-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another detriment to equality, pointed out by Women’s Land Link Africa, is that women lack sufficient knowledge about the rights they have under the law to own land.&lt;ref name="Land Link Africa 2010" /&gt; Rural, illiterate women do not even have access to the new constitution which guarantees them land rights.

Although the 1995 Constitution provides for equality between men and women, there are still gaps in the law which affect women’s rights to land. The law protects the rights to land of wives in marriage; however, it does not address the needs of widows or divorcees.&lt;ref name="cohre.org" /&gt; Consequentially, these women are left landless and without the protection land offers. Also, women have a difficult time taking cases to court due to corruption and expensive trials.&lt;ref name="Land Link Africa 2010" /&gt; The trials concerning land take so long to process that many women do not even attempt to seek legal assistance.

Women’s Land Link Africa provides suggestions to alleviate inequality in land ownership. Rural women can be educated about their rights through radio campaigns, community discussions, educational outreach programs, and public forums.&lt;ref name="Land Link Africa 2010" /&gt; The cultural nuances must be addressed in policies and community leaders can be educated about inclusion of minority groups.&lt;ref name="Land Link Africa 2010" /&gt; Also, the law itself can address the rights of widows and divorcees in addition to the rights of married women.&lt;ref name="Land Link Africa 2010" /&gt;

&lt;!--It would be nice to have a "Mechanics of licking" section here, but doing it properly would require more details of the muscles involved than is currently found in the [[Tongue]] article.--&gt;
[[Image:Panthera tigris.jpg|thumb|right|A [[tiger]] grooming its paw by licking]]
'''Licking''' is the action of passing the [[tongue]] over a surface, typically either to deposit [[saliva]] onto the surface, or to collect liquid, food or minerals onto the tongue for [[ingestion]], or to communicate with other animals. Many animals both [[personal grooming|groom]] themselves and [[Eating|eat]] or [[drinking|drink]] by licking.

==In animals==
'''Grooming:'''  Animals commonly clean themselves through licking. In [[mammal]]s, licking helps keep the [[fur]] clean and untangled. The tongues of many mammals have a rough upper surface that acts like a brush when the animal licks its fur. Certain reptiles, such as [[gecko]]s, clean their [[eye]]s by licking them.

Mammals typically lick their offspring clean immediately after [[birth]]; in many species this is necessary to free the newborn from the [[amniotic sac]]. The licking not only cleans and dries the offspring's fur, but also stimulates its [[breath]]ing and [[digestion|digestive]] processes.

[[Image:Colibri-thalassinus-001-edit.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A humming bird licking for nectar]]
'''Food and water acquisition:'''  [[Hummingbird]]s are often said to "sip" nectar, but in fact they '''{{linktext | lap}}''' up nectar on their long tongues. Their tongues have fringed edges, which help both in nectar-eating and in catching tiny insects. Mother hummingbirds also lick their chicks after a rainstorm to dry them by licking water droplets from the coats of the chicks to avoid them chilling.  Many animals drink by licking. While young mammals drink milk from their mothers' teats by [[suction|sucking]], the typical method of drinking for adult mammals involves dipping the tongue repeatedly into water and using it to scoop water into the mouth. This method of drinking relies in part on the water adhering to the surface of the tongue and in part on muscular control of the tongue to form it into a [[spoon]]like shape.{{cn|date=March 2016}}  Cattle, horses and other animals lick rocks, salt licks or other objects to obtain mineral nutrients.

'''Gustation:'''  Animals also use their tongues to enhance their sense of [[olfaction|smell]]. By licking a surface or extending the tongue beyond the mouth, molecules are transferred via the tongue to the olfactory receptors in the [[nose]] and in some animals, to the [[vomeronasal organ]]. In some mammals, the tongue is used to "lick" the air during the [[flehmen]] response to assist transfer of [[pheremones]].  Similarly, snakes use smell to track their prey. They smell by using their [[forked tongue]]s to collect airborne particles, then passing them to the vomeronasal organ. They keep their tongues constantly in motion, sampling particles from the air, ground, and water, analyzing the chemicals found, and determining the presence of prey or predators in the local environment. 

[[Image:Kangaroo licking itself to cool.jpg|thumb|200px|A kangaroo licking its wrists to thermoregulate]]
'''Communication:'''  Dogs and cats use licking both to clean and to show affection among themselves or to humans, typically licking their faces.  Many animals use licking as a submissive or appeasement signal in [[Dominance (ethology)|dominance hierarchies]].

'''Thermoregulation:'''  Some animals use licking to cool themselves.  Cats&lt;ref&gt;Cats and Kittens Magazine, [http://www.petpublishing.com/catkit/faq.shtml#behavior Frequently Asked Cat Questions: Behavior] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060422151206/http://www.petpublishing.com/catkit/faq.shtml#behavior |date=April 22, 2006 }}. URL visited 8 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; do not [[sweating|sweat]] the way humans do and the saliva deposited by licking provides a similar means of [[evaporative cooling]].  Some animals spread saliva over areas of the body with little or no fur to maximise heat loss.  For example, [[kangaroo]]s lick their wrists and [[rat]]s lick their testicles.

'''Mating behavior:'''
Post-[[copulation (zoology)|copulatory]] genital grooming often occurs in male rats and [[prosimian]] primates. This behavior may prevent disease transmission.&lt;ref name="WaalTyack2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Frans B. M.

====In humans====
[[File:Licking a face.jpg|thumb|A woman licks a man's face.]]
Compared to most other mammals, licking has a minor role for [[human]]s. The human tongue is relatively short and inflexible, and is not well adapted for either grooming or drinking. Instead, humans prefer to wash themselves using their hands and drink by [[suction|sucking]] fluid into their mouth. Humans have much less hair over their skin than most other mammals, and much of that hair is in places which they cannot reach with their own mouth. The presence of [[sweat glands]] all over the human body makes licking as a cooling method unnecessary.

Nonetheless, licking does play a role for humans. Even though humans cannot effectively drink water by licking, the human tongue is quite sufficient for licking more [[viscous]] fluids. Some foods are sold in a form intended to be consumed mainly by licking, e.g. [[ice cream]] cones and [[lollipop]]s.

Some people in the [[Afar people|Afar]] tribe of Ethiopia have been reported to have used their tongues to lick other humans, as a way of cleaning them from the dust that accumulates on them in a very water-scarce region.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.africaguide.com/culture/tribes/afar.htm African People &amp; Culture]. africaguide.com.
&lt;/ref&gt;{{not in source|date=June 2017}}

Humans use licking for a number of other purposes. For example, licking can moisten the [[adhesive]] surfaces of [[postage stamp|stamp]]s or [[envelope]]s. Many people lick a fingertip (usually the one of the [[index finger]]) for some extra grip when turning a page, taking a sheet of paper from the top of a pile or opening a plastic bag. In [[sewing]], [[yarn|thread]] ends are commonly wet by licking to make the [[fibre]]s stick together and thus make threading them through the eye of a [[sewing needle|needle]] easier. Another practice considered uncivilized is licking one's hand and using it to groom one's hair.

Humans also use their tongues for [[human sexual activity|sexual]] purposes, such as during [[cunnilingus]], [[anilingus]], [[Foot fetishism|foot licking]], and whilst [[French kiss]]ing, where two people lick each other's tongues.

==Abnormal licking==
[[File:Canine lick granuloma.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Lick granuloma]] on a dog's paw]]
Self-licking can sometimes become abnormally frequent&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cats.about.com/od/obsessiveness/ObsessiveCompulsive_Behavior_Chewing_Licking_FurPulling.htm|title=Obsessive-Compulsive Behavior: Chewing, Licking, Fur-Pulling|publisher=About.Com|accessdate=September 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; occasionally resulting in a [[lick granuloma]].  The most common cause of lick granuloma appears to be psychological, related to stress, anxiety, [[Separation anxiety disorder|separation anxiety]], boredom, or compulsiveness.  Lick granulomae are especially seen in active dogs left alone for long periods of time.  One theory is that excessive licking causes [[endorphin]] release, which reduces pain and makes the dog feel temporarily [[Euphoria|euphoric]].  This provides the animal with positive feedback from the licking, and subsequent addiction to the behaviour.

Animals in captivity sometimes develop a licking [[Stereotypy (non-human)|stereotypy]] during which surfaces (walls, bars, gates, etc.) are repeatedly licked for no apparent reason.  This has been observed in captive giraffes and camels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://circuswatchwa.org/zoochosis.htm |title=Zoochosis |publisher=Circus Watch W.A. |accessdate=September 10, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904045319/http://circuswatchwa.org/zoochosis.htm |archivedate=September  4, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Video of a giraffe licking wall&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 4th, 2018 during the Conference Semi-finals of the 2018 NHL Playoffs, Boston Bruins left winger, Brad Marchand used a full lick of the facial area &lt;ref&gt;https://i.redd.it/th6rns35iyv01.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; as a defensive tactic against Ryan Callahan, right winger for the Tampa Bay Lighting. Although it was an aggressive attempt by the Boston forward, the Tampa Bay Lightning ultimately went on to win the game by a score of 4-3 in overtime to take a 3-1 series lead before heading back to Tampa Bay.

==Vedic background==

In the [[Rig Veda]], [[Soma (drink)|Soma]], the Vedic symbol for deep spiritual truth, is addressed as ''Madhu'', the nector or ambrosia, the drink of Immortality sought by both gods and men. Rishi [[Vamadeva]] has described how the saving of the knowledge of ''Madhu'' or ''Soma'' Doctrine came to him through a hawk in a sudden flash in his darkest hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ancient Indian Education: Brahamanical and Buddhist|author=Radha Kumad Mookerji|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|pages=14, 15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mjFfqpq7HhkC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=Madhu+vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tufYU7uMD4vh8AXC84HoBw&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAThk#v=onepage&amp;q=Madhu%20vidya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed that Rishi Dadhichi had his ''ashrama'' in Dudheshwara on the banks of [[Sabarmati River]] near present-day [[Ahmedabad]]. His name appears in the [[Rig Veda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Spiritual India Handbook|author=Stephen Knapp|publisher=Jaico Publishing|page=504|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=djI5mL2qeocC&amp;pg=PT504&amp;dq=Madhu+vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=muHYU9mnBI3k8AWl44DQCg&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Madhu%20vidya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dadhichi was a sage of Vedic repute (Rig Veda I.84.13: इन्द्रो दधीचो अस्थ भिर्वृत्राण्यप्रतिष्कुतः| जघान नवतीर्नव ||). He was the son of Rishi [[Atharvan]] of the [[Atharvaveda]], and the father of [[Pippalada]] of the [[Prasna Upanishad]]. His name is seen to occur in the first Mandala of the Rig Veda, and in the [[Bhagavata Purana]]. Rishi Kakshivana,the sage of the [[Rig Veda]] [[Sukta]] 119 which is addressed to the [[Ashvins]], in [[Mantra]] 9 tells us :

:उत स्या वां मधुमन्मक्षिकारपन्मदे सोमरयौशिजा हुवन्यति |
:युवं दधीचो मन आ विवास्थोऽथा शिरः प्रति वामश्व्यं वदत् ||

:"The bee desirous of honey sang praise-song for you. Aushij in delight of Soma tells how Dadhichi, told you the secret of his mind after the head of his horse was cured."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rig Veda, The Rise of Aryan Power, Book 1|publisher=The Rise of Aryan Power|page=261|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=HF80jlFPpc4C&amp;pg=PA261&amp;lpg=PA261&amp;dq=dadhichi+rig+veda&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=utgUL0lgfl&amp;sig=8wvJyxOt0REMt0Jv26Uj6cTBo6Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=npnZU9bRDNWRuASi5YGQBQ&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=dadhichi%20rig%20veda&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dadhichi's exposition==

Dadhichi knew the secret of the ''Madhu-vidya''; he held the doctrine of the mutual interdependence of things, because all things are indissolubly connected in and through the Self. As all the spokes are contained between the axle and felly of a wheel, all things and all selves are connected in and through the Supreme Self. Nothing exists that is not covered by the Supreme Self. Thus, he taught the doctrine of the supreme existence of the one, and the apparent existence of the many.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Constructive Survey of upanishadic Philosophy|author=R.D.Ranade|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|page=36|url= http://www.worldcat.org/title/constructive-survey-of-upanishadic-philosophy-being-an-introduction-to-the-thought-of-the-upanishads/oclc/799119712 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dadhichi states that the sun is surely the honey of the gods. Of it, heaven is surely the bent bamboo. The intermediate-space is the hive. The rays are the off-springs. Of that sun, those which are the eastern rays, they themselves are its eastern cells. The ''Rk-mantras'' are verily the bees. The Rig Veda is indeed the flower. Those waters are the nectars. They, which are verily these ''Rk-mantras'' – heated up this Rig Veda. From that which was heated up issued the juice in the form of fame, lustre, vigours of organs, strength, and eatable food. It flowed profusely and settled on a side of the sun. That verily is this, which is the red appearance (aspect) of the sun. Thus, he begins narrating the scheme of colours – red, white and black which are the different colours of the sun, and concludes that the Vedas indeed are the nectars.`&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chandogya Upanishad|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|pages=166–175|url= https://advaitaashrama.org/Book/Search/Author=Swami%20Gambhirananda  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==

''Madhu-vidya'' occupies a unique place in the Upanishadic scheme of ''[[upasana]] '', due to its supremely hidden significance and peculiarly mystic presentation. Chandogya Upanishad takes the Sun as the main symbol and works out the ''vidya'' thereon; Brihadaranyaka Upanishad depicts a long series of cause and effect, showing their mutual interdependence and finally leads to the Atman which is shown to be the supreme source of everything else. [[Adi Shankara|Sankara]] takes ''madhu'' to mean effect, and he also accepts the primary sense of delight. The effects that flow are not mere imaginary things but are actualities that become visualised; every effect takes shape in a particular form or colour which signifies its concretisation and completion but the essence or the honey has no particular form or colour because it happens to be beyond all manifestations; it is recognized by the heaving at the centre of the Sun. Chandogya Upanishad concludes by saying that, to him, who gains this knowledge, there dawns the eternal day. In the case of Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, the search for the essence begins with the earth, the essence of all ''bhutas'' or creatures, the effects of the earth and essence are identical. All physical, moral and psychical principles make up man who in turn produces these principles, beyond man is the composite self of body, mind etc., the producer of all this – this [[Brahman]] is the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]], the very self of the seeker; nothing exists apart from it, everything is of the nature of everything.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Studies in the Upanishads|author=Govindagopal Mukhopadhyaya|publisher=Pilgrim Books|pages=197–203|url= http://www.abebooks.com/Studies-Upanishads-Govindagopal-Mukhopadhyaya-Pilgrims-Publishing/12423632861/bd  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implication==

''Madhu-vidya'' establishes the following five truths:-
:1)	The correspondence and interrelationships between the elements of the external world and the individual beings are analogous to those existing between the honey and the bees.
:2)	There is only one supreme god and that is [[Brahman]]. All the divine powers witnessed in the macrocosm (the external world) and the microcosm (the individual being), are but his manifestations. Brahman behind the cosmic universe is same as the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] underlying the individual self.
:3)	Brahman exists within each and every element of the external universe and also within the individual beings as their essence (''[[Dharma]]'' or law). He is immanent through and through. The idea of transcendent God separate from the external universe and the individual is rejected.
:4)	The eternal laws governing the union of the two fundamental principles – ''Annam'' ('matter') and the ''[[prana]]''  ('life-breath') – and the interaction between the elements of the macrocosm and the microcosm and the evolutions from these interactions and unions are also Brahman.
:5)	Brahman is an integral whole and unity like a wheel; in Brahman are held together all the elements of the external universe, all worlds, all divinities and all breathing creatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=In search of Reality|author=O.N.Krishnan|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=34|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FROVycG3kP8C&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=Madhu+vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YODYU8-0LIHi8AXkx4LYAw&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Madhu%20vidya&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chandogya Upanishad (III.i.1) begins teaching ''Madhu Vidya'' by stating – The Sun is verily honey to the [[Devatas (Vedanta)|Devas]] (''[[Vasu]]s'', ''[[Rudras]]'', ''[[Ādityas|Aditya]]s'', ''[[Maruts]]'' and ''Sadhyas''), the Heaven is like the cross-beam, the intermediate region is the beehive; and the rays are the sons. But, this [[Vidya (Knowledge)|vidya]] does not teach meditation on ''Devas'' but on Brahman who is also known by the names ''Devas'' are known; it is a Brahma-vidya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sacred Books of the Hindus Vol.5, Part 1|publisher=Genesis Publishing|page=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TD2TmogOfdYC&amp;pg=PA145&amp;dq=Madhu+vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YODYU8-0LIHi8AXkx4LYAw&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Madhu%20vidya&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bondage that is experienced as individuals is due to the emphasis on individuality rather than the task, and independently on the cause which is organically connected by the same Atman that is present in both; the essence of the ''Madhu-vidya'' is the cosmic contemplation of the reality of ''[[Prana]]'' within and ''[[Vayu]]'' outside, and the correlation with the Universal Consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gleanings from Rig Veda – When Science Was Reliogion|author=C.S.Moorthy|publisher=Author House|page=134|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=kv86C_pd5-YC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;dq=Madhu+vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YODYU8-0LIHi8AXkx4LYAw&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=Madhu%20vidya&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tantra sadhana==

Transformation of ''[[Jiva]]'' into [[Shiva]] is the goal of ''Tantra sadhana''; ''Jiva'' is Shiva in the state of bondage due to ''[[Saṃskāra|samskaras]]'' whose increase must be halted for attaining release. When a ''sadhaka'' takes initiation he comes to know the art of stopping further increase of ''samskaras''. This art is known as ''Madhu-vidya'' whose practice burns the seed of ''samskaras'' and paves the path for liberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tantra, Its Mystic and Scientific Basis|author=Lalaan Prasad Singh|publisher=Concept Publishing|page=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1pz28mw2zywC&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=Madhu+vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=muHYU9mnBI3k8AWl44DQCg&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Madhu%20vidya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Miniwaste&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miniwaste.eu/?lang=EN#/ Miniwaste website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acrplus.org/miniwaste/ ACR+ - Miniwaste project presentation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110921091134/http://www.acrplus.org/miniwaste |date=2011-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;''' was a European project operated from January 2010 to December 2012, designed to "bring bio-waste back to life". In other words, it was intended to demonstrate that it is possible to significantly reduce the amount of bio-waste at a local level. The project was co-funded by the LIFE+ programme of the European Commission. The project emphasized the efficiency and sustainability of bio-waste reduction actions at source, in particular by organising demonstration actions and trainings for the population, and by offering a better way of evaluating and controlling waste prevention.

==Main goals==

The project endeavors to demonstrate, in accordance with the recent [[Waste Framework Directive]], that it is possible to significantly reduce the amount of organic waste (also called "[[bio-waste]]", covering both food and green waste) at the source in a sustainable way, and to monitor actions for waste reduction in an efficient manner.

The Miniwaste project has four main objectives:
* to gather and share good practices and case studies, which allow to reduce bio-waste and are implemented by European local and regional authorities (for instance, composting);
* to reduce bio-waste in the partner countries (namely France, Portugal and the Czech Republic), by implementing '''demonstration actions''' at different scales;
* to develop and implement monitoring procedures, such as a computerised tool, allowing to assess the quality and the quantity of the compost;
* to disseminate the deliverables and results obtained by the partners, in order to provide guidance for European authorities in terms of bio-waste reduction.

==Partners==

The Miniwaste partners are the local authorities of [[Rennes Métropole]] (project leader, France), [[Brno]] (Czech Republic) and Lipor (urban area of Porto, Portugal), together with [http://www.acrplus.org/ ACR+] (Association of Cities and Regions for Recycling and Sustainable Resource Management) and [[Cemagref]] (a French composting research centre). Within the project, the three local authorities will seek, test and disseminate appropriate tools that will allow implementation and monitoring of actions for organic waste reduction on their territories. The project thus presents a way of integrating demonstrative actions at different scales (from pilot actions to large-scale actions) with different European partners.

==Events==

Apart from setting up a set of communication tools (project website, leaflet, newsletter, final report), two key events will take place in the course of the project:
* A technical workshop, which was held on 12–13 September in Brno (Czech Republic);
* Miniwaste final conference, which will take place on 20–21 November 2012 in Rennes (France).

==Reduction of bio-waste==

[[Bio-waste]] is kitchen waste (raw or cooked food waste) and green waste (garden and park waste). Reducing bio-waste can mainly be obtained by limiting food waste and by practicing collective or individual composting of food and green waste. According to studies, an average European produces between 100&amp;nbsp;kg and 250&amp;nbsp;kg of organic waste per year. 10% of this waste can be avoided by limiting food waste and almost 30 to 70% can be composted, including at source.

The identities of the attackers are unknown. Media outlets published a statement attributed to [[Ansar al-Sharia]], one of the active [[jihadist]] organizations in the country, denies any relation to the incident.&lt;ref name="qaeda"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/03/06/middleeast/yemen-attack-qaeda-denies-link|title=Al Qaeda denies link to attack that killed nuns in Yemen|author=Faith Karimi, CNN|date=6 March 2016|work=CNN|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/world/missing-indian-priest-in-yemen-abducted-by-terrorists-sushma-swaraj/story-hYxUiPYtLFdlfswm7qvdZM.html|title=Missing Indian priest in Yemen abducted by 'terrorists': Sushma Swaraj|work=Hindustantimes|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{See also|Christianity in Yemen}}
Christian presence in [[Yemen]] goes back to the fourth century AD to hold a number of [[Himyarite Kingdom|Himyarites]] believers due to the efforts of [[Theophilos the Indian]]. Currently, there are no official statistics on their numbers, but estimated at between 3,000 and 25,000 people,&lt;ref name="us"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2008/108496.htm|title=Yemen|work=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most of them are refugees or temporary residents.

[[Freedom of worship]], conversion from Islam and establishing facilities dedicated for worship are not recognized in the Constitution or as laws or legal rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/193127.pdf|format=PDF|title=Yemen : Executive summary|website=State.gov|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, [[Wahhabism|Wahabbi]] activities linked to [[Al-Islah (Yemen)|Al-Islah]] were being facilitated, financed and encouraged from multiple fronts including the Ministry of Endowments and Guidance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Shelagh Weir|title=A Tribal Order: Politics and Law in the Mountains of Yemen|date=2009|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=9780292773974|quote=''These activities were encouraged and financed, as elsewhere in Yemen, by the then Wahhabi-controlled Ministry of Religious Guidance (irsha ̄d), by Saudi and Yemeni business figures and by the Yemeni Reform Grouping islah''|page=296}}&lt;/ref&gt; which says that its tasks "to contribute to the development of Islamic awareness and circulation of the publication Education and Islamic morals and consolidation in the life of public and private citizens."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yemen-nic.info/ministations/section.php?SECTION_ID=452|title=وزارة الأوقاف والإرشاد|publisher=|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Missionaries of Charity, founded by [[Mother Teresa]], have worked in Aden since 1992, and the order has three other centers in [[Sana'a]], [[Taiz]] and [[Al Hudaydah|Hodeidah]]. Three Catholic nuns were killed in Hodeidah in 1998, two from India and the third from the Philippines, at the hands of a member of Al-Islah Abdullah al-Nashiri, arguing that they were calling for conversion to [[Christianity]]. In 2002, three Americans were killed in Baptists Hospital at the hands of another Al-Islah member named Abed Abdul Razak Kamel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/205561/too-deep-evan-kohlmann|title=National Review Online|author=Evan Kohlmann|date=17 January 2003|work=National Review Online|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Survivors say that the hospital was "a political football" often raised by Islamists (Al-Islah), who talked about it in mosques and hospital workers describing Hospital workers as "spies". But they emphasized that these opinions are a minority among Yemenis.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/16/world/threats-and-responses-victims-nine-bullets-that-ended-baptists-work-in-yemen.html|title=Nine Bullets That Ended Baptists' Work in Yemen|date=16 January 2003|work=The New York Times|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, a Catholic church in Aden was destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/gunmen-kill-16-at-retirement-home-in-aden-1457094756|title=Gunmen Kill 16 at Yemeni Home for the Elderly|author=Saleh al-Batati in Yemen and Asa Fitch in Dubai|date=6 March 2016|work=WSJ|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the escalation of the Yemeni crisis in March 2015, six priests from [[John Bosco]] remained, and twenty workers of charitable missions in the country, described by [[Pope Francis]] by the courage to fortitude amid war and conflict. He called the [[Apostolic Vicar]] of Southern Arabia to pray for all the oppressed and tortured, expelled from their homes, and killed unjustly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americamagazine.org/issue/catholics-yemen|title=Catholics in Yemen|work=America Magazine|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Missionaries of Charity were not actively engaged in [[Evangelism|evangelization]] according to the testimonies of beneficiaries of its services.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2002/12/30/three-american-missionaries-killed-in-yemen-hospital.html|title=Three American Missionaries Killed in Yemen Hospital|work=Fox News|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attack==
The attack on the house took place at 12:00pm local time, when two armed men had persuaded the guards to let them through the main gate having claimed they were going to visit their elderly mother. Once they entered, they began to shoot randomly, according to Indian officials at the Foreign Ministry.&lt;ref name="indianexpress.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/4-indian-nurses-among-16-dead-in-yemen-gun-attack-govt-verifying-reports|title=Indian nun among 16 killed by gunmen in Yemen; victims handcuffed, shot in the head|date=5 March 2016|work=The Indian Express|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inside the building, nuns were preparing breakfast. Four of the five nuns sensed danger and tried to hide in a convent, where they were shot dead in an open area. All the rooms were stormed and the meeting tent was destroyed, as were statues and crucifixes in the small church. In one picture, two nuns are shown lying on the ground in a dirt yard, after having been shot [[Capital punishment|execution-style]]. The attackers were dressed in a "semi-blue" uniform.&lt;ref name="indianexpress.com"/&gt; According to the [[Catholic News Agency]], the last prayer said by the nuns before they were killed says:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/theres-no-question-the-missionaries-of-charity-died-as-martyrs-52544/|title=There's no question – the Missionaries of Charity in Yemen 'died as martyrs'|work=Catholic News Agency|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|Lord, teach me to be [[Generosity|generous]]. Teach me to serve you as you deserve; to give and not to count the cost, to fight and not to heed the wounds, to toil and not to seek for rest, to labor and not to ask for reward.}}

Sunita Kumar, a spokesman for the charity's mission, described the killers as "demented", adding "there is no other explanation as to why armed people would enter the premises of the home and shoot down innocent, harmless nurses who had dedicated their lives to serving others."&lt;ref name="indianexpress.com"/&gt; Bishop Michael Lewis of the Anglican Church said the compound contained seventy or eighty elderly people, many destitute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anglicannews.org/news/2016/03/prayers-offered-after-killing-of-nuns-in-yemen.aspx|title=Prayers offered after killing of nuns in Yemen|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cardinal Secretary of State]] [[Pietro Parolin]] commented that [[Pope Francis]] prayed that this pointless slaughter will awaken consciences, lead to a change of heart and inspire all parties to lay down their arms and take up the path of dialogue.&lt;ref name="qaeda"/&gt;

Pope Francis described the crime as "satanic", stating that the nuns were "martyrs of today", adding that they were killed by both the attackers, and a "globalization of indifference.". His statement was published, including the following quote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americamagazine.org/content/dispatches/pope-says-four-nuns-were-killed-yemen-their-attackers-and-globalization|title=Pope Francis says nuns killed in Yemen attack are victims of ‘the globalization of indifference’|work=America Magazine|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|In the name of God, he calls upon all parties in the present conflict to renounce violence, and to renew their commitment to the people of Yemen, particularly those most in need, whom the Sisters and their helpers sought to serve.}}

The Missionaries of Charity announced it would continue its work in Yemen despite the violence and danger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/news/headlines/index.cfm?storyid=27700|title=Missionaries of Charity pledge to continue work in Yemen|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Molyneux's problem''' is a [[thought experiment]] in philosophy concerning immediate [[recovery from blindness]]. It was first formulated by [[William Molyneux]], and notably referred to in [[John Locke]]'s ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1689). The problem can be stated in brief, "if a man born blind can feel the differences between [[shape]]s such as [[sphere]]s and [[cube]]s, could he, if given the ability to see, distinguish those objects by sight alone, in reference to the tactile schemata he already possessed?"

==Original correspondence==
The question was originally posed to Locke by philosopher [[William Molyneux]], whose wife was blind:&lt;ref&gt;

Suppose a man born blind, and now adult, and taught by his touch to distinguish between a cube and a sphere of the same metal, and nighly of the same bigness, so as to tell, when he felt one and the other, which is the cube, which is the sphere. Suppose then the cube and the sphere placed on a table, and the blind man made to see: query, Whether by his sight, before he touched them, he could now distinguish and tell which is the globe, which the cube? To which the acute and judicious proposer answers: 'Not. For though he has obtained the experience of how a globe, and how a cube, affects his touch; yet he has not yet attained the experience, that what affects his touch so or so, must affect his sight so or so...'

{{quote|
I shall here insert a problem of that very ingenious and studious promoter of real knowledge, the learned and worthy Mr. Molyneux, which he was pleased to send me in a letter some months since; and it is this:—"Suppose a man born blind, and now adult, and taught by his touch to distinguish between a cube and a sphere of the same metal, and nighly of the same bigness, so as to tell, when he felt one and the other, which is the cube, which the sphere. Suppose then the cube and sphere placed on a table, and the blind man be made to see: quaere, whether by his sight, before he touched them, he could now distinguish and tell which is the globe, which the cube?" To which the acute and judicious proposer answers, "Not. For, though he has obtained the experience of how a globe, how a cube affects his touch, yet he has not yet obtained the experience, that what affects his touch so or so, must affect his sight so or so; or that a protuberant angle in the cube, that pressed his hand unequally, shall appear to his eye as it does in the cube."—'''I agree with this thinking gentleman, whom I am proud to call my friend, in his answer to this problem; and am of opinion that the blind man, at first sight, would not be able with certainty to say which was the globe, which the cube, whilst he only saw them; though he could unerringly name them by his touch, and certainly distinguish them by the difference of their figures felt.''' This I have set down, and leave with my reader, as an occasion for him to consider how much he may be beholden to experience, improvement, and acquired notions, where he thinks he had not the least use of, or help from them. And the rather, because this observing gentleman further adds, that "having, upon the occasion of my book, proposed this to divers very ingenious men, he hardly ever met with one that at first gave the answer to it which he thinks true, till by hearing his reasons they were convinced.
}}

==Responses==
In 1709, in ''A New Theory of Vision'', [[George Berkeley]] also concluded that there was no necessary connection between a tactile world and a sight world—that a connection between them could be established only on the basis of experience. He speculated:
{{quote|
the objects to which he had hitherto used to apply the terms up and down, high and low, were such as only affected or were in some way perceived by touch; but the proper objects of vision make a new set of ideas, perfectly distinct and different from the former, and which can in no sort make themselves perceived by touch|
(sect. 95).
}}

In 1749, [[Denis Diderot]] wrote ''[[Lettre sur les aveugles à l'usage de ceux qui voient|Letter on the blind for the benefit of those who see]]'' as a criticism of our knowledge of ultimate reality.

A similar problem was also addressed earlier in the 12th century by [[Ibn Tufail]] (Abubacer), in his [[philosophical novel]], ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan]]'' (''Philosophus Autodidactus''). His version of the problem, however, dealt mainly with [[color]]s rather than shapes&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad ibn Abd al-Malik [[Ibn Tufayl]] and Léon Gauthier (1981), ''Risalat Hayy ibn Yaqzan'', p. 5, Editions de la Méditerranée:[http://limitedinc.blogspot.com/2007/04/things-about-arabick-influence-on-john.html]

{{quote|
If you want a comparison that will make you clearly grasp the difference between the perception, such as it is understood by that sect [the Sufis] and the perception as others understand it, imagine a person born [[Blindness|blind]], endowed however with a happy natural [[temperament]], with a lively and firm [[intelligence]], a sure [[memory]], a straight sprite, who grew up from the time he was an infant in a city where he never stopped learning, by means of the [[sense]]s he did dispose of, to know the inhabitants individually, the numerous species of beings, living as well as non-living, there, the streets and sidestreets, the houses, the steps, in such a manner as to be able to cross the city without a guide, and to recognize immediately those he met; the colors alone would not be known to him except by the names they bore, and by certain definitions that designated them. Suppose that he had arrived at this point and suddenly, his eyes were opened, he recovered his view, and he crosses the entire city, making a tour of it. He would find no object different from the idea he had made of it; he would encounter nothing he didn’t recognize, he would find the colors conformable to the descriptions of them that had been given to him; and in this there would only be two new important things for him, one the consequence of the other: a clarity, a greater [[brightness]], and a great voluptuousness.

Regarding Molyneux's problem, the authors [[Asif A. Ghazanfar]] &amp; [[Hjalmar K. Turesson]] (2008) have recently noted:
{{quote|
Production of speech is seen as a pure motor act, involving muscles and the neurons controlling them, while perception of speech is seen as purely sensory, involving the ear and the auditory pathway. This parcellation of the systems appear intuitive and clear, but recent studies [beginning with Taine 1870!] ... suggest that such divisions may be fundamentally wrong. Rather than separate processes for motor outputs and individual sensory modalities, adaptive action seems to use all the available context-specific information. That is, neural representations across the brain may be centered on specific actions. This view on neural representations puts 'Molyneux's Problem' in a new light. Unisensory signals are fused into multisensory motor representations unified by an action, but since Molyneux does not suggest any action, his 'problem' may be better viewed as an ill-posed question—at least from a neuroscientific perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Ghazanfar, A. A. &amp; Turesson, H. K. (2008). Speech production: How does a word feel? ''Current Biology'', ''18'',24: R1142–1144.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

One reason that Molyneux's Problem could be posed in the first place is the extreme dearth of human subjects who gain vision after extended congenital blindness.  Alberto Valvo estimated that fewer than twenty cases have been known in the last 1000 years.&lt;ref&gt;Valvo, A. (1971). Sight restoration after long-term blindness: The problems and behavior patterns of visual rehabilitation. New York: American Foundation for the Blind.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ostrovsky, et al.,&lt;ref&gt;Ostrovsky, et al., "Vision following extended congenital blindness", Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences Massachusetts Institute of Technology&lt;/ref&gt; studied a woman who gained sight at the age of 12 when she underwent surgery for dense bilateral congenital cataracts.  They report that the subject could recognize family members by sight six months after surgery, but took up to a year to recognize most household objects purely by sight.

In 2003, [[Pawan Sinha]], a professor at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], set up a program in the framework of the Project Prakash&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projectprakash.org/|title=Project Prakash|website=Project Prakash}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually had the opportunity to find five individuals who satisfied the requirements for an experiment aimed at answering Molyneux's question experimentally.  Prior to treatment, the subjects (aged 8 to 17) were only able to discriminate between light and dark, with two of them also being able to determine the direction of a bright light. The surgical treatments took place between 2007 and 2010, and quickly brought the relevant subject from total congenital blindness to fully seeing.  A carefully designed test was submitted to each subject within the next 48 hours.  Based on its result, the experimenters concluded that the answer, in short, to Molyneux's problem is "no". Although after restoration of sight, the subjects could distinguish between objects visually almost as effectively as they would do by touch alone, they were unable to form the connection between an object perceived using the two different senses. The correlation was barely better than if the subjects had guessed.  They had no innate ability to transfer their tactile shape knowledge to the visual domain.  However, the experimenters could test three of the five subjects on later dates (5 days, 7 days, and 5 months after, respectively) and found that the performance in the touch-to-vision case improved significantly, reaching 80–90%.&lt;ref name=Held2011&gt;

A '''motion chart''' is a dynamic [[bubble chart]] which allows efficient and interactive exploration and visualization of longitudinal multivariate [[Data]].&lt;ref name="Al-Aziz10"&gt;Al-Aziz, J, Christou, N, Dinov, ID. (2010). SOCR Motion Charts: An Efficient, Open-Source, Interactive and Dynamic Applet for Visualizing Longitudinal Multivariate Data, [http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/ JSE], [http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/contents_2010.htm 18(3)], 1-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Motion Charts provide mechanisms for mapping ordinal, nominal and quantitative variables onto time, 2D coordinate axes, size, colors, glyphs and appearance characteristics, which facilitate the interactive display of multidimensional and temporal data.

== Overview ==
In general, [[chart]]s, [[Information graphics|graphs]] and [[plot (graphics)|plot]]s provide the means for summarizing quantitative and qualitative [[data]] using diverse graphical representations. The main limitations of such static types of data exploratory and visualization are the low number of variables that can be shown simultaneously on the chart. Many classical data visualization techniques have limitations in terms of the volume, properties or complexity of the dataset. For instance, [[Scatter plot]]s require bivariate data. Many datasets include multiple measurements like time, space, demographic, phenotypic and functional recording. For instance, the annual [https://web.archive.org/web/20101124060939/http://fhfa.gov/Default.aspx?Page=87 US Housing Price Index] dataset includes dozens of variable including location (State and US region), year, unemployment rate, state population, percent subprime loans, etc.

Motion charts provide a dynamic data visualization paradigm that facilitates the representation and understanding of large and multivariate data. Using the familiar 2D [[Bubble chart]]s, motion Charts enable the display of large multivariate data with thousands of data points and allow for interactive visualization of the data using additional dimensions like time, the size of the blobs, and color) to show different characteristics of the data. 

The central object of a motion chart is a blob (or bubble), which is a solid object [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to a disc. Blobs have 3 important characteristics – size, position and appearance. Using variable mapping, motion charts allow control over the appearance of the blobs at different time points. This mechanism enhances the dynamic appearance of the data in the motion chart and facilitates the visual inspection of associations, patterns and trends in multivariate datasets.

== Examples of motion charts==
There are several web-based motion charts graphical data visualization tools including [[Many-Eyes]], [[Gapminder]], [[Google Motion Charts]], nanobi analytics, [http://www.amcharts.com/inspiration/motion-chart/ motion-chart by amCharts]&lt;ref&gt;Grossenbacher A.

[[Image:Pozytyw i negatyw.jpg|thumb|Color positive picture (A) and negative (B), monochrome positive picture (C) and negative (D)]]

In [[photography]], a '''negative''' is an image, usually on a strip or sheet of transparent plastic film, in which the lightest areas of the photographed subject appear darkest and the darkest areas appear lightest. This reversed order occurs because the extremely light-sensitive chemicals a camera film must use to capture an image quickly enough for ordinary picture-taking are darkened, rather than bleached, by exposure to light and subsequent [[photographic processing]].

In the case of color negatives, the colors are also reversed into their respective [[complementary color]]s. Typical color negatives have an overall dull orange tint due to an automatic color-masking feature that ultimately results in improved color reproduction.

Negatives are normally used to make positive prints on photographic paper by projecting the negative onto the paper with a [[photographic enlarger]] or making a [[contact print]]. The paper is also darkened in proportion to its exposure to light, so a second reversal results which restores light and dark to their normal order.

Negatives were once commonly made [[photographic plate|on a thin sheet of glass]] rather than a plastic film, and [[calotype|some of the earliest negatives]] were made on paper.

It is incorrect to call an image a negative solely because it is on a transparent material. Transparent prints can be made by printing a negative onto special [[release print|positive film]], as is done to make traditional [[motion picture]] film prints for use in theaters. Some films used in cameras are designed to be developed by [[reversal film|reversal processing]], which produces the final positive, instead of a negative, on the original film. Positives on film or glass are known as transparencies or diapositives, and if mounted in small frames designed for use in a [[slide projector]] or [[Slide viewer|magnifying viewer]] they are commonly called slides.

A [[positive (photography)|positive]] image is a normal image. A negative image is a total inversion, in which light areas appear dark and vice versa. A negative color image is additionally [[complementary colors|color-reversed]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rFGT92vh6ZcC&amp;pg=PA340&amp;dq=inverse+complementary+colours&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiwyuGEq6DXAhXDKsAKHWvHDHkQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Adobe Creative Suite 3 Bible|last1=Padova|first1=Ted|last2=Murdock|first2=Kelly L.|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=|isbn=978-0470130674|location=|publication-date=11 February 2008|pages=|accessdate=2 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with red areas appearing cyan, greens appearing magenta, and blues appearing yellow, and vice versa.

Film negatives usually have less contrast, but a wider [[dynamic range#photography|dynamic range]], than the final printed positive images. The contrast typically increases when they are printed onto [[photographic paper]]. When negative film images are brought into the digital realm, their contrast may be adjusted at the time of scanning or, more usually, during subsequent post-processing.

==Negative film==
{{Main|Photographic film}}
[[Image:Filmstrip.jpg|thumb|70px|left|A strip of four color negatives on [[35 mm film]]]]

Film for cameras that use the [[135 film|35 mm still format]] is sold as a long strip of [[photographic emulsion|emulsion]]-coated and perforated [[plastic]] spooled in a light-tight cassette. Before each [[Exposure (photography)|exposure]], a mechanism inside the camera is used to pull an unexposed area of the strip out of the cassette and into position behind the [[camera lens]]. When all exposures have been made the strip is rewound into the cassette. After the film is chemically [[photographic processing|developed]], the strip shows a series of small negative images. It is usually then cut into sections for easier handling. [[Medium format (film)|Medium format]] cameras use [[120 film]], which yields a strip of negatives 60&amp;nbsp;mm wide, and [[Large format (photography)|large format]] cameras capture each image on a single sheet of film which may be as large as 20 x 25&amp;nbsp;cm (8 x 10 inches) or even larger. Each of these photographed images may be referred to as a negative and an entire strip or set of images may be collectively referred to as "the negatives". They are the master images, from which all positive prints will derive, so they are handled and stored with special care.

Many photographic processes create negative images: the chemicals involved react when exposed to light, so that during development they produce deposits of microscopic dark silver particles or colored dyes in proportion to the amount of exposure. However, when a negative image is created from a negative image (just like multiplying two [[negative numbers]] in mathematics) a positive image results. This makes most chemical-based photography a two-step process, which uses [[Color print film|negative film]] and [[C-41 process|ordinary processing]]. Special films and development processes have been devised so that positive images can be created directly on the film; these are called positive, or slide, or (perhaps confusingly) [[reversal film]]s and [[E-6 process|reversal processing]].

Despite the market's evolution away from film, there is still a desire and market for products which allow fine art photographers to produce negatives from digital images for their use in alternative processes such as [[cyanotype]]s, [[gum bichromate]], [[platinum prints]], and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.bespoke.co.uk/press-room?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1921|title=HP Introduces Large Format Photo Negative Application for Fine-art Quality Professional Photo Edition|last=|first=|date=6 July 2010|website=Bespoke News Archive|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
* The 1980s TV show ''[[Tales from the Darkside]]'' opening sequence famously shows various images of a countryside, [[covered bridge]], creek, farm buildings, and [[Betula papyrifera|birch]] trees that flip over to another image of the countryside fading into a negative image. The title appears and then a door in the image opens to reveal the episode.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41356">In [[mathematical logic]], '''New Foundations''' ('''NF''') is an [[axiomatic set theory]], conceived by [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] as a simplification of the [[theory of types]] of ''[[Principia Mathematica]]''. Quine first proposed NF in a 1937 article titled "New Foundations for Mathematical Logic"; hence the name. Much of this entry discusses '''NFU''', an important variant of NF due to Jensen (1969) and exposited in Holmes (1998).&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, Randall, 1998. ''[http://math.boisestate.edu/~holmes/holmes/head.pdf Elementary Set Theory with a Universal Set]''. Academia-Bruylant.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940 and in a revision of 1951 Quine introduced an extension of NF sometimes called "Mathematical Logic" or "ML", that included proper classes  as well as sets.

New Foundations has a universal set, so it is a non-well founded set theory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/quine-nf/ Quine's New Foundations] - Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; That is to say, it is an axiomatic set theory that allows infinite descending chains of membership such as
…&amp;nbsp;x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ x&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ …x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. It avoids Russell's paradox by permitting only stratifiable formulae to be defined using the axiom (schema) of comprehension. For instance x ∈ y is a stratifiable formula, but x ∈ x is not (for details of how this works see below).

==The type theory TST==
The primitive predicates of Russellian unramified typed set theory (TST), a streamlined version of the [[Type theory|theory of types]], are equality (&lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt;) and membership (&lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt;). TST has a linear hierarchy of types: type 0 consists of individuals otherwise undescribed. For each (meta-) natural number ''n'', type ''n''+1 objects are sets of type ''n'' objects; sets of type ''n'' have members of type ''n''-1. Objects connected by identity must have the same type. The following two atomic formulas succinctly describe the typing rules: &lt;math&gt;x^{n} = y^{n}\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x^{n} \in y^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;. (Quinean set theory seeks to eliminate the need for such superscripts.)

The axioms of TST are:
*[[axiom of extensionality|Extensionality]]: sets of the same (positive) type with the same members are equal;
*An axiom schema of [[axiom of separation|comprehension]], namely:
:If &lt;math&gt;\phi(x^n)\!&lt;/math&gt; is a [[well-formed formula|formula]], then the set &lt;math&gt;\{x^n \mid \phi(x^n)\}^{n+1}\!&lt;/math&gt; exists.

:In other words, given any formula &lt;math&gt;\phi(x^n)\!&lt;/math&gt;, the formula &lt;math&gt;\exists A^{n+1} \forall x^n [ x^n \in A^{n+1} \leftrightarrow \phi(x^n) ]&lt;/math&gt; is an axiom where &lt;math&gt;A^{n+1}\!&lt;/math&gt; represents the set &lt;math&gt;\{x^n \mid \phi(x^n)\}^{n+1}\!&lt;/math&gt; and is not free in &lt;math&gt;\phi(x^n)&lt;/math&gt;.

This type theory is much less complicated than the one first set out in the ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', which included types for [[Relation (mathematics)|relations]] whose arguments were not necessarily all of the same type. In 1914, [[Norbert Wiener]] showed how to code the [[ordered pair]] as a set of sets, making it possible to eliminate relation types in favor of the linear hierarchy of sets described here.

== Quinean set theory==

===Axioms and stratification===

The well-formed formulas of New Foundations (NF) are the same as the well-formed formulas of TST, but with the type annotations erased. The axioms of NF are:

*[[Extensionality]]: Two objects with the same elements are the same object;
*A [[axiom of separation|comprehension schema]]: All instances of TST ''Comprehension'' but with type indices dropped (and without introducing new identifications between variables).

By convention, NF's ''[[axiom of separation|Comprehension]]'' schema is stated using the concept of [[stratified formula]] and making no direct reference to types. A formula &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is said to be [[stratified formula|stratified]] if there exists a [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f'' from pieces of syntax to the natural numbers, such that for any atomic subformula &lt;math&gt;x \in y&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; we have ''f''(''y'') = ''f''(''x'') + 1, while for any atomic subformula &lt;math&gt;x=y&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, we have ''f''(''x'') = ''f''(''y''). ''Comprehension'' then becomes:
:&lt;math&gt;\{x \mid \phi \}&lt;/math&gt; exists for each [[stratified formula]] &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;.
Even the indirect reference to types implicit in the notion of [[stratification (mathematics)|stratification]] can be eliminated. [[Theodore Hailperin]] showed in 1944 that ''Comprehension'' is equivalent to a finite conjunction of its instances,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hailperin | first1 = T | year = | title = A set of axioms for logic | url = | journal = [[Journal of Symbolic Logic]] | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 1–19 | doi=10.2307/2267307}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that NF can be finitely axiomatized without any reference to the notion of type.

''Comprehension'' may seem to run afoul of problems similar to those in [[naive set theory]], but this is not the case. For example, the existence of the impossible [[Russell's paradox|Russell class]] &lt;math&gt;\{x \mid x \not\in x\}&lt;/math&gt; is not an axiom of NF, because &lt;math&gt; x \not\in x &lt;/math&gt; cannot be stratified.

=== Ordered pairs===
[[Relation (mathematics)|Relations]] and [[function (mathematics)|functions]] are defined in TST (and in NF and NFU) as sets of [[ordered pair]]s in the usual way. The usual definition of the ordered pair, first proposed by [[Kuratowski]] in 1921, has a serious drawback for NF and related theories: the resulting ordered pair necessarily has a type two higher than the type of its arguments (its left and right [[projection (mathematics)|projection]]s). Hence for purposes of determining stratification, a function is three types higher than the members of its field.

If one can define a pair in such a way that its type is the same type as that of its arguments (resulting in a '''type-level''' ordered pair), then a relation or function is merely one type higher than the type of the members of its field. Hence NF and related theories usually employ [[Willard van Orman Quine|Quine]]'s set-theoretic definition of the 
ordered pair, which yields a [[Ordered pair#Quine-Rosser definition|type-level ordered pair]]. Holmes (1998) takes the ordered pair and its left and right [[projection (mathematics)|projection]]s as primitive. Fortunately, whether the ordered pair is type-level by definition or by assumption (i.e., taken as primitive) usually does not matter.

The existence of a type-level ordered pair implies ''Infinity'', and NFU + ''Infinity'' interprets NFU + "there is a type level ordered pair" (they are not quite the same theory, but the differences are inessential). Conversely, NFU + ''Infinity'' + ''Choice'' proves the existence of a type-level ordered pair.

===Admissibility of useful large sets===
NF (and NFU + ''Infinity'' + ''Choice'', described below and known consistent) allow the construction of two kinds of sets that [[ZFC]] and its proper extensions disallow because they are "too large" (some set theories admit these entities under the heading of [[proper class]]es):
*''The [[universal set]] V''. Because &lt;math&gt;x=x&lt;/math&gt; is a [[stratified formula]], the [[universal set]] ''V'' = {''x'' | ''x=x''} exists by ''Comprehension''. An immediate consequence is that all sets have [[complement (set theory)|complements]], and the entire set-theoretic universe under NF has a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean]] structure.
*''[[cardinal number|Cardinal]] and [[ordinal number|ordinal]] numbers''. In NF (and TST), the set of all sets having ''n'' elements (the [[circular reasoning|circularity]] here is only apparent) exists. Hence [[Frege]]'s definition of the cardinal numbers works in NF and NFU: a cardinal number is an [[equivalence class]] of sets under the [[Relation (mathematics)|relation]] of [[equinumerosity]]: the sets ''A'' and ''B'' are equinumerous if there exists a [[bijection]] between them, in which case we write &lt;math&gt;A \sim B&lt;/math&gt;. Likewise, an ordinal number is an [[equivalence class]] of [[well-ordering|well-ordered]] sets.

==Finite axiomatizability==

New Foundations can be [[Axiom schema#Finite axiomatization|finitely axiomatized]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hailperin | first1 = T | year = | title = A set of axioms for logic | url = | journal = [[Journal of Symbolic Logic]] | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 1–19 | doi=10.2307/2267307}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fenton, Scott, 2015. ''[http://us.metamath.org/nfegif/mmnf.html New Foundations Explorer Home Page]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cartesian closure==
The category whose objects are the sets of NF and whose arrows are the functions between those sets is not [[cartesian closed category|Cartesian closed]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~tf/cartesian-closed.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;; Cartesian closure can be a useful property for a category of sets. Since NF lacks Cartesian closure, not every function [[currying|curries]] as one might intuitively expect, and NF is not a [[topos]].

==The consistency problem and related partial results==
The outstanding problem with NF is that it is not yet verified to be [[equiconsistency|relatively consistent]] to any mainstream mathematical system. NF disproves ''Choice'', and so proves ''Infinity'' (Specker, 1953). But it is also known ([[Ronald Jensen|Jensen]], 1969) that allowing [[urelement]]s (multiple distinct objects lacking members) yields NFU, a theory that is consistent relative to [[Peano arithmetic]]; if Infinity and Choice are added, the resulting theory has the same consistency strength as type theory with infinity or bounded Zermelo set theory. (NFU corresponds to a type theory TSTU, where type 0 has urelements, not just a single empty set.) There are other relatively consistent variants of NF.

NFU is, roughly speaking, weaker than NF because in NF, the power set of the universe is the universe itself, while in NFU, the power set of the universe may be strictly smaller than the universe (the power set of the universe contains only sets, while the universe may contain urelements). In fact, this is necessarily the case in NFU+"Choice".

Specker has shown that NF is [[equiconsistency|equiconsistent]] with TST + ''Amb'', where ''Amb'' is the axiom scheme of '''typical ambiguity''' which asserts &lt;math&gt;\phi \leftrightarrow \phi^+&lt;/math&gt; for any formula &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\phi^+&lt;/math&gt; being the formula obtained by raising every type index in &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; by one. NF is also equiconsistent with the theory TST augmented with a "type shifting automorphism", an operation which raises type by one, mapping each type onto the next higher type, and preserves equality and membership relations (and which cannot be used in instances of ''Comprehension'': it is external to the theory). The same results hold for various fragments of TST in relation to the corresponding fragments of NF.

In the same year (1969) that [[Ronald Jensen|Jensen]] proved NFU consistent, Grishin proved &lt;math&gt;NF_3&lt;/math&gt; consistent. &lt;math&gt;NF_3&lt;/math&gt; is the fragment of NF with full extensionality (no urelements) and those instances of ''Comprehension'' which can be stratified using just three types. This theory is a very awkward medium for mathematics (although there have been attempts to alleviate this awkwardness), largely because there is no obvious definition for an [[ordered pair]]. Despite this awkwardness, &lt;math&gt;NF_3&lt;/math&gt; is very interesting because ''every'' infinite model of TST restricted to three types satisfies ''Amb''. Hence for every such model there is a model of &lt;math&gt;NF_3&lt;/math&gt; with the same theory. This does not hold for four types: &lt;math&gt;NF_4&lt;/math&gt; is the same theory as NF, and we have no idea how to obtain a model of TST with four types in which ''Amb'' holds.

In 1983, Marcel Crabbé proved consistent a system he called NFI, whose axioms are unrestricted extensionality and those instances of ''Comprehension'' in which no variable is assigned a type higher than that of the set asserted to exist. This is a [[impredicative|predicativity]] restriction, though NFI is not a predicative theory: it admits enough impredicativity to define the set of natural numbers (defined as the intersection of all inductive sets; note that the inductive sets quantified over are of the same type as the set of natural numbers being defined). Crabbé also discussed a subtheory of NFI, in which only parameters (free variables) are allowed to have the type of the set asserted to exist by an instance of ''Comprehension''. He called the result "predicative NF" (NFP); it is, of course, doubtful whether any theory with a self-membered universe is truly predicative. Holmes has {{date?}} shown that NFP has the same consistency strength as the predicative theory of types of ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' without the [[Axiom of reducibility]].

Since 2015, several candidate proofs by Randall Holmes of the consistency of NF relative to ZF have been available both on arxiv and on the logician's home page. Holmes demonstrates the equiconsistency of a 'weird' variant of TST, namely TTT&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; - 'tangled type theory with λ-types'  - with NF.  Holmes next shows that TTT&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; is consistent relative to ZFA that is, ZF with atoms but without choice.  Holmes demonstrates this by constructing in ZFA+C that is ZF with atoms and choice, a class model of ZFA which includes 'tangled webs of cardinals' . The candidate proofs are all rather long, but no irrecoverable faults have been identified by the NF community so far.

==How NF(U) avoids the set-theoretic paradoxes==
NF steers clear of the three well-known [[paradox]]es of [[set theory]]. That NFU, a [[Consistency|consistent]] (relative to Peano arithmetic) theory, also avoids the paradoxes may increase one's confidence in this fact.

The ''[[Russell paradox]]'': An easy matter; &lt;math&gt;x \not\in x&lt;/math&gt; is not a stratified formula, so the existence of &lt;math&gt;\{x \mid x \not\in x\}&lt;/math&gt; is not asserted by any instance of ''Comprehension''. Quine said that he constructed NF with this paradox uppermost in mind.

''[[Cantor's paradox]]'' of the largest [[cardinal number]] exploits the application of [[Cantor's theorem]] to the [[universal set]]. [[Cantor's theorem]] says (given ZFC) that the [[power set]] &lt;math&gt;P(A)&lt;/math&gt; of any set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is larger than &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; (there can be no [[Injective function|injection]] (one-to-one map) from &lt;math&gt;P(A)&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;). Now of course there is an [[Injective function|injection]] from &lt;math&gt;P(V)&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the universal set! The resolution requires that one observes that &lt;math&gt;|A| &lt; |P(A)|&lt;/math&gt; makes no sense in the theory of types: the type of &lt;math&gt;P(A)&lt;/math&gt; is one higher than the type of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. The correctly typed version (which is a theorem in the theory of types for essentially the same reasons that the original form of [[Cantor's theorem]] works in [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZF]]) is &lt;math&gt;|P_1(A)| &lt; |P(A)|&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;P_1(A)&lt;/math&gt; is the set of one-element subsets of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. The specific instance of this theorem of interest is &lt;math&gt;|P_1(V)| &lt; |P(V)|&lt;/math&gt;: there are fewer one-element sets than sets (and so fewer one-element sets than general objects, if we are in NFU). The "obvious" [[bijection]] &lt;math&gt;x \mapsto \{x\}&lt;/math&gt; from the universe to the one-element sets is not a set; it is not a set because its definition is unstratified. Note that in all known models of NFU it is the case that &lt;math&gt;|P_1(V)| &lt; |P(V)| &lt;&lt; |V|&lt;/math&gt;; ''Choice'' allows one not only to prove that there are urelements but that there are many cardinals between &lt;math&gt;|P(V)|&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|V|&lt;/math&gt;.

One can now introduce some useful notions. A set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; which satisfies the intuitively appealing &lt;math&gt;|A| = |P_1(A)|&lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''Cantorian''': a Cantorian set satisfies the usual form of [[Cantor's theorem]]. A set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; which satisfies the further condition that &lt;math&gt;(x \mapsto \{x\})\lceil A&lt;/math&gt;, the [[restriction (mathematics)|restriction]] of the [[singleton (mathematics)|singleton]] map to ''A'', is a set is not only Cantorian set but '''strongly Cantorian'''.

The ''[[Burali-Forti paradox]]'' of the largest [[ordinal number]] goes as follows. Define (following [[naive set theory]]) the ordinals as [[equivalence class]]es of [[well-ordering]]s under [[isomorphism]]. There is an obvious natural well-ordering on the ordinals; since it is a well-ordering it belongs to an ordinal &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. It is straightforward to prove (by [[transfinite induction]]) that the order type of the natural order on the ordinals less than a given ordinal &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; itself. But this means that &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is the order type of the ordinals &lt;math&gt; &lt; \Omega &lt;/math&gt; and so is strictly less than the order type of all the ordinals — but the latter is, by definition, &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; itself!

The solution to the paradox in NF(U) starts with the observation that the order type of the natural order on the ordinals less than &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is of a higher type than &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. Hence a type level [[ordered pair]] is two types higher than the type of its arguments and the usual Kuratowski ordered pair four types higher. For any order type &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, we can define an order type &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; one type higher: if &lt;math&gt;W \in \alpha&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;T(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; is the order type of the order &lt;math&gt;W^{\iota} = \{(\{x\},\{y\}) \mid xWy\}&lt;/math&gt;. The triviality of the T operation is only a seeming one; it is easy to show that T is a strictly [[monotonic function|monotone]] (order preserving) operation on the ordinals.

Now the lemma on order types may be restated in a stratified manner: the order type of the natural order on the ordinals &lt;math&gt; &lt; \alpha&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;T^2(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;T^4(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;
depending on which pair is used (we assume the type level pair hereinafter). From this one may deduce that the order type on the ordinals &lt;math&gt; &lt;\Omega &lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;T^2(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;, and thus  &lt;math&gt;T^2(\Omega)&lt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. Hence the T operation is not a function; there cannot be a strictly monotone set map from ordinals to ordinals which sends an ordinal downward! Since T is monotone, we have &lt;math&gt;\Omega &gt; T^2(\Omega) &gt; T^4(\Omega)\ldots&lt;/math&gt;, a "descending sequence" in the ordinals which cannot be a set.

One might assert that this result shows that no model of NF(U) is "standard", since the ordinals in any model of NFU are externally not well-ordered. One need not take a position on this, but can note that it is also a theorem of NFU that any set model of NFU has non-well-ordered "ordinals"; NFU does not conclude that the universe ''V'' is a model of NFU, despite ''V'' being a set, because the membership relation is not a set relation.

For a further development of mathematics in NFU, with a comparison to the development of the same in ZFC, see [[implementation of mathematics in set theory]].

==The system ML (Mathematical Logic) ==

ML is an extension of NF that includes proper classes as well as sets.
The set theory of the 1940 first edition of [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]]'s ''Mathematical Logic'' married NF to the [[proper class]]es of [[Von Neumann-Bernays-Godel set theory|NBG set theory]], and included an axiom schema of unrestricted comprehension for proper classes. However {{harvs|txt|first=J. Barkley|last= Rosser|authorlink=J. Barkley Rosser|year=1942}} proved that the system presented in ''Mathematical Logic'' was subject to the Burali-Forti paradox. This result does not apply to NF. {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Hao Wang (academic)|first=Hao |last=Wang|year=1950}} showed how to amend Quine's axioms for ML so as to avoid this problem, and Quine included the resulting axiomatization in the 1951 second and final edition of ''Mathematical Logic''.

Wang proved that if NF is consistent then so is the revised ML, and also showed that the revised ML can prove the consistency of NF, that is that NF and  the revised ML are equiconsistent.

==Models of NFU==
There is a fairly simple method for producing models of NFU in bulk. Using well-known techniques of [[model theory]], one can construct a nonstandard model of [[Zermelo set theory]] (nothing nearly as strong as full ZFC is needed for the basic technique) on which there is an external automorphism ''j'' (not a set of the model) which moves a [[rank (set theory)|rank]] &lt;math&gt;V_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; of the cumulative [[hierarchy]] of sets. We may suppose without loss of generality that &lt;math&gt;j(\alpha)&lt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. We talk about the [[automorphism]] moving the rank rather than the ordinal because we do not want to assume that every ordinal in the model is the index of a rank.

The domain of the model of NFU will be the nonstandard rank &lt;math&gt;V_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;. The membership relation of the model of NFU will be

*&lt;math&gt;x \in_{NFU} y \equiv_{def} j(x) \in y \wedge y \in V_{j(\alpha)+1}.&lt;/math&gt;

It may now be proved that this actually is a model of NFU. Let &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; be a stratified formula in the language of NFU. Choose an assignment of types to all variables in the formula which witnesses the fact that it is stratified. Choose a natural number ''N'' greater than all types assigned to variables by this stratification.

Expand the formula &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; into a formula &lt;math&gt;\phi_1&lt;/math&gt; in the language of the nonstandard model of [[Zermelo set theory]] with [[automorphism]] ''j'' using the definition of membership in the model of NFU. Application of any power of ''j'' to both sides of an equation or membership statement preserves its [[truth value]] because ''j'' is an automorphism. Make such an application to each [[atomic formula]] in &lt;math&gt;\phi_1&lt;/math&gt; in such a way that each variable ''x'' assigned type ''i'' occurs with exactly &lt;math&gt;N-i&lt;/math&gt; applications of ''j''. This is possible thanks to the form of the atomic membership statements derived from NFU membership statements, and to the formula being stratified. Each quantified sentence &lt;math&gt;(\forall x \in V_{\alpha}.\psi(j^{N-i}(x)))&lt;/math&gt; can be converted to the form &lt;math&gt;(\forall x \in j^{N-i}(V_{\alpha}).\psi(x))&lt;/math&gt; (and similarly for [[existential quantifier]]s). Carry out this transformation everywhere and obtain a formula &lt;math&gt;\phi_2&lt;/math&gt; in which ''j'' is never applied to a bound variable.

Choose any free variable ''y'' in &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; assigned type ''i''. Apply &lt;math&gt;j^{i-N}&lt;/math&gt; uniformly to the entire formula to obtain a formula &lt;math&gt;\phi_3&lt;/math&gt; in which ''y'' appears without any application of ''j''. Now &lt;math&gt;\{y \in V_{\alpha} \mid \phi_3\}&lt;/math&gt; exists (because ''j'' appears applied only to free variables and constants), belongs to &lt;math&gt;V_{\alpha+1}&lt;/math&gt;, and contains exactly those ''y'' which satisfy the original formula
&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; in the model of NFU. &lt;math&gt;j(\{y \in V_{\alpha} \mid \phi_3\})&lt;/math&gt; has this extension in the model of NFU (the application of ''j'' corrects for the different definition of membership in the model of NFU). This establishes that ''Stratified Comprehension'' holds in the model of NFU.

To see that weak ''Extensionality'' holds is straightforward: each nonempty element of &lt;math&gt;V_{j(\alpha)+1}&lt;/math&gt; inherits a unique extension from the nonstandard model, the empty set inherits its usual extension as well, and all other objects are urelements.

The basic idea is that the automorphism ''j'' codes the "power set" &lt;math&gt;V_{\alpha+1}&lt;/math&gt; of our "universe" &lt;math&gt;V_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; into its externally isomorphic copy &lt;math&gt;V_{j(\alpha)+1}&lt;/math&gt; inside our "universe." The remaining objects not coding subsets of the universe are treated as [[urelement]]s.

If &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is a natural number ''n'', one gets a model of NFU which claims that the universe is finite (it is externally infinite, of course). If &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is infinite and the ''[[Axiom of Choice|Choice]]'' holds in the nonstandard model of ZFC, one obtains a model of NFU + ''Infinity'' + ''Choice''.

=== Self-sufficiency of mathematical foundations in NFU ===
For philosophical reasons, it is important to note that it is not necessary to work in [[ZFC]] or any related system to carry out this proof. A common argument against the use of NFU as a foundation for mathematics is that the reasons for relying on it have to do with the intuition that ZFC is correct. It is sufficient to accept TST (in fact TSTU). In outline: take the type theory TSTU (allowing urelements in each positive type) as a metatheory and consider the theory of set models of TSTU in TSTU (these models will be sequences of sets &lt;math&gt;T_i&lt;/math&gt; (all of the same type in the metatheory) with embeddings of each &lt;math&gt;P(T_i)&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;P_1(T_{i+1})&lt;/math&gt; coding embeddings of the power set of &lt;math&gt;T_i&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;T_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; in a type-respecting manner). Given an embedding of &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt; (identifying elements of the base "type" with subsets of the base type), embeddings may be defined from each "type" into its successor in a natural way. This can be generalized to transfinite sequences &lt;math&gt;T_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; with care.

Note that the construction of such sequences of sets is limited by the size of the type in which they are being constructed; this prevents TSTU from proving its own consistency (TSTU + ''Infinity'' can prove the consistency of TSTU; to prove the consistency of TSTU+''Infinity'' one needs a type containing a set of cardinality &lt;math&gt;\beth_{\omega}&lt;/math&gt;, which cannot be proved to exist in TSTU+''Infinity'' without stronger assumptions). Now the same results of model theory can be used to build a model of NFU and verify that it is a model of NFU in much the same way, with the &lt;math&gt;T_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;'s being used in place of &lt;math&gt;V_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; in the usual construction. The final move is to observe that since NFU is consistent, we can drop the use of absolute types in our metatheory, bootstrapping the metatheory from TSTU to NFU.

=== Facts about the automorphism ''j'' ===
The [[automorphism]] ''j'' of a model of this kind is closely related to certain natural operations in NFU. For example, if ''W'' is a [[well-ordering]] in the nonstandard model (we suppose here that we use [[ordered pair|Kuratowski pairs]] so that the coding of functions in the two theories will agree to some extent) which is also a well-ordering in NFU (all well-orderings of NFU are well-orderings in the nonstandard model of Zermelo set theory, but not vice versa, due to the formation of [[urelement]]s in the construction of the model), and ''W'' has type α in NFU, then ''j''(''W'') will be a well-ordering of type ''T''(α) in NFU.

In fact, ''j'' is coded by a function in the model of NFU. The function in the nonstandard model which sends the singleton of any element of &lt;math&gt;V_{j(\alpha)}&lt;/math&gt; to its sole element, becomes in NFU a function which sends each singleton {''x''}, where ''x'' is any object in the universe, to ''j''(''x''). Call this function ''Endo'' and let it have the following properties: ''Endo'' is an [[Injective function|injection]] from the set of singletons into the set of sets, with the property that ''Endo''( {''x''} ) = {''Endo''( {''y''} ) | ''y''∈''x''} for each set ''x''. This function can define a type level "membership" relation on the universe, one reproducing the membership relation of the original nonstandard model.

==Strong axioms of infinity==
In this section the effect is considered of adding various "strong axioms of infinity" to our usual base theory, NFU + ''Infinity'' + ''Choice''. This base theory, known consistent, has the same strength as TST + ''Infinity'', or Zermelo set theory with ''Separation'' restricted to bounded formulas (Mac Lane set theory).

One can add to this base theory strong axioms of infinity familiar from the [[ZFC]] context, such as "there exists an inaccessible cardinal," but it is more natural to consider assertions about Cantorian and strongly Cantorian sets. Such assertions not only bring into being [[large cardinal]]s of the usual sorts, but strengthen the theory on its own terms.

The weakest of the usual strong principles is:

*'''Rosser's Axiom of Counting'''. The set of natural numbers is a strongly Cantorian set.

To see how natural numbers are defined in NFU, see [[set-theoretic definition of natural numbers]]. The original form of this axiom given by Rosser was "the set {''m''|1≤''m''≤''n''} has ''n'' members", for each natural number ''n''. This intuitively obvious assertion is unstratified: what is provable in NFU is "the set {''m''|1≤''m''≤''n''} has &lt;math&gt;T^2(n)&lt;/math&gt; members" (where the ''T'' operation on cardinals is defined by &lt;math&gt;T(|A|) = |P_1(A)|&lt;/math&gt;; this raises the type of a cardinal by one). For any cardinal number (including natural numbers) to assert &lt;math&gt;T(|A|) = |A|&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to asserting that the sets ''A'' of that cardinality are Cantorian (by a usual abuse of language, we refer to such cardinals as "Cantorian cardinals"). It is straightforward to show that the assertion that each natural number is Cantorian is equivalent to the assertion that the set of all natural numbers is strongly Cantorian.

''Counting'' is consistent with NFU, but increases its consistency strength noticeably; not, as one would expect, in the area of arithmetic, but in higher set theory. NFU + ''Infinity'' proves that each &lt;math&gt;\beth_n&lt;/math&gt; exists, but not that &lt;math&gt;\beth_{\omega}&lt;/math&gt; exists; NFU + ''Counting'' (easily) proves ''Infinity'', and further proves the existence of &lt;math&gt;\beth_{\beth_n}&lt;/math&gt; for each n, but not the existence of &lt;math&gt;\beth_{\beth_{\omega}}&lt;/math&gt;. (See [[beth number]]s).

''Counting'' implies immediately that one does not need to assign types to variables restricted to the set &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; of natural numbers for purposes of stratification; it is a theorem that the [[power set]] of a strongly Cantorian set is strongly Cantorian, so it is further not necessary to assign types to variables restricted to any iterated power set of the natural numbers, or to such familiar sets as the set of real numbers, the set of functions from reals to reals, and so forth. The set-theoretical strength of ''Counting'' is less important in practice than the convenience of not having to annotate variables known to have natural number values (or related kinds of values) with singleton brackets, or to apply the ''T'' operation in order to get stratified set definitions.

''Counting'' implies ''Infinity''; each of the axioms below needs to be adjoined to NFU + ''Infinity'' to get the effect of strong variants of ''Infinity''; [[Ali Enayat]] has investigated the strength of some of these axioms in models of NFU + "the universe is finite".

A model of the kind constructed above satisfies ''Counting'' just in case the automorphism ''j'' fixes all natural numbers in the underlying nonstandard model of Zermelo set theory.

The next strong axiom we consider is the

*'''Axiom of strongly Cantorian separation''': For any strongly Cantorian set ''A'' and any formula &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; (not necessarily stratified!) the set {''x''∈''A''|φ} exists.

Immediate consequences include Mathematical Induction for unstratified conditions (which is not a consequence of ''Counting''; many but not all unstratified instances of induction on the natural numbers follow from ''Counting'').

This axiom is surprisingly strong. Unpublished work of [[Robert Solovay]] shows that the consistency strength of the theory NFU* = NFU + ''Counting'' + ''Strongly Cantorian Separation'' is the same as that of Zermelo set theory + &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_2&lt;/math&gt; ''Replacement''.

This axiom holds in a model of the kind constructed above (with ''Choice'') if the ordinals which are fixed by ''j'' and dominate only ordinals fixed by ''j'' in the underlying nonstandard model of Zermelo set theory are standard, and the power set of any such ordinal in the model is also standard. This condition is sufficient but not necessary.

Next is

*'''Axiom of Cantorian Sets''': Every Cantorian set is strongly Cantorian.

This very simple and appealing assertion is extremely strong. Solovay has shown the precise equivalence of the consistency strength of the theory NFUA = NFU + ''Infinity'' + ''Cantorian Sets'' with that of ZFC + a schema asserting the existence of an ''n''-Mahlo cardinal for each concrete natural number ''n''. Ali Enayat has shown that the theory of Cantorian equivalence classes of well-founded extensional relations (which gives a natural picture of an initial segment of the cumulative hierarchy of ZFC) interprets the extension of ZFC with ''n''-Mahlo cardinals directly. A permutation technique can be applied to a model of this theory to give a model in which the hereditarily strongly Cantorian sets with the usual membership relation model the strong extension of ZFC.

This axiom holds in a model of the kind constructed above (with ''Choice'') just in case the ordinals fixed by ''j'' in the underlying nonstandard model of [[ZFC]] are an initial (proper class) segment of the ordinals of the model.

Next consider the

*'''Axiom of Cantorian Separation''': For any Cantorian set A and any formula &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; (not necessarily stratified!) the set {''x''∈''A''|φ} exists.

This combines the effect of the two preceding axioms and is actually even stronger (precisely how is not known). Unstratified mathematical induction enables proving that there are ''n''-Mahlo cardinals for every ''n'', given ''Cantorian Sets'', which gives an extension of [[ZFC]] that is even stronger than the previous one, which only asserts that there are ''n''-Mahlos for each concrete natural number (leaving open the possibility of nonstandard counterexamples).

This axiom will hold in a model of the kind described above if every ordinal fixed by ''j'' is standard, and every [[power set]] of an ordinal fixed by ''j'' is also standard in the underlying model of [[ZFC]]. Again, this condition is sufficient but not necessary.

An ordinal is said to be ''Cantorian'' if it is fixed by ''T'', and ''strongly Cantorian'' if it dominates only Cantorian ordinals (this implies that it is itself Cantorian). In models of the kind constructed above, Cantorian ordinals of NFU correspond to ordinals fixed by ''j'' (they are not the same objects because different definitions of ordinal numbers are used in the two theories).

Equal in strength to ''Cantorian Sets'' is the

*'''Axiom of Large Ordinals''': For each non-Cantorian ordinal &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, there is a natural number ''n'' such that &lt;math&gt;T^n(\Omega) &lt; \alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

Recall that &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is the order type of the natural order on all ordinals. This only implies ''Cantorian Sets'' if we have ''Choice'' (but is at that level of consistency strength in any case). It is remarkable that one can even define &lt;math&gt;T^n(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;: this is the ''n''th term &lt;math&gt;s_n&lt;/math&gt; of any finite sequence of ordinals ''s'' of length ''n'' such that &lt;math&gt;s_0 = \Omega&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;s_{i+1} = T(s_i)&lt;/math&gt; for each appropriate ''i''. This definition is completely unstratified. The uniqueness of &lt;math&gt;T^n(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; can be proved (for those ''n'' for which it exists) and a certain amount of common-sense reasoning about this notion can be carried out, enough to show that ''Large Ordinals'' implies ''Cantorian Sets'' in the presence of ''Choice''. In spite of the knotty formal statement of this axiom, it is a very natural assumption, amounting to making the action of ''T'' on the ordinals as simple as possible.

A model of the kind constructed above will satisfy ''Large Ordinals'', if the ordinals moved by ''j'' are exactly the ordinals which dominate some &lt;math&gt;j^{-i}(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; in the underlying nonstandard model of [[ZFC]].

*'''Axiom of Small Ordinals''': For any formula φ, there is a set ''A'' such that the elements of ''A'' which are strongly Cantorian ordinals are exactly the strongly Cantorian ordinals such that φ.

Solovay has shown the precise equivalence in consistency strength of NFUB = NFU + ''Infinity'' + ''Cantorian Sets'' + ''Small Ordinals'' with [[Morse–Kelley set theory]] plus the assertion that the proper class ordinal (the class of all ordinals) is a [[weakly compact cardinal]]. This is very strong indeed! Moreover, NFUB-, which is NFUB with ''Cantorian Sets'' omitted, is easily seen to have the same strength as NFUB.

A model of the kind constructed above will satisfy this axiom if every collection of ordinals fixed by ''j'' is the intersection of some set of ordinals with the ordinals fixed by ''j'', in the underlying nonstandard model of ZFC.

Even stronger is the theory NFUM = NFU + ''Infinity'' + ''Large Ordinals'' + ''Small Ordinals''. This is equivalent to [[Morse–Kelley set theory]] with a predicate on the classes which is a κ-complete nonprincipal [[ultrafilter]] on the proper class ordinal κ; in effect, this is Morse–Kelley set theory + "the proper class ordinal is a [[measurable cardinal]]"!

The technical details here are not the main point, which is that reasonable and natural (in the context of NFU) assertions turn out to be equivalent in power to very strong axioms of infinity in the [[ZFC]] context. This fact is related to the correlation between the existence of models of NFU, described above and satisfying these axioms, and the existence of models of [[ZFC]] with [[automorphism]]s having special properties.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3802">'''Part–whole theory''' is the name of a loose collection of historical theories, all informal and nearly all unwitting, relating wholes to their parts via inclusion. Part–whole theory has been overtaken by [[mereology]].

[[Metaphysics]], especially [[ontology]], has invoked part–whole concepts ever since [[Aristotle]] founded the subject.

[[Husserl]] (1970) (German original first published in 1901) was the first to consciously elaborate a part–whole theory (on which see Tieszen 1995). However he employed no [[symbolic logic|symbolism]] or logic, even though his doctorate was in mathematics and [[Georg Cantor]] was his friend and colleague; Husserl wrote only for his fellow philosophers.

19th century mathematicians became dimly aware that they were invoking a part–whole theory of sorts only after Cantor and [[Peano]] first articulated [[set theory]]. Before then, mathematicians often confused [[subset|inclusion]] and membership. Grattan-Guinness (2000) appears to have been the first to draw attention to this unwitting part–whole theory.

[[Peano]] was among the first to articulate clearly the distinction between membership in a given set, and being a subset of that set. A subset of a set is usually not also a member of that set. However, the members of a subset are all members of the set. In set theory, a [[singleton (mathematics)|singleton]] cannot be identified with its member. In part–whole theory and mereology, this identification necessarily holds.

The Cantor–[[Peano]] concept of [[set theory|set]] did not become canonical until about 1910, when the first volume of ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' appeared, and right after [[Ernst Zermelo]] proposed the first [[axiomatic set theory|axiomatization of set theory]] in 1908. 

Starting in 1916, and culminating in his 1929 ''[[Process and Reality]]'', [[A. N. Whitehead]] published several books invoking part–whole concepts of varying degrees of formality; see [[Whitehead's point-free geometry]].

Part–whole theory has been superseded by a collection of fully formal theories called [[mereology]], [[Stanislaw Lesniewski]]'s term for a formal part–whole theory he began expositing in 1912. Over the course of the 20th century, a number of Polish logicians and mathematicians contributed to this "Polish mereology." Even though Polish mereology is now only of historical interest, the word "mereology" endures as the name of a collection of [[first order theory|first order theories]] relating parts to their respective wholes. These theories, unlike set theory, can be proved [[sound]] and [[complete (complexity)|complete]].

Nearly all work that has appeared since 1970 under the heading of [[mereology]] descends from the 1940 calculus of individuals of [[Henry Leonard (philosopher)|Henry Leonard]] and [[Nelson Goodman]]. Simons (1987) is a survey of mereology aimed at philosophers.

== Causes ==
Prenatal disabilities are acquired before birth. These may be due to diseases or substances that the mother has been exposed to during [[pregnancy]], embryonic or fetal developmental accidents or [[genetic disorder]]s.

Perinatal disabilities are acquired between some weeks before to up to four weeks after birth in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The free dictionary by Farlex|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/perinatal|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These can be due to prolonged [[Perinatal asphyxia|lack of oxygen]] or obstruction of the respiratory tract, damage to the brain during birth (due to the accidental misuse of [[Forceps in childbirth|forceps]], for example) or the baby being born [[Preterm birth|prematurely]]. These may also be caused due to genetic disorders or accidents.{{cn|date=May 2015}}

Post-natal disabilities are gained after birth. They can be due to accidents, [[injuries]], [[obesity]], [[infection]] or other [[illness]]es. These may also be caused due to genetic disorders.{{cn|date=May 2015}}

== Types ==
Mobility impairment includes physical defects, including upper or lower limb loss or impairment, poor [[manual dexterity]], and damage to one or multiple organs of the body. Disability in mobility can be a congenital or acquired problem or a consequence of disease. People who have a broken skeletal structure also fall into this category.

[[Visual impairment]] is another type of physical impairment. There are hundreds of thousands of people who suffer greatly from minor to various serious vision injuries or impairments. These types of injuries can also result in severe problems or diseases such as blindness and ocular trauma. Some other types of vision impairment include scratched [[cornea]], scratches on the [[sclera]], diabetes-related eye conditions, dry eyes and corneal graft, [[macular degeneration]] in old age and retinal detachment.  

[[Hearing loss]] is a partial or total inability to hear. Deaf and hard of hearing people have a rich culture and benefit from learning sign language for communication purposes.{{cn|date=June 2016}} People who are only partially deaf can sometimes make use of [[hearing aid]]s to improve their hearing ability.

Physical impairment can also be attributed to disorders causing, among others, sleep deficiency, chronic fatigue, chronic pain, and seizures.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28432">'''Positive behavior support''' ('''PBS''') is a behavior management system used to understand what maintains an individual's challenging [[behavior]]. People's inappropriate behaviors are difficult to change because they are functional; they serve a purpose for them. These behaviors are supported by [[reinforcement (psychology)|reinforcement]] in the environment. In the case of students and children, often adults in a child’s environment will reinforce his or her undesired behaviors because the child will receive objects and/or attention because of his behavior. [[Functional behavior assessment]]s (FBAs) clearly describe behaviors, identify the contexts (events, times, and situation) that predict when behavior will and will not occur, and identify consequences that maintain the behavior. They also summarize and create a [[hypothesis]] about the behavior, directly observe the behavior and take data to get a baseline. The positive behavior support process involves goal identification, [[information gathering]], [[hypothesis]] development, support plan design, [[implementation]] and monitoring.

In order for techniques to work in decreasing undesired behavior, they should include: feasibility, desirability, and effectiveness. Strategies are needed that teachers and parents are able and willing to use and that affect the child's ability to participate in community and school activities. Positive behavior support is increasingly being recognized as a strategy that meets these criteria. By changing stimulus and reinforcement in the environment and teaching the child to strengthen deficit skill areas the student's behavior changes in ways that allow him/her to be included in the general education setting. The three areas of deficit skills identified in the article were [[communication skills]], [[social skill]]s, and [[Decision making|self-management]] skills. Re-directive therapy as positive behavior support is especially effective in the parent–child relationship. Where other treatment plans have failed re-directive therapy allows for a positive interaction between parents and children. Positive behavior support is successful in the school setting because it is primarily a teaching method (Swartz, 1999).{{full citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Schools are required to conduct functional behavioral assessment (FBA) and use positive behavior support with students who are identified as [[disabled]] and are at risk for [[expulsion (education)|expulsion]], alternative school placement, or more than 10 days of [[suspension (school punishment)|suspension]]. Even though FBA is required under limited circumstances it is good professional practice to use a problem-solving approach to managing problem behaviors in the school setting (Crone &amp; Horner 2003).&lt;ref&gt;Crone, D. A., &amp; Horner, R. H. (2003). Building positive behavior support systems in schools: Functional behavioral assessment. New York: Guildford Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of Positive Behavior Intervention Supports (PBIS) in schools is widespread (Sugai &amp; Horner, 2002)&lt;ref name="Sugai, G. 2002"&gt;Sugai, G., &amp; Horner, R. H. (2002). The evolution of discipline practices: School-wide positive behavior supports. Child and Family Behavior Therapy, 24, 23-50.&lt;/ref&gt; in part because it is a professional skill in early special education programs (as opposed to Rogerian counseling). The program offers a primary, secondary, and tertiary level of intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Tobin, T.J. and Sugai, G. (2005). Preventing Problem Behaviors: Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Level Prevention Interventions for Young Children. ''Journal of Early and Intensive Behavior Intervention'', 2 (3), 125–144 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; A basic tenet of the PBIS approach includes identifying students in one of three categories based on risk for behavior problems. Once identified, students receive services in one of three categories: primary, secondary, or tertiary. To help practitioners with differences in interventions used at each of the levels the professional literature refers to a three-tiered (levels) model (Stewart, Martella, Marchand-Martella, &amp; Benner, 2005; Sugai, Sprague, Horner &amp; Walker, 2000;&lt;ref name="Sugai, G. 2000"&gt;Sugai, G., Sprague, J.R., Horner, R.H., &amp; Walker, H.M.

Journal of Emo- tional and Behavioral Disorders, 4, 193–256.&lt;/ref&gt; Interventions are specifically developed for each of these levels with the goal of reducing the risk for academic or social failure. These interventions may be behavioral and or academic interventions incorporating scientifically proven forms of instruction such as [[direct instruction]].&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, R.M., Martella, R.C., Marchand-Martella, N.E. and Benner, G.J (2005) Three-Tier Models of Reading and Behavior.

[[Primary prevention]] strategies focus on interventions used on a school-wide basis for all students (Sugai &amp; Horner, 2002).&lt;ref name="Sugai, G. 2002"/&gt; PBS (positive behavioral supports) use for other than a designated population group has neither been approved by the professions or the public-at-large.This level of prevention is considered "primary" because all students are exposed in the same way, and at the same level, to the intervention. The primary prevention level is the largest by number. Approximately 80–85% of students who are not at risk for behavior problems respond in a positive manner to this prevention level.&lt;ref&gt;Mack D. Burke, PhD, Kevin Ayres, MA &amp; Shanna Hagan-Burke, PhD. (2004): Preventing School-Based Antisocial Behaviors with School-Wide Positive Behavioral Support. ''JEIBI'', 1 (1), 66–74 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; Primary prevention strategies include, but are not limited to, using effective teaching practices and curricula, explicitly teaching behavior that is acceptable within the school environment, focusing on ecological arrangement and systems within the school, consistent use of precorrection procedures, using active supervision of common areas, and creating reinforcement systems that are used on a school-wide basis (Lewis, Sugai, &amp; Colvin, 1998;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, T.

Maximizing student learning: The effects of a comprehensive school-based program for preventing problem behaviors. Journal of Emotional &amp; Behavioral Disorders, 10(3), 136-148.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Secondary prevention]] strategies involve students (i.e., 10–15% of the school population) who do not respond to the primary prevention strategies and are at risk for academic failure or behavior problems but are not in need of individual support (Nelson, et al., 2002).{{full citation needed|date=July 2011}} Interventions at the secondary level often are delivered in small groups to maximize time and effort and should be developed with the unique needs of the students within the group. Examples of these interventions include social support such as [[social skills training]] (e.g., explicit instruction in skill-deficit areas, friendship clubs, check in/check out, [[role playing]]) or academic support (i.e., use of research-validated intervention programs and [[tutor]]ing). Additionally, secondary programs could include behavioral support approaches (e.g., simple Functional Behavioral Assessments [FBA], precorrection, self-management training). Even with the heightened support within secondary level interventions, some students (1–7%) will need the additional assistance at the tertiary level (Walker et al., 1996).&lt;ref name="Walker, H. M. 1996"/&gt;

[[Tertiary prevention]] programs focus on students who display persistent patterns of disciplinary problems (Nelson, Benner, Reid, Epstein, &amp; Currin, 2002).&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, J. R., Benner, G., Reid, R., Epstein, M. H., &amp; Currin, D. (2002) The convergent validity of office discipline referrals with the TRF. Journal of Emotional and Behavioral Disorders, 10, 181-189.&lt;/ref&gt;
Tertiary-level programs are also called intensive or individualized interventions and are the most comprehensive and complex.&lt;ref name="baojournal.com"/&gt; The interventions within this level are strength-based in that the complexity and intensity of the intervention plans directly reflect the complexity and intensity of the behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;Tincani, M. (2007). Moving forward: Positive behavior support and applied behavior analysis. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 8, 492–499. [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; Students within the tertiary level continue involvement in primary and secondary intervention programs and receive additional support as well. These supports could include use of full FBA, [[de-escalation]] training for the student, heightened use of natural supports (e.g., family members, friends of the student), and development of a Behavior Intervention Plan (BIP).

Although comprehensive services are important for all students, a critical aspect of the three-tiered model is the identification of students at one of the three levels. One method of identifying students in need of interventions is to analyze office disciplinary referrals (ODR) taken at the school (Irvin et al., 2006).{{full citation needed|date=July 2011}} ODRs may be a means of both identifying students' risk level for [[antisocial behavior]] and school failure (Walker et al., 1996). Researchers have advocated analyzing this naturally occurring data source as a relatively cheap, effective, and ongoing measurement device for PBS programs (Irvin et al., 2006;{{full citation needed|date=July 2011}} Putnam, Luiselli, Handler, &amp; Jefferson, 2003;&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, R.F., Luiselli, J.K., Handler, M.W., &amp; Jefferson, G.L. (2003). Evaluating student discipline practices in a public school through behavioral assessment of office referrals. Behavior Modification, 27, 505–523.&lt;/ref&gt; Sprague et al., 2001;{{full citation needed|date=July 2011}} Sugai et al., 2000;&lt;ref name="Sugai, G. 2000"/&gt; Tidwell, Flannery, &amp; Lewis-Palmer, 2003;&lt;ref&gt;Tidwell, A., Flannery, K.B., &amp; Lewis-Palmer, T. (2003). A description of elementary classroom discipline referral patterns. Preventing School Failure 48(1), 18-26.&lt;/ref&gt; Walker, Cheney, Stage, &amp; Blum, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, B., Cheney, D., Stage, S., &amp; Blum, C. (2005).Schoolwide screening and positive behavior support: Identifying and supporting students at risk of school failure. Journal of Positive Behavior Interventions, 7, 194-204.&lt;/ref&gt;

ODRs have also been shown to be effective in determining where students fall within a three-leveled model (Sugai et al., 2000),&lt;ref name="Sugai, G. 2000"/&gt; developing professional development as well as helping coordinate school efforts with other community agencies (Tobin &amp; Sugai, 1997;{{full citation needed|date=July 2011}} Tobin, Sugai, &amp; Colvin, 2000),&lt;ref&gt;Tobin, T., Sugai, G., Colvin, G., (2000).

NASSP Bulletin, 84(616), 106-117.&lt;/ref&gt; predicting school failure in older grades as well as delinquency (Sprague et al., 2001),{{full citation needed|date=July 2011}} indicating types of behavior resulting in referrals (Putnam et al., 2003),&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, R.F., Luiselli, J.K., Handler, M.W., &amp; Jefferson, G.L. (2003). Evaluating student discipline practices in a public school through behavioral assessment of office referrals. Behavior Modification 27(4), 505-523.&lt;/ref&gt; and determination of the effectiveness of precorrection techniques (Oswald, Safran, &amp; Johanson, 2005).{{full citation needed|date=July 2011}} Analyzing discipline referral data can also help school personnel identify where to improve ecological arrangements within a school and to recognize how to increase active supervision in common areas (Nelson, Martella, &amp; Galand, 1998;{{full citation needed|date=July 2011}} Nelson et al., 2002{{full citation needed|date=July 2011}}). A limitation of only using ODRs to measure behavior problems is that they have been found to be ineffective at measuring internalizing behavior problems such as anxiety, depression, and withdrawal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McIntosh|first1=K.|author2=Campbell, A.

==Functional behavior assessment==
Functional behavior assessment (FBA) emerged from [[applied behavior analysis]]. It is the first step in individual and cornerstone of a Positive Behavior Support plan.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, R.M., Martella, R.C. Marchand-Martella, N.E. &amp; Benner, G.J. (2005). Three-Tier Models of Reading and Behavior. ''Journal of Early and Intensive Behavior Intervention'', 2 (3), 115–124 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; The assessment seeks to describe the behavior and environmental factors and setting events that predict the behavior in order to guide the development of effective support plans. Assessment lays the foundation of PBS. The assessment includes:
* a description of the problem behavior and its general setting of occurrence
* identification of events, times and situations that predict problem behavior
* identification of consequences that maintain behavior
* identification of the motivating function of behavior
* collection of direct observational data
* identification of alternative behavior that could replace the child's problem behavior (i.e., what a typical child does). Often this is measured through direct observation or standardized behavioral assessment instruments.

In some cases, the problem behavior identified in the functional behavior assessment is further analyzed by conducting a behavior chain analysis—in which the sequences of behavior that build up to the problem behavior become the focus.

The results of the assessment help in developing the individualized behavior support plan. This outlines procedures for teaching alternatives to the behavior problems, and redesign of the environment to make the problem behavior irrelevant, inefficient, and ineffective.

Another avenue of functional behavior assessment is growing in popularity—it is called behavior chain analysis. In behavior chain analysis, one looks at the progressive changes of behavior as they lead to problem behavior and then attempts to disrupt this sequence. Whereas FBA is concerned mostly with setting-antecedent-behavior-consequence relations, the behavior chain analysis looks at the progression of behavior, such as first the child may fidget, then he might begin to tease others, then he might start to throw things, and then finally hit another student.

==Behavioral strategies available==
There are many different behavioral strategies that PBS can use to encourage individuals to change their behavior. Some of these strategies are delivered through the consultation process to teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Luiselli, J.K., Putnam, R.F. &amp; Handler, M.W. (2001) Improving Discipline Practices In Public Schools: Description of a Whole-School and District-Wide Model Of Behavior Analysis Consultation. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 2 (1), 18–25 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; The strong part of functional behavior assessment is that it allows interventions to directly address the function (purpose) of a problem behavior. For example, a child who acts out for attention could receive attention for alternative behavior ([[contingency management]]) or the teacher could make an effort to increase the amount of attention throughout the day (satiation). Changes in setting events or antecedents are often preferred by PBS because contingency management often takes more effort. Another tactic especially when dealing with disruptive behavior is to use information from a behavior chain analysis to disrupt the behavioral problem early in the sequence to prevent disruption.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, H., Colvin, J. &amp; Ramsey., E. (1996). Best practices in treating antisocial behavior in schools&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most commonly used approaches are:
* Modifying the environment or routine, using the [[Operant conditioning|three term contingency]], particularly [[antecedent (behavioral psychology)|antecedent]]s (such as [[school curriculum|curriculum]]), behavior, and/or consequences
* Providing an alternative to the undesired behavior (not the same as a reward; it should be an alternative that is readily available to the person. The thought behind this is that the person may, over time, learn to more independently seek out appropriate options rather than the undesired behavior(s)).
* Tactical ignoring of the behavior (also called extinction)
* Distracting the child
* [[Positive reinforcement]] for an appropriate behavior
* Changing expectations and demands placed upon the child
* Teaching the child new skills and behaviors
* Graded extinction and cognitive behavioral therapies (CBTs) such as [[desensitization (psychology)|desensitization]]
* Provide sensory based breaks to promote an optimal level of [[arousal]] and calming for increased use the replacement/alternative behavior
* Changing how people around the child react
* [[Child time-out|Time-out (child)]]
* [[Medication]]

==Behavior management program==
The main keys to developing a [[behavior management]] program include:
* Identifying the specific behaviors to address
* Establishing the goal for change and the steps required to achieve it
* Procedures for recognizing and monitoring changed behavior
* Choosing the appropriate behavioral strategies that will be most effective.

Through the use of effective behavior management at a school-wide level, PBS programs offer an effective method to reduce school crime and violence.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, T.M. Gagnon, J.C., and Nelson, C.M. (2008). School-Wide Systems of Positive Behavior Support: A Framework for Reducing School Crime and Violence. ''Journal of Behavior Analysis of Offender and Victim: Treatment and Prevention'', 1 (3), 259–272.[http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent the most severe forms of problem behaviors, normal social behavior in these programs should be actively taught.&lt;ref&gt;Hawken, L.S. and Johnston, S.J. (2008). Preventing Severe Problem Behavior in Young Children: The Behavior Education Program. ''Journal of Early and Intensive Behavior Intervention'', 4 (3), 599–613. [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequential management/contingency management==
Consequential management is a positive response to challenging behavior. It serves to give the person informed choice and an opportunity to learn. Consequences must be clearly related to the challenging behavior. For example, if a glass of water was thrown and the glass smashed, the consequence (restitution) would be for the person to clean up the mess and replace the glass. These sorts of consequences are consistent with normal social reinforcement contingencies.

Providing choices is very important and staff can set limits by giving alternatives that are related to a behavior they are seeking. It is important that the alternative is stated in a positive way and that words are used which convey that the person has a choice. For example:
* [[Coercive]] approach – "If you don't cut that out you'll have to leave the room."
* Positive approach – "You can watch TV quietly or leave the room."

==Implementation on a school-wide level==
The current trend of positive behavior support (PBS) is to use behavioral techniques to achieve [[cognitive]] [[goal]]s. The use of cognitive ideas becomes more apparent when PBS is used on a school-wide setting. A measurable goal for a school may be to reduce the level of violence, but a main goal might be to create a healthy, respectful, and safe learning, and teaching, environment.&lt;ref name="(Miller, Nickerson, &amp; Jimerson, 2009)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gilman|first1=Rich |first2= E. Scott |last2=Huebner|first3= Michael J.|last3=Furlong|title=Handbook of Positive Psychology in Schools|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn= 978-1107030749}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=9780805863628|author=Miller, David N.|author2=Nickerson, Amanda B.|author3=Jimerson, Shane R.|last-author-amp=yes|edition=1st|title=Positive Psychology and School-Based Interventions|pages=293–299}}&lt;/ref&gt; PBS on a school-wide level is a system that can be used to create the "perfect" school, or at the very least a better school, particularly because before implementation it is necessary to develop a vision for what the school environment should look like in the future.&lt;ref name="Rhodes, V., Stevens, D., &amp; Hemmings, A., (2011)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rhodes|first1=Virginia|author2=Stevens, Douglas|author3=Hemmings, Annette|last-author-amp=yes|title=Creating Positive Culture in a New Urban High School|journal=High School Journal|date=15 April 2011|volume=94|series=Spring 2011|issue=3|pages=82–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Horner et al. (2004), a colleague of Julie Ann Racino [[supported living]], [[family support]], [[community integration]], as cited in (Miller, Nickerson, &amp; Jimerson, 2009),&lt;ref name="(Miller, Nickerson, &amp; Jimerson, 2009)" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Furlong|first1=edited by Rich Gilman, E. Scott Huebner, Michael J.|title=Handbook of positive psychology in schools|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=9780805863628|author2=Miller, David N.|edition=1st|authorlink=Positive Psychology and School-Based Interventions|author3=Nickerson, Amanda B. and Jimerson, Shane R.|page=297}}&lt;/ref&gt; once a school decides to implement PBS, the following characteristics require addressing:

# define 3 to 5 school-wide expectations for appropriate behavior;
# actively teach the school-wide behavioral expectations to all students; 
# monitor and acknowledge students for engaging in behavioral expectations;
# correct problem behaviors using a consistently administered continuum of behavioral consequences
# gather and use information about student behavior to evaluate and guide decision making;
# obtain leadership of school-wide practices from an administrator committed to providing adequate support and resources; and
# procure [[school district|district-level]] support.

If adequate support and consistency using a positive behavior support program exists, then over time a school’s atmosphere will change for the better. PBS is capable of creating positive changes so pronounced that alumni would mention the differences upon a visit to the school. Such a program is able to create a positive atmosphere and culture in almost any school, but the support, resources, and consistency in using the program over time must be present.&lt;ref name="Rhodes, V., Stevens, D., &amp; Hemmings, A., (2011)"/&gt;

School-wide Positive behavior support (SW-PBS) consists of a broad range of systematic and individualized strategies for achieving important social and [[learning outcomes]] while preventing problem behavior with all students.&lt;ref&gt;OSEP Center on Positive Interventions and Support, [http://www.osepideasthatwork.org/toolkit/behvr_pos.asp "School-wide positive behavior support implementers’ blueprint and self-assessment"], 2004, April&lt;/ref&gt;

Such school-wide use of PBS has not been approved other than for special populations, and the work of Dr. Robert Horner, a leader of a Rehabilitation Research and Training Center on Positive Behavioral Supports, was approved on the basis of non-use of aversive technology (e.g., restraints, electric shock, transfers to criminal justice) with any students, including individuals in the most restrictive placements.&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J.

A '''power law''' is a mathematical relationship between two quantities in which one is directly proportional to some power of the other. The '''power law for cache misses''' was first established by C. K. Chow in his 1974 paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=May 1974|title=On Optimization of Storage Hierarchies|journal=IBM Journal of Research and Development|volume=18|issue=3|pages=194–203|doi=10.1147/rd.183.0194|last1=Chow|first1=C. K.}}&lt;/ref&gt; supported by experimental data on hit ratios for stack processing by [[Richard Mattson]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=December 1971|title=Evaluation of multilevel memories|journal=IEEE Transactions on Magnetics|volume=7|issue=4|pages=814–819|doi=10.1109/TMAG.1971.1067237|last1=Mattson|first1=R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The power law of cache misses can be used to narrow down the cache sizes to practical ranges, given a tolerable miss rate, as one of the early steps while designing the [[cache hierarchy]] for a uniprocessor system.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Fundamentals of Parallel Multicore Architecture|publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall|isbn=978-1482211184|last1=Solihin|first1=Yan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The power law for cache misses can be stated as

: &lt;math&gt;M = M_0 C^{-\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''M'' is the miss rate for a cache of size ''C'' and ''M''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the miss rate of a baseline cache. The exponent ''α'' is workload-specific and typically ranges from 0.3 to 0.7.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hartstein|first=A.|last2=Srinivasan|first2=V.|last3=Puzak|first3=T. R.|last4=Emma|first4=P. G.|date=2006-01-01|title=Cache Miss Behavior: Is It √2?|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1128022.1128064|journal=Proceedings of the 3rd Conference on Computing Frontiers|series=CF '06|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=313–320|doi=10.1145/1128022.1128064|isbn=1595933026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Caveats ==
The power law can only give an estimate of the miss rate only up to a certain value of cache size. A large enough cache eliminates capacity misses and increasing the cache size further will not reduce the miss rate any further, contrary to the power law's prediction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The validity of the power law of cache misses also depends on the size of working memory set in a given process and also on the temporal re-reference pattern of cache blocks in a process. If a process has a small working memory set relative to the cache size, capacity misses are unlikely and the power law does not hold.

Although conflict misses reduce as associativity increases, Hartstein et al.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; showed that the power law holds irrespective of set associativity.

Hartstein et al. plotted the number of cache block re-accesses versus their re-reference times for a large number of workloads and found that most also follow an exponential relationship.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;R(t) = R_0 t^{-\beta}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''R''(''t'') is the rate of re-referencing. It was found that the exponent ''β'' ranged between 1.7 and 1.3. Theoretically, it was proved that the power laws of cache re-reference and cache miss rate are related by the equation &lt;math&gt;\alpha = 1-\beta&lt;/math&gt;. This means that for workloads that do not follow the re-reference power law, the power law of cache misses does not hold true.

== Multilevel cache hierarchy ==
In a multilevel cache hierarchy, the miss pattern of the higher level cache becomes the re-reference pattern of the immediate lower level cache. Hartstein et al.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; found that whereas the cache misses for lower levels do not follow a strict power law, as long as the lower level cache is considerably larger than the higher level cache, the miss rate function can be approximated to the power law.

In [[mathematics]], '''racks''' and '''quandles''' are sets with [[binary operation]]s satisfying axioms analogous to the [[Reidemeister move]]s used to manipulate [[knot theory|knot]] diagrams.

While mainly used to obtain invariants of knots, they can be viewed as [[abstract algebra|algebraic]] constructions in their own right.  In particular, the definition of a quandle axiomatizes the properties of [[Inner automorphism|conjugation]] in a [[Group (mathematics)|group]].

==History==
In 1943, Mituhisa Takasaki (高崎光久) introduced an algebraic structure which he called a ''Kei'' (圭), which would later come to be known as an involutive quandle.&lt;ref name="takasaki"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Mituhisa |last=Takasaki| title=Abstractions of symmetric functions|year=1943|journal=[[Tohoku Mathematical Journal]]|volume=49|pages=143&amp;ndash;207}}&lt;/ref&gt; His motivation was to find a nonassociative algebraic structure to capture the notion of a [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] in the context of [[finite geometry]]. The idea was rediscovered and generalized in (unpublished) 1959 correspondence between [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]] and [[Gavin Wraith]],&lt;ref name="cw"&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=John H.|last1=Conway|first2=Gavin|last2=Wraith|title=(unpublished correspondence)|year=1959|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; who at the time were undergraduate students at the [[University of Cambridge]]. It is here that the modern definitions of quandles and of racks first appear. Wraith had become interested in these structures (which he initially dubbed '''sequentials''') while at school.&lt;ref name="wraith"&gt;{{cite web|first=Gavin|last=Wraith|title=A Personal Story about Knots|url=http://www.wra1th.plus.com/gcw/rants/math/Rack.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060313115547/http://www.wra1th.plus.com/gcw/rants/math/Rack.html|archivedate=2006-03-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Conway renamed them '''wracks''', partly as a pun on his colleague's name, and partly because they arise as the remnants (or 'wrack and ruin') of a [[group (mathematics)|group]] when one discards the multiplicative structure and considers only the [[inner automorphism|conjugation]] structure.  The spelling 'rack' has now become prevalent.

These constructs surfaced again in the 1980s:  in a 1982 paper by [[David E. Joyce (mathematician)|David Joyce]]&lt;ref name="joyce"&gt;{{cite journal|first=David|last=Joyce|title=''A classifying invariant of knots: the knot quandle''|journal=[[Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra]]|volume=23|year=1982|pages=37&amp;ndash;65|doi=10.1016/0022-4049(82)90077-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; (where the term '''quandle''' was coined),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baez|first1=John|title=The Origin of the word 'Quandle'|url=https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2015/05/the_origin_of_the_word_quandle.html|website=The n-Category Cafe|accessdate=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a 1982 paper by [[:ru:Сергей Матвеев|Sergei Matveev]] (under the name '''distributive groupoids''')&lt;ref name="matveev"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Sergei|last=Matveev|title=''Distributive groupoids in knot theory''|journal=[[Math.

==Racks==
A '''rack''' may be defined as a set &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathrm{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; with a binary operation &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \triangleleft&lt;/math&gt; such that for every &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle a,\, b,\, c \;\in\; \mathrm{R}&lt;/math&gt; the '''self-distributive law''' holds:
:&lt;math&gt;a \triangleleft(b \triangleleft c) = (a  \triangleleft b) \triangleleft(a  \triangleleft c)&lt;/math&gt;

and for every &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle a,\, b \;\in\; \mathrm{R}&lt;/math&gt; there exists a unique &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle c \;\in\; \mathrm{R}&lt;/math&gt; such that 
:&lt;math&gt;a \triangleleft c = b&lt;/math&gt;

This definition, while terse and commonly used, is suboptimal for certain purposes because it contains an existential quantifier which is not really necessary. To avoid this, we may write the unique &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle c \;\in\; \mathrm{R}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle a \, \triangleleft\, c \;=\; b&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle b \,\triangleright\, a&lt;/math&gt;.  We then have
:&lt;math&gt; a \triangleleft c = b \iff c = b \triangleright a &lt;/math&gt;

and thus 
:&lt;math&gt; a \triangleleft(b \triangleright a) = b&lt;/math&gt;

and
:&lt;math&gt;(a \triangleleft b) \triangleright a = b&lt;/math&gt;

Using this idea, a rack may be equivalently defined as a set &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathrm{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; with two binary operations &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \triangleleft &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \triangleright &lt;/math&gt; such that for all  &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle a,\, b,\, c \;\in\; \mathrm{R}&lt;/math&gt;:
#&lt;math&gt;a \triangleleft(b \triangleleft c) =  (a \triangleleft b) \triangleleft(a \triangleleft c)&lt;/math&gt; (left self-distributive law) 
#&lt;math&gt;(c \triangleright b) \triangleright a = (c \triangleright a) \triangleright(b \triangleright a)&lt;/math&gt; (right self-distributive law) 
#&lt;math&gt;(a \triangleleft b) \triangleright a = b&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;a \triangleleft(b \triangleright a) = b&lt;/math&gt;

It is convenient to say that the element &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle a \;\in\; \mathrm{R}&lt;/math&gt; is acting from the left in the expression &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle a \, \triangleleft\, b&lt;/math&gt;, and acting from the right in the expression &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle b \, \triangleright\, a&lt;/math&gt;.  The third and fourth rack axioms then say that these left and right actions are inverses of each other.  Using this, we can eliminate either one of these actions from the definition of rack.  If we eliminate the right action and keep the left one, we obtain the terse definition given initially.

Many different conventions are used in the literature on racks and quandles.  For example, many authors prefer to work with just the ''right'' action.  Furthermore, the use of the symbols &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \triangleleft &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \triangleright &lt;/math&gt; is by no means universal: many authors use exponential notation
:&lt;math&gt;a \triangleleft b = {}^a b&lt;/math&gt;

and
:&lt;math&gt;b \triangleright a = b^{a}&lt;/math&gt;

while many others write
:&lt;math&gt;b \triangleright a = b \star a &lt;/math&gt;

Yet another equivalent definition of a rack is that it is a set where each element acts on the left and right as [[automorphism]]s of the rack, with the left action being the inverse of the right one.  In this definition, the fact that each element acts as automorphisms encodes the left and right self-distributivity laws, and also these laws:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  a \triangleleft(b \triangleright c) &amp;= (a \triangleleft b) \triangleright(a\ \triangleleft c) \\
  (c \triangleleft b) \triangleright a &amp;= (c \triangleright a) \triangleleft(b \triangleright a)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

which are consequences of the definition(s) given earlier.

==Quandles==
A '''quandle''' is defined as a rack, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathrm{Q}\,&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \forall a \;\in\; \mathrm{Q}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;a \triangleleft a = a&lt;/math&gt;

or equivalently
: &lt;math&gt;a \triangleright a = a&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples and applications==
Every group gives a quandle where the operations come from conjugation:
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  a \triangleleft b &amp;= a b a^{-1} \\
   b \triangleright a &amp;= a^{-1} b a \\
                     &amp;= a^{-1} \triangleleft b
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

In fact, every equational law satisfied by [[inner automorphism|conjugation]] in a group follows from the quandle axioms.  So, one can think of a quandle as what is left of a group when we forget multiplication, the identity, and inverses, and only remember the operation of conjugation.

Every [[tame knot]] in [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] [[Euclidean space]] has a 'fundamental quandle'.  To define this, one can note that the [[fundamental group]] of the knot complement, or [[knot group]], has a presentation (the [[Wirtinger presentation]]) in which the relations only involve conjugation.  So, this presentation can also be used as a presentation of a quandle.  The fundamental quandle is a very powerful invariant of knots.  In particular, if two knots have [[isomorphic]] fundamental quandles then there is a [[homeomorphism]] of three-dimensional Euclidean space, which may be [[orientation reversing]], taking one knot to the other.

Less powerful but more easily computable invariants of knots may be obtained by counting the homomorphisms from the knot quandle to a fixed quandle &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathrm{Q}\,&lt;/math&gt;.  Since the Wirtinger presentation has one generator for each strand in a [[knot diagram]], these invariants can be computed by counting ways of labelling each strand by an element of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathrm{Q}\,&lt;/math&gt;, subject to certain constraints.  More sophisticated invariants of this sort can be constructed with the help of quandle [[cohomology]].

The Alexander quandles are also important, since they can be used to compute the [[Alexander polynomial]] of a knot.  Let &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathrm{A}&lt;/math&gt; be a module over the ring  &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathbb{Z}\left[t,\, t^{-1}\right]&lt;/math&gt; of [[Laurent polynomial]]s in one variable. Then the '''Alexander quandle''' is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathrm{A}&lt;/math&gt; made into a quandle with the left action given by
:&lt;math&gt;a \triangleleft b = tb + (1 - t)a &lt;/math&gt;

Racks are a useful generalization of quandles in topology, since while quandles can represent knots on a round linear object (such as rope or a thread), racks can represent ribbons, which may be twisted as well as knotted.

A quandle &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathrm{Q}&lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''involutory''' if for all &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle a,\, b \;\in\; \mathrm{Q}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; a \triangleleft(a \triangleleft b) = b &lt;/math&gt;

or equivalently
: &lt;math&gt; (b \triangleright a) \triangleright a = b &lt;/math&gt;

Any [[Riemannian symmetric space|symmetric space]] gives an involutory quandle, where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle a \, \triangleleft\, b&lt;/math&gt; is the result of 'reflecting &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle b&lt;/math&gt; through &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle a&lt;/math&gt;'.

'''Reactive transport modeling in porous media''' refers to the creation of [[computer models]] integrating [[chemical reaction]] with [[Transport phenomena|transport]] of fluids through the Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]]. Such models predict the distribution in space and time of the chemical reactions that occur along a flowpath. Reactive transport modeling in general can refer to many other processes, including reactive flow of chemicals through tanks, reactors, or membranes; particles and species in the atmosphere; gases exiting a smokestack; and migrating magma.

== Overview ==
Reactive transport models are constructed to understand the composition of natural waters; the origin of [[Ore|economic mineral deposits]]; the formation and dissolution of rocks and [[minerals]] in geologic formations in response to injection of industrial wastes, steam, or [[carbon dioxide]]; and the generation of acidic waters and leaching of [[Heavy metals|metals]] from [[Environmental impact of mining|mine wastes]]. They are often relied upon to predict the migration of contaminant plumes; the mobility of [[radionuclide]]s in [[Deep geological repository|waste repositories]]; and the [[biodegradation]] of chemicals in [[landfill]]s. When applied to the study of contaminants in the environments, they are known as fate and transport models.&lt;ref name="GBRM"&gt;Bethke, C.M., 2008, ''Geochemical and Biogeochemical Reaction Modeling''. Cambridge University Press, 547 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development of reactive transport modeling ==
Modern reactive transport modeling has arisen from several separate schools of thought.&lt;ref name= "Steefel, DePaolo, and Lichtner"&gt;Steefel, C.I., D.J. DePaolo, and P.C. Lichtner, 2005, Reactive transport modeling: An essential tool and a new research approach for the Earth sciences. ''Earth and Planetary Science Letters'' '''240''', 539-558&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hydrologists]] primarily concerned with the physical nature of mass transport assumed relatively simple reaction formulations, such as linear distribution coefficients or linear decay terms, which could be added to the [[Convection diffusion equation|advection-dispersion equation]]. By assuming linear, equilibrium [[sorption]], for example, the advection-dispersion equation can be modified by a simple [[retardation factor]] and solved [[Closed-form expression|analytically]]. Such analytical solutions are limited to relatively simple flow systems and reactions.

[[Geochemical modeling|Geochemical models]], on the other hand, have been developed to provide [[Chemical thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] descriptions of multicomponent systems without regard to transport. Reaction path models were created, for instance, to describe the sequence of chemical reactions resulting from [[chemical weathering]] or [[hydrothermal alteration]] in [[Batch reactor|batch systems]], in terms of the overall reaction progress. By adopting the reference frame of a packet of fluid and treating reaction progress as travel time (or distance along a flowpath), however, a batch reaction path model could be thought of as describing advective transport through an [[aquifer]].&lt;ref&gt;Lichtner, P.C., 1988, The quasi-stationary state approximation to coupled mass transport and fluid-rock interaction in a porous medium. ''Geochemica et Cosmochemica Acta'' '''52''', 143-165&lt;/ref&gt;

The most sophisticated multi-component reactive transport models considered both reaction and transport.&lt;ref&gt;Lichtner, P.C., 1985, Contiuum model for simultaneous chemical reactions and mass transport in hydrothermal systems. ''Geochemica et Cosmochemica Acta'' '''49''', 779-800&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Gharasoo2012"&gt;Gharasoo, M., Centler, F., Regnier, P., Harms, H., Thullner, M., 2012.

Environmental Modelling &amp; Software 30, 102-114.&lt;/ref&gt; Early studies developed the theoretical basis of reactive transport models, and the numerical tools necessary to solve them, and applied them to problems of reactive contaminant transport&lt;ref&gt;Yeh, G.T. and V.S. Tripathi, 1989, A critical evaluation of recent developments in hydrogeochemical transport models of reactive multi-chemical components. ''Water Resources Research'' '''25''', 93-108&lt;/ref&gt; and flow through reacting hydrothermal systems.&lt;ref name = "Steefel and Lasaga"&gt;Steefel, C.I. and A.C.

''American Journal of Science'' '''294''', 529-592&lt;/ref&gt;

Reactive transport models have found increased application in recent years with improvements in the power of personal computers and [[#Software programs in common use|modeling software]].&lt;ref name = "Gharasoo2012" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brady, P.V. and C.M. Bethke, 2000, Beyond the Kd approach. ''Ground Water'' '''38''', 321-322&lt;/ref&gt;

== Processes considered in reactive transport models ==
Reactive transport models couple a large number chemical reactions with mass transport. Certain applications, such as [[geothermal energy]] production and [[ore deposit]] modeling, require the additional calculation of [[heat transfer]]. In modeling [[carbon sequestration]] and [[hydraulic fracturing]], moreover, it may be necessary to describe rock deformation resulting from mineral growth or abnormally high fluid pressure. Description of transport through the [[unsaturated zone]] and [[multiphase flow]] modeling, as applied to transport of [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]]; non-aqueous phase liquids ([[DNAPL]] or [[LNAPL]]); and [[supercritical carbon dioxide]] requires increasingly complex models which are prone to considerable uncertainty.

In many cases the processes simulated in reactive transport models are highly related. Mineral dissolution and precipitation, for example, can affect the [[porosity]] and [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]] of the domain, which in turn affect the flow field and groundwater velocity. Heat transport greatly affects the [[viscosity]] of water and its ability to flow. Below are many of the physical and chemical processes which can be simulated with reactive transport models.

== Solving reactive transport models ==
Some of the simplest reactive transport problems can be solved analytically. Where equilibrium sorption is described by a linear distribution coefficient, for example, the sorbing solute's velocity is retarded relative to that of a nonreactive tracer; the relative velocities can be described with a retardation factor. Analytical solutions are exact solutions of the governing equations. 

Complex reactive transport problems are more commonly solved numerically. In this case, the governing equations are approximated so that they can be solved by computer algorithms. The governing equations, including both reaction and transport terms, can be solved simultaneously using a one-step or global implicit simulator. This technique is straightforward conceptually, but computationally very difficult.&lt;ref name ="Steefel and MacQuarrie"&gt;Steefel, C.I. and K.T.B. MacQuarrie, 1996, Approaches to modeling of reactive transport in porous media. In P.C. Lichtner, C.I. Steefel, and E.H. Oelkers (eds.), 1996, Reactive Transport in Porous Media. ''Reviews in Mineralogy'' '''34''', 85-129&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of solving all the relevant equations together, the transport and chemical reaction equations can be solved separately. [[Operator splitting]], as this technique is known, uses appropriate numerical techniques to solve the reaction and transport equations at each time step.&lt;ref name="GBRM" /&gt; Various methods exist, including the sequential non-iterative approach (SNIA), [[Strang splitting]], and sequential iterative approach (SIA).&lt;ref name ="Steefel and MacQuarrie" /&gt; Since the reaction and transport terms are handled separately, separate programs for batch reaction and transport can be linked together. Cross-linkable [[Reentrancy (computing)|re-entrant software]] objects designed for this purpose readily enable construction of reactive transport models of any flow configuration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aqueous Solutions launches ChemPlugin|url=http://www.researchpark.illinois.edu/news/aqueous-solutions-launches-chemplugin|work=Researchpark.illinois.edu|publisher=Research Park at the University of Illinois|accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chemplugin.org/|title=ChemPlugin.ORG|publisher=Aqueous Solutions LLC|accessdate=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challenges ==
Reactive transport modeling requires input from numerous fields, including [[hydrology]], [[geochemistry]] and [[biogeochemistry]], [[microbiology]], [[soil physics]], and [[fluid dynamics]].&lt;ref name= "Steefel, DePaolo, and Lichtner" /&gt; The numerical formulation and solution of reactive transport problems can be especially difficult due to errors arising in the coupling process, beyond those inherent to the individual processes. Valocchi and Malmstead (1992), for example, reported on the potential errors arising from the operator splitting technique.&lt;ref&gt;Valocchi, A.J. and M. Malmstead, 1992, Accuracy of operator splitting for advection-dispersion-reaction problems. ''Water Resources Research'' '''28(5)''', 1471-1476&lt;/ref&gt;

Even in the absence of numerical difficulties, the general lack of knowledge available to practitioners creates uncertainty. Field sites are typically [[heterogeneous]], both physically and chemically, and sampling is often sparse. The prevailing assumption of [[Fick's laws of diffusion|Fickian]] [[Dispersive mass transfer|dispersion]] is often inadequate. [[Equilibrium constants]] and [[chemical kinetics|kinetic rate laws]] for relevant reactions are often poorly known. The complexity of many processes requires expertise in one or more of the above mentioned fields. Many processes, such as long-term nuclear waste storage, cannot be experimentally verified; reactive transport problems can only attempt to predict such long-term behavior. The current descriptions of multi-phase flow and mechanical deformation processes are still being developed.

[[File:Diensthund.jpg|thumb]]
The term '''shock collar''' is a term used in order to describe a family of [[Dog training|training]] collars (also called '''e-collars''', '''Ecollars''', '''remote training collars''', '''Zap collars''', or '''electronic collars''') that deliver [[electrical shock]]s of varying intensity and duration to the neck of a dog (they can also be applied to other places on the dog's body, to achieve various training effects) via a radio-controlled electronic device incorporated into a dog collar. Some collar models also include a tone or vibrational setting, as an alternative to or in conjunction with the shock. Others include integration with Internet mapping capabilities and GPS to locate the dog or alert an owner of his/her whereabouts.

Originally used in the late 1960s to train hunting dogs, early collars were very high powered. Many modern versions are capable of delivering very low levels of shock.  Shock collars are now readily available and have been used in a range of applications, including behavioral modification, obedience training, and pet containment, as well as military, police and service training.  While similar systems are available for other animals, the most common are the collars designed for [[domestic dog]]s.

==Types of devices==

===Pet containment systems===
The most common use of shock collars is pet containment systems that are used to keep a dog inside the perimeter of the residence without the construction of a physical barrier. This use of shock collars is increasingly popular in areas where local laws or homeowners' associations prohibit the construction of a physical fence.  Available systems include: in-ground installation to preserve the aesthetics of the yard; above ground installation to reinforce an existing barrier that was not sufficient in containing the dog; and wireless systems to allow for indoor use. Most pet containment systems work by installing a wire around the perimeter of the yard. The wire carries no current (as opposed to electric fences which do carry a current at high voltage that may be lethal in the event of unauthorized or defective installation or equipment) but forms a closed loop with a circuit box that transmits a radio signal to the receiver collar worn by the dog.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Lindsay|2005|p=573}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the dog approaches the perimeter the collar will activate.

===Bark control collars===
Bark control collars are used to curb excessive or nuisance barking by delivering a shock at the moment the dog begins barking. Bark collars can be activated by microphone or vibration, and some of the most advanced collars use both sound and vibration to eliminate the possibility of extraneous noises activating a response.

===Training collars or remote trainers===
Training collars can be activated by a handheld device. Better quality remote trainers have a large variety of levels and functions, can give varying duration of stimulation, better quality stimulation, and have a beep or vibration option useful for getting the dog’s attention.  Proper training is an imperative for remote collar use, as misuse can cause negative behavioral fallout.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Polsky|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many recommend consulting a behaviorist or a certified training professional who is experienced with shock collars for successful usage and application.

Shock collars may be used in conjunction with [[positive reinforcement]] and / or utilizing other principles of [[operant conditioning]], depending on the trainer's methods either as a form of [[positive punishment]], where the shock is applied at the moment an undesired behavior occurs, in order to reduce the frequency of that behavior; or as a form of [[Reinforcement (psychology)|negative reinforcement]], where a continuous stimulation is applied until the moment a desired behavior occurs, in order to increase the frequency of that behavior.

==Frame of reference==
[[Electrical shock]] is the physiological reaction, sensation, or injury caused by electric current passing through the body. It occurs upon contact of a body part with any source of electricity that causes a sufficient current through the skin, muscles, or hair.

Commenting in his textbook on training and behaviour, Steven Lindsay wrote about the public perception of the term "shock" and its application in the description of training aids; "At low levels, the term shock is hardly fitting to describe the effects produced by electronic training collars, since there is virtually no effect beyond a pulsing tingling or tickling sensation on the surface of the skin ... the word shock is loaded with biased connotations, images of convulsive spasms and burns, and implications associated with extreme physical pain, emotional trauma, physiological collapse, and laboratory abuses ... the stimulus or signal generated by most modern devices is highly controlled and presented to produce a specific set of behavioral and motivational responses to it." &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Lindsay|first=Steven R.|title=Handbook|year=2005|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Ames, Iowa|page=569}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article for the trade magazine "Office for veterinary service and food control", Dr. Dieter Klein compared the effects of shock collars with other electrical stimulation products; "Modern devices ... are in a range in which normally no organic damage is being inflicted. The electric properties and performances of the modern low current remote stimulation devices ... are comparable to the electric stimulation devices used in human medicine. Organic damage, as a direct impact of the applied current, can be excluded.” &lt;ref&gt;Klein, Dieter R., 2000, How Dangerous are Remote Stimulation Devices for the Training of Dogs?” Amtstierärztlicher Dienst und Lebensmittelkontrolle&lt;/ref&gt;

"At 0.914 joules the electric muscle stimulation and contractions a human receives from an 'abdominal energizer' fitness product is exponentially stronger — more than 1,724 times stronger— than the impulse a dog receives from a pet containment collar set at its highest level."&lt;ref name="Radio Systems White Paper"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Facts About Modern Electronic Training Devices |url=http://www.joeyspetoutfitters.com/Portals/0/Files/Electronic-Training-Devices.pdf?ver=2014-08-28-165933-417 |publisher=Radio Systems |accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical considerations==
Electric shock can be characterised in terms of voltage, current, waveform, frequency (of waveform), pulse rate and duration. 
Although voltage, current and duration of shock can be used to calculate the amount of energy applied (in [[Joules]]), these are not indicators of the intensity of the stimulus or how it may be perceived by the recipient.  Static electric shocks that are experienced in daily life are of the order of 20,000 to 25,000 volts, and yet are not painful or physically damaging because they are of very low current.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Binns |first1=Corey |title=The Shocking Truth Behind Static Electricity |url=https://www.livescience.com/4077-shocking-truth-static-electricity.html |website=LiveScience |accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on design, shock collars can be set so that the shock delivered is only mildly uncomfortable.  Variable settings of this kind are essential, so that the shock collar can be adjusted to the level that the dog requires, as situations change.

Shock collars are sometimes referred to as delivering a "static shock"; however, static electricity is [[direct current]] and carries little energy (order of millijoules). Shock collars make use of [[alternating current]]. It is therefore inappropriate to refer to shock collars as delivering a static shock.

In order to deliver consistent shocks, good contact must be made between the collar electrodes and the dog's skin (the collar must be fitted according to the manufacturer's instructions). Local humidity and individual variation in coat density, skin thickness and surface conductivity, will also affect the delivery of the shock.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The waveform, its frequency, the pulse rate, current, voltage and impedance are important determinants of likely response. "Many e−collars appear to shift intensity levels by altering the pulse duration or repetition rate while keeping the output current and voltage relatively constant, depending on the electrode−skin load." (Lindsay 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;573).

Individual variations in temperament, pain sensitivity and susceptibility to startle of dogs, means that shock settings must be carefully adjusted to produce a shock that is perceived by the dog as only just aversive enough to stop the dog engaging in the unwanted behaviour.  Normally salient stimuli, such as noises, commands and even shocks, may have no effect on a dog that is highly aroused and focused on an activity such as hunting.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==Potential to cause harm==
In 1980 (revised 1987), the US [[Center for Veterinary Medicine]] (CVM), a branch of the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), concurred in regulatory action against a manufacturer of a bark collar, stating "Complaints received, which were later corroborated by our own testing, included severe burns in the collar area and possible personality adjustment injuries to the dogs. The shocking mechanism was found to be activated not only by barking but by vehicle horns, slamming doors or any other loud noise. CVM concurred in regulatory action against the device since it was deemed to be dangerous to the health of the animal.".&lt;ref name="FDA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/ComplianceManuals/CompliancePolicyGuidanceManual/ucm074684.htm | title= FDA Compliance enforcement| author=FDA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standing policy of the US FDA is that "Dog collars which are activated by the noise of barking to produce an electric shock are considered as hazardous to the health of the animal."&lt;ref name="FDA"/&gt;

No regulations exist specifying the performance characteristics or reliability of these devices, so there is considerable variation in shock level and waveform characteristics between manufacturers, and perhaps even between batches of collars from a single manufacturer. The lack of regulation or standards, and the fact that some of the safety features of shock collars are patented by specific manufacturers,&lt;ref name="Innotek Patent"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everypatent.com/comp/pat6184790.html | title= Innotek patent| author=Innotek}}&lt;/ref&gt; means that the safety and operational characteristics of individual products cannot be verified.

== Training effectiveness ==
[[File:Shock collar.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Shock%20collar.jpg|thumb|Shock Collar]]{{Cleanup section|reason=has footnotes that aren't inline citations|date=June 2018}}

The debate over the effectiveness of shock collars is highly debated, however it is not one sided. Each side has a wide variety of backers and activists from professors, to activists, and trainers. 

According to Pat Nolan, who has been training dogs for over thirty years, shock training is a key and effective use to train dogs (Nolan, 2011). According to his methods described in his book regular and fair use is key in shock training. He goes into detail about what fair use is, stating that keeping a regular training schedule is key and to set some boundaries your pet will understand (Nolan, 2011).

== Deterring predation in the wild ==
The Wildlife Society article addresses the use of shock collars as a way to prevent sheep from being preyed upon by wild [[coyote]]s. According to (Phillips, 1999)&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andelt|first=William F.|last2=Phillips|first2=Robert L.|last3=Gruver|first3=Kenneth S.|last4=Guthrie|first4=Jerry W.|date=1999|title=Coyote Predation on Domestic Sheep Deterred with Electronic Dog-Training Collar|jstor=3783933|journal=Wildlife Society Bulletin (1973-2006)|volume=27|issue=1|pages=12–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; they tested these collars on coyotes for a four-month period and found that the collars stopped thirteen attacks on sheep herds. This also is said to deter future attacks by the tested coyotes. Collars have also been used on wolves for similar reasons. This document is the assessment of the shock collar on wolves’ long-term behavior. The article talks about trying to alter [[wolves]]’ behavior over an extended period of time using the collar. The consensus was while it did have an effect while in use and temporally after it was removed, the study concluded that longer exposure would be needed in order to have any substantial evidence (Hawley, 2008). As far as non-lethal alternatives these two sources both concluded that shock collars are the most effective deterrence to predators. Both groups continued their research and the [[The Wildlife Society|Wildlife Society]] has developed a new and improved version that eliminates the risk of neck injury when used on animals that previous versions caused. They have increased battery life and the durability of the unit. They devised a unit that is worn like a back pack for the animal. Previous versions caused excessive rubbing and soreness as well as being irritating for the animal to the point were they would try to take the harness off.

==Scientific studies==

===Christiansen et al study (2001a)===
Christiansen et al., looked at behavioural differences between three breeds of dogs when confronted by domestic sheep (138 dogs; Elkhounds, hare hunting dogs and English setters).&lt;ref name="Christiansen, Frank O. 2001, pp. 115-129"&gt;Christiansen, Frank O., Bakkenb, Morten, Braastadb, Bjarne O., 2001, Behavioural differences between three breed groups of hunting dogs confronted with domestic sheep . Applied Animal Behaviour Science, Volume 72(2), pp. 115-129. .&lt;/ref&gt; Two testing procedures were used and shock collars were used to deter attacks on sheep. The first, a path test, involved observing the dogs' reactions to a set of novel stimuli (rag pulled across the track, bundle of cans thrown down, tethered sheep at 5m) as it was walked. The second test involved monitoring the dog's reaction to a free-roaming sheep flock in a field. In this study they identified several factors that predicted a high hunting motivation and attack severity. These were lack of previous opportunity to chase sheep, low fearfulness towards gunshots and unfamiliar people and general interest in sheep when encountering them. Younger dogs (&lt;3 years of age) showed more pronounced initial hunting motivation and more frequent attacks. Elkhounds showed more hunting behaviour, more attacks and were more frequently given electric shocks during the tests. A shock collar was used to deter attacks on the sheep during the experiments. Shocks (3000V, 0.4A, duration 1 second) were delivered when dogs came within a distance of 1-2m of the sheep, and were repeated until the dogs left the area. The objective was to suppress an attack, but not to damage the hunting ability of the dogs. Despite frequently initiated chases and attacks, few shocks were delivered. This was because few dogs approached closer than 1–2 m, and the intention was to deter proximity to sheep rather than to associate hunting behaviour with an aversive shock, which would impair future hunting behaviour in other contexts.

===Christiansen et al. study (2001b)===
The dogs used in the first study were re-tested using the same procedures in order to assess the long-term impact of the training on their reaction to sheep.&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen, Frank O., Bakkenb, Morten, Braastadb, Bjarne O., 2001, Behavioural changes and aversive conditioning in hunting dogs by the second-year confrontation with domestic sheep. Applied Animal Behaviour Science, Volume 72, pp. 131-143. .&lt;/ref&gt;  Again, in the free-running tests the dogs were fitted with a shock collar, which was used to deter approaches to within 1-2m of the sheep. Dogs that had previously been shocked in year 1 showed a significant increased in latency to approach a person during the path test (p&lt;0.001), even though this was not a condition under which shocks had been delivered. Owners reported behavioral differences between year 1 and 2 in 24 of the dogs. 18 of the 24 dogs had shown no interest in sheep during that period, even though they had been interested in them during the first year tests. However, only one of those dogs had received shocks, so the change in behaviour could not be attributed to the use of the shock collar. When comparing owners’ reports for the two years, the dogs showed a weaker inclination for chasing sheep and other prey than previously (p &lt; 0:001), but this variable was not affected by shock experience. Dogs that had shown interest in sheep in year 1 showed a persistent interest in year 2. No dogs chased or attacked sheep as their first response, while half of them did so the first year. During the entire test period, the proportion of dogs attacking sheep was reduced to almost one fourth. The number of shocks administered per dog was reduced by the second year, and only one of the dogs which received el. shocks the first year needed el. shocks also the second year.The observations that both receivers and non-receivers of el. shocks the first year showed a reduction in the probability of chasing sheep, but the receivers showing a larger reduction, show that el. shock treatment provides an additional learning response. No adverse effects on the dogs were observed with this training procedure, but in their discussion the authors commented "In order to ensure no negative effects, we recommend that the electronic dog collar may be used for such purposes only if it is used by skilled trainers with special competence on dog behaviour, learning mechanisms, and of this particular device."

===Salgirli dissertation (2008)===

The aim of Salgirli's study was "...to investigate whether any stress is caused by the use of specific conditioned signal, quitting signal, and/or pinch collars as alternatives to electric training collars, and if they do so, whether the stress produced in the process is comparable to the one with electric training collars.".&lt;ref name="elib.tiho-hannover.de"&gt;http://elib.tiho-hannover.de/dissertations/salgirliy_ws08.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The study population were a group of 42 adult police dogs. The quitting signal was a conditioned frustration equivalent to [[negative punishment]]. It was conditioned by associating failure to obtain an anticipated food reward with a specific vocal signal. In the test, dogs were walked past a "provocateur" who attempted to taunt the dog into a reaction. If the dog reacted, it was punished, and if it failed to react on subsequent provocations then the punishment was deemed to have had a learning effect. The study is therefore a comparison of negative and positive punishment methods, and not a comparison of punishment with positive reinforcement. Learning effect was measured by assessing the number of dogs that learned to quit a behaviour after application of the punishing stimulus. There was no statistical difference in learning effect between the pinch and shock collar, but the quitting signal produced a significantly poorer learning effect compared to shock or pinch collars (p &lt; 0.01 in both cases). "Although the pinch collar caused more behavioral reactions, in the form of distress, than the electronic training collar, the electronic training collar elicits more vocal reactions in dogs than the pinch collars"; the explanation for increased vocalisation in the shock collar group was that this was due to a startle response rather than pain reactions.

Salivary cortisol was monitored to measure the stress levels of the dogs, but this data was not presented in the dissertation; behavioral observation was the sole measure of stress.  The study concluded that the electronic training collar induces less distress and shows stronger “learning effect” in dogs in comparison to the pinch collar. Commenting on the quitting signal, the author stated "It should particularly be mentioned, that the quitting signal training was implied only on adult dogs within the frame of this study. Therefore, the results should not be interpreted as that the quitting signal can not be a suitable method in police dog training. As previously stated training of the quitting signal requires a hard and a structured procedure. Thus, if the training, namely the conditioning, begins in puppyhood, the quitting signal can also be an effective method in police dog training". Comparing the effects of the three punishment methods; "These results can probably be explained by that electronic training collar complies completely with the punishment criteria, which were defined by TORTORA (1982), in case of proof of the proficient and experienced user. On the other hand when applying the pinch collar, these criteria can not be met even though perfect timing is applied since reactions of the dog and effectiveness of the method depends on several different factors such as the willingness, strength and motivation of the handler, as well as his/her proficiency. In addition to that, the visibility of the administrator and, thus, of the punishment is another important factor influencing the efficiency of the pinch collar because the dog directly links the punishment with its owner. Therefore this method does not satisfy the ‘‘punishment criteria’’ at all. The quitting signal on the other hand requires criteria, such as good timing and structured training procedure, on account of complete conditioning in order to achieve effective results. Even if these criteria are met, the personality trait of the dog is another factor, which influences the efficiency of the signal."&lt;ref name="elib.tiho-hannover.de"/&gt;

===Schalke et al. study (2007)===

Schalke et al. conducted a 7-month study to investigate the effect of shock collars on stress parameters, in a series of different training situations.&lt;ref&gt;Schalke, E., Stichnoth, J., Ott, S., Jones-Baade, R., 2007, Clinical signs caused by the use of electric training collars on dogs in everyday life situations. Applied Animal Behaviour Science 105, pp. 369-380.&lt;/ref&gt; Heart rate and saliva cortisol were used to determine the stress levels in three groups of dogs. Group A received the electric shock when they touched the "prey" (a rabbit dummy attached to a motion device), Group H ("here" command) received the electric shock when they did not obey a previously trained recall command during hunting, and Group R (random) received random shocks that were unpredictable and out of context.  Group A did not show a significant rise in cortisol levels; the other two groups (R &amp; H) did show a significant rise, with group R showing the highest level of cortisol. Salivary cortisol was measured, as this procedure is less likely to cause stress related rise in cortisol.

From this the researchers concluded that the dogs who could clearly associate the shock with their action (i.e. touching the prey) and as a result were able to predict and control whether they received a shock, did not show considerable or persistent stress.  The evidence of increased stress in the other groups was felt to support earlier findings that poor timing and/or inappropriate use of a shock collar puts the dog at high risk of severe and ongoing stress.  They conclude that "The results of this study suggest that poor timing in the application of high level electric pulses, such as those used in this study, means there is a high risk that dogs will show severe and persistent stress symptoms. We recommend that the use of these devices should be restricted with proof of theoretical and practical qualification required and then the use of these devices should only be allowed in strictly specified situations."

===Schilder &amp; van der Borg study (2004)===

Schilder and van der Borg conducted a study to compare the behavior of police service dogs that had previously been trained using a shock collar (Group S) with those which had not (Group C).&lt;ref&gt;Schilder, M.B.H., van der Borg, J.A.M, 2004, Training dogs with help of the shock collar: short and long term behavioral effects. Applied Animal Behaviour Science 85, pp. 319-334.&lt;/ref&gt; In the training test no shocks were applied, but the animal's behavior was observed during training tasks. The intention was to investigate whether shock collar based training might have a long-term effect on stress-related behavior even in the absence of shock, and whether this related to specific features of the training context. Behaviors recorded included recognised indicators of stress (panting, lip-licking, yawning, paw lifting and body posture) as well as yelping, squealing, snapping and avoidance. During free walks on the training grounds, groups S dogs showed significantly more stress related behaviors and a lower body posture than group C dogs. During training, the same differences were found. The difference between the groups was more significant when training took place on the familiar training ground, indicating a contextual effect. The presence of the trainer was considered to be part of this context. The authors concluded "We concluded that shocks received during training are not only unpleasant but also painful and frightening."

Lindsay says of this study, "Schilder and Van der Borg (2004) have published a report of disturbing findings regarding the short-term and long- term effects of shock used in the context of working dogs that is destined to become a source of significant controversy.... The absence of reduced drive or behavioral suppression with respect to critical activities associated with shock (e.g., bite work) makes one skeptical about the lasting adverse effects the authors claim to document. Although they offer no substantive evidence of trauma or harm to dogs, they provide loads of speculation, anecdotes, insinuations of gender and educational inadequacies, and derogatory comments regarding the motivation and competence of IPO trainers in its place."  &lt;ref name="Lindsay 2005 611–612"&gt;{{Citation|last=Lindsay|first=Steven R.|title=Handbook|year=2005|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Ames, Iowa|pages=611–612}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Steiss et al. study (2007)===
Steiss, et al., conducted a four-week study of adult shelter dogs’ physiological and behavioral responses to bark control collars. Plasma cortisol was used as the stress measure. Dogs were randomly assigned to either a shock collar, a spray collar, or a dummy collar (control group). Dogs that were known to bark at an unfamiliar dog were used for the study. Test conditions involved presentation of an unfamiliar dog. Dogs wore activated collars for period of 30 minutes per day for three days in two consecutive weeks. The amount of barking was significantly reduced starting on the second day with both the spray and shock collars. There was no significant difference in effect between the two collar types. The treatment group dogs showed a mild yet statistically significant increase in blood cortisol level (an indicator of stress) only on the first day of wearing the collars (as compared to the Control Group.)&lt;ref&gt;Steiss, J.E., Schaffer, C., Ahmad, H.A., and Voith, V.L., 2007, Evaluation of Plasma Cortisol Levels and Behavior in Dogs Wearing Bark Control Collars. Applied Animal Behaviour Science 106, pp. 96-106.&lt;/ref&gt; At the conclusion of the study, Dr. Steiss and her team concluded that "In the present study, with dogs wearing bark control collars intermittently over a 2-week period, the collars effectively deterred barking without statistically significant elevations in plasma cortisol, compared to controls, at any of the time points measured."

===Tortora Study (1983)===

Tortora applied a method called "safety training" to treat aggression in 36 cases exhibiting a form of "instrumental aggression", selected after screening a population of 476 cases. "Instrumental aggression" was defined as describing aggressive acts that "do not have a clear evolutionary significance, are not directly related to emotional arousal, do not have specific releasing stimuli, are not directly modulated by hormones, and do not have an identifiable focus in the brain". Tortora states that in the context of the article "instrumental aggression" was specifically defined as "aggressive responses that have "a specifiable learning history, show a growth function over time and are modulated by their consequences. These dogs had few operant alternatives to gain reinforcement by compliance and were channeled down a path that allowed their innate aggressiveness to come under the control of the negatively reinforcing contingencies in the environment". The dogs initially behaved as though they "expected" aversive events and that the only way to prevent these events was through aggression. The dogs were therefore a highly selected subset that had not learned strategies for coping with threat.

Each dog was trained to respond to a set of 15 commands taken from the AKC standard for CDX obedience. The commands were selected to provide control over the dog, and included "heel", "stand" "go", "come", "hold", "drop" and "sit". These behaviors were termed "safety behaviors". Training was divided into 9 stages, each of which was composed of 5-20 twice daily training sessions. Dogs could only progress to the next stage after passing a test. On average, dogs took 10-15 sessions to complete each stage. After training basic commands, the dogs were trained to perform the behaviors they had already learned in order to avoid progressively increasing electric shock. After that, they were conditioned to perform a safety behavior in order to avoid a "safety tone" that allowed them to anticipate the shock. In the later stages of training, dogs were exposed to provocation by a distractor dog, and were punished using full intensity shock if they failed to perform a safety behavior or if they showed aggression. After training was complete, and the dogs were choosing to perform the safety behaviors instead of aggression, owners were taught to use the shock collar and the training was transferred into everyday situations. The training resulted in a long-lasting and complete suppression of aggressive behaviour in the dogs. Dogs were followed up 3 years after the end of training, and the reduction in aggression were maintained.&lt;ref&gt;http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=1984-03181-001&amp;CFID=7872469&amp;CFTOKEN=51050078&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

[[PETA]] (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) opposes the use of shock collars, stating "Dogs wearing shock collars can suffer from physical pain and injury (ranging from burns to cardiac fibrillation) and psychological stress, including severe anxiety and displaced aggression. Individual animals vary in their temperaments and pain thresholds; a shock that seems mild to one dog may be severe to another. The anxiety and confusion caused by repeated shocks can lead to changes in the heart and respiration rate or gastrointestinal disorders. Electronic collars can also malfunction, either administering nonstop shocks or delivering no shocks at all".&lt;ref name="PETA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peta.org/living/companion-animals/caring-animal-companions/dogs/electric-fences-shock-collars/ | title= Electric Fences and Shock Collars| author=PETA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CABTSG (The Companion Animal Behaviour Therapy Study Group), an affiliate group of the BSAVA (British Small Animal Veterinary Association), produced a policy statement on the use of shock collars, stating "Their effectiveness depends upon the pain and fear experienced by the animal, but to use them correctly requires detailed understanding of behaviour and its motivation, as well as very precise timing. Few operators are able to achieve any reliable success with these devices and the consequences of failure can be a worsening of the problem behaviour. The indiscriminate use of shock collars therefore poses a threat to the safety of the general public, as well as to the welfare of the animal. We believe that sufficient alternative methods of treatment exist that such electronic training devices are redundant. Therefore, as an association affiliated to BSAVA, it is our duty to recommend that shock collars and all other related training and control aids should be banned from sale or use".&lt;ref name="CABTSG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doghavendogs.com/Companion%20Animal%20Behaviour%20Therapy%20Study%20Group%20-%20Electronic%20training%20aids.pdf | title= CABTSG Policy Statement| author=CABTSG}}&lt;/ref&gt; CABTSG has been renamed the British Veterinary Behaviour Association.

The BSAVA (British Small Animal Veterinary Association) produced a statement on the risks associated with collars "In principle, the BSAVA opposes the use of electronic shock collars for training and containment of animals. Shocks received during training may not only be acutely stressful, painful and frightening for the animal but also may produce long term adverse effects on behavioural and emotional responses.".&lt;ref name="BSAVA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsava.com/Resources/Positionstatements/Aversivetrainingmethods.aspx | title= BSAVA Statement| author=BSAVA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the advice of the RSPCA (Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) and other welfare groups, the ACPO (Association of Chief Police Officers)banned the use of shock collars for police dog training by all UK police forces. The current ACPO Police Dogs Manual of Guidance states "Equipment that is not approved for use in the training of police dogs includes remote training collars designed to give an electric shock and Pinch Collars" .&lt;ref name="ACPO"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.acpo.police.uk/documents/uniformed/2011/201103UOPDogsMoG1.1.pdf |title=ACPO Police Dogs Manual of Guidance |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702042548/http://www.acpo.police.uk/documents/uniformed/2011/201103UOPDogsMoG1.1.pdf |archivedate=2014-07-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RSPCA commissioned a review of the effects of shock collars from the Department of Veterinary Medicine at Bristol University, which is available online. It states "Given the lack of scientific evidence for the efficacy of behavioural modification using shock collars, particularly in the long term, in addition to the potential for mistakes or deliberate abuse and the difficulty in correcting such errors, the widespread use of these devices must be carefully considered." &lt;ref name="RSPCA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rspca.org.uk/ImageLocator/LocateAsset?asset=document&amp;assetId=1232713013325&amp;mode=prd | title= RSPCA Review| author=Casey and Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK [[Kennel Club]] has an ongoing campaign to achieve a ban on the sale and use of shock collars; "The Kennel Club is against the use of any negative training methods or devices. The Kennel Club believes that there are many positive training tools and methods that can produce dogs that are trained just as quickly and reliably, with absolutely no fear, pain, or potential damage to the relationship between dog and handler." "The Kennel Club in calling upon the Government and Scottish Parliament to introduce an outright ban on this barbaric method of training dogs.".&lt;ref name="KC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/banshockcollars | title= Kennel Club Campaign| author=Kennel Club}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two British members of the World Union of German Shepherd Clubs (WUSV) have joined the Kennel Club in calling for a complete ban on shock collars, and passed a motion to exclude this equipment from any of its training branches during official club training times.&lt;ref name="WUSV"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/cgi-bin/item.cgi?d=pndpr&amp;f=pnfpr&amp;h=241&amp;id=729 |title=WUSV Ban |author=WUSV |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325061026/http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/cgi-bin/item.cgi?d=pndpr&amp;f=pnfpr&amp;h=241&amp;id=729 |archivedate=2012-03-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The HSUS ([[Humane Society of the United States]]) provides the following comment on the use of aversive collars (choke chains, pinch collars and shock collars): "Some trainers use aversive collars to train "difficult" dogs with correction or punishment. These collars rely on physical discomfort or even pain to teach the dog what not to do. They suppress the unwanted behavior but don't teach him what the proper one is. At best, they are unpleasant for your dog, and at worst, they may cause your dog to act aggressively and even bite you. Positive training methods should always be your first choice." They go on to comment on shock collars specifically: "The least humane and most controversial use of the shock collar is as a training device. The trainer can administer a shock to a dog at a distance through a remote control. There is a greater chance for abuse (delivery of shocks as punishment) or misuse (poor timing of shocks). Your dog also may associate the painful shock with people or other experiences, leading to fearful or aggressive behavior".&lt;ref name="HSUS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanesociety.org/animals/dogs/tips/collars.html | title= HSUS statement| author=HSUS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NCAE (Norwegian Council on Animal Ethics) "recommends the introduction of a ban electric training collars and similar remote-controlled or automatic electronic devices that cause your dog substantial discomfort. It should nevertheless be granted an exemption for such training carried out by authorized persons in order to prevent hunting of livestock and wildlife."  &lt;ref name="Norwegian Council on Animal Ethics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radetfordyreetikk.no/1996/02/elektriske-dressurmidler-hund/ | title=Norwegian Council on Animal Ethics| author=NCAE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The APDT (Association of Professional Dog Trainers) says, "[Electronic] training collars should not be used by novice dog owners or by trainers who are not properly instructed in their use. Use of electronic training collars can result in trauma to your dog and generally are not recommended by positive reinforcement trainers".&lt;ref name="APDT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apdt.com/petowners/choose/equipment.aspx | title=APDT| author=APDT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AVSAB (American Veterinary Society of Animal Behavior) has produced a position statement titled "The use of punishment for behavior modification in animals", the opening paragraph of which reads "AVSAB’s position is that punishment (e.g. choke chains, pinch collars, and electronic collars) should not be used as a first-line or early-use treatment for behavior problems. This is due to the potential adverse effects which include but are not limited to: inhibition of learning, increased fear-related and aggressive behaviors, and injury to animals and people interacting with animals." &lt;ref name="AVSAB Position Statement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avsabonline.org/uploads/position_statements/Combined_Punishment_Statements.pdf |title=AVSAB Position Statement|author=AVSAB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Praise==
In his 2005 textbook on training and behavior, Steven Lindsay writes "Instead of instilling social aversion and anxiety ... animal and human research supports the notion that competent shock [collar] training appears to promote positive social attachment, safety, and reward effects that may be provided and amplified via affectionate petting and reassuring praise. The preponderance of scientific evidence suggests that [electrical stimulation] escape/avoidance and pain reduction should promote long-term effects that are incompatible with fear and stress, making the trainer an object of significant extrinsic reward that actually enhances the dog's welfare via an improved capacity for social coping, learning, and adaptation".&lt;ref name="Lindsay 2005 611–612"/&gt; Steven Lindsay states "If minimizing the intensity, duration, and frequency of aversive stimulation during training is recognized as a significant factor in the definition of humane dog training, then the radio controlled e-collar must be ranked as one of the most humane dog-training tools currently available" &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Lindsay|first=Steven R.|title=Handbook|year=2005|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Ames, Iowa|page=586}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The International Association of Canine Professionals (IACP) strongly opposes legislation that bans or limits the humane use of any training tool, saying It is our conviction that limiting the humane use of training tools would result in a higher incidence of nuisance and dangerous dog behavior, and more dogs being surrendered to already over-burdened public shelters.... Dog training is a very diverse field with a single common thread: communication. Dogs are trained for many different tasks such as assisting the disabled, police work, herding, hunting, protection, competition and companionship. Professional trainers achieve these training goals by using a wide variety of tools to communicate with the dog, both at close range, and over long distances. Done effectively, this communication increases desirable behaviors and reduces the incidence of problem behaviors in dogs.... Any efforts to ban or limit the use of training tools would hinder this communication, and our ability to train dogs would suffer. Working dogs would no longer be able to achieve highly specialized tasks, and families with pet dogs would have fewer options available to correct behavioral problems.... Training tools, when properly utilized, are safe and humane".&lt;ref name="IACP Position Paper on Training Tools"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.canineprofessionals.com/assets/docs/iacp%20training%20tools%20position%20statement-1.pdf | title=IACP Position Paper on Training Tools| author=IACP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Randall Lockwood PhD, Senior Vice President, Anti-cruelty Initiatives and Legislative Services, The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) was quoted in a 2007 White Paper titled "The Facts About Modern Electronic Training Devices," produced by Radio Systems, a manufacturer of shock collars, "We recognize that older products were often unreliable and difficult to use humanely. But we feel that new technology employed by responsible manufacturers has led to products that can be and are being used safely and effectively to preserve the safety and well-being of many dogs and strengthen the bond with their human companions."&lt;ref name="Radio Systems White Paper"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Facts About Modern Electronic Training Devices |url=http://www.joeyspetoutfitters.com/Portals/0/Files/Electronic-Training-Devices.pdf?ver=2014-08-28-165933-417 |publisher=Radio Systems |accessdate=26 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public control==
The use of shock collars is banned in [[Scotland]], [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], [[Slovenia]], and [[Germany]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/our-resources/kennel-club-campaigns/electric-shock-collars/ | work=Kennel Club UK | title=Electric Shock Collars}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in some territories of [[Australia]], including [[New South Wales]] and Southern Australia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://kb.rspca.org.au/Is-the-use-of-electronic-dog-collars-legal_279.html | work=RSPCA Australia | title=Is the use of electronic dog collars legal? | date=May 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, the [[Welsh Assembly]] voted to ban the use of shock collars in [[Wales]]. &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/8584028.stm |title=Wales the first part of the UK to ban pet shock collars |publisher=BBC News |date=2010-03-24 |accessdate=2012-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ban was unsuccessfully challenged by Petsafe, a manufacturer of these devices, and the Electronic Collar Manufacturers' Association, who claimed that it breached Article 1 of the First Protocol of the European Convention of Human Rights.&lt;ref name="EU Court"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ukhumanrightsblog.com/2010/11/23/electric-shock-pet-collar-ban-did-not-breach-human-rights/ | title= Welsh Ban Challenge| author=Welsh Ban}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2018, it was announced that shock collars for cats and dogs would be banned in England. The [[Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs|Environment secretary]] [[Michael Gove]] said that shock collars caused unacceptable "harm and suffering". Animal charities, including the [[The Kennel Club|Kennel Club]], the [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|RSPCC]] and the [[Dogs Trust]], welcomed the move.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-45320038|title=Ban on electric shock collars for pets|date=2018-08-27|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-08-27|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal cases involving shock collars==
The potential for shock collars to have a negative impact on behaviour has been recognised by the UK courts. In 2001 Ostarra Langridge was prosecuted after one of her dogs attacked and killed a [[Shih Tzu]] whilst on a walk. A control order, rather than a destruction order, was imposed as the magistrates accepted the defense that Ms. Langridge's dog's aggressive behaviour was attributable to the effects of the shock collar. "Ms. Langridge sought the help of a behaviourist when her dogs started to run away from her on their walks along the beach. The dogs were given shock collars, which Miss Langridge was told to keep on for three months and activate whenever they misbehaved. But the first time the dogs got a shock was by mistake, after a small dog they were walking past made Miss Langridge jump. From then on her pets associated the shocks with small dogs and became afraid of them. When Miss Langridge described the day in July when her dogs turned on a Shih Tzu she had tears in her eyes.". She stated ""They connected the pain of the electric shock with little dogs because of the first time I used the collar. The day that machine came in this house I regret." &lt;ref name="Legal case"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/archive/2001/10/25/6771344.Collars__turned_dogs_into_killers_/?ref=arc| title=Collars turned dogs into killers| author=The Argus| deadurl=bot: unknown| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024152825/http://www.theargus.co.uk/archive/2001/10/25/6771344.Collars__turned_dogs_into_killers_/?ref=arc| archivedate=2014-10-24| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 11, 2011, a 48-year-old man from [[Ogmore-by-Sea]] became the first person convicted of illegal use of a shock collar in Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-13042363 | work=BBC News | title=Shock collar found on pet dog roaming on Vale beach | date=April 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently fined £2,000 and assessed £1,000 for court costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-14181927 | work=BBC News | title=Ogmore illegal shock collar dog owner gets £2,000 fine | date=July 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the RSPCA, Victoria (Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) lost a defamation lawsuit to Orion Pet Products, a shock collar manufacturer, and was ordered to pay $100,00 in damages.  The RSPCA had falsely claimed that shock collars can cause burns and delivered 3,000 volt shocks to dogs.  They made the "fanciful claim" that the current from a shock collar had caused a 60 Kilogram dog to perform backflips and resulted in brain damage.  Justice Weinberg also found that the RSPCA claims that these collars caused epileptic fits, vomiting, seizures, burning and bleeding were misleading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dogfight nets RSPCA chief $30,000 |url=https://www.theage.com.au/national/dogfight-nets-rspca-chief-30-000-20020706-gdud8l.html |website=The Age |accessdate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The RSPCA's senior inspector had falsified evidence in an attempt to demonstrate that shock collars can cause burns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Orion Pet Products Pty Ltd v Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Vic) |url=http://www8.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/cases/cth/federal_ct/2002/860.html |website=Federal Court of Australia |publisher=Federal Court of Australia |accessdate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5710">The '''simulated growth of plants''' is a significant task in of [[systems biology]] and  [[mathematical biology]], which seeks to reproduce [[plant morphology]] with computer software.
Electronic trees (e-trees) usually use [[L-system]]s to simulate growth. L-systems are very important in the field of [[complexity science]] and [[A-life]].
A universally accepted system for describing changes in plant morphology at the cellular or modular level has yet to be devised. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acm.org/crossroads/xrds8-2/plantsim.html|title=Simulating plant growth|accessdate=2009-10-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091209022645/http://www.acm.org/crossroads/xrds8-2/plantsim.html|archivedate=2009-12-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The most widely implemented tree-generating algorithms are described in the papers [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=218427 "Creation and Rendering of Realistic Trees"], and [http://www.springerlink.com/content/n0nacdyjpyvxnnef/ Real-Time Tree Rendering]
[[Image:Fractal weeds.jpg|thumb|300px|'Weeds', generated using an [[L-system]] in 3D.]]
The realistic modeling of plant growth is of high value to biology, but also for computer games.

==Theory + Algorithms==
A biologist, [[Aristid Lindenmayer]] (1925–1989) worked with [[yeast]] and filamentous [[fungi]] and studied the growth patterns of various types of algae, such as the blue/green bacteria [[Anabaena|''Anabaena catenula'']]. Originally the L-systems were devised to provide a formal description of the development of such simple multicellular organisms, and to illustrate the neighbourhood relationships between plant cells. Later on, this system was extended to describe higher plants and complex branching structures.
Central to L-systems, is the notion of rewriting, where the basic idea is to define complex objects by successively replacing parts of a simple object using a set of rewriting rules or productions. The rewriting can be carried out recursively. L-Systems are also closely related to [[Koch curves]].

===Environmental interaction===
A challenge for plant simulations is to consistently integrate environmental factors, such as surrounding plants, obstructions, water and mineral availability, and lighting conditions. 
is to build virtual/environments with as many parameters as computationally feasible, thereby, not only simulating the growth of the plant, but also the environment it is growing within, and, in fact, whole ecosystems.
Changes in resource availability influence plant growth, which in turn results in a change of resource availability. Powerful models and powerful hardware will be necessary to effectively simulate these [[Recursion|recursive]] interactions of recursive structures.

'''Social perception''' (or '''person perception''') is the study of how people form impressions of and make inferences about other people as sovereign personalities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; People learn about others' feelings and emotions by picking up information they gather from physical appearance, verbal, and [[nonverbal communication]]. [[Facial expression]]s, tone of voice, [[hand gesture]]s, and [[body language|body position]] or movement are just a few examples of ways people communicate without words. A real-world example of social perception is understanding that others disagree with what one said when one sees them roll their eyes. There are four main components of social perception: [[observation]], [[Attribution (psychology)|attribution]], integration, and confirmation.

Observations serve as the raw data of social perception—an interplay of three sources: persons, situations, and behavior. These sources are used as evidence in supporting a person's impression or inference about others. Another important factor to understand when talking about social perception is attribution. Attribution is expressing an individual's personality as the source or cause of their behavior during an event or situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/attribution-theory.html|title=Attribution Theory {{!}} Simply Psychology|website=www.simplypsychology.org|access-date=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; To fully understand the impact of personal or situational attributions, social perceivers must integrate all available information into a unified impression. To finally confirm these impressions, people try to understand, find, and create information in the form of various biases. Most importantly, social perception is shaped by an individual's current motivations, emotions, and [[Cognitive load|cognitive load capacity]]. Cognitive load is the complete amount of mental effort utilized in the [[working memory]]. All of this combined determines how people attribute certain traits and how those traits are interpreted.

The fascination and research for social perception date back to the late 1800s when [[social psychology]] was first being discovered. As more and more research on social perception is done, the realization of its significance in understanding and predicting our social world continues to grow. This overview article aims to inform readers about the processes of social perception along with brief descriptions to relevant and related theories.

== Observation ==
The processes of social perception begin with observing persons, situations, and behaviors to gather evidence that supports an initial impression.

=== Persons – physical influence ===
Although society tries to train people not to judge others based on their physical traits, as social perceivers, we cannot help but be influenced by others' hair, skin color, height, weight, style of clothes, pitch in voice, etc., when making a first impression. People have the tendency to judge others by associating certain facial features with specific personality types. For example, studies indicate that people are perceived as stronger, more assertive, and competent if they have small eyes, low eyebrows, an angular chin, wrinkled skin, and a small forehead. People tend to associate baby-faced people with impotence and harmlessness.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Situations – context from prior experiences ===
People are able to easily predict the sequences or results of an event based on the extent and depth of their past experiences with a similar event. The ability to anticipate the outcomes of a situation is also greatly influenced by an individual's cultural background because this inevitably shapes the types of experiences. Situational observations either lead humans to have preset notions about certain events or to explain the causes of human behaviors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Behaviors – nonverbal communication ===
Nonverbal communication helps people express their emotions, attitudes, and personalities. The most dominant form of nonverbal communication is the use of facial expressions to channel different emotions. Greatly influenced by [[Charles Darwin]]'s research on facial expressions and book ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals|The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals (1872)]]'', it is believed that all humans, regardless of culture or race, encode and decode the six "primary" emotions, (happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and disgust), universally in the same way. To encode means to communicate nonverbal behavior, while to decode means to interpret the meaning or intention of the nonverbal behavior. Decoding sometimes is inaccurate due to affect blend, (a facial expression with two differently registered emotions), and/or [[display rules]], (culturally dictated rules about which nonverbal behaviors are acceptable to display).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Other nonverbal cues such as: body language, eye contact, and vocal intonations can affect social perception by allowing for [[thin-slicing]]. Thin-slicing describes the ability to make quick judgements from finding consistencies in events based only on narrow frames of experience.

==Attribution==
With the observations drawn from persons, situations, and behavior, the next step is to make inferences that identify an individual's inner dispositions.

===Attribution theories===

A large component of social perception is [[Attribution (psychology)|attribution]]. Attribution is the use of information gathered through observation to help individuals understand and rationalize the causes of one's own and others' behaviors. Psychological research on attribution began with the work of [[Fritz Heider]] in 1958, and was subsequently developed by others such as [[Harold Kelley]] and [[Bernard Weiner]]. People make attributions to understand the world around them in order to seek reasons for an individual's particular behavior. When people make attributions they are able to make judgments as to what was the cause or causes of a certain behavior. Attribution theory is the study of what systems and models people implement to make attributions about the behavior of others. It attempts to explain how we use information about the social environment to understand others' behavior.

One common bias people exhibit in attribution is called the [[fundamental attribution error]]. The fundamental attribution error is the tendency for people to attribute others' actions or behaviors to internal traits as opposed to external circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ross|first=L.|date=1977|title=The intuitive psychologist and his shortcomings: Distortions in the attribution process|journal=Advances in Experimental Psychology|volume=10|pages=174–214}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of how this may manifest in the real world as pointed out in research by [[Adrian Furnham|Furnham]] and Gunter is how one's view of the justness of poverty may be affected by one's financial status: one who has not experienced poverty may see it as being more or less deserved than might someone who has been impoverished at some point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Furnham|first=A.F.|last2=Gunter|first2=B.|date=1984|title=Just world beliefs and attitudes towards the poor|journal=British Journal of Social Psychology|volume=23|pages=265–269|doi=10.1111/j.2044-8309.1984.tb00637.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, fundamental attribution error can be a barrier to empathizing with others, as one does not consider all the circumstances involved in the actions of others.

==== Two-step process of making attributions ====
Unlike conventional attribution theories, the two-step process of attribution suggests that people analyze others' behaviors first by automatically making an internal attribution and only then considering possible external attributions that may affect the initial inference.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Heider's most valuable contribution to the topic of attribution is the [[dichotomy]]: When attempting to decide why individuals behave a certain way, we can make either an internal or external attribution.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Psychology Seventh Edition|last=Aronson|first=Elliot|last2=Wilson|first2=Timothy D.|last3=Akert|first3=Robin M.|publisher=Pearson Education, Inc.|year=2010|isbn=0-13-814478-8|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|pages=83–115|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internal attribution, (also called [[dispositional attribution]] or personal attribution&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Psychology Seventh Edition|last=Kassin|first=Saul|last2=Fein|first2=Steven|last3=Markus|first3=Hazel Rose|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|year=2008|isbn=978-0-618-86846-9|location=Belmont, CA|pages=93–127|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), is the assumption that an individual is acting a certain way due to something about that individual, such as personality, character, or attitude. External attribution, also called [[situational attribution]], is the inference that an individual is acting a certain way due to the situation he or she is in; the assumption is that most individuals would respond in the same way in that similar situation. Essentially, people first assume that a person's behavior is due to his or her personality, and then attempt to modify this attribution by also factoring in the person's situation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Jones's correspondent inference theory ====
According to Edward Jones and Keith Davis's [[correspondent inference theory]], people learn about other individuals from behavior that is chosen freely, that is not anticipated, and that results in a small number of favorable outcomes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are three factors that people use as a basis for their inferences:
# An individual's degree of choice
# The expectedness of the behavior
# The intentions or motives behind the effects or consequences of the behavior

==== Kelley's covariation theory ====
According to American social psychologist [[Harold Kelley]], individuals make attributions by utilizing the [[covariation principle]]. The covariation principle claims that people attribute behavior to the factors that are present when a certain behavior occurs and the factors that are absent when it does not occur.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are three types of covariation information that are particularly helpful: consensus, distinctiveness, and consistency.

If a single individual and a large majority of individuals behave similarly in reaction to a specific stimulus, then the individual's behavior is attributed to the stimulus and is high in consensus. The individual's behavior due to this specific stimulus should be compared to the individual's behavior in reaction other stimuli within the same broader category. This helps judge whether the level of distinctiveness information is high, and thus attributed to the stimulus. Lastly, consistency information is used to see what happens to the behavior at another time when the individual and the stimulus both remain unchanged.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Integration ==
Unless a snap judgement is made from observing persons, situations, or behavior, people integrate the dispositions to form impressions.

===Information integration theory===
[[Norman H. Anderson]], an American social psychologist, developed the [[information integration theory]] in 1981. The theory states that impressions are made from the perceiver's personal dispositions and a weighted average of the target individual's characteristics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The differences among perceivers are due to people using themselves as a standard, or frame of reference, when judging or evaluating others. People also tend to view their own skills and traits as favorable for others to also have. These impressions formed about others can also be influenced by the current, temporary mood of the perceiver. A concept called, [[Priming (psychology)|priming]] also affects a perceiver's impressions of others. Priming is the tendency for recently perceived or implemented concepts or words to come to mind easily and influence the understanding of the new information.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Trait information also impacts people's impressions of others, and psychologist [[Solomon Asch]] was the first to discover that the existence of one trait tends to indicate the existence of other traits. Asch claimed that [[central trait]]s exist that exert a strong effect on the perceiver's overall impressions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lastly, the sequence in which a trait is realized can also influence the trait's impact. Research shows that there is a tendency for information presented at the beginning of a sequence to have a greater effect on impressions than information presented later on, a concept called [[primacy effect]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Implicit personality theory ===
[[Implicit personality theory]] is a type of model people use to group various kinds of personality qualities together.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Put in another way, implicit personality theories describe the way an observer uses the traits displayed by another person to form impressions about that other person. People pay attention to a variety of cues, including: visual, auditory, and verbal cues to predict and understand the personalities of others, in order to fill in the gap of the unknown information about a person, which assists with social interactions.

Certain traits are seen as especially influential in the formation of an overall impression of an individual; these are called [[Trait theory|central traits]]. Other traits are less influential in impression formation, and are called peripheral traits. Which traits are central or peripheral is not fixed, but can vary based on context. For instance, saying that a person is warm versus cold may have a central impact on an individual's impression formation when paired with traits such as "industrious" and "determined", but have a more peripheral impact when paired with traits such as "shallow" or "vain".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nauts|first=S.|last2=Langner|first2=O.|last3=Huijsmans|first3=I.|last4=Vonk|first4=R.|last5=Wigboldus|first5=D. H. J.|date=2014|title=Forming impressions of personality: A replication and review of Asch’s (1946) evidence for a primacy-of-warmth effect in impression formation|journal=Social Psychology|volume=45|issue=3|pages=153–163|doi=10.1027/1864-9335/a000179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kim and Rosenberg&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kim|first=M. P.|last2=Rosenberg|first2=S.|date=1980|title=Comparison of two structural models of implicit personality theory|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=38|issue=3|pages=375–389|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.38.3.375}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrate that when forming impressions of others, individuals assess others on an evaluative dimension. Which is to say that, when asked to describe personality traits of others, individuals rate others on a "good-bad" dimension. People's implicit personality theories also include a number of other dimensions, such as a "strong-weak" dimension, an "active-passive" dimension, an "attractive-unattractive" dimension, etc. However, the evaluative "good-bad" dimension was the only one that universally appeared in people's descriptions of others, while the other dimensions appeared in many, but not all, people's assessments. Thus, the dimensions included in implicit personality theories on which others are rated vary from person to person, but the "good-bad" dimension appears to be part of all people's implicit personality theories.

== Confirmation ==
After making and integrating attributions, individuals form impressions that are subject to confirmation biases and the threat of a [[self-fulfilling prophecy]].

=== Competence as social perceivers ===
It is true that people fall for the biases identified by social psychologists and for some biases that may have not yet been identified. Despite these misjudgments, there are four reasons that soundly demonstrate people's competence as social perceivers: 
# People can more accurately perceive social behaviors and interactions when they have a greater history of experiences with the other people.
# People can make more circumscribed predictions of how other individuals will act when in their presence. 
# Social perception skills can be improved through learning the rules of probability and logic. 
# People can make more precise inferences about others when motivated by concerns for open-mindedness and accuracy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Factors that influence social perception ===

==== Accuracy ====
The accuracy of social perception relates to the connection between judgments people make of others' psychological attributes, and the reality of those attributes with regards to the people being judged. There are three slightly varying approaches to interpreting accuracy the: pragmatic, constructivist, and realistic approaches. Empirical research suggests that social perception is mostly accurate, but the degree of accuracy is based on four major moderator variables. These moderators are attributes of the: judge, target, trait that is judged, and information on which the judgment is based. The [http://www.guwsmedical.info/rasch-model/the-realistic-accuracy-model-ram.html Realistic Accuracy Model (RAM)] explains that these moderators are a result of the process for accurate judgment. The process of accurate personality judgment starts with the target revealing relevant information, which then must be available to a judge, who then identifies and uses it to form a final judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences|last=Smelser|first=Neil J.|last2=Baltes|first2=Paul B.|publisher=Elsevier Ltd|year=2001|isbn=978-0-08-043076-8|location=|pages=11243–11246|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Difficulties in accuracy research =====
While accurate social perception is important, it has also been rather neglected. It is difficult to provide a set list of criteria that can be checked-off as accuracy can be subjective in nature. In the past, there was an assumption that people’s judgements were also considered erroneous and often mistaken. As such, many researchers have chosen to pursue other facets of research instead. It was not until these assumptions were proved incorrect through research and research methods became more sophisticated that genuine effort was put into analyzing accurate social perceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B0080430767017526|title=International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences|last=Funder|first=D.

===== Testing =====
TASIT (The Awareness of Social Inference Test) is an audiovisual test that In the past for the clinical assessment of social perception. The test is based upon several critical components of social perception that are crucial for social competence using complex, dynamic, visual, and auditory cues to assess these critical components. The test assesses the ability to identify emotions, a skill that is impaired in many clinical conditions. It also assesses the ability to judge what a speaker may be thinking or what their intentions are for the other person in the conversation, also referred to as [[theory of mind]]. Lastly, the test was developed to assess the ability to differentiate between literal and non-literal conversational remarks. The test is divided into three parts to measure; emotion, social inference – minimal, and social inference enriched. The test is composed of scenes, or vignettes, and those being assessed are asked to identify the emotions, a, feelings, beliefs, intentions, and meanings of the interactions. They are also assessed on more complex interactions to assess ability to interpret sarcasm.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McDonald|last2=Bornhofen|last3=Shum|last4=Long|last5=Saunders|last6=Neulinger|date=2006|title=Reliability and validity of The Awareness of Social Inference Test (TASIT): A clinical test of social perception|journal=Disability and Rehabilitation|volume=28|issue=24|pages=1529–1542|doi=10.1080/09638280600646185}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of this testing assess the level of social perception of an individual.

TASIT has adequate psychometric properties as a clinical test of social perception. It is not overly prone to practice effects and is reliable for repeat administrations. Performance on TASIT is affected by information processing speed, working memory, new learning and executive functioning, but the uniquely social material that comprises the stimuli for TASIT provides useful insights into the particular difficulties people with clinical conditions experience when interpreting complex social phenomena.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

==== Inaccuracy/distortions ====

=====Bias=====

People are prone to numerous types of confirmation biases—tendencies to construe, find, and formulate information in ways that prove existing opinions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Preconceived prejudices, stereotypes, and discrimination otherwise known as social biases can contribute towards these tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sritharan|first=R.|last2=Gawronski|first2=B.|date=2010|title=Changing implicit and explicit prejudice: Insights from the associative-propositional evaluation model|journal=Social Psychology|volume=41|issue=3|pages=113–123|doi=10.1027/1864-9335/a000017}}&lt;/ref&gt; People are also subject to exhibiting [[belief perseverance]], the tendency to hold false convictions even after they have been disproved.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====== Self ======
* [[Availability heuristic]] – Tendency to place more importance and reliance on more immediate memories when evaluating specific topics, methods, concepts, or decisions. It is a mental shortcut that operates on the notion that if something can be recalled, then it must at least be as important as alternatives that are less easily recalled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.verywell.com/availability-heuristic-2794824|title=What Is an Availability Heuristic?|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Dunning–Kruger effect]]&amp;nbsp;– An effect by which test takers fail to understand their poor performance because they suffer a double fault: A.)

If people perceive themselves as less similar, they rate the perpetrator as more culpable.&lt;ref name="Reference D"/&gt;
*[[Forer effect]] (Barnum effect)&amp;nbsp;– Placing high belief in a general, vague description thinking it was meant specifically for an individual. For instance, people interpret horoscopes as applying to their specific situation, when in actuality the horoscope was written to apply to a wide range of people's experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dickson|first=D.|last2=Kelly|first2=I.|date=1985|title=The "Barnum effect" in personality assessment: A review of the literature|journal=Psychological Reports|volume=57|issue=2|pages=367–382|doi=10.2466/pr0.1985.57.2.367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29851">The '''species problem''' is the set of questions that arises when [[biologist]]s attempt to define what a [[species]] is. Such a definition is called a '''species concept'''; there are at least 26 recognized species concepts.&lt;ref name=wilkins&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scienceblogs.com/evolvingthoughts/2006/10/01/a-list-of-26-species-concepts/ |title=A List of 26 Species Concepts |publisher=Science Blogs |first=John S. |last=Wilkins |date=1 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A species concept that works well for [[sexual reproduction|sexually reproducing]] organisms such as birds is useless for species that [[asexual reproduction|reproduce asexually]], such as bacteria. The scientific study of the species problem has been called '''microtaxonomy'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mayr, Ernst |authorlink=Ernst Mayr |year=1982  |title=The Growth of Biological Thought: Diversity, Evolution, and Inheritance |publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press  |isbn=9780674364462 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=pHThtE2R0UQC |chapter=Chapter 6: Microtaxonomy, the science of species}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One common, but sometimes difficult, question is how best to decide which species an [[organism]] belongs to, because reproductively isolated groups may not be readily recognizable, and [[Cryptic species complex|cryptic species]] may be present. There is a continuum from ''[[reproductive isolation]]'' with no interbreeding, to ''[[panmixis]]'', unlimited interbreeding. Populations can move forward or backwards along this continuum, at any point meeting the criteria for one or another species concept, and failing others.

Many of the debates on species touch on philosophical issues, such as [[nominalism]] and [[Philosophical realism|realism]], and on issues of [[language]] and [[cognition]].

The current meaning of the phrase "species problem" is quite different from what [[Charles Darwin]] and others meant by it during the 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Robson |first=G. C. |year=1928 |title=The Species Problem: an Introduction to the Study of Evolutionary Divergence in Natural Populations |publisher=Oliver and Boyd |location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Darwin, the species problem was the question of [[Speciation|how new species arose]]. Darwin was however one of the first people to question how well-defined species are, given that they constantly change.

== History ==
{{main article|Species}}

=== Before Darwin ===
The idea that one organism reproduces by giving birth to a similar organism, or producing seeds that grow to a similar organism, goes back to the earliest days of farming. While people tended to think of this as a relatively stable process, many thought that change was possible. The term ''species'' was just used as a term for a sort or kind of organism, until in 1686 [[John Ray]] introduced the biological concept that species were distinguished by always producing the same species, and this was fixed and permanent, though considerable variation was possible within a species.&lt;ref name=SpeciesKindsEvolution&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ncse.com/rncse/26/4/species-kinds-evolution |title=Species, Kinds, and Evolution |author= Wilkins, John S. |year=2006 |publisher=Reports of the [[National Center for Science Education]] |accessdate=2009-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scienceblogs.com/evolvingthoughts/2009/05/the_first_biological_species_c.php |title=The first biological species concept : Evolving Thoughts |author=Wilkins, John S. |date=May 10, 2009 |accessdate=2009-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515041359/http://scienceblogs.com/evolvingthoughts/2009/05/the_first_biological_species_c.php |archivedate=May 15, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Linnaeus|Carolus Linnaeus]] (1707–1778) formalized the [[taxon]]omic rank of species, and devised the two part naming system of [[binomial nomenclature]] that we use today. However, this did not prevent disagreements on the best way to identify species.

The history of definitions of the term "species"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Britton |first=N.L. |title=The taxonomic aspect of the species question |journal=[[The American Naturalist]] |volume=42 |issue=496 |pages=225–242 |date=April 1908 |doi=10.1086/278927}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mayr1982"/&gt; reveal that the seeds of the modern species debate were alive and growing long before Darwin.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The traditional view, which was developed by [[Arthur Cain|Cain]], [[Ernst Mayr|Mayr]] and [[David Hull|Hull]] in the mid-twentieth century, claims that until the ‘Origin of species’ by Charles Darwin both philosophy and biology considered species as invariable natural kinds with essential features. This ‘[[essentialism]] story’ was adopted by many authors, but questioned from the beginning by a minority … when [[Aristotle]] and the early naturalists wrote about the essences of species, they meant essential ‘functions’, not essential ‘properties’. Richards pointed out [Richard A. Richards, The Species Problem: A Philosophical Analysis, Cambridge University Press, 2010] that Linnaeus saw species as eternally fixed in his very first publication from 1735, but only a few years later he discovered hybridization as a modus for speciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Haveman, R. |year=2013 |title=Freakish patterns – species and species concepts in apomicts |journal=Nordic Journal of Botany |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=257–269 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1756-1051.2013.00158.x |doi=10.1111/j.1756-1051.2013.00158.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== From Darwin to Mayr ===

[[Charles Darwin]]'s famous book ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' (1859) offered an explanation as to how species [[evolution|evolve]], given enough time. Although Darwin did not provide details on how species can split into two, he viewed [[speciation]] as a [[gradualism|gradual process]]. If Darwin was correct, then, when new ''incipient species'' are forming, there must be a period of time when they are not yet distinct enough to be recognized as species. Darwin's theory suggested that there was often not going to be an objective fact of the matter, on whether there were one or two species.

Darwin's book triggered a crisis of uncertainty for some biologists over the objectivity of species, and some came to wonder whether individual species could be objectively real — i.e. have an existence that is independent of the human observer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Johnson |first=D.S. |date=April 1908 |title=[Introduction] |journal=[[The American Naturalist]] |volume=42 |issue=496 |page=217 |doi=10.1086/278925}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bailey |first=L.H. |date=December 1896 |title=The philosophy of species-making |journal=Botanical Gazette |volume=22 |issue=6 |pages=454–462 |doi=10.1086/327442}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s and 1930s, [[Gregor Mendel|Mendel's]] theory of inheritance and Darwin's theory of evolution by [[natural selection]] were joined in what was called the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]]. This conjunction of theories also had a large impact on how biologists think about species. [[Edward Bagnall Poulton|Edward Poulton]] anticipated many ideas on species that today are well accepted, and that were later more fully developed by [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]] and [[Ernst Mayr]], two of the architects of the modern synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mallet |first=James |authorlink=James Mallet |date=December 2003 |title=Perspectives Poulton, Wallace and Jordan: how discoveries in Papilio butterflies led to a new species concept 100 years ago |journal=Systematics and Biodiversity |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=441–452 |doi=10.1017/S1477200003001300}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dobzhansky's 1937 book&lt;ref name="dobzhansky1937"/&gt; articulated the genetic processes that occur when incipient species are beginning to diverge. In particular, Dobzhansky described the critical role, for the formation of new species, of the evolution of [[reproductive isolation]].

=== Mayr's ''Biological Species Concept'' ===

[[Ernst Mayr]]'s 1942 book was a turning point for the species problem.&lt;ref name="mayr1942"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mayr |first=Ernst |authorlink=Ernst Mayr |year=1942 |title=Systematics and the origin of species from the viewpoint of a zoologist |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-674-86250-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, he wrote about how different investigators approach species identification, and he characterized their approaches as species concepts. He argued for what came to be called the ''Biological Species Concept'' (BSC), that a species consists of populations of organisms that can reproduce with one another and that are reproductively isolated from other populations, though he was not the first to define "species" on the basis of reproductive compatibility.&lt;ref name="mayr1982"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mayr |first=E. |authorlink=Ernst Mayr |year=1982 |title=[[The Growth of Biological Thought]] |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, MA |isbn=0-674-36445-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Mayr discusses how [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]] proposed this kind of definition of "species" in 1753.
[[Dobzhansky|Theodosius Dobzhansky]] was a contemporary of Mayr and the author of a classic book about the evolutionary origins of reproductive barriers between species, published a few years before Mayr's.&lt;ref name="dobzhansky1937"/&gt; Many biologists credit Dobzhansky and Mayr jointly for emphasizing reproductive isolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mallet |first=James |authorlink=James Mallet |date=November 2001 |title=The speciation revolution |journal=[[Journal of Evolutionary Biology]] |volume=14 |issue=6 |pages=887–888 |url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/taxome/jim/pap/malletjeb01.pdf |doi=10.1046/j.1420-9101.2001.00342.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Coyne |first=Jerry |authorlink=Jerry Coyne |year=1994 |title=Ernst Mayr and the origin of species |journal=[[Evolution (journal)|Evolution]] |volume=48 |pages=19–30 |doi=10.2307/2409999 |issue=1 |publisher=Society for the Study of Evolution |jstor=2409999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Mayr's book, some two dozen species concepts were introduced. Some, such as the [[Species#Phylogenetic (cladistic) species|Phylogenetic Species Concept]] (PSC), were designed to be more useful than the BSC for describing species. Many authors have professed to "solve" or "dissolve" the species problem.&lt;ref name="pigliucci2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ghiselen1974"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ghiselin |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Ghiselin |date=December 1974 |title=A radical solution to the species problem |journal=Systematic Zoology |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=536–544 |doi=10.2307/2412471 |publisher=Society of Systematic Biologists |jstor=2412471}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=de Queiroz |first=K. |date=December 2005 |title=Different species problems and their resolution |journal=[[BioEssays]] |volume=27 |issue=12 |pages=1263–1269 |doi=10.1002/bies.20325 |pmid=16299765}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hey |first=J. |year=1997 |url=http://lifesci.rutgers.edu/~heylab/sconcept/introduction.html |title=A reduction of "species" and a resolution of the species problem |publisher=[[Rutgers University]], Department of Genetics |accessdate=2007-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ridley |first=Mark |authorlink=Mark Ridley (zoologist) |date=January 1989 |title=The cladistic solution to the species problem |journal=Biology and Philosophy |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=1–16 |doi=10.1007/BF00144036}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stamos |first=D.N. |year=2003 |title=The species problem: Biological species, ontology, and the metaphysics of biology |publisher=Lexington Books |location=Lanham |isbn=978-0-7391-0503-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vrana |first1=P. |last2=Wheeler |first2=W. |year=1992 |title=Individual organisms as terminal entities: Laying the species problem to rest |journal=[[Cladistics (journal)|Cladistics]] |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=67–72 |doi=10.1111/j.1096-0031.1992.tb00051.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophical aspects ==

=== Realism ===

[[Philosophical realism|Realism]], in the context of the species problem, is the philosophical position that species are real mind-independent entities, [[natural kind]]s. Mayr, a proponent of realism, attempted to demonstrate species exist as natural, extra-mental categories. He showed for example that the New Guinean tribesman classify 136 species of birds, which Western ornithologists came to independently recognize:

{{Quote|"I have always thought that there is no more devastating refutation of the nominalistic claims than the above mentioned fact that primitive natives in New Guinea, with a Stone Age culture, recognize as species exactly the same entities of nature as western taxonomists. If species were something purely arbitrary, it would be totally improbable for representatives of two drastically different cultures to arrive at the identical species delimitations."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Toward a New Philosophy of Biology]]'', p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Mayr's argument however has been criticized:

{{Quote|"The fact that independently observing humans see much the same species in nature does not show that species are real rather than nominal categories. The most it shows is that all human brains are wired up with a similar perceptual cluster statistic (Ridley, 1993). On this view we [humans] might have been ‘wired’ differently and different species might now be wired differently from us, so that no one wiring can be said to be ‘true’ or veridical."&lt;ref&gt;Stamos, D. N. (2003). ''The Species Problem''. Lexington Books. p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another position of realism is that natural kinds are demarcated by the world itself by having a unique property that is shared by all the members of a species, and none outside the group. In other words, a natural kind possesses an essential or intrinsic feature (“essence”) that is self-individuating and non-arbitrary. This notion has been heavily criticized as [[essentialism|essentialist]], but modern realists have argued that while biological natural kinds have essences, these need not be fixed and are prone to change through [[speciation]].&lt;ref&gt;Okasha, S. 2002. Darwinian metaphysics: Species and the question of essentialism. ''Synthese''. 131: 191–213.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mayr (1957) reproductive isolation or interbreeding "supplies an objective yardstick, a completely non-arbitrary criterion” and "describing a presence or absence relationship makes this species concept non-arbitrary". The BSC defines species as "groups of actually or potentially interbreeding natural populations, which are reproductively isolated from other such groups". From this perspective, each species is based on a property (reproductive isolation) that is shared by all the organisms in the species that objectively distinguishes them.

===Nominalism===

Some philosophical variants of [[nominalism]] propose that species are just names that people have assigned to groups of creatures but where the lines between species get drawn does not reflect any fundamental underlying biological cut-off point. In this view, the kinds of things that people have given names to, do not reflect any underlying reality. It then follows that species do not exist outside the mind, because species are just named abstractions. If species are not real, then it would not be sensible to talk about "the origin of a species" or the "evolution of a species". As recently at least as the 1950s, some authors adopted this view and wrote of species as not being real.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gregg |first=J.R. |date=November–December 1950 |title=Taxonomy, language and reality |journal=[[The American Naturalist]] |volume=84 |issue=819 |pages=419–435 |doi=10.1086/281639}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Burma |first=B.H. |year=1954 |chapter=Reality, existence, and classification: A discussion of the species problem |pages=193–209 |editor-last=Slobodchikoff |editor-first=C.N. |title=Concepts of species |publisher=Dowden, Hutchinson &amp; Ross |location=Stroudsburg, PA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A counterpoint to the nominalist views in regard to species, was raised by [[Michael Ghiselin]] who argued that an individual species is not a type, but rather an actual individual, an actual [[entity]].&lt;ref name="ghiselen1974"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ghiselin |first=M.T. |year=1997 |title=Metaphysics and the origin of species |publisher=State University of New York Press |location=Albany, NY |isbn=978-0-7914-3468-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea comes from thinking of a species as an evolving dynamic population. If viewed as an entity, a species would exist regardless of whether or not people have observed it and whether or not it has been given a name.

===Pragmatism===

A popular alternative view, [[pragmatism]], espoused by philosophers such as [[Philip Kitcher]] and [[John Dupre]] states while species do not exist in the sense of [[natural kind]]s, they are ''[[concept]]ually'' real and exist for convenience and for practical applications.&lt;ref&gt;Dupré, J. (2001). "In defence of classification". ''Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences''. 32: 203–219.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, regardless of which definition of species one uses, one can still quantitatively compare [[species diversity]] across regions or decades, as long as the definition is held constant within a study. This has practical importance in advancing [[biodiversity]] science and [[environmental science]].

===Language and the role of human investigators===

The nominalist critique of the view that kinds of things exist, raises for consideration the role that humans play in the species problem. For example, Haldane suggested that species are just mental abstractions.&lt;ref name="haldane1956"/&gt;

Several authors have noted the similarity between "species", as a word of ambiguous meaning, and points made by [[Wittgenstein]] on [[family resemblance]] concepts and the indeterminacy of language.&lt;ref name="pigliucci2003"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hull |first=D.L. |date=September 1978 |title=A matter of individuality |journal=[[Philosophy of Science (journal)|Philosophy of Science]] |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages=335–360 |doi=10.1086/288811 |url=http://www.phylosophy.org/Hull-Individuality-PoS1978.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jardine |first=N. |date=March 1969 |title=A logical basis for biological classification |journal=Systematic Zoology |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=37–52 |doi=10.2307/2412409 |publisher=Society of Systematic Biologists |jstor=2412409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jody Hey]] described the species problem as a result of two conflicting motivations by biologists:&lt;ref name="heyGCS2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hey2001"/&gt;
# to categorize and identify organisms;
# to understand the evolutionary processes that give rise to species.

Under the first view, species appear to us as typical natural kinds, but when biologists turn to understand species evolutionarily they are revealed as changeable and without sharp boundaries. [[Jody Hey|Hey]] argued that it is unrealistic to expect that one definition of "species" is going to serve the need for categorization and still reflect the changeable realities of evolving species.

=== Pluralism and monism ===

Many approaches to the species problem have attempted to develop one single common conception of what species are and of how they should be identified. It is thought that, if such a [[monism|monistic]] description of species could be developed and agreed upon, then the species problem would be solved. In contrast, some authors have argued for [[Scientific pluralism|pluralism]], claiming that biologists cannot have just one shared concept of species, and that they should accept multiple, seemingly incompatible ideas about species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dupré |first=J. |year=1999 |chapter=On the impossibility of a monistic account of species |pages=3–22 |editor-last=Wilson |editor-first=R.A. |title=Species: New Interdisciplinary Essays |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, MA |isbn=978-0-262-73123-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mishler |first1=B.D. |last2=Donoghue |first2=M.J. |date=December 1982 |title=Species concepts: A case for pluralism |journal=Systematic Zoology |volume=31 |issue=4 |pages=491–503 |doi=10.2307/2413371 |publisher=Society of Systematic Biologists |jstor=2413371}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ereshefsky |first=M. |date=December 1992 |title=Eliminative pluralism |journal=[[Philosophy of Science (journal)|Philosophy of Science]] |volume=59 |issue=4 |pages=671–690 |doi=10.1086/289701 |url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/289701}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Pigliucci |first1=Massimo |author1link=Massimo Pigliucci |title=Wittgenstein Solves (Posthumously) the Species Problem|url=https://philosophynow.org/issues/50/Wittgenstein_Solves_Posthumously_the_Species_Problem |publisher=Philosophy Now |accessdate=2 December 2016 |date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Hull]] however argued that pluralist proposals were unlikely to actually solve the species problem.&lt;ref name="Hull-Species" /&gt;

'''Straw-bale construction''' is a [[Building construction|building]] method that uses [[straw bale|bales of straw]] (commonly wheat, rice, rye and oats straw) as structural elements, [[building insulation]], or both. This construction method is commonly used in [[natural building]] or "brown" construction projects. Research has shown that straw-bale construction is a sustainable method for building, from the standpoint of both materials and energy needed for heating and cooling.&lt;ref&gt;Milutiene, Edita, et al. "increase in Buildings Sustainability Using Renewable materials and Energy." Clean Technologies &amp; Environmental policy 14.6 (2012): 1075-84.Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Advantages of straw-bale construction over conventional building systems include the renewable nature of straw, cost, easy availability, naturally fire-retardant and high insulation value.&lt;ref&gt;Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.

==History==
Straw houses have been built on the African plains since the [[Paleolithic]] Era. Straw bales were used in construction 400 years ago in Germany; and straw-thatched roofs have long been used in northern Europe and Asia. When European Settlers came to North America, [[Tipi|teepees]] were insulated in winter with loose straw between the inner lining and outer cover.&lt;ref name=viable&gt;Marks, Leanne R.  (2005).

Straw-bale construction was greatly facilitated by the mechanical hay baler, which was invented in the 1850s and was widespread by the 1890s.&lt;ref name=viable /&gt;  It proved particularly useful in the [[Sand Hills (Nebraska)|Nebraska Sandhills]]. Pioneers seeking land under the 1862 [[Homestead Act]] and the 1904 [[Kinkaid Act]] found a dearth of trees over much of Nebraska. In many parts of the state, the soil was suitable for [[Dugout (shelter)|dugouts]] and [[sod house]]s.&lt;ref name=custersurvey&gt;[http://www.nebraskahistory.org/histpres/reports/custer_county.pdf Nebraska Historic Buildings Survey: Custer County]  [http://www.nebraskahistory.org/index.htm Nebraska State Historical Society.]  Retrieved 2010-08-29.&lt;/ref&gt;
However, in the Sandhills, the soil generally made poor construction sod;&lt;ref name=nomform&gt;Spencer, Janet Jeffries and D. Murphy (1979).

in the few places where suitable sod could be found, it was more valuable for agriculture than as a building material.&lt;ref name=laststraw&gt;Hammett, Jerilou and Kingsley (1998).

The first documented use of hay bales in construction in Nebraska was a schoolhouse built in 1896 or 1897. Unfenced and unprotected by stucco or plaster, it was reported in 1902 as having been eaten by cows. To combat this, builders began plastering their bale structures; if cement or lime stucco was unavailable, locally obtained "gumbo mud" was employed.&lt;ref name=laststraw /&gt; Between 1896 and 1945, an estimated 70 straw-bale buildings, including houses, farm buildings, churches, schools, offices, and grocery stores had been built in the Sandhills.&lt;ref name=viable /&gt;  In 1990, nine surviving bale buildings were reported in [[Arthur County, Nebraska|Arthur]] and [[Logan County, Nebraska|Logan]] Counties,&lt;ref name=arthursurvey&gt;Kay, John, David Anthone, Robert Kay, and Christina Hugly (1990).

Since the 1990s straw-bale construction has been substantially revived, particularly in North America, Europe, and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Hollis | first=Murray | year=2005 | title=Practical Straw Bale Building | publisher=Landlinks Press | location=Collingwood | isbn=0-643-06977-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This revival is likely attributed to greater environmental awareness and the material's natural, non-toxic qualities, low [[embodied energy]], and relative affordability.  Straw-bale construction has encountered issues regarding building codes depending on the location of the building.&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn Henderson

However, in the USA, the introduction of Appendices S and R in the 2015 International Residential Code has helped to legitimize and improve understanding of straw-bale construction. In France, the approval in 2012 of professional rules for straw-building recognized it as “common technology” et qualifies for standard-insurance programs&lt;ref&gt;http://rfcp.fr/les-regles-professionnelles/&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Method==

Straw bale building typically consists of stacking rows of bales (often in [[Stretcher bond|running-bond]]) on a raised footing or [[Foundation (architecture)|foundation]], with a moisture barrier or capillary break between the bales and their supporting platform.&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Barbara|title=Building with Straw Bales: A Practical Guide for UK and Ireland|publisher=Green Books|location=Dartington, Totnes, Devon TQ9 6EB|year=2002|edition=2011|page=26|isbn=978-1-900322-51-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two types of straw-bales commonly used, those bound together with two strings and those with three.  The three string bale is the larger in all three dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Keefe |first=Chris |title=Straw Bale Design - Choosing the Right Size Straw Bales |url=http://www.strawbale.com/straw-bale-design-choosing-your-bales/ |publisher=Strawbale.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bale walls can be tied together with pins of [[bamboo]] or [[wood]] (internal to the bales or on their faces), or with surface wire meshes, and then [[stucco]]ed or [[plaster]]ed, either with a lime-based formulation or earth/clay render. The bales may actually provide the structural support for the building&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Malin |first=Nadav |title=Building With Straw Bale |publisher=.buildinggreen.com |date=1 May 1993 |accessdate=5 October 2013 |url=http://www.buildinggreen.com/auth/article.cfm/1993/5/1/Building-with-Straw-Bales/}}&lt;/ref&gt; ("[[load-bearing wall|load-bearing]]" or "Nebraska-style" technique), as was the case in the original examples from the late 19th century. The plastered bale assembly also can be designed to provide [[Lateral consonant|lateral]] and shear [[Support (structure)|support]] for wind and seismic loads.

[[File:Lehmverputztes Strohballenhaus.jpg|thumb|left|This straw bale house plastered with [[loam]] [[earthen plaster]] is located in [[Swalmen]], in the southeastern [[Netherlands]]]]
Alternatively, bale buildings can have a structural frame of other materials, usually lumber or timber-frame, with bales simply serving as insulation and plaster substrate, ("infill" or "non-loadbearing" technique), which is most often required in northern regions and/or in wet climates. In northern regions, the potential snow-loading can exceed the strength of the bale walls. In wet climates, the imperative for applying a vapor-permeable finish precludes the use of cement-based stucco. Additionally, the inclusion of a skeletal framework of wood or metal allows the erection of a roof prior to raising the bales, which can protect the bale wall during construction, when it is the most vulnerable to water damage in all but the most dependably arid climates. A combination of [[Framing (construction)|framing]] and load-bearing techniques may also be employed, referred to as "hybrid" straw bale construction.&lt;ref name=MacDonald&gt;{{cite book |last= Myhrman |first= Matts |author2=S.O. MacDonald  |title= Build it with Bales |publisher= Out on Bale |year= 1994 |isbn= 0-9642821-1-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Straw bale house03.jpg|thumb|right|Straw bale construction]]
Straw bales can also be used as part of a [[Spar and Membrane Structure]] (SMS) wall system in which lightly reinforced 5&amp;nbsp;- 8&amp;nbsp;cm (2 - 3") [[gunite]] or [[shotcrete]] skins are interconnected with extended "X" shaped light rebar in the head joints of the bales.&lt;ref&gt;Black, Gary, and Mannik, Henri, "Spar and Membrane Structure" The Last Straw journal, #17, Winter 1997&lt;/ref&gt; In this wall system the concrete skins provide structure, seismic reinforcing, and fireproofing, while the bales are used as leave-in [[formwork]] and insulation.

The [[University of Bath]] has completed a research programme which used ‘ModCell’ panels - pre-fabricated panels consisting of a wooden structural frame infilled with straw bales and rendered with a breathable lime-based system - to build 'BaleHaus', a straw bale construction on the university's campus. Monitoring work of the structure carried out by architectural researchers at the university has found that as well as reducing the environmental footprint, the construction offers other benefits, including healthier living through higher levels of thermal insulation and regulation of humidity levels. The group has published a number of research papers on its findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BaleHaus: innovation in straw bale building|url=http://www.bath.ac.uk/research/case-studies/balehaus-innovative-straw-bale-building|work=The University of Bath|accessdate=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically "field bales" (bales created on farms with baling machines) have been used, but recently higher-density "precompressed" bales (or "straw-blocks") are increasing the loads that may be supported. Oryzatech out of Goleta, California has been developing rice straw compressed block.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wilson |first=Alex |title=Lego Blocks from Straw |publisher=Buildinggreen.com |date=1 December 2009 |url=http://www.buildinggreen.com/auth/article.cfm/2009/12/1/Lego-Blocks-from-Straw/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Field bales might support around 900&amp;nbsp;kg per linear meter of wall (600&amp;nbsp;lb./ lin. ft.), but the high density bales bear up to 6000&amp;nbsp;kg per linear meter of wall (4,000&amp;nbsp;lb./lin.ft.), and more. The basic bale-building method is now increasingly being extended to bound modules of other oft-recycled materials, including tire-bales, cardboard, paper, plastic, and used carpeting. The technique has also been extended to bags containing "bales" of wood chips or [[rice-hull bagwall construction|rice hulls]].&lt;ref name=Steen /&gt;&lt;ref name=Magwood /&gt;

Straw bales have also been used in very energy efficient high performance buildings such as the S-House&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hans-Peter Petek |url=http://www.s-house.at/presentations.htm |title=S-House |publisher=S-house.at |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Austria which meets the Passivhaus energy standard. In South Africa, a five-star lodge made from 10,000 strawbales has housed luminaries such as Nelson Mandela and Tony Blair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inhabitat.com/five-star-didimala-lodge-is-the-world%E2%80%99s-largest-strawbale-building/ |title=Five Star Didimala Lodge Is The World’s Largest Strawbale Building! |publisher=Inhabitat |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Swiss Alps, in the little village of [[Nax|Nax Mont-Noble]], construction works have begun in October 2011 for the first hotel in Europe built entirely with straw bales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mayaguesthouse.wordpress.com/ |title=Blog about the first hotel built with straw bales |publisher=Mayaguesthouse.wordpress.com |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Harrison Vault,&lt;ref&gt;[http://skillful-means.com/pages/details.php?pid=14&amp;photonumber=1&amp;showphoto=vault01.jpg ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110621161559/http://skillful-means.com/pages/details.php?pid=14&amp;photonumber=1&amp;showphoto=vault01.jpg |date=June 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Joshua Tree, California, is engineered to withstand the high seismic loads in that area using only the assembly consisting of bales, lath and plaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/a/tippingmar.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=dGlwcGluZ21hci5jb218dG0tcHVibGljLWRvY3VtZW50c3xneDo1OTU1YWQ2NWU1ODRjNDRj |title=Google Drive Viewer |publisher=Docs.google.com |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique was used successfully for strawbale housing in rural China.&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/a/tippingmar.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=dGlwcGluZ21hci5jb218dG0tcHVibGljLWRvY3VtZW50c3xneDozMTcyM2VlMTdlZDQ1MTQ |title=Google Drive Viewer |publisher=Docs.google.com |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Straw bale domes along the Syrio-African rift at Kibbutz Lotan have an interior geodesic frame of steel pipes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kibbutzlotan.com/#!creative-ecology-eco-campus/cg14 EcoCampus, Center for Creative Ecology, Kibbutz Lotan]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Another method to reap the benefits of straw is to incorporate straw-bale walls into a pre-existing structure.&lt;ref&gt;Whitty, Cadmon.

==Thermal Properties==
Compressed straw bales have a wide range of documented R-value. R-value is a measurement of a materials insulating quality, higher the number the more insulating.  The reported R-value ranges from 17-55 (in American units) or 3-9.6 (in SI) depending on the study, differing wall designs could be responsible for wide range in R-value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buildinggreen.com/auth/article.cfm/1998/9/1/R-Value-of-Straw-Bales-Lower-Than-Previously-Reported/ |title=R-Value of Straw Bales Lower Than Previously Reported - EBN: 7:9 |publisher=Buildinggreen.com |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://aceee.org/proceedings-paper/ss98/panel01/paper04 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710075736/http://aceee.org/proceedings-paper/ss98/panel01/paper04 |date=July 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bale walls are typically coated with a thick layer of plaster, which provides a well-distributed [[thermal mass]], active on a short-term (diurnal) cycle. The combination of insulation and mass provide an excellent platform for [[passive solar building design]] for winter and summer.

Compressed and plastered straw bale walls are also resistant to fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecobuildnetwork.org/fire-test-video |title=Straw Bale Fire Test Video - Ecological Building Network |publisher=Ecobuildnetwork.org |accessdate=2014-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems with straw-bale==
Two significant problems related to straw-bale construction are moisture and [[mold]]. During the construction phase, buildings need to be protected from rain and from water leakages into the body of the walls.&lt;ref&gt;http://thesustainablehome.net/do-straw-bale-buildings-last/&lt;/ref&gt; If exposed to water, compressed straw may expand due to absorption of moisture. In turn, this can cause more cracking through which more moisture can infiltrate. Further damage to the wall can be caused by mold releasing potentially toxic spores into the wall cavities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=145304|year=2003|author1=Kuhn|first1=D. M.|title=Indoor Mold, Toxigenic Fungi, and Stachybotrys chartarum: Infectious Disease Perspective|journal=Clinical Microbiology Reviews|volume=16|issue=1|pages=144–172|last2=Ghannoum|first2=M. A.|doi=10.1128/CMR.16.1.144-172.2003|pmid=12525430}}&lt;/ref&gt; and into the air.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nachi.org/strawbalehomebasics2006.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In hot climates, where walls may have become internally dampened, internal temperatures may rise (due to decomposition of affected straw). While fire is generally considered a rare event, compressed straw or hay bales have the serious potential of undergoing spontaneous internal combustion.&lt;ref&gt;http://agriculture.vic.gov.au/agriculture/dairy/pastures-management/haystack-fires-spontaneous-combustion Vermin&lt;/ref&gt; Rats and mice can infiltrate straw bale homes during construction, so care must be taken to keep such animals out of the material. Other problems relate to straw dust which may cause breathing difficulties among people with allergies to straw or hay.&lt;ref&gt;http://envibuild.eu/archive/2014/proceedings2014/enviBUILD-2014-proceedings.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/298811-overview&lt;/ref&gt;

Several companies have developed prefabricated strawbale walls. A passive ecological house can easily be assembled with those panels.

'''Sustainable gardening''' includes the more specific sustainable landscapes, sustainable landscape design, [[sustainable landscaping]], [[sustainable landscape architecture]], resulting in sustainable sites. It comprises a disparate group of [[Horticulture|horticultural]] interests that can share the aims and objectives associated with the international post-1980s [[sustainable development]] and [[sustainability]] programs developed to address the fact that humans are now using natural biophysical resources faster than they can be replenished by nature.&lt;ref name=MEA&gt;Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005). ''Ecosystems and Human Well-being: Biodiversity Synthesis. Summary for Decision-makers''. pp.1-16. Washington, DC.: World Resources Institute. The full range of reports is available on the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment web site. [http://www.millenniumassessment.org/en/index.aspx]. Retrieved on: 2009-03-16&lt;/ref&gt; 

Included within this compass are those home gardeners, and members of the landscape and nursery industries, and municipal authorities, that integrate environmental, social, and economic factors to create a more sustainable future.

[[Organic gardening]] and the use of [[native plants]] are integral to sustainable gardening.&lt;ref name="cornucopia"&gt;[http://www.cornucopianetwork.org/Spring_2009.pdf "Sustainable Gardening: The New Generation of Eco-Friendly Gardening!", ''Cornucopia Network of New Jersey, Inc.

==Historical development==
{{Main|Sustainability|Sustainable development|}}
After the establishment of [[sustainable agriculture]] in the early 1980s it was some time before the emergence of Sustainable Horticulture (as sustainable ''production'' horticulture) at the International Society of Horticultural Science's First International Symposium on Sustainability in Horticulture held at the International Horticultural Congress in Toronto in 2002. This symposium produced "conclusions ... on Sustainability in Horticulture and a Declaration for the 21st Century".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.actahort.org/books/638/638_65.htm] Bertschinger, L. et al. (eds) (2004). Conclusions from the 1st Symposium on Sustainability in Horticulture and a Declaration for the 21st Century. In: Proc. XXVI IHC – Sustainability of Horticultural Systems. ''Acta Hort''. 638, ISHS, pp. 509-512. Retrieved on: 2009-03-16.&lt;/ref&gt; The principles and objectives outlined at this conference were discussed in more practical terms at the following conference at Seoul in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Lal, R.

Many of the eco-friendly principles and ideas espoused by sustainable gardens, landscapes and sites perpetuate sustainable practices established as a reaction to resource-intensive [[industrial agriculture]]. These practices were established as movements for self-sufficiency and small-scale farming based on a holistic systems approach and ecological principles. Included here would be: [[biodynamic agriculture]], [[no-till farming]], [[agroecology]], [[Fukuoka farming]], [[forest gardening]], [[organic gardening]] and others. On a larger scale there is the more recent "whole farm planning"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landcareonline.com/page.asp?pID=119] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219015654/http://landcareonline.com/page.asp?pID=119 |date=2009-02-19 }} ''Outline of the Whole Farm Planning philosophy and application''.

Perhaps the most influential of these approaches is [[permaculture]], established by Australians [[Bill Mollison]] and [[David Holmgren]] as both a design system and a loosely defined philosophy or lifestyle ethic.&lt;ref name="Holmgren, D. 2002"&gt;Holmgren, D. (2002). ''Permaculture, principles and pathways beyond sustainability''. Holmgren Design Services, Hepburn, Australia. {{ISBN|0-646-41844-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Permaculture shares many principles and practices of the above but not the broad philosophical base as indicated by the title of the 2002 publication ''Permaculture, principles and pathways beyond sustainability''.&lt;ref name="Holmgren, D. 2002"/&gt; The application of sustainability principles to the horticultural sphere has now become broadly accepted in commerce and academia.

==Definition==
The American Sustainable Sites Initiative&lt;ref name=SS&gt;[http://www.sustainablesites.org] American Society of Landscape Architects, Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center, University of Texas at Austin United States Botanic Garden. The sustainable sites initiative. ''Guidelines and performance benchmarks''. The sustainable sites initiative. Retrieved on: 2009-03-16.&lt;/ref&gt; is an interdisciplinary approach used by the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]], the [[Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center]] and the [[United States Botanic Garden]] to create voluntary national guidelines and performance benchmarks for sustainable land design, construction and maintenance practices: it was founded in 2005. Using the United Nations [[Brundtland Report]]’s definition of sustainable development as a model, it defines sustainability within its own sphere of reference as:&lt;blockquote&gt; … ''design, construction, operations and maintenance practices that meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs'' &lt;/blockquote&gt; by attempting to: &lt;blockquote&gt;
...''protect, restore and enhance the ability of landscapes to provide [[ecosystem services]] that benefit humans and other organisms''.&lt;ref&gt;The Sustainable Sites Initiative. American Society of Landscape Architects, Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center, University of Texas at Austin United States Botanic Garden. pg. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Principles and concepts==
Managing global biophysical cycles and ecosystem services for the benefit of humans, other organisms and future generations has now become a global human responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations. 1987.[https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/42/ares42-187.htm "Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development."] General Assembly Resolution 42/187, 11 December 1987. Retrieved: 2009-03-03&lt;/ref&gt; The method of applying sustainability to gardens, landscapes and sites is still under development and varies somewhat according to the context under consideration. However, there are a number of basic and common underlying biological and operational principles and practices in the sustainable sites literature.

===Biological principles===
Sustainable management of man-made landscapes emulates the natural processes that sustain the biosphere and its ecosystems. First and foremost is the harnessing the energy of the Sun and the cycling of materials thereby minimising waste and energy use.

Running within, and dependent on, the natural economy there is the production and consumption of goods and services in the “human economy” which has now significantly altered, in a detrimental way, natural biogeochemical cycles (notable here are the [[water cycle]], [[carbon cycle]] and [[nitrogen cycle]] so sustainable practices maximise support for ecosystem services.&lt;ref name="MEA" /&gt;

====Native plants====
The use of [[native plants]] in a garden or landscape can both preserve and protect natural ecosystems, and reduce the amount of care and energy required to maintain a healthy garden or landscape. Native plants are adapted to the local climate and geology, and often require less maintenance than exotic species. Native plants also support populations of native birds, insects, and other animals that they [[coevolved]] with, thus promoting a healthy [[Community (ecology)|community]] of organisms.&lt;ref name="cornucopia" /&gt;

Plants in a garden or maintained landscape often form a [[Source-sink dynamics|source population]] from which plants can colonize new areas. Avoiding the use of [[invasive species]] helps to prevent such plants from establishing new populations. Similarly, the use of native species can provide a valuable source to help these plants colonise new areas.

Some non-native species can form an [[ecological trap]] in which native species are lured into an environment that appears attractive but is poorly suited to them.

However, in Britain research by the University of Sheffield as part of the BUGS project (Biodiversity in Urban Gardens in Sheffield) [http://www.bugs.group.shef.ac.uk] has revealed that for many invertebrates - the majority of wild animals in most gardens - it is not just native plants which can sustain them. The findings were published in popular form in Ken Thompson's book 'No Nettles Required: The truth about wildlife gardening'[https://web.archive.org/web/20100602032208/http://www.rbooks.co.uk/product.aspx?id=1905811144]. He confirms the approach which Chris Baines had promoted in 'How to Make a Wildlife Garden' [http://www.franceslincoln.co.uk/en/C/0/Book/213/How_to_Make_a_Wildlife_Garden.html].

===Operational principles===
Enhancement of ecosystem services is encouraged throughout the lifecycle of any site by providing clear design, construction, (operations), and management criteria.&lt;ref name="SS" /&gt; To be sustainable over the long term requires environmental, social and economic demands are integrated to provide intergenerational equity by providing regenerative sustainable systems. Operational guidelines will link to and supplement existing guidelines for the built environment (supplementing existing green building and landscape guidelines),&lt;ref name="SS" /&gt; the wider environment, and they will include metrics (benchmarks, audits, criteria, indexes etc.) that give some [[sustainability measurement|measure of sustainability]] (a rating system) by clarifying what is sustainable or not sustainable or, more likely, what is more or less sustainable.

====Scale====
Impacts of a site can be assessed and measured over any spatio-temporal scale or context.

====Direct and indirect environmental impact====
Impacts of a site may be ''direct'' by having direct measurable impacts on biodiversity and ecology at the site itself or ''indirect'' when impacts occur away from the site.

===Site principles===
[[File:Compost heap, Kew Gardens - geograph.org.uk - 215033.jpg|thumb|[[Compost]] heap at the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]]]]
The following are some site principles for sustainable gardening:&lt;ref name="SS" /&gt;
* Do no harm
* Use the [[Precautionary principle]]
* Design with nature and culture
* Use a decision-making hierarchy of preservation, conservation, and regeneration
* Provide regenerative systems as [[intergenerational equity]]
* Support a living process
* Use a system thinking approach
* Use a collaborative and ethical approach
* Maintain integrity in leadership and research
* Foster environmental stewardship

==Measuring site sustainability==
One major feature distinguishing the approach of sustainable gardens, landscapes and sites from other similar enterprises is the quantification of site sustainability by establishing performance benchmarks. Because sustainability is such a broad and inclusive concept the environmental impacts of sites can be categorised in numerous ways depending on the purpose for which the figures are required. The process can include minimising negative environmental impacts and maximising positive impacts. As currently applied the environment is usually given priority over social and economic factors which may be added in or regarded as an inevitable and integral part of the management process. A home gardener is likely to use simpler metrics than a professional landscaper or ecologist.

Three methodologies for measuring site sustainability include [[BREEAM]] developed by the BRE organisation in the UK, Leed, developed in America and the Oxford 360 degree sustainability Index used in Oxford Park and developed by the Oxford Sustainable Group in Scandinavia.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The ''Sustainable Sites Initiative''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sustainablesites.org/ |title=Sustainable Sites Initiative |publisher=Sustainablesites.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; is producing recommendations for the American Landscape Industry. The standards and guidelines finally adopted will lead to a uniform national standard, which does not currently exist. Sustainable Sites is currently in the pilot program stage, and will formally introduce its first rating system by 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sustainable Sites FAQs|url=http://www.sustainablesites.org/faqs/|accessdate=7 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Green Building Council supports the project and plans to adopt the Sustainable Sites metrics into future versions of its Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Green Building Rating System. Sites are rated according to their impact on ecosystem services:&lt;ref name="SS" /&gt; The following ecosystem services have been identified by the study group:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14004">'''Tomasulo’s algorithm''' is a [[computer architecture]] hardware [[algorithm]] for dynamic scheduling of instructions that allows [[out-of-order execution]] and enables more efficient use of multiple execution units. It was developed by [[Robert Tomasulo]] at [[IBM]] in 1967 and was first implemented in the [[IBM System/360 Model 91]]’s [[floating point unit]].

The major innovations of Tomasulo’s algorithm include [[register renaming]] in hardware, [[reservation station|reservation stations]] for all execution units, and a common data bus (CDB) on which computed values broadcast to all reservation stations that may need them. These developments allow for improved [[parallel computing|parallel execution]] of instructions that would otherwise stall under the use of [[scoreboarding]] or other earlier algorithms.

[[Robert Tomasulo]] received the [[Eckert–Mauchly Award]] in 1997 for his work on the algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation concepts==
[[File:Tomasulo Architecture.png|thumb|right|700px|Tomasulo's floating point unit]]
The following are the concepts necessary to the implementation of Tomasulo's Algorithm:

===Common data bus===
The Common Data Bus (CDB) connects reservation stations directly to functional units. According to Tomasulo it "preserves precedence while encouraging concurrency".&lt;ref name="tomasulo"&gt;
 {{cite journal
 | last1 = Tomasulo | first1 = Robert Marco
 | author1-link = Robert Marco Tomasulo
 | title = An Efficient Algorithm for Exploiting Multiple Arithmetic Units 
 | journal = IBM Journal of Research and Development
 | volume = 11
 | issue = 1
 | pages = 25–33
 | publisher = IBM
 | date = Jan 1967
 | issn = 0018-8646
 | doi = 10.1147/rd.111.0025 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|33}} This has two important effects:
#Functional units can access the result of any operation without involving a floating-point-register, allowing multiple units waiting on a result to proceed without waiting to resolve contention for access to register file read ports. 
#Hazard Detection and control execution are distributed. The reservation stations control when an instruction can execute, rather than a single dedicated hazard unit.

===Instruction order===
Instructions are issued sequentially so that the effects of a sequence of instructions, such as [[exception (computing)|exception]]s raised by these instructions, occur in the same order as they would on an in-order processor, regardless of the fact that they are being executed out-of-order (i.e. non-sequentially). 

===Register renaming===
Tomasulo's Algorithm uses [[register renaming]] to correctly perform out-of-order execution. All general-purpose and reservation station registers hold either a real value or a placeholder value. If a real value is unavailable to a destination register during the issue stage, a placeholder value is initially used. The placeholder value is a tag indicating which reservation station will produce the real value. When the unit finishes and broadcasts the result on the CDB, the placeholder will be replaced with the real value.

Each functional unit has a single reservation station. Reservation stations hold information needed to execute a single instruction, including the operation and the operands. The functional unit begins processing when it is free and when all source operands needed for an instruction are real.

===Exceptions===
Practically speaking, there may be exceptions for which not enough status information about an exception is available, in which case the processor may raise a special exception, called an "imprecise" exception. Imprecise exceptions cannot occur in non-[[Out-of-order execution|OoOE]] implementations, as processor state is changed only in program order (see [[Classic_RISC_pipeline#Exceptions|RISC Pipeline Exceptions]]).

Programs that experience "precise" exceptions, where the specific instruction that took the exception can be determined, can restart or re-execute at the point of the exception. However, those that experience "imprecise" exceptions generally cannot restart or re-execute, as the system cannot determine the specific instruction that took the exception.

==Instruction lifecycle==
The three stages listed below are the stages through which each instruction passes from the time it is issued to the time its execution is complete.

===Register legend===

*Op - represents the operation being performed on operands
*Qj, Qk - the reservation station that will produce the relevant source operand (0 indicates the value is in Vj, Vk)
*Vj, Vk - the value of the source operands
*A - used to hold the memory address information for a load or store
*Busy - 1 if occupied, 0 if not occupied
*Qi - (Only register unit) the reservation station whose result should be stored in this register (if blank or 0, no values are destined for this register)

===Stage 1: issue===
In the issue stage, instructions are issued for execution if all operands and reservation stations are ready or else they are stalled. Registers are renamed in this step, eliminating WAR and WAW hazards.

*Retrieve the next instruction from the head of the instruction queue. If the instruction operands are currently in the registers, then
**If a matching functional unit is available, issue the instruction.
**Else, as there is no available functional unit, stall the instruction until a station or buffer is free.
*Otherwise, we can assume the operands are not in the registers, and so use virtual values. The functional unit must calculate the real value to keep track of the functional units that produce the operand.

===Stage 2: execute===

In the execute stage, the instruction operations are carried out. Instructions are delayed in this step until all of their operands are available, eliminating RAW hazards. Program correctness is maintained through effective address calculation to prevent hazards through memory.

*If one or more of the operands is not yet available then: wait for operand to become available on the CDB.
*When all operands are available, then: if the instruction is a load or store
**Compute the effective address when the base register is available, and place it in the load/store buffer
***If the instruction is a load then: execute as soon as the memory unit is available
***Else, if the instruction is a store then: wait for the value to be stored before sending it to the memory unit
*Else, the instruction is an [[arithmetic logic unit]] (ALU) operation then: execute the instruction at the corresponding functional unit

In the write Result stage, ALU operations results are written back to registers and store operations are written back to memory.
* If the instruction was an ALU operation
** If the result is available, then: write it on the CDB and from there into the registers and any reservation stations waiting for this result
* Else, if the instruction was a store then: write the data to memory during this step

==Algorithm improvements==
The concepts of reservation stations, register renaming, and the common data bus in Tomasulo's algorithm presents significant advancements in the design of high-performance computers.

Reservation stations take on the responsibility of waiting for operands in the presence of data dependencies and other inconsistencies such as varying storage access time and circuit speeds, thus freeing up the functional units. This improvement overcomes long floating point delays and memory accesses. In particular the algorithm is more tolerant of cache misses. Additionally, programmers are freed from implementing optimized code. This is a result of the common data bus and reservation station working together to preserve dependencies as well as encouraging concurrency.&lt;ref name="tomasulo"/&gt;{{rp|33}}

By tracking operands for instructions in the reservation stations and register renaming in hardware the algorithm minimizes [[Read after write (Hazard)|read-after-write]] (RAW) and eliminates [[Write after write (hazard)#Write_after_write_.28WAW.29|write-after-write]] (WAW) and [[Write after read (hazard)#Write_after_read_.28WAR.29|Write-after-Read]] (WAR) [[computer architecture]] [[hazard (computer architecture)|hazard]]s. This improves performance by reducing wasted time that would otherwise be required for stalls.&lt;ref name="tomasulo"/&gt;{{rp|33}}

An equally important improvement in the algorithm is the design is not limited to a specific pipeline structure. This improvement allows the algorithm to be more widely adopted by multiple-issue processors. Additionally, the algorithm is easily extended to enable branch speculation.&lt;ref name="hennessy" /&gt; {{rp|182}}

== Applications and legacy ==
Tomasulo's algorithm, outside of IBM, was unused for several years after its implementation in the System/360 Model 91 architecture. However, it saw a vast increase in usage during the 1990s for 3 reasons:
# Once caches became commonplace, the Tomasulo algorithm's ability to maintain concurrency during unpredictable load times caused by cache misses became valuable in processors.
# Dynamic scheduling and the branch speculation that the algorithm enables helped performance as processors issued more and more instructions.
# Proliferation of mass-market software meant that programmers would not want to compile for a specific pipeline structure. The algorithm can function with any pipeline architecture and thus software requires few architecture-specific modifications.&lt;ref name="hennessy" /&gt; {{rp|183}}

Many modern processors implement dynamic scheduling schemes that are derivative of Tomasulo’s original algorithm, including popular [[Intel]] [[x86-64]] chips.&lt;ref name="intel" &gt;{{Cite report

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7127">'''Triadic closure''' is a concept in [[social network]] theory, first suggested by [[Germany|German]] [[sociology|sociologist]] [[Georg Simmel]] in his 1908 book ''Soziologie'' [''Sociology: Investigations on the Forms of Sociation''].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/17/style/17facebook.html?pagewanted=print Georg Simmel], originator of the concept: "Facebook" article at [[the New York Times]] website. Retrieved on December 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Triadic closure is the property among three nodes A, B, and C, such that if a strong tie exists between A-B and A-C, there is a weak or strong tie between B-C.&lt;ref&gt;[http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/complexity/course/emergence06/bookreviews/kmaffei.html Working concept] of triadic closure: book review of [[Duncan Watts]]' "[[Six Degrees: The Science of a Connected Age]]" at the ''Serendip'' ([[Bryn Mawr College]]) website. Retrieved on December 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This property is too extreme to hold true across very large, complex networks, but it is a useful simplification of reality that can be used to understand and predict networks.&lt;ref name=Easley&gt;Easley, D, &amp; Kleinberg, J. (2010). Networks, crowds, and markets: reasoning about a highly connected world. Cornell, NY: Cambridge Univ Pr.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Triadic closure was made popular by [[Mark Granovetter]] in his 1973 article ''The Strength of Weak Ties''.&lt;ref&gt;Granovetter, M. (1973). "[http://www.stanford.edu/dept/soc/people/mgranovetter/documents/granstrengthweakties.pdf The Strength of Weak Ties] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216103216/http://www.stanford.edu/dept/soc/people/mgranovetter/documents/granstrengthweakties.pdf |date=2008-02-16 }}", American Journal of Sociology, Vol. 78, Issue 6, May 1360-80.&lt;/ref&gt; There he synthesized the theory of [[cognitive balance]] first introduced by [[Fritz Heider]] in 1946 with a Simmelian understanding of social networks. In general terms, cognitive balance refers to the propensity of two individuals to want to feel the same way about an object. If the triad of three individuals is not closed, then the person connected to both of the individuals will want to close this triad in order to achieve closure in the relationship network.

==Measurements==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2009}}
The two most common measures of triadic closure for a graph are (in no particular order) the [[clustering coefficient]] and transitivity for that graph.

===Clustering coefficient===
One measure for the presence of triadic closure is [[clustering coefficient]], as follows:

Let &lt;math&gt;G = (V,E)&lt;/math&gt; be an undirected simple graph (i.e., a graph having no self-loops or multiple edges) with V the set of vertices and E the set of edges. Also, let &lt;math&gt;N = |V|&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M = |E|&lt;/math&gt; denote the number of vertices and edges in G, respectively, and let &lt;math&gt;d_i&lt;/math&gt; be the [[degree (graph theory)|degree]] of vertex i.

Then we can define a triangle among the triple of vertices &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; to be a set with the following three edges: {(i,j), (j,k), (i,k)}. Then we can define the number of triangles that vertex &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is involved in as &lt;math&gt;\delta (i)&lt;/math&gt; and, as each triangle is counted three times, we can express the number of triangles in G as &lt;math&gt;\delta (G) = \frac{1}{3} \sum_{i\in V} \ \delta (i)&lt;/math&gt;. Assuming that triadic closure holds, only two strong edges are required for a triple to form and the number of triples of vertex i is &lt;math&gt;\tau (i) = \binom{d_i}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, assuming &lt;math&gt;d_i \ge 2&lt;/math&gt;. Thus we can express &lt;math&gt;\tau (G) = \frac{1}{3} \sum_{i\in V} \ \tau (i)&lt;/math&gt;.

Now, for a vertex &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;d_i \ge 2&lt;/math&gt;, the [[clustering coefficient]] &lt;math&gt;c(i)&lt;/math&gt; of vertex &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of triples for vertex &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; that are closed, and can be measured as &lt;math&gt;\frac{\delta (i)}{\tau (i)}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the [[clustering coefficient]] &lt;math&gt;C(G)&lt;/math&gt; of graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;math&gt;C(G) = \frac {1}{N_2} \sum_{i \in V, d_i \ge 2} c(i)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;N_2&lt;/math&gt; is the number of nodes with degree at least 2.

===Transitivity===
Another measure for the presence of triadic closure is transitivity, defined as &lt;math&gt;T(G) = \frac{3\delta (G)}{\tau (G)}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Causes and effects==
In a trust network, triadic closure is likely to develop due to the transitive property. If a node A trusts node B, and node B trusts node C, node A will have the basis to trust node C. In a social network, strong triadic closure occurs because there is increased opportunity for nodes A and C with common neighbor B to meet and therefore create at least weak ties. Node B also has the incentive to bring A and C together to decrease the latent stress in two separate relationships.&lt;ref name=Easley/&gt;

Networks that stay true to this principle become highly interconnected and have very high clustering coefficients. However, networks that do not follow this principle turn out to be poorly connected and may suffer from instability once negative relations are included.

Triadic closure is a good model for how networks will evolve over time. While simple graph theory tends to analyze networks at one point in time, applying the triadic closure principle can predict the development of ties within a network and show the progression of connectivity.&lt;ref name=Easley/&gt;

In social networks, triadic closure facilitates cooperative behavior, but when new connections are made via
referrals from existing connections the average global fraction of cooperators is less than when individuals choose new connections randomly from the population at large. Two possible effects for this are by the structural and informational construction. The structural construction arises from the propensity toward high clusterability. The informational construction comes from the assumption that an individual knows something about a friend's friend, as opposed to a random stranger.

==Strong Triadic Closure Property and local bridges==
Strong Triadic Closure Property is that if a node has strong ties to two neighbors, then these neighbors must have at least a weak tie between them. A [[local bridge]] occurs, on the other hand, when a node is acting as a gatekeeper between two neighboring nodes who are not otherwise connected. In a network that follows the Strong Triadic Closure Property, one of the ties between nodes involved in a local bridge needs to be a weak tie.

===Proof by contradiction===

Let node B be a local bridge between nodes A and C such that there is no weak tie between the nodes involved. Therefore, B has a strong tie to both A and C. By the definition of Strong Triadic Closure, a weak tie would develop between nodes A and C. However, this contradicts the fact that B is a local gatekeeper. Thus at least one of the nodes involved in a local bridge needs to be a weak tie to prevent triadic closure from occurring.&lt;ref name=Easley/&gt;

'''The UN Counter-Terrorism Office''' was approved in a resolution on June 15, 2017 with the consensus of the 193-nation [[UN General Assembly]]. The creation of the office was also welcomed by [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] [[António Guterres]]' initiative to transfer relevant functions out of the UN [[Department of Political Affairs]] (DPA) and into the new United Nations Office of [[Counter-Terrorism]].&lt;ref name="un"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/counterterrorism/ctitf/en/general-assembly-approves-creation-new-un-counter-terrorism-office|title=General Assembly approves creation of new UN Counter-Terrorism Office &amp;#124; Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force|website=un.org|accessdate=2018-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Chief UN spokesman [[Stephane Dujarric]], the secretary-general welcomed the adoption of the General Assembly resolution "which endorsed his proposal to establish a new UN Office of Counter-Terrorism."
"The Secretary-General considers counter-terrorism and prevention of [[violent extremism]] to be one of the highest priorities of the [[United Nations]] to address a growing threat to international peace and security," Dujarric said.
"He therefore hopes that this reform of the UN Counter-Terrorism architecture will contribute to the UN's broader efforts to promote conflict prevention, sustainable peace and development”, he added.&lt;ref name="un2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/counterterrorism/|website=un.org|title=United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism|accessdate=2018-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6714">The '''Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence''' is a position within the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] responsible for directing the Treasury's efforts to cut the lines of financial support for terrorists, fight financial crime, enforce economic sanctions against [[rogue nations]], and combat the financial support of the proliferation of [[weapons of mass destruction]]. The Under Secretary is appointed by the [[President of the United States|President]] and confirmed by the [[United States Senate|Senate]].

The current Under Secretary is [[Sigal Mandelker]], appointed by President [[Donald Trump]], and confirmed to the position by the Senate on June 21, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.congress.gov/nomination/115th-congress/172&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Overview==
The Under Secretary heads the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence (TFI), created under 31 USC 312, when the administration of President [[George W. Bush|Bush]] announced on May 8, 2004, that the Executive Office of Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes (TFFC), the [[Financial Crimes Enforcement Network]] (FinCEN), the [[Office of Foreign Assets Control]] (OFAC), and allocated resources from the Treasury Department would be brought under the new office's control. The Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence also possesses oversight of the Office of Intelligence and Analysis, created under 31 USC 311, [one of sixteen agencies in the United States Intelligence Community per 50 USC 3003]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Bush Administration Announces Creation of New Office in Ramped up Effort to Fight the Financial War on Terror | url=http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/js1219.htm | accessdate= September 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Federal Reserve]] remains outside the jurisdiction of this office, and cannot be investigated by it.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}.

==History==
The position's predecessor, the Under Secretary for Enforcement, managed law enforcement aspects of the Department prior to the reorganization. The Under Secretary for Enforcement provided oversight and policy guidance for the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms]], the [[U.S. Customs Service]], the [[Federal Law Enforcement Training Center]]; the [[Financial Crimes Enforcement Network]], the [[U.S. Secret Service]], the Executive Office for Asset Forfeiture, and the [[Office of Foreign Assets Control]]. The Under Secretary also provided policy guidance over the [[Internal Revenue Service]]'s Crime Investigation.&lt;ref name="b"&gt;{{cite web | title=U.S. Treasury - Biography of Jimmy Gurule, Under Secretary for Enforcement | url=http://www.treas.gov/organization/bios/gurule-e.html | accessdate= September 21, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071003045324/http://www.treas.gov/organization/bios/gurule-e.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = October 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=U.S. Treasury - Duties &amp; Functions of the Under Secretary of Enforcement | url=http://www.treas.gov/education/duties/treas/u-sec-enforcement.shtml  | accessdate= February 13, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060213064754/http://www.treas.gov/education/duties/treas/u-sec-enforcement.shtml |archivedate = February 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of these agencies are now non-existent or have been moved into other federal departments.

'''Vyapti''', a [[Sanskrit]] expression, in [[Hindu philosophy]] refers to the state of pervasion. It is considered as the logical ground of [[inference]] which is one of the means to [[knowledge]]. No [[Logical consequence|conclusion]] can be inferred without the knowledge of vyapti. Vyapti guarantees the truth of conclusion. It signifies the relation of invariable concomitance between "''hetu''" and "''sadhya''" and is of two kinds. Vyapti between terms of unequal extension is called "''asamavyavyapti''" or "''visamavyapti''", and vyapti between equal extensions is called "''samavyapti''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Companion Encyclopaedia of Hindu philosophy|author= Subodh kapoor|publisher=Genesis Publishing (P) Ltd.|page=68|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JZWdEymxyp4C&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=vyapti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=akw9UbCIDoT_rAecs4GABw&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=vyapti&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vyapti is a universal statement that expresses the "''niyata sahacharya''" or relation of constant concomitance between ''hetu'' or the middle term and ''sadhya'' or the major term and implies the "''sahacara''" i.e. the knowledge of invariable relation of causality or co-existence between ''sadhya'' and ''hetu'' in all the three instances of time, which is possible when the "''anupadhik sambandha''" i.e. relation of unconditionality between the two is known. It is defined as the unconditional and constant concomitant relation between "''vyapya''", the pervaded, and "''vyapaka''", the pervader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Essay:Vyapti is considered as the ground of inferences|url=http://www.preservearticles.com/2011091413427/essay-vyapti-is-considered-as-the-ground-of-inferences.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Charvaka]] school of Hindu philosophy while admitting the existence of the world and denying pre-existence rejects inference and testimony; they recognize perception as the only means to knowledge. They hold the view that the universal concomitance of the middle term with the major term can never be known since their agreement in presence and agreement in absence can never be known as also their invariable concomitance because there are no class-characters and universals. Vyapti can never be known because it does not exist. If inductive inference is proved by vyapti then these two cannot be mutually dependent.

The [[Nyaya]] school of [[Aksapada Gautama|Gautama]] speaks of five-membered inference or "''pararthanumana''". Knowledge of vyapti is considered by this school to be the cause of successful inference because inference depends upon the unconditional universal concomitance between the middle term and the major term, the middle term indicating the existence of the major term, and is to be found in the minor term or "''paksa''", the subject of inference. It is not possible to perceive all instances of the middle term and the major term nor can vyapti be known by internal perception. In order for the inference to be sound the major and the minor premises have to be true, the former should be secure because the latter’s truth is given by perception. They hold the view that vyapti is the unconditional uniform relation of the [[reason]] to the [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] and that a condition pervades the predicate. Faulty reasons such as inconclusive ("''savyabhicara''"), contradictory ("''viruddha''"), counterbalanced ("''prakaranasama''"), unproved ("''sadhyasama''"), and mistimed ("''atitkala''") or contradicted ("''badhita''') hinder the production of a valid inference when they are known. Vyapti is known by the joint method of agreement in presence and agreement in absence based on repeated observation aided by favourable hypothetical reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Outlines of Indian Philosophy|author=Jadunath Sinha|publisher=Pilgrims Book (P) Ltd.|page=64,220|url=http://www.pilgrimsbookhouse.com/xauthordetailsnew.php?mauthor=Jadunath%20Sinha}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doubt about vyapti and certainty of the absence of vyapti act as hindrances to inferential knowledge; the certainty about vyapti is the cause of inferential knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gangesa’s Theory of Truth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9d-ve7e2Vi0C&amp;pg=PA79&amp;dq=vyapti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=akw9UbCIDoT_rAecs4GABw&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=vyapti&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Jain philosophy]] recognizes inference ("''anumana''") as a valid means of knowledge. They consider induction ("''tarka''") to be the knowledge of the invariable concomitance (vyapti) of the middle term with the major term in the three periods of time, arising from the observation of their co-presence and co-absence, and vyapti to be of two kinds, "''anvayavyapti''" and "''vyatirekavyapti''". Wherever there is smoke, there is fire; this is ''anvayavyapti''. Wherever there is no fire, there is no smoke; this is ''vyatirekavyapti''. They hold the view that inference is based on vyapti which is derived from [[Inductive reasoning|induction]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Outlines of Indian Philosophy|author=Jadunath Sinha|publisher=Pilgrims Book (P) Ltd.|page=125|url=http://www.pilgrimsbookhouse.com/xauthordetailsnew.php?mauthor=Jadunath%20Sinha}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Systems of Indian Philosophy|publisher=Genesis Publishing (P) Ltd.|page=100|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FWLRyXBzgsoC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;dq=vyapti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2LY9UeWsOon8rAf4m4H4Bw&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=vyapti&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The followers of the [[Advaita Vedanta]] do not regard the knowledge of the existence of the probans, pervaded by the probandum, in the subject of inference as the cause of inference or the instrumental cause of inference. Vyapti is the co-existence of the probans and the probandum in all the strata of the probans and does not depend upon the agreement in absence between the probans and the probandum. Inference is "''[[Anvaya (Indian logic)|anvayi]]''" and depends upon the agreement in presence between the probans and the probandum and is founded on their positive concomitance. They reject ''anvaya-vyatireki'' inference recognized by the Navya Nayaya. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Outlines of Indian Philosophy|author=Jadunath Sinha|publisher=Pilgrims Book (P) Ltd.|page=370|url=http://www.pilgrimsbookhouse.com/xauthordetailsnew.php?mauthor=Jadunath%20Sinha}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though most schools of Indian thought have proposed their own method of ascertaining vyapti, because they base the knowledge of universal propositions on the principle of causality and essential identity in order to know how cause and effect are universally related, the [[Buddhists]] adopt the method of "''pancakarani''". To the Vedantins vyapti is the result of an induction by simple enumeration. The Naiyayikas firstly look for the relation of agreement in presence between two things, and thereafter look for the uniform agreement in absence between them, then they look for contrary instances and finally eliminate all [[upadhi]] or conditions. They supplement the uncontradicted experience of the relation between two facts by ''tarka'' or indirect proof and by "''samanylakshana''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Companion Encyclopaedia of Hindu philosophy|author= Subodh kapoor|publisher=Genesis Publishing (P) Ltd.|page=69|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JZWdEymxyp4C&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=vyapti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=akw9UbCIDoT_rAecs4GABw&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=vyapti&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to the "''Ashta Siddhis''" that already exist in nature, the followers of [[Aurobindo]] agree that consciousness in itself is free to communicate between one mind and another without physical means consciously and voluntarily, and it does so through two siddhis, namely, "''Vyapti''" and "''Prakamya''". ''Vyapti'' is when feelings of others from outside are felt, and also when one sends own thoughts to others. ''Prakamya'' is when one looks mentally or physically  at something and perceives what is in that thing or super-perceives via the senses &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sri Aurobindo and the Mother|author=Kireet Joshi|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=249|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wW-_IiNSARgC&amp;pg=PA249&amp;dq=vyapti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Nr89Uaa2L8rVrQfD8IBg&amp;ved=0CGIQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=vyapti&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12988">'''Winchester measure''' is a set of legal standards of volume instituted in the late 15th century (1495) by [[Henry VII of England|King Henry&amp;nbsp;VII]] of England and in use, with some modifications, until the present day. It consists of the Winchester [[bushel]] and its dependent quantities, the [[peck]], (dry) [[gallon]] and (dry) [[quart]]. They would later become known as the Winchester Standards, named because the examples were kept in the city of Winchester.

'''Winchester measure''' may also refer to:

==History==
During the tenth century, the capital city of the English king, [[Edgar the Peaceful|Edgar]], was at [[Winchester]] and, at his direction, standards of measurement were instituted.&lt;ref name="Whitelock1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dorothy Whitelock|title=English Historical Documents 500-1042|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gLpQFeVfpuYC&amp;pg=PA437|accessdate=30 January 2012|year=1996|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-14366-0|page=437}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Liebermann1903"&gt;{{cite book|author=Felix Liebermann|authorlink=Felix Liebermann|title=Die gesetze der Angelsachsen: Text und übersetzung|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ak8ZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA204|accessdate=30 January 2012|year=1903|publisher=Max Niemeyer|page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, nothing is known of these standards except that, following the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]], the physical standards (prototypes) were removed to London.&lt;ref name="Zupko1977-12"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ronald Edward Zupko|authorlink=Ronald Edward Zupko|title=British weights &amp; measures: a history from antiquity to the seventeenth century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pWUgAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=30 January 2012|year=1977|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|pages=11–2|isbn=9780299073404}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1496, a law of King Henry&amp;nbsp;VII instituted the bushel that would later come to be known by the name "Winchester".
In 1588 Queen Elizabeth&amp;nbsp;I, while reforming the English weight system (which, at the time, included no less than three different pounds going by the name "avoirdupois") based the new Exchequer standard on an ancient set of bronze weights found at Winchester and dating to the reign of Edward&amp;nbsp;III.

These incidents have led to the widespread belief that the Winchester units of dry capacity measure, i.e., the [[bushel]] and its dependent quantities the [[peck]], [[gallon]] and [[quart]], must have originated in the time of King Edgar. However, contemporary scholarship can find no evidence for the existence of any these units in Britain prior to the Norman Conquest. Furthermore, all of the units associated with Winchester measure (quarter, bushel, peck, gallon, pottle, quart, pint) have names of French derivation, at least suggestive of Norman origin.

===Capacity Measures in the Anglo-Saxon Period===

Prior to the Norman Conquest, the following units of capacity measure were used: ''sester'', ''amber'', ''mitta'', ''coomb'', and ''seam''. A statute of 1196 (9 Richard I. c 27.) decreed: ''It is established that all measures of the whole of England be of the same amount, as well of corn as of vegetables and of like things, to wit, one good horse load; and that this measure be level as well in cities and boroughs as without.''&lt;ref name="BlandTawney1919"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alfred Edward Bland|author2=Richard Henry Tawney|authorlink2=Richard Henry Tawney|title=English economic history: select documents|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bSO6emWmBuAC&amp;pg=PA154|accessdate=1 February 2012|year=1919|publisher=Macmillan Co.|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; This appears to be a description of the seam, which would later be equated with the quarter. The word seam is of Latin derivation (from the Vulgar Latin ''sauma'' = packsaddle).&lt;ref name="Zupko1985"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ronald Edward Zupko|authorlink=Ronald Edward Zupko|title=A dictionary of weights and measures for the British Isles: the Middle Ages to the twentieth century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0l_k-XMIiQIC&amp;pg=PA369|accessdate=1 February 2012|year=1985|publisher=American Philosophical Society|isbn=978-0-87169-168-2|page=369}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the other units are likewise of Latin derivation, sester from sextarius, amber from amphora.&lt;ref name="Harmer2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=F. E. Harmer|title=Select English Historical Documents of the Ninth and Tenth Centuries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cM3Wfu6qlo8C&amp;pg=PA74|accessdate=1 February 2012|date=11 August 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-40222-5|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sester could thus be taken as roughly a pint, the amber a bushel. However, the values of these units, as well as their relationships to one another, varied considerably over the centuries so that no clear definitions are possible except by specifying the time and place in which the units were used.

===After the Norman Conquest===

One of the earliest documents defining the gallon, bushel and quarter is the ''Assize of Weights and Measures'', also known as the ''Tractatus de Ponderibus et Mensuris'', sometimes attributed to [[Henry III of England|Henry&amp;nbsp;III]] or [[Edward I of England|Edward&amp;nbsp;I]], but nowadays generally listed under ''Ancient Statutes of Uncertain Date'' and presumed to be from c. 1250 - 1305. It states, ''By Consent of the whole Realm the King’s Measure was made, so that an English Penny, which is called the Sterling, round without clipping, shall weigh Thirty-two Grains of Wheat dry in the midst of the Ear; Twenty-pence make an Ounce; and Twelve Ounces make a Pound, and Eight Pounds make a Gallon of Wine; and Eight Gallons of Wine make a Bushel of London; which is the Eighth Part of a Quarter.''&lt;ref name="Ashley1888"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sir William James Ashley|authorlink=William Ashley (economic historian)|title=An Introduction to English Economic History and Theory: The Middle Ages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wm48AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA171|accessdate=1 February 2012|year=1888|publisher=Rivingtons|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1496, ''An Act for Weights and Measures'' (12 Henry&amp;nbsp;VII. c5.) stated ''That the Measure of a Bushel contain viij. Gallons of Wheat, and that every Gallon contain viij. li. of Wheat of Troy Weight, and every Pound contain xij. Ounces of Troy Weight, and every Ounce contain xx. Sterlings, and every Sterling be of the Weight of xxxij. Corns of Wheat that grew in the Midst of the Ear of Wheat, according to the old Laws of this Land.''&lt;ref name="BritainEvans1836-312"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Great Britain|author2=William David Evans|author3=Anthony Hammond|author4=Thomas Colpitts Granger|title=A collection of statutes connected with the general administration of the law: arranged according to the order of subjects|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sbcuAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA312|accessdate=4 January 2012|year=1836|publisher=W. H. Bond|pages=312–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though this bushel does not quite fit the description of the Winchester bushel, the national standard prototype bushel constructed the following year (and still in existence) is near enough to a Winchester bushel that it is generally considered the first, even though it was not known by that name at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssplprints.com/image/91818/unattributed-standard-henry-vii-winchester-bushel-1497-1509 Winchester Bushel - Science Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Winchester bushel is first mentioned by name in a statute of 1670 entitled ''An Act for ascertaining the Measures of Corn and Salt'' (22 [[Charles II of England|Charles&amp;nbsp;II]]. c8.) which states, ''And that if any person or persons after the time aforesaid shall sell any sort of corn or grain, ground or unground, or any kind of salt, usually sold by the bushel, either in open market, or any other place, by any other bushel or measure than that which is agreeable to the standard, marked in his Majesty's exchequer, commonly called the ''Winchester'' measure, containing eight gallons to the bushel, and no more or less, and the said bushel strucken even by the wood or brim of the same by the seller, and sealed as this act directs, he or they shall forfeit for every such offence the sum of forty shillings''.&lt;ref name="Britain1670-287"&gt;{{cite book|author=Great Britain|title=Statutes at Large ...: (43 v.) ... From Magna charta to 1800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wKg3AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA287|accessdate=6 January 2012|volume=8|year=1763|publisher=Printed by Joseph Bentham|pages=287–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is first defined in law by a statute of 1696-7 (8 &amp; 9 William&amp;nbsp;III c 22. s 9 &amp; s 45) ''And to the End all His Majesties Subjects may know the Content of the Winchester Bushell whereunto this Act referrs, and that all Disputes and Differences about Measure may be prevented for the future, it is hereby declared that every round Bushel with a plain and even Bottom, being Eighteen Inches and a Halfe wide throughout, &amp; Eight Inches deep, shall be esteemed a legal Winchester Bushel according to the Standard in His Majesty's Exchequer.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=46870&amp;strquery=winchester%20bushel#s45 Statutes of the Realm: volume 7: 1695-1701 (1820), pp. 247-257]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1824 a new [[statute|Act]] was passed in which the gallon was defined as the volume of ten pounds of pure water at 62&amp;nbsp;°[[Fahrenheit|F]] with the other units of volume changing accordingly. The "Winchester bushel", which was some 3% smaller than the new bushel (eight new gallons), was retained in the English grain trade until formally abolished in 1835. In 1836, the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] formally adopted the Winchester bushel as the standard for dealing in grain and, defined as 2,150.42 cubic inches, it remains so today.

==Measures in the city museum==
None of Edgar's standard measures, which were probably made of wood, remain, but the city's copy of the standard yard, although stamped with the official mark of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth&amp;nbsp;I]], may date from the early twelfth century, during the reign of [[Henry I of England|Henry&amp;nbsp;I]]. Preserved standard weights date from 1357 and, although the original bushel is lost, a standard bushel, gallon and quart made of [[bronze]], issued in 1497 and stamped with the mark of [[Henry VII of England|Henry&amp;nbsp;VII]] are still held.
