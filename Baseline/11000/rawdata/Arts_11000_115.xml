The {{Nihongo|'''Agency for Cultural Affairs'''|文化庁|bunkachō}} is a special body of the [[Japan]]ese [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]] (MEXT). It was set up in 1968 to promote Japanese arts and culture. As of April 2018, it is led by the Commissioner for Cultural Affairs, [[Ryohei Miyata]].  

The agency's budget for FY 2017 rose to ¥104.3 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=Policy of Cultural Affairs in Japan Fiscal Year 2017 |year=2017 |p=8 |url=http://www.bunka.go.jp/english/report/annual/pdf/r1394357_01.pdf |accessdate=2018-05-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180503085647/http://www.bunka.go.jp/english/report/annual/pdf/r1394357_01.pdf |archivedate=2018-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The agency's Cultural Affairs Division disseminated information about the arts within Japan and internationally, and the [[Cultural Properties Protection Division]] protected the nation's cultural heritage. The Cultural Affairs Division is concerned with such areas as art and culture promotion, art [[copyrights]], and improvements in the [[Japanese language|national language]]. It also supports both national and local arts and cultural festivals, and it funds traveling cultural events in music, theater, dance, art exhibitions, and film-making. Special prizes are offered to encourage young artists and established practitioners, and some grants are given each year to enable them to train abroad. The agency funds national museums of modern art in Kyoto and Tokyo and [[The National Museum of Western Art]] in Tokyo, which exhibit both Japanese and international shows. The agency also supports the [[Japan Art Academy]], which honors eminent persons of arts and letters, appointing them to membership and offering ￥3.5 million in prize money. Awards are made in the presence of the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]], who personally bestows the highest accolade, the [[Order of Culture]]. In 1989, for the first time two women — a writer and a costume designer — were nominated for the [[Order of Culture|Order of Cultural Merit]], another official honor carrying the same stipend.

The Cultural Properties Protection Division originally was established to oversee restorations after [[World War II]]. As of April 2017, it was responsible for 1,784 historic sites, including the ancient capitals of [[Asuka, Yamato|Asuka]], [[Heijō Palace|Heijokyo]], and [[Fujiwara-kyō|Fujiwara]], 402 scenic places, and 1,024 national monuments, and for such indigenous fauna as [[ibis]] and [[stork]]s. In addition, about 13,500 items had the lesser designation of [[Important Cultural Properties of Japan|Important Cultural Properties]], with fine arts and crafts accounting for the largest share, with over 10,000 so designated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=Policy of Cultural Affairs in Japan Fiscal Year 2017 |year=2017 |p=38 |url=http://www.bunka.go.jp/english/report/annual/pdf/r1394357_01.pdf |accessdate=2018-05-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180503085647/http://www.bunka.go.jp/english/report/annual/pdf/r1394357_01.pdf |archivedate=2018-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government protects buried properties, of which some 300,000 had been identified. During the 1980s, many important prehistoric and historic sites were investigated by the archaeological institutes that the agency funded, resulting in about 2,000 excavations in 1989. The wealth of material unearthed shed new light on the controversial period of the formation of the Japanese state.

A 1975 amendment to the [[Cultural Properties Protection Act]] of 1897 enabled the Agency for Cultural Affairs to designate traditional areas and buildings in urban centers for preservation. From time to time, various endangered traditional artistic skills are added to the agency's preservation roster, such as the 1989 inclusion of a kind of ancient doll making.

One of the most important roles of the Cultural Properties Protection Division is to preserve the traditional arts and crafts and performing arts through their living exemplars. Individual artists and groups, such as a dance troupe or a pottery village, are designated as ''[[Intangible Cultural Property (Japan)|mukei bunkazai]]'' (intangible cultural assets) in recognition of their skill. Major exponents of the traditional arts have been designated as ''[[Living National Treasure (Japan)|ningen kokuho]]'' (living national treasures). About seventy persons are so honored at any one time; in 1989 the six newly designated masters were a ''[[Kyōgen|kyogen]]'' (comic) performer, a chanter of ''[[bunraku]]'' (puppet) theater, a performer of the ''nagauta [[shamisen]]'' (a special kind of stringed instrument), the head potter making [[Imari porcelain|Nabeshima]] decorated porcelain ware, the top pictorial [[lacquer-ware]] artist, and a metal-work expert. Each was provided a lifetime annual pension of ￥2 million and financial aid for training disciples.

A number of institutions come under the aegis of the Agency for Cultural Affairs: the national museums of Japanese and Asian art in [[Tokyo National Museum|Tokyo]], [[Kyoto National Museum|Kyoto]], [[Nara National Museum|Nara]], [[National Museum of Art, Osaka|Osaka]] and [[Kyushu National Museum|Fukuoka]], the cultural properties research institutes at Tokyo and Nara, and the national theaters. During the 1980s, the [[National Noh Theatre]] and the [[National Bunraku Theater]] were constructed by the government.

The agency is based in the [[Chiyoda, Tokyo|Chiyoda Ward]] of [[Tokyo]]. Its relocation to [[Kyoto]] is scheduled by [[Fiscal year#Japan|fiscal]] 2021.&lt;ref name="organization"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Organization |url = http://www.bunka.go.jp/english/about/organization/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alex Kahn''' (born April 9, 1967) is an American visual/performance artist and co-founder of the arts ensemble [[Processional Arts Workshop]]. He is most widely known for his creation of the large-scale puppet performance works that lead [[New York's Village Halloween Parade]] each year.

==Pageant puppetry and processional art==
[[Image:5mothsDay.jpg|thumb|left|Luna Moths, from Alex Kahn's ''Metamorphosis'', from the 1998 NY Village Halloween Parade]]
In 1998, Kahn and his partner, [[Sophia Michahelles]], brought together an ensemble of artists, puppeteers, theatrical technicians, and performers to design the annual performances that lead New York's Village Halloween Parade. Originally named "Superior Concept Monsters", the group was incorporated as a non-profit in 2005 and renamed [[Processional Arts Workshop]] with a mission to create site-specific community-built processions, parades, and other open-space performances.  These works are often developed through open community workshops that bring hundreds of volunteers together to build, rehearse, and ultimately perform cyclical pieces specifically for the parade. The performances typically incorporate elements of puppetry, sound, dance, costume/mask, lighting/projection and mobile architecture, an amalgam of mediums Kahn dubbed "processional art".

In addition to leading [[New York's Village Halloween Parade]] each year, Kahn's creations have appeared in venues nationally and internationally. His work, Metamorphosis, involving 20' tall pupating luna moths, officially opened the 2000 Henson International Festival of Puppet Theatre. In 2002, he and Michahelles initiated a midsummer pageant project in the Italian Alps village of Morinesio, drawing on local folklore and oral history to create a unique site-specific pageant. Inspired by the success of the now-annual tradition, they have seeded similar projects in diverse locales in Ukraine, Turkey, Italy, Texas, New York, and elsewhere. In 2006, Kahn was awarded a [[Fulbright Scholarship]] to [[Trinidad and Tobago]], to study the artistic and cultural structures behind Caribbean Carnival and Trinidadian "Mas'", or costumed procession. More recent PAW works have included major commissions for [[Socrates Sculpture Park]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/27/arts/design/odysseus-at-hell-gate-to-play-at-socrates-sculpture-park.html?_r=1 ''New York Times'' (8/27/2011) - "Odysseus Is Parading Into Queens" by Melena Ryzik]&lt;/ref&gt; the NY Architectural League's Beaux Arts Ball, the [[PEN World Voices]] Festival,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/video/arts/100000002875739/the-puppets-are-watching.html ''New York Times'' (5/12/2014) – Johnson, Gabe.

==Other works==

Kahn has maintained an independent practice as a theatrical designer, printmaker, installation artist, and teacher. His interdisciplinary approach was strongly influenced by his experience as technical director of the Kitchen Performance Center during the 1990s. During this time he created lighting, objects, and effects for performance artists including [[John Jesurun]] ("Chang in a Void Moon"), [[Mikel Rouse]] ("Failing Kansas"), Roseanne Spradlin, [[Meredith Monk]], [[Pauline Oliveros]], and [[David Hykes]]. Kahn trained as a master printer under [[Robert Blackburn (artist)]]  and chaired the Printmaking Department at Maine College of Art from 2000 to 2004. His [http://www.spamcantos.org Spam Cantos], a retooling of spam messages generated by Baysean algorithms into a series of letterpress poems, appeared at the Maine Institute of Contemporary Art in 2008. In 2016, Kahn performed in the role of "choir-master" in "The Visitors" a video-work by Icelandic artist [[Ragnar Kjartansson (performance artist)|Ragnar Kjartansson]], which has appeared at major museums around the world. His ongoing project, a fictional traveling museum called the Archive of the Synapse, has been exhibited nationally. ''San Francisco Chronicle'' art critic Kenneth Baker described the work as follows:

{{quote|In a dark box several objects, including a broken fluorescent tube and a floppy disk, glow with touches of color under ultraviolet light. Beneath it, a backlit label explains that traces of a lost dimension called the Synapse persist in, for example, "the fractures along which things break inexplicably . . . the penny which flips only tails, even the virus-infested computer disk." Kahn's piece makes these traces visible. He makes sly analogies between mystic-scientistic cult thinking and new art's uneasy position in the culture at large. Most remarkably, Kahn reawakens us to a true spookiness of art through the fiction of an ''X-Files''-style obsession.}}

'''''Allegory of Fortune''''', sometimes also named '''''La Fortuna''''', is an oil painting on canvas, that was created around 1658 or 1659, by the Italian baroque painter [[Salvator Rosa]], which caused uproar when first exhibited publicly and almost got the painter jailed and excommunicated. Bearing initials but undated, it measures {{convert|200.7|by|133|cm|in}}. Rosa was known for his landscape paintings, but also worked in the sphere of mythology, witchcraft, portraits, and satire.{{r|Dulwich}} Since 1978 it has been in the [[J. Paul Getty Museum]] in [[Malibu, California]].

==Background==
The painting was made at much the same time as Rosa penned ''Babilonia'', a satirical condemnation of the papal court.{{r|Sewell}}{{efn|''Babilonia'' was the term Rosa used when referring to Rome.{{sfnp|Fredericksen1991|p=543|ps=}}}} According to art critic [[Brian Sewell]], the target of the satirical painting could not be misinterpreted.{{r|Sewell}} Rosa's friends warned him after viewing it privately,{{sfnp|Fredericksen|1980|p=18|ps=}} that the painting should not be displayed openly as it was a satirical attack on [[Pope Alexander VII]]'s patronage.{{r|Grove}} In 1659, the painting was exhibited at the [[Pantheon, Rome]], which almost resulted in Rosa being jailed and [[excommunicated]]. Only the intervention of the pope's brother, Don Marco Chigi, saved him from this humiliation.{{sfnp|Fredericksen|1980|p=18|ps=}}

Eventually, Rosa was convinced of the need to offer an explanation of the picture; he did this under the rubric of ''Manifesto'' and, according to art writer [[James Elmes]], "proved that his hogs were not churchmen, his mules pretending pedants, his asses Roman nobles, and his birds and beasts of prey, the reigning despots of Italy."{{sfnp|Elmes|1825|p=92|ps=}}

An earlier painting of Fortune was undertaken by Rosa during the 1640s.{{sfnp|Roworth|1975|p=663|ps=}}

==Description==
The overall dimensions of the undated oil on canvas are {{convert|200.7|x|133|cm|in}} wide;{{r|Art Project}} the initials "SR" inscribed on the book at the lower left represent the signature of the artist.{{r|Getty}} The painting, sometimes referred to as ''La Fortuna'',{{sfnp|Viers|2008|p=86|ps=}} depicts [[Fortuna]], the goddess of fortune and personification of [[luck]], pouring her gifts on an array of undeserving animals. Traditionally Fortuna has her eyes covered and the vessel containing her favours, the horn of plenty or [[Cornucopia]], is shown in an upright position; Rosa has reversed this tradition in his rendition and portrays Fortuna completely acquainted with where and on whom she is bestowing her gifts from the upended cornucopia.{{r|Art Project}}

Gemstones, coronets, a sceptre, gold coins, pearls, roses, together with grapes, cereal, and berries flow from the cornucopia onto the animals below.{{sfnp|Roworth|1975|p=664|ps=}} In turn the animals are stamping on the symbols of education, the [[art]]s, and knowledge. The donkey, the symbol of the pope, wearing a  cardinal's red and gold coat as a drapery, is suppressing and casting a shadow on an [[owl]], used here as the symbol for [[wisdom]]. The painting is expressing the artist's feelings of bitterness about the fact he lost the papal patronage, and thus Rosa included personal references: a rose signifies Rosa's name; a [[Palette (painting)|palette]] is placed on the book, and the book carries his initials. A pig stepping on a rose also symbolizes the same thing.{{r|Art Project}}

After being displayed in 1659, the painting was acquired by Carlo de Rossi and on his death in around 1683 became the property of Antonio Vallori.{{r|Getty}}

It moved from Italy to England after Vallori sold it to [[Henry Scudamore, 3rd Duke of Beaufort]] in 1727{{sfnp|Roworth|1975|p=663|ps=}} for six hundred [[Italian scudo|scudi]].{{sfnp|Morgan|1824|p=16|ps=}} The duke was completing a [[Grand Tour]] and purchased two Rosa paintings, the other one entitled, ''Nursing of Jupiter''.{{sfnp|Nicolson|1957|p=416|ps=}} Passed down by inheritance, the Fortune painting remained in the possession of the various [[Dukes of Beaufort]] until sold by the [[Henry Somerset, 10th Duke of Beaufort|tenth duke]] in 1957, when it was purchased by [[Marlborough Fine Art|the Marlborough Gallery]]. It was acquired by [[J. Paul Getty]] from the gallery in 1971.{{r|Getty}} Until it passed to the Getty Museum in 1978 it was only exhibited three times: from 21 May 1827 at the Bristol Institution; at the [[British Institution]] in 1859; and as part of the J. Paul Getty Collection exhibition in the summer of 1972 at the [[Minneapolis Institute of Arts]]. In the twenty-first century it has been displayed as part of the ''Bandits, Wilderness and Magic'' exhibition firstly at [[Dulwich Picture Gallery]] in London during 2010 and at the [[Kimbell Art Museum]] in Texas from the end of December 2010 to March 2011.{{r|Getty}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1934">The '''Aotearoa Television Network (ATN)''' was the first, yet unsuccessful television station operating in the [[Māori language]].

What would eventually become ATN started out in early 1996, when [[Te Māngai Pāho]] started looking for tenders for a trial service operating on a UHF licence in Auckland. The winner of the TMP contract, led by Puhi Rangiaho, Tawini Rangahau, Morehu McDonald, Robert Pouwhare and Tukuroirangi Morgan, was announced on March 7 and broadcasting commenced on May 1. The pilot service became regular in October, becoming a normal regional station. TMP's budget only allowed a 500-watt transmitter which resulted in weak or no signal in the ATN catchment area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Middleton |first1=Julia |title=Television - Ka Rangona te Reo - The Development of Māori-language Television Broadcasting in Aotearoa New Zealand |url=http://tekaharoa.com/index.php/tekaharoa/article/viewFile/73/43 |publisher=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]] |accessdate=16 September 2015 |date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Insufficient funding and related uncertainties resulted in the closure of this pilot service in early 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dunleavy |first1=Trisha |title=Television - Māori television |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/television/page-3 |publisher=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]] |accessdate=24 August 2015 |date=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Battle for Sevastopol''''' ({{lang-ru|"Битва за Севастополь"}}; {{lang-uk|"Незламна"}} "Indestructible") is a 2015 [[Biographical film|biographical]] [[war film]] about [[Lyudmila Pavlichenko]], a young [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] who joined the [[Red Army]] to fight the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Nazi invasion of the USSR]] and became one of the deadliest [[sniper]]s in [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;[King, Gilbert (February 21, 2013). "Eleanor Roosevelt and the Soviet Sniper". Smithsonian. Retrieved 14 December 2016.]&lt;/ref&gt; The film, a joint [[Russia|Russian]]-[[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] production, was released in both countries on April 2, 2015; its international premiere took place two weeks later at the [[Beijing International Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4084744/releaseinfo Bitva za Sevastopol (2015) - Release Info]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically speaking, the movie revolves around the events of the [[Siege_of_Odessa_(1941)|siege of Odessa]] and the [[Siege_of_Sevastopol_(1941%E2%80%9342)|siege of Sevastopol]].

The film is directed by Sergey Mokritskiy and stars [[Yulia Peresild]] as Pavlichenko. In addition to Beijing, where Peresild was awarded Best Actress award, the film has also appeared at [[Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.screendaily.com/festivals/cannes-news/battle-for-sevastopol-sold-into-asia/5087942.article 'Battle for Sevastopol' sold into Asia]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
The film opens and closes with post-war scenes from the perspective of [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] ([[Joan Blackham]]) as she visits the protagonist Lyudmila Pavlichenko (Yulia Peresild) during the former first lady's 1957 trip to the Soviet Union. Pavlichenko's story is told through flashbacks to 1942 when Pavlichenko toured the United States with Roosevelt, and further flashbacks to Pavlichenko's experiences in the Soviet Union. After the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the USSR]], university student Pavlichenko becomes a sniper in the [[25th Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|25th Rifle Division]]. She fights in the [[Battle of Odessa (1941)|Battle of Odessa]] and, eventually, the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1941–42)|defense of Sevastopol]]. After 309 confirmed kills, she is sent to the [[United States]] to campaign for American support. Eleanor Roosevelt invites her to the White House, and the two become friends.

In 1941, Lyudmila is a student who has just gotten into university; to celebrate, she goes to a shooting range with her friends including a classmate named Masha, doing exceptionally well despite never have shot before. At home, her father shows no pride in her, having desired a son who could become a soldier. In a twist of events, her perfect shooting results at the range eventually result in the military contacting her for a sharpshooting program, as Germany has just invaded the Soviet Union. Though a doctor courting her, Boris, tells her she should stay with him, she rejects what she perceives as cowardice and leaves to fight on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].

During training, Lyudmila is shown as an excellent sniper, and eventually is partnered with a grizzled veteran named Makarov, who she falls in love with. He doesn't return her affections, however, and explains that he had lost his wife and family when the Germans invaded. She is also reunited with Masha, who is now a nurse engaged with a young pilot. During battle defending the city of Odessa, she is injured and Makarov drags her to safety to a local hospital, where Boris has volunteered as a military doctor. After awakening, Lyudmila manages to get Boris to sign her papers so that she can return to the frontlines, but finds out that Makarov has died in battle and the Soviets are retreating to Sevastopol.

She is paired with another superior, Leonid, and begins to show signs of trauma, showing signs of cruelty by shooting enemy soldiers to wound them and watch them suffer, rather than kill them instantly. Thus, their relationship starts off rough, but they eventually develop a close romance. Masha invites them to her wedding, but at the wedding reveals that her fiance had died, leaving her alone. This leads Lyudmila to tell Leonid privately that she wants a son.

While on patrol in a field, Leonid steps on a mine that triggers a [[flare]]. Immediately, artillery shells begin to pummel the field, and Leonid shelters her from them with his body. Lyudmila again wakes up in a hospital, where Boris tells her Leonid has died. Though in a broken state, she is ordered to kill a top enemy sniper for propaganda purposes. The duel takes all of a day, and, tired of waiting, Lyudmila steps out of cover, exposing herself completely. She is shot, but manages to pinpoint the enemy sniper's location and kills him.

Boris eventually is able to pull her away from battle. As the city is being evacuated, Boris carries a traumatized Lyudmila to a submarine that is evacuating the city. As panicked civilians attempt to board evacuating ships, Lyudmila realizes that Boris isn't coming with her, as he gave her his ticket. A voiceover by Eleanor Roosevelt reveals that Boris, Masha, and countless civilians and soldiers died defending the city from the Germans.

Roosevelt later visits Lyudmila after the war, where she is now a mother. They attend the opera together, with Lyudmila's son.

== Production ==
The filming began in 2012 after the first archive material devoted to Pavlichenko was examined. Serhiy Mokrytskyi, who is better known as a cinematographer, served as director; after his arrival, the plot was altered to more closely match Pavlichenko's life. During production, there was concern of the growing [[Russia-Ukraine relations|political tension between Russia and Ukraine]].
However, the film was successfully released in both countries on the same day, in each country's own respective language.

==Box office==
The movie grossed [[Ruble|RUB]] 435,468,256 ($8,702,274) in the Russian box office against a budget of RUB 124,000,000 and hence was a commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.kinopoisk.ru/film/742026/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==

Bracha Ettinger was born in Tel Aviv on 23 March 1948.&lt;ref&gt;[http://errol.oclc.org/laf/no96-32063.html Library of Congress Name Authority File]&lt;/ref&gt; She received her M.A. in [[Clinical Psychology]] from the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] where she worked as research assistant then personal assistant of [[Amos Tversky]] (1969/70, 1973/74, 1974/75) and [[Danny Kahneman]] (1970/71).&lt;ref name="EGS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bracha Ettinger Biography |url=http://www.egs.edu/faculty/bracha-ettinger/biography/ |website=egs.edu |publisher=The European Graduate School |accessdate=2 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905213057/http://www.egs.edu/faculty/bracha-ettinger/biography/ |archivedate=5 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She married Loni Ettinger in June 1975 and moved to London where she studied, trained and worked between 1975 and 1979 at the London Centre for Psychotherapy (with Elsa Seglow), the [[Tavistock Clinic]] and the [[Philadelphia Association]] (with [[R. D. Laing]]). Her daughter the actress Lana Ettinger&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Lana Ettinger]]&lt;/ref&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;[[:he:%D7%9C%D7%A0%D7%94 %D7%90%D7%98%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%92%D7%A8]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=August 2018}} was born in London. She returned to Israel in 1979 and worked at Shalvata Hospital. Ettinger, who has painted and drawn since early childhood, is self-taught. In her early days she avoided the art scene. In 1981 she decided to become a professional artist and moved to Paris where she lived and worked from 1981 to 2003 with her partner Joav Toker. Her son Itai was born in 1988. As well as painting, drawing and photography, she began writing, and received a D.E.A. in [[Psychoanalysis]] from the [[University Paris Diderot|University Paris VII Diderot]] in 1987, and a Ph.D. in [[Aesthetics]] of Art from the [[University of Paris VIII]] in 1996.&lt;ref name="EGS"/&gt;

Ettinger had a solo project at the [[Pompidou Centre]] in 1987, and a solo exhibition at the Museum of Calais in 1988. In 1995 she had a solo exhibition at the [[Israel Museum]] in Jerusalem, and in 1996 she participated in the [[Contemporary art]] section of ''Face à l'Histoire. 1933–1996'' exhibition in the [[Pompidou Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;''Face à l'Histoire. 1933–1996.'' Paris: Flammarion and Centre Georges Pompidou, 1996. {{ISBN|2-85850-898-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 she had a mid-life retrospective at the [[Centre for Fine Arts]] (The Palais des Beaux Arts) in Brussels, and in 2001 a solo exhibition at the [[Drawing Center]] in [[New York City|New York]].&lt;ref&gt;''Bracha Lichtenberg Ettinger: Eurydice Series.'' Edited by Catherine de Zegher and Brian Massumi. ''Drawing Papers,'' n.24. NY: The Drawing Center, 2001. With texts by Judith Butler, Bracha Ettinger, Adrien Rifkin and the editors, and including a conversation between the Bracha Ettinger and Creigie Horsfield.&lt;/ref&gt; As well as working as an artist, Ettinger continued to train as psychoanalyst with [[Françoise Dolto]], Piera Auglanier, Pierre Fedida, and [[Jacques-Alain Miller]], and has become an influential contemporary [[French feminists|French feminist]].&lt;ref&gt;Couze Venn, in: ''Theory, Culture and Society''.

Even though she was still based mainly in Paris, Ettinger was visiting professor (1997–1998) and then research professor (1999–2004) in [[psychoanalysis]] and aesthetics at the School of Fine Art, History of Art and Cultural Studies at the [[University of Leeds]].&lt;ref name="EGS"/&gt; Since 2001 she has also been visiting professor in Psychoanalysis and Aesthetics at the AHRC Centre for Cultural Analysis, Theory and History (now CentreCATH).&lt;ref name=CATH&gt;AHRC Centre for Cultural Analysis, Theory and History [http://www.leeds.ac.uk/cath/ahrc/people/fellows/ble.html AHRC B.Ettinger page].&lt;/ref&gt; Ettinger had partly returned to Israel in 2003, and has kept studios in both Paris and Tel Aviv ever since. She was a lecturer at the [[Bezalel Academy of Art and Design]] in Jerusalem until 2006.&lt;ref name="EGS"/&gt; 
Some of her specific academic fields of endeavor are [[Feminist theory#Psychoanalysis|feminist psychoanalysis]], art, [[aesthetics]], [[ethics]], the [[gaze]], sexual difference and [[gender studies]], [[Jacques Lacan]], the feminine, early (including pre-birth) psychic impressions, pre-maternal and maternal subjectivity.

Ettinger's research concerns light and space, and in this it follows from [[Monet]] and [[Rothko]].&lt;ref&gt;Manning, Erin, Manning, Erin. "Vertiginious Before the Light." in ''Art as Compassion''.

From 1981 until 1992, Ettinger's principal artwork consisted of drawing and mixed media on paper as well as notebooks and artist's books, where alongside theoretical work and conversations she made ink and wash painting and drawing. Since 1992, apart from her notebooks, most of her artwork consists of mixed media and oil paintings, with few parallel series that spread over time like: "Matrix — Family Album", "Autistwork" and "Eurydice", with themes of generational transmission of memory, personal and historical trauma, the Shoah and the World Wars,&lt;ref&gt;[[Griselda Pollock]], Between painting and the Digital, in: ''Bracha L.

&lt;/ref&gt; Ettinger has become one of the major artists of the [[New European Painting]]. Along with painting she has worked on installations, theoretical research, lectures, video works, and "encounter events". Her paintings, photos, drawings, and notebooks have been exhibited at the [[Pompidou Centre]] (1987, 1996, 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ettinger|url=http://elles.centrepompidou.fr/blog/?x=0&amp;y=0&amp;s=ettinger\website=centrepompidou.fr|publisher=Pompidou Centre|accessdate=3 September 2015}}{{Dead link|date=December 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;–2011), and the [[Stedelijk Museum]] in 1997. In the last decade, Ettinger's oil on canvas paintings involve figures like Medusa, Demeter and Persephone, and Eurydice. Though from 2010 onward her work still consists mainly of oil paintings and drawings, she is also doing new media animated video-films where the images are multi-layered like her painting. In 2015, Ettinger participated in the 14th [[Istanbul Biennial]] drafted and curated by [[Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pavilion Istanbul in/+Leeds Part 3|url=http://www.pavilion.org.uk/events/2015/Bracha-Ettinger/|website=pavilion.org.uk|publisher=Pavilion|accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychoanalyst==
{{BLP sources section|date=September 2015}}
{{Technical|section|date=April 2017}}

Ettinger is a theoretician who proposed an [[ontology]] of string-like subject-subject (trans-subjective) and subject-object (transjective) transmissivity for a rethinking of the human subject. Working at the intersections of human [[subjectivity]], [[Human female sexuality|feminine sexuality]], maternal subjectivity, [[psychoanalysis]], [[art]] and [[aesthetics]], she contributed to psychoanalysis the idea of a feminine-maternal sphere, function, and structure with its symbolic and imaginary dimensions based on femaleness in the real (womb). This dimension, as symbolic, contributes to ethical thinking about human responsibility to one another and to the world. She is a senior clinical psychologist, and a practising psychoanalyst. Her artistic practice and her articulation, since 1985, of what has become known as the matrixial theory of trans-subjectivity have transformed contemporary debates in contemporary art, psychoanalysis, women's studies, and cultural studies. Ettinger was an analysand of [[Ronald Laing]] in London and [[Piera Aulagnier]] in Paris. She is member of the Tel Aviv Institute for Contemporary Psychoanalysis (TAICP),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Members of the Institute|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=iw&amp;u=http://www.taicp.org.il/&amp;prev=search|website=taicp.org|publisher=TAICP|accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the New Lacanian School (NLS) and the [[World Association of Psychoanalysis]] (AMP / WAP).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wapol.org/en/index.html# World Association of Psychoanalysis]&lt;/ref&gt; For Ettinger, the Freudian attitude to psychoanalysis is crucial as it emphasizes the phantasmatic value of materials that arise during regression. To Freud and Lacan she adds, however, a feminine-maternal space-time with its particular structures, functions, and dynamics in the [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]]. She claims that, in a similar way, when seduction is assigned to the paternal figure during regression, it is recognized in most cases as a result of the therapeutic process itself. It is worked-through accordingly without therapist's father-blaming, and without a resulting father-hate. Therapists must likewise realize that during regression phantasmatic maternal "not-enoughness" appears and must also be recognized as the result of the process itself, and be worked-through without the mother-hating that Ettinger considers contributes to a "psychotization" of the subject, and a block to the passage from rage to sorrow and compassion. To be able to recognize the phantasmatic status of the psychic material arising during therapy, the Lacanian concepts of Symbolic, Imaginary and Real are useful to her.

The idea of a corpo-Real is a part of her symbolization of a new feminine psychic zone (the matrixial, the womb as time space of psychic encounter-event), in both male and female subjects, and of the feminine-matrixial sexual difference. Thus, even if Ettinger critiques the Freudian and Lacanian analysis of the feminine, she considers herself as a "post" or "neo" Freudian and Lacanian, who elaborates the feminine in continuity to these psychoanalysts, but claims a supplementary feminine-maternal Eros. Ettinger criticises Winnicott and Bollas for offering patients a "ready-made mother-monster" as a cause for each psychic pain. She considers any practice of archaic-motherhood blaming as an obstacle, as "hystericizing" and even momentarily "psychoticizing" (in the sense of leading to internal splits rather than recognition of differences,) when such "cause" is brought as "explanation" by the analyst, a "cause" attributed to the unremembered early period of life where I and non-I are transconnected. Ettinger agrees with Lacan that the "ultimate" cause is in principle lacking: ''objet a''. She calls for a delicate process of differentiation, coemergence, and cofading between the generations, especially in analysing the same-sex (daughter-mother, son-father) relationships, with emphasize on transmission, not split. Thus, the process itself helps to negotiate and articulate delicately sexual difference, in the present. To the idea that the self is structured via mirror-like reflection she adds that of primal [[apperception]] of the other, through "fascinance" (aesthetic openness to the other and the cosmos), compassion and awe (affective accesses to the other) directed from the beginning to the (m)Other and the outside, not to the self.

===Psychoanalytic theory===

====Major concepts====
Ettinger invented the Matrixial Trans-subjectivity theory, or simply "[[The Matrixial]]", with concepts like border linking, borderspacing, martial borderspace, copoiesis, wit(h)messing and co/in-habit(u)ation.&lt;ref&gt;Bracha L. Ettinger, "Matrixial Trans-subjectivity" in: ''Problematizing Global Knowledge''. Theory, Culture and Society, Volum 23, Numbers 2–3, 2006.ISSN 0263-2764&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Carriance, Copoiesis and the Subreal.” In: ''Saltwater. Theory of Thought Forms''. 14th Istanbul Biennial Catalogue. Edited by Carolyn Christov Bokargiev, 2015. Printed also in: Bracha L. Ettinger. A α א And My Heart Wound-Space.&lt;/ref&gt; Ettinger is a [[Freud]]ian and Lacanian scholar and follows the late [[Jacques Lacan]], [[Emmanuel Levinas]], [[Object relations theory]] and [[Gilles Deleuze]]/[[Félix Guattari]].

====The early theory: from 1985 through the 1990s====
Ettinger articulated a feminine-maternal (and feminine-prematernal) dimension, space, function, Eros and dynamics in the human Unconscious. She had suggested that pre-natal impressions, connected to the phantasmatic and traumatic real of the pregnant becoming-mother, are trans-inscribed in the emerging subject and form the primary phase and position of the human psyche. "I" and "non-I", without rejection and without symbiotic fusion, conjointly inscribe memory traces that are dispersed asymmetrically but in a trans-subjective mode. Trans-subjective mental and affective unconscious "strings", connecting the prenatal emerging subject to the archaic m/Other, open unconscious routes ("feminine", non phallic, in both males and females) that enable subjectivizing processes all throughout life whenever a new matrixial encounter-event takes place. The matrixial encounter-event forms specific aesthetical and ethical accesses to the Other. Ettinger articulated the 'matrixial gaze' and the process of 'co-poiesis'. This allows new understanding of trans-generational transmission, trauma and artistic processes. Ettinger formulates the woman(girl)-to-woman(mother) difference as the first sexual difference for females to be viewed first of all according to the matrixial parameters. The feminie-maternal Eros informs also the father/son and mother/son relations. According to Ettinger, in parallel but also before expressions of abjection ([[Julia Kristeva]]) or rejection (Freud on Narcissism) of the other, primary compassion, awe and fascinance (which are unconscious psychic affective accesses to the other, and which join reattunement and differentiating-in-jointness by borderlinking) occur. The combination of fascinance and primary compassion does not enter the economy of social exchange, attraction and rejection; it has particular forms of Eros and of resistance that can inspire the political sphere and reach action and speech that is ethical-political without entering any political institutional organization. The infant's primary compassion is a proto-ethical psychological means that joins the aesthetical fascinance and creates a feel-knowing that functions at best within maternal (and also parental) compassionate hospitality. Here, one witnesses in jointness: The I wit(h)ness while borderlinking (bordurelaint) to the non-I and borderspacing (bordurespacant) from the other. Ettinger calls for the recognition of the matrixial transference as a dimension in the transferential relationships in psychoanalysis. They must entails besideness to (and not a split from) the archaic the m/Other (Autremere) and parental figures; jointness-in-differentiation rather than their exclusion. She sees in the trans-subjectivity a distinct dimension of human specific linkage and shareability, different from, and supplementary to "inter-subjectivity" and "self" psychology. Her most prominent and comprehensive book regarding this theory is "The Matrixial Borderspace" (reprint of essays from 1994–1999) published in French in 1999&lt;ref&gt;''Regard et Espace-de-bord matrixiels''. La lettre volee. {{ISBN|2-87317-102-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in English in 2006,&lt;ref name=Borderspace&gt;''The Matrixial Borderspace'', University of Minnesota Press 2006, edited by [[Brian Massumi]] and forwarded by [[Judith Butler]] and Griselda Pollock. {{ISBN|0-8166-3587-0}} [http://www.upress.umn.edu/Books/E/ettinger_matrixial.html Upress relevant page].&lt;/ref&gt; but her most recent concepts are mainly elaborated in the different essays printed in 2005–2006.&lt;ref&gt;Mainly: "From Proto-ethical Compassion to Responsibility", "Fascinance" and "Com-passionate Co-response-ability, Initiation in Jointness, and the link x of Matrixial Virtuality". All published in 2006 — see list of recent publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The theory in the 2000s====
Her more recent artistic and theoretical work centers around the spiritual in art and ethics. In the domain of psychoanalysis, around the question of same-sex differences, the primary feminine difference is the difference opened between woman (girl) and woman (m/Other), maternal subjectivity, maternal/pregnance Eros of com-passion, the effects of compassion and awe and the passion for borderlinking and borderspacing&lt;ref&gt;Bracha L. Ettinger, "Diotima and the Matrixial Transference: Psychoanalytical Encounter-Event as Pregnancy in Beauty." In: Van der Merwe, Chris N., and Viljoen, Hein, eds. Across the Threshold: Explorations of Liminality in Literature. New York: Peter Lang &amp; Potchefstroom: Literator, 2007. {{ISBN|1-4331-0002-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the idea that three kinds of fantasy (that she names Mother-fantasies) should be recognized, when they appear in a state of regression aroused by therapy itself, as primal: Mother-fantasies of Not-enoughness, Devouring and Abandonment. Their mis-recognition in psychoanalysis (and analytical therapy), together with the ignorance of maternal Eros of com-passion leads to catastrophic blows to the matrixial daughter-mother tissue and hurts the maternal potentiality of the daughter herself, in the sense that attacking the "non-I" is always also attacking the "I" that dwells inside an "I"-and-"non-I" trans-subjective matrixial (feminine-maternal) tissue. Contributing to Self psychoanalysis after [[Heinz Kohut]], Ettinger articulated the difference between com-passionate borderlinking, compassion (as affect) and empathy, and between "empathy without compassion" and "empathy within compassion", claiming that the analyst's empathy without compassion harms the matrixial psychic tissue of the analysand, while empathy within compassion leads to creativity and to the broadening of the ethical horizon. Ettinger explains how by empathy (toward the patient's complaints) ''without'' compassion (toward the patient's surrounding past and present family figures, no less than toward the patient itself), the therapist "produces" the patient's real mother as a "ready-made monster-mother" figure, that serves to absorb complaints of all kinds, and thus, a dangerous splitting is induced between the "good" mother figure (the therapist) and a "bad" mother figure (the real mother). This splitting is destructive in both internal and external terms, and mainly for the daughter-mother relations, since the I and non-I are in any case always trans-connected, and therefore any split and projected hate (toward such figures) will turn into a self-hate in the woman/daughter web. Such a concept of subjectivity, where "non-I" is trans-connected to the "I", has deep ethical implications&lt;ref&gt;Bracha L. Ettinger, "From Proto-ethical Compassion to Responsibility: Besideness, and the three Primal Mother-Phantasies of Not-enoughness, Devouring and Abandonment". In: ''Athena: Philosophical Studies''. Vol. 2 (Vilnius: Versus). 2006. 100–135. ISSN 1822-5047.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as far-reaching sociological and political implications that have been further developed by [[Griselda Pollock]] in order to rethink [[Modernism|modern]] and [[postmodern art]] and History. Ettinger's recent theoretical proposals starting around 2008 include the three Shocks of maternality and the paternal infnticide impulses (Laius Complex)&lt;ref&gt;Bracha L.

'''Chegg, Inc.''' is an American education technology company based in [[Santa Clara, California]], that used to specialize in online [[textbook]] rentals (both in physical and digital formats), and has moved into [[homework]] help, [[online tutoring]], [[scholarships]] and [[internship]] matching. It is meant to help students in [[high school]] and [[college]]. It also owns [[citation]] services [[EasyBib]], [[Citation Machine]], [[BibMe]], and [[Cite This For Me]]. The company was created in the [[United States]] by three [[Iowa State University]] students in 2001 and was founded by entrepreneur Aayush Phumbhra.&lt;ref name="tws26janab"&gt;{{cite news|author= Miguel Helft|title= We Rent Movies, So Why Not Textbooks?|publisher= ''The New York Times''|date= July 4, 2009|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/05/business/05ping.html|accessdate= 2010-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''Chegg'' is a [[portmanteau]] of the words ''chicken'' and ''egg'', based on the founders' experience after graduating from college; they could not land a job without experience, but could not get experience without a job.&lt;ref name=tws26jan4b&gt;{{cite news|author= Miguel Helft|title= We Rent Movies, So Why Not Textbooks?|quote= ... calculated that his bill for books that semester would have been $334 with Chegg, far less than the $657 he paid. ...|publisher= ''The New York Times''|date= July 4, 2009|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/05/business/05ping.html|accessdate= 2010-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2001, Josh Carlson, Mike Seager, and Mark Fiddelke created the precursor to the business called Cheggpost.com, a [[Craigslist]]-type classified service for college students at [[Iowa State University]]. Aayush Phumbhra, who attended Iowa State University and was an avid Cheggpost.com user, approached Carlson in late 2003 with the idea of taking the company national. Phumbhra mentioned the service to a friend, [[Osman Rashid]], who saw potential in the idea, joined as [[chief executive officer]] to help fund the company in 2005, and formally launched Chegg, Inc., which was incorporated in August.  Carlson remained until February 2006 and then left to pursue other interests. In April 2006, Chegg found some initial investors, including Sam Spadafora, [[Mike Maples]], and others. The co-founders quit their regular jobs to focus on Chegg full-time. They tested services, acquired three college classifieds businesses, and publicized Chegg via campus campaigns at SUNY Canton and word-of-mouth. In summer 2007, the firm launched "textbookflix.com", which used a textbook rental model modeled after [[Netflix]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/id/40918/ ''Newsweek'']&lt;/ref&gt; Rashid and Phumbhra decided to switch the "textbookflix" name to "Chegg.com" in December 2007. According to a company spokesperson, Chegg rented its two millionth book in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://openhomeworkhelp.online/chegg-company/ Openhomework]&lt;/ref&gt;

===IPO===
Chegg began trading shares publicly on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] on November 13, 2013.  According to the ''San Jose Business Times'', the [[Initial public offering|IPO]] raised $187.5 million and gave it an initial [[Market capitalization|market cap]] of about $1.1 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2013/11/12/chegg-tops-ipo-targets-valuation.html | title=Chegg stock stumbles after IPO tops targets}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ingram partnership===
In August 2014, Chegg entered into a strategic partnership with [[Ingram Content Group]] to transfer ownership of both current and new textbook inventory to Ingram, equaling approximately 10% of Chegg’s anticipated textbook volume for the Fall 2014 semester. The partnership is a significant change in direction for Chegg and reduces the overhead costs of handling storage and direct shipping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/04/ingram-books-strikes-distribution-partnership-with-chegg |title=Chegg Strikes Distribution Partnership With Ingram Books, Announces 15% Boost In Earnings From Digital Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, Chegg announced that it would deepen its partnership with Ingram by making them responsible for purchasing 100% of textbook inventory. Chegg continues to market the books to students directly, as well as control pricing and catalog selection, while Ingram handles distribution, logistics and warehousing of the books. The intention of the strategic move is to cut costs and work towards 100% digital revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://investor.chegg.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2015/Chegg-and-Ingram-Content-Group-Announce-Agreement-in-Principle-Setting-Chegg-on-Path-Towards-100-Digital-Revenue/default.aspx |title=Chegg and Ingram Content Group Announce Agreement in Principle Setting Chegg on Path Towards 100% Digital Revenue}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, Pearson partnered with Chegg to make higher education textbooks more affordable. This partnership operated on a "rental only" business model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebookseller.com/news/pearson-partner-chegg-textbook-rentals-534631|title=Pearson to partner with Chegg on textbook rentals {{!}} The Bookseller|website=www.thebookseller.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018 Chegg discovered a data breach the previous April . The breach includes the loss of user names, hashed passwords, addresses and e-mails but not financial data &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CURRENT REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 |url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364954/000136495418000187/cyrus.htm |publisher=Security and Exchange Commission |accessdate=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Board of directors==
As of December 31, 2017, the board of directors consists of:&lt;ref name="10-K 2017"/&gt;
* [[Dan Rosensweig]] (Chairman, President, &amp; CEO)
* Andrew Brown (CFO)
* Robin Tomasello (Vice President &amp; Corporate Controller)
* Jeffrey Housenbold (Director at Softbank Vision Fund)
* Renee Budig
* Marne Levine (COO at [[Instagram]])
* Richard Sarnoff (Golub Capital BDC, Inc.)
* Ted Schlein (Partner at [[Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers]])
* [[John York]] (CEO at [[San Francisco 49ers]])

==Business model==
It is estimated that in 2009, college students spent an average of $667 on their textbooks.&lt;ref name=tws26janbv334 /&gt; A second estimate was $1,000 per year,&lt;ref name=tws26jan12&gt;{{cite news|author=Peter King|title=A Textbook Case of Renting Books|work=Wall Street Journal
|date=April 23, 2009|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124045232885846381|accessdate=2010-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; with signs that textbook prices were increasing faster than [[inflation]].&lt;ref name=tws26jan12 /&gt; Moreover, some college bookstores would offer to buy back the used books for a fraction of their original price.&lt;ref name="tws26janab" /&gt;

The founders began noticing the trend of online rental from the success of services like Netflix.&lt;ref name=tws26jan4&gt;{{cite news |author=Miguel Helft|title=We Rent Movies, So Why Not Textbooks?|quote=... the inspiration was Netflix. ...|work=The New York Times
|date=July 4, 2009|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/05/business/05ping.html|accessdate=2010-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, in the summer of 2007, Rashid and Phumbhra re-positioned the company along the lines of Netflix as a way to rent textbooks to students.&lt;ref name="tws26janab" /&gt;&lt;ref name=tws26jan11a21ax1&gt;{{cite news|author=Julie Schmit|title=Chegg CEO Rashid applies Netflix concept to textbooks|work=USA Today|date=2009-01-12|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/companies/management/entre/2009-01-11-chegg-rashid_N.htm
|accessdate=2010-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Chegg had little money initially, when an order came in Rashid would buy the book using a credit card and have it shipped to the student until automation came later.&lt;ref name=tws26jan4c&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one point, with a huge volume of traffic on his credit card, his credit card firm suspected fraud, but Rashid was able to persuade the credit supplier to extend credit using multiple numbers of cards.&lt;ref name=tws26jan4 /&gt;

Books normally rent around half the retail price; for example, a macroeconomics textbook priced at $122 at a college bookstore would rent for $65 at Chegg.&lt;ref name=tws26jan4 /&gt; But savings varied from book to book.&lt;ref name=tws26jan4d&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stories in campus newspapers helped spread the idea. One senior at [[Arizona State University]] calculated he would spend about half as much renting books than buying them for one semester.&lt;ref name=tws26jan4 /&gt; The idea clicked. In 2008, the firm hired the former chief executive of [[Match.com]], Jim Safka, to run the firm.&lt;ref name=tws26jan4 /&gt; In 2008, revenues were about $10 million; in 2009, revenues in January alone were $10 million, according to Safka.&lt;ref name=tws26jan&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm has raised additional capital from [[venture capitalist]]s. The company also started a campus representative program, which paid the enrolled college students per referral for purchases made by other college students.&lt;ref name=tws26jan4 /&gt;

In January 2009, ''[[USA Today]]'' reporter Julie Schmit described Chegg as a "leader" in the "burgeoning arena of college textbook rentals."&lt;ref name=tws26jan11a21ax1 /&gt; The firm had 55 customer service reps at that point.&lt;ref name=tws26jan11a21ax1 /&gt;

Since many textbooks become out-of-date quickly, often replaced with new versions, a key to profitability will be how long a book can be re-rented, or recycled; in the market for rental cars, for example, firms such as [[Hertz Rent-a-Car|Hertz]] and [[Avis Rent a Car System|Avis]] buy new cars but sell them after about a year or two of service. But what is the useful life of a rented book? "The market can be tricky," said market analyst Kathy Mickey, because professors must use the same books for several semesters in order for book-rental companies to make money on the programs.&lt;ref name=tws26janbv334ab /&gt;

==Competitors==
The college textbook market has a variety of competitors. While the main source of books for college students is college bookstores, there are an increasing number of options.&lt;ref name=tws26jan11a21ax1 /&gt; Bookseller [[Barnes &amp; Noble]], which owns 636 college bookstores, began its own textbook rental program in January 2010, largely patterned along the lines of Chegg's service. One report is that Barnes &amp; Noble will rent books at about 42% of their original price, on average.&lt;ref name=tws26janbv334&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students can also rent textbooks from their college bookstore or online, with orders shipped to their college bookstore for pickup, according to one [[Associated Press]] report.&lt;ref name=tws26janbv334/&gt;

The [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] set aside $10 million to encourage college bookstores to rent textbooks,&lt;ref name=tws26janbv334ab&gt;{{cite news

The '''dialogue editor''' is a type of [[Sound editor (filmmaking)|sound editor]] who assembles, synchronizes, and edits all the [[dialogue]] in a [[film]] or television production. Usually, they will use the production tracks: the sound that was recorded on the set. If any of the production tracks are unusable they can be replaced by either alternate production tracks recorded on set or by ADR, [[automated dialogue replacement]], which is recorded after the shoot with the actors watching their performances in a sound studio and rerecording the lines. Large productions may have an ADR editor working under the dialogue editor, but the positions are often combined. The ADR editor or dialogue editor also work with the [[walla]] group in films which they are required, providing the background chatter noise in scenes with large crowds, such as parties or restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://filmsound.org/AudiopostFAQ/audiopostfaq.htm filmsound.org Q&amp;A]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.hollywoodshorts.com/2011/05/post_sound_tips/ hollywoodshorts.com, INTERVIEW: Post Sound Tips- Eric Lalicata &amp; Dan Snow, May 09, 2011] &lt;/ref&gt;

Once the dialogue editor has completed the dialogue track, the re-recording mixer then mixes it with the [[music]] and [[sound effects]] tracks to produce the final soundtrack.

A '''drone display''' is the use of multiple [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s (drones), often [[quadcopters]], flying in a coordinated fashion for public display. The are usually equipped with [[LED]]s, and the display held at night. The displays may be for entertainment, where the drones may use [[Flocking (behavior)|flocking]] or [[Swarm robotics|swarming behaviour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/studio-drift-franchise-freedom-smart-creativity/index.html|title=Swarm of drones illuminates the night sky|date=17 September 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drones may also be coordinated to produce images. Using this [[emerging technology]], displays have been employed for advertising purposes as well.

[[Intel]] has produced the [[Shooting Star (drone)|Shooting Star]], a type of drone used in light shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newsroom.intel.com/news/intel-celebrates-lgbtq-pride-2018-drone-light-show/|title=Intel Celebrates LGBTQ Pride 2018 with Drone Light Show - Intel Newsroom|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were used during the 2018 Winter Olympics, a Super Bowl halftime show in 2017, and a 2018 4th of July celebration.&lt;ref name="wired.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/story/more-inclusive-fourth-of-july-drone-show/|title=A Fourth of July Drone Show Helps Military Families With Special Needs|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drone light shows differ from fireworks displays in that drones are reusable, and do not produce air and noise pollution.&lt;ref name="wired.com"/&gt; However, drone displays cannot take place during rain or strong winds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/local/wisconsin/2018/07/27/drone-light-show-lights-up-evening-air-show-oshkosh/845104002/|title=Lighted drone show sparkles and wows crowd at EAA AirVenture|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Fist Crushing a U.S. Fighter Plane Sculpture''' is a gold-coloured{{Clarify timeframe|date=November 2018}} monument located in [[Misrata]], [[Libya]]. It was once located at the [[Bab al-Azizia]] compound in the [[Libya]]n capital of [[Tripoli]].  The sculpture was commissioned by the nation's leader, Colonel [[Muammar Gaddafi]] following the [[1986 bombing of Libya]] by United States aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Corey Sobel. [http://www.esquire.com/the-side/opinion/7totalitarianwonders-2 ''Fist Crushing U.S. Fighter Plane'']. Esquire, February 16, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; It was built in the shape of an arm and hand squeezing a fighter plane.

During the [[2011 Libyan civil war]], the sculpture was frequently noted in media coverage of televised speeches given by Gaddafi on 22 February and 20 March 2011, in which he vowed to "die a martyr" to prevent anti-government rebels prevailing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenational.ae/news/worldwide/africa/libyan-leader-muammar-qaddafi-vows-to-die-as-a-martyr ''Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi vows to 'die as a martyr' '']. The National, February 23, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 August, at the height of the [[Battle of Tripoli (2011)|Battle of Tripoli]], NTC rebels breached the Bab al-Azizia compound and international news stations broadcast pictures of rebels gathered around the statue, with one fighter having climbed onto it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/24/world/africa/24libya.html Rebels Storm Qaddafi Compound] The New York Times, August 23, 2011. Accessed: 2011-08-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Graffiti had been drawn on its base by rebel forces. At some point in time, the U.S. flag and initials U.S.A. had been removed from the representation of the plane.

It is now in the [[Misrata War Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.juancole.com/2012/07/looking-out-from-the-misrata-war-memorial-museum-libya-photo.html|title=Looking out from the Misrata War Memorial Museum, Libya (Photo)|website=Informed Comment|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Iran Azeri Cartoon.png|thumb|300px|right|Cartoon that started the controversy. The boy tries to address the cockroach using different forms of ''soosk'' ([[Persian language|Persian]] word for cockroach) and in one of the cartoons it answers ''Namana?'' ([[Azerbaijani language]] for ''What?'')]]
[[Image:Azeri Cartoon Persian speaking cockroach .jpg|thumb|200px|right|The cockroach also spoke in [[Persian language|Persian]].]]

The '''Iran newspaper cockroach cartoon controversy''' occurred in response to a [[cartoon]] drawn by the cartoonist [[Mana Neyestani]] and published in the [[Iran]]ian holiday-magazine ''Iran-e-jomee'' on 12 May 2006.

The cartoon describes nine methods of dealing with cockroaches by depicting a Persian-speaking child and a cockroach. During the first method, when the cockroach does not understand him, the child decides to talk to the cockroach in "cockroach language" using different forms of ''soosk'' (Persian word for cockroach). But the cockroach does not even understand its "own" language and replies by saying "''Namana?''" ("''What?''"). As ''namana'' is a word which originates in the [[Azerbaijani language]], the cartoon has been interpreted by some as an insult to [[Iranian Azerbaijanis]].

==Contents of the article==
The article which the cartoons accompany is entitled "How to stop the cockroaches from making us into cockroaches?" It is a satirical article in a children's weekly newspaper. The cartoon depicts nine methods of dealing with cockroaches including dialogue, oppression, elimination, population control, and violence. The text of the paragraph in the first image describes the first method, translated as follows:
{{cquote|"First method: dialogue"&lt;br /&gt;
Some people believe that one should not resort to violence as an initial step, because that will just take all the fun out of the process. So we must first try to come to the table like civilized people and have a dialogue with the cockroaches. But the problem is that a cockroach cannot understand human language [i.e., reasoned argument]. And cockroach grammar is so difficult—nobody has yet discovered which of their verbs end in "ing"--that 80% of the cockroaches themselves do not know it and prefer to speak in other languages. When even the cockroaches do not understand their own language, how could you possibly understand it?! This is precisely why negotiations hit a dead-end and the sweet methodology of violence becomes a necessity!}}

The child proceeds to speak in "cockroach language" to the cockroach, but the cockroach doesn't understand him and replies "''Namana?''" ("''What?''"). ''Namana'' is originally an [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani-Turkic word]], but is also sometimes used in Persian as a slang. In other sections of the article where the violence option is entertained, the cockroach speaks in Persian to the child. 

The article's use of the key words "''dialogue''" (گفتمان) and "''violence''" (خشونت ورزی), plus discussions about problems understanding the language of the "cockroaches," can be interpreted as tacit references to the reformist's nomenclature in contrast to the language of the conservatives in Iran. The famous reformist motto "[[Mohammad Khatami#Dialogue Among Civilizations|dialogue between civilizations]]", used by Iran's former president [[Mohammad Khatami]], was a source of criticism among the intelligentsia, because they questioned how it could be possible to have such a dialogue between Iran and the western civilizations when it was not even possible to have a dialogue and mutual understanding between reformist and conservative Iranians.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

==Aftermath==
The publication of the cartoon caused controversy among [[Iranian Azerbaijanis]] for allegedly comparing them to cockroaches. It was deemed by some people as part of a long-standing chauvinistic attitude towards Iranian Azerbaijanis among parts of the Persian-speaking majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2006/12/iran-a-minority-report/305367/|title=Iran: A Minority Report|last=Wood|first=Graeme|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2017-07-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/iranian-azeris-a-giant-minority|title=Iranian Azeris: A Giant Minority|author=Ali M. Koknar|date=June 6, 2006|website=www.washingtoninstitute.org|language=en|access-date=2017-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy resulted in massive protests in May 2006 throughout the predominantly [[Iranian Azeris|Azerbaijani-populated]] cities of [[Tabriz]], [[Urmia]], [[Ardabil]], [[Zanjan (city)|Zanjan]] and [[Naqadeh|Naghadeh (Sulduz)]] and a number of smaller towns. After violent reactions from the Iranian police, the initially peaceful protests turned violent in most cases, with protesters throwing stones and damaging government related properties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranfocus.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=7296 Iran's Azeri minority protests mocking cartoon] Iran Focus {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519051754/http://www.iranfocus.com/en/?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=7296|date=May 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amnesty International]] claims that "hundreds, if not thousands, were arrested and tens of Azerbaijani-Turks reportedly shot and killed by the security forces,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnestyusa.org/annualreport.php?id=ar&amp;yr=2007&amp;c=IRN Amnesty International.

The [[Government of Iran|Iranian government]] promptly responded to the events by temporarily shutting down the ''Iran'' newspaper, arresting the cartoonist Mana Neyestani, who is himself an ethnic Azeri Türk&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5024550.stm|title=Iran Azeris protest over cartoon|date=2006-05-28|access-date=2018-01-19|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and the editor-in-chief of the newspaper, Mehrdad Ghasemfar. It further accused outside forces of "playing the nationalistic card".&lt;ref&gt;Daria Vaisman.

==Possible foreign interference==
{{See also|Ethnic minorities in Iran#Foreign interference|l1=Iran's ethnic minorities and foreign interference}}

[[Emad Afrough]], head of the Majlis Cultural Commission at the time, said that [[pan-Turkism|pan-Turkists]] were involved in creating the tensions.&lt;ref name="Iran-Daily"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iran-daily.com/1385/2571/html/national.htm#s147618|title=Student Demo In Tehran University|publisher=Iran-daily|date=May 25, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012203158/http://www.iran-daily.com/1385/2571/html/national.htm#s147618|archivedate=October 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other members of the Iranian government blamed it on the [[United States]], [[Israel]], and the [[United Kingdom]], suspecting the incitement of ethnic strife in Iran. It was alleged that the United States  is conducting covert operations in Iran and is allied with Iran's neighbor, the [[Republic of Azerbaijan]].&lt;ref name="atimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/HF08Ak02.html|publisher=Asia Times Online|date=Jun 8, 2006|title=Foreign plots and cockroaches in Iran|author=Iason Athanasiadis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abbas Maleki, a senior research fellow at [[Harvard University]] and former deputy foreign minister of Iran, stated:&lt;ref name="atimes"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I think that when [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] says all options are on the table, the destabilization of Iran's ethnic provinces is one of them. Don't forget, Mr [[Mahmudali Chehregani]], one of the pan-Turkist leaders agitating for a separatist [[Azeri]] agenda, was in Washington last year by invitation of the [[United States Department of Defense|Defense Department]].
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Reuel Marc Gerecht, a former [[CIA]] operative, had stated in the early 1990s:&lt;ref name="atimes"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Accessible through [[Turkey]] and ex-Soviet Azerbaijan, eyed already by nationalists in [[Baku]], more westward-looking than most [of] Iran, and economically going nowhere, Iran's richest agricultural province was an ideal CIA [covert action] theater.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [[Touraj Atabaki]], well-known expert on [[Iranian Azerbaijanis]], there might be some truth behind the Iranian government's allegations of a foreign plot, yet the responsibility for the unrest lies first and foremost with the central government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.isn.ethz.ch/news/sw/details.cfm?ID=16060 |title=Iran: Cartoon protests signal Azeri frustration|author=Jean-Christophe Peuch|date=January 6, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060827231413/http://www.isn.ethz.ch/news/sw/details.cfm?ID=16060|archivedate=August 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, writer Iason Athanasiadis opines that "there is no hard evidence pointing toward the troubles as being anything but domestic".&lt;ref name="atimes"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10650">The '''Kilkenny Design Workshops''' (KDW) were a government-funded research and development centre of excellence for [[design]] (and design advocacy, research and promotion) which was established in [[Ireland]] in 1963. It was created to inspire, support and demonstrate to industry how design could be the key factor in change and lead to economic success. This was a new departure, up to this point no model had existed anywhere in the world for this type of practice. Teamwork is common today in design practices but this method was new for its time. KDW operated from the converted Ormonde Stables in [[Kilkenny|Kilkenny City]] from its official opening in 1965 until its closure in 1988.

==History==
William H. Walsh was the founder of KDW and Chief Executive of Córas Tráchtála Teoranta (CTT) or [[Irish Export Board]]. He had a vision for improving standards of design in industry to encourage commerce, trade and export. Walsh also realised the importance of design for the Irish market and how the existing situation in Ireland in the early 1960s  (including protective tariffs) meant that a strategy would be required to encourage appreciation and promotion of good design.

Steps had been taken to ensure that the design situation in Ireland was carefully assessed. A group of selected [[Scandinavia]]n designers were commissioned to compile the ''Design in Ireland'' report (also known as ''The Scandinavian Report''), auditing the standards of design in Ireland. William H. Walsh spearheaded the establishment of Kilkenny Design Workshops, itself a revolutionary move as this was to be the first state agency established outside [[Dublin]].

The early workshops in Kilkenny were Ceramics, Candle making, Precious Metals and Metalwork Woodturning and Textiles; which comprised weaving and printed textile departments. Graphic Design was added to in 1969 and 3D work included Furniture Design. Designers also contributed to packaging production and exhibition’s design. Industrial Design and Design Consultancy services were offered to clients as the shift moved from traditional industry to engineering based production industries.

Workshops were staffed with teams of creatives; artists designers, craftspeople, apprentices, graduates and students, including technicians and chemists to assist with research and development. The management team also consisted of a creative and active board that included artists Louis le Brocquy, Pat Scott and Sir Basil Goulding.

Retail was seen as an opportunity from the early days of KDW and the KDW shop was used to sell prototypes, promote design and provide manufacturers with a working example of the business opportunities around well designed and promoted Irish products. Links were forged with buyers from American and UK retailers. KDW opened a shop in [[Ghirardelli Square|Ghiradelli Square]] in [[San Francisco]] and participated in in-store promotions in [[B. Altman and Company|Altman's]] in New York, [[Heal's]] in London and [[Neiman Marcus]] in [[Dallas]].

Design advocacy included seminars and exhibitions, the education of the designers in the workshops led to the potential for good design to spread out of the Kilkenny Graduate Programmes which refined the skills of young designers. Many of those who partook in programmes ran by KDW went on to establish their own creative enterprises or teach in design departments at second and third level in Ireland. KDW also had participation in and representation on international design organisations including the [[World Crafts Council]], the [[International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes|International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID)]] and the International Council of Design ([[Ico-D]]), formerly known as International Council of Graphic Design Associations (ICOGRADA). Later KDW itself became an inspiration and a model for design development in other countries, its legacy spread to several countries around the world interested in building up design for industry and using KDW’s example as a template for establishing this approach in their own country.

Although Kilkenny Design Workshops ceased operation in 1988&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://repository.dri.ie/catalog/5999n9755|title=Kilkenny Design Workshop|last=|first=|date=|website=Digital Depository of Ireland|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; their output had transformed the visual culture of Ireland. KDW demonstrated the importance of design for efficient manufacturing processes and well designed marketing material to communicate the quality of products, it also endorsed the creation of beautiful products that could be both functional and visually appealing.

==Legacy==
In 2013, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the KDW, the Design &amp; Crafts Council of Ireland (DCCoI) held a conference titled "KDW@21C" that sought to investigate the continuing legacy and acknowledge the influence of the KDW on Irish design practice and culture.&lt;ref name=21C&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalcraftgallery.ie/kdw21C|title=KDW@21C|publisher=National Craft Gallery (Ireland)|accessdate=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the conference was a "Remembering KDW" event, a reunion for former KDW participants.&lt;ref name=21C/&gt;

In 2015, the DCCoI released an [[iOS]] [[mobile app|app]] titled "Kilkenny Design Workshops" highlighting the work of the KDW.&lt;ref&gt;

===Irish Design 2015 (ID2015)===
2015 marked 50 years since KDW officially opened. To commemorate this event, the Global Irish Economic Forum in 2013 conceived of ID2015, a year-long programme celebrating the history of Irish design. ID2015 was a major government backed initiative that explored, promoted and celebrated Irish design through events and activities on the island of Ireland and in renowned international capitals of design and commerce.

The initiative sought to:
* raise the profile of Irish design, at home and abroad
* increase awareness of the value of design in all aspects of life
* build on the international reputation of Irish design
* encourage links between local and global Irish designers
* showcase the importance of design to success in business and as a driver of economic growth

The all-island initiative was convened by the Design and Crafts Council of Ireland (DCCoI), in collaboration with partner organisations, on behalf of the [[Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation]], the [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Ireland)|Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]] and [[Enterprise Ireland]].  President of Ireland [[Michael D. Higgins]] was the Patron of Irish Design 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishdesign2015.ie|title=Irish Design 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of ID2015, [[Dublin]] was designated World Design Hub 2015 by the International Association of Designers, providing Ireland with a platform to promote the skills and talents of Irish designers to a worldwide audience.

The achievements and impact of ID2015 are discussed in ''Irish Design 2015 - Making Design Matter''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1906691509/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1485027341&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=irish+design+2015+making+design+matter&lt;/ref&gt; a book that offers a comprehensive examination of the year of Irish design. Through a series of essays by key participants in the initiative, spotlight reports on the different projects mounted throughout the year, and group discussions featuring leading Irish and international figures from the sector, ''Making Design Matter'' captures the why and the how of the landmark initiative that was Irish Design 2015 (ID2015). Edited by Professor Alex Milton, ID2015 Programme Director;&lt;ref&gt;https://alexmiltondesign.com/about/&lt;/ref&gt; Karen Hennessy, CEO of ID2015 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.dccoi.ie/about/our-team/&lt;/ref&gt; and DCCoI and Rachel Donnelly, ID2015 Content Editor, the publication takes a broad view of the design sector in Ireland, reflecting on key moments in its past, engaging with its vibrant present, and speculating about its optimistic future. The publication also presents a comprehensive quantitative analysis of the impact of the year's activities, alongside statistics representing the economic footprint of the design sector in Ireland. ID2015 was pioneering in its target-focused approach to making design matter, with the result that this is the first ever quantitative analysis of the impact of design activity mounted on this scale.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irishdesign2015.ie/news/single/minister-mitchell-oconnor-officially-launches-report-on-irish-design-2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Key outcomes of the initiative were:
* 370 newly registered design companies
* 476 designers supported to attend international design-based trade events
* 50 companies supported to undertake design training
* €24.1 million in design-based exports generated
* 28.5 million people engaged with ID2015 through exhibitions and events
* €20.1 million+ PR value generated
* 3 design accelerators launched

In [[library science]] and architecture, a '''stack''' or '''bookstack''' (often referred to as a library building's ''stacks'') is a book storage area, as opposed to a reading area.  More specifically, this term refers to a narrow-aisled, multilevel system of iron or steel shelving that evolved in the nineteenth century to meet increasing demands for storage space.&lt;ref name="petroski"&gt;{{cite book|last=Petroski|first=Henry|title=The Book on the Book Shelf|year=1999|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|pages=167–168, 170–172, 184, 191}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An "open-stack" library allows its patrons to enter the stacks to browse for themselves; "closed stacks" means library staff retrieve books for patrons on request.

==Early development==
French architect [[Henri Labrouste]], shortly after making pioneering use of iron in the [[Bibliotheque Sainte-Genevieve]] of 1850, created a four story iron stack for the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]].&lt;ref name="ELH"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wiegand|first=Wayne, ed.|title=Encyclopedia of Library History|year=1994|publisher=Garland|pages=352–355}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1857, multilevel stacks with grated iron floors were installed in the [[British Library]].&lt;ref name="petroski" /&gt;  In 1876, William R. Ware designed a stack for [[Gore Hall]] at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name="snead 11" /&gt;  In contrast to the structural relationship found in most buildings, the floors of these bookstacks did not support the shelving, but rather the reverse, the floors being attached to, and supported by, the shelving framework.  Even the load of the building's roof, and of any non-shelving spaces above the stacks (such as offices), may be transmitted to the building's foundation through the shelving system itself. The building's external walls act as an envelope but provide no significant structural support.&lt;ref name="ELH" /&gt;

==Library of Congress and the Snead system==
For the [[Thomas Jefferson Building]] of the [[Library of Congress]], completed in 1897, [[Bernard Richardson Green]] made a number of alterations to the Gore Hall design, including the use of all-metal shelving. The contract was won by the Snead and Company Ironworks, which went on to install its standardized design in libraries around the country.&lt;ref name="snead 11" /&gt; Notable examples include the [[Widener Library]] at Harvard and the seven level stack supporting the Rose Reading Room of the New York Public Library.&lt;ref name="petroski" /&gt;

The Library of Congress bookstacks were designed and patented by Bernard R. Green (1843-1914), the engineer in charge of the Library of Congress construction, where this type of book storage was first used. Although the structure was of cast iron, the shelves were made from strips of thin U section steel, designed to be as light as an equivalent pine shelf. The top surface of the U section was ground, polished and 'lacquered' (the constituents of the lacquer are not known). Green designed the stacks to be modular, able to be erected several stories high as a single freestanding structural entity incorporating staircases and floors, and even capable of supporting a roof structure. He designed the shelves so that they could adjust to book sizes using a simple lug system without the need for any bolts or fixings. Although the bookstacks were decorated and very simply embellished, they are of machine-age industrial design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.salvoweb.com/salvonews/item-snead-cast-iron-bookstack-features-at-hindmans-chicago-sale_23258 |title=Snead cast iron bookstack features at Hindman's Chicago sale |website=salvoweb.com |date= |accessdate=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stacks were typically envisioned for access by library staff fetching books for patrons waiting elsewhere, and so were often built in ways making them unsuitable for public access.  Increasing concern with opening stacks to the public,&lt;ref name="ELH" /&gt; the desire to construct buildings adaptable to changing uses,&lt;ref name="petroski" /&gt; and concerns over the feasibility of storing truly comprehensive collections of books contributed to the decline of the Snead stack. [[Angus Snead Macdonald]], president of the Snead Company from 1915 to 1952, himself advocated for the transition to modular, open plan libraries in the mid twentieth century.&lt;ref name="ELH" /&gt;

==Forms==
For closed stacks, [[mobile shelving]] may be used to minimize floor space.  With computerized indexing, filing by book size saves up to 40% space as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Quito|first1=Anne|title=The New York Public Library has adopted a very unusual sorting system|url=http://qz.com/802744/the-legendary-new-york-public-library-shelves-books-in-its-underground-stacks-by-size-not-subject/|accessdate=13 October 2016|work=[[Quartz (publication)]]|publisher=[[Atlantic Media]]|date=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10860">'''Literary space''' – a model of the world presented in a literary work.

== Approaches to literary space ==

=== The past approach ===
Space in the 20th century was regarded as a part of various literary spheres, such as the narrative situation. It changed only in the last decade of the period. Since then literary space has been treated as an independent and unique entity, semantic centre of the work, while such notions as the time of action or characters became its particularizations.&lt;ref&gt;Sławiński, Janusz (2000). ”Przestrzeń w literaturze: elementarne rozróżnienia i wstępne oczywistości”. ''Próby teoretycznoliterackie. Prace wybrane''. Ed. Włodzimierz Bolecki. Kraków: Universitas. pp. 195-97.&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== The modern approaches ===
==== Yuri Lotman ====

The first person to approach the issue of literary space from the semiotic point of view was [[Yuri Lotman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Universe of the Mind: A Semiotic Theory of Culture|last=Lotman|first=Yuri|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1990|isbn=|location=Bloomington:|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lotman, artistic space is only a model of real space, not its copy. He argued that the information provided by the text about space is incomplete and, consequently, space also is not complete. Being discontinued (what is not mentioned in the text does not exist), space cannot be reconstructed by the implied reader (Lotman 1977, &lt;nowiki&gt;''Przestrzeń artystyczna w prozie Gogola''&lt;/nowiki&gt;, p.213).

What is more, Lotman broached in his literary studies the question of the relationship between space in the text and space of the real world. He claimed both space organisations are governed by cultural stereotypes and conventions, which serve as kind of a &lt;nowiki&gt;'mediator' between them. However, while additional senses are imposed on textual space by cultural codes, extratextual space uses the reworked ones. Through textual hints (described customs, clothing, etc.) literary space can refer to more general knowledge of the implied reader of the empirical reality. The aim of this measure is to make possible the association of the fictional world with the experiential one not calling it as if ''&lt;/nowiki&gt;by name”.&lt;ref&gt;Lotman, Yuri (1977). &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;Przestrzeń artystyczna w prozie Gogola.” ''Semiotyka kultury''. Eds. E .Janus and M. R. Mayenowa. Warszawa: PIW. pp. 220-221.&lt;/ref&gt;

Utilizing extratextual patterns, the author of a literary work creates their own vision of the world and they do it through the use of description. Limited just like description&lt;ref&gt;Lotman, Yuri (1977). &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;Przestrzeń artystyczna w prozie Gogola.” ''Semiotyka kultury''. Eds. E .Janus and M. R. Mayenowa. Warszawa: PIW. pp. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;, such an authorial model does not exist beyond the textual frames and is composed of relations resulting from senses imposed on space. Those, in turn, may suggest non-spatial meanings (e.g. ''up'' is better, ''down'' is worse as in the case of a social hierarchy of [[H. G. Wells|H.G. Wells]]' ''[[The Time Machine]]'' and the Morlocks and the Eloi):&lt;blockquote&gt;''Literary space represents an author's model of the world, expressed in the language of spatial representation. In a literary work, space models different relations of the world-picture: temporary, social, ethical and others. […] in the literary models of the world―space sometimes metaphorically adopts meanings of relations in the modelled world-structure, that are themselves not spatial at all.''&lt;ref&gt;Lotman, Yuri (1977). ''The Structure of the Artistic Text.'' pp.&amp;nbsp;218''.'' &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Janusz Sławiński ====

[[:pl:Janusz_Sławiński_(filolog)|Janusz Sławiński]] considered the presented reality to be the most fundamental code modelling space, understood as the principles organising the thematic-compositional plane of a single literary work.&lt;ref&gt;Sławiński, Janusz (2000). ”Przestrzeń w literaturze: elementarne rozróżnienia i wstępne oczywistości”. ''Próby teoretycznoliterackie. Prace wybrane''. Ed. Włodzimierz Bolecki. Kraków: Universitas. pp. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; This reality is the construction of words, the result of all the linguistic as well as stylistic choices which are made by the implied author, and as such, does not exist beyond the text. It is vital not only to imagine space but also to follow the narration, the description, and the course of action, since all those may shape the fictitious reality by imposing the additional meanings on it.&lt;ref&gt;Sławiński, Janusz (2000). ”Przestrzeń w literaturze: elementarne rozróżnienia i wstępne oczywistości”. ''Próby teoretycznoliterackie. Prace wybrane''. Ed. Włodzimierz Bolecki. Kraków: Universitas. pp. 198-99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Literary/cultural conventions constitute the second space-modelling code. This system is more abstract one than the previous one. It does not refer to how an individual work shapes space but how it is conventionally done by a given epoch, genre, etc. So, for instance, one of the main features of Gothic novels are elements of the supernatural and the sublime&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.shmoop.com/gothic-literature/supernatural-sublime-characteristic.html|title=The Supernatural and the Sublime|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, therefore, texts are full of ghosts, vampires and so on.&lt;ref&gt;Sławiński, Janusz (2000). ”Przestrzeń w literaturze: elementarne rozróżnienia i wstępne oczywistości”. ''Próby teoretycznoliterackie. Prace wybrane''. Ed. Włodzimierz Bolecki. Kraków: Universitas. pp. 198-200.&lt;/ref&gt;

Language is the last of codes shaping space. Every language models space in a different manner. The language of geography, for example, differentiates [[Cardinal direction|cardinal and intercardinal directions]], among others, west or north-east, while geometry uses [[Relative direction|relative directions]], for instance, left/right/backward(s)/forward(s). In short, it can be said that language organises space in a way, defines it, and provides terms for various types of spatial arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Sławiński, Janusz (2000). ”Przestrzeń w literaturze: elementarne rozróżnienia i wstępne oczywistości”. ''Próby teoretycznoliterackie. Prace wybrane''. Ed. Włodzimierz Bolecki. Kraków: Universitas. pp. 200-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, Sławiński put an emphasis on description, scenery and superimposed senses, three interrelated planes influencing space (Sławiński 2000, p. 205)

The descriptive plane is the aspect of narration and consists of words. It is especially crucial to space when it is introduced to the implied reader. The spatial relationship would be impossible to define without description. It describes space directly or implies it, developing together with characters' movements.&lt;ref&gt;Sławiński, Janusz (2000). ”Przestrzeń w literaturze: elementarne rozróżnienia i wstępne oczywistości”. ''Próby teoretycznoliterackie. Prace wybrane''. Ed. Włodzimierz Bolecki. Kraków: Universitas. pp. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; This 'development' makes the description a dynamic notion in a sense that it creates meanings. Certain elements of the description relate to each other not only on the grammatical but also semantic level. For example, there are relations between words and phrases. Added-on meanings imposed on particular fragments of a text are, for instance, the consequence of such relations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Sławiński, Janusz (2000). ”Przestrzeń w literaturze: elementarne rozróżnienia i wstępne oczywistości”. ''Próby teoretycznoliterackie. Prace wybrane''. Ed. Włodzimierz Bolecki. Kraków: Universitas. pp. 207-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to description, scenery is considered to be a static entity as it results from description. Description producing scenery may consist of a single block of text or scenery can be the effect of numerous descriptive references in such a text put together.&lt;ref&gt;Sławiński, Janusz (2000). ”Przestrzeń w literaturze: elementarne rozróżnienia i wstępne oczywistości”. ''Próby teoretycznoliterackie. Prace wybrane''. Ed. Włodzimierz Bolecki. Kraków: Universitas. pp. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

Superimposed senses are the last plane. They are a structure caring added-on meanings. They are not conditioned in any way and are type of a subcode which shapes non-spatial relationships and values (Sławiński 2000, p. 212).

==== Mieczysław Porębski ====

According to [[:pl:Mieczysław_Porębski|Mieczysław Porębski]] space can be divided into three types, namely, extratextual, intertextual and intratextual.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Porębski, Mieczysław (1978). &lt;nowiki&gt;''O wielości przestrzeni''&lt;/nowiki&gt;. ''Przestrzeń i literatura''. Wrocław: Ossolineum. pp. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; The first is where works of art are stored. It is physical, 3-dimensional and, therefore, can be ''experienced'' by readers (e.g. libraries). The second type is space only in a metaphorical sense, a set of conventions, of common fields of references for a certain piece of writing. It may refer either to other texts or literary traditions (just like [[J. R. R. Tolkien|J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s ''The Hobbit'' by the appearance of dwarves alludes to, for instance, fairy tales), or both, and as such, intertextual space is an abstract notion. The last space differentiated by Porębski is, intratextual space, is what can be called 'an intentional space' since it is implied&lt;ref&gt;Ingarden, Roman''. The Literary Work of Art.''&lt;/ref&gt; and, provoked by the text itself, exists only in the implied reader's imagination.

Porębski derived three subspaces from the intratextual space: physical, symbolical and mathematical ones.&lt;ref&gt;Porębski, Mieczysław (1978). &lt;nowiki&gt;''O wielości przestrzeni''&lt;/nowiki&gt;. ''Przestrzeń i literatura''. Wrocław: Ossolineum. p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;The physical space is considered to be an intricate structure, not ordered. What is more, it is 3-dimensional to characters and infinite (lines of length, etc. can be prolonged as much as one wishes them to). The symbolical type of space&lt;ref&gt;Porębski, Mieczysław (1978). &lt;nowiki&gt;''O wielości przestrzeni''&lt;/nowiki&gt;. ''Przestrzeń i literatura''. Wrocław: Ossolineum. p. 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt; is the way in which culture arranges it. It is the most primary type of spatial organisation, and it is so crucial due to its metaphysical and eschatological dimension but only when some additional meanings are endows otherwise semantically neutral space. The mathematical type of space can be divided further into topological and geometrical spaces. The former shows how space is perceived in both cultural and mythological way, having much in common with a symbolical space, the latter uses map features, e.g. distances, symmetries, proportions, etc.

'''Living Colour''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[New York City]], formed in 1984. Stylistically, the band's music is a creative fusion influenced by [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[funk]], [[jazz]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[punk rock|punk]], and [[alternative rock]]. Their lyrics range from the personal to the political, in some of the latter cases attacking [[Eurocentrism]] and racism in America.

Living Colour rose to fame with their debut album ''[[Vivid (Living Colour album)|Vivid]]'' in 1988.&lt;ref name="The Great Rock Discography"&gt;{{cite book

==History==

===Early years (1984–1986)===
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2008}}
English-born guitarist [[Vernon Reid]] had formed a number of bands, and after a few years, he formed Living Colour in New York in 1984. Reid assembled a number of bands under the name Vernon Reid's Living Colour from 1984 to 1986.&lt;ref name="rs"&gt;{{cite web|title=Living Colour's Time Is Now|author=David Fricke|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/living-colours-time-is-now-19901101|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=November 1, 1990|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912232142/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/living-colours-time-is-now-19901101|archivedate=September 12, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reid was well known on the downtown New York jazz scenes because of his tenure in [[Ronald Shannon Jackson]]'s Decoding Society.

Early band members included bassists Alex Mosely, [[Jerome Harris]] and Carl James, drummers Greg Carter, [[Pheeroan akLaff]] and J.T. Lewis, keyboardist [[Geri Allen]], and vocalists D.K. Dyson and [[Mark Ledford]], with Reid occasionally singing lead vocals himself. The band's sound was vastly different from the songs that showed up later on their major label recordings. Material from this period included instrumental jazz/funk workouts, politically pointed [[punk rock]] burners, experimental excursions via Reid's guitar synth, and an early version of the song "[[Funny Vibe]]", which was reworked for their debut album ''[[Vivid (Living Colour album)|Vivid]]''.

===Mainstream success (1986–1991)===
[[File:Living-colour-live1993.jpg|thumb|Living Colour in 1993]]
In 1986 a stable lineup was formed, consisting of vocalist/actor [[Corey Glover]], guitarist [[Vernon Reid]], bassist [[Muzz Skillings]], and drummer [[Will Calhoun]] (who had graduated with honors from [[Berklee College of Music]]),&lt;ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/&gt; and the band hired managers Jim Grant and Roger Cramer.  Soon after, the band became experienced at touring, including performing regular gigs at the club [[CBGB]]. ''[[Vivid (Living Colour album)|Vivid]]'', released on May 3, 1988, gathered sales momentum only when later that year, [[MTV]] began playing the [[music video|video]] for "[[Cult of Personality (song)|Cult of Personality]]". The album reached No.&amp;nbsp;6 on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. On April 1, 1989, the band performed on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. Four months later, the band gained further exposure as an opening act, along with [[Guns N' Roses]], for [[The Rolling Stones]]' [[Steel Wheels/Urban Jungle Tour]].

In 1990 the band's second full-length album, ''[[Time's Up (Living Colour album)|Time's Up]]'', featured songs in numerous musical contexts; [[jazz fusion]], punk rock, [[Delta blues]], hip hop (cameos by [[Queen Latifah]] and [[Doug E. Fresh]]), funk, thrash metal, [[Jive (genre)|jive]], and hints of [[electronica]] were all represented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Living Colour Time's Up |author= Greg Prato |url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/times-up-mw0000315449 |work= [[AllMusic]] |accessdate= August 21, 2015 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150806185836/http://www.allmusic.com/album/times-up-mw0000315449 |archivedate= August 6, 2015 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The album reached No.&amp;nbsp;13 on the ''Billboard'' 200,&lt;ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/&gt; and won a [[Grammy Award]] for Best Hard Rock Performance. Other guests included [[Maceo Parker]] and [[Little Richard]].&lt;ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/&gt;

In 1991, Living Colour joined the inaugural [[Lollapalooza]] tour, and released an EP of outtakes entitled ''[[Biscuits (EP)|Biscuits]]''.&lt;ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/&gt;

===Second line-up and breakup (1992–1995)===
In 1992, Skillings left the band and was replaced by [[Doug Wimbish]].&lt;ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/&gt; This new line up released their third full-length album, ''[[Stain (album)|Stain]]'', in March 1993. The album reached No.&amp;nbsp;26 in the U.S., a further drop since their debut.&lt;ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/&gt;

Despite retaining their strong fan base, Living Colour disbanded in January 1995, after failing to settle on a common musical goal during sessions for their fourth studio album.&lt;ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/&gt; Four of these tracks were included on the compilation ''[[Pride (Living Colour album)|Pride]]''.

Following the breakup, individual band members released a variety of solo efforts.

===Reunion and subsequent events (2000–present)===
Living Colour reformed on December 21, 2000, at [[CBGB]] as a gig billed "Head&gt;&gt;Fake w/ special guests". Head&gt;&gt;Fake was the current [[drum and bass]] project headed by Calhoun and Wimbish. Glover was on the bill to sing a few songs and Reid came on after three songs. The reunion was followed by the release of the band's fourth studio album, ''[[Collideøscope]]'', in 2003, their first album not to chart in the United States, although it was critically praised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Review: Living Colour Collideoscope|author= Davey Boy |url= https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/29750/Living-Colour-Collideoscope/|work= [[Sputnikmusic]] |date=March 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Living Colour Collideoscope|author=Dave Mount|url=http://www.prefixmag.com/reviews/living-colour/collideoscope/13482/|work=Prefixmag|date=March 6, 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924124749/http://www.prefixmag.com/reviews/living-colour/collideoscope/13482/|archivedate=September 24, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Sony Records released ''[[Live from CBGB's]]'', a live album recorded on December 19, 1989, as well as another [[compilation album|best-of compilation]], ''[[Everything Is Possible: The Very Best of Living Colour]]'', with songs from ''Vivid'' to ''Collideøscope''.

[[File:Living Colour - Sziget Fesztivál, 2006.08.15 (12).jpg|thumb|Sziget Festival - 2006.08.15]]
In August 2006, Glover took on the role of [[Judas Iscariot]] in a national tour of ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'', touring with ''JCS'' veteran [[Ted Neeley]]. [[Doug Pinnick]], vocalist and bassist of [[King's X]], filled in for Glover on lead vocals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livingcolourmusic.com/2006/07/note-from-vernon-reid.html|title=Note from Vernon Reid|author=|date=|website=www.livingcolourmusic.com|accessdate=5 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704041355/http://www.livingcolourmusic.com/2006/07/note-from-vernon-reid.html|archivedate=4 July 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glover's tour of the musical ran through June 2008, and he then rejoined the band. On September 22, 2006, Skillings joined the band for the first time in fourteen years when they played at a private party which drummer [[Jack DeJohnette]] threw for his wife Lydia. Wimbish was unable to come back from his base in London to play for the event, so Skillings agreed to take over for the special private event.

The band performed a week-long European Tour starting on December 12, 2006. In May 2007, the band released their first live DVD - ''[[On Stage At World Cafe Live]]''. On July 11, 2008, the band performed at the 1980s hard rock-themed [[Rocklahoma]] festival at [[Pryor, Oklahoma|Pryor]], Oklahoma. Once again, Skillings performed with them in August 2008 for a Black Rock Coalition [[Band of Gypsys]] tribute in Harlem. They performed "Them Changes" and "Power of Soul".

On October 25, 2008, MVD Audio and CBGB Records released ''CBGB OMFUG MASTERS: August 19, 2005 The Bowery Collection'', a soundboard collection of songs from the Save CBGB's benefit show. On November 25, 2008, Inakustik and MVD released ''The Paris Concert (Living Colour DVD)|The Paris Concert'', a [[DVD]] recorded at [[New Morning (club)|New Morning]], in Paris, France, during their 2007 European Tour. The band released their fifth studio album, ''[[The Chair in the Doorway]]'', on September 15, 2009 on Megaforce Records. The album sold approximately 2,800 copies in its first week and landed at No.&amp;nbsp;159 on the ''Billboard'' 200. This was the band's first album to chart since ''Stain'' in 1993. The band toured the world in support of the record.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/268175/living-colour-back-with-fifth-studio-album Living Colour Back With Fifth Studio Album] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130423122206/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/268175/living-colour-back-with-fifth-studio-album |date=2013-04-23 }} Billboard.com. Retrieved on 2009-07-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview on breakdownroom.net, Glover hoped to release another album with the band next year. "We're going to do something different [for us] and make a real record, right now, right after we've done this one," Glover said with a laugh. The band's song "Cult of Personality" received fresh exposure from 2011, as it was used as the entrance music for [[professional wrestler]] [[CM Punk]]. In 2013, Living Colour performed the song live during Punk's entrance at [[WrestleMania 29]].

On July 2, 2014 Living Colour announced on their official website that they were putting the finishing touches on their upcoming sixth album ''[[Shade (Living Colour album)|Shade]]'', which was released on September 8, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/living-colour-to-release-shade-album-in-september-cover-artwork-unveiled/|title=LIVING COLOUR To Release 'Shade' Album In September; Cover Artwork Unveiled|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=May 12, 2017|accessdate=May 14, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170515024742/http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/living-colour-to-release-shade-album-in-september-cover-artwork-unveiled/|archivedate=May 15, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "''Shade'' is the sound of a band coming to terms with its shadows and light, From the blue pulpit of Robert Johnson to the mean red streets of Brooklyn to the golden lure of Hollywood, ''Shade'' is the next chapter of a unique American journey," Reid stated on the official website.

==Acclaim and legacy==
Living Colour was ranked No.&amp;nbsp;70 on [[VH1]]'s ''100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxm64mApR05CJVCePlmcUFluSZyiAvKZ8|title=VH1 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock - YouTube|author=|date=|website=YouTube|accessdate=5 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170521004536/https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxm64mApR05CJVCePlmcUFluSZyiAvKZ8|archivedate=21 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Cult of Personality (song)|Cult of Personality]]" was part of the ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' repertoire of radio songs in [[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas soundtrack|Radio X]]. It was also the first song to be confirmed for the track list of ''[[Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock]]''. The version featured in ''Guitar Hero III'' is a new master recording of the song that features an updated solo, as the original masters could not be used.

In October 2006, "[[Love Rears Its Ugly Head]]" was ranked and voted 303 out of the 2006 songs featured in the [[Triple M]] Essential 2006 Countdown.

''[[Rolling Stone]]'' have called the band "[[funk metal]] pioneers."&lt;ref name="RS Living Colour"&gt;Fricke, David (November 13, 2003).

In early 2009, [[WWE]] used "[[Cult of Personality (song)|Cult of Personality]]" in the video promoting the induction of [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] into its Hall of Fame. WWE performer [[CM Punk]] used the song as his entrance theme in [[Ring of Honor]] for a period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlescoop.com/2011/07/27/what-happened-after-smackdown-punks-theme-song-updates-on-finlay-cara/|title=What Happened After SmackDown, Punk’s Theme Song, Updates on Finlay &amp; Cara - WRESTLESCOOP|author=|date=28 July 2016|website=wrestlescoop.com|accessdate=5 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304204845/http://www.wrestlescoop.com/2011/07/27/what-happened-after-smackdown-punks-theme-song-updates-on-finlay-cara/|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; CM Punk used other licensed music while working with WWE, but, after feigning a departure from the company in July 2011, he returned with "Cult of Personality" as his entrance theme. CM Punk also entered to the song at his debut in the world of [[mixed martial arts]] at [[UFC 203]] and subsequently at [[UFC 225]] for his fight versus Mike Jackson.

Marforio maintained a friendly rivalry with his most prominent rival, [[Pasquin]]. As at the other five "talking statues", [[pasquinade]]s — irreverent [[satire]]s poking fun at public figures — were posted beside Marforio in the 16th and 17th centuries.

==The statue and its location==
Marforio is a large 1st century [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[marble]] sculpture of a reclining bearded [[river god]] or [[Oceanus]],&lt;ref&gt;The restoration of his right hand, grasping a shell, was inspired by, and supported, the identification as Oceanus.&lt;/ref&gt; which in the past has been variously identified as a depiction of [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]], [[Neptune (god)|Neptune]], or the [[Tiber]]. It was the humanist and antiquarian [[Andrea Fulvio]] who first identified it as a river god, in 1527.&lt;ref&gt;Fulvio, ''Antiquitatis Urbis'' 1527, noted by Francis Haskell and Nicholas Penny, ''Taste and the Antique: The Lure of Classical Sculpture 1500-1900'' (Yale University Press) 1981:259.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Marfoi'' was a landmark in Rome from the late 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;Roberto Valentini and Giuseppe Zucchetti, ''Codice topographa della Città di Roma'' (1940-53) vol. III: p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Poggio Bracciolini]] wrote of it as one of the sculptures surviving from Antiquity,&lt;ref&gt;Bracciolini, ''De varietate fortunae'', written over a long period, ca 1430 to 1445.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the early 16th century it was still near the [[Arch of Septimius Severus]], where the various authors reported it.&lt;ref&gt;Haskell and Penny 1981:258.&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of its name is a matter of some debate.  It was discovered with a granite basin bearing the inscription "mare in foro",&lt;ref&gt;The black and white granite basin was shifted to form a fountain for watering cattle in the Campo  Vaccino, as the [[Roman Forum]] had become; it was removed in 1818 to stand before one of the [[Horse Tamers]] on the [[Quirinal Hill]], often known in the past as ''Alexander and Bucephalus'' (Haskell and Penny 1981:136, 258.&lt;/ref&gt; but may take its name from the Latin name for the area in which it was discovered (''Martis Forum''), or from the Marioli (or Marfuoli) family who owned property near the [[Mamertine Prison]], also near the forum, where the statue was sited until 1588.

[[Pope Sixtus V]] had the statue moved to the [[San Marco, Rome|Piazza San Marco, (in Rome)]] in 1588, and then to the [[piazza del Campidoglio]] in 1592, where it decorates a fountain designed by [[Giacomo Della Porta]] on a wall of the [[Santa Maria in Aracoeli|Basilica di Santa Maria in Ara Coeli]], facing the ''[[Palazzo dei Conservatori]]''. In 1645, the building of the ''Palazzo Nuovo'' enclosed the fountain.  Part of the face, the right foot, and the left hand holding a shell were restored in 1594.  The statue was moved again in the 17th century, at the order of [[Pope Innocent X]], who had it placed in the courtyard of the Palazzo dei Conservatori, where it remains today.

In [[theoretical physics]], '''modular invariance''' is the invariance under the [[group (mathematics)|group]] such as SL(2,Z) of [[large diffeomorphism]]s of the [[torus]]. The name comes from the classical name [[modular group]] of this group, as in [[modular form]] theory.

In [[string theory]], modular invariance is an additional requirement for [[one-loop diagram]]s. This helps in getting rid of some [[global anomaly|global anomalies]] such as the [[gravitational anomaly|gravitational anomalies]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7450">'''Mono-ha''' (もの派) is the name given to a group of 20th-century Japanese artists. The Mono-ha artists explored the encounter between natural and industrial materials, such as stone, steel plates, glass, light bulbs, cotton, sponge, paper, wood, wire, rope, leather, oil, and water, arranging them in mostly unaltered, ephemeral states. The works focus as much on the interdependency of these various elements and the surrounding space as on the materials themselves.

==Origin of the Term “Mono-ha” and its Members==

“Mono-ha” is usually translated in a literal manner, as “School of Things.” The Mono-ha artists regularly assert that “Mono-ha” was a term disparagingly coined by critics (specifically Teruo Fujieda and Toshiaki Minemura  in ''Bijutsu Techo'' magazine in 1973) well after they had begun to exhibit their work, and they did not begin as an organized collective. Many of the Mono-ha artists were first exhibited at Tamura and Maki Galleries in Tokyo owned by Nobuo[[(Shinro) Yamagiishi]] who was also an art writer and whose archives are in the collection of [[The National Art Center Tokyo]].

Toshiaki Minemura explains in his 1986 essay “What Was Mono-ha?,” that in terms of their academic background and intellectual exchange, the Mono-ha artists are divided into three groups:&lt;ref&gt;Minemura, Toshiaki. [https://www.kamakura.gallery/mono-ha/minemura-en.html "What was MONO-HA?"], ''MONO-HA'', Kamakura Gallery, 1986, p.6&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''"The [[Lee Ufan|Lee]] + [[Tama Art University|Tamabi]] Connection.”''' This comprises [[Nobuo Sekine]], [[Kishio Suga]], Shingo Honda, Katsuhiko Narita and Katsurō Yoshida in the painting department, and  [[Susumu Koshimizu]] in the sculpture department at [[Tama Art University]] (aka Tamabi) as well as [[Jiro Takamatsu]] and [[Lee Ufan]], a Korean artist who is a close friend of Sekine. 
# '''“The [[Tokyo University of the Arts|Geidai Connection]],”''' a group of artists around [[Kōji Enokura]] and Noboru Takayama, who were both graduates of the [[Tokyo University of the Arts]] (aka Geidai), and Hiroshi Fujii and Makoto Habu, who were involved in Mono-ha later on. 
# '''“The [[Nihon University|Nichidai]] Connection,”''' students from the [[Nihon University]] (aka Nichidai) Fine Arts Department—whose central figure was Noriyuki Haraguchi—also known as the “Yokosuka Group,” due to Haraguchi’s upbringing in Yokosuka and his critique of the local US military presence through his work.&lt;ref&gt;''Kishio Suga''. Los Angeles: Blum &amp; Poe, 2012, p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socio-Political Context==

Mono-ha emerged in response to a number of social, cultural and political precedents set in the 1960s. With the exception of Lee Ufan, who was a decade older, most of the Mono-ha artists were just beginning their careers when the violent student protests of 1968–69 occurred.

At the same time, there was much protest against the second extension of the US-Japan Security Treaty (known in abbreviated Japanese as ''[[Anpo]]'') in 1970, binding Japan into providing logistical support for the US war in Vietnam. Coupled with demands for the reversion of [[Okinawa]] by 1972 and the removal of nuclear weapons based there, the climate of protest during this period was symptomatic of a growing distrust of the United States’ intentions towards Asia and its dominant position in the bilateral relationship with Japan. The activism of the “''Anpo'' generation” gave rise to a highly intellectual counterculture that was both critical of US “[[imperialism]]” and acutely self-aware of its Japanese identity.&lt;ref&gt;Munroe, Alexandra. ''Japanese Art After 1945: Scream Against the Sky''. Harry N. Abrams Inc, 1994. p.215&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mono-ha artists typically deny involvement with student activist movements at the time, though it is thought that the tense political climate influenced their work, allowing them to grapple with and make sense of their unease and disillusionment with postwar modernity in their different ways.

==Recent Attention in the United States==

In 2012, [[Blum &amp; Poe]] gallery introduced the Mono-ha art into the US with the survey exhibition “Requiem for the Sun: The Art of Mono-ha,” curated by Mika Yoshitake. The gallery has also held solo exhibitions of [[Lee Ufan]], [[Kishio Suga]], [[Susumu Koshimizu]], [[Koji Enokura]], and [[Nobuo Sekine]].

'''Singapore Murals''' is an integral part of the nation's aspiration of being a renaissance city but is under developed. A Public [[Mural]] is a source of heritage building, expression of the [[arts]], national education, interactivity of interests groups.

==Publications==

There are many publications found globally that showcase street art (both graffiti and commission works). However, there are not sufficient resources in Singapore. For example, in Page One bookstores dozens of books about Vandalism on Trains can be found.

==Location==
In [[Singapore]], public murals exist primarily in three aspects:

===Commercially commissioned works===

[[File:Radin Mas Community Centre Mural1.png|thumb|right|alt=A mural at the Radin Mas Community Centre. |A mural at the Radin Mas Community Centre]]

This mainly take the form of corporate malls but more prominently by the [[Land Transport Authority (Singapore)|Land Transport Authority]] in its building of Mass Rapid Trains. The theory of "the less the artist is paid, the more autonomy he has" is very relevant to understand of murals.

===Void-decks and facade of centres===
The Singapore residential area is mainly high rise HDB Flats. The first floor of HDB Flats&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hdb.gov.sg HDB.gov.sg]&lt;/ref&gt; is commonly used by Educational Centres, venue of Residential Committees/Community Clubs. These centres do carry some murals.

===The inbetweens or the "illegals"===
[[Street Art]] does exist in between sewage drains, the back of alleys and landed properties and even power boxes.

==History==
The oldest mural in Singapore can be traced to [[Changi Murals]], which still are in existence. There were previous recorded murals in Orchard Road and some parks. However, they do not exist currently.

===Orchard Road===
In 1985, Organised by Wisma Development Pte Ltd and Forum Development Pte Ltd attracted [[Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts]] and St Patricks's Arts Centre to create 7 murals along Orchard Road. The hoardings at Atria was divided into 14 panels per team, each panel were 4.5m to 2.2m. The painting themes were evolution of shopping in Singapore and evolution of lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newspapers.nl.sg/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19850805.2.25.20.aspx Newspapers.nl.sg]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chijmes===
[[File:Chijmes Mural.png|thumb|left|1987 Chijmes Mural.]]

The next prominent mural in Singapore arrives at the facade of Chijmes in 1987. Le Mur Lion; The Lion Wall, portrays and tells through imagery the rousing myth about a lion and its struggling journey towards finding a better world. Stretched across the walls on Brash Basah Road estimated to be about 125 meters, it was apparently assumed to be the longest wall mural in Singapore.

===Bras Basah Murals===
In 2004, the [[Urban Redevelopment Authority]] introduced the Bras Basah Murals. Named after the 1815 [[Battle of Waterloo]], Waterloo street is now known for its rich housing towards the arts.

To further enhance this area as a hub for Arts, Culture, Learning and Entertainment three wall murals have since been produced and unveiled along Waterloo Street. These murals were a collaborative effort from the students of NAFA and Lasalle-SIA and URA (Urban Redevelopment Authority).

Located at the boundary wall of Stamford arts centre, the first two wall murals located at the wall of Stamford Arts Centre, were painted by URA and Lasalle-sia students. The art direction for these two murals was to bring out the unique blend of architecture in the area. A significant amount of different colours was used to represent architecture and rich cultural heritage that is prominent with the many religious buildings in the Bras Basah area.

The third mural, which was produced by NAFA, is meant to depict the challenges women face in our society. The site-specific mural, which stands next to the SCWO Centre further instills the message.

===2010 Bras Basah Complex Mural===

The project was facilitated through the assistance of the National Volunteerism and Philanthropy Centre that engaged the American Chambers of Commerce Day. Over 100 volunteer hours were team up together to create a colour masterpiece led by budding artist Koochi who was mentored by Asst Professor Eileen Reynolds from [[Nanyang Technological University]]. Completed on 13 November 2010, the artworks represent different colours coming together and movement forward for the Arts. The artwork was themed to "arrangement" which is similar to  books and arts. Bras Basah Complex is known for its niche of Books and Arts materials.

==Mural.sg Launch==
The beta version (Wikipedia) page of Murals.sg was launched on 19 October 2010 by Member of Parliament Ms Penny Low. The Punggol North GROs kindly hosted a tea reception for over 100 participants of the mural painting and will not be possible through the kind assistance of the Social Innovation Park and PCF.

Through the assistance of the National Volunteerism and Philanthropy Centre, over 15 collaborations were made to further strengthen murals painting in Singapore. Their assistance include the introduction of corporate volunteers and funds.

==People involved==
* Mentor Artist: Professional artists, lecturers and practicing artists who have organised exhibitions both solo and group
before.  They concentrate of specific themes and styles. Their take away are acts are sharing of talents, education to youths and volunteerism.
* Budding Artists: Students of Art or working adults who does art as a hobby. They received avenues of expression, opportunities of interactions, character development.
* Interest Groups (non-artists): People with similar attributes or affiliated with a registered charity i.e. youths at risks, elderly etc. This include corporate volunteers as well and/or social service groups. Art therapy, team bonding and community message.

==Internationalisation==

In the United Kingdom, the Off The Wall organisation brought Invergorden Mural Trail that was officiated by Her Princess Royal and the total transformation costs over GBP 220,000. It was commissioned by the [[European Union]].

Programmes such as City of Philadelphia Mural Arts Programme, City Without Walls in New Jersey, Community Murals in UK and many others work towards addressing key issues and concerns in the society such as affordable housing, health, education and other issues, and at the same time bringing communities together.

==Mural Organisations==
There were quite a number of organisations and public bodies coming up with murals. However, most of them are ad hoc efforts. For example, the URA Bras Basah Murals are currently peeling off at this very second.

===*scape===
*scape started as a department of youth ventures in the National Youth Council (government) but later become a company limited by guarantee. It manages the Skate Park, Youth Park and *scape centre. With an emphasis of a youth space, many activities are organised. A whole building mural at *scape centre was launched. There used to be an area at youth park where any artist can paint on the walls. However, since 2008, prior approval was needed. *scape activities seemed to be within their spaces.  In August 2014, *scape engaged Built from Skratch, Project Burnerz (Asno Doink, S13 &amp; Myow) and KiddVybe &amp; his Brother Syafiq to recreate a new mural

==Challenges of Singapore Murals==
Singapore Murals faced several main challenges.

* Overlap of government involvement without a clear direction on whose mandate are public murals. Is Community Art more Community or Artistic, and both have different ministries looking into its development.
* Strict [[vandalism]] laws which were highlighted by a recent vandalism on [[Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)|MRT Train]] by a [[Swiss people|Swiss National]].
* No free walls. *scape allows artists in particular graffiti artists to spray cans on their walls. However, from 2008 prior approval of artwork was needed.
* Artistic delivery. As most venues belong are in community space, public murals are at the risk of being too inline with government campaigns in their artworks. On 08.07.2010, [[The Straits Times]] reported that an anti-drug mural was completed.
* Dilution of artistic merits because of government being too involved. In 2012, the government issued a 210million dollars for arts-culture community engagement. However, the amount went mainly to People's Association that hires an untrained arts officer at each community club (approx 84).&lt;ref&gt;http://news.asiaone.com/News/Latest%2BNews/Singapore/Story/A1Story20120410-338803.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artwork==
Singapore Murals goes beyond [[painting]]. Murals in MRT Trains do contain built in wall sculptures as well as cemented drawings. Murals which are painting based seemed to relate greater to graffiti than [[fine arts]]. Here are some of the murals found in Singapore

===Mural about Baharudin Vocational Institute===
[[File:Baharudin Vocational Institute.png|thumb|right|alt=A mural at the Baharuddin Vocational Institute. |A mural at the Baharuddin Vocational Institute]]
[[File:Mint Museum2.png|thumb|Mural at the Mint Museum of Toys.]]

Being one of the first ever art devoted school; Baharuddin Vocational Institute grew from humble grounds. From various name changes over the years and starting without a building of their own, they had to resort to borrowing premises to house their students.

In 1970, they moved into their own building where they housed students undertaking courses from graphic design to doll making. Baharuddin Vocational Institute was more than just a school. I say this because as surprising as it may seem now, it was the first and only school to provide art courses in the 1970s. Thus being the only faculty that taught students everything artistically involved, Baharuddin Vocational Institute gave birth to our very first locally taught creative individuals. These individuals such as Zoe Tay and Makansutra’s KF Seetoh were great additions to Singapore’s creative industry.

===Mint Museum===
Opened on 5 March 2007, [[Mint Museum of Toys|Mint (Moment of Imagination and Nostalgia with Toys) Museum]] was illuminated with is signature mural designed and painted by [[Norway|Norwegian]] artist, Einstein Kristiansen.

&lt;!--  Commented out: [[File:Mint Museum.png|thumb|right|alt=The Mint Museum of Toys' signature mural designed and painted by Norwegian artist, Einstein Kristiansen.|The Mint Museum of Toys' signature mural designed and painted by Norwegian [[artist]], Einstein Kristiansen. {{deletable image-caption|Friday, October 22, 2010|date=October 2010}}]] --&gt;

The main artistic direction as quoted by Mr. Kristiansen "The first piece of art a child does, when introduced to a pencil"

With vast use of colours, texture through shading and meticulous details, this mural was entitled "Krusedulle". Krusedulle, the Norwegian word for doodles is meant to depict the museum and the collectables of the toys it carries.

This mural is dissected into five panels.

===Tribute to Street-Side Hawker===
[[File:Hawker Mural.png|thumb|left|Stirling Road mural dedicated to street side hawkers.]]

Located at Blk 123, Stirling Road, this mural was created in dedicatory and recognition to all street side hawkers.

===Colours of Diversity===
[[File:Colours of Diversity Mural.png|thumb|Volunteers hard at work on the Colours of Diversity Mural by Keppel Corporation and Social Creatives.]]

In Social Creatives series of 20 murals around Queenstown, Colours of Diversity was the last installation to mark the end of this massive transformation project around the area. During this process, social creative managed to capture the support of Keppel Corp.; a leading organization. This led to the collaboration and community engaging experience. Keppel Volunteers decided to lend a hand while social creatives lent them the [[paint]] and [[brushes]].

===Water Polo===
[[File:Water Polo Mural.png|thumb|left|alt=The water polo mural opposite the Queenstown Swimming Complex.|The water polo mural opposite the Queenstown Swimming Complex.]]

On 11 December 2009, this mural was completed opposite the Queens Town Swimming Complex. The artist was Mr. Raziz a.k.a. Wonder. With him, a group of migrant workers actually volunteered in the production of this piece of work.

===Splat===
[[File:Splat Mural.png|thumb|right|alt=The Splat mural.|The Splat mural.]]

This mural was created by young artists Cheryl, Beryl and Ching. Entitled ''Faces of Singapore'', this black and white design features the facial expressions of all citizens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:1x4Wr9zFpiQJ:www.nac.gov.sg/static/doc/Instep/Instep_MarApr_10.pdf+splat+murals+at+middle+road&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=sg Webcache.googleusercontent.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Story of Radin Mas===
[[File:Radin Mass Community Centre Mural4.png|thumb|alt=The "Story of Radin Mas" mural.|The "Story of Radin Mas" mural.]]

This mural above depicts the life behind Radin Mas. It was led by German artist Jan Kolster and Singaporean Gladys Teo. The project engaged 200 [[elderly]] people and was launched by Mr Sam Tan, Parliamentary Secretary of the Ministry of Information, Communication and the Arts on 20 December 2010.

[[Radin Mas]] was a young and beautiful princess who unfortunately came across an ill-fated life. She was killed accidentally while someone else was trying to kill her father. Before death, her life was not much easier. She was forced to wed the evil Tengku Bagus while her father was held in captivity in a well.

===Punggol Murals===
Punggol was given a face lift with a serious dose of colour and vibrancy on from organised programmes in July to October 2010. A series of 15 walls were transformed with the help of about 500 participants from Standard Chartered Bank, Temasek Poly, NTUC Fairprice, Mercer, Daimler SEA and so on. With such massive collaboration, the participants walked away feeling proud that each and every one of them became an artist that day.

Murals currently exist in two sub towns of Punggol which are Edgedale Plains and EdgeField.

===Street (Void-Deck) Art Gallery===

In 2011, Social Creatives launched an initiative that transform the first floor and common space of a residential area into an art gallery which are inspired by the artworks of Vincent van Gogh. Another gallery was launched in 2012 but through the impressions of pop art masterpieces. This signature initiative of Social Creatives has appeared on local TV shows and even on CNN. According to an article by CNN: In straight-laced Singapore, where graffiti tag artists can get sent to prison, one void deck goes permissibly "defaced." In this case, the void deck of Block 56 on Pipit Road, MacPherson, is "defaced" with the postimpressionist works of Vincent van Gogh.&lt;ref&gt;[http://travel.cnn.com/singapore/play/macpherson-singapores-first-void-deck-art-gallery-699626]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, People's Association gave an award to the supporting grassroots organisation of Social Creatives and created a Community Arts Gallery Initiative where any community club is eligible to apply a $15,000 grant to create their own art "void deck" or community gallery. According to a Today's newspaper article, the artworks were found to be amateurish.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/events/319726994781061/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.todayonline.com/CultureAndLifestyle/EDC120903-0000007/all-aboard!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904030527/http://www.todayonline.com/CultureAndLifestyle/EDC120903-0000007/all-aboard%21 |date=4 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''New Scottish Group''' was a loose collection of artists based in Glasgow, who exhibited from 1942 to 1956. It was formed around [[John Duncan Fergusson]] after his return to Glasgow in 1939. It had its origins in the New Art Club formed in 1940, and had its first exhibition in 1942. Members did not have a common style, but shared left-wing views and were influenced by contemporary continental art. Members included Donald Bain, William Crosbie, Marie de Banzie and Isabel Babianska. Tom MacDonald, [[Bet Low]] and William Senior formed the '''Clyde Group''' to pursue political painting that manifested in urban industrial landscapes. The group helped start the careers of a generation of Glasgow-based artists and was part of a wider cultural "golden age" for the city.

==History==
[[John Duncan Fergusson]] (1874–1961), who was the longest surviving of the group of artists known as the [[Scottish Colourists]], had settled in France, but returned to Scotland in 1939, just before the outbreak of the Second World War, with his wife, the dancer and choreographer [[Margaret Morris (dancer)|Margaret Morris]] (1891–1980). There he became a leading figure of a group of younger Glasgow artists. Members of Fergusson's group formed the New Art Club in 1940, in opposition to the established [[Glasgow Art Club]]. In 1942 they held the first of what would be a series of shows of their own exhibiting society, the New Scottish Group, with Fergusson as its first president. The introduction to the catalogue of their first show was written by novelist and poet [[Naomi Mitchison]] (1897–1999).&lt;ref name="Macmillan2001p80"&gt;D. Macmillan, ''Scottish Art in the 20th century, 1890–2001'' (Mainstream, 2001), {{ISBN|1840184574}}, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; The group held annual exhibitions in the period 1943–48, and larger shows in 1951 and 1956.&lt;ref name="FergussonGalleryp14"&gt;J. Kinnear, [https://web.archive.org/web/20141218180510/http://www.pkc.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=829&amp;p=0 ''The Fergusson Gallery''] (Perth Museum &amp; Art Gallery, 2005), {{ISBN|0-907495-25-7}}, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Important to the artists was the nationalist and left-wing publisher William MacLellan, who produced a number of works of Glasgow artists in the 1940s, including Fergusson's book ''Modern Scottish Painting'' (1943), which expressed his anti-academic and democratic ideals and his desire to form a British equivalent to the French [[Société des Artistes Indépendants|Salon des Indépendants]].&lt;ref name=Macmillan1990pp369-71/&gt; Members of the group were involved in two of MacLellan's magazines in this period, supplying visual material or ''Poetry Scotland'' (1943–49) and ''Scottish Art and Letters'' (1944–50), which played an important part in disseminating ideas of the [[Scottish Renaissance]]. Fergusson designed the covers for ''Scottish Art and Letters'' and acted as its artistic director.&lt;ref&gt;M. Palmer McCulloch, "Continuing the Renaissance: little magazines and a late phase of Scottish Modernism in the 1940s", ''Etudes Ecossaises'', 15 (2012), ISSN 1240-1439, pp. 59–73.&lt;/ref&gt; Fergusson also illustrated MacLellan's edition of by [[Hugh MacDiarmid]]'s ''[[In Memoriam James Joyce]]'' (1955) and his paintings from this period included ''Danu mother of the Gods'', both of which combined elements of Celtic culture and modernism.&lt;ref name="Koch2006p112"&gt;J. T. Koch, ed., ''Celtic Culture: a Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 2'' (ABC-CLIO, 2006), {{ISBN|1851094407}}, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; In their last exhibition in 1956 the group displayed with another organisation, the Society of Scottish Independent Artists, a title that recalled Fergusson's ambition. Fergusson died in 1961.&lt;ref name=Macmillan2001p80/&gt;

==Members==
The group had no single style, but shared left-wing tendencies and included artists strongly influenced by trends in contemporary continental art. Painters involved included Donald Bain (1904–79), whose work was often crowded with rich colour and heavily worked paint, as in his ''The Striped Vase'' (1943), which was influenced by [[expressionism]].  William Crosbie (1915–99) was strongly influenced by [[surrealism]],&lt;ref name=Macmillan1990pp369-71/&gt; which can be seen in his ''Heart Knife'' (1934), an early example of a Scottish artist using the semi-abstract style derived from [[cubism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgalleries.org/collection/artists-a-z/C/3020/artist_name/William%20Crosbie/record_id/2064 "William Crosbie, Heart Knife, 1934], ''National Galleries Scotland'', retrieved 16 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Margaret Oliver Brown]] (1912–90) was known for her portraiture.&lt;ref&gt;A. Strang, ''Modern Scottish Women: Painters and Sculptors 1885-1965'' (Edinburgh: National Galleries of Scotland, 2015), {{ISBN|978-1-906270-89-6}}, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Marie de Banzie (1918–90) was influenced by expressionism and particularity the [[post-expressionism|post-expressionist]] work of [[Gauguin]], as can be seen in her 1945 painting ''Shadow'', which borrows from his Haitian pictures. Isabel Babianska (b. 1920), who had trained with de Banzie at the [[Glasgow School of Art]], was influenced by expressionist [[Chaim Soutine]], as can be seen in the collection of grotesque faces in her painting ''Fiesta'' (1943). Expressionism can also be seen as an influence on the work of Millie Frood (1900–88), in dislocated landscapes such as ''October'' (1946) and ''Turning Hay'', which included vivid colours and brushwork reminiscent of [[Van Gogh]]. Frood's urban scenes contain an element of social commentary and realism, influenced by Polish refugees [[Josef Herman]] (1911–2000), resident in Glasgow between 1940 and 1943&lt;ref name="Macmillan1990pp369-71"&gt;D. Macmillan, ''Scottish Art, 1460–1990'' (Mainstream, 1990), {{ISBN|1851582517}}, pp. 369–71.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jankel Adler]] (1895–1949), who was based in [[Kirkudbright]] from 1941–43.&lt;ref&gt;M. MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; Also influenced by Herman were husband and wife Tom MacDonald (1914–85) and  [[Bet Low]] (1924–2007), who with painter William Senior (b. 1927) formed the Clyde Group, aimed at promoting political art.

'''Niels Laurits Andreas Høyen''' (4 June 1798 &amp;ndash; 29 April 1870) is considered to be the first [[Denmark|Danish]] art historian and critic. He promoted a Danish [[nationalism|nationalistic]] art through his writings and lectures, and exerted a far reaching effect on contemporary artists. His work in various cultural institutions helped steer the development of Danish art during the mid-19th century.

== Growing up and early training ==
Høyen was born in [[Copenhagen]] to distiller Anders Larsen Høyen and wife, Inger Margrethe. He was bright and did well in school. He was an avid reader, and was interested in art and history. He was lucky to have access to the day’s cultured homes that had been opened up to gifted students from modest backgrounds. He started his higher education in 1816. He first studied law, then theology, and then history, before finalising his studies with art history. He received a cand.phil.

He then became a student at the Drawing School of the [[Royal Danish Academy of Art]] (''Det Kongelige Danske Kunstakademi'') where he learned perspective and anatomy, and had access to such artists as [[Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg]], [[Christian David Gebauer]] and Jens Peter Møller. He took part in establishing the Student Union.

With economic support from his father he left Copenhagen in September 1822 for a three-year student travel through [[Germany]], [[Austria]] and [[Italy]]

== Early career ==
He was given the opportunity to give lectures at the Art Academy during the winter 1826-1827 on [[Classical antiquity|antique]] paintings. He was one of the founding members of the Art Union (''Kunstforeningen'') in 1827, and he helped edit the first three volumes of "''Maanedsskrift for Litteratur''" ("Monthly Journal of Literature") in 1829. He resided in [[Hillerød]] a short time in 1828, during which time he became familiar with the large collection of artwork, mainly portraits, which were housed in [[Frederiksborg Castle]], now The Museum of National History with Denmark’s most important collection of [[portrait]]s and [[history painting]]s.

Høyen’s interest and enthusiasm for Danish art history was noticed by such influential men as Finance Deputy Jonas Collin, who has also participated in establishing the Art Union and was Secretary for the royal discretionary funds. These funds were used in 1829 to give Høyen a one-time grant to travel and study preservation-worthy art in the Danish provinces. Høyen traveled to [[Kronborg]], [[Lund]] ([[Lund Cathedral]]), [[Lübeck]], [[Holstein]] and some areas in [[Schleswig]] registering Denmark’s national treasures. The one-time grant was again given to Høyen in 1830, and in 1832 he received a two-year grant.

With Professor Niels Iversen Schow’s retirement in February 1829, he became Professor of History and Mythology at the Academy of Art, of which art history was a part of the curriculum. Soon art history became the focus of his teaching, and in 1831 focus was also placed on his compiling a history of Danish art.

He married Edele Birgitte Westengaard on 8 April 1832.

== Høyen’s profound reach on Danish art life ==
The Art Union sponsored competitions which set its mark on artists’ production. In its competition of 1834 one of the subjects was landscape painting featuring a Danish locale. Another that same year called for an interior or exterior view of a noteworthy or characteristic Danish building or public place. These competitions inspired [[Golden Age of Danish Painting|Golden Age of Painting]] artists [[Christen Købke]], [[Jørgen Roed]] and [[Constantin Hansen]] to paint such national-historical treasures as Danish church interiors and exteriors and views of Danish castles. The Art Union’s purchases of art work helped support artists in a time of dwindling royal economic support. Christen Købke’s first mature work "View of Århus Cathedral" (''Parti af Århus Domkirke''), painted in 1829, was purchased by the Art Union and is now in the collection of the [[Statens Museum for Kunst|Danish National Gallery (''Statens Museum for Kunst'')]].

His notes from his travels around Denmark are kept in the archives of the [[National Museum of Denmark]], and these have served as the basis for a national understanding of Denmark’s art history. His view and understanding of the nation’s treasures, have helped other’s understand the importance of works found throughout the country. He provided advice to artists, and was up-to-date on new developments.

In 1836 he was awarded a royal grant to travel to Paris on art historical research.

In 1839 he took over the position of Inspector of the Royal Painting Collection after Johan Conrad Spengler’s death, and then became Director of the same after the death of Christian Jurgensen Thomsen in 1865. The old collection, which was housed in the recently rebuilt [[Christiansborg Palace]], was resuscitated as Høyen removed lesser works, moved important works over from royal residences and castles throughout the country, and arranged the works for best effect. Additionally he was instrumental in the purchase of new works by the country’s prominent new artists.

In March 1844 he held his famous lecture "''Om Betingelserne for en skandinavisk Nationalkonsts Udvikling''" ("On the conditions for the development of a Scandinavian National Art"), which inspired many to search out a new national and Scandinavian understanding of culture and art. This inspired genre artists, such as [[Frederik Vermehren]], [[Julius Exner]] and [[Christen Dalsgaard]], as well as landscape artists such as [[Johan Thomas Lundbye]] og [[P.C. Skovgaard]].

He promoted a national art, and in 1847 he established the Nordic Art Society (''Selskabet for nordisk Kunst''). He gave lectures to a broader public, and on 26 June 1856 he was named as the first professor in [[History of art|art history]] at the [[University of Copenhagen]].

He helped establish the large painting collection at [[Frederiksborg Castle]], of which much was lost in the fire of 1859.

He was transitional director for the painting collection at [[Christiansborg Palace]].

Høyen also gave lectures as part of a series from the Danish Church Historical Society, which starting in 1852 held meetings around the country in prominent churches, first off the country’s cathedrals. His lectures were usually given on the subject of the church itself where the meetings were held, thus bringing into immediate focus the objects and artworks directly at hand. He was a member of the Society's leadership 1861-1870, and helped lead the rebuilding of [[Viborg Cathedral]] 1864-1876 before his death in 1870.

== Høyen’s legacy ==
Høyen played a vital role in Danish nationalistic painting’s development around the middle of the 19th century. He advised young artists against going abroad to study art; rather, he insisted, they would be better served to remain in Denmark, undergo training and become independent before allowing themselves to be exposed to foreign influences. Høyen encouraged them to paint native landscapes and Danish monuments to the illustrious past, as well as to paint the people and surroundings of humble agricultural origin where life had not changed so much under industrialization.

His influence on art and artists also had its opposition, such as painter and Academy professor [[Wilhelm Marstrand]] who wrote, "''Hvad menes der med, at kunsten skal være national? [...] ligesom den samme Sol skinner over hele Verden, saaledes er Kunsten ikke bundet''" ("What does it mean that art needs to be national? … In the same way that the same sun shines over the whole earth, so is art not bound (to a specific land).")

Art in Denmark was split into two groups during this period, those oriented towards the Nordic (known as ”the blondes”) and those internationally oriented towards Europe (known as ”the brunettes”). At the higher levels the Nordic trend won, but it meant isolation for Danish art. At the World Exhibition in Paris 1878, a critic wrote that "''nok er Danmark repræsenteret ved kunstnere, men ikke med kunst''" ("Denmark is well represented with artists, but not with art").

Only parts of his lectures have been preserved in writing, and only a single one has been published. His works were published as a final act by the Nordic Art Society 1871-1876.

His legacy as an art historian and critic was followed up by [[Julius Lange (art historian)|Julius Lange]], who quickly took over Høyen’s positions at the Academy and the University shortly after his death.

'''Norm Magnusson''' (born March 20, 1960) is a [[New York City|New York]]-based [[artist]] and [[political activist]] and founder, in 1991, of the art movement ''funism'', he began his career creating allegorical animal paintings with pointed social commentaries.  Eventually became more and more interested in political art and its potential for persuasion.
[[Image:The Imposition of Order Upon Nature.jpg|right|upright|thumb|The Imposition of Order Upon Nature, a painting by Norm Magnusson]]

This led him away from the canvas and into the public realm where he created short videos that ran on U.S. national television prior to 2004's U.S. [[general election]], viral emails and roadside historical markers with contemporary social content.  The markers are part of the artist's proposed "New York State Thruway Project".  Scheduled for 2012, it will place one marker in each of the 27 rest areas up and down the length of the NYS Thruway.

In the permanent collection of The [[Museum of Modern Art]] (Franklin Furnace Artist's Book Archive), The Springfield Museum of Art, The [[Anchorage Museum of History and Art]], The Pember Museum [http://www.pembermuseum.com/] and numerous other public and private collections, he has exhibited at these museums and for many years before it closed, at the infamous [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]]-born Bridgewater/Lustberg Gallery in NYC.  His sculptures of historical markers were shown as the [[Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum]]'s 2007 Main Street Sculpture Project, a show entitled "On this site stood."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aldrichart.org/exhibitions/past/magnusson.php aldrichart.org]&lt;/ref&gt;  In his review of that exhibition for The New York Times, Ben Gennochio called Magnusson "The Michael Moore of the highways" for the very liberal "unsparing and pitiless candor" of his art, which focuses "our attention on pressing contemporary social and political issues."
[[Image:RobtHass.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Rob't Hass, a sculpture by Norm Magnusson from his I-75 Project.]]

He has also created a body of nature-based work entitled "Decorating nature" in which he paints on rocks and leaves and trees and photographs them in their environment.
[[Image:Pixel Rock72.jpg|right|upright|thumb|One of Magnusson's "Decorating nature" series. [http://greennatureprints.com/], 2007]]

He was honored with a [[Pollock-Krasner Foundation]] grant in 1999 and a grant from the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council in 2008 for the realization of "On this site stood - lower Manhattan" a project to put 'historical' plaques with contemporary social content around lower Manhattan in summer 2009. (link below) In 2014, he received a NYSCA grant (through the Center for Sustainable Rural Communities) for a public art installation in Schoharie County, NY. In 2015, he was awarded a NYFA fellowship for sculpture.

'''Notes''' in [[perfume]]ry are descriptors of scents that can be sensed upon the application of a perfume. Notes are separated into three classes; '''top/head notes''', '''middle/heart notes''', and '''base notes'''; which denote groups of scents which can be sensed with respect to the time after the application of a perfume. These notes are created carefully with knowledge of the evaporation process and intended use of the perfume. The presence of one note may alter the perception of another—for instance, the presence of certain base or heart notes will alter the scent perceived when the top notes are strongest, and likewise the scent of base notes in the dry-down will often be altered depending on the smells of the heart notes.

The idea of ''notes'' is used primarily for the marketing of fine fragrances. The term is sometimes used by [[perfumer]]s to describe approximately scents or the perfumery process to laypeople.

|}

==Top notes==
Top notes are otherwise called the head notes.

Perceived immediately upon application of a perfume, top notes consist of small, light molecules that [[evaporation|evaporate]] quickly. They form a person's initial impression of a perfume and thus are very important in the selling of the product. The scents of this note class are usually described as "fresh", "assertive" or "sharp". The compounds that contribute to top notes are strong in scent, very volatile, and evaporate quickly. 

Although not as saliently perceived, the heart and base-notes contribute much to the scent in the top notes.

[[Citrus]] and [[ginger]] scents are common top notes.

==Middle notes==
They are also called the "heart notes".

The scent of a perfume that emerges just prior to when the top notes dissipate. The middle note compounds form the "heart" or main body of a perfume and emerge in the middle of the [[perfume]]'s dispersion process. They serve to mask the often unpleasant initial impression of base notes, which become more pleasant with time. Not surprisingly, the scent of middle note compounds is usually more mellow and "rounded". Scents from this note class appear anywhere from twenty minutes to one hour after the application of a perfume. 

[[Lavender]] and [[rose]] scents are typical middle notes.

==Base notes==
The scent of a perfume that appears close to the departure of the middle notes. The base and middle notes together are the main theme of a perfume. Base notes bring depth and solidity to a perfume. Compounds of this class are often the fixatives used to hold and boost the strength of the lighter top and middle notes. Consisting  of large, heavy molecules that evaporate slowly, compounds of this class of scents are typically rich and "deep" and are usually not perceived until 30 minutes after the application of the perfume or during the period of perfume dry-down. 

Some base notes can still be detectable in excess of twenty-four hours after application, particularly the animalic and [[musk]] notes.

'''Pre-Romanesque art and architecture''' is the period in European art from either the emergence of the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian kingdom]] in about AD 500 or from the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] in the late 8th century, to the beginning of the 11th century [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] period. The term is generally used in English only for [[architecture]] and [[monumental sculpture]], but here all the arts of the period are briefly described.

The primary theme during this period is the introduction and absorption of [[Classical art|classical]] Mediterranean and [[Early Christian art|Early Christian]] forms with Germanic ones, which fostered innovative new forms. This in turn led to the rise of Romanesque art in the 11th century. In the outline of [[Medieval art]] it was preceded by what is commonly called the [[Migration Period art]] of the "barbarian" peoples: [[Insular art|Hiberno-Saxon]] in the British Isles and predominantly [[Merovingian art and architecture|Merovingian]] on the Continent.

In most of western Europe, the [[Roman architecture|Roman]] architectural tradition survived the collapse of the empire. The Merovingians ([[Franks]]) continued to build large stone buildings like [[monastery]] [[church architecture|churches]] and palaces.

The unification of the Frankish kingdom under [[Clovis I]] (465–511) and his successors, corresponded with the need for the building of churches, and especially monastery churches, as these were now the power-houses of the Merovingian church. Two hundred monasteries existed south of the [[Loire]] when [[St Columbanus]], an Irish missionary, arrived in Europe in 585.  Only 100 years later, by the end of the 7th century, over 400 flourished in the Merovingian kingdom alone.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.all-art.org/history128-2.html&lt;/ref&gt; The building plans often continued the Roman basilica tradition.

Many Merovingian plans have been reconstructed from archaeology. The description in [[Bishop]] [[Gregory of Tours]]' ''History of the Franks'' of the basilica of Saint-Martin, built at [[Tours]] by [[Saint Perpetuus]] (bishop 460–490) at the beginning of the period and at the time on the edge of Frankish territory, gives cause to regret the disappearance of this building, one of the most beautiful Merovingian churches, which he says had 120 marble columns, towers at the East end, and several mosaics: "Saint-Martin displayed the vertical emphasis, and the combination of block-units forming a complex internal space and the correspondingly rich external silhouette, which were to be the hallmarks of the Romanesque".&lt;ref&gt;V.I. Atroshenko and Judith Collins, ''The Origins of the Romanesque'' (Lund Humphries, London) 1985, p. 48. {{ISBN|0-85331-487-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Merovingian dynasty were replaced by the [[Carolingian dynasty]] in AD 752, which led to [[Carolingian architecture]] from 780 to 900, and [[Ottonian architecture]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] from the mid-10th century until the mid-11th century. These successive Frankish dynasties were large contributors to [[Romanesque architecture]].

==Imperial styles==

===Carolingian art===
[[File:Ebbo Gospels St Mark.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Saint Mark, from the so-called [[Ebbo Gospels]], a piece of Carolingian illustration.]]
{{main|Carolingian art|Carolingian architecture}}

Carolingian art is the roughly 120-year period from about 780 to 900, during [[Charlemagne]]'s and his immediate heirs' rule, popularly known as the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]. Although brief, it was very influential; northern European kings promoted classical Mediterranean Roman art forms for the first time, while also creating innovative new forms such as naturalistic figure line drawings that would have lasting influence. Carolingian churches generally are [[basilica]]n, like the [[Early Christian art and architecture|Early Christian]] churches of Rome, and commonly incorporated [[westwork]]s, which is arguably the precedent for the western facades of later medieval cathedrals. An original [[westwork]] survives today at the [[Abbey of Corvey]], built in 885. After a rather chaotic interval following the Carolingian period, the new [[Ottonian dynasty]] revived Imperial art from about 950, building on and further developing Carolingian style in [[Ottonian art]].

===Ottonian art===
{{main|Ottonian art|Ottonian architecture}}
[[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] pre-Romanesque art during the 120-year period from 936 to 1056 is commonly called Ottonian art after the three [[Ottonian dynasty|Saxon]] emperors named Otto ([[Otto the Great|Otto I]], [[Otto II]], and [[Otto III]]) who ruled the [[Holy Roman Empire]] from 936 to 1001.

After the decline of the Carolingian Empire, the Holy Roman Empire was re-established under the Saxon (Ottonian) dynasty. From this emerged a renewed faith in the idea of Empire and a reformed Church, creating a period of heightened cultural and artistic fervour. It was in this atmosphere that masterpieces were created that fused the traditions from which Ottonian artists derived their inspiration: models of Late Antique, Carolingian, and Byzantine origin.

Much Ottonian art reflected the dynasty's desire to establish visually a link to the Christian rulers of Late Antiquity, such as [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]], Theoderich, and [[Justinian]] as well as to their Carolingian predecessors, particularly [[Charlemagne]].

Ottonian monasteries produced some of the most magnificent medieval illuminated manuscripts. They were a major art form of the time, and monasteries received direct sponsorship from emperors and bishops, having the best in equipment and talent available.

==Regional styles==

===Croatia===
{{Main|Croatian Pre-Romanesque art and architecture}}
[[File:Zadar2.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Pre-Romanesque Church of [[Donatus of Zadar|St Donatus]] in [[Zadar]], from the 9th century.]]

In the 7th century the [[Croats]], with other [[Slavs]] and [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], came from Northern Europe to the region where they live today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rastko.org.rs/arheologija/vsedov-slavs_2.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111211445/http://www.rastko.org.rs/arheologija/vsedov-slavs_2.html |archivedate=2013-11-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Croatian churches were built as royal sanctuaries, and the influence of Roman art was strongest in Dalmatia where urbanization was thickest. Gradually that influence was neglected and certain simplifications and alterations of inherited forms, and even creation of original buildings, appeared.

All of them (a dozen large ones and hundreds of small ones) were built with roughly cut stone bounded with a thick layer of malter on the outside. Large churches are longitudinal with one or three [[naves]] like [[Church of Holy Salvation, Cetina|Church of Holy Salvation]] ({{lang-hr|Crkva Sv. Spasa}}) at the spring of the river [[Cetina]], built in the 9th century, along with the [[Church of Saint Cross]] in [[Nin, Croatia|Nin]]. The largest and most complicated central based church from the 9th century is dedicated to [[Donatus of Zadar|Saint Donatus]] in [[Zadar]].

[[Altar]] rails and windows of those churches were highly decorated with transparent shallow string-like [[Ornament (architecture)|ornament]] that is called ''[[pleter]]'' (meaning to weed) because the strings were threaded and rethreaded through itself. Motifs of those reliefs were taken from Roman art; sometimes figures from the Bible appeared alongside this decoration, like ''relief in Holy Nedjeljica'' in Zadar, and then they were subdued by their pattern. This also happened to engravings in early Croatian script – [[Glagolitic]]. Soon, the Glagolitic writings were replaced with [[Latin]] on altar rails and [[architrave]]s of old-Croatian churches.

From the ''Crown Church of [[King Zvonimir]]'' (so called ''Hollow Church'' in [[Solin, Croatia|Solin]]) comes the altar board with ''figure of Croatian King'' on the throne with [[Carolingian]] crown, servant by his side and subject bowed to the king.

By joining the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] crown in the twelfth century, Croatia lost its full independence, but it did not lose its ties with the south and the west, and instead this ensured the beginning of a new era of [[Central Europe]]an cultural influence.

===England===
{{main|Anglo-Saxon art|Anglo-Saxon architecture}}
[[File:Meister des Benedictionale des Heiligen Aethelwold 001.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Benedictional of St. Æthelwold|Benedictional of Saint Aethelwold]], an [[List of illuminated Anglo-Saxon manuscripts|Anglo-Saxon illuminated manuscript]].]]

Anglo-Saxon art covers the period from the time of [[King Alfred]] (885), with the revival of English culture after the end of the Viking raids, to the early 12th century, when [[Romanesque art]] became the new movement. Prior to King Alfred there had been the [[Hiberno-Saxon]] culture, producing in [[Insular art]] the fusion of Anglo-Saxon and Celtic techniques and motifs, which had largely ceased in Ireland and Northern England with the [[Viking]] invasions. Anglo-Saxon art is mainly known today through [[illuminated manuscripts]] and metalwork.

===France===
After the demise of the Carolingian Empire, France split into a number of feuding provinces, so that lacking any organized Imperial patronage, French art of the 10th and 11th centuries became localised around the large monasteries, and lacked the sophistication of a court-directed style.

Multiple regional styles developed based on the chance availability of Carolingian manuscripts (as models to draw from), and the availability of itinerant artists. The monastery of [[Saint Bertin]] became an important centre under its abbot [[Odbert]] (986–1007) who created a new style based on Anglo-Saxon and Carolingian forms. The nearby abbey of [[Abbey of St. Vaast|Saint Vaast]] created a number of works. In southwestern France at the [[Abbey of Saint Martial, Limoges|monastery of Saint Martial]] in [[Limoges]] a number of manuscripts were produced around year 1000, as were produced in [[Albi]], [[Figeac]] and [[Saint-Sever-de-Rustan]] in [[Gascony]]. In Paris there developed a style at the abbey of [[Saint Germain-des-Prés]]. In [[Normandy]] a new style developed from 975 onward.

===Spain and Portugal===
{{main|Spanish Pre-Romanesque art and architecture}}
[[File:Capela de S. Frutuoso.JPG|thumb|right|[[Saint Frutuoso Chapel]] in [[Braga]], Portugal.]]
The first form of Pre-Romanesque in [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]] was the [[Visigothic art]], that brought the horse-shoe arches to the latter [[Moorish architecture]] and developed jewellery.

After the Moorish occupation, Pre-Romanesque art was first reduced to the [[Kingdom of Asturias]], the only Christian realm in the area at the time which reached high levels of artistic depuration. (See ''[[Asturian art]]''). The Christians who lived in Moorish territory, the [[Mozarab]]s, created their own architectural and illumination style, [[Mozarabic art]].

The best preserved Visigothic monument in [[Portugal]] is the [[Saint Frutuoso Chapel]] in [[Braga]].

===Italy===
{{see also|Lombard Romanesque}}
Southern Italy benefited from the presence and cross fertilization of the Byzantines, the Arabs, and the Normans, while the north was mostly controlled first by the Carolingians. The [[Italo-Norman|Normans]] in Sicily chose to commission Byzantine workshops to decorate their churches such as [[Monreale]] and [[Cefalù Cathedral]]s where full iconographic programmes of [[mosaic]]s have survived. Important frescos and illuminated manuscripts were produced.

'''Project Bandaloop''' brings to audiences performances of [[Aerial Dance|aerial dance]]. Under the direction of Amelia Rudolph, it creates a blend of dance, sport, ritual and environmental awareness. Inspired by the possibilities of climbing and rappelling, the choreography draws on aerial, vertical and horizontal movement to craft dances, many site-specific. The work explores the relationship between movement and gravity and stimulates viewers' awareness of their natural and built environments. The dancers, climbers and riggers have enjoyed bringing their form of aerial dance to new audiences and have performed for close to half a million people at major city landmarks and outdoor sites such as [[Yosemite Falls]], California, USA.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3735">A '''running gag''', or '''running joke''', is a [[literary device]] that takes the form of an amusing [[joke]] or a [[comedy|comical]] reference and appears repeatedly throughout a work of [[literature]] or other form of [[storytelling]]. Though they are similar, [[catchphrase]]s are not considered running gags.&lt;ref name="byron" /&gt;&lt;ref name="beaver" /&gt;

Running gags can begin with an instance of [[unintentional humor]] that is repeated in variations as the joke grows familiar and [[audience]]s anticipate reappearances of the gag. The humor in a running gag may derive entirely from how often it is repeated, however the underlying statement or situation will always require some form of [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/jocularity jocularity]. Therefore, a statement which is merely trivial in nature will not turn into a running gag simply by being repeated over and over again. A running gag may also derive its humor from the (in)appropriateness of the situation in which the gag occurs, or setting up the audience to expect another occurrence of the joke and then substituting something else (''bait and switch''). Running gags are found mostly in [[Situation comedy|television shows]],&lt;ref name="morganrussell" /&gt; but also appear in other places, such as [[video game]]s, [[film]]s, [[book]]s, and [[comic strip]]s.

A running gag can be verbal or visual and may "convey social values by echoing belligerent speakers with a barrage of caricatured threats."&lt;ref name="Brunvand719"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brunvand|first=Jan Harold|authorlink=Jan Harold Brunvand|title=American Folklore : An Encyclopedia Garland Reference Library of the Humanities ; Vol. 1551|publisher=New York Garland, 1998 |isbn=978-0-8153-3350-0 |page= 719; 812}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a character may present others with a proposition that is so ridiculous or outrageous it is likely to be self-mocking to the point where the original request has little or no chance of actually being carried out and results in a humorous effect.&lt;ref name="Brunvand719"/&gt; Occasionally, the characters themselves may be aware of the running gag and make humorous mention of it.

'''''Saint Martin de Porres''''' is an artwork by [[United States|American]] artist and [[Catholic priest]] [[Thomas McGlynn|Father Thomas McGlynn]]. This sculpture, one of McGlynn's most well known works and is found in the collection of [[Providence College]] in [[Rhode Island]], [[Old Lady of Perpetual Help Church (Washington, D.C.)|Our Lady of Perpetual Help Church]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], among others. It is a statue of [[Saint Martin de Porres]].&lt;ref name="SOS1993"&gt;{{cite web | author=Smithsonian | year=1993 | title=St. Martin Fountain, (sculpture). | work=Save Outdoor Sculpture | publisher=Smithsonian | url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=all&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;uri=full=3100001~!319554~!0#focus | accessdate= 12 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SOS1994"&gt;{{cite web | author=Smithsonian | year=1994 | title=Saint Martin de Porres, (sculpture). | work=Save Outdoor Sculpture | publisher=Smithsonian | url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=all&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;uri=full=3100001~!323793~!0#focus | accessdate= 12 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

The sculpture is a standing figure of Saint Martin de Porres wearing a [[cassock]] with a belt at the waist, he wears shoes. His head looks downwards, eyes somewhat closed, as if in deep thought or prayer. In his proper right hand he holds a [[Christian cross|cross]] to his chest and his proper left hand grips his leg with a broom under his arm.&lt;ref name="SOS1994"/&gt; Some of the works of this piece feature the Saint looking down at [[rat]]s that have gathered at his feet, often featuring 2-3 rats.&lt;ref name="MartinHallSOS"/&gt;

==Father Thomas McGlynn==

McGlynn was born May 23, 1906 to [[Frank McGlynn, Sr.|Frank McGlynn]] and Rose O'Beirne. On September 8, 1925 he received the habit of the [[Dominican Order]], taking the name Brother Matthew. At Dominic's Church in Washington, D.C., he was [[ordained]] a priest on May 20, 1932 by [[Michael Joseph Curley|Archbishop Michael Joseph Curley]]. Receiving his degree in sculpture in [[Rome, Italy]] in 1934 and returned to the United States to study at [[Cranbrook Educational Community]] studying under [[Carl Milles]]. After apostolic ministry and serving as faculty member at Providence College (1937–1938 and 1946), he went to [[Pietrasanta, Italy]] in 1956 commissioned to create a sculpture of [[Our Lady of Fatima]] and he remained in the country until his death on September 3, 1977.&lt;ref name="MartinHallSOS"&gt;{{cite web | author=Smithsonian | year=1993 | title=Saint Martin de Porres, (sculpture). | work=Save Outdoor Sculpture | publisher=Smithsonian | url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=all&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;uri=full=3100001~!319555~!0#focus | accessdate= 12 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McGlynn"&gt;{{cite web | author=Fr.

==Inspiration and Creation==

Growing up, McGlynn was unaware of racial issues during his youth, using discriminatory terms as part of everyday life to describe [[African Americans]]. Upon entering the priesthood McGlynn states that "My meeting with Martin de Porres changed all that."&lt;ref name="Homily"&gt;{{cite web | author=Fr. Pius Pietrzyk, O.P. | year=2010 | title=Fr.

==Locations==
Four versions of the sculpture exist, and the creation of this work is often credited with contributing to the [[canonization]] of the Saint in 1962.&lt;ref name="2009McGlynn"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=2009 | title=Selected Works of Thomas McGlynn | work=Thomas McGlynn | publisher=Providence College | url=http://www.domcentral.org/library/McGlynn/mcg09.htm | accessdate=12 January 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229191514/http://www.domcentral.org/library/McGlynn/mcg09.htm | archivedate=29 December 2010 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dominican House of Studies==

The original [[plaster]] version of the sculpture resided in the collection of the Dominican House of Studies in Washington, D.C. as of 1962.&lt;ref name="2009McGlynn"/&gt;

===Vatican===

The first, small version of the sculpture was created for use at the Vatican, completed in 1962.&lt;ref name="2009McGlynn"/&gt;

===Providence College===

Providence College has two copies of the sculpture, one in front of Martin Hall and a second at the McGlynn Sculpture Court, named after the sculptor. The Martin Hall sculpture, the fourth in the series, has no rats at the Saints feet, is made of [[bronze]] (H. 7&amp;nbsp;ft.) and was copyrighted in 1958 and dedicated on November 3, 1979.&lt;ref name="MartinHallSOS"/&gt; This version was originally designed for [[Saint Raymond's Cemetery, Bronx|Saint Raymond's Cemetery]] in the Bronx, New York City, and McGlynn decided to remove the rats believing that people would have an aversion to them being on a sculpture in a cemetery.&lt;ref name="2009McGlynn"/&gt; It was surveyed in 1993 by the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian's]] [[Save Outdoor Sculpture!]] program and was described as needing treatment.&lt;ref name="MartinHallSOS"/&gt;  

The second sculpture, at McGlynn Sculpture Court, features several small rats at the Saints feet. This is an earlier version of the above piece, made also of bronze (H. 48 in. × W. 1&amp;nbsp;ft. 3 in.), created in 1962, cast in 1963 and dedicated on October 2, 1993. The sculpture stands in a small fountain. as part of the Sculpture Court which was built after the [[Dominican Province of St. Joseph]] donated their McGlynn Archives &amp; Sculpture Collection to the College in 1980. This sculpture was described as well maintained by the Save Outdoor Sculpture! survey program.&lt;ref name="SOS1993"/&gt;

==Our Lady of Perpetual Help Church==

This version of the sculpture is made of [[wood]] (H. 12{{frac|1|2}} ft.) and does not feature the rats at his feet. It was dedicated on May 27, 1989 with the support of the St. Martin de Porres Guild and the founding pastor who wanted the church to be dedicated in the Saints honor. The funds for the work were provided by an endowment supplied by parishioner Mary A. Cooke, who hoped to have the statue erected inside the church school. The piece resides outside. The work was described as needing treatment in 1994 by the Save Outdoor Sculpture! survey program.&lt;ref name="SOS1994"/&gt;

===Roman Catholic Diocese of Raleigh===

On November 3, 2009, the parish of St. Joseph in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]] was presented a four-foot-tall version of the sculpture by Fr. Ambrose McAlister, Professor Emeritus of Art and Art History at Providence College, to celebrate the Feast of St. Martin de Porres.&lt;ref name="Homily"/&gt; This black marble casting was made from the 1930 version and was created in a Rhode Island-based foundry. It sits upon a table of white [[carrara marble]], which was crafted by parish member Bill Stephany. Fundraising for the work and installation was spearheaded by parish member Daisy Foster. Father McGlynn worked in Raleigh at St. Monica's from 1947 to 1954.&lt;ref name="Raleigh"&gt;{{cite web | author=St. Martin de Porres | year= | title=St. Martin de Porres | work= | publisher=St. Joseph's Catholic Church | url=http://stjosephsraleigh.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;id=92 | accessdate= 12 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===St. Martin de Porres Shrine &amp; Institute, Memphis, Tennessee===

The shrine chapel features a small version of the 1930 casting which shares the space with a [[relic]] of St. Martin as well as a stained-glass window and icons created by [[Pam Hassler]].&lt;ref name="Shrine"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=2010 | title=Shrine Artwork | work=The Shrine Chapel | publisher=St. Martin de Porres Shrine &amp; Institute | url=http://www.stmartinshrine.org/shrinechapel.html | accessdate=12 January 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100826074913/http://www.stmartinshrine.org/shrinechapel.html | archivedate=26 August 2010 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Sasaki was founded in 1953 by acclaimed landscape architect, [[Hideo Sasaki]] in [[Watertown, Massachusetts]], while he served as a professor and landscape architecture department chair at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/25/arts/hideo-sasaki-80-influential-landscape-architect-dies.html|title=Hideo Sasaki, 80, Influential Landscape Architect, Dies|last=Raver|first=Anne|date=2000-09-25|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-01-01|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Sasaki partnered with Peter Walker in 1957 the firm became Sasaki, Walker and Associates. In 1959, Walker opened up a new branch of the firm in San Francisco, and in 1964 the Watertown location was renamed Sasaki, Dawnson &amp; DeMay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Sasaki, Dawson &amp; DeMay {{!}} The Cultural Landscape Foundation| accessdate = 2018-01-06| url = https://tclf.org/pioneer/sasaki-dawson-demay}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Six principles of [[Chinese painting]]''' were established by [[Xie He (Chinese artist)|Xie He]] in "Six points to consider when judging a painting" (繪畫六法, [[Pinyin]]:Huìhuà Liùfǎ) from the preface to his book "The Record of the Classification of Old Painters" (古畫品錄; [[Pinyin]]: Gǔhuà Pǐnlù) written circa 550 and refers to "old" and "ancient" practices.  The six elements that define a painting are:

# "''Spirit Resonance''," or vitality, and seems to translate to the nervous energy transmitted from the artist into the work.  The overall energy of a work of art.  Xie He said that without Spirit Resonance, there was no need to look further.
# "''Bone Method''," or the way of using the brush.  This refers not only to texture and brush stroke, but to the close link between handwriting and personality.  In his day, the art of calligraphy was inseparable from painting.
# "''Correspondence to the Object''," or the depicting of form, which would include shape and line.
# "''Suitability to Type''," or the application of color, including layers, value and tone.
# "''Division and Planning''," or placing and arrangement, corresponding to composition, space and depth.
# "''Transmission by Copying''," or the copying of models, not only from life but also the works of antiquity.

These have been translated over the years by a succession of sinologists with very varying translations. "The problem lies, of course, in the terseness of the original Chinese, where each principle is stated in but four characters.... Each period of Chinese painting has its own special way of interpreting the six principles...their application is fluid, varying according to period and artist".&lt;ref&gt;Fritz van Briessen, ''The Way of the Brush: Painting Techniques of China and Japan''. Rutland, Vermont: Charles E. Tuttle Company, 1962, pp. 111-112.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rembrandt, bue squartato, 1655, 01.JPG|thumb|''Slaughtered Ox'', 1655. Oil on panel. 95.5 x 68.8 cm. Louvre, Paris]]

'''''Slaughtered Ox''''', also known as '''''Flayed Ox''''', '''''Side of Beef''''', or '''''Carcass of Beef''''', is a 1655 oil on [[beech]] panel [[still life]] painting by [[Rembrandt]]. It has been in the collection of the [[Louvre]] in Paris since 1857.  A similar painting is in [[Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum]], Glasgow, possibly by Rembrandt himself but probably by one of his pupils, perhaps [[Fabritius]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/the-carcase-of-an-ox-85827 The Carcase of an Ox], ArtUK&lt;/ref&gt;  Other similar paintings by Rembrandt or more likely his circle are held by museums in Budapest and Philadelphia.  

The work follows in a tradition of artworks showing butchery, for example [[Pieter Aertsen]]'s ''[[A Meat Stall with the Holy Family Giving Alms]]'' (1551) and [[Annibale Carracci]]'s ''[[Butcher's Shop]]'' (c. 1583), and perhaps more specifically [[Joachim Beuckelaer]]'s ''[[:File:Joachim Beuckelaer - Slaughtered Pig - WGA2122.jpg|Slaughtered Pig]]'' (1563).  Rembrandt made a drawing of a similar scene c. 1635.  Another pre-1655 painting of a slaughtered ox (the example in Edinburgh, now attributed to Rembrandt's circle but formerly to Rembrandt) was perhaps inspired by a lost earlier work by Rembrandt himself.  In northern Europe, November was traditionally the time for slaughtering livestock, before winter made feed difficult to find.  

The painting measures {{convert|95.5|x|68.8|cm}}, and is signed and dated "Rembrandt f. 1655".  It shows the butchered carcass of a bull or an ox, hanging in a wooden building, possibly a stable or lean-to shed.  The carcass is suspended by its two rear legs, which are tied by ropes to a wooden crossbeam.  The animal has been decapitated and flayed of skin and hair, the chest cavity has been stretched open and the internal organs removed, revealing a mass of flesh, fat, connective tissue, joints, bones, and ribs.  The carcass is carefully coloured, and given texture by [[impasto]].  In the background, a woman appears behind a half-open door, lifting the painting from [[still life]] into a [[genre painting]], a scene of everyday life.  It is sometimes considered a [[vanitas]] or [[memento mori]]; some commentators make references to the killing of the fatted calf in the biblical story of the [[Prodigal Son]], others directly to the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]].

The painting was possibly owned by Christoffel Hirschvogel in 1661. It was viewed by [[Joshua Reynolds]] in the collection of [[Pieter Locquet]] in Amsterdam in 1781, and later owned by [[Louis Viardot]], who sold it to the [[Louvre]] in 1857 for 5,000 francs.

The work's muscular depiction inspired [[Honoré Daumier]], [[Eugène Delacroix]], a series of works by  [[Chaim Soutine]], and [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]].  Most particularly, Bacon's ''[[Figure with Meat]]'' depicts [[Pope Innocent X]], as painted by [[Velazquez]], accompanied by ghostly echoes of the carcass from Rembrandt's painting.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1554">"Sous les pavés, la plage!"  ('''Under the paving stones, there is a beach!'''), is a slogan from the [[May 1968 events in France|May 1968 protest movement in France]]. It was coined by student activist Bernard Cousin,&lt;ref name=CousinObit&gt;[https://www.lanouvellerepublique.fr/indre-et-loire/commune/montresor/mai-68-le-createur-de-sous-les-paves-la-plage-est-mort Mai 68 : le créateur de "Sous les pavés, la plage" est mort], at ''[[La Nouvelle République du Centre-Ouest]]''; published April 15, 2014; retrieved June 13, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; in collaboration with [[public relations]] expert Bernard Fritsch.&lt;ref name=CNEWS&gt;[http://www.cnews.fr/france/2018-01-26/sous-les-paves-la-plage-il-est-interdit-dinterdire-les-slogans-phares-de-mai-68 «Sous les pavés la plage», «Il est interdit d’interdire»... les slogans phares de mai 68], at [[CNews]]; published January 26, 2018; retrieved June 13, 2018&lt;/reF&gt;

The phrase became a symbol of the events and popular movement during the spring of 1968, when the revolutionary students began to build barricades in the streets of major cities by tearing up [[Pavement (architecture)|street pavement stone]].  As the first barricades were raised, the students recognized that the stone setts were placed on top of sand.

The statement encapsulated the movement's views on urbanization and modern society in both a literal and metaphorical form.

[[File:Homage rock 1885.jpeg|thumb|right|Korean artwork shows scholar paying homage to a special stone -- painting with calligraphy by Hô Ryôn, 1885]]

'''''Suseok''''' (수석), also called '''viewing stones''', is the [[Korea]]n term for small naturally occurring or shaped [[rock (geology)|rocks]] which are traditionally valued.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koreanviewingstones.com/  Suseok at KoreanViewingStones.com]; retrieved 2013-2-7.&lt;/ref&gt;  Such stones are similar to [[Chinese scholar's rocks]] and Japanese [[suiseki]].&lt;ref name="brokaw73"&gt;Brokaw, Charles. (2011). [https://books.google.com/books?id=T51TNiU9460C&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=  ''The Temple Mount Code,'' p. 73].&lt;/ref&gt;

''Suseok'' can be any color. There are a wide variety of sizes. ''Suseok'' can weigh hundreds of pounds or less than one pound. The term also means stones which are placed in traditional Korean gardens.

==History==
''Suseok'' began as [[votive art]] over 3000 years ago, and began to be seen as worthy of scholars a thousand years ago. The art usually works on three scales: large installations of monumental shaped stones as ornamental gates; medium-sized shaped stones for landscape decoration within [[Korean gardens]]; and the smaller shaped stones for scholar's tables which is the most important.

Chinese scholar's rocks influenced the development of ''suseok'' in Korea.&lt;ref name="brokaw73"/&gt;

==Evaluation==
Early on important sites within landscape were marked with shaped stones, much as those distance markers on post roads. Burial sites were as well given permanent marking by large scale tumulus or mounds, often surrounded by anthropomorphic shaped stones much akin to that of [[Inuit]] or [[First Nations]]' memory markers. The shamanistic belief of nature being alive, and large scaled elements of nature having souls, has led to the continued use of massive sculpted stone in natural forms throughout Korean traditional entranceways as the firstgrowth cedarwood for gates is now rare.

As Confucian scholarship ascended into the golden age of the [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] dynasty, scholar rocks became an essential fixture of the writing tables of the [[yangban]] class of scholars, and a brilliant example of [[Confucian art]]. The repeated Japanese invasions of Korea, culminating with the 50 year occupation period from 1895 to 1945, saw great theft of Korean scholar stones as well as theft of larger pieces taken to Japan from [[Korean gardens]] or [[Seon garden]] and put into the [[Zen garden]] without reference to origins. Recreating a historical approach to Korean scholar stones is difficult, but it is being done.

Smaller ceramic versions of scholar's rocks have been seen cast in celadon, and used as brush-holders, and as well as water droppers for scholar's [[calligraphy]] - particularly in the shape of small mountains.

==Genres of Korean stone art==

* mountain view (horizontal and vertical)
* shaped jade mountains
* shaped rock crystal mountains
* abstract shape 
* overhanging shapes
* organic mineral shapes (calcites, pyrites)
* stalactite and stalagmite stelae
* shamanistic shape
* single stone buddhas
* multiple stone buddhas
* astrological year figures (dragon, snake, monkey etc.)
* tree and house shapes
* fossilized fish
* fossilized insects
* enhanced coloured stones

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4656">The '''Symphony in C''' is a work by Russian expatriate composer [[Igor Stravinsky]].

The Symphony was written between 1938 and 1940 on a commission from American philanthropist Mrs. Robert Woods Bliss.  It was a turbulent period of the composer's life, marked by illness and deaths in his immediate family.  In 1937, Stravinsky was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]], which had already forced his wife and two daughters to a sanatorium in Switzerland.  Stravinsky's daughter Ludmilla and wife Catherine died of their illnesses in November 1938 and March 1939, followed by Stravinsky's own quarantine and the death of his mother Anna in June 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Huscher,  [http://www.cso.org/main.taf?p=5,5,6,72 ''Program Notes: Symphony in C''] (Chicago: Chicago Symphony Orchestra, 2008); Igor Stravinsky, Liner notes for ''Stravinsky: Symphony in Three Movements; Symphony in C; Symphony of Psalms'' (CBS Records MK 42434, 1963/1988), pp. 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt; He also suffered a [[cerebral thrombosis]] while conducting the symphony at a 1956 concert in Berlin, Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Igor Stravinsky, liner notes for ''Stravinsky: Symphony in Three Movements; Symphony in C; Symphony of Psalms'' (CBS Records MK 42434, 1963/1988), pp. 4–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stravinsky was still mourning the deaths of his family members when World War II forced him to leave Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Huscher,  [http://www.cso.org/main.taf?p=5,5,6,72 ''Program Notes'': Symphony in C''] (Chicago: Chicago Symphony Orchestra, 2008); Michael Oliver, ''Igor Stravinsky''  (London: Phaidon Press Limited, 1995), p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;  He had written the symphony's first two movements in France and Switzerland.  Stravinsky wrote the third movement in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], and the fourth movement in [[Hollywood]], after his emigration to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Igor Stravinsky, Liner notes for ''Stravinsky: Symphony in Three Movements; Symphony in C; Symphony of Psalms'' (CBS Records MK 42434, 1963/1988), pp. 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt; The symphony was premiered by the [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]] under Stravinsky on November 7, 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Huscher, [http://www.cso.org/main.taf?p=5,5,6,72 ''Program Notes: Symphony in C''] (Chicago: Chicago Symphony Orchestra, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Symphony in C is representative of Stravinsky's [[neoclassicism (music)|neoclassical]] period, which had been launched by his ballet ''[[Pulcinella (ballet)|Pulcinella]]'' (1919–20), the opera ''[[Mavra]]'' (1921–22), and Octet for winds (1922–23).  The symphony has a traditional, four-movement structure and lasts approximately 30 minutes:
#''[[Tempo|Moderato]] [[musical terminology|alla breve]]'' (about 9 minutes)
#''[[Larghetto]] [[concertante]]'' (about 6 minutes)
#''[[Allegretto]]'' (about 5 minutes)
#''[[Largo (music)|Largo]]; Tempo [[musical terminology|giusto]], [[musical terminology|alla breve]]'' (about 7 minutes)

The Symphony in C is entirely abstract and seems a retreat into the 'pure music' styles of [[Bach]], [[Beethoven]], and [[Haydn]].  Stravinsky disclaimed any link between his personal experiences and the symphony's content.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Cross, ''[[Cambridge Companions to Music|The Cambridge Companion to Stravinsky]]'' (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2003), p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Program Notes"&gt;Huscher  [http://www.cso.org/main.taf?p=5,5,6,72 ''Program Notes].&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding its style, Stravinsky acknowledged a division of the symphony into halves.&lt;ref&gt;Stravinsky, liner notes, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The first two movements, composed in Europe, use more traditional rhythmic patterns and harmonizations.  The last two movements use frequent modulations of rhythm and are much more chromatic.&lt;ref name="Program Notes"/&gt;

Stravinsky's misfortunes apart, the Symphony in C had been infrequently performed in the composer's lifetime; Stravinsky noted that for several years he was the only person conducting the work.&lt;ref&gt;Stravinsky,  Liner notes.  p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was choreographed by Martha Graham in the late 1980s.  She named the result "Persephone" in ironic reference to another major work by Stravinsky. Although Graham choreographed all four movements, only the three-movement version was performed on stage.{{Clarify|date=October 2013}}&lt;!--Stravinsky composed only a four-movement version. Did Graham make a version in which one movement was left out and, if so, which one? And where is all of this information documented?--&gt;

'''''The Banquet of a Rich Glutton''''' is a painting completed by the Italian [[Baroque art|Baroque]] painter [[Mattia Preti]] and housed in the Pinacoteca of the Gallerie Nazionali di Arte Antica ([[Palazzo Barberini]]) in Rome, Italy.

==Description==
The painting was likely commissioned by Antonio Caputo, a Neapolitan merchant from Preti during his stay in Naples. It was likely a companion piece to the ''Banquet of Absalom'' now hanging in the [[Museo di Capodimonte]].

The subject of this painting derives from the parable of the [[rich man and Lazarus]] found in the gospel of Luke 16: 19-31. The name ''Epulone'' has been attached in Italy to the rich man, but also generically refers to a ''feaster'' (with pejorative gluttonous suggestion). The etymology of the word comes from a banquet sometime prepared in honor of the gods. The painting depicts a rich man after completion of his meal, with empty plates, surrounded by servants, while in the background, is the beggar Lazarus.

The painting was purchased in 1895 from a [[Monte di Pietà]], where such a painting would have resonated as both a ''[[memento mori]]'' and counsel towards charity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://galleriabarberini.beniculturali.it/index.php?it/181/preti-la-cena-del-ricco-epulone Entry at Gallerie Nazionali di Arte Antica].&lt;/ref&gt; The painting would have been thematically antithetical to the still life works depicting a cornucopia of a contemporary rich man's kitchen.

'''''The Brahmin and the Mongoose''''' (or '''''The Brahmin's Wife and the Mongoose''''') is a folktale from [[India]], and "one of the world's most travelled tales".&lt;ref name=b494&gt;Blackburn, p. 494&lt;/ref&gt; It describes the rash killing of a loyal animal, and thus warns against hasty action. The story underlies certain legends in the West, such as that of Llywelyn and his dog [[Gelert]] in Wales,&lt;ref name=b494/&gt; or that of [[Saint Guinefort]] in France.&lt;ref name=greenwood/&gt;&lt;ref name=b496/&gt; It is classified as [[Aarne-Thompson]] type 178A.&lt;ref&gt;D. L. Ashliman, ''[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0178a.html Llewellyn and His Dog Gellert and other folktales of Aarne-Thompson type 178A]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==The story==
[[File:8th century Panchatantra legends panels at Virupaksha Shaivism temple, Pattadakal Hindu monuments Karnataka 1.jpg|thumb|The woman and the mongoose ''Panchatantra'' fable is engraved in many historic Hindu temples such as at the 8th-century Virupaksha temple at [[Pattadakal]] (the middle panel).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Blackburn | first=Stuart | title=The Brahmin and the Mongoose: The Narrative Context of a Well-Travelled Tale | journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies | publisher=Cambridge University Press | volume=59 | issue=03 | year=1996 | doi=10.1017/s0041977x00030615 | pages=494-506}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The original version from the [[Panchatantra]] in [[Sanskrit]] goes as follows (translation from {{Harvnb|Ryder|1925}}):
{{quote|
The Loyal Mongoose{{efn|The source uses the spelling "mungoose" throughout; the spelling has been here modernized to "mongoose" for consistency with the rest of the article.}}

There was once a Brahman named Godly [orig. ''Devasharma''] in a certain town. His wife mothered a single son and a mongoose. And as she loved little ones, she cared for the mongoose also like a son, giving him milk from her breast, and salves, and baths, and so on. But she did not trust him, for she thought: “A mongoose is a nasty kind of creature. He might hurt my boy.” [...]

One day she tucked her son in bed, took a waterjar, and said to her husband: “Now, Professor, I am going for water. You must protect the boy from the mongoose.” But when she was gone, the Brahman went off somewhere himself to beg food, leaving the house empty.

While he was gone, a black snake issued from his hole and, as fate would have it, crawled toward the baby’s cradle. But the mongoose, feeling him to be a natural enemy, and fearing for the life of his baby brother, fell upon the vicious serpent halfway, joined battle with him, tore him to bits, and tossed the pieces far and wide. Then, delighted with his own heroism, he ran, blood trickling from his mouth, to meet the mother; for he wished to show what he had done.

But when the mother saw him coming, saw his bloody mouth and his excitement, she feared that the villain must have eaten her baby boy, and without thinking twice, she angrily dropped the water-jar upon him, which killed him the moment that it struck. There she left him without a second thought, and hurried home, where she found the baby safe and sound, and near the cradle a great black snake, torn to bits. Then, overwhelmed with sorrow because she had thoughtlessly killed her benefactor, her son, she beat her head and breast.

At this moment the Brahman came home with a dish of rice gruel which he had got from someone in his begging tour, and saw his wife bitterly lamenting her son, the mongoose. “Greedy! Greedy!” she cried. “Because you did not do as I told you, you must now taste the bitterness of a son’s death, the fruit of the tree of your own wickedness. Yes, this is what happens to those blinded by greed....”

In Western variants of the story, other animals take the place of the mongoose, most often a dog. It is also found in other versions as a [[weasel]], cat (in Persia), bear, or lion, and the snake is sometimes replaced with a wolf (in Wales). The essence of the story, however, remains the same. Similarly, variants of the story sometimes have the man, instead of his wife, killing the loyal animal.&lt;ref name=b498&gt;Blackburn, p. 498&lt;/ref&gt;

The story is sometimes placed within a frame story, where a saviour stands mistakenly accused and narrates this story, thereby preventing his own death.&lt;ref name=b&gt;Blackburn&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and travel==
The story was first studied in 1859 by [[Theodor Benfey]], the pioneer of comparative literature, when he compared the versions in India, the Middle East and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Benfey, Theodor S. 1859. Pantschatantra.2 vols. Leipzig: F. W. Brockhaus; Benfey, Theodor S. 1862. 'Ueber die alte deutsche Uebersetzung des Kalilah und Dimnah', Orient und Occident, 1: 138-187.&lt;/ref&gt;In 1884, W. A. Clouston showed how it had reached Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Clouston, W. A. 1884. [https://books.google.com/books?id=UnEAAAAAMAAJ The Book of Sindibad]. Glasgow: privately printed.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gelert.jpg|thumb|250px|''[[Gelert]]'' by [[Charles Burton Barber]] (1845–1894)]] 
[[Murray B. Emeneau]] considers the migration of this story, through its steps from India to Wales, as "one of the best authenticated cases of such diffusions of folk-tales".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi =  10.2307/985117| jstor = 985117 | pages = 503–513 | title = A Classical Indian Folk-Tale as a Reported Modern Event: the Brahman and the Mongoose | journal = Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society | volume = 83 | issue = 3 | publisher = American Philosophical Society | year = 1940| author1 = Emeneau | first1 = M. B.}}, p.507&lt;/ref&gt;  It is classified as [[Aarne-Thompson]] type 178A.&lt;ref&gt;D. L. Ashliman, ''[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0178a.html Llewellyn and His Dog Gellert and other folktales of Aarne-Thompson type 178A]''&lt;/ref&gt; 

The story occurs in all versions of the [[Panchatantra]], as well as the later Sanskrit works [[Hitopadesha]]&lt;ref name=hitopadesha&gt;
{{citation | year=2007 | title = "Friendly advice" by Nārāyaṇa and "King Vikrama's adventures" | author1=Nārāyaṇa | author2=Judit Törzsök (transl.) | publisher=NYU Press and [[Clay Sanskrit Library]] | isbn=978-0-8147-8305-4 | pages=513–515 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KdV9dMQci9sC&amp;pg=PA513}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Kathasaritsagara]].
It also occurs in most of the languages of India (and South Asia) where it is extremely familiar.
For instance, in the [[South India]]n state of [[Karnataka]], the story occurs as a proverb in inscriptions,&lt;ref name=b496&gt;Blackburn, p. 496&lt;/ref&gt; as a sculpture in a temple,&lt;ref&gt;
Mallikarjuna Temple at [[Pattadakal]], Karnataka, eighth century. See:
* C. S. Patil (1995), ''Panchatantra in Karnataka sculptures'', Mysore: Directorate of Archaeology and Museums.
&lt;/ref&gt; in narratives of travelling storytellers and singers,&lt;ref&gt;
Blackburn p.505 and 499. Found as ''The Sati of Sulochana'' in a collection of bard-stories:
* Kyathanahalli Rāmaṇṇa (1972), ''Gondalingara Kathegalu''. Mysore: Institute for Kannada Studies.
&lt;/ref&gt; and in film.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0MHirNAR9o Nodiddu sullagabahudu (video)] ("Things are not always what they seem"), from ''Rama Lakshmana'' (1980). Note that here, too, the story is framed within another story of an unjustly accused animal (a pet tiger).&lt;/ref&gt;
Similarly, the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] epic ''[[Silappatikaram]]'' recalls the story simply by its name.

Like the rest of the Panchatantra, in its westward migration it travelled from Sanskrit to Arabic (as ''Kalila wa Dimna''), Persian, [[Hebrew]], Greek, Latin, Old French, and eventually into all the major languages of Europe (as ''The Fables of Pilpay'' or ''Bidpai''), ranging from Russian to [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] to English. 
In its eastward migration, it appears in Chinese (ten versions, including in a redaction of the Vinaya Pitaka), and over a wide region from Mongolia to Malaysia.
It is also the only story found in all recensions of the Panchatantra, all versions of the 'Book of Sindibad' (not [[Sindbad]]),
and all versions of '[[Seven Wise Masters|The Seven Sages of Rome]]'.&lt;ref name=b495&gt;Blackburn, p. 495&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also found in Mexico and the United States. Blackburn observes that the fable is not a dead tradition and is still current, as a Belgian newspaper reported it as an anecdote about a man who left his son and dog in a shopping trolley in his car.&lt;ref name=b495/&gt;

The motif also occurs, with a happy ending, in the Disney film ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'' (1955).&lt;ref name=greenwood/&gt;

==Reception/influence==
The story is often used in culture as an [[exemplum]] cautioning against hasty action. In addition, it also serves as shorthand for sin, regret and grief.&lt;ref name=b/&gt;

In Welsh it became the story of the nobleman Llywelyn who kills his loyal dog, [[Gelert]]. It was later interpreted as a legend about a true event, and small shrines to the dog exist in Wales (such as in the village of [[Beddgelert]], "Gelert's grave"). In France a similar metamorphosis took larger proportions, and the story became the cult of [[Saint Guinefort]] (a dog), which was popular until the 1930s.&lt;ref name=greenwood&gt;{{citation | author=Stephen Belcher | contribution=Panchatantra | title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Folktales and Fairy Tales | editor=Donald Haase | year=2008 | volume=2 | pages=723–725 | isbn=978-0-313-33441-2 | quote=…is a saint's legend behind a pilgrimage site in France.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, p. 496. {{quote|When the dog replaced the mongoose, the tale was commonly interpreted as a legend (that is as a true event), and the loyal animal's undeserving death was commemorated by small shrines to the dog not only in Wales but also in north India […] On a larger scale, this tale inspired the cult of St. Guinefort in France…}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blackburn points out that although in the many literary versions it is the man who kills the mongoose, in most ''oral'' versions (and even the literary version quoted above), it is the woman who does so. Further, ''both'' literary and oral versions place the woman at the centre of the story, emphasizing her maternal feelings toward the animal, her mixture of love and fear, and her grief at its death. Thus he asserts that "the tale is a drama enacted between a mother and her son" and proposes some interpretations.&lt;ref name=b501&gt;Blackburn, p. 501&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trina Robbins''' (born Trina Perlson, 1938)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Riesman |first1=Abraham |title=The Story of Trina Robbins, the Controversial Feminist Who Revolutionized Comic Books |url=http://www.vulture.com/2018/04/meet-trina-robbins-the-feminist-who-revolutionized-comics.html |work=Vulture |date=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[People of the United States|American]] cartoonist. She was an early and influential participant in the [[underground comix]] movement, and one of the first few female artists in that movement. Both as a cartoonist and historian, Robbins has long been involved in creating outlets for and promoting female comics artists. In the 1980s, Robbins became the first woman to draw ''[[Wonder Woman]]'' comics. She is a member of the [[Will Eisner Hall of Fame]].

==Career==

=== Early work ===
Robbins was an active member of [[science fiction fandom]] in the 1950s and 1960s. Her illustrations appeared in [[science fiction fanzines]] like the [[Hugo Award|Hugo]]-[[Hugo Award for Best Fanzine|nominated]] [[Habakkuk (fanzine)|''Habakkuk'']].

=== Comics ===
Robbins' first comics were printed in the ''[[East Village Other]]''; she also contributed to the spin-off underground comic ''[[Gothic Blimp Works]]''.

In 1969, Robbins designed the costume for the [[Warren Publishing]] character [[Vampirella]], for artist [[Frank Frazetta]] in ''Vampirella'' #1 (Sept. 1969).&lt;ref name=arndt&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enjolrasworld.com/Richard%20Arndt/The%20Warren%20Magazines%20Index%20Only.htm | first=Richard J.|last=Arndt|title=The Warren Magazines| publisher=EnjolrasWorld.com | date = September 22, 2008| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710194128/http://enjolrasworld.com/Richard%20Arndt/The%20Warren%20Magazines%20Index%20Only.htm| archivedate=July 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She left New York for [[San Francisco]] in 1970, where she worked at the feminist [[underground newspaper]] ''It Ain't Me, Babe''. That same year she, along with fellow female artist [[Barbara "Willy" Mendes]], established the first all-woman comic book, the [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] [[It Ain't Me, Babe (comic)|''It Ain't Me, Babe Comix'']].&lt;ref name="Krensky74"&gt;Krensky, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kaplan79&gt;Kaplan, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; From this period on, Robbins became increasingly involved in creating outlets for and promoting female comics artists, through projects such as the [[comics anthology]] ''[[Wimmen's Comix]]'', with which she was involved for twenty years. ''Wimmen's Comix'' #1 featured Robbins' "Sandy Comes Out", the first-ever comic strip featuring an "out" [[lesbian]].&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Arie. ''Masters of the Comic Book Universe Revealed!''. (Chicago Review Press, 2006) {{ISBN|1-55652-633-4}}, p.86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Robin (July 31, 1994). "Where Women Rule: The World of Lesbian Cartoons". ''The Harvard Gay &amp; Lesbian Review'' 1 (3): 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robbins became increasingly outspoken in her beliefs, criticizing underground comix artist [[Robert Crumb]] for the perceived misogyny of many of his comics. She said, "It's weird to me how willing people are to overlook the hideous darkness in Crumb's work&amp;nbsp;... What the hell is funny about rape and murder?"&lt;ref name="Sabin-92"&gt;Sabin, Roger (1996). "Going underground". ''Comics, Comix &amp; Graphic Novels: A History Of Comic Art''. London, United Kingdom: Phaidon Press. pp. 92. {{ISBN|0-7148-3008-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1980s Robbins created adaptations of [[Sax Rohmer]]'s ''Dope'' and [[Tanith Lee]]'s ''[[The Silver Metal Lover]]''. In the mid-1980s she wrote and drew ''Misty'' for the [[Marvel Comics]] children's imprint [[Star Comics]]. The short-lived series was a reinterpretation of the long-standing character [[Millie the Model]], now an adult running her own modeling agency and minding her niece Misty.

Robbins' official involvement with [[Wonder Woman]], a character she had long admired, began in 1986. At the conclusion of the first volume of the series (in conjunction with the series ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''), [[DC Comics]] published a four-issue [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] titled ''The Legend of Wonder Woman'', written by [[Kurt Busiek]] and drawn by Robbins. Robbins was the first woman to draw Wonder Woman comics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ultra Nerdy |url=http://blogs.vancouversun.com/2014/11/05/trina-robbins-wonder-woman-comics/ |title=Q &amp; A with Trina Robbins – first woman to draw Wonder Woman comics (with video) &amp;#124; Vancouver Sun |publisher=Blogs.vancouversun.com |date=2014-11-05 |accessdate=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series paid homage to the character's [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] roots. She also appeared as herself in ''Wonder Woman Annual 2'' (1989). In the mid-1990s, Robbins criticized artist [[Mike Deodato]]'s "[[bad girl art]]" portrayal of Wonder Woman, calling Deodato's version of the character a "barely clothed hypersexual [[pin-up girl|pinup]]."&lt;ref&gt;Trina Robbins, ''The Great Women Superheroes'' (Kitchen Sink Press, 1996) {{ISBN|0-87816-481-2}}, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1990s, Robbins collaborated with [[Colleen Doran]] on the [[DC Comics]] graphic novel ''Wonder Woman: The Once and Future Story'', on the subject of [[spousal abuse]].

Robbins has been writing the comic book adventures of [[Honey West]], notable as being one of popular fiction's first female [[private detective]]s.

=== Writing and activism ===
In addition to her comics work, Robbins is an author of nonfiction books on the history of women in cartooning.

Her first book, co-written with [[Catherine Yronwode]], was ''Women and the Comics,'' a history of female comic-strip and comic-book creators. As one of the first books ever published on this subject, it was covered in the mainstream press, in addition to the fan press.&lt;ref&gt;"Women in the Comics: Assertive and Independent Women Make a Comeback" [[Miami Herald]] (newspaper), December 1, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Comic Books Are For Adults Too" by William Singleton, Scripps Howard News Service, Chronicle-Telegram (newspaper), January 7, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Funny How Things Change" ''Daily Herald'' (newspaper), December 28, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent Robbins volumes on women in the comics industry include ''A Century of Women Cartoonists'' (Kitchen Sink, 1993), ''The Great Women Superheroes'' (Kitchen Sink, 1997), ''From Girls to Grrrlz: A History of Women’s Comics from Teens to Zines'' (Chronicle, 1999), and ''The Great Women Cartoonists'' (Watson-Guptill, 2001). Her most recent work, ''Pretty In Ink'', published by Fantagraphics, covers the history of North American women in comics from Rose O'Neill's 1896 strip ''The Old Subscriber Calls'' to present.&lt;ref&gt;added Pretty in Ink reference&lt;/ref&gt;

Robbins was a co-founder of [[Friends of Lulu]],&lt;ref&gt;Wilonsky, Robert (May 18, 2000). "Fatal femmes: Why do women in comics become Women in Refrigerators?". ''Dallas Observer''.&lt;/ref&gt; a nonprofit formed in 1994 to promote readership of comic books by women and the participation of women in the comic book industry.

Robbins is featured in the feminist history film ''[[She's Beautiful When She's Angry]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shesbeautifulwhenshesangry.com/women/|title=The Women|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shesbeautifulwhenshesangry.com/the-film/ |title=The Film — She's Beautiful When She's Angry |publisher=Shesbeautifulwhenshesangry.com |date= |accessdate=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Robbins was intimately involved in the 1960s rock scene, where she was close friends with [[Jim Morrison]] and [[The Byrds]]. She is the first of the three "Ladies of the Canyon" in [[Joni Mitchell]]'s classic song from the album of the [[Ladies of the Canyon (album)|same name]].&lt;ref name=Weller293&gt;Weller, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1960s she ran an East Village clothing boutique called "Broccoli" and made clothes for [[Mama Cass]], [[Donovan]], [[David Crosby]] and others.&lt;ref name="hollywoodhangover1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodhangover.com/htm_files/part_eight.htm |title=Fresh Photos - Part Eight |publisher=Hollywoodhangover.com |date= |accessdate=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has written a memoir entitled ''Last Girl Standing'', scheduled for release in 2017 from [[Fantagraphics]].
