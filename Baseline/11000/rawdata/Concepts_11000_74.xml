      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10042">[[File:1percentrule.svg|thumb|Pie chart showing the proportion of lurkers, contributors and creators under the 90–9–1 principle]]

In [[Internet culture]], the '''1% rule''' is a [[rule of thumb]] pertaining to participation in an internet community, stating that only 1% of the users of a website actively create new content, while the other 99% of the participants only [[Lurker|lurk]]. Variants include the ''1–9–90 rule'' (sometimes ''90–9–1 principle'' or the ''89:10:1 ratio''),&lt;ref name="arthur"/&gt; which states that in a collaborative website such as a [[wiki]], 90% of the participants of a community only view content, 9% of the participants edit content, and 1% of the participants actively create new content.

Similar rules are known in [[information science]], such as the 80/20 rule known as the [[Pareto principle]], that 20 percent of a group will produce 80 percent of the activity, however the activity may be defined.

==Definition==
The 1% rule states that the number of people who create content on the Internet represents approximately 1% of the people who view that content. For example, for every person who posts on a forum, generally about 99 other people view that forum but do not post. The term was coined by authors and bloggers Ben McConnell and Jackie Huba,&lt;ref name="1% rule"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.churchofthecustomer.com/blog/2006/05/charting_wiki_p.html|title=The 1% Rule: Charting citizen participation|last1=McConnell|first1=Ben|first2=Jackie |last2=Huba|date=May 3, 2006|work=Church of the Customer Blog|accessdate=2010-07-10|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100511081141/http://www.churchofthecustomer.com/blog/2006/05/charting_wiki_p.html|archivedate= 11 May 2010 &lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; although earlier references to the same concept&lt;ref name="100-10-1"/&gt; did not use this name.

The terms ''lurk'' and ''lurking'', in reference to online activity, are used to refer to online observation without engaging others in the community, and were first used by veteran print journalist, P. Tomi Austin, circa 1990, when her presence was noticed by other users in chat rooms, who queried her reasons for not engaging in chat.{{cn|date=September 2017}} There were repeated inquiries about her identity and her refusal to engage in chat. The etiquette was, apparently, to greet other users upon entry into the chat rooms/sites. At the time, (then in her 30s, surfing among users averaging in their teens and 20s) she was only identified as "Bilbo", she explained that she was a mature, but computer-literate, user and novice to chat, and preferred to ''lurk'', or was ''lurking'' to familiarize herself with the chat culture, etiquette, and the sites to which she had logged on. In some instances, she needed to explain her coinage of the term "lurking", as the term was new to the online community, but others quickly understood her meaning. To her knowledge, the terms had not been used prior to that period, and there appears to be no earlier dated reference to the coinage.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

A 2005 study of radical Jihadist forums found 87% of users had never posted on the forums, 13% had posted at least once, 5% had posted 50 or more times, and only 1% had posted 500 or more times.&lt;ref name="1% doctrine"&gt;Awan, A. N. (2007b) [http://ecs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/10/3/389 'Virtual Jihadist media: Function, legitimacy, and radicalising efficacy'], ''European Journal of Cultural Studies'', vol. 10(3), pp. 389–408.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A 2014 peer-reviewed paper entitled "The 1% Rule in Four Digital Health Social Networks: An Observational Study" empirically examined the 1% rule in health oriented online forums. The paper concluded that the 1% rule was consistent across the four support groups, with a handful of "Superusers" generating the vast majority of content. &lt;ref&gt;van Mierlo T. [https://www.jmir.org/2014/2/e33/ The 1% Rule in Four Digital Health Social Networks: An Observational Study.] ''J Med Internet Res'' 2014;16(2):e33.&lt;/ref&gt; A study later that year, from a separate group of researchers, replicated the 2014 van Mierlo study in an online forum for depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carron-Arthur|first1=B|last2=Cunningham|first2=JA|last3=Griffiths|first3=KM|title=Describing the distribution of engagement in an Internet support group by post frequency: A comparison of the 90-9-1 Principle and Zipf's Law|journal=Internet Interventions|date=2014|volume=1|issue=4|pages=165-168|url=http://www.invent-journal.com/article/S2214-7829(14)00027-X/abstract?cc=y=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results indicated that the distribution frequency of the 1% rule fit followed [[Zipf's Law]], which is a specific type of a [[power law]].  

The "90–9–1" version of this rule states that for websites where users can both create and edit content, 1% of people create content, 9% edit or modify that content, and 90% view the content without contributing.

The actual percentage is likely to vary depending upon the subject matter.  For example, if a forum requires content submissions as a condition of entry, the percentage of people who participate will probably be significantly higher than one percent, but the content producers will still be a minority of users. This is validated in a study conducted by Michael Wu, who uses economics techniques to analyze the participation inequality across hundreds of communities segmented by industry, audience type, and community focus.&lt;ref name="The Economics of 90–9–1"/&gt;

The 1% rule is often misunderstood to apply to the Internet in general, but it applies more specifically to any given Internet community. It is for this reason that one can see evidence for the 1% principle on many websites, but aggregated together one can see a different distribution. This latter distribution is still unknown and likely to shift, but various researchers and pundits have speculated on how to characterize the sum total of participation. Research in late 2012 suggested that only 23% of the population (rather than 90 percent) could properly be classified as lurkers, while 17% of the population could be classified as intense contributors of content.&lt;ref name="Participant choice"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2012/05/bbc_online_briefing_spring_201_1.html|title=BBC Online Briefing Spring 2012: The Participation Choice}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several years prior, results were reported on a sample of students from Chicago where 60 percent of the sample created content in some form.&lt;ref name="Participation divide"&gt;Hargittai, E. and Walejko, G. (2008) [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13691180801946150 'The Participation Divide: Content creation and sharing in the digital age'], ''Information, Communication and Society'', vol. 11(2), pp. 389–408.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participation inequality==
A similar concept was introduced by Will Hill of [[AT&amp;T Laboratories]]&lt;ref name="Edit wear and read wear"/&gt; and later cited by [[Jakob Nielsen (usability consultant)|Jakob Nielsen]]; this was the earliest known reference to the term "[[participation inequality]]" in an online context.&lt;ref name="participation_inequality"/&gt; The term regained public attention in 2006 when it was used in a strictly quantitative context within a blog entry on the topic of marketing.&lt;ref name="1% rule"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2675">'''''32 Postkarten''''' is a literature and art project that has been devised and coordinated by [[Torkel S. Wächter]]. It retells the story of a German-Jewish family from the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] to the Japanese attack on [[Pearl Harbor]]. The authentic postcards, with English and German translations, and commentaries, are being published on the Internet from March 2010 in ‘simulated real time’ - on the date they were written, but 70 years later - at www.32postkarten.com.&lt;ref name=Historical&gt;{{cite journal|title=32 Postkarten|work=[[The Historical Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It all started ten years ago, when Mr Wächter discovered a number of packing cases in an attic in Stockholm. They contained letters, diaries, old exercise books, newspaper cuttings and a cigar box with black-and-white photographs inside.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mynewsdesk.com/il/view/pressrelease/32-rediscovered-postcards-from-the-second-world-war-389542&lt;/ref&gt; And above all, in a plastic bag, the 32 postcards written by Mr Wächter's grandparents in Hamburg and posted to his father in Sweden just before the Holocaust. 

Given its postcard-length format, the  material is well suited for the teaching of secondary and tertiary level history and German in schools. The material will remain available online well after the publication of the last postcard in December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.swedishbookreview.com/news.php#i20102&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014 '''32 Postkarten - Post aus Nazi-Deutschland''',  {{ISBN|9783862822928}}, will be published by ACABUS-Verlag. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acabus-verlag.de/vorschau_45/2014_61/32-postkarten-post-aus-nazi-deutschland_9783862822928.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301162852/http://www.acabus-verlag.de/vorschau_45/2014_61/32-postkarten-post-aus-nazi-deutschland_9783862822928.htm |archivedate=1 March 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/32postkarten&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amsterdam Walk''' is a retail and entertainment complex in the [[Virginia Highland]] neighborhood of [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. It is housed in former warehouse space located at the far west end of Amsterdam Ave. between Monroe Ave. and the [[BeltLine]] ([[Piedmont Park]] is located immediately behind the BeltLine).  There is a large gym, bars, nightclubs, and specialty retailers selling furniture, jewelry, clothing, floral design, antiques, baked goods, cooking accessories, rugs and more.

==History==
Amsterdam Walk consists of buildings that originally housed the Campbell Coal Company warehouses. However, the Campbell complex was actually larger than today's Amsterdam Walk. It also included an area to the north which is now empty land. That area used to house The Cove nightclub, but later the buildings were razed and it is now scheduled to be developed as the Piedmont Gardens section of Piedmont Park. 

The Campbell warehouse later became the Thoben Elrod appliance depot, which caught on fire in 1964 with losses of $646,000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gGc-G4JRHMcC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;lpg=PA106 Atlanta, Ga Fire By Turner Publishing Company, p.106]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1990s the part that is now Amsterdam Walk opened as the Midtown Outlets, and was given its current name in the early 2000s.

[[Information]] is that which reduces uncertainty, wholly or in part.
Similarly, anti-information is that which increases uncertainty.
It is negative information.

[[Noise_(signal_processing)|Noise]] on a [[Noisy-channel coding theorem|noisy communication channel]] is an example of anti-information.
According to [[Shannon–Hartley theorem|Shannon's Channel Coding Theorem]]
the [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]] of the noise must be subtracted to obtain the [[channel capacity]]
that remains available for reliable communication.

The [[gambling]] industry has made a business out of selling anti-information.
People are willing to pay for anti-information.
The increase in uncertainty enables them to savor the information that they subsequently receive
when the uncertainty is finally resolved.

The term anti-information was introduced by [[Jacobus Verhoeff|Koos Verhoeff]] in the 1970s
while teaching [[informatics]] at the [[Erasmus University Rotterdam]].

'''Appreciative inquiry''' ('''AI''') is a model that seeks to engage stakeholders in self-determined change. According to Bushe "AI revolutionized the field of organization development and was a precursor to the rise of positive organization studies and the strengths based movement in American management."&lt;ref&gt;Bushe, G.R. (2013) The appreciative inquiry model.  In E.H. Kessler, (ed.) Encyclopedia of Management Theory, (Volume 1, pp. 41-44), Sage Publications, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed at [[Case Western Reserve University]]'s department of [[organizational behavior]], starting with a 1987 article by [[David Cooperrider]] and Suresh Srivastva.  They felt that the overuse of "problem solving" hampered any kind of social improvement, and what was needed were new methods of inquiry that would help generate new ideas and models for how to organize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Cooperrider, D. L.|author2=Srivastva, S.|year=1987|chapter=Appreciative inquiry in organizational life|editor1=Woodman, R. W.|editor2=Pasmore, W.A.|lastauthoramp=y|title=Research in Organizational Change And Development|volume=Vol. 1|pages=129–169|location=Stamford, CT|publisher=JAI Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Cooperrider and Srivastva took a social constructionist approach, arguing that organizations are created, maintained and changed by conversations, and claiming that methods of organizing were only limited by people's imaginations and the agreements among them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Cooperrider, D. L.|author2=Barrett, F.|author3=Srivastva, S.|year=1995|contribution=Social construction and appreciative inquiry: A journey in organizational theory|editor1=Hosking, D.|editor2=Dachler, P.|editor3=Gergen, K.|title=Management and Organization: Relational Alternatives to Individualism|pages=157–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Cooperrider and [[Diana Whitney]] published an article outlining the five principles of AI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Cooperrider, D.L. |author2=Whitney, D|year=2001|chapter=A positive revolution in change|editor1=Cooperrider, D.

In 1996, Cooperrider, Whitney and several of their colleagues became centrally involved using AI to mid-wife the creation of the United Religions Initiative, a global organization dedicated to promoting grassroots interfaith cooperation for peace, justice and healing. This early partnership between URI and AI is chronicled in Birth of a Global Community: Appreciative Inquiry in Action by Charles Gibbs and Sally Mahé.  AI was also used in the first (1999) and subsequent meetings of business leaders that created the UN's Global Compact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://appreciativeinquiry.case.edu/intro/commentFeb05.cfm|title=Current Commentary on AI and Positive Change|author=Cooperrider, David|work=AI Commons|accessdate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another of the early applications, Cooperrider and Whitney taught AI to employees of GTE (now part of Verizon) resulting in improvements in employees' support for GTE's business direction and. as a part of continuous process improvement generated both improvements in revenue collection and cost savings earning GTE an [[ASTD]] award for the best organisational change program in the US in 1997."&lt;ref name="Bushe 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bushe, G.R.|author2=Kassam, A.|year=2005|title=When is appreciative inquiry transformational?

== Basis and principles ==

According to Bushe, AI "advocates collective inquiry into the best of what is, in order to imagine what could be, followed by collective design of a desired future state that is compelling and thus, does not require the use of incentives, coercion or persuasion for planned change to occur."&lt;ref name="Bushe, G.R. 2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bushe, G.R.|year=2013|url=http://www.gervasebushe.ca/the_AI_model.pdf|title=The Appreciative Inquiry Model|editor= Kessler, E.|work=The Encyclopedia of Management Theory|publisher= Sage Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model is based on the assumption that the questions we ask will tend to focus our attention in a particular direction, that organizations evolve in the direction of the questions they most persistently and passionately ask.&lt;ref&gt;Cooperrider, D.L. &amp; Whitney, D (2005) A positive revolution in change: Appreciative inquiry. In Cooperrider, D. L. Sorenson, P., Yeager, T. &amp; Whitney, D. (eds.) Appreciative Inquiry: Foundations in Positive Organization Development (pp.9-33).  Champaign, IL: Stipes.&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid 80's most methods of assessing and evaluating a situation and then proposing solutions were based on a ''deficiency'' model, predominantly asking questions such as "What are the problems?", "What's wrong?" or "What needs to be fixed?".  Instead of asking "What's the problem?", others couched the question in terms of "challenges", which still focused on deficiency, on what needs to be fixed or solved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Case Western Reserve University's Weatherhead School of Management|url=http://appreciativeinquiry.case.edu/|title=The Appreciative Inquiry Commons}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Appreciative Inquiry was the first serious managerial method to refocus attention on what works, the positive core, and on what people really care about.  Today, these ways of approaching organizational change are common&lt;ref&gt;Bushe, G.R. &amp; Marhsak, R.M. (2015) ''Dialogic Organization Development: The Theory and Practice of Organizational Transformation.''  Oakdland, CA: Berrett-Koehler.&lt;/ref&gt;

The five principles of AI are:&lt;ref name="Bushe, G.R. 2013" /&gt;
# The ''constructionist principle'' proposes that what we believe to be true determines what we do, and thought and action emerge from relationships.  Through the language and discourse of day to day interactions, people co-construct the organizations they inhabit.  The purpose of inquiry is to stimulate new ideas, stories and images that generate new possibilities for action.
# The ''principle of simultaneity'' proposes that as we inquire into human systems we change them and the seeds of change, the things people think and talk about, what they discover and learn, are implicit in the very first questions asked.  Questions are never neutral, they are fateful, and social systems move in the direction of the questions they most persistently and passionately discuss.
# The ''poetic principle'' proposes that organizational life is expressed in the stories people tell each other every day, and the story of the organization is constantly being co-authored.  The words and topics chosen for inquiry have an impact far beyond just the words themselves.  They invoke sentiments, understandings, and worlds of meaning. In all phases of the inquiry effort is put into using words that point to, enliven and inspire the best in people.
# The ''anticipatory principle'' posits that what we do today is guided by our image of the future.  Human systems are forever projecting ahead of themselves a horizon of expectation that brings the future powerfully into the present as a mobilizing agent. Appreciative inquiry uses artful creation of positive imagery on a collective basis to refashion anticipatory reality.
# The ''positive principle'' proposes that momentum and sustainable change requires positive affect and social bonding.  Sentiments like hope, excitement, inspiration, camaraderie and joy increase creativity, openness to new ideas and people, and cognitive flexibility.  They also promote the strong connections and relationships between people, particularly between groups in conflict, required for collective inquiry and change.

Some researchers believe that excessive focus on dysfunctions can actually cause them to become worse or fail to become better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Wallis, Claudia|date=January 17, 2005|work=Time Magazine|title=The Science of Happiness|url=http://www.authentichappiness.sas.upenn.edu/images/TimeMagazine/Time-Happiness.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060711093607/http://www.authentichappiness.sas.upenn.edu/images/timemagazine/Time-Happiness.pdf|archivedate=July 11, 2006 |deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, AI argues, when all members of an organization are motivated to understand and value the most favourable features of its culture, it can make rapid improvements.&lt;ref name="new-paradigm.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|title=Background|url=http://www.new-paradigm.co.uk/Appreciative.htm|work=New Paradigm|accessdate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strength-based methods are used in the creation of organizational development strategy and implementation of organizational effectiveness tactics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mt-online.com/component/content/article/77-february2007/228-building-strength-based-organizations.html|title=Building Strength-Based Organizations|first=Scott|last=Franklin|date=February 1, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928205741/http://www.mt-online.com/component/content/article/77-february2007/228-building-strength-based-organizations.html|archivedate=September 28, 2011|deadurl=y|work=Maintenance Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''appreciative'' mode of inquiry often relies on interviews to qualitatively understand the organization's potential strengths by looking at an organization's experience and its potential; the objective is to elucidate the assets and personal motivations that are its strengths.

Bushe has argued that mainstream proponents of AI focus too much attention on "the positive" and not enough on the transformation that AI can bring about through generating new ideas and the will to act on them.&lt;ref name="Bushe 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bushe, G.R.|year=2007|title=Appreciative inquiry is not (just) about the positive|journal=Organization Development Practitioner|volume=39|issue=4|pages=30–35|url=http://www.gervasebushe.ca/AI_pos.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.gervasebushe.ca/AI_generativity.pdf|title=Generative process, generative outcome: The transformational potential of appreciative inquiry|last=|first=|work=Organizational Generativity: The Appreciative Inquiry Summit and a Scholarship of Transformation|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing Limited|year=2013|isbn=|series=Advances in Appreciative Inquiry|volume=4|location=Bingley, UK|pages=|via=|author=Bushe, G.R.|editor1=D.L.

He argues that for transformational change to occur, AI must address problems that concern people enough to want to change.  However, AI addresses them not through problem-solving, but through generative images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bushe, G.R.|year=2013|title= Dialogic OD: A theory of practice|journal=Organization Development Practitioner, special issue on advances in Dialogic Organization Development|volume=45|issue=1|pages= 10–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of this is covered in a 90-minute discussion about AI, positivity and generativity by Bushe and Dr. Ron Fry of Case Western, at the 2012 World Appreciative Inquiry Conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Webcast Plenary Session 6: Prof. Dr. Ronald Fry and Prof. Dr. Gervase Bushe|url=http://www.2012waic.com/webcast-plenary-session-6-prof-dr-ronald-fry-and-prof-dr-gervase-bushe/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distinguishing features ==

The following table comes from the Cooperrider and Whitney (2001){{full|date=September 2018}} article and is used to describe some of the distinctions between AI and approaches to organizational development not based on what they call positive potential:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Case Western Reserve University|work=Appreciative Inquiry Commons|url=http://appreciativeinquiry.case.edu/intro/whatisai.cfm|title=What is Appreciative Inquiry?|accessdate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Appreciative inquiry attempts to use ways of asking questions and envisioning the future in order to foster positive relationships and build on the present potential of a given person, organization or situation.  The most common model utilizes a cycle of four processes, which focus on what it calls:
#''DISCOVER:'' The identification of organizational processes that work well.
#''DREAM:'' The envisioning of processes that would work well in the future.
#''DESIGN:'' Planning and prioritizing processes that would work well.
#''DESTINY'' (or ''DEPLOY''): The implementation (execution) of the proposed design.&lt;ref name="new-paradigm.co.uk"/&gt;

The aim is to build – or rebuild – organizations around what works, rather than trying to fix what doesn't. AI practitioners try to convey this approach as the opposite of problem solving.

==Implementing AI==

There are a variety of approaches to implementing appreciative inquiry, including mass-mobilised interviews and a large, diverse gathering called an Appreciative Inquiry Summit.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.positivechange.org/downloads/AI_and_Spiritual_ResonanceV.Final.pdf{{dead link|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These approaches involve bringing large, diverse groups of people together to study and build upon the ''best'' in an organization or community.

== Uses ==

AI is used in organizational development and as a [[Management consulting|consultancy]] tool in an attempt to bring about strategic change. It has been applied in businesses, health care bodies, social non-profit organizations, educational institutions, and government operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://appreciativeinquiry.case.edu/join/easySubmit.cfm|title=Easy Submit: Do you have a story, document, tool, event to share?|work= AI Commons|accessdate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although originating in the US, it is also used in the UK – for example in the  [[National Support Teams]] and around the world.  Since 2000, ''The AI Practitioner'', a quarterly publication, has described applications in a variety of settings around the world.

AI has various business applications and can effectively be used to elicit information from stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/fe15/76385b5e4767493f3d51224c721494b6ec10.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Positivity is paired with a group consensus to envision and begin producing an optimistic future based on existing strengths and successes. As seen in [[Harbarian process modeling]], AI has been used in [[Business process modeling]] to elicit information about an organization's present state and desired future state.

In Vancouver, AI is being used by the [[Dalai Lama Center for Peace and Education]]. The Center, which was founded by the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] and [[Victor Chan]], is using AI to facilitate compassionate communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heart-Mind Inquiry|work=Dalai Lama Center|url=http://dalailamacenter.org/programs/programs-development/appreciative-inquiry|accessdate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''yángsuì''''' 陽燧 or '''sun-mirror''' was an [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient Chinese]] [[burning-mirror]] that concentrates sunlight to ignite tinder and the '''''fāngzhū''''' 方諸 or '''moon-mirror''' was a device that collects nighttime dew by condensation. These two bronze implements are literary metaphors for [[yin and yang]], associating the "''yang''-mirror" ''yangsui'' with the sun (a.k.a. ''tàiyáng'' [[wikt:太陽|太陽]] "great ''yang''"), fire, dry, and round, and the "''yin''-mirror" ''fangshu'' with the moon (''tàiyīn'' [[wikt:太陰|太陰]] "great ''yin''"), water, wet, and square.

==Terminology==
There are numerous Chinese names for the fire-producing ''yángsuì'' 陽燧 "sun-mirror" and water-producing ''fāngzhū'' 方諸 "moon-mirror".

===''Yangsui''===
[[File:Huabiao denglong.jpg|thumb|right|''Hou'' 犼 dragon sitting on a ''chenglupan'' 承露盤 "dew collecting plate" capping a ''[[huabiao]]'' column]]
'''''Yángsuì''''' &lt; [[Old Chinese]] '''*''laŋsə-lu[t]-s''''' can be written 陽遂 or 陽燧, [[compound (linguistics)|compounding]]  ''yáng'' [[wikt:陽|陽]] (of ''yīnyáng'') "sunshine; shining; sunny side" with ''suì'' [[wikt:遂|遂]] "advance; accomplish; achieve" or ''suì'' [[wikt:燧|燧]] (clarified with the [[Radical 86|fire radical]] [[wikt:火|火]]) "light a fire". Compare the mirrorless ''sui'' terms [[Suiren]] 燧人 (with "person") "a mythical sage who invented [[Firelighting#Friction|friction firelighting]]", ''suìshí'' 燧石 (with "stone") "flint", ''mùsuì'' 木燧 (with "wood"), meaning either "hearth-board" or "fire-drill", and ''fēngsuì'' 烽燧 (with "beacon") "beacon-fire". ''Yángsuìzú'' 陽燧足 "sun-mirror feet" is an old Chinese name for "[[brittle star]]". ''Suì'' 燧 also had early graphic variants 鐆 and 䥙, written with the [[Radical 167|metal radical]] 金 specifying the bronze mirror.

The ''[[Hanyu Da Cidian]]'' unabridged Chinese dictionary (1993, 11: 1974) gives three meanings for ''yángsuì'' 陽遂 (written without the "fire radical"): 亦作"阳燧" 古代利用日光取火的凹面铜镜 ["Also written 阳燧, a concave bronze mirror anciently used to start a fire from sunlight."]; 清畅通达貌 ["appearance of clear, unobstructed flowing"], which was first recorded in a poem (洞箫赋) by [[Wang Bao]] (c. 84 – c. 53 BCE); and 古代车上的一种采光装置 ["an ancient type of chariot window that admits light"], which was first recorded in the ''[[Book of Jin]]'' history covering 265 to 420 CE.

Three uncommon variant names for the concave fire-starting mirror are '''''fúsuì''''' &lt; '''*''[b]asә-lu[t]-s''''' 夫遂 (with [[wikt: 夫|夫]] "that") used in the ''Zhouli'' (below), '''''jīnsuì''''' &lt; '''*''k(r)[ә]msә-lu[t]-s''''' 金燧 (with [[wikt:金|金]] "metal") used in the ''Liji'' (below), and '''''yángfú''''' &lt; '''*''laŋ[b](r)o''''' 陽符 used in ''Taiping Yulan'' (below) (1993, 2: 1457).

English translations of the Chinese sun-mirror in classic texts (cited below) include:
*"metal speculum for getting fire from the sun" (Legge 1885)
*"burning-glass" (Forke 1907)
*"sun-mirror" (de Groot 1910)
*"burning mirror" (Needham and Wang 1962)
*"solar kindlers" or "igniters using ''yang''" (Schafer 1963)
*"burning-mirror" (Ware 1966)
*"burning mirror" (Major et al. 2010)

===''Fangzhu''===
The name '''''fāngzhū''''' &lt; '''*''C-paŋta''''' 方諸 combines ''fāng'' [[wikt:方|方]] "square; side; region" and ''zhū'' [[wikt:諸|諸]] "all; various". The ''Hanyu Da Cidian'' (1993, 6: 1570) gives two ''fāngzhū'' meanings: 古代在月下承露取水的器具 ["an ancient device used to collect dew in the moonlight in order to obtain water", with the oldest usage example from the ''Huainanzi'' (below); 传说中仙人住所 "a mythical place where ''[[xian (Taoism)|xian]]'' 'transcendents; immortals' reside"], which was first recorded in (c. 499) [[Shangqing School]] Daoist collection ''[[Zhen'gao]]'' 真誥 "Declarations of the Perfected", which says Fangzhu was named from being square, 1,300 ''[[Li (unit)|li]]'' on each side, and 9,000 ''[[Zhàng|zhang]]'' high. Gustave Schlegel (1875: 612) says the ''yangsui'' mirror is perfectly round and the ''fangzhu'' is ("le Carré total") "perfectly square", which is consistent with ''yanyang'' theory since roundness pertained to ''yang'' and heavenly fiery things, while squareness pertained to ''yin'' and earthly watery things. Umehara (1956: 142) described square mirrors believed to be from the [[Qin dynasty]]. ''Qīngtóng'' 青童 "Azure Lad", which is a [[homophone]] of ''qīngtóng'' 青銅 (lit. "azure copper") "bronze", is one of the main deities in [[Shangqing School|Shangqing Daoism]], and lord of the mythic paradise Fangzhu "Square Speculum Isle" in the eastern sea near [[Mount Penglai]] (Smith 2008: 803).

The (983) ''[[Taiping Yulan]]'' encyclopedia lists some ''yinyang'' synonyms of ''yangsui'' and ''fangzhu'', "The ''yangsui'' or '''''yángfú''''' &lt; '''*''laŋ[b](r)o''''' 陽符 (with ''fú'' [[wikt:符|符]] "tally; talisman; magic figure") obtains fire from the sun. The '''''yīnfú''''' &lt; '''*''q(r)um[b](r)o''''' 陰符 (cf. ''[[Huangdi Yinfujing|Yinfujing]]'' "Hidden Tally Scripture") or '''''yīnsuì''''' &lt; '''*''q(r)umsə-lu[t]-s''''' 陰燧 obtains water from the moon. They are copper amalgam mirrors, also named 'water and fire mirrors'."

''Chénglùpán'' 承露盤 "plate for receiving dew" is a near-synonym for ''fangzhu'' (Needham and Wang 1962: 89). The ''[[huabiao]]'', which is a type of [[Chinese architecture|Chinese architectural]] column traditionally erected in front of palaces and tombs, is topped by a mythical ''hou'' 犼 "a wolf-headed [[Chinese dragon]]" sitting on a round ''chenglupan'' "dew-collecting plate" cap.

There are comparatively fewer English translations of the Chinese moon-mirror, which lacks a direct translation equivalent and is more frequently  [[Romanization of Chinese|romanized]], include:
*"moon-mirror" (Forke 1907)
*"Yin mirror" (Needham and Wang 1962)
*"metal speculum for gathering water from the moon" (Ware 1966)
*"square speculum" (Smith 2008)
*"square receptacle" (Major et al. 2010)

==Mirror metaphors==
Metaphorically using ''fangzhu'' and ''yangsui'' mirrors to represent ''yin'' and ''yang'' reflects a more commonly used Chinese philosophical metaphor of a mirror to denote the ''[[Xin (concept)|xin]]'' 心 "heart-mind". For instance, the ''Zhuangzi'' famously says having a mirror-like ''xin'' represents the ideal state of unity with the Dao.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Do not be a corpse for fame, Do not be a storehouse of schemes; Do not be responsible for affairs, Do not be a proprietor of knowledge. Thoroughly embody unendingness and wander in nonbeginning. Thoroughly experience what you receive from heaven but do not reveal what you attain. Just be empty, that's all. The mind of the ultimate man functions like a mirror. It neither sends off nor welcomes; it responds but does not retain. Therefore, he can triumph over things without injury. (7, tr. Mair 1994: 70-71) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The stillness of the sage is not because stillness is said to be good and therefore he is still. It is because the myriad things are unable to disturb his mind that he is still. When water is still, it clearly reflects whiskers and brows. It is so accurate that the great craftsman takes his standard from it. If still water has such clarity, how much more so pure spirit! The stillness of the mind of the sage is the mirror of heaven and earth, the looking glass of the myriad things. (13, tr. Mair 1994: 119-120) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many scholars of Chinese philosophy have analyzed the mirror metaphor for the ''xin'' "heart-mind". Harold Oshima (1983: 75) explains that for a modern Westerner who regards a mirror as a commonplace looking-glass, this metaphor "appears quite pedestrian and unexciting" until one realizes that the ancient Chinese imagined mirrors "to possess broad and mysterious powers." For instance, a mirror can reveal and control demons. The ''Baopuzi'' (above) says a Daoist practitioner entering the mountains would suspend a mirror on his back, which was believed to prevent the approach of demons—compare the European belief that a mirror is [[Vampire#Apotropaics|apotropaic toward vampires]] who are supposedly unable to produce a reflection. Oshima says the ''yangsui'' burning-mirror that miraculously produces fire best illustrates the "great sense of mystery surrounding mirrors". "Certainly this mirror symbolized a powerful connection with the greater powers of the heavens and, as such, would have served admirably as a model for the [''xin'']."
&lt;blockquote&gt;For the early Chinese, mirrors were not simply passive "reflectors" of information, they offered accurate and appropriate ''responses'' to whatever came before them. When placed before the sun—the ultimate ''yang'' 陽 phenomenon in the world—they respond with fire: the pure essence of ''yang''. When placed before the moon—the ultimate ''yin'' 陰 phenomenon in the world—they respond with water: the pure essence of ''yin''. Thus mirrors offer the paradigm for ''proper responsiveness'': they reflect the true essence of the ultimate ''yin'' and ''yang''—the alpha and omega of phenomena in early Chinese cosmology." (Carr and Ivanhoe 2000: 56) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Erin Cline says the early Chinese attributed mirrors to have a mysterious power and great religious significance. The ceremonial bronze ''fusui'' 夫遂 and ''yangsui'' 陽燧 mirrors were seen as active, responsive objects because they could be used to produce fire and water (two of the Five Phases). 
&lt;blockquote&gt;When placed outside, concave mirrors focused sunlight to produce fire, while bronze mirrors gathered condensation in the light of the moon. But it was not simply the fact that mirrors had the power to ''gather'' or ''produce'' that made them objects of religious significance in ancient China; it was what they produced. Water and fire were thought to be the pure essences of ''yin'' and ''yang'', respectively, and the fact that mirrors appeared to ''draw'' these substances from the sun and moon reinforced the cosmological power that was already associated with them. (2008: 338)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Textual examples==
The [[Chinese classics]] contain early information about ''yangsui'' fire-mirrors and ''fangshu'' water-mirrors. The first two sources below are "ritual texts" of uncertain dates, and the others are presented chronologically.

===Zhouli===
The (c. 2nd century BCE) ''[[Zhouli]]'' "Zhou Rites" is a compilation of [[Zhou dynasty#Eastern Zhou|Eastern Zhou]] (771-256 BCE) texts about government bureaucracy and administration. It describes two kinds of ritual officials making the purifying "new fire". The ''Siguan'' 司爟 "Directors of Fire Ceremonies" used a ''zuānsuì'' 鑽燧 "[[Bow drill#Hand drill|fire-drill]]", for which a variety of different woods were chosen at five periods during the year (Biot 1881 2: 194). The ''Sixuanshi'' 司烜氏 "Directors of Sun Fire" ceremonially used a ''yangsui'' "burning-mirror" to start the "new fire".
&lt;blockquote&gt;They have the duty of receiving, with the [''fusui'' 夫遂] mirror, brilliant fire from the sun; and of receiving with the (ordinary) mirror [''jian'' 鑒] brilliant water from the moon. They carry out these operations in order to prepare brilliant rice, brilliant torches for sacrifices, and brilliant water. (tr. Needham and Wang 1962: 87, cf. Biot 1881 2: 381) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The ''Zhouli'' commentary of [[Zheng Xuan]] (127–200) glosses  ''fusui'' as ''yangsui''. The sub-commentary of Jia Gongyan 賈公彦 says the ''fusui'' is called ''yangsui'' because it starts a fire by means of the ''jīng'' 精 "spirit; essence" of the ''taiyang'' "great ''yang''; sun".

===Liji===
Another ritual text similar to the ''Zhouli'', the (c. 2nd-1st century BCE) ''[[Liji]]'' "Record of Rites" is a compilation of Eastern Zhou textual materials. "The Pattern of the Family" section lists idealized duties of family members. Sons and daughters-in-law are supposed to wear a utility belt that includes metal and wood (two of the [[Wu Xing|Five Phases]]) ''suì'' fire-starters: ''jīnsuì'' 金燧 "burning-mirror" and a ''mùsuì'' 木燧 "fire-drill", which implies that fire-mirrors were quite commonly used among the ancient Chinese (Forke 1911: 497).
&lt;blockquote&gt;From the left and right of the girdle [a son] should hang their articles for use—on the left side, the duster and handkerchief, the knife and whetstone, the small spike, and the metal speculum for getting fire from the sun [金燧]; on the right, the archer's thimble for the thumb and the armlet, the tube for writing instruments, the knife-case [or "needle-case" for a daughter-in-law], the larger spike, and the borer for getting fire from wood [木燧]. (tr. Legge 1885 27: 449, 450) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Zheng Xuan's ''Liji'' commentary glosses ''musui'' as ''zuānhuǒ'' 鑽火 "produce fire by friction". [[Kong Yingda]] (574 – 648) quotes Huang Kan 皇侃, "When it is daylight, use the ''jinsui'' to start a fire from the sun, when it is dark, use the ''musui'' to start a fire with a drill". The commentary of Sun Xidan 孙希旦 (1736-1784) says ''jinsui'' or ''yangsui'' 陽遂 "''yang'' burning-mirrors" should ideally be cast on the Summer Solstice and ''yinjian'' 陰鑒 "''yin'' mirrors" on the Winter Solstice.

The ''[[Chunqiu Fanlu]]'' (14), attributed to [[Dong Zhongshu]] (179–104 BC), says ''císhí'' 磁石 "[[lodestone]]" attracts iron and ''jǐngjīn'' 頸金 "neck metal; burning-mirror" attracts fire; [[Joseph Needham]] and [[Wang Ling (historian)|Wang Ling]] (1962: 88) suggest the name "neck metal" derives from either the mirror being hung round the neck, or because necks are concave things.

===Huainanzi===
[[Liu An]]'s (c. 139 BCE) ''[[Huainanzi]]'' "Masters of Huainan", which is a compendium of writings from various schools of Chinese philosophy, was the first text to record ''fangzhu'' dew-collectors.

Two ''Huainanzi'' chapters metaphorically use "sun and moon mirrors" to exemplify ''yang'' and ''yin'' categories and elucidate the Chinese notion of ''[[ganying]]'' "cosmic resonance" through which categorically identical things mutually resonate and influence each other. The ''yángsuì'' 陽燧 "burning-mirror" is ''yang'', round, and sun-like; the ''fāngzhū'' 方諸 "square receptacle" is ''yin'', square, and moon-like. The first context describes ''yangsui'' and ''fangzhu'' mirrors ''jiàn'' 見 "seeing" the sun and moon. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Way of Heaven is called the Round; the Way of Earth is called the Square. The square governs the obscure; the circular governs the bright. The bright emits ''qi'', and for this reason fire is the external brilliance of the sun. The obscure sucks in ''qi'', and for this reason water is the internal luminosity of the moon. Emitted ''qi'' endows; retained ''qi'' transforms. Thus yang endows and yin transforms. The unbalanced ''qi'' of Heaven and Earth, becoming perturbed, causes wind; the harmonious ''qi'' of Heaven and Earth, becoming calm, causes rain. When yin and yang rub against each other, their interaction [感] produces thunder. Aroused, they produce thunderclaps; disordered they produce mist. When the yang ''qi'' prevails, it scatters to make rain and dew; when the yin ''qi'' prevails, it freezes to make frost and snow. Hairy and feather creatures make up the class of flying and walking things and are subject to yang. Creatures with scales and shells make up the class of creeping and hiding things and are subject to yin. The sun is the ruler of yang. Therefore, in spring and summer animals shed their fur; at the summer solstice, stags' antlers drop off. The moon is the fundament of yin. Therefore when the moon wanes, the brains of fish shrink; when the moon dies, wasps and crabs shrivel up. Fire flies upward; water flows downward. Thus, the flight of birds is aloft; the movement of fishes is downward. Things within the same class mutually move one another; root and twig mutually respond to each other [相應]. Therefore, when the burning mirror sees the sun, it ignites tinder and produces fire [故陽燧見日則燃而為火]. When the square receptacle sees the moon, it moistens and produces water [方諸見月則津而為水]. When the tiger roars, the valley winds rush; when the dragon arises, the bright clouds accumulate. When ''qilins'' wrangle, the sun or moon is eclipsed; when the leviathan dies, comets appear. When silkworms secrete fragmented silk, the ''shang'' string [of a stringed instrument] snaps. When meteors fall, the Bohai surges upward. (3.2, tr. Major et al. 2010: 115-116) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The second mentions some of the same ''yinyang'' and ''ganying'' folk-beliefs. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;That things in their [various] categories are mutually responsive [相應] is [something] dark, mysterious, deep, and subtle. Knowledge is not capable of assessing it; argument is not capable of explaining it. Thus, when the east wind arrives, wine turns clear and overflows [its vessels]; when silkworms secrete fragmented silk, the ''shang'' string [of a stringed instrument] snaps. Something has stimulated [感] them. When a picture is traced out with the ashes of reeds, the moon's halo has a [corresponding] gap. When the leviathan dies, comets appear. Something has moved them. Thus, when a sage occupies the throne, he embraces the Way and does not speak, and his nurturance reaches to the myriad people. But when ruler and ministers [harbor] distrust in their hearts, back-to-back arcs appear in the sky. The mutual responses [相應] of spirit ''qi'' are subtle indeed! Thus, mountain clouds are like grassy hummocks; river clouds are like fish scales; dryland clouds are like smoky fire; cataract clouds are like billowing water. All resemble their forms and evoke responses [感] according to their class. The burning mirror takes fire from the sun; the square receptacle takes dew from the moon [夫陽燧取火於日方諸取露於月]. Of [all the things] between Heaven and Earth, even a skilled astrologer cannot master all their techniques. [Even] a hand [that can hold] minutely tiny and indistinct things cannot grasp a beam of light. However, from what is within the palm of one's hand, one can trace [correlative] categories to beyond the extreme end point [of the cosmos]. [Thus] that one can set up [these implements] and produce water and fire is [a function of] the mutually [responsive] movement of yin and yang of the same ''qi''. (6.2, tr. Major et al. 2010:216-217) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The ''Huainanzi'' commentary of [[Gao You]] (fl. 210 CE) says,
&lt;blockquote&gt;The burning mirror is of metal. One takes a metal cup untarnished with verdigris and polishes it strongly, then it is heated by being made to face the sun at noon time; in this position cause it to play upon mugwort tinder and this will take fire. The [''fangzhu''] is the Yin mirror [''yinsui'' 陰燧]; it is like a large clam(-shell) [''dage'' 大蛤]. It is also polished and held under the moonlight at full moon; water collects upon it, which can be received in drops upon the bronze plate. So the statements of our ancient teacher are really true. (tr. Needham and Wang 1962: 88) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to Needham and Wang (1962: 90), this comparison between a ''fangzhu'' mirror that drew water from the moon and a bivalve shell reflects an ancient Chinese confusion between beliefs about moon-mirrors and beliefs that certain marine animals waxed and waned in correspondence with the moon. For example, the (c. 3rd century BCE) ''[[Guanzi (text)|Guanzi]]'' says,
&lt;blockquote&gt;The virtue of a ruler is what all the people obey, just as the moon is the root and fount of all Yin things. So at full moon, shellfish [''bangge'' 蚌蛤] are fleshy, and all that is Yin abounds. When the moon has waned, the shellfish are empty and Yin things weak. When the moon appears in the heavens all Yin things are influenced right down to the depths of the sea. So the sage lets virtue flow forth from himself, and the four outer wildernesses rejoice in his benevolent love. (tr. Needham and Wang 1962: 31) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The authors compare [[Aristotle]]'s (c. 350 BCE) ''[[Parts of Animals]]'' recording that some kinds of [[sea urchins]] were fat and good to eat at the full moon, which was one of the oldest biological observations about the lunar periodicity of the reproductive system of [[echinoderms]], especially sea urchins.

A third ''Huainanzi'' chapter accurately describes the importance of finding a ''sui'' burning-mirror's focal point. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Way of employing people is like drawing fire from a mirror [以燧取火]; if you're too far away [from the tinder], you won't get anything; if you're too close, it won't work. The right [distance] lies between far away and close. Observing the dawn, he [calculates] the shift [of the sun] at dusk; measuring the crooked, he tells [how far] something departs from the straight and level. When a sage matches things up, it is as if he holds up a mirror to their form; from the crooked [reflection], he can get to the nature [of things]. (17.227-228, tr. Major et al. 2010: 707-708) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The ''Huainanzi'' frequently uses the term ''suìhuǒ'' 燧火 "kindle a fire", for instance, in the second month of summer, the Emperor "drinks water gathered from the eight winds and cooks with fire [kindled from] cudrania branches (5.5, tr. Major et al. 2010; 188).

===Lunheng===
[[File:Wu liang shrine relief depicting xihe, yi, and fusang tree.jpg|thumb|Houyi takes aim at the suns (right upper corner), rubbing from the Wu Liang shrines reliefs]]
[[Wang Chong]]'s (c. 80 CE) ''[[Lunheng]]'' mentions the ''fangzhu'' 方諸 in two chapters (46, 47), and the ''yangsui'' in five, written 陽遂 (8, 32) and 陽燧 (47, 74, 80).

The German sinologist Alfred Forke's (1907, 1911) English translation of the ''Lunheng'' consistently renders ''fangzhu'' as "moon-mirror" and ''yangsui'' as "[[burning-glass]]", because two chapters describe "liquefying five stones" (''wǔshí'' 五石) on a [[bingwu]] day (43rd in the 60-day [[sexagenary cycle]]) in the fifth [[Chinese calendar#Month|lunar month]]. Forke (1911: 496) circularly reasons that, "If this be true, the material must have been a sort of glass, for otherwise it could not possess the qualities of a burning glass. Just flint glass of which optical instruments are now made consists of five stony and earthy substances—silica, lead oxide, potash, lime, and clay. The Taoists in their alchemistical researches may have discovered such a mixture." The French sinologist [[Berthold Laufer]] (1915: 182-183, 187) refutes Forke's "downright literary concoction" of ''yangsui'' as "burning-glass" because Wang Chong's ''wushi'' 五石 "five stones" reference was a literary allusion to the [[Nüwa]] legend's ''wuseshi'' 五色石 "five-colored stone; multicolored stone", and because the Zhou Chinese did not have a word for "glass", which was unknown to them. Forke overlooked the (c. 320) Daoist text ''Baopuzi'' (below, Ware 1966: 294) that also describes smelting the "five minerals" (identified as realgar, cinnabar, orpiment, alum, and laminar malachite) on the ''bingwu'' day of a fifth month to make magic daggers that will protect travelers from water demons.

Both ''Lunheng'' contexts about casting a ''yangsui'' "burning-mirror" on a ''bingwu'' day use the phrase ''xiāoliàn wǔshí'' 消鍊五石 "smelting five minerals". The first contrasts burning-mirrors and crooked sword-blades.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The laws of Heaven can be applied in a right and in a wrong way. The right way is in harmony with Heaven, the wrong one owes its results to human astuteness, but cannot in its effects be distinguished from the right one. This will be shown by the following. Among the "Tribute of Yu" are mentioned jade and white corals. These were the produce of earth and genuine precious stones and pearls. But the Taoists melt five kinds of stones, and make five-coloured gems out of them. Their lustre, if compared with real gems, does not differ. Pearls in fishes and shells are as genuine as the jade-stones in the Tribute of Yu. Yet the Marquis of Sui made pearls from chemicals, which were as brilliant as genuine ones. This is the climax of Taoist learning and a triumph of their skill. By means of a burning-glass [陽燧] one catches fire from heaven. Of five stones liquefied on the [Bingwu] day of the 5th moon an instrument is cast, which, when polished bright, held up against the sun, brings down fire too, in precisely the same manner as, when fire is caught in the proper way. Now, one goes even so far as to furbish the crooked blades of swords, till they shine, when, held up against the sun, they attract fire also. Crooked blades are not burning-glasses; that they can catch fire is the effect of rubbing. Now, provided the bad-natured men are of the same kind as good-natured ones, then they can be influenced, and induced to do good. Should they be of a different kind, they can also be coerced in the same manner as the Taoists cast gems, Sui Hou made pearls, and people furbish the crooked blades of swords. Enlightened with learning and familiarized with virtue, they too begin by and by to practise benevolence and equity. (8, tr. Forke 1907: 377-378) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Needham and Wang interpret this ''Lunheng'' passage as an account of making glass burning-lenses. Despite Forke's translation of ''suíhòu'' 隨侯, with ''suí'' 隨 "follow; comply with; the ancient state [[Sui (state)|Sui]]" and [[Chinese nobility#Princehood and peerage|''hóu'']] 侯 "marquis", as the legendary "Sui Hou; Marquis of Sui" who received a fabulous pearl from a snake; they translate "following proper timing", citing the [[Chinese alchemy|Chinese alchemical]] term ''huǒhòu'' 火候 "fire-times; times when heating should begin and end", and reading ''hóu'' 侯 "marquis" as a miscopy of ''hòu'' 候 "time; wait; situation".
&lt;blockquote&gt;But by following proper timing (i.e. when to begin heating and how long to go on) pearls can be made from chemicals [''yao'' 藥], just as brilliant as genuine ones. This is the climax of Taoist learning and a triumph of their skill. Now by means of the burning-mirror [''yangsui''] one catches fire from heaven. Yet of five mineral substances liquefied and transmuted on a [''bingwu''] day in the fifth month, an instrument [''qi'' 器] is cast, which, when brightly polished and held up against the sun, brings down fire too, in precisely the same manner as when fire is caught in the proper way. (tr. Needham and Wang 1962: 112) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Wang Chong gives three contrasts between "genuine" and "imitation" things: the opaque glass "jade" made by Daoist alchemists with the real thing; the artificially made "pearls" with true pearls; and the "instrument" made by liquefying five different minerals, which can concentrate the sun's rays like the traditional bronze burning-mirror. Furthermore, Needham and Wang question why the ''Lunheng'' specifies five different minerals, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Bronze would require only two ores, perhaps even only one, with possible addition of a flux. Glass needs silica, limestone, an alkaline carbonate, and perhaps litharge or the barium mineral, together with colouring matter. Of course, the text does not clearly tell us that lenses were being made; the instruments might have been simply glass mirrors imitating the bronze ones. (1962: 113) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Based on archeological finds of glass objects substituting for jade and bronze ones in tombs dating back to the Warring States period, Needham and Wang (1962: 113) conclude that the Chinese were making glass [[lens (optics)|lenses]] in the 1st century CE, and probably as far back as the 3rd century BCE.

The second context explains ''[[ganying]]'' "cosmic resonance" with examples of ''bingwu'' burning-mirrors, moon-mirrors, and ''tulong'' 土龍 "[[Yinglong#Shanhaijing|clay dragons]]" believed analogously to cause rainfall like Chinese [[Chinese dragon|''long'' dragons]]. It describes a dispute between Han astronomer [[Liu Xin (scholar)|Liu Xin]], who used a clay dragon in a rain sacrifice, but could not explain the reason why it worked, when the scholar [[Huan Tan]] argued that only a genuine lodestone can attract needles.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The objection that the dragon was not genuine, is all right, but it is wrong not to insist on relationship. When an east wind blows, wine flows over, and [when a whale dies, a comet appears.] The principle of Heaven is spontaneity, and does not resemble human activity, being essentially like that affinity between clouds and dragons. The sun is fire, and the moon is water. Fire and water are always affected by genuine fluids. Now, physicists cast burning-glasses [陽燧] wherewith to catch the flying fire from the sun, and they produce moon-mirrors [方諸] to draw the water from the moon. That is not spontaneity, yet Heaven agrees to it. A clay dragon is not genuine either, but why should it not be apt to affect Heaven? With a burning-glass one draws fire from Heaven. In the fifth month, on a [bingwu] day at noon, they melt five stones, and cast an instrument with which they obtain fire. Now, without further ceremony, they also take the crooked hooks on swords and blades, rub them, hold them up towards the sun, and likewise affect Heaven. If a clay dragon cannot be compared with a burning-glass, it can at least be placed on a level with those crooked hooks on swords and blades. (47, tr. Forke 1911: 350-351) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
A third ''Lunheng'' chapter, which mentions casting burning-mirrors on the fifth month but not the ''bingwu'' day, criticizes the Han philosopher [[Dong Zhongshu]]'s belief that clay dragons could cause rain.
&lt;blockquote&gt;[E]ven Heaven may be induced to respond, by tricks. In order to stir up the heavenly fluid, the spirit should be used, but people will employ burning glasses [陽燧], to attract the fire from the sky. By melting five stones and moulding an instrument in the fifth month, in the height of summer, one may obtain fire. But now people merely take knives and swords or crooked blades of common copper, and, by rubbing them and holding them up against the sun, they likewise get fire. As by burning glasses, knives, swords, and blades one may obtain fire from the sun, so even ordinary men, being neither Worthies nor Sages, can influence the fluid of Heaven, as Tung Chung Shu was convinced that by a clay dragon he could attract the clouds and rain, and he had still some reason for this belief. If even those who in this manner conform to the working of Heaven, cannot be termed Worthies, how much less have those a claim to this name who barely win people’s hearts? (80, tr. Forke 1911: 132) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The other ''Lunheng'' reference to moon-mirrors mentions moon mythology about the [[moon rabbit]] and [[Jin Chan|three-legged toad]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;When we hold up a moon-mirror [方諸] towards the moon, water comes down. The moon approaching the Hyades or leaving the constellation of the ‘House’ from the north, it nearly always inevitably rains. The animals in the moon are the hare and the toad. Their counterparts on earth are snails and corn-weevils. When the moon is eclipsed in the sky, snails and corn-weevils decrease on earth, which proves that they are of the same kind. When it rains without ceasing, one attacks all that belongs to the Yin. To obtain a result one ought to hunt and kill hares and toads, and smash snails and corn-weevils. (46, tr. Forke 1911: 341) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Two chapters mention ''yangsui'' mirrors to express skepticism about the [[Chinese mythology|Chinese myth]] that the archer [[Houyi]] shot down nine of the [[Houyi#The Time of the Ten Suns|Ten Suns]] (children of [[Di Jun]] and [[Xihe (deity)|Xihe]]) that were burning up earth.
&lt;blockquote&gt;We see that with a sun-glass fire [陽遂] is drawn from heaven, the sun being a big fire. Since on earth fire is one fluid, and the earth has not ten fires, how can heaven possess ten suns? Perhaps the so called ten suns are some other things, whose light and shape resembles that of the sun. They are staying in the ‘Hot Water Abyss’, and always climb up Fu-sang. Yü and Yi saw them, and described them as ten suns. (32, tr. Forke 1911: 272-273) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
These legendary references are to [[Fusang]], [[Yu the Great|Yu]], and [[Yi (husbandman)|Yi]]. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The sun is fire: in the sky it is the sun, and on earth it is fire. How shall we prove it? A burning glass [陽遂] being held up towards the sun, fire comes down from heaven. Consequently fire is the solar fluid. The sun is connected with the cycle of ten, but fire is not. How is it that there are ten suns and twelve constellations? The suns are combined with these constellations, therefore [''jia''] is joined to [''zi'']. But what are the so called ten suns? Are there ten real suns, or is there only one with ten different names? (74, tr. Forke 1911: 412) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
''Jia'' 甲 and ''zi'' 子 are the first signs of the [[heavenly stems]] and [[earthly branches]] in the [[Chinese calendar]].

===Baopuzi===
Three "Inner Chapters" of the (c. 320 CE) ''[[Baopuzi]]'', written by the [[Jin Dynasty (265–420)|Jin Dynasty]] scholar [[Ge Hong]], provide information about ''yangsui'' 陽燧 "burning-mirrors" and ''fangzhu'' 方諸 "dew-mirrors".

In Chapter 3 "Rejoinder to Popular Conceptions", Ge Hong mentions the commonly used sun and moon mirrors to answer an interlocutor who criticizes Daoist alchemical recipes for immortality as "specious … unreliable fabrications of wondermongers".
&lt;blockquote&gt;According to your argument, they would appear inefficacious, but even the most minor of them is not without effect. I have frequently seen people obtain water from the moon at night by means of a speculum, and fire from the sun in the morning by used of a burning-mirror [餘數見人以方諸求水於夕月陽燧引火於朝日]. I have seen people conceal themselves to the point of complete disappearance, or change their appearance so that they no longer seem human. I have seen them knot a kerchief, throw it to the ground, and produce a hopping hare. I have seen them sew together a red belt and thereby produce a wriggling snake. I have seen people make melons and fruit ripen in an instant, or dragons and fish come and go in a basin. All of these things occurred just as it was said they would. (tr. Ware 1966: 62-3) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chapter 4 "Gold and Cinnabar" refers to the ''yinyang'' mirrors in two contexts. The first describes an alchemical elixir method that uses a burning-mirror to create a mercury alloy dew-mirror.
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is also a [''Minshan danfa'' 岷山丹法], found in a cave by [Zhang Kaita 張蓋蹋] as he was giving careful thought to such matters on Mount Min. This method forges yellow copper alloy to make a speculum for gathering water from the moon [其法鼓冶黃銅以作方諸]. It is then covered with mercury and its interior heated with solar essence (gathered by a burning-mirror) [以承取月中水以水銀覆之]. The taking of this substance over a long period will produce immortality. This same text also teaches us to place this elixir in a copper mirror coated with realgar, cover it with mercury, and expose it to the sun for twenty days, after which it is uncovered and treated. When taken in the form of pills the size of grams, washed down with the first water drawn from the well at dawn, for a hundred days, it makes the blind see, and by itself cures those who are ill. It will also turn white hair black and regrow teeth. (tr. Ware 1966: 83-84) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The second ''fangzhu'' context describes using plates and bowls made from an elixir of immortality in order to collect the ''yè'' 液 "liquid; fluid; juice" (tr. "exudate") of the sun and moon, which also provides immortality.
&lt;blockquote&gt; A recipe for making "black amber sesame" [威喜巨勝] from Potable Gold is to combine Potable Gold with mercury and cook for thirty days. Remove, and fill a clay bowl with it. Seal with Six-One lute [a mixture of alum, arsenolite, salts, limestone, etc.], place in a raging fire, and cook for sixty double-hours, by which time it all turns to elixir. Take a quantity of this the size of a gram and you will immediately become a genie. A spatula of this elixir mixed with one pound of mercury will immediately turn it to silver; a pound placed over a fire, which is then fanned, will turn into a reddish gold termed "vermillion gold" [丹金]. If daggers and sword are smeared with it, they will ward off all other weapons within ten thousand miles. If plates and bowls are made of vermillion gold and used for drinking and eating, they will produce Fullness of Life. If these dishes are used to gather exudate of the sun and moon, as specula are used to gather lunar water [以承日月得液如方諸之得水也], the exudate will produce immortality when drunk. (tr. Ware 1966: 90) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chapter 16 "The Yellow and the White" uses the abbreviations ''zhu'' 諸 and ''sui'' 燧 along with ''fangzhu'' and ''yangsui'' to compare natural and artificial transformations. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;What is it that the arts of transformation cannot do? May I remind my readers that the human body, which is normally visible, can be made to disappear? Ghosts and gods are normally invisible, but there are ways and means to make them visible. Those capable of operating these methods and prescriptions will be found to abound wherever you go. Water and fire are present in the sky, but they may be brought down with specula and burning-mirrors [水火在天而取之以諸燧]; lead is naturally white, but it can be reddened and mistaken for cinnabar. Cinnabar is naturally red, but it can be whitened to look like lead. Clouds, rain, frost, and snow are all breaths belonging to heaven and earth, but those produced by art differ in no way from the natural phenomena. Flying things and those that creep and crawl have been created in specific shapes, but it would be impossible ever to finish listing the thousands upon thousands of sudden metamorphoses which they can undergo. Man himself is the most highly honored member of creation and the most highly endowed, yet there are just as many instances of men and women changing into cranes, stones, tigers, monkeys, sand, or lizards. The cases of high mountains becoming deep abysses and of profound valleys changing into peaks are metamorphoses on an immense scale. It is clear, therefore, that transformation is something spontaneous in nature. Why should we doubt the possibility of making gold and silver from something different? Compare, if you will, the fire obtained with a burning-mirror and the water which condenses at night on the surface of a metal speculum [譬諸陽燧所得之火方諸所得之水]. Do they differ from ordinary water and fire? (tr. Ware 1966: 262-263) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Baopuzi'' also mentions ''míngjìng'' 明鏡 "bright mirror" magic, such as meditating on paired "sun" and "moon" mirrors to see spiritual beings, using mirror reflections to protect against shapeshifting demons (de Groot 1910: 1000-1005 discusses Chinese demon-conquering mirrors), and practicing Daoist [[multilocation]]. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;At other times a bright mirror nine inches or more in diameter [明鏡徑九寸已上] is used for looking at oneself with something on the mind. After seven days and nights a god or genie will appear, either male, female, old, or young, and a single declaration on its part discloses automatically what is occurring at that moment a thousand miles away. Sometimes two mirrors are used and designated sun and moon respectively. Or four are used and designated as the four circumferences, by which is meant the front, rear, left, and right, to which each points when one looks into them. When four mirrors are used, a large number of gods are seen to appear; sometimes pell-mell, other times riding dragons or tigers and wearing hats and clothes of many colors, different from those seen in ordinary life. There are books and illustrations to document all this. (15, tr. Ware 1966: 255-256) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The spirits in old objects are capable of assuming human shape for the purpose of confusing human vision and constantly putting human beings to a test. It is only when reflected in a mirror that they are unable to alter their true forms. Therefore, in the old days, all processors entering the mountains suspended on their backs a mirror measuring nine inches or more in diameter [明鏡徑九寸已上], so that aged demons would not dare approach them. If any did come to test them, they were to turn and look at them in the mirror. If they were genii or good mountain gods, they would look like human beings when viewed in the mirror. If they were birds, animals, or evil demons, their true forms would appear in the mirror. If such a demon comes toward you, you must walk backward, turning your mirror toward it, in order to drive it away. Then observe it. If it is an aged demon it is sure to have no heels. If it has heels, it is a mountain god. (17, tr. Ware 1966: 281) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The preservation of Mystery-Unity [玄一] consists in imagining yourself as being divided into three persons. Once these three have become visible, you can continue to increase the number to several dozen, all like yourself, who may be concealed or revealed, and all of whom are automatically in possession of secret oral directions. This may be termed a process for multiplying the body. Through this method [Zuo Cu], [Ji Liao], and my uncle [Ge Xuan] could be in several dozen places at one time. When guests were present they could be one host speaking the guests in the house, another host greeting guests beside the stream, and still another host making cases with his fishing line, but the guests were unable to distinguish which was he true one. My teacher used to say that to preserve Unity was to practice jointly Bright Mirror [守一兼修明鏡], and that on becoming successful in the mirror procedure a man would be able to multiply his body to several dozen all with the same dress and facial expression. (18, tr. Ware 1966: 306) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Bencao gangmu===
[[Li Shizhen]]'s (1578) ''[[Bencao Gangmu]]'' classic pharmacopeia mentions both burning-mirrors and dew-mirrors.

''Yangsui'' "burning-mirror" occurs with ''huǒzhū'' 火珠 (lit. "fire pearl/bead") "burning-lens" in the entry for ''àihuǒ'' 艾火 "igniting [[mugwort]] for [[moxibustion]]".
&lt;blockquote&gt;The fire used in cauterizing with mugwort ought to be fire really obtained from the sun by means of a sun-mirror [艾火] or fire-pearl (lens?) [火珠] exposed to the sun. Next in efficacy is fire obtained by boring into [''huái'' 槐 "locust tree"] wood, and only in cases of emergency, or when it is difficult to procure such fire, it may be taken from a lamp of pure hempseed oil, or from a wax taper. (火1, tr. Groot 1910 6:947) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Li Shizhen explains (tr. Forke 1911: 497), "[The ''yangsui''] is a fire mirror made of cast copper. Its face is concave. Rubbing it warm and holding it towards the sun, one obtains fire by bringing some artemisia near it. This is what the [''ZhouIi''] says about the comptroller of light receiving the brilliant light from the sun by his fire speculum."

The ''huozhu'' "fire pearl" burning-lens was introduced into China during the [[Tang dynasty]] (Schafer 1963: 237). The (945) ''[[Old Book of Tang]]'' records that in 630, envoys from [[Chams]] presented [[Emperor Taizong of Tang]] (r. 626-649) with a crystalline ''huǒzhū'' 火珠 (lit. "fire pearl/bead") "fire orb; [[burning glass]]", the size of a hen's egg, that would concentrate the sun's rays and ignite a piece of punk. The envoys said they obtained this [[Imperial Chinese tributary system|tribute gift]] in the country of the ''Luóchà'' 羅剎 "[[rakshasa]] creatures in [[Hindu mythology]]", probably imported into [[India]] from the [[Hellenistic]] Near East (Schafer 1963: 237). Needham and Wang (1962: 115) say ''Luocha'' "the country of the Rakshas", is not [[Sri Lanka]], but rather [[Pahang]], [[Malaysia]]. The (1060) ''[[New Book of Tang]]'' account says the year was 631 and the fire-orb came from [[Bali]]. The American sinologist [[Edward H. Schafer]] (1963: 237, 239) notes that the Chinese ''huozhu'' name reflects the [[Sanskrit]] ''agnimaṇi'' "fire jewel" name for burning-glasses, and later Tang dynasty sources use hybrid names like ''yangsuizhu'' "Solar-Kindling Pearl", showing that the crystal fire-orb was regarded as the legitimate successor of the ancient bronze burning-bowl.

''Fangzhu'' occurs in the ''Bencao Gangmu'' entry  for ''míngshuǐ'' 明水 "bright water" used in rituals (水1 天水類, tr. Forke 1911: 497-498), which is explained as ''fangzhu shui'' 方諸水 "dew-mirror water". [Chen Cangqi 陳藏器] says that it is a ''dabang'' 大蚌 "big oyster[-shell]" that, "when rubbed and held up towards the moon, draws some drops of water from it, resembling dew in the morning". [Other authors say] ''fang'' 方 means ''shi'' 石 "stone", or "a mixture of five stones", and ''zhu'' 諸 means ''zhū'' 珠 "pearl; bead". [Li Shizhen] "rejects all these explanations contending that the [''fangzhu''] was a mirror like the burning speculum, and similarly manufactured. This view is supported by the above quoted passage of the [''Zhouli''], which expressly speaks of a mirror employed to obtain water from the moon. This very pure water was perhaps used at sacrifices."

==Speculum metallurgy==
[[File:CMOC Treasures of Ancient China exhibit - bronze mirror.jpg|thumb|A ''Jiàn'' 鑒 bronze mirror from the [[Warring States period]] (475 - 221 BCE)]]
[[Bronze mirrors]] have special significance within the [[history of metallurgy in China]]. In the [[archaeology of China]], copper and bronze mirrors first appeared in the (pre-16th century BCE) "early metalwork" period before the [[Shang dynasty]]. Developments of metal plaques and mirrors appear to have been faster in the Northwestern Region where there was more frequent use of metals in the social life. In particular, the (c. 2050-1915 BCE) [[Qijia culture]], mainly in [[Gansu]] and eastern [[Qinghai]], has provided rich finds of copper mirrors (Bai 2013: 157, 164). Archeological evidence shows that ''yangsui'' burning-mirrors were "clearly one of the earliest uses to which mirrors were put, and the art of producing them was doubtless well known in the [Zhou dynasty]" (Todd and Rupert 1935: 14). Chemical analyses of [[Bronze Age#China|Chinese Bronze Age]] mirrors reveal that early technicians produced sophisticated [[speculum metal]], a white, silvery smooth, high-tin bronze alloy that provides extremely reflective surfaces, used for mirrors and reflecting telescopes (Needham and Lu 1974: 198). Among [[Chinese ritual bronzes]], the most common mirror was ''jiàn'' [[wikt:鑒|鑒]] "mirror", which anciently referred to either a circular mirror, often with intricate ornamentation on the back, or a tall, broad dish for water.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The ''[[Kaogongji]]'' "Record Examining Crafts" section of the ''Zhouli'' (above) lists six official standards for ''tóngxī'' 銅錫 copper-tin (Cu-Sn) bronze alloys to produce different implements; from the least tin (1 part per 5 parts copper) for "bells and sacrificial urns" to the most (1 part tin per 1 part copper) for "metallic mirrors", namely, the ''jiànsuì'' 鑒燧 "mirror-igniter" alloy (Hirth 1907: 217-218). However, these ratios are based on [[Numerology#Chinese numerology|Chinese numerology]] instead of practical metallurgy. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Beyond about 32% the alloy becomes excessively brittle, and increasing tin content brings no further advantages of any kind; this the Han metallurgists evidently knew. Indeed they knew much more, for they almost always added up to 9% of lead, a constituent which greatly improved the casting properties. Han specular metal is truly white, reflects without tinning or silvering, resists scratching and corrosion well, and was admirably adapted for the purposes of its makers. (Needham and Wang 1962: 89) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Besides the ''Kaogongji'' half-copper and half-tin formula, other Chinese texts describe the ''yangsui'' and ''fangzhu'' speculum alloy as ''jīnxī'' 金錫 "gold and tin" or  ''qīngtóngxī'' 青銅錫 "bronze and tin" (Forke 1911: 497).

Unless a mirror surface is truly smooth, image quality falls off rapidly with distance. Chinese bronze mirrors included both smooth [[plane mirror]]s and precisely [[curved mirrors]] of bright finish and high reflectivity. Needham and Wang (1962: 91) say, "That high-tin bronze (specular metal) was used from [Zhou] times onward is certain, and that it was sometimes coated with a layer of tin by heating above 2300°C. is highly probable; this would give at least 80% reflectivity." Later the tin was deposited by means of a mercury [[Amalgam (chemistry)|amalgam]], as recorded in the ''Baopuzi'' (4,  above).

Fu Ju Xiansheng 負局先生 "Master Box-on-his-Back" was the Daoist patron saint of mirror-polishers. The (c. 4th century CE) ''[[Liexian Zhuan]]'' (tr. Giles 1948: 50-51) says Fu Chu "always carried on his back a box of implements for polishing mirrors, and used to frequent the market-towns of Wu in order to exhibit his skill in this work. He charged one cash for polishing a mirror. Having inquired of his host if there were any sick persons in the place, he would produce a drug made up into purple pills and administer these. Those who took them invariably recovered."

The casting of Chinese sun-mirrors and moon-mirrors ideally followed the principles of [[Chinese astrology]], ''yinyang'', and ''[[Wu xing|wuxing]]''. The ''Lunheng'' (above) says ''yangsui'' and ''fangzhu'' mirrors should be smelted from five minerals when a ''bingwu'' (43rd of 60-day cycle) day occurs in the 5th lunar month. The (4th century) ''[[Soushenji]]'' explains, "The fire mirror must be cast in the 5th month on a [''bingwu''] day at noon, the moon mirror in the eleventh month on a [''renzi''] day at midnight." These times, the middle of summer and of winter are in harmony with the theory of the Five Elements (Forke 1911: 497). Many early bronze mirrors have inscriptions mentioning the ''bingwu'' day, which was considered auspicious for casting operations since the cyclical ''bing'' was associated with the west and metal, while ''wu'' was associated with the south and fire; correspondingly, the moon-mirrors were cast on ''renzi'' days in the twelfth month, and these cyclical signs are associated with the complementary elements of water and wood (Needham and Wang 1962: 113).

==Cross-cultural parallels==
[[File:Burning mirrors, from Kircher. Wellcome L0016024.jpg|thumb|Burning mirrors, [[Athanasius Kircher]]'s (1646) ''Ars magna lucis et umbrae'']]
The Chinese use of burning-mirrors has parallels in other civilizations, especially to produce ritual "pure fire", used as the source for lighting other fires.

Burning-mirrors were known to the Greeks and Romans. [[Archimedes]] supposedly set fire to the [[Roman Navy|Roman fleet]] with burning-mirrors in 212 BCE, when [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] was besieged by [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus]] (Simms 1977). [[Plutarch]]'s (c. 1st century CE) ''[[Parallel Lives]]'' account of [[Numa Pompilius]] (r. 715-673 BCE) records the [[Vestal Virgins]] using burning-mirrors to light the [[sacred fire of Vesta]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;If it (the fire) happens by any accident to be put out, … it is not to be lighted again from another fire, but new fire is to be gained by drawing a pure and unpolluted flame from the sunbeams. They kindle it generally with concave vessels of brass, formed by hollowing out an isosceles rectangular triangle, whose lines from the circumference meet in one single point. This being placed against the sun, causes its rays to converge in the centre, which, by reflection, acquiring the force and activity of fire, rarefy the air, and immediately kindle such light and dry matter as they think fit to apply. (tr. Langhorne 1821 1: 195) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The striking contemporaneity of the first burning-mirror references in Chinese and European literature, probably indicates the spread in both directions of a technique originally Mesopotamian or Egyptian (Needham and Wang 1962: 88).

In ancient India, the physician [[Vagbhata]]'s ''Ashtānga hridayasamhitā'' mentions using burning-mirrors twice, to grind certain drugs on it, and to cauterize a rat bite wound (Laufer 1915: 220).

[[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak]]'s history of the Mughal emperor [[Akbar]] (r. 1556-1605) records a pair of sacred sun and moon stones: Hindi ''sūryakānta'' "a crystal [[burning lens]] used to light the sacred fire" and ''chandrakānta'' (Sanskrit ''candrakānta'' "beloved by the moon") "a [[Moonstone (gemstone)|moonstone]] that drips water when exposed to moonlight".
&lt;blockquote&gt;At noon of the day, when the sun enters the nineteenth degree of Aries, the whole world being then surrounded by its light, they expose to the rays of the sun a round piece of a white and shining stone, called in Hindi ''sūryakānta''. A piece of cotton is then held near it, which catches fire from the heat of the stone. This celestial fire is committed to the care of proper persons. …There is also a shining white stone, called ''chandrakānt'', which, upon being exposed to the beams of the moon, drips water. (Laufer 1915: 221-222). &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Owing to the similarities of Chinese ''yangsui'' and ''fangzhu'' mirrors with Indian ''sūryakānta'' and ''candrakānta'' stones, Tang (1935) proposes a [[trans-cultural diffusion]] from China to the [[Mughal Empire]].

'''''Christian Morals'''''  is a prose work written by the physician [[Sir Thomas Browne]] as advice for his eldest children. It was published posthumously in 1716 and consists, as its title implies, of meditations upon [[Christian]] values and conduct. 

The work is divided into three sections with many of the numbered  paragraphs standing-alone as text, with unique and startling imagery involving optics, perspective and appearance. A work of a lifetime's study and understanding of the human condition, in psychological terms, Browne's last major work may be considered as advice on obtaining individuation and self-realization as much as Christian virtue.

Stylistically, it displays some of the best and worst excesses of Browne's at times labyrinthine and meandering baroque style, often involving [[Parallelism (grammar)|parallelism]]s in its sentence construction.  

''Christian Morals'' was edited by [[Samuel Johnson]] in 1756; Johnson prefaced his edition with a biography of Browne. His latter prose imitated aspects of Browne's late prose-style.

The '''cigar box guitar''' is a simple [[chordophone]] that uses an empty [[cigar box]] as a [[resonator]]. The earliest had one or two strings; modern models typically have three or more. Generally, the strings are connected to the end of a broomstick or a 1 x 3 inch wood slate and to the cigar box resonator.

== History ==
Cigars were packed in boxes, crates, and barrels as early as 1800, but the small boxes that we are familiar with today did not exist prior to around 1840.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hyman |first=Tony |title= Handbook of Cigar Boxes |year=1972 |publisher= Arnot Art Museum |location= New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until then, cigars were shipped in larger crates containing 100 or more per case. After 1840, cigar manufacturers started using smaller, more portable boxes with 20–50 cigars per box.

Trace evidence of cigar box instruments exists from 1840 to the 1860s.&lt;ref name="Jehle 2010"&gt;{{cite book |last= Jehle |first= William |title= One Man's Trash: A History of the Cigar Box Guitar |year= 2010 |isbn= 1-4538-0239-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known illustration of a cigar box instrument is an etching copyrighted in 1876 of two [[American Civil War]] soldiers at a campsite, one of whom is playing a cigar box [[fiddle]]. The etching was created by illustrator and artist Edwin Forbes, who, under the banner of ''[[Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper]]'', worked for the [[Union Army]]. The etching was included in Forbes's work ''[[Life Stories of the Great Army]]''. In the etching, the fiddle clearly shows the brand "Figaro" on the cigar box.

In addition to the etching, plans for a cigar box [[banjo]] were published by [[Daniel Carter Beard]], co-founder of the [[Boy Scouts of America]], in 1884 as part of ''Christmas Eve with Uncle Enos''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cigarboxguitar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/UncleEnos.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The plans, retitled "How to Build an Uncle Enos Banjo", were included in the 1890 edition of Beard's ''[[American Boy's Handy Book]]'' as supplementary material at the back of the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Beard |first= Daniel Carter |title= The American Boy's Handy Book |year= 1882 |publisher= Scribner |location= New York |isbn= 0-87923-449-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; These plans omitted the story but still showed a step-by-step description of a playable five-string fretless banjo made from a cigar box.

It would seem that the earliest cigar box instruments would be crude and primitive, but this is not always the case. According to William Jehle, curator of The Cigar Box Guitar Museum and the author of ''[[One Man's Trash: A History of the Cigar Box Guitar]]'',&lt;ref name="Jehle 2010"/&gt; the museum acquired two cigar box fiddles built in 1886 and 1889 that seem very playable and well built. The 1886 fiddle was made for an 8-year-old boy and is certainly playable, but the 1889 fiddle has a well-carved neck and slotted violin headstock. The latter instrument was made for serious playing.

Cigar box guitars and fiddles were also important in the rise of [[jug band]]s and [[blues]]. As most of these performers were black Americans living in poverty, many could not afford a "real" instrument. Using these, along with the [[washtub bass]] (similar to the cigar box guitar), jug, [[washboard (musical instrument)|washboard]], and harmonica, black musicians performed blues during socializations.

[[The Great Depression]] of the 1930s saw a resurgence of homemade [[musical instrument]]s. Times were hard in the American South, and sitting on the front porch singing away the blues was a popular pastime. Musical instruments were beyond the means of most people, but with an old cigar box, a piece of broom handle and a couple of wires from the screen door, a guitar was born.

== Modern revival ==
[[File:Cigar box instruments.jpg|thumb|Cigar box guitars at [[Maker Faire]] 2011]]
A modern revival of these instruments (also known as the Cigar Box Guitar Revolution) has been gathering momentum with an increase in the number of cigar box guitar builders and performers. A loose-knit group of underground musicians tour the East Coast of the United States each summer under the banner "Masters of the Cigar Box Guitar Tour." These musicians include Doctor Oakroot, Johnny Lowebow, Tomi-O and many others. A growing number of primitive [[luthier]]s are adding cigar box guitars to their items for sale. The Top cigar box guitar builders of today are [[Shane Speal]], [[Mike Snowden]] and Peter Lake of [[Heavy Fog Guitars]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://theovercast.ca/heavy-fog-guitars-rising-from-an-empty-box/], The Overcast.&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern revival is sometimes due to interest in jug bands and the [[DIY culture]], as a cigar box is inexpensive in comparison with other factors, such as strings and construction time. Many modern cigar box guitar makers can be seen as practitioners of a type of [[Luthier|lutherie]] and implement various personal touches, such as the addition of [[Pick up (music technology)|pickups]] and resonator cones.

The modern revival of cigar box guitars is documented in the 2008 film "Songs Inside the Box", which was shot primarily at the Cigar Box Guitar Extravaganza, an annual event held in Huntsville, Alabama.

The Cigar Box Guitar Museum, a free display dedicated to cigar box guitars, is located in Speal's Tavern, a small blues club in New Alexandria, Pennsylvania. It is curated by cigar box guitarist Shane Speal and contains over 60 antique and modern cigar box guitars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spealstavern.com/cigar-box-guitar-museum],&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''clothing swap''' is a type of [[swapmeet]] wherein participants exchange their valued but no longer used [[clothing]] for clothing they will use. Clothing swaps are considered not only a good way to refill one's wardrobe, but also are considered an act of environmentalism.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.onegreenplanet.org/lifestyle/how-clothing-swaps-could-help-save-the-world/&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used to get rid of and obtain specialist clothing. Cloth swap can be specialized - they can cater for example for clothes swaps only for high end brands.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.stylewe.com/category/sweater-dresses-59_230&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

The notion of swapping is not a new concept; however, many groups and organizations exist that hold clothing swaps, in a variety of sizes, to raise money and clothes for charitable donations.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/sep/15/how-to-set-up-clothes-swap-in-your-area&lt;/ref&gt;

Clothes swaps originated in San Francisco California with events hosted by Suzanne Agasi in the late nineties.&lt;ref&gt;http://business.time.com/2009/09/22/qa-with-clothing-swap-founder-suzanne-agasi/&lt;/ref&gt;

Online clothes swapping has also become popular, with websites offering an environmentally friendly and frugal alternative to shopping or second-hand shops.

In [[metaphysics]], '''conceptualism''' is a theory that explains universality of [[particular]]s as conceptualized frameworks situated within the thinking mind.&lt;ref name="Conceptualism" /&gt; Intermediate between [[nominalism]] and [[Philosophical realism|realism]], the conceptualist view approaches the metaphysical concept of [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]] from a perspective that denies their presence in particulars outside the mind's perception of them.&lt;ref name="universals" /&gt; Conceptualism is [[anti-realist]] about [[abstract objects]], just like [[immanent realism]] is (their difference being that immanent realism does not deny the mind-independence of universals, like conceptualism does).&lt;ref&gt;Neil A. Manson, Robert W. Barnard (eds.), ''The Bloomsbury Companion to Metaphysics'', Bloomsbury, 2014, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Medieval philosophy ===
The evolution of late [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] terminology has led to the emergence of conceptualism, which stemmed from doctrines that were previously considered to be nominalistic. The terminological distinction was made in order to stress the difference between the claim that universal mental acts correspond with universal intentional objects and the perspective that dismissed the existence of universals outside the mind. The former perspective of rejection of objective [[Universality (philosophy)|universality]] was distinctly defined as conceptualism.

[[Peter Abélard]] was a medieval thinker whose work is currently classified as having the most potential in representing the roots of conceptualism. Abélard’s view denied the existence of determinate universals within things.&lt;ref name="Abailard" /&gt; [[William of Ockham]] was another famous late medieval thinker who had a strictly conceptualist solution to the metaphysical problem of universals. He argued that abstract concepts have no ''[[wikt:fundamentum|fundamentum]]'' outside the mind.&lt;ref name="Ockham" /&gt;

In the 17th century conceptualism gained favour for some decades especially among the [[Jesuit]]s: [[Hurtado de Mendoza (philosopher)|Hurtado de Mendoza]], [[Rodrigo de Arriaga]] and [[Francisco Oviedo (philosopher)|Francisco Oviedo]] are the main figures. Although the order soon returned to the more realist philosophy of [[Francisco Suárez]], the ideas of these Jesuits had a great impact on the [[early modern philosophy]].

=== Modern philosophy ===
Conceptualism was either explicitly or implicitly embraced by most of the [[Early modern philosophy|early modern]] thinkers, including [[René Descartes]], [[John Locke]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], [[George Berkeley]], and [[David Hume]] – often in a quite simplified form if compared with the elaborate scholastic theories.&lt;ref&gt;David Bostock, ''Philosophy of Mathematics: An Introduction'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2009, p. 43: "All of Descartes, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume supposed that mathematics is a theory of our ''ideas'', but none of them offered any argument for this conceptualist claim, and apparently took it to be uncontroversial."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Di Bella, Tad M. Schmaltz (eds.), ''The Problem of Universals in Early Modern Philosophy'', Oxford University Press, 2017, p. 64 "there is a strong case to be made that Spinoza was a ''conceptualist'' about universals" and p. 207 n. 25: "Leibniz's conceptualism [is related to] the Ockhamist tradition..."&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the term is applied even to the radically different philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]], who holds that universals have no connection with external things because they are exclusively produced by our ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' mental structures and functions.&lt;ref name="Kant" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oberst, Michael. 2015. "Kant on Universals." ''History of Philosophy Quarterly'' '''32'''(4):335–352.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[late modern philosophy]], conceptualist views were held by [[G. W. F. Hegel]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Sarlemijn, ''Hegel's Dialectic'', Springer, 1975, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contemporary philosophy&lt;!--'Conceptualist realism', 'Perceptual conceptualism', 'Perceptual non-conceptualism', 'Perceptual nonconceptualism', and 'Nonconceptual mental content' redirect here; linked from 'John McDowell--&gt; ===
[[Edmund Husserl]]'s [[philosophy of mathematics]] has been construed as a form of conceptualism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author=Zahar, Elie| year=2001| title=Poincaré's Philosophy: From Conventionalism to Phenomenology| publisher=Open Court Pub Co| location=Chicago| page=211| isbn=0-8126-9435-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Conceptualist realism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (a view put forward by [[David Wiggins]] in 1980) states that our conceptual framework maps reality.&lt;ref&gt;A. M. Ferner, ''Organisms and Personal Identity: Individuation and the Work of David Wiggins'', Routledge, 2016, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though separate from the historical debate regarding the status of universals, there has been significant debate regarding the conceptual character of experience since the release of ''Mind and World'' by [[John McDowell]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mind and World |last1=McDowell |first1=John |year=1994 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-674-57610-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; McDowell's touchstone is the famous refutation that [[Wilfrid Sellars]] provided for what he called the "[[Myth of the Given]]"—the notion that all empirical knowledge is based on certain assumed or 'given' items, such as sense data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sellars/ | title = Wilfrid Sellars | accessdate = 2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in rejecting the Myth of the Given, McDowell argues for '''perceptual conceptualism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, according to which perceptual content is conceptual "from the ground up", that is, all perceptual experience is a form of conceptual experience. McDowell's [[philosophy of justification]] is considered a form of [[foundationalism]]: it is a form of foundationalism because it allows that certain judgements are warranted by experience and it is a coherent form of this view because it maintains that experience can warrant certain judgements because experience is irreducibly conceptual.&lt;ref&gt;John McDowell, ''Mind and World''. Harvard University Press, 1994, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gibson&gt;Roger F. Gibson, "McDowell's Direct Realism and Platonic Naturalism", ''Philosophical Issues'' Vol. 7, ''Perception'' (1996), pp. 275–281.&lt;/ref&gt;

A clear motivation of contemporary conceptualism is that the kind of perception that rational creatures like humans enjoy is unique in the fact that it has conceptual character. McDowell explains his position:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have urged that our perceptual relation to the world is conceptual all the way out to the world’s impacts on our receptive capacities. The idea of the conceptual that I mean to be invoking is to be understood in close connection with the idea of rationality, in the sense that is in play in the traditional separation of mature human beings, as rational animals, from the rest of the animal kingdom. Conceptual capacities are capacities that belong to their subject’s rationality. So another way of putting my claim is to say that our perceptual experience is permeated with rationality. I have also suggested, in passing, that something parallel should be said about our agency.&lt;ref name=McDowellPaper&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = McDowell | first1 = J. | title = What Myth? | doi = 10.1080/00201740701489211 | journal = Inquiry | volume = 50 | issue = 4 | pages = 338–351 | year = 2007 | pmid = | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

McDowell's conceptualism, though rather distinct (philosophically and historically) from conceptualism's genesis, shares the view that universals are not "given" in perception from outside the sphere of reason. Particular objects are perceived, as it were, already infused with conceptuality stemming from the spontaneity of the rational subject herself.

The application of the term "perceptual conceptualism" to Kant's [[philosophy of perception]] is debatable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-judgment/supplement1.html "The Togetherness Principle, Kant’s Conceptualism, and Kant’s Non-Conceptualism" – Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars have argued for a rival interpretation of Kant's work termed '''perceptual non-conceptualism'''.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hanna, "Kantian non-conceptualism", ''Philosophical Studies'' '''137'''(1):41–64 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eco-labels''' and '''Green Stickers''' are labeling systems for food and consumer products.  Ecolabels are voluntary, but green stickers are mandated by law; for example, in North America major appliances and automobiles use [[Energy Star]]. They are a form of [[sustainability measurement]] directed at consumers, intended to make it easy to take environmental concerns into account when shopping. Some labels quantify pollution or energy consumption by way of index scores or units of measurement, while others assert compliance with a set of practices or minimum requirements for [[sustainability]] or reduction of harm to the environment. Many ecolabels are focused on minimising the negative [[Human impact on the environment|ecological impact]]s of [[primary production]] or [[resource extraction]] in a given sector or commodity through a set of good practices that are captured in a sustainability standard. Through a verification process, usually referred to as "certification", a farm, forest, [[fishery]], or mine can show that it complies with a standard and earn the right to sell its products as certified through the supply chain, often resulting in a consumer-facing ecolabel.

The last few years have seen two key trends in the ecolabels space. There is an explosion in the numbers of different ecolabelling programs across the world and across business sectors and secondly the proliferation of umbrella labeling programs.

Ecolabelling systems exist for both food and consumer products. Both systems were started by [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s, since then the [[European Union]] have developed [[legislation]] for conduct of ecolabelling and also have created their own ecolabels, one for food and one for consumer products. At least for food, the ecolabel is nearly identical with the common NGO definition of the rules for ecolabelling. Label trust is an issue for consumers because as manufacturers and manufacturing associations have set up "rubber stamp" labels to [[greenwash]] their products with fake ecolabels. High trust levels can be created when ecolabels apply for Governmental recognition as formal Certification Marks [recognized by logos or names with 'CTM', CM or 'CertTM']. Typically this means schemes approved as a Certification Mark, have had the Government Department responsible declare that the scheme has a standard and certifies that they are 'Competent to Certify'. The highest trust levels would be a government recognized certification mark that was also compliant with key ISO standards especially ISO 14024- Type 1 Ecolabels that undertake ISO 14040 compliant life cycle analysis as part of their assessment.Type I ecolabels are voluntary labels that signify overall environmental preference of a product or services based on life-cycle considerations that address multiple environmental criteria, which are based on transparent standards for environmental preferability, verified by a qualified organization. 

==ISO Participation==
The last few years have seen two key trends in the ecolabels space. There is an explosion in the numbers of different ecolabelling programs across the world and across business sectors and secondly the proliferation of umbrella labeling programs. The International Organization for Standardization [[ISO]] has created standards for labeling practices within the [[ISO 14000]] schema. '''ISO 14020 to 14025''' series deals with environmental labels and declarations. ISO proposed three categories of environmental labels according to the aspects covered and the rigor required to award the seal: type I in ISO 14024; type II in ISO 14021; and type III in ISO 14025. Additionally, a different category called “Type I – like” is present in the literature, which represents environmental labels focused on just one environmental or social aspect; these labels have been launched by independent organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095965261630854X|title=ECO-labels as a multidimensional research topic: Trends and opportunities|author=|date=1 November 2016|publisher=|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|volume=135|pages=806–818|accessdate=14 April 2018|via=www.sciencedirect.com|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.06.167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecolabeling innovation cycle ==
There is a close relationship between the ecolabeling process and the eco-innovation because it promotes the emergence of new green products and it improves the organizations environmental management strategy. Moreover, ecolabeling process is a "cyclical eco-innovation process in which consumers, firms, governments and institutions interact. Its final purpose is to contribute to the development of sustainable and ecological ways of production and consumption. In this process, consumers’ environmental expectations are met; firms increase their created and captured value and enhance their sustainability, and governments and institutions foster cleaner production and consumption. Finally, this process is tangible in the products through the awarding of ecolabels, which are visibly displayed on goods and services".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prieto-Sandoval|first=Vanessa|last2=Alfaro|first2=José A.|last3=Mejía-Villa|first3=Andrés|last4=Ormazabal|first4=Marta|date=2016-11-01|title=ECO-labels as a multidimensional research topic: Trends and opportunities|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095965261630854X|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|volume=135|pages=806–818|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.06.167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental governance==
Consumer desires for [[sustainable consumption]] is driving the global marketplace with desire to regulate product production. The globalization of economies is shifting control of sustainability away from traditional command and control measures imposed by governments towards market governance which is a self-regulatory new environmental policy instrument, ecolabelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jordan|first=A|title=In politics, products, and markets: exploring political consumption|year=2003|publisher=Transaction Publishers|location=Somerest, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horne,|first=R. E.|title=Limits to labels: The role of ecolabels in the assessment of product sustainability and routes to sustainable consumption|journal=International Journal of Consumer Studies|year=2009|volume=33|pages=175–182.|doi=10.1111/j.1470-6431.2009.00752.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only ecolabel that takes into consideration legal and infrastructural limitations is
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecoverified.com|title=Ecoverified.com Is For Sale|author=|date=|website=www.ecoverified.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a startup in Greece approved by the University of Wales and which has the Support of the Dutch Embassy and the Orange Grove.
It is a certification programme with the intention to increase owner, staff, suppliers and stakeholder’s awareness with the intention to motivate them for an eco-friendly action towards a sustainable holiday and future for all of us in the long run and through which expenses can be minimized.

Eco-labeling standardization is a new form of regulation which is voluntary in nature but impose upon large companies market forces in order to harmonize production of goods and services with stronger ecological practices. Recently, it has turned into a new form of non-state authority at both national and international levels. This idea of '''entrepreneurial democracy'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lavallee|first=S.|author2=Plouffe S.|title=The eco-label and sustainable development|journal=The International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment|volume=9|issue=6|pages=349–354|doi=10.1007/bf02979076}}&lt;/ref&gt;  based on the success of the ISO 14000 standards on the management of environmental quality and the ISO 9000 standards on quality production control.
Once an industry sector decides to get this certification, it has to provide evidence of documented proof of compliance required. In terms of ISO 14042 standard, it is obligatorily for all applicants to respect environmental legislation and related legislation; breaching of any laws may result in licensing suspension.

===Sustainable Initiatives===
During the [[United Nations|UN]] [[Earth Summit]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/geninfo/bp/enviro.html|title=Earth_Summit|author=|date=|website=www.un.org|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conference in 1992, an international consensus was generated to integrate environmental issues into manufacturing procedures. The idea was to manipulate consumption patterns in order to achieve [[sustainable development]]. The result of this is as follows.

'''Currently in the''' [[Developed country|developed world]]: Eco-labels and green stickers have evolved to play a vital role. They provide a verifiable link between products and [[informed consumer]] wishes. This approach applies market pressure on industries to minimize their environmental impact; this is evidenced by the growth in the population of [[informed consumer]]s. Marketing strategists are responding with Green Certifications and its abuse, [[Greenwashing]].

'''Currently in the''' [[Developing country|developing world]]: First consumers became concerned about the quality, safety and environmental sustainability of food and supported demand for green foods, then focused on the environmental effects of agriculture and globalization of food production, which led to the exposure of globally controlled food regimes. Consumer advocate groups responded with a call for [Alternative Food Networks].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=K. |author2=Lawrence G. |author3=Richards C|title=Supermarkets’ governance of the agri-food supply chain: is the ‘corporate-environmental’ food regime evident in Australia|journal=International Journal of Society of Agriculture and Food|year=2010|volume=17|issue=2|pages=140–161}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gives a new dimension to consumer demands and corporate competitiveness. Australian Consumer Association [[Choice (Australian consumer organization)|CHOICE]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.choice.com.au/about-us.aspx|title=About us - CHOICE|author=|date=|website=CHOICE|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; confronted corporate interests with their concerns about growing interests in green consumption, food production, use of pesticides, organic production, and genetic modification, etc...

==History==
[[File:GreenStickerC.JPG|right|150px|Proposed International Green Sticker.]]
'''Green Stickers''' on consumer goods have been evolving since the 1970s. The main drivers have been energy and fuel consumption. These stickers first started appearing on major appliances after government agencies in the United States and Canada legislated their requirement. Manufacturers are also required to meet minimum standards of energy use. The automobile industry in North America is required to meet a minimum emissions standard. This led to [[fuel efficiency]] labels being placed on new automobiles sold. The major appliance manufacturers were required to use standard testing practices and place clear labels on products. The [[International Organization for Standardization]] has developed standards for addressing environmental labelling with the [[ISO 14000]] family which grew out of ISO's commitment to support the objective of sustainable development discussed at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, in Rio de Janeiro, in 1992&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/management_standards/iso_9000_iso_14000/origins_and_iso_tc207.htm |title=ISO/TC 207 |publisher=ISO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Green Labelling worldwide is moving beyond traditional country borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eco-business.com/features/singapore-green-label-to-go-regional/|title=Singapore Green Label to go regional |publisher=eco-business.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these initiatives are voluntary Eco-labels, however, there is an initiative underway in North America to broaden the scope of Green Stickers to include other consumer goods. Although consumers tend to prefer ecolabeled products, recent research show that consumers do not fully understand ecolabels and do not fully trust ecolabels, especially when learning negative environmental consequences of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Xianwen|last2=Alfnes|first2=Frode|last3=Rickertsen|first3=Kyrre|date=2017|title=Consumer Preferences, Ecolabels, and Effects of Negative Environmental Information|url=http://www.agbioforum.org/v18n3/v18n3a11-rickertsen.htm|journal=AgBioForum: The Journal of Agrobiotechnology Management &amp; Economics|volume=18|issue=3|pages=327-336|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International Networks==

===GEN===
Founded in 1994, the Global Ecolabelling Network (GEN) is an international non-profit network of third party type I ecolabelling organizations focused on encouraging and promoting type I ecolabelling development worldwide. GEN has members represented from more than 50 territories and countries, with a particular focus in Europe and Asia.
GEN’s mission is to educate and encourage government, industry, and consumers to recognize the unique and important value of Type 1 ecolabelling. More specifically, GEN functions to foster cooperation and information exchange across members and ecolabelling programs, facilities access to information on ecolabelling standards, engages with international organizations to promote ecolabelling, and encourages demand for ecolabelling products through the promotion of sustainable public procurement. GEN supports its members in developing environmental leadership standards and criteria.

===ISEAL===
Created in 2002, the International Social and Environmental Accreditation and Labelling Alliance (ISEAL) is a body of sustainability standard organizations set up to advance and develop sustainability standards for products across the globe. Its membership is open to all multi-stakeholder sustainability standards and accreditation bodies that demonstrate their ability to meet the ISEAL Codes of Good Practice and accompanying requirements. Its members are primarily single attribute focused ecolabelling organizations and include the Forest Stewardship Alliance, the Marine Stewardship Council, Fair Trade International, the Rainforest Alliance, and the Alliance for Water Stewardship, among many others. 

The goals of ISEAL Alliance are to improve the impacts of standards, define credibility for sustainability standards, increase the uptake of credible sustainability standards, and improve the effectiveness of standards, including driving innovations in standards.

==Programs by region==

Governments of many countries have [[Environmental Protection Agency|environmental protection agencies]]. These agencies are mandated watchdogs of industry and regulate releasing chemical pollution into the environment.  Some of them administer labelling standards; other set minimum requirements for manufacturers.

===Canada===
The Office of Energy Efficiency (OEE) run by the Department of Natural Resources Canada regulates both the automobile and appliance manufacturers.
EnerGuide label for vehicles found on all new passenger cars, light-duty vans, pickup trucks and special purpose vehicles not exceeding a gross vehicle weight of 3855&amp;nbsp;kg (8500&amp;nbsp;lb). The label shows the city and highway fuel consumption ratings and an estimated annual fuel cost for that particular vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oee.nrcan.gc.ca/transportation/personal/buying/energuide-label.cfm?attr=8 |title=Fuel consumption guide |publisher=Government of Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Federal law in Canada, under Canada's Energy Efficiency Regulations, requires that the EnerGuide label is placed on all new electrical appliances manufactured in or imported into Canada and that the label indicates the amount of electricity used by that appliance. This information is determined by standardized test procedures. A third-party agency verifies that an appliance meets Canada's minimum energy performance levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oee.nrcan.gc.ca/residential/personal/appliances/energuide.cfm?attr=4 |title=Canada's Energy Efficiency Regulations |publisher=Government of Canada |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225164135/http://www.oee.nrcan.gc.ca/residential/personal/appliances/energuide.cfm?attr=4 |archivedate=2010-12-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
[[File:Energy Star logo.svg|thumb|150px|right|The Energy Star service mark is placed on energy-efficient products.]]

All major home appliances must meet the Appliance Standards Program set by the US Department of Energy (DOE) on cooperation with the US Federal Trade Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/homes/rea07.shtm |title=U.S. Department of Energy, Home Appliance Regulation|publisher=Federal Trade Commission USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manufacturers must use standard test procedures developed by DOE to prove the energy use and efficiency of their products. Test results are printed on yellow EnergyGuide label, which manufacturers are required to display on many appliances. This label estimates how much energy the appliance uses, compares the energy use of similar products, and lists approximate annual operating costs. Appliances that meet strict energy efficiency criteria set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency are eligible for the blue [[Energy Star]] label. The Energy Star label is also available on energy-efficient televisions, computers, audio visual equipment and electronics, office equipment, heating and cooling equipment, and many more products. Energy Star is also available on energy efficient homes and buildings in the United States.  American [[automobile]] manufacturers are required to use certified [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] test results and cannot use any other fuel mileage results to advertise vehicle fuel efficiency. The state of California has green sticker license plates issued to [[Off highway vehicle|OHV]]s is introducing green stickers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://driveclean.ca.gov/ep_label.php |title=California Air Resources Board, DRIVECLEAN.ca.gov |publisher=California Air Resources Board USA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813082827/http://www.driveclean.ca.gov/ep_label.php |archivedate=2009-08-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for all new automobiles in 2009. The Australian based US registered Certification Mark Global GreenTag, also operates its service in the USA since 2018.

===European Union===
The [[EU Ecolabel]] was established in 1992 by the European Commission. The EU Ecolabel helps to identify products and services that have a reduced environmental impact throughout their life cycle. Recognized throughout Europe, EU Ecolabel is a voluntary label promoting environmental excellence which can be trusted. It is the only pan-European Type I official ecolabel. The EU Ecolabel is awarded according to ecological criteria agreed on by experts, industry, [[consumer organization]]s and [[environmental group|NGO]]s and verified by independent third parties. The implementation of the EU Ecolabel is set through the Regulation (EC) No 66/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council.

===Northern Europe===
The [[Nordic swan]] is the official ecolabel in Nordic countries.  It uses a system of standards, applications for licenses, and independent verification.

===ASEAN===
In Asia [[ASEAN]] is moving towards adopting the ISO's TC 207 environmental management system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asean.org/7112.htm |title=ASEAN report on environmental labelling |publisher=ASEAN |accessdate=2009-02-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306044647/http://www.asean.org/7112.htm |archivedate=2012-03-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anyone can contribute verifiable sources substantiating its adoption and implementation by member countries as this information is not easily accessible. The Australian Certification Mark Global GreenTag, is also formally recognised in several ASEAN countries.

===Australia===
A number of ecolabels operate in Australia and New Zealand mostly as separate schemes operating in one country only. Global GreenTag operates internationally and is recognized in both countries as is GECA whereas GECNZ operates only within NZ. All 3 ecolabels are ISO 14024 compliant. GreenTag is also an Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) approved Certification Mark.

==Seafood==
There are a plethora of sustainable seafood ecolabels, many conservationists feel that the increasing number of labels is further confusing consumers in regard to what seafood is sustainable. As of 2010, ecolabels that can be found on seafood include Marine Stewardship Council, Friend of the Sea, [[KRAV (Sweden)]], [[Naturland (Germany)]], Thai Quality Shrimp, Global Aquaculture Alliance's [[Best Aquaculture Practices]] standard, Label Rouge (France), among still others, and the Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC) is in development. Seafood is also labeled "organic" but [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] standards for organic seafood are still in development.

There are a variety of [[dolphin safe label]]s, asserting that tuna is caught in a manner that does not harm [[dolphin]]s.

==Energy==
[[File:EKO symbol RGB.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[EKOenergy]] ecolabel for energy]]
{{Main article|Energy input labeling}}
Many consumer appliances have labels indicating whether or not they are energy efficient compared to similar products.  Common labels include yellow EnergyGuide tags found in North America as part of the [[Energy Star]] program, [[European Union energy label]]s, and the [[Energy Saving Trust Recommended]] logo&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070421100110/http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/energy_saving_products|title=Energy Saving Products - Energy Saving Trust|author=|date=21 April 2007|website=archive.org|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; administrated by the [[Energy Saving Trust]] in the United Kingdom.  These labels document how much energy an appliance consumes while being used; [[energy input labeling]] documents how much energy was used to ''manufacture'' the product, an additional consideration in the full life cycle energy use of product.

[[Carbon emission label]]s are an alternative methodology for certification, examining impact on [[greenhouse gas]] emissions rather than direct energy use.

'''Effective Altruism Global''', abbreviated EA Global, is a series of [[philanthropy]] conferences that focuses on the [[effective altruism]] movement.&lt;ref name="cea1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Centre for Effective Altruism Announces Lineup for Effective Altruism Global 2015|url=http://www.pitchengine.com/pitches/00ffe1e9-9189-4dc8-9e7a-5595fb90f61b|website=Pitchengine|publisher=Centre for Effective Altruism|accessdate=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conferences are run by the [[Centre for Effective Altruism]] at [[Oxford University]].&lt;ref name="aboutpage"&gt;{{cite web|title=About EA Global|url=http://eaglobal.org/about|website=EA Global|publisher=Centre for Effective Altruism|accessdate=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Huffington Post]] editor [[Nico Pitney]] described the events as a gathering of "nerd altruists", which was "heavy on people from technology, science, and analytical disciplines".&lt;ref name="huffpo2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pitney|first1=Nico|title=Elon Musk To Address ‘Nerd Altruists’ At Google HQ|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/elon-musk-google-effective-altruism_us_55a56626e4b04740a3de3130|accessdate=4 April 2016|publisher=[[Huffington Post]]|date=July 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:AI Existential Risk panel at EA Global.jpg|thumb|Panel with [[Nick Bostrom]], [[Elon Musk]], Nate Soares, and [[Stuart J. Russell|Stuart Russell]] during EA Global 2015]]
An original Effective Altruism Summit was hosted in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exponentialtimes.net/videos/jaan-tallinns-keynote-effective-altruism-summit-2013|title = Jaan Tallinn's Keynote - Effective Altruism Summit 2013 |date = November 13, 2013|accessdate = April 11, 2015|publisher = Exponential Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, there were three main EA Global events. The largest was a three-day conference that took place on the [[Google]] campus in [[Mountain View, California]] with speakers including entrepreneur [[Elon Musk]], computer scientist [[Stuart J. Russell]], and Oxford philosophy professor [[William MacAskill]]. There were also conferences in [[Oxford]], [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]. According to MacAskill, the nature of the conferences improved coordination and ideological diversity within effective altruism. Talks included subjects such as "global poverty, animal advocacy, cause prioritization research, and policy change". There were also workshops on choosing careers, Q&amp;A sessions, and panels on running local EA chapters.&lt;ref name="huffpo1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Guan|first1=Melody Y.|title=Elon Musk, Superintelligence, and Maximizing Social Good: A Weekend at History’s Largest Gathering of "Effective Altruists"|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/melody-y-guan/elon-musk-superintelligen_b_7929960.html|accessdate=4 April 2016|publisher=[[Huffington Post]]|date=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Google conference, a moderated panel featured [[Elon Musk]] with AI researchers on the topic of [[existential risk from artificial general intelligence]].&lt;ref name="inc"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Townsend|first1=Tess|title=Elon Musk: AI Is Going to Happen.

Russell|Stuart Russell]] stated that AI research should be about "building intelligent systems that benefit the human race".&lt;ref name="huffpo1" /&gt; [[Vox (website)|Vox]] writer [[Dylan Matthews]] criticized the event for its perceived focus on [[existential risk]], potentially at the expense of more mainstream causes like fighting [[extreme poverty]].&lt;ref name="matthews"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Matthews|first1=Dylan|title=I spent a weekend at Google talking with nerds about charity.

== Introduction ==
In mathematics, '''equivariant topology''' is the study of [[topological space]]s that possess certain symmetries. In studying topological spaces, one often considers continuous maps &lt;math&gt;f:X \to Y&lt;/math&gt;, and while equivariant topology also considers such maps, there is the additional constraint that each map "respects symmetry" in both its domain and target space.

The notion of symmetry is usually captured by considering a [[Group action]] of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; and demanding that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is [[Equivariant map|equivariant]] under this action, so that &lt;math&gt;f(g\cdot x)=g \cdot f(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt;, a property  usually denoted by  &lt;math&gt;f:X \to_{G} Y&lt;/math&gt; . Heuristically speaking, standard topology views two spaces as equivalent "up to deformation," but equivariant topology considers spaces equivalent up to deformation so long as it  pays attention to any symmetry possessed by both spaces. A famous theorem of equivariant topology is the [[Borsuk–Ulam theorem]] , which asserts that every &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}_2&lt;/math&gt;-equivariant map &lt;math&gt;f:S^n \to \mathbb R^n&lt;/math&gt; necessarily vanishes.

== Induced &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-bundles ==
An important construction used in [[Equivariant cohomology]] and other applications includes a naturally occurring group bundle ( see [[Principal bundle]] for details.)

Let us first consider the case where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; acts freely on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Then, given a &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-equivariant map &lt;math&gt;f:X \to_G Y&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain sections &lt;math&gt;s_f: X/G \to (X \times Y)/G &lt;/math&gt; given by &lt;math&gt;[x] \mapsto [x,f(x)]&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;X  \times Y&lt;/math&gt; gets the diagonal action, &lt;math&gt;g(x,y)=(gx,gy)&lt;/math&gt;  and the bundle is &lt;math&gt;p:(X \times Y)/G \to X/G&lt;/math&gt;, with fiber &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; and projection given by &lt;math&gt;p([x,y])=[x]
&lt;/math&gt;.  Often, the total space is written &lt;math&gt;X \times_G Y&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, the assignment &lt;math&gt;s_f&lt;/math&gt; actually does not map to &lt;math&gt;(X \times Y)/G&lt;/math&gt; generally. Since &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is equivariant, if &lt;math&gt;g \in G_x&lt;/math&gt;(the isotropy subgroup), then by equivariance, we have that &lt;math&gt;g \cdot f(x)=f(g \cdot x)=f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, so in fact &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; will map to the collection of &lt;math&gt;\{[x,y] \in (X \times Y)/G \mid G_x \subset G_y\}&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, one can replace the bundle by a [[Equivariant cohomology#Homotopy quotient|homotopy quotient]] where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; acts freely and is bundle homotopic to the induced bundle on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.

== Applications To Discrete Geometry ==
In the same way that one can deduce the [[Ham sandwich theorem]] from the Borsuk-Ulam Theorem, one can find many applications of equivariant topology to problems of discrete geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783540003625|title=Using the Borsuk-Ulam Theorem - Lectures on Topological Methods in Combinatorics and Geometry {{!}} Jiri Matousek {{!}} Springer|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Handbook-Discrete-Computational-Mathematics-Applications/dp/1584883014|title=Handbook of Discrete and Computational Geometry, Second Edition|date=2004-04-15|publisher=Chapman and Hall/CRC|isbn=9781584883012|editor-last=Goodman|editor-first=Jacob E.|edition= 2nd|location=Boca Raton|language=English|editor-last2=O'Rourke|editor-first2=Joseph}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is accomplished by using the Configuration-Space Test-Map paradigm:

Given a geometric problem &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;,  we define the ''configuration space'', &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, which parametrizes all associated  solutions to the problem (such as points, lines, or arcs.) Additionally, we consider a ''test space'' &lt;math&gt;Z \subset V&lt;/math&gt; and a map &lt;math&gt;f:X \to V&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;p \in X&lt;/math&gt; is a solution to a problem if and only if &lt;math&gt;f(p) \in Z&lt;/math&gt;. Finally, it is usual to consider natural symmetries in a discrete problem by some group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; that acts on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is equivariant under these actions. The problem  is solved if we can show the nonexistence of an equivariant map &lt;math&gt;f:X \to V\setminus Z&lt;/math&gt;.

Obstructions to the existence of such maps are often formulated algebraically from the topological data of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V\setminus Z&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://people.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/matschke/thesisMatschke.pdf|title=Equivariant topology methods In discrete geometry|last=Matschke|first=Benjamin|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An archetypal example of such an obstruction can be derived having &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; a vector space and &lt;math&gt;Z=\{0\}&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, a nonvanishing map would also induce a nonvanishing section &lt;math&gt;s_f:x \mapsto [x,f(x)]&lt;/math&gt; from the discussion above, so &lt;math&gt;\omega_n(X \times_G Y)&lt;/math&gt;, the top [[Stiefel–Whitney class]] would need to vanish.

== Examples ==
* The identity map &lt;math&gt;i:X \to X&lt;/math&gt; will always be equivariant. 
* If we let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}_2&lt;/math&gt; act antipodally on the unit circle, then &lt;math&gt;z \mapsto z^3&lt;/math&gt;is equivariant, since it is an odd function.
* Any map &lt;math&gt;h:X \to X/G&lt;/math&gt; is equivariant when &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; acts trivially on the quotient, since &lt;math&gt;f(g\cdot x)=f(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4805">In [[philosophy]], '''facticity''' ({{Lang-fr|facticité}}, {{Lang-de|Faktizität}})&lt;ref name="Faktizität"&gt;{{cite book |first=Daniel O. |last=Dahlstrom |title=The Heidegger Dictionary |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lUtMAQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |publisher=Bloomsbury |location=London |date=2013 | pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5aWnJDAxbfwC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=%22facticity+(Faktizität)%22 71–2] |isbn=978-1-847-06514-8 |id={{ISBN|1-84706514-7}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; has a multiplicity of meanings from "factuality" and "contingency" to the intractable conditions of [[human existence]].&lt;ref&gt;Sartre, Jean-Paul. ''[[Being and Nothingness]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early usage==

The term is first used by German philosopher [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] (1762-1814) and has a variety of meanings. It can refer to facts and factuality, as in nineteenth-century [[positivism]], but comes to mean that which resists explanation and interpretation in [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] and [[Neo-Kantianism]]. The Neo-Kantians contrasted facticity with ideality, as does [[Jürgen Habermas]] in ''[[Between Facts and Norms]]'' (''Faktizität und Geltung'').

==Heidegger==
German philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]] (1889-1976) discusses "facticity"&lt;ref name="Faktizität"/&gt; as the "[[thrownness]]" (''Geworfenheit'') of individual existence, which is to say we are "thrown into the world."  By this, he is not only referring to a brute fact, or the factuality of a concrete historical situation, e.g., "born in the '80s." Facticity is something that already informs and has been taken up in existence, even if it is unnoticed or left unattended. As such, facticity is not something we come across and directly behold. In moods, for example, facticity has an enigmatic appearance, which involves both turning toward and away from it. For Heidegger, moods are conditions of thinking and willing to which they must in some way respond. The ''thrownness'' of human existence (or ''[[Dasein]]'') is accordingly disclosed through moods.

==Sartre and de Beauvoir==
In the mid-20th Century works of French existentialists [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Simone de Beauvoir]], facticity signifies all of the concrete details against the background of which human freedom exists and is limited. For example, these may include the time and place of birth, a language, an environment, an individual's previous choices, as well as the inevitable prospect of their death. For example: currently, the situation of a person who is born without legs precludes their freedom to walk on the beach; if future medicine were to develop a method of growing new legs for that person, their facticity might no longer exclude this activity.

==Recent usage==
It is a term that takes on a more specialized meaning in 20th century [[continental philosophy]], especially in [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and [[existentialism]], including [[Edmund Husserl]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] and [[Theodor Adorno]]. Recent philosophers such as [[Giorgio Agamben]], [[Jean-Luc Nancy]], and [[François Raffoul]] have taken up the notion of facticity in new ways.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Facticity plays a key part in [[Quentin Meillassoux]]'s philosophical project to challenge the thought-world relationship of [[correlationism]].  It is defined by him as “the absence of reason for any reality; in other words, the impossibility of providing an ultimate ground for the existence of any being.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Meillassoux |first=Quentin |authorlink=Quentin Meillassoux |title=Time Without Becoming |url=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:0uhYxWi1vLoJ:https://speculativeheresy.files.wordpress.com/2008/07/3729-time_without_becoming.pdf+&amp;hl=en |date=8 May 2008 |accessdate=29 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''FairChain''' aims to establish a fairer distribution of returns in a production chain. For many products, this distribution is crooked, leaving the farmer or the exporting country a fraction of the retail price. Fair Chain goes beyond [[fair trade]], which mainly wants to guarantee farmers a fair price. The Fair Chain principles were first developed by Dutch-born entrepreneur Guido van Staveren van Dijk, when he founded Moyee.  Moyee, a Dutch-Ethiopean coffee company, (2012) is an organization to apply the chain concept in the coffee production chain by roasting, mixing and packaging beans in the country of origin, instead of in Europe or the United States as it is normally done. The aim of Fair Chain is  therefore to leave more added value in the producing country.
This way to operate fits into the idea of [[Creating Shared Value|creating shared value]], which means that in Moyee's case economic and social interests go hand in hand:
* it pays a large premium on the local price for beans
* it roasts locally, in a joint venture with local partners who invest in improving the agricultural and living conditions
* profits are used to fund social projects that the fair chain principle reinforcing.

After the FairChain foundation wrote down
Its principles and Moyee Coffee was created, Escoffee in Ecuador and Azahar Coffee in Colombia ("Value Added at Source") could be considered amongst the first initiatives to work according to the FairChain principles

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6018">'''Fractional anisotropy (FA)''' is a [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] value between zero and one that describes the degree of [[anisotropy]] of a [[diffusion]] process. A value of zero means that diffusion is isotropic, i.e. it is unrestricted (or equally restricted) in all directions. A value of one means that diffusion occurs only along one axis and is fully restricted along all other directions. FA is a measure often used in [[diffusion imaging]] where it is thought to reflect [[fiber density]], [[axon]]al diameter, and [[myelination]] in [[white matter]]. The FA is an extension of the concept of [[Eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity of conic sections]] in 3 dimensions, normalized to the unit range.

== Definition ==

A Diffusion Ellipsoid is completely represented by the Diffusion Tensor, D. FA is calculated from the [[eigenvalue]]s (&lt;math&gt;\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3&lt;/math&gt;) of the diffusion [[tensor]].&lt;ref name="Basser1996" /&gt; The eigenvectors &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; give the directions in which the ellipsoid has major axes, and the corresponding eigenvalues  &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; give the magnitude of the peak in that direction.

[[File:DTschematic.jpg|thumb|right| Diffusion Tensor Schematic]]

: &lt;math&gt;\text{FA} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} \frac{\sqrt{(\lambda_1 - \hat{\lambda})^2 + (\lambda_2 - \hat{\lambda})^2 + (\lambda_3 - \hat{\lambda})^2}}{\sqrt{\lambda_1^2 + \lambda_2^2 + \lambda_3^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;\hat{\lambda} = (\lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \lambda_3)/3&lt;/math&gt; being the mean value of the eigenvalues.

An equivalent formula for FA is

: &lt;math&gt;\text{FA} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} \frac{\sqrt{(\lambda_1 - \lambda_2)^2 + (\lambda_2 - \lambda_3)^2 + (\lambda_3 - \lambda_1)^2}}{\sqrt{\lambda_1^2 + \lambda_2^2 + \lambda_3^2}},&lt;/math&gt;

which is further equivalent to:&lt;ref name="ozarslan2005" /&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\text{FA} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \left(3-\frac{1}{\text{trace}(\text{R}^2)}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

where R is the "normalized" diffusion tensor:

: &lt;math&gt;\text{R} = \frac{\text{D}}{\text{trace}(\text{D})}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that if all the eigenvalues are equal, which happens for isotropic (spherical) diffusion, as in free water, the FA is {{math|0}}.   The FA can reach a maximum value of {{math|1}} (this rarely happens in real data), in which case D has only one nonzero eigenvalue and the ellipsoid reduces to a line in the direction of that eigenvector. This means that the diffusion is confined to that direction alone.

== Details ==

This can be visualized with an ellipsoid, which is defined by the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of D. The FA of a sphere is ''0'' since the diffusion is isotropic, and there is equal probability of diffusion in all directions. The eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the Diffusion Tensor give a complete representation of the diffusion process. FA quantifies the pointedness of the ellipsoid, but does not give information about which direction it is pointing to.

Note that the FA of most liquids, including water, is {{math|0}} unless the diffusion process is being constrained by structures such as network of fibers.  The measured FA may depend on the effective length scale of the diffusion measurement.  If the diffusion process is not constrained on the scale being measured (the constraints are too far apart) or the constraints switch direction on a smaller scale than the measured one, then the measured FA will be attenuated.  For example, the brain can be thought of as a fluid permeated by many fibers (nerve axons).  However, in most parts the fibers go in all directions, and thus although they constrain the diffusion the FA is {{math|0}}. In some regions, such as the [[corpus callosum]] the fibers are aligned over a large enough scale (on the order of a mm) for their directions to mostly agree within the resolution element of a [[magnetic resonance image]], and it is these regions that stand out in an FA image.  [[Liquid crystals]] can also exhibit anisotropic diffusion because the needle or plate-like shapes of their molecules affect how they slide over one another.  When the FA is 0 the tensor nature of D is often ignored, and it is called the diffusion constant.

&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Ellipsoid2722.jpg| FA value of 0.9209, the DT matrix is diagonal([27 2 2])
File:Ellipsoid888.jpg| FA value of 0, the DT matrix is diagonal([8 8 8])
File:Ellipsoid eigenvalues14142.jpg|FA value of 0.6030, the DT matrix is diagonal([14 14 2])
&lt;/gallery&gt;

A drawback of the Diffusion Tensor model is that it can account only for [[Gaussian]] diffusion processes, which has been found to be inadequate in accurately representing the true diffusion process in the human brain. Due to this, higher order models using spherical harmonics and Orientation Distribution Functions (ODF) have been used to define newer and richer estimates of the anisotropy, called Generalized Fractional Anisotropy. GFA computations use samples of the ODF to evaluate the anisotropy in diffusion. They can also be easily calculated by using the Spherical Harmonic coefficients of the ODF model.&lt;ref name="Cohen2008" /&gt;

'''Girls of Enghelab Street''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: دختران خیابان انقلاب) is a series of protests against [[Hijab by country#Iran|compulsory hijab]] in Iran. The protests were inspired by '''Vida Movahed''' ({{lang-fa|ویدا موحد}}), an Iranian woman known as the '''Girl of Enghelab Street''' ({{lang-fa|دختر خیابان انقلاب}}), who stood in the crowd on a utility box in the [[Enqelab Street|Enghelab Street]] (Revolution Street) of [[Tehran]] on 28 December 2017, tied her hijab, a white headscarf, to a stick, and waved it to the crowd as a flag.&lt;ref name="al-monitor.com_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="albawaba.com_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dailystar.com.lb_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="foxnews.com_1"/&gt; She was arrested on that day&lt;ref name="dailystar.com.lb_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="foxnews.com_1"/&gt; and was released temporary on bail&lt;ref name="iranhumanrights.org_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newyorker.com_1"/&gt; a month later, on 28 January 2018.&lt;ref name="NasrinSotoudeh_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk_1"/&gt; Some people believe that Movahed's action was based on [[Masih Alinejad]]'s call for [[White Wednesdays]], a protest movement that the presenter at [[VOA-PNN|VOA Persian Television]] started in early 2017.&lt;ref name="globalvoices.org_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="theguardian.com_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rferl.org_2"/&gt; Other women later re-enacted her protest and posted photos of their actions on social media. These women are described as the "Girls of Enghelab Street"&lt;ref name="theguardian.com_1"/&gt; and "The Girls Of Revolution Street"&lt;ref&gt;https://www.voanews.com/a/in-tehran-new-hijab-protester-led-off-by-police/4635838.html&lt;/ref&gt; in English sources. Some of the protesters claim that they didn't follow Masih Alinejad's call.&lt;ref name="en.radiofarda.com_2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="radiozamaneh.com_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="radiozamaneh.com_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="asriran.com_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tasnimnews.com_1"/&gt;

== Islamic Republic's Penal Code ==
{{see|Theocracy#Iran}}
In the Islamic law of Iran imposed shortly after the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 Islamic revolution]], article 638 of 5th book of Islamic Penal Code (called Sanctions and deterrent penalties) women who do not wear a hijab may be imprisoned from ten days to two months, and/or required to pay fines from 50,000 up to 500,000 [[Iranian rial|rials]].&lt;ref name="thesun.co.uk_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="article_638_iran_law"/&gt; Fines are recalculated in the courts as the value of Iranian rials drops every year since 1979.

Article 639 of the same book says, two type of people shall be sentenced to one year to 10 years imprisonment, first a person who establishes or directs a place of immorality or prostitution, second a person who facilitates or encourages people to commit immorality or prostitution.&lt;ref name="iranhumanrights.org_2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="article_639_iran_law"/&gt;

These are some of the laws under which some protesters were charged.&lt;ref name="iranhumanrights.org_2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rudaw.net_1"/&gt;

== Background ==
Before the [[Iranian Islamic Revolution]] of 1979 (during the reign of [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], the last [[Shah]] of Iran) the hijab was not compulsory,&lt;ref name="El Guindi"/&gt; though some Iranian women during this period wore headscarfs or [[chador]].&lt;ref name="Abrahamian"/&gt;

After the 1979 Islamic revolution, the hijab gradually became compulsory.&lt;ref name="Milani"/&gt; In 1979, [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] announced that women should observe Islamic dress code;&lt;ref name="Milani"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Algar84/&gt; His statement sparked demonstrations, which were met by government assurances that the statement was only a recommendation.&lt;ref name="Milani"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Algar84/&gt; Hijab was subsequently made mandatory in government and public offices in 1980, and in 1983 it became mandatory for all women.&lt;ref name="Milani"/&gt;

In 2018, a government run survey dating back to 2014, was released by President [[Hassan Rouhani]], showing that 49.8% of Iranians were against compulsory or mandatory hijab.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="post-gazette.com_1"/&gt; The report was released by the [[Center for Strategic Studies]], the research arm of the Iranian President's office, and was titled "Report of the first hijab special meeting" on July 2014 in a PDF format.&lt;ref name="css.ir_1"/&gt;

On 2 February 2018 a poll conducted by the Center for International and Security Studies at Maryland (CISSM) showed that a few Iranians agreed with "changing Iran's political system or relaxing strict Islamic law".&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Taylor|first1=Adam|title=Most Iranians feel Trump’s comments in support of protesters didn’t help, poll finds|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/02/02/most-iranians-feel-trumps-comments-in-support-of-protesters-didnt-help-poll-finds/|website=washingtonpost|accessdate=2 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iran is the only country in the world that requires non-Muslim women to wear a headscarf.&lt;ref name="firstpost.com_1"/&gt; For example, in January 2018, a [[Chinese people|Chinese]] female musician was forcibly veiled in the middle of her concert performance.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.albawaba.com/loop/chinese-musician-humiliated-iran-hijab-imposed-mid-performance-1074470&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''gladiator''' ({{lang-la|gladiator}}, "swordsman", from {{lang|la|[[gladius]]}}, "sword") was an armed combatant who entertained audiences in the [[Roman Republic]] and [[Roman Empire]] in violent confrontations with other gladiators, wild animals, and condemned criminals. Some gladiators were volunteers who risked their lives and their legal and social standing by appearing in the arena. Most were despised as slaves, schooled under harsh conditions, socially marginalized, and segregated even in death.

Irrespective of their origin, gladiators offered spectators an example of Rome's martial ethics and, in fighting or dying well, they could inspire admiration and popular acclaim. They were celebrated in high and low art, and their value as entertainers was commemorated in precious and commonplace objects throughout the Roman world.

The origin of gladiatorial combat is open to debate. There is evidence of it in funeral rites during the [[Punic Wars]] of the 3rd century BC, and thereafter it rapidly became an essential feature of politics and social life in the Roman world. Its popularity led to its use in ever more lavish and costly [[Ludi|games]].

The gladiator games lasted for nearly a thousand years, reaching their peak between the 1st century BC and the 2nd century AD.  The games finally declined during the early 5th century after the adoption of [[Christianity]] as [[state church of the Roman Empire]] in 380, although beast hunts (''[[venatio]]nes'') continued into the 6th century.

==History==

===Origins===
[[File:Fronton marmol anfiteatro romano de Merida.JPG|thumb|Relief of gladiators from [[Amphitheatre of Mérida]], Spain]]
Early literary sources seldom agree on the origins of gladiators and the gladiator games.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=17}}; {{harvnb|Kyle|1998|p=82}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1st century BC, [[Nicolaus of Damascus]] believed they were [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Welch|2007|pp=16–17}}. Nicolaus cites [[Posidonius]]'s support for a [[Celt]]ic origin and Hermippus' for a [[Mantinea]]n (therefore [[Ancient Greece|Greek]]) origin.&lt;/ref&gt; A generation later, [[Livy]] wrote that they were first held in 310 BC by the [[Campania]]ns in celebration of their victory over the [[Samnium|Samnites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=4–7}}. Futrell is citing Livy, 9.40.17.&lt;/ref&gt; Long after the games had ceased, the 7th century AD writer [[Isidore of Seville]] derived Latin ''[[wiktionary:lanista#Latin|lanista]]'' (manager of gladiators) from the Etruscan word for "executioner," and the title of [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]] (an official who accompanied the dead from the Roman gladiatorial arena) from [[Charun]], [[psychopomp]] of the Etruscan underworld.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=14–15}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This was accepted and repeated in most early modern, standard histories of the games.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=11}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reappraisal of pictorial evidence supports a Campanian origin, or at least a borrowing, for the games and gladiators.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=18}}; {{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=3–5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Campania hosted the earliest known gladiator schools (''[[Ludus (ancient Rome)|ludi]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=4}}; {{harvnb|Potter|Mattingly|1999|p=226}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Tomb [[fresco]]es from the Campanian city of [[Paestum]] (4th century BC) show paired fighters, with helmets, spears and shields, in a propitiatory funeral blood-rite that anticipates early Roman gladiator games.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Potter|Mattingly|1999|p=226}}. Paestum was colonized by Rome in 273 BC.&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to these images, supporting evidence from Etruscan tomb-paintings is tentative and late. The Paestum frescoes may represent the continuation of a much older tradition, acquired or inherited from Greek colonists of the 8th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Welch|2007|pp=15, 18}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Livy places the first Roman gladiator games (264 BC) in the early stage of Rome's [[First Punic War]] against [[Carthage]], when Decimus Iunius Brutus Scaeva had three gladiator pairs fight to the death in Rome's "cattle market" Forum (''[[Forum Boarium]]'') to honor his dead father, Brutus Pera. This is described as a ''[[wiktionary:munus#Latin|munus]]'' (plural: ''[[Munera (ancient Rome)|munera]]''), a commemorative duty owed the [[manes]] of a dead ancestor by his descendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Welch|2007|pp=18–19}}. Livy's account (summary 16) places beast-hunts and gladiatorial ''munera'' within this single ''[[wikt:munus|munus]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A single, later source describes the gladiator type involved as [[Thraex|Thracian]]. See {{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=19}}. Welch is citing Ausanius: Seneca simply says they were "war captives".&lt;/ref&gt; The development of the ''munus'' and its [[List of Roman gladiator types|gladiator types]] was most strongly influenced by Samnium's support for [[Hannibal]] and the subsequent punitive expeditions against the Samnites by Rome and her Campanian allies; the earliest and most frequently mentioned type was the [[Samnite (gladiator type)|Samnite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wiedemann|1992|p=33}}; {{harvnb|Kyle|1998|p=2}}; {{harvnb|Kyle|2007|p=273}}. Evidence of "Samnite" as an insult in earlier writings fades as Samnium is absorbed into the Republic.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The war in Samnium, immediately afterwards, was attended with equal danger and an equally glorious conclusion. The enemy, besides their other warlike preparation, had made their battle-line to glitter with new and splendid arms. There were two corps: the shields of the one were inlaid with gold, of the other with silver&amp;nbsp;... The Romans had already heard of these splendid accoutrements, but their generals had taught them that a soldier should be rough to look on, not adorned with gold and silver but putting his trust in iron and in courage&amp;nbsp;... The [[Roman dictator|Dictator]], as decreed by the [[Roman senate|senate]], celebrated a triumph, in which by far the finest show was afforded by the captured armour. So the Romans made use of the splendid armour of their enemies to do honour to their gods; while the Campanians, in consequence of their pride and in hatred of the Samnites, equipped after this fashion the gladiators who furnished them entertainment at their feasts, and bestowed on them the name Samnites. (Livy 9.40)&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=4–5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Livy's account skirts the funereal, sacrificial function of early Roman gladiator combats and reflects the later theatrical ethos of the Roman gladiator show: splendidly, exotically armed and armoured [[barbarians]], treacherous and degenerate, are dominated by Roman iron and native courage.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|1998|p=67 (Note #84)}}. Livy's published works are often embellished with illustrative rhetorical detail.&lt;/ref&gt; His plain Romans virtuously dedicate the magnificent spoils of war to the Gods. Their Campanian allies stage a dinner entertainment using gladiators who may not be Samnites, but play the Samnite role. Other groups and tribes would join the cast list as Roman territories expanded. Most gladiators were armed and armoured in the manner of the enemies of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;The ''velutes'' and later, the ''provocatores'' were exceptions, but as "historicised" rather than contemporary Roman types. See [[List of Roman gladiator types|Gladiator types]].&lt;/ref&gt; The ''munus'' became a morally instructive form of historic enactment in which the only honourable option for the gladiator was to fight well, or else die well.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|1998|pp=80–81}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===
In 216 BC, [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (consul 232 BC)|Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]], late [[Roman consul|consul]] and [[augur]], was honoured by his sons with three days of ''gladiatora munera'' in the [[Forum Romanum]], using twenty-two pairs of gladiators.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=21}}. Welch is citing Livy, 23.30.15. The Aemilii Lepidii were one of the most important families in Rome at the time, and probably owned a gladiator school (''ludus'').&lt;/ref&gt; Ten years later, [[Scipio Africanus]] gave a commemorative ''munus'' in Iberia for his father and uncle, casualties in the Punic Wars. High status non-Romans, and possibly Romans too, volunteered as his gladiators.&lt;ref name="Futrell, 8-9"&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=8–9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The context of the [[Punic Wars]] and Rome's near-disastrous defeat at the [[Battle of Cannae]] (216 BC) link these early games to munificence, the celebration of military victory and the religious expiation of military disaster; these ''munera'' appear to serve a morale-raising agenda in an era of military threat and expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=30}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The next recorded ''munus'', held for the funeral of [[Publius Licinius Crassus Dives (consul 205 BC)|Publius Licinius]] in 183 BC, was more extravagant. It involved three days of funeral games, 120 gladiators, and public distribution of meat (''visceratio data'')&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 39.46.2.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– a practice that reflected the gladiatorial fights at Campanian banquets described by Livy and later deplored by Silius Italicus.&lt;ref&gt;Silius Italicus quoted in {{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=4–5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The enthusiastic adoption of ''gladiatoria munera'' by Rome's Iberian allies shows how easily, and how early, the culture of the gladiator ''munus'' permeated places far from Rome itself. By 174 BC, "small" Roman ''munera'' (private or public), provided by an ''[[wiktionary:editor#Latin|editor]]'' of relatively low importance, may have been so commonplace and unremarkable they were not considered worth recording:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=21}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Many gladiatorial games were given in that year, some unimportant, one noteworthy beyond the rest&amp;nbsp;— that of [[Titus Quinctius Flamininus|Titus Flamininus]] which he gave to commemorate the death of his father, which lasted four days, and was accompanied by a public distribution of meats, a banquet, and scenic performances. The climax of the show which was big for the time was that in three days seventy four gladiators fought.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, ''Annal for the Year 174 BC'' (cited in {{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=21}}).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 105 BC, the ruling consuls offered Rome its first taste of state-sponsored "[[barbarian]] combat" demonstrated by gladiators from Capua, as part of a training program for the military. It proved immensely popular.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{harvnb|Wiedemann|1992|pp=6–7}}. Wiedemann is citing Valerius Maximus, 2.3.2.&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, the gladiator contests formerly restricted to private ''munera'' were often included in the state games (''[[ludi]]'')&lt;ref&gt;The games were always referred to in the plural, as ''ludi''. Gladiator schools were also known as ''ludi'' when plural; a single school was ''ludus''&lt;/ref&gt; that accompanied the major religious festivals. Where traditional ''ludi'' had been dedicated to a deity, such as [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], the ''munera'' could be dedicated to an aristocratic sponsor's divine or heroic ancestor.&lt;ref name="Lintott 2004 183"&gt;{{harvnb|Lintott|2004|p=183}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peak===
[[File:Retiarius stabs secutor (color).jpg|thumb|A ''[[retiarius]]'' stabs at a ''[[secutor]]'' with his [[trident]] in this mosaic from the villa at [[Nennig]], Germany, c. 2nd–3rd century AD.]]
Gladiator games offered their sponsors extravagantly expensive but effective opportunities for self-promotion, and gave their clients and potential voters exciting entertainment at little or no cost to themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mouritsen|2001|p=97}}; {{harvnb|Coleman|1990|p=50}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Gladiators became big business for trainers and owners, for politicians on the make and those who had reached the top and wished to stay there. A politically ambitious ''[[privatus]]'' (private citizen) might postpone his deceased father's ''munus'' to the election season, when a generous show might drum up votes; those in power and those seeking it needed the support of the [[plebeian]]s and their [[tribune]]s, whose votes might be won with the mere promise of an exceptionally good show.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|2007|p=287}}; {{harvnb|Mouritsen|2001|pp=32, 109–111}}. Approximately 12% of Rome's adult male population could actually vote; but these were the wealthiest and most influential among ordinary citizens, well worth cultivation by any politician.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sulla]], during his term as [[praetor]], showed his usual acumen in breaking his own [[sumptuary]] laws to give the most lavish ''munus'' yet seen in Rome, on occasion of his wife's funeral.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|2007|p=285}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the closing years of the politically and socially unstable Late Republic, any aristocratic owner of gladiators had political muscle at his disposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|2007|p=287}}; such as Caesar's Capua-based gladiators, brought to Rome as a private army to impress and overawe.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=24}}. Gladiator gangs were used by Caesar and others to overawe and "persuade".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mouritsen|2001|p=61}}. Gladiators could be enrolled to serve noble households; some household slaves may have been raised and trained for this.&lt;/ref&gt; In 65 BC, newly elected [[curule aedile]] [[Julius Caesar]] held games that he justified as ''munus'' to his father, who had been dead for 20 years. Despite an already enormous personal debt, he used 320 gladiator pairs in silvered armour.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mouritsen|2001|p=97}}. For more details see Plutarch's ''Julius Caesar'', 5.4.&lt;/ref&gt; He had more available in Capua but the Senate, mindful of the recent [[Spartacus]] revolt and fearful of Caesar's burgeoning private armies and rising popularity, imposed a limit of 320 pairs as the maximum number of gladiators any citizen could keep in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|2007|pp=285–287}}. See also Pliny's ''Historia Naturalis'', 33.16.53.&lt;/ref&gt; Caesar's showmanship was unprecedented in scale and expense;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|2007|pp=280, 287}}&lt;/ref&gt; he had staged a ''munus'' as memorial rather than funeral rite, eroding any practical or meaningful distinction between ''munus'' and ''ludi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wiedemann|1992|pp=8–10}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gladiatorial games, usually linked with beast shows, spread throughout the Republic and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=21}}. Antiochus IV Epiphanes of Greece was keen to upstage his Roman allies, but gladiators were becoming increasingly expensive, and to save costs, all his were local volunteers.&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-corruption laws of 65 and 63 BC attempted but failed to curb the political usefulness of the games to their sponsors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|2007|p=280}}. Kyle is citing Cicero's ''Lex Tullia Ambitu''.&lt;/ref&gt; Following Caesar's assassination and the [[Roman Civil War]], [[Augustus]] assumed Imperial authority over the games, including ''munera'', and formalised their provision as a civic and religious duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Richlin|1992|loc=Shelby Brown, "Death as Decoration: Scenes of the Arena on Roman Domestic Mosaics", p. 184}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His revision of sumptuary law capped private and public expenditure on ''munera'', claiming to save the Roman elite from the bankruptcies they would otherwise suffer, and restricted their performance to the festivals of [[Saturnalia]] and [[Quinquatria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wiedemann|1992|p=45}}. Wiedemann is citing Cassius Dio, 54.2.3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Henceforth, the ceiling cost for a [[praetor]]'s "economical" official ''munus'' employing a maximum 120 gladiators was to be 25,000 denarii; a "generous" Imperial ''ludi'' might cost no less than 180,000 denarii.&lt;ref&gt;Prices in denarii cited in "Venationes," [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/gladiators/venationes.html ''Encyclopaedia Romana''].&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the Empire, the greatest and most celebrated games would now be identified with the state-sponsored [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]], which furthered public recognition, respect and approval for the Emperor's divine [[numen]], his laws, and his agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Auguet|1994|p=30}}. Augustus's games each involved an average 625 gladiator pairs.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lintott 2004 183"/&gt; Between 108 and 109 AD, [[Trajan]] celebrated his [[Dacia]]n victories using a reported 10,000 gladiators and 11,000 animals over 123 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Richlin|1992|loc=Shelby Brown, "Death as Decoration: Scenes of the Arena on Roman Domestic Mosaics", p. 181}}. Brown is citing Dio Cassius, 68.15.&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of gladiators and ''munera'' continued to spiral out of control. Legislation of 177 AD by [[Marcus Aurelius]] did little to stop it, and was completely ignored by his son, [[Commodus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=48}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation==
The earliest ''[[Munera (ancient Rome)|munera]]'' took place at or near the tomb of the deceased and these were organised by their ''munerator'' (who made the offering). Later games were held by an ''editor'', either identical with the ''munerator'' or an official employed by him. As time passed, these titles and meanings may have merged.&lt;ref name="Kyle 1998 80"&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|1998|p=80}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Republican era, private citizens could own and train gladiators, or lease them from a ''lanista'' (owner of a gladiator training school). From the Principate onwards, private citizens could hold munera and own gladiators only under Imperial permission, and the role of ''editor'' was increasingly tied to state officialdom. Legislation by [[Claudius]] required that [[quaestor]]s, the lowest rank of Roman magistrate, personally subsidise two-thirds of the costs of games for their small-town communities&amp;nbsp;– in effect, both an advertisement of their personal generosity and a part-purchase of their office. Bigger games were put on by senior magistrates, who could better afford them. The largest and most lavish of all were paid for by the emperor himself.&lt;ref name="Futrell, 43"&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=43}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wiedemann|1992|pp=440–446}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The gladiators==
{{Main|List of Roman gladiator types}}
The earliest types of gladiator were named after Rome's enemies of that time: the [[Samnite (gladiator type)|Samnite]], [[Thraex|Thracian]] and [[List of Roman gladiator types#Gallus|Gaul]]. The Samnite, heavily armed, elegantly helmed and probably the most popular type, was renamed [[secutor]]  and the Gaul renamed [[murmillo]], once these former enemies had been conquered then absorbed into Rome's Empire. In the mid-republican ''munus'', each type seems to have fought against a similar or identical type. In the later Republic and early Empire, various "fantasy" types were introduced, and were set against dissimilar but complementary types. For example, the bareheaded, nimble [[retiarius]] ("net-man"), armoured only at the left arm and shoulder, pitted his net, trident and dagger against the more heavily armoured, helmeted Secutor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|2007|p=313}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most depictions of gladiators show the most common and popular types. Passing literary references to others has allowed their tentative reconstruction. Other novelties introduced around this time included gladiators who fought from [[Essedarius|chariots or carts]], or from [[Eques (ancient Rome)|horseback]].

The trade in gladiators was empire-wide, and subjected to official supervision. Rome's military success produced a supply of soldier-prisoners who were redistributed for use in State mines or amphitheatres and for sale on the open market. For example, in the aftermath of the [[First Jewish–Roman War|Jewish Revolt]], the gladiator schools received an influx of Jews&amp;nbsp;– those rejected for training would have been sent straight to the arenas as ''noxii'' (lit. [[wiktionary:noxius#Latin|"hurtful ones"]]).&lt;ref&gt;Josephus. ''The Jewish War'', 6.418, 7.37–40; {{harvnb|Kyle|1998|p=93}}. ''noxii'' were the most obnoxious of criminal categories in Roman law.&lt;/ref&gt; The best&amp;nbsp;– the most robust&amp;nbsp;– were sent to Rome. In Rome's military ethos, enemy soldiers who had surrendered or allowed their own capture and enslavement had been granted an unmerited gift of life. Their training as gladiators would give them opportunity to redeem their honour in the ''munus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=120–125}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jean-Leon Gerome Pollice Verso.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[Pollice Verso (Gérôme)|Pollice Verso]]'' ("With a Turned Thumb"), an 1872 painting by [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]]]]

Two other sources of gladiators, found increasingly during the Principate and the relatively low military activity of the [[Pax Romana]], were slaves condemned to the arena (''damnati''), to gladiator schools or games (''ad ludum gladiatorium'')&lt;ref&gt;''Ludus'' meant both a game and a school&amp;nbsp;— see entries 1 to 2.C, at Lewis and Short ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0059:entry=lu_dus Perseus Project]).&lt;/ref&gt; as punishment for crimes, and the paid volunteers (''[[wiktionary:auctoro#Latin|auctorati]]'') who by the late Republic may have comprised approximately half&amp;nbsp;– and possibly the most capable half&amp;nbsp;– of all gladiators.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=124}}. See also Cassius Dio's accusation of entrapment by informers to provide "arena slaves" under Claudius; {{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=103}}. "the best gladiators", Futrell citing Petronius's ''Satyricon'', 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of volunteers had a precedent in the Iberian ''munus'' of [[Scipio Africanus]]; but none of those had been paid.&lt;ref name="Futrell, 8-9" /&gt;

For the poor, and for non-citizens, enrollment in a gladiator school offered a trade, regular food, housing of sorts and a fighting chance of fame and fortune. [[Mark Antony]] chose a troupe of gladiators to be his personal bodyguard.&lt;ref name="Futrell, 129: citing Dio"&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=129}}. Futrell is citing Cassius Dio.&lt;/ref&gt; Gladiators customarily kept their prize money and any gifts they received, and these could be substantial. [[Tiberius]] offered several retired gladiators 100,000 ''sesterces'' each to return to the arena.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius. ''Lives'', "Tiberius", [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/suet-tiberius-rolfe.html 7].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nero]] gave the gladiator Spiculus property and residence "equal to those of men who had celebrated triumphs."&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius. ''Lives'', "Nero", [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/suet-nero-rolfe.html 30].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women===
{{main|Gladiatrix}}
From the 60s AD [[female gladiator]]s appear as rare and "exotic markers of exceptionally lavish spectacle".&lt;ref name="Futrell 2006 153–156"&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=153–156}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 66 AD, [[Nero]] had Ethiopian women, men and children fight at a ''munus'' to impress the King [[Tiridates I of Armenia|Tiridates I]] of [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wiedemann|1992|p=112}}; {{harvnb|Jacobelli|2003|p=17}}, citing Cassius Dio, 62.3.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Romans seem to have found the idea of a female gladiator novel and entertaining, or downright absurd; Juvenal titillates his readers with a woman named "Mevia", hunting boars in the arena "with spear in hand and breasts exposed",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jacobelli|2003|p=17}}, citing Juvenal's ''Saturae'', 1.22–1.23.&lt;/ref&gt; and Petronius mocks the pretensions of a rich, low-class citizen, whose ''munus'' includes a woman fighting from a cart or chariot.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jacobelli|2003|p=18}}, citing Petronius's ''Satyricon'', 45.7.&lt;/ref&gt; A ''munus'' of 89 AD, during [[Domitian]]'s reign, featured a battle between female gladiators, described as "Amazons".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jacobelli|2003|p=18}}, citing Dio Cassius 67.8.4, Suetonius's ''Domitianus'' 4.2, and Statius's ''Silvae'' 1.8.51–1.8.56: see also Brunet (2014) p.480.&lt;/ref&gt; In Halicarnassus, a 2nd-century AD relief depicts two female combatants named "Amazon" and "Achillia"; their match ended in a draw.&lt;ref name="Jacobelli 2003 18"&gt;{{harvnb|Jacobelli|2003|p=18}}; {{harvnb|Potter|2010|p=408}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same century, an epigraph praises one of [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]]'s local elite as the first to "arm women" in the history of its games.&lt;ref name="Jacobelli 2003 18" /&gt; Female gladiators probably submitted to the same regulations and training as their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Potter|2010|p=408}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Roman morality required that all gladiators be of the lowest social classes, and emperors who failed to respect this distinction earned the scorn of posterity. [[Cassius Dio]] takes pains to point out that when the much admired emperor [[Titus]] used female gladiators, they were of acceptably low class.&lt;ref name="Futrell 2006 153–156" /&gt;

Some regarded female gladiators of any type or class as a symptom of corrupted Roman appetites, morals and womanhood. Before he became emperor, [[Septimius Severus]] may have attended the [[Antioch]]ene Olympic Games, which had been revived by the emperor [[Commodus]] and included traditional Greek female athletics. His attempt to give Rome a similarly dignified display of female athletics was met by the crowd with ribald chants and cat-calls.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Potter|2010|p=407}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Probably as a result, he banned the use of female gladiators in 200 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jacobelli|2003|p=18}}, citing Dio Cassius 75.16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Potter|2010|p=407}}, citing Dio Cassius 75.16.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emperors===
[[Caligula]], [[Titus]], [[Hadrian]], [[Lucius Verus]], [[Caracalla]], [[Publius Septimius Geta|Geta]] and [[Didius Julianus]] were all said to have performed in the arena, either in public or private, but risks to themselves were minimal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barton|1993|p=66}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Claudius]], characterised by his historians as morbidly cruel and boorish, fought a whale trapped in the harbor in front of a group of spectators.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fox|2006|p=576}}. Fox is citing Pliny.&lt;/ref&gt; Commentators invariably disapproved of such performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=158}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Commodus]] was a fanatical participant at the ''ludi'', and compelled Rome's elite to attend his performances as gladiator, ''[[Bestiarii|bestiarius]]'' or ''[[Venatio|venator]]''. Most of his performances as a gladiator were bloodless affairs, fought with wooden swords; he invariably won. He was said to have restyled Nero's colossal statue in his own image as "[[Hercules]] Reborn", dedicated to himself as "Champion of ''secutores''; only left-handed fighter to conquer twelve times one thousand men."&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio. ''Commodus'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/73*.htm 73 (Epitome)]&lt;/ref&gt; He was said to have killed 100 lions in one day, almost certainly from an elevated platform surrounding the arena perimeter, which allowed him to safely demonstrate his marksmanship. On another occasion, he decapitated a running ostrich with a specially designed dart, carried the bloodied head and his sword over to the Senatorial seats and gesticulated as though they were next.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gibbon|Womersley|2000|p=118}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As reward for these services, he drew a gigantic stipend from the public purse.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio. ''Commodus'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/73*.html 73 (Epitome)]. Commodus was assassinated and posthumously declared a public enemy but was later deified.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The games==
===Preparations===
Gladiator games were advertised well beforehand, on billboards that gave the reason for the game, its editor, venue, date and the number of paired gladiators (''ordinarii'') to be used. Other highlighted features could include details of ''venationes'', executions, music and any luxuries to be provided for the spectators, such as an awning against the sun, water sprinklers, food, drink, sweets and occasionally "door prizes". For enthusiasts and gamblers, a more detailed program (''libellus'') was distributed on the day of the ''munus'', showing the names, types and match records of gladiator pairs, and their order of appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=85, 101, 110}}. Based on fragmentary Pompeian remains and citing of Pliny's ''Historia Naturalis'', 19.23–25.&lt;/ref&gt; Left-handed gladiators were advertised as a rarity; they were trained to fight right-handers, which gave them an advantage over most opponents and produced an interestingly unorthodox combination.&lt;ref name="Coleman"&gt;{{cite web|last=Coleman|first=Kathleen|title=Gladiators: Heroes of the Roman Amphitheatre|work=BBC|date=17 February 2011|accessdate=21 April 2017|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/romans/gladiators_01.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The night before the ''munus'', the gladiators were given a banquet and opportunity to order their personal and private affairs; Futrell notes its similarity to a ritualistic or sacramental "last meal".&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch. ''Moral Essays'', 1099B (fully cited in {{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=86–87}}): "Even among the gladiators, I see those who...find greater pleasure in freeing their slaves, and commending their wives to their friends, than in satisfying their appetites."&lt;/ref&gt; These were probably both family and public events which included even the ''noxii'', sentenced to die in the arena the following day; and the ''damnati'', who would have at least a slender chance of survival. The event may also have been used to drum up more publicity for the imminent game.&lt;ref name="Potter and Mattingly, 313"&gt;{{harvnb|Potter|Mattingly|1999|p=313}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=86}}. Gladiatorial banquet on mosaic, El Djem.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The ''ludi'' and ''munus''===
Official ''munera'' of the early Imperial era seem to have followed a standard form (''munus legitimum'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=23}}; {{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=84}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A procession (''pompa'') entered the arena, led by [[lictors]] who bore the [[fasces]] that signified the magistrate-''editor'''s power over life and death. They were followed by a small band of trumpeters (''tubicines'') playing a fanfare. Images of the gods were carried in to "witness" the proceedings, followed by a scribe to record the outcome, and a man carrying the palm branch used to honour victors. The magistrate ''editor'' entered among a retinue who carried the arms and armour to be used; the gladiators presumably came in last.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=85}}. See ''[[pompa circensis]]'' for the similar procession before games were held in the circus.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The entertainments often began with ''venationes'' (beast hunts) and ''bestiarii'' (beast fighters).&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes beasts were simply exhibited, and left unharmed; see {{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=88}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Next came the ''ludi meridiani'', which were of variable content but usually involved executions of ''noxii'', some of whom were condemned to be subjects of fatal re-enactments, based on Greek or Roman myths.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=91}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Gladiators may have been involved in these as executioners, though most of the crowd, and the gladiators themselves, preferred the "dignity" of an even contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=94–95}}. Futrell is citing Seneca's ''On Providence'', 3.4.&lt;/ref&gt; There were also comedy fights; some may have been lethal. A crude Pompeian graffito suggests a burlesque of musicians, dressed as animals named ''Ursus tibicen'' (flute-playing bear) and ''Pullus cornicen'' (horn-blowing chicken), perhaps as accompaniment to clowning by ''[[List of Roman gladiator types|paegniarii]]'' during a "mock" contest of the ''ludi meridiani''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wisdom|McBride|2001|p=18}}. Author's drawing.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Paegniarii gladiators (from Nennig mosaic).jpg|thumb|right|200px|A duel, using whip, cudgel and shields, from the Nennig mosaic (Germany)]]

The gladiators may have held informal warm-up matches, using blunted or dummy weapons&amp;nbsp;– some ''munera'', however, may have used blunted weapons throughout.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carter|2004|pp=43, 46–49}}. In the Eastern provinces of the later Empire the state ''archiereis'' combined the roles of ''editor'', Imperial cult priest and ''lanista'', giving ''gladiatoria munera'' in which the use of sharp weapons seems an exceptional honour.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''editor,'' his representative or an honoured guest would check the weapons (''probatio armorum'') for the scheduled matches.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Aurelius encouraged the use of blunted weapons: see Cassius Dio's ''Roman History'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/72*.html#p51 71.29.4].&lt;/ref&gt; These were the highlight of the day, and were as inventive, varied and novel as the ''editor'' could afford. Armatures could be very costly&amp;nbsp;– some were flamboyantly decorated with exotic feathers, jewels and precious metals. Increasingly the ''munus'' was the ''editor'''s gift to spectators who had come to expect the best as their due.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=99–100}}; {{harvnb|Wiedemann|1992|p=14}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combat===
Lightly armed and armoured fighters, such as the [[retiarius]], would tire less rapidly than their heavily armed opponents; most bouts would have lasted 10 to 15 minutes, or 20 minutes at most.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Potter|Mattingly|1999|p=313}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late Republican ''munera'', between 10 and 13 matches could have been fought on one day; this assumes one match at a time in the course of an afternoon.&lt;ref name="Potter and Mattingly, 313" /&gt;

Spectators preferred to watch highly skilled, well matched ''ordinarii'' with complementary fighting styles; these were the most costly to train and to hire. A general ''[[melee]]'' of several, lower-skilled gladiators was far less costly, but also less popular. Even among the ''ordinarii'', match winners might have to fight a new, well-rested opponent, either a ''tertiarius'' ("third choice gladiator") by prearrangement; or a "substitute" gladiator (''suppositicius'') who fought at the whim of the ''editor'' as an unadvertised, unexpected "extra".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|2007|pp=313–314}}&lt;/ref&gt; This yielded two combats for the cost of three gladiators, rather than four; such contests were prolonged, and in some cases, more bloody. Most were probably of poor quality,&lt;ref&gt;Dunkle, Roger, ''Gladiators: Violence and Spectacle in Ancient Rome'', Routledge, 2013, pp. 69 – 71; Dunkle is discussing the use of a ''suppositicius'' (a substitute used only at need, probably to prolong a particular scheduled fight) and a ''tertiarius'', citing Petronius for the latter as offering a poor quality bout.&lt;/ref&gt; but the emperor [[Caracalla]] chose to test a notably skilled and successful fighter named Bato against first one ''supposicitius'', whom he beat, and then another, who killed him.&lt;ref name="Dunkle_2013_p70-71"&gt;Dunkle, Roger, ''Gladiators: Violence and Spectacle in Ancient Rome'', Routledge, 2013, pp. 70 – 71&lt;/ref&gt; At the opposite level of the profession, a gladiator reluctant to confront his opponent might be whipped, or goaded with hot irons, until he engaged through sheer desperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fagan | first = Garrett | year = 2011 | title = The Lure of the Arena: Social Psychology and the Crowd at the Roman Games | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Pp. 217 – 218,  273, 277| isbn = 9780521196161 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Combats between experienced, well trained gladiators demonstrated a considerable degree of stagecraft. Among the cognoscenti, bravado and skill in combat were esteemed over mere hacking and bloodshed; some gladiators made their careers and reputation from bloodless victories. Suetonius describes an exceptional ''munus'' by Nero, in which no-one was killed, "not even ''noxii'' (enemies of the state)."&lt;ref name="Fagan"&gt;{{cite book | last = Fagan | first = Garrett | year = 2011 | title = The Lure of the Arena: Social Psychology and the Crowd at the Roman Games | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Pp. 217 – 218,  273, 277| isbn = 9780521196161 }} Fagan speculates that Nero was perversely defying the crowd's expectations, or perhaps trying to please a different kind of crowd.&lt;/ref&gt;

Trained gladiators were expected to observe professional rules of combat. Most matches employed a senior referee (''summa rudis'') and an assistant, shown in mosaics with long staffs (''rudes'') to caution or separate opponents at some crucial point in the match. Referees were usually retired gladiators whose decisions, judgement and discretion were, for the most part, respected;&lt;ref&gt;Though not always: the gladiator Diodorus blames "murderous Fate and the cunning treachery of the ''summa rudis''" for his death, not his own error in not finishing off his opponent when he had the chance: see Robert, Gladiateurs, no. 79 = SgO 11/02/01&lt;/ref&gt; they could stop bouts entirely, or pause them to allow the combatants rest, refreshment and a rub-down.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=101}}; based on mosaics and a Pompeian tomb relief.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ludi and ''munera'' were accompanied by music, played as interludes, or building to a "frenzied crescendo" during combats, perhaps to heighten the suspense during a gladiator's appeal; blows may have been accompanied by trumpet-blasts.&lt;ref&gt;The gravestones of several musicians and gladiators mention such modulations; see Fagan, pp. 225 – 226, and footnotes.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Coleman"/&gt; The [[Zliten mosaic]] in Libya (circa 80–100 AD) shows musicians playing an accompaniment to provincial games (with gladiators, ''bestiarii'', or ''venatores'' and prisoners attacked by beasts). Their instruments are a long straight trumpet (''[[Lituus|tubicen]]''), a large curved horn (''[[Cornu (horn)|Cornu]]'') and a [[water organ]] (''hydraulis'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wiedemann|1992|pp=15–16}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar representations (musicians, gladiators and ''bestiari'') are found on a tomb relief in [[Pompeii]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wiedemann|1992|p=15}}. Wiedemann is citing Kraus and von Matt's ''Pompei and Herculaneum'', New York, 1975, Fig. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Victory and defeat===
{{See also|Pollice verso}}
A match was won by the gladiator who overcame his opponent, or killed him outright. Victors received the palm branch and an award from the ''editor''. An outstanding fighter might receive a laurel crown and money from an appreciative crowd but for anyone originally condemned ''ad ludum'' the greatest reward was manumission (emancipation), symbolised by the gift of a wooden training sword or staff (''rudis'') from the ''editor''. Martial describes a match between [[Priscus (gladiator)|Priscus]] and [[Verus (gladiator)|Verus]], who fought so evenly and bravely for so long that when both acknowledged defeat at the same instant, [[Titus]] awarded victory and a ''rudis'' to each.&lt;ref&gt;Martial. ''Liber de Spectaculis'', 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Flamma was awarded the ''rudis'' four times, but chose to remain a gladiator. His gravestone in [[Sicily]] includes his record: "Flamma, ''[[secutor]]'', lived 30 years, fought 34 times, won 21 times, fought to a draw 9 times, defeated 4 times, a [[Syria (Roman province)|Syrian]] by nationality. Delicatus made this for his deserving comrade-in-arms."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|2007|p=112}}. Kyle is citing Robert.&lt;/ref&gt;

A gladiator could acknowledge defeat by raising a finger (''ad digitum''), in appeal to the referee to stop the combat and refer to the ''editor'', whose decision would usually rest on the crowd's response.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the earliest ''munera'', death was considered a righteous penalty for defeat; later, those who fought well might be granted remission at the whim of the crowd or the ''editor''. During the Imperial era, matches advertised as ''sine missione'' (without remission from the sentence of death) suggest that ''missio'' (the sparing of a defeated gladiator's life) had become common practice. The contract between ''editor'' and his ''lanista'' could include compensation for unexpected deaths;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=141}}.&lt;/ref&gt; this could be "some fifty times higher than the lease price" of the gladiator.&lt;ref&gt;M. J. Carter, "Gladiatorial Combat: The Rules of Engagement",
''The Classical Journal'', Vol. 102, No. 2 (Dec. – Jan., 2006/2007), p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Augustus' rule, the demand for gladiators began to exceed supply, and matches ''sine missione'' were officially banned; an economical, pragmatic development that happened to match popular notions of "natural justice". When Caligula and Claudius refused to spare defeated but popular fighters, their own popularity suffered. In general, gladiators who fought well were likely to survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=144–145}}. Futrell is citing Suetonius's ''Lives'', "Augustus", 45, "Caligula", 30, "Claudius", 34.&lt;/ref&gt; At a Pompeian match between chariot-fighters, Publius Ostorius, with previous 51 wins to his credit, was granted missio after losing to Scylax, with 26 victories.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=85}}. This is evidenced on a roughly inscribed libellus.&lt;/ref&gt; By common custom, the spectators decided whether or not a losing gladiator should be spared, and chose the winner in the rare event of a standing tie.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=101}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Even more rarely, perhaps uniquely, one stalemate ended in the killing of one gladiator by the ''editor'' himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=102}} (The evidence is on a stylised mosaic from Symmachus; the spectators praise the ''editor'' for "doing the right thing").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barton 2728"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barton|first=Carlin A.|date=1989|title=The Scandal of the Arena|jstor=2928482|journal=Representations|issue=27|pages= 27, 28, note 33|doi=10.2307/2928482}} (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt; In any event, the final decision of death or life belonged to the ''editor'', who signalled his choice with a gesture described by Roman sources as ''[[pollice verso]]'' meaning "with a turned thumb"; a description too imprecise for reconstruction of the gesture or its symbolism. Whether victorious or defeated, a gladiator was bound by oath to accept or implement his editor's decision, "the victor being nothing but the instrument of his [editor's] will."&lt;ref name="Barton 2728"/&gt; Not all ''editors'' chose to go with the crowd, and not all those condemned to death for putting on a poor show chose to submit:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Once a band of five ''[[retiarius|retiarii]]'' in tunics, matched against the same number of ''[[secutores]]'', yielded without a struggle; but when their death was ordered, one of them caught up his trident and slew all the victors. [[Caligula]] bewailed this in a public proclamation as a most cruel murder.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius. ''Lives'', "Caligula", 30.3.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Death and disposal===
A gladiator who was refused ''missio'' was despatched by his opponent. To die well, a gladiator should never ask for mercy, nor cry out.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=140}}. Futrell is citing Cicero's ''Tuscullan Disputations'', 2.17.&lt;/ref&gt; A "good death" redeemed the gladiator from the dishonourable weakness and passivity of defeat, and provided a noble example to those who watched:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wiedemann|1992|pp=38–39}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
For death, when it stands near us, gives even to inexperienced men the courage not to seek to avoid the inevitable. So the gladiator, no matter how faint-hearted he has been throughout the fight, offers his throat to his opponent and directs the wavering blade to the vital spot. (Seneca. ''Epistles'', 30.8)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some mosaics show defeated gladiators kneeling in preparation for the moment of death. Seneca's "vital spot" seems to have meant the neck.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Edwards|2007|pp=66–67}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Gladiator remains from Ephesus confirm this.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Curry|2008}}. Marks on the bones of several gladiators suggest a sword thrust into the base of the throat and down towards the heart.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GladiatorFeldflasche.jpg|thumb|A flask depicting the final phase of the fight between a ''[[murmillo]]'' (winning) and a ''[[thraex]]'']]
The body of a gladiator who had died well was placed on a couch of [[Libitina]] and removed with dignity to the arena morgue, where the corpse was stripped of armour, and probably had its throat cut to prove that dead was dead. The Christian author [[Tertullian]], commenting on ''ludi meridiani'' in Roman [[Carthage]] during the peak era of the games, describes a more humiliating method of removal. One arena official, dressed as the "brother of Jove", [[Dis Pater]] (god of the underworld) strikes the corpse with a mallet. Another, dressed as [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], tests for life-signs with a heated "wand"; once confirmed as dead, the body is dragged from the arena.&lt;ref&gt;By Tertullian's time, Mercury was identified with Greek [[Hermes#Epithets of Hermes|Hermes psychopompos]], who led souls into the underworld.  Tertullian describes these events as examples of hollow impiety, in which Rome's false deities are acceptably impersonated by low and murderous persons for the purposes of human sacrifice and evil entertainment. See {{harvnb|Kyle|1998|pp=155–168}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether these victims were gladiators or ''noxii'' is unknown. Modern pathological examination confirms the probably fatal use of a mallet on some, but not all the gladiator skulls found in a gladiators' cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grossschmidt|Kanz|2006|pp=207–216}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Kyle (1998) proposes that gladiators who disgraced themselves might have been subjected to the same indignities as ''noxii'', denied the relative mercies of a quick death and dragged from the arena as carrion. Whether the corpse of such a gladiator could be redeemed from further ignominy by friends or ''familia'' is not known.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|1998|pp=40, 155–168}}. ''Dis Pater'' and Jupiter Latiaris rituals in Tertullian's ''Ad Nationes'', 1.10.47: Tertullian describes the offering of a fallen gladiator's blood to [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter Latiaris]] by an officiating priest&amp;nbsp;– a travesty of the offering of the blood of martyrs&amp;nbsp;– but places this within a ''munus'' (or a festival) dedicated to Jupiter Latiaris; no such practice is otherwise recorded, and Tertullian may have mistaken or reinterpreted what he saw.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bodies of ''noxii'', and possibly some ''damnati'', were thrown into rivers or dumped unburied;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|1998|p=14 (including note #74)}}. Kyle contextualises Juvenal's ''panem et circenses''&amp;nbsp;– bread and games as a sop to the politically apathetic plebs (Satires, 4.10) &amp;nbsp;– within an account of the death and ''damnatio'' of [[Sejanus]], whose body was torn to pieces by the crowd and left unburied.&lt;/ref&gt; Denial of funeral rites and memorial condemned the shade (''manes'') of the deceased to restless wandering upon the earth as a dreadful ''[[lemures|larva'' or ''lemur]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius. ''Lives'', "Tiberius", 75. Suetonius has the populace wish the same fate on [[Tiberius]]'s body, a form of ''damnatio'': to be thrown in the Tiber, or left unburied, or "dragged with the hook".&lt;/ref&gt; Ordinary citizens, slaves and freedmen were usually buried beyond the town or city limits, to avoid the ritual and physical pollution of the living; professional gladiators had their own, separate cemeteries. The taint of ''infamia'' was perpetual.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|1998|pp=128–159}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Remembrance and epitaphs===
Gladiators could subscribe to a union (''collegia''), which ensured their proper burial, and sometimes a pension or compensation for wives and children. Otherwise, the gladiator's ''familia'', which included his ''lanista'', comrades and blood-kin, might fund his funeral and memorial costs, and use the memorial to assert their moral reputation as responsible, respectful colleagues or family members. Some monuments record the gladiator's career in some detail, including the number of appearances, victories  —  sometimes represented by an engraved crown or wreath  —  defeats, career duration, and age at death. Some include the gladiator's type, in words or direct representation: for example, the memorial of a retiarius at Verona included an engraved trident and sword.&lt;ref name="FIGHTING FOR IDENTITY 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=HOPE|first1=VALERIE|title=FIGHTING FOR IDENTITY: THE FUNERARY COMMEMORATION OF ITALIAN GLADIATORS*|journal=Bulletin of the Institute of Classical Studies|date=January 2000|volume=44|issue=S73|pages=93–113|doi=10.1111/j.2041-5370.2000.tb01940.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=133, 149–153}}. The single name form on a gladiator memorial usually indicates a slave, two a freedman or discharged ''auctoratus'' and, very rare among gladiators, three (''"[[Roman naming conventions|tria nomina]]"'') a freedman or a full Roman citizen. See also [http://www.vroma.org/~bmcmanus/roman_names.html vroma.org] on Roman names.&lt;/ref&gt;  A wealthy editor might commission artwork to celebrate a particularly successful or memorable show, and include named portraits of winners and losers in action; the Borghese [[Gladiator Mosaic]] is a notable example. According to Cassius Dio, the emperor [[Caracalla]] gave the gladiator Bato a magnificent memorial and State funeral;&lt;ref name="Dunkle_2013_p70-71"/&gt; more typical are the simple gladiator tombs of the Eastern Roman Empire, whose brief inscriptions include the following:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The familia set this up in memory of Saturnilos."&lt;br /&gt;
"For Nikepharos, son of Synetos, Lakedaimonian, and for Narcissus the secutor. Titus Flavius Satyrus set up this monument in his memory from his own money."&lt;br /&gt;
"For Hermes. Paitraeites with his cell-mates set this up in memory".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=149}}. Futrell is citing Robert, #12, #24, and #109.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Very little evidence survives of the religious beliefs of gladiators as a class, or their expectations of an afterlife. Modern scholarship offers little support for the once-prevalent notion that gladiators, ''venatores'' and ''bestiarii'' were personally or professionally dedicated to the cult of the Graeco-Roman goddess [[Nemesis (mythology)|Nemesis]]. Rather, she seems to have represented a kind of "Imperial [[Fortuna]]" who dispensed Imperial retribution on the one hand, and Imperially subsidised gifts on the other – including the ''munera''. One gladiator's tomb dedication clearly states that her decisions are not to be trusted.&lt;ref&gt;Nemesis, her devotees and her place in the Roman world are fully discussed, with examples, in Hornum, Michael B., ''Nemesis, the Roman state and the games'', Brill, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Many gladiator epitaphs claim Nemesis, fate, deception or treachery as the instrument of their death, never the superior skills of the flesh-and-blood adversary who defeated and killed them. Having no personal responsibility for his own defeat and death, the losing gladiator remains the better man, worth avenging.&lt;ref&gt;Garrett G. Fagan, ''Gladiators, combatants at games'', Oxford Classical Dictionary online, Jul 2015 DOI: 10.1093/acrefore/9780199381135.013.2845: "This refusal to concede honest defeat in the face of superior skill again speaks to professional pride and a certain braggadocio that is still operative today in combat sports."[http://classics.oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199381135.001.0001/acrefore-9780199381135-e-2845] (accessed April 2, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I, Victor, left-handed, lie here, but my homeland was in Thessalonica. Doom killed me, not the liar Pinnas. No longer let him boast. I had a fellow gladiator, Polyneikes, who killed Pinnas and avenged me. Claudius Thallus set up this memorial from what I left behind as a legacy."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=149}}. Futrell is citing Robert, #34.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Life expectancy===
A gladiator might expect to fight in two or three munera annually, and an unknown number would have died in their first match. Few gladiators survived more than 10 contests, though one survived an extraordinary 150 bouts;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another died at 90 years of age, presumably long after retirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; A natural death following retirement is also likely for three individuals who died at 38, 45, and 48 years respectively.&lt;ref name="FIGHTING FOR IDENTITY 2000"/&gt; George Ville, using evidence from 1st century gladiator headstones, calculated an average age at death of 27, and mortality "among all who entered the arena" at 19/100.&lt;ref name="Futrell 2006 144"&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=144}}. Futrell is citing George Ville.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus Junkelmann disputes Ville's calculation for average age at death; the majority would have received no headstone, and would have died early in their careers, at 18–25 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Junkelmann|2000|p=145}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Between the early and later Imperial periods the risk of death for defeated gladiators rose from 1/5 to 1/4, perhaps because ''missio'' was granted less often.&lt;ref name="Futrell 2006 144"/&gt; Hopkins and Beard tentatively estimate a total of 400 arenas throughout the Roman Empire at its greatest extent, with a combined total of 8,000 deaths per annum from executions, combats and accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hopkins|Beard|2005|pp=92–94}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schools and training==
The earliest named gladiator school (singular: ''ludus''; plural: ''ludi'') is that of Aurelius Scaurus at Capua. He was ''lanista'' of the gladiators employed by the state circa 105 BC to instruct the legions and simultaneously entertain the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|2007|p=238}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Few other ''lanistae'' are known by name: they headed their ''familia gladiatoria'', and had lawful power over life and death of every family member, including ''servi poenae'', ''auctorati'' and ancillaries. Socially, they were ''infames'', on a footing with pimps and butchers and despised as price gougers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=85, 149}}; {{harvnb|Auguet|1994|p=31}}.&lt;/ref&gt; No such stigma was attached to a gladiator owner (''munerarius'' or ''editor'') of good family, high status and independent means;&lt;ref&gt;Ulpian. ''Edict'', Book 6; {{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=137–138}}. Futrell is citing ''Digest'', 3.1.1.6.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cicero]] congratulated his friend Atticus on buying a splendid troop&amp;nbsp;– if he rented them out, he might recover their entire cost after two performances.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero. ''Letters,'' 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Third Servile War|Spartacus revolt]] had originated in a gladiator school privately owned by [[Lentulus Batiatus]], and had been suppressed only after a protracted series of costly, sometimes disastrous campaigns by regular Roman troops. In the late Republican era, a fear of similar uprisings, the usefulness of gladiator schools in creating private armies, and the exploitation of ''munera'' for political gain led to increased restrictions on gladiator school ownership, siting and organisation. By [[Domitian]]'s time, many had been more or less absorbed by the State, including those at [[Pergamum]], [[Alexandria]], [[Praeneste]] and Capua.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|2007|pp=285–287, 312}}. This had probably began under Augustus.&lt;/ref&gt; The city of Rome itself had four; the ''[[Ludus Magnus]]'' (the largest and most important, housing up to about 2,000 gladiators), ''[[Ludus Dacicus]]'', ''Ludus Gallicus'', and the ''Ludus Matutinus'', which trained ''bestiarii''.&lt;ref name="Kyle 1998 80" /&gt;

In the Imperial era, volunteers required a magistrate's permission to join a school as ''auctorati''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=103}}. Futrell is citing Petronius's ''Satyricon'', 45.133.&lt;/ref&gt; If this was granted, the school's physician assessed their suitability. Their contract (''auctoramentum'') stipulated how often they were to perform, their fighting style and earnings. A condemned bankrupt or debtor accepted as novice (''novicius'') could negotiate with his  ''lanista'' or ''editor'' for the partial or complete payment of his debt. Faced with runaway re-enlistment fees for skilled ''auctorati'', Marcus Aurelius set their upper limit at 12,000 ''[[sesterces]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=133}}. See also Tiberius's inducement to re-enlist.&lt;/ref&gt;

All prospective gladiators, whether volunteer or condemned, were bound to service by a sacred oath (''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#sacramentum|sacramentum]]'').&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Petronius. ''Satyricon'', 117: "He vows to endure to be burned, to be bound, to be beaten, and to be killed by the sword."&lt;/ref&gt; Novices (''novicii'') trained under teachers of particular fighting styles, probably retired gladiators.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=138}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They could ascend through a hierarchy of grades (singular: ''palus'') in which ''primus palus'' was the highest.&lt;ref&gt;''palus'': named after the training poles, 6 Roman feet high, erected in the training arena.&lt;/ref&gt; Lethal weapons were prohibited in the schools&amp;nbsp;– weighted, blunt wooden versions were probably used. Fighting styles were probably learned through constant rehearsal as choreographed "numbers". An elegant, economical style was preferred. Training included preparation for a stoical, unflinching death. Successful training required intense commitment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=137}}. Futrell is citing Quintilian's ''Oratorical Institute'', 5.13.54; {{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=140}}. Futrell is citing Cicero's ''Tuscullan Disputations'', 2.17; {{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=139}}. Futrell is citing Epictetus's ''Discourse'', 3.15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Those condemned ''ad ludum'' were probably [[Human branding|branded]] or marked with a [[History of tattooing|tattoo]] (''stigma'', plural ''stigmata'') on the face, legs and/or hands. These ''stigmata'' may have been text&amp;nbsp;– slaves were sometimes thus marked on the forehead until Constantine banned the use of facial stigmata in 325 AD. Soldiers were routinely marked on the hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1987|pp=139–155}}. Facial ''stigmata'' represented extreme social degradation.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gladiators were typically accommodated in cells, arranged in barrack formation around a central practice arena. [[Juvenal]] describes the segregation of gladiators according to type and status, suggestive of rigid hierarchies within the schools: "even the lowest scum of the arena observe this rule; even in prison they're separate". &lt;!-- In the following sentence, phrases in quote-marks are verbatim from English-language source. Please do not remove or substitute for "fag", unless you're prepared to find and cite another translation of the Juvenal passage from a reliable source  --&gt;''Retiarii'' were kept away from ''damnati'', and "fag targeteers" from "armoured heavies". As most ''ordinarii'' at games were from the same school, this kept potential opponents separate and safe from each other until the lawful ''munus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=142}}. Futrell is citing Juvenal's ''Satire'', 6 [Oxford Fragment 7.13], in the translation of [[Peter Green (historian)|Peter Green]].&lt;/ref&gt; Discipline could be extreme, even lethal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=17}}. The burning alive of a soldier who refused to become an ''auctoratus'' at a Spanish school in 43 BC is exceptional only because he was a citizen, technically exempt from such compulsion and penalty.&lt;/ref&gt; Remains of a Pompeian ''ludus'' site attest to developments in supply, demand and discipline; in its earliest phase, the building could accommodate 15–20 gladiators. Its replacement could have housed about 100 and included a very small cell, probably for lesser punishments and so low that standing was impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=148–149}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diet and medical care===
[[File:Gladiadores después del combate, por José Moreno Carbonero.jpg|thumb|''Gladiators after the fight'', [[José Moreno Carbonero]] (1882)]]
Despite the harsh discipline, gladiators represented a substantial investment for their ''lanista'' and were otherwise well fed and cared for. Their daily, high-energy, [[vegetarian]] diet consisted of [[barley]], boiled [[beans]], [[oatmeal]], ash and [[dried fruit]]. Gladiators were sometimes called ''hordearii'' ("eaters of barley)". Romans considered barley inferior to [[wheat]]&amp;nbsp;— a punishment for [[legionaries]] replaced their wheat ration with it&amp;nbsp;— but it was thought to strengthen the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Follain|first=John|title=The dying game: How did the gladiators really live?|work=Times Online|date=15 December 2002|accessdate=24 March 2009|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/article1069977.ece|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429085905/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/article1069977.ece|archivedate=29 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regular massage and high quality medical care helped mitigate an otherwise very severe training regimen. Part of [[Galen]]'s medical training was at a gladiator school in Pergamum where he saw (and would later criticise) the training, diet, and long term health prospects of the gladiators.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=141–142}}; {{harvnb|Carter|2004|pp=41–68}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal and social status==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"He vows to endure to be burned, to be bound, to be beaten, and to be killed by the sword." ''The gladiator's oath as cited by Petronius (Satyricon, 117).''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Modern customs and institutions offer few useful parallels to the legal and social context of the ''gladiatoria munera''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Borkowski|du Plessis|2005|p=80}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In Roman law, anyone condemned to the arena or the gladiator schools (''damnati ad ludum'') was a ''servus poenae'' (slave of the penalty), and was considered to be under sentence of death unless manumitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Borkowski|du Plessis|2005}}. Manumission was seldom absolute. Terms of release were negotiated between master and slave; ''Digests'' 28.3.6.5–6 and 48.19.8.11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[rescript]] of Hadrian reminded magistrates that "those sentenced to the sword" (execution) should be despatched immediately "or at least within the year", and those sentenced to the ''ludi'' should not be discharged before five years, or three years if granted [[manumission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=123}}. Futrell is citing Ulpian's 8th book of Proconsular Functions, ''CMRL'', 11.7.&lt;/ref&gt; Only slaves found guilty of specific offences could be sentenced to the arena; however, citizens found guilty of particular offenses could be stripped of citizenship, formally enslaved, then sentenced; and slaves, once freed, could be legally reverted to slavery for certain offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Richlin|1992|loc=Shelby Brown, "Death as Decoration: Scenes of the Arena on Roman Domestic Mosaics", p. 185}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Arena punishment could be given for banditry, theft and arson, and for treasons such as rebellion, census evasion to avoid paying due taxes and refusal to swear lawful oaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Borkowski|du Plessis|2005|loc=Preface, p. 81}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Offenders seen as particularly obnoxious to the state (''noxii'') received the most humiliating punishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coleman|1990|p=46}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1st century BC, ''noxii'' were being condemned to the beasts (''[[damnati ad bestias]]'') in the arena, with almost no chance of survival, or were made to kill each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wiedemann|1992|pp=40–46}}.&lt;/ref&gt; From the early Imperial era, some were forced to participate in humiliating and novel forms of mythological or historical enactment, culminating in their execution.&lt;ref&gt;Apuleius. ''Metamorphoses'', 4.13; {{harvnb|Coleman|1990|p=71}}; {{harvnb|Richlin|1992|loc=Shelby Brown, "Death as Decoration: Scenes of the Arena on Roman Domestic Mosaics", p. 185}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Those judged less harshly might be condemned ''ad ludum venatorium'' or ''ad gladiatorium''&amp;nbsp;– combat with animals or gladiators&amp;nbsp;– and armed as thought appropriate. These ''damnati'' at least might put on a good show and retrieve some respect, and very rarely, survive to fight another day. Some may even have become "proper" gladiators.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|1998|p=94}}. Survival and "promotion" would have been extremely rare for ''damnati''&amp;nbsp;– and unheard of for ''noxii''&amp;nbsp;– notwithstanding [[Aulus Gellius]]'s moral tale of [[Androcles]].&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Painting from the Amphitheatre. Hunter with lioness - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Mérida amphitheatre]], Spain; mural of beast hunt, showing a [[Venatio|venator]] (or [[Bestiarii|bestiarius]]) and lioness]]
Among the most admired and skilled ''auctorati'' were those who, having been granted manumission, volunteered to fight in the arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Richlin|1992|loc=Shelby Brown, "Death as Decoration: Scenes of the Arena on Roman Domestic Mosaics", p. 186}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these highly trained and experienced specialists may have had no other practical choice open to them. Their legal status – slave or free – is uncertain. Under Roman law, a freed gladiator could not "offer such services [as those of a gladiator] after manumission, because they cannot be performed without endangering [his] life."&lt;ref&gt;D.38.1.38 pr in {{harvnb|Borkowski|du Plessis|2005|p=95}}.&lt;/ref&gt; All contracted volunteers, including those of equestrian and senatorial class, were legally enslaved by their ''auctoratio'' because it involved their potentially lethal submission to a master.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=157}}.&lt;/ref&gt; All ''arenarii'' (those who appeared in the arena) were "''[[infamia|infames]]'' by reputation", a form of social dishonour which excluded them from most of the advantages and rights of citizenship. Payment for such appearances compounded their ''infamia''.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, William. ''A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities''. London: John Murray, 1875, "[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Infamia.html Roman Law&amp;nbsp;– Infamia]".&lt;/ref&gt; The legal and social status of even the most popular and wealthy ''auctorati'' was thus marginal at best. They could not vote, plead in court nor leave a will; and unless they were manumitted, their lives and property belonged to their masters.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=131}}. Futrell is citing Tertullian's ''De Speculates'', 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, there is evidence of informal if not entirely lawful practices to the contrary. Some "unfree" gladiators bequeathed money and personal property to wives and children, possibly via a sympathetic owner or ''familia''; some had their own slaves and gave them their freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=86–87}}. Futrell is citing Plutarch's ''Moral Essays'', 1099B.&lt;/ref&gt; One gladiator was even granted "citizenship" to several Greek cities of the Eastern Roman world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carter|2004|pp=52–56}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Caesar's ''munus'' of 46 BC included at least one equestrian, son of a Praetor, and two volunteers of possible senatorial rank.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barton|1993|p=25}}. Barton is citing Cassius Dio, 43.23.4–5; Suetonius, in ''Caesar'' 39.1, adds the two Senators.&lt;/ref&gt; Augustus, who enjoyed watching the games, forbade the participation of senators, equestrians and their descendants as fighters or ''arenarii'', but in 11 AD he bent his own rules and allowed equestrians to volunteer because "the prohibition was no use".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barton|1993|p=25}}. Barton is citing Cassius Dio, 56.25.7.&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Tiberius]], the Larinum decree&lt;ref&gt;David Potter (trans.), "[http://wSalii|priest of Marsww.umich.edu/~classics/programs/class/cc/372/sibyl/db/E012.html The Senatus Consultum from Larinium]".&lt;/ref&gt; (19AD) reiterated Augustus' original prohibitions. Thereafter, [[Caligula]] flouted them and [[Claudius]] strengthened them.&lt;ref&gt;Under Caligula, participation by men and women of senatorial rank may have been encouraged, and sometimes enforced; Cassius Dio, 59.10, 13–14 and Tacitus, ''Caligula'', 15.32.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nero]] and [[Commodus]] ignored them. Even after the adoption of Christianity as Rome's official religion, legislation forbade the involvement of Rome's upper social classes in the games, though not the games themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=153}}. Futrell is citing Cassius Dio, 62.17.3; see Cassius Dio, 59.10.13–14 and Tacitus's ''Caligula'', 15.32 for Caligula's extraordinary behaviour as ''editor''; ''Valentinian/Theodosius'', 15.9.1; Symacchus, ''Relatio,'' 8.3.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout Rome's history, some volunteers were prepared to risk loss of status or reputation by appearing in the arena, whether for payment, glory or, as in one recorded case, to revenge an affront to their personal honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|1998|pp=115–116 (Note #102)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=153, 156}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one extraordinary episode, an aristocratic descendant of the [[Gracchi]], already infamous for his marriage, as a bride, to a male horn player, appeared in what may have been a non-lethal or farcical match. His motives are unknown, but his voluntary and "shameless" arena appearance combined the "womanly attire" of a lowly ''[[retiarius|retiarius tunicatus]]'', adorned with golden ribbons, with the [[Apex (headdress)|apex]] headdress that marked him out as a [[Salii|priest of Mars]]. In Juvenal's account, he seems to have relished the scandalous self-display, applause and the disgrace he inflicted on his more sturdy opponent by repeatedly skipping away from the confrontation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barton|1993|p=26}}. Barton is citing Juvenal, 8.199ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cerutti |first1=Steven M. |last2=Richardson |first2=L. |title=The Retiarius Tunicatus of Suetonius, Juvenal, and Petronius |journal=The American Journal of Philology |date=1989 |volume=110 |issue=4 |pages=589 |doi=10.2307/295282 |jstor=295282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amphitheatres==
{{Main|List of Roman amphitheatres}}
[[File:Colosseum in Rome, Italy - April 2007.jpg|thumb|The [[Colosseum]] in [[Rome]], [[Italy]]]]

As ''munera'' grew larger and more popular, open spaces such as the [[Forum Romanum]] were adapted (as the Forum Boarium had been) as venues in Rome and elsewhere, with temporary, elevated seating for the patron and high status spectators; they were popular but not truly public events:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A show of gladiators was to be exhibited before the people in the market-place, and most of the magistrates erected scaffolds round about, with an intention of letting them for advantage. [[Gaius Gracchus|Caius]] commanded them to take down their scaffolds, that the poor people might see the sport without paying anything. But nobody obeying these orders of his, he gathered together a body of labourers, who worked for him, and overthrew all the scaffolds the very night before the contest was to take place. So that by the next morning the market-place was cleared, and the common people had an opportunity of seeing the pastime. In this, the populace thought he had acted the part of a man; but he much disobliged the tribunes his colleagues, who regarded it as a piece of violent and presumptuous interference.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch. ''Caius Gracchus'', [http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/gracchus.html 12.3–4].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Some Roman writers interpret the earliest attempts to provide permanent venues as populist political graft, rightly blocked by the Senate as morally objectionable; too-frequent, excessively "luxurious" ''munera'' would corrode traditional Roman values. The provision of permanent seating was thought a particularly objectionable luxury. See Appian, ''The Civil Wars'', 128; Livy, ''Perochiae'', 48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Towards the end of the Republic, Cicero (''Murena'', 72–3) still describes gladiator shows as ticketed&amp;nbsp;— their political usefulness was served by inviting the rural tribunes of the plebs, not the people of Rome ''en masse'' – but in Imperial times, poor citizens in receipt of the [[Grain supply to the city of Rome|corn dole]] were allocated at least some free seating, possibly by lottery.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mouritsen|2001|p=82}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Others had to pay. [[Ticket resale|Ticket scalpers]] (''Locarii'') sometimes sold or let out seats at inflated prices. [[Martial]] wrote that "Hermes [a gladiator who always drew the crowds] means riches for the ticket scalpers".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=136}}. Futrell is citing Martial's ''Epigrams'', 5.24.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known Roman amphitheatre was built at [[Pompeii]] by [[Sulla]]n colonists, around 70 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=197}}. Welch is citing ''CIL'', X.852.&lt;/ref&gt; The first in the city of Rome was the extraordinary wooden amphitheatre of [[Gaius Scribonius Curio#Son|Gaius Scribonius Curio]] (built in 53 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Potter|Mattingly|1999|p=226}}. Potter and Mattingly are citing Pliny the Elder, 36.117.&lt;/ref&gt; The first part-stone amphitheatre in Rome was inaugurated in 29–30 BC, in time for the triple triumph of Octavian (later Augustus).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Potter|Mattingly|1999|p=226}} (see also Pliny's ''Natural History'', 36.113–5). The amphitheatre was commissioned by T. Statilius Taurus. According to Pliny, its three storeys were marble-clad, housed 3,000 bronze statues and seated 80,000 spectators. It was probably wooden-framed in part.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after it burned down in 64 AD, [[Vespasian]] began its replacement, later known as the Amphitheatrum Flavium ([[Colosseum]]), which seated 50,000 spectators and would remain the largest in the Empire. It was [[Inaugural games of the Flavian Amphitheatre|inaugurated]] by [[Titus]] in 80 AD as the personal gift of the Emperor to the people of Rome, paid for by the imperial share of booty after the [[First Jewish–Roman War|Jewish Revolt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mattern|2002|pp=151–152}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:arlesarena.jpg|thumb|left|Roman arena at [[Arles]], inside view]]
Amphitheatres were usually oval in plan. Their seating tiers surrounded the arena below, where the community's judgments were meted out, in full public view. From across the stands, crowd and ''editor'' could assess each other's character and temperament. For the crowd, amphitheatres afforded unique opportunities for free expression and free speech (''theatralis licentia''). Petitions could be submitted to the ''editor'' (as magistrate) in full view of the community. ''Factiones'' and claques could vent their spleen on each other, and occasionally on Emperors. The emperor Titus's dignified yet confident ease in his management of an amphitheatre crowd and its factions were taken as a measure of his enormous popularity and the rightness of his imperium. The amphitheatre ''munus'' thus served the Roman community as living theatre and a court in miniature, in which judgement could be served not only on those in the arena below, but on their judges.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Richlin|1992|loc=Shelby Brown, "Death As Decoration: Scenes of the Arena on Roman Domestic Mosaics", pp. 184–185}}. Even emperors who disliked ''munera'' were thus obliged to attend them.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=37–42, 105}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|1998|p=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Amphitheatres also provided a means of social control. Their seating was "disorderly and indiscriminate" until [[Augustus]] prescribed its arrangement in his Social Reforms. To persuade the Senate, he expressed his distress on behalf of a Senator who could not find seating at a crowded games in [[Pozzuoli|Puteoli]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In consequence of this the senate decreed that, whenever any public show was given anywhere, the first row of seats should be reserved for senators; and at Rome he would not allow the envoys of the free and allied nations to sit in the orchestra, since he was informed that even freedmen were sometimes appointed. He separated the soldiery from the people. He assigned special seats to the married men of the commons, to boys under age their own section and the adjoining one to their preceptors; and he decreed that no one wearing a dark cloak should sit in the middle of the house. He would not allow women to view even the gladiators except from the upper seats, though it had been the custom for men and women to sit together at such shows. Only the Vestal virgins were assigned a place to themselves, opposite the praetor's tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius. ''Lives'', "Augustus", 44.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These arrangements do not seem to have been strongly enforced.&lt;ref name="Futrell 205"&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Factions and rivals===
[[File:Pompeii - Battle at the Amphitheatre - MAN.jpg|thumb|The Amphitheatre at [[Pompeii]], depicting the riot between the [[Nocera Inferiore|Nucerians]] and the [[Pompeian]]s]]

Popular factions supported favourite gladiators and gladiator types.&lt;ref&gt;Examples are in Martial's ''Epigrams'' 14, 213 and Suetonius's ''Caligula''.&lt;/ref&gt; Under Augustan legislation, the Samnite type was renamed ''[[Secutor]]'' ("chaser", or "pursuer"). The secutor was equipped with a long, heavy "large" shield called a ''[[Scutum (shield)|scutum]]''); ''Secutores'', their supporters and any heavyweight ''secutor''-based types such as the [[Murmillo]] were ''[[secutor|secutarii]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Also ''scutarii'', ''scutularii'', or ''secutoriani''.&lt;/ref&gt; Lighter types, such as the [[Thraex]], were equipped with a smaller, lighter shield called a ''[[Parma (shield)|parma]]'', from which they and their supporters were named ''parmularii'' ("small shields"). Titus and Trajan preferred the ''parmularii'' and Domitian the ''secutarii''; Marcus Aurelius took neither side. Nero seems to have enjoyed the brawls between rowdy, enthusiastic and sometimes violent factions, but called in the troops if they went too far.&lt;ref name="Futrell, 96, 104, 105"&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=96,104–105}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|1998|p=111}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also local rivalries. At Pompeii's amphitheatre, during Nero's reign, the trading of insults between Pompeians and [[Nuceria]]n spectators during public ''ludi'' led to stone throwing and riot. Many were killed or wounded. Nero banned gladiator ''munera'' (though not the games) at Pompeii for ten years as punishment. The story is told in Pompeian graffiti and high quality wall painting, with much boasting of Pompeii's "victory" over Nuceria.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|pp=107–108}}. See also Tacitus's ''Annals'', 14.17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in Roman life==
===Role in the military===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A man who knows how to conquer in war is a man who knows how to arrange a banquet and put on a show.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 45.32–3.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rome was essentially a landowning military aristocracy. From the early days of the Republic, ten years of military service were a citizen's duty and a prerequisite for election to public office. ''[[Devotio]]'' (willingness to sacrifice one’s life to the greater good) was central to the Roman military ideal, and was the core of the Roman military oath. It applied from highest to lowest alike in the chain of command.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|1998|p=81}}. It was notably fulfilled and celebrated in the battlefield ''devotio'' of two consular [[:Category:Decii|Decii]]; firstly by [[Publius Decius Mus (340 BC)|the father]] and later by his [[Publius Decius Mus (312 BC)|son]].&lt;/ref&gt; As a soldier committed his life (voluntarily, at least in theory) to the greater cause of Rome's victory, he was not expected to survive defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Edwards|2007|pp=19–45}}; Livy, 22.51.5–8, has wounded Romans at Cannae stretch out their necks for the death blow by comrades: ''cf'' Cicero's death in Seneca's ''Suasoriae'', 6.17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Punic Wars of the late 3rd century BC&amp;nbsp;– in particular the near-catastrophic defeat of Roman arms at Cannae&amp;nbsp;– had long-lasting effects on the Republic, its citizen armies, and the development of the gladiatorial ''munera''. In the aftermath of Cannae, Scipio Africanus crucified Roman deserters and had non-Roman deserters thrown to the beasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=17}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate refused to ransom Hannibal's Roman captives: instead, they consulted the [[Sibylline books]], then made drastic preparations:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In obedience to the Books of Destiny, some strange and unusual sacrifices were made, human sacrifices amongst them. A Gaulish man and a Gaulish woman and a Greek man and a Greek woman were buried alive under the Forum Boarium&amp;nbsp;... They were lowered into a stone vault, which had on a previous occasion also been polluted by human victims, a practice most repulsive to Roman feelings. When the gods were believed to be duly propitiated&amp;nbsp;... Armour, weapons, and other things of the kind were ordered to be in readiness, and the ancient spoils gathered from the enemy were taken down from the temples and colonnades. The dearth of freemen necessitated a new kind of enlistment; 8,000 sturdy youths from amongst the slaves were armed at the public cost, after they had each been asked whether they were willing to serve or no. These soldiers were preferred, as there would be an opportunity of ransoming them when taken prisoners at a lower price.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 22.55–57.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Kourion10.jpg|thumb|190px|Late 3rd century gladiator mosaic from a private residence in [[Kourion]], [[Cyprus]]. All the participants are named, including the referee]]
The account notes, uncomfortably, the bloodless human sacrifices performed to help turn the tide of the war in Rome's favour. While the Senate mustered their willing slaves, Hannibal offered his dishonoured Roman captives a chance for honourable death, in what Livy describes as something very like the Roman ''munus''. The ''munus'' thus represented an essentially military, self-sacrificial ideal, taken to extreme fulfillment in the gladiator's oath.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;  By the ''devotio'' of a voluntary oath, a slave might achieve the quality of a Roman (''Romanitas''), become the embodiment of true ''virtus'' (manliness, or manly virtue), and paradoxically, be granted ''missio'' while remaining a slave.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; The gladiator as a specialist fighter, and the ethos and organization of the gladiator schools, would inform the development of the Roman military as the most effective force of its time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barton|1993|p=15}}; {{harvnb|Kyle|2007|p=274}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 107 BC, the [[Gaius Marius|Marian]] Reforms established the Roman army as a professional body. Two years later, following its defeat at Arausio:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
...weapons training was given to soldiers by P. Rutilius, consul with C. Mallis. For he, following the example of no previous general, with teachers summoned from the gladiatorial training school of C. Aurelus Scaurus, implanted in the legions a more sophisticated method of avoiding and dealing a blow and mixed bravery with skill and skill back again with virtue so that skill became stronger by bravery's passion and passion became more wary with the knowledge of this art.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The military were great aficionados of the games, and supervised the schools. Many schools and amphitheatres were sited at or near military barracks, and some provincial army units owned gladiator troupes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wiedemann|1992|p=45}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As the Republic wore on, the term of military service increased from ten to the sixteen years formalised by Augustus in the Principate. It would rise to twenty, and later, to twenty five years. Roman military discipline was ferocious; severe enough to provoke mutiny, despite the consequences. A career as a volunteer gladiator may have seemed an attractive option for some.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mattern|2002|pp=126–128}}. Mattern is citing Tacitus's ''Annals'', 1.17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In AD 69, the [[Year of the Four Emperors]], [[Otho]]'s troops at [[Bedriacum]] included 2000 gladiators. Opposite him on the field, [[Vitellius]]'s army was swollen by levies of slaves, plebs and gladiators.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mattern|2002|p=87}}. Mattern is citing Cassius Dio, 72, 73.2.3.&lt;/ref&gt; In 167 AD, troop depletions by plague and desertion may have prompted Marcus Aurelius to draft gladiators at his own expense.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mattern|2002|p=87}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Civil Wars that led to the Principate, Octavian (later Augustus) acquired the personal gladiator troop of his erstwhile opponent, Mark Antony. They had served their late master with exemplary loyalty but thereafter, they disappear from the record.&lt;ref name="Futrell, 129: citing Dio" /&gt;

===Religion, ethics and sentiment===
Roman writing as a whole demonstrates a deep ambivalence towards the ''gladiatoria munera''. Even the most complex and sophisticated ''munera'' of the Imperial era evoked the ancient, ancestral ''dii manes'' of the underworld and were framed by the protective, lawful rites of ''sacrificium''. Their popularity made their co-option by the state inevitable; [[Cicero]] acknowledged their sponsorship as a political imperative.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=16}}. Futrell is citing Cicero's ''Letters to Friends'', 2.3.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the popular adulation of gladiators, they were set apart, despised; and despite Cicero's contempt for the mob, he shared their admiration: "Even when [gladiators] have been felled, let alone when they are standing and fighting, they never disgrace themselves. And suppose a gladiator has been brought to the ground, when do you ever see one twist his neck away after he has been ordered to extend it for the death blow?" His own death would later emulate this example.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero's admiration: ''Tusculan Disputations'', 2.41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barton|1993|p=39}}. Barton is citing Seneca's ''Suasoriae'', 6.17 for Cicero's death.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, Cicero could also refer to his popularist opponent [[Publius Clodius Pulcher|Clodius]], publicly and scathingly, as a ''bustuarius''&amp;nbsp;– literally, a "funeral-man", implying that Clodius has shown the moral temperament of the lowest sort of gladiator. "Gladiator" could be (and was) used as an insult throughout the Roman period, and "Samnite" doubled the insult, despite the popularity of the Samnite type.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|2007|p=273}}. For ''bustuarius'', with reference to Clodius's alleged impious disturbance at the funeral of [[Gaius Marius|Marius]], see Cicero's ''In Pisonem'' (Against Piso). See {{harvnb|Bagnani|1956|p=26}}, for the bustuarius as a lower class of gladiator than one employed in the public ''munus''. Cicero's unflattering references to Marcus Antonius as ''gladiator'' are in his 2nd Philippic.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Silius Italicus]] wrote, as the games approached their peak, that the degenerate [[Campania#Ancient tribes and Samnite Wars|Campanians]] had devised the very worst of precedents, which now threatened the moral fabric of Rome: "It was their custom to enliven their banquets with bloodshed and to combine with their feasting the horrid sight of armed men [(Samnites)] fighting; often the combatants fell dead above the very cups of the revelers, and the tables were stained with streams of blood. Thus demoralised was Capua."&lt;ref&gt;Silius Italicus, 11.51 (cited in {{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=3}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Death could be rightly meted out as punishment, or met with equanimity in peace or war, as a gift of fate; but when inflicted as entertainment, with no underlying moral or religious purpose, it could only pollute and demean those who witnessed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Richlin|1992|loc=Shelby Brown, "Death As Decoration: Scenes of the Arena on Roman Domestic Mosaics", p. 185}}. Tacitus, in ''Annals'' 15.44, describes the public repugnance towards Nero's punishment of Christians, which seemed based on his appetite for cruelty, rather than a desire for the public good.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Retiarius vs secutor from Borghese mosaic.jpg|thumb|210px|Detail of the [[Gladiator Mosaic]], 4th century AD]]

The ''munus'' itself could be interpreted as pious necessity, but its increasing luxury corroded Roman virtue, and created an un-Roman appetite for profligacy and self-indulgence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=4}}. Roman commentators associated ''munera'' with Capua's proverbial luxury and excess.&lt;/ref&gt; Caesar's 46 BC ''ludi'' were mere entertainment for political gain, a waste of lives and of money that would have been better doled out to his legionary veterans.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, 43.24.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet for Seneca, and for Marcus Aurelius&amp;nbsp;– both professed [[Stoics]]&amp;nbsp;– the degradation of gladiators in the ''munus'' highlighted their Stoic virtues: their unconditional obedience to their master and to fate, and equanimity in the face of death. Having "neither hope nor illusions", the gladiator could transcend his own debased nature, and disempower death itself by meeting it face to face. Courage, dignity, altruism and loyalty were morally redemptive; [[Lucian]] idealised this principle in his story of Sisinnes, who voluntarily fought as a gladiator, earned 10,000 drachmas and used it to buy freedom for his friend, Toxaris.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barton|1993|p=16}}; {{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=154}}. Futrell is citing Lucian's ''Toxaris'', 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt; Seneca had a lower opinion of the mob's un-Stoical appetite for ''ludi meridiani'': "Man [is]...now slaughtered for jest and sport; and those whom it used to be unholy to train for the purpose of inflicting and enduring wounds are thrust forth exposed and defenceless."&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;

These accounts seek a higher moral meaning from the ''munus'', but [[Ovid]]'s very detailed (though satirical) instructions for seduction in the amphitheatre suggest that the spectacles could generate a potent and dangerously sexual atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Futrell 205"/&gt; Augustan seating prescriptions placed women&amp;nbsp;– excepting the Vestals, who were legally inviolate&amp;nbsp;– as far as possible from the action of the arena floor; or tried to. There remained the thrilling possibility of clandestine sexual transgression by high-caste spectators and their heroes of the arena. Such assignations were a source for gossip and satire but some became unforgivably public:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|1998|p=85}}. This should be considered scandalous and noteworthy, rather than common.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
What was the youthful charm that so fired Eppia? What hooked her? What did she see in him to make her put up with being called "the gladiator's moll"? Her poppet, her Sergius, was no chicken, with a dud arm that prompted hope of early retirement. Besides his face looked a proper mess, helmet-scarred, a great wart on his nose, an unpleasant discharge always trickling from one eye. But he was a gladiator. That word makes the whole breed seem handsome, and made her prefer him to her children and country, her sister, her husband. Steel is what they fall in love with.&lt;ref&gt;Juvenal. ''Satires'', 6.102ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Eppia&amp;nbsp;– a senator's wife&amp;nbsp;– and her Sergius eloped to Egypt, where he deserted her. Most gladiators would have aimed lower. Two wall ''[[graffiti]]'' in Pompeii describe Celadus the Thraex as "the sigh of the girls" and "the glory of the girls"&amp;nbsp;– which may or may not have been Celadus' own wishful thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Futrell|2006|p=146}}. Futrell is citing ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum]]'', 4.4342 and 4.4345.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the later Imperial era, Servius Maurus Honoratus uses the same disparaging term as Cicero&amp;nbsp;– ''bustuarius''&amp;nbsp;– for gladiators.&lt;ref&gt;Servius. ''Commentary on the "Aeneid" of Vergil'', 10.519.&lt;/ref&gt; Tertullian used it somewhat differently&amp;nbsp;– all victims of the arena were sacrificial in his eyes&amp;nbsp;– and expressed the paradox of the ''arenarii'' as a class, from a Christian viewpoint:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
On the one and the same account they glorify them and they degrade and diminish them; yes, further, they openly condemn them to disgrace and civil degradation; they keep them religiously excluded from council chamber, rostrum, senate, knighthood, and every other kind of office and a good many distinctions. The perversity of it! They love whom they lower; they despise whom they approve; the art they glorify, the artist they disgrace.&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian. ''De Spectaculis'', 22; {{harvnb|Kyle|1998|p=80}}. ''Bustuarius'' is found in Tertullian's ''De Spectaculis'', 11.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===In Roman art and culture===
[[File:Borghese gladiator 1 mosaic dn r2 c2.jpg|thumb|Part of the [[Gladiator Mosaic]], displayed at the [[Galleria Borghese]]. It dates from approximately 320 AD. The Ø symbol (possibly Greek [[theta]], for [[thanatos]]) marks a gladiator killed in combat.]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In this new Play, I attempted to follow the old custom of mine, of making a fresh trial; I brought it on again. In the first Act I pleased; when in the meantime a rumor spread that gladiators were about to be exhibited; the populace flock together, make a tumult, clamor aloud, and fight for their places: meantime, I was unable to maintain my place.&lt;ref&gt;Terence. ''Hecyra'', Prologue II.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Images of gladiators could be found throughout the Republic and Empire, among all classes. Walls in the 2nd century BC "Italian [[Agora]]" at [[Delos]] were decorated with paintings of gladiators. Mosaics dating from the 2nd through 4th centuries AD have been invaluable in the reconstruction of combat and its rules, gladiator types and the development of the ''munus''. Throughout the Roman world, ceramics, lamps, gems and jewellery, mosaics, reliefs, wall paintings and statuary offer evidence, sometimes the best evidence, of the clothing, props, equipment, names, events, prevalence and rules of gladiatorial combat. Earlier periods provide only occasional, perhaps exceptional examples.&lt;ref name="Brown, 181"&gt;{{harvnb|Richlin|1992|loc=Shelby Brown, "Death As Decoration: Scenes of the Arena on Roman Domestic Mosaics", p. 181}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gladiator Mosaic]] in the [[Galleria Borghese]] displays several gladiator types, and the [[Bignor Roman Villa]] mosaic from [[Roman Britain|Provincial Britain]] shows [[Cupid]]s as gladiators. Souvenir ceramics were produced depicting named gladiators in combat; similar images of higher quality, were available on more expensive articles in high quality ceramic, glass or silver.

[[Pliny the Elder]] gives vivid examples of the popularity of gladiator portraiture in [[Antium]] and an artistic treat laid on by an adoptive aristocrat for the solidly plebeian citizens of the Roman [[Aventine Hill|Aventine]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
When a [[freedman]] of Nero was giving a gladiatorial show at [[Antium]], the public porticoes were covered with paintings, so we are told, containing life-like portraits of all the gladiators and assistants. This portraiture of gladiators has been the highest interest in art for many centuries now, but it was Gaius Terentius who began the practice of having pictures made of gladiatorial shows and exhibited in public; in honour of his grandfather who had adopted him he provided thirty pairs of Gladiators in the Forum for three consecutive days, and exhibited a picture of the matches in the Grove of Diana.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny. ''Natural History'', 30.32 (cited in {{harvnb|Welch|2007|p=21}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Decline==
The decline of the ''munus'' was a far from straightforward process.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mattern|2002|pp=130–131}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[crisis of the 3rd century]] imposed increasing military demands on the imperial purse, from which the Roman Empire never quite recovered, and lesser magistrates found the obligatory ''munera'' an increasingly unrewarding tax on the doubtful privileges of office. Still, emperors continued to subsidize the games as a matter of undiminished public interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Auguet|1994|pp=30, 32}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 3rd century AD, the Christian writer [[Tertullian]] had acknowledged their power over the Christian flock, and was compelled to be blunt: the combats were [[murder]], their witnessing spiritually and morally harmful and the gladiator an instrument of [[pagan]] human sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian. ''De Spectaculis'', 22.&lt;/ref&gt; In the next century, [[Augustine of Hippo]] deplored the youthful fascination of his friend (and later fellow-convert and [[Bishop]]) [[Alypius of Thagaste]], with the ''munera'' [[spectacle]] as inimical to a Christian life and [[Salvation#Christianity|salvation]].&lt;ref&gt;Saint Augustine, ''Confessions'', 6.8.&lt;/ref&gt; Amphitheatres continued to host the spectacular administration of Imperial justice: in 315 [[Constantine the Great]] condemned child-snatchers ''[[ad bestias]]'' in the arena. Ten years later, he banned the gladiator ''munera'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In times in which peace and peace relating to domestic affairs prevail bloody demonstrations displease us. Therefore, we order that there may be no more gladiator combats. Those who were condemned to become gladiators for their crimes are to work from now on in the mines. Thus they pay for their crimes without having to pour their blood.&lt;ref&gt;''Constantine'', 9.18.1 and 15.12.1 (see also {{harvnb|Edwards|2007|p=215}}).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Mosaic museum Istanbul 2007 011.jpg|thumb|A 5th-century mosaic in the [[Great Palace of Constantinople]] depicts two ''venatores'' fighting a tiger.]]
An imperially sanctioned ''munus'' at some time in the 330s suggests that yet again, imperial legislation failed to entirely curb the games, not least when Constantine defied his own [[law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carter|2004|p=43}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 365, [[Valentinian I]] (r. 364–375) threatened to fine a [[judge]] who sentenced Christians to the arena and in 384 attempted, like most of his predecessors, to limit the expenses of ''munera''.&lt;ref&gt;See Tertullian's ''Apologetics'', 49.4 for Tertullian's condemnation of officials who sought their own "glory" by sponsoring the martyrdom of Christians.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kyle|1998|p=78}}. Compared to "pagan" ''noxii'', Christian deaths in the arena would have been few.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Codex Theodosianus'', [http://ancientrome.ru/ius/library/codex/theod/liber09.htm 9.40.8 and 15.9.1]; Symacchus. ''Relatio'', 8.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 393, [[Theodosius I]] (r. 379–395) adopted [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicene]] Christianity as the [[state church of the Roman Empire|state religion of the Roman Empire]] and banned pagan festivals.&lt;ref&gt;''Codex Theodosianus'', 2.8.19 and 2.8.22.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''ludi'' continued, very gradually shorn of their stubbornly pagan ''munera''. [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] (r. 395–423) legally ended ''munera'' in 399, and again in 404, at least in the [[Western Roman Empire]]. According to [[Theodoret]], the ban was in consequence of [[Saint Telemachus]]' martyrdom by spectators at a ''munus.''&lt;ref&gt;Telemachus had personally stepped in to prevent the ''munus''. See Theoderet's ''Historia Ecclesiastica'', 5.26.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Valentinian III]] (r. 425–455) repeated the ban in 438, perhaps effectively, though ''venationes'' continued beyond 536.&lt;ref&gt;''Codex Justinianus'', 3.12.9.&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, interest in ''munera'' had waned throughout the Roman world. In the [[Byzantine]] Empire, [[Theatre of ancient Rome|theatrical shows]] and [[chariot race]]s continued to attract the crowds, and drew a generous Imperial subsidy.
 
It is not known how many ''gladiatoria munera'' were given throughout the Roman period. Many, if not most, involved ''venationes'', and in the later Empire some may have been only that. In 165 BC, at least one ''munus'' was held during April's [[Megalesia]]. In the early Imperial era, ''munera'' in Pompeii and neighbouring towns were dispersed from March through November. They included a provincial magnate's five-day ''munus'' of thirty pairs, plus beast-hunts.&lt;ref&gt;Alison E. Cooley and MGL Cooley, ''Pompeii, A Sourcebook'', Routledge, 2004, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; A single late primary source, the ''Calendar of Furius Dionysius Philocalus'' for 354, shows how seldom gladiators featured among a multitude of official festivals. Of 176 days reserved for spectacles of various kinds, 102 were for theatrical shows, 64 for [[chariot race]]s and just 10 in December for gladiator games and ''venationes''. A century before this, the emperor [[Alexander Severus]] (r. 222–235) may have intended a more even redistribution of ''munera'' throughout the year; but this would have broken with what had become the traditional positioning of the major gladiator games, at the year's ending. As Wiedemann points out, December was also the month for the [[Saturnalia]], [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn's]] festival, in which death was linked to renewal, and the lowest were honoured as the highest.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wiedemann|1992|pp=11–12}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern reconstructions==
{{further|Roman-era historical reenactment|Combat reenactment|Historical European martial arts#Antiquity}}
Some Roman reenactors attempt to recreate Roman gladiator troupes.  Some of these groups are part of larger Roman reenactment groups, and others are wholly independent, though they might participate in larger demonstrations of Roman reenacting or historical reenacting in general.  These groups usually focus on portraying mock gladiatorial combat in as accurate a manner as possible.

===1940s–1960s peplum films===
Gladiator fights have been depicted in a number of [[peplum (film genre)|peplum films]] (also known as "sword-and-sandal" movies). This is a genre of largely Italian-made historical epics (costume dramas) that dominated the Italian film industry from 1958 to 1965. They can be immediately differentiated from the competing Hollywood product by their use of [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]].  The pepla attempted to emulate the big-budget Hollywood historical epics of the time, such as ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]''. Inspired by the success of ''Spartacus'', there were a number of Italian peplums that emphasized the gladiatorial arena fights in their plots, with it becoming almost a peplum subgenre in itself;  One group of supermen known as "The Ten Gladiators" appeared in a trilogy, all three films starring [[Dan Vadis]] in the lead role.

{{cleanup|date=April 2012}}
In [[psychology]], the term '''identity crisis''' means the failure to achieve ego [[Identity formation|identity]] during adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;Kendra Cherry, [http://psychology.about.com/od/theoriesofpersonality/a/identitycrisis.htm Identity Crisis - Theory and Research]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "S216"&gt;(Schultz, 216)&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by German psychologist [[Erik Erikson]].

The [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development|stage of psychosocial development]] in which identity crisis may occur is called the Identity Cohesion vs. Role Confusion. During this stage, adolescents are faced with physical growth, sexual maturity, and integrating ideas of themselves and about what others think of them.&lt;ref name="Schultz, 215-216"&gt;(Schultz, 215-216)&lt;/ref&gt; Adolescents therefore form their self-image and endure the task of resolving the crisis of their basic ego identity. Successful resolution of the crisis depends on one's [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development|progress through previous developmental stages]], centering on issues such as trust, autonomy, and initiative.&lt;ref name="Schultz, 215-216"/&gt;

Erikson's own interest in identity began in childhood. Born [[Ashkenazic Jewish]], Erikson felt that he was an outsider. His later studies of cultural life among the [[Yurok]] of northern California and the [[Sioux]] of South Dakota helped formalize Erikson's ideas about identity development and identity crisis. Erikson described those going through an identity crisis as exhibiting confusion.&lt;ref name = "S216"/&gt;

==Concept==
{{Main article|Erikson's stages of psychosocial development}}

Sometimes individuals face obstacles that may prevent the development of a strong identity. This sort of unresolved crisis leaves individuals struggling to "find themselves". They often seem to have no idea who or what they are, where they belong or where they want to go. They may withdraw from normal life, not taking action or acting as they usually would at work, in their marriage or at school, or be unable to make defining choices about the future. They may even turn to negative activities, such as crime or drugs since from their point of view having a negative identity could be more acceptable than none at all.&lt;ref name = "S216"/&gt;

On the other side of the spectrum, those who emerge from the adolescent stage of personality development with a strong sense of identity are well equipped to face adulthood with confidence and certainty. 

Erikson felt that peers have a strong impact on the development of ego identity during adolescence. He believed that association with negative groups such as cults or fanatics could actually "redistrict" the developing ego during this fragile time. The basic strength that Erikson found should be developed during adolescence is [[fidelity]], which only emerges from a cohesive ego identity. Fidelity is known to encompass sincerity, genuineness and a sense of duty in our relationships with other people.&lt;ref name = "S216"/&gt;

He described identity as "a subjective sense as well as an observable quality of personal sameness and continuity, paired with some belief in the sameness and continuity of some shared world image. As a quality of unself-conscious living, this can be gloriously obvious in a young person who has found himself as he has found his commonality. In him we see emerge a unique unification of what is irreversibly given &amp;mdash; that is, body type and temperament, giftedness and vulnerability, infantile models and acquired ideals &amp;mdash; with the open choices provided in available roles, occupational possibilities, values offered, mentors met, friendships made, and first sexual encounters."&lt;ref name = "E730"&gt;(Erikson, 730)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marcian theory==
{{Main article|James Marcia}}

James Marcia's research on identity statuses of adolescents also apply to Erikson's framework of identity crises in adolescents.

'''Identity foreclosure''' is an identity status which Marcia claimed is an identity developed by an individual without much choice.  "The foreclosure status is when a commitment is made without exploring alternatives. Often these commitments are based on parental ideas and beliefs that are accepted without question".&lt;ref name="social.jrank.org"&gt;James Marcia, [http://social.jrank.org/pages/322/Identity-Development.html Identity Development - Aspects of Identity]&lt;/ref&gt;  Identity foreclosure can contribute to identity crises in adolescents when the "security blanket" of their assumed identity is removed.  These "foreclosed individuals often go into crisis, not knowing what to do without being able to rely on the norms, rules, and situations to which they have been accustomed."&lt;ref&gt;Seth J. Scwartz, ''The Evolution of Eriksonian and Neo-Eriksonian Identity Theory and Research: A review and Integration''.  "Identity, An International Journal of Theory and Research", 2001 Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of this would be a son of a farmer who learns that his father is selling the farm, and whose identity as an heir to a farm and the lifestyle and identity of a farmer has been shaken by that news.

'''Identity diffusion''' is a Marcian identity status that can lead to identity crises in adolescents.  Identity diffusion can be described as "the apathetic state that represents the relative lack of both exploration and commitment".&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt;  Identity diffusion can overlap with diagnoses such as schizophrenia and depression, and can best be described as a lack of identity structure.  An example of an identity crisis emerging from this status is an adolescent who becomes recluse after his identity as a star athlete is destroyed by a serious injury.

'''Identity moratorium''' is the status that Marcia theorizes lasts the longest in individuals, is the most volatile, and can be best described as "the active exploration of alternatives".&lt;ref name="social.jrank.org"/&gt;  Individuals experiencing identity moratorium can be very open-minded and thoughtful but also in crisis over their identity.&lt;ref&gt;(Schwartz, 12)&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of this would be a college student who lacks conviction in their future after changing majors multiple times but still cannot seem to find their passion.

'''Identity achievement''' is the resolution to many identity crises.  Identity achievement occurs when the adolescent has explored and committed to important aspects of their identity."&lt;ref&gt;(Marcia)&lt;/ref&gt;

The expression '''immaculate perception''' has been used in various senses by various philosophers.

* It is a [[nickname]] for [[Plato]]'s theory of knowledge.  It is called this because Plato believed that all knowledge came from past lives, and from one's knowledge of [[The Forms]].
* It was used by the English philosopher [[Francis Bacon]], who referred to it as the necessity of "keeping the eye steadily fixed upon the facts of nature and so receiving the images simply as they are."&lt;ref&gt;Bacon, Francis. (1620). The Great Instauration.&lt;/ref&gt;
* It was used by the German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] in his text ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]''.  Nietzsche argued that this kind of perception mere fiction, for it ignores the intimate connection between the perceiver and the external world.  In particular, it denies the important role that the will and desires of the perceiver have on every perception.&lt;ref&gt;Metcalfe, Michael. ''A Dancer’s Virtue: Human Life in Light of Nietzsche’s Eternal Recurrence''. Concept XXVIII, 2005. [http://www.publications.villanova.edu/Concept/2005/Dancer's%20Virtue.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rapper 8Ball released a song in March 2012 titled "immaculate perception" featuring Waka Flocka Flame and Yelawolf.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7472">An '''implied license''' is an unwritten [[license]] which permits a party (the licensee) to do something that would normally require the express permission of another party (the licensor). Implied licenses may arise by [[operation of law]] from actions by the licensor which lead the licensee to believe that it has the necessary permission.

Implied licenses often arise where the licensee has purchased a physical embodiment of some [[intellectual property]] belonging to the licensor, or has paid for its creation, but has not obtained permission to use the intellectual property.

==Examples==
* A person who purchases a record album does not explicitly purchase a right to ''perform'' that album by playing it on a record player, but this right is implied.&lt;ref&gt;"An incident to the purchase of any article, whether patented or unpatented, is the right to use and sell it...." [[United States v. Univis Lens Co.]], 316 U.S. 241, 249 (1942); see also Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co., 377 U.S. 476, 484 (1964) ("[I]t is fundamental that sale of a patented article by the patentee or under his authority carries with it an 'implied license to use.'") (quoting Adams v. Burke, 84 U.S. (17 Wall.) 453, 456 (1873)).&lt;/ref&gt;
* A person or entity that purchases computer software in a suite. Software that is individually purchased, or not included in the suite is protected by a single license &amp; and not part of a implied license.
* A person who posts a lengthy comment to an [[internet forum]] may claim copyright to that post. However, if posters in that forum commonly copy the entire text to which they are responding into a later post, the original poster will be deemed to have given an implied license for his text to be copied into the later post.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}
* In a non-IP context, a person who holds a party on their house gives all of the invited guests an implied license to enter their property, and to enter those parts of the property that would usually be made available to guests, such as the bathrooms.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}
* In patent law, where an employee invents something while on company time, the employer receives an implied license to use the invention, even if no [[contract]] exists to assign rights to the employer. This is sometimes referred to as [[shop right]].&lt;ref&gt;United States v. Dubilier Condenser Corp., 289 U.S. 178 (1933); Lariscey v. United States, 949 F.2d 1137 (Fed. Cir. 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; In copyright law, the work for hire provision would grant the employer copyright to the work, provided the invention is within the employee's job description.&lt;ref&gt;Section 101, Copyright Act of 1976 (USC 17 §101)&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2008, the Ninth US Circuit held that a non-exclusive license to use copyrighted material can be granted by implied license, but not an exclusive license. Further, if the creator has received consideration for the work, the non-exclusive grant is irrevocable.&lt;ref&gt;[[Asset Marketing Systems, Inc. v. Gagnon]], 542 F.3d 748 (9th Cir. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Where a [[copyright]]ed work has been commissioned, the law in the United Kingdom is that the creator retains rights in the commissioned work. Unauthorised use of the work would therefore infringe the creator's copyright. Nevertheless, the commissioner may have an implied license to use the commissioned work, although only for the particular purpose under which the commission was originally agreed.&lt;ref&gt;Blair v Osborn and Tomkins [1971] 2 WLR 503&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Bainbridge, Intellectual Property, 1999 (4th ed.), pp.84-85&lt;/ref&gt;
* A U.S. court has   ruled in Jan 19th 2006 that [[Web cache|Web caching]] does not constitute a copyright violation, because of ''fair use'' and an ''implied license''. Was the "Field vs Google, US District Court, District of Nevada, CV-S-04-0413-RCJ-LRL". In that context ''implied license'' refers to a [[de facto standard|''de facto'' standard]]: if the copyright holder does not use any no-archive tags and robot exclusion standards to prevent caching.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.webcitation.org/faq&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implication: from surrounding circumstances or by operation of law?==

In the United States, implied licenses are usually considered to be of two kinds: either they reflect the intention of the parties, which is inferred from a fact-specific inquiry into the surrounding circumstances, or else they are constructive agreements, in which case the intention of the parties is likely to be immaterial. In reality, there is a continuum between these kinds of implied license and it may be difficult to determine whether the license or contract in question is one which the law implies, irrespective of any protests by the unwilling licensor, or instead one inferred from the whole pattern of factual circumstances including the evidence of intent.

In England, there is more of a tendency to regard all implied licenses as matters of fact and intent, while what would be a license implied by law in the US is treated under some other branch of substantive law such as the [[doctrine of non-derogation from grants]].&lt;ref&gt;An illustrative case is [[British Leyland Motor Corp. v. Armstrong Patents Co.]], [1986] A.C. 577, [1986] All E.R. 850 (H.L.). The opinion by [[Sydney Templeman, Baron Templeman|Lord Templeman]] in that case pointed out that an implied license might be negatived by express language, under principles of freedom of contract, but that was not so when non-derogation instead is involved: “The right cannot be withheld by the manufacturer of the car by contract with the first purchaser and cannot be withheld from any subsequent owner.” That is, the nature of property makes the right inherent and not a matter of freedom of contract. It is thus seen that the effect is comparable to the US license that is implied by operation of law.&lt;/ref&gt;

In both countries, the [[exhaustion doctrine]] has the effect of creating an implied license to use a product sold under the "authority" of the patentee. It is controversial whether and to what extent contractual expedients can successfully limit the scope of such implied licenses.

==Express license==
The opposite of an implied license is an ''express license'', which, for some forms of intellectual property, must be in writing. Oral exclusive licenses were permitted, however, under US copyright law before 1978.&lt;ref&gt;See Davis v. Blige, 505 F.3d 90, 108 (2d Cir. 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Oral nonexclusive copyright licenses remain valid under US law.&lt;ref&gt;See Vincent v. City Colleges of Chicago, 485 F.3d 919, 922 (7th Cir. 2007); Bateman v. Mnemonics, Inc., 79 F.3d 1532, 1538 n.12 (11th Cir. 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; Patent licenses may be oral.&lt;ref&gt;Waymark Corp. v. Porta Systems Corp., 334 F.3d 1358, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2003); Enzo APA &amp; Son v. Geapag A.G., 134 F.3d 1090, 1093 (Fed. Cir. 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; Licenses under the [[Semiconductor Chip Protection Act]] must be in writing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap9.html#903  Section 903(b)] of the Act, 17 U.S.C. § 903(b), provides: "The owner of the exclusive rights in a mask work may transfer all of those rights, or license all or less than all of those rights, by any written instrument signed by such owner or a duly authorized agent of the owner."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Infinity Mirror Effect.jpg|thumb|An infinity mirror effect viewed ''between'' the mirrors]]&lt;!-- This is the best image that could be found in a quick search; a clearer image would be  useful  --&gt;
In a classic self-contained infinity mirror, a set of light bulbs, [[Light-emitting diode|LEDs]], or other point-source lights are placed around the periphery of a fully reflective mirror, and a second, partially reflective "[[one-way mirror]]" is placed a short distance in front of it, in a  [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] alignment. When an outside observer looks into the surface of the partially reflective mirror, the lights appear to recede into infinity, creating the appearance of a tunnel of lights of great depth.&lt;ref name="Finio" /&gt;

Alternatively, this effect can also be seen when an observer stands ''between'' two parallel fully reflective mirrors, as in some [[dressing room]]s, some [[elevator]]s, or a [[house of mirrors]].&lt;ref name="Gbur" /&gt; A weaker version of this effect can be seen by standing between any two parallel reflective surfaces, such as the glass walls of a small entry lobby into some buildings. The partially reflective glass produces this sensation, diluted by the [[visual noise]] of the views through the glass into the surrounding environment.

== Explanation of effect ==
[[File:Venus in Mirrors.jpg|thumb|Computer simulation image of repeatedly reflected shapes]]
The 3D illusion  mirror effect is produced whenever there are two parallel reflective surfaces which can bounce a beam of light back and forth an indefinite (theoretically infinite) number of times. The reflections appear to recede into the distance because the light actually is traversing the distance it appears to be traveling.  

For example, in a two-centimeter-thick infinity mirror, with the light sources halfway between, light from the source initially travels one centimeter.  The first reflection travels one centimeter to the rear mirror and then two centimeters to, and through the front mirror, a total of three centimeters.  The second reflection travels two centimeters from front mirror to back mirror, and again two centimeters from the back mirror to, and through the front mirror, totaling four centimeters, plus the first reflection (three centimeters) making the second reflection seven centimeters away from the front mirror.  Each successive reflection adds four more centimeters to the total (the third reflection appears 11 centimeters deep, fourth 15 centimeters deep, and so on).&lt;ref name="Gbur" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ExpSnack"&gt;{{cite web|title=Look Into Infinity|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/snacks/look_into_infinity/|website=Exploratorium Snacks|publisher=Exploratorium|accessdate=2015-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each additional reflection adds length to the path the light must travel before exiting the mirror. If the mirrors are not precisely parallel, but instead are canted at a slight angle, the "visual tunnel" will be perceived to be curved (off to one side) as it recedes into infinity.

When studied using the principles of [[geometrical optics]], the series of repeating images forms the infinite mathematical surface known as [[Gabriel's Horn]], or [[Torricelli's Trumpet]], named in honor of Italian mathematician [[Evangelista Torricelli]], who first studied it. In theory, such a surface is infinite in area, but encloses a finite volume.&lt;ref name="Gbur" /&gt;

==Cultural references==
Visual artists, especially contemporary [[sculpture|sculptors]], have made use of infinity mirrors. [[Yayoi Kusama]], [[Josiah McElheny]], [[Ivan Navarro (artist)|Ivan Navarro]], and [[Taylor Davis (sculptor)|Taylor Davis]] have all produced works that use the infinity mirror to expand the sensation of unlimited space in their artworks.

Some [[amusement park]] [[dark ride]]s, such as Disney's "[[Space Mountain]]" roller coaster attraction, use infinity mirrors to create the impression of flying through space.

The '''Japanese punitive expedition to Taiwan in 1874''', referred to in Japan as the {{nihongo|'''Taiwan Expedition'''|台湾出兵|Taiwan Shuppei|lead=yes}} and in Taiwan and mainland China as the '''Mudan incident''' ({{zh|c=牡丹社事件}}), was a [[punitive expedition]] launched by the Japanese in retaliation for the murder of 54 [[Ryūkyū Kingdom|Ryukyuan]] sailors by [[Paiwan people|Paiwan]] aborigines near the southwestern tip of [[Taiwan]] in December 1871. The success of the expedition, which marked the first overseas deployment of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] and [[Imperial Japanese Navy]], revealed the fragility of the [[Qing dynasty]]'s hold on Taiwan and encouraged further Japanese adventurism.  Diplomatically, Japan's embroilment with China in 1874 was eventually resolved by a British arbitration under which Qing China agreed to compensate Japan for property damage. Some ambiguous wording in the agreed terms were later argued by Japan to be confirmation of Chinese renunciation of suzerainty over the [[Ryukyu Islands]], paving the way for ''de facto'' Japanese incorporation of Ryukyu in 1879.

==Background==
{{main article|Mudan Incident of 1871}}
In December 1871 a [[Ryukyuan people|Ryukyuan]] vessel was shipwrecked near the southern tip of Taiwan.  Fifty-four members of its crew of 66 were beheaded by the [[Paiwan people|Paiwan]] aborigines. The remaining 12 crewmen were rescued by [[Han Chinese]] and were transferred to [[Tainan]] in southern Taiwan. The [[Taiwan under Qing rule|local Qing Chinese government]] officials transferred them to [[Fujian]] province in mainland China. From there, the [[Qing]] government arranged to send them back home.{{sfnp|Davidson|1903|p=123}}

===Diplomacy===
When Japan sought compensation from Qing China, the court rejected the demand on the grounds that the "wild"/"unsubjugated" aboriginals ({{zh|t=臺灣生番|p=Táiwān shēngfān}}) were outside its jurisdiction. This open renunciation of sovereignty led to the Taiwan Expedition of 1874 by the Japanese.

The [[Meiji government]] of Japan demanded that the Qing government of China punish leaders of the [[Taiwanese aborigines]] responsible for the murders of the Ryukyuan crew. The Japanese foreign minister [[Soejima Taneomi]] went to [[Beijing]] in June 1873, and was received in an audience by the [[Tongzhi Emperor]] (in itself a diplomatic triumph); however, his request for compensation was first rejected because China considered it an internal affair since Taiwan was part of Fujian Province of China and the [[Ryūkyū Kingdom]] had a tributary relationship with China. When Soejima Taneomi claimed four of the victims murdered were from Oda Prefecture, present-day [[Okayama]] Prefecture, Japan and asked for compensation again, Chinese officials refused him on the grounds that most of the [[Taiwanese aboriginals]] were outside effective Chinese control, and were thus sometimes exempt from judicial action. [[Charles Le Gendre]], the French-born [[United States|American]] [[military advisor]] to the Japanese government, as well as [[Gustave Emile Boissonade]], legal advisor, urged that Japan take the matter into its own hands.

==Expedition==
[[File:Japanese Ironclad warship Ryujo.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[Japanese battleship Ryūjō (1864)|''Ryūjō'']] was the flagship of the Taiwan expedition.]]
[[File:Battle of Stonegate.jpg|thumb|right|The battle of Stone Gate, against the "Botan" aborigines, was the most serious encounter of the expedition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink1=James Huffman (historian)|last1=Huffman|first1=James L.|title=A Yankee in Meiji Japan|date=2003|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9780742526211|page=94|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WngYfDz1pAMC&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq=%22Battle+of+Stone+gate%22&amp;sig=guaCIhA8Ik9ic8HVQKnOoIiUmWo&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Battle%20of%20Stone%20gate%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The Japanese government agreed, and sent an expedition of 3,600 soldiers led by [[Saigō Tsugumichi]] in May 1874. The Japanese won a decisive victory at the Battle of Stone Gate on 22 May.  Thirty Taiwan tribesmen were either killed or mortally wounded in the battle, and a considerably greater number wounded.  Japanese casualties were 6 killed and 30 wounded.{{sfnp|Davidson|1903|pp=145–6}}

In November 1874 the Japanese forces withdrew from Taiwan after the Qing government agreed to an indemnity of 500,000 Kuping [[tael]]s, or about {{convert|18.7|t|ozt}} silver. [[Harry Smith Parkes|Sir Harry Parkes]], the British minister to Japan, characterised this transaction as "China's willingness to pay to be invaded".

== Aftermath ==
In 1875, the Qing authorities unsuccessfully attempted to bring the southeast coastal region of Taiwan under their control, despatching a column of 300 soldiers against the Paiwan.  The Chinese troops were ambushed and routed by the Paiwan and their well-armed fighters.  250 Chinese soldiers were killed, and the 50 survivors retreated to Takow ([[Kaohsiung]]).{{sfnp|Davidson|1903|pp=168–9}}

==Legacy==
Although launched ostensibly to punish the local tribesmen for their murder of 54 Ryukyuan merchants, the 1874 punitive expedition to Taiwan served a number of purposes for Japan's new Meiji government. Japan had for some time begun claiming suzerainty, and later sovereignty, over the [[Ryūkyū Kingdom]], whose traditional suzerain had been China. The expedition demonstrated that China was not in effective control of Taiwan, let alone the Ryukyu Islands. Japan was emboldened to more forcefully assert its claim to speak for the Ryukyuan islanders. The settlement in 1874, brokered by the British, included a reference to Chinese recognition that the Japanese expedition was "in protection of civilians", a reference that Japan later pointed towards as Chinese renunciation of its rights over Ryukyu. In 1879 Japan referred the dispute to British arbitration, and the British confirmed Japanese sovereignty over the Ryukyus, a result which was not recognised by China.{{sfnp|Kerr|2000|pp=359–360}} Nevertheless, Japan used this as the justification for taking ''de facto'' control over Ryukyu, moving the king of Ryukyu to Japan and incorporating Ryukyu as a prefecture of Japan. The ensuing Chinese protest led to the matter being submitted to US President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] as arbitrator, during which Japan offered to split Ryukyu between Japan and China. This was refused by China, but a weakened China was unable in practice to stop the [[History of the Ryukyu Islands|Japanese annexation of the Ryukyus]].

The surrendering aborigines were given Japanese flags to fly over their villages that they viewed as a symbol of peace with Japan and protection from rival tribes, however, the Japanese viewed them as a symbol of jurisdiction over the aborigines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ahr/107.2/ah0202000388.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101212014547/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ahr/107.2/ah0202000388.html |archivedate=2010-12-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The expedition also served as a useful rehearsal for future [[Japanese Invasion of Taiwan (1895)|Japanese imperial ambitions]]. Taiwan was already being viewed as a potential Japanese colony in some circles in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Eskildsen | first =  Robert | year = 2002

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestically, the action also mollified those within the Meiji government who were pushing for a more aggressive foreign policy, and who were enraged by the government's refusal in 1873 to attack [[Korea]]. It is significant that the expedition took place shortly after the [[Saga Rebellion]], and was led by [[Saigō Tsugumichi|Saigō Jūdō]] ([[Saigō Takamori]]'s younger brother) and consisted largely of former [[Satsuma han|Satsuma]] and [[Saga Domain|Saga]] ''samurai''.

More generally, the Japanese incursion into Taiwan in 1874 and the feeble Chinese response was a blatant revelation of Chinese weakness and an invitation to further foreign encroachment in Taiwan.  In particular, the success of the Japanese incursion was among the factors influencing the French decision to [[Keelung Campaign|invade Taiwan]] in October 1884, during the [[Sino-French War]].  The Qing court belatedly attempted to strengthen its hold on Taiwan, and the Chinese imperial commissioner [[Shen Baozhen|Shen Pao-chen]] made some improvements to the island's coastal defences during the second half of the 1870s.  Further substantial improvements were made by the Chinese governor [[Liu Mingchuan|Liu Ming-ch'uan]] in the 1880s, in the wake of the [[Keelung Campaign|French capture of Keelung]] during the [[Sino-French War]].  However, little was done to improve the poor quality of the Qing garrison of Taiwan, and both the French in 1884 and the [[Japanese invasion of Taiwan (1895)|Japanese in 1895]] were able to land successfully in Taiwan.

'''Justice for Jews from Arab Countries (JJAC)''' is a [[political advocacy]] organization founded in New York in 2002, which was formed by the [[Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations|Conference of Presidents]], the [[World Jewish Congress]], the [[American Sephardi Federation]], and the [[World Organization of Jews from Arab Countries]]. Today, JJAC works with the [[American Jewish Committee]], [[American Jewish Congress]], [[Jewish Council for Public Affairs]], the World Sephardic Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Urman, Seeking Justice for Displaced Jews, October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission statement==
Its mission statement is:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justiceforjews.com/mission.html Mission Statement]&lt;/ref&gt;
*a) To represent the interests of Jews from Arab countries;
*b) To recognize the legacy of Jewish refugees from Arab countries;
*c) To register and record personal testimonies of Jews from Arab countries, in order to preserve their history and heritage;
*d) To serve as a clearing house of information and documentation on Jewish refugees from Arab countries; and
*e) To conduct public education programs that provide historical perspective, in the pursuit of truth, justice and reconciliation.

==Achievements==
According to founder Stanley Urman in 2009, "Perhaps our most significant accomplishment was the adoption in April 2008 by the United States Congress of Resolution 185, which granted the first-ever recognition of Jewish refugees from the Arab countries. This now requires US diplomats in all Middle East negotiations to refer to a quote of what the resolution calls "multiple population of refugees" with a specific injunction that hands forth any specific reference and "any specific reference to the Palestinian refugees must be matched by an explicit reference to Jewish refugees"... our mandate is to follow that lead. Any explicit reference to Palestinians should be followed by explicit reference to Jewish refugees."&lt;ref&gt;Urman, Seeking Justice for Displaced Jews, October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics have suggested that JJAC's resolution was "a tactic to help the Israeli government deflect Palestinian refugee claims in any final Israeli-Palestinian peace deal, claims that include Palestinian refugees' demand for the "right of return" to their pre-1948 homes in Israel."&lt;ref&gt;Fischbach, 2008, "On 1 April 2008, the New York–based coalition Justice for Jews from Arab Countries (JJAC) announced that the U.S. House of Representatives had passed Resolution 185 (H.Res. 185), a nonbinding "sense of the House" resolution concerning the fate of 800,000 Jews who left Arab countries in the wake of the first Arab-Israeli war of 1948, some without their property. Describing these Jews as "refugees," the resolution called on the U.S. president to ensure that American representatives participating in international fora refer to the plight of Jewish refugees from Arab countries whenever mention is made of the 1948 Palestinian refugees. H.Res. 185—which JJAC helped to write—was not an effort to demand compensation for Jewish property losses in the Arab world, but rather a tactic to help the Israeli government deflect Palestinian refugee claims in any final Israeli-Palestinian peace deal, claims that include Palestinian refugees' demand for the "right of return" to their pre-1948 homes in Israel."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Linguistics''' is the [[science|scientific]] study of [[language]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On Language and Linguistics |first=Michael A.K. |last=Halliday |authorlink=Michael Halliday |author2=Jonathan Webster | publisher= Continuum International Publishing Group |year=2006 |isbn=0-8264-8824-2 |page=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it involves an analysis of language [[Theoretical linguistics|form]], language [[Semantics|meaning]], and language in [[context (language use)|context]].&lt;ref name="Martinet"&gt;{{cite book|title=Elements of General Linguistics |last=Martinet |first=André |authorlink=André Martinet |translator=Elisabeth Palmer Rubbert |series=Studies in General Linguistics, vol. i. |location=London |publisher=Faber |year=1960 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest activities in the [[language documentation|documentation]] and [[descriptive linguistics|description of language]] have been attributed to the 6th century BC [[India]]n grammarian [[Pāṇini]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A New History of the Humanities: The Search for Principles and Patterns from Antiquity to the Present|author=Rens Bod|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0199665214|year=2014|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KaOcAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter =Chapter VI: Sanskrit Literature|title = The Imperial Gazetteer of India|volume = 2 |date=1908|page = 263|url =https://archive.org/details/imperialgazette02hunt}}&lt;/ref&gt; who wrote a formal description of the [[Sanskrit|Sanskrit language]] in his ''{{IAST|Aṣṭādhyāyī}}''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ashtadhyayi of Panini (2 Vols.) |author=S.C. Vasu (Tr.) |publisher=Vedic Books |year=1996 |isbn=9788120804098|url=http://www.vedicbooks.net/ashtadhyayi-panini-vols-p-2313.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguists traditionally analyse human language by observing an interplay between [[phonetics|sound]] and [[semantics|meaning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Six Lectures on Sound and Meaning |first=Roman |last=Jakobson |publisher=MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=1937 |isbn=0262600102 |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ru/jakobson.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phonetics]] is the study of speech and non-speech sounds, and delves into their acoustic and articulatory properties. The study of language [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]], on the other hand, deals with how languages encode relations between entities, properties, and other aspects of the world to convey, process, and assign meaning, as well as manage and resolve [[ambiguity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vakyapadiya: Sphota, Jati, and Dravya |author=Sharada Narayanan |year=2010 |url=http://www.thehindu.com/books/power-of-the-word/article3779772.ece}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the study of [[semantics]] typically concerns itself with [[truth condition]]s, [[pragmatics]] deals with how situational context influences the production of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Meaning and Grammar: An Introduction to Semantics |year=2000 |author1=Chierchia, Gennaro |author2=Sally McConnell-Ginet |lastauthoramp=yes|publisher= MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn= 9780262531641}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Grammar]] is a system of rules which governs the production and use of [[utterances]] in a given language. These rules apply to sound&lt;ref&gt;All references in this article to the study of sound should be taken to include the manual and non-manual signs used in [[sign language]]s.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as meaning, and include componential subsets of rules, such as those pertaining to [[phonology]] (the organisation of phonetic sound systems), [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (the formation and composition of words), and [[syntax]] (the formation and composition of phrases and sentences).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Linguistics|year=2010|publisher=The MIT Press|isbn =0-262-51370-6|url= https://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/examrequest.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=12240 |edition= 6th |author1=Adrian Akmajian |author2=Richard A. Demers |author3=Ann K. Farmer |author4=Robert M. Harnish |accessdate= 25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern theories that deal with the principles of grammar are largely based within [[Noam Chomsky]]'s framework of [[generative linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;''Syntax: A Generative Introduction'' (Second Edition), 2013. Andrew Carnie. Blackwell Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] distinguished between the notions of [[langue and parole|''langue'' and ''parole'']] in his formulation of [[structural linguistics]]. According to him, [[speech|''parole'']] is the specific utterance of speech, whereas [[language|langue]] refers to an abstract phenomenon that theoretically defines the principles and system of rules that govern a language.&lt;ref&gt;de Saussure, F. (1986). ''Course in general linguistics'' (3rd ed.). (R. Harris, Trans.). Chicago: Open Court Publishing Company. (Original work published 1972). p. 9-10, 15.&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction resembles the one made by [[Noam Chomsky]] between [[linguistic competence|competence]] and [[Linguistic performance|performance]] in his theory of [[generative grammar|transformative]] or [[universal grammar|generative grammar]]. According to Chomsky, competence is an individual's innate capacity and potential for language (like in Saussure's ''langue''), while performance is the specific way in which it is used by individuals, groups, and communities (i.e., ''parole'', in Saussurean terms).&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam. (1965). ''Aspects of the Theory of Syntax''. Cambridge, MA: [[MIT Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of ''parole'' (which manifests through cultural [[discourse (linguistics)|discourses]] and [[dialects]]) is the domain of [[sociolinguistics]], the sub-discipline that comprises the study of a complex system of linguistic facets within a certain [[speech community]] (governed by its own set of grammatical rules and laws). [[Discourse analysis]] further examines the structure of texts and [[conversations]] emerging out of a speech community's usage of language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sociolinguistic Discontinuity in Minority Language Communities |pages=40–55 |year=1998 |publisher=Linguistic Society of America |author1=Raymond Mougeon |author2=Terry Nadasdi |lastauthoramp=yes|jstor=417564}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is done through the collection of linguistic data, or through the formal discipline of [[corpus linguistics]], which takes naturally occurring [[Text (disambiguation)|texts]] and studies the variation of grammatical and other features based on such corpora (or corpus data).

[[stylistics (field of study)|Stylistics]] also involves the study of written, signed, or spoken [[discourse]] through varying speech communities, [[genres]], and editorial or [[narrative]] formats in the mass media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.uni-giessen.de/anglistik/ling/Staff/mukherjee/pdfs/Stylistics.pdf |title="Stylistics" by Joybrato Mukherjee. Chapter 49. ''Encyclopedia of Linguistics''. |access-date=4 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004220434/http://www.uni-giessen.de/anglistik/ling/Staff/mukherjee/pdfs/Stylistics.pdf |archive-date=4 October 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, [[Jacques Derrida]], for instance, further distinguished between speech and writing, by proposing that written language be studied as a linguistic medium of communication in itself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Writing and Difference]] by Jacques Derrida, 1967, and [[Of Grammatology]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Palaeography]] is therefore the discipline that studies the evolution of written scripts (as signs and symbols) in language.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 1, section 1.1 in {{cite book|title=Trends in Linguistics: Runes and Germanic Linguistics|year=2002|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter|isbn =3-11-017462-6|url= https://books.google.com/?id=gvSi3JVNRFQC |edition= 6th |author=Elmer H. Antonsen}}&lt;/ref&gt; The formal study of language also led to the growth of fields like [[psycholinguistics]], which explores the representation and function of language in the mind; [[neurolinguistics]], which studies language processing in the brain; [[biolinguistics]], which studies the biology and evolution of language; and [[language acquisition]], which investigates how children and adults acquire the knowledge of one or more languages.

Linguistics also deals with the social, cultural, historical and political factors that influence language, through which linguistic and language-based context is often determined.&lt;ref&gt;[http://benjamins.com/#catalog/journals/jlp/main Journal of Language and Politics]&lt;/ref&gt; Research on language through the sub-branches of [[historical linguistics|historical]] and [[evolutionary linguistics]] also focus on how languages change and grow, particularly over an extended [[diachronic linguistics|period of time]].

[[Language documentation]] combines anthropological inquiry (into the history and culture of language) with linguistic inquiry, in order to describe languages and their grammars. [[Lexicography]] involves the documentation of words that form a vocabulary. Such a documentation of a linguistic vocabulary from a particular language is usually compiled in a [[dictionary]]. [[Computational linguistics]] is concerned with the statistical or rule-based modeling of natural language from a computational perspective. Specific knowledge of language is applied by speakers during the act of [[translation]] and [[Language interpretation|interpretation]], as well as in [[language education]] – the teaching of a second or [[foreign language]]. Policy makers work with governments to implement new plans in education and teaching which are based on linguistic research.

Related areas of study also includes the disciplines of [[semiotics]] (the study of direct and indirect language through signs and symbols), [[literary criticism]] (the historical and ideological analysis of literature, cinema, art, or published material), [[translation]] (the conversion and documentation of meaning in written/spoken text from one language or dialect onto another), and [[speech-language pathology]] (a corrective method to cure phonetic disabilities and dis-functions at the [[cognitive linguistics|cognitive]] level).

==Nomenclature==
Before the 20th century, the term ''[[philology]]'', first attested in 1716,&lt;ref name="Etymonline Definition of Philology"&gt;{{OEtymD|philology|accessdate=2018-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; was commonly used to refer to the study of language, which was then predominantly historical in focus.&lt;ref name="Introduction: Philology in a Manuscript Culture by Stephen G. Nichols (Vol. 65, No. 1 (Jan 1990), pp. 1-10. Published by Medieval Academy of America."&gt;{{cite journal |title=Introduction: Philology in a Manuscript Culture |first=Stephen G. |last=Nichols |journal=Speculum |volume=65 |number=1 |year=1990 |pages=1–10 |jstor=2864468 |doi=10.2307/2864468}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=McMahon |first=A. M. S. |year=1994 |title=Understanding Language Change |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=19 |isbn=0-521-44665-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s insistence on the importance of [[synchronic analysis (linguistics)|synchronic analysis]], however, this focus has shifted&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=McMahon |first=A. M. S. |year=1994 |title=Understanding Language Change |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=9 |isbn=0-521-44665-1 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the term ''philology'' is now generally used for the "study of a language's grammar, history, and literary tradition", especially in the United States&lt;ref&gt;A. Morpurgo Davies Hist. Linguistics (1998) 4 I. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; (where philology has never been very popularly considered as the "science of language").&lt;ref name="Etymonline Definition of Philology"/&gt;

Although the term "linguist" in the sense of "a student of language" dates from 1641,&lt;ref name="etymonline linguist"/&gt; the term "linguistics" is first attested in 1847.&lt;ref name="etymonline linguist"&gt;{{OEtymD|linguist|accessdate=2018-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now the usual term in English for the scientific study of language,{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} though ''linguistic science'' is sometimes used.

Linguistics is a [[Interdisciplinarity|multi-disciplinary]] field of research that combines tools from natural sciences, social sciences, and the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8nc6nRRbMSQC&amp;pg=PA13|title=The Handbook of Educational Linguistics|last=Spolsky|first=Bernard|last2=Hult|first2=Francis M.|date=February 2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=|isbn=9781444331042|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EUMqGSbeEXAC&amp;pg=PA23|title=Concise Encyclopedia of Applied Linguistics|last=Berns|first=Margie|date=2010-03-20|publisher=Elsevier|year=|isbn=9780080965031|location=|pages=23–25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.linguisticsociety.org/resource/science-linguistics|title=The Science of Linguistics|last=|first=|date=|website=Linguistic Society of America|language=en|access-date=2018-04-17|quote=Modern linguists approach their work with a scientific perspective, although they use methods that used to be thought of as solely an academic discipline of the humanities. Contrary to previous belief, linguistics is multidisciplinary. It overlaps each of the human sciences including psychology, neurology, anthropology, and sociology. Linguists conduct formal studies of sound structure, grammar and meaning, but they also investigate the history of language families, and research language acquisition.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many linguists, such as David Crystal, conceptualize the field as being primarily scientific.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Linguistics|last=Crystal|first=David|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1990|isbn=9780140135312|authorlink=David Crystal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ''linguist'' applies to someone who studies [[language]] or is a researcher within the field, or to someone who uses the tools of the discipline to describe and analyse specific languages.&lt;ref name="American Heritage 2000"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Linguist|encyclopedia=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year=2000|isbn=978-0-395-82517-4|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variation and universality ==
While some theories on linguistics focus on the different varieties that language produces, among different sections of society, others focus on the [[universal grammar|universal]] properties that are common to all human languages. The theory of variation therefore would elaborate on the different usages of popular languages like [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]] across the globe, as well as its smaller [[dialects]] and regional permutations within their national boundaries. The theory of variation looks at the cultural stages that a particular language undergoes, and these include the following.

===Pidgin===

The pidgin stage in a language is a stage when communication occurs through a grammatically simplified means, developing between two or more groups that do not have a language in common. Typically, it is a mixture of languages at the stage when there occurs a [[mixed language|mixing]] between a primary language with other language elements.

===Creole===

A creole stage in language occurs when there is a stable natural language developed from a mixture of different languages. It is a stage that occurs after a language undergoes its pidgin stage. At the creole stage, a language is a complete language, used in a community and acquired by children as their native language.

===Dialect===
A dialect is a [[variety (linguistics)|variety]] of [[language]] that is characteristic of a particular group among the language speakers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50063104?query_type=word&amp;queryword=dialect&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=1&amp;search_id=tFGd-Bh8USU-18775&amp;hilite=50063104 Oxford English dictionary.]&lt;/ref&gt; The group of people who are the speakers of a dialect are usually bound to each other by social identity. This is what differentiates a dialect from a [[register (sociolinguistics)|register]] or a [[discourse]], where in the latter case, cultural identity does not always play a role. Dialects are speech varieties that have their own grammatical and phonological rules, linguistic features, and stylistic aspects, but have not been given an official status as a language. Dialects often move on to gain the status of a language due to political and social reasons. Differentiation amongst dialects (and subsequently, languages too) is based upon the use of grammatical rules, syntactic rules, and stylistic features, though not always on lexical use or vocabulary. The popular saying that "[[a language is a dialect with an army and navy]]" is attributed as a definition formulated by [[Max Weinreich]].

[[Universal grammar]] takes into account general formal structures and features that are common to all dialects and languages, and the template of which pre-exists in the mind of an infant child. This idea is based on the theory of generative grammar and the formal school of linguistics, whose proponents include [[Chomsky|Noam Chomsky]] and those who follow his theory and work.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"We may as individuals be rather fond of our own dialect. This should not make us think, though, that it is actually any better than any other dialect. Dialects are not good or bad, nice or nasty, right or wrong&amp;nbsp;– they are just different from one another, and it is the mark of a civilised society that it tolerates different dialects just as it tolerates different races, religions and sexes."&lt;ref&gt;Trudgill, P. (1994). Dialects. ''Ebooks Online'' Routledge. Florence, KY.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Discourse===
Discourse is language as social practice (Baynham, 1995) and is a multilayered concept.  As a social practice, discourse embodies different ideologies through written and spoken texts. Discourse analysis can examine or expose these ideologies.   Discourse influences genre, which is chosen in response to different situations and finally, at micro level, discourse influences language as text (spoken or written) at the phonological or lexico-grammatical level. Grammar and discourse are linked as parts of a system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ariel|first=Mira|year=2009|title=Discourse, grammar, discourse|jstor=24049745|journal=Discourse Studies|volume=11|issue=1|pages=5–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A particular discourse becomes a language variety when it is used in this way for a particular purpose, and is referred to as a [[register (sociolinguistics)|register]].&lt;ref&gt;Helen Leckie-Tarry, ''Language and Context: a Functional Linguistic Theory of Register'', Continuum International Publishing Group, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;6. {{ISBN|1-85567-272-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; There may be certain [[lexicon|lexical]] additions (new words) that are brought into play because of the expertise of the community of people within a certain domain of specialization. Registers and discourses therefore differentiate themselves through the use of [[vocabulary]], and at times through the use of style too. People in the medical fraternity, for example, may use some medical terminology in their communication that is specialized to the field of medicine. This is often referred to as being part of the "medical discourse", and so on.

===Standard language===

When a dialect is documented sufficiently through the linguistic description of its grammar, which has emerged through the consensual laws from within its community, it gains political and national recognition through a country or region's policies. That is the stage when a language is considered a standard variety, one whose grammatical laws have now stabilised from within the consent of speech community participants, after sufficient evolution, improvisation, correction, and growth. The English language, besides perhaps the French language, may be examples of languages that have arrived at a stage where they are said to have become standard varieties.

The study of a language's universal properties, on the other hand, include some of the following concepts.

===Lexicon===
The [[lexicon]] is a catalogue of words and terms that are stored in a speaker's mind. The lexicon consists of [[words]] and [[bound morphemes]], which are parts of words that can't stand alone, like [[affixes]]. In some analyses, compound words and certain classes of idiomatic expressions and other collocations are also considered to be part of the lexicon. Dictionaries represent attempts at listing, in alphabetical order, the lexicon of a given language; usually, however, bound morphemes are not included. [[Lexicography]], closely linked with the domain of semantics, is the science of mapping the words into an [[encyclopedia]] or a [[dictionary]]. The creation and addition of new words (into the lexicon) is called coining or neologization,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |authorlink=Ghil'ad Zuckermann |last=Zuckermann |first=Ghil'ad |year=2003 |url=http://www.palgrave.com/gb/book/9781403917232 |title=Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-1403917232 |pages=2ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the new words are called [[neologism]]s.

It is often believed that a speaker's capacity for language lies in the quantity of words stored in the lexicon. However, this is often considered a myth by linguists. The capacity for the use of language is considered by many linguists to lie primarily in the domain of grammar, and to be linked with [[linguistic competence|competence]], rather than with the growth of vocabulary. Even a very small lexicon is theoretically capable of producing an infinite number of sentences.

===Relativity===
As constructed popularly through the [[linguistic relativity|Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]], relativists believe that the structure of a particular language is capable of influencing the cognitive patterns through which a person shapes his or her [[world view]]. Universalists believe that there are commonalities between human perception as there is in the human capacity for language, while relativists believe that this varies from language to language and person to person. While the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis is an elaboration of this idea expressed through the writings of American linguists [[Edward Sapir]] and [[Benjamin Lee Whorf]], it was Sapir's student [[Harry Hoijer]] who termed it thus. The 20th century German linguist [[Leo Weisgerber]] also wrote extensively about the theory of relativity. Relativists argue for the case of differentiation at the level of cognition and in semantic domains. The emergence of [[cognitive linguistics]] in the 1980s also revived an interest in linguistic relativity. Thinkers like [[George Lakoff]] have argued that language reflects different cultural metaphors, while the French philosopher of language [[Jacques Derrida]]'s writings have been seen to be closely associated with the relativist movement in linguistics, especially through [[deconstructivism|deconstruction]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Writing and Difference |author=Jacques Derrida |translator=Alan Bass |year=1978 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=9780226143293}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was even heavily criticized in the media at the time of his death for his theory of relativism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/nov/18/philosophy |title=Relative Thinking |work=The Guardian |first=Richard |last=Lea |date=18 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structures==
Linguistic structures are pairings of meaning and form.  Any particular pairing of meaning and form is a [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussurean]] [[linguistic sign|sign]].  For instance, the meaning "cat" is represented worldwide with a wide variety of different sound patterns (in oral languages), movements of the hands and face (in [[sign language]]s), and written symbols (in written languages). Linguistic patterns have proven their importance for the knowledge engineering field especially with the ever-increasing amount of available data.

Linguists focusing on structure attempt to understand the rules regarding language use that native speakers know (not always consciously).  All linguistic structures can be broken down into component parts that are combined according to (sub)conscious rules, over multiple levels of analysis.  For instance, consider the structure of the word "tenth" on two different levels of analysis.  On the level of internal word structure (known as morphology), the word "tenth" is made up of one linguistic form indicating a number and another form indicating ordinality.  The rule governing the combination of these forms ensures that the ordinality marker "th" follows the number "ten."  On the level of sound structure (known as phonology), structural analysis shows that the "n" sound in "tenth" is made differently from the "n" sound in "ten" spoken alone.  Although most speakers of English are consciously aware of the rules governing internal structure of the word pieces of "tenth", they are less often aware of the rule governing its sound structure.  Linguists focused on structure find and analyze rules such as these, which govern how native speakers use language.

Linguistics has many sub-fields concerned with particular aspects of linguistic structure. The theory that elucidates on these, as propounded by Noam Chomsky, is known as [[generative linguistics|generative theory]] or [[universal grammar]]. These sub-fields range from those focused primarily on form to those focused primarily on meaning. They also run the gamut of level of analysis of language, from individual sounds, to words, to phrases, up to cultural discourse.

===Grammar===

Sub-fields that focus on a grammatical study of language include the following.

* '''[[Phonetics]]''', the study of the physical properties of speech sound production and perception
* '''[[Phonology]]''', the study of sounds as abstract elements in the speaker's mind that distinguish meaning ([[phonemes]])
* '''[[Morphology (linguistics)|Morphology]]''', the study of [[morphemes]], or the internal structures of words and how they can be modified
* '''[[Syntax]]''', the study of how words combine to form grammatical phrases and [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentences]]
* '''[[Semantics]]''', the study of the meaning of words ([[lexical semantics]]) and fixed word combinations ([[phraseology]]), and how these combine to form the [[meaning (linguistics)|meanings]] of sentences
* '''[[Pragmatics]]''', the study of how [[utterance]]s are used in [[speech acts|communicative acts]], and the role played by context and non-linguistic knowledge in the transmission of meaning
* '''[[Discourse analysis]]''', the analysis of language use in [[Text (literary theory)|texts]] (spoken, written, or signed)
* '''[[Stylistics (field of study)|Stylistics]]''', the study of linguistic factors (rhetoric, diction, stress) that place a discourse in context
* '''[[Semiotics]]''', the study of signs and sign processes (semiosis), indication, designation, likeness, analogy, metaphor, symbolism, signification, and communication

===Style===
[[Stylistics (field of study)|Stylistics]] is the study and interpretation of texts for aspects of their linguistic and tonal style. Stylistic analysis entails the analysis of description of particular [[dialects]] and [[register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] used by speech communities. Stylistic features include [[rhetoric]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Philosophy of Rhetoric |author=IA Richards |year=1965 |publisher=Oxford University Press (New York)}}&lt;/ref&gt; diction, stress, [[satire]], [[irony]], dialogue, and other forms of phonetic variations. Stylistic analysis can also include the study of language in canonical works of literature, popular fiction, news, advertisements, and other forms of communication in popular culture as well. It is usually seen as a variation in communication that changes from speaker to speaker and community to community. In short, Stylistics is the interpretation of text.

==Approaches==

===Theoretical===
One major debate in linguistics concerns the very nature of language and how it should be understood. Some linguists hypothesize that there is a [[language module|module]] in the [[human brain]] that allows people to undertake linguistic behaviour, which is part of the [[formal grammar|formalist]] approach. This "[[universal grammar]]" is considered to guide children when they learn language and to constrain what sentences are considered grammatical in any human language. Proponents of this view, which is predominant in those schools of linguistics that are based on the [[generative linguistics|generative]] theory of [[Noam Chomsky]], do not necessarily consider that language evolved for communication in particular. They consider instead that it has more to do with the process of structuring human thought (see also [[formal grammar]]).

===Functional===
Another group of linguists, by contrast, use the term "language" to refer to a communication system that developed to support [[cooperation|cooperative activity]] and extend cooperative networks. Such [[functional theories of grammar|theories of grammar]], called "functional", view language as a tool that emerged and is adapted to the communicative needs of its users, and the role of [[cultural evolution]]ary processes are often emphasized over that of [[biological evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Daniela | last=Isac |author2=Charles Reiss  | title= I-language: An Introduction to Linguistics as Cognitive Science, 2nd edition |url= http://linguistics.concordia.ca/i-language/ | year=2013 | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0199660179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
Linguistics is primarily [[descriptive linguistics|descriptive]].&lt;ref name="Martinet" /&gt; Linguists describe and explain features of language without making subjective judgments on whether a particular feature or usage is "good" or "bad". This is analogous to practice in other sciences: a [[zoologist]] studies the animal kingdom without making subjective judgments on whether a particular species is "better" or "worse" than another.

[[Linguistic prescription|Prescription]], on the other hand, is an attempt to promote particular linguistic usages over others, often favouring a particular dialect or "[[acrolect]]". This may have the aim of establishing a [[Standard language|linguistic standard]], which can aid communication over large geographical areas. It may also, however, be an attempt by speakers of one language or dialect to exert influence over speakers of other languages or dialects (see [[Linguistic imperialism]]). An extreme version of prescriptivism can be found among [[censorship|censors]], who attempt to eradicate words and structures that they consider to be destructive to society. Prescription, however, may be practised appropriately in the [[teaching of language]], like in [[English language teaching|ELT]], where certain fundamental grammatical rules and lexical terms need to be introduced to a second-language speaker who is attempting to [[language acquisition|acquire]] the language.

===Anthropology===
The objective of describing languages is often to uncover cultural knowledge about communities. The use of [[anthropology|anthropological]] methods of investigation on linguistic sources leads to the discovery of certain cultural traits among a speech community through its linguistic features. It is also widely used as a tool in [[language documentation]], with an endeavour to curate [[endangered languages]]. However, now, linguistic inquiry uses the anthropological method to understand cognitive, historical, sociolinguistic and historical processes that languages undergo as they change and evolve, as well as general anthropological inquiry uses the linguistic method to excavate into culture. In all aspects, anthropological inquiry usually uncovers the different variations and relativities that underlie the usage of language.

===Sources===
Most contemporary linguists work under the assumption that [[spoken language|spoken data]] and [[Sign language|signed data]] are more fundamental than [[written language|written data]]. This is because
* Speech appears to be universal to all human beings capable of producing and perceiving it, while there have been many [[culture]]s and speech communities that lack written communication;
* Features appear in speech which aren't always recorded in writing, including [[phonological rule]]s, [[sound change]]s, and [[speech error]]s;
* All natural writing systems reflect a spoken language (or potentially a signed one), even with [[pictographic]] scripts like [[Dongba]] writing [[Naxi language|Naxi]] [[homophone]]s with the same pictogram, and text in writing systems used for [[List of languages by writing system|two languages]] changing to fit the spoken language being recorded;
* Speech evolved before human beings invented writing;
* People learnt to speak and process spoken language more easily and earlier than they did with [[writing]].

Nonetheless, linguists agree that the study of written language can be worthwhile and valuable. For research that relies on [[corpus linguistics]] and [[computational linguistics]], written language is often much more convenient for processing large amounts of linguistic data. Large corpora of spoken language are difficult to create and hard to find, and are typically [[transcription (linguistics)|transcribed]] and written. In addition, linguists have turned to text-based discourse occurring in various formats of [[computer-mediated communication]] as a viable site for linguistic inquiry.

The study of [[writing systems]] themselves, [[graphemics]], is, in any case, considered a branch of linguistics.

===Analysis===
Before the 20th century, linguists analysed language on a [[diachronic linguistics|diachronic]] plane, which was historical in focus. This meant that they would compare linguistic features and try to analyse language from the point of view of how it had changed between then and later. However, with [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussurean]] linguistics in the 20th century, the focus shifted to a more [[synchronic linguistics|synchronic]] approach, where the study was more geared towards analysis and comparison between different language variations, which existed at the same given point of time.

At another level, the [[syntagmatic analysis|syntagmatic]] plane of linguistic analysis entails the comparison between the way words are sequenced, within the syntax of a sentence. For example, the article "the" is followed by a noun, because of the syntagmatic relation between the words. The [[paradigmatic analysis|paradigmatic]] plane on the other hand, focuses on an analysis that is based on the [[paradigms]] or concepts that are embedded in a given text. In this case, words of the same type or class may be replaced in the text with each other to achieve the same conceptual understanding.

==History==
{{main|History of linguistics}}

===Early grammarians===
{{main|Philology|History of English grammars}}

The formal study of language began in [[India]] with [[Pāṇini]], the 6th century BC grammarian who formulated 3,959 rules of [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. Pāṇini's systematic classification of the sounds of Sanskrit into [[consonant]]s and [[vowel]]s, and word classes, such as nouns and verbs, was the first known instance of its kind. In the [[Middle East]], [[Sibawayh]], a non-Arab, made a detailed description of Arabic in AD 760 in his monumental work, ''Al-kitab fi al-nahw'' ({{lang|ar|الكتاب في النحو}}, ''The Book on Grammar''), the first known author to distinguish between [[phonetics|sounds]] and [[phonology|phonemes (sounds as units of a linguistic system)]].  Western interest in the study of languages began somewhat later than in the East,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloomfield|1983|p=307}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but the grammarians of the classical languages did not use the same methods or reach the same conclusions as their contemporaries in the Indic world. Early interest in language in the West was a part of philosophy, not of grammatical description. The first insights into semantic theory were made by [[Plato]] in his [[Cratylus (dialogue)|''Cratylus'' dialogue]], where he argues that words denote concepts that are eternal and exist in the world of ideas. This work is the first to use the word [[etymology]] to describe the history of a word's meaning. Around 280 BC, one of [[Alexander the Great]]'s successors founded a university (see [[Musaeum]]) in [[Alexandria]], where a school of philologists studied the ancient texts in and taught [[Greek language|Greek]] to speakers of other languages. While this school was the first to use the word "[[grammar]]" in its modern sense, Plato had used the word in its original meaning as "[[Art of Grammar|téchnē grammatikḗ]]" ({{script|Grek|Τέχνη Γραμματική}}), the "art of writing", which is also the title of one of the most important works of the Alexandrine school by [[Dionysius Thrax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Seuren, Pieter A. M.  |year=1998|title=Western linguistics: An historical introduction|publisher=Wiley-blackwell|isbn=0-631-20891-7|pages=2–24|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the [[Middle Ages]], the study of language was subsumed under the topic of philology, the study of ancient languages and texts, practised by such educators as [[Roger Ascham]], [[Wolfgang Ratke]], and [[John Amos Comenius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloomfield|1983|p=308}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparative philology===
In the 18th century, the first use of the [[comparative method]] by [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]] sparked the rise of [[comparative linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloomfield|1983|p=310}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Bloomfield attributes "the first great scientific linguistic work of the world" to [[Jacob Grimm]], who wrote ''Deutsche Grammatik''.&lt;ref name="Bloomfield 1914 311"&gt;{{harvnb|Bloomfield|1983|p=311}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was soon followed by other authors writing similar comparative studies on other language groups of Europe. The study of language was broadened from [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] to language in general by [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]], of whom Bloomfield asserts:&lt;ref name="Bloomfield 1914 311"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This study received its foundation at the hands of the Prussian statesman and scholar Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767–1835), especially in the first volume of his work on Kavi, the literary language of Java, entitled ''Über die Verschiedenheit des menschlichen Sprachbaues und ihren Einfluß auf die geistige Entwickelung des Menschengeschlechts'' (''On the Variety of the Structure of Human Language and its Influence upon the Mental Development of the Human Race'').&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Structuralism===
{{main|Structuralism (linguistics)}}
Early in the 20th century, [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]] introduced the idea of language as a static system of interconnected units, defined through the oppositions between them. By introducing a distinction between [[Diachronic linguistics|diachronic]] and [[Synchronic linguistics|synchronic]] analyses of language, he laid the foundation of the modern discipline of linguistics. Saussure also introduced several basic dimensions of linguistic analysis that are still foundational in many contemporary linguistic theories, such as the distinctions between [[syntagmatic analysis|syntagm]] and [[paradigmatic analysis|paradigm]], and the [[Langue and parole|langue- parole distinction]], distinguishing language as an abstract system (''langue'') from language as a concrete manifestation of this system (''parole'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sources of Semiotic: Readings with Commentary from Antiquity to the Present |first=David S. |last=Clarke |year=1990|location=Carbondale|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|pages=143–144 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-vZDmu_4_CUC&amp;pg=PA143 |isbn=9780809316144 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Substantial additional contributions following Saussure's definition of a structural approach to language came from [[Prague school (linguistics)|The Prague school]], [[Leonard Bloomfield]], [[Charles F. Hockett]], [[Louis Hjelmslev]], [[Émile Benveniste]] and [[Roman Jakobson]].&lt;ref name="Holquist81"&gt;{{harvnb|Holquist|1981|pp=xvii–xviii}}.{{citation not found}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Course in General Linguistics |first=Ferdinand |last=de Saussure |publisher=McGraw Hill |location=New York |isbn=0-8022-1493-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Generativism===
{{main|Generative linguistics}}
During the last half of the 20th century, following the work of [[Noam Chomsky]], linguistics was dominated by the [[Generative grammar|generativist school]]. While formulated by Chomsky in part as a way to explain how human beings [[language acquisition|acquire language]] and the biological constraints on this acquisition, in practice it has largely been concerned with giving formal accounts of specific phenomena in natural languages. Generative theory is [[Language module|modularist]] and formalist in character. Chomsky built on earlier work of [[Zellig Harris]] to formulate the generative theory of language. According to this theory the most basic form of language is a set of syntactic rules universal for all humans and underlying the grammars of all human languages. This set of rules is called [[Universal Grammar]], and for Chomsky describing it is the primary objective of the discipline of linguistics. For this reason the grammars of individual languages are of importance to linguistics only in so far as they allow us to discern the universal underlying rules from which the observable linguistic variability is generated.

In the classic formalization of generative grammars first proposed by [[Noam Chomsky]] in the 1950s,&lt;ref name="Chomsky1956"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Chomsky, Noam | title = Three Models for the Description of Language | journal = [[IRE Transactions on Information Theory]] | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 113 123 | year = 1956 | doi = 10.1109/TIT.1956.1056813 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chomsky1957"&gt;{{Cite book | author = Chomsky, Noam | title = Syntactic Structures | publisher = [[Mouton de Gruyter|Mouton]] | location = The Hague | year = 1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; a grammar ''G'' consists of the following components:

* A finite set ''N'' of ''[[nonterminal symbol]]s'', none of which appear in strings formed from ''G''.
* A finite set &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; of ''[[terminal symbol]]s'' that is [[Disjoint sets|disjoint]] from ''N''.
* A finite set ''P'' of ''production rules'', that map from one string of symbols to another.
A formal description of language attempts to replicate a speaker's knowledge of the rules of their language, and the aim is to produce a set of rules that is minimally sufficient to successfully model valid linguistic forms.

===Functionalism===
{{main|Functional theories of grammar}}
Functional theories of language propose that since language is fundamentally a tool, it is reasonable to assume that its structures are best analysed and understood with reference to the functions they carry out. Functional theories of grammar differ from [[Formal grammar|formal theories of grammar]], in that the latter seek to define the different elements of language and describe the way they relate to each other as systems of formal rules or operations, whereas the former defines the functions performed by language and then relates these functions to the linguistic elements that carry them out. This means that functional theories of grammar tend to pay attention to the way language is actually used, and not just to the formal relations between linguistic elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Functional Theories of Grammar|author=Nichols, Johanna|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=13|year=1984|quote=[Functional grammar] analyzes grammatical structure, as do formal and structural grammar; but it also analyses the entire communicative situation: the purpose of the speech event, its participants, its discourse context. Functionalists maintain that the communicative situation motivates, constrains, explains, or otherwise determines grammatical structure, and that a structural or formal approach is not merely limited to an artificially restricted data base, but is inadequate as a structural account. Functional grammar, then, differs from formulae and structural grammar in that it purports not to model but to explain; and the explanation is grounded in the communicative situation.|doi=10.1146/annurev.an.13.100184.000525|pages=97–117|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Functional theories describe language in term of the functions existing at all levels of language.
*Phonological function: the function of the [[phoneme]] is to distinguish between different lexical material.
*Semantic function: ([[Agent (linguistics)|Agent]], [[Patient (linguistics)|Patient]], Recipient, etc.), describing the role of participants in states of affairs or actions expressed.
*Syntactic functions: (e.g. [[Subject (grammar)|Subject]] and [[Object (grammar)|Object]]), defining different perspectives in the presentation of a linguistic expression
*Pragmatic functions: ([[Topic–comment|Theme and Rheme]], [[Topic (linguistics)|Topic]] and [[Focus (linguistics)|Focus]], [[Predicate (grammar)|Predicate]]), defining the informational status of constituents, determined by the pragmatic context of the verbal interaction. Functional descriptions of grammar strive to explain how linguistic functions are performed in communication through the use of linguistic forms.

===Cognitive linguistics===
{{main|Cognitive linguistics}}
Cognitive linguistics emerged as a reaction to generativist theory in the 1970s and 1980s. Led by theorists like [[Ronald Langacker]] and [[George Lakoff]], cognitive linguists propose that language is an [[emergentism|emergent]] property of basic, general-purpose cognitive processes. In contrast to the generativist school of linguistics, cognitive linguistics is non-modularist and functionalist in character. Important developments in cognitive linguistics include [[cognitive grammar]], [[Frame semantics (linguistics)|frame semantics]], and [[conceptual metaphor]], all of which are based on the idea that form–function correspondences based on representations derived from [[embodied cognition|embodied experience]] constitute the basic units of language.

Cognitive linguistics interprets language in terms of concepts (sometimes universal, sometimes specific to a particular tongue) that underlie its form. It is thus closely associated with [[semantics]] but is distinct from [[psycholinguistics]], which draws upon empirical findings from cognitive psychology in order to explain the mental processes that underlie the acquisition, storage, production and understanding of speech and writing.  Unlike generative theory, [[cognitive linguistics]] denies that there is an ''autonomous linguistic faculty'' in the mind; it understands grammar in terms of ''conceptualization''; and claims that knowledge of language arises out of ''language use''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cognitive Linguistics|author1=Croft, William  |author2=D. Alan Cruse |lastauthoramp=yes|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|year=2004|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its conviction that knowledge of language is learned through use, cognitive linguistics is sometimes considered to be a functional approach, but it differs from other functional approaches in that it is primarily concerned with how the mind creates meaning through language, and not with the use of language as a tool of communication.

==Areas of research==

===Historical linguistics===
[[Historical linguistics|Historical linguists]] study the history of specific languages as well as general characteristics of language change. The study of language change is also referred to as "diachronic linguistics" (the study of how one particular language has changed over time), which can be distinguished from  "synchronic linguistics" (the comparative study of more than one language at a given moment in time without regard to previous stages). Historical linguistics was among the first sub-disciplines to emerge in linguistics, and was the most widely practised form of linguistics in the late 19th century. However, there was a shift to the synchronic approach in the early twentieth century with [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]], and became more predominant in western linguistics with the work of [[Noam Chomsky]].

===Ecolinguistics===
[[Ecolinguistics]] explores the role of language in the life-sustaining interactions of humans, other species and the physical environment. The first aim is to develop linguistic theories which see humans not only as part of society, but also as part of the larger ecosystems that life depends on. The second aim is to show how linguistics can be used to address key ecological issues, from climate change and [[biodiversity loss]] to environmental justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ecolinguistics-association.org/ |title=Ecolinguistics Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociolinguistics===
[[Sociolinguistics]] is the study of how language is shaped by social factors. This sub-discipline focuses on the synchronic approach of linguistics, and looks at how a language in general, or a set of languages, display variation and varieties at a given point in time. The study of language variation and the different varieties of language through dialects, registers, and ideolects can be tackled through a study of style, as well as through analysis of discourse. Sociolinguists research on both style and discourse in language, and also study the theoretical factors that are at play between language and society.

===Developmental linguistics===
[[Developmental linguistics]] is the study of the development of linguistic ability in individuals, particularly [[Language acquisition|the acquisition of language]] in childhood. Some of the questions that developmental linguistics looks into is how children acquire different languages, how adults can acquire a second language, and what the process of language acquisition is.

===Neurolinguistics===
[[Neurolinguistics]] is the study of the structures in the human brain that underlie grammar and communication. Researchers are drawn to the field from a variety of backgrounds, bringing along a variety of experimental techniques as well as widely varying theoretical perspectives. Much work in neurolinguistics is informed by models in [[psycholinguistics]] and [[theoretical linguistics]], and is focused on investigating how the brain can implement the processes that theoretical and psycholinguistics propose are necessary in producing and comprehending language. Neurolinguists study the physiological mechanisms by which the brain processes information related to language, and evaluate linguistic and psycholinguistic theories, using [[aphasiology]], [[brain imaging]], electrophysiology, and computer modelling. Amongst the structures of the brain involved in the mechanisms of neurolinguistics, the cerebellum which contains the highest numbers of neurons has a major role in terms of predictions required to produce language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mariën|first=Peter|last2=Manto|first2=Mario|date=2017-10-25|title=Cerebellum as a Master-Piece for Linguistic Predictability|journal=Cerebellum (London, England)|volume=17|issue=2|pages=101–103|doi=10.1007/s12311-017-0894-1|issn=1473-4230|pmid=29071518}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applied linguistics==
{{Main|Applied linguistics}}
Linguists are largely concerned with finding and [[descriptive linguistics|describing]] the generalities and varieties both within particular languages and among all languages. [[Applied linguistics]] takes the results of those findings and "applies" them to other areas. Linguistic research is commonly applied to areas such as [[language education]], [[lexicography]], [[translation]], [[language planning]], which involves governmental policy implementation related to language use, and [[natural language processing]]. "Applied linguistics" has been argued to be something of a misnomer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Controversies in Applied Linguistics (pp. 288) |author=Barbara Seidlhofer |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2003 |isbn=0194374440}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applied linguists actually focus on making sense of and engineering solutions for real-world linguistic problems, and not literally "applying" existing technical knowledge from linguistics. Moreover, they commonly apply technical knowledge from multiple sources, such as sociology (e.g., conversation analysis) and anthropology. ([[Constructed language]] fits under Applied linguistics.)

Today, computers are widely used in many areas of applied linguistics. [[Speech synthesis]] and [[speech recognition]] use phonetic and phonemic knowledge to provide voice interfaces to computers. Applications of [[computational linguistics]] in [[machine translation]], [[computer-assisted translation]], and [[natural language processing]] are areas of applied linguistics that have come to the forefront. Their influence has had an effect on theories of syntax and semantics, as modelling syntactic and semantic theories on computers constraints.

Linguistic analysis is a sub-discipline of applied linguistics used by many governments to verify the claimed [[nationality]] of people seeking asylum who do not hold the necessary documentation to prove their claim.&lt;ref name="Linguistic Analysis"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Applied Linguistics and Language Analysis in Asylum Seeker Cases | last=Eades | first=Diana | journal=Applied Linguistics | year=2005 | volume=26 | issue=4 | pages=503–526 | doi=10.1093/applin/ami021 | url=http://songchau.googlepages.com/503.pdf | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; This often takes the form of an [[interview]] by personnel in an immigration department. Depending on the country, this interview is conducted either in the asylum seeker's [[native language]] through an [[language interpretation|interpreter]] or in an international ''[[lingua franca]]'' like English.&lt;ref name="Linguistic Analysis"/&gt; Australia uses the former method, while Germany employs the latter; the Netherlands uses either method depending on the languages involved.&lt;ref name="Linguistic Analysis"/&gt; Tape recordings of the interview then undergo language analysis, which can be done either by private contractors or within a department of the government. In this analysis, linguistic features of the asylum seeker are used by analysts to make a determination about the speaker's nationality. The reported findings of the linguistic analysis can play a critical role in the government's decision on the refugee status of the asylum seeker.&lt;ref name="Linguistic Analysis"/&gt;

==Interdisciplinary fields==
Within the broad discipline of linguistics, various emerging sub-disciplines focus on a more detailed description and analysis of language, and are often organized on the basis of the school of thought and theoretical approach that they pre-suppose, or the external factors that influence them.

===Semiotics===
[[Semiotics]] is the study of sign processes (semiosis), or signification and communication, signs, and symbols, both individually and grouped into sign systems, including the study of how meaning is constructed and understood. Semioticians often do not restrict themselves to linguistic communication when studying the use of signs but extend the meaning of "sign" to cover all kinds of cultural symbols. Nonetheless, semiotic disciplines closely related to linguistics are [[literary studies]], [[discourse analysis]], [[text linguistics]], and [[philosophy of language]]. Semiotics, within the linguistics paradigm, is the study of the relationship between language and culture. Historically, [[Edward Sapir]] and [[Ferdinand De Saussure]]'s structuralist theories influenced the study of signs extensively until the late part of the 20th century, but later, post-modern and post-structural thought, through language philosophers including [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], [[Michel Foucault]], and others, have also been a considerable influence on the discipline in the late part of the 20th century and early 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Classical Roots of Post-Structuralism: Lacan, Derrida and Foucault |journal=International Journal of the Classical Tradition  |first= Paul Allen |last=Miller |publisher=Springer |year=1998 |jstor=30222818|ref=harv|volume=5 |issue=2  |pages=204–225 |doi=10.1007/bf02688423}}&lt;/ref&gt; These theories emphasize the role of language variation, and the idea of subjective usage, depending on external elements like social and cultural factors, rather than merely on the interplay of formal elements.

===Language documentation===
Since the inception of the discipline of linguistics, linguists have been concerned with describing and analysing previously [[language documentation|undocumented languages]]. Starting with [[Franz Boas]] in the early 1900s, this became the main focus of American linguistics until the rise of formal structural linguistics in the mid-20th century. This focus on language documentation was partly motivated by a concern to document the rapidly [[language death|disappearing]] languages of indigenous peoples. The ethnographic dimension of the Boasian approach to language description played a role in the development of disciplines such as [[sociolinguistics]], [[anthropological linguistics]], and [[linguistic anthropology]], which investigate the relations between language, culture, and society.

The emphasis on linguistic description and documentation has also gained prominence outside North America, with the documentation of rapidly dying indigenous languages becoming a primary focus in many university programmes in linguistics. Language description is a work-intensive endeavour, usually requiring years of field work in the language concerned, so as to equip the linguist to write a sufficiently accurate reference grammar. Further, the task of documentation requires the linguist to collect a substantial corpus in the language in question, consisting of texts and recordings, both sound and video, which can be stored in an accessible format within open repositories, and used for further research.&lt;ref&gt;Himmelman, Nikolaus "Language documentation: What is it and what is it good for?" in P. Gippert, Jost, Nikolaus P Himmelmann &amp; Ulrike Mosel. (2006) ''Essentials of Language documentation''. Mouton de Gruyter, Berlin &amp; New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Translation===
The sub-field of [[translation]] includes the translation of written and spoken texts across mediums, from digital to print and spoken. To translate literally means to transmute the meaning from one language into another. Translators are often employed by organizations, such as travel agencies as well as governmental embassies to facilitate communication between two speakers who do not know each other's language. Translators are also employed to work within [[computational linguistics]] setups like [[Google Translate]] for example, which is an automated, programmed facility to translate words and phrases between any two or more given languages. Translation is also conducted by publishing houses, which convert works of writing from one language to another in order to reach varied audiences. Academic Translators, specialize and semi specialize on various other disciplines such as; Technology, Science, Law, Economics etc.

===Biolinguistics===
[[Biolinguistics]] is the study of the biology and evolution of language. It is a highly interdisciplinary field, including linguists, biologists, neuroscientists, psychologists, mathematicians, and others. By shifting the focus of investigation in linguistics to a comprehensive scheme that embraces natural sciences, it seeks to yield a framework by which the fundamentals of the faculty of language are understood.

===Clinical linguistics===
Clinical linguistics is the application of linguistic theory to the fields of [[Speech-Language Pathology]]. Speech language pathologists work on corrective measures to cure [[communication disorders]] and swallowing disorders

Chaika (1990) showed that people with schizophrenia who display speech disorders, like rhyming inappropriately, have attentional dysfunction, as when a patient, shown a colour chip and then asked to identify it, responded "looks like clay. Sounds like gray. Take you for a roll in the hay. Heyday, May Day." The color chip was actually clay-colored, so his first response was correct.'

However, most people suppress or ignore words which rhyme with what they've said unless they are deliberately producing a pun, poem or rap. Even then, the speaker shows connection between words chosen for rhyme and an overall meaning in discourse. People with schizophrenia with speech dysfunction show no such relation between rhyme and reason. Some even produce stretches of gibberish combined with recognizable words.&lt;ref&gt;Chaika, Elaine Ostrach. 1990. Understanding Psychotic Speech: Between Freud and Chomsky. Chas. Thomas Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computational linguistics===
[[Computational linguistics]] is the study of linguistic issues in a way that is "computationally responsible", i.e., taking careful note of computational consideration of algorithmic specification and computational complexity, so that the linguistic theories devised can be shown to exhibit certain desirable computational properties and their implementations. Computational linguists also work on computer language and software development.

===Evolutionary linguistics===
[[Evolutionary linguistics]] is the interdisciplinary study of the emergence of the language faculty through [[human evolution]], and also the application of [[evolution|evolutionary theory]] to the study of cultural evolution among different languages. It is also a study of the dispersal of various languages across the globe, through movements among ancient communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Croft | first = William |date=October 2008 | title = Evolutionary Linguistics | journal = Annual Review of Anthropology | volume = 37 | pages = 219–234  | publisher = Annual Reviews | doi = 10.1146/annurev.anthro.37.081407.085156 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forensic linguistics===
[[Forensic linguistics]] is the application of linguistic analysis to [[forensics]]. Forensic analysis investigates on the style, language, lexical use, and other linguistic and grammatical features used in the legal context to provide evidence in courts of law. Forensic linguists have also contributed expertise in criminal cases.

The '''list of higher education institutions with open Title IX Sexual Violence investigations''', is a public list of institutions under investigation by the [[Office for Civil Rights]] in the [[United States Department of Education]], first made public on May 1, 2014.&lt;ref name=EDAnnounce&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Department of Education Releases List of Higher Education Institutions with Open Title IX Sexual Violence Investigations|url=http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-releases-list-higher-education-institutions-open-title-i|website=U.S. Department of Education|accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When announcing the schools under investigation, Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights [[Catherine E. Lhamon]] suggested that "increased transparency will spur community dialogue about this important issue... and foster better public awareness of civil rights."&lt;ref name=EDAnnounce/&gt;

Investigations previously went unannounced, and were known only to members of university and college communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Steinhauer|first1=Jennifer|last2=Joachim|first2=David|title=55 Colleges Named in Federal Inquiry Into Handling of Sexual Assault Cases|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/02/us/politics/us-lists-colleges-under-inquiry-over-sex-assault-cases.html?_r=0|accessdate=6 August 2014|date=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This list constitutes the first time the federal government has announced ongoing sexual violence investigations. The decision to release the names of universities and colleges under investigation was due to pressure from both the [[White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault]] and the [[New Campus Anti-Rape Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Newman|first1=Jonah|last2=Sander|first2=Libby|title=Promise Unfulfilled?|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Promise-Unfulfilled-/146299/|accessdate=2014-08-09|agency=Chronicle of Higher Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly, Lhamon continued, "a college or university's appearance on this list and being the subject of a Title IX investigation in no way indicates at this stage that the college or university is violating or has violated the law."&lt;ref name=EDAnnounce/&gt;

There are critics of the list on both sides of campus anti-rape politics. Andrea Pino, a complainant against [[University of North Carolina|UNC-Chapel Hill]] and co-founder of [[End Rape on Campus]], told the Huffington Post that ""Announcing an investigation can open survivors to retaliation, and it's important that the OCR also take emphasis on providing survivors an option to opt out of having their investigation announced if it could endanger them, especially in small institutions where anonymity is less of an option."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kingkade|first1=Tyler|title=55 Colleges Face Sexual Assault Investigations|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/01/college-sexual-assault_n_5247267.html|accessdate=10 October 2014|date=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations like FIRE have argued that the OCR list—along with its precursor the [[Dear colleague letter]]—violates the rights to due process for both institutions and individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Robert|title=On Sexual Harassment and Title IX|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2011/08/30/on_sexual_harassment_and_title_ix_111065.html|accessdate=10 October 2014|date=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4594">A '''maxim''' is a concise expression of a fundamental [[morality|moral]] rule or principle, whether considered as [[wikt:objectivity|objective]] or [[subjectivity|subjective]] contingent on one's [[philosophy]]. A maxim is often [[pedagogy|pedagogical]] and motivates specific actions. The ''[[Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy]]'' defines it as:
{{quote|Generally any simple and memorable rule or guide for living; for example, 'neither a borrower nor a lender be'. [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]] speaks of 'a little hoard of maxims preaching down a daughter's heart ([[Locksley Hall]]), and maxims have generally been associated with a 'folksy' or 'copy-book' approach to [[moral]]ity.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy, Maxim (Oxford University Press 2008) p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Deontological ethics==

In [[deontological ethics]], mainly in [[Kantian ethics]], maxims are understood as [[subjectivity|subjective]] principles of action. A maxim is thought to be part of an agent's thought process for every rational action, indicating in its standard form: (1)&amp;nbsp;the action, or type of action; (2)&amp;nbsp;the conditions under which it is to be done; and (3)&amp;nbsp;the end or purpose to be achieved by the action, or the motive. The maxim of an action is often referred to as the agent's intention. In Kantian ethics, the [[categorical imperative]] provides a test on maxims for determining whether the actions they refer to are right, wrong, or permissible.

The categorical imperative is stated canonically as: "Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law."&lt;ref name="Ellington"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kant|first=Immanuel|authorlink=Immanuel Kant |translator=James W. Ellington |title=Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals 3rd ed.|publisher=Hackett|date=1993|pages=30|isbn=0-87220-166-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''[[Critique of Practical Reason]]'', [[Immanuel Kant]] provided the following example of a maxim and of how to apply the test of the categorical imperative:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I have, for example, made it my maxim to increase my wealth by any safe means. Now I have a deposit in my hands, the owner of which has died and left no record of it. . . . I therefore apply the maxim to the present case and ask whether it could indeed take the form of a law, and consequently whether I could through my maxim at the same time give such a law as this: that everyone may deny a deposit which no one can prove has been made. I at once become aware that such a principle, as a law, would annihilate itself since it would bring it about that there would be no deposits at all.&lt;ref name="Gregor"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kant|first=Immanuel|authorlink=Immanuel Kant|translator=Mary Gregor |title=Critique of Practical Reason|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=1997|pages=25/5:27|isbn=0-521-59051-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also, an action is said to have "moral worth" if the maxim upon which the agent acts cites the purpose of conforming to a moral requirement. That is, a person's action has moral worth when he does his [[duty]] purely for the sake of duty, or does the right thing for the right reason.  Kant himself believed that it is impossible to know whether anyone's action has ever had moral worth. It might appear to someone that he has acted entirely "from duty", but this could always be an illusion of self-interest: of wanting to see oneself in the best, most noble light. This indicates that agents are not always the best judges of their own maxims or motives.

==Personal knowledge==
[[Michael Polanyi]] in his account of [[tacit knowledge]] stressed the importance of the maxim in focusing both explicit and implicit modes of understanding. “Maxims are rules, the correct application of which is part of the art they govern....Maxims can only function within a framework of personal (i.e., experiential) knowledge”.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Guy Claxton, ''Live and learn (1992) p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

In his early writings Cernovich focused on [[antifeminism]], men's empowerment, and how to meet women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;The title of Danger and Play came from a quote by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], "The true man wants two things: danger and play. For that reason he wants woman, as the most dangerous plaything." In 2014, Cernovich promoted [[Gamergate controversy|Gamergate]], a controversy during which several women in the [[video game industry]] were targeted by Internet trolls, goading opponents with tweets such as "Who cares about breast cancer and rape? Not me."&lt;ref name="Marantz-31-10-16" /&gt;

In 2015, Cernovich wrote a [[self-published]] self-help book, ''Gorilla Mindset''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalreview.com/sites/default/files/nrdpdf/20170710.pdf#page=24 |title=Info |website=www.nationalreview.com |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, he tweeted, "Women love aggressive men, but only if they are alpha males."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to ''The New York Times'' in April 2017, Cernovich has long been criticized for arguing that date rape is a "harmful concept for men and women."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He saw [[Donald Trump]] as a kindred spirit and began to engage in political commentary.&lt;ref name="Marantz-31-10-16" /&gt;

== Media ==
Cernovich had previously – in early 2006 – published an article deriding Trump on Crime &amp; Federalism. The piece referred to the billionaire as a "media whore" who "casts his image to the world on demand and recasts it constantly to suit everchanging ratings and marketing schemes," and advised to "never trust a man who combs his hair so as to cover his shiny dome, and then flaunts a wife young enough to be his daughter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crimeandfederalism.com/2006/01/donald_chump.html |title=Donald Chump? |first=Michael |last=Cernovich |website=''Crime &amp; Federalism''|accessdate=May 26, 2018 |language=en |date=January 29, 2006 |archive-url=https://archive.fo/rZAY2 |archive-date=2017-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cernovich became influential on [[social media]], initially as part of the [[manosphere]] movement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kutner |first1=Max |title=Roosh V's journey from pickup artist to right-wing provocateur |url=http://www.newsweek.com/2016/10/21/roosh-v-pickup-artist-right-wing-provocateur-509319.html |accessdate=October 11, 2017 |work=Newsweek |date=October 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently has helped to shape [[Far-right politics|far-right]] narratives in the United States.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He falsely claimed during the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 United States presidential election]] that [[Hillary Clinton]] had a "seizure disorder" and [[Parkinson's disease]]. By September his #HillarysHealth [[hashtag]] had gotten 240,000 page views and had become a national [[trending topic]] on [[Twitter]]. During the month of September, Cernovich's tweets were seen more than 100 million times.&lt;ref name="Marantz-31-10-16" /&gt;

Cernovich frequently calls his adversaries "cucks", a variant of the alt-right slang word [[cuckservative]], a pejorative term for conservatives who supposedly betray conservative social values. In reference to this he has written, "To beat a person, you lower his or her social status. [[Logic]] is pointless."&lt;ref name="Marantz-31-10-16" /&gt; Cernovich admits to sometimes using [[Internet troll|trolling tactics]], which he says he uses to build his brand rather than for his own amusement.&lt;ref name="Marantz-31-10-16" /&gt;

Cernovich helped popularize the false [[Pizzagate conspiracy theory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Dissecting the #PizzaGate Conspiracy Theories |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/12/10/business/media/pizzagate.html |work=The New York Times |date=December 10, 2016 |last=Huang |first=Gregor Aisch, Jon|access-date=April 6, 2017 |last2=Kang |first2=Cecilia |issn=0362-4331 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161210112745/http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/12/10/business/media/pizzagate.html |archivedate=December 10, 2016 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; through his blog posts and believes that child sex rings run rampant in [[Washington, D.C.]] He has accused his opponents of being [[Pedophilia|pedophiles]] on multiple occasions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/12/how-mike-cernovich-is-pizzagating-his-latest-victim.html |title=How Mike Cernovich Is Pizzagating His Latest Victim |first=Jesse |last=Singal |publisher= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161222042112/http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/12/how-mike-cernovich-is-pizzagating-his-latest-victim.html |archivedate=December 22, 2016 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in a [[YouTube]] video maintained that most people employed by the news media and "every [[A-list]] actor" in [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] were also pedophiles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In October 2016 Cernovich said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The left likes to talk about power structures, right? Well, the media still thinks of itself as speaking truth to power. What they don't realize is that someone like me is perceived as the new [[Fourth Estate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/07/business/media/medias-next-challenge-overcoming-the-threat-of-fake-news.html |title=Media's Next Challenge: Overcoming the Threat of Fake News |last1=Rutenberg |first1=Jim |date=November 6, 2016 |work=[[The New York Times]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302211127/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/07/business/media/medias-next-challenge-overcoming-the-threat-of-fake-news.html |archivedate=March 2, 2017 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maybe they should check their structural privilege." The "paternalistic" media, he said, was giving way to a more democratic one. "It makes journalists crazy, because they used to be in control. They can't control people anymore. Everyone has a voice now."&lt;ref name="Marantz-31-10-16" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following an August 2016 appearance on [[Fox News]]'s ''[[Red Eye (talk show)|Red Eye]]'', the show's producers felt compelled afterwards to say that they had made a mistake in booking him when later learning of Cernovich's history of online disputes.&lt;ref name="The Daily Beast"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/08/09/why-did-fox-news-welcome-date-rape-apologist-mike-cernovich.html |title=Why Did Fox News Welcome Date Rape Apologist Mike Cernovich? |date=August 9, 2016 |work=[[The Daily Beast]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013173006/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/08/09/why-did-fox-news-welcome-date-rape-apologist-mike-cernovich.html |archivedate=October 13, 2016 |df=mdy-all |authorlink=Lloyd Grove |last=Grove |first=Lloyd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, the [[Anti-Defamation League]] accused Cernovich of commissioning and publishing a "blatantly anti-Semitic cartoon" by [[Ben Garrison]] as part of a campaign against President Donald Trump's national security adviser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.adl.org/blog/anti-semitism-used-in-attack-against-national-security-adviser-h-r-mcmaster |title=Anti-Semitism Used in Attack Against National Security Adviser H.

In November 2017, Cernovich spread misinformation linking the [[Sutherland Springs church shooting]] to [[Antifa (United States)|Antifa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/talalansari/fake-news-about-the-texas-church-shooting |title=Here Is The Misinformation Going Around About The Texas Church Shooting |work=BuzzFeed|access-date=November 6, 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===On sexual harassment===
In August 2012 Cernovich wrote that [[date rape]] "does not exist".&lt;ref name="The Daily Beast" /&gt; In October 2016 he wrote, "Lying about being in love to sleep with someone isn't rape. Getting played isn't rape. Regret isn't rape. Thinking, 'I might have been date raped,' means you weren't raped."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
In mid-November 2017, Cernovich offered $10,000 for information about congressional sexual harassment settlements. The next week, he sent documents concerning a case settled by [[John Conyers]] to [[BuzzFeed]], which vetted them and reported on them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/why-buzzfeed-teamed-with-a-far-right-figure-to-break-the-john-conyers-scandal/2017/11/21/64688b2a-ceca-11e7-9d3a-bcbe2af58c3a_story.html |title=Why BuzzFeed teamed with a far-right figure to break the John Conyers scandal |work=The Washington Post |last=Farhi |first=Paul |date=November 21, 2017 |accessdate=November 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cernovich encouraged all victims of sexual assault by congressmen to speak up and offered to cover their legal expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Basu |first=Ayushman |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/conspiracy-theorist-mike-cernovich-wants-sexual-assault-victims-congressmen-speak-2617798 |title=Conspiracy Theorist Mike Cernovich Wants Sexual Assault Victims Of Congressmen To Speak |work=International Business Times |date=November 22, 2017 |accessdate=November 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, Cernovich hosted an "Ask Me Anything" on [[Reddit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/7liww8/im_mike_cernovich_journalist_author_and_filmmaker/drmka91/ |title=I'm Mike Cernovich - Journalist, Author, and Filmmaker. Ask Me Anything |website=''Reddit'' |accessdate=May 26, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''AMA'', regarded as a failure by several media outlets, was dominated by users mocking him and asking questions about the rape allegations against him, his advice to men to nonconsensually expose their genitalia and masturbate in front of women who are unwilling to engage in sexual acts, and a supposed sexual encounter with a [[Kathoey|male-to-female transgender individual]] in [[Thailand]] (which Cernovich denied).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/mike-cernovich-hounded-on-rape-allegation-in-reddit-ama |title=Mike Cernovich Hounded on Rape Allegation in Reddit AMA |first=Ben |last=Collins |publisher=''The Daily Beast'' |accessdate=May 26, 2018 |language=en |date=December 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "20171222nymag"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nymag.com/selectall/2017/12/mike-cernovichs-ama-went-about-as-well-as-youd-expect.html |title=Mike Cernovich's Reddit Ask Me Anything Is Going About As Well As You'd Expect |first=Jake |last=Swearingen |publisher=[[New York (magazine)|''New York'']] |accessdate=May 26, 2018 |language=en |date=December 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later, he announced his intention to retire from social media, but reversed the decision within hours.&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.metro.us/news/politics/mike-cernovich-alt-right |title=Who Is Mike Cernovich?  |first=Michael |last=Martin |publisher=''Metro.us'' |accessdate=May 26, 2018 |language=en |date=January 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, he publicized historical tweets in which director [[James Gunn]], a critic of Trump, had joked about rape and pedophilia; Gunn was fired by Disney as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=O'Brien |first1=Luke |title=How Pizzagate Pusher Mike Cernovich Keeps Getting People Fired |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/mike-cernovich-james-gunn-fired_us_5b5265cce4b0fd5c73c570ac |accessdate=July 22, 2018 |work=Huffington Post |date=July 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cernovich has made a number of tweets about rape, including comments that "date rape does not exist" and that "A whore will let her friend ruin your life with a false rape case.

===Relationship with Trump administration===
According to Politico website, during the 2016 campaign and early period of the Trump administration, Cernovich was an "indefatigable Trump cheerleader", hoping that he and kindred activists would have a major influence on the Republican Party. However, by 2018, he had become "increasingly critical" of Trump, and turning away from politics toward his “Gorilla Mindset” lifestyle-coaching practice. In September 2018, he tweeted, “There’s no Wall. She’s not locked up. But Flynn got fired and sent to wolves. And Sauadi [sic] Arabia sold weapons of murder. I give zero f-cks about Republicans losing the House.”&lt;ref name="SCHRECKINGER-2018"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Schreckinger |first1=Ben |title=Trump’s Culture Warriors Go Home |url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/10/29/trump-cernovich-milo-yiannopoulos-richard-spencer-alt-right-2018-221916 |accessdate=1 November 2018 |agency=Politico |date=October 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cernovich complimented democratic socialist (and Trump critic) [[Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez]] on her primary election upset of New York Congressman [[Joe Crowley]]: “She just slaughtered fucking Crowley, just slaughtered the machine, and now she’s like the ‘it’ girl, ... I like to watch peak human achievement.”&lt;ref name="SCHRECKINGER-2018"/&gt;

Cernovich claimed that he had felt a "cosmic" "shift in energy" which only "high-consciousness people" were able to experience. He also elaborated on his past use of mind-altering drugs and referred to reality as a "simulation" several times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ocregister.com/2018/04/23/the-mysticism-of-the-alt-right/ |title=The mysticism of the alt-right |first=James |last=Poulos |publisher=''The Orange County Register'' |accessdate=May 26, 2018 |language=en |date=April 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/mike-cernovich-promises-less-politics-more-philosophy/ |title=Mike Cernovich promises 'less politics, more philosophy' |first=David |last=Gilmour |publisher=''The Daily Dot'' |accessdate=May 26, 2018 |language=en |date=April 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflict with Sam Seder===
{{undue weight section|date=December 2017}}

{{Quote box
| quote = I believe this tweet was posted when Polanski was seeking to return to the US. I wrote that tweet out of disgust with those who were excusing or were seeking to advocate forgiveness for Polanski's actions which caused him to flee the US. I was appalled that anyone would diminish the seriousness of rape, particularly of a child by citing the perpetrator's artistic contributions. Obviously, I would not wish any harm of my daughter or any other person. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am confident that other tweets from that time will reflect my disgust in a less satirical tone.

Despite explaining the tweet to MSNBC Senior VP of Communications [[Errol Cockfield Jr.]] via email, on December 4, 2017, [[TheWrap]] announced that MSNBC had elected to sever ties with Seder by not renewing his contract (due to expire in February 2018) due to the controversial tweet.&lt;ref name="WaPoIThinkTheyreafraid" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNNHowAJoke" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MSNBCdupedbysmearcampaignofSederbyDateRapistMikeCernovich" /&gt; Seder defended the tweet by pointing out that, taken in context of the current events around the time he posted it, it was a satiric response to a petition urging Polanski's release from detention in Switzerland.&lt;ref name="MSNBCdupedbysmearcampaignofSederbyDateRapistMikeCernovich" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTMSNBCRehiresSamSeder" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNNMSNBCRehiresSamSeder"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Kludt |first=Tom |url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/07/media/sam-seder-msnbc-rehired/index.html |title=MSNBC decides to bring back Sam Seder after controversy |date=2017-12-07 |work=CNNMoney |publisher=Time Warner |accessdate=2017-12-10 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; That he was, in fact, mocking Polanski's apologists.&lt;ref name="WaPoIThinkTheyreafraid" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNNHowAJoke" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TheInterceptMSNBCrehiresSeder"&gt;{{cite web |last=Grim |first=Ryan |url=https://theintercept.com/2017/12/07/sam-seder-msnbc-reverses-decision-to-fire-contributor-sam-seder/?comments=1#comments/ |title=MSNBC Reverses Decision to Fire Contributor Sam Seder |date=2017-12-07 |work=[[The Intercept]] |publisher=[[First Look Media]] |accessdate=2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; After news of the termination broke, Cernovich released a [[Twitter]] video celebrating his triumph.&lt;ref name="CNNHowAJoke" /&gt;{{#tag:ref|"Thank you to everybody who emailed MSNBC," Cernovich said in a video he posted on Twitter.

By then, Seder noted that advertisers on ''[[The Majority Report with Sam Seder]]'' podcast were also being contacted and pressured by Cernovich and his team to cut ties with the show over the tweet.&lt;ref name="CNNHowAJoke" /&gt; In response, Seder launched a [[GoFundMe]] campaign to ensure the show is funded if the advertisers decided to bail.&lt;ref name="CNNHowAJoke" /&gt; In an episode of the podcast titled, "I'm Under Attack By the Nazi Alt-Right", Seder said, "this smear involves the willful misinterpretation of a tweet that I posted in 2009" and that he will "never be ashamed of criticizing those who would excuse the predation of women or girls."&lt;ref name="WaPoIThinkTheyreafraid" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MSNBCdupedbysmearcampaignofSederbyDateRapistMikeCernovich" /&gt; Seder also revealed plans to use a portion of the [[GoFundMe]] proceeds to produce a three-minute video educating people on Cernovich's tactics.&lt;ref name="CNNHowAJoke" /&gt; He surmised this was retribution for his frequent criticism of [[President of the United States|US President]] [[Donald Trump]] as well as [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Alabama]] [[United States Senate special election in Alabama, 2017|Senate candidate]] [[Roy Moore]].&lt;ref name="MSNBCdupedbysmearcampaignofSederbyDateRapistMikeCernovich" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTMSNBCRehiresSamSeder" /&gt;{{#tag:ref|Seder explained Cernovich's ploy thusly: "If they succeed in getting me fired or scaring my advertisers away, they will continue until they have silenced anyone who'd criticize Roy Moore, criticize President [Donald] Trump or criticize the conservative movement."&lt;ref name=MSNBCdupedbysmearcampaignofSederbyDateRapistMikeCernovich/&gt;|group=N}} Further, Seder chided MSNBC's decision to terminate his employment concluding, "I think they're afraid of those people."&lt;ref name="WaPoIThinkTheyreafraid" /&gt;{{#tag:ref|"According to Seder, he and MSNBC management never had a serious discussion about the tweet, what it meant and whether it posed a problem for MSNBC social-media standards.

And from what Seder can tell, his position with the network didn't much concern the company's top managers. "I only spoke to the PR guy and they only fired me after there was an imminent story," says Seder. An MSNBC spokesman responds that the company requested Seder's written defense of his tweet, and then considered that defense in reaching its decision on the contract renewal.

== Personal life ==
Cernovich married his first wife as a law student in 2003. Cernovich has said the marriage was "ruined by feminist indoctrination". His wife became an attorney in [[Silicon Valley]] and earned millions of dollars from an initial public offering of stock. She filed for divorce in 2011, and Cernovich received what he has described as a "seven-figure sum" in the settlement. Cernovich met his second wife shortly thereafter, and lives outside of [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].&lt;ref name="Marantz-31-10-16" /&gt;

During an interview with his wife, when referring to his feelings about becoming a father to a baby girl, Cernovich said, "I’ll be nice to her, as long as she’s not a basic bitch."&lt;ref name="Marantz-31-10-16"/&gt;

Cernovich was charged with and arrested for rape in 2003, but he denied the allegations.&lt;ref name="The Daily Beast" /&gt; The charge related to this incident was later reduced to  misdemeanor [[Battery (crime)|battery]] of a woman, for which he performed community service.&lt;ref name="Marantz-31-10-16" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10107">The principle of '''moral supervenience''' states that moral predicates (e.g., permissible, obligatory, forbidden, etc.), and hence moral facts attributing these predicates to various particular actions or action-types, [[supervenience|supervene]], or are defined by and depend, upon non-moral facts. The moral facts are hence said to be ''supervenient facts'', and the non-moral facts the ''supervenience base'' of the former. The principle is sometimes qualified to say that moral facts supervene upon ''natural'' facts, i.e., observable, empirical facts within space-time, but a broader conception could allow the supervenience base to include any non-moral facts, including (if there are any) non-natural facts (e.g., divine commands, Platonic truths).&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

== Clarification and examples ==

Another way to put this is to say that moral facts are a function of, depend upon, or are constrained or constituted by, some non-moral facts, and that the latter are a sufficient condition for making the moral facts true. Yet another common way of putting this is that any change in moral facts must be accompanied by a change in the non-moral facts (i.e., those on which it supervenes), but that the reverse is not the case.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; A moral fact can be constituted by more than one set of non-moral facts-i.e., it is [[multiple realizability|multiply realizable]]-but any given set of non-moral facts determines the moral facts which supervene upon it.

For instance, its being obligatory for Alice to pay Bob $10 supervenes upon non-moral facts, like that Alice borrowed $10 from Bob and promised to repay him. However the same obligation could have arisen if Alice had bought something from Bob priced at $10, or if she promised to give him a gift in that amount, etc. But if any such fact is sufficient to generate this obligation, then it is not possible for her to lack that obligation unless the relevant facts change. Likewise, if another person, say Cindy, stands in the non-moral relationship to David (having borrowed $10 from him, etc.), then she must have the same obligation Alice does.

However the principle is compatible with a very fine-grained analysis of the supervenience base for moral predicates, and hence is compatible with [[moral particularism]]. ([[R.M. Hare]], in the first recorded usage of the term moral particularism, defined these as incompatible, as [[contradictories]] but his definition of particularism is not identical with its contemporary usage.&lt;ref&gt;Hare, 1963, p.19&lt;/ref&gt;) The non-moral facts on which a moral fact supervenes could be quite complex, with many exceptions and qualifications; for instance, one might only be obliged to pay someone $10 if the recipient has not waived the debt, or does not intend to use the funds to cause immediate harm to someone else, etc.

As the principle of moral supervenience by itself places no limit on what the non-moral supervenience base of any moral fact is, nor on how complex the former might be, it is generally considered a very weak principle. It is even compatible with the idea that obligations may vary for persons of different nationalities, races, genders, ages, etc. It only disallows exceptions for certain persons merely on the grounds that they are different people from other persons (note that the fact that.e.g., Alice is Alice, and not Cindy, is not itself a property of Alice, although the facts that she is called "Alice," or has a different residence, birthplace, etc. from Cindy, are among her properties). Hare put this point by saying that the supervenience base of a moral fact could not include "individual constants" (including proper names of persons, countries, etc.)&lt;ref&gt;Hare, 1981, p.41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hare, 1989, p.52&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Moral supervenience is a kind of [[moral universalizability]] principle, like the [[golden rule]] or Immanuel Kant's [[categorical imperative]], so the underlying idea may be as old as the golden rule. Moral supervenience differs from most other universalizability principles in that it adds no specific criterion for the supervenience base of permissible behaviors, so it cannot function as a comprehensive test for moral permissibility, as most other universalizability principles purport to do.&lt;ref&gt;Hare, 1989, pp.30-48&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest precise specification of the principle may be found in Samuel Clarke's "Rule of Equity" according to which "Whatever I judge reasonable or unreasonable that another should do for me: that by the same judgment I declare reasonable or unreasonable that I should in the like case do for him."&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, 1705, p.87&lt;/ref&gt; A few years later William Wollaston echoed this claim with the principle that "Whatever is either reasonable or unreasonable in B with respect to C, would be just the same in C with respect to B, if the case was inverted. Because reason is universal and respects cases, not persons."&lt;ref&gt;Wollaston, 1724, p.129 (§VI.4)&lt;/ref&gt; A few years later Richard Cumberland restated this as a requirement of "right reason," which entailed that “It is included in the notion of a true proposition, (a practical one, for instance,) and is consequently a necessary perfection of a man forming a right judgment in that affair; that it should agree with other true propositions framed about a like subject, tho that case should happen at another time, or belong to another man.... Whoever therefore judges truly, must judge the same things, which he thinks truly are lawful to himself, to be lawful in others in a like case. "&lt;ref&gt;Cumberland, 1727, p.381 (§II.7).&lt;/ref&gt; Later versions are found in Reid,&lt;ref&gt;Reid, 1788, pp.240 (§III.iii), 375 (§V.i)&lt;/ref&gt; Moore,&lt;ref&gt;Moore, 1903, p.98&lt;/ref&gt; Sidgwick,&lt;ref&gt;Sidgwick, 1970, pp.209, 379&lt;/ref&gt; and Sharp.&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, 1928, pp. 110, 115, 140&lt;/ref&gt;

The first usage of the general term "supervenience" and the specific term "moral supervenience" in print was by R.M. Hare,&lt;ref&gt;Hare, 1952, pp.80-81&lt;/ref&gt; although he later suggested that the former term was used by other philosophers conversationally before he put them both into print.&lt;ref&gt;Hare, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; While Hare was primarily interested in the supervenience of moral concepts on non-moral ones, he also argued that other evaluative concepts, e.g., aesthetic ones like beautiful, pleasant, nice, etc., must also supervene upon non-moral facts. For instance, it is senseless to call one room "nice" and another "not nice" unless there is some underlying difference between them describable in non-aesthetic terms (like the arrangement of the furniture, color of the walls, etc.) If the two rooms are identical in all their non-aesthetic properties, then they must also be identical in their aesthetic ones.&lt;ref&gt;Hare, 1963, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hare, 1989, p.70&lt;/ref&gt;

In a series of later books, Hare made moral supervenience, combined with the criterion that a rational being would prefer the satisfaction of his preferences over their frustration, the basis of his idea of [[universal prescriptivism]]. From this he derived a version of [[utilitarianism]], by arguing that to prescribe a particular action in one's circumstances was only rational if you would prescribe anyone's else's doing it, even if you were equally likely to be any agent (including all those affected, for good or ill, by the action). This would only be true if, were you to personally experience all the good and bad effects of the action upon all affected persons (i.e., the satisfaction and frustration of their preferences), you would not prefer some other action to the one in question.&lt;ref&gt;Hare, 1963&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hare, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; He often simply called moral supervenience "universalizability" and equated it with Kant's principle of universal law,&lt;ref&gt;Hare, 1963, p.219&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hare, 1997, pp.151-153&lt;/ref&gt; although the two are not the same (see [[moral universalizability]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2464">'''Nosism''', from the Latin ''nos'', "we", is the practice of using the pronoun "[[we]]" to refer to oneself when expressing a personal opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary, Compact Edition, 1989, Page 1945&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nosism"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wordsmith.org/words/nosism.html |title=A.Word.A.Day – nosism |accessdate=11 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the person using the nosism different uses can be distinguished:

== Royal "we" or ''pluralis majestatis'' ==
{{Main|Royal we}}

The royal "we" (''pluralis majestatis'') refers to a single person holding a high office, such as a [[monarch]], [[bishop]], or [[pope]].

=={{anchor|Editorial we}} Editorial "we"==
The editorial "we" is a similar phenomenon, in which an [[editorial]] [[columnist]] in a newspaper or a similar commentator in another medium refers to themselves as ''we'' when giving their opinion. Here, the writer casts themselves in the role of a [[spokesperson]]: either for the media institution that employs them, or more generally on behalf of the party or body of citizens who agree with the commentary.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

== Author's "we" or ''pluralis modestiae'' {{Anchor|pluralis modestiae}}==
Similar to the editorial "we", ''pluralis modestiae'' is the practice common in mathematical and scientific literature of referring to a generic [[Grammatical person|third person]] by ''we'' (instead of the more common ''one'' or the informal ''you''):
* ''By adding four and five, we obtain nine.''
* ''We are thus led also to a definition of "time" in physics.'' – [[Albert Einstein]]

"We" in this sense often refers to "the reader and the author," since the author often assumes that the reader knows and agrees with certain principles or previous theorems for the sake of brevity (or, if not, the reader is prompted to look them up).

This practice is discouraged in the social sciences because it fails to distinguish between sole authorship and co-authorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association|date=1994|publisher=American Psychological Association|location=Washington, DC|isbn=1557982414|page=30|edition=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11254">'''Parentification''' is the process of role reversal whereby a child is obliged to act as parent to their ''own'' parent. In extreme cases, the child is used to fill the void of the [[Parental Alienation|alienating parent]]'s emotional life.&lt;ref&gt;R. A. Gardner et al., ''The International Handbook of Parental Alienation Syndrome'' (2006) p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

Two distinct modes of parentification have been identified technically: instrumental parentification and emotional parentification. Instrumental parentification involves the child completing physical tasks for the family, such as looking after a sick relative, paying bills, or providing assistance to younger siblings that would normally be provided by a parent. Emotional parentification occurs when a child or adolescent must take on the role of a confidant or mediator for (or between) parents or family members.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory J. Jurkovic, 'Destructive Parentification in Families' in Luciano L'Abate ed., ''Family Psychopathology'' (New York 1998) pp. 237–255&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prehistory==
[[Melitta Schmideberg]] noted in 1948 how emotional deprivation could lead parents to treat their children (unconsciously) as substitute parent figures.&lt;ref&gt;Jurkovic, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt; "Spousification" and "parental child" ([[Minuchin]]) offered alternative concepts exploring the same phenomenon; while the theme of intergenerational continuity in such violations of [[personal boundaries]] was further examined.&lt;ref&gt;Jurkovic, in L'Abate ed., p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Eric Berne]] touched on the dangers of parents and children having a symmetrical, rather than asymmetrical relationship, as when an absent spouse is replaced by the eldest child;&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''Sex in Human Loving'' (Penguin 1970) p. 249–53&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Virginia Satir]] wrote of "the role-function discrepancy...where the son gets into a head-of-the-family role, commonly that of the father".&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Satir, ''Peoplemaking'' (1983) p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Object relations theory]] highlighted how the child's [[True self and false self|false self]] is called into being when it is forced prematurely to take excessive care of the parental object;&lt;ref&gt;Adam Phillips, ''On Kissing, Tickling and Being Bored'' (1994) p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Bowlby]] looked at what he called "compulsive caregiving" among the anxiously [[Attachment theory|attached]], as a result of a parent inverting the normal relationship and pressuring the child to be an attachment figure for them.&lt;ref&gt;John Bowlby, ''The Making and Breaking of Affectional Bonds'' (London 1979) p. 137–38&lt;/ref&gt;

All such aspects of disturbed and inverted parenting patterns have been drawn under the umbrella of the wider phenomenon of parentification – with the result (critics suggest) that on occasion "ironically the concept of parentification has...been as over-burdened as the child it often describes".&lt;ref&gt;Karpel, quoted by Jurkovic, in L'Abate ed., p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;

==Choice of child==
For practical reasons, elder children are generally chosen for the familial "parental" role – very often  the first-born children who were put in the anomalous role.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Satir, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; However, gender considerations mean that sometimes the eldest boy or eldest girl was selected, even if they are not the oldest child overall, for such reasons as the preference to match the sex of the missing parent.

Thus where there is a disabled child in the family to be cared for, "older siblings, especially girls, are at the greatest risk of parentification";&lt;ref&gt;Bryna Siegal, ''What about Me'' (2002) p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; where a father-figure is missing, it may be the eldest son who is forced to take on his father's responsibilities, without ever obtaining the autonomy that normally accompanies such adult roles.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Bloom, ''Tennessee Williams's The Glass Menagerie'' (2007) p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively a widower may put a daughter into the social and emotional role of his deceased wife – "spousification"; or a mother can oblige her daughter to play the caring role, in a betrayal of the child's normal expectation of love and care.&lt;ref&gt;Diana Brandt, ''Wild Mother Dancing'' (1993) p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

==Narcissistic==
[[Narcissistic]] parentification occurs when a child is forced to take on the parent's idealised [[Psychological projection|projection]], something which encourages a compulsive [[perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionism]] in the child at the expense of their natural development.&lt;ref&gt;Jurkovic, in  L'Abate, ed., p. 246-7&lt;/ref&gt; In a kind of pseudo-identification, the child is induced by any and all means to take on the characteristics of the parental [[ego ideal]]&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of the Neuroses'' (London 1946) p. 510-11&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; a pattern that has been detected in [[Western world|western]] culture since [[Homer]]'s description of the character of [[Achilles]].&lt;ref&gt;R. K. Holway, ''Becoming Achilles'' (2011) Chapter Five 'Fathers and Sons'; and notes p. 218–19&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disadvantages and advantages==
The almost inevitable byproduct of parentification is losing one's own childhood.&lt;ref&gt;Siegal, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; In destructive parentification, the child in question takes on excessive responsibility in the family, without their caretaking being acknowledged and supported by others:&lt;ref&gt;Jurkovic, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; by adopting the role of parental care-giver, the child loses their real place in the family unit and is left lonely and unsure.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In extreme instances, there may be what has been called a kind of disembodiment, a [[narcissistic wound]] that threatens one's basic self-identity.&lt;ref&gt;Paula M. Reeves, in Nancy D. Chase, ''Burdened Children'' (1999) p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;

In later life, parentified children often  experience  anxiety  over  abandonment  and  loss,  and demonstrate  difficulty  handling  rejection  and  disappointment  within  interpersonal  relationships. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Katz |first1=Petracca |last2=J. |first2=Rabinowitz |title=A    retrospective study of daughters’ emotional role reversal  with parents, attachment anxiety, excessive reassurance seeking, and depressive symptoms. |journal=The American Journal of Family Therapy |date=2009 |volume=37 |page=185-195 |doi=10.1080/01926180802405596 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, not all results of parentification may be negative. Some studies have hypothesized that when a child is the subject of parentification, it might sometimes result in the child, later in life, having greater [[psychological resilience]], more [[individuation]], a clearer sense of self, and more secure attachment styles during adulthood. These characteristics may be because the person had to adapt to changes and take on responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;Hooper, L. M., Marotta, S. A., &amp; Lanthier, R. P. (2008). Predictors of growth and distress following childhood parentification: A retrospective exploratory study. ''Journal of Child and Family Studies, 17(5)'', 693-705. {{doi|10.1007/s10826-007-9184-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crosscultural studies also point to the widespread nature of the practice of parentification, and indicate that normal as well as pathological aspects of parentification need to be taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy D. Shape, ''Burdened Children'' (1999) p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case studies==
* [[Carl Jung]] in his late autobiography reports that his mother always spoke to him as an adult, confiding in him what she could not share with her husband.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''Memories, Dreams, Reflections'' (London 1983) p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; [[Laurens van der Post]] commented on the grown-up atmosphere surrounding the young Jung, and considered that "this activation of the pattern of the "old man" within himself...was all a consequence of the extent to which his father and mother failed each other".&lt;ref&gt;Laurens van der Post, ''Jung and the Story of Our Times'' (Penguin 1978) p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Patrick Casement]] reports on a patient – Mr T – whose mother was distressed at any and all his feelings, and who therefore protected her from them – mothering ''her'' himself.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (1990) p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary examples==
''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' tells that for "Kaoru's mother...her son's visits were her chief pleasure. Sometimes he almost seemed more like a father than a son – a fact which he was aware of and thought rather sad".&lt;ref&gt;Murasaki Shikiki, ''The Tale of Genji'' (London 1992) p. 790&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Dickens' "Angel in the house" characters, particularly Agnes Wickfield in ''[[David Copperfield]]'', are parentified children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dickensblog.typepad.com/dickensblog/2010/09/unwilling-angels-charles-dickens-agnes-wickfield-and-the-effects-of-parentification.html Nina S. "Unwilling Angels: Charles Dickens, Agnes Wickfield, and the Effects of Parentification". Dickens Blog.]&lt;/ref&gt; Agnes is forced to be the parent of her alcoholic father and seems to strive for perfection as a means of reaching the "ego ideal" of her deceased mother (who died upon child-birth). Agnes marries late, has relationship and intimacy problems (she has a hard time expressing her love for David until he reveals his own love for her), and has some self-defeating attitudes; in one scene she blames her own father's misfortunes on herself. However, she proves to be resilient, resourceful, responsible and even potentially career-driven (she forms her own school). She also manages to marry the protagonist David and the two live happily together for 10 years with children by the end of the novel.

The theme of parentification has also been explored in the [[Twilight (novel series)|''Twilight'' series]],&lt;ref&gt;E. D. Klonsky/A. Blas, ''The Psychology of Twilight'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; with particular (but not exclusive) reference to the character of [[Bella Swan]].&lt;ref&gt;Nancy R. Reagin ed., ''Twilight and History''

In [[electromagnetism]], '''absolute permittivity''', often simply called '''permittivity''' , usually denoted by the Greek letter ε (epsilon), is the measure of [[capacitance]] that is encountered when forming an [[electric field]] in a particular [[Transmission medium|medium]]. More specifically, permittivity describes the amount of charge needed to generate one unit of [[electric flux]] in a particular medium. Accordingly, a charge will yield more electric flux in a medium with low permittivity than in a medium with high permittivity. Permittivity is the measure of a material's ability to store an electric field in the [[polarization density|polarization]] of the medium.

The [[International System of Units|SI]] unit for permittivity is [[farad]] per [[meter]] (F/m or F·m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;).

The lowest possible permittivity is that of a vacuum. [[Vacuum permittivity]], sometimes called the electric constant, is represented by ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and has a value of approximately 8.85×10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; F/m.

The permittivity of a [[dielectric]] medium is often represented by the ratio of its absolute permittivity to the electric constant. This dimensionless quantity is called the medium’s [[relative permittivity]], sometimes also called "permittivity". Relative permittivity is also commonly referred to as the ''dielectric constant'', a term which has been deprecated in physics and engineering&lt;ref name=IEEE1997&gt;{{cite web |author=[[IEEE]] Standards Board|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=5697|title=IEEE Standard Definitions of Terms for Radio Wave Propagation|year=1997 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in chemistry.&lt;ref name="IUPAC"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Braslavsky |first=S.E.|url=http://iupac.org/publications/pac/2007/pdf/7903x0293.pdf |title=Glossary of terms used in photochemistry (IUPAC recommendations 2006)|journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry|volume=79 |issue=3|year=2007 |pages=293–465|doi=10.1351/pac200779030293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\kappa = \varepsilon_r = \frac{\varepsilon}{\varepsilon_0}&lt;/math&gt;

By definition, a perfect vacuum has a relative permittivity of exactly 1. The difference in permittivity between a vacuum and air can often be considered negligible, as κ&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.0006.

Relative permittivity is directly related to [[electric susceptibility]] (χ), which is a measure of how easily a dielectric [[polarization density|polarizes]] in response to an [[electric field]], given by

:&lt;math&gt;\chi = \kappa - 1&lt;/math&gt;

otherwise written as

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon = \varepsilon_\mathrm{r} \varepsilon_0 = (1+\chi)\varepsilon_0 &lt;/math&gt;

==Units==

The standard SI unit for permittivity is Farad per meter (F/m or F·m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{SIbrochure8th}}, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\text{F}}{\text{m}} = \frac{\text{C}}{\text{V} \cdot \text{m}} = \frac{\text{C}^2}{\text{N} \cdot \text{m}^2} = \frac{\text{A}^2 \cdot \text{s}^4}{\text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^3}=\frac{\text{N}}{\text{V}^2}&lt;/math&gt;

==Explanation==

In [[electromagnetism]], the [[electric displacement field]] {{math|'''D'''}} represents how an electric field {{math|'''E'''}} influences the organization of electric charges in a given medium, including charge migration and electric [[dipole]] reorientation. Its relation to permittivity in the very simple case of ''linear, homogeneous, [[isotropic]]'' materials with ''"instantaneous" response'' to changes in electric field is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{D}=\varepsilon \mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt;

where the permittivity {{mvar|ε}} is a [[scalar (physics)|scalar]]. If the medium is [[anisotropic]], the permittivity is a second rank [[tensor]].

In general, permittivity is not a constant, as it can vary with the position in the medium, the frequency of the field applied, humidity, temperature, and other parameters. In a [[nonlinear optics|nonlinear medium]], the permittivity can depend on the strength of the electric field. Permittivity as a function of frequency can take on real or complex values.

In SI units, permittivity is measured in [[farads]] per meter (F/m or A&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;·kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;). The displacement field {{math|'''D'''}} is measured in units of [[coulomb]]s per [[square meter]] (C/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), while the electric field {{math|'''E'''}} is measured in [[volt]]s per meter (V/m). {{math|'''D'''}} and {{math|'''E'''}} describe the interaction between charged objects. {{math|'''D'''}} is related to the ''charge densities'' associated with this interaction, while {{math|'''E'''}} is related to the ''forces'' and ''potential differences''.

==Vacuum permittivity==

{{main|Vacuum permittivity}}

The vacuum permittivity {{math|''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} (also called '''permittivity of free space''' or the '''electric constant''') is the ratio {{math|{{sfrac|'''D'''|'''E'''}}}} in [[Vacuum|free space]]. It also appears in the [[Coulomb force constant]],

:&lt;math&gt;k_e=\frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0}&lt;/math&gt;

Its value is{{physconst|eps0|ref=only}}

:&lt;math&gt; \varepsilon_0  \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ \frac{1}{c_0^2\mu_0} = \frac{1}{35\,950\,207\,149.472\,7056\pi}\text{ F/m} \approx 8.854\,187\,8176\ldots\times 10^{-12}\text{ F/m } &lt;/math&gt;

where
* {{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[speed of light]] in free space,{{efn|Current practice of standards organizations such as [[NIST]] and [[BIPM]] is to use {{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}, rather than {{mvar|c}}, to denote the speed of light in a vacuum according to [[ISO 31]]. In the original Recommendation of 1983, the symbol {{mvar|c}} was used for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;[http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP330/sp330.pdf NIST ''Special Publication 330'', Appendix 2, p. 45 ].&lt;/ref&gt;}}
* {{math|''µ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[vacuum permeability]].
The constants {{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''μ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} are defined in SI units to have exact numerical values, shifting responsibility of experiment to the determination of the meter and the [[ampere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Constants/index.html |title=Latest (2006) values of the constants (NIST) |publisher=Physics.nist.gov |date=2017-07-01 |accessdate=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The approximation in the second value of {{math|''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} above stems from {{math|π}} being an [[irrational number]].)

==Relative permittivity==
{{main|Relative permittivity}}

The linear permittivity of a homogeneous material is usually given relative to that of free space, as a relative permittivity {{math|''ε''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;}} (also called [[dielectric constant]], although this term is deprecated and sometimes only refers to the static, zero-frequency relative permittivity). In an anisotropic material, the relative permittivity may be a tensor, causing [[birefringence]]. The actual permittivity is then calculated by multiplying the relative permittivity by {{math|''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon = \varepsilon_\mathrm{r} \varepsilon_0 = (1+\chi)\varepsilon_0,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|χ}} (frequently written {{math|''χ''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;}}) is the electric susceptibility of the material.

The susceptibility is defined as the constant of proportionality (which may be a [[tensor]]) relating an [[electric field]] {{math|'''E'''}} to the induced [[dielectric]] [[polarization (electrostatics)|polarization density]] {{math|'''P'''}} such that

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P} = \varepsilon_0\chi\mathbf{E},&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[Vacuum permittivity|electric permittivity of free space]].

The susceptibility of a medium is related to its relative permittivity {{math|''ε''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;}} by

:&lt;math&gt;\chi = \varepsilon_\mathrm{r} - 1.&lt;/math&gt;

So in the case of a vacuum,

:&lt;math&gt;\chi =  0. &lt;/math&gt;

The susceptibility is also related to the [[polarizability]] of individual particles in the medium by the [[Clausius-Mossotti relation]].

The [[electric displacement]] {{math|'''D'''}} is related to the polarization density {{math|'''P'''}} by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{D} = \varepsilon_0\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{P} = \varepsilon_0 (1+\chi) \mathbf{E} = \varepsilon_\mathrm{r} \varepsilon_0 \mathbf{E}.&lt;/math&gt;

The permittivity {{mvar|ε}} and [[permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] {{mvar|µ}} of a medium together determine the [[phase velocity]] {{math|''v'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''c''|''n''}}}} of [[electromagnetic radiation]] through that medium:

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon \mu = \frac{1}{v^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Practical applications ==

=== Determining capacitance ===
The capacitance of a capacitor is based on its design and architecture, meaning it will not change with charging and discharging. The formula for capacitance is written as

:&lt;math&gt;C = \varepsilon \ \frac{A}{d}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the area of one plate, &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between the plates, and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is the permittivity of the medium between the two plates. For a capacitor with relative permittivity &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;, it can be said that

:&lt;math&gt;C = \kappa \ \varepsilon_0 \frac{A}{d}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Gauss's law ===
Permittivity is connected to electric flux (and by extension electric field) through [[Gauss's law]]. Gauss's law states that for a closed [[Gaussian surface]], s

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_E = \frac{Q_\text{enc}}{\varepsilon_0} = \oint_s \mathbf{E} \cdot \mathrm{d} \mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Phi_E&lt;/math&gt; is the net electric flux passing through the surface, &lt;math&gt;Q_\text{enc}&lt;/math&gt; is the charge enclosed in the Gaussian surface, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt; is the electric field vector at a given point on the surface, and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d} \mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; is a differential area vector on the Gaussian surface.

If the Gaussian surface uniformly encloses an insulated, symmetrical charge arrangement, the formula can be simplified to

:&lt;math&gt;EA \cos(\theta) = \frac{Q_\text{enc}}{\varepsilon_0}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; represents the angle between the electric field vector and the area vector.

If all of the electric field lines cross the surface at 90°, the formula can be further simplified to

:&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{Q_\text{enc}}{\varepsilon_0 A}&lt;/math&gt;

Because the surface area of a sphere is &lt;math&gt;4 \pi r^2&lt;/math&gt;, the electric field a distance &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; away from a uniform, spherical charge arrangement is

:&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{Q}{\varepsilon_0 A} = \frac{Q}{\varepsilon_0 \left(4 \pi r^2\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{Q}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0 r^2} = \frac{kQ}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is [[Coulomb's constant]] (&lt;math&gt;\sim 9.0 \times 10^9 \ \text{m}/\text{F}&lt;/math&gt;). This formula applies to the electric field due to a point charge, outside of a conducting sphere or shell, outside of a uniformly charged insulating sphere, or between the plates of a spherical capacitor.

== Dispersion and causality ==

In general, a material cannot polarize instantaneously in response to an applied field, and so the more general formulation as a function of time is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}(t) = \varepsilon_0 \int_{-\infty}^t \chi\left(t - t'\right) \mathbf{E}\left(t'\right) \, dt'.&lt;/math&gt;

That is, the polarization is a [[convolution]] of the electric field at previous times with time-dependent susceptibility given by {{math|''χ''(Δ''t'')}}. The upper limit of this integral can be extended to infinity as well if one defines {{math|''χ''(Δ''t'') {{=}} 0}} for {{math|Δ''t'' &lt; 0}}. An instantaneous response would correspond to a [[Dirac delta function]] susceptibility {{math|''χ''(Δ''t'') {{=}} ''χδ''(Δ''t'')}}.

It is convenient to take the [[continuous Fourier transform|Fourier transform]] with respect to time and write this relationship as a function of frequency. Because of the [[convolution theorem]], the integral becomes a simple product,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}(\omega) = \varepsilon_0 \chi(\omega) \mathbf{E}(\omega).&lt;/math&gt;

This frequency dependence of the susceptibility leads to frequency dependence of the permittivity. The shape of the susceptibility with respect to frequency characterizes the [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] properties of the material.

Moreover, the fact that the polarization can only depend on the electric field at previous times (i.e. effectively {{math|''χ''(Δ''t'') {{=}} 0}} for {{math|Δ''t'' &lt; 0}}), a consequence of [[causality]], imposes [[Kramers–Kronig relation|Kramers–Kronig constraints]] on the susceptibility {{math|''χ''(0)}}.

===Complex permittivity===

[[Image:Dielectric responses.svg|thumb|right|454px|A dielectric permittivity spectrum over a wide range of frequencies. {{math|''ε''′}} and {{math|''ε''″}} denote the real and the imaginary part of the permittivity, respectively. Various processes are labeled on the image: ionic and dipolar relaxation, and atomic and electronic resonances at higher energies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060118002845/http://www.psrc.usm.edu/mauritz/dilect.html |title="Dielectric Spectroscopy" |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

As opposed to the response of a vacuum, the response of normal materials to external fields generally depends on the [[frequency]] of the field. This frequency dependence reflects the fact that a material's polarization does not change instantaneously when an electric field is applied. The response must always be ''causal'' (arising after the applied field), which can be represented by a phase difference. For this reason, permittivity is often treated as a complex function of the [[Angular frequency|(angular) frequency]] {{mvar|ω}} of the applied field:

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon \rightarrow \hat{\varepsilon}(\omega)&lt;/math&gt;

(since complex numbers allow specification of magnitude and phase). The definition of permittivity therefore becomes

:&lt;math&gt;D_0 e^{-i \omega t} = \hat{\varepsilon}(\omega) E_0 e^{-i \omega t},&lt;/math&gt;

where
* {{math|''D''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the amplitudes of the displacement and electric fields, respectively,
* {{mvar|i}} is the [[imaginary unit]], {{math|''i''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} −1}}.

The response of a medium to static electric fields is described by the low-frequency limit of permittivity, also called the static permittivity {{math|''ε''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;}} (also {{math|''ε''&lt;sub&gt;DC&lt;/sub&gt;}}):

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_\mathrm{s} = \lim_{\omega \rightarrow 0} \hat{\varepsilon}(\omega).&lt;/math&gt;

At the high-frequency limit, the complex permittivity is commonly referred to as {{math|''ε''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;}}. At the [[plasma frequency]] and below, dielectrics behave as ideal metals, with electron gas behavior. The static permittivity is a good approximation for alternating fields of low frequencies, and as the frequency increases a measurable phase difference {{mvar|δ}} emerges between {{math|'''D'''}} and {{math|'''E'''}}. The frequency at which the phase shift becomes noticeable depends on temperature and the details of the medium. For moderate field strength ({{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}), {{math|'''D'''}} and {{math|'''E'''}} remain proportional, and

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\varepsilon} = \frac{D_0}{E_0} = |\varepsilon|e^{i\delta}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since the response of materials to alternating fields is characterized by a complex permittivity, it is natural to separate its real and imaginary parts, which is done by convention in the following way:

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\varepsilon}(\omega) = \varepsilon'(\omega) + i\varepsilon''(\omega) = \left| \frac{D_0}{E_0} \right| \left( \cos \delta  + i\sin \delta  \right). &lt;/math&gt;

where
* {{math|''ε''′}} is the real part of the permittivity;
* {{math|''ε''″}} is the imaginary part of the permittivity;
* {{mvar|δ}} is the [[loss angle]].

The choice of sign for time-dependence, {{math|''e''&lt;sup&gt;−''iωt''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, dictates the sign convention for the imaginary part of permittivity. The signs used here correspond to those commonly used in physics, whereas for the engineering convention one should reverse all imaginary quantities.

The complex permittivity is usually a complicated function of frequency {{mvar|ω}}, since it is a superimposed description of [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] phenomena occurring at multiple frequencies. The dielectric function {{math|''ε''(''ω'')}} must have poles only for frequencies with positive imaginary parts, and therefore satisfies the [[Kramers–Kronig relation]]s. However, in the narrow frequency ranges that are often studied in practice, the permittivity can be approximated as frequency-independent or by model functions.

At a given frequency, the imaginary part, {{math|''ε''″}}, leads to absorption loss if it is positive (in the above sign convention) and gain if it is negative. More generally, the imaginary parts of the [[eigenvalue]]s of the anisotropic dielectric tensor should be considered.

In the case of solids, the complex dielectric function is intimately connected to band structure. The primary quantity that characterizes the electronic structure of any crystalline material is the probability of [[photon]] absorption, which is directly related to the imaginary part of the optical dielectric function {{math|''ε''(''ω'')}}. The optical dielectric function is given by the fundamental expression:&lt;ref name=Cardona&gt;

===Tensorial permittivity===

According to the [[Drude model]] of magnetized plasma, a more general expression which takes into account the interaction of the carriers with an alternating electric field at millimeter and microwave frequencies in an axially magnetized semiconductor requires the expression of the permittivity as a non-diagonal tensor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/vsp/jew/2003/00000017/00000008/art00011] Prati E.  (2003) "Propagation in gyroelectromagnetic guiding systems", ''J. of Electr. Wav. and Appl.'' '''17, 8''', 1177&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[Electro-gyration]]).

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{D}(\omega) = \begin{vmatrix}
    \varepsilon_1 &amp; -i \varepsilon_2 &amp; 0 \\
  i \varepsilon_2 &amp;    \varepsilon_1 &amp; 0 \\
    0             &amp;    0             &amp; \varepsilon_z \\
\end{vmatrix} \operatorname{\mathbf{E}}(\omega)&lt;/math&gt;

If {{math|''ε''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} vanishes, then the tensor is diagonal but not proportional to the identity and the medium is said to be a uniaxial medium, which has similar properties to a [[uniaxial crystal]].

===Classification of materials===
{{Classification of materials based on permittivity}}
Materials can be classified according to their complex-valued permittivity {{mvar|ε}}, upon comparison of its real {{math|''ε''′}} and imaginary {{math|''ε''″}} components (or, equivalently, [[Electric conductivity|conductivity]], {{mvar|σ}}, when accounted for in the latter). A ''[[perfect conductor]]'' has infinite conductivity, {{math|''σ'' {{=}} ∞}}, while a ''[[perfect dielectric]]'' is a material that has no conductivity at all, {{math|''σ'' {{=}} 0}}; this latter case, of real-valued permittivity (or complex-valued permittivity with zero imaginary component) is also associated with the name ''lossless media''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ece.rutgers.edu/~orfanidi/ewa/ch01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, when {{math|{{sfrac|''σ''|''ωε''′}} ≪ 1}} we consider the material to be a ''low-loss dielectric'' (although not exactly lossless), whereas {{math|{{sfrac|''σ''|''ωε''′}} ≫ 1}} is associated with a ''good conductor''; such materials with non-negligible conductivity yield a large amount of [[dielectric loss|loss]] that inhibit the propagation of electromagnetic waves, thus are also said to be ''lossy media''. Those materials that do not fall under either limit are considered to be general media.

===Lossy medium===
In the case of a lossy medium, i.e. when the conduction current is not negligible, the total current density flowing is:

:&lt;math&gt;J_\text{tot} = J_\mathrm{c} + J_\mathrm{d} = \sigma E - i \omega \varepsilon' E = -i \omega \hat{\varepsilon} E&lt;/math&gt;

where
* {{mvar|σ}} is the [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]] of the medium;
* {{math|''ε''′}} is the real part of the permittivity.
* {{mvar|ε̂}} is the complex permittivity

The size of the [[displacement current]] is dependent on the [[frequency]] ω of the applied field ''E''; there is no displacement current in a constant field.

In this formalism, the complex permittivity is defined as:&lt;ref&gt;John S. Seybold (2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=4LtmjGNwOPIC&amp;dq= ''Introduction to RF Propagation''], John Wiley &amp; Sons, p. 22, eq. (2.6).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth L. Kaiser, [https://books.google.com/books?id=bDuOAQDk38gC&amp;dq= ''Electromagnetic Shielding''], CRC Press, 2005, p. 1·28, eqs. (1.80) and (1.81).&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\varepsilon} = \varepsilon' \left(1 - i \frac{\sigma}{\omega \varepsilon'}\right) = \varepsilon' - i \frac{\sigma}{\omega}&lt;/math&gt;

In general, the absorption of electromagnetic energy by dielectrics is covered by a few different mechanisms that influence the shape of the permittivity as a function of frequency:
* First are the [[Dielectric relaxation|relaxation]] effects associated with permanent and induced [[Dipole|molecular dipoles]]. At low frequencies the field changes slowly enough to allow dipoles to reach [[wikt:equilibrium|equilibrium]] before the field has measurably changed. For frequencies at which dipole orientations cannot follow the applied field because of the [[viscosity]] of the medium, absorption of the field's energy leads to energy dissipation. The mechanism of dipoles relaxing is called [[dielectric relaxation]] and for ideal dipoles is described by classic [[Debye relaxation]].
* Second are the  [[resonance|resonance effects]], which arise from the rotations or vibrations of atoms, [[ion]]s, or [[electron]]s. These processes are observed in the neighborhood of their characteristic [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption frequencies]].

The above effects often combine to cause non-linear effects within capacitors. For example, dielectric absorption refers to the inability of a capacitor that has been charged for a long time to completely discharge when briefly discharged. Although an ideal capacitor would remain at zero volts after being discharged, real capacitors will develop a small voltage, a phenomenon that is also called ''soakage'' or ''battery action''. For some dielectrics, such as many polymer films, the resulting voltage may be less than 1–2% of the original voltage. However, it can be as much as 15–25% in the case of [[electrolytic capacitor]]s or [[supercapacitor]]s.

===Quantum-mechanical interpretation===

In terms of [[quantum mechanics]], permittivity is explained by [[atom]]ic and [[molecule|molecular]] interactions.

At low frequencies, molecules in polar dielectrics are polarized by an applied electric field, which induces periodic rotations. For example, at the [[microwave]] frequency, the microwave field causes the periodic rotation of water molecules, sufficient to break [[hydrogen bond]]s. The field does work against the bonds and the energy is absorbed by the material as [[heat]]. This is why microwave ovens work very well for materials containing water. There are two maxima of the imaginary component (the absorptive index) of water, one at the microwave frequency, and the other at far ultraviolet (UV) frequency. Both of these resonances are at higher frequencies than the operating frequency of microwave ovens.

At moderate frequencies, the energy is too high to cause rotation, yet too low to affect electrons directly, and is absorbed in the form of resonant molecular vibrations. In water, this is where the absorptive index starts to drop sharply, and the minimum of the imaginary permittivity is at the frequency of blue light (optical regime).

At high frequencies (such as UV and above), molecules cannot relax, and the energy is purely absorbed by atoms, exciting [[electron]] energy levels. Thus, these frequencies are classified as [[ionizing radiation]].

While carrying out a complete ''[[ab initio]]'' (that is, first-principles) modelling is now computationally possible, it has not been widely applied yet. Thus, a phenomenological model is accepted as being an adequate method of capturing experimental behaviors. The [[Debye relaxation|Debye model]] and the [[Lorentz model]] use a first-order and second-order (respectively) lumped system parameter linear representation (such as an RC and an LRC resonant circuit).

==Measurement==
{{main|dielectric spectroscopy}}

The relative permittivity of a material can be found by a variety of static electrical measurements. The complex permittivity is evaluated over a wide range of frequencies by using different variants of [[dielectric spectroscopy]], covering nearly 21 orders of magnitude from 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; [[hertz]]. Also, by using [[cryostat]]s and ovens, the dielectric properties of a medium can be characterized over an array of temperatures. In order to study systems for such diverse excitation fields, a number of measurement setups are used, each adequate for a special frequency range.

Various microwave measurement techniques are outlined in Chen ''et al.''.&lt;ref name=Chen&gt;{{cite book |title=Microwave electronics |author1=Linfeng Chen |author2=V. V. Varadan |author3=C. K.

* Low-frequency [[time domain]] measurements (10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Hz)
* Low-frequency [[frequency domain]] measurements (10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Hz)
* Reflective coaxial methods (10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Hz)
* Transmission coaxial method (10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Hz)
* [[Quasi-optical]] methods (10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Hz)
* [[Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy]] (10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Hz)
* Fourier-transform methods (10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Hz)

At infrared and optical frequencies, a common technique is [[ellipsometry]]. [[Dual polarisation interferometry]] is also used to measure the complex refractive index for very thin films at optical frequencies.

The '''philosophy of perception''' is concerned with the nature of [[Perception|perceptual experience]] and the status of [[sense data|perceptual data]], in particular how they relate to beliefs about, or knowledge of, the world.&lt;ref name="Bonjour"&gt;cf. http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/perception-episprob/ BonJour, Laurence (2007): "Epistemological Problems of Perception."

Philosophers distinguish [[Internalism|internalist]] accounts, which assume that perceptions of objects, and [[knowledge]] or [[belief]]s about them, are aspects of an individual's mind, and [[Externalism|externalist]] accounts, which state that they constitute real aspects of the world external to the individual.&lt;ref name="Bonjour" /&gt; The position of [[naïve realism]]—the 'everyday' impression of physical objects constituting what is perceived—is to some extent contradicted by the occurrence of perceptual illusions and hallucinations&lt;ref&gt;cf. http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/perception-problem/ Crane, Tim (2005): "The Problem of Perception."

==Categories of perception==
We may categorize perception as ''internal'' or ''external''.
* Internal perception ([[proprioception]]) tells us what is going on in our bodies; where our limbs are, whether we are sitting or standing, whether we are depressed, hungry, tired and so forth.
* External or sensory perception ([[exteroception]]), tells us about the world outside our bodies. Using our senses of sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste, we perceive colors, sounds, textures, etc. of the world at large. There is a growing body of knowledge of the mechanics of sensory processes in [[cognitive psychology]].
* Mixed internal and external perception (e.g., emotion and certain moods) tells us about what is going on in our bodies and about the perceived cause of our bodily perceptions.

The philosophy of perception is mainly concerned with exteroception.

==Scientific accounts of perception==

An object at some distance from an observer will reflect light in all directions, some of which will fall upon the corneae of the [[Human eye|eyes]], where it will be focussed upon each [[retina]], forming an image. The disparity between the electrical output of these two slightly different images is resolved either at the level of the [[lateral geniculate]] nucleus or in a part of the [[visual cortex]] called 'V1'. The resolved data is further processed in the visual cortex where some areas have specialised functions, for instance area V5 is involved in the modelling of motion and V4 in adding colour. The resulting single image that subjects report as their experience is called a 'percept'. Studies involving rapidly changing scenes show the percept derives from numerous processes that involve time delays.&lt;ref&gt;see Moutoussis and Zeki (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Recent [[fMRI]] studies &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/news/brain-decoding-reading-minds-1.13989|title=Brain decoding: Reading minds}}&lt;/ref&gt; show that dreams, imaginings and perceptions of things such as faces are accompanied by activity in many of the same areas of brain as are involved with physical sight. Imagery that originates from the senses and internally generated imagery may have a shared [[ontology]] at higher levels of cortical processing.

[[Sound]] is analyzed in term of pressure waves sensed by the [[cochlea]] in the ear. Data from the eyes and ears is combined to form a 'bound' percept. The problem of how this is produced, known as the [[binding problem]].

Perception is analyzed as a [[cognitive process]] in which [[information processing]] is used to transfer information into the mind where it is related to other information. Some psychologists propose that this processing gives rise to particular mental states ([[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]]) whilst others envisage a direct path back into the external world in the form of action (radical [[behaviourism]]). Behaviourists such as [[John B. Watson]] and [[B.F. Skinner]] have proposed that perception acts largely as a process between a stimulus and a response but have noted that [[Gilbert Ryle]]'s "[[ghost in the machine]] of the brain" still seems to exist. "The objection to inner states is not that they do not exist, but that they are not relevant in a functional analysis".&lt;ref&gt;Skinner 1953&lt;/ref&gt; This view, in which experience is thought to be an incidental by-product of information processing, is known as [[epiphenomenalism]].

Contrary to the behaviouralist approach to understanding the elements of cognitive processes, [[gestalt psychology]] sought to understand their organization as a whole, studying perception as a process of [[figure-ground (perception)|figure and ground]].

==Philosophical accounts of perception==
Important philosophical problems derive from the [[epistemology]] of perception—how we can gain knowledge via perception—such as the question of the nature of [[qualia]].&lt;ref&gt;Chalmers DJ. (1995) "Facing up to the hard problem of consciousness." ''Journal of Consciousness Studies'' 2, 3, 200–219&lt;/ref&gt; Within the biological study of perception naive realism is unusable.&lt;ref&gt;Smythies J. (2003) "Space, time and consciousness." ''Journal of Consciousness Studies'' 10, 3, 47–64.&lt;/ref&gt; However, outside biology modified forms of naive realism are defended. [[Thomas Reid]], the eighteenth-century founder of the [[Scottish School of Common Sense]], formulated the idea that sensation was composed of a set of data transfers but also declared that there is still a direct connection between perception and the world. This idea, called direct realism, has again become popular in recent years with the rise of [[postmodernism]].

The succession of data transfers involved in perception suggests that [[sense data]] are somehow available to a perceiving subject that is the substrate of the percept. Indirect realism, the view held by [[John Locke]] and [[Nicolas Malebranche]], proposes that we can only be aware of [[mental representation]]s of objects. however this may imply an infinite regress (a perceiver within a perceiver within a perceiver...), though a finite regress is perfectly possible.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards JC. (2008) "Are our spaces made of words?" ''Journal of Consciousness Studies'' 15, 1, 63–83.&lt;/ref&gt; It also assumes that perception is entirely due to data transfer and information processing, an argument that can be avoided by proposing that the percept does not depend wholly upon the transfer and rearrangement of data. This still involves basic ontological issues of the sort raised by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]&lt;ref&gt;Woolhouse RS and Franks R. (1998) ''GW Leibniz, Philosophical Texts'', Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Locke, [[David Hume|Hume]], [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]] and others, which remain outstanding particularly in relation to the [[binding problem]], the question of how different perceptions (e.g. color and contour in vision) are "bound" to the same object when they are processed by separate areas of the brain.

Indirect realism (representational views) provides an account of issues such as perceptual contents,&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, S. (2011)."The Contents of Perception", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Winter 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/perception-contents/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, S.: The Contents of Visual Experience. New York: Oxford University Press. 2010&lt;/ref&gt; [[qualia]], dreams, imaginings, [[hallucinations]], illusions, the resolution of [[binocular rivalry]], the resolution of [[multistable perception]], the modelling of motion that allows us to watch TV, the sensations that result from direct brain stimulation, the update of the mental image by saccades of the eyes and the referral of events backwards in time. Direct realists must either argue that these experiences do not occur or else refuse to define them as perceptions.

Idealism holds that reality is limited to mental qualities while skepticism challenges our ability to know anything outside our minds. One of the most influential proponents of idealism was [[George Berkeley]] who maintained that everything was mind or dependent upon mind. Berkeley's idealism has two main strands, [[phenomenalism]] in which physical events are viewed as a special kind of mental event and [[subjective idealism]]. [[David Hume]] is probably the most influential proponent of skepticism.

A fourth theory of perception in opposition to naive realism, [[enactivism]], attempts to find a middle path between direct realist and indirect realist theories, positing that [[cognition]] arises as a result of the dynamic interplay between an organism's sensory-motor capabilities and its environment. Instead of seeing perception as a passive process determined entirely by the features of an independently existing world, enactivism suggests that organism and environment are structurally coupled and co-determining. The theory was first formalized by Francisco Varela, Evan Thompson, and Eleanor Rosch in "The Embodied Mind".&lt;ref&gt;Varela F, Thompson E, Rosch E (1991) "The Embodied Mind: Cognitive Science and Human Experience" MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spatial representation==
An aspect of perception that is common to both realists and anti-realists is the idea of mental or [[Visual space|perceptual space]]. [[David Hume]] concluded that things appear extended because they have attributes of colour and solidity. A popular modern philosophical view is that the brain cannot contain images so our sense of space must be due to the actual space occupied by physical things. However, as René Descartes noticed, perceptual space has a projective geometry, things within it appear as if they are viewed from a point. The phenomenon of [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]] was closely studied by artists and architects in the Renaissance, who relied mainly on the 11th century polymath, [[Alhazen]] (Ibn al-Haytham), who affirmed the visibility of perceptual space in geometric structuring projections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=La perception de la profondeur: Alhazen, Berkeley et [[Merleau-Ponty]]|author=[[Nader El-Bizri]]|journal=Oriens-Occidens, CNRS|volume=5|year=2004|publisher=[[Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique]]|pages=171–184}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=In Defence of the Sovereignty of Philosophy: al-Baghdadi's Critique of Ibn al-Haytham's Geometrisation of Place|author=Nader El-Bizri|journal=[[Arabic Sciences and Philosophy]]|volume=17|year=2007|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|pages=57–80|doi=10.1017/s0957423907000367}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematicians now know of many types of projective geometry such as complex [[Minkowski space]] that might describe the layout of things in perception (see Peters (2000)) and it has also emerged that parts of the brain contain patterns of electrical activity that correspond closely to the layout of the retinal image (this is known as [[retinotopy]]). How or whether these become conscious experience is still unknown (see McGinn (1995)).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1258">In [[ethics]], the '''plank of Carneades''' is a [[thought experiment]] first proposed by [[Carneades]] of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]]; it explores the concept of [[self-defense]] in relation to [[murder]].

In the thought experiment, there are two shipwrecked sailors, A and B.  They both see a plank that can only support one of them and both of them swim towards it.  Sailor A gets to the plank first.  Sailor B, who is going to drown, pushes A off and away from the plank and, thus, proximately, causes A to drown.  Sailor B gets on the plank and is later saved by a rescue team. The thought experiment poses the question of whether Sailor B can be tried for murder because if B had to kill A in order to live, then it would arguably be in self-defense.

[[The Case of the Speluncean Explorers]] by legal philosopher [[Lon Fuller]] is a similar exploration of morality and legality ''in extremis''.

The '''right to sexuality''' incorporates the right to express one's sexuality and to be free from discrimination on the grounds of [[sexual orientation]]. In specific, it relates to the [[human rights]] of people of diverse sexual orientation, including [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]] and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) people, and the protection of those rights, although it is equally applicable to [[heterosexuality]]. The right to sexuality and freedom from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation is based on the universality of human rights and the inalienable nature of rights belonging to every person by virtue of being human.

No right to sexuality exists explicitly in [[international human rights law]]; rather, it is found in a number of [[international human rights instruments]] including the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]].

==Definition==
The concept of the right to sexuality is difficult to define, as it comprises various rights from within the framework of international human rights law.

Sexual orientation is defined in the Preamble to the [[Yogyakarta Principles]] as "each person’s capacity for profound emotional, affectional and sexual attraction to, and intimate and sexual relations with, individuals of a different gender or the same gender or more than one gender".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/principles_en.htm The Yogyakarta Principles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509135718/http://www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/principles_en.htm |date=2008-05-09 }}, Preamble.&lt;/ref&gt;

Freedom from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation is found in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) and the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR).

The UDHR provides for non-discrimination in Article 2, which states that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. Furthermore, no distinction shall be made on the basis of the political, jurisdictional or international status of the country or territory to which a person belongs, whether it be independent, trust, non-self-governing or under any other limitation of sovereignty."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/ Universal Declaration of Human Rights], Article 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sexual orientation can be read into Article 2 as "other status" or alternatively as falling under "sex".

In the ICCPR, Article 2 sets out a similar provision for non-discrimination:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Each State Party to the present Covenant undertakes to respect and to ensure to all individuals within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction the rights recognized in the present Covenant, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[Toonen v Australia]] the [[United Nations Human Rights Committee]] (UNHRC) found that the reference to "sex" in Article 2 of the ICCPR included sexual orientation, thereby making sexual orientation prohibited grounds of distinction in respect of the enjoyment of rights under the ICCPR.&lt;ref&gt;(488/1992), CCPR/C/50/D/488/1992 (1994); 1-3 IHRR 97 (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to be free from discrimination is the basis of the right to sexuality, but it is closely related to the exercise and protection of other fundamental human rights.

==Background==
Individuals of diverse sexual orientation have been discriminated against historically and continue to be a "vulnerable" group in society today. Forms of discrimination experienced by people of diverse sexual orientation include the denial of the [[right to life]], the [[right to work]] and the [[right to privacy]], non-recognition of personal and family relationships, interference with human [[dignity]], interference with [[security of the person]], violations of the right to be free from [[torture]], discrimination in access to economic, social and cultural rights, including housing, health and education, and pressure to remain silent and invisible.&lt;ref&gt;M O'Flaherty and J Fisher ''Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and International Human Rights Law: Contextualising the Yogyakarta Principles'' (2008) 8 HRLR 207 at 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seventy-eight countries maintain laws that make same-sex consensual sex between adults a criminal offence, and seven countries (or parts thereof) impose the death penalty for same-sex consensual sex. They are Iran, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Mauritania, Sudan, the twelve northern states of Nigeria, and the southern parts of Somalia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://old.ilga.org/Statehomophobia/ILGA_State_Sponsored_Homophobia_2012.pdf ''State Sponsored Homophobia: A world survey of laws criminalising same-sex sexual acts between consenting adults'', The International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, edited by Lucas Paoli Itaborahy, May 2012, pages 4 and 13] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611181908/http://old.ilga.org/Statehomophobia/ILGA_State_Sponsored_Homophobia_2012.pdf |date=June 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to sexuality has only relatively recently become the subject of international concern, with the regulation of sexuality traditionally falling within the jurisdiction of the [[nation state]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ichrp.org/files/reports/47/137_web.pdf International Council on Human Rights] ''Sexuality and Human Rights'' (2009) at 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Today numerous international [[non-governmental organisations]] and [[intergovernmental organisations]] are engaged in the protection of the rights of people of diverse sexual orientation as it is increasingly recognised that discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation is widespread and an unacceptable violation of human rights.

==Acts of Violence==
Acts of violence against LGBT people are often especially vicious compared to other [[hate crime|bias-motivated crime]]s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/19session/A.HRC.19.41_English.pdf Report on Discriminatory laws and practices and acts of violence against individuals based on their sexual orientation and gender identity], UN Human Rights Council, 17 November 2011, at [22].&lt;/ref&gt; and include killings, kidnappings, beatings, rape, and psychological violence, including threats, coercion and arbitrary depravations of liberty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/19session/A.HRC.19.41_English.pdf Report on Discriminatory laws and practices and acts of violence against individuals based on their sexual orientation and gender identity], UN Human Rights Council, 17 November 2011, at [20].&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of violent acts against people of diverse sexual orientation are too numerous to account here, and they occur in all parts of the world. A particularly distressing example is the sexual assault and murder of fifteen lesbians in [[Thailand]] in March 2012. In that example, two lesbian couples were killed by men who objected to their relationship and who were embarrassed when they were unable to convince the women into heterosexual relationships with themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iglhrc.org/cgi-bin/iowa/article/pressroom/pressrelease/1506.html Thai police ignore fifteen killings of lesbians and toms] (27 March 2012) International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission, press release.&lt;/ref&gt;

Often acts of violence against people of diverse sexual orientation are perpetrated by the victim's own family. In a case in [[Zimbabwe]], the multiple rape of a lesbian was organised by her own family in an attempt to "cure" her of homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G02/104/28/PDF/G0210428.pdf?OpenElement Report of the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences] Commission on Human Rights, 31 January 2002, E/CN.4/2002/83 at [102].&lt;/ref&gt;

In those cases, as in many other cases of violence against people of diverse sexual orientation, State law enforcement authorities are complicit in human rights abuses for failing to persecute violators of rights.

==Breach of the Right to Privacy==
{{Main| Right to Privacy}}
The [[right to privacy]] is a protected freedom under the UDHR,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/ Universal Declaration of Human Rights], Article 12.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ICCPR&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705115024/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm |date=2008-07-05 }}, Article 17.&lt;/ref&gt; which reflects the "widespread, if not universal, human need to pursue certain activities within an intimate sphere, free of outside interference. The possibility to do so is fundamental to personhood."&lt;ref&gt;E Heinze ''Sexual Orientation: A Human Right'' (Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, Dordrecht, 1995) at 172.&lt;/ref&gt; Intimate relationships, whether between two people of the same sex or of different sexes, are among those activities that are subject to a right of privacy.

It has been successfully argued in a number of cases that criminalization of homosexual relationships is an interference with the right to privacy, including decisions in the [[European Court of Human Rights]] and the UNHRC.&lt;ref&gt;''Dudgeon v UK'' A 45 (1981); (1982) 4 EHRR 149; ''Norris v Ireland'' A 142 (1988); (1988) 13 EHRR 186; ''Toonen v Australia'' (488/1992), CCPR/C/50/D/488/1992 (1994); 1-3 IHRR 97 (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

The freedom to decide on one's own consensual adult relationships, including the gender of that person, without the interference of the State is a fundamental human right. To prohibit the relationships of people of diverse sexual orientation is a breach of the right to sexuality and the right to privacy.

==Freedom of Expression, Assembly and Association==
{{Main| Freedom of Speech| Freedom of Assembly}}
Every person, by virtue of their [[individual autonomy]], is free to express themselves, assemble and join in association with others. [[Freedom of expression]] is a protected human right under Article 19 of the UDHR and  Article 19 of the ICCPR, as is the right to [[freedom of assembly]] under Article 20 of the UDHR and Article 21 of the ICCPR.

LGBT people are discriminated against in respect of their ability to defend and promote their rights. Gay pride marches, peaceful demonstrations and other events promoting LGBT rights are often banned by State governments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G06/121/89/PDF/G0612189.pdf?OpenElement Report by the Special Rapporteur on Contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance] (2006) Commission of Human Rights E/CN.4/2006/16/Add.1 at [72].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 gay pride marches were banned in Serbia&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15134182 Serbia bans gay pride march citing violence fears], (2011) BBC.&lt;/ref&gt; and another march in Moscow was broken up by police, who arrested thirty leading gay rights activists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2011/05/27/moscow-police-will-break-up-illegal-gay-pride-march/ Moscow police will break up banned gay pride march], (2011) Pink News.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yogyakarta Principles==
In 2005, twenty-nine experts undertook the drafting of the [[Yogyakarta Principles]] on the Application of International Human Rights Law in relation to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/principles_en.htm The Yogyakarta Principles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509135718/http://www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/principles_en.htm |date=2008-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The document was intended to set out experiences of human rights violations against people of diverse sexual orientation and transgender people, the application of international human rights law to those experiences and the nature of obligations on States in respect of those experiences.&lt;ref&gt;M O'Flaherty and J Fisher ''Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and International Human Rights Law: Contextualising the Yogyakarta Principles'' (2008) 8 HRLR 207 at 233.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Principles can be broadly categorised into the following:
* Principles 1 to 3 set out the universality of human rights and their application to all persons.
* Principles 4 to 11 address fundamental rights to life, freedom from violence and torture, privacy, access to justice and freedom from arbitrary detention.
* Principles 12 to 18 set out non-discrimination in relation of economic, social and cultural rights, including employment, accommodation, social security, education and health.
* Principles 19 to 21 emphasise the importance of freedom of expression, identity and sexuality, without State interference, including peaceful assembly.
* Principles 22 and 23 set out the right to seek asylum from persecution of based on sexual orientation.
* Principles 24 to 26 set out the right to participate in family and cultural life and public affairs.
* Principle 27 sets out the right to promote and defend human rights without discrimination based on sexual orientation.
* Principles 28 and 29 emphasise the importance of holding those who violate human rights accountable, and ensuring redress for those who face rights violations.

The Yogyakarta Principles is an instrument of [[soft law]] and is therefore not binding. But it does provide an important standard for States in their obligation to protect the rights of individuals of diverse sexual orientation.

==The Right to Sexuality and the United Nations==
{{Main| Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity at the United Nations}}

On June 17, 2011 the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] in a Resolution on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity, adopted by a vote of 23 in favour, 19 against, and 3 abstentions, requested the commission of a study to document discriminatory laws and acts of violence against people based on their sexual orientation and gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11167&amp;LangID=E UN Human Rights Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624081557/http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=11167&amp;LangID=E |date=2011-06-24 }}, June 17, 2011; see also [https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=38762 UN rights body hits out against violence based on sexual orientation], (2011) UN News Centre.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2011 Resolution was intended to shed light on how international human rights could be used to prevent acts of violence and discrimination against people of diverse sexual orientation.

On 15 December 2011 the first Report on human rights of LGBT people was released by the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/19session/A.HRC.19.41_English.pdf Report on Discriminatory laws and practices and acts of violence against individuals based on their sexual orientation and gender identity], UN Human Rights Council, 17 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Report made the following recommendations. In order to prevent such acts of violence occurring, [[United Nations Member States]] are recommended to:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/19session/A.HRC.19.41_English.pdf Report on Discriminatory laws and practices and acts of violence against individuals based on their sexual orientation and gender identity], UN Human Rights Council, 17 November 2011, at [84].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Promptly investigate all reported killings and serious incidents of violence against LGBT people, regardless of whether carried out privately or publicly, by State or non-State actors, ensuring accountability for such violations and the establishment of reporting mechanisms for such incidents.
* Take measures to prevent torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, ensure accountability for such violations and establish reporting mechanisms.
* Repeal laws that criminalize homosexuality, same-sex sexual conduct, other criminal laws that detain people based on their sexuality and abolish the death penalty for offences involving consensual sexual relations within same-sex relationships.
* Enact comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation, ensuring that combating discrimination based on sexual orientation is in the mandates of national human rights bodies.
* Ensure that freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly can be exercised safely without discrimination on sexual orientation or gender identity.
* Implement appropriate training programmes for law enforcement personnel, and support public information campaigns to counter homophobia and transphobia amongst the general public and in schools.
* Facilitate legal recognition of preferred gender of transgender persons.

Further action is yet to be taken by the United Nations, although a proposed declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity was brought before the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in 2008. However, that declaration has not been officially adopted by the General Assembly and remains open for signatories.

[[Image:Ruskin Cannery.jpg|thumb|right|Cannery operation in the Ruskin Cooperative, 1896]]
The '''Ruskin Colony''' (or '''Ruskin Commonwealth Association''') was a [[Utopian socialism|utopian socialist]] colony which existed near [[Tennessee City, Tennessee|Tennessee City]] in [[Dickson County, Tennessee]] from 1894 to 1896.  The colony moved to a slightly more permanent second settlement on an old farm five miles north from 1896 to 1899, and saw another brief incarnation near [[Waycross, Georgia|Waycross]], in southern [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], from 1899 until it finally dissolved in 1901.  Its regional location within the [[Southern United States]] set it apart from many other similar utopian projects of the era.  At its high point, the population was around 250.  The colony was named after [[John Ruskin]], the English socialist writer. A cave on the colony's second property in Dickson County still carries his name. The site of the colony's second settlement in Dickson County is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

The Ruskin Colony was founded by [[Julius Augustus Wayland]] (1854-1912), a newspaper editor and [[Socialism|socialist]] from [[Indiana]].  The roots of the Ruskin project can be found in the movement within American socialism at the time towards the creation of new model colonies which would, in theory, challenge the American industrial system by creating ethical alternatives built in rural settings.  The idea that new settlements such as Ruskin would eventually bring forth a revolution referred to as the "co-operative commonwealth" stood in contrast to socialists who believed that it was more important to do political and social organizing within the cities, the centers of industry.  According to W. Fitzhugh Brundage in the book ''A Socialist Utopia in the New South'': "The wastefulness and ugliness of competitive individualism, so glaringly apparent in late nineteenth-century cities, would be replaced by the efficient creation and collective control of wealth and technology" in this new settlement.

==Cooperative economics==
[[Image:Strawberry Pickers Ruskin Cooperative.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Strawberry Pickers Ruskin Cooperative, 1897]]
By requiring that all members of the colony become equal shareholders in the endeavor, Wayland constructed Ruskin so that it operated more as a legally-sanctioned [[corporation]].  Every colonist was then, in essence, a stockholder.  The colony, with its elected [[board of directors]], was to run much like any other company, except that it would "do all things necessary to make a success, financially and socially, of a co-operative colony."  (''The Coming Nation'', Feb. 3, 1894) Ruskin colonists manufactured and marketed pants, "cereal coffee," a vapor bath cabinet, chewing gum, belts and suspenders.  The system of work itself changed little from that of the world outside Ruskin in terms of hours devoted to the various industries, however the hours, schedules and rates of pay, and industries selected were all determined by the workers.  Ruskinites eventually abolished cash wages and adopted a system of [[scrip]] which was used in exchange for goods within the colony.  In securing their economic dependence, members of the settlement also gave ample time to creative crafts, theater, and other intellectual pursuits.  At one time late in the history of the colony, there even existed a band which toured southern Georgia.

Many of the products created in Ruskin were intended to supplement the income from the newspaper, ''The Coming Nation'', which was the primary source of financial stability.  The majority of the colony's money and time was put into the paper, which had at its peak in 1896 around 60,000 subscribers.  Besides being the chief flow of assets, the paper also gave voice to the men and women of the colony throughout its many editors.  Although Julius Wayland almost single-handedly founded the colony, he left in 1895 due to conflicts about ownership of the newspaper that ran counter to his claims of collective ownership.  Under Alfred S. Edwards, who succeeded Wayland, ''The Coming Nation'' included articles from the likes of [[George D. Herron]], [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]], and Herbert Casson (who later took up the editorial reigns after Edwards left the colony).

The eventual breakup of the Ruskin colony was due to several elements, the most problematic being the unequal distribution of membership rights of colonists complicated by the "shareholder"-type initial investment fees.  Much of the blame lay with the original [[charter member]]s, who had become entrenched in leadership and direction of Ruskin.  One particular issue which drew ideological divisions through the colony was that of [[Polyamory|polyamorous]] relationships, or the practice of "[[free love]]", within members of the colony.  Ruskinites opposed to these beliefs brought harsh criticism down on those who harbored free love sympathies, which were in many ways linked to [[Anarchism|anarchist]] currents that had been growing within the colony.  This could be traced to Alfred Edward's editorial slant towards anarchism during his time as editor of ''The Coming Nation''.

== Georgia ==
The colony eventually became mired in constant [[litigation]] over issues of property, with charter members who were now being pushed out of Ruskin seeking to dismantle the group through legal means.  The final auction of the Ruskin Colony site at Cave Mills and most of the communal property left the remaining members with only a fraction of what they had spent five years struggling to build.  The 240 members moved what they did have, which still included the newspaper and the printing apparatus for it, 613 miles on a chartered train to their new home in Georgia, where they merged with the Duke Colony in [[Ware County, Georgia|Ware County]] and formed the Ruskin Commonwealth.

However, after its first year in Georgia, the number of colonists dropped by half.  The new settlement, an old lumber mill, was not surrounded by the fertile land and good sources of water that the previous location had.  Ruskinites were plagued with disease, unprofitable business ventures, and a continual slide into poverty that eventually led to the auction of the property by the county [[sheriff]] to settle its debts.  The Ruskin Commonwealth was effectively disbanded in the autumn of 1901.

==Florida==
The Ruskin Commongood Society platted [[Ruskin, Florida]] on February 19, 1910.

'''School-related gender-based violence''' ('''SRGBV''') can be defined as acts or threats of [[Sexual violence|sexual]], [[Violence|physical]] or [[Psychological abuse|psychological violence]] happening in and around schools. This type of violence is due to [[Gender role|gender norms and stereotypes]]. It can include [[verbal abuse]], [[bullying]], [[sexual abuse]], harassment and other types of violence. SRGBV is widely spread around the world and is common in many societies. Millions of children and families suffer from this type of violence. Incidents related to SRGBV has been reported in all countries and regions of the world.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002466/246651E.pdf|title=Global guidance on addressing school-related gender-based violence|last=UNESCO and UN Women|first=|publisher=UNESCO and UN Women|year=2016|isbn=978-92-3-100191-8|location=19, 23-24, 26, 28, 31, 34|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scale ==
Many governments and organizations around the world are working towards getting reliable information regarding SRGBV, as it has been proved to be an urgent matter that should be solved. Based on all the data related to SRGBV around the world collected, it is important to try to find solutions in order to tackle this problematic.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For instance, [[UNICEF|UNICEF's]] report ''Hidden in Plain Sight'' included the largest collection of data relating to violence against children. As aforementioned, this report proofs how physical and sexual abuse takes place at schools.&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF. 2014. ''Hidden in Plain Sight: A Statistical Analysis of Violence against Children''. New York, UNICEF. http:// les.unicef.org/publications/ les/Hidden_in_plain_sight_statistical_analysis_EN_3_Sept_2014.pdf&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; The most common types of abuse include:
* Bullying, with one out of three students between the ages of 13 and 15 worldwide claiming to suffer from this type of violence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Sexual violence, with one in 10 girls under 20 experiencing such violence. According to the Southern and Eastern Africa Consortium for Monitoring Education Quality (SACMEQ), two out of five school directors in Southern and Eastern Africa recognize sexual harassment happened among pupils of their establishments.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO/UNGEI. 2015. ''School-related gender-based violence is preventing the achievement of quality education for all''. Global Monitoring Report Policy Paper 17, March 2015. Paris, UNESCO. http:// unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002321/232107e.pdf&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;
* Also [[corporal punishment]] at school is considered to be a worrying type of abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Greene, M., Robles, O., Stout, K. and Suvilaakso, T. 2013. ''A Girls’ Rights to Learn without Fear: Working to end Gender-Based Violence at School''. Toronto, Plan Canada. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://plan-international.org/about-&lt;/nowiki&gt; plan/resources/publications/campaigns/a-girl2019s-right-to-learn-without-fear/&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; Fifty percent of the children population in the world live in countries where protection against corporal punishment is inexistent (at the legal and at the moral level).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Disadvantaged groups are also victims of SRGBV. It has been reported that more than 3000 schoolchildren from Uganda, out of which 24 per cent of girls between 11 and 14 years old suffering from disabilities are victims of sexual violence. 12 per cent of girls who do not suffer from disability are victims of sexual violence.&lt;ref&gt;Devries, K., Kyegome, N., Zuurmond, M., Parkes, J., Child, J., Walakira, E. and Naker, D. 2014. Violence against primary school children with disabilities in Uganda: a cross-sectional study. ''BMC Public Health'', Vol. 14, p. 1,017.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* [[Gay bashing|Homophobic bullying]] is one of the most common forms of bullying. According to research by [[UNESCO]], more than 60 per cent of [[Intersex and LGBT|LGBTI]] children in Chile, Mexico and Peru were bullied. More than 55 per cent of self-identified LGBTI students in Thailand communicated they were being bullied; in the United Kingdom, over 90 per cent of secondary school students reported homophobic bullying in their schools.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2012a. Good Policy and Practice in HIV and Health Education: Education Sector Responses to Homophobic Bullying, Booklet 8. Paris, UNESCO. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/&lt;/nowiki&gt; images/0021/002164/216493e.pdf&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; Several country-based examples, including New Zealand and Norway show that lesbian, gay and bisexual students are three times more likely to be bullied than heterosexual students.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2016. ''Out in the open. Education sector responses to violence based on sexual orientation and gender identity/expression''. Paris, UNESCO. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/&lt;/nowiki&gt; images/0024/002447/244756e.pdf&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Cyberbullying|Cyber-bullying]] is also another issue which needs to be resolved. In the US, the majority of victims suffering from cyber-bullying encounter the same problems at school. They are also bullied within their institutions. Girls are more likely to suffer rom cyber-bullying than boys (Schneider et al., 2012).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, S., O’Donnell, L., Stueve, A. and Coulter, R. 2012. Cyberbullying, School Bullying, and Psychological Distress: A Regional Census of High School Students. ''American Journal of Public Health'', Vol. 102, No. 1, pp. 171–177.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Root causes&amp;nbsp;==
Social beliefs influence gender relations in all countries of the world. In this sense, the root of violence against children depends on social construction and how the populations behave vis-a-vis gender-related issues. Some of the root issues include:
* Gender discriminatory norms: These promote the belief according to which men are more powerful than women and that they can prove their power because they are stronger. In many societies, [[Gender role|dominant gender norms]] prevail and influence people. LGBTI people, who do not follow these gender norms often suffer from violence if they do not comply with these norms. Indeed, many people often consider LGBT people as not "proper" and judge them inciting violence against this group.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Use of violence to show power: Authority is often shaped by held beliefs that promote male domination among women. At the school level, this implies male and female teachers are more powerful that children, perpetrating the belief that teachers have power over children. Then, authority is reinforced and maintained.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Other factors include [[Economic inequality|income inequality]], as it is a proof of social constraints.  Moreover, [[social media]], [[Child grooming#Over the Internet|online grooming]] and [[Internet troll|trolling]] – also facilitate violence among children, as this spaces are difficult to track down by the police.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Schools and the education system in general follow a specific social and structural framework. The dynamics of the education sector produce and reproduce environments potentially dangerous for children. It is the system itself which unintentionally exposes children to types of violence that might at times replicate, reinforce or recreate power dynamics followed by the society and the people belonging to this. There are several actors in society who are responsible for participating in and creating these dynamics, including policy-makers, authority figures, teachers, parents, other students and others. In order for these dynamics to change, a lot of effort is required at schools and in society in general.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Consequences ==
Being exposed or having experienced SRGBV can have critical impacts on children's development. Especially in terms of mental and physical well-being, including children's health (HIV and early pregnancy). It has been demonstrated that victims of violence are more likely to accept aggressive types of behaviors or be violent themselves after suffering from violence.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Heise, L. 2011. What works to prevent partner violence? London, STRIVE, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://strive.lshtm.ac.uk/system/&lt;/nowiki&gt; les/attachments/What%20works%20to%20 prevent%20partner%20violence.pdf&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; This creates a vicious circle in which violence becomes wrongly acceptable. SRGBV can have negative and long-term consequences for the future of young people, as it forges their adult personalities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Challenges of addressing SRGBV ==
Addressing SRGBV raises important challenges and is very complex. The concept is not understood by many and is considered sensitive for many. Actors from the education sector, governments and policy-makers and individuals attending schools face several challenges regarding SRGBV. These include:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Social cultural norms ===
Reporting on SRGBV situations around the world has become especially difficult since social and cultural norms do not promote this practice. Moreover, implicitly they discourage it. Many actors from society including teachers; school directors and policy-makers still avoid talking to children openly about gender; violence and sex. They fear promoting sensitive materials to children because of the taboo present in society. Work, time and patience are required to overcome set-ideas promoted by parents within their communities. It is necessary to start real and honest dialogues with children in order to create guaranty real and long-lasting results.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Gender inequality ===
[[Gender inequality|Gender inequalities]] refer to the devaluation and discrimination of women an girls in a society. This results on giving more power to men and boys, while demeaning women and girls. For instance, a study in Ethiopia highlighted that even though 93 per cent of male students recognized violence against girls to be illegal, about 33 per cent thought it is acceptable for male students to have what they want, and appeal to their charm or force to get. 21 per cent recognized behaving this way.&lt;ref&gt;ActionAid. 2004. ''Stop Violence against Girls in Schools''. London, ActionAid.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Capacity constraints ===
Capacity constraints in education systems, are also responsible for slowing down the progress related to preventing SRGBV. One of the most important challenges is the training of teachers with the tools and sensitivity to teach curriculum against violence and promote gender equality. In order for real change to happen, it is necessary to introduce these new tools slowly, analyzing who is the best to communicate these elements and what skills and knowledge are needed. What's more, having enough resources will be very important to implement change.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Weak coordination and monitoring mechanisms ===
Another factor that limits the progress related to stopping SRGBV is weak coordination and unreliable monitoring mechanisms. These render difficult the collaboration between ministries of education, police, social services, child protection and more. This is important because if this collaboration is not fluent, it will be difficult to stop SRGBV. A renewal in the organization's cultural landscape will be needed to overcome challenges, including bureaucracy that disrupts the flow of knowledge sharing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Weak service support for victims ===
Limited access to quality services, including child protection an social services among others (often absent) are due to the quality of services. This particularly concerns fragile communities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Lack of governance ===
In the majority of countries, there is currently no legislation that protects children from violence at school, meaning not much can be done when it happens. However, it is the case that some countries have recently introduced legislations specifically for schools. This said, legislation related aspects have become a real challenge. As to stop SRGBV, perpetrators must be punished.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Limited evidence ===
Emerging, but limited, evidence base on what works, although this is an area that is receiving increasing attention. The few evaluations of SRGBV interventions that currently exist vary greatly in methodology, rigour, scale and scope. This makes it difficult to identify best practice and draw conclusions about effective strategies that can be transferred to other settings. There is also a growing body of promising practices and existing knowledge that has not yet been fully documented.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Insufficient data and research ===
As previously mentioned, many challenges slow down the reporting and impact on the quality of providing reliable data regarding certain types of violence. This implies data is incomplete in contexts such as sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, and disability among others. This is important as all of these contexts are important to fight against SRGBV. According to a recent study by [[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]], to tackle SRGBV it is necessary to rely on large-scale studies which include findings that can be compared across countries; studies showing different forms of SRGBV, connections between behavior change and a discrepancy between research and practice. It is necessary to invest in strong data management system tools which divide data and will make it easier for people to analyze it.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;RTI International. 2016. ''Literature Review on School-Related Gender-Based Violence: How it is Defined and Studied''. Washington, DC: U.S. Agency for International Development.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Six guiding strategies for national action ==

=== Leadership: Laws, policies and education reform ===
Governments should demonstrate leadership at the national level by:
* developing and implementing laws to protect children from violence, ensuring accountability and treating all children equally
* adopting a comprehensive, multisectoral national policy and action plan to prevent and respond to SRGBV
* strengthening connections between education and child protection policies, procedures and systems
* reforming the education system for an enhanced and holistic response.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Environment: Ensuring schools are safe and supportive ===
In order to render schools safer, it is important to adopt whole-school approaches that will create better environments for children. Also different types of stakeholders at the school level  should become engaged at local communities and government. There are three specific strategies:
* creating safe and welcoming spaces
* ensuring governing bodies and school management send strong messages that SRGBV is not acceptable and is taken seriously
* developing and implementing codes of conduct.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Prevention: Curriculum, teaching and learning ===
At the education sector level, students should be taught in a certain way and certain topics. In order to prevent SRGBV, it is important to: 
* [[curriculum]] approaches that prevent violence and promote gender equality
* training education staff to give them the tools to prevent and respond to SRGBV
* safe spaces where co-curricular interventions can be a useful entry point for addressing SRGBV.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Responses: In and around schools ===
* When SRGBV does occur, there should be clear, safe and accessible procedures and mechanisms in place for reporting incidents, assisting victims and referring cases to the appropriate authorities. Key strategies include:
* providing easily accessible, child-sensitive and confidential reporting mechanisms
* providing counseling and support
* referral to law enforcement and healthcare services.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Partnerships: Collaborating with and engaging key stakeholders ===
SRGBV being a very complex issue, it is necessary to involve many and several types of stakeholders. Thus it is about creating partnerships in order to tackle SRGBV:
* coordination/collaboration between key ministries as well as at the district level
* partnerships with teachers’ unions
* participation of girls and boys
* working with families and the wider communities
* engaging civil society organizations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Evidence: Monitoring and evaluation ===
* National action should be informed by research and data on SRGBV, including:
* formative research on SRGBV to inform policy and programme development
* comprehensive national data collection systems
* indicators to track progress
* evaluations to assess impact.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Sensory neuroscience''' is a subfield of [[neuroscience]] which explores the anatomy and physiology of [[neuron]]s that are part of [[sensory system]]s such as vision, hearing, and olfaction. Neurons in sensory regions of the brain respond to stimuli by firing one or more nerve impulses ([[action potential]]s) following stimulus presentation. How is information about the outside world [[neural encoding|encoded]] by the rate, timing, and pattern of action potentials? This so-called [[neural code]] is currently poorly understood and sensory neuroscience plays an important role in the attempt to decipher it. Looking at early sensory processing is advantageous since brain regions that are "higher up" (e.g. those involved in memory or emotion) contain neurons which encode more abstract representations. However, the hope is that there are unifying principles which govern how the brain encodes and processes information. Studying sensory systems is an important stepping stone in our understanding of brain function in general. 

==Typical experiments==
A typical experiment in sensory neuroscience involves the presentation of a series of relevant stimuli to an experimental subject while the subject's brain is being monitored.  This monitoring can be accomplished by noninvasive means such as [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) or [[electroencephalography]] (EEG), or by more invasive means such as [[electrophysiology]], the use of [[electrode]]s to record the electrical activity of single neurons or groups of neurons. fMRI measures changes in blood flow which related to the level of neural activity and provides low spatial and temporal resolution, but does provide data from the whole brain. In contrast,
Electrophysiology provides very high temporal resolution (the shapes of single [[Dendritic spike|spikes]] can be resolved) and data can be obtained from single cells. This is important since computations are performed within the [[dendrite]]s of individual neurons.

===Single neuron experiments===
In most of the [[central nervous system]], neurons communicate exclusively by sending each other [[action potential]]s, colloquially known as "spikes".  It is therefore thought that all of the information a [[sensory neuron]] encodes about the outside world can be inferred by the pattern of its spikes.  Current experimental techniques cannot measure individual spikes noninvasively.

A typical single neuron experiment will consist of isolating a neuron (that is, navigating the neuron until the experimentor finds a neuron which spikes in response to the type of stimulus to be presented, and (optionally) determining that all of the spikes observed indeed come from a single neuron), then presenting a stimulus protocol.  Because neural responses are inherently variable (that is, their spiking pattern may depend on more than just the stimulus which is presented, although not all of this variability may be true noise, since factors other than the presented stimulus may affect the sensory neuron under study), often the same stimulus protocol is repeated many times to get a feel for the variability a neuron may have.  One common analysis technique is to study the neuron's average time-varying firing rate, called its [[post stimulus time histogram]] or PSTH.&lt;ref name="Budai 1994"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Budai| first1=D. | title=A computer-controlled system for post-stimulus time histogram and wind-up studies.| journal=J Neurosci Methods| volume=51| issue=2 | pages=205-11|date=Mar 1994 | PMID=8051951 | doi=10.1016/0165-0270(94)90012-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Receptive field estimation==
One major goal of sensory neuroscience is to try to estimate the neuron's [[receptive field]]; that is, to try to determine which stimuli cause the neuron to fire in what ways.  One common way to find the receptive field is to use [[Regression analysis|linear regression]] to find which stimulus characteristics typically caused neurons to become excited or depressed.  Since the receptive field of a sensory neuron can vary in time (i.e. latency between the stimulus and the effect it has on the neuron) and in some spatial dimension (literally space for vision and somatosensory cells, but other "spatial" dimensions such as the frequency of a sound for auditory neurons), the term [[spatio temporal receptive field]] or STRF is often used to describe these receptive fields.&lt;ref name="Theunissen 2001"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Theunissen| first1=FE.| last2=David| first2=SV.| last3=Singh| first3=NC. | last4=Hsu| first4=A.| last5=Vinje| first5=WE.| last6=Gallant| first6=JL.| title=Estimating spatio-temporal receptive fields of auditory and visual neurons from their responses to natural stimuli.| journal=Network| volume=12| issue=3| pages=289-316|date=Aug 2001| url=http://cocosci.dreamhosters.com/annehsu/papers/strfs.PDF | PMID=11563531 | doi=10.1080/net.12.3.289.316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural stimuli===
One recent trend in sensory neuroscience has been the adoption of natural stimuli for the characterization of sensory neurons.  There is good reason to believe that there has been [[evolution|evolutionary pressure]] on sensory systems to be able to represent natural stimuli well, so sensory systems may exhibit the most relevant behaviour in response to natural stimuli.  The adoption of natural stimuli in sensory neuroscience has been slowed by the fact that the mathematical descriptions of natural stimuli tend to be more complex than of simplified artificial stimuli such as simple tones or clicks in audition or line patterns in vision.  Free software is now available to help neuroscientists interested in estimating receptive fields cope with the difficulty of using natural stimuli.

Sensory neuroscience is also used as a bottom-up approach to studying consciousness.  For example, visual sense and representation has been studied by Crick and Koch (1998),&lt;ref name="Crick 1998"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Crick| first1=F.|author-link=Francis Crick| last2=Koch| first2=C.| title=Consciousness and neuroscience| journal=Cereb Cortex| volume=8 | issue=2 | pages=97–107 |date=Mar 1998 | doi= 10.1093/cercor/8.2.97| pmid=9542889 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and experiments have been suggested in order to test various hypotheses in this research stream.

'''Signal-to-noise ratio''' (abbreviated '''SNR''' or '''''S/N''''') is a measure used in [[science and engineering]] that compares the level of a desired [[Signal (electrical engineering)|signal]] to the level of background [[Noise (signal processing)|noise]]. SNR is defined as the ratio of signal power to the noise power, often expressed in [[decibel]]s. A ratio higher than 1:1 (greater than 0&amp;nbsp;dB) indicates more signal than noise.

While SNR is commonly quoted for electrical signals, it can be applied to any form of signal, for example [[isotope]] levels in an [[ice core]], [[biochemical signaling]] between cells, or [[Financial signal processing|financial trading signals]]. Signal-to-noise ratio is sometimes used metaphorically to refer to the ratio of useful [[information]] to false or irrelevant data in a conversation or exchange. For example, in [[internet forum|online discussion forums]] and other online communities, [[off-topic]] posts and [[spamming|spam]] are regarded as "noise" that interferes with the "signal" of appropriate discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W5bAcxc2TcgC&amp;pg=PA128 |page=128 |title=The Music Internet Untangled: Using Online Services to Expand Your Musical Horizons |last=Breeding |first=Andy |publisher=Giant Path |year=2004 |isbn=9781932340020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The signal-to-noise ratio, the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], and the [[channel capacity]] of a [[communication channel]] are connected by the [[Shannon–Hartley theorem]].

==Definition==
Signal-to-noise ratio is defined as the ratio of the [[power (physics)|power]] of a [[signal (information theory)|signal]] (meaningful information) to the power of background [[noise (electronic)|noise]] (unwanted signal):
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{SNR} = \frac{P_\mathrm{signal}}{P_\mathrm{noise}},
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''P'' is average power. Both signal and noise power must be measured at the same or equivalent points in a system, and within the same system [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]].

If the [[variance]] of the signal and noise are known, and the signal and noise are both zero-mean, SNR can be:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Signal-to-noise_ratio|title=Signal-to-noise ratio|work=scholarpedia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{SNR} = \frac{\sigma^2_\mathrm{signal}}{\sigma^2_\mathrm{noise}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

If the signal and the noise are measured across the same [[Electrical impedance|impedance]], the SNR can be obtained by calculating the square of the [[amplitude]] ratio:

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{SNR} = \frac{P_\mathrm{signal}}{P_\mathrm{noise}} = \left ( \frac{A_\mathrm{signal}}{A_\mathrm{noise} } \right )^2,
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''A'' is [[root mean square (RMS) amplitude]] (for example, RMS voltage).

===Decibels===
Because many signals have a very wide [[dynamic range]], signals are often expressed using the [[logarithm]]ic [[decibel]] scale. Based upon the definition of decibel, signal and noise may be expressed in decibels (dB) as

:&lt;math&gt;P_\mathrm{signal,dB} = 10 \log_{10} \left ( P_\mathrm{signal} \right ) &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;P_\mathrm{noise,dB} = 10 \log_{10} \left ( P_\mathrm{noise} \right ). &lt;/math&gt;

In a similar manner, SNR may be expressed in decibels as

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{SNR_{dB}} = 10 \log_{10} \left ( \mathrm{SNR} \right ).
&lt;/math&gt;

Using the definition of SNR

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{SNR_{dB}} = 10 \log_{10} \left ( \frac{P_\mathrm{signal}}{P_\mathrm{noise}} \right ).
&lt;/math&gt;

Using the quotient rule for logarithms

:&lt;math&gt;
10 \log_{10} \left ( \frac{P_\mathrm{signal}}{P_\mathrm{noise}} \right ) = 10 \log_{10} \left ( P_\mathrm{signal} \right ) - 10 \log_{10} \left ( P_\mathrm{noise} \right ).
&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the definitions of SNR, signal, and noise in decibels into the above equation results in an important formula for calculating the signal to noise ratio in decibels, when the signal and noise are also in decibels:
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{SNR_{dB}} = {P_\mathrm{signal,dB} - P_\mathrm{noise,dB}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

In the above formula, P is measured in units of power, such as watts (W) or milliwatts (mW), and the signal-to-noise ratio is a pure number.

However, when the signal and noise are measured in volts (V) or amperes (A), which are measures of amplitude, they must first be squared to obtain a quantity proportional to power, as shown below:

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{SNR_{dB}} = 10 \log_{10} \left [ \left ( \frac{A_\mathrm{signal}}{A_\mathrm{noise}} \right )^2 \right ] = 20 \log_{10} \left ( \frac{A_\mathrm{signal}}{A_\mathrm{noise}} \right )  = \left ( {A_\mathrm{signal,dB} - A_\mathrm{noise,dB}}\right ).
&lt;/math&gt;

===Dynamic range===
The concepts of signal-to-noise ratio and dynamic range are closely related. Dynamic range measures the ratio between the strongest un-[[distortion|distorted]] signal on a [[Communication channel|channel]] and the minimum discernible signal, which for most purposes is the noise level. SNR measures the ratio between an arbitrary signal level (not necessarily the most powerful signal possible) and noise. Measuring signal-to-noise ratios requires the selection of a representative or ''reference'' signal. In [[audio engineering]], the reference signal is usually a [[sine wave]] at a standardized [[nominal level|nominal]] or [[alignment level]], such as 1&amp;nbsp;kHz at +4 [[dBu]] (1.228 V&lt;sub&gt;RMS&lt;/sub&gt;).

SNR is usually taken to indicate an ''average'' signal-to-noise ratio, as it is possible that (near) instantaneous signal-to-noise ratios will be considerably different. The concept can be understood as normalizing the noise level to 1 (0&amp;nbsp;dB) and measuring how far the signal 'stands out'.

{{#tag:ref|The connection between [[optical power]] and [[voltage]] in an imaging system is linear. This usually means that the SNR of the electrical signal is calculated by the ''10 log'' rule. With an [[interferometer|interferometric]] system, however, where interest lies in the signal from one arm only, the field of the electromagnetic wave is proportional to the voltage (assuming that the intensity in the second, the reference arm is constant). Therefore the optical power of the measurement arm is directly proportional to the electrical power and electrical signals from optical interferometry are following the [[20 log rule|''20 log'' rule]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael A. Choma, Marinko V. Sarunic, Changhuei Yang, Joseph A. Izatt. Sensitivity advantage of swept source and Fourier domain optical coherence tomography. Optics Express, 11(18). Sept 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;|group="note"}}

===Difference from conventional power===
In physics, the average [[power (physics)|power]] of an AC signal is defined as the average value of voltage times current; for [[resistive]] (non-[[reactance (electronics)|reactive]]) circuits, where voltage and current are in phase, this is equivalent to the product of the [[root mean square|rms]] voltage and current:
:&lt;math&gt;  \mathrm{P} = V_\mathrm{rms}I_\mathrm{rms}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{P}= \frac{V_\mathrm{rms}^{2}}{R} = I_\mathrm{rms}^{2} R
&lt;/math&gt;
But in signal processing and communication, one usually assumes that &lt;math&gt;R=1 \Omega&lt;/math&gt;{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} so that factor is usually not included while measuring power or energy of a signal. This may cause some confusion among readers, but the resistance factor is not significant for typical operations performed in signal processing, or for computing power ratios. For most cases, the power of a signal would be considered to be simply
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{P}= V_\mathrm{rms}^{2} = \frac{A^{2}}{2}
&lt;/math&gt;
where 'A' is the amplitude{{clarify|date=April 2015}} of the AC signal.

==Alternative definition==
An alternative definition of SNR is as the reciprocal of the [[coefficient of variation]], i.e., the ratio of [[mean]] to [[standard deviation]] of a signal or measurement:&lt;ref&gt;

Schroeder | edition = 2nd | publisher = Academic Press | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-0-12-629810-9 | page = 433 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=v7E25646wz0C&amp;pg=PA433}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=b1&gt;Bushberg, J.

:&lt;math&gt;
 \mathrm{SNR} = \frac{\mu}{\sigma}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the signal mean or [[expected value]] and &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the standard deviation of the noise, or an estimate thereof.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The exact methods may vary between fields. For example, if the signal data are known to be constant, then &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated using the standard deviation of the signal. If the signal data are not constant, then &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated from data where the signal is zero or relatively constant.&lt;/ref&gt; Notice that such an alternative definition is only useful for variables that are always non-negative (such as photon counts and [[luminance]]). It is commonly used in [[image processing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8uGOnjRGEzoC&amp;lpg=PA354|title=Digital image processing|page=354|author=Rafael C.

Sometimes SNR is defined as the square of the alternative definition above.

The ''Rose criterion'' (named after [[Albert Rose (physicist)|Albert Rose]]) states that an SNR of at least 5 is needed to be able to distinguish image features at 100% certainty. An SNR less than 5 means less than 100% certainty in identifying image details.&lt;ref name=b1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Yet another alternative, very specific and distinct definition of SNR is employed to characterize [[film speed|sensitivity]] of imaging systems; see [[Signal-to-noise ratio (imaging)]].

Related measures are the "[[contrast ratio]]" and the "[[contrast-to-noise ratio]]".

==SNR for various modulation systems==

===Amplitude modulation===

Channel signal-to-noise ratio is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{(SNR)_{C,AM}} = \frac{A_C^2 (1 + k_a^2 P)} {2 W N_0}
&lt;/math&gt;
where W is the bandwidth and &lt;math&gt;k_a&lt;/math&gt; is modulation index

Output signal-to-noise ratio (of AM receiver) is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{(SNR)_{O,AM}} = \frac{A_c^2 k_a^2 P} {2 W N_0}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Frequency modulation===

Channel signal-to-noise ratio is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{(SNR)_{C,FM}} = \frac{A_c^2} {2 W N_0}
&lt;/math&gt;

Output signal-to-noise ratio is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{(SNR)_{O,FM}} = \frac{A_c^2 k_f^2 P} {2 N_0 W^3}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Improving SNR in practice==
[[Image:Analyse thermo gravimetrique bruit.png|thumb|Recording of the noise of a [[thermogravimetric analysis]] device that is poorly isolated from a mechanical point of view; the middle of the curve shows a lower noise, due to a lesser surrounding human activity at night.]]

All real measurements are disturbed by noise. This includes [[electronic noise]], but can also include external events that affect the measured phenomenon — wind, vibrations, gravitational attraction of the moon, variations of temperature, variations of humidity, etc., depending on what is measured and of the sensitivity of the device. It is often possible to reduce the noise by controlling the environment. Otherwise, when the characteristics of the noise are known and are different from the signals, it is possible to [[filter (signal processing)|filter]] it or to process the signal.

For example, it is sometimes possible to use a [[lock-in amplifier]] to modulate and confine the signal within a very narrow bandwidth and then filter the detected signal to the narrow band where it resides, thereby eliminating most of the broadband noise. When the signal is constant or periodic and the noise is random, it is possible to enhance the SNR by averaging the measurement. In this case the noise goes down as the square root of the number of averaged samples.

Additionally, internal noise of electronic systems can be reduced by [[low-noise amplifier]]s.

==Digital signals==
When a measurement is digitized, the number of bits used to represent the measurement determines the maximum possible signal-to-noise ratio. This is because the minimum possible [[noise]] level is the [[error]] caused by the [[quantization (signal processing)|quantization]] of the signal, sometimes called [[Quantization noise]]. This noise level is non-linear and signal-dependent; different calculations exist for different signal models. Quantization noise is modeled as an analog error signal summed with the signal before quantization ("additive noise").

This theoretical maximum SNR assumes a perfect input signal. If the input signal is already noisy (as is usually the case), the signal's noise may be larger than the quantization noise. Real [[analog-to-digital converter]]s also have other sources of noise that further decrease the SNR compared to the theoretical maximum from the idealized quantization noise, including the intentional addition of [[dither]].

Although noise levels in a digital system can be expressed using SNR, it is more common to use [[Eb/N0|E&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;]], the energy per bit per noise power spectral density.

The [[modulation error ratio]] (MER) is a measure of the SNR in a digitally modulated signal.

===Fixed point===
{{see also|Fixed point arithmetic}}

For ''n''-bit integers with equal distance between quantization levels ([[quantization (signal processing)|uniform quantization]]) the [[dynamic range]] (DR) is also determined.

Assuming a uniform distribution of input signal values, the quantization noise is a uniformly distributed random signal with a peak-to-peak amplitude of one quantization level, making the amplitude ratio 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;/1. The formula is then:
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{DR_{dB}} = \mathrm{SNR_{dB}} = 20 \log_{10}(2^n) \approx 6.02 \cdot n
&lt;/math&gt;

This relationship is the origin of statements like "[[16-bit]] audio has a dynamic range of 96 dB". Each extra quantization bit increases the dynamic range by roughly 6&amp;nbsp;dB.

Assuming a [[full-scale]] [[sine wave]] signal (that is, the quantizer is designed such that it has the same minimum and maximum values as the input signal), the quantization noise approximates a [[sawtooth wave]] with peak-to-peak amplitude of one quantization level&lt;ref name="maxim 728"&gt;[http://www.maxim-ic.com/appnotes.cfm/appnote_number/728 Defining and Testing Dynamic Parameters in High-Speed ADCs] — [[Maxim Integrated Products]] Application note 728&lt;/ref&gt; and uniform distribution. In this case, the SNR is approximately
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{SNR_{dB}} \approx 20 \log_{10} (2^n \sqrt {3/2}) \approx 6.02 \cdot n + 1.761
&lt;/math&gt;

===Floating point===
[[Floating point|Floating-point]] numbers provide a way to trade off signal-to-noise ratio for an increase in dynamic range. For n bit floating-point numbers, with n-m bits in the [[logarithm|mantissa]] and m bits in the [[exponent]]:
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{DR_{dB}} = 6.02 \cdot 2^m
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{SNR_{dB}} = 6.02 \cdot (n-m)
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the dynamic range is much larger than fixed-point, but at a cost of a worse signal-to-noise ratio. This makes floating-point preferable in situations where the dynamic range is large or unpredictable. Fixed-point's simpler implementations can be used with no signal quality disadvantage in systems where dynamic range is less than 6.02m. The very large dynamic range of floating-point can be a disadvantage, since it requires more forethought in designing algorithms.&lt;ref name="rane fixed vs floating"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060515074349/http://www.rane.com/note153.html Fixed-Point vs. Floating-Point DSP for Superior Audio] — [[Rane Corporation]] technical library&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Often special filters are used to weight the noise: DIN-A, DIN-B, DIN-C, DIN-D, CCIR-601; for video, special filters such as [[comb filter]]s may be used.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Maximum possible full scale signal can be charged as peak-to-peak or as RMS. Audio uses RMS, Video P-P, which gave +9 dB more SNR for video.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Optical SNR==
Optical signals have a [[carrier frequency]] that is much higher than the modulation frequency (about 200 THz and more). This way the noise covers a bandwidth that is much wider than the signal itself. The resulting signal influence relies mainly on the filtering of the noise. To describe the signal quality without taking the receiver into account, the optical SNR (OSNR) is used. The OSNR is the ratio between the signal power and the noise power in a given bandwidth. Most commonly a reference bandwidth of 0.1&amp;nbsp;nm is used. This bandwidth is independent of the modulation format, the frequency and the receiver. For instance an OSNR of 20&amp;nbsp;dB/0.1&amp;nbsp;nm could be given, even the signal of 40 GBit [[DPSK#Differential phase-shift keying (DPSK)|DPSK]] would not fit in this bandwidth. OSNR is measured with an [[optical spectrum analyzer]].

==Types and abbreviations==
Signal to noise ratio may be abbreviated as '''SNR''' and less commonly as '''S/N'''. '''PSNR''' stands for [[Peak signal-to-noise ratio]]. '''GSNR''' stands for Geometric Signal-to-Noise Ratio. SINR is the [[SINR|Signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratio]].

'''Sumac Kawsay'''  ''Buen Vivir''  ("good living") rooted in the cosmovisión (or worldview) of the [[Quechua people|Quechua]] peoples of the Andes, sumak kawsay – or buen vivir, to give it its Spanish name – describes a way of doing things that is community-centric, ecologically-balanced and culturally-sensitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/blog/buen-vivir-philosophy-south-america-eduardo-gudynas|title=Buen vivir: the social philosophy inspiring movements in South America|last=Balch|first=Oliver|date=2013-02-04|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-03-19|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is related to tradition of legal and political scholarship advocating legal standing for the natural environment.&lt;ref name="Stone CD 1974 p 8"&gt;Stone CD, Should Trees Have Standing? Toward Legal Rights for Natural Objects. Southern California Law Review 1972;45:450; W Kaufmann, Los Altos, 1974 p 8&lt;/ref&gt; The rights approach is a break away from traditional environmental regulatory systems, which regard nature as property.&lt;ref name="Celdf"&gt;Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund (CELDF). 2008. http://www.celdf.org/, accessed April, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2000 animals, plants and other organisms have their rights to dignity recognised by the Constitution in Switzerland (art. 120), but the implications of this disposition are still not very clear. With the enactment of [[2008 Constitution of Ecuador|its 2008 Constitution]], [[Ecuador]] became the first country in the world to codify the Rights of Nature and to inform a more clarified content to those rights. Articles 10 and 71–74 of the Ecuadorian Constitution recognize the inalienable rights of [[ecosystems]] to exist and flourish, gives people the authority to petition on the behalf of ecosystems, and requires the government to remedy violations of these rights.

==History==
{{Further|Plant rights|Environmental movement}}

=== Rights of nature in legal history ===
In his famous work, "Should Trees Have Standing?", Christopher Stone presented the case for conferring legal personality and rights on the environment. As Stone explained, as a rights-holder the natural object would “have a legally recognised worth and dignity in its own right, and not merely to serve as a means to benefit ‘us’”. To achieve rights-holder status, the natural object must satisfy three criteria: [First], that the thing can institute legal actions at its behest; second, that in determining the granting of legal relief, the court must take injury to it into account; and third, that relief must run to the benefit of it.&lt;ref name="Stone CD 1974 p 8"/&gt;

In his dissenting opinion in the landmark environmental law case, ''[[Sierra Club v. Morton]]'', 405 U.S. 727 (1972), Justice [[William O. Douglas]] argued that "inanimate objects" should have standing to sue in court: {{quote|The critical question of "standing" would be simplified and also put neatly in focus if we fashioned a federal rule that allowed environmental issues to be litigated before federal agencies or federal courts in the name of the inanimate object about to be despoiled, defaced, or invaded by roads and bulldozers and where injury is the subject of public outrage. Contemporary public concern for protecting nature's ecological equilibrium should lead to the conferral of standing upon environmental objects to sue for their own preservation. This suit would therefore be more properly labeled as Mineral King v. Morton.&lt;ref name=405US727&gt;{{Cite court|title=a|url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/405/727/case.html#741|year=1972|accessdate=October 8, 2011|court=USSC|litigants=Sierra Club v. Morton|opinion=727|pinpoint=741–43|reporter=U.S.|vol=405}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
Douglas continued: {{quote|Inanimate objects are sometimes parties in litigation. A ship has a legal personality, a [[Legal fiction|fiction]] found useful for maritime purposes. The [[corporation sole]]{{mdash}}a creature of ecclesiastical law{{mdash}}is an acceptable adversary and large fortunes ride on its cases.... So it should be as respects valleys, alpine meadows, rivers, lakes, estuaries, beaches, ridges, groves of trees, swampland, or even air that feels the destructive pressures of modern technology and modern life. The river, for example, is the living symbol of all the life it sustains or nourishes{{mdash}}fish, aquatic insects, water ouzels, otter, fisher, deer, elk, bear, and all other animals, including man, who are dependent on it or who enjoy it for its sight, its sound, or its life. The river as plaintiff speaks for the ecological unit of life that is part of it.&lt;ref name=405US727 /&gt;}}

===Outcome from neoliberal development in Ecuador===

The Rights of Nature articles in Ecuador's constitution are part of a reaction to a combination of political, economic, and social phenomena. Ecuador's abusive past with the [[oil industry]], most famously the [[Chevron Corporation#Environmental damage in Ecuador|class-action litigation]] against [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]], and the failure of an extraction-based economy and [[neoliberal]] reforms to bring economic prosperity to the region has resulted in the election of a New Leftist regime led by President [[Rafael Correa]], and sparked a demand for new approaches to development. In conjunction with this need, the principle of "''Buen Vivir''" or good living, which focuses on social, environmental and spiritual wealth versus material wealth, gained popularity among citizens and was incorporated into the new constitution.&lt;ref name="Gudynas"&gt;Gudynas, Eduardo. 2011. Buen Vivir: Today's Tomorrow Development 54(4):441-447.&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of indigenous groups, from whom the concept of ''Buen Vivir'' originates, in the forming of the constitutional ideals also facilitated the incorporation of the Rights of Nature as a basic tenet of their culture and conceptualization of ''Buen Vivir''.&lt;ref name="Becker"&gt;Becker, Marc. 2011 Correa, Indigenous Movements, and the Writing of a New Constitution in Ecuador. Latin American Perspectives 38(1):47-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

The neoliberal development schemes in line with the "[[Washington Consensus]]" did not create prosperity for much of Ecuador's population, especially its [[Indigenous peoples in Ecuador|indigenous population]]s, who make up about 40% of the country's population.&lt;ref name="Acosta"&gt;Acosta, Alberto, Eduardo Gudynas, Esperanza Martínez, and Joseph H.

Between 'Marx and Markets'? The State, The 'Left Turn' And Nature In Ecuador. Tijdschrift Voor Economische En Sociale Geografie (Journal of Economic &amp; Social Geography) 103(2):150-163.&lt;/ref&gt; The global economic crisis of 2008 revealed the vulnerabilities of an extractive economy, and led to a period of political turmoil in the country that made obviously the need for a new more inclusive government that embodied a post-oil, post-neoliberal development paradigm.&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Acosta" /&gt; In late 2006, the election of leftist Rafael Correa, who ran on an anti-neoliberal platform, showed the emergence of a new political era for Ecuador.&lt;ref name="Arsel" /&gt;

===''Buen Vivir''===

''Buen Vivir'' ("good living") emerged as a response to the traditional strategies for development and their negative environmental, social, or economic effects. ''Buen Vivir'' is an alternative concept of development that focuses on the attainment of the "good life" in a broad sense, only attainable within a community; a community that includes Nature. A popular approach to ''Buen Vivir'' is the Ecuadorian concept of ''[[w:es:sumak kawsay|sumak kawsay]]'', meaning a full life in [[kichwa]]. Part of this concept also emphasizes living in harmony with other people and nature. ''Buen Vivir'' has gained new popularity, spreading throughout parts of [[South America]] and evolving as a multicultural concept. Social consensus led to the inclusion of ''Buen Vivir'' in Ecuador's new constitution, supported as an alternative to neoliberal development. The constitution outlines ''Buen Vivir'' as a set of rights, one of which is the rights of nature.&lt;ref name="Gudynas" /&gt; In line with the assertion of these rights, ''Buen Vivir'' changes the relationship between nature and humans to a more bio-pluralistic view, eliminating the separation between nature and society.&lt;ref name="Gudynas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SENPLADES"&gt;SENPLADES. 2009 National Plan for Good Living. Electronic document, http://plan2009.senplades.gob.ec/web/en/presentation, accessed May, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indigenous movement===

The inclusion of "Buen Vivir" and Rights of Nature in the constitution was ushered in largely due to the increased influence of indigenous activist groups in the political realm. After several years of worsening economic and environmental conditions, uprisings from various indigenous communities, who found themselves receiving less support from the state, while simultaneously their land was being increasingly encroached upon by oil companies, brought attention to their concerns.&lt;ref name="Arsel" /&gt; After historically being excluded from the political process, indigenous groups, especially concerned about the worsening environmental devastation of the extraction business and global [[climate change]], started social movements aimed at creating a new approach to development that would protect the environment and harmonize its relationship with people. [[CONAIE]] (National Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador), the largest federation of indigenous movements, encompassing 14 of the nation's indigenous groups, and other groups focused on social justice began lobbying for a new constitution that incorporated recognition of the nation's indigenous groups, their language, culture, history, and land rights, and inherently their concepts of ''sumak kawsay'' and ''[[Pachamama]]'' (English: "Mother Nature").&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt;

===Drafting===
President [[Rafael Correa]] included calling for a constitutional assembly in his 2006 campaign. On April 15, 2007, over 80% of Ecuadorians voted in favor of calling a new assembly, thanks in large part to the support of indigenous communities. Indigenous groups had been pressuring for a new, more inclusive constitution for years, and were therefore actively involved in the drafting process. Alberto Acosta, the elected Assembly President, pledged to make the assembly more inclusive and incorporate the concerns of the indigenous into the constitution. In the end, a few indigenous representatives were elected to the assembly.&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt; To create a constitution based on the principles of ''Buen Vivir'', the Constitutional Assembly, with the advice of the [[Pachamama]] Alliance, enlisted the help of the Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund (CELDF) to draft language for the new provisions of the constitution detailing the Rights of Nature.&lt;ref name="Celdf" /&gt; Indigenous groups also played a role in the drafting process. Fundación Pachamama, in conjunction with leaders in CONAIE, met with members of the assembly to present their ideas for the constitution and gain support. A national media campaign detailing the tenets of the new constitution and the Rights of Nature was also launched to inform and gain support from the public.&lt;ref name="FP"&gt;Fundación Pachamama (FP). 2011 [http://www.derechosdelanaturaleza.org/website/files/2011/01/Recogniting-Rights-for-Nature-in-the-Ecuadorian-Constitution-Fundacion-Pachamama1.pdf "Recognizing Rights for Nature in the Ecuadorian Constitution"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adoption===
On April 10, 2008, with 91 votes out of 130, the [[Ecuadorian Constituent Assembly|Constitutional Assembly]] approved Article 10 for inclusion in the new constitution. On June 7, the language of Articles 71 through 74, compiling the Rights of Nature, were presented and debated on, before receiving approval for inclusion in the constitution.&lt;ref name="FP" /&gt;
 
On September 28, 2008, a mandatory [[referendum]] was held to vote on the new constitution, where the adoption of the constitution was approved by 65% of voters.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;Smith, Gar. 2009, "In Ecuador, Trees Now Have Rights", ''Earth Island Journal'' 23(4):15-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text of the Rights of Nature==

===Title II===

===Rights===

===Chapter one===

===Principles for the enforcement of rights===

'''Article 10.''' Persons, communities, peoples, nations and communities are bearers of rights and shall enjoy the rights guaranteed to them in the Constitution and in international instruments.
Nature shall be the subject of those rights that the Constitution recognizes for it.

===Chapter seven===

===Rights of nature===

'''Article 71.''' Nature, or Pacha Mama, where life is reproduced and occurs, has the right to integral respect for its existence and for the maintenance and regeneration of its life cycles, structure, functions and evolutionary processes.
All persons, communities, peoples and nations can call upon public authorities to enforce the rights of nature. To enforce and interpret these rights, the principles set forth in the Constitution shall be observed, as appropriate.
The State shall give incentives to natural persons and legal entities and to communities to protect nature and to promote respect for all the elements comprising an ecosystem.

'''Article 72.''' Nature has the right to be restored. This restoration shall be apart from the obligation of the State and natural persons or legal entities to compensate individuals and communities that depend on affected natural systems.
In those cases of severe or permanent environmental impact, including those caused by the exploitation of nonrenewable natural resources, the State shall establish the most effective mechanisms to achieve the restoration and shall adopt adequate measures to eliminate or mitigate harmful environmental consequences.

'''Article 73.''' The State shall apply preventive and restrictive measures on activities that might lead to the extinction of species, the destruction of ecosystems and the permanent alteration of natural cycles.
The introduction of organisms and organic and inorganic material that might definitively alter the nation’s genetic assets is forbidden.

'''Article 74.''' Persons, communities, peoples, and nations shall have the right to benefit from the environment and the natural wealth enabling them to enjoy the good way of living.
Environmental services shall not be subject to appropriation; their production, delivery, use and development shall be regulated by the State.&lt;ref name="PDBA"&gt;[http://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Ecuador/english08.html "2008 Constitution of the Republic of Ecuador. Political Database of the Americas (PDBA)"].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
The Rights of Nature is significant as it is the first case where this concept has been evoked at the national level. The articles set out a rights-based system that recognizes Nature, or ''Pachamama'', as a right-bearing entity that holds value in itself, apart from human use. This differs from traditional systems that see nature as property, giving landowners the right to damage or destroy ecosystems that depend on their land. The rights-based approach spelled out in the Rights of Nature expands on previous laws for regulation and conservation by recognizing that nature has fundamental and inalienable rights as a valuable entity in and of itself. The system also assigns liability for damage to the environment and holds the government responsible for the reparation of any damage. Additionally, if an ecosystem's rights are violated, it gives people the authority to petition on behalf of the ecosystem to ensure that its interests are not subverted to the interests of individuals or corporations.&lt;ref name="Celdf" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Acosta" /&gt;
 
The inclusion of the Rights of Nature also makes the constitution more democratic and inclusive, as it reflects the indigenes' idea of Nature as a mother that must be respected and celebrated. This is the first constitution that has incorporated indigenous concepts of ''sumak kawsay'' and ''Pachamama'', as well as recognized the [[plurinationality]] of Ecuador. This has broad significance for the recognition of indigenous groups and their right to preserve their land and culture. The combination of human rights with the rights of nature will allow for more effective protection of indigenous communities.&lt;ref name="FP" /&gt;
 
The Rights of Nature also transforms the relationship between nature and humans by asserting that nature is not just an object.&lt;ref name="Mychalejko"&gt;Mychalejko, Cyril. 2008 Ecuador's Constitution Gives Rights to Nature. Philadelphia Independent Media Center.&lt;/ref&gt; By putting ecosystems on an equal footing with humans, the conception of humans as masters or as separate from nature is dismissed.&lt;ref name="Gudynas" /&gt; Instead, this system celebrates nature and recognizes that humans are a part of it.&lt;ref name="Arsel" /&gt;
 
The Rights of Nature are further incorporated in the updated National Plan for Good Living, which states guaranteeing the Rights of Nature and promoting a healthy and sustainable environment as one of its twelve objectives. Policies under the objective include aims to preserve and manage biodiversity, diversify the national energy matrix with renewable sources, prevent, control and mitigate environmental damage, promote adaptation to and [[mitigation of climate change]], and incorporate environmental approach in all public policies.&lt;ref name="SENPLADES" /&gt;

===Legal effects===
The Rights of Nature has been applied to several legal disputes and considered in government development initiatives.

====Wheeler c. Director de la Procuraduria General Del Estado de Loja====
''Wheeler c. Director de la Procuraduria General Del Estado de Loja'' was the first case in history to vindicate the Rights of Nature. The lawsuit was filed against the local government near Rio Vilcabamba in March 2011, who were responsible for a road expansion project that dumped debris into the river, narrowing its width and thereby doubling its speed. The project was also done without the completion of an [[environmental impact assessment]] or consent of the local residents. The case was filed by two such residents, citing the violation of the Rights of Nature, rather than property rights, for the damage done to the river. The case was important because the court stated that the rights of nature would prevail over other constitutional rights if they were in conflict with each other, setting an important precedent. The proceedings also confirmed that the burden of proof to show there is no damage lies with the defendant. Though the plaintiffs were granted a victory in court, the enforcement of the ruling has been lacking, as the local government has been slow to comply with the mandated reparations.&lt;ref name="Daly"&gt;Daly, Erin. 2012, [http://celdf.live2.radicaldesigns.org/downloads/The_Ecuadorian_Exemplar_The_First_Ever_Vindications_of_Constitutional_Rights_of_Nature.pdf "Ecuadorian Exemplar: The First Ever Vindications of Constitutional Rights"], ''Review of European Community &amp; International Environmental Law'' 21(1): 63-66.&lt;/ref&gt;

====República del Ecuador Asamblea Nacional, Comisión de la Biodiversidad y Recursos Naturales====
In March 2011, right after the ruling on the ''Wheeler'' case, the government of Ecuador filed a case against illegal gold mining operations in northern Ecuador, in the remote districts San Lorenzo and Eloy Alfaro. The rights of nature were violated by the mining operations, which were argued to be polluting the nearby rivers. This case is different from the previous in that it was the government addressing the violation of the rights of nature. It was also swiftly enforced, as military operation to destroy the machinery used for illegal mining was ordered and implemented.&lt;ref name="Daly" /&gt;

====Yasuni ITT initiative====
The Yasuni-Ishpingo, Tambococha, and Tiputini (ITT) Initiative, referring to the corridor of oil reserves within the [[Yasuni National Park]], is the first post-oil development initiative that recognizes that the benefits gained from the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]] are greater than the economic benefits from oil extraction. The aim of the initiative is therefore to protect the biodiversity of the area, which UNESCO has declared a biodiversity reserve, by keeping the oil reserves in the ground, in return for compensation from the international community for at least half of the projected benefit Ecuador would receive from the oil extraction (approximately $3.5 billion). These funds would be used to fund other economic initiatives to alleviate poverty and develop the renewable energy sector. The importance of keeping the oil in the ITT area in the ground has been argued as of international importance to mitigate the effects of global climate change by preventing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions and the local environmental devastation the extraction would cause. The Rights of Nature and other articles of the new constitution also make the protection of the park a legal imperative, as the extraction would be a violation of nature's rights.&lt;ref name="Acosta" /&gt; Though there originally was some difficulty evoking a sense of international responsibility to fund the initiative, especially with the national constitution requiring this law already, eventually in August 2010 Ecuador came to an arrangement with the UNDP for funding of the initiative through the issue of Yasuní Guarantee Certificates, denoting the amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions avoided and their monetary value, which can potentially be used in the [[European Union]] [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme|Emission Trading Scheme]].&lt;ref name="Arsel" /&gt;

==Reactions==

===Praise===
The adoption of the Rights of Nature by Ecuador has received praise internationally by many countries who see this as a revolutionary way to conceptualize the environment and a way for Ecuador to move beyond the extractive economy of its past.&lt;ref name="Madden" /&gt; Initiatives to adopt the concept of ecosystem rights have been taken or are being taken in various parts of the world, including Bolivia, Turkey, Nepal, and various municipalities in the United States.&lt;ref name="Celdf" /&gt;

===Criticisms===
Criticisms of the Rights of Nature have generally centered on the mechanisms of enforcement of the provision. One criticism is that though the constitution establishes stronger regulations for the environment, it also gives the state the power to relax these regulations if found to be in the national interest.&lt;ref name="Arsel" /&gt; Therefore, much of the enforcement of the ecosystem rights depends on the will of the government, or an active citizenry.&lt;ref name="Becker" /&gt; Indigenous groups have also expressed dissatisfaction that the constitution does not give local communities veto power over projects affecting their land.&lt;ref name="FP" /&gt; Others also feel a major weakness of the constitution is that it does not require prior or informed consent by communities before the start of development projects, which can undermine their ability to uphold the rights of nature.&lt;ref name="Mychalejko" /&gt; There are also concerns that the Rights of Nature could negatively affect [[foreign direct investment]] since companies will not want to comply with the more stringent regulations.&lt;ref name="Madden" /&gt; On the other hand, people are skeptical of the Correa administration for still approving projects by foreign extraction companies violating the Rights of Nature.&lt;ref name="Mychalejko" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12353">'''Task analysis''' is the analysis of how a task is accomplished, including a detailed description of both manual and mental activities, task and element durations, task frequency, task allocation, task complexity, environmental conditions, necessary clothing and equipment, and any other unique factors involved in or required for one or more people to perform a given task.&lt;ref name=Kirwan&gt;{{cite book |author=Kirwan, B. and Ainsworth, L. (Eds.) |year=1992 |title=A guide to task analysis |publisher=Taylor and Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Information from a task analysis can then be used for many purposes, such as [[personnel selection]] and [[training]], tool or equipment design,&lt;ref name=Hackos&gt;{{cite book |author1=Hackos, JoAnn T.  |author2=Redish, Janice C.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1998 |title=User and Task Analysis for Interface Design |publisher=Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Procedure (term)|procedure]] design (e.g., design of [[checklist]]s, or [[decision support systems]]) and [[automation]]. Though distinct, task analysis is related to [[user analysis]].

==Applications==
The term "task" is often used interchangeably with [[wikt:activity|activity]] or [[wikt:process|process]]. Task analysis often results in a hierarchical representation of what steps it takes to perform a task for which there is a goal and for which there is some lowest-level "action" or interaction among humans and/or machines: this is known as '''hierarchical task analysis'''. Tasks may be identified and defined at multiple levels of abstraction as required to support the purpose of the analysis.  A '''critical task analysis''', for example, is an analysis of human performance requirements which, if not accomplished in accordance with system requirements, will likely have adverse effects on cost, system reliability, efficiency, effectiveness, or safety.&lt;ref name="data item description"&gt;{{cite book |title=DOD Data Item Description (DID) DI-HFAC-81399B: Critical Task Analysis Report|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Task analysis is often performed by [[human factors and ergonomics]] professionals.

Task analysis may be of manual tasks, such as bricklaying, and be analyzed as [[time and motion studies]] using concepts from [[industrial engineering]]. Cognitive task analysis is applied to modern work environments such as [[supervisory control]] where little physical work occurs, but the tasks are more related to [[situational awareness|situation assessment]], [[decision making]], and response planning and execution.&lt;ref name=Crandall&gt;{{cite book |author=Crandall, B., Klein, G., and Hoffman, R. |year=2006 |title=Working minds: A practitioner's guide to cognitive task analysis |publisher=MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Task analysis is also used in [[education]]. It is a model that is applied to classroom tasks to discover which [[curriculum]] components are well matched to the capabilities of students with [[learning disabilities]] and which task modification might be necessary. It discovers which tasks a person hasn't mastered, and the information processing demands of tasks that are easy or problematic. In behavior modification, it is a breakdown of a complex behavioral sequence into steps. This often serves as the basis for [[chaining]].

The results of task analysis are often represented in task models, which clearly indicate the relations among the various tasks, An example notation used to specify task models is [[ConcurTaskTrees]] (by [[Fabio Paternò]]), which is also supported by tools that are freely available.&lt;ref name=Paterno&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Fabio Paternò]] |year=2002 |title=CTTE: Support for Developing and Analysing Task Models for Interactive System Design |publisher=IEEE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Versus work domain analysis==
If task analysis is likened to a set of instructions on how to navigate from Point A to Point B, then [[Work domain analysis]] (WDA) is like having a map of the terrain that includes Point A and Point B. WDA is broader and focuses on the environmental constraints and opportunities for behavior, as in [[James J. Gibson|Gibsonian]] [[ecological psychology]] and [[ecological interface design]] (Vicente, 1999; Bennett &amp; Flach, 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;61)

==Documentation==
Since the 1980s, a major change in technical documentation has been to emphasize the tasks performed with a system rather than documenting the system itself.&lt;ref&gt;Hackos and Redish, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; In [[software documentation]] particularly, long printed technical manuals that exhaustively describe every function of the software are being replaced by online help organized into tasks. This is part of the new emphasis on [[usability]] and [[user-centered design]] rather than system/software/product design.&lt;ref name=Brockmann&gt;{{cite book |author=Brockmann, R. John |year=1986 |title=Writing Better Computer User Documentation – From Paper to Online |publisher=Wiley-Interscience}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This task orientation in technical documentation began with publishing guidelines issued by IBM in the late 1980s. Later IBM studies led to [[John M. Carroll (information scientist)|John Carroll]]'s theory of [[Minimalism (computing)|minimalism]] in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=Carroll&gt;{{cite book |author=Carroll, John M. |year=1990 |title=The Nurnberg Funnel – Designing Minimalist Instruction for Practical Computer Skill |publisher=MIT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the development of [[XML]] as a [[markup language]] suitable for both print and online documentation (replacing [[SGML]] with its focus on print), IBM developed the [[Darwin Information Typing Architecture]] XML standard in 2000. Now an [[OASIS (organization)|OASIS]] standard, DITA has a strong emphasis on task analysis. Its three basic information types are Task, Concept, and Reference. Tasks are analyzed into steps, with a main goal of identifying steps that are [[Reuse#Reuse of information|reusable]] in multiple tasks.

==Hierarchical task analysis==
'''Hierarchical task analysis''' (HTA) is a task description method and a variant of task analysis. Task description is a necessary precursor for other analysis techniques, including [[critical path analysis]] (CPA). HTA is used to produce an exhaustive description of tasks in a hierarchical structure of goals, sub-goals, operations and plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stanton|first=N.A.|title=Human factors methods: a practical guide for engineering and design|year=2005|publisher=Ashgate|location=Aldershot, UK|author2=Salmon, P.M. |author3=Walker, G.H. |author4=Baber, C. |author5= Jenkins, D.P. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In HTA, tasks are broken down into progressively smaller units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lyons|first=M|title=Towards a framework to select techniques for error prediction: supporting novice users in the healthcare sector|journal=Applied Ergonomics|year=2010|volume=40|issue=3|pages=379–395|doi=10.1016/j.apergo.2008.11.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operations and plans===
Operations are the actions performed by people interacting with a system or by the system itself,&lt;ref name="Stanton"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stanton|first=N.A.|title=Hierarchical task analysis: developments, applications, and extensions|journal=Applied Ergonomics|year=2006|volume=37|issue=1|pages=55–79|doi=10.1016/j.apergo.2005.06.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and plans explain the conditions necessary for these operations.&lt;ref name="Kirwan" /&gt; Operations describe the smallest individual task steps in the HTA, i.e. those which cannot be broken down into plans and further operations. They are the individual actions, such as 'visually locate control' or 'move hand to control', which the user must perform in a particular combination to achieve the goal of task completion.

===Applying===
The following steps should be followed when conducting a HTA:
:# Define the task under investigation and identify the purpose of the task analysis. The analyst should have some further evaluation methods in mind for which the HTA will be useful and should have reason for needing this type of analysis to be performed.
:# Data collection – In order to carry out the HTA it is necessary to obtain data on how the task is performed. This could be collected via observation of the task in question or from a detailed specification of the device under analysis. Alternatively, [[Industrial &amp; Organizational Assessment|interviews or questionnaires]] with people that have first-hand experience of performing that task could be conducted to gather the necessary detail.
:# Define the overall task goal, which will be presented as the top level in the HTA. An example might be "increase fan speed by two steps". This describes what is being achieved by performing the task; however, at this stage there is no indication of how the task will be performed.
:# Determine the next level of sub-goals by breaking down the overall goal. A sub-goal for the above example might be "open the climate menu". This provides more information about how to accomplish the task; however, it can still be broken down into smaller units, which will describe the individual operations (performed via the visual, manual or cognitive modes) that need to be performed.
:# Continue breaking down the sub-goals until all operations are identified. Operations in the "reduce fan speed task" will include "move finger to climate menu button" and "touch climate menu button". 
:# Define plans to describe how to perform the operations in each sub-goal level of the hierarchy. In the fan speed example, the two operations will have to be performed in series, one after the other. The plan will instruct the user to "perform 1, then 2". Operations can also be performed in parallel, and in this case the plan would instruct the user to "perform 1 and 2 together". Numbers should be assigned to the different levels in the hierarchy.

====Organising the hierarchy====
Each level in the HTA should be numbered according to its hierarchical level: The overall goal is the highest hierarchical level and should be numbered 0. The first sub-goal in the hierarchy will be 1, also with plan 1. Further levels just extend this system - third hierarchical level: 1.1, fourth hierarchical level: 1.1.1, and so on. A HTA can be represented in list or diagram form. In list form lines should be indented to denote the different hierarchical levels. In diagram form each operation should be placed within a box and links should be made between them: a lower hierarchical level should branch from underneath a higher level operation. Plans should be written next to the branches to describe the way in which the branched operations should be carried out.

===Applications and limitations===
HTA is a task description method which is most commonly used as a starting point for further analyses such as multimodal CPA and SHERPA.&lt;ref name="Stanton" /&gt; On its own, HTA does not provide results for usability evaluation; however, you should be able to study the HTA in order to learn about the structure of different tasks. It may also allow you to highlight unnecessary task steps or potential errors that might occur in task performance. HTA is a fairly time-consuming method to carry out as each individual operation in a task needs to be analysed; however, creating a comprehensive HTA can considerably reduce the time required for other modelling methods.

'''Tata-tonga''' ({{lang-mn|Тататунга}}, [[Mongolian script]]: {{Mongolunicode|ᠲᠠᠲᠠᠲᠤᠩᠭ᠎ᠠ}}, ''{{lang|mn-Latn|Tatatungү{{nbh}}a}}'', {{zh|c=塔塔统阿|p=Tǎtǎ-tǒng'ā}}) was a [[Naimans|Yugur]] man involved in bringing and adapting the [[Old Uyghur alphabet]] to [[Mongolia]] in what is called the [[traditional Mongolian alphabet]] (Mongol bichig or hurdum bichig).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YLQW5lUajgkC&amp;pg=PA398&amp;lpg=PA398&amp;dq=%22Tata-tonga%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MkUutsYH3C&amp;sig=0_Vbz8TIylsEiLs61odq0OHoatA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1fVNTIr6FYXgnAew4oHYCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=12&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwCw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Tata-tonga%22&amp;f=false A history of Russia, Central Asia, and Mongolia] by David Christian&lt;/ref&gt; He was captured by [[Genghis Khan]] in the 13th century and soon taught the Old Uyghur [[alphabet]] to members of the court and adapted it, to match the Mongol [[Khalkha]] {{citation needed|date=September 2016}} language, although Genghis (or Chingis) himself never learned it.

The Uyghur script was used in Mongolia until its independence from [[Qing dynasty]] China, at the beginning of the 20th century and few years before Russia introduced [[Cyrillic]]. It is still used mainly in [[Inner-Mongolia]]. In current day Mongolia, Cyrillic is the official script for the Mongolian language, and the traditional script is referred to as the ''Old Mongol script'' ({{lang-mn|Хуучин монгол бичиг}}). Today, an estimated 6 million Mongolians from China can still read the traditional Mongolian script but only 3 million from Mongolia.

The [[Manchu alphabet]] was derived since the very end of the 16th century from this Mongolian script.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1098">'''Technological escalation''' describes the situation where two parties in competition tend to employ continual technological improvements in their attempt to defeat each other.  Technology is defined here as a creative invention, either in the form of an object or a methodology. An example is the mutual escalation seen between [[e-mail spam]]mers and the programmers of spam filters and other anti-spam techniques. Although [[Conflict escalation|escalation]] is usually meant negatively, if two companies are in an escalating competition to produce the best [[Widget (economics)|widget]], the consumer benefits because they get a choice between better and better widgets.

'''The Sustainable City''' is a 46 [[hectare]] property development in [[Dubai]], [[United Arab Emirates]]. Situated on the Al Qudra road, it is the first net zero energy development in the Emirate of Dubai. The development includes 500 villas, 89 apartments and a mixed use area consisting of offices, retail, healthcare facilities, a nursery and food and beverage outlets. Phase 2 of the development will include a hotel, school and innovation centre. 

The City was developed by Dubai-based Diamond Developers, whose Chief Executive Officer, Faris Saeed, has stated that much of his inspiration for the development came from [[University of California, Davis|UC Davis]] West Village.

Key elements of the City include:

* a residential area of 500 townhouses and courtyard villas inspired by Dubai’s old [[Al Bastakiya|Bastakiya]] district
* 11 natural ‘biodome’ greenhouses, organic farm and individual garden farms for local food production that use a passive cooling method with fans and pads.
* 10 MW peak solar production
* waste water recycling, with segregated drainage for [[greywater]] and [[Blackwater (waste)|blackwater]] using papyrus as a biofilter
* biking and shaded jogging trails
* charging stations for electric cars
* an equestrian centre

Apart from periphery roads and car parking areas, the development is a car-free site.

The parking areas are topped by solar shading featuring solar panels that are connected to an electrical grid to supply energy into different sections of the city.

Panels are also placed on the roofs of all of the houses.

The construction waste is reused to furniture the public spaces.

The townhouses have UV reflective paint to reduce the thermal heat gain inside the houses.

It states that the evolution of [[ribosomal RNA]] was a necessary precursor to the evolution of modern life forms.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite book| title=Dictionary of Theories| year=2002| page=557| last=Bothamley| first=Jennifer}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the advancement of the phylogenetic tree of life consisting of three domains rather than the previously accepted two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Woese|first1=Carl R.|last2=Fox|first2=George E.|title=Phylogenetic structure of the prokaryotic domain: The primary kingdoms|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=1977|volume=74|issue=11|pages=5088–5090|bibcode=1977PNAS...74.5088W|doi=10.1073/pnas.74.11.5088|pmid=270744|pmc=432104}}&lt;/ref&gt;While the existence of [[Eukarya]] and [[Prokarya]] were already accepted, Woese was responsible for the distinction between [[Bacteria]] and [[Archaea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koonin|first=Eugene V|date=2014-01-16|title=Carl Woese's vision of cellular evolution and the domains of life|journal=RNA Biology|language=en|volume=11|issue=3|pages=197–204|doi=10.4161/rna.27673|issn=1547-6286|pmc=4008548|pmid=24572480}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite initial criticism and controversy surrounding his claims, Woese's three domain system, based on his work regarding the role of rRNA in the evolution of modern life, has become widely accepted&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morell|first=Virginia|date=1997-05-02|title=Microbial Biology: Microbiology's Scarred Revolutionary|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/276/5313/699|journal=Science|language=en|volume=276|issue=5313|pages=699–702|doi=10.1126/science.276.5313.699|issn=0036-8075|pmid=9157549}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Homology as Evidence for Woese's Dogma ==

=== tRNA Homology ===
Evidence for Woese's dogma is well established through comparisons of RNA [[Homology (biology)|homology]]. Modern research allows more liberal use of [[RNA-Seq|RNA sequencing]], allowing for a better comparative analysis between distant RNA. When analyzing multiple strains of [[Escherichia coli|''E. coli'']], Root-Bernstein et. al. have compared [[Transfer RNA|tRNA]] encodings found within rRNA with tRNA found in ''E. coli'' to see if the secondary structure was the same as more “modern” tRNA present in ''E. coli''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Comparisons between the tRNA encodings found in the rRNAs and [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s of the control sequences found that “sortings” for these sequences were extremely similar, and comparisons of translated protein structure indicated that homology was likely&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Root-Bernstein|first=Meredith|last2=Root-Bernstein|first2=Robert|date=February 2015|title=The ribosome as a missing link in the evolution of life|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2014.11.025|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|volume=367|pages=130–158|doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2014.11.025|issn=0022-5193}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Additionally, sequences homologous to all tRNAs necessary for translation were present in 16s and 23s rRNAs, and synthetases to load these tRNAs were also found, indicating that many of the functions of transcription and translation present in more modern life exist in rRNA, if vestigially&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.


=== rRNA Homology ===
When comparing homologies of rRNA structures, it is necessary to analyze substructures. This is because models that study RNA structure on the whole do not currently exist&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caetano-Anolles|first=G.|date=2002-06-01|title=Tracing the evolution of RNA structure in ribosomes|url=https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/30/11/2575/1024880|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|language=en|volume=30|issue=11|pages=2575–2587|doi=10.1093/nar/30.11.2575|issn=1362-4962}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Generally, [[Phylogenetics|phylogenies]] of rRNA subunits are created to understand each component, and how they function and evolve. Through phylogenies created that depict rRNA structural elements that are present in all three domains of life, the oldest structural components can be determined through [[relative dating]]&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harish|first=Ajith|last2=Caetano-Anollés|first2=Gustavo|date=2012-03-12|title=Ribosomal History Reveals Origins of Modern Protein Synthesis|url=https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0032776|journal=PLoS ONE|language=en|volume=7|issue=3|pages=e32776|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0032776|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3299690|pmid=22427882}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These phylogenies were used in a study by Harish et. al., to show that a helical stem labeled h44 in small subunit rRNA can be described as the oldest structural component of rRNA, which holds particular significance, as this structure responsible for linking processes in the small subunit, which is responsible for decoding, with the large subunit, which is responsible for the formation of peptide bonds and the releasing of elongation factors&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. This essentially shows that the functional origin of the ribosome, responsible for protein synthesis, is common in all modern life throughout each of the three domains.

Evidence has also been obtained in studying eukaryotic organelles, such as the chloroplast. Zablen et al.’s phylogenetic analysis conducted electrophoresis on chloroplast ribosomal RNA, specifically on the 16S rRNA of ''[[Euglena gracilis]]''&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zablen|first=L. B.|last2=Kissil|first2=M. S.|last3=Woese|first3=C. R.|last4=Buetow|first4=D. E.|date=June 1975|title=Phylogenetic origin of the chloroplast and prokaryotic nature of its ribosomal RNA|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/806081|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=72|issue=6|pages=2418–2422|issn=0027-8424|pmid=806081}}&lt;/ref&gt;''.'' In conducting this experiment, researchers compared the electrophoretic fingerprint of this RNA to other chloroplasts and prokarya. In comparing these results, it was found that generally, these chloroplasts show a close genomic relationship, while a more distant one is seen for algae, and subsequently prokaryotic organisms&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. This experiment shows that the rRNA of distantly related organisms has a similar origin of that in eukaryotic organelles, supporting the idea that the evolution of rRNA was a necessary precursor of modern life.

== Ribosomes as Primordial Self-Replicating Entities ==
One of the reasons that Woese’s Dogma holds significance is because of the potential that RNA was the first primordial self-replicating molecule (see: [[RNA world|RNA World]]), meaning it would be  key in the progression of modern life&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bloch|first=David P.|last2=McArthur|first2=Barbara|last3=Mirrop|first3=Sam|date=January 1985|title=tRNA-rRNA sequence homologies: Evidence for an ancient modular format shared by tRNAs and rRNAs|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0303264785900759|journal=Biosystems|volume=17|issue=3|pages=209–225|doi=10.1016/0303-2647(85)90075-9|issn=0303-2647}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In particular, it has been proposed that ribosomes exist as a missing link in prebiotic evolution, with rRNA being a vestige of an ancient genome&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Some evidence exists for the proposal that rRNA functioned in the past to encode proteins that are key to ribosome function&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Root-Bernstein|first=Robert|last2=Root-Bernstein|first2=Meredith|date=May 2016|title=The ribosome as a missing link in prebiotic evolution II: Ribosomes encode ribosomal proteins that bind to common regions of their own mRNAs and rRNAs|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2016.02.030|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|volume=397|pages=115–127|doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2016.02.030|issn=0022-5193}}&lt;/ref&gt;. One notable example is the fact that rRNA proteins are commonly known to bind with their own mRNA&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. In addition, some ribosomal proteins not only regulate their own expression, but the expression of other proteins as well&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matelska|first=Dorota|last2=Purta|first2=Elzbieta|last3=Panek|first3=Sylwia|last4=Boniecki|first4=Michal J.|last5=Bujnicki|first5=Janusz M.|last6=Dunin-Horkawicz|first6=Stanislaw|date=2013-10-01|title=S6:S18 ribosomal protein complex interacts with a structural motif present in its own mRNA|url=http://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/19/10/1341|journal=RNA|language=en|volume=19|issue=10|pages=1341–1348|doi=10.1261/rna.038794.113|issn=1355-8382|pmc=3854524|pmid=23980204}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These are both indications of self-replication, and indicate the possibility that the mRNA that encodes ribosomal proteins evolved from rRNA&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;.

=== Criticisms Regarding Primordial rRNA ===
RNA existing as a primordial self replicating entity is an idea that faces criticism. The idea of rRNA in particular being sufficient on its own to explain the progression of modern life struggles due to the fact that it lacks certain key pieces of evidence. In particular RNA cannot be shown to be prebiotic, as there is no way for the nucleotides or nucleosides that compose it to be non-enzymatically replicated&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nelson|first=Kevin E.|last2=Levy|first2=Matthew|last3=Miller|first3=Stanley L.|date=2000-04-11|title=Peptide nucleic acids rather than RNA may have been the first genetic molecule|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/97/8/3868|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=97|issue=8|pages=3868–3871|doi=10.1073/pnas.97.8.3868|issn=0027-8424|pmid=10760258}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Additionally, other criticisms exist, such as the fact that RNA is not stable enough to have arisen prebiotically, and that it is too complex to have arisen prebiotically&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bernhardt|first=Harold S|date=2012|title=The RNA world hypothesis: the worst theory of the early evolution of life (except for all the others)a|url=https://biologydirect.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1745-6150-7-23|journal=Biology Direct|language=En|volume=7|issue=1|pages=23|doi=10.1186/1745-6150-7-23|issn=1745-6150|pmc=3495036|pmid=22793875}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This has led to the development of other hypotheses, such as 'proteins first', which states that proteins arose prior to RNA, or coevolved with RNA&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;. This has also led to the proposal of other primordial molecules that may have developed into RNA and DNA, such as [[Peptide nucleic acid|peptide nucleic acids]], which also show evidence of self replication&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Singhal|first=Abhishek|last2=Bagnacani|first2=Valentina|last3=Corradini|first3=Roberto|last4=Nielsen|first4=Peter E.|date=2014-09-18|title=Toward Peptide Nucleic Acid (PNA) Directed Peptide Translation Using Ester Based Aminoacyl Transfer|url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/cb5005349|journal=ACS Chemical Biology|language=EN|volume=9|issue=11|pages=2612–2620|doi=10.1021/cb5005349|issn=1554-8929}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Despite the fact that criticisms might exist on the primordial or prebiotic nature of rRNA, these criticisms are not aimed at Woese's Dogma on the whole, as Woese's Dogma only claims that the evolution of rRNA was a necessary precursor to modern life, not that rRNA arose prebiotically.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
