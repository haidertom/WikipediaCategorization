[[Image:Operational context of ATL.png|thumb|280px|right|ATL Operational Context]]

'''ATL''' ('''ATLAS Transformation Language''') is a model transformation language and toolkit developed and maintained by OBEO and AtlanMod. It was initiated by the [http://www.emn.fr/z-info/atlanmod/index.php/Main_Page AtlanMod] team (previously called ATLAS Group). In the field of Model-Driven Engineering (MDE), ATL provides ways to produce a set of target models from a set of source models.

Released under the terms of the [[Eclipse Public License]], ATL is an [[M2M (Eclipse)]] component, inside of the [[Eclipse Modeling Project]] (EMP).

== Overview ==
ATL is a [[model transformation language]] (MTL) developed by OBEO and [[INRIA]] to answer the [[QVT]] Request For Proposal. QVT is an [[Object Management Group]] standard for performing [[model transformation]]s. It can be used to do syntactic or [[semantic translation]]. ATL is built on top of a model transformation [[Virtual Machine]].

ATL is the ATLAS INRIA &amp; LINA research group answer to the OMG MOF/QVT RFP. It is a model transformation language specified both as a metamodel and as a textual concrete syntax. It is a hybrid of declarative and imperative. The preferred style of transformation writing is declarative, which means simple mappings can be expressed simply. However, imperative constructs are provided so that some mappings too complex to be declaratively handled can still be specified. 
An ATL transformation program is composed of rules that define how source model elements are matched and navigated to create and initialize the elements of the target models.

== Architecture ==
A model-transformation-oriented virtual machine has been defined and implemented to provide execution support for ATL while maintaining a certain level of flexibility. As a matter of fact, ATL becomes executable simply because a specific transformation from its metamodel to the virtual machine bytecode exists. Extending ATL is therefore mainly a matter of specifying the new language features execution semantics in terms of simple instructions: basic actions on models (elements creations and properties assignments).

== Example ==
[[Image:ATL presentation.png|center|thumb|600px]]

An ATL program (T1.atl here) will take model '''Ma.xmi''' as input and will produce model '''Mb.xmi''' as output. Both models may be expressed in the OMG [[XML Metadata Interchange|XMI]] standard. The [[model (abstract)|model]] Ma conforms to [[Metamodeling|metamodel]] '''MMa.km3'''. Model Mb conforms to metamodel '''MMb.km3'''. The [[KM3]] notation is a simple and neutral metamodel specification language.

The ATL program itself ('''T1.atl''' here) is also a model, so it conforms to a metamodel (the ATL metamodel) not presented here.

An ATL program is composed of a header, of a set of [[Side effect (computer science)|side-effect]] free functions called '''helpers''' and of a set of '''rules'''.

== Implementations ==
There is an associated ATL Development Toolkit [[Plug-in (computing)|plugin]] available in open source  	 
from the ATL&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eclipse.org/atl/ Eclipse ATL project website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160515142406/http://www.eclipse.org/atl/ |date=May 15, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] Modeling Project (EMP) that implements the ATL transformation language which is inspired by the [[Meta-Object Facility|MOF]] Query/View/Transformation language [[QVT]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eclipse.org/atl/documentation/ Eclipse ATL documentation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122072506/http://www.eclipse.org/atl/documentation/ |date=November 22, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A large library of transformations is available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eclipse.org/atl/atlTransformations/ Eclipse ATL Transformations] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122072535/http://www.eclipse.org/atl/atlTransformations/ |date=November 22, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; MOF QVT is a [[Domain Specific Language]] for Model Transformation. It supports models conforming to Ecore, EMOF, [[KM3]] (a specific [[Domain Specific Language]] for metamodel specification), etc.  ATL is also running on MDR/[[NetBeans]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2839">Between 2009 and 2012, '''Agriculture and Rural Development Day''' ('''ARDD''') was an annual event co-organized by the [[CGIAR|Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research]] (CGIAR), [[Earth System Science Partnership]] (ESSP), [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), [[Global Forum on Agricultural Research]] (GFAR), [[International Federation of Agricultural Producers]] (IFAP), and [[International Food Policy Research Institute]] (IFPRI).

== History ==
The first event took place as a side event at the [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] (COP15) in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agricultureday.org/ARDDay2009/|title=Agriculture and Rural Development Day 2009 Website|website=www.agricultureday.org|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second event took place as a side event at the [[2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] (COP15) in [[Cancún]], [[Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agricultureday.org/ardday2010/|title=Agriculture and Rural Development Day 2010|website=www.agricultureday.org|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third event took place as a side event at the [[2011 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] (COP15) in [[Durban]], [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agricultureday.org/ardday2011/|title=Agriculture and Rural Development Day 2011|website=www.agricultureday.org|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth event took place at the [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development]] (UNCSD)—also called Rio 2012, Rio+20, or the Earth Summit 2012—in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]]. It was co-hosted by the [[Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation]] (Embrapa) and the CGIAR.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cgiar.org/consortium-events/2012/06/18/agriculture-and-rural-development-day/|title=Agriculture and Rural Development Day|work=CGIAR|access-date=2017-12-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fifth and final ARDD, called Agriculture, Landscapes, and Livelihoods Day 5&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agricultureday.org/about/index.html Agriculture, Landscapes, and Livelihoods Day 5]&lt;/ref&gt;(ALL-5), took place alongside Forest Day on the sidelines of the [[2012 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] (COP18) in [[Doha]], [[Qatar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://wle.cgiar.org/thrive/2012/12/05/story-agriculture-and-climate-change-road-we%E2%80%99ve-travelled|title=The Story of Agriculture and Climate Change: The Road We’ve Travelled|date=2012-12-05|work=Water, Land and Ecosystems|access-date=2017-12-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, this event merged with [[Forest Day]] to become the [[Global Landscapes Forum]] (GLF).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2440">The '''Barsanti-Matteucci engine''' was the first [[internal combustion engine]]. In late 1851 or early 1852 [[Eugenio Barsanti]], a professor of [[mathematics]], and [[Felice Matteucci]], an [[engineer]] and expert in [[mechanics]] and [[hydraulics]], joined forces on a project to exploit the [[explosion]] and [[Thermal expansion|expansion]] of a gaseous mix of [[hydrogen]] and atmospheric air to transform part of the energy of such explosions into [[mechanical energy]].

==Origin==
The idea originated almost ten years earlier with Barsanti when, as a young man, he was teaching at St. Michael's College in [[Volterra]], Italy. An engineer from [[Milan]] Italy, Luigi de Cristoforis, described in a paper published in the acts of the Lombard Royal Institute of Science, Literature and Art, a pneumatic machine (later built and shown to work) that ran on [[naphtha]] and an air mixture, and which constituted the first liquid fuel engine.

==Prototypes==
During the twelve years of collaboration between Barsanti and Matteucci several prototypes of [[internal combustion engine]]s were realized. It was the first real internal combustion engine,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.barsantiematteucci.it/inglese/index.asp&lt;/ref&gt; constituted in its simplest realization by a vertical cylinder in which an explosion of a mixture of [[air]] and [[hydrogen]] or an [[illuminating gas]] shot a [[piston]] upwards thereby creating a [[vacuum]] in the space underneath. When the piston returned to its original position, due to the action of the [[atmospheric pressure]], it turned a toothed rod connected to a [[sprocket]] wheel and transmitted movement to the driving shaft.
  
==Patents==
Numerous [[patent]]s were obtained by the two [[inventor]]s: the 1854 English&lt;ref&gt;http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?CC=GB&amp;NR=185701655A&amp;KC=A&amp;FT=D&amp;ND=3&amp;date=18571201&amp;DB=EPODOC&amp;locale=en_EP&lt;/ref&gt; and Piedmont patents, the 1861 Piedmont patent of Barsanti, Matteucci and Babacci which was then used as a base to construct the engine of the [[Escher Wyss &amp; Cie.|Escher Wyss]] company of [[Zurich]] and put on exhibit during the first National Expo of Florence in 1861, and the 1861 English patent.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2578">The '''CADRE Laboratory for New Media''' was founded in 1985 at [[San José State University]].  It is currently coordinated by percussionist and media artist [[Andrew Blanton]]. It was previously coordinated by [[G. Craig Hobbs]] as well as [[Joel Slayton]], professor emeritus of SJSU, and director from 1991 to 2011. In Stephen Wilson's 2002 book, Information Arts: Intersections of Art, Science, And Technology, Wilson describes the focus of the CADRE labs as "the development and testing of emerging technology applications in art, design, education, and communications in the context of critical discourse." {{cite book |last=Wilson |first=Stephen |date=2002 |title=Information Arts: Intersections of Art, Science, And Technology |url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/information-arts |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher=MIT |page=870 |isbn=9780262232098 |author-link= }}

Founded in 1984, CADRE is the second oldest media lab in the United States and has a long and notable list of alumni. CADRE offers [[Bachelor of Fine Arts|BFA]] and [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] degrees in Digital Media Art.  CADRE has published SWITCH, an online journal of [[new media]], since 1995.

SWITCH and CADRE were early centers of the [[net.art]] movement that coincided with the [[Dot-com bubble]] in nearby [[Silicon Valley]].

The CADRE labs have historically worked closely with the ZeroOne Biennial, one of the foremost new media art exhibitions in the world. In 2006, CADRE, along with SJSU served as the academic hosts for the [[ISEA International|ISEA]] symposium and [https://web.archive.org/web/20070204134816/http://www.01sj.org/ ZeroOne Festival] held in San Jose.  CADRE students collaborated on several artist residencies and several current and former students had their artworks in the festival.

In [[telecommunication]]s, the '''capture effect''', or '''FM capture effect''', is a phenomenon associated with [[Frequency modulation|FM]] reception in which only the stronger of two signals at, or near, the same [[frequency]] or channel will be [[demodulation|demodulated]].  

The capture effect is defined as the complete suppression of the weaker signal at the [[receiver (radio)|receiver]] [[limiter]] (if it has one) where the weaker signal is not [[Amplifier|amplified]], but [[attenuate]]d.  When both signals are nearly equal in strength, or are [[fading]] independently, the receiver may [[switch]] from one to the other and exhibit [[picket fencing]].

The capture effect can occur at the signal limiter, or in the [[demodulation]] stage, for circuits that do not require a signal limiter.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Some types of [[Detector (radio)|radio receiver circuits]] have a stronger capture effect than others.  The measurement of how well a receiver can reject a second signal on the same frequency is called the capture ratio for a specific receiver. It is measured as the lowest ratio of the power of two signals that will result in the suppression of the smaller signal. 

Amplitude modulation, or [[AM broadcasting|AM]] [[radio]], [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] is not subject to this effect.  This is one reason that the [[Airband|aviation]] industry, and others, have chosen to use AM for communications rather than FM, allowing multiple signals [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmitted]] on the same channel to be heard.  Phenomena similar to the capture effect are described in AM when offset carriers of different strengths are present in the passband of a receiver.  For example, the aviation [[glideslope]] vertical guidance clearance beam is sometimes described as a "capture effect" system, even though it operates using AM signals.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

== Amplitude modulation immunity to capture effect ==
In FM demodulation the receiver tracks the modulated frequency shift of the desired carrier while discriminating against any other signal since it can only follow the deviation of one signal at a time. In AM, the receiver tracks the signal strength of the AM signal as the  basis for demodulation. This allows any other signal to be tracked as just another change in amplitude. So it is possible for an AM receiver to demodulate several carriers at the same time, resulting in an audio mix.

If the signals are close but not exactly on the same frequency, the mix will not only include the audio from both carriers, but depending on the carrier separation an audible tone (a beat signal) may be heard at a frequency equal to the difference in the carrier frequencies involved. For instance, if one carrier is at 1000.000 kHz, and the other is at 1000.150 kHz, then a 150 Hz "beat frequency" tone will result.

This mix can also occur when a second AM carrier is received on a channel that is adjacent to the desired channel if the receiver's ultimate bandwidth is wide enough to include the carriers of both signals. In the US AM broadcast bands this occurs at 10 kHz, which is the US channel spacing for the AM broadcast band. Elsewhere it can occur at 9 kHz, a commonly used channel spacing in many locales.

Modern SDR-based receivers can completely eliminate this by utilizing "brick-wall" filters narrower than the channel spacing that reduce signals outside the passband to inconsequential levels. Where such an overlap within the passband occurs, a high pitched whistle at precisely 9 or 10 kHz can be heard. This is particularly common at night when other carriers from adjacent channels are traveling long distances due to atmospheric bounce.

Because AM assumes short term changes in the amplitude to be information, any electrical impulse will be picked up and demodulated along with the desired carrier. Hence lightning causes crashing noises when picked up by an AM radio near a storm. In contrast, FM suppresses short term changes in amplitude and is therefore much less prone to noise during storms and during reception of electrical noise impulses. 

For [[digital modulation]] schemes it has been shown that for properly implemented [[on-off keying]]/[[amplitude-shift keying]] systems, [[co-channel interference|co-channel]] [[electronic selectivity|rejection]] can be better than for [[frequency-shift keying]] systems.

The '''Center for Advanced Security Research Darmstadt''' ('''CASED''') is a LOEWE Center for IT security research and development with an interdisciplinary and cross-organizational approach. It was founded in July 2008 by [[TU Darmstadt]], [[the Fraunhofer Institute for Secure Information Technology]] (SIT) and the [[Darmstadt University of Applied Sciences]]. CASED promotes and coordinates cooperation between the three institutions.

LOEWE is an initiative of the government of Hesse (Ministry of Higher Education, Research and the Arts) for supporting the development of scientific and economic excellence in Hesse on a long-term basis. The government of [[Hesse]] provides funding for the infrastructure of CASED as well as for various projects of the three institutions involved.

In those funded projects, computer scientists, engineers, physicians, legal experts and economists of the three cluster partners do basic and application-oriented research.

Research and development of new security solutions for important growing areas of IT technology, such as embedded systems and [[service-oriented architecture]], is the ultimate goal of the Center. Subsequently, they hope to prevent substantial economic damage caused by economic espionage, manipulation, and product counterfeiting. Another aim is to make new techniques and online services run smoothly and safely for both providers and users.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12596">{{Community}}

A '''community of place''' or '''place-based community''' is a [[community]] of people who are bound together because of ''where'' they reside, work, visit or otherwise spend a continuous portion of their time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|quote="The 'spatial community' is that which is defined by geography (e.g. municipal boundary, health region)".|vauthors=Ramsey D, Beesley KB|url=http://www.rrh.org.au/articles/subviewnew.asp?ArticleID=850|title='Perimeteritis' and rural health in Manitoba, Canada: perspectives from rural healthcare managers|journal=Rural and Remote Health (Internet) |volume=7|issue=4|page=850|year=2007|pmid=18081449}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a community can be a [[neighborhood]], [[town]], [[coffeehouse]], [[wiktionary:Workplace|workplace]], [[gathering place]], [[public space]] or any other geographically specific place that a number of people share, have in common or visit frequently. A community offers many appealing features of a broader social relationship: Safety, familiarity, support and loyalties as well as appreciation. Appreciation that is founded on efforts and contribution to the community, rather than the efforts, rank or status of an individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aDMyfMqgdHEC|title=Community and the Politics of Place|last=Kemmis|first=Daniel|date=1992-01-01|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=9780806124773|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances in technology, transportation and communication have evolved the concept of place and the limits society once had in interactions with one another. With these advances, barriers have been lifted and distance is no longer such a great factor in anchoring the flow of people, goods or information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gieryn|first=Thomas F.|date=2000-01-01|title=A Space for Place in Sociology|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|volume=26|pages=463–496|doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.26.1.463|jstor=223453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variables of a community ==

When identifying what it is that makes a community, it is important to break it down and understand the components that sociologist have found that creates solidarity between the community and its members. German Sociologist and Philosopher Ferdinand Tönnies spoke of these components as evolutionary terms in his theoretical essay ''Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brint|first=Steven|date=March 2001|title=''Gemeinschaft'' Revisited: A Critique and Reconstruction of the Community Concept|url=http://www.asanet.org/images/members/docs/pdf/featured/soth125.pdf|journal=Sociological Theory|doi=10.1111/0735-2751.00125|pmid=|publisher=American Sociological Association|volume=19|pages=1–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; (translated to Community and Society). ''Gemeinschaft'' would represent the childhood of humanity where as ''Gesellschaft'' would represent the maturity of humanity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== ''Gemeinschaft'' and ''Gesellschaft'' ===

''[[Gemeinschaft]]'' or community is smaller in number of members; its members usually share a common way of life (occupation/daily activities), common beliefs. Members have frequent interaction with one another as well as a tie of emotional bonds and distance from centers of power.

''[[Gesellschaft]]'' or society is much larger in terms of its members. Contrary to ''Gemeinschaft'', members do not share the same ways of life or beliefs. Members rarely interact with one another and have loose connections to each other. As well as being closer to establishments of power and regulated competitiveness among its members. This type of bond is most often found in urban communities that follow specific systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sharing the Cost and Benefits of Resource Activity|last=Barrera-Hernández|first=Lila|publisher=UOP Oxford|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Defining "place" ===
A "place" should be thought of as a geographic location, its material form and the investments of meaning and value; the combination of these concepts make a "place" a place. Geographic location is important because this is used to identify what and where a place is. This concept gives individuals a sense of direction and reference to location. The material form is physicality of the place, whether it be artificially made like a building belonging to an institution or establishment or a natural from, such as a well known land mass. Finally, the meanings and value of place is the shared meaning or psych of a location. For example, the understanding of an area or neighborhood to reflect some historic value, prestigious families, Utopian or a dangerous.

A place is not space; Space can be though of distance, size, direction- usually descriptions of geometric items. Space however can become a place when filled with things spoken of earlier, such as: Cultural practices, things, values and of course people. People of a place are usually influenced or are at least conscious of the strong and unique influential forces a place passes onto its people. Every place will exhibit its own unique and independent force of influence that consequently generates social life.

If one of the three defining features (location, material form and meaningfulness) is analyzed as having greater importance than another defining feature, the identity and definition of place is quash. The focus, favoritism or forgotten of any key feature (when defining place) prevents social construction. A place is more than a variable of social life, it is in fact what molds together social life. Creating solidarity, cohesion to form what is social life. Place often becomes a lens people use to see life through. It impacts an individuals evaluation of others and their identity, political position and practices as well as a tool to measure one's own life.

=== Constructing place ===
The modern globalized world has had impact on the construction of place and the relationship among different places. Politicians, financial establishments, engineers and architects are just a few of the occupations we can look at to break down the construction of place. When looking at the architecture of a place, we are looking at its material form. This material, these structures an architect produces are symbols of the experiences, styles and cultural influence a place had or has on the individual. In fact the architect could as well construct structures to celebrate the history of an area, the achievements of a hero or heroine and compliment the surrounding area the structure will be built in. By doing so, the architect is creating a look or feel that people can associate with the area.

[[Globalization]] as well had impact on the social identity of a community, creating competition among all members of the globalized world. For example, larger "major cities" tend to be proud of its identity it has generated and will continue to pursue this identity. Inspiring smaller cities to pursue this identity as well or one of a new face. In this light, politicians and media play a role in constructing the use of land in a geographic area. Cities are built and develop cultural meaning that conform with economic interests.

People inhabiting a place as well help with validity and creation of place. Individuals assimilate the meaningfulness, functionality, name and identity of a space – especially the more in contact they are with the area. The homogeneity of design and architecture of a given neighborhood allows members to identify the class of people as well as name of the area. Quite similar to how people address personal occupation by uniform, the sameness of a given area works in a similar fashion. This same reasoning occurs with structures that are unique; its individuality stands out so much, people assign meaning and identity to it. As stated before, place is not only conceptualized as a location but by the meanings, functionality and qualities people assign to the social stuff that are there. "Place-Stratification" is a consequence of such identity creation: public or private, rich or poor, black or white, safe or dangerous, etc.

The same conceptualization is used on a larger scale; take nationalism or continents for example. Africa and Europe are not divided by physical features such as bodies of water or "real" borders. Instead they are divided among Geo-political borders that are impacted by cultural beliefs, social practices and overall homogeneity. Although these borders are created through personal whim the consequences of there actions on other place's are very real. For example, the impacts that imperialism and colonization had on the land and life-style of Natives.

== Functions of place ==
A place stabilizes social life and gives durability to social structures, creates [[Social stratification|social hierarchies]] and [[social network|network]]s as well as solidarity among its members through frequent face to face interactions, cultural norms, shared identities, memories and values.

However, there are two arguments made when creating community of place: engagement and estrangement. 
* Engagement: Sophistication, diversity, tolerance, public participation, integration, network formation, freedom and civil negotiation.  
* Estrangement: Anonymity, detachment, privatization, formal social controls, individualism, disconnection, isolation, lack of community or solidarity.

=== Stratification ===
Social arenas that are inviting and successfully make visitors feel comfortable – like, but not limited to, parks, libraries, and plazas – help to reinforce engagement among community members. These social arenas bring together a variety of different people and allow them to communicate, experience and learn differences of one another. Just as structures can be built to reinforce solidarity and engagement, the construction of social arenas can as well develop estrangement. Take neighborhoods that are closed off by gates or are further in distance from city centers, where access is limited by travelling at high speeds to and from in a private vehicle. Invisible barriers such as price of property and proximity to stores, workplaces and civic centers work as well as agents of social stratification – usually based on things such as race, ethnicity and/or gender.

=== Collective action ===
Place can work as a catalyst for [[collective action]] – social movements, protests, formation of labor unions, etc. As stated before, the solidarity that is created among individuals, the shared experiences and loyalty to members help with the formation of these movements. Researchers and their efforts have seen this phenomenon occur across multiple social movements and have dissected it so much so, they have pinpointed how proximity and solidarity has effected the response of collective action. The revolt of peasants in the Ottoman Empire during the seventeenth century is a good example of proximity and its effects of cohesion. Villages that were further from centers of political power were more likely to rally than elitist or people that were so far they were essentially isolated from political centers.

Loyalty, sentimental and emotional bonds are created between people as place brings them together. The attachment begins through biographical experiences: traumatic, fulfilling, even secret events that happen to individuals personally at that place. Other research explain that attachment is developed through proximity and shared cultural process like living in the same building and emotional meanings of hanging out and having a good time in a local coffee shop. Place attachment creates a sense of security and well-being as well as identifying oneself to a group and memories.

=== Norms ===
Place inscribes [[cultural norm]]s, [[Ethics|ethical]] beliefs and values in its members as well as shapes ideology around what is considered deviant or criminal behavior. There are debates on whether crime rates are affected by environment, demographic or economic variables.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

'''Computing with Memory''' refers to computing platforms where function response is stored in memory array, either one or two-dimensional, in the form of [[lookup table]]s (LUTs) and functions are evaluated by retrieving the values from the LUTs. These computing platforms can follow either a purely spatial computing model, as in [[field-programmable gate array]] (FPGA), or a temporal computing model, where a function is evaluated across multiple clock cycles. The latter approach aims at reducing the overhead of programmable interconnect in FPGA by folding interconnect resources inside a computing element. It uses dense two-dimensional memory arrays to store large multiple-input multiple-output LUTs. Computing with Memory differs from Computing in Memory or [[processor-in-memory]] (PIM) concepts, widely investigated in the context of integrating a processor and memory on the same chip to reduce memory latency and increase bandwidth. These architectures seek to reduce the distance the data travels between the processor and the memory. The [[Berkeley IRAM project]] is one notable contribution in the area of PIM architectures.

Computing with memory platforms are typically used to provide the benefit of hardware reconfigurability.  Reconfigurable computing platforms offer advantages in terms of reduced design cost, early time-to-market, rapid prototyping and easily customizable hardware systems. FPGAs present a popular reconfigurable computing platform for implementing digital circuits. They follow a purely spatial computing model. Since their inception in 1985, the basic structure of the FPGAs has continued to consist of two-dimensional array of Configurable Logic blocks (CLBs) and a programmable interconnect matrix.&lt;ref name="Ref 1"&gt;K.Compton and S. Hauck, "Computing: A Survey of systems and software", ''ACM Surveys'', Vol. 34, No. 2, June, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; FPGA performance and power dissipation is largely dominated by the elaborate programmable interconnect (PI) architecture.&lt;ref name="Ref 2"&gt;S. M. Trimberger, ''Field Programmable Gate Array Technology'', Norwell, MA: Kluwer, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref 3"&gt;A. Rahman, S. Das, A. P. Chandrakasan, R. Reif, "Wiring Requirement and Three-Dimensional Integration Technology for Field Programmable Gate Arrays", ''IEEE Trans. on Very Large Scale Integration Systems'', Vol. 11, No. 1, February, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; An effective way of reducing the impact of the PI architecture in FPGA is to place small LUTs in close proximity (referred as clusters) and to allow intra-cluster communication using local interconnects. Due to the benefits of a clustered FPGA architecture, major FPGA vendors have incorporated it in their commercial products.&lt;ref name="Ref 4"&gt;[http://www.xilinx.com Xilinx Corporation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref 5"&gt;[http://www.altera.com Altera Corporation]&lt;/ref&gt; Investigations have also been made to reduce the overhead due to PI in fine-grained FPGAs by mapping larger multi-input multi-output LUTs to embedded memory blocks. Although it follows a similar spatial computing model, part of the logic functions are implemented using embedded memory blocks while the remaining part is realized using smaller LUTs.&lt;ref name="Ref 6"&gt;J. Cong and S. Xu, "Technology Mapping for FPGAs with Embedded Memory Blocks", Symposium on Field Programmable Gate Array, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a heterogeneous mapping can improve the area and performance by reducing the contribution of programmable interconnects.

Contrary to the purely spatial computing model of FPGA, a reconfigurable computing platform that employs a temporal computing model (or a combination of both temporal and spatial) has also been investigated &lt;ref name="Ref 7"&gt;S. Paul and S. Bhunia, "Reconfigurable Computing Using Content Addressable Memory for Improved Performance and Resource Usage", Design Automation Conference, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref 8"&gt;S. Paul, S. Chatterjee, S. Mukhopadhyay and S. Bhunia, "Nanoscale Reconfigurable Computing Using Non-Volatile 2-D STTRAM Array", International Conference on Nanotechnology, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; in the context of improving performance and energy over conventional FPGA. These platforms, referred as Memory Based Computing (MBC), use dense two-dimensional memory array to store the LUTs. Such frameworks rely on breaking a complex function (''f'') into small sub-functions; representing the sub-functions as multi-input, multi-output LUTs in the memory array; and evaluating the function ''f'' over multiple cycles.  MBC can leverage on the high density, low power and high performance advantages of nanoscale memory.&lt;ref name="Ref 8"/&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[:Image:Memory Logic Block.png]]  shows the high-level block diagram of MBC. --&gt;
Each computing element incorporates a two-dimensional memory array for storing LUTs, a small controller for sequencing evaluation of sub-functions and a set of temporary registers to hold the intermediate outputs from individual partitions. A fast, local routing framework inside each computing block generates the address for LUT access. Multiple such computing elements can be spatially connected using FPGA-like programmable interconnect architecture to enable mapping of large functions. The local time-multiplexed execution inside the computing elements can drastically reduce the requirement of programmable interconnects leading to large improvement in energy-delay product and better scalability of performance across technology generations.  The memory array inside each computing element can be realized by [[content-addressable memory]] (CAM) to drastically reduce the memory requirement for certain applications.&lt;ref name="Ref 7"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19209">[[File:QtubIronPillar.JPG|thumb|alt=An pillar, slightly fluted, with some ornamentation at its top. It is black, slightly weathered to a dark brown near the base. It is around 7 meters (22 feet) tall. It stands upon a raised circular base of stone, and is surrounded by a short, square fence.|The [[iron pillar of Delhi]] is an example of the iron extraction and processing methodologies of [[India]]. It has withstood corrosion for the last 1600 years.]]The '''conservation and restoration of iron and steel objects''' is an activity dedicated to the preservation and protection of objects of historical and personal value made from [[iron]] or [[steel]]. When applied to [[cultural heritage]] this activity is generally undertaken by a [[conservator-restorer]].

Historically, objects made from iron or steel were created for religious, artistic, technical, military and domestic uses. The act of [[conservation and restoration]] strives to prevent and slow the deterioration of the object as well as protecting the object for future use. The prevention and removal of surface dirt and corrosion products are the primary concerns of conservator-restorers when dealing with iron or steel objects, including nickel-iron meteorites.

==Conservation==
Systematic and well-managed documentation is today an essential prerequisite for quality executed conservation and restoration treatments, including  documentation of the state of objects before, during and after treatment. Identification of  materials and procedures used to produce objects and the results of any scientific research  must be part of documentation, too. Last but not least, an integral part of the documentation must be a recommendation for further care of object.

===Identification of metals and alloys===
*Simple methods - visual examination,spot tests,specific gravity
*Scientific methods - [[X-ray fluorescence|XRF]], [[X-ray crystallography|XRD]], [[Particle-induced X-ray emission]], [[LIBS]], [[Scanning electron microscope|SEM]], electrochemical techniques, [[metallography]]

===Identification of corrosion processes and products===
*Simple method - visual examination, spot tests
*[[Oddy test|The Oddy test]] - for copper, silver, and lead
*Scientific methods - xrd, SEM, metallography

===Identification of materials associated with metals===
*Simple methods - visual examination, spot tests, specific gravity
*Scientific  methods - xrf, [[chromatography]]

===Identification of technology used to  produce objects===
*Simple  methods - visual examination
*Scientific methods - metallography, [[x-ray radiography]], [[x-ray computed tomography]]

===Decision making===
In preparing the strategy  of the metals conservation project   interdisciplinary approach to the same is essential.It implies the participation of as many experts as is possible, as a minimum, we can take curator (archaeologist, historian, art historian), scientists specialized for corrosion of metallic objects of cultural heritage and the conservator - restorer.

===Cleaning===
Painted objects must be cleaned with polar/non polar solvents or solvent mixtures.

===Structural consolidation===
Screws, rivets, gluing, soldering, welding may be used to conserve the structure.

===Protective coatings===
*Clearcoats - [[Paraloid B-72]] - Permalac - Ormocer
*Waxes - [[Renaissance Wax]] - Cosmolloid 80 H - Dinitrol 4010 - Poligen ES 91009
*Oils - [[Ballistol]] - [[WD-40]] - 8 parts white spirit/2 parts fish oil
*Combinations - basecoat Paraloid B 72 + topcoat Renaissance wax etc.

===Archaeology objects===

====Cleaning====
Only mechanical cleaning can be used(scalpel,micromotor and steel brushes and abrasive discs,microsandblasting unit,ultrasonic chisel).

====Structural consolidation====
Gluing only can be  used,reversible types are the Best.
Glass fibre  reinforcments can be  used too.

====Stabilization====

* Combinations - basecoat Paraloid B 72 + topcoat Renaissance wax etc.

==Preventive conservation==
The items should be stored in rooms that are protected from polluted air, dust, ultraviolet radiation, and excessive relative humidity - ideal values are temperature of 16-20&amp;nbsp;°C and up to 40%(35-55% according to recent Canadian Conservation Institute recommendations) relative humidity, noting that if metal is combined with organic materials, relative humidity should not be below 45%. Archaeological objects must be stored in rooms (or plastic boxes)with very low relative humidity, or in the case of particularly valuable items in the chambers with nitrogen or argon. Iron objects with active corrosion up to 12-15% RH. Shelves in the storerooms must be of stainless steel or chlorine and acetate free plastic or powder coated steel. Wood and wood based products(Particle board, plywood) must be avoided. Also do not use rubber, felt or wool .When you are handling metal objects,always wear clean cotton gloves . Lighting levels must be kept below 300 lux (up to 150 lux in case of lacquered or painted objects,up to 50 lux in case of objects with light sensitive materials) [54]

{{About|the composition of the text of the Bible|the events described in the Hebrew Bible|Chronology of the Bible|the events in the Gospels|Chronology of Jesus}}
The four tables give the most commonly accepted dates or ranges of dates for the [[Old Testament]]/[[Hebrew Bible]], the [[Deuterocanonical books]] (included in [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] bibles, but not in the Hebrew and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] bibles) and the [[New Testament]], including, where possible, hypotheses about their formation-history.

Table I is a chronological overview. Table II treats the Old Testament/Hebrew Bible books, grouped according to the divisions of the Hebrew Bible with occasional reference to scholarly divisions. Table III gives the Deuterocanonical books. Table IV gives the books of the New Testament, including the earliest preserved fragments for each. The tables are in chronological order in reference to how they read in the Bible.

==Table I: Chronological overview==
This table summarises the chronology of the main tables and serves as a guide to the historical periods mentioned. Much of the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament may have been assembled in the 5th century BCE.{{sfn|Berquist|2007|p=3–4}} The New Testament books were composed largely in the second half of the 1st century CE.{{sfn|Perkins|2012|p=19ff.}} The [[Deuterocanonical books]] fall largely in between.

|[[Book of Genesis]]&lt;br&gt;[[Book of Exodus]]&lt;br&gt;[[Book of Leviticus]]&lt;br&gt;[[Book of Numbers]]&lt;br/&gt;[[Book of Deuteronomy]]
|The majority of modern biblical scholars believe that the [[Torah]] – the books of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy – reached its present form in the [[Second Temple Judaism|post-Exilic period]].{{sfn|Enns|2012|p=5}} 

The five books are drawn from four "sources" (distinct schools of writers rather than individuals): the [[Priestly source]], the [[Yahwist]] and the [[Elohist]] (these two are often referred to collectively as the "non-Priestly" source), and the [[Deuteronomist]].{{sfn|Carr|2000|p=492}} There is general agreement that the Priestly source is post-exilic, but there is no agreement over the non-Priestly source(s).{{sfn|Carr|2000|p=492}}

* Genesis is a post-exilic work combining "Priestly" and "non-Priestly" material.{{sfn|Carr|2007|p=10}}
* Exodus is an anthology drawn from nearly all periods of Israel's history.{{sfn|Dozeman|2000|p=443}}
* Leviticus is entirely Priestly and dates from the exilic/post-exilic period.{{sfn|Houston|2003|p=102}}
* Numbers is a Priestly redaction (i.e., editing) of a [[Yahwist]]ic/non-Priestly original.{{sfn|McDermott|2002|p=21}}
* Deuteronomy, now the last book of the Torah, began as the set of religious laws (these make up the bulk of the book), was extended in the early part of the 6th century to serve as the introduction to the [[Deuteronomistic history]], and later still was detached from that history, extended yet again, and edited to conclude the Torah.{{sfn|Van Seters|2004|p=93}}

|This group of books, plus Deuteronomy, is called the "[[Deuteronomistic history]]" by scholars. The proposal that they made up a unified work was first advanced by [[Martin Noth]] in 1943, and has been widely accepted. Noth proposed that the entire history was the creation of a single individual working in the exilic period (6th century BCE); since then there has been wide recognition that the history appeared in two "editions", the first in the reign of Judah's [[King Josiah]] (late 7th century), the second during the exile (6th century).{{sfn|Campbell|O'Brien|2000|p=2 and fn.6}} Noth's dating was based on the assumption that the history was completed very soon after its last recorded event, the release of King [[Jehoiachin]] in Babylon c. 560 BCE; but some scholars have termed his reasoning inadequate, and the history may have been further extended in the post-exilic period.{{sfn|Person|2010|p=10-11}}

|Three Major Prophets: 
[[Book of Isaiah#Composition|Book of Isaiah]]&lt;br&gt;[[Book of Jeremiah#Composition|Book of Jeremiah]]&lt;br&gt;[[Book of Ezekiel]]
|Scholars recognise three "sections" in the [[Book of Isaiah]]: Proto-Isaiah (the original 8th century Isaiah); Deutero-Isaiah (an anonymous prophet living in Babylon during the exile); and Trito-Isaiah (an anonymous author or authors in Jerusalem immediately after the exile).{{sfn|Sweeney|1998|p=76-77}}

The [[Book of Jeremiah]] exists in two versions, Greek (the version used in Orthodox Christian Bibles) and Hebrew (Jewish, Catholic and Protestant Bibles), with the Greek representing the earlier version.{{sfn|Allen|2008|p=7-8}} The Greek version was probably finalised in the early Persian period and translated into Greek in the 3rd century BCE, and the Hebrew version dates from some point between then and the 2nd century BCE.{{sfn|Sweeney|2010|p=94}}

The [[Book of Ezekiel]] describes itself as the words of the [[Ezekiel]] ben-Buzi, a priest living in exile in the city of [[Babylon]], and internal evidence dates the visions to between 593 and 571 BCE. While the book probably reflects much of the historic Ezekiel, it is the product of a long and complex history, with significant additions by a "school" of later followers.{{sfn|Blenkinsopp|1996|p=8}}{{sfn|Joyce|2009|p=16}}

| [[Gospel of Matthew]]
| 80–90 CE.{{sfn|Duling|2010|p=298-299}} This is based on three strands of evidence: (a) the setting of Matthew reflects the final separation of Church and Synagogue, about 85 CE; (b) it reflects the capture of Jerusalem and destruction of the Temple by the Romans in 70 CE; (c) it uses Mark, usually dated around 70 CE, as a source.{{sfn|France|2007|p=18}}

| {{Papyrus link|4}}, {{Papyrus link|75}} (175–250 CE)
|-
| [[Gospel of John]]
| 90–110 CE, the upper date based on textual evidence that the gospel was known in the early 2nd century, and the lower on an internal reference to the expulsion of Christians from the synagogues.{{sfn|Lincoln|2005|p=18}}
| {{Papyrus link|52}} (125–160 CE)
|-
| [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]]
| 80-90 CE, on the grounds that Luke-Acts uses Mark as a source, looks back on the destruction of Jerusalem, and does not show any awareness of the letters of Paul (which began circulating late in the century); if, however, it does show awareness of the letters of Paul and also of the works of Josephus, then a date early in the 2nd century is more likely.{{sfn|Boring|2012|p=587}}{{sfn|Keener|2012|p=384}}{{sfn|Powell|2018|p=210}}

|-
| [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]]
| c. 48 or 55 CE.{{sfn|Powell|2018|p=327}} One of the indisputably genuine Pauline letters.  The dating of this letter depends on whether it was written to the northern or southern portion of Galatia (with the former representing the later date). {{sfn|Powell|2018|p=326-327}}

| {{Papyrus link|46}} (late 2nd century or 3rd century CE)
|-
| [[Philippians]]
| c. 54–55 CE. A genuine Pauline letter, it mentions "Caesar's household," leading some scholars to believe that it is written from Rome, but some of the news in it could not have come from Rome. It seems rather to date from an earlier imprisonment, perhaps in Ephesus, from which Paul hopes to be released.{{sfn|Perkins|2012|p=19ff}}
| {{Papyrus link|46}} (late 2nd century or 3rd century CE)
|-
| [[Colossians]]
| c. 62–70 CE. Some scholars believe Colossians dates from Paul's imprisonment in Ephesus around 55 CE, but differences in the theology suggest that it comes from much later in his career, around the time of his imprisonment in Rome.{{sfn|Perkins|2012|p=19ff}}
| {{Papyrus link|46}} (late 2nd century or 3rd century CE)
|-
| [[1 Thessalonians]]
| c. 51 CE. One of the earliest of the genuine Pauline epistles.{{sfn|Perkins|2012|p=19ff}}
| {{Papyrus link|46}} (late 2nd century or 3rd century CE)
|-
| [[2 Thessalonians]]
| c. 51 CE or post-70 CE. If this is a genuine Pauline epistle it follows closely on 1 Thessalonians. But some of the language and theology point to a much later date, from an unknown author using Paul's name.{{sfn|Perkins|2012|p=19ff}}
| {{Papyrus link|92}} (300 CE)
|-
| [[1 Timothy]], [[2 Timothy]], [[Epistle to Titus]]

| [[Codex Sinaiticus]] (350 CE){{Papyrus link|32}} (200 CE)

| {{Papyrus link|87}} (3rd century CE)
|-
| [[Letter to the Hebrews|Hebrews]]
| c. 80–90 CE. The elegance of the Greek and the sophistication of the theology do not fit the genuine Pauline epistles, but the mention of Timothy in the conclusion led to its being included with the Pauline group from an early date.{{sfn|Perkins|2012|p=19ff}}
| {{Papyrus link|46}} (late 2nd century or 3rd century CE)
|-
| [[Epistle of James|James]]
| c. 65–85 CE. Like Hebrews, James is not so much a letter as an exhortation; the style of the Greek makes it unlikely that it was actually written by James the brother of Jesus.{{sfn|Perkins|2012|p=19ff}}

| [[Epistles of John]]

A '''digital conversation''' is a scripted dialogue (in other words it is dialogue written by a human, just like the script of a movie) which takes place between a person and a computer via any digital medium from [[web browsers]] and [[PDAs]] to [[mobile phones]] and [[Interactive television]].

==Introduction==
[[Image:MobileDigitalConvo.jpg|thumb|250px|right|An example of a digital conversation being run on a mobile device]]
A digital conversation is scripted by a human, uploaded to a [[Server (computing)|server]] where it can be accessed as a [[web service]] by other humans (consumers, employees etc.) and used to impart information to them, whether that information is advising them on the best [[camera]] to buy, helping them tailor make a [[credit card]] or engaging them in an interactive book.

A digital conversation can be undertaken simultaneously from multiple digital channels. In other words, no matter what means you are using to access a digital conversation by, whether it's a browser or a mobile phone, you are calling the same digital conversation. This means that any changes made to a digital conversation are reflected across all channels immediately. This allows digital conversations to evolve.

Rather than throwing content at consumers, digital conversations are designed to engage them in a scripted conversation, to find out what they want and guide them to the outcome they desire. It is this Dialogue Marketing that many perceive as being the way forward, and digital conversations provide a solution to delivering this at scale.&lt;ref name= dialogue&gt;{{cite web |last= McDowall |first= Bob |title= Dialogue Marketing: Part 2 - a solution |publisher= IT Analysis |url= http://www.it-analysis.com/business/content.php?cid=7991 |accessdate= 2008-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It moves away from a traditional one way stream of information with a consumers (offering every consumer the same choices) and moves towards a dialogue, finding out what it is they want and giving it to them. This movement is seen as essential by many:

{{quote|"''The past two years have witnessed the first examples of true two-way marketing conversations between customers and some of the world’s leading consumer brands. Driven by a confluence of innovation, competition and big shifts in consumer behaviour, the dialogue between brands and their customers is replacing the traditional marketing monologue''"|''The Future of Marketing: From Monologue to Dialogue
The Economist, September 2006&lt;ref name= economist&gt;{{Cite book | editor-last = An Economist Intelligence Unit white paper |title = The future of marketing From monologue to dialogue | year = 2006 | pages = 2 | publisher = The Economist | url = http://graphics.eiu.com/files/ad_pdfs/Google_Future_of_Marketing_060907.pdf|format=PDF | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|"''I think things are going to get infinitely more complex and the challenge is about taking things that are infinitely more complex and making them simpler and more understandable''."|Robert M. Greenberg, Head of [[R/GA]]&lt;ref name= madison&gt;{{Cite news |last= O'Brien |first= Timothy L. |title= Madison Avenue's 30-Second Spot Remover |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date= February 12, 2006 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/12/business/yourmoney/12adman.html?ex=1180670400&amp;en=6aa79cfc9a70f3ec&amp;ei=5070 |postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the same New York Times article Robert M. Greenberg then states that he wants to "engage (consumers) in digital conversations that are so entertaining, involving and valuable that they won't want to ignore them."&lt;ref name= madison/&gt; The key word here is "engage". digital conversations are created to be, in essence, human interactions and dialogue with one human removed. Unlike [[Chatterbot|Bots]] and [[Avatar (computing)|Avatar]]s, digital conversations are scripted, and this may well lead to more human like interactions.

==The digital conversation Bio-System==
Digital conversations consist of a four-stage "bio-system":

'''Create''' - Consisting of the preliminary creation and refining of the digital conversation including its [[front and back ends|front end]]

'''Interact''' - Whereby consumers engage with the digital conversation

'''Understand''' - The usage data of every consumer engaged with a Conversation is automatically stored and aggregated and can be viewed quickly and easily

'''Adapt''' - This usage data may lead to changes to the digital conversation which are reflected in real time across all channels (as the Conversation is called from one source no matter what the medium accessing it).

==Creation: Scripting a digital conversation==
[[Image:DigitalConvoScript.png|thumb|300px|left|A standard scripting canvas for a digital conversation, each symbol represents a question, note, link or outcome]]

Each digital conversation is made up of a [[dialogue]] based script consisting of a narrative and choices with pathways that lead to Outcomes. It is the user, through their choices, who decides which pathway to follow. The script takes the form of a [[Decision tree|Decision-Tree]] and is the backbone of the digital conversation. Each Decision-Tree defines two or more Pathways. The end point of a Pathway is an Outcome or a loosely coupled Link to another digital conversation enabling longer digital conversation flows.

By embracing the concepts of [[Web 2.0]] and allowing infinite numbers of digital conversations to be linked, this can allow hugely complex subjects to be tackled. One digital conversation written by an expert in Europe can be linked to an existing digital conversation written by an expert in Africa. This allows in theory, vast knowledge landscapes made up of components.&lt;ref name= terry&gt;{{cite web|last= Schurter |first= Terry |title= There really are new ways to approach old problems |publisher= IT Analysis |url= http://www.it-analysis.com/business/content.php?cid=8499 |accessdate= 2008-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A digital conversation can contain good dialogue or bad dialogue. Good dialogue typically means the aggregated interaction of each Dialogue-Step is undertaken in less than 5 seconds. This means a person can read and understand a Dialogue-Step after one read through and wants to continue to the next Dialogue-Step.

Bad dialogue has the opposite effect. Unclear language, for example, can cause confusion and have an adverse effect on a user, worst-case scenario is when a user leaves a digital conversation in despair. Luckily thanks to the available Metrics, such problems can be spotted quickly (numerous users exiting on one particular step indicates an issue with that step) and acted upon, with the dialogue changed as and when needed.

So, the development of a good digital conversation which will engage users requires a combination of skills in particular:

&gt;&gt; Two-way communication

&gt;&gt; [[Decision tree|Decision-tree logic]]

&gt;&gt; [[Behavioural economics]]

A digital conversation can be created for any scripted dialogue, thus it is suited for marketing, sales, support, practices, guides, policies, procedures and much more.

==Interaction==
Thanks to the nature of digital conversations (that they can be accessed across multiple channels from the same source) there are numerous ways to interact with them, whether by browser (see image to the left), mobile phone (see image above) or even through voice.

Due to the Web Service nature of digital conversations, the [[front end processor (program)|front ends]] designed to access them can be extremely diverse (see Links section for a number of examples) and thus are able to reflect [[brand]]ing needs or the needs of the user (for example large type for partially sighted users).

One of the exciting recent developments has been the use of digital conversations to drive Avatars.

===''Web 4.0 Avatar''===
One of the trends of recent years has been the humanising of digital channels, giving a face to things which are not human. This has led to the creation of [[Avatar (computing)|avatars]] (also known as [[Internet bot|bot]]s or [[Internet bot|chatter-bots]]) artificial intelligences with which users can “converse”. The success of such bots varies greatly, there are few which respond in a convincingly human way, it is no great mystery why they are commonly referred to as “Bots” often resulting in a stilted, mechanical interaction where straying off a recognized path can lead to poor responses . However, this has not stopped their spread across the commercial world with several high-profile companies adopting them as part of their customer services.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:DCAvatar.png|thumb|300px|right|A Web 2.0 Avatar in action]] --&gt;
Avatars such as [[IKEA]]'s Anna&lt;!--- this link no longer exists --[http://193.108.42.79/cgi-bin/IKEA_UK.cgi/]--&gt; have generated interest both in the business community and among the public. The idea of an artificial intelligence able to respond in an intelligent manner to your questions is indeed an exciting one. However, do these bots really manage it? Or are they just human faced Avatars disguising a search engine beneath?

Web 2.0 Avatars, powered by digital conversations, provide a level of immersion not found in these bots. Why? Because digital conversations are scripted just like any good book or film. And like books and films they are designed to guide a user, through high quality dialogue and interactions, to an outcome. Along with this, the ability to understand user interactions through DecisionMetrics means that these Web 2.0 Avatars can be adapted to emergent demands as they appear. The dialogue can be improved and built up as and when needed.

High quality dialogue, clear concise options for a user to choose and a humanized avatar all combine to create an immersive experience, with the psychological appeal of interacting with a character or object .

The key to immersion and believability is high quality dialogue, and it is high quality dialogue that digital conversations has been created for.

===''Business in the Virtual World''===
The digitlisation of business has been underway for years now, but the desire to do something more, to truly engage customers is growing stronger and stronger...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What We Can Learn from GE’s Digital Marketing Strategies |publisher=Kissmetrics |url=https://blog.kissmetrics.com/learn-from-ge-digital-marketing/ |accessdate=2017-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IBM]] have recently taken the initiative with this by creating a Virtual Business Centre in the Virtual World of [[Second Life]] which allows clients, partners and sales assistants to interact. It is areas like this that digital conversations might be put to use allowing users to interact with Avatars 24 hours a day 7 days a week.

==Understanding: Measurement and Metrics==
The automated recording of a digital conversation establishes the analytical science of interaction at scale. As a person interacts with a digital conversation Service each Dialogue-Step is recorded verbatim with a date and time step. Anonymous recording of consumers usage provides aggregated emergent patterns without infringing [[information privacy|data privacy]].

This measurement, providing the aggregated performance of each Dialogue-Step, Pathway and Outcome provides the scientific basis for Demand-Sensing allowing behavioral data to become quantifiable.

==Adaptation: Evolving Dialogue==
Once the usage data has been viewed and understood it may well be necessary to react by changing or amending the digital conversation.

{{wiktionary|durability}}
'''Durability''' is the ability of a physical [[product (business)|product]] to remain functional, without requiring excessive [[maintenance (technical)|maintenance]] or repair, when faced with the challenges of normal operation over its [[design life|design lifetime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Tim|year=1994|title=Beyond Recycling: The longer life option|url=http://irep.ntu.ac.uk/id/eprint/24666/1/201125_7266%20Cooper%20Publisher.pdf|journal=The New Economics Foundation, Whitechapel Road, London|volume=|pages=5|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}} Several units may be used to measure the durability of a product according to its field of application, such as years of life, hours of use, and operational cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Longer Lasting Products: alternatives to the throwaway society|last=Stahel|first=Walter|publisher=Gower|year=2010|isbn=978-0-566-08808-7|editor-last=Cooper|editor-first=Tim|location=Farnham|pages=|chapter=Durability, Function and Performance|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[economics]], good with a long usable life are referred to as [[durable good]]s.

== Requirements for product durability ==
Product durability is predicated by good reparability and [[Regenerative design|regenerability]] in conjunction with [[Maintenance (technical)|maintenance]].&lt;ref name="durabilityBook"&gt;{{Cite book|author=J. Lienig|author2=H. Bruemmer|title=Fundamentals of Electronic Systems Design|url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-319-55840-0|pp=201–203|chapter=New Design Strategy – Product Durability|publisher=Springer International Publishing|date=2017|isbn=978-3-319-55839-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every durable product must be capable of adapting to technical, technological and design developments.&lt;ref name=durabilityBook/&gt; This must be accompanied by a willingness on the part of consumers to forego having the "very latest" version of a product.

Durability as a characteristic relating to the quality of goods that can be demanded by consumers was not clearly established in the United Kingdom until an amendment of the [[Sale of Goods Act 1979]]  relating to the quality standards for supplied goods in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Longer Lasting Products: alternatives to the throwaway society|last=Ervine|first=Cowan|publisher=Gower|year=2010|isbn=978-0-566-08808-7|editor-last=Cooper|editor-first=Tim|location=Farnham|pages=187-188|chapter=Durability and the Law|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Product life spans and sustainable consumption ==
The lifespan of household goods is a significant factor in [[sustainable consumption]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Tim|year=1994|title=The durability of consumer durables|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bse.3280030103/full|journal=Business Strategy and the Environment|volume=3|issue=1|pages=23–30|via=Willey|doi=10.1002/bse.3280030103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Longer product life spans can contribute to eco-efficiency and sufficiency, thus slowing consumption in order to progress towards a sustainable level of consumption.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Tim|year=2005|title=Slower Consumption Reflections on Product Life Spans and the "Throwaway Society"|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1162/1088198054084671/abstract|journal=Journal of Industrial Ecology|volume=9|issue=1–2|pages=51–67|via=Willey|doi=10.1162/1088198054084671}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper (2005) proposed a model to demonstrate the crucial role of product life spans to sustainable production and consumption.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Types of durability==
Durability can encompass several specific physical properties of designed products, including:

*[[Dust#Control of dust resistance on surfaces|Dust resistance]]
*Resistance to [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]]
*[[Fireproofing|Fire resistance]]
*[[Radiation hardening]]
*[[Residual stress|Thermal resistance]]
*[[Rot-proof]]ing
*[[Rustproof]]ing
*[[Toughness]]
*[[Waterproofing]]

{{lowercase|eSTAR}}
The '''eSTAR project''' was a [[multi-agent system]] that aims to implement a true heterogeneous network of [[robotic telescope]]s for automated observing. The project is a joint collaboration between the Astrophysics Group of the [[University of Exeter]] and the Astrophysics Research Institute at [[Liverpool John Moores University]].

In 2006 work began on an autonomous [[software agent]] for observations of [[variable stars]]. This agent implements the optimal sampling technique of Saunders et al. (2006) and the prototype was successfully tested on the RoboNet network of telescopes which includes: the [[Liverpool Telescope]], the [[Faulkes Telescope North]] and the [[Faulkes Telescope South]].

eSTAR is affiliated with the RoboNet Consortium and the global Heterogeneous Telescope Networks Consortium.

As of 2007 eSTAR is "live" supporting two real-time observing projects. Automated follow-up observations of [[gamma-ray burst]]s are performed using the 3.8m [[UKIRT]] telescope situated in [[Hawaii|Hawai'i]], making this telescope the largest in the world{{Clarify|date=July 2010|needs explanation - see talk page}}, with an automated response system for tracking such events.

eSTAR is also involved in the search for [[extra-solar planets]] by placing observations on the [[RoboNet]] system of telescopes on behalf of the [[Probing Lensing Anomalies Network|PLANET]] collaboration. The technique of [[gravitational microlensing]] is used to monitor large numbers of stars in the galactic bulge looking for the tell-tale signature of cool planets orbiting those stars.{{Clarify|date=July 2010|needs explanation - see talk page}}

'''Easily confused Buddhist representations''' are images or statues that may resemble the mortal, historical Buddha known as [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhārtha Gautama]], Śākyamuni, or [[Tathāgata]] (or others), but were actually created to represent other individuals.

Depictions could be Gautama, or a bodhisattva, guardian, protector, disciple, or saint. Clues to a figure's identity are found in, for example, the [[physical characteristics of the Buddha]], the objects the figure is holding, its ''[[mudra]]'' (hand gesture), and ''[[asana]]'' (sitting or standing position of the body).&lt;ref name="Sjoquist"&gt;Sjoquist&lt;/ref&gt; There may be an image in the figure's [[crown (headgear)|crown]],&lt;ref&gt;Sakya, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; or the figure could be holding a book, thunderbolt, vase, jewel, or lotus flower or stem.&lt;ref&gt;Sakya, various.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mandala]]s created for [[Shingon Buddhism|Japanese Shingon Buddhism]] and [[Tibetan Buddhism]] can contain hundreds of different figures that may need [[Womb Realm#Womb Realm map|interpretation]].&lt;ref name="Sjoquist"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exploring the Mandala|url=http://www.graphics.cornell.edu/online/mandala/|publisher=Cornell University Program of Computer Graphics|accessdate=January 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his paper on the ''mudrās'' of [[bodhisattva]]s, Carl B. Becker, [[Kyoto University]] professor, describes the situation:

{{quote|When the uninitiated observer first confronts the Buddhist pantheon [of Japan], his reaction may border on bewilderment or dismay. Far from the ascetic agnosticism taught by Gautama, Buddha-like deities are available to answer every material or spiritual need. They wear regal robes or deerskins; they sit, stand, or fly; they have their own ''sūtras'', temples, and guardians....&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Hands of the Bodhisattva The Standardization of Mudrās in Japanese Buddhist Sculpture Prior to A.D. 1200|author=Becker, Carl B.|journal=East and West|volume=43|issue=1/4|date=December 1993|pages= 199–232|publisher=Istituto Italiano per l'Africa e l'Oriente [IsIAO]|jstor=29757091}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Dhyani Buddhas==
{{main|Five Dhyani Buddhas}}
Representations of the [[five Dhyani Buddhas]], who are abstract aspects of [[Buddhahood]] rather than Buddhas or gods, have elaborate differences.&lt;ref&gt;Sakya, pp. 35, 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Each must face in a different direction (north, south, east, west, or center), and, when painted, each is a different color (blue, yellow, red, green, or white). Each has a different ''mudrā'' and symbol; embodies a different aspect, type of evil, and cosmic element; has a different consort and spiritual son, as well as different animal vehicles (elephant, lion, peacock, harpys or [[garuda]], or dragon).&lt;ref name="Sakya, p. 76"&gt;Sakya, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vairocana]], the first Dhyani Buddha, embodying [[sovereignty]] and occupying the center,&lt;ref name="Sakya, p. 76"/&gt; is a special case (in any case, he is distinct from Gautama and not normally confused with him). He was one of the [[Buddhas of Bamiyan]] blown up by the [[Taliban]] which China mourned and tried to replace with the [[List of statues by height|world's tallest statue]], named [[Spring Temple Buddha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=China enters biggest Buddhist statue race|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/monitoring/media_reports/1315785.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=March 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese [[Pure Land Buddhism|Pure Land Buddhists]] think that Vairocana and the other Dhyani Buddhas are manifestations of [[Amitābha]], but Japanese Shingon Buddhists think that Amitābha and the other Dhyani Buddhas are manifestations of Vairocana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Getty, Alice|title=The gods of northern Buddhism: their history, iconography and progressive evolution through the northern Buddhist countries|year=1914|publisher=Oxford Clarendon Press via Internet Archive|page=3|url=https://archive.org/stream/northernbuddhism00gettuoft#page/n73/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
[[File:Apollo15LunarRover.jpg|thumb|[[NASA]]'s [[Lunar Roving Vehicle]]s were battery-driven]]

Electric cars are a variety of [[electric vehicle]] (EV). The term "electric vehicle" refers to any vehicle that uses electric motors for propulsion, while "electric car" generally refers to highway-capable [[automobiles]] powered by electricity. [[Low-speed vehicle|Low-speed]] electric vehicles, classified as [[neighborhood electric vehicle]]s (NEVs) in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/cars/rules/rulings/lsv/lsv.html|title=US DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 49 CFR Part 571 Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards |accessdate=2009-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as electric [[motorised quadricycle]]s in Europe,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/sectors/automotive/files/cit-sum-com-542_en.pdfCitizens' summary EU proposal for a Regulation on L-category vehicles (two- or three-wheel vehicles and quadricycles)]{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; are plug-in electric-powered [[microcar]]s or [[city car]]s with limitations in terms of weight, power and maximum speed that are allowed to travel on public roads and city streets up to a certain posted speed limit, which varies by country.

While an electric car's power source is not explicitly an on-board battery, electric cars with motors powered by other energy sources are typically referred to by a different name. An electric car carrying [[solar panel]]s to power it is a [[solar car]], and an electric car powered by a gasoline generator is a form of [[hybrid car]]. Thus, an electric car that derives its power from an on-board battery pack is a form of [[battery electric vehicle]] (BEV). Most often, the term "electric car" is used to refer to [[battery electric vehicles]], but may also refer to [[plug-in hybrid electric vehicles]] (PHEV).

In 1897, electric cars found their first commercial use in the US. Based on the design of the [[Electrobat|Electrobat II]], a fleet of twelve hansom cabs and one brougham were used in New York City as part of a project funded in part by the Electric Storage Battery Company of Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edisontechcenter.org/ElectricCars.html |title=History of Electric Cars |first=Galen |last=Handy |publisher=The Edison Tech Center |location=US |year=2014 |access-date=2017-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 20th century, the main manufacturers of electric vehicles in the US were Anthony Electric, Baker, Columbia, Anderson, Edison, Riker, Milburn, [[S.R. Bailey &amp; Co.|Bailey Electric]] and others. Unlike gasoline-powered vehicles, the electric ones were less noisy, and did not require gear changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.automobilesreview.com/auto-news/some-facts-about-electric-vehicles/42240/ |title=Some Facts About Electric Vehicles |date=2012-02-25 |access-date=2017-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=June 2018}}

Advances in [[internal combustion engine]]s (ICE) in the first decade of the 20th century lessened the relative advantages of the electric car. Their much quicker refueling times, and cheaper production costs, made them more popular. However, a decisive moment was the introduction in 1912 of the electric [[Starter (engine)|starter motor]] which replaced other, often laborious, methods of starting the ICE, such as [[Crank (mechanism)#20th Century|hand-cranking]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Six electric cars held the [[land speed record]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.macscouter.com/CubScouts/PowWow07/SCCC_2007/CubScoutThemes/Jan_2008.pdf|date=January 2008|title=Cub Scout Car Show|accessdate=2009-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last of them was the rocket-shaped [[La Jamais Contente]], driven by [[Camille Jenatzy]], which broke the {{convert|100|km/h|abbr=on}} speed barrier by reaching a top speed of {{convert|105.88|km/h|abbr=on}} on 29 April 1899.

In the early 1990s, the [[California Air Resources Board]] (CARB) began a push for more fuel-efficient, lower-emissions vehicles, with the ultimate goal being a move to [[zero-emissions vehicle]]s such as electric vehicles.&lt;ref name=TwoBillion&gt;{{cite book |last=Sperling |first=Daniel |first2=Deborah |last2=Gordon |title = Two billion cars: driving toward sustainability |year=2009| pages=22–26 |publisher=Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-537664-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Boschert06&gt;{{cite book |first=Sherry |last=Boschert |title=Plug-in Hybrids: The Cars that will Recharge America |year=2006 |pages=15–28 |publisher=New Society Publishers| isbn=978-0-86571-571-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, automakers developed electric models, including the [[Chrysler TEVan]], [[Ford Ranger EV]] pickup truck, [[GM EV1]], and [[Chevrolet S10 EV|S10 EV]] pickup, [[Honda EV Plus]] hatchback, Nissan [[Nissan Altra|Altra EV]] miniwagon, and [[Toyota RAV4 EV]]. Both US Electricar and [[Solectria Force|Solectria]] produced 3-phase AC Geo-bodied electric cars with the support of GM, Hughes, and Delco. These early cars were eventually withdrawn from the U.S. market.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Who Killed the Electric Car?]]'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Electric motors can provide high [[power-to-weight ratio]]s, batteries can be designed to supply the currents needed to support these motors. Electric motors have flat torque curve down to zero speed. For simplicity and reliability, many electric cars use fixed-ratio gearboxes and have no clutch.

Many electric cars have motors that have high acceleration, relative to comparable cars, however, [[Neighborhood Electric Vehicle]]s may have a low acceleration due to their relatively weak motors. This is largely due to the relatively constant torque of an electric motor, which often increase the acceleration relative to a similar [[horsepower|motor power]] internal combustion engine.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Electric vehicles can also use a direct motor-to-wheel configuration which increases the available [[power (physics)|power]].

==Energy efficiency==
{{main|Electric car energy efficiency}}

[[Internal combustion engine]]s have [[Carnot's theorem (thermodynamics)|thermodynamic limits]] on efficiency, expressed as fraction of energy used to propel the vehicle compared to energy produced by burning fuel. [[Gasoline engine]]s effectively use only 15% of the fuel energy content to move the vehicle or to power accessories, and [[diesel engine]]s can reach on-board efficiency of 20%, while electric vehicles have on-board efficiency of over 90%, when counted against stored chemical energy, or around 80%, when counted against required energy to recharge.&lt;ref name=PEVs2&gt;{{Cite book|title=Plug-In Electric Vehicles: What Role for Washington?|first=Saurin D. |last=Shah|year=2009 |publisher=The Brookings Institution|isbn=978-0-8157-0305-1 |edition=1st |chapter=2|pages=29, 37 and 43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Electric motor]]s are more efficient than internal combustion engines in converting stored energy into driving a vehicle. Electric cars can not idle. [[Regenerative braking]], which is most common in electric vehicles, can recover as much as one fifth of the energy normally lost during braking.&lt;ref name=TwoBillion/&gt;&lt;ref name=PEVs2/&gt;

Tesla Motors indicates that the vehicle efficiency (including charging inefficiencies) of their [[lithium-ion battery]] powered vehicle is 12.7&amp;nbsp;kW·h/100&amp;nbsp;km (0.21&amp;nbsp;kW·h/mi) and the well-to-wheels efficiency (if the electricity is generated from natural gas) is 24.4&amp;nbsp;kW·h/100&amp;nbsp;km (0.39&amp;nbsp;kW·h/mi).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teslamotors.com/goelectric/efficiency |publisher=Tesla Motors |title=Energy Efficiency of Tesla Electric Vehicles |accessdate=2009-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cabin heating and cooling===
While heating can be provided with an electric resistance heater, higher efficiency and integral cooling can be obtained with a reversible [[heat pump]]. [[Temperature coefficient#Positive temperature coefficient of resistance|PTC junction cooling]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |country-code=US |series-number=5889260 |title=Electrical PTC heating device |publication-date=30 March 1999 |editor1-last=Golan|editor1-first=Gad |editor2-last=Galperin|editor2-first=Yuly }}&lt;/ref&gt; is also attractive for its simplicity&amp;nbsp;— this kind of system is used, for example, in the [[Tesla Roadster (2008)]].

To avoid using part of the battery's energy for heating and thus reducing the range, some models allow the cabin to be heated while the car is plugged in. For example, the Nissan Leaf, the Mitsubishi i-MiEV and the Tesla Model S can be pre-heated while the vehicle is plugged in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=NativeEnergy |url=https://www.recyclebank.com/live-green/3-electric-car-myths-that-will-leave-you-out-in-the-cold |title=3 Electric Car Myths That Will Leave You Out in the Cold |publisher=Recyclebank |date=2012-09-07 |accessdate=2013-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ed |last=Piotrowski |url=http://cgdailydrive.com/how-i-survived-the-cold-weather/ |title=How i Survived the Cold Weather |publisher=The Daily Drive – Consumer Guide Automotive |date=2013-01-03 |accessdate=2013-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teslarati.com/effects-winter-tesla-battery-range/|title= Effects of Winter on Tesla Battery Range and Regen|work=teslarati.com|date=2014-11-24|accessdate=2015-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some electric cars, for example the [[Citroën Berlingo Electrique]], use an auxiliary heating system (for example [[gasoline]]-fueled units manufactured by Webasto or Eberspächer) but sacrifice "green" and "Zero emissions" credentials. Cabin cooling can be augmented with [[solar power]], or by automatically allowing outside air to flow through the car when parked. Two models of the 2010 Toyota Prius include this feature as an option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toyota.com/prius-hybrid/options.html |title=2010 Options and Packages |work=Toyota Prius |publisher=Toyota |accessdate=2009-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety==
[[File:V10084P006.jpg|thumb|Side impact test of a [[Tesla Model X]]]]

The safety issues of BEVs are largely dealt with by the international standard [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 6469. This document is divided in three parts dealing with specific issues:

* On-board electrical energy storage, i.e. the battery
* Functional safety means and protection against failures
* Protection of persons against electrical hazards.

In the United States, General Motors ran in several cities a training program for [[firefighter]]s and [[certified first responder|first responders]] to demonstrate how to safely disable the [[Chevrolet Volt]]’s powertrain and its 12 volt electrical system. The Volt's high-voltage system is designed to shut down automatically in the event of an airbag deployment, and to detect a loss of communication from an airbag control module.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://media.gm.com/content/media/us/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2011/Jan/0118_NFPA|title=Detroit First Responders Get Electric Vehicle Safety Training |author=General Motors|work=General Motors News|date=2011-01-19|accessdate=2011-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2010/08/gmfr-20100827.html|title= General Motors Kicks Off National Electric Vehicle Training Tour For First Responders|publisher=Green Car Congress |date=2010-08-27|accessdate=2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; GM also made available an Emergency Response Guide for the 2011 Volt for use by emergency responders.

===Vehicle safety===
The weight of the batteries themselves usually makes an EV heavier than a comparable gasoline vehicle, in a collision, the occupants of a heavy vehicle will on average, suffer fewer and less serious injuries than the occupants of a lighter vehicle; therefore, the additional weight brings safety benefits&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=National Research Council|author2=Transportation Research Board|author3=Division on Engineering and Physical Sciences|author4=Board on Energy and Environmental Systems|author5=Committee on the Effectiveness and Impact of Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) Standards|title=Effectiveness and Impact of Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) Standards|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yRybeDbz8R8C&amp;pg=PA71|year=2002|publisher=National Academies Press|isbn=978-0-309-07601-2|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite having a negative effect on the car's performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mehrdad Ehsani|author2=Yimin Gao|author3=Sebastien E.

===Hazard to pedestrians===
{{See also|Electric vehicle warning sounds}}
At low speeds, electric cars produced less [[roadway noise]] than vehicles propelled by internal combustion engines. Blind or [[visual impairment|visually impaired]] people consider the noise of combustion engines a helpful aid while crossing streets, hence electric cars and [[hybrid vehicle|hybrids]] could pose an unexpected hazard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/2007-10-03-2698183585_x.htm|title=Blind people: Hybrid cars pose hazard|publisher=[[USA Today]]|first=Ben|last=Nuckols |date=2007-03-03 |accessdate=2009-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Economist0509"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13606446|title=Electric cars and noise: The sound of silence|publisher=Economist|date=2009-05-07|accessdate=2009-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tests have shown that this is a valid concern, as vehicles operating in electric mode can be particularly hard to hear below {{convert|20|mph|-1|abbr=on}}, which affects all road users, not just the visually impaired. At higher speeds, the sound created by tire friction and the air displaced by the vehicle start to make sufficient audible noise.&lt;ref name="Economist0509"/&gt;

The [[Government of Japan]], the [[U.S. Congress]], and the [[European Parliament]] passed legislation to regulate the minimum level of sound for hybrids and [[plug-in electric vehicle]]s when operating in electric mode, so that blind people and other pedestrians and cyclists can hear them coming and detect from which direction they are approaching.&lt;ref name="Economist0509"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://detnews.com/article/20110104/AUTO01/101040430/Obama-signs-law-to-require-%E2%80%98quiet%E2%80%99-cars-to-get-noisier|title=Obama signs law to require 'quiet' cars to get noisier|work=[[The Detroit News]]|author=David Shepardson|date=2011-01-04|accessdate=2011-01-05}}{{dead link|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TMC0810&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.toyota.co.jp/en/news/10/08/0824.html|title=TMC to Sell Approaching Vehicle Audible System for 'Prius'|publisher=[[Toyota Motor Company]] News Release|date=2010-08-24|accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-14-363_en.htm|title=Commission welcomes Parliament vote on decreasing vehicle noise |author=European Commission Press Release|publisher=[[European Commission]]|date=2014-04-02|accessdate=2014-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nissan Leaf]] was the first electric car to use Nissan's [[Vehicle Sound for Pedestrians]] system, which includes one sound for forward motion and another for reverse.&lt;ref name=NYT0610B&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/17/blind-advocates-disappointed-in-nissan-e-v-sounds-for-pedestrians/?ref=automobiles|title=Blind Advocates ‘Disappointed’ in Nissan E.V.

Several anti-noise and electric car advocates have opposed the introduction of artificial sounds as warning for pedestrians, as such an introduction is based on vehicle type and not actual noise level, a concern regarding ICE vehicles which themselves are becoming quieter.

==Controls==
{{As of|2018}}, most Electric cars have similar driving controls to that of a car with a conventional [[automatic transmission]]. Even though the motor may be permanently connected to the wheels through a fixed-ratio gear and no [[parking pawl]] may be present the modes "P" and "N" are often still provided on the selector. In this case the motor is disabled in "N" and an electrically actuated [[hand brake]] provides the "P" mode.

In some cars the motor will spin slowly to provide a small amount of creep in "D", similar to a traditional automatic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autocar.co.uk/CarReviews/FirstDrives/Ford-Focus-BeV/245743/ |title=Ford Focus BEV – Road test |publisher=Autocar.co.uk |date=|accessdate=2011-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the foot is lifted from the accelerator of an [[internal combustion engine|ICE]], [[engine braking]] causes the car to slow. An EV would coast under these conditions, if it wasn't for [[Regenerative brake|regenerative braking]] which instead provides a more familiar response and recharges the battery to an extent. These features also reduce the use of the conventional brakes, significantly reducing wear and tear and maintenance costs as well as improving vehicle range.

==Batteries==
[[File:NASA Lithium Ion Polymer Battery.jpg|thumb|Prototypes of 50 watt-hour/kilogram [[lithium-ion polymer battery]]. Newer lithium-ion cells can provide up to 130&amp;nbsp;W·h/kg and last through thousands of charging cycles]]
{{Main|Electric vehicle battery}}
Lithium-based batteries are often chosen for their high power and energy density, although may wear out over a long period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/gadgets/how-to/a7432/why-your-gadgets-batteries-degrade-over-time-6705747/|title=Why Your Gadgets' Batteries Degrade|date=2012-04-25|work=Popular Mechanics|access-date=2018-09-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are many [[Electric battery#Solid state batteries|emergring technologies]] trying to combat this issue.

There are also other battery types, such as [[Nickel metal hydride battery|Nickel metal hydride (NiMH)]] batteries which have a poorer power to weight ratio than lithium ion, but are cheaper. Several other battery chemistries are in development such as [[zinc-air battery]] which could be much lighter.

Electric cars are typically charged overnight from a charging station installed in the owner's house, or from faster charging stations found in businesses and public areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2018/01/25/electric-vehicle-car-charging/1059349001/|title=Thinking of buying an electric vehicle? Here's what you need to know about charging|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-05-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An overnight charge of 8 hours will only give about a 40 mile charge with a standard 120 volt outlet whereas a 240 volt outlet would give around 180 miles in the same amount of time. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ucsusa.org/clean-vehicles/electric-vehicles/car-charging-time-type-cost#.XACNxGhKiUl|title=Electric Vehicle Charging: Types, Time, Cost and Savings|last=|first=|date=March 9, 2018|work=Union of Concerned Scientists|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within each major region of the world, electric car charging stations are essentially universal across car and charger brands, and simply plugging in a charger into an electric car will charge the car at the fastest rate that car and charger can support.  A notable exception are the [[Tesla Motors|Tesla]] line of cars and charging stations, which use their own proprietary chargers. However, this can be solved by using a converter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.autoblog.com/2017/01/19/diginow-super-charger-v2-tesla-ev/|title=Diginow Super Charger V2 opens up Tesla destination chargers to other EVs|work=Autoblog|access-date=2018-09-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some companies have been experimenting with [[battery swapping]] to eliminate delay while charging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.machinedesign.com/automotive/could-battery-swapping-ease-range-anxiety-ev-owners|title=Could Battery Swapping Ease Range Anxiety for EV Owners?|date=2016-07-19|work=Machine Design|access-date=2018-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Tesla charging station with solar collector trimmed.jpeg|thumb|Panoramic view of [[Tesla supercharger]] rapid charging station in [[Tejon, California|Tejon Ranch, California]] ]]

====Hybrid vehicles====
{{Further|Hybrid vehicle}}[[File:2018 BMW i3 facelift (1).jpg|thumb|The [[BMW i3]] has an optional gasoline-powered [[Range-extended vehicle|range extender]] engine]]

Some electric vehicles have built in generators, these are considered a type of [[hybrid vehicle]].

===Lifespan===
{{Main|rechargeable battery#Lifespan and cycle stability}}

As with all lithium-ion batteries, electric vehicle batteries may degrade over long periods of time, especially if they are frequently overcharged, however, this may take at least several years before being noticeable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://phys.org/news/2013-04-life-lithium-ion-batteries-electric.html|title=Understanding the life of lithium ion batteries in electric vehicles|access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Nissan stated in 2015 that thus far only 0.01 percent of batteries had to be replaced because of failures or problems, and then only because of externally inflicted damage. The vehicles that had already covered more than {{convert|200,000|km|0|abbr=on}}, have no problems with the battery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/mobilitaet/2015-04/elektroauto-batterie-akku-tesla-s/seite-2 „zeit.de: Batterie-Upgrade? Unwahrscheinlich!“]; retrieved, 22 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Extraction ===
Over half of the world's cobalt, a key element in lithium-ion batteries, is mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo where the children are forced to mine the cobalt while having little to no protection. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/child-labor-still-rife-in-democratic-republic-of-congo/a-39194724|title=Child labor still rife in Democratic Republic of Congo|last=Cascais|first=Antonio|date=November 6, 2017|website=DW.COM|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future===

;Autonomous park-and-charge

Volkswagen, in collaboration with six partners, is developing an EU research project that is focused on automating the parking and charging of electric vehicles. The objective of this project is to develop a smart car system that allows for autonomous driving in designated areas (e.g. valet parking, park and ride) and can offer advanced driver support in urban environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ori.ox.ac.uk/older-projects/vcharge/|title=VCharge|work=Oxford Robotics Institute|access-date=2018-03-06|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla has shown interest in making an arm that automatically charges their vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2015/08/06/teslas-prehensile-car-charger-plugs-itself-in-automatically/|title=Tesla's prehensile car charger plugs itself in automatically|work=Engadget|access-date=2018-05-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Other methods of energy storage
Experimental [[electric double-layer capacitor|supercapacitor]]s and [[flywheel energy storage]] devices offer comparable storage capacity, faster charging, and lower volatility. They have the potential to overtake batteries as the preferred rechargeable storage for EVs.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://discovermagazine.com/1996/aug/reinventingthewh842

;Solar cars
{{Main|Solar vehicle}}

Solar cars are electric vehicles powered completely or significantly by direct [[solar energy]], usually, through [[photovoltaic]] (PV) cells contained in [[solar panel]]s that convert the sun's energy directly into electric energy, usually used to charge a battery.

==Infrastructure==

===Charging station===

[[File:Eletroposto6.jpg|thumb|Charging station at [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]]. This station is run by [[Petrobras]] and uses [[solar energy]]]]
{{Main|charging station}}

[[Battery electric vehicle|Battery Electric Vehicles]] are most commonly charged from the [[power grid]] overnight at the owner's house, provided they have their own charging station. The electricity on the grid is in turn generated from a variety of sources; such as [[Fossil fuel power plant|coal]], [[hydroelectricity]], [[nuclear power|nuclear]] and others. Power sources such as [[photovoltaic]] solar cell panels, [[micro hydro]] or [[wind power|wind]] may also be used and are promoted because of concerns regarding [[global warming]].

Charging stations can have a variety of different speeds of charging, with slower charging being more common for houses, and more powerful charging stations on public roads and areas for trips.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity_infrastructure.html|title=Alternative Fuels Data Center: Developing Infrastructure to Charge Plug-In Electric Vehicles|website=www.afdc.energy.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[BMW i3]] can charge 0–80% of the battery in under 30 minutes in rapid charging mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Charging time for the BMW i3 |url=http://www.bmw.co.uk/en/new-vehicles/bmw-i/i3/2013/charging.html |publisher=BMW |location=UK |accessdate=2013-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921015553/http://www.bmw.co.uk/en/new-vehicles/bmw-i/i3/2013/charging.html |archivedate=2013-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The superchargers developed by Tesla Motors provided up to 130&amp;nbsp;kW of charging, allowing a 300-mile charge in about an hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cars.com/articles/2013/11/how-quickly-does-the-tesla-model-s-battery-charge/|title=How Quickly does the tesla model S battery charge?|last=Popely|first=Rick|date=November 9, 2013|website=Cars.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Connectors====
Most electric cars have used [[conductive coupling]] to supply electricity for recharging after the [[California Air Resources Board]] settled on the [[SAE J1772]]-2001 standard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arb.ca.gov/regact/charger/uid.pdf |title=Rulemaking:  2001-06-26 Updated and Informative Digest ZEV Infrastructure and Standardization |date=2002-05-13 |work=title 13, California Code of Regulations |publisher=California Air Resources Board |accessdate=2010-05-23|quote=Standardization of Charging Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the charging interface for electric vehicles in California in June 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=ARB Amends ZEV Rule: Standardizes Chargers &amp; Addresses Automaker Mergers |url=http://www.arb.ca.gov/newsrel/nr062801.htm |publisher=California Air Resources Board |date=2001-06-28 |accessdate=2010-05-23| quote=the ARB approved the staff proposal to select the conductive charging system used by Ford, Honda and several other manufacturers}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, the [[European Automobile Manufacturers Association|ACEA]] has decided to use the Type 2 connector from the range of [[IEC 62196#Plug types|IEC_62196 plug types]] for conductive charging of electric vehicles in the European Union, as the Type 1 connector (SAE J1772-2009) does not provide for three-phase charging.&lt;ref name="acea2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acea.be/images/uploads/files/20100630_Standardisation_e-vehicles.pdf |title=ACEA position and recommendations for the standardization of the charging of electrically chargeable vehicles |publisher=ACEA Brussels |date=2010-06-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706132407/http://www.acea.be/images/uploads/files/20100630_Standardisation_e-vehicles.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vehicle-to-grid: uploading and grid buffering===
{{Main|vehicle-to-grid}}

During [[peak load]] periods, when the cost of generation can be very high, electric vehicles could contribute energy to the grid.  These vehicles can then be recharged during [[off-peak]] hours at cheaper rates while helping to absorb excess night time generation. Here the batteries in the vehicles serve as a distributed storage system to buffer power.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

'''EnCase''' is the shared technology within a suite of digital investigations products by [[Guidance Software]]. The software comes in several products designed for [[forensic]], [[cyber security]], [[security analytics]], and [[e-discovery]] use. Encase is traditionally used in forensics to recover evidence from seized hard drives. Encase allows the investigator to conduct in depth analysis of user files to collect evidence such as documents, pictures, internet history and Windows Registry information.

The company also offers EnCase training and certification.

Data recovered by EnCase has been used in various court systems, such as in the cases of the [[Dennis_Rader#Arrest|BTK Killer]] and the [[murder of Danielle van Dam]].&lt;ref name="UK Court Usage"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, Jeff, and Steve Perez.

'''Enzyme assays''' are [[laboratory]] methods for measuring [[enzyme|enzymatic]] activity. They are vital for the study of [[enzyme kinetics]] and [[enzyme inhibitor|enzyme inhibition]].

==Enzyme units==

The quantity or concentration of an enzyme can be expressed in [[Mole (unit)|molar]] amounts, as with any other chemical, or in terms of activity in [[enzyme unit]]s.

===Enzyme activity===
Enzyme activity = moles of substrate converted per unit time = rate × reaction volume. Enzyme activity is a measure of the quantity of active enzyme present and is thus dependent on conditions, ''which should be specified''. The SI unit is the [[katal]], 1 katal = 1&amp;nbsp;mol s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, but this is an excessively large unit. A more practical and commonly used value is [[enzyme unit]] (U) = 1 [[μ]]mol min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. 1 U corresponds to 16.67 [[Nano-|nano]]katals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry (NC-IUB) |title=Units of Enzyme Activity |journal=Eur. J. Biochem. |volume=97 |pages=319–20 |year=1979 |url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1432-1033.1979.tb13116.x |doi=10.1111/j.1432-1033.1979.tb13116.x |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enzyme activity as given in katal generally refers to that of the assumed natural target substrate of the enzyme. Enzyme activity can also be given as that of certain standardized substrates, such as [[gelatin]], then measured in ''gelatin digesting units'' (GDU), or milk proteins, then measured in ''milk clotting units'' (MCU). The units GDU and MCU are based on how fast one gram of the enzyme will digest gelatin or milk proteins, respectively. 1 GDU equals approximately 1.5 MCU.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/dictG.html How Many? A Dictionary of Units of Measurement] By Russ Rowlett at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill&lt;/ref&gt;

An increased amount of substrate will increase the rate of reaction with enzymes, however once past a certain point, the rate of reaction will level out because the amount of active sites available has stayed constant.

===Specific activity===
The specific activity of an enzyme is another common unit. This is the activity of an enzyme per milligram of total protein (expressed in μmol min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;mg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). Specific activity gives a measurement of enzyme purity in the mixture. It is the micro moles of product formed by an [[enzyme]] in a given amount of time (minutes) under given conditions per milligram of total proteins. Specific activity is equal to the rate of reaction multiplied by the volume of reaction divided by the mass of total protein. The SI unit is katal kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, but a more practical unit is μmol mg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. Specific activity is a measure of enzyme processivity, at a specific (usually saturating) [[Enzyme substrate|substrate]] concentration, and is usually constant for a pure enzyme. For elimination of errors arising from differences in cultivation batches and/or misfolded enzyme etc. an active site titration needs to be done. This is a measure of the amount of active enzyme, calculated by e.g. titrating the amount of active sites present by employing an irreversible inhibitor. The specific activity should then be expressed as μmol min&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; mg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; active enzyme. If the molecular weight of the enzyme is known, the [[turnover number]], or μmol product per second per μmol of active enzyme, can be calculated from the specific activity. The turnover number can be visualized as the number of times each enzyme molecule carries out its catalytic cycle per second.

=== Related terminology ===
The '''rate of a reaction''' is the concentration of substrate disappearing (or product produced) per unit time (mol L&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;).

The '''% purity''' is 100% × (specific activity of enzyme sample / specific activity of pure enzyme). The impure sample has lower specific activity because some of the mass is not actually enzyme. If the specific activity of 100% pure enzyme is known, then an impure sample will have a lower specific activity, allowing purity to be calculated.

== Types of assay ==

All enzyme [[assay]]s measure either the consumption of substrate or production of product over time. A large number of different methods of measuring the concentrations of substrates and products exist and many enzymes can be assayed in several different ways. Biochemists usually study enzyme-catalysed reactions using four types of experiments:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Schnell, S. |author2=Chappell, M.J. |author3=Evans, N.D. |author4=Roussel, M.R. |title=The mechanism distinguishability problem in biochemical kinetics: The single-enzyme, single-substrate reaction as a case study |journal=Comptes Rendus Biologies |volume=329 |issue=1 |pages=51–61 |year=2006 |pmid=16399643 |doi=10.1016/j.crvi.2005.09.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Initial rate experiments'''. When an enzyme is mixed with a large excess of the substrate, the enzyme-substrate intermediate builds up in a fast initial transient. Then the reaction achieves a steady-state kinetics in which enzyme substrate intermediates remains approximately constant over time and the reaction rate changes relatively slowly. Rates are measured for a short period after the attainment of the quasi-steady state, typically by monitoring the accumulation of product with time. Because the measurements are carried out for a very short period and because of the large excess of substrate, the approximation that the amount of free substrate is approximately equal to the amount of the initial substrate can be made. The initial rate experiment is the simplest to perform and analyze, being relatively free from complications such as back-reaction and enzyme degradation. It is therefore by far the most commonly used type of experiment in enzyme kinetics.
* '''Progress curve experiments'''. In these experiments, the kinetic parameters are determined from expressions for the species concentrations as a function of time. The concentration of the substrate or product is recorded in time after the initial fast transient and for a sufficiently long period to allow the reaction to approach equilibrium. Progress curve experiments were widely used in the early period of enzyme kinetics, but are less common now.
* '''Transient kinetics experiments'''. In these experiments, reaction behaviour is tracked during the initial fast transient as the intermediate reaches the steady-state kinetics period. These experiments are more difficult to perform than either of the above two classes because they require specialist techniques (such as [[flash photolysis]] of caged compounds) or rapid mixing (such as [[Stopped flow|stopped-flow]], quenched flow or continuous flow).
* '''Relaxation experiments'''. In these experiments, an equilibrium mixture of enzyme, substrate and product is perturbed, for instance by a [[Temperature jump|temperature]], [[Pressure jump|pressure]] or pH jump, and the return to equilibrium is monitored. The analysis of these experiments requires consideration of the fully reversible reaction. Moreover, relaxation experiments are relatively insensitive to mechanistic details and are thus not typically used for mechanism identification, although they can be under appropriate conditions.

Enzyme assays can be split into two groups according to their sampling method: '''continuous assays''', where the assay gives a continuous reading of activity, and '''discontinuous assays''', where samples are taken, the reaction stopped and then the concentration of substrates/products determined.

[[File:Cuvette holder.jpg|thumb|left|Temperature-controlled [[cuvette]] holder in a spectrophotometer.]]

==Continuous assays==

Continuous assays are most convenient, with one assay giving the rate of reaction with no further work necessary. There are many different types of continuous assays.

===Spectrophotometric===

In [[Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy|spectrophotometric]] assays, you follow the course of the reaction by measuring a change in how much light the assay solution absorbs. If this light is in the visible region you can actually see a change in the color of the assay, and these are called '''colorimetric assays'''. The [[MTT assay]], a redox assay using a tetrazolium dye as substrate is an example of a colorimetric assay.

UV light is often used, since the common coenzymes [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NADH]] and [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NADPH]] absorb UV light in their [[redox|reduced]] forms, but do not in their [[redox|oxidized]] forms. An [[oxidoreductase]] using NADH as a substrate could therefore be assayed by following the decrease in UV absorbance at a wavelength of 340&amp;nbsp;nm as it consumes the coenzyme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bergmeyer, H.U. |title=Methods of Enzymatic Analysis |publisher=Academic Press |location=New York |year=1974 |pages=2066–72 |volume=4 |isbn=0-89573-236-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Direct versus coupled assays'''
[[File:Coupled assay.svg|thumb|320px|right|Coupled assay for [[hexokinase]] using [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase]].]]
Even when the enzyme reaction does not result in a change in the absorbance of light, it can still be possible to use a spectrophotometric assay for the enzyme by using a '''coupled assay'''. Here, the product of one reaction is used as the substrate of another, easily detectable reaction. For example, figure 1 shows the coupled assay for the enzyme [[hexokinase]], which can be assayed by coupling its production of glucose-6-phosphate to NADPH production, using [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase]].

===Fluorometric===

[[Fluorescence]] is when a molecule emits light of one [[wavelength]] after absorbing light of a different wavelength. Fluorometric assays use a difference in the fluorescence of substrate from product to measure the enzyme reaction. These assays are in general much more sensitive than spectrophotometric assays, but can suffer from interference caused by impurities and the instability of many fluorescent compounds when exposed to light.

An example of these assays is again the use of the nucleotide coenzymes NADH and NADPH. Here, the reduced forms are fluorescent and the oxidised forms non-fluorescent. Oxidation reactions can therefore be followed by a decrease in fluorescence and reduction reactions by an increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Passonneau, J.V. |author2=Lowry, O.H. |title=Enzymatic Analysis. A Practical Guide |publisher=Humana Press |location=Totowa NJ |year=1993 |pages=85–110 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Synthetic substrates that release a fluorescent dye in an enzyme-catalyzed reaction are also available, such as 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-D-galactoside for assaying [[β-galactosidase]].

===Calorimetric===
[[File:Luminol2006.jpg|thumb|Chemiluminescence of luminol]]
[[Calorimetry]] is the measurement of the heat released or absorbed by chemical reactions. These assays are very general, since many reactions involve some change in heat and with use of a microcalorimeter, not much enzyme or substrate is required. These assays can be used to measure reactions that are impossible to assay in any other way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Todd MJ, Gomez J |title=Enzyme kinetics determined using calorimetry: a general assay for enzyme activity? |journal=Anal. Biochem. |volume=296 |issue=2 |pages=179–87 |date=September 2001 |pmid=11554713 |doi=10.1006/abio.2001.5218 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0003-2697(01)95218-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemiluminescent===

[[Chemiluminescence]] is the emission of light by a chemical reaction. Some enzyme reactions produce light and this can be measured to detect product formation. These types of assay can be extremely sensitive, since the light produced can be captured by photographic film over days or weeks, but can be hard to quantify, because not all the light released by a reaction will be detected.

The detection of [[peroxidase|horseradish peroxidase]] by enzymatic chemiluminescence (ECL) is a common method of detecting antibodies in [[western blotting]]. Another example is the enzyme [[luciferase]], this is found in fireflies and naturally produces light from its substrate luciferin.

===Light scattering===

[[Static light scattering]] measures the product of weight-averaged molar mass and concentration of macromolecules in solution. Given a fixed total concentration of one or more species over the measurement time, the scattering signal is a direct measure of the weight-averaged molar mass of the solution, which will vary as complexes form or dissociate.
Hence the measurement quantifies the stoichiometry of the complexes as well as kinetics. Light scattering assays of protein kinetics is a very general technique that does not require an enzyme.

===Microscale thermophoresis===

[[Microscale thermophoresis]] (MST)&lt;ref name=Wienken&gt;{{cite journal | author=Wienken CJ | title=Protein-binding assays in biological liquids using microscale thermophoresis | journal=Nature Communications | year=2010 | volume=1 |  doi = 10.1038/ncomms1093 | issue=7 | url=http://www.nature.com/ncomms/journal/v1/n7/full/ncomms1093.html | bibcode=2010NatCo...1E.100W | pages=100 | pmid=20981028|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; measures the size, charge and hydration entropy of molecules/substrates at equilibrium.&lt;ref name=Duhr1&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Duhr S, Braun D | title = Why molecules move along a temperature gradient | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. | volume = 103 | issue = 52 | pages = 19678–82 |date=December 2006 | pmid = 17164337 | pmc = 1750914 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0603873103 | url = | bibcode=2006PNAS..10319678D}}&lt;/ref&gt; The thermophoretic movement of a fluorescently labeled substrate changes significantly as it is modified by an enzyme. This enzymatic activity can be measured with high time resolution in real time.&lt;ref name=Baaske2&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baaske P, Wienken C, Duhr S | date=  2009 | title = Optisch erzeugte Thermophorese für die Bioanalytik |trans-title= Optically generated thermophoresis for bioanalysis | journal = Biophotonik | volume =  | issue =  | pages = 22–24 | pmid =  | pmc =  | doi =  | language = German | url = http://www.photonik.de/index.php?id=112&amp;seitenid=11&amp;fachid=2043&amp;readpdf=biophotonik_2009_01_022.pdf }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The material consumption of the all optical MST method is very low, only 5 µl sample volume and 10nM enzyme concentration are needed to measure the enzymatic rate constants for activity and inhibition. MST allows analysts to measure the modification of two different substrates at once ([[multiplexing]]) if both substrates are labeled with different fluorophores. Thus substrate competition experiments can be performed.

==Discontinuous assays==

Discontinuous assays are when samples are taken from an enzyme reaction at intervals and the amount of product production or substrate consumption is measured in these samples.

===Radiometric===

Radiometric assays measure the incorporation of [[radioactivity]] into substrates or its release from substrates. The [[radioactive isotopes]] most frequently used in these assays are &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C, &lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;P, &lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt;S and &lt;sup&gt;125&lt;/sup&gt;I. Since radioactive isotopes can allow the specific labelling of a single atom of a substrate, these assays are both extremely sensitive and specific. They are frequently used in biochemistry and are often the only way of measuring a specific reaction in crude extracts (the complex mixtures of enzymes produced when you lyse cells).

Radioactivity is usually measured in these procedures using a [[scintillation counter]].

===Chromatographic===

Chromatographic assays measure product formation by separating the reaction mixture into its components by [[chromatography]]. This is usually done by [[high-performance liquid chromatography]] (HPLC), but can also use the simpler technique of [[thin layer chromatography]]. Although this approach can need a lot of material, its sensitivity can be increased by labelling the substrates/products with a radioactive or fluorescent tag. Assay sensitivity has also been increased by switching protocols to improved chromatographic instruments (e.g. ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography) that operate at pump pressure a few-fold higher than HPLC instruments (see [[High-performance liquid chromatography#Pump pressure]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Churchwell, M |author2=Twaddle, N |author3=Meeker, L |author4=Doerge, D. |title=Improving Sensitivity in Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry |journal=Journal of Chromatography B |volume=825 |issue=2 |pages=134–143 |date=October 2005 | doi=10.1016/j.jchromb.2005.05.037 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factors to control in assays==
[[File:Enzyme high pressure b.jpg|thumb|A pressure chamber for measuring enzyme activity at high pressure.]]
*'''Salt Concentration''': Most enzymes cannot tolerate extremely high salt concentrations. The ions interfere with the weak [[ionic bonds]] of [[proteins]]. Typical enzymes are active in salt concentrations of 1-500 mM. As usual there are exceptions such as the [[halophilic]] [[algae]] and [[bacteria]].
*'''Effects of Temperature''': All enzymes work within a range of temperature specific to the organism. Increases in temperature generally lead to increases in reaction rates. There is a limit to the increase because higher temperatures lead to a sharp decrease in reaction rates. This is due to the denaturating (alteration) of [[protein]] structure resulting from the breakdown of the weak [[Ionic bond|ionic]] and [[hydrogen bonding]] that stabilize the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme active site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Daniel RM, Peterson ME, Danson MJ |title=The molecular basis of the effect of temperature on enzyme activity |journal=Biochem. J. |volume=425 |issue=2 |pages=353–60 |date=January 2010 |pmid=19849667 |doi=10.1042/BJ20091254|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "optimum" temperature for human enzymes is usually between 35 and 40&amp;nbsp;°C. The average temperature for humans is 37&amp;nbsp;°C. Human enzymes start to denature quickly at temperatures above 40&amp;nbsp;°C. Enzymes from [[thermophilic]] [[archaea]] found in the hot springs are stable up to 100&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cowan DA |title=Thermophilic proteins: stability and function in aqueous and organic solvents |journal=Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A Physiol. |volume=118 |issue=3 |pages=429–38 |year=1997 |pmid=9406427 |doi=10.1016/S0300-9629(97)00004-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the idea of an "optimum" rate of an enzyme reaction is misleading, as the rate observed at any temperature is the product of two rates, the reaction rate and the denaturation rate. If you were to use an assay measuring activity for one second, it would give high activity at high temperatures, however if you were to use an assay measuring product formation over an hour, it would give you low activity at these temperatures.
*'''Effects of pH''':  Most enzymes are sensitive to [[pH]] and have specific ranges of activity. All have an optimum pH. The pH can stop enzyme activity by denaturating (altering) the three-dimensional shape of the enzyme by breaking [[Ionic bond|ionic]], and [[hydrogen bond]]s. Most enzymes function between a pH of 6 and 8; however pepsin in the stomach works best at a pH of 2 and trypsin at a pH of 8.
*'''Substrate Saturation''': Increasing the [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] concentration increases the rate of reaction (enzyme activity). However, enzyme saturation limits reaction rates. An enzyme is saturated when the active sites of all the molecules are occupied most of the time. At the saturation point, the reaction will not speed up, no matter how much additional substrate is added. The graph of the reaction rate will plateau.
*'''Level of crowding''', large amounts of [[macromolecule]]s in a solution will alter the [[reaction rate|rates]] and [[equilibrium constant]]s of enzyme reactions, through an effect called [[macromolecular crowding]].&lt;ref name=Minton&gt;{{cite journal |author=Minton AP |title=The influence of macromolecular crowding and macromolecular confinement on biochemical reactions in physiological media |journal=J. Biol. Chem. |volume=276 |issue=14 |pages=10577–80 |year=2001 |pmid=11279227 |doi=10.1074/jbc.R100005200 |url=http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/276/14/10577}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4448">In [[philosophy]] and [[rhetoric]], '''eristic''' (from ''[[Eris (mythology)|Eris]]'', the ancient Greek [[goddess]] of chaos, strife, and discord) refers to [[argument]] that aims to successfully dispute another's argument, rather than searching for [[truth]]. According to T.H. Irwin, "It is characteristic of the eristic to think of some arguments as a way of defeating the other side, by showing that an opponent must assent to the negation of what he initially took himself to believe."&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, T.H. "Plato's Objection to the Sophists." The Greek World. London: Routledge, 1995. P. 585. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Eristic is arguing for the sake of conflict, as opposed to resolving conflict.&lt;ref&gt;H.D. Rankin (1983). Sophists, Socratics and Cynics. Pp. 233–237.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in education==
Eristic was a type of "question-and-answer"&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Nehamas. "Eristic, Antilogic, Sophistic, Dialectic: Plato's Demarcation of Philosophy from Sophistry". (page 6)&lt;/ref&gt; teaching method popularized by the [[Sophism|Sophists]], such as [[Euthydemus (Socratic literature)|Euthydemos]] and [[Dionysodoros]]. Students learned eristic arguments to "refute their opponent, no matter whether he [said] yes or no in answer to their initial question".&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, T.H. "Plato's Objection to the Sophists." The Greek World. London: Routledge, 1995. 583. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Plato]] contrasted this type of argument with [[dialectic]] and other more [[reason]]able and [[logic]]al methods (e.g., at [[The Republic (Plato)|''Republic'']] 454a). In the dialogue [[Euthydemus (dialogue)|''Euthydemus'']], Plato satirizes eristic. It is more than persuasion, and it is more than discourse. It is a combination that wins an argument without regard to truth. Plato believed that the eristic style "did not constitute a method of argument" because to argue eristically is to consciously use fallacious arguments, which therefore weakens one's position.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Nehamas. "Eristic, Antilogic, Sophistic, Dialectic: Plato's Demarcation of Philosophy from Sophistry". (page 7).&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike Plato, [[Isocrates]] (often considered a Sophist) did not distinguish eristic from dialectic.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0168:book=5:section=454a&lt;/ref&gt; He held that both lacked a "'useful application' ... that created responsible citizens",&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, Charles. Classical rhetoric and modern public relations: an Isocratean model. New York: Routledge, 2013. P. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; which unscrupulous teachers used for "enriching themselves at the expense of the youth."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0144:speech=15:section=45&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical eristic==
[[Schopenhauer]] considers that only logic pursues truth. For him, [[dialectic]], [[sophistry]] and eristic have no objective truth in view, but only the appearance of it, and pay no regard to truth itself because it aims at victory. He names these three last methods as "eristic dialectic (contentious argument)."&lt;ref&gt;[http://coolhaus.de/art-of-controversy/eristii.htm Controversial Dialectic] on CoolHaus.de accessed at January 19, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Schopenhauer]], [[The Art of Being Right|''Eristic Dialectic'']] is mainly concerned to tabulate and analyze dishonest stratagems,&lt;ref&gt;In his ''Dialectica Eristica'' Schopenhauer presents 38 eristic stratagems&lt;/ref&gt; so that they may at once be recognized and defeated, in order to continue with a productive dialectic debate. It is for this very reason that Eristic Dialectic must admittedly take victory, and not objective truth, for its selfish aim and purpose.

==Argumentation theory==
[[Argumentation theory]] is a field of study that asks critical questions about eristic arguments and the other types of dialogue.

The '''Global Implementation Plan to End Violence Against Women and Girls''' was a recommendation from the multi-agency [[EGM: prevention of violence against women and girls|Expert Group Meeting (EGM) on the prevention of violence against women and girls]]. The meeting was convened as part of the [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women|United Nations Commission on the Status of Women's]] multi-year programme of work for 2010-2014.

The "Elimination and prevention of all forms of violence against women and girls" formed a priority theme for its [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women#Session reports|fifty-seventh session in 2013 (CSW57).]]
{{TOClimit}}

==Background==
The [[EGM: prevention of violence against women and girls|EGM]] took place in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]] 17 - 20 September 2012 and was organised by the [[United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women]] ([[UN Women]]), in collaboration with the following organisations:
*[[United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific]] (ESCAP);
*[[United Nations Development Programme]] ([[UNDP]]);
*[[United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA);
*[[United Nations Children’s Fund]] ([[UNICEF]]) and;
*[[World Health Organization]] ([[WHO]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unwomen.org/en/events/59/expert-group-meeting-prevention-of-violence-against-women-and-girls/ EGM announced, [[UN Women]]'s website.]{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Retrieved 28 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The report that the meeting produced reflected the shared discussion and analysis of the major issues, gaps and challenges identified at the [[EGM: prevention of violence against women and girls|EGM]] and presented key findings and recommendations. It was intended to build on the individual papers on specific issues provided by experts prior to the meeting, and the background paper prepared by the rapporteur.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unwomen.org/events/59/expert-group-meeting-prevention-of-violence-against-women-and-girls/ EGM: prevention of violence against women and girls.] Background papers. Retrieved 8 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It provided inputs for the reports of the Secretary-General to the CSW and was widely disseminated in preparation to the fifty-seventh session of CSW.

[[EGM:_prevention_of_violence_against_women_and_girls#A_global_implementation_plan_to_end_violence_against_women_and_girls|Recommendations 106 - 109]] of the [[EGM: prevention of violence against women and girls|EGM]] calls for a global plan to be launched by 2015, to end violence against women and girls organised along these lines:-

'''Recommendation 109'''&lt;br /&gt;''The Global Implementation Plan to End Violence against Women and Girls, endorsed and supported by Member States at its launch, would aim to:''
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Intensify and scale-up global awareness of violence against women and girls as a global emergency.''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Combine the best thinking on how to proceed with concrete pledges for action.''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Mobilise international, regional and national action by governments, multilaterals, the private sector and civil society.''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Build the foundation for an evidence and practice-informed global prevention strategy.''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Increase resources available to end violence against women and girls.''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

'''Recommendation 111'''&lt;br /&gt;''Development of the plan would require, among other things:''
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Identification of a small set of key policy, legal and programme-delivery targets (institutions) at the national level towards which global violence prevention efforts can be directed.''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Detailed review of existing action plans, indicators, recommendations, platforms for action, policy agendas, and recommendations outlined by the Security Council, UN Treaty bodies, the special rapporteurs, and various UN agencies, with a view to closing implementation gaps and building the next stage.''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Creation of a cohesive global community of key stakeholders.''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Designation of strong coordinating mechanisms.''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''Development of an accountability framework with indicators to measure State responsiveness to the policy, legal and programme-delivery goals identified and an independent monitoring mechanism.''&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

==United Nations Commission on the Status of Women - fifty-seventh session==
The [[United_Nations_Commission_on_the_Status_of_Women#Session_reports|fifty-seventh session of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women]] took place at the UN building, New York between 4 and 15 March 2013. The agreed conclusions from the session agreed the following four actions:
&lt;ol type="A"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strengthening implementation of legal and policy frameworks and accountability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Addressing structural and underlying causes and risk factors so as to prevent violence against women and girls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strengthening multisectorial services, programmes and responses to violence against women and girls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improving the evidence-base.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/csw/csw57/CSW57_agreed_conclusions_advance_unedited_version_18_March_2013.pdf Unedited draft.] Retrieved 11 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ISSN|0252-0117}} [https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=E/2013/27 Final draft, pp. 1-17.] Retrieved 11 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

[[UN Women|UN Women's]] Executive Director [[Michelle Bachelet]] urged speedy implementation of the Agreed Conclusions saying, "The best way to honour the commitments made by Member States at the Commission is to work for implementation and accountability."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unwomen.org/2013/03/un-women-urges-implementation-of-historic-global-agreement-to-end-violence-against-women-and-girls/ Press release from UN Women, "UN Women urges implementation of historic global agreement to end violence against women and girls", 20 March 2013.

'''Hy-Rib''' was a brand name for a product manufactured by the [[Trussed Concrete Steel Company]]. It is an engineering reinforcement system for floors, walls, and ceilings of buildings and houses. This product is a derivative of the [[Kahn System|Kahn Trussed Bar]] for beams and columns that was invented by [[Julius Kahn (inventor)|Julius Kahn]]. Kahn engineered the Hy-Rib products and they were first manufactured in 1909.&lt;ref name="SedlarReport"&gt; {{cite journal | url=http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/98436/Sedlar_Engineering_Industrial_Architecture.pdf | title=Engineering Industrial Architecture: Albert Kahn and the Trussed Concrete Steel Company | publisher=University of Michigan | date=June 24, 2013 | author=Sedlar, Frank | journal=2012–2013 MLibrary Undergraduate Research Award Maize Award for Single-Term Projects | format=PDF | ref={{sfnRef|Sedlar|2013}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hy-Rib is a steel [[encasement]] stiffened by rigid ribs used in reinforced walls, ceilings, and floors.{{sfn|Truscon|1917|p=5}} They are [[Helix|helical]] hooping units of steel sheathing forms used in concrete, stucco and plaster.{{sfn|Skinner|1997|p=13}} Hy-Rib products are a derivative of the "wings" used in the patented Kahn System of reinforced concrete, invented by Julius Kahn in 1903.{{sfn|Hughes|Allen|Hecht|2001|p=142}} The products are made from a single plate of steel.{{sfn|Truscon|1917|p=5}} Hy-Rib products were used in concrete doors, ceilings, and roofs.{{sfn|Truscon|1917|p=5}} It was also used in sidings, partitions and ceilings to eliminate channels.{{sfn|Truscon|1917|p=5}} Hy-Rib products were designed to take on plaster and cement to eliminate layout forms in the construction of buildings.{{sfn|Truscon|1917|p=5}} The steel sheet form would be embedded with plaster or cement directly and would flow into the lath surface to attach itself to the steel and harden to secure the material into the steel.&lt;ref name="SedlarReport"/&gt;

== Description and Application ==
Hy-Rib products came in steel sheathing forms that could be bent, cut and connected together to make various size floors, walls, and ceilings. They were designed with the idea to reduce weight as compared to wood structures of the same building size. The steel forms of sheathing were stiffened by rigid high ribs and a complete unit was made with a single sheet of steel. This technique increased floor space because it cut down on center posts that were normally used in wood structured buildings. The Hy-Rib reinforced concrete floors, ceilings and walls were fireproof, being a major safety factor over wooden structures. The [[Packard Automotive Plant|Packard automobile factory plant building number 10]] is a demonstration of Hy-Rib product application of this reinforced concrete technique.&lt;ref name=SedlarReport/&gt;{{sfn|Hildebrand|1974|pp=28–30}}  This was the first time reinforced concrete products were used for automobile factory construction.{{sfn|Hildebrand|1974|p=31|ps=. "Thus Plant Number Ten represented a clear advance in factory construction for Packard and for the automobile industry in general, as it was the first automobile plant to be built of reinforced concrete."}}{{sfn|Sedlar|2013|p=31|ps=. "The Packard #10 building was the first to utilize reinforced concrete with Julius Kahn's Kahn Bar but also as previously discussed, the full range of steel building products from the Trussed Concrete Steel Company."}}

Hy-Rib products are used in the construction of [[tunnels]], [[Pipe (fluid conveyance)|conduits]], [[flume]]s, [[culvert]]s, [[silo]]s, [[cistern]]s, [[chimney]]s, and [[water tank]]s. For these applications the lath sheet products come in curved steel sheets. They are locked together to form a complete tube or tunnel on site. The curved sheets are stood on edge in the case of silos, water tanks, cisterns, and chimneys. The connected form then is plastered with cement. In some cases a few steel rods are added for extra strength and connecting purposes.{{sfn|Truscon|1917|pp=119–130}}

Hy-Rib products are used in flooring due to its ability to interlock prefabricated pieces. It has plaster applied to the underside creating the ceiling. The top would have wet cement poured on it to form the floor above. If the floor were required to carry heavy loads the Hy-Rib sheathing material could be bent into an arch to provide additional strength and then wet cement could poured as usual on top to make a floor.&lt;ref name=SedlarReport/&gt;

The '''Institute of Bioinformatics and Applied Biotechnology (IBAB)''' is a non-profit autonomous institute set up by the Department of IT, BT and S&amp;T, Government of Karnataka. It is located in a 20-acre campus in the southern part of the City of Bengaluru and is a part of Biotech Park. Its mission is to help grow the biotech industry and, to fulfill this mission, it has adopted the strategies of education, research and promoting entrepreneurship.

==History==

The [http://www.bangaloreitbt.in/ Department of Information Technology and Biotechnology of the Government of Karnataka] established the institute in 2001, with financial support from ICICI Bank. The institute has received overwhelming support from academic and industry scientists, primarily those in Bengaluru. Its programmes would not be possible without this ongoing support.

IBAB's first Director, Prof. Manju Bansal, is a professor at the [[Indian Institute of Science]], [[Bengaluru]]. She was with the institute for the first three years. She was succeeded by Prof. N. Yathindra of the [[University of Madras]] in the year 2004. He served as the Director of IBAB until February, 2018. Dr. Hosahalli Subramanya is the current Director of IBAB, since February, 2018.

Originally located at the [http://www.itpbangalore.com International Tech Park], IBAB moved to its own campus in the Biotech Park, Electronic City in Bengaluru in June 2009. The two-storeyed academic block of the new campus has (in its first phase) 30,000 sq ft. There is a three-storeyed men's hostel, which can accommodate almost 100 students, and a dining block. The lady students moved into their spacious new 4-storeyed hostel on 20 March 2015. In addition, a neighbouring 40,000 sq. ft. life science and med-tech incubator  hosted its first incubatee in December 2015. It currently has about 40 startups on its premises.

==Funding support==

The institute continues to be supported by the Government of Karnataka's Department of IT, BT and S&amp;T. It has been funded under DST's FIST programme, and has received research funding from the MeitY, Department of Biotechnology and Department of Science &amp; Technology, all of the Government of India. It has been recognized as a Centre of Excellence of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India.

Most recently the institute has received generous funding from the Infosys Foundation to fund the Infosys Chair. In the past, the institute has received faculty chairs from AstraZeneca Research Foundation, [http://www.biocon.com Biocon] and Merck &amp; Co. and has also been funded by the [http://www.wadhwani-foundation.org Wadhwani Foundation] and Institut Merieux. IBAB has received scholarship support from the Government of Karnataka, Accelrys, Merck &amp; Co, Millipore, Sartorius, [http://www.strandls.com Strand Life Sciences] and an anonymous donor. Sudha Murty of the [http://www.infosys.com/infosys_foundation Infosys Foundation] has endowed medals to two of the best students of the graduating bioinformatics class each year, and a scholarship in the name of Purnima Chaudhury.  Several companies and individuals have supported the students' entrepreneurship activities.

==Education==

The institute offered a Postgraduate Diploma in Bioinformatics (starting in 2002), and Biotechniques (since 2003). The bioinformatics course involved 12 months of classes and, in the third term, a six-month internship placement in industry or academia. The biotechniques course involved eight months of coursework and an optional six-month research project. These courses have now been stopped.

Starting in August 2011, IBAB offered an M.Sc. degree in 'Bioinformatics and Biotechnology', recognized by [[IGNOU]], New Delhi. The affiliation of the M.Sc. program was changed to [[Mysore University]] starting from  2013 and subsequently to [[Bangalore University]] from 2018.   IBAB has an ongoing Ph.D program in affiliation with MAHE, Manipal and TDU, Bangalore.

IBAB offers short term courses on Data Analytics, Omics and Next Generation Sequencing frequently.

The institute has an excellent record in placing its students in various companies (about 95% of its graduating students have been placed in the past). Details of student's placement are available at http://www.ibab.ac.in/index.php/placements/.

==Research==

Research work by the faculty has led to bioinformatics tools, such as ExPrimer for primer design. It has also led to several publications in international journals such as ''Cell'', ''Nature Biotechnology'', ''Nucleic Acids Research'', ''PLoS One'', ''Journal of Medicinal Chemistry'', ''Journal of Biological Chemistry'', ''BMC Genomics'', ''Bioinformatics'', ''Drug Discovery Today'' and ''FEBS Journal''. Eight articles in the area of bio-business have appeared in [http://www.currentscience.ac.in ''Current Science''].

==GANIT Labs, Bio-IT Centre==
IBAB, in collaboration with [http://www.strandls.com Strand Life Sciences], has set up [http://www.ganitlabs.in GANIT Labs, Bio-IT Centre], a not-for-profit centre in  2011 that is dedicated to Functional Genomics, Next Generation Sequencing and Computational Biology. housed at IBAB, the Centre was headed by Dr. Binay Panda. The Centre's initial funding came from the MeitY, Government of India and Department of IT, BT and S&amp;T, Government of Karnataka. Various projects at the Centre are funded by Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Department of Science and Technology (DST) and Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), all Government of India agencies.

GANIT Labs worked on several India-centric projects, namely sequencing and analysis of diseases prevalent in India, and sequencing and analysis of species that are of particular interest to India and have tremendous biotechnological potential. In late 2011, GANIT Labs announced the sequencing of [[Azadirachta indica|neem]]. Besides these, the Centre is working on several other subjects, including sequencing of other complex higher organisms, developing bioinformatics and computational pipeline for massive amount of sequencing data. 

Since 2017, the facility has been integrated into IBAB, as Bio-IT Centre. The Bio-IT center, comprises state-of-the-art facility for NGS with the high throughput sequencer Hi Seq 2500, which can generate 480-500GB data in 10 days equivalent to sequencing 6 human genomes at 30X coverage. Other equipment in the facility include Hi-Scan (Illumina bead-array) for genotyping and Ion-torrent for NGS and Qubit, C-bot, Covaris, Bio-analyzer and Tape-station for the processing of DNA and RNA samples. The Bio-IT centre  provides service to the scientific community in a collaborative program mode or on a purely service basis. 

==Promoting entrepreneurship==

In 2004, the institute received a grant from the [http://wadhwani-foundation.org/ Wadhwani Foundation] to promote entrepreneurship. It has since become a partner of the Foundation. The bioinformatics students took a course in entrepreneurship. In addition, the institute does research in the areas of patents and company formation.

Several companies have availed the incubation services of IBAB, including [http://www.cellworksgroup.com CellWorks Group], Symbiosis Biowares, Novozymes R&amp;D, [http://www.shodhaka.com Shodhaka Life Sciences], Ixora Biosciences, BioCOS Life Sciences, Geniron Biolabs, Microtest Innovations, MIR Life Sciences, DeNovo BioLabs, Privils, String Bio, Omix R&amp;D Laboratories, Pentavalent, Indoor Biotechnologies, Techsicon Biotech and Plasmatech Solutions.

The '''Maronite mummies''' are eight well preserved natural [[Mummy|mummies]] of [[Maronite]] villagers dating back to around 1283 AD.  They were uncovered by a team of [[speleologist]]/[[archaeologists]]s during a rescue excavation in the [[Qadisha Valley]] of [[Lebanon]] in 1991. They are currently on display in the [[National Museum of Beirut]].

==Discovery==
The mummies were found in the 'Asi-al Hadath cave located in the [[Kadisha Valley]] in [[Lebanon]], on July 13, 1990 by a group of speleologists/archaeologists of the Groupe d'Etudes et de Recherches Souterraines du Liban- GERSL, namely Abi Aoun Pierre, Baroudy Fadi, Ghaouch Antoine and Khawaja Paul&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Abi Aoun B., Baroudy F., Ghaouch A. Khawaja P and alias Momies du Liban: Rapport préliminaire sur la découverte archaéologique de 'Asi-al-Hadat (XIIIe siècle), France, Édifra, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;
The find was the result of two years of excavation.  Initially, the discovery consisted of a single four-month-old infant mummy&lt;ref name="cavinglebanon.com"&gt;http://www.cavinglebanon.com/publications/&lt;/ref&gt;

The infant was named Yasmine by her discoverers after a child whose name was mentioned in a manuscript discovered on-site. The infant was clothed and fully interred only 40&amp;nbsp;cm below ground, she was laid on her back alone in the grave, her head resting on a smooth stone. Yasmine was carefully wrapped in medical gauze and immobilized with splinting devices by the team and transported from the grotto to a customized laboratory, created by the Discoverers. 
Multiple other remains were found following the discovering, include seven bodies (four infants and three adults) as well as skeletal remains of several others.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;http://www.cavinglebanon.com/asi-l-hadath-fortified-cave/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==

===The grotto===
[[File: grottoentrance Mari.jpg|thumb|180px|'Asi-al-Hadath Grotto: Refuge of the persecuted.
Courtesy of Photographer Michel Schbot (1996)]]

'Asi-al-Hadath Grotto is in the vicinity of [[Hadath El Jebbeh|Hadath-El-Gibbet]].&lt;ref&gt;[[René Dussaud|Dussaud, R.]] Topographie Historique de la Syrie Antique, (Paris, 1927), p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; The high altitude of the grotto makes access or regular use of it as living quarters difficult.&lt;ref&gt;L'Architecture Libanaise du XV au XIXe Siècle, Beirut, 1985; Renan, E. Mission de Phenicie, (Paris, 1864); and M. Chronologie des plus anciennes installations de Byblos, "Revue Biblique", LVII, 1950, pp. 590-593, 584-603.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, there is evidence of organized communal arrangements, a man-made water reservoir (3.5m x 1.4 m surface, 1.5 m depth, and 8 cubic meters volume); a stone basin for grinding grain by hand; and two well-like openings, probably used for retrieval and storage of water.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The grotto contains two main rooms: a large living quarter and the grave-yard room.&lt;ref&gt;"Liban Souterrain", pp. 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preservation===
The preliminary examination of the bodies revealed that they were naturally mummified. The grotto in which they had been interred acted as a perfect cast for the buried bodies, eliminating the formation of air pockets that normally facilitate the process of decomposition. Moreover, the low humidity of the grotto's air and the lack of organisms in its soil slowed the total decay of the bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Abi Aoun B., Baroudy F., Ghaouch A. Khawaja P and alias Momies du Liban: Rapport préliminaire sur la découverte archaéologique de 'Asi-al-Hadat (XIIIe siècle), France, Édifra, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dates===
researches carried out by the GERSL &lt;ref name="cavinglebanon.com"/&gt; corroborated the date of 1283 AD, when the area around the cave was part of the [[County of Tripoli]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

====Historical overview====
Between 1102 and 1289, Mount-Lebanon including [[Hadath El Jebbeh]] fell within the confines of the [[County of Tripoli]].&lt;ref&gt;Salibi, K. "The Maronites of Lebanon under Frankish and Mamluk Rule (1099-1516)", ''Arabica''; IV (1957), p. 291, 294; and Hiro, D. ''A History of the Lebanese Civil War'', (New York, 1992), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Tripoli was one of the four fundamental city units of the Crusaders Kingdom of Jerusalem &lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', XVth edition, (1982), pp. 297-310.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[County of Edessa]], the [[Principality of Antioch]], and the Royal Territories.&lt;ref&gt;Strayer, J., ed., ''Dictionary of the Middle Ages'', (New York, 1982), vol. 4, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the Mamelukes overtook Egypt, Syria, and Palestine, and set out to conquer Lebanon and expel the Crusaders. As modern scholars have pointed out, the Maronites, who constituted the majority population of that County,&lt;ref&gt;Salibi, p. 288, 291; Richard, J. ''Le conte de Tripoli sous la dynastie Toulousaine, 1102-1187'', (Paris, 1945), p. 86; and de Vitry, J. ''History of Jerusalem''; translated by Stewart, A., (London, 1897), p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; presented a constant obstacle to the Mamluk:&lt;ref&gt;Hayton, ''Recueil des Historiens des Croisades, R. H. C. Arménien'', (Paris, 1896), pp. 155-156; and Salibi, p. 294. See also de Tyre, G. ''A History of Deeds Done Beyond the Sea''; translated by Babcock, F., (New York, 1943)&lt;/ref&gt;
"in fact, the effective military assistance rendered by the Maronites to the Franks of Tripoli must have been one of the factors that helped the County face repeated Muslim attacks successfully and outlast the other Crusader states." &lt;ref&gt;Salibi, p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt;
It was not long before the Mamluks realized that in order for them to capture Tripoli, they must first subdue the Maronites.&lt;ref&gt;Khoury-Harb, The Maronites, (Beirut, 1985), p. 82; and Salibi, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mamluks launched several assaults against the highland of Tripoli devastating Gibbet Bsharri, Baqufa, Kfarsaroun, Hasrun, al-Hadath and others between 1250 and 1289.&lt;ref&gt;Salibi, p. 294; Al-Maqrizy, Kitab as-suluk li-ma'rifat dual al-Muluk, ed., Mustapha Ziada, (Cairo, 1936), p. 566; and Grousset, R. Histoire des Croisades et du Royaume Franc de Jerusalem, (Paris, 1936), p. 640&lt;/ref&gt; One particular raid was recorded in Ibn 'Abd az-Zahir's chronicle during his service as Secretary of the Court of three Mamluk Sultans (1223-1292 AD). Under the title of "the Account of Capturing the Patriarch of al-Hadath from the Region of Tripoli", he wrote:
"It happened that a Patriarch of the region of Tripoli annoyed, behaved insolently, became haughty, and frightened the governor of Tripoli and all the Francs. He led astray these people of those mountains and the people of those valleys who are of the strayed people. And this continued until he was feared by every neighbor. He entrenched himself in al-Hadath and held his nose high with arrogance and no one succeeded in tricking him... It happened that the governors of the Sultan ambushed him several times but did not find him. Then the Turkmans sought him in his place and tricked him so that they captured and blind-folded him and took him prisoner. The [[List of Maronite Patriarchs|Patriarch]] was one of the infidels and their impious ones, hence the Muslims were relieved of him and were spared his wickedness. His capture was a great conquest, greater even more than the conquest of a stronghold or a fortress..."&lt;ref&gt;Ibn `Abd Al-Zahir, Tasrif al-'usur bi sirat al-Malik al-Mansur, ed., Murad Kamil, (Cairo, 1961), p. 4. Translation mine. Elsewhere, Salibi, K. The Maronite Church in the Middle Ages and its Union with Rome, Oriens Christianus, vol. 40, (1956) p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports similar to that of Ibn 'Abd az-Zahir are to be found in the margins of two Bibles from the al-Hadath region near the Monastery of 'Mar Aboun' (Monastery of Saint Anthony of Qozhayya). The two Bibles were discovered by Patriarch Istephan Duwayhi during his research and writing of Tarikh al-Azmina between 1670 and 1704. The first Bible contains a note written in 1283 by an anonymous Christian who witnessed these events. The account contained in the second Bible is a copy of the first one, and it is dated 1504 AD. These accounts testify to the dramatic events unfolding in 'Asi al-Hadath during the 13th century.
The witness and writer of the original account of 1283 tells us that:
‘’’  "On August 22, 1283 the Muslim soldiers headed toward al-Hadath where the inhabitants took refuge in a magnificent and inaccessible grotto called al-'Asi. The grotto was besieged for seven years. The soldiers received it through the Aman _ a pledge of security and a promise of protection given by Muslim(s) to non-Muslim(s) (Jews and Christians) belonging to dar al-harb (Abode of War) for a specific period of time. Those non-Muslims who belong to dar al-salam (Adobe of Islam) fall under the [[dhimmi]] status.,&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia of Islam_ (Leiden, 1960), p. 426.&lt;/ref&gt; then burned its prefecture (the al-Hadath village) by fire and took the women captives."  ‘’’  &lt;ref&gt;Duwayhi, I., Patriarch T'arikh al-Azmina, ed., Fahd, B., (Beirut, 1983), p. 261. Translation mine. Elsewhere, Salibi, "Arabica", p. 294-295; and Momies Du Liban, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;

These two references are testimonies about a tragic event that occurred in al-Hadath. The accounts coincide in time, place, and action, and confirm an offensive against al-Hadath, thereby providing some historical context for our understanding of this archaeological discovery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cavinglebanon.com/asi-l-hadath-fortified-cave/]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The artifacts===
[[File:Embroided Mari.jpg|thumb| [[Embroider|Embroidered cloth]] depicting peacocks facing the tree of life.]]
Apart from the mummies themselves, a wealth of artifacts found at the site suggest that the people buried there were Maronites from the al-Hadath village, and that their death occurred circa 1283, which corresponds to the reign of the Mamluks and the presence of the Crusaders. Among the many examples of medieval pottery excavated, one pot attracts attention by its Arabic inscription: "This belongs to Boutros from al-Hadath.".&lt;ref&gt;Momies du Liban, pp. 202-204&lt;/ref&gt; Artistic and archaeological significance is manifested in the designs and motifs embroidered on textiles which are identical to designs found in the Syriac Rabbula Gospels, a 6th-century artistic masterpiece which belonged to the Maronite Patriarchate until the mid-15th century, but is now housed in Florence, Italy. A striking copy of two peacocks facing one another with a tree of life in-between remains vivid in color seven hundred years later.&lt;ref&gt;Momies du Liban, pp. 78-80.&lt;/ref&gt; From the Grotto over twenty manuscripts were unearthed. One of which is in Syriac and is a Maronite hymnody, another is in Arabic and bears the name and signature of George son of David, the Archdeacon of al-Hadath.&lt;ref name="Momies du Liban, pp. 146-210"&gt;Momies du Liban, pp. 146-210&lt;/ref&gt; Among the discovered items, several engraved wooden double-toothed combs, thin teeth on one side and coarse on the other, are identical to the combs used by Mamluk women in Egypt and are on display at the Museum of Islamic Art in Cairo, Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Momies du Liban, p. 215, 240, 245, 251; and `Abd Ar-Raziq, A. La Femme au temps des Mamlouks en Egypte, (Cairo, 1973), pp. 321-322&lt;/ref&gt; Many poles, arrows, and notches have been found to be identical with the Mamluk era arrows now on display at the Traditional Art Museum of Aleppo in Syria.&lt;ref&gt;Momies du Liban, pp. 206-208&lt;/ref&gt; An assortment of Crusader and Mamluk coins also invite the speculation that these mummies are of the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;Momies du Liban, pp. 198-201.

However, the most important and uncontestable evidence comes from the mummies themselves.

===Yasmine's clothes===
Yasmine wore beneath her shroud three dresses &lt;ref name="Liban 1993 p. 58"&gt;Momies du Liban: Rapport préliminaire sur la découverte archéologique de 'Asi-l-Hadat (XIIIe siècle), GERSL, (France, 1993), p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; one blue, a beige dress over it, and a more elaborate dark beige dress embroidered with silk threads over both. Her head was covered with a headdress under which she wore a headband made of silk. She was adorned with one earring, and a necklace garnished with mouth-blown glass pearls and two coin pieces dated to the era of the Sultan Mamluk Baybars.&lt;ref name="Liban 1993 p. 58"/&gt;

===Customs and rituals===
[[File:Pot Mari.jpg|thumb| Pot excavated from the grotto bearing the following Arabic inscription:"This belongs to Boutros from al-Hadath".]]
Compared to the mummies of Egypt, these mummies were simply buried without any long term or elaborate preparation. A preliminary observation of the mummies already reveals striking parallels with customs and rituals still practiced in present-day Lebanon. An adult woman was found buried with her eighteen-month-old child. The infant was placed at the mother's left shoulder. We are almost certain that the infant is hers since this method of burial is still practiced today in Lebanon when the deaths of both mother and child are caused by complications in the birthing process.&lt;ref name="Momies du Liban, pp. 146-210"/&gt; Most interesting of all is the adult woman who is buried with her infant. She is found with pieces of cotton and cloth inserted in both her vaginal and anal orifices. This preparation of the deceased for viewing is still practiced to our day. In some areas of Lebanon such as the Bekaa Valley, the cotton and cloth pieces are wrapped around a small onion and inserted in the human orifices. Another cultural manifestation is the presence of long black human hair found between Yasmine's toes. It probably belonged to the child's mother. Local tradition has it, that the grieving mother will pull out her hair while kissing the feet of her lost child.&lt;ref&gt;Momies du Liban, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; A talismanic prayer recovered from the grotto requests the intercession of saints in curing a sick child. This prayer resembles the ones still in practice and use among the Maronites in present-day Lebanon, e.g.,. 'Kitab Mar Antonios' -- the Talisman of Saint Anthony of Qozhayya.&lt;ref&gt;Salame-Sarkis, H. Talisman-higab Syriaque Trouve dans la Grotte-Refuge de Hadath al-Gubbeh dans le Liban Nord, "Liban Souterrain", (1989), July No.2, pp. 36-39&lt;/ref&gt; A wooden house key was found on the body of one of the adult female mummies. In accordance with traditional customs, at the funeral of the last surviving member of a family, the key to the dead person's house will be tossed over the roof of that house indicating that the house of that family will forever be closed. In this case the person died in a besieged Grotto, so the key was tossed in the grave &lt;ref&gt;Momies du Liban, pp. 46-48&lt;/ref&gt; similar circumstances mourners will comment by saying, "pity this family, their house is forever closed."

# These are the first (and perhaps the unique) mummies ever to be discovered in Lebanon.
# An outstanding and unique wooden arrow, discovered complete from tip to nock, with paper fletchings (not feathered, most likely to reduce drag and increase flight trajectory); worth-noting that other fragments of traditional wooden arrows were discovered, mostly with Turkish Nocks style.
# Many similarities exist between the burial of the mummies and some present-day Lebanese burials. For example, one of the infants had long strands of hair between its toes. According to local tradition in some areas of Lebanon today, a mother whose child dies will pull out her hair in lamentation while kissing the feet of her deceased child.{{Citation needed |date=December 2014}} Similarly, today in Lebanon, when the last member of a family dies, the key to the family house is thrown over the roof, indicating that no one will live in the house again.{{Citation needed |date=December 2014}} The presence of a key in the 'Asi-al Hadath cave may also indicate that the last member of a family had died there as well.
# Textiles were not only worn by the mummies, they were also scattered about the cave. Their robes, made from heavy cotton, are embroidered with squares and diamonds of crosses and flowers, which strongly resemble kilim patterns of Turkish nomads.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5035">In [[medicine]], the '''mean systemic pressure''' ('''mean systemic filling pressure''' (MSFP), or '''mean circulatory filling pressure''', (MCFP)) is defined as the [[arithmetic mean|mean]] [[pressure]] that exists in the [[circulatory system]] when there is no blood motion. The value of MSP in animal experimental models is approximately 7&amp;nbsp;mm of Hg. It is an indicator of how full the circulatory system is (i.e. the [[Blood volume|volume of blood]] in the system compared to the capacity of the system), and is influenced by the volume of circulating blood and the [[smooth muscle]] [[Muscle tone|tone]] in the walls of the [[Vein|venous system]] (which determines the capacity of the system).&lt;ref name="rothe"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rothe |first=CF |author= |authorlink= |date= Feb 1993|title=Mean curculatory filling pressure: its meaning and measurement. |journal=J Appl Physiol |volume=74 |series= |issue=2 |page= |pages=499–509 |publisher= |location= |issn= |pmid=8458763 |pmc= |doi= |bibcode= |oclc= |id= |url= |language= |format= |accessdate= |laysummary= |laysource= |laydate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MSP is measured in two ways experimentally, and as a result has two alternative naming conventions. MSFP is measured after clamping the aortic root and the great veins at point of entry to right atrium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Medical Physiology|author=Boron and Boulpaep|edition=2nd|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, MCFP is measured experimentally by briefly inducing [[cardiac arrest]] or naturally during [[cardiac arrest]] once the blood redistributes.

Mean systemic pressure increases if there is an increase in blood volume or if there is a decrease in venous compliance (where blood is shifted from the veins to the arteries). An increase in mean systemic pressure is reflected in a shift of the vascular function curve to the right. Mean systemic pressure is decreased by a decrease in blood volume or by an increase in venous compliance (where blood is shifted from the arteries to the veins). A decrease in mean systemic pressure is reflected in a shift of the vascular function curve to the left.

== Calculations involving MSP ==
Mean systemic pressure is defined by the stressed volume in the cardiovascular system and the overall systemic capacitance:

:&lt;math&gt;MSP = \frac{Vs}{Csys}&lt;/math&gt;

Mean systemic pressure is involved in the following calculations:

:&lt;math&gt;VR \simeq MSP - RAP&lt;/math&gt;

* VR = [[Venous return]]
* MSP = Mean systemic pressure
* RAP = [[Right atrial pressure]]

:&lt;math&gt;SVR = \frac{MSP - RAP}{CO}&lt;/math&gt;

* SVR = [[Systemic vascular resistance]]
* MSP = Mean systemic pressure
* RAP = [[Right atrial pressure]]
* CO = [[Cardiac output]]

'''Mongol elements in Western medieval art''' can be seen in European works of art ranging from the 13th to the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;The subject has been especially described by Rosamond E. Mack, in ''Bazaar to Piazza: Islamic Trade and Italian Art, 1300–1600''.&lt;/ref&gt; They encompass artistic areas such as painting and textile manufacture, and mainly consist in the European use of [[Mongol]] [['Phags-pa script]] in Medieval European art, as well as the representation of "Tartar" cloth and Mongol soldiers in a number of contemporary European paintings.

==Mongol script in medieval art==
[[File:Master Of The Isaac Stories - The Doctors of the Church (detail) - WGA14568.jpg|thumb|left|220px|[[Saint Jerome]] reading a pseudo-Mongol script, consisting of an imitation of blocks of [['Phags-pa script|'Phags-pa letters]], written horizontally rather than vertically. 1296–1300, Church of San Francesco Assisi.&lt;ref&gt;"Texts of Jerome (Fig.43; destroyed in the 1997 earthquake), Augustine, and Pope gregory I are written in squared units of vertical, horizontal, and curved strokes that can be called pseudo-Mongol. Though the artist has aligned the units horizontally on the page in Western style, the script itself imitates 'Phags Pa, which is written vertically", [https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA52 Mack, p.52]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
During the period of interaction between the Mongols and the West, from the late 13th century to early 14th century, some Italian painters incorporated Mongol script (particularly the 'Phags-pa script) into their religious painting.&lt;ref name="Mack 51"&gt;"During the Pax Mongolica a few Italian painters imitated a Mongol script called 'Phags Pa", in [https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA51 Mack p.51]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kann 94"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2dt9WrHyed4C&amp;pg=PA94 ''The art, science, and technology of medieval travel'' by Andrea Kann p.94]&lt;/ref&gt; Examples can be seen especially in the frescos of the Upper Church of San Francesco at [[Assisi]], or in the paintings of [[Giotto]] and related painters.&lt;ref name="Kann 94"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Assisi painters, and Giotto as is shown below, were imitating a Mongol script before 1307, when reports of Friar [[John of Montecorvino]]'s success in Beijing arrived in the West, precipitating major missionary efforts in central Asia and China" [https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA51 Mack, p.51]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Liu Yigong 1324.jpg|thumb|Christian tombstone from [[Quanzhou]] with Mongol [['Phags-pa script|'Phags-pa]] inscriptions, 1324.&lt;ref name="Johnson 73"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kWTDfRythVkC&amp;pg=PA73 ''Jesus on the Silk Road'' by Dale A. Johnson p.73]&lt;/ref&gt;]] 
These inscriptions often imitated the Mongol 'Phags-pa, probably discovered by the artists through Mongol paper money or ''[[paiza]]'' (travel passes) such as those [[Marco Polo]] was issued with during his travels.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA52 Mack, p.52]&lt;/ref&gt; Frescos of [[Saint Jerome]], [[Augustine]] and [[Pope Gregory I]] in the [[Basilica of San Francesco d'Assisi|Church of San Francesco]] in [[Assisi]] (1296–1300) are known where they study books written in pseudo-Mongol.&lt;ref&gt;"The texts of Jerome (Fig.43, destroyed in the 1997 earthquake), Augustine and Pope Gregory I are written in squared units of vertical, horizontal, and curved strokes that can be called pseudo-Mongol. Though the artist has aligned the units horizontally on the page in Western style, the script itself imitates 'Pags Pa, which is written vertically" in [https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA52 Mack, p.52]&lt;/ref&gt; The famous Renaissance painter Giotto and his pupils often combined Arabic and 'Phags-pa script in their paintings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA54 Mack, p.54]&lt;/ref&gt; In Giotto's ''The Crucifixion'' (1304-1312/1313), soldiers wear tunics inscribed with pseudo-Mongol bands.&lt;ref name="Mack 61"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA61 Mack, p.61]&lt;/ref&gt; In Giotto's ''Madonna and Child'' (1320–1330), the [[Virgin Mary]]'s robe is decorated with a hem in a mix of Arabic and Mongol script.&lt;ref name="Mack 61"/&gt; Giotto again used the Mongolian script in the [[Scrovegni Chapel]].&lt;ref name="Kann 94"/&gt;

Besides the influence of exchanges between the Western and Mongol realms during the period, the exact reason for the incorporation of Mongol script in early Renaissance painting is unclear. It seems that Westerners believed 13–14th century Middle-Eastern scripts (such as Mongol and Arabic) to be the same as the scripts current during [[Jesus]]'s time, and thus found it natural to represent early Christians in association with them.  This may have been partly because some objects from the Islamic era with inscriptions were treated as relics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA52 Mack, p.52], [https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA69 Mack, p.69]&lt;/ref&gt; Another reason might be that artist wished to express a cultural universality for the Christian faith, by blending together various written languages, at a time when the church had strong international ambitions.&lt;ref&gt;"Because the Arabic and 'Pag Pa were associated with the Holy Land and the Early Christian Era, the frames could emphasize the origin and age of the images they surround. Perhaps they marked the imagery of a universal faith, an artistic intention consistent with the Church's contemporary international program." [https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA69 Mack, p.69]&lt;/ref&gt; Possibly, the usage of Mongol cultural markers was also a way to express the eastern links of European religious orders such as the Franciscans.&lt;ref name="Kann 94"/&gt;

In the East, a certain degree of cultural and artistic interaction is known due to the development of [[Christianity among the Mongols]]. The use of the Mongol script in association with representations of Christianity can be seen for example in [[Nestorian Christian]] steles, such as those found in [[Quanzhou]] which are dated to the 14th century.&lt;ref name="Johnson 73"/&gt;

The use of [['Phags-pa script|Phags-pa]] Mongol script in Medieval European painting had remained unnoticed however, until it was first identified in the 1980s by the Japanese scholar Hidemichi Tanaka.&lt;ref&gt;"Hidemichi Tanaka in a brilliant insight has persuasively established that Giotto was exposed to Mongol ''Phags-pa'' script, and that he used it as a decorative motif at [[Padua]] and elsewhere." in [https://books.google.com/books?id=IRunTSqY7msC&amp;pg=PA124 Arnold, p.124]&lt;/ref&gt; His findings were published in his 1983 paper ''The Mongolian Script in Giotto Paintings at the Scrovegni Chapel at Padova''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Mongolian Script in Giotto Paintings at the Scrovegni Chapel at Padova'' in Europäische Kunst um 1300, Akten des XXV. Internationalen Kongresses für Kunstgechichte, 1983 [https://books.google.com/books?id=f1HJjUB8FhIC&amp;pg=PA96 ''The oliphant: Islamic objects in historical context'' Avinoam Shalem p.96 Note 56]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kufic]] Arabic script is even more often used in a similar way, known as [[Pseudo-Kufic]].

==Mongol Empire "Tatar" textiles in medieval art==
[[File:Simone Martini 078.jpg|thumb|'''Fig. 23''': Small-patterned Tartar-style textiles are worn by [[Gabriel|Angel Gabriel]] in the ''[[Annunciation with St Margaret and St Ansanus|Annunciation]]'' by [[Simone Martini]] (1333).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA35 Mack, p.35-36]: "A well-documented example of a delayed but creative Italian response to the new Tatar cloths is that of the tiny-pattern design, in which small leaves or plants and animals rhythmically organized in dense, allover composition. (...) During the early fourteenth century, the Angevins of Naples donated numerous Tatar cloths, including velvets, to San Franceso at Assisi. Since Simone executed the painting in Naples, the Tatar cloths, as well as Oriental carpets -also the earliest in Italian painting- and a particular crozier in Figure 65 probably represent prized artifacts at king Robert's court. Later Simone brillantly captured the vibrant shimmering effect of the tiny pattern on a white ground in the archangel Gabriel's robe in the ''Annunciation'' painted for the cathedral of Sienna in 1333 (Fig. 23)" – [https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA35 Mack, p.35]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arnold 121"&gt;"Simone Martini (...) depicted this angel wearing a robe of Mongol ''nasij'' cloth -a gold working of leaves on a white background- usually described in western inventories as ''panno tartarico albo ad floria aurea''" in [https://books.google.com/books?id=IRunTSqY7msC&amp;pg=PA121 ''Princely gifts and papal treasures'' by Lauren Arnold p.121]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Around 1300, an influx of Mongol Empire textiles found their way to Italy, and were to prove quite influential in Italian art.&lt;ref&gt;"The Pax Mongolica brought an influx of influential "Tatar" textiles into Italy about 1300 (see for example Fig. 22, 25, 32) and left its mark on fourteenth-century Italian art in Mongol figures, costumes (see Fig. 160), and script (see Fig. 43, 49) in paintings and in references to monuments along the caravan routes on the facades of the Doge's Palace in Venice (see Fig. 10)" in [https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA18 Mack, p.18]&lt;/ref&gt; These textiles even revolutionized Italian textile designs.&lt;ref&gt;"The fabrics that revolutionized Italian textile design beginning about the 1330s were the Tatar cloths arriving from Central Asia and Syria during the Pax Mongolica. Though they were foremost among imports in the Papal collections, probably thanks to [[diplomatic gift]]s from the [[Il-Khanate|Il-Khanids]] of Persia, the new imports attracted no attention from Italian painters for two more decades and from local designers for three.", in [https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA35 Mack, p.35]&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1265 and 1308, communications between Western and [[Il-Khanate|Il-Khanid]] rulers led to numerous exchanges of people and presents, as when about 100 Mongols in Mongol dress visited Rome for the [[Papal Jubilee]] of [[Pope Boniface VIII]] in 1300.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA18 Mack, p.18]&lt;/ref&gt; Large quantities of ''panni tartarici'' ([[Tatar]] cloth) were recorded in the Papal inventory of 1295, and must have been diplomatic gifts from the Il-Khanate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA18 Mack, p.18], [https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA35 Mack, p.35]&lt;/ref&gt; Later on Western merchants were also able to purchase such textiles from [[Tabriz]], and the Mongol capital of [[Sultaniya]], established by [[Öljaitü]] between 1305 and 1313, and until the capture of the [[Cilician Armenia]] harbour of [[Ayas, Adana|Ayas]] by the [[Mamluk]]s in 1347.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA16 Mack, p.16-17]&lt;/ref&gt; The Tatar cloths were a produce of transcultural exchange under Mongol rule.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA35 Mack p.35]: "Tatars cloths were themselves products of transcultural exchange. As the nomadic Mongol warriors became imperial rulers, they adopted many aspects of the sophisticated textile cultures in conquered Islamic lands and developed a preference for silk lavishly ornamented with gold threads. Customarily, the Mongols spared skilled weavers -both Muslim and Chinese- from the sword, distributed them as booty, and transported them to new workshops scattered across the empire. Captive artisans served royal courts, the military and government officials, who were often recruited from the conquered. For example, it is known that [[Herat]]i and Chinese craftsmen worked together, and some Herati were sent back to their homes in eastern Persia (now Afghanistan). The cultural mix among the imperial elite and the craftsmen working for them resulted in a rich and distinctive blend of Islamic and Chinese techniques and patterns."&lt;/ref&gt; They are described as Mongol ''nasij'' cloth, coming from Mongol, by author Lauren Arnold.&lt;ref name="Arnold 121"/&gt;

Mongol Empire textiles had a strong impact on Italian textile design from around 1330.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA35 Mack, p.35]&lt;/ref&gt; A type of Tartar cloth that was adopted in the West consisted in small-pattern designs in dense composition. This sort of textile is represented in the clothing of the angel Gabriel in the ''[[The Annunciation (Simone Martini)|Annunciation]]'' by [[Simone Martini]] (1333).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA35 Mack, p.35-36]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other designs involved naturally flowing compositions of flowers and vines with fantastic animals.&lt;ref name="Mack, p.37"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA37 Mack, p.37]&lt;/ref&gt; Such a textile is depicted as the background curtain in [[Giotto]]'s ''Coronation of the Virgin'' (circa 1330), the earliest such depiction of a Tartar cloth.&lt;ref name="Mack, p.37"/&gt; Chinese types of floral designs were also adopted, as visible in the mantles of Christ and Mary in ''Coronation of the Virgin'' by [[Paolo Veneziano]] (circa 1350).&lt;ref name="Mack, p.38"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA38 Mack, p.38]&lt;/ref&gt;

Transmission of Chinese textile designs from the Mongol [[Yuan Dynasty]] also occurred: Textiles of [[Iran]] and [[Iraq]] in the 14th century incorporated Chinese [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] designs in silk and gold thread, and Italian weavers adopted such designs from the second half of the 14th century, complete with phoenix designs and silk and gold thread. These designs are of Chinese origin, and reached Europe via the Mongol realm.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA35 Rosamond E.Mack], {{ISBN|0-520-22131-1}} p.27-49&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mongols in European painting==
[[File:Mongol tumen commander.jpg|thumb|200px|Mongol commander of a thousand troops, in [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti]]'s ''Martyrdom of the Franciscans'', 1330.]]
Mongols are visible in a variety of European paintings from the 13–14th century. They suggest that Italian artists had been in direct contact with people from [[Tartary]].&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, p.124&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Legnica.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Battle of Legnica|battle of Liegnitz]], 1241, between the Mongols (left) and European knights (right). 14th century.]]
[[File:Kublai giving support to the Venetians.JPG|thumb|left|[[Kubilai Khan]] giving financial support to the Polo family]]
As early as 1253, during the initial encounters of the Mongols with the West following the [[Mongol invasion of Europe]], [[Matthew Paris]] represented Mongol soldiers with their characteristic conical hat as [[cannibals]] in his ''[[Chronica Majora]]''.&lt;ref name="Kann 94"/&gt;

Later, the Mongols would appear in much less caricatural portrayals. The travels of [[Marco Polo]] to the [[Mongol Empire]] gave rise to opulent descriptions of the Mongol ruler [[Kublai Khan]] and his court.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KuLCCXVebuEC&amp;pg=PA36 ''America views China: American images of China then and now'' by Jonathan Goldstein,Jerry Israel,Hilary Conroy p.36]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mongols were then occasionally incorporated in the work of European painters, particularly illustrations of events in Asia or the [[Holy Land]]. Among other works, Mongol horsemen appear in the ''Crucifixion of Saint Peter'', [[Giotto]], circa 1299, probably following the visit of Mongol visitors from the East, such as the Mongol delegation who is known to have participated to the 1300 [[Papal Jubilee]] in Rome.&lt;ref name="Arnold 54"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IRunTSqY7msC&amp;pg=PA54 Arnold, p.54]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mongol archers are also shown shooting at [[Saint Sebastian|Sebastian]] in ''Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian'', [[Giovanni del Biondo]], circa 1370,&lt;ref name="Arnold, p.113"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IRunTSqY7msC&amp;pg=PA113 Arnold, p.113]&lt;/ref&gt; and Mongol commanders in uniform appear in [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti]]'s ''Martyrdom of the Franciscans'' (1285–1348) with their characteristic conical hat decorated with a feather.&lt;ref name="Kann 94"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosamond E. Mack p. 151"&gt;Rosamond E. Mack, ''Bazaar to Piazza: Islamic Trade and Italian Art 1300–1600'' ({{ISBN|0-520-22131-1}}), p. 151: "The Mongol physiognomies of the ruler and two warriors wearing tall pointed hats, however, were probably observed among emissaries whom the Il-Khanids sent to Italy during the first decades of the fourteenth century. This hat with a neck-covered flap and feather on top accurately depicts the headgear of commanders of one thousand men in the Mongol army. Such headgear might even have been seen in [[Siena]]: perhaps [[Tommaso Ugi di Siena|Tommaso Ugi]], a Sienese who had taken the name Tumen, had visited Siena when he accompanied the Il-Khanid emissaries in 1301."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mack, p.18"&gt;Mack notes the "Mongol figures and costumes" in the painting: "Mongol figures, costumes (see Fig. 160)", [https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA18 Mack, p.18]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''National Institute of Biomedical Genomics''' ('''NIBMG''') is a national level research institute for [[genomic medicine]]. It is located at [[Kalyani, West Bengal|Kalyani]] [[West Bengal]]—50&amp;nbsp;km from [[Kolkata]].&lt;ref name="AIIMSKalyani"&gt;{{cite news|title=Land inspection for AIIMS Kalyani soon |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/Land-inspection-for-AIIMS-Kalyani-soon/articleshow/41722766.cms |date=5 September 2014 |work=[[Times of India]] |location=Kolkata |accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been established as an autonomous institution under the [[Department of Biotechnology]], [[Government of India]]. This is the first institution in India explicitly devoted to research, training, translation and service and capacity-building in biomedical genomics.

The Institute is now functioning from its permanent campus constructed on a 30-acre plot of land near Bidhanpally, Kalyani.

This is the first institution in India explicitly devoted to research, training, translation &amp; service and capacity-building in Biomedical Genomics. One of the objectives of NIBMG is to create necessary physical infrastructure to serve as the expert base for the principles and practise of Biomedical Genomics. The Institute has, already created a formidable capacity for ultra-fast DNA and RNA sequencing, the largest in any academic institution in India; created two global records of sequence data generation in a single experiment within a short period of time, breaking the previous records held by an American Genomics Company; generated data equivalent to about 10,000 human genomes in the last five years, cutting costs of sequencing using various innovative experimental approaches; formed a research platform to facilitate pursuit of Biomedical Genomics at the national level by opening up its core facilities to universities and other national labs. Another major objective of the Institute is to conduct and promote cutting-edge research in Biomedical Genomics, for impactful translation of genomics-driven approach to public health improvement.

NIBMG has embarked on identifying genomic underpinnings of two cancer types, oral and cervical, that are most common among males and females, respectively, of our country. The Institute is the co-ordinating centre and the genomics experimental laboratory for the India component of the International Cancer Genome Consortium. The Institute has also made significant contributions to genomics of chronic and infectious diseases, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, chronic pancreatitis, sepsis, latency in tuberculosis, etc. Promoting life-course epidemiology and population awareness is a major programme of the Institute. To identify how genes and environmental factors interact in precipitating diseases, the Institute has formed a population cohort of 50,000 individuals, who are being followed up regularly, with blood and clinical profiling being done. This understanding will help prevent diseases by controlling relevant environmental factors. Awareness camps to prevent diseases are being regularly organized in the cohort.

The Institute has taken genomic laboratories and genetic testing to the doorsteps of clinicians by establishing a unit in the largest tertiary care government hospital in Kolkata, the SSKM Hospital. The Institute has collaborative projects with many national institutions, such as, Translational Health Science &amp; Technology Institute (THSTI), Center for Cell &amp; Molecular Biology (CCMB) etc. and with global biotech institutions and industry, such as, European Bioinformatics Institute, University of Chicago, Genentech, Unilever, etc&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dbtindia.nic.in/inauguration-of-the-new-campus-of-nibmg/ |title=Inauguration of the New Campus of NIBMG at Kalyani, West Bengal |date=7 May 2018 |access-date=20 October 2018 |website=www.dbtindia.nic.in}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3926">'''Nekton''' or '''necton''' refers to the aggregate of actively swimming [[aquatic life|aquatic organisms]] in a body of water. The term was proposed by German biologist [[Ernst Haeckel]] to differentiate between the active swimmers in a body of water, and the passive organisms that were carried along by the current, the [[plankton]]. As a guideline, nektonic organisms have a high [[Reynolds number]] (greater than 1000) and planktonic organisms a low one (less than 10). However, some organisms can begin life as plankton and transition to nekton later on in life, sometimes making distinction difficult when attempting to classify certain plankton-to-nekton species as one or the other. For this reason, some biologists choose not to use this term. 

==History==
The term was first proposed and used by the German biologist [[Ernst Haeckel]] in 1891 in his article ''Plankton-Studien'' where he contrasted it with [[plankton]], the aggregate of passively floating, drifting, or somewhat motile organisms present in a body of water, primarily tiny [[algae]] and [[bacteria]], small eggs and larvae of marine organisms, and [[protozoa]] and other minute consumers.  Today it is sometimes considered an obsolete term because it often does not allow for the meaningful quantifiable distinction between these two groups.  Some biologists no longer use it.&lt;ref name="Aleyev1977"&gt;{{cite book|title=Nekton|last1=Aleyev|first1=Yu. G.|year=1977|doi=10.1007/978-94-010-1324-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haeckel, E. 1891. Plankton-Studien. ''Jenaische Zeitschrift für Naturwissenschaft'' 25 / (Neue Folge) 18: 232-336. [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/11963729 BHL].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
As a guideline, nekton are larger and tend to swim largely at biologically high [[Reynolds number]]s (&gt;10³ and up beyond 10⁹), where inertial flows are the rule, and eddies (vortices) are easily shed. Plankton, on the other hand, are small and, if they swim at all, do so at biologically low Reynolds numbers (0.001 to 10), where the viscous behavior of water dominates, and reversible flows are the rule. Organisms such as [[jellyfish]] and others are considered plankton when they are very small and swim at low Reynolds numbers, and considered nekton as they grow large enough to swim at high Reynolds numbers.  Many animals considered classic examples of nekton (e.g., ''[[Mola mola]]'', [[squid]], [[marlin]]) start out life as tiny members of the plankton and then, it was argued, gradually transition to nekton as they grow.

== Oceanic nekton ==
Oceanic nekton comprises animals largely from three [[clade]]s:
*[[Vertebrata|Vertebrates]] form the largest contribution; these animals are supported by either [[bone]]s or [[cartilage]].
*[[Mollusca|Mollusks]] are animals such as [[squid]]s and [[scallop]]s.
*[[Crustacea]]ns are animals such as [[lobsters]] and [[crab]]s.

There are organisms whose initial life stage is identified as being planktonic but when they grow and increase in body size they become nektonic. A typical example is the [[Medusa (biology)|medusa]] of the jellyfish.

'''Network architecture''' is the design of a [[communication network]]. It is a framework for the specification of a network's [[Physical layer|physical components]] and their functional organization and configuration, its operational principles and procedures, as well as [[data type|data formats]] used. In [[telecommunication]], the specification of a network architecture may also include a detailed description of products and services delivered via a communications network, as well as detailed rate and billing structures under which services are compensated.

The network architecture of the [[Internet]] is predominantly expressed by its use of the [[Internet Protocol Suite]], rather than a specific model for interconnecting networks or nodes in the network, or the usage of specific types of hardware links.

== OSI network model ==
{{OSI model}}
{{main|OSI model}}

The [[OSI model|Open Systems Interconnection model]] (OSI model) is a product of the Open Systems Interconnection effort at the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). OSI defines and codifies the concept of layered network architecture. It is a way of sub-dividing a communications system further into smaller parts called layers. A layer is a collection of similar functions that provide services to the layer above it and receives services from the layer below it. On each layer, an instance provides services to the instances at the layer above and requests service from the layer below.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/OSI|title=What is OSI model (Open Systems Interconnection)? - Definition from WhatIs.com|last=|first=|date=|work=SearchNetworking|access-date=2018-10-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distributed computing ==
{{main|Distributed computing}}

In distinct usage in [[distributed computing]], the term "network architecture" often describes the structure and classification of a distributed application architecture, as the participating nodes in a distributed application are often referred to as a "network". For example, the [[applications architecture]] of the [[public switched telephone network]] (PSTN) has been termed the [[Advanced Intelligent Network]]. There are any number of specific classifications but all lie on a continuum between the [[dumb network]] (e.g. [[Internet]]) and the [[intelligent computer network]] (e.g. the telephone network). Other networks contain various elements of these two classical types to make them suitable for various types of applications. Recently the [[context aware network]], which is a synthesis of  two, has gained much interest with its ability to combine the best elements of both.

A popular example of such usage of the term in distributed applications, as well as PVCs (permanent virtual circuits), is the organization of nodes in [[P2P network|peer-to-peer (P2P) services and networks]]. P2P networks usually implement overlay networks running over an underlying physical or logical network. These overlay network may implement certain organizational structures of the nodes according to several distinct models, the network architecture of the system.

Network architecture is a broad plan that specifies everything necessary for two application programs on different networks on an Internet to be able to work together effectively.

[[File:Praezession.svg|thumb|170px|{{colorbox|green}} Rotation, {{colorbox|blue}} precession, and {{colorbox|red}} nutation in obliquity of a planet]]

'''Nutation''' (from [[Latin]] ''nūtātiō'', "nodding, swaying") is a rocking, swaying, or nodding motion in the [[axis of rotation]] of a largely axially symmetric object, such as a [[gyroscope]], [[planet]], or [[bullet]] [[external ballistics|in flight]], or as an intended behaviour of a mechanism. In an appropriate [[frame of reference|reference frame]] it can be defined as a change in the second [[Euler angles#Euler rotations|Euler angle]]. If it is not caused by forces external to the body, it is called ''free nutation'' or ''[[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] nutation''.&lt;ref name=Lowrie/&gt; A ''pure nutation'' is a movement of a rotational axis such that the first Euler angle is constant.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} In spacecraft dynamics, [[precession]] (a change in the first Euler angle) is sometimes referred to as nutation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kasdin|first=N. Jeremy|title=Engineering dynamics : a comprehensive introduction|date=2010|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=Princeton, N.J.|isbn=9780691135373|pages=526–527|author2=Paley, Derek A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rigid body==
{{further|rigid body dynamics}}
If a [[top]] is set at a tilt on a horizontal surface and spun rapidly, its rotational axis starts precessing about the vertical. After a short interval, the top settles into a motion in which each point on its rotation axis follows a circular path. The vertical force of gravity produces a horizontal torque {{math|'''&amp;tau;'''}} about the point of contact with the surface; the top rotates in the direction of this torque with an angular velocity {{math|'''&amp;Omega;'''}} such that at any moment
:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\tau} = \mathbf{\Omega} \times \mathbf{L},&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''L'''}} is the instantaneous angular momentum of the top.&lt;ref name=Feynman&gt;{{harvnb|Feynman|Leighton|Sands|2011|pp=20–7{{clarify|date=December 2013}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, however, there is no precession, and the top falls straight downward. This gives rise to an imbalance in torques that starts the precession. In falling, the top overshoots the level at which it would precess steadily and then oscillates about this level. This oscillation is called ''nutation''. If the motion is damped, the oscillations will die down until the motion is a steady precession.&lt;ref name=Feynman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Goldstein220&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|p=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The physics of nutation in tops and [[gyroscope]]s can be explored using the model of a ''heavy symmetrical top'' with its tip fixed. Initially, the effect of friction is ignored. The motion of the top can be described by three [[Euler angles]]: the tilt angle {{math|''&amp;theta;''}} between the symmetry axis of the top and the vertical; the [[azimuth]] {{math|''&amp;phi;''}} of the top about the vertical; and the rotation angle {{math|''&amp;psi;''}} of the top about its own axis. Thus, precession is the change in {{math|''&amp;phi;''}} and nutation is the change in {{math|''&amp;theta;''}}.&lt;ref name=Goldstein217&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the top has mass {{math|''M''}} and its [[center of mass]] is at a distance {{math|''l''}} from the pivot point, its [[gravitational potential]] relative to the plane of the support is
:&lt;math&gt;V = Mgl\cos(\theta).&lt;/math&gt;

In a coordinate system where the {{math|''z''}} axis is the axis of symmetry, the top has [[angular velocity|angular velocities]] {{math|''&amp;omega;''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''&amp;omega;''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''&amp;omega;''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} and [[moments of inertia]] {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} about the {{math|''x'', ''y''}}, and {{math|''z''}} axes. The [[kinetic energy]] is
:&lt;math&gt;E_\text{r} = \frac{1}{2}I_1\left(\omega_1^2 + \omega_2^2\right) + \frac{1}{2}I_3\omega_3^2.&lt;/math&gt;

In terms of the Euler angles, this is
:&lt;math&gt;E_\text{r} = \frac{1}{2}I_1\left(\dot{\theta}^2 + \dot{\phi}^2\sin^2(\theta)\right) + \frac{1}{2}I_3\left(\dot{\psi} + \dot{\phi}\cos(\theta)\right)^2.&lt;/math&gt;

If the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Euler–Lagrange equations]] are solved for this system, it is found that the motion depends on two constants {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} (each related to a [[constant of motion]]). The rate of precession is related to the tilt by
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\phi} = \frac{b - a\cos(\theta)}{\sin^2(\theta)}.&lt;/math&gt;

The tilt is determined by a differential equation for {{math|''u'' {{=}} cos(''&amp;theta;'')}} of the form
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{u}^2 = f(u)&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''f''}} is a [[cubic function|cubic polynomial]] that depends on parameters {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} as well as constants that are related to the energy and the gravitational torque. The roots of {{math|''f''}} are [[cosine]]s of the angles at which the [[time derivative|rate of change]] of {{math|''&amp;theta;''}} is zero. One of these is not related to a physical angle; the other two determine the upper and lower bounds on the tilt angle, between which the gyroscope oscillates.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|pp=213–217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Astronomy==
{{main|Astronomical nutation}}
The nutation of a planet happens because of gravitational attraction of other bodies that cause the [[precession of the equinoxes]] to vary over time so that the speed of precession is not constant. The nutation of the [[Earth's rotation|axis of the Earth]] was discovered in 1728 by the English astronomer [[James Bradley]].

==Earth==
{{further|geodynamics}}
[[File:Trópico de Cáncer en México - Carretera 83 (Vía Corta) Zaragoza-Victoria, Km 27+800.jpg|thumb|240px|Yearly changes in the location of the [[Tropic of Cancer]] near a highway in Mexico]]

Nutation makes a small change to the angle at which the Earth tilts with respect to the Sun, changing the location of the [[Circle of latitude#Major circles of latitude|major circles of latitude]] that are defined by the Earth's tilt (the [[tropical circle]]s and the [[polar circle]]s).

In the case of the Earth, the principal sources of tidal force are the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]], which continuously change location relative to each other and thus cause nutation in Earth's axis. The largest component of Earth's nutation has a period of 18.6 years, the same as that of the precession of the [[Lunar node|Moon's orbital nodes]].&lt;ref name=Lowrie&gt;{{cite book|last=Lowrie|first=William|title=Fundamentals of geophysics|date=2007|publisher=[[Cambridge Univ. Press]]|location=Cambridge [u.a.]|isbn=9780521675963|pages=58–59|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are other significant periodic terms that must be accounted for depending upon the desired accuracy of the result. A mathematical description (set of equations) that represents nutation is called a "theory of nutation". In the theory, parameters are adjusted in a more or less ''ad hoc'' method to obtain the best fit to data. Simple [[rigid body dynamics]] do not give the best theory; one has to account for deformations of the Earth, including [[asthenosphere|mantle inelasticity]] and changes in the [[core–mantle boundary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iers.org/nn_10382/IERS/EN/Science/Recommendations/resolutionB3.html |title=Resolution 83 on non-rigid Earth nutation theory |work=[[International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service]] |publisher=Federal Agency for Cartography and Geodesy |date=2 April 2009 |accessdate=6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal term of nutation is due to the regression of the Moon's [[nodal line]] and has the same period of 6798 days (18.61 years). It reaches plus or minus 17&amp;Prime; in [[longitude]] and 9.2&amp;Prime; in [[Axial tilt|obliquity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/basics/bsf2-1.php#nutation|title = Basics of Space Flight, Chapter 2|date = 2013-10-29|accessdate = 2015-03-26|website = Jet Propulsion Laboratory|publisher = Jet Propulsion Laboratory/NASA|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; All other terms are much smaller; the next-largest, with a period of 183 days (0.5 year), has amplitudes 1.3&amp;Prime; and 0.6&amp;Prime; respectively. The periods of all terms larger than 0.0001&amp;Prime; (about as accurately as one{{who|date=May 2018}} can measure) lie between 5.5 and 6798 days; for some reason (as with ocean tidal periods) they seem to avoid the range from 34.8 to 91 days, so it is customary to split the nutation into long-period and short-period terms. The long-period terms are calculated and mentioned in the almanacs, while the additional correction due to the short-period terms is usually taken from a table.

==In popular culture==
In the 1961 movie ''[[The Day the Earth Caught Fire]]'', the near-simultaneous detonation of two super-hydrogen bombs near the poles causes a change in the Earth's nutation, as well as an 11 degree shift in the axis of rotation and a change in the Earth's orbit around the Sun.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14171">'''Nutritional rating systems''' are methods of ranking or rating food products or food categories to communicate the nutritional value of food in a simplified manner to a target audience. Rating systems are developed by governments, nonprofit organizations, or private institutions and companies.

The methods may use point systems to rank or rate foods for general nutritional value or they may rate specific food attributes such as [[cholesterol]] content. Graphics or other symbols may be used to communicate the ratings to the target audience.

Nutritional rating systems differ from [[Nutrition facts label|nutritional labeling]] in that they attempt to simplify food choices, rather than listing specific amounts of nutrients or ingredients. [[Dietary guidelines]] are similar to nutritional rating systems in that they attempt to simplify the communication of nutritional information, however, they do not rate individual food products.

== Systems in use today ==

===Glycemic index===
[[Glycemic index]] is a ranking of how quickly [[food]] is metabolized into [[glucose]] when digested. It compares available [[carbohydrate]]s gram for gram in individual foods, providing a numerical, evidence-based index of postprandial (post-meal) [[Blood sugar|glycemia]]. The concept was invented by Dr. [[David J. Jenkins]] and colleagues in 1981 at the [[University of Toronto]].&lt;ref&gt;Brouns ''et al.'' (2005). "Glycaemic index methodology." ''Nutrition Research Reviews'' '''18'''; 145-171&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[glycemic load]] (GL) of food is a number that estimates how much the food will raise a person's [[blood glucose level]] after eating it.

===Guiding Stars===
Guiding Stars is patented food rating system that rates food based on [[nutrient density]] using a scientific [[algorithm]]. Foods are credited for [[vitamins]], minerals, [[dietary fibre]], whole grains, and [[Omega-3 fatty acids]], and debited for [[saturated fats]], [[trans fats]], added sodium ([[salt]]) and [[added sugar]]. Rated foods are marked with tags indicating one, two or three stars. The  program first launched a Hannaford Supermarkets in 2006, and is currently found in about 1,900 supermarkets in the US and Canada. Guiding Stars has also expanded into public schools, colleges and hospitals.&lt;ref name="guidingstars"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://guidingstars.ca/about/ | title=About | publisher=Guiding Stars Licensing Company | accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evidence-based proprietary algorithm is based on the dietary guidelines and recommendations of regulatory and health organizations including the US [[Food and Drug Administration]], the [[US Department of Agriculture]], and the [[World Health Organization]]. It was developed by a scientific advisory panel composed of experts in nutrition and health from [[Dartmouth College]], [[Harvard University]], [[Tufts University]], [[University of North Carolina]] and other colleges.&lt;ref name="guidingstars" /&gt;

===Nutripoints===
Nutripoints&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nutripoints.com/ |title=nutripoints.com |publisher=nutripoints.com |accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a system for rating foods on a numerical scale for their overall nutritional value. The method is based on an analysis of 26 positive (such as vitamins, minerals, protein, fiber) and negative factors (such as cholesterol, saturated fat, sugar, sodium) compared to the calories in the food. The overall Nutripoint score of the food is the result. The higher the value, the more nutrition per calorie (nutrient density) and the least negative factors in the food. Thus, the higher the Nutripoint score, the better the food for overall health. The system rates 3600+ foods including basic foods like apples and oranges, fast-foods, and brand-name foods.

Nutripoints was developed by Dr. Roy E. Vartabedian (a Doctor of Public Health) in the 1980s and was released to the general public in 1990 with his book, "Nutripoints," published in 13 countries and 10 languages worldwide. The food rating system is part of an overall program designed to help people measure, balance, and upgrade their diet's nutritional quality for overall health improvement and well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nutripoints: Healthy Eating Made Simple! (1990&amp;ndash;2010) |url= http://www.nutripoints.com/  |publisher= Nutripoints.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nutrition iQ===
The Nutrition iQ program is a joint venture of the Joslin Clinic and multi-banner supermarket operator [[SuperValu (United States)|Supervalu]].  The labeling system consists of color-coded tags denoting a food product's superior status with respect to attributes such as vitamin and mineral content, fiber content, 100% juice content, Omega-3 or low saturated fat content, whole grain content, calcium content, protein content, low or reduced sodium content and low or reduced caloric content.  The first phase of the program launched in 2009 covering center store food products, with coverage of fresh food departments rolling out in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110113005149/en/Fresh-Ideas-Healthy-Eating-SUPERVALU%C2%AE-Expands-%E2%80%9Cnutrition |title=Fresh Ideas for Healthy Eating: SUPERVALU Expands "nutrition iQ" Program, SUPERVALU, January 13, 2011 |publisher=Businesswire.com |date=2011-01-13 |accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===POINTS Food System===
[[Weight Watchers]] developed the POINTS Food System for use with their Flex Plan. Healthy weight control is the primary objective of the system. The system is designed to allow customers to eat any food while tracking the number of points for each food consumed. Members try to keep to their POINTS Target, a number of points for a given time frame. The daily POINTS Target is personalized based on members' height, weight and other factors, such as gender. A weekly allowance for points is also established to provide for special occasions, mistakes, etc.&lt;ref name=WeightWatchers&gt;{{cite journal |author=WeightWatchers website. |title=The Flex plan and the Core Plan: Food plans tailored to fit your life. |journal=weightwatchers.com |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naturally Nutrient Rich (NNR) ===
Developed by [[Adam Drewnowski]], University of Washington, NNR&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Drewnowski|first=Adam|title=Concept of a nutritious food: toward a nutrient density score|url=http://www.ajcn.org/content/82/4/721.abstract|publisher=American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|accessdate=Jan 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "is based on mean percentage daily values (DVs) for 14 nutrients in 2000 kcal food, can be used to assign nutrient density values to foods within and across food groups. Use of the NNR score allows consumers to identify and select nutrient-dense foods while permitting some flexibility where the discretionary calories are concerned."

===ReViVer Score===
Developed by ReViVer, a nutritionally-oriented restaurant in New York City,&lt;ref name="Walt Street Journal"&gt;[https://online.wsj.com/articles/reviver-serves-healthy-food-backed-by-science-1407203647/ "ReViVer Serves Healthy Food Backed By Science"] ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', August 4, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  the ReViVer Score expresses the nutrient density of menu items from a variety of fast food and casual restaurants, based on the amount of 10 nutrients (Vitamins A, C, and E, folate, calcium, magnesium, potassium, iron, fiber, and omega-3 fats) per calorie. A score of 100 indicates that the meal provides at least 100% of the recommended daily intake for all ten nutrients, proportionate to the energy (calorie) content of the meal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The ReViVer Score|url=http://revivernyc.com#TheReviverScore |accessdate=Aug 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The score allows consumers to compare the nutritional quality of various restaurant offerings with similar calorie content.

===Nutrient Per Calorie===
Developed by Efficiency Is Everything, a Data Science website.&lt;ref name="Efficiency Is Everything"&gt;[http://efficiencyiseverything.com/nutrient-per-calorie/ "Nutrients Per Calorie – Math Proves The Healthiest Lowest Calorie Foods"] ''[[Efficiency Is Everything]]'', October 18, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  This expresses the amount of micronutrients in produce per the caloric value based on 40+ vitamins and minerals. Based off a sum of each nutrient vs that nutrients maximum value per calorie, Spinach, Parsely, Romaine Lettuce, and turnip greens top the list. This allows consumers to compare the nutritional quality of various produce.

==Systems used in the past==

===Smart Choices Program===
Launched late in 2009, the Smart Choices Program (SCP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Smart Choices Program|url=http://www.smartchoicesprogram.com/|accessdate=Jan 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a rating system developed by a coalition of companies from the food industry. The criteria for rating food products used 18 different attributes, however, the system had varying levels of acceptability based on 16 types of food which allowed for wide discretion in the selection of foods to include in the program. The program was discontinued in October 2009 after sharp criticism for including products such as "Froot Loops", "Lucky Charms" and "Frosted Flakes" as Smart Choices.&lt;ref name"smart choice"&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0458-3035| last = MacVean| first = Mary| title = 'Smart Choice' food label: a sign of nutrition or marketing?| work = Los Angeles Times| date = 2009-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=suspended&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Neuman| first = William| title = ‘Smart Choices’ Food Labeling Loses Support| work = The New York Times| accessdate = 2018-08-24| date = 2009-10-23| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/24/business/24food.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of the backlash from the program, [[General Mills]] announced on December 10, 2009 that it would reduce the amount of sugar in many of its cereal brands.

====Announcement of Closure====
On August 19, 2009, the FDA wrote a letter to SCP manager, saying: "FDA and FSIS would be concerned if any FOP labeling systems used criteria that were not stringent enough to protect consumers against misleading claims; were inconsistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans; or had the effect of encouraging consumers to choose highly processed foods and refined grains instead of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Michael R.|author2=Jerold R. Mande |title=Label Claims - Letter to the Smart Choces Program|url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/LabelingNutrition/LabelClaims/ucm180146.htm|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|date=August 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; SCP was suspended in 2009 after the FDA's announcement that they will be addressing both on front-of- package and on-shelf systems. SCP Chair Mike Hughes said: "It is more appropriate to postpone active operations and channel our information and learnings to the agency to support their initiative."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hughes|first=Mike|title=Smart Choices Program Postpones Active Operations|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/smart-choices-program-postpones-active-operations-65809752.html|publisher=PR Newswire|accessdate=Jan 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Claimed Rigor====
Smart Choices Program "was developed by a coalition of scientists and nutrition educators, experts with experience with dietary guidelines, public health organizations, and food manufacturers in response to consumer confusion over multiple front-of-the-package systems based on different criteria. Representatives from different government organizations acted as observers. The process of developing the program was facilitated by the nonprofit Keystone Center, an organization that develops consensus solutions to complex health and social policy changes. The nutrition criteria for receiving the SCP icon are specific for product category by indicating "smarter" products within that category. A calorie indicator noting calories per serving and servings per package accompanies the SCP icon to remind consumers that calories do count, even for smarter food choices. For a product to qualify, it first has to be below the threshold for "nutrients to limit" and then (in most cases) it must be above the threshold for one or more nutrients or food groups to encourage. The criteria are based on the 2005 Dietary Guidelines and other consensus science and are transparent and available on the SCP website."

An '''only child''' is a person with no [[sibling]]s, either [[biological]] or [[adoption|adopted]]. The term ''only child'' is generally applied only to those individuals who don't have siblings. 

Some children may have half-siblings or step-siblings, either living at the same house or a different house - especially those who were born considerably later - may have a similar family environment to only children, as may children who have younger siblings from both of the same parents (generally ten or more years).

== Overview ==
Throughout history, only children were relatively uncommon. From around the middle of the 20th century, [[birth rate]]s and average family sizes fell sharply, for a number of reasons including increasing costs of raising children and more women having their first child later in life.

From 1979 to 2015, the [[one-child policy]] in the [[China|People's Republic of China]] restricted most parents to having only one child, although it was subject to local relaxations and individual circumstances (for instance when twins were conceived).&lt;ref&gt;Rocha da Silva, Pascal (2006).

Families may have an only child for a variety of reasons, including: personal preference, [[family planning]], financial and emotional or physical health issues, desire to travel, stress in the family, educational advantages, late marriage, stability, focus, time constraints, fears over pregnancy, advanced age, illegitimate birth, [[infertility]], [[divorce]], and death of a sibling or parent. The premature death of one parent also contributed to a small percentage of marriages producing just one child until around the mid 20th century, not to mention the then rare occurrence of divorce. 

Only children are sometimes said to be more likely to develop precocious interests (from spending more time with adults) and to feel [[loneliness|lonely]].&lt;ref name=onlies/&gt; Sometimes they compensate for the aloneness by developing a stronger relationship with themselves&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/09/opinion/sunday/only-children-lonely-and-selfish.html |title=Only Children: Lonely and Selfish? |author=Sandler, Lauren |date=8 June 2013 |publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; or developing an active fantasy life that includes [[imaginary friend]]s.

== Stereotypes ==
In Western countries, only children can be the subject of a stereotype that equates them with "[[spoiled brat]]s". [[G. Stanley Hall]] was one of the first commentators to give only children a bad reputation when he referred to their situation as "a disease in itself". Even today, only children are commonly stereotyped as "spoiled, selfish, and bratty".&lt;ref name="ABC News"&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=3488411&amp;page=1 The Only Child Myth], By Juju Chang and Sara Holmberg, ABC News, Retrieved on August 25th, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; While many only children receive a lot of attention and resources for their development, it is not clear that as a class they are overindulged or differ significantly from children with siblings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2002382,00.html "The Only Child: Debunking the Myths"].

The popular media often posit that it is more difficult for only children to cooperate in a conventional family environment, as they have no competitors for the attention of their parents and other relatives. It is suggested that confusion arises about the norms of ages and roles and that a similar effect exists in understanding during relationships with other peers and youth, all throughout life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parents.com/parenting/better-parenting/style/10-tips-for-parenting-only-children/ "10 Tips for Parenting Only Children"].

== Scientific research ==
A 1987 [[meta-analysis|quantitative review]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Polit |first=D. F. |lastauthoramp=yes |last2=Falbo |first2=T. |year=1987 |title=Only children and personality development: A quantitative review |journal=Journal of Marriage and the Family |volume=49 |issue= |pages=309–325 |doi=10.2307/352302 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; of 141 studies on 16 different personality traits failed to support the opinion, held by theorists including [[Alfred Adler]], that only children are more likely to be maladjusted due to pampering.&lt;ref&gt;Adler, A. (1964). ''Problems of neurosis''. New York: Harper and Row.&lt;/ref&gt; The study found no evidence of any greater prevalence of maladjustment in only children. The only statistically significant difference discovered was that only children possessed a higher achievement motivation, which Polit and Falbo attributed to their greater share of parental resources, expectations, and scrutiny exposing them to a greater degree of reward, and greater likelihood of punishment for falling short. A second analysis by the authors revealed that only children, children with only one sibling, and first-borns in general, score higher on tests of verbal ability than later-borns and children with multiple siblings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Polit |first=D. F. |lastauthoramp=yes |last2=Falbo |first2=T. |year=1988 |title=The intellectual achievement of only children |journal=Journal of Biosocial Science |volume=20 |issue= |pages=275–285 |doi=10.1017/S0021932000006611 |pmid=3063715}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Resource Dilution Model,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Downey |first=D. B. |year=2001 |title=Number of siblings and intellectual development: The resource dilution explanation |journal=American Psychologist |volume=56 |issue= |pages=497–504 |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.56.6-7.497 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; parental resources (e.g. time to read to the child) are important in development. Because these resources are finite, children with many siblings are thought to receive fewer resources.  However, the Confluence Model&lt;ref name="confluence"&gt;{{Citation |last=Zajonc |first=R. B. |last2=Markus |first2=Gregory B. |year=1975 |title=Birth Order and Intellectual Development |journal=Psychological Review |volume=82 |issue=1 |pages=74–88 |doi=10.1037/h0076229 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests there is an opposing effect from the benefits to the non-youngest children of tutoring younger siblings, though being tutored does not make up the reduced share of parental resources. This provides one explanation for the poorer performance on tests of ability of only children compared to first-borns, commonly seen in the literature,&lt;ref name="confluence"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tutoring"&gt;{{Citation |last=Falbo |first=Toni |year=1978 |title=Sibling Tutoring and Other Explanations for Intelligence Discontinuities of Only and Last Borns |journal=Journal of Population |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=349–363 |doi=10.2307/27507586}}.&lt;/ref&gt; though explanations such as the increased and earlier likelihood of experiencing parental separation or loss for last-born and only children have also been suggested, as this may be the cause of their very status.&lt;ref name="tutoring"/&gt;

In his book ''Maybe One'',&lt;ref name=McKibben&gt;{{Citation |last=McKibben |first=B. |year=1998 |title=Maybe one: A personal and environmental argument for single-child families |location=New York |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn=0-684-85281-0 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; the environmental campaigner [[Bill McKibben]] argues in favor of a voluntary one child policy on the grounds of climate change and overpopulation. He reassures the reader with a narrative constructed from interviews with researchers and writers on only children, combined with snippets from the research literature, that this would not be harmful to child development. He argues that most cultural stereotypes are false, that there are not many differences between only children and other children, and where there are differences, they are favorable to the only child.

Most research on only children has been [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] and focused on the behaviour of only-children and on how others, for example teachers, assess that behaviour. Bernice Sorensen, in contrast, used [[qualitative methods]] in order to elicit meaning and to discover what only-children themselves understand, feel or sense about their lives that are lived without siblings. Her research showed that during their life span only children often become more aware of their only child status and are very much affected by society's stereotype of the only-child whether or not the stereotype is true or false. She argues in her book, ''Only Child Experience and Adulthood'', that growing up in a predominantly sibling society affects only children and that their lack of sibling relationships can have an important effect on both the way they see themselves and others and how they interact with the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Sorensen |first=B. |year=2008 |title=Only Child Experience and Adulthood |location=Hampshire |publisher=Palgrave MacMillan |pages=164–195 |isbn=0-230-52101-0 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest research by Cameron et al. (2011) controls for endogeneity associated with being only children. Parents that choose to have only one child could differ systematically in their characteristics from parents who choose to have more than one child. The paper concludes that "those who grew up as only children as a consequence of the (one-child) policy (in China) are found to be less trusting, less trustworthy, less likely to take risks, and less competitive than if they had had siblings. They are also less optimistic, less conscientious, and more prone to neuroticism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Cameron |first=Lisa |last2=Erkal |first2=N. |last3=Gangadharan |first3=L. |lastauthoramp=yes |last4=Meng |first4=Xin |year=2011 |title=Little Emperors—Behavioral Impacts of China’s One-Child Policy (University of Melbourne)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, according to Professor Cameron, it was found that "greater exposure to other children in childhood – for example, frequent interactions with cousins and/or attending childcare – was not a substitute for having siblings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=January 10, 2013|title=Effects of China's One Child Policy on its children |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/01/130110142131.htm|newspaper=Science Daily |location= |access-date=December 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Born to Rebel'', [[Frank Sulloway]] provides evidence that [[birth order]] influences the development of the "[[big five personality traits]]" (also known as the Five Factor Model). Sulloway suggests that firstborns and only children are more conscientious, more socially dominant, less agreeable, and less open to new ideas compared to laterborns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Sulloway |first=F. J. |year=1996 |title=Born to rebel: Birth order, family dynamics and creative lives |location=New York |publisher=Pantheon Books |isbn=0-679-44232-4 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, his conclusions have been challenged by other researchers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Harris |first=J. R. |year=2006 |title=No two alike: Human nature and human individuality |location=New York |publisher=WW Norton &amp; Company |isbn=0-393-05948-0 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; who argue that birth order effects are weak and inconsistent. In one of the largest studies conducted on the effect of birth order on the Big Five, data from a national sample of 9,664 subjects found no association between birth order and scores on the [[NEO PI-R]] personality test.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Jefferson |first=T. |last2=Herbst |first2=J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6433">'''PCLake''' is a dynamic, [[mathematical model]] used to study [[eutrophication]] effects in shallow [[lake]]s and ponds. PCLake models explicitly the most important [[Biotic component|biotic]] groups and their interrelations, within the general framework of [[nutrient cycle]]s. PCLake is used both by scientist and water managers.

==Background==
Typically, shallow lakes are in one of two contrasting [[alternative stable state]]s:&lt;ref&gt;Scheffer M, 1993. Alternative equilibria in shallow lakes. Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution 8: 275–-279&lt;/ref&gt;  a clear state with submerged macrophytes and piscivorous fish, or a turbid state dominated by phytoplankton and benthivorous fish. A switch from one state to the other is largely driven by the input of nutrients ([[phosphorus]] and [[nitrogen]]) to the ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;Janse JH, 1997. A model of nutrient dynamics in shallow lakes in relation to multiple stable states. Hydrobiologia 342/343: 1–8&lt;/ref&gt; If the nutrient loading exceeds a critical value, eutrophication causes a switch from the clear to the turbid state. As a result of urban water pollution and/or [[intensive agriculture]] in [[drainage basin|catchment areas]], many of the world’s shallow lakes and ponds are in a eutrophic state with turbid waters and poor ecological quality. In this turbid state, the lake also becomes subject to algal blooms of toxic [[cyanobacteria]] (also called blue-green algae). Recovery of the clear state however is difficult as the critical nutrient loading for the switch back is often found to be lower than the critical loading towards the turbid state. Lowering the nutrient input thus does not automatically lead to a switch back to the clear water phase. Hence, the system shows [[hysteresis]].

==Application==
PCLake is designed to study the effects of eutrophication on shallow lakes and ponds.&lt;ref&gt;Janse JH, 2005. Model studies on the eutrophication of shallow lakes and ditches. PhD thesis. Wageningen University&lt;/ref&gt; On one hand, the model is used by scientists to study the general behavior of these ecosystems. For example, PCLake is used to understand the phenomena of alternative stable states and hysteresis, and in that light, the relative importance of lake features such as water depth or [[fetch (geography)|fetch length]].&lt;ref&gt;Janse JH and others, 2008. Critical phosphorus loading of different types of shallow lakes and the consequences for management estimated with the ecosystem model PCLake. Limnologica 38: 2003–2019&lt;/ref&gt; Also the potential effects of climate warming for shallow lakes have been studied.&lt;ref&gt;Mooij WM and others, 2007. Predicting the effect of climate change on temperate shallow lakes with the ecosystem model PCLake. Hydrobiologia 584: 443–454&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, PCLake is applied by lake water resource managers that consider the turbid state as undesirable. They can use the model to define the critical loadings for their specific lakes and evaluate the effectiveness of restoration measures. For this purpose also a meta-model has been developed.&lt;ref&gt;http://themasites.pbl.nl/modellen/pclake/&lt;/ref&gt; The meta-model can be used by water managers to derive an estimate of the critical loading values for a certain lake based on only a few important parameters, without the need of running the full dynamical model.&lt;ref&gt;Schep, S. (in Dutch) 2010. Neuraal netwerk PCLake ten behoeve van KRW-verkenner. Witteveen+Bos; rapportnr. UT565-2-1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model content==
Mathematically, PCLake is composed of a set of coupled [[differential equation]]s. With a large number of [[state variables]] (&gt;100) and [[parameters]] (&gt;300), the model may be characterized as relatively complex. The main biotic variables are [[phytoplankton]] and [[submerged aquatic vegetation]], describing [[primary production]]. A simplified [[food web]] is made up of [[zooplankton]], zoo[[benthos]], young and adult whitefish and piscivorous fish. The main abiotic factors are transparency and the nutrients phosphorus (P), nitrogen (N) and silica (Si). At the base of the model are the water and nutrient budgets (in- and outflow). The model describes a completely mixed water body and comprises both the water column and the upper sediment layer. The overall nutrient cycles for N, P and Si are described as completely closed (except for in- and outflow and [[denitrification]]). Inputs to the model are: lake hydrology, nutrient loading, dimensions and sediment characteristics. The model calculates [[chlorophyll]]-a, transparency, cyanobacteria, vegetation cover and fish biomass, as well as the concentrations and fluxes of nutrients N, P and Si, and oxygen. Optionally, a wetland zone with marsh vegetation and water exchange with the lake can be included.

PCLake is calibrated against nutrient, transparency, chlorophyll and vegetation data on more than 40 European (but mainly Dutch) lakes, and systematic sensitivity and uncertainty analysis have been performed.&lt;ref&gt;Janse JH and others, 2010. Estimating the critical phosphorus loading of shallow lakes with the ecosystem model PCLake: sensitivity, calibration and uncertainty. Ecological Modelling 221: 654–665&lt;/ref&gt;
Although PCLake is primarily used for Dutch lakes, it is likely that the model is also applicable to comparable non-[[stratification (water)|stratifying]] lakes in other regions, if parameters are adjusted or some small changes to the model are made.

==Model development==
The first version of PCLake (by then called PCLoos) was built in the early 1990s at the [[Netherlands National Institute for Public Health and the Environment]] (RIVM), within the framework of a research and restoration project on Lake Loosdrecht. It has been extended and improved since then. Parallel to PCLake, [[PCDitch]] was created, which is an ecosystem model for ditches and other linear water bodies. The models were further developed by dr. Jan H. Janse and colleagues at the [[Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency]] (PBL), formerly part of the RIVM. Since 2009, the model is jointly owned by PBL and the Netherlands Institute of Ecology, where further development and application of PCLake is taking place, related to aquatic-ecological research.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6575">'''Peer-mediated instruction''' ('''PMI''') is an approach in [[special education]] where [[peer group|peers]] of the target students are trained to provide necessary tutoring in educational, behavioral, and/or social concerns.(Chan et al., 2009). In PMI, peers may mediate by [[Modelling (psychology)|modeling]] appropriate behavior themselves, using [[Response Prompting Procedures|prompting procedures]] to elicit appropriate behavior from the target students, and [[Reinforcement|reinforcing]] appropriate behavior when it occurs. The peer tutors are chosen from the target students' classrooms, trained to mediate and closely observed during mediation. Among the advantages noted to the technique, it takes advantage of the positive potential of [[Peer pressure#Benign peer pressure|peer pressure]] and may integrate target students more fully in their peer group. Conversely, it is time consuming to implement and presents challenges in making sure that the peers follow proper techniques. However, studies have suggested it may be an effective technique for a wide range of students, including those with [[autism spectrum]] disorders.

==Procedure==
A student or students will be chosen from the target student's classroom to serve as a peer tutor. Garrison-Harrell et al. (as cited in Chan et al., 2009) suggested a systematic way to choosing the peers to be involved in the treatment based on social status and teacher judgment. Students were asked to list three peers they would like to play with on the playground, three peers they would invite to a party, and three peers they consider to be good friends. Teachers reviewed the top candidates, and selected the tutors based on social skills, language skills, school attendance and classroom behavior.

The student or students chosen as peers must be properly coached before the peer relationship begins, both to understand the importance of the intervention and the methods which should be used. Instructors may model behaviors to the peer tutors and may role play with the peer tutors, allowing the peer tutors to experience both parts in the PMI relationship. Other methods for training could include visual aids, reinforcement for correct implementation, instruction manuals and video instructions. Once the PMI relationship begins, the teacher provides on-going feedback, watching the peer at all times while the intervention is being used. (Chan et al., 2009).

==Strengths and limitations==
There are advantages of using PMI as an intervention strategy. First, there is never a shortage of peers to use, especially when implementing an intervention in a school or classroom. Second, students are influenced through [[observational learning]] by what they see their peers doing. Third, students are often less intimidated by a peer than they are a teacher, which makes instruction and feedback from peers potentially more effective. Fourth, it may not only offer short-term intervention benefits, but can also strengthen the target student's social ties within the classroom. Finally, research has been done with many different types of learners, including students with [[learning disability|learning disabilities]], behavior disorders and [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]], which show that PMI may be effective for a wide range of students (Fuchs &amp; Fuchs, 2005; Flood, Wilder, Flood &amp; Masuda, 2002).  

In 2009, ''Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders'' published a paper by Chan ''et al.'' that concluded that PMI is a potentially effective intervention approach for students with Autism disorders.

==Application to General Education classroom settings==
Varying forms of peer-mediated instruction and interventions have been conducted in a great range of settings over the decades. Research has been conducted in educational and non-educational environments with positive outcomes in each. It is important to note that PMII strategies are not restricted or inclusive to education or special education, but have been found to be effective in each-as well as inclusive classroom settings. The following characteristics have been identified by Kulik &amp; Kulik (1992), as central for successful implementation of peer-mediated instruction.
      
*''Expectations for student learning''. Teachers should establish high expectation levels. No students are expected to fall below the level of learning needed to be successful at the next level of education.
*''Careful orientation to lessons''. Teachers must clearly describe the relationship of a current lesson to previous study. Students are reminded of key concepts or skills previously covered.
*''Clear and focused instructions to participants''.
*''Close teacher monitoring of student progress''. Frequently formal and informal monitoring of student learning by teachers. Teachers must require that students are accountable for their product and learning.
*''Re-teach''. If students show signs of confusion, misinterpretation or misunderstanding, the teacher must be responsible to teach again.
*''Use classtime for learning''. Students must pace themselves and should be monitored for task completion.
*''Positive and personal teacher and student interaction''. Cooperative Learning and Peer Tutoring Strategies are instruction methods of choice in many classrooms as they are noted for preventing and alleviating many social problems related to children, adolescents, and young adults.

'''Pinkney Near''' (1927 - 1990)  was curator of the [[Cincinnati Museum of Art]] and afterward curator of the [[Virginia Museum of Fine Arts]] for thirty years. He was responsible for the [[VMFA]]'s acquisition of many treasured works of art, including arranging for the museum to purchase from [[John Lee Pratt]] the [[Francisco Goya]] portrait of General Nicolas Guye&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Merritt|first1=Robert|title=Pinkney Near Left a Mark on the Museum|publisher=Richmond Time-Dispatch|date=September 30, 1990|location=Richmond, Virginia|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barriault|first1=Anne B.|title=Enrich collections: the extraordinary collections of the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts|publisher=Apollo on High Beam|date=May 1, 2010|quote=...colleagues from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Museum of Art, Dumbarton Oaks, and the American Museum of Natural History . . . consulted with [visionary director Leslie Cheek, Jr.] and curator Pinkney Near to establish the Asian, Ancient Egyptian, Greek Roman, Byzantine, and Pre-Columbian collections.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from the collection of [[Karol Lanckoroński|Count Karol Lanckoroński]] of Vienna, Austria, a rare marble [[sarcophagus]] dating to the 2nd century B.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rare Marble Funeral Monument Given to Museum|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/4653261/sarcophagus_2nd-century_to_vmfa_says/|website=Newspapers.com|accessdate=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Guye portrait was long believed to be the most valuable single work of art in the [[VMFA]]'s collection. The Goya portrait of General Guye is on view prominently in the posthumously created Pinkney Near Gallery at the [[VMFA]]. 
==Biography==

Pinkney Near was born in New York City and was raised in [[Baltimore, Maryland]].&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituary: Pinkney L. Near|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1990-09-20/news/1990263193_1_pinkney-paul-episcopal-church-rebecca-n|accessdate=26 October 2015|publisher=Baltimore Sun|date=September 20, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944 he graduated from [[St. Paul's School (Brooklandville, Maryland)|St. Paul's School]], and in 1950 he became the first art history graduate of [[Johns Hopkins University]]. He earned his Master's degree from Harvard in 1951, and he studied [[Romanesque art|French Romanesque]] sculpture in Paris for three years on a [[Fulbright scholarship]]. He remained in Europe an additional year for research on a Sachs fellowship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Merritt|first1=Robert|title=Pinkney Near left mark on museum|publisher=Richmond Times-Dispatch|date=September 30, 1990|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He married the former Henrietta Lloyd.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1990-09-20/news/1990263193_1_pinkney-paul-episcopal-church-rebecca-n&lt;/ref&gt; Every summer Near, a specialist in European art,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Library|first1=VMFA|title=Special Collections in European Art: The Pinkney Near Collection|url=http://vmfa.museum/library/collections/|website=Virginia Museum of Fine Arts|accessdate=6 January 2016|location=Richmond, Virginia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his artist wife Henrietta Lloyd Near, a former colleague at the [[VMFA]], traveled to Europe to acquire art for the [[Virginia Museum of Fine Arts]]. Among the cities they visited were Barcelona, London, Rome, and Venice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=People in the Fan: Henrietta Near|publisher=Fan District Newsletter|date=Summer 2015|location=Richmond, Virginia|pages=8, 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were sometimes accompanied by philanthropists [[Sydney Lewis|Sydney and Frances Lewis]], donors of major collections to the museum.

Near began his work at the [[VMFA]] in 1958, and, except for three years (1962-1965) when he did graduate work at [[Harvard]] and was a curator at the [[Cincinnati Art Museum]], he served at the VMFA in Richmond the remainder of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Merritt|first1=Robert|title=Curator left lasting mark|work=art critic|issue=March 30, 1990|publisher=Richmond Times-Dispatch|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early years, when the museum was run by a director and a curator with a small staff, Near became the first full-time curator of the [[Virginia Museum of Fine Arts]], one of the first state-supported art museums in the United States.

Pinkney Near died August 29, 1990 of pneumonia at a hospital in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], where he and his wife were visiting relatives. He was 63. His memorial service was held at [[St. Paul's Episcopal Church, Richmond, Virginia|St. Paul's Episcopal Church]] in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond,Virginia]], where he lived.&lt;ref name=obit /&gt;

==Curator of the [[Cincinnati Museum of Art]]==
In 1964 Pinkney Near, curator of paintings, selected American paintings for the Cincinnati Museum's survey exhibition, ranging from early painters such as [[John Trumbull]], [[Gilbert Stuart]], and [[Washington Allston]] to later painters [[John Marin]], [[Max Weber]], [[George Bellows]], [[Childe Hassam]], [[Robert Vickrey]], [[Marsden Hartley]], [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]], [[Mark Tobey]], [[Jane Freilicher]], [[Milton Avery]], and [[Tom Wesselmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Darrack|first1=Arthur|title=American Painting Surveyed in Great Style at Museum Show|website=Newspapers.com|publisher=Cincinnati Enquirer|location=Cincinnati Enquirer, Kentucky edition|page=80|date=April 5, 1964|quote=He [Pinkney Near] has done a superb job of selection and I cannot recall a more interesting panorama of American painting.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Curator of the [[Virginia Museum of Fine Arts]]==
Pinkney Near first came to the VMFA in 1954 for a brief visit, when he had just returned from Paris where he studied Romanesque sculpture with his Fulbright Scholarship. A year later, in 1955 he left the museum for a Sachs fellowship which sponsored further study in Europe. However, it was during this brief stay that he began the evolution of the Collections Division, and, when he returned in 1956 at the age of 29, he became curatorial assistant at the museum. Two years later he was promoted to curator but decided to pursue his graduate work at Harvard. When he returned, he became Chief Curator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hiring of chief curator marked start of Collections Division|publisher=Richmond Times-Dispatch|date=January 12, 1986|location=Richmond, Virginia|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pinkney Near served as VMFA curator for 30 years, much of that time as chief administrative curator. In 1988 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Va. Museum chooses curator for Mellon Collection|publisher=The Richmond Afro-American|date=December 24, 1988|location=Richmond, Virginia|page=A6|quote="In selecting Mr. Near to be the first holder of this prestigious title, Mr. Mellon has recognized Mr. Near's lifelong commitment to scholarship and connoisseurship," says Paul N. Perrot, director of the museum.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Near was named to the newly created post of Paul Mellon Curator and senior research curator, a post in which he worked closely with the Mellon Collection and with [[Paul Mellon]], who provided important gifts of art, both paintings and sculpture portraying animals, to the museum.&lt;ref&gt;Richmond Times-Dispatch, September 30, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1990-09-20/news/1990263193_1_pinkney-paul-episcopal-church-rebecca-n&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the years Near acquired for the museum some of its greatest treasures, including paintings by [[Théodore Géricault]], [[Claude Lorraine]]'s "Battle on a Bridge," [[Aristide Maillol]]'s "The River," [[Claude Monet]]'s "Irises by the Pond," [[Charles Willson Peale]]'s "William Smith and His Grandson," [[Angelica Kauffmann]]'s "Cornelia Pointing to Her Children as Her Treasures," and [[Jean-Baptiste Belin|Jean-Bapiste Blin de Fontenay]]'s monumental "Buffet Under a Trellis."

In 1976 Near announced the [[VMFA|VMFA's]] purchase of American sculptor [[Isamu Noguchi|Isamu Noguchi's]] polished stainless steel sculpture "Open Lock," completed in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Virginia Museum Acquires Sculpture by Isamu Noguchi|publisher=The Danville Register|date=August 9, 1976|location=Danville, Virginia|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the exhibits curated by Near was one called ''Three Masters of Landscape: Fragonard, Robert and Boucher'' which, although small, presented interesting issues due to the variability of the works. The exhibit made use of a recently acquired Fragonard entitled ''Landscape With Three Washerwomen".&lt;ref name=nyt1981&gt;{{cite news |title=Gallery View; THREE FRENCH LANDSCAPISTS WITH A COMMON VISION; RICHMOND, Va.|publisher=New York Times|date=November 29, 1981|first=John |last=Russell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and publications==
Pinkney Near wrote ''The Whistlers:A Family Reunion'', published in 1965 by the [[Cincinnati Museum of Art]], followed in 1981 by ''Three Masters of Landscape: Fragonard, Robert, and Boucher'', which was published by the [[Virginia Museum of Fine Arts]]. While at the [[VMFA]], the museum also published his book ''Apollo''. In 1985, his book ''French Paintings'' was published by the [[University of Virginia Press]].

Near, along with two other art experts, [[Julien Binford]] (professor emeritus at [[Mary Washington College]] in [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]]) and William Campbell (Curator of American Paintings at the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington) selected the paintings by the deceased artist [[Gari Melchers]] for permanent display in the Gari Melchers Memorial Gallery at Belmont, the [[Falmouth, Virginia]] home of the artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Culbertson|first1=Drena|title=Final Melchers Collection selection is due this week|publisher=The Free Lance Star|date=July 26, 1976|location=Fredericksburg, Virginia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was an author of many of the VMFA exhibition catalogs and illustrated books including ''French Paintings: The Collection of Mr. and Mrs. Paul Mellon''.

==Pinkney Near memorial lectures in art history==
Following the death of Pinkney Near in 1990 a series of memorial lectures in art history featuring notable art historians was begun at [[Art6|Art6 Gallery]] in Richmond in his honor. All but the last of the series was presented in the main gallery at Art6. Speakers in the series included Mia Genoni, Suzanne Foley, [[Robert Hobbs]], Matthew Affron, Richard Woodward, Joseph Dye III, Mitchell Merling, Belle Pendleton, and Susanne Kilgore Arnold. The final lecture in the series was given by then [[VMFA]] curator of contemporary art [[John Ravenal|John B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15185">The '''Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements''' are a set of conditions sufficient for a computer architecture to support system [[Full virtualization|virtualization]] efficiently. They were introduced by [[Gerald J. Popek]] and [[Robert P. Goldberg]] in their 1974 article "Formal Requirements for Virtualizable Third Generation Architectures".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Popek | first1 = G. J. | authorlink1 = Gerald J. Popek| last2 = Goldberg | first2 = R. P.| doi = 10.1145/361011.361073| title = Formal requirements for virtualizable third generation architectures| journal = [[Communications of the ACM]]| volume = 17| issue = 7| pages = 412–421| date=July 1974 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the requirements are derived under simplifying assumptions, they still represent a convenient way of determining whether a computer architecture supports efficient virtualization and provide guidelines for the design of virtualized computer architectures.

== VMM definition ==
System [[virtual machines]] are capable of virtualizing a full set of hardware resources, including a processor (or processors), memory and storage resources and peripheral devices. 
A [[virtual machine monitor]] (VMM, also called [[hypervisor]]) is the piece of software that provides the abstraction of a virtual machine. There are three properties of interest when analyzing the environment created by a VMM:&lt;ref&gt;Rogier Dittner, David Rule, ''The best damn server virtualization book period'', Syngress, 2007, {{ISBN|1-59749-217-5}}, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

; Equivalence / Fidelity : A program running under the VMM should exhibit a behavior essentially identical to that demonstrated when running on an equivalent machine directly.
; Resource control / Safety : The VMM must be in complete control of the virtualized resources.
; Efficiency / Performance: A statistically dominant fraction of machine instructions must be executed without VMM intervention.

In the terminology of Popek and Goldberg, a VMM must present all three properties. In the terminology used in the reference book of Smith and Nair (2005), VMMs are typically assumed to satisfy the equivalence and resource control properties, and those additionally meeting the performance property are called ''efficient VMMs''.&lt;ref&gt;Smith and Nair, p. 387&lt;/ref&gt;

Popek and Goldberg describe the characteristics that the [[instruction set architecture]] (ISA) of the physical machine must possess in order to run VMMs which possess the above properties.
Their analysis derives such characteristics using a model of "third generation architectures" (e.g., IBM 360, Honeywell 6000, DEC PDP-10) that is nevertheless general enough to be extended to modern machines. This model includes a processor that operates in either system or user mode, and has access to linear, uniformly addressable memory. It is assumed that a subset of the instruction set is available only when in system mode and that memory is addressed relative to a relocation register. I/O and interrupts are not modelled.

== Virtualization theorems ==
To derive their virtualization theorems, which give sufficient (but not necessary) conditions for virtualization, Popek and Goldberg introduce a classification of instructions of an ISA into 3 different groups:

; Privileged instructions : Those that [[Trap (computing)|trap]] if the processor is in [[user mode]] and do not trap if it is in system mode ([[supervisor mode]]). 
; Control sensitive instructions : Those that attempt to change the configuration of resources in the system.
; Behavior sensitive instructions : Those whose behavior or result depends on the configuration of resources (the content of the relocation register or the processor's mode).

The main result of Popek and Goldberg's analysis can then be expressed as follows.

'''Theorem 1'''. For any conventional [[third-generation computer]], an ''effective'' VMM may be constructed if the set of sensitive instructions for that computer is a subset of the set of privileged instructions.

Intuitively, the theorem states that to build a VMM it is sufficient that all instructions that could affect the correct functioning of the VMM (sensitive instructions) always trap and pass control to the VMM. This guarantees the resource control property. Non-privileged instructions must instead be executed natively (i.e., efficiently). The holding of the equivalence property also follows.

This theorem also provides a simple technique for implementing a VMM, called ''trap-and-emulate virtualization'', more recently called ''classic virtualization'': because all sensitive instructions behave nicely, all the VMM has to do is trap and emulate every one of them.&lt;ref name=asplos23&gt;Adams and Agesen, 2006, pp. 2-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=smith391/&gt;

A related problem is that of deriving sufficient conditions for recursive virtualization, that is, the conditions under which a VMM that can run on a copy of itself can be built. Popek and Goldberg present the following (sufficient) conditions.

'''Theorem 2'''. A conventional [[third-generation computer]] is recursively virtualizable if:

# it is virtualizable and
# a VMM without any timing dependencies can be constructed for it.

Some architectures, like the non-hardware-assisted [[x86]], do not meet these conditions, so they cannot be virtualized in the classic way. But architectures can still be fully virtualized (in the x86 case meaning at the CPU and MMU level) by using different techniques like binary translation, which replaces the sensitive instructions that do not generate traps,&lt;ref name=asplos23/&gt; which are sometimes called critical instructions. This additional processing however makes the VMM less efficient in theory,&lt;ref name=smith391&gt;Smith and Nair, p. 391&lt;/ref&gt; but hardware traps have non-negligible performance cost as well.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} A well-tuned caching binary translation system may achieve comparable performance, and it does in the case of x86 binary translation relative to first generation x86 hardware assist, which merely made sensitive instructions trappable.&lt;ref&gt;Adams and Agesen, p. 1 and 5&lt;/ref&gt; Effectively this gives a theorem with different sufficiency conditions.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

'''Theorem 3'''. A ''hybrid'' VMM may be constructed for any third generation machine in which the set of user sensitive instructions are a subset of the set of privileged instructions:

== Handling critical instructions ==
{{Unreferenced section|date= February 2015}}

The conditions for ISA virtualization expressed in Theorem 1 may be relaxed at the expense of the efficiency property.  VMMs for non-virtualizable ISAs (in the Popek and Goldberg's sense) have routinely been built.

The virtualization of such architectures requires correct handling of ''critical instructions'', i.e., sensitive but unprivileged instructions. One approach, known as ''patching'', adopts techniques commonly used in [[dynamic recompilation]]: critical instructions are discovered at run-time and replaced with a trap into the VMM. Various mechanisms, such as the caching of emulation code or [[hardware-assisted virtualization|hardware assists]], have been proposed to make the patching process more efficient. A different approach is that of [[paravirtualization]], which requires guest operating systems to be modified (''ported'') before running in the virtual environment.

== Instruction sets of common architectures ==
This section presents some relevant architectures and how they relate to the virtualization requirements.

=== PDP-10 ===
The [[PDP-10]] architecture has a few instructions which are sensitive (alter or query the processor's mode) but not privileged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | author=S. W. Galley | title=PDP-10 Virtual machines | booktitle=Proc. ACM SIGARCH-SIGOPS Workshop on Virtual Computer Systems | year=1969 | pages=30–34 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;  These instructions save or restore the condition codes containing USER or IOT bits:

* JSR: jump to subroutine
* JSP: jump and save program counter
* PUSHJ: push down and jump
* JRST: jump and restore

=== System/370 ===
All sensitive instructions in the [[System/370]] are privileged: it satisfies the virtualization requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Smith and Nair, p. 395&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Motorola MC68000 ===
The [[Motorola 68000|Motorola MC68000]] has a single unprivileged sensitive instruction:

* MOVE from SR

This instruction is sensitive because it allows access to the entire status register, which includes not only the [[Status register|condition codes]] but also the user/supervisor bit, interrupt level, and trace control.  In most later family members, starting with the [[Motorola 68010|MC68010]], the MOVE from SR instruction was made privileged, and a new MOVE from CCR instruction was provided to allow access to the condition code register only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = M68000 8-/16-32-Bit Microprocessor User's Manual, Ninth Edition | publisher = Motorola, Inc. | location = Phoenix, AZ, USA | year = 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Motorola M68000 Family Programmer's Reference Manual | publisher = Motorola, Inc. | location = Phoenix, AZ, USA | year = 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== IA-32 (x86) ===&lt;!-----------[[Intel 80386]] links here--------------&gt;
{{Main|X86 virtualization}}

The [[IA-32]] instruction set of the [[Intel P5 (microarchitecture)|Pentium]] processor contains 18 sensitive, unprivileged instructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | author=John Scott Robin and Cynthia E. Irvine | title=Analysis of the Intel Pentium's Ability to Support a Secure Virtual Machine Monitor | booktitle=Proc. 9th USENIX Security Symposium | year=2000 | url=http://www.usenix.org/events/sec2000/robin.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can be categorized in two groups:

* Sensitive register instructions: read or change sensitive registers or memory locations such as a clock register or interrupt registers:
** SGDT, SIDT, SLDT
** SMSW
** PUSHF, POPF
*Protection system instructions: reference the storage protection system, memory or address relocation system:
** LAR, LSL, VERR, VERW
** POP
** PUSH
** CALL FAR, JMP FAR, INT n, RETF
** STR
** MOV (segment registers)

The introduction of the [[AMD-V]] and [[Intel VT-x]] instruction sets in 2005 allows x86 processors to meet the Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements.

=== IA-64 ===
The effort needed to support virtualization on the [[IA-64]] architecture is described in a 2000 article by Magenheimer and Christian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author=Daniel J. Magenheimer and Thomas W. Christian|year=2000|title=vBlades: Optimized Paravirtualization for the Itanium Processor Family|url=http://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/vm04/tech/magenheimer.html|booktitle=Proc. 3rd Virtual Machine Research &amp; Technology Symposium|publisher=USENIX|pages=73&amp;ndash;82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== SPARC ===
A "hyperprivileged" mode for the [[UltraSPARC]] architecture was specified in ''UltraSPARC Architecture 2005''.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = UltraSPARC Architecture 2005: One Architecture.... Multiple Innovative Implementations (DraftD0.9) | date = 2007-05-17 | first = David | last = Weaver | publisher = Sun Microsystems, Inc. | location = Santa Clara, CA, USA | url = http://opensparc-t1.sunsource.net/specs/UA2005-current-draft-HP-EXT.pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090219233505/http://opensparc-t1.sunsource.net/specs/UA2005-current-draft-HP-EXT.pdf | archivedate = 2009-02-19 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It defines a ''sun4v'' platform&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = UltraSPARC Virtual Machine Specification | url = http://opensparc-t1.sunsource.net/specs/Hypervisor-api-current-draft.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927060811/http://opensparc-t1.sunsource.net/specs/Hypervisor-api-current-draft.pdf | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2007-09-27 | date = 2006-01-24 | author = Sun Microsystems, Inc. | location = Santa Clara, CA, USA }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a super-set of the ''sun4u'' platform, but is still compliant to the SPARC v9 Level-1&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The SPARC Architecture Manual: Version 9 | first = David L. | last = Weaver | author2 = Tom Germond | url = http://www.sparc.com/standards/SPARCV9.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20041107035158/http://www.sparc.com/standards/SPARCV9.pdf | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2004-11-07 | publisher = SPARC International, Inc. | location = San Jose, CA, USA | isbn = 0-13-825001-4 | year = 1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt; specification.

=== PowerPC ===
All sensitive instructions in the [[PowerPC]] instruction set are privileged.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pagetable.com/?p=15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~410-s07/lectures/L38_Virtualization.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Performance in practice ==
The efficiency requirement in Popek and Goldberg's definition of a VMM concerns only the execution of non-privileged instructions, which must execute natively. This is what distinguishes a VMM from the more general class of hardware [[Emulator|emulation]] software. Unfortunately, even on an architecture that meets Popek and Goldberg's requirements, the performance of a virtual machine can differ significantly from the actual hardware. Early experiments performed on the System/370 (which meets the formal requirements of Theorem 1) showed that performance of a virtual machine could be as low as 21% of the native machine in some benchmarks. The cost of trapping and emulating privileged instructions in the VMM can be significant. This led the IBM engineers to introduce a number of [[hardware-assisted virtualization|hardware assists]], which roughly doubled the performance of the System/370 virtual machines.&lt;ref&gt;Smith and Nair, p. 415-416 and 426&lt;/ref&gt; Assists were added in several stages. In the end, there were over 100 assists on the late models System/370.&lt;ref&gt;Gum, p. 535&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main driving factors for the development of hardware assists for the System/370 was virtual memory itself. When the guest was an operating system that itself implemented virtual memory, even non-privileged instructions could experience longer execution times - a penalty imposed by the requirement to access translation tables not used in native execution (see [[shadow page tables]]).&lt;ref&gt;Gum, p. 533&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Escribano.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Jean Miélot]], a European author and scribe at work]]
[[File:Scribes with typewriters outside Post Office, Mandi.jpg|thumb|300px|Modern scribes with typewriters outside post office, [[Mandi, Himachal Pradesh]], India, 2010.]]

A '''scribe''' is a person who serves as a professional [[copyist]], especially one who made copies of manuscripts before the invention of [[Printing press|automatic printing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/scribe|title=the definition of scribe|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2017-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The profession, previously widespread across cultures, lost most of its prominence and status with the advent of the [[Printing press|printing press.]] The work of scribes can involve copying manuscripts and other texts as well as secretarial and administrative duties such as the taking of dictation and keeping of business, judicial, and historical records for [[king]]s, [[nobility|nobles]], [[temple]]s, and [[City|cities]]. The profession has developed into [[Civil service|public servant]]s, [[journalist]]s, [[accountant]]s, [[Audio typist|typist]]s, and [[lawyer]]s. In societies with low literacy rates, street-corner letter-writers (and readers) may still be found providing scribe service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/06/11/1055220661012.html|title=Women of letters doing write for the illiterate - smh.com.au|website=www.smh.com.au|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient Egypt==
[[File:GD-EG-Louxor-126.JPG|thumb|300px|Egyptian scribe with [[papyrus]] scroll]]
One of the most important   professionals in ancient Egypt was a person educated in the arts of writing (both [[hieroglyphics]] and [[hieratic]] scripts, as well as the [[Demotic (Egyptian)|demotic]] script from the second half of the first millennium BCE, which was mainly used as shorthand and for commerce) and arithmetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rice|first1=Michael|title=Who's Who in Ancient Egypt|date=1999|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0415154482|page=lvi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Damerow|first1=Peter|title=Abstraction and Representation: Essays on the Cultural Evolution of Thinking|date=1996|publisher=Kluwer|location=[[Dordrecht]]|isbn=978-0792338161|pages=188–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sons of scribes were brought up in the same scribal tradition, sent to school, and inherited their fathers' positions upon entering the civil service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carr|first1=David M.|title=Writing on the Tablet of the Heart: Origins of Scripture and Literature|date=2005|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0195172973|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of what is known about ancient Egypt is due to the activities of its scribes and the officials. Monumental buildings were erected under their supervision,&lt;ref name="Kemp"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kemp|first1=Barry J. |author-link=Barry J. Kemp |title=Ancient Egypt: Anatomy of a Civilization|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0415235495|page=180|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; administrative and economic activities were documented by them, and stories from Egypt's lower classes and foreign lands survive due to scribes putting them in writing.&lt;ref name="Kemp"/&gt;{{rp|296}}

[[File:Ancient Egyptian Scribe's palette HARGM7677.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Ancient Egyptian scribe's palette with five depressions for pigments and four styli]]
Scribes were considered part of the royal court, were not [[conscription|conscripted]] into the army, did not have to pay taxes, and were exempt from the heavy manual labor required of the lower classes ([[corvée]] labor). The scribal profession worked with painters and artisans who decorated [[relief]]s and other building works with scenes, personages, or hieroglyphic text. 

&lt;div&gt;The hieroglyph used to [[scribe equipment (hieroglyph)|signify the scribe]], ''to write'' and ''writings'', etc., is [[Gardiner's sign list|Gardiner sign]] Y3, &lt;hiero&gt;Y3&lt;/hiero&gt; from the category of 'writings, &amp; music'. The hieroglyph contains the scribe's ink-mixing palette, a vertical case to hold writing-reeds, and a leather pouch to hold the black and red ink blocks.&lt;/div&gt; The demotic scribes used rush pens which had stems thinner than that of a reed (2 mm). The end of the rush was cut obliquely and then chewed, so that the fibers became separated. The result was a short, stiff brush which was handled in the same manner as that of a calligrapher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Willy |last=Clarysse |title=Egyptian Scribes Writing Greek |journal=Chronique d'Egypte |volume=68 |issue=135–136 |date=1993 |pages=186–201 |doi=10.1484/J.CDE.2.308932}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thoth]] was the god credited with the invention of writing by the ancient Egyptians. He was the scribe of the gods who held knowledge of scientific and moral laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Budge|first1=E. A. Wallis|authorlink=E. A.

==Egyptian and Mesopotamian functions==
[[File:Tablet with Cuneiform Writing.jpg|thumb|Cuneiform depiction]][[File:Egyptian - Scribe Statue of Min-nakht - Walters 22230 - Three Quarter.jpg|thumb|upright|right|This early [[New Kingdom]] statue commemorates the scribe Minnakht ("Strength of [[Min (god)|Min]]") and demonstrates how ancient scribes read [[papyri]] – in a seated position on the floor with the text on their lap.&lt;!-- [[Walters Art Museum]], [[Baltimore]].--&gt;]]

In addition to accountancy and governmental politicking, the scribal professions branched out into literature. The first stories were probably creation stories and religious texts. Other genres evolved, such as [[wisdom literature]], which were collections of the philosophical sayings from wise men. These contain the earliest recordings of societal thought and exploration of ideas in some length and detail.

In [[Mesopotamia]] during the middle to late 3rd millennium BCE, the [[Sumer|Sumerians]] originated some of this literature in the form of a series of debates. Among the list of [[Sumerian disputations]] is the ''[[Debate between bird and fish]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=t.5.3.5&amp;display=Crit&amp;charenc=j&amp;lineid=t535.p2#t535.p2 |title=The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature |website=Etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk |date=2006-12-19 |accessdate=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Sumerian examples include the ''[[Debate between Summer and Winter]]'' where Winter wins, and disputes between the cattle and grain, the tree and the reed, silver and copper, the pickaxe and the plough, and the millstone and the gul-gul stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=c.5.3 |title=The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature |website=Etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk |date=2006-12-19 |accessdate=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Ancient Egyptian version is [[Dispute between a man and his Ba|''The Dispute between a man and his Ba'']], which comes from the Middle Kingdom period.

==Judaism==
As early as the 11th century BCE, scribes in [[Ancient Israel]], were distinguished professionals who would exercise functions which today could be associated with lawyers, journalists, government ministers, judges, or financiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/hebrew.htm |title=Hebrew language, alphabet and pronunciation |website=Omniglot.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scribes also copied documents, but this was not necessarily part of their job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Metzger|first1=Bruce M.|last2=Coogan|first2=Michael D.|title=The Oxford Companion to the Bible|date=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780195046458|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=March 2017}}

===Sofer===
{{main|Sofer (scribe)}}
Sofers ({{lang-he|סופר סת”ם}}) are among the few scribes that still ply their trade by hand, writing on [[parchment]]. Renowned [[calligrapher]]s, they produce the [[Hebrew]] [[Sefer Torah|Torah scrolls]] and other holy texts.
====Accuracy====
{{further|Dead Sea Scrolls}}

Until 1948, the oldest known manuscripts of the [[Hebrew Bible]] dated back to CE 895. In 1947, a shepherd boy discovered some scrolls dated between 100 BCE and CE 100, inside a cave west of the [[Dead Sea]]. Over the next decade, more scrolls were found in caves and the discoveries became known collectively as the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]. Every book in the [[Hebrew Bible]] was represented except [[Esther]]. Numerous copies of each book were discovered, including 25 copies of the book of [[Deuteronomy]].

While there are other items found among the Dead Sea Scrolls not currently in the [[Hebrew Bible]], and many variations and errors occurred while they were copied down, the texts on the whole testify to the accuracy of the scribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=Paul|title=A History of the Jews|date=1993|publisher=Phoenix|location=London|isbn=978-1857990966|page=91|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dead Sea Scrolls are currently the best route of comparison to the accuracy and consistency of translation for the [[Hebrew Bible]] because they are the oldest out of any [[Bible|Biblical text]] currently known.
====Corrections by the scribes and editing biblical literature====
Priests who took over the leadership of the Jewish community preserved and edited biblical literature. Biblical literature became a tool that legitimated and furthered the priests' political and religious authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/origins-written-bible.html |title=Origins of the Written Bible |first=William M. |last=Schniedewind |author-link=William M. Schniedewind |date=18 November 2008 |access-date=9 July 2018 |website=[[PBS Online]] |publisher=Nova}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corrections by the scribes ([[Tiqqun soferim|Tikkunei Soferim]]) refers to changes that were made in the original wording of the Hebrew Bible wording during the second temple period, perhaps sometime between 450 and 350 BCE. One of the most prominent men at this time was [[Ezra|Ezra the scribe]]. He also hired scribes to work for him, in order to write down and revise the oral tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://booksnthoughts.com/ezra-changed-the-torah-text/ |title=Ezra changed the Torah text |first=Israel |last=Drazin |date=26 August 2015 |access-date=9 July 2018 |website=Jewish Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Ezra and the scribes had completed the writing, Ezra gathered the Jews who had returned from exile, all of whom belonged to [[Kohen|Kohanim]] families. Ezra read them an unfamiliar version of the Torah. This version was different from the Torah of their fathers. Ezra did not write a new bible. Through the genius of his ‘editing’ he presented the religion in a new light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=M. |last=Okouneff |title=The Wrong Scribe: The Scribe Who Revised the King David Story |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=3XFdjwEACAAJ |publisher=[[CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform]] |date=23 January 2016 |pages=146 |editor-first=John |editor-last=Greenburg |isbn=9781523640430}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/.premium-who-wrote-the-torah-1.5318582 |title=Who Wrote the Torah? |last=Gilad |first=Elon |date=22 October 2014 |access-date=9 July 2018 |newspaper=[[Haaretz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Europe in the Middle Ages==

===Monastic scribes===
In the [[Middle Ages]] every book was made by hand. Specially trained monks, or scribes, had to carefully cut sheets of parchment, make the ink, write the script, bind the pages, and create a cover to protect the script. This was all accomplished in a monastic writing room called a [[scriptorium]] which was kept very quiet so scribes could maintain concentration.&lt;ref name=" Pavlik, McIntosh"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pavlik|first1=John|last2=McIntosh|first2=Shawn|title=Converging Media: A New Introduction to Mass Communication|date=2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780190271510|pages=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large scriptorium may have up to forty scribes working.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;  Scribes woke to morning bells before dawn and worked until the evening bells, with a lunch break in between. They worked every day except for the [[Sabbath]].&lt;ref name="Lyons"/&gt; The primary purpose of these scribes was to promote the ideas of the Christian Church, so they mostly copied classical and religious works. The scribes were required to copy works in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew whether or not they understood the language.&lt;ref name="Lyons" /&gt;These re-creations were often written in calligraphy and featured rich illustrations, making the process incredibly time consuming. Scribes had to be familiar with the writing technology as well. They had to make sure that the lines were straight and the letters were the same size in each book that they copied. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/707023033|title=Books : a living history|last=Martyn.|first=Lyons,|date=2011|publisher=J. Paul Getty Museum|isbn=9781606060834|location=Los Angeles|oclc=707023033}}&lt;/ref&gt; It typically took a scribe fifteen months to copy a Bible.&lt;ref name="Lyons"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lyons|first1=Martyn|title=Books: A Living History|date=2011|publisher=J. Paul Getty Museum|location=Los Angeles|isbn=9781606060834|pages=36–38, 41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such books were written on parchment or vellum made from treated hides of sheep, goats, or calves. These hides were often from the monastery's own animals as monasteries were self sufficient in raising animals, growing crops, and brewing beer.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;  The overall process was too extensive and costly for books to become widespread during this period.&lt;ref name=" Pavlik, McIntosh"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pavlik|first1=John|last2=McIntosh|first2=Shawn|title=Converging Media: A New Introduction to Mass Communication|date=2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780190271510|pages=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although scribes were only able to work in daylight, due to the expense of candles and the rather poor lighting they provided, monastic scribes were still able to produce three to four pages of work per day.&lt;ref name="Lyons" /&gt; The average scribe could copy two books a year.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Stuart A.P.|title=The Library: An Illustrated History|date=2009|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing|location=New York, NY|isbn=9781602397064|page=33–34|ref=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were expected to make at least one mistake per page.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Female Scribes===
Women also played a role as scribes in Anglo-Saxon England, as religious women in convents and schools were literate. Excavations at medieval convents have uncovered [[styli]], indicating that writing and copying were done at those locations.&lt;ref&gt;https://thenewinquiry.com/blog/women-scribes-the-technologists-of-the-middle-ages/&lt;/ref&gt; Also, female pronouns are used in prayers in manuscripts from the late 8th century, suggesting that the manuscripts were originally written by and for female scribes.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.bl.uk/digitisedmanuscripts/2017/03/female-scribes-in-early-manuscripts-.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Town scribe==
The scribe was a common job in medieval towns during the 10th and 11th centuries. Many would be employed at scriptoria owned by local schoolmasters or lords. These scribes would be working under deadlines to complete commissioned works such as historic chronicles or poetry. Because parchment was quite costly, the scribe would often create a draft of the work first on a wax or chalk tablet.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Stuart. (2009). ''The Library: An Illustrated History.''

[[File:Sea foam at Ocean Beach in San Francisco -1 on 3-25-11.jpg|thumb|300px| {{center|Sea foam washed up or blown onto a beach}}]]

'''Sea foam''', ocean foam, beach foam, or spume is a type of [[foam]] created by the agitation of [[seawater]], particularly when it contains higher concentrations of [[dissolved organic matter]] (including [[Protein|proteins]], [[Lignin|lignins]], and [[Lipid|lipids]]) derived from sources such as the offshore breakdown of [[Algal bloom|algal blooms]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1 October 2011|title=Foam in the aquatic environment|url=|journal=Water Research|language=en|volume=45|issue=15|pages=4355–4366|doi=10.1016/j.watres.2011.06.004|issn=0043-1354|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These compounds can act as [[Surfactant|surfactants]] or [[Foaming agent|foaming agents]]. As the seawater is churned by [[Breaking wave|breaking waves]] in the [[surf zone]] adjacent to the shore, the surfactants under these turbulent conditions trap air, forming persistent [[bubble (physics)|bubbles]] that stick to each other through [[surface tension]]. Sea foam is a global phenomenon&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and it varies depending on location and the potential influence of the surrounding marine, freshwater, and/or terrestrial environments.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=HAROLD|first=E.|last2=SCHLICHTING|first2=JR.|date=1971|title=A Preliminary Study of the Algae and Protozoa in Seafoam|url=|journal=Botanica Marina|volume=14|issue=1|pages=|doi=10.1515/botm.1971.14.1.24|issn=0006-8055|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its low density and persistence, foam can be blown by strong on-shore winds from the beach face inland.

== Formation ==
[[File:Sea spray sea foam connection.png|thumb|600px| {{center|Connection between sea foam and [[sea spray]] formation. The dark orange line indicates processes common to the formation of both [[sea spray]] and sea foam.}}]]

Sea foam is formed under conditions that are similar to the formation of [[sea spray]]. One of the main distinctions from sea spray formation is the presence of higher concentrations of dissolved organic matter from [[macrophytes]] and [[phytoplankton]]. The dissolved organic matter in the surface water, which can be derived from the natural environment or human-made sources, provides stability to the resulting sea foam.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Velimirov|first=B.|date=1980|title=Formation and potential trophic significance of marine foam near kelp beds in the benguela upwelling system|url=|journal=Marine Biology|volume=58|issue=4|pages=311–318|doi=10.1007/bf00390779|issn=0025-3162|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The physical processes that contribute to sea foam formation are breaking [[Surface wave|surface waves]], bubble entrainment, and whitecap formation. Breaking of surface waves injects air from the atmosphere into the water column, leading to bubble creation. These bubbles get transported around the top few meters of the surface ocean due to their [[buoyancy]]. The smallest bubbles entrained in the water column dissolve entirely leading to higher ratios of dissolved gases in the surface ocean. The bubbles that do not dissolve eventually make it back to the surface. As they rise, these bubbles accumulate [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] substances. Presence of dissolved organic matter stabilizes the bubbles, aggregating together as sea foam.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some studies on sea foam report that breaking of algal cells in times of heavy swells makes sea foam production more likely.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Falling rain drops on the sea surface can also contribute to sea foam formation and destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Veron|first=Fabrice|date=2015-01-03|title=Ocean Spray|url=|journal=Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics|language=en|volume=47|issue=1|pages=507–538|doi=10.1146/annurev-fluid-010814-014651|issn=0066-4189|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been some non-mechanistic studies demonstrating increased sea foam formation due to high rainfall events.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Turbulence in the surface mixed layer can affect the concentration of dissolved organic matter and aids in the formation of nutrient-dense foam.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Craig|first=Douglas|last2=Ireland|first2=Robert J.|last3=Bärlocher|first3=Felix|date= September 1989|title=Seasonal variation in the organic composition of seafoam|url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology|volume=130|issue=1|pages=71–80|doi=10.1016/0022-0981(89)90019-1|issn=0022-0981|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Composition ==
[[File:Brandung (MW 2015.02.27.).JPG|thumb|Sea foam usually contains a mixture of decomposed organic materials]]

The composition of sea foam is generally a mixture of decomposed organic materials, including [[zooplankton]], [[phytoplankton]], [[algae]] (including [[Diatom|diatoms]]&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Druzhkov|first=Nikolai V.|last2=Makarevich|first2=Pavel R.|last3=Bardan|first3=Sergei I.|date=12 January 1997|title=Sea foam as an object of sea-surface film studies|url=|journal=Polar Research|language=en|volume=16|issue=2|pages=117–121|doi=10.3402/polar.v16i2.6630|issn=1751-8369|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[bacteria]], [[Fungus|fungi]], [[Protozoa|protozoans]], and vascular plant [[detritus]],&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; though each occurrence of sea foam varies in its specific contents. In some areas, sea foam is found to be made up of primarily [[protein]], dominant in both fresh and old foam, as well as [[Lipid|lipids]] and [[Carbohydrate|carbohydrates]]. The high protein and low carbohydrate concentration suggest that [[Sugar|sugars]] originally present in the surrounding mucilage created by algae or plant matter has been quickly consumed by bacteria.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Additional research has shown that between a small fraction of sea foam measured by dry weight is [[organic carbon]], which contains [[Phenols|phenolics]], sugars, [[Amino sugar|amino sugars]], and [[Amino acid|amino acids]]. In the [[Bay of Fundy]], high mortality rates of an abundant tube-dwelling [[Amphipoda|amphipod]] (''Corophium volutator)'' by natural die-offs as well as predation by migrating seabirds contributed to amino sugars released in the surrounding environment and thus, in sea foam.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The organic matter in sea foam has been found to increase dramatically during [[Algal bloom|phytoplankton blooms]] in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Dowd|first=Colin|last2=Ceburnis|first2=Darius|last3=Ovadnevaite|first3=Jurgita|last4=Bialek|first4=Jakub|last5=Stengel|first5=Dagmar B.|last6=Zacharias|first6=Merry|last7=Nitschke|first7=Udo|last8=Connan|first8=Solene|last9=Rinaldi|first9=Matteo|date=2015-10-14|title=Connecting marine productivity to sea-spray via nanoscale biological processes: Phytoplankton Dance or Death Disco?|url=|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=5|pages=14883|doi=10.1038/srep14883|issn=2045-2322|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some research has shown very high concentrations of [[Plankton|microplankton]] in sea foam, with significantly higher numbers of [[Autotroph|autotrophic]] phytoplankton than [[Heterotroph|heterotrophs]]&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Some foams are particularly rich in their diatom population which can make up the majority of the microalgal [[biomass]] in some cases.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; A diversity of bacteria is also present in sea foam; old foam tends to have a higher density of bacteria. One study found that 95% of sea foam bacteria was rod-shaped, while the surrounding surface water contained mostly coccoid-form bacteria and only 5% - 10% rod-shaped bacteria.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; There is also seasonal variability of sea foam composition;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; in some regions there is a seasonal occurrence of pollen in sea foam which can alter its chemistry.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Though foam is not inherently toxic, it may contain high concentrations of contaminants.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Foam bubbles can be coated with or contain these materials which can include [[petroleum]] compounds, [[Pesticide|pesticides]], and [[Herbicide|herbicides]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Longevity and stability ==
[[File:Sea Foam off Amphitrite Point near Ucluelet.webm|thumb|Sea foam off [[Vancouver Island]]]]

Structurally, sea foam is [[Thermodynamically stable|thermodynamically]] unstable, though some sea foam can persist in the environment for several days at most. There are two types of sea foam categorized based on their stability: 1) Unstable or transient foams have very short lifetimes of only seconds. The bubbles formed in sea foam may burst releasing aerosols into the air, contributing to [[sea spray]]. 2) Metastable foams can have a lifetime of several hours to several days; their duration is sometimes attributed to small particles of [[Silicate|silica]], [[calcium]], or [[iron]] which contribute to foam stability and longevity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Additionally, seawater that contains released dissolved organic material from phytoplankton and macrophytic algae that is then agitated in its environment is most likely to produce stable, longer-lasting foam when compared with seawater lacking one of those components. For example, filtered seawater with added with the fronds of the [[kelp]], ''Ecklonia maxima,'' produced foam but it lacked the stability that unfiltered seawater provided. Additionally, kelp fronds that were maintained in flowing water therefore reducing their [[mucus]] coating, were unable to help foam form.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Different types of salt are also found to have varying effects on bubble proximity within sea foam, therefore contributing to its stability.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Ecological role ==

=== Food source ===
[[File:Plankton creates sea foam 2.jpg|thumb| Bubbles of plankton-enriched foam left in a [[tide pool]] after [[high tide]]]]

The presence of sea foam in the marine environment plays a number of ecological roles including providing sources of food and creating habitat. As a food source, sea foam with a stable composition is more important ecologically, as it is able to persist longer and can transport nutrients within the marine environment.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Longer decay times result in a higher chance that energy contained in sea foam will move up the food web into higher [[trophic level]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;In the Bay of Fundy for example, a tube-dwelling [[Amphipoda|amphipod]], ''Corophium volutator,'' can potentially attain 70% of its nutritional requirements from the sugars and amino acids derived from sea foam in its environment. At times however, the sea foam was found to be toxic to this species. It is thought that high concentrations of [[Phenols|phenolics]] and/or the occasional presence of heavy metals or pesticides incorporated into the sea foam from the sea surface contributed to its toxicity.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; On the west coast of [[Cape Peninsula]], [[South Africa]], sea foam often occurs in nearshore marine areas with large kelp beds during periods of strong westerly winds. It is thought that the foam generated in these conditions is an important food source for local organisms due to the presence of organic [[detritus]] in the sea foam.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Material transport ===
Sea foam also acts as a mode of transport for both organisms and nutrients within the marine environment and, at times, into the [[Intertidal zone|intertidal]] or terrestrial environments. Wave action can deposit foam into intertidal areas where it can remain when the tide recedes, bringing nutrients to the intertidal zone.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Additionally, sea foam can become airborne in windy conditions, transporting materials between marine and terrestrial environments.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The ability of sea foam to transport materials is also thought to benefit [[Seaweed|macroalgal]] organisms, as macroalgae propagules can be carried to different microenvironments, thus influencing the tidal landscape and contributing to new possible ecological interactions.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meneses|first=Isabel|date=June 1993|title=Foam as a dispersal agent in the rocky intertidal of central Chile|url=|journal=European Journal of Phycology|language=en|volume=28|issue=2|pages=107–110|doi=10.1080/09670269300650171|issn=0967-0262|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As sea foam is a wet environment, it is conducive habitat to algal spores where [[Propagule|propagules]] can attach to the substrate and avoid risk of [[dissemination]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; When sea foam contains fungi, it can also aid in the decomposition of plant and animal remains in coastal ecosystems.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Habitat ===
Additionally, sea foam is a habitat for a number of marine [[Microorganism|microorganisms]]. Some research has shown the presence of various microphytoplanktonic, nanophytoplanktonic, and diatom groups in seafoam; the phytoplankton groups appeared in significantly higher abundance than in sea surface film and the top [[pelagic zone]]&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Hazards==

=== Toxicity ===
Naturally occurring sea foam is not inherently [[Toxicity|toxic]]; however, it can be exposed to high concentrations of contaminants in the surface microlayer derived from the breakdown of algal blooms, fossil fuel production and transport, and stormwater runoff.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These contaminants contribute to the formation of noxious sea foam through [[adsorption]] onto bubbles. Bubbles may burst and release toxins into the atmosphere in the form of sea spray or [[aerosol]], or they may persist in foams. Toxins released through aerosols and breaking bubbles can be inhaled by humans. The microorganisms that occupy sea foams as habitat have increased susceptibility for contaminant exposure.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Napolitano|first=Guillermo E.|last2=Richmond|first2=Jacqueline E.|date=February 1995|title=Enrichment of biogenic lipids, hydrocarbons and PCBs in stream-surface foams|url=|journal=Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry|language=en|volume=14|issue=2|pages=197–201|doi=10.1002/etc.5620140203|issn=0730-7268|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, these toxic substances can be integrated into the trophic [[food web]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Harmful algal blooms ===
Foams can form following the degradation of [[Harmful algal bloom|harmful algal blooms]] (HABs). These are primarily composed of algal species, but can also consist of [[Dinoflagellate|dinoflagellates]] and [[cyanobacteria]].&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blauw|first=A.N.|last2=Los|first2=F.J.|last3=Huisman|first3=J.|last4=Peperzak|first4=L.|date=November 2010|title=Nuisance foam events and Phaeocystis globosa blooms in Dutch coastal waters analyzed with fuzzy logic|url=|journal=Journal of Marine Systems|volume=83|issue=3-4|pages=115–126|doi=10.1016/j.jmarsys.2010.05.003|issn=0924-7963|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biomass from algae in the bloom is integrated into sea foam in the sea surface microlayer.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; When the impacted sea foam breaks down, toxins from the algae are released into the air causing respiratory issues and occasionally initiating asthma attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/why_habs.html|title=Why do harmful algal blooms occur?|last=Administration|first=US Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric|website=oceanservice.noaa.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Phaeocystis globosa'' is one algal species that is considered problematic, as observed in a study in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Its high biomass accumulation allows it to create large quantities of toxic foam that often wash onto beaches. ''P. globosa'' blooms are initiated in areas of high nutrient availability, often affiliated with coastal locations with a lot of stormwater runoff and [[eutrophication]]. Studies suggest that the development of foam is directly correlated to blooms caused by ''P. globosa'', despite that foam formation typically occurs approximately two weeks after the appearance of an algal bloom offshore. Organic material from ''P. globosa'' was observed decomposing while suspended at the sea surface, but was not observed lower in the water column. ''P. globosa'' is also considered a nuisance species because its large foam formations impair the public's ability to enjoy the beach.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Human activities ===
While sea foam is a common result of the agitation of seawater mixing with organic material in the surface ocean, human activities can contribute to the production of excess and often toxic foam.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition to the organic oils, acids, and proteins that amass in the [[sea surface microlayer]], compounds derived from petroleum production and transport, synthetic surfactants, and pesticide use can enter the sea surface and be incorporated into foam. The pollutants present can also affect the persistence of the foam produced. Crude oil discharged from tankers, motor oil, sewage, and detergents from polluted runoff can create longer-lasting foams.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In one study, [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|polychlorinated biphenyls]] (PCBs), a persistent organic pollutant, were found to amass in sea foams.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

[[Natural gas]] terminals have been cited as contributors to the production of modified foams due to the process of using seawater to convert natural gas to [[Liquefied natural gas|liquified natural gas]].&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Franzo|first=Annalisa|last2=Karuza|first2=Ana|last3=Celussi|first3=Mauro|last4=Fornasaro|first4=Daniela|last5=Beran|first5=Alfred|last6=Di Poi|first6=Elena|last7=Del Negro|first7=Paola|date=2015-04-17|title=Foam production as a side effect of an offshore liquefied natural gas terminal: how do plankton deal with it?|url=|journal=Environmental Science and Pollution Research|language=en|volume=22|issue=11|pages=8763–8772|doi=10.1007/s11356-015-4499-2|issn=0944-1344|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study showed a much greater abundance of heterotrophic [[Prokaryote|prokaryotes]] (archaea and bacteria) and cyanobacteria in foam that was generated near a liquified natural gas terminal. These prokaryotes were able to recycle chemical materials discharged from the terminal, which enhanced microbial growth. Additionally, higher levels of [[total organic carbon]] (TOC) and plankton biomass were recorded in foam generated in close proximity to the terminal. Organic carbon was transferred readily into the pelagic food web after uptake by prokaryotes and ingestion by grazers.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8154">[[File:Food Scraps and Yard Debris Collection in Portland 2010 by Tim Jewett.JPG|thumb|A resident adds kitchen food scraps to yard debris in a roll cart as part of the community's source separated organics (SSO) program.]]

'''Source Separated Organics''' (SSO) is the system by which waste generators segregate [[compostable]] materials from other waste streams at the source for separate collection.

==Types of Materials==
Organic materials, such as yard trimmings, food scraps, wood waste, and paper and paperboard products, typically make up about one-third (by weight) of the municipal solid waste stream.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/epawaste/nonhaz/municipal/pubs/msw2008rpt.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; SSO&amp;nbsp;programs depend on the composition of local waste stream, acceptance specifications for the organics processing facility, and collection methods. The types of organic materials collected include:

* '''Yard and landscaping debris''': floral trimmings, tree trimmings, leaves, grass, brush, and weeds
* '''Food waste''': organic residues generated by the handling, storage, sale, preparation, cooking, and serving of foods, including fruits, vegetables, meat, poultry, seafood, shellfish, bones, rice, beans, pasta, bakery items, cheese, eggshells, and coffee grounds
* '''Paper fibers''': waxed cardboard, napkins, paper towels, uncoated paper plates, tea bags, coffee filters, wooden crates, and greasy pizza boxes
* '''Wood waste''': urban wood waste, woody debris from suburban land clearing, and rural forestry residuals

==Programs==
SSO programs have been launched in a wide range of venues, including single-family residential units, commercial businesses, events, food processors, schools, hospitals, and airports. The [[U.S.&amp;nbsp;Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has assembled tools and resources for food waste management to assist communities interested in launching their own food waste reduction and collection efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=May 1994 |title=Composting Yard Trimmings and Municipal Solid Waste |url=http://www.epa.gov/epawaste/conserve/rrr/composting/pubs/cytmsw.pdf |publisher= |page= |docket=EPA530-R-94-003 |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; SSO&amp;nbsp;materials are typically collected in wet-strength paper bags, unlined plastic bins, or compostable film-plastic liners that meet ASTM 6400 standards.

==Benefits==
The organic fraction of the waste stream is increasingly viewed as a resource.  The resulting products – renewable energy and compost – benefit the environment: reduce greenhouse gas emissions; reduce dependency on foreign energy imports; increase the nutrient composition of our soils; reduce the amount of waste going to landfills; reduce the amount of wet, sloppy waste going to other methods of disposal; reduce the [[leachate]] associated with [[stormwater]] management at landfills; reduce the [[greenhouse gas emissions]] from uncontrolled landfill operations; improve erosion and stormwater control through biofiltration (Schwab, 2000).

==Barriers to adoption==
Communities and businesses that want to implement SSO programs face a few challenges. First, they need participation at the source of their organic waste generation. Second, they need a [[hauler]] willing to collect the organic waste. Third, they need a composting facility permitted to process the material. These challenges have been overcome by many successful SSO programs. Tactics for addressing barriers to adoption include creating outreach and education materials,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stopwaste.org/docs/foodscrap_pitch_2_01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cetonline.org/Publications/res-schools-online.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ct.gov/dep/lib/dep/compost/compost_pdf/schmanual.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; forging partnerships between local businesses to share fixed collection costs,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jgpress.com/archives/_free/000496.html&lt;/ref&gt; and creating incentives for organic diversion through regulated tip fees for solid waste and organics.

==Processing==
Organic materials collected in SSO programs typically get delivered to composting facilities where the waste is turned into nutrient-rich soil amendments known as [[compost]]. Organic feedstock can also be delivered to anaerobic digestion facilities that produce [[biogas]], a source of [[renewable energy]].
Anaerobic digestion of the organic fraction of MSW Municipal Solid Waste has been found to be in a number of LCA&amp;nbsp;analysis studies&lt;ref&gt;http://www.idosi.org/gjer/gjer3(3)09/4.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eurojournals.com/ejsr_34_3_11.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; to be more environmentally effective, than landfill, incineration or [[pyrolysis]]. The resulting biogas (methane) can then be used for cogeneration (electricity and heat preferably on or close to the site of production) and can be used in gas combustion engines or turbines. With further upgrading to synthetic natural gas it can be injected into the natural gas network or further refined to [[hydrogen]] for use in stationary cogeneration fuel cells.

'''Steven Todd Kirsch''' (born December 24, 1956) is an American [[serial entrepreneur]] who has started seven companies: [[Mouse Systems]], [[FrameMaker|Frame Technology Corp.]], [[Infoseek]], Propel, Abaca, [[OneID]], and Token. He invented and [[patent|patented]] an early version of the [[optical mouse]]. In 2007, his personal fortune was estimated at $230 million, the majority earned from the IPO of Infoseek and the acquisition of Frame Technology.&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;

==Career==

Kirsch has a [[Bachelor of Science]] and a [[Master of Science]] in [[electrical engineering]] and [[computer science]] from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirschfoundation.org/who/about.html |title=Kirsch Foundation: About The Founders |publisher=Kirschfoundation.org |accessdate= July 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steven Kirsch founded [[Mouse Systems Corporation]] in 1982. After he left the company, he co-founded [[FrameMaker|Frame Technology Corp.]] in 1986 to market the FrameMaker publishing software. After Frame was acquired by [[Adobe Systems]] for $500 million, he founded a [[Web portal]] company, [[Infoseek Corporation]], in 1994. After Infoseek was acquired by [[The Walt Disney Company]], he founded [[Propel Software Corporation]] in 1999. 

He set up a $75 million [[charitable fund]] and became an [[philanthropist]]. In 2003, [[Hillary Clinton]] presented Kirsch with a National Caring Award from the Caring Institute in [[Washington DC]]. The award celebrates those special individuals who, in transcending self, devote their lives in service to others, especially the disadvantaged, the poor, the disabled and the dying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.caringinstitute.org/CaringAwards.taf?function=detail&amp;id=32800 |title=2003 Adult National Caring Award Winner |date= November 16, 2003 |publisher=Caringinstitute.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 he founded Abaca, which made a [[spam filter]] (99.99% accurate according to two reviews).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tolly Group Review of Abaca|url=http://www.abaca.com/downloads/Tolly_Abaca%20Email%20Protection%20Gateway.pdf|publisher=Tolly Group|accessdate=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spam Star|url=http://www.abaca.com/downloads/networkcomputing_aug09.pdf|publisher=Network Computing|accessdate=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abaca was acquired by [[Proofpoint, Inc.]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |work= Press release |date= July 25, 2013 |title= Proofpoint, Inc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3505">'''Teichoscopy''' or teichoscopia,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sacred-texts.com/wmn/rca/rca02.htm Teichoscopy&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "viewing from the walls," is a recurring narrative strategy in ancient Greek literature. One famous instance of teichoscopy occurs in Homer's ''[[Iliad]],'' Book 3, lines 121-244.

The passage begins with [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] approached in her chamber by [[Iris (mythology)|Iris]], disguised as her sister-in-law [[Laodice (mythology)|Laodice]], the daughter of [[Priam]]. Helen is then led to the walls of the Skaian gates, where she is summoned by Priam, who asks her to point out the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaean]] heroes she sees on the Trojan plain. Below her, the two armies are preparing for the duel between [[Menelaus]] and [[Paris]].  Helen identifies [[Agamemnon]], [[Odysseus]], [[Ajax the Great|Telamonian (Greater) Ajax]], and [[Idomeneus]].  She also mentions that she does not see her brothers [[Castor and Pollux]], who unbeknownst to her are already dead back in Greece. After this scene, the duel commences, with both armies praying to [[Zeus]] and the rest of the gods on [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]] to open the action.&lt;ref&gt;Toohey, Peter. ''Reading Epic: An Introduction to Ancient Narratives''.  New York: Routledge, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
According to Maria C. Pantelia, Helen becomes the 'author' of a catalog when she describes for Priam the qualities of the most important Greek warriors."&lt;ref&gt;Pantelia, Maria C. ''Helen and the Last Song for Hector.'' Transactions of the American Philological Association 132.1-2 (2002) 21-27 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/transactions_of_the_american_philological_association/v132/132.1pantelia.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been suggested that the teichoscopy, as well as the duel between [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] and [[Menelaus]], would have more likely occurred at the beginning of the war rather than during its tenth year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barrons/iliad3.asp]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, although [[Homer]] is not at the beginning of the [[Trojan War]], he is at the beginning of the poem and therefore uses the teichoscopia as a poetic structure that provides information and suspense important for the remainder of the play and the duel to come.

Although teichoscopy can be viewed as simply a vignette that surveys the major Greek warriors, it has been suggested that Homer is also trying to reveal something about Helen.  Helen’s open admiration of both the Greek and [[Troy|Trojan]] warriors is viewed as ironic, as it seems odd that the major cause of a war that has brought devastation to the Trojans should praise the enemy. However, by doing this, Homer is, according to Frederic Will, “insisting on the importance, and centrality, of Helen’s viewpoint.  He is integrating a traditional form artistically.”&lt;ref&gt;Remarks on Counterpoint Characterization in Euripides.  Frederic Will.  ''The Classical Journal'', Vol. 55, No. 8. (May, 1960), pp. 338-344.  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3294564].&lt;/ref&gt;

The main object of teichoscopy is the synchronous discussion of events, as opposed to events being reported later by messengers or other eyewitnesses. It is a well-established technique in [[dramaturgy]].

Natural phenomena, too, may be conveyed by this device. Far-off drama such as the sun rising, or a description of stars across the firmament lend themselves to this treatment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1820">'''The Regenerative Medicine Institute''' (REMEDI), was established in 2003 as a Centre for Science, Technology &amp; Engineering in collaboration with [[National University of Ireland, Galway]].  It obtained an award of €14.9 million from [[Science Foundation Ireland]] over five years.

It conducts basic research and applied research in [[regenerative medicine]], an emerging field that combines the technologies of [[gene therapy]] and adult [[stem cell therapy]].  The goal is to use cells and genes to regenerate healthy tissues that can be used to repair or replace other tissues and organs in a minimally invasive approach.

Centres for Science, Engineering &amp; Technology help link scientists and engineers in partnerships across academia and industry to address crucial research questions, foster the development of new and existing Irish-based technology companies, attract industry that could make an important contribution to Ireland and its economy, and expand educational and career opportunities in Ireland in science and engineering. CSETs must exhibit outstanding research quality, intellectual breadth, active collaboration, flexibility in responding to new research opportunities, and integration of research and education in the fields that SFI supports.{{Unreferenced|date=March 2014}}

A '''Turing tarpit''' (or '''Turing tar-pit''') is any [[programming language]] or [[computer interface]] that allows for flexibility in function but is difficult to learn and use because it offers little or no support for common tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TuringTarpit | title=Turing Tarpit | website=c2.com | date=10 March 2010 | accessdate=7 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase was coined in 1982 by [[Alan Perlis]] in the ''[[Epigrams on Programming]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Perlis|first1=A|journal=ACM SIGPLAN Notices|volume=17|issue=9|pages=7–13|title=Epigrams on Programming|date=September 1982|isbn=|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1083808|archiveurl=http://pu.inf.uni-tuebingen.de/users/klaeren/epigrams.html|archivedate=1996-03-26|publisher=Yale University|doi=10.1145/947955.1083808|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|54. Beware of the Turing tar-pit in which everything is possible but nothing of interest is easy.}}

In any [[Turing completeness|Turing complete]] language, it is possible to write any computer program, so in a very rigorous sense nearly all programming languages are equally capable. Showing that theoretical ability is not the same as usefulness in practice, Turing tarpits are characterized by having a simple [[abstract machine]] that requires the user to deal with many details in the solution of a problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://practicingruby.com/articles/shared/bwgflabwncjv | title=Exploring the depths of a Turing tarpit | website=practicingruby.com | date=7 February 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204180904/http://practicingruby.com/articles/shared/bwgflabwncjv | archivedate=4 February 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the extreme opposite are interfaces that can perform very complex tasks with little human intervention but become obsolete if requirements change slightly.

Some [[esoteric programming languages]], such as [[Brainfuck]], are specifically referred to as "Turing tarpits"&lt;ref name=chandra2014geek&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chandra|first1=V|title=Geek Sublime: The Beauty of Code, the Code of Beauty|date=2014|publisher=Graywolf Press|isbn=9781555973261|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-4eBAwAAQBAJ&amp;q=turing%20tarpit|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; because they deliberately implement the minimum functionality necessary to be classified as Turing complete languages.  Using such languages is a form of [[mathematical recreation]]: programmers can work out how to achieve basic programming constructs in an extremely difficult but mathematically Turing-equivalent language.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020609152409/http://www.catseye.mb.ca/esoteric/index.html Esoteric Topics in Computer Programming], Cat's Eye Technologies, Canada.

The '''University Marine Biological Station Millport''' (UMBSM) was a [[higher education]] institution located on the island of [[Great Cumbrae]] in the [[Firth of Clyde]], [[Scotland]], and run by the University of [[University of London|London]] (of which it was a [[University of London#Central academic bodies|central academic body]]). It closed in 2013 and is now Millport Field Centre, run by the [[Field Studies Council]].

Located just outside the town, it has an extensive curriculum and research programme, with an influx of students throughout the academic year. A Museum and Aquarium (named after the founder, [[David Robertson (naturalist)|David Robertson]]) is open to visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.field-studies-council.org/centres/scotland/millport/learn/robertson-museum-and-aquarium.aspx|title=Robertson Museum and Aquarium|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=FSC Millport|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2003 the station took delivery of the [[Macduff, Aberdeenshire|Macduff]]-built, 22-metre marine [[research vessel]] RV ''Aora''. The station also functions as a Meteorological Office Weather Station and Admiralty Tide Monitor.

==History==
[[File:Marine Biological Station, Millport - geograph.org.uk - 426885.jpg|thumb|The University Marine Biological Station Millport]]
''The Ark'', an {{convert|84|ft|m|abbr=off|adj=on}} lighter, was fitted out as a floating laboratory by the father of modern [[oceanography]], [[John Murray (oceanographer)|Sir John Murray]]. She formed the Scottish Marine Station for 12 years from 1884. In 1885 she was moved from [[Granton, Edinburgh|Granton]] and drawn up on the shore at Port Loy, Cumbrae.&lt;ref name="UniGlasgowHistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.field-studies-council.org/centres/scotland/millport/about/history.aspx|title=History - FSC Millport|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attracted a stream of distinguished scientists, drawn by the richness of the fauna and flora of the Firth of Clyde, but closed in 1903.

In Millport, an amateur naturalist, David Robertson, was encouraged by meeting [[Anton Dohrn]] and by the wealth of findings from the [[Challenger expedition]]. In 1894 he formed a committee to build a marine station in Millport and took over ''The Ark''. Millport Marine Biological Station was opened in 1897 by [[John Murray (oceanographer)|Sir John Murray]]. ''The Ark'' was totally destroyed by a great storm on the night of 20 January 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = PG Moore &amp; JA Gibson|date=January 2007| title = Marine Station at Millport| journal = The Linnean| volume = 23| issue = 1| pages = 31–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 July 1904 ''Scotia'', the ship of Dr [[William Speirs Bruce]]'s [[Scottish National Antarctic Expedition]], returned to her first Scottish landing site, on the Isle of Cumbrae.

From this beginning the station was gradually built up to its present size. The original building proved too small for the purpose and an architectural copy was built alongside. From 1966 to 1987 the station ran under the Directorship of [[Ronald Ian Currie]] [[FRSE]] who was responsible for the creation of RV Challenger and RV Calanus.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/obits_alpha/currie_ronald.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012 it was announced that the University Marine Biological Station Millport would be forced to close after the [[Higher Education Funding Council for England]] withdrew the grant of 400,000 pounds that it gave to the [[University of London]] to run the station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-20797045 |title=University Marine Biological Station Millport may close |date=20 December 2012 |author= |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=8 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; UMBSM closed on 31 October 2013.&lt;ref name="UniGlasgowHistory" /&gt;

Ownership was transferred to the [[Field Studies Council]] on 1 January 2014.&lt;ref name="UniGlasgowHistory" /&gt; In May 2014 a four-million-pound package of funding was announced that is intended to allow a comprehensive programme of development and refurbishment to be completed over five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buildscotland.co.uk/construction-news/180652/millport-marine-research-stations-reopens|title=Millport marine research station reopens|last=|first=|date=16 May 2014|website=|publisher=Build Scotand|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Linux challenge ==
Windows and [[Linux]] are very different; not just technologically, but philosophically. Tools are a major component to establishing DevOps, and the lack of Windows-centric tools limited early Windows DevOps adoptions as most initial supporting technologies emerged from Linux and [[open-source]] communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; WinOps boils down to addressing the same challenges as DevOps, using different tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

This model admits finite-rate chemical reactions and thus the process of detonation consists of the following stages. First, an [[infinitesimal]]ly thin shock wave compresses the explosive to a high pressure called the '''von Neumann spike'''. At the von Neumann spike point the explosive still remains unreacted. The spike marks the onset of the zone of exothermic chemical reaction, which finishes at the [[Chapman-Jouguet state]]. After that, the detonation products expand backward.

In the reference frame in which the shock is stationary, the flow following the shock is [[Speed of sound|subsonic]].  Because of this, energy release behind the shock is able to be transported acoustically to the shock for its support.  For a self-propagating detonation, the shock relaxes to a speed given by the [[Chapman–Jouguet condition]], which induces the material at the end of the reaction zone to have a locally sonic speed in the reference frame in which the shock is stationary.  In effect, all of the chemical energy is harnessed to propagate the shock wave forward.

However, in the 1960s, experiments revealed that gas-phase detonations were most often characterized by unsteady, three-dimensional structures, which can only in an averaged sense be predicted by one-dimensional steady theories. Indeed, such waves are quenched as their structure is destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Edwards, D.H. |author2=Thomas, G.O. |author3=Nettleton, M.A. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Diffraction of a Planar Detonation Wave at an Abrupt Area Change|journal=Journal of Fluid Mechanics|volume= 95|issue=1|pages =79–96|year= 1979|doi=10.1017/S002211207900135X|bibcode = 1979JFM....95...79E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2514/5.9781600865497.0341.0357 |volume=75 |journal=Progress in Astronautics &amp; Aeronautics|year=1981|title=Diffraction of a Planar Detonation in Various Fuel-Oxygen Mixtures at an Area Change|isbn=978-0-915928-46-0|pages=341|editors=A.
