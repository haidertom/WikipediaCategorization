'''Ancient South Arabian art''' was the art of the Pre-Islamic cultures of the southern [[Arabian peninsula]], which was produced from the 3rd millennium BC until the 7th century AD.&lt;ref name="Brockhaus"&gt;Der Brockhaus Kunst. Künstler, Epochen, Sachbegriffe. 3rd revised and expanded edition. F. A. Brockhaus. Mannheim 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and development ==
[[File:Istanbul - Museo archeol. - Iscrizione araba yemenita - sec. III a.C. - Foto G. Dall'Orto 28-5-2006.jpg|thumb|300px|Old Arabian inscription from 3rd century BC South Arabia, in a [[Old South Arabian language]]. [[İstanbul Archaeology Museums]]]]

Old Arabian art experienced its first flourishing at the beginning of the 1st millennium BC at the time of the [[Ancient history of Yemen|South Arabian]] classical culture,&lt;ref&gt;Dated by the [[Ancient history of Yemen#Chronology|long chronology]].&lt;/ref&gt; centred on the kingdoms of the [[Sabaeans]] and [[Minaeans]] in modern [[Yemen]]. The 5th century BC marked the golden age of Saba, whose main centres were [[Ma'rib]] and [[Sirwah]].&lt;ref name="Brockhaus" /&gt; The region was known to the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] as '[[Arabia Felix]]' (Fortunate Arabia) as a result of its wealth.

In addition to influences from the [[Ancient Near East|Near East]], from the 5th century BC there was a strong [[Ancient Greek art|Greek]] influence, which seems to have played an important role in the continued development of ancient South Arabian art.{{citation needed|date= September 2018}} The Geometric, stylised forms typical of ancient South Arabian art, both in sculpture and in architecture, took on smoother forms form the 5th century BC.{{citation needed|date= September 2018}} The kingdom of the [[Nabataeans]], established in the northern part of the Arabian peninsula in the late 4th century BC acted as an intermediary between the Arabian cultures and those of the [[Mediterranean]].

The kings of [[Himyar| Himyar]] gained control of South Arabia at the end of the 3rd century AD. With the [[Early Muslim conquests|Islamic expansion]] in the second half of the 6th century AD, South Arabian art was displaced by early [[Islamic art]].

== Periodisation==
Since scholarship on ancient South Arabia has long concentrated on [[philology|philological]] investigation of [[Old South Arabian]] inscriptions, the material culture of South Arabia has received little scholarly attention, so that little work has been done on the provenance of artefacts. Periodisations have only been developed for some regions and a general periodisation of South Arabian art is not yet possible. As a result, ancient South Arabian artefacts are categorised by stylistic features, not chronology. A general division of South Arabian art into three periods has been proposed by [[Jürgen Schmidt (archaeologist)|Jürgen Schmidt]]. According to him, the first phase sees the individual motifs begin to develop, the second sees the individual artistic forms become canonised, and in the last period there is some influence from foreign styles, particularly Greek art.

== Architecture ==
=== Construction methods===
[[File:Griffon hadhramaut.jpg|thumb|Decorated capital of a pillar from the royal palace of [[Shabwa]]; stratigraphic context: first half of the 3rd century BC.]]
Unlike [[Mesopotamia]], ancient South Arabia was dominated by stone buildings. Only in the coastal areas and the [[Hadhramaut]] capital of [[Shabwa]] were there also large numbers of mudbrick structures. For monumental buildings, large hewn blocks of stone were used, which were fitted together without mortar and unhewn stone which required mortar. [[Lime mortar]], mud, and [[asphalt]] were used as binding materials. In tall walls, vertical lead props and horizontal pins and brackets were inserted as well. Only the exterior face of the stones was smoothed. Larger walls were often double-shelled, with the rough sides of the stones abutting one another inside the wall. Possibly for aesthetic reasons, the walls of monumental structures were sloped, and buttresses or small bastions helped maintain the stability of the wall.

In the 5th century BC, a new kind of stoneworking appeared, in which the edges of the stones were polished, while the centre of the exposed faces were pecked. This 'marginally drafted' style changed over time, making a chronological arrangement of walls built in this style possible.&lt;ref&gt;Gus W. Van Beek, "Marginally Drafted, Pecked Masonry," in: Richard Le Baron Bowen Jr.; Frank P. Albright: ''Archaeological Discoveries in South Arabia'' (''Publications of the American Foundation for the Study of Man'', Volume 2) Hopkins Baltimore, 1958, pp. 287–299.&lt;/ref&gt;

Interior walls were either plastered (sometimes featuring wall paintings) or covered with stone cladding, with paintings imitating ashlar blocks and sometimes even three-dimensional friezes. Little is known about ceiling construction, although [[vault (architecture)|vault]]ing survives in pillbox-graves - simple [[gable]]d roofs decorated with images. 3&amp;nbsp;cm thick translucent marble or alabaster sheets, sometimes with incised decoration, served as window panes.

Columns were a very important structural element. Until the 5th century BC, they were undecorated monoliths with rectangular or square cross-sections. This sort of column is found in the entrance hall of the Awwam temple and Ḥaram-Bilqīs in Ma'rib, for example. From the 5th century BC, the corners were reduced until eventually they became round columns. From the 5th century, columns also had capitals - initially simple plinths, which subsequently developed into various forms.&lt;ref&gt;Grohmann, ''Arabien'' pp. 210–214&lt;/ref&gt; From the 2nd century BC, these forms were significantly influenced by [[Hellenistic]] architecture and later [[Sasanian architecture|Sasanian]] influence is detectable.

=== Secular architecture===
[[File:Shabwa map.svg|thumb|300px|Plan of the inner city of Shabwa]]
Archaeological excavations of ancient South Arabian settlements reveal a highly developed civic culture with complex irrigation techniques. For example, the [[Marib dam]] dates back to the 9th century BC and remains of it are still visible today. Substantial remains from the 6th century BC can still be seen. There were cities with public buildings made from polished limestone blocks with inscriptions naming their builders, along with city gates, fortifications, streets, temples, markets, and royal residences.&lt;ref name="Brockhaus" /&gt; 

As the inscriptions show, numerous fortified cities (''hagar'') existed in pre-Islamic South Arabia. Archaeology has so far only revealed civic facilities; unfortified settlements have not yet been investigated archaeologically. The cities were often located in valleys on natural or artificial raised areas, which protected them from floods. Cities were also founded on plateaus or at the feet of mountains, as in the case of the Himyarite capital, [[Zafar, Yemen|Zafar]]. The majority of ancient South Arabian cities were rectangular or nearly rectangular, like Ma'rib and Shabwa. A notable example of this rectangular city plan is the Minaean capital city, [[Qarnawu]].&lt;ref&gt;Grohmann, ''Arabien'', pp. 143–144&lt;/ref&gt; The rectangular plan of that city has a main street running through the centre and side streets bisecting it perpendicularly at regular intervals, which indicates central planning, either at the time of original foundation or after a destruction event. However, round and entirely irregular city plans are also found. Compared to other Near Eastern cities, the ancient South Arabian cities had a relatively small total area; the largest city of South Arabia, Ma'rib, covered only 110 ha.

All cities were protected by a city wall (two consecutive walls in the case of Shabwa), with at least two gates, which could be protected by towers. The course of the walls, which was either simply structured or included bastions, had to follow the terrain, especially in mountainous regions, and this is what created irregular city plans. Sometimes cities were protected by citadels, as in Shabwa, [[Raidan]], [[Cana, Yemen|Qana']], and the [[Citadel of Rada'a]].&lt;ref&gt;Jean-François Breton: ''Les fortifications d'Arabie méridionale du 7e au 1er siècle avant notre ère'' (''Archäologische Berichte aus dem Yemen'', 8) Philipp von Zabern, Mainz 1994 {{ISBN|3-8053-1487-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ruins6.JPG|thumb|left|Ruins of [[Khor Rori]]]]
Due to a lack of archaeological investigation, the civic centres are so far only poorly known. In [[Timna]] in Qataban, there was a large open space inside the southern gate, from which streets ran in various directions. In addition to the normal residential buildings, fortresses, palaces and temples have been detected in various cities. Substantial excavations have only been undertaken at [[Khor Rori]] and Shabwa. At Shabwa, too, a large open space was located on the inside of the gate, with the royal palace located on one side of it. From this open space, a wide street ran directly through the city, with smaller streets crossing this main street at right angles.

In addition to civic fortifications, there are also other fortifications, which were located at important crossroads or key points in the irrigation system. Substantial ruins of such fortresses still exist,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [[Hermann von Wissmann (geographer)|Hermann von Wissmann]], [[Maria Höfner]]: ''Beiträge zur historischen Geographie des vorislamischen Südarabien'' (Abhandlungen der geistes- und sozialwissenschaftlichen Klasse der Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur in Mainz, Jahrgang 1952, Nr. 4). Verlag der Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur in Mainz, Mainz 1953, pp. 137–139 and photograph 15, where the ruined castle of Ḥuṣn el-ʿUrr in Hadhramaut is described.&lt;/ref&gt; but none have been excavated. Even so it is clear that these fortresses contained residential quarters as well as temples and water sources. To secure whole areas, barrier walls, which blocked passes and similar bottlenecks, were built, like the wall of [[Libna]], which would have blocked the road from Qana' to Shabwa. 

Due to the climate, irrigation systems were necessary for agriculture. The simplest elements of these systems were various kinds of well and cistern. The largest cisterns could hold up to 12,800 m³. For the efficiency of these wells and citadels, canal networks were essential. These collected and stored the water from the [[wadi]]s when it rained. The most impressive example of these structures is the Dam of Ma'rib, which blocked the Wadi Dhana with a span of almost 600 m and channeled its water through two sluice gates into two "primary canals", which distributed it to the fields by means of a network of smaller canals. Such structures have been detected or attested by inscriptions elsewhere as well. In [[Najran]], [[aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct]]s were carved into the cliffs to lead the water away.

In various places in South Arabia, especially in mountain passes (''manqal''), paved roads were built, which were sometimes many kilometres long and several metres wide.

=== Religious architecture ===
Compared to secular structures, temples are generally better known, so that it has been possible to develop a possible typology and history of development. In the following, the systems proposed by {{ill|Jürgen Schmidt (archaeologist)|de|Jürgen Schmidt (Archäologe)|lt=Jürgen Schmidt}} and (in more detail) M. Jung are described, which take into account both the floor plans and the actual appearance of the structure.&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Schmidt, "Altsüdarabische Kultbauten." Werner Daum (ed.): ''Jemen''. Pinguin-Verlag, Innsbruck / Umschau-Verlag, Frankfurt a. M. 1987, pp. 81–101. This replaced the typology of {{ill|Adolf Grohmann (Arabist)|de|Adolf Grohmann (Arabist)|lt=Adolf Grohmann}} which only took account of the different types of floor plan; ''Handbuch der Altertumswissenschaft, Kulturgeschichte des Alten Orients, Dritter Abschnitt, Vierter Unterabschnitt: Arabien'' (München, 1963), pp. 157 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Comparatively few temples have been excavated to date, so these schemas remain provisional.

The oldest south Arabian sanctuaries belong to the prehistoric period and were simple stone [[monolith]]s, sometimes surrounded by stone circles or [[Mortar (masonry)|mortarless]] masonry walls. In a second phase, actual temples were constructed. These temples were simple rectangular stone structures without roofs. Their interiors were initially very different from one another. Some cult buildings at Jabal Balaq al-Ausaṭ sothwest of Ma'rib, which consist of a courtyard and a tripartite [[cella]], provide a link to a temple type found only in Saba, which had a rectangular ground plan and a [[propylon]] and was divided into two parts - an inner courtyard with pillars on three sides and a tripartite cella. Schmidt includes in this type the temple of the moon god [[Wadd]] built around 700 BC between Ma'rib and Sirwah at Wadd ḏū-Masmaʿ, as well as the temple built by [[Yada'il Dharih I]] at [[Al-Masajid (archaeological site)|Al-Masajid]], which is surrounded by a rectangular wall. Later examples of this schema are found at Qarnawu (5th century BC) and {{ill|Al-Huqqa|de|al-Ḥuqqa}} (1st century BC). The entrance hall of the great Temple of [[Awwam]] in Ma'rib might belong to this group. This temple dates from the 9th-5th centuries BC and consisted of an oval ashlar structure which was over 100 metres long and was linked to a rectangular entrance hall, which was surrounded by a [[peristyle]] consisting of 32 five-metre high monolithic pillars. Only a few traces of this structure remain today.&lt;ref name="Brockhaus" /&gt;

In the other kingdoms, this type contrasted with the [[hypostyle]] 'multi-support temples' which were built with square, rectangular or even assymetrical ground plans and were surrounded by regularly spaced columns. In contrast to the aforementioned Sabaean temples, these structures were not arranged around a cella or an altar. Initially these temple contained six or eight pillars, but later they ranged up to thirty-five. [[Klaus Schippmann]] has identified yet another type: the Hadhramite 'terrace temple', seven examples of which are known to date.&lt;ref&gt;Schippmann, ''Geschichte der alt-südarabischen Reiche'', p. 112. See also Alexander V. Sedov, ''Temples of Ancient Ḥaḍramawt. Arabia Antica 3.'' PLUS, Pisa 2005 {{ISBN|88-8492-211-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; All these temples are accessed by a great stairway, which leads up to an enclosed terrace, on top of which stands a cella with a podium. 

It is still unclear whether there were images of deities, but the statuettes of humans which were dedicated in the sanctuary of Ma'rib demonstrate that highly developed bronze casts existed by the middle of the 1st century, on which the individual donor was recorded by means of an inscription. Stone pedestals with dedicatory inscriptions show that votive statuettes made of precious metals and bronze were created in Himyar until late antiquity. There were also alabaster statuettes - figures wearing smooth, knee-length robes, with their arms outstretched.&lt;ref name="Brockhaus" /&gt;

== Sculpture ==
The most remarkable artworks aside from architecture from pre-Islamic South Arabia are sculptures. In addition to bronze (and occasionally gold and silver), limestone was a common material for sculptures, especially alabaster and marble. Typical features of ancient South Arabian sculpture are cubic base forms, a plump overall shape and very strong emphasis on the head. The rest of the body is often depicted only in a schematic and reduced fashion; often only the upper body is depicted at all. Much South Arabian art is characterised by minimal attention to realistic proportion, which manifests with large ears and a long, narrow nose. In most cases, sculpture in the round and reliefs faced directly at the viewer; in reliefs the frontal perspective typical of [[ancient Egyptian art]], in which the head and legs are depicted from the side, but the torso from the front, is occasionally encountered. Pupils were made of coloured material which was inserted into holes in the eyes. Initially, drapery was not depicted, but later it was indicated by deep grooves or layers. There are no general characteristics in the arrangement of arms and legs.

There are very few examples of large ancient South Arabian sculptures, so the inscription on an over-life-size bronze statue of the son of the Sabaean king {{ill|Dhamar'ali Yuhabirr|de}} is of particular interest. It reveals that the statue was made by a Greek artist and his Arabian assistant. Much more common are small alabaster statues, portraits and reliefs, which generally depict people and more rarely animals or monsters (dragons and winged lions with human heads), and whole scenes in the case of flat reliefs. A particularly popular scene shows a vine bearing grapes with animals or birds nibbling at it and a man who aims a bow at an animal (or variations thereon). Scenes from life are also depicted in reliefs, such as feasts, battles, and musical performances, as well as scenes of the dead meeting with a deity.

Alongside the larger artworks, ancient South Arabia also produced a whole range of different smaller artefacts. As elsewhere, ceramics were a major medium, but it has not yet been possible to arrange this material typologically or chronologically, so unlike in the rest of the Near East it does not help to date endividual stratigraphic layers. Some general statements are still possible, however. The manufacture of ceramics was very simple; only part of the vessel was turned on a [[potter's wheel]]. Jugs and bowls of various sizes are common, mostly decorated with engraved or dotted motives, but painted patterns and attached bumps, prongs, or even animal heads are also found. In addition to these everyday ceramic items, some pottery figurines have also been found.

Smaller stone artefacts include bottles, oil lamps, vases, and vessels with animal heads as handles. [[Intaglio (sculpture)|Intaglio]]s and imitations of Egyptian [[Scarab (artifact)|scarabs]]. In addition to these, there are also various friezes attached to various parts of buildings, which include zigzag patterns, tessellations, perpendicular lines, dentils, niches, small false doors, and meanders, as well as floral and figural elements, including series of ibex heads and grape vines. Other common artistic elements in buildings include [[Rosette (design)|rosette]]s and [[volute]]s, ears of corn, and pomegranates. In two excavations, wallpaintings have also been discovered: geometirc paintings in the temple of al-Huqqa and figural paintings from the French excavations at Shabwat. Artefacts in wood have not survived, but stone images of furniture allow us some insight into ancient South Arabian woodworking.

[[File:Hadramitic cup Louvre Inv31931.jpg|thumb|Hadhramite Metal bowl (2nd–3rd century AD)]]
On the other hand, small bronze and copper artefacts are common, including vases and other [[Repoussé and chasing|chased]] copper or bronze vessels, lamps, handles and animal figurines. Jewellery is also common, including partially golden necklaces, gold plates with images of animals and small golden sculptures.

[[File:'Amdan Bayyin coin.jpg|thumb|Himyarite coin of [['Amdan Bayyin|ʿAmdan Bayyin]] of Raidan (Type 9)]]
As in other cultures of the ancient 'periphery' which minted coinage, the ancient South Arabian coinage was modeled on [[ancient Greek coinage]]. Silver coinage is well known from South Arabia, while bronze and gold coinages are comparatively rare. The following typology generally follows that of [[Günther Dembski]].&lt;ref&gt;Günther Dembski, Die Münzen der Arabia Felix. In: Werner Daum (Hrsg.): Jemen. Pinguin-Verlag, Innsbruck / Umschau-Verlag, Frankfurt a. M. 1987, S. 132–135, {{ISBN|3-7016-2251-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It must be noted that the numbering of the coin types only partially reflects a certain chronology.
# The oldest South Arabian coinage was probably minted around 300 BC. It consists of imitations of Old style [[Athens|Athenian]] [[tetradrachm]]s, with the head of [[Athena]] on the obverse and an owl, crescent moon, and olive twig on the reverse. Unlike their models, however, the South Arabian coins were marked with indications of their denomination: full units with the lett ''n'', half units with a ''g'', quarters with a ''t'', and eighths with an ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
# A somewhat later series has various monograms and/or letters on the reverse whose significance is not yet understood.
# The third, Qatabanian group has a head on both faces, with the name of the minting state, Harib in Timna, on the reverse.
# The next group is probably also Qatabanian. An owl again appears on the reverse, along with the name ''Shahr Hilal'', the letters ''ḏ'' and ''ḥ'', and the 'Yanuf-monogram'.
# Sometime in the 2nd century BC comes the following type, which imitates the New Style Athenian tetradrachms, while retaining the legends and monograms of the earlier coins.
# The sixth type is distiguished from the preceding type, since it has no inscription, only symbols or monograms.
# Perhaps in connection with the [[Arabian_Peninsula_in_the_Roman_era#Aelius_Gallus_expedition|expedition]] of [[Aelius Gallus]] in 25 BC, elements of [[Roman coinage]] appear in this minting. 
# A single Hadhramite group seems entirely different. They depict a bull labelled as the god Sin, the name of the palace ''s&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;qr'', a head with a radiant crown or an eagle, in various arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;On this type and its variants: S. C. H. Munro-Hay, "The coinage of Shabwa (Hadhramawt), and other  ancient South Arabian Coinage in the National Museum, Aden," ''Syria'' 68 (1991) 393-418&lt;/ref&gt;
# This type is particularly significant for the history of South Arabia. It bears a head on the reverse, with the name of a king and minting state (usually [[Raidan]]) and monograms.
# There are some isolated bronze coins which have a head with letters on the obverse and an eagle on the reverse. They are probably from Hadhramaut.
The end of South Arabian coinage is not certainly dated, but was probably somewhere around AD 300.

The '''''Apparition of Christ to the Virgin''''' is a painting by the Italian Renaissance master [[Filippino Lippi]], executed around 1493 and now housed in the [[Alte Pinakothek]] of [[Munich]], [[Germany]].

The work dates to around to the period after Lippi's return to [[Florence]] after his works in the [[Carafa Chapel]] at [[Rome]]. It is perhaps to be identified with the panel mentioned by the Renaissance art historian [[Giorgio Vasari]] in the church of  San Francesco al Palco of [[Prato]]. In the 19th century, [[Ludwig I of Bavaria]] acquired the paintings, which later, together with the other royal collections,  was included in the Alte Pinakothek.

==Description==
The painting portrays Mary kneeling under the God, shown in a golden disc amongst the clouds in the sky. She is flanked by the apparitions of the Angel of the Annunciation and the Virgin Mary. The unusual iconography was perhaps a precise request of the commissioners, who would be also referenced by the monastery on the hill at the left.

Mary, according to the preachings by [[Girolamo Savonarola]] which were popular in Florence at the time, is aged and with a dramatic expression on her face. Her larger figure is perhaps connected to the particular worship she received in the original location of the painting.

The landscape in the background is depicted using [[aerial perspective]], with echoes of the [[early Netherlandish paintings]] through Italian predecessors of Filippino, including his father [[Filippo Lippi]]. There are some small characters such as a few monks, depicted on a river view (perhaps the [[Bisenzio (river)|Bisenzio]] near Florence) commanded by rocky formations on the right. Far away is a misty city, identifiable most likely with Florence due to the presence of a large dome resembling that of  [[Cathedral of Florence|Santa Maria del Fiore]].

The panel has a [[predella]] with ''Christ Hold by an Angel and Six Saints''.

When using [[pastel]], an artist may often use a colored paper support, using areas of [[pigment]] to define lights and darks, while leaving the bare support to show through as the mid-tone.

When making a portrait for example heavy dark tones to represent a moody or dark side to a personality. Tone can also be used to make the face look [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]], for example darker tones around the chin, nose and eyes; lighter tones on forehead, nose and cheeks.

'''Babs Reingold''' (born in [[Caracas, Venezuela]]) is an American contemporary interdisciplinary artist working with sculpture, [[Installation art|installation]], video, painting and drawing. She currently lives and works in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]] and maintains a studio in [[New York City]].

==Art==
Reingold is best known as a visual and [[conceptual artist]] for creating alternate ambiguities with her wall art and installations as they relate to the environment, poverty and beauty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.florida-arts.org/programs/fellowship/displayfellow.cfm?id=420 Babs Reingold, 2010 Fellow in Visual Art, Pinellas County, Florida Division of Cultural Affairs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017025132/http://www.florida-arts.org/programs/fellowship/displayfellow.cfm?id=420 |date=October 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She draws on her early experiences of hardship to create elaborate installations using domestic objects and natural materials like clotheslines, threads, human hair, animal skins, [[organza]] fabric structures, rust and tea staining, and [[Encaustic painting|encaustic]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://brendanscottcarroll.wordpress.com/2011/03/19/babs-reingold/ Brendan Carroll’s interview with Babs Reingold]&lt;/ref&gt; The dynamics of the environment, power, technology, and the manipulation and destruction of nature are recurring themes in her art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drawingcenter.org/viewingprogram/share_portfolio.cfm?pf=1013 Babs Reingold’s Drawing Center entry]&lt;/ref&gt; Her installation ''The Last Tree'' portrays the world's 193 countries with fabricated silk organza tree stumps stuffed with human hair in pails.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iseny.org/usr_helio1/index.php Babs Reingold: The Last Tree curated by Midori Yoshimoto, Ph.D at the ISE Cultural Center, NY]&lt;/ref&gt; This elaborate installation, curated by Midori Yoshimoto at the ISE Cultural Foundation in New York, illuminates [[Jared Diamond]]'s question ''What was the Easter Islander thinking when he chopped down the last tree?'' resulting in a culture that demolished the entire wealth of its natural resources. A second show of the traveling exhibit was at the [[Burchfield Penney Art Center]] in [[Buffalo, New York]] in 2016-2017. Recent museum showings were at the [[Museum of Fine Arts (St. Petersburg, Florida)]] in 2015-2016.

==Personal life==
After spending her childhood in Caracas, and youth in [[Dallas, Texas]], Reingold endured grinding poverty as an adolescent in Woodhill, a public housing complex in [[Cleveland, Ohio]] with her mother and four siblings after her photographer father became ill with [[multiple sclerosis]] and her mother was unable to cope,.&lt;ref&gt;[http://brendanscottcarroll.wordpress.com/2011/03/19/babs-reingold/ Brendan Carroll’s interview with Babs Reingold]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cltampa.com/tampa/babs-reingolds-unsettling-vision-of-lives-traumatized-by-poverty/Content?oid=2035505#.UUS5eaWj4Rw Babs Reingold's unsettling vision of lives traumatized by poverty by Megan Voeller]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://local-artists.org/user/4883/cv Babs Reingold and the illusion of reality]&lt;/ref&gt; Reingold later escaped the cycle of poverty to become a successful artist. She graduated with a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] (BFA) degree from the [[Cleveland Institute of Art]], and obtained a [[Master of Fine Arts]] (MFA) degree from the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York]].

==Museum collections==
Reingold's works of art can be found in numerous public and private collections around the world, and are included in the permanent collections of the [[Newark Museum of Art]] in [[Newark, New Jersey]]; the [[Museum of Fine Arts (St. Petersburg, Florida)]] in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]]; and the [[Savannah College of Art and Design]] in [[Savannah, Georgia]], among others.

''''' The Shortening Winter's Day Is Near a Close (sometimes known as Beneath the Snow Encumbered Branches)''''' is a 1901 oil on canvas work by Scottish painter [[Joseph Farquharson]]. Its whereabouts were unknown between it going on public display in 1901 and the 1960s, when it was bought by a private collector. It reappeared on public display again in 2008, when it was sold at auction, selling for over twice its initial estimate to private hands in Scotland. It is currently held at Lady Lever Art Gallery, Liverpool, England (Accession Number LL3152)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/ladylever/collections/paintings/gallery4/shortening.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; with the title: The Shortening Winter's Day Is Near a Close.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/picture-of-month/displayPicture.aspx?id=84&lt;/ref&gt; It has become well known, as its likeness is used on a popular [[Hallmark Cards|Hallmark]] [[Christmas card]].

==Background==
Painter and [[Laird]] [[Joseph Farquharson]] owned a {{convert|20000|acre|ha|adj=on|lk=out}} estate at Finzean, Royal Deeside, [[Aberdeenshire]], where he enjoyed painting wintery scenes, particularly of sheep. This in turn had led to his nickname of "Frozen Mutton Farquharson".&lt;ref name=pressandjour/&gt;&lt;ref name=dailymailpaintingfound&gt;{{cite news|first=Andy|last=Dolan|title= Painting that inspired iconic Christmas card is found hanging in pensioner's home... and it's now worth £70,000|url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1090240/Painting-inspired-iconic-Christmas-card-hanging-pensioners-home--worth-70-000.html |accessdate=9 December 2011|newspaper=The Daily Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had a painting hut built on wheels, which contained a stove to keep him from getting too cold whilst he was out painting.&lt;ref name=dailymailpaintingfound/&gt;

Speaking in 2008 before the painting went on sale at auction, Nick Carnow, director at auctioneers Lyon and Turnbull of Edinburgh, said, "Farquharson had a long career but paintings by him of this quality are rare."&lt;ref name=dailymailpaintingfound/&gt;

==History==
The painting went on display in 1901 at the [[Royal Academy]]. Between then and the 1960s, nothing is known of its location except that it eventually came into the hands of art dealer Richard Green of [[Bond Street]], where it was sold to a private Scottish collector for £1,450.&lt;ref name=dailymailpaintingfound/&gt;&lt;ref name=haynes&gt;{{cite web|title=Haynes Fine Art Pipped To The Post By Strong Private Collector |url=http://www.haynesfineart.com/docs/newsletters/December2008Newsletter.pdf|accessdate=9 December 2011|publisher=Haynes Fine Art|date=December 2008|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Card company [[WN Sharpe]] purchased the rights to use the painting in greetings cards in the 1970s. The company later was acquired by the [[Hallmark Cards]] company, which continues to own these rights. In 2008, Hallmark's Jo Marchbank said, "This painting is one of our most popular Christmas cards. It is probably something to do with the unique atmosphere Farquharson creates, the dramatic yet subtle depiction of a winter landscape."&lt;ref name=dailymailpaintingfound/&gt; Over the course of its use as a design on Christmas cards, it is thought to have been reproduced hundreds of thousands of times.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt;

The painting was resold at auction in 2008, having hung in its owner's sitting room since she originally purchased it in the 1960s. She had decided to sell it because she was moving into smaller living quarters and did not feel that there would be enough room to adequately display the piece.&lt;ref name=haynes/&gt; Sold at Lyon and Turnbull auctioneers in Edinburgh, it was estimated that it would sell for between £50,000 to £70,000,&lt;ref name=pressandjour&gt;{{cite news|first=Gillian|last=Bell|title= Inspirational Painting For Xmas Cards May Fetch Up To £70,000|url=http://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/Article.aspx/962413|accessdate=9 December 2011|newspaper=Press and Journal|date=29 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but sold for more than twice that estimate to another private collector in Scotland for £147,600.&lt;ref name=haynes/&gt;

In December 2009, [[Gyles Brandreth]] presented a piece on the history of the painting for [[BBC One]]’s ''[[The One Show]]''.&lt;ref name=bbconeshow&gt;{{cite web|title=What Did You Think of The One Show?|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theoneshow/2009/12/what-did-you-think-of-the-one-23.shtml|accessdate=9 December 2011|publisher=BBC.co.uk|date=15 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aesthetics==
The painting, like Farquharson’s other landscapes, was painted on his estate at Finzean, Royal Deeside. One of his descendants, Angus Farquharson, later said that he thought he had found the exact spot at Finzean where the painting was created.&lt;ref name=pressandjour/&gt; The painting itself is an oil on canvas work,&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news|first=Richard|last=Savill|title=Christmas card painting to sell for £70,000|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/topics/christmas/3533562/Christmas-card-painting-to-sell-for-70000.html|accessdate=9 December 2011|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=28 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; measuring {{convert|20|in|cm}} high and {{convert|31|in|cm}} wide.&lt;ref name=dailymailpaintingfound/&gt;

The shepherd in the painting was actually an employee of Farquharson whom he had asked to pose for the image. Whilst he was painting he noticed that the model was beginning to turn blue and so offered the man the chance to come inside his painting hut to warm up; the man declined so that Farquharson could finish the painting more quickly.&lt;ref name=dailymailpaintingfound/&gt;

Used extensively in [[bookbinding]], a '''board shear''' is a large, hand-operated machine for cutting board or paper.  Like [[scissors]], a board shear uses two blades to apply [[shear stress]] exceeding the paper's [[shear strength]] in order to cut.  The stationary blade forms the edge of the cutting table, with the moving blade mounted on a cutting arm.  Originally known as a table gauge shear because its gauge allowed the cutting of consistently-sized materials, the board shear resembles a larger version of the paper cutters commonly found in offices.

The earliest known reference to a board shear comes from an 1842 supplement to ''[[Penny Magazine]]'', titled ''A Day at a Bookbinder's'', which included a drawing of a board shear with many of the major developments already present.  An 1854 article on the history of bookbinding from ''The Bookbinder's Trade Circular'' describes early board shears, and places their development in "about 1836"; credit for the invention is ascribed to Warren De La Rue in the ''Reports of the Juries'' from the [[Great Exhibition|Great Exhibition of 1851]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Middleton |first=Bernard |title=A History of English Craft Bookbinding Technique |publisher=Oak Knoll Press &amp; [[British Library|The British Library]] |year=1996 |pages=232–234 |isbn=1-884718-28-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many modifications of the basic design were made in the 19th century, with changes such as rack-and-pinion adjustment for the outer gauge&lt;ref&gt;Brombacher, C. U.S. Patent 43634, 1864.&lt;/ref&gt; and improved clamp bars.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, J.T. U.S. Patent 225871, 1880.&lt;/ref&gt;  By the late 19th century, board shears were substantively the same as modern machines, and many 19th-century board shears are still in use today.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1570">In classical [[tragedies]], the '''catastasis''' (pl. ''catastases'') is the third part of an ancient [[drama]], in which the intrigue or action that was initiated in the [[epitasis]], is supported and heightened, until ready to be unravelled in the [[Catastrophe (drama)|catastrophe]]. It also refers to the [[Climax (narrative)|climax]] of a drama.&lt;ref&gt;{{1728}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[rhetoric]], the '''catastasis''' is that part of a speech, usually the [[Exordium (rhetoric)|exordium]], in which the orator sets forth the subject matter to be discussed.&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary'' (1913)&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is not a classical one; it was invented by [[Julius Caesar Scaliger|Scaliger]] in his ''Poetics'' (published posthumously in 1561).&lt;ref&gt;John Lewis Walker, ''Shakespeare and the Classical Tradition: An Annotated Bibliography, 1961-1991'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 2002: {{ISBN|0-8240-6697-9}}), p. 639; Scaliger wrote: "catastasis est vigor ac status fabulae, in qua res miscetur in ea fortunae tempestate, in quam subducta est."&lt;/ref&gt; It "is more or less equivalent to the ''summa epitasis'' of Donatus and Latomus and to what Willichius sometimes called the ''extrema epitasis'',"&lt;ref&gt;Marvin T. Herrick, ''Comic Theory in the Sixteenth Century'' (University of Illinois Press, 1950), p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; and was first used in 1616 in England.&lt;ref&gt;Frank N. Magill, ''Critical Survey of Literary Theory: Authors, A-Sw'' (Salem Press, 1987: {{ISBN|0-89356-393-5}}), p. 1284.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the first wave of colonies, the people of Earth continue to struggle for existence. New factions have arisen and have launched a new wave of colonies off planet.&lt;ref name="Main Page"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civilization.com/en/games/civilization-beyond-earth-rising-tide/|website=Civilization Beyond Earth- Rising Tide|publisher=Firaxis Games|accessdate=21 October 2015|title=Firaxis Games}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
''Rising Tide'' brings new features including expanded water gameplay (which includes floating cities), hybrid affinities, a completely revamped [[diplomacy]] system, and an expanded exploration system.

The expansion adds several new dimensions to aquatic gameplay. Unlike land based cities, or even ocean cities in previous iterations of the game, aquatic based cities can move. Movement, rather than culture, is the way aquatic cities expand their borders.&lt;ref name="The Verge"&gt;{{cite news|last1=McCormick|first1=Rich|title=Alien Oceans are Familiar Territory For Civilization: Beyond Earth's First Expansion|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/16/9549127/civilization-beyond-earth-rising-tide-review|accessdate=21 October 2015|publisher=The Verge|date=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aquatic cities produce less unhealth, produce more energy and culture, and can create naval units much faster than land based cities. However, they are much harder to defend, and are less efficient at producing land and air units as land based cities would. On top of these differences several wonders and buildings are exclusive to either land or aquatic cities. Workers in ''RT'' can build farms on aquatic tiles, and they have an expanded number of aquatic tile types they can improve. When viewing at ocean tiles, water is transparent rather than blue allowing players to see the ocean floor.  This graphical enhancement allows for players to see resources under the ocean.

Hybrid affinities add another twist to the Beyond Earth experience.&lt;ref name="GameAgent"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Looney|first1=Russ|title=Rising Tide’s Hybrid Units Look Awesome|url=http://blog.gameagent.com/rising-tides-hybrid-units-look-awesome/|website=The GameAgent Blog|accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the original game, players are encouraged to earn points toward one of the affinities supremacy, harmony, or purity. The game favored choosing one affinity to level up while ignoring the other two.  In ''Rising Tide'', players are encouraged to level up all their affinities at the same time. Several new units of the game can only be built if the player has points from multiple affinities.

While the base ''Beyond Earth'' game used a diplomatic system derived straight from ''Civilization V'', diplomacy in ''Rising Tide'' is described as "completely rebuilt from scratch". Players can earn a new type of currency, diplomatic capital. Factions can earn this capital with certain buildings and wonders, and they can earn it trading with other factions.  Each faction can use this capital to buy personality trait bonuses. Diplomatic capital can also be used to build new units and buildings but it can not be used to buy new tiles. The AI has a respect and fear factor. Players who the AI deems high in respect or fear may enter more beneficial relationships. Players with low fear or respect ratings are more likely to go to war. When entering a war, players now earn a war score. When entering peace negotiations, the higher the war score a player earns, the more concessions a player may get from the losing faction.&lt;ref name="RPS2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Meer|first1=Alec|title=iv BE Rising Tide Patch Makes Peace Less Ridiculous|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/10/30/beyond-earth-rising-tide-diplomacy-fix/|accessdate=12 July 2016|publisher=Rock, Paper, Shotgun|date=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exploration has an expanded role in ''Rising Tide''. Players can find three types of artifacts: Old World Relics, Alien Biology Artifacts, and Progenitor Artifacts. When a player receives an artifact they may cash in these artifacts early for quick bonuses, or they can combine different artifacts to unlock different wonders, buildings or unit bonuses. Players may also discover Planetary Marvels. When a Marvel is discovered a planetwide quest is unlocked, which when completed provides many bonuses. Each biome has a different marvel.&lt;ref name="RPS1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Meer|first1=Alec|title=Wot I Think – Civilization: Beyond Earth – Rising Tide|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/10/08/beyond-earth-rising-tide-review/|website=Rock, Paper, Shotgun|accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On top of these changes to exploration, explorers can perform expeditions on water tiles. Players can now leash Aliens using explorers allowing players to capture armies of aliens to fight for them.

''Rising Tide'' adds two new biomes: frigid, an ice world, and primordial, a geologically active world.&lt;ref name="The Verge" /&gt; Aliens have different color patterns in each biome and will behave differently depending on what biome they are in. For example, aliens in a frigid biome tend to be fewer in number but stronger while those in a lush biome would be larger in number yet weaker.

Four new sponsors have also been added: Chungsu, Al Falah, the North Sea Alliance, and INTEGR.&lt;ref name="The Verge" /&gt; Chungsu comes from the [[Korean Peninsula]]. This faction excels at [[espionage]] and can build its founding city on water tiles. Al Falah comes from [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]]. Unlike the rest of the colonists, Al Falah colonists lived in [[Generation ship|generational ships]] rather than being [[Cryogenics|cryogenically]] frozen on [[sleeper ship]]s. The colonists from this faction have never seen Earth, and its culture has evolved as such. This faction gets bonuses in City development. The North Sea Alliance comes from the [[British Isles]] and the [[Nordic countries|Nordic region]]. This faction gets bonuses in water tiles, and can build its founding city on water tiles. INTEGR comes from [[Germany]]. It gains bonuses in the new diplomacy system. The ''Beyond Earth'' spinoff game, ''[[Sid Meier's Starships]]'' does not include the new sponsors introduced in ''Rising Tide''.

==Development==
The development of ''Rising Tide'' was announced on May 18, 2015.&lt;ref name="PCG Announcement"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Savage|first1=Phil|title=Civilization: Beyond Earth – Rising Tide expansion announced|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/civilization-beyond-earth-rising-tide-expansion-announced/|accessdate=12 July 2016|publisher=PC Gamer|date=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was released on October 9, 2015.  Several new features have been added post launch.  A spoils of war system has been added to allow victors in war to pick what they want from the defeated foes.  A black market has been added to allow players to buy or sell resources for diplomatic capital.  The AI is much more aggressive toward players close to the completion of wonders or to victory.&lt;ref name="RTNovpatch"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Wonder War and Chungsu’s New Colors: Changes to Beyond Earth: Rising Tide|url=http://franchise.civilization.com/en/news/2015-11-the-wonder-war-and-chungsus-new-colors-upcoming-changes-to-beyond-earth-rising-tide/|website=franchise.civilization.com|publisher=Firaxis|accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dead Prez''', stylized as '''dead prez''', is a [[hip hop music|hip hop]] duo from the United States, composed of [[stic.man]] and [[M-1 (rapper)|M-1]], formed in 1996 in [[New York City]]. They are known for their confrontational style, combined with [[Socialism|socialist]] lyrics focused on both militant [[social justice]], [[Marxism]], and [[Pan-Africanism]]. The duo maintains an ethical stance against [[Corporatism|corporate control]] over [[Mass media|the media]], especially hip hop [[record label]]s.

==Career==
===Background (1990-2000)===
In 1990, M-1 headed to [[Tallahassee]] to attend FAMU ([[Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University]]) where he and stic.man met and formed a relationship due to their mutual love of music and similar [[leftist]] political ideology. There, their views solidified, M-1 becoming particularly interested in the [[Black Panther Party]].

M-1 joined the [[Uhuru Movement|International People's Democratic Uhuru Movement]] in [[Chicago]] for three years, while stic.man remained in Florida. Burned out by the arduous labor of Uhuru, M-1 and stic.man chose to focus on music. [[Brand Nubian]]'s [[Lord Jamar]] discovered them in [[New York City]] and signed them a deal with [[Loud Records]]. Although dead prez was not always Loud's top priority, they built a fan base due to their over-the-top performances (they've been known to ignite [[United States one-dollar bill|dollar bill]]s and toss apples into the audiences, declaring that they must eat healthily).

They had begun contributing songs to film soundtracks and made featurings on high-profile albums. Their first recorded song, "The Game of Life (Score)" appeared on the 1997 soundtrack to the film ''[[Soul in the Hole]]''.  In 1998 their song "D.O.P.E. (Drugs Oppress People Everyday)" was featured in the movie ''[[Slam (film)|Slam]]''.  Also in 1998, they were featured on the skit "The Rain and the Sun" off [[Big Pun]]'s album ''[[Capital Punishment (album)|Capital Punishment]]'', and in 1999 were featured on [[The Beatnuts]]' song "Look Around" off their album ''[[Musical Massacre]]''.

===Releases (2000-Present)===
[[Image:Iching-hexagram-07.svg|right|thumb|200px|Dead prez uses the [[I Ching hexagrams#Hexagram 7|''shi'' hexagram]], "Leading" or "The Army", as part of their logo.]]
The duo's debut album was 2000's ''[[Let's Get Free]]'', with their most popular single to date "Hip Hop". The album was well received by critics, and included intense political monologues featuring prominent black activist [[Omali Yeshitela]], as well as "Animal in Man" - a retelling of [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Animal Farm]]''. The instrumental version of their song "Hip Hop" was used as [[Dave Chappelle]]'s entrance music for his show on Comedy Central, and can be heard on every episode. "Hip Hop" has also been featured on the soundtrack of the popular video game SKATE as well as underground [[graffiti art]] documentaries of the era. In 2001 they collaborated with [[The Coup]], another politically active hip hop outfit, to release ''Get Up''.

In 2002, dead prez contributed to ''[[Red Hot + Riot]]'', a compilation album created by the [[Red Hot Organization]] in tribute to the music and work of Nigerian musician [[Fela Kuti]]. The money raised by the CD was used for various charities devoted to raising AIDS awareness and fighting the disease. They collaborated with fellow hip-hop artists [[Talib Kweli]] and [[Bilal (American singer)|Bilal]] and Brazilian singer [[Jorge Ben]] to remake the famous Fela Kuti song "Shuffering and Shmiling" for the album. Also in 2002, dead prez released the independent [[mix tape]] ''[[Turn off the Radio: The Mixtape Vol. 1]]'', followed by the release of ''Turn off the Radio: The Mixtape Vol. 2: Get Free or Die Tryin''' in 2003. Also in 2003, their song "Hell Yeah" was featured in the [[2 Fast 2 Furious]] soundtrack. In 2004, [[Columbia Records]] finally released ''[[Revolutionary But Gangsta]]''. They were featured in the film ''[[Dave Chappelle's Block Party]]'', in 2006.

In 2006, they and former [[2Pac]] collaborators, the [[Outlawz]], jointly released two new albums: ''[[Can't Sell Dope Forever]]'' and ''[[Soldier 2 Soldier]]''. In 2006, M1 also recorded a solo album titled ''[[Confidential (M-1 album)|Confidential]]''. From the album, the song "'Til We Get There" was on the [[EA Sports]] video game ''[[NBA Live 07]]''. In 2007, stic.man released his own solo record named ''[[Manhood (album)|Manhood]]'' with Boss Up Inc. / Traffic records. M-1 further appeared with ProfessorD.us, of the politically charged Hip Hop group [[The Dope Poet Society]], on the track "Everything's Political" off the 2008 album ''THIRD WORLD WARriors Vol. 1''. On the track, M-1 and ProfessorD.us trade verses in response to the question "why is your music always so political?". That same year, Stic.Man appeared on "Changing Weather", the first single from Marcel Cartier's album ''Revolutionary Minded 2''.

Dead prez released a mixtape entitled ''Pulse of the People: Turn Off Your Radio Vol. 3'' on June 23, 2009. The mixtape is hosted by [[DJ Green Lantern]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deadprez.com/ |title=DeadPrez.com |publisher=DeadPrez.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090723070535/http://www.deadprez.com/ |archivedate=2009-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Mother's Day]] 2010, dead prez released "The Beauty Within", a remix of [[B.o.B]] and [[Bruno Mars]]' #1 single "[[Nothin' On You]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thatsthatish.com/2010/05/dead-prez-beauty-within.html thatsthatish.com: dead prez - "The Beauty Within"]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally in 2010, dead prez released a mixtape with [[DJ Drama]] entitled ''[[Turn Off the Radio Vol. 4: Revolutionary but Gangsta Grillz]]''. The album is available for free download on their website, and they announced this release was their ten year commemoration of their most well known and commercially successful album ''[[Let's Get Free]]''. The new album [[Information Age (album)|''Information Age'']] was released on October 16, 2012.

==Documentary (2006)==
[[File:Dead Prez performing in 2009 (2).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Dead prez performing on December 13, 2009.]]
In June 2006, the cable movie network [[Starz InBlack]] began airing an original [[Documentary film|documentary]] called ''Dead Prez: It's Bigger Than Hip Hop'' directed by [[John Threat]]. The hour-long documentary featured live footage and interviews with dead prez, along with interviews from Kamel Bell, owner of Ankh Marketing and son of incarcerated [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] member [[Herman Bell]]; [[Fred Hampton Jr.]], son of Black Panther Deputy Chairman of the Illinois Chapter [[Fred Hampton]]; Bay Area rapper and poet Ise Lyfe, and hip hop activist and radio personality [[Davey D]]. Among the topics discussed in the documentary are the inadequacies of the public education system, people of color entrepreneurship and social revolution.

== Annual conference ==
In 2017, the Folk Art Society of America celebrates its 30th conference. The conferences are open to all who register. They include a symposium, a benefit art auction, studio tours, home tours, and museum visits. Local museums usually plan an exhibition to coincide with the occurrence of the Society's conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=One Hundred Miles: The 100th Anniversary of Miles Carpenter|date=1989|publisher=The MIles B.

A scholarship to attend the conference is given to a graduate student of folk art. In honor of one of the pioneers of folk art collecting, Herbert Hemphill Jr., a work of folk art is gifted to a museum or university, typically in the area the conference is being held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosenak|first1=Chuck|title=Point of View: American Folk Art from the William and Ann Oppenhimer Collection|date=2001|publisher=Marsh Art Gallery University of Richmond Museums|location=Richmond|isbn=0-9713753-1-3|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an annual auction that occurs at the conference to which members and folk artists submit artwork.

== ''Folk Art Messenger'' ==
The ''Folk Art Messenger'' is a journal that includes a variety of articles from writers on topics important to the folk art and self-taught art world including articles about folk artists, auctions, exhibitions, fairs, collectors and book reviews, as well as artists' obituaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Claire|first1=Jean-Claude|title=Calendar of Events|journal=Bulletin De L’Association Les Amis De Francois Ozenda|date=October 1993|volume=50|pages=97–98|language=French|issn=1164-3331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine is known for its inclusive approach, focusing on the artists' struggles and successes, rather than hotly debated issues like what to call this type of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maizels|first1=John|title=Raw Creation Outsider Art and Beyond|date=1996|publisher=Phaidon Press Limited|location=London|isbn=0-7148-3149-2|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, the first ''Messenger'' was a black-and-white, 6-page fold out, but began to be published in color in 1997 with the 38th issue. Currently, the 40-page magazine carries no advertising and is the only American publication of its type published three time a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sellen|first1=Betty-Carol|title=Self Taught, Outsider, and Folk Art A Guide to American Artists, Locations and Resources|date=2016|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc.

While the Folk Art Messenger focuses mainly on American artists, the two have much in common and previously referenced each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Folk Art Messenger|url=https://rawvision.com/search/rawvision/messenger|publisher=Raw Vision|access-date=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Folk art environments ==
A folk art environment is a large-scale work of art created by a folk or self-taught artist. These works are identified and recorded by [[Saving and Preserving Arts and Cultural Environments]], a non profit arts organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is an Art Environment?|url=http://www.spacesarchives.org/about/what-is-an-art-environment/|publisher=SPACES|access-date=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Folk Art Society has awarded 12 plaques of recognition to various folk art environments. The plaque from FASA identifies the site as worthy of preservation and protection. Recipients of this plaque include the [[Watts Towers]], [[Howard Finster]]'s Paradise Garden, the [[Miles B. Carpenter House|Miles B. Carpenter Museum]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Miles B. Carpenter Museum|url=http://milesbcarpentermuseum.com/History_Of_The_Miles_B_Carpenter_Museum.shtml|publisher=Miles B. Carpenter Folk Art Museum|access-date=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Grandma Prisbrey's Bottle Village]].

Bottle Village, located in [[Simi Valley, California|Simi Valley, Calif.]] was created by folk artist Tressa Prisbrey beginning in 1956. Following her death in 1988, the future of the village was uncertain. Many residents of the area found the site to be garish and wanted it demolished, however recognition from the Folk Art Society of America as well as the state's historic landmark program prevented its  destruction after it was damaged in the Simi Valley earthquake in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Catania|first1=Sara|title=Weathered Work of Folk Art May Face Demolition : Simi Valley: Whimsical collection of structures may be leveled unless shored up.

== Location ==
The Folk Art Society was founded in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond, Va]] and held its first conference in the city as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Halle Saint Pierre|author2=Martine Lusardy|author3=John Maizels|title=Raw Vision 25 Ans d’Art Brut|date=2013|pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the organization strives to span the nation and now holds conferences throughout the US, the headquarters remain in Richmond since the founding except for a brief interlude. In 2014, the Society became a part of Longwood University, renamed the Folk Art Society of America at Longwood Center for the Visual Arts or FASA@LCVA. The FASA office and archives were moved to [[Farmville, Virginia|Farmville, Va]] for two years as a part of this transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lohmann|first1=Bill|title=Folk Art Society Transferring to Longwood University|url=http://www.richmond.com/entertainment/folk-art-society-transferring-to-longwood-university/article_23931272-6e49-58d9-869c-c28fa0fcfd6d.html|access-date=11 March 2017|publisher=Richmond Times Dispatch|date=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However this relationship was later discontinued and the Society returned to Richmond in March 2016. Currently the Society is in the process of turning its archives over to the Virginia Historical Society in Richmond, Va., and will be working with Lee Shepard, the Vice President for Collections, in order to create a permanent archive that will be digitized and available for scholarly research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meet the Staff: E.

'''Francis Holman''' (1729–1784) was a British [[marine art|maritime painter]], little recognised during his own lifetime, but whose paintings are now sought after.  He is also notable as the teacher of [[Thomas Luny]].

==Life==
He was born in [[Ramsgate]] and [[baptism|baptized]] on 14 November 1729 at [[St Laurence-in-Thanet]], [[Ramsgate]].&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;  He was the eldest son and second of six children of Francis Holman (1696–1739), and his wife, Anne Long (1707–1757).&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; His father was a [[master mariner]], and his grandfather a Ramsgate [[Cooper (profession)|cooper]].  His younger brother, [[Captain (nautical)|Captain]] John Holman (1733–1816), maintained the family shipping business and remained close to Francis throughout his life.  Young Francis would certainly have been immersed in the maritime world during his up-bringing; the legacy of this early knowledge is a wealth of detail and accuracy in his later work.

[[File:A small shipyard on the Thames - Francis Holman.jpg|thumb|right|''A small shipyard on the Thames'', by Francis Holman, between 1760 and 1784]]
Francis Holman lived in at least five addresses in [[Wapping]] on the [[Thames]] in [[London]].  He married, firstly,  Elizabeth, and they produced 3 sons; John (b. 1757), and two more sons, both named Francis, who died in infancy. Elizabeth's death is unrecorded, but on 7 May 1781 he married, secondly, Jane Maxted (c.1736–1790).  He was apparently childless when he wrote his will in 1783.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

==Work==

Holman's earliest works are portraits of ships, commonly commissioned for ships' [[captain (nautical)|captain]]s. From 1767 to 1772 he exhibited eleven pictures at the Free Society of Artists,&lt;ref name=NMM/&gt; and he began to produce pictures of shipyards and the general life of maritime Britain in the late eighteenth century.  By 1773 Holman had taken on [[Thomas Luny]] as an apprentice;&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Luny later became a major [[marine art|maritime painter]] in his own right.

With the [[American War of Independence]] and the strong contemporary public interest in the [[Royal Navy]], it was natural that Holman should turn his talents towards more patriotic themes. Between 1774 and 1784 he sent seventeen pictures, mostly of the [[Royal Navy]] or sea battles, for exhibition at the [[Royal Academy]].&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; His most notable painting of the [[American War of Independence]] is ''The Moonlight Battle off Cape St Vincent, 16 January 1780'' (shown right).

==Fate==

Holman died in [[Wapping]] on 29 November 1784. Captain John Holman brought his body back to Ramsgate for burial on 4 December in Jane's family vault at St Laurence, where the vicar recorded his death as due to "lethargy".&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

==Artistic achievement==

According to [[Lionel Cust]] in the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'', Holman's work "met with unmerited neglect".&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;''The [[Dictionary of National Biography]]'', [[Oxford University Press]], 2004–2008&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently, his paintings have achieved good prices at auction and form significant collections at museums, not least the [[National Maritime Museum]].  His attention to detail and in-depth knowledge of his subject have left us with a valuable record of eighteenth century maritime life, and consequently his reputation as a major marine painter has grown.  His importance as the teacher of Thomas Luny has also enhanced his reputation.&lt;ref name=NMM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/mag/pages/mnuInDepth/Biography.cfm?biog=193|title=Francis Holman biography |publisher= [[National Maritime Museum]]|accessdate=2008-09-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070804204241/http://www.nmm.ac.uk/mag/pages/mnuInDepth/Biography.cfm?biog=193 |archivedate=2007-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''FriendsWithYou''' (FWY) is an art collaborative based in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]],&lt;ref name="Inside FriendsWithYou's Incredible Los Angeles Studio"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.complexmag.ca/art-design/2013/04/inside-friendswithyous-incredible-los-angeles-studio|publisher= Complex Magazine|title= Inside FriendsWithYou's Incredible Los Angeles Studio |accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded in Miami, [[Florida]], by Samuel Albert Borkson (b.1979, Plantation, Florida)&lt;ref name="Biography"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://friendswithyou.com/info/biography/|publisher= FriendsWithYou|title= Biography|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Arturo Sandoval III (b. 1976, Havana, Cuba) &lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt; in 2002, which seeks to redesign [[spirituality]], rituals, and religious acts for modern day usage and connectivity.&lt;ref name="FRIENDSWITHYOU"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://theholenyc.com/2011/06/10/friendwithyou|publisher= The Hole|title= FRIENDSWITHYOU |accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; FriendsWithYou’s mission coincides with their motto "Magic, Luck, and Friendship."&lt;ref name="FriendsWithYou's 'Inner Space': Art After Basel"&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/15/friendswithyou-inner-space_n_1151062.html|publisher= The Huffington Post|title= FriendsWithYou's 'Inner Space': Art After Basel|accessdate=July 12, 2013|first=Amanda|last=McCorquodale|date=December 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collaborative began by creating soft sculptures as a means to spread more accessible art like plush and wood toys,&lt;ref name="Friends With YOU in NYC"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://textileartscenterblog.com/friends-with-you-in-nyc/|publisher= Textile Arts Center|title= Friends With YOU in NYC|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as immersive art installations, fine art works including sculpture and painting, and are best known for their public art spectacles such as large-scale art installations, playgrounds, and performance pieces.&lt;ref name="Friends With You opens its Design District Studio for Art Basel Exhibition called “Inner Space, the Secrets of the Unknown"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://the305.com/2011/11/25/friends-with-you-opens-its-design-district-studio-for-art-basel-exhibition-called-inner-space-the-secrets-of-the-unknown/#ixzz2TzX4Br6B|publisher= The305.com|title= Friends With You opens its Design District Studio for Art Basel Exhibition called "Inner Space, the Secrets of the Unknown |accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have described the creation of their art as a healing process intended to increase relatability and connection to each other and the world around them.&lt;ref name="Interview: FriendsWithYou Discusses Their Artists Talk with MOCAtv and the Art of Positivity"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.complex.com/art-design/2013/02/interview-friendswithyou-discusses-their-artists-talk-with-mocatv-and-the-art-of-positivity|publisher= Complex Magazine|title= Interview: FriendsWithYou Discusses Their Artists Talk with MOCAtv and the Art of Positivity|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, they have become internationally recognized with public exhibits and artworks in Europe, Asia, Australia, and The Americas.

FriendsWithYou Fine Art has been exhibited and/or included in the permanent collections of [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|Museum of Contemporary Art]] (MOCA), the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] (IMA), [[Haus der Kulturen der Welt|Haus der Kulturen der Welt Museum Berlin]], and [[Galerie Perrotin|Galerie Emmanuel Perrotin]] among others.&lt;ref name="Magic, Luck and Friendship (TM)"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://sites.moca.org/thecurve/2013/02/15/magic-luck-and-friendship/ |publisher= Complex Magazine|title= Magic, Luck and Friendship (TM)|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In October 2006, the [[Germany|German]] art press Die Gestalten Verlag published a FriendsWithYou [[monograph]] titled ''Friends With You Have Powers!''

==Evaluation and influence==
FriendsWithYou have explained that their art is meant to "activate the social interaction of people as exploded and refracted by the Internet and elaborate new modes of interpersonal relationships."&lt;ref name="FRIENDSWITHYOU"/&gt;
 
They use play as an artistic means to foster these relationships.&lt;ref name="Artists: FriendsWithYou"&gt;{{Cite web | url= http://iloveoffset.com/stage/friendswithyou |publisher= iloveoffset.com |title= FriendsWithYou |accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many FriendsWithYou works look like toys because they are meant for play as a means of interactive unstructured free association. FWY hopes that "through their artwork, the buried, neglected urges and yearnings that a seasoned art viewer may not expect to have activated; playfulness, laughter and inquisitiveness are triggered, with an end result of feeling connected."&lt;ref name="Artists Statement"&gt;{{Cite web | url= http://friendswithyou.com/info|publisher= FriendsWithYou|title= Artists Statement|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conceptually, FriendsWithYou’s experiential artwork is in conversation with [[Relational Aesthetics]] and the work of Jeff Koons, [[Takashi Murakami]], and [[Damien Hirst]].

"FWY hopes to evoke a spiritual connectivity that will enlighten all visitors.

''':)''' at the Hole from June 10 to August 6, 2011 &lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt; was FriendsWithYou’s first solo exhibition in New York and the inaugural show at the Hole’s new location. The show featured 22 FriendsWithYou artworks including a series of anthropomorphic figures created largely out of geometric abstractions made from Lasercut MDF, car paint and acrylic.  The show was described as "relentlessly cheerful," and “an interactive, experiential wonderland of pop-straction and participation.”
Much like Murakami, [[Arturo Herrera]], [[Yayoi Kusama]], and others FWY take a spiritual and serene approach to form and figure in the :) exhibition. The artists consider these works to be part of the “service art” movement, allowing for the viewer to easily understand their message and not be categorized as “pretentious art”. FWY feels art is for everyone and can aid in connecting humankind.&lt;ref name="Building a Rainbow City"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://friendswithyou.com/portfolio/inner-space-the-secrets-of-the-unknown| publisher= Artlog|title= Building a Rainbow City|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rainbow City''' was an interactive installation containing minimalist inflatable forms from 8' to 50' borrowing their aesthetics from toy-like geometries and designs.&lt;ref name="AOL Artists: Rainbow City"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.aolartists.com/initiatives/rainbow-city|publisher= AOL Artists|title= Rainbow City|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally commissioned in 2010 by the Luminato Arts Foundation in Toronto, Canada, Rainbow City was then exhibited at Art Basel Miami 2010 presented by Paper Magazine, Pharrell Williams, and Aol. About 20,000 people visited the installation and were able to participate by bouncing about inside the inflatable structures and wandering in and around the surreal landscape.&lt;ref name="FriendsWithYou Converts Art Basel 2010 Into A Rainbow City"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/friendswithyou-converts-art-basel-2010-into-a-rainbow-city |publisher= The Creators Project|title= FriendsWithYou Converts Art Basel 2010 Into A Rainbow City |accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 6, 2010 to open section 2 of the High Line in New York City, a collection of 40 air-filled sculptures filled 16,000 square feet of outdoor space in Chelsea.&lt;ref name="FriendsWithYou's Rainbow City at the High Line Park"/&gt; It was FWY's first large scale interactive installation in New York City.&lt;ref name="RAINBOW CITY: AOL &amp; FRIENDSWITHYOU'S URBAN PLAYGROUND"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.psfk.com/2011/05/rainbow-city-aol-friendswithyous-urban-playground.html|publisher= psfk|title= RAINBOW CITY: AOL &amp; FRIENDSWITHYOU'S URBAN PLAYGROUND|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ART COLLECTIVE FRIENDSWITHYOU BRING COLOR AND JOY TO NEW YORK"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://culturereport.wordpress.com/2011/06/21/art-collective-friendswithyou-bring-color-and-joy-to-new-york|publisher= The Culture Report|title= ART COLLECTIVE FRIENDSWITHYOU BRING COLOR AND JOY TO NEW YORK|accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the artists, Rainbow City was created to allow the viewer to reinterpret spirituality.  The large totems represented self-reflective portraits, in line with FWY’s goal of evoking visitors to see their emotions and own self within the sculptural pieces. Visitors were encouraged to come and “be in awe of these large, reduced shaped and simple totems,” stated Arturo Sandoval III. By evoking play through very simple form, FriendsWithYou feels an almost religious scenario of connectivity is created in this interactive installation.&lt;ref name="ART COLLECTIVE FRIENDSWITHYOU BRING COLOR AND JOY TO NEW YORK"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Friends with Safewalls"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.safewalls.org/news/friendswithsafewalls/|publisher= Safewalls|title= Friends with Safewalls |accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FriendsWithYou's Cloud City 3.jpg|thumb|right|'''Cloud City''']]'''Cloud City''' opened in 2005 at the MOCA warehouse during the annual Art Basel in Miami.

'''Cloudy''' is a video installation that launched exclusively on "'[[Pharrell Williams]]'"'s "'[[i am OTHER]]'" "'[[YouTube]]'" channel. "Cloudy" is a short by artists Samuel Borkson and Arturo Sandoval III. The animated piece is an exploration into the clouds; a sweet, visual soundscape that takes the viewer through a personal journey into the sky. It invites viewers to follow a cast of clouds and raindrops through an entrancing adventure. FriendsWithYou explores animism, giving the main cast of characters a soul. The purpose of the piece is to transcend the viewer to a peaceful and joyous state. Clouds singing and performing their duties in a joyful manner show us that everything in our world has a role and a purpose.&lt;ref name="CLOUDY"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kySziocrOmU |author1 =Samuel Borkson |author2 =Arturo Sandoval III |title= Friends With You - Cloudy |date =18 July 2012 |website =YouTube |accessdate =23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Funeral Procession''''' is the name of a painting by [[Ellis Wilson]], which went from obscurity to notoriety in 1986, when it was featured heavily in the episode "[[The Auction (The Cosby Show episode)|The Auction]]" of TV series ''[[The Cosby Show]]''. In the episode, Mrs. Huxtable wins the painting at an auction and pays $11,000 for it. She states that the painting was made by her "great-uncle Ellis". She said it hung in her grandmother's house and it was sold when her grandmother got sick and needed the extra money for medical bills. At the end of the episode, Dr. Huxtable hangs the painting over the family's living room mantle, where it would stay for the remainder of the eight-season series. 

In real life, the painting is displayed as part of the Aaron Douglas Collection at the [[Amistad Research Center]] at [[Tulane University]] in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]]. Ellis Wilson was born on April 20, 1899 in [[Mayfield, Kentucky]], and died on either January 1 or 2, 1977. The most Wilson ever got for one of his paintings was about $300.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ket.org/elliswilson/funeral.htm Funeral Procession] at ket.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ket.org/elliswilson/timeline.htm Ellis Wilson Timeline] at ket.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gẹlẹdẹ''' spectacle of the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] is a public display by colorful masks which combines art and ritual dance to amuse, educate and inspire worship.&lt;ref name=Lawal&gt;{{cite book|last=Lawal|first=Babatunde|title=The Gèlèdé spectacle : art, gender, and social harmony in an African culture|year=1996|publisher=University of Washington press|location=Seattle|isbn=978-0-295-97599-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gelede celebrates “Mothers” (''awon iya wa''), a group that includes female ancestors and deities as well as the elderly women of the community, and the power and spiritual capacity these women have in society. However, this power may also be destructive and take the form of witchcraft; therefore, Gelede serves the function of appeasing this power, as well.&lt;ref name=Siegmann&gt;{{cite book|last=Siegmann |first=William C. |title=African art a century at the Brooklyn Museum |year=2009 |publisher=Brooklyn Museum |location=Brooklyn, NY |isbn=978-3791343211 |author2=Adande, Joseph |author3=Dumouchelle, Kevin D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gelede in the context of Yoruba belief==
The Gelede social agenda rests on the Yoruba maxim ''Eso l'aye'' (The world is fragile). In other words, life is delicate and should be lived with caution and with an emphasis on diplomacy, consideration, respect and harmony.&lt;ref name=Lawal /&gt;

==The origins of Gelede==
Most Yoruba myths of origin can be found in the divination narratives knows at [[Odu Ifa]]. There are approximately 256 Odu Ifa, each of which contains a number of poems called [[ese Ifa]]. A typical ese Ifa is a narrative about a person or animal with a problem and the steps to resolve that problem. An ese Ifa explains the origins of Gelede as beginning with [[Yemoja]], "The Mother of all the orisa and all living things." Yemoja could not have children and consulted an Ifa oracle, who advised her to offer sacrifices and to dance with wooden images on her head and metal anklets on her feet. After performing this ritual, she became pregnant. Her first child was a boy, nicknamed "Efe" (the humorist); the Efe mask emphasizes song and jests because of the personality of its namesake. Yemoja's second child was a girl, nicknamed "Gelede" because she was obese like her mother. Also like her mother, Gelede loved dancing.

After getting married themselves, neither Gelede or Efe's partner could have children. The Ifa oracle suggested they try the same ritual that had worked for their mother. No sooner than Efe and Gelede performed these rituals- dancing with wooden images on their heads and metal anklets on their feet- they started having children. These rituals developed into the Gelede masked dance and was perpetuated by the descendants of Efe and Gelede.&lt;ref name=Lawal /&gt;

This narrative is one of many stories that explains the origin of Gelebe. An outdated theory states that the beginning of Gelede might be associated with the change from a [[matriarchal]] to a [[patriarchal]] society.&lt;ref name=Lawal /&gt;

==Gelede spectacle==
Although Gelede ceremony may be staged at any time of the year (to better the lot of an individual, to cleanse the society of pestilence, to induce rain, to enrich human fertility, to enlist the support of supernatural forces and the "powerful mothers" in wartime, and to honor the dead), the most elaborate performance occurs during the annual festival.

Once the exact dates of the festival are fixed, usually through divination, the Iyalase notifies the head of the community and the important chiefs. Messages then go out to all members of the Gelede society outside the town or working far away to return home for the celebration.

The festival begins with an all-night concert called efe, which features the Efe male mask, who uses satire to entertain and educate. Given the concern of the Gelede society with peace and social stability, it is not surprising that didactic themes recur in ''efe'' songs.

After the efe dance, most of the attendees spend the morning sleeping in preparation for the afternoon dance, which takes place in the marketplace and features pairs of male dancers who perform to fast-paced music with a vigorous beat.

The Gelede ceremony involves carefully choreographed dance, singing and music, and especially drumming. The performances are given by men, wearing masks that feature sculpted images of scenes including animals and people or sewing machines and drums. The pairs of men masquerade as women to amuse, please and placate the mothers who are considered very powerful, and who may use their powers for good or destructive purposes. These powers are especially linked to childbirth. The abilities they possess may be activated either consciously or unconsciously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Birmingham Museum of Art | title = Birmingham Museum of Art: A Guide to the Collection | publisher = Giles | year = 2010 | location = London | page = 71 | url = http://www.birminghammuseumstore.org/bmapu.html | accessdate = 2011-07-01 | isbn = 978-1-904832-77-5 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110910171150/http://www.birminghammuseumstore.org/bmapu.html | archivedate = 2011-09-10 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gelede costume and headdress==

Gelede masks are worn with a costume consisting of layers of elaborate, colorful cloth.

The Gelede "mask" is more accurately a headdress, since it rests on top of the head and the wearer's face is covered by a cloth veil. The headdress takes the form of a human head, on top of which are motifs that are intended to entertain onlookers but, in addition, usually address social concerns that may also be expressed in songs that are part of the masquerade. The headdresses are usually brightly painted.&lt;ref name=Siegmann /&gt;

Individuals or families will usually go to any length to make their headdresses as attractive and humorous as possible. The endless variety of the motifs and their combinations makes it difficult to attempt to construct a typology of Gelede headdresses.&lt;ref name=Lawal /&gt;

Most of the headdresses have facial adornments, ranging from lineage marks to decorative tattoos, which are either incised or painted.

[[Babatunde Lawal]] writes: "The headdress is to the costume what the [[Ase (Yoruba)#The head as the site of ase|head (ori)]] is to the human body. It is an index of identification and the essence of the masker's personality as long as he is inside the mask. In spite of the comical representations that often appear on the headdress, the face below the superstructure remains serene, as if stressing the paradox that is life-and the need to live life with special care."&lt;ref name=Lawal /&gt;

'''Ivor Armstrong Richards''' (26 February 1893 – 7 September 1979), known as '''I. A. Richards''', was an English educator, [[literary critic]], and [[rhetoric]]ian whose work contributed to the foundations of the [[New Criticism]], a [[Formalism (literature)|formalist]] movement in [[literary theory]], which emphasized the [[close reading]] of a literary text, especially [[poetry]], in an effort to discover how a work of literature functions as a self-contained, self-referential [[Aesthetics|æsthetic object]].

Richards' [[Intellectualism|intellectual]] contributions to the establishment of the literary methodology of the New Criticism are presented in the books ''[[The Meaning of Meaning|The Meaning of Meaning: A Study of the Influence of Language upon Thought and of the Science of Symbolism]]'' (1923), by [[C. K. Ogden]] and I. A. Richards, ''Principles of Literary Criticism'' (1926), ''Practical Criticism'' (1929), and ''The Philosophy of Rhetoric'' (1936).

==Biography==

Richards was educated at [[Clifton College]] and [[Magdalene College, Cambridge]], where his intellectual talents were developed by the scholar Charles Hicksonn 'Cabby' Spence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bizzell |first=Patricia |first2=Bruce |last2=Herzberg |title=The Rhetorical Tradition: Reading From Classical Times to the Present |edition=2nd |location=New York, NY |publisher=Bedford/St. Matin's |year=2001 |page=1270 |isbn=0312148399 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He began his career without formal training in literature; he studied philosophy (the "moral sciences") at [[Cambridge University]], from which derived his assertions that, in the 20th century, literary study cannot and should not be undertaken as a specialisation, it is in itself, but studied alongside a cognate field, such as [[philosophy]], [[psychology]] and [[rhetoric]].

His early teaching appointments were as adjunct faculty: at Cambridge University, [[Magdalene College, Cambridge|Magdalene College]] would not pay a salary for Richards to teach the new, and untested, [[academic field]] of English literature. Instead, like an old-style instructor, he collected weekly tuition directly from the students, as they entered the classroom. In his private life, Richards married [[Dorothy Pilley Richards]] in 1926; they had met on a [[Alpinism|mountain climbing]] holiday in Wales.

In the 1929–30 biennium, as a visiting professor, Richards taught [[Basic English]] and Poetry at [[Tsinghua University]], Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/biography/I-A-Richards Retrieved 6 April 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tai Huai-Ching,  ''On the Study of Words'' (1960).my World Publishing Co. p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1936–38, triennium, Richards was the director of the [[Orthological Institute of China]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/biography/I-A-Richards ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions==
===Collaborations with C. K. Ogden===
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Charles Kay Ogden.jpg|thumb|right|350px| The inventor of [[Basic English]], C.K. Ogden (1889–1957), was the most fruitful collaborator of I. A. Richards.]] --&gt;

The life and intellectual influence of I. A. Richards approximately corresponds to his [[intellectualism|intellectual]] interests; many endeavours were in collaboration with the [[linguist]], philosopher, and writer [[C. K. Ogden|Charles Kay Ogden]] (C.K. Ogden), notably in four books:

I. ''Foundations of Aesthetics'' (1922) presents the principles of ''aesthetic reception'', the bases of the literary theory of “harmony”;  aesthetic understanding derives from the balance of competing psychological impulses. The structure of the ''Foundations of Aesthetics''—a survey of the competing definitions of the term ''æsthetic''—prefigures the multiple-definitions work in the books ''Basic Rules of Reason'' (1933), ''Mencius on the Mind: Experiments in Multiple Definition'' (1932), and  ''Coleridge on Imagination'' (1934)

II. ''[[The Meaning of Meaning|The Meaning of Meaning: A Study of the Influence of Language upon Thought and of the Science of Symbolism]]'' (1923) presents the triadic theory of [[semiotics]] that depends upon psychological theory, and so anticipates the importance of psychology in the exercise of literary criticism. Semioticians, such as [[Umberto Eco]], acknowledged that the methodology of the triadic theory of semiotics improved upon the methodology of the dyadic theory of semiotics presented by [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] (1857–1913).

III. ''Basic English: A General Introduction with Rules and Grammar'' (1930) and IV. the ''Times of India Guide to Basic English'' (1938) developed the [[Basic English]] program in effort to develop an international language, an [[International auxiliary language|interlanguage]] based upon a vocabulary of  850 English words.

Richards' travels, especially in China, effectively situated him as the advocate for an international program, such as Basic English. Moreover, at Harvard University, to his international pedagogy, the instructor I. A. Richards began to integrate the available new media for mass communications, especially [[television]].

===Aesthetics and literary criticism===
====Theory====
[[File:William Empson.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The poet and literary critic William Empson (1906–84), developed the methodology of New Criticism with the practice of [[close reading|closely reading]] of literary works, prose and poetry; his best-known work is ''Seven Types of Ambiguity'' (1930)]]

I. A. Richards' paternity of the [[New Criticism]] is in two books of [[critical theory]], ''The Principles of Literary Criticism'' (1924) and ''Practical Criticism'' (1929). The first book, ''The Principles of Literary Criticism'', discusses the subjects of  [[Substantial form|form]], [[Value (semiotics)|value]], [[rhythm]], coenesthesia (awareness of inhabiting one's body, caused by stimuli from various organs), literary infectiousness, [[allusion|allusiveness]], divergent readings, and [[belief]]. The second book, ''Practical Criticism'' (1929), is an [[empirical study]] of ''inferior response'' to a literary text.

As an instructor of English literature  at Cambridge University, Richards tested the critical-thinking abilities of his pupils; he removed [[author]]ial and contextual information from thirteen poems, one by [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] (1807– 82), and assigned the literary interpretations to undergraduate students in order to ascertain the likely impediments to an ''adequate response'' to a literary text. That experiment in [[Pedagogy|pedagogical]] approach — critical reading without contexts — demonstrated the variety and the depth of the possible textual misreadings that might be committed, by university student and layman reader alike.

The critical method derived from that pedagogical approach did not propose a new [[hermeneutics]], a new methodology of interpretation, but questioned the purposes and efficacy of the critical process of literary interpretation, by analysing the self-reported critical interpretations of university students. To that end, effective critical work required a closer [[aesthetic interpretation]] of the literary text as an object; which methodology produced the empirical-study work about the teaching of composition, e.g. “A Cognitive Process Theory of Writing ” (1981), by [[Linda Flower]] and John R. Hayes (see: [[Writing process]]).

To substantiate interpretive criticism, Richards provided theories of [[metaphor]], [[value (ethics)|value]], and [[Tone (literature)|tone]], of stock response, incipient action, and pseudo-statement; and of [[ambiguity]]. This last subject, the theory of ''ambiguity'', was developed in ''[[Seven Types of Ambiguity]]'' (1930), by [[William Empson]], a former student of Richards'; moreover, additional to ''The Principles of Literary Criticism'' and ''Practical Criticism'', Empson's book on ambiguity became the third foundational document for the methodology of the [[New Criticism]].

To Richards, literary criticism was [[Impressionism (literature)|impressionistic]], too abstract to be readily grasped and understood, by most readers; and he proposed that literary criticism could be precise in communicating meanings, by way of denotation and connotation. To establish critical precision, Richards examined the [[Working memory|psychological processes]] of writing and of the [[Reading (process)|reading]] of poetry. That in reading poetry and making sense of it “in the degree in which we can order ourselves, we need nothing more”; the reader need not believe the poetry, because the literary importance of poetry is in provoking emotions in the reader.&lt;ref&gt;Glicksberg, Charles I. "I. A. Richards and the Science of Criticism." ''The Sewanee Review'' 46.4 (1938). JSTOR. Web. &lt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/27535493&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

====New rhetoric====
As a rhetorician, I. A. Richards said that the old form of studying [[rhetoric]] (the art of [[discourse]]) was too concerned with the mechanics of formulating [[argument]]s and with conflict; instead, he proposed the New Rhetoric to study of the meaning of the parts of discourse, as “a study of misunderstanding and its remedies” to determine how language works. That [[ambiguity]] is expected, and that meanings (denotation and connotation) are not inherent to words, but are inherent to the perception of the reader, the listener, and the viewer. By their usages, compiled from experience, people decide and determine meaning by “how words are used in a sentence”, in spoken and written language.&lt;ref&gt;Hochmuth, Marie. "I. A Richards and the ‘New Rhetoric’ new royal”, ''Quarterly Journal of Speech'' 44.1 (1958): 1. Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== The semantic triangle =====
I. A. Richards and C. K. Ogden created the [[semantic triangle]] to deliver improved understanding to how words come to mean.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Rhetoric of Western Thought|last=Golden, Berquist, Coleman, Sproule|first=|publisher=Kendall-Hunt|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=265–268}}&lt;/ref&gt; The semantic triangle has three parts, the symbol or word, the referent, and the thought or reference.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the bottom, right corner is the Referent, the thing, in reality,  Placed at the left corner is the symbol or word. At the top point, the convergence of the literal word and the object in reality; it is our intangible idea about the object. Ultimately,  the english meaning of the words is determined by an individual's unique experience.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Feedforward===
At the age of 75 years, I. A. Richards was approached by the ''Saturday Review'' to write a piece for their "What I Have Learned" series. Richards surprisingly took this opportunity to expound upon his lesser known concept of "feedforward".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/dl/free/0073385026/228359/meanmean.pdf  |title=The Meaning of Meaning of I. A. RIchards,  |chapter=Five  |deadurl=yes  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029193836/http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/dl/free/0073385026/228359/meanmean.pdf  |archivedate=29 October 2013  |df=dmy-all  }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Richards, feedforward is the concept of anticipating the effect of one's words by acting as our own critic. It is thought to work in the opposite direction of feedback, though it works essentially towards the same goal: to clarify unclear concepts. Existing in all forms of communication,&lt;ref name="The Communication Blog"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tcbdevito.blogspot.com/2010/11/i-want-to-broaden-communication-blog-to.html |title= The Communication Blog, |section= Feedforward }}&lt;/ref&gt; feedforward acts as a pretest that any writer can use to anticipate the impact of their words on their audience. According to Richards, feedforward allows the writer to then engage with their text to make necessary changes to create a better effect. He believes that communicators who do not use feedforward will seem dogmatic. Richards wrote more in depth about the idea and importance of feedforward in communication in his book ''Speculative Instruments'' and has claimed that feedforward was his most important learned concept.&lt;ref name="The Communication Blog"/&gt;

===Influence===
Richards served as mentor and teacher to other prominent critics, most notably [[William Empson]] and [[F. R. Leavis]], though Leavis was contemporary with Richards, Empson much younger. Other critics primarily influenced by his writings also included [[Cleanth Brooks]] and [[Allen Tate]]. Later critics who refined the formalist approach to New Criticism by actively rejecting his psychological emphasis included, besides Brooks and Tate, [[John Crowe Ransom]], [[W. K. Wimsatt]], [[R. P. Blackmur]], and [[Murray Krieger]]. [[R. S. Crane]] of the Chicago school was both indebted to Richards's theory and critical of its psychological assumptions. They all admitted the value of his seminal ideas but sought to salvage what they considered his most useful assumptions from the theoretical excesses they felt he brought to bear in his criticism. Like Empson, Richards proved a difficult model for the New Critics, but his model of [[close reading]] provided the basis for their interpretive methodology.

The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] records that I. A. Richards coined the term '''feedforward''', in 1951, at the 8th annual [[Macy Conferences]] on [[cybernetics]]. In the event, the term extended the intellectual and critical influence of Richards to cybernetics which makes liberal use of the term ''feedforward'', as in [[Feedforward, Behavioral and Cognitive Science|Feedforward]]. Moreover, among Richards' students was [[Marshall McLuhan]], who also applied the term and the ideas of feedforward.

'''''Insignificance: Hong Kong Stories''''' is a 2018 collection of short stories by [[Xu Xi (writer)|Xu Xi]], published by [[Signal 8 Press]]. The book has eleven stories total.

Xu Xi wrote the collection before she planned to move to the United States, and the title indicates her goodbye to Hong Kong. Richard Lord of the ''[[South China Morning Post]]'' stated that since the book has its principal characters have a "deeply conflicted relationship" with  Hong Kong itself as well as the book having elements of familial issues, the question of a person's identity, sexual issues, and "verbal cruelty", it is of the typical style of the author.&lt;ref name=Lord&gt;{{cite web|author=Lord, Richard|url=https://www.scmp.com/culture/books/article/2148889/insignificance-hong-kong-stories-review-author-xu-xis-farewell-hong|title=Insignificance: Hong Kong Stories|publisher=''[[South China Morning Post]]''|date=2018-06-04|accessdate=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book specifically includes content about the identities of [[Hong Kong people]].&lt;ref name=YangJing&gt;{{cite web|author=Yang, Jing ([[Nanjing Normal University]])|url=https://www.worldliteraturetoday.org/2018/september/insignificance-hong-kong-stories-xu-xi|title=''Insignificance: Hong Kong Stories'' by Xu Xi|publisher=''[[World Literature Today]]''|date=September 2018|accessdate=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
The stories include criticism of economic inequality, racism,&lt;ref name=Lord/&gt; and other contemporary issues in Hong Kong. Yang Jing of [[Nanjing Normal University]] stated that "colonial vestiges" appear throughout the stories.&lt;ref name=YangJing/&gt; Death is a common element in these stories, and Lord stated that overall the collection is "not terribly cheerful, although in places it is very witty."&lt;ref name=Lord/&gt;

"Longevity’s Eyebrow", the first story in the book, involves a white man named Jonathan Bracken seducing his friend, an ethnic Chinese woman named Stella Yuen, who serves as the story's narrator, and who had not been previously engaging in sex. Lord described Bracken as "an instantly recognisable Xu Xi Lothario, oozing white-man entitlement."&lt;ref name=Lord/&gt;

"Off the Record" involves the [[Umbrella Movement]],&lt;ref name=YangJing/&gt; and the narrator becomes interested in having sex with a potential client after formerly having a lack of interest in sex altogether.&lt;ref name=Lord/&gt; The story includes a quote made by [[Mao Zedong]].&lt;ref name=YangJing/&gt;

In "Mariner" a Hong Konger named Dirk engages in a conversation with an American pilot named Bobby whilst at a bar. Dirk misses talking to Bobby after he leaves even though he initially dislikes talking to him; Lord describes Bobby as "outgoing" and "conservative".&lt;ref name=Lord/&gt;

"15th anniversary", which has income inequality as its main theme, stars Christopher Woo, an alumnus of [[La Salle College]] who has a lower income existence while his fellow former classmates at his 15th anniversary school reunion have higher socioeconomic levels. Lord states that the story is "a beautifully nuanced, richly associative, haunting portrait of a defeated man" while he describes Woo as "one of the [...] most memorable creations" in ''Insignificance''.&lt;ref name=Lord/&gt;

In "Canine News" Xu Xi uses her metaphor of racism as a disease, having a proposal to erect "The Doghouse" and imprison people with racist views there. In the story the narrator suggests that a severely low [[minimum wage]] is the reason why a bar in [[Tsim Sha Tsui]] does not have a good vibe. According to Lord, "Canine News" is "semi-autobiographical".&lt;ref name=Lord/&gt; Yang Jing describes the story as "[[Swiftian]]",&lt;ref name=YangJing/&gt; and Lord stated the story has several of the "most sardonic swipes at" Hong Kong present in ''Insignificance''.&lt;ref name=Lord/&gt; Another story, "Doghouse Rhapsody" discusses various possible sources for racism.&lt;ref name=YangJing/&gt;

The final story is "All About Skin," in which characters decide to change the colours of their own skin upon learning they could do so.&lt;ref name=Lord/&gt; This story continues the racism as a disease metaphor,&lt;ref name=YangJing/&gt; and also discusses perceived triviality of beauty, consumerism, and the relations between countries. Lord characterises it as experimental.&lt;ref name=Lord/&gt;

==Reception==
Lord gave the book four of five stars and stated that the author "remains both evocative and efficient as a delineator of character".&lt;ref name=Lord/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2556">'''John William Grout''' (July 25, 1843 – October 21, 1861) was an [[American Civil War]] soldier from [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], whose death inspired the poem "The Vacant Chair".  

==Life and death==  
The son of Jonathan and Mary Jane Grout, John William Grout was born July 25, 1843, at Worcester, Massachusetts.  He was a graduate of [[Phillips Academy, Andover]] in 1859. 

He served as a 2nd lieutenant of Company D, [[15th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry|15th Massachusetts Infantry]] and was killed at age eighteen at the [[Battle of Ball's Bluff|Battle of Ball’s Bluff]]. Lt. Grout's body was recovered on November 5, 1861, after being washed 35 miles back to [[Washington, D.C.]] His remains were identified by the name written on his clothing.

==Poem==
His death inspired a famous poem that was later turned into a Civil War song. The poem ("The Vacant Chair") is an allegory that describes the pain suffered by the family of those killed in war when sitting at the [[Thanksgiving]] table. The poem was written by [[Henry S. Washburn]] and was turned into song by [[George F. Root]]. Root wrote "[[The Battle Cry of Freedom]]", "[[Tramp! Tramp! Tramp!]]" and other songs of the Civil War. "The Vacant Chair" was a hit in both the North and the South.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2315">A '''leading actor''', '''leading actress''', '''star''', or simply '''lead''', plays the role of the [[protagonist]] of a film, television show or play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/lead_10 |title=lead noun (ACTOR) - definition in the British English Dictionary &amp; Thesaurus - Cambridge Dictionaries Online |publisher=Dictionary.cambridge.org |date=2014-04-28 |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''lead'' may also refer to the largest role in the piece and ''leading actor'' may refer to a person who typically plays such parts or an actor with a respected body of work. Some [[actor]]s are [[typecasting (acting)|typecast]] as leads, but most play the lead in some performances and [[supporting actor|supporting]] or [[character actor|character]] roles in others.

Sometimes there is more than one significant leading role in a dramatic piece, and the actors are said to play ''co-leads''; a large [[supporting actor|supporting role]] may be considered a ''secondary lead''. Award nominations for acting often reflect such ambiguities.  Thus, sometimes two actors in the same performance piece are nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] or [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] -- categories traditionally reserved for leads. For example, in 1935 [[Clark Gable]], [[Charles Laughton]] and [[Franchot Tone]] were each nominated for the Best Actor [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for ''[[Mutiny on the Bounty (1935 film)|Mutiny on the Bounty]]''. There can even be controversy over whether a particular performance should be nominated in the Best Actor/Actress or [[Best Supporting Actor]]/[[Best Supporting Actress|Actress]] category.

A [[title role]] is often but not necessarily the lead. A lead role must also be differentiated from a starring role, which means that an actor is credited as a part of the main cast, but not that he necessarily plays the main character.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6679">[[File:Lisa telford haida.jpg|thumb|Lisa Telford]]
'''Lisa Telford''' (born in [[Ketchikan, Alaska]]) is a Git'ans Git'anee [[Haida people|Haida]] weaver who creates contemporary garments, shoes and other objects using [[Textile arts of indigenous peoples of the Americas#Northwest coast|Northwest Coast style weaving techniques]]. Her work serves as a commentary on Native identity, stereotypes and fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nativeartsandcultures.org/lisa-telford|title=Native Art and Cultures Foundation|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her baskets may be seen in the collections of [[Oregon Historical Society|The Oregon Historical Society]], [[Hallie Ford Museum of Art]], the [[National Museum of the American Indian|Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian]], the [[Heard Museum]], the [[Portland Art Museum]], the [[Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture|Burke Museum]] and at [[Stonington Gallery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://artisttrust.org/index.php/award-winners/artist-profile/lisa_telford|title=Artist Trust|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://stoningtongallery.com/artist/lisa-telford/#current|title=Lisa Telford - Stonington Gallery|work=Stonington Gallery|access-date=2018-09-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Training ==
Telford comes from a long line of weavers including her grandmother, mother, aunt and cousins.&lt;ref name="Stonington Gallery"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stoningtongallery.com/artist/lisa-telford/#bio|title=Stonington Gallery|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite her Indiana upbringing, she grew up connected to her culture, visiting Alaska for traditional gatherings and potlatches and participating in traditional dance.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://indiancountrymedianetwork.com/news/lisa-telford-celebrating-the-beauty-of-nature/|title=Lisa Telford: Celebrating the Beauty of Nature|last=Walker|first=Richard|date=April 27, 2011|work=Indian Country Today|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 16 years Telford worked as a carpenter. In 1996, she took a position as a job developer with a nonprofit organization called ANEW — Apprenticeship and Nontraditional Employment for Women and Men.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/native-artist-low-profile-here-big-elsewhere/|title=Native artist low-profile here, big elsewhere|last=Wright|first=Diane|date=September 13, 2006|work=The Seattle Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 35, she began learning to weave traditional [[Haida people|Haida]] baskets from her aunt, [[Delores Churchill]], and traditional cedar garments from her cousin, Holly Churchill.

== Creative process ==
Telford stuck strictly to the tradition of form follows function until 2004 when she went into contemporary cedar clothing, cedar shoes, cowboy boots and neckties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://imndn.org/artwork/3880704-Lisa-Telford-Too-Haida.html|title=Woven: The Art of Contemporary Native Basketry|last=|first=|date=|website=IMNDN|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Telford tells of her work:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I harvest and prepare my own material, using red &amp; yellow cedar bark and spruce root in my work. Harvesting cedar bark takes me hundreds of miles from home and many hours of preparation time. Materials are prepared differently depending on the final product. The bark is traditionally stored for one year and then further processing is required before weaving may start.&lt;ref name="Stonington Gallery"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After that, baskets can take Telford five to 200 hours to make.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

As a young weaver she once sat down and counted every stitch on one of her grandmother's old baskets. "At first my basketry had to be perfect, and then I let it all go and that's when I found true joy".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The artist compares making baskets to therapy, saying it helps her relax from the stresses of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nmai.si.edu/exhibitions/baskets/subpage.cfm?subpage=view_lisa|title=The language of Native American Baskets from the Weaver's View|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also called basketry her thread to sanity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Collaborations ==

In 2011, Telford worked with glass artist [[Preston Singletary]] on an exhibition of women's forms in glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nativeartsandcultures.org/lisa-telford|title=Native Arts and Cultures Foundation|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2011, Telford received in the National Native Artist Exchange Grant to work with [[Kelly Church]]. She taught Kelly how to find and choose the proper cedar tree for harvesting, how to split and prepare the bark to be stored.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nefa.org/grantees/lisa-telford|title=Lisa Telford - Grant Recipient|last=|first=|date=|website=New England Foundation for the Arts|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6322">A '''living document''', also known as an '''evergreen document''' or '''dynamic document''', is a [[document]] that is continually edited and updated. An example of a living document is an article in [[Wikipedia]], an online encyclopedia that permits anyone to freely edit its articles, in contrast to "dead" or "static" documents, such as an article in a single edition of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''.

A living document may or may not have a framework for updates, changes, or adjustments.  This type of document without proper context can change away from its original purpose through multiple uncontrolled edits. This can encourage open collaboration within the network, but in some cases there can also be stagnation if no one takes on the initiative of updating the work. One reason why initiative is not taken to update the document could come from [[ambiguity effect|a sense of ambiguity]].

However, a living document may evolve through successive updates, be expanded as needed, and serve a different purpose over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shanahan|first1=Daniel R|title=A living document: reincarnating the research article|journal=Trials|date=11 April 2015|volume=16|issue=1|page=151|doi=10.1186/s13063-015-0666-5|pmc=4403711|url=http://www.trialsjournal.com/content/16/1/151|pmid=25873052}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Living documents are changed through revisions that may or may not reference previous iterative changes.  The rate of document drift depends on the structure of the original document, or original intent of such document, or guidelines for modifying such document.

==In law==
{{further|Living Constitution}}
===Canada===
In Canadian law, this concept is called the "[[living tree doctrine]]" (French: ''théorie de l'arbre vivant''). The 1929 case ''[[Edwards v. Canada (Attorney General)]]'', which decided upon the right of women to sit in the Canadian Senate, was the first to establish this principle. The case was decided by the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]], whereupon [[Viscount Sankey]] wrote of the ruling: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The British North America Act planted in Canada a living tree capable of growth and expansion within its natural limits. The object of the Act was to grant a Constitution to Canada. Like all written constitutions it has been subject to development through usage and convention...
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Their Lordships do not conceive it to be the duty of this Board—it is certainly not their desire—to cut down the provisions of the Act by a narrow and technical construction, but rather to give it a large and liberal interpretation so that the Dominion to a great extent, but within certain fixed limits, may be mistress in her own house, as the provinces to a great extent, but within certain fixed limits, are mistresses in theirs.&lt;ref name = Edwards&gt;[http://www.chrc-ccdp.ca/en/browseSubjects/edwardspc.asp Reference to Meaning of Word "Persons" in Section 24 of British North America Act, 1867. (Judicial Committee of The Privy Council). Edwards v. A.G. of Canada &amp;#91;1930&amp;#93; A.C. 124] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150328051442/http://www.chrc-ccdp.ca/en/browseSubjects/edwardspc.asp |date=March 28, 2015 }}. ''Human Rights in Canada: A Historical Perspective''.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
From this the approach was born what became known as the [[living tree doctrine]] which requires "large and liberal" interpretation, declaring a doctrine of constitutional interpretation that says that a constitution is organic and must be read in a broad and progressive manner so as to adapt it to the changing times.

The living tree principle was again expressed by the Supreme Court of Canada, in Re: Same-Sex Marriage (2004), when it held that Parliament (as opposed to provincial legislatures) had the power to define marriage as including same-sex unions. It rejected claims that the constitutionally enumerated federal authority in matters of "Marriage and Divorce" could not include same-sex marriage because marriage as conceived in 1867 was necessarily opposite-sex:

{{quote|The "frozen concepts" reasoning runs contrary to one of the most fundamental principles of Canadian constitutional interpretation: that our Constitution is a living tree which, by way of progressive interpretation, accommodates and addresses the realities of modern life.&lt;ref&gt;Supreme Court of Canada, in its ruling, Re: Same-Sex Marriage, December [[2004 in Canada|2004]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===The United States===
In United States constitutional law, the Living Constitution, also known as loose constructionism, permits the Constitution as a static document to have an interpretation that shifts over time as the cultural context changes. The opposing view, [[originalism]], holds that the original intent or meaning of the writers of the Constitution should guide its interpretation.

==In business==
In business a living document may fall under corporate [[change management]] or be shared among a team.  It may start as a draft that at some time graduates into general acceptance, or may originate as part of a formal documentation process.  Regardless of the degree of formality, a living document needs rules or guidelines for its modification.  Such guidelines allow — and should ideally encourage — the document's evolution over time.  It is in this sense of ''growth'' that the document can be thought of as "living."

==In technology==
In technology, living documents can be implemented using a [[wiki]]. Other common living document tools are [[Google Docs]], [[Nextcloud]] Collabora, etc.

Living documents can also be implemented by using test tools such as "HipTest"

Living documentation is a key concept in [[Specification by example]].

==In pastoral theology==
In [[pastoral theology]] the 'living document' refers to an individual person.

[[File:Marzocco.jpg|thumb|The ''Marzocco'' now in [[Piazza della Signoria]], a replica of Donatello's]]  [The term "Marzocco"; unfathomable to some scholars,  by many accounts deontes from the Latin word: "Marte" or Mars, which in Medieval times, was considered the Roman God of War.]
The '''''Marzocco'''''  is the [[lion (heraldry)|heraldic lion]] that is a symbol of [[Florence]], and was apparently the first piece of public secular sculpture commissioned by the [[Republic of Florence]], in the late 14th century.  It stood at the heart of the city in the [[Piazza della Signoria]] at the end of the platform attached to the [[Palazzo Vecchio]] called the ''ringhiera'', from which speakers traditionally harangued the crowd.  This is now lost, having weathered with time to an unrecognizable mass of stone.

The best known rendition is by [[Donatello]], made in 1418&amp;ndash;20.  Donatello’s ''Marzocco'' was placed in the Piazza della Signoria in 1812, but in 1885 it was moved to the [[Bargello]], having been replaced by the copy we see to this day.

==The first Marzocco==
[[File:Domenico Ghirlandaio - Confirmation of the Rule (detail) - WGA08808.jpg|thumb|left|[[Domenico Ghirlandaio]], ''Confirmation of the Rule'' (detail) - the original ''Marzocco'' can be seen on the corner of the palazzo in the background at left, 1480s.]]
The original that had stood since (perhaps) 1377, and is now lost, appears to have been similar to Donatello's in design, though it was fully [[gilding|gilded]] and may have crouched over a submissive wolf representing Florence's great rival [[Siena]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/users/node/15256 Victoria and Albert Museum], page on their replica of the Donatello&lt;/ref&gt;  It can be seen in the background of several paintings and prints, though by the time it was replaced it was so worn that (being only medieval, not classical) it was not considered worth keeping, and disappeared.  About 1460 it was given a richly sculptural [[Socle (architecture)|socle]] with double [[baluster]]-like motifs&lt;ref&gt;"Resembling pairs of handleless ''all'antica'' urns arranged like the bulbs of a Roman [[candelabrum]]", according to Paul Davies and David Hemsoll, "Renaissance Balusters and the Antique" ''Architectural History'' '''26''' (1983:1&amp;ndash;122)  p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; at the corners.  The ''ringhiera'', once a platform from which the ''Signoria'' addressed the people, then a focus for popular tumult, was removed at the same time as the statue was replaced by Donatello's on a pedestal in 1812.

===Name===
The obscure name ''Marzocco'', unfathomable to some scholars, would by others derive from ''Marte'' ([[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]), whose Roman statue, was known as the "Roman God of War";  noted by Dante&lt;ref&gt;Dante,''Inferno'' XIII.146f, ''Purgatorio'' XXXI.58f.&lt;/ref&gt; and carried away by a flood of the [[Arno]] in 1333, had previously been Florence’s emblem.&lt;ref&gt;Lo Zingarelli 2008: ''Vocabolario della lingua italiana,'' Zanichelli (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; The lion is seated and with one paw supports the coat-of-arms of Florence, the [[fleur de lys]] called ''il giglio'', the lily. ''Marzocco'' was` invoked in the Florentine [[battle cry]] and figures in Gentile Aretino's poem "Alla battaglia":
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[[Saint George|San Giorgio]],&lt;ref&gt;The war cry of the [[Republic of Genoa]], which had Saint George as its patron.&lt;/ref&gt; Marzoccho&lt;!--Marzoccho in original--&gt; Marzoccho&lt;br&gt;
suona percuoti, forbocta rintoccho&lt;br&gt;
Palle palle,&lt;ref&gt;The ''palle'' or balls of the [[Medici]] coat-of-arms.&lt;/ref&gt; Marzoccho Marzoccho&lt;br&gt;
legagli strecti e pon lor buona taglia!"&lt;ref&gt;"Sound the trumpets! beat the drums! ...Bind them fast and hold them to a good ransom:" discussed and printed by Timothy J. McGee, "'Alla Battaglia': Music and Ceremony in Fifteenth-Century Florence" ''Journal of the American Musicological Society'' '''36'''.2 (Summer 1983:287&amp;ndash;302).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Tuscany6.jpg|thumb|220px|The ''Marzocco'' was crowned on [[Postage stamps and postal history of Tuscany|Tuscany's first postage stamp]], 1851.]]

===Symbol===
The ''Marzocco'' was such a powerful symbol of the [[Republic of Florence|Florentine Republic]] that the republican Florentine troops in the  [[Siege of Florence (1529&amp;ndash;1530)]] were known as ''marzoccheschi'', "sons of the Marzocco",&lt;ref&gt;Noted in Ulysse Robert, ''Philibert de Chalon, prince d'Orange, vice-roi de Naples'' (Paris: Plon-Nourrit) 1902:374; [[Benedetto Varchi]], ''Storia fiorentina'' xlv remarks upon a severe skirmish with them, "una piuttosto battaglia che scaramuccia co'Marzoccheschi".&lt;/ref&gt; and pro-Medici besiegers of the city in 1530 held a funeral and ritually buried a representation of it, with bells tolling.&lt;ref&gt;Richard C. Trexler, ''Public Life in Renaissance Florence'' (Academic Press) 1980, p. 4 note 9, drawing upon [[Benedetto Varchi]] xi.&lt;/ref&gt;  Prisoners of war from [[Pisa]] were forced to kiss it in 1364.&lt;ref&gt;"A still earlier ''Marzocco'' stood on this site, which the Pisan captives were forced ignominiously to kiss in 1364. The origin of the name Marzocco is unknown." Augustus Hare, ''Florence'' ([http://www.florin.ms/hareintro.html on-line text]).&lt;/ref&gt;
At [[Anghiari]], subject to Florence from 1385, the 15th-century Palazzo del Marzocco faces the church; at [[Montepulciano]] stands the ''Marzocco'' column; at [[Volterra]] the ''Marzocco'' stands against the Palazzo dei Priori, seat of government; at [[Livorno]] the 15th-century ''Torre del Marzocco'' (''illustration, right'') guards the harbor entrance; and at [[Pietrasanta]] there are a 16th-century ''Marzocco'' fountain and the ''Marzocco'' column, erected in 1513 when [[Pope Leo X]] awarded the commune to Florence.
[[File:Torre del Marzocco.jpg|thumb|220px|The ''Torre del Marzocco'' in [[Livorno]].]]
In the subjected territory of Pisa, when [[Charles VIII of France]] entered Sarzana in 1494, the Pisans took the ''Marzocco'', emblem of their subjugation to Florence, and cast it into the Arno.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'' 1911, ''s.v.'' "Pisa"&lt;/ref&gt; Live lions were kept at the commune's expense from the Middle Ages until they were banished in 1771.

At times the ''Marzocco'' would be crowned according to a motto by the writer of [[Novella|novelle]]'' [[Franco Sacchetti]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Corona porto, per la patria degna,&lt;br&gt;
Acciochè libertà ciascun mantegna."&lt;ref&gt;"I wear a crown worthy of my country, in order that everyone might maintain liberty", according to the translation in Susan and Joanne Horner, ''Walks in Florence: Churches, Streets and Palaces'' London, Henry S. King &amp; Co., 1877 ([http://www.florin.ms/hwalks15.html on-line text]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Donatello's==
Donatello's ''Marzocco'' was commissioned by the Republic of Florence for the apartment of [[Pope Martin V]] at [[Santa Maria Novella]], where this traditional ''insegna'' of communal republican defense&lt;ref&gt;Deliberations on the placement of the comparably Cock symbolic [[David (Michelangelo)|Michelangelo's ''David'']] included suggestions that it displace the ''Marzocco'', to be shifted to the doorway of [[Palazzo della Signoria]]: see Saul Levine, "The Location of Michelangelo's David: The Meeting of January 25, 1504" ''The Art Bulletin'' '''56'''.1 (March 1974:31&amp;ndash;49) especially p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; stood guard atop a column at the foot of the stairs that led to the ''sale del papa'' ("Papal apartments") in the convent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/html/d/donatell/1_early/2marzocc.html Donatello's original ''Marzocco'']&lt;/ref&gt;  It is sculpted in the fine-grained gray sandstone of Tuscany called ''pietra serena''.  The Pope lingered at Florence after leaving the [[Council of Constance]] during the [[Western Schism]]. This staircase was demolished, perhaps by 1515.&lt;ref&gt;V&amp;A&lt;/ref&gt;

The Donatello ''Marzocco'' was moved to the [[Piazza della Signoria]] in 1812,&lt;ref&gt;Touring Club Italiano, ''Firenze e dintorni'' (Milan) 1964 pp. 116, 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

==After 1812==
A crowned ''Marzocco'', emphasizing the sovereign independence of [[Tuscany]], appears on [[Postage stamps and postal history of Tuscany|Tuscany's first issue of postage stamps]], 1851.

''Il Marzocco'' was adopted for the name of a progressive weekly literary review in broadsheet format published in Florence in 1896&amp;ndash;1932.

The '''''Monteripido Altarpiece''''' is a double-sided altarpiece by [[Perugino]], completed in 1502 for San Francesco al Monte church in [[Monteripido]] near Perugia. It is now in the [[Galleria Nazionale dell'Umbria]] in [[Perugia]]. 

==Recto==
[[File:Perugino, pala di monteripido, recto.jpg|thumb|left|Recto]]
This side was produced as the background for an earlier wooden crucifix, which is still in situ. It shows figures surrounding the [[Crucifixion of Christ]], with (from left to right) the [[Virgin Mary]], [[Mary Magdalene]], [[Francis of Assisi]] (there was a Franciscan monastery in Monteripido) and [[John the Apostle]]. It largely reuses pre-existing drawings and cartoons made by Perugino - the figures around the cross reuse those from his Florence ''[[Crucifixion (Perugino)|Crucifixion]]'' (1494-1496), whilst the two angels catching Christ's blood in chalices are variants on those in ''[[Agony in the Garden (Perugino)|Agony in the Garden]]'' (c.1483-1495).

==Verso==
[[File:Pietro Perugino cat65a.jpg|thumb|right|Verso]]
This shows the [[Coronation of the Virgin]], again reusing several previous cartoons, drawings and compositions from his other paintings of the same subject, such as his lost frescoes in the [[Sistine Chapel]] (1481-82) and the group of apostles from the [[Annunziata Altarpiece]] (1504-1507) and the [[San Pietro Polyptych]] (c.1496-1500). The angel with a garland, however, does not have a precedent in his earlier works.

'''Multimedia'''  is [[content (media)|content]] that uses a combination of different [[content format|content forms]] such as text, audio, images, animations, video and [[interactive]] content. Multimedia contrasts with [[Media (communication)|media]] that use only rudimentary computer displays such as text-only or traditional forms of printed or hand-produced material.

Multimedia can be recorded and played, displayed, interacted with or accessed by [[information]] content processing devices, such as computerized and electronic devices, but can also be part of a live performance.  Multimedia devices are [[electronic media]] devices used to store and experience multimedia content. Multimedia is distinguished from [[mixed media]] in [[fine art]]; for example, by including audio it has a broader scope. In the early years of multimedia the term "rich media" was synonymous with [[interactive media|interactive multimedia]], and "hypermedia" was an application of multimedia.

== Terminology ==
The term ''multimedia'' was coined by singer and artist Bob Goldstein (later '[[Bobb Goldsteinn]]') to promote the July 1966 opening of his "LightWorks at L'Oursin" show at [[Southampton]], Long Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Badii|first=Atta|last2=Fuschi|first2=David|last3=Khan|first3=Ali|last4=Adetoye|first4=Adedayo|date=2009-11-09|title=Accessibility-by-Design: A Framework for Delivery-Context-Aware Personalised Media Content Re-purposing|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-10308-7_14|journal=HCI and Usability for e-Inclusion|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|language=en|publisher=Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg|pages=209–226|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-10308-7_14|isbn=9783642103070}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldstein was perhaps aware of an American artist named Dick Higgins, who had two years previously discussed a new approach to art-making he called "intermedia".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.switched.com/2010/06/03/tech-art-history-part-2/|title=Tech Art History, Part| author= Matthew Zuras| publisher= Switched| date=June 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 10, 1966, Richard Albarino of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' borrowed the terminology, reporting: "Brainchild of songscribe-comic Bob ('[[Washington Square (composition)|Washington Square]]') Goldstein, the 'Lightworks' is the latest ''multi-media'' music-cum-visuals to debut as discothèque fare."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Albarino, "Goldstein's LightWorks at Southhampton," ''Variety'', August 10, 1966. Vol. 213, No. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, in 1968, the term "multimedia" was re-appropriated to describe the work of a political consultant, David Sawyer, the husband of Iris Sawyer—one of Goldstein's producers at L'Oursin.

[[File:Ford Show 1987.jpg|thumb|left|Multimedia (multi-image) setup for the 1988 Ford New Car Announcement Show, August 1987, Detroit, MI]] In the intervening forty years, the word has taken on different meanings. In the late 1970s, the term referred to presentations consisting of [[Multi-Image|multi-projector slide shows]] timed to an audio track. However, by the 1990s 'multimedia' took on its current meaning.

In the 1993 first edition of ''Multimedia: Making It Work'', Tay Vaughan declared "Multimedia is any combination of text, graphic art, sound, animation, and video that is delivered by computer. When you allow the user – the viewer of the project – to control what and when these elements are delivered, it is ''interactive multimedia''. When you provide a structure of linked elements through which the user can navigate, interactive multimedia becomes ''hypermedia''."&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, Tay, 1993, Multimedia: Making It Work (first edition, {{ISBN|0-07-881869-9}}), Osborne/McGraw-Hill, Berkeley, pg. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The German language society [[Gesellschaft für deutsche Sprache]] recognized the word's significance and ubiquitousness in the 1990s by awarding it the title of [[Word of the year (Germany)|German 'Word of the Year']] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://einestages.spiegel.de/external/ShowTopicAlbumBackground/a23795/l23/l0/F.html#featuredEntry ''Ein Jahr, ein (Un-)Wort!''] (in German) [[Spiegel Online]]&lt;/ref&gt; The institute summed up its rationale by stating "[Multimedia] has become a central word in the wonderful new media world".&lt;ref&gt;''Variety'', January 1–7, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

In common usage, ''multimedia'' refers to an electronically delivered combination of media including video, still images, audio, and text in such a way that can be accessed interactively. Much of the content on the web today falls within this definition as understood by millions. Some computers which were marketed in the 1990s were called "multimedia" computers because they incorporated a CD-ROM drive, which allowed for the delivery of several hundred megabytes of video, picture, and audio data. That era saw also a boost in the production of [[education software|educational]] multimedia [[CD-ROM]]s.

The term "video", if not used exclusively to describe motion photography, is ambiguous in multimedia terminology. ''[[Video]]'' is often used to describe the file format, delivery format, or presentation format instead of ''"[[footage]]"''  which is used to distinguish motion [[photography]] from ''"[[animation]]"'' of [[Artistic rendering|rendered]] motion imagery. Multiple forms of information content are often not considered modern forms of presentation such as audio or video. Likewise, single forms of information content with single methods of information processing (e.g. non-interactive audio) are often called multimedia, perhaps to distinguish [[:wiktionary:static|static]] media from [[:wiktionary:active|active]] media. In the [[fine arts]], for example, [[Leda Luss Luyken]]'s [[ModulArt]] brings two key elements of musical composition and film into the world of painting: variation of a theme and movement of and within a picture, making ''ModulArt'' an [[interactive]] multimedia form of art. [[Performing arts]] may also be considered multimedia considering that performers and [[theatrical property|props]] are multiple forms of both content and media.

== Major characteristics ==
'''Multimedia presentations''' may be viewed by person on [[Stage (theatre)|stage]], [[Image projector|projected]], [[transmitted]], or played locally with a [[Media player (application software)|media player]].  A broadcast may be a live or recorded multimedia presentation. Broadcasts and recordings can be either [[Analogue electronics|analog]] or [[Digital circuit|digital]] electronic media technology. Digital [[online]] multimedia may be downloaded or [[Streaming media|streamed]]. Streaming multimedia may be live or on-demand.

'''Multimedia games and simulations''' may be used in a physical environment with special effects, with multiple users in an online [[Computer networking|network]], or locally with an offline computer, [[game console|game system]], or [[simulator]].

The various formats of technological or digital multimedia may be intended to enhance the users' experience, for example to make it easier and faster to convey information. Or in entertainment or art, to transcend everyday experience.

[[File:Classical spectacular laser effects.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A [[Laser lighting display|lasershow]] is a live multimedia performance.]]
Enhanced levels of interactivity are made possible by combining multiple forms of media content. [[Online]] multimedia is increasingly becoming object-oriented and data-driven, enabling applications with [[Collaborative software|collaborative]] [[User innovation|end-user innovation]] and [[personalized|personalization]] on multiple forms of content over time.  Examples of these range from multiple forms of content on Web sites like photo galleries with both images (pictures) and title (text) user-updated, to simulations whose co-efficients, events, illustrations, animations or videos are modifiable, allowing the multimedia "experience" to be altered without reprogramming. In addition to seeing and hearing, [[haptic technology]] enables virtual objects to be felt. Emerging technology involving illusions of [[taste]] and [[odor|smell]] may also enhance the multimedia experience.

== Categorization ==
Multimedia may be broadly divided into '''linear''' and '''non-linear''' categories:
*Linear active content progresses often without any navigational control for the viewer such as a [[movie theater|cinema presentation]];
*Non-linear uses [[interactivity]] to control progress as with a [[video game]] or self-paced [[computer-based training]]. [[Hypermedia]] is an example of non-linear content.

Multimedia [[presentation]]s can be '''live''' or '''recorded''':
*A recorded presentation may allow interactivity via a [[Spatial navigation|navigation system]];
*A live multimedia presentation may allow interactivity via an interaction with the presenter or performer.

== Usage/application ==
[[File:Steven Koonin BP 2005-02-22.jpg|thumb|right|A presentation using [[Microsoft PowerPoint|Powerpoint]]. Corporate presentations may combine all forms of media content.]]
Multimedia finds its application in various areas including, but not limited to, [[Advertising|advertisements]], [[art]], [[education]], [[entertainment]], [[engineering]], [[medicine]], [[mathematics]], [[business]], scientific [[research]] and [[Visual thinking|spatial temporal applications]]. Several examples are as follows:

=== Creative industries ===
[[Creative industries]] use multimedia for a variety of purposes ranging from fine arts, to entertainment, to commercial art, to [[journalism]], to media and software services provided for any of the industries listed below. An individual multimedia designer may cover the spectrum throughout their career. Request for their skills range from technical, to analytical, to creative.

==== Commercial uses ====
Much of the electronic [[old media|old]] and [[new media]] used by commercial artists and graphic designers is multimedia. Exciting presentations are used to grab and keep attention in [[advertising]]. Business to business, and interoffice communications are often developed by [[creative services]] firms for advanced multimedia presentations beyond simple slide shows to sell ideas or liven up training. Commercial multimedia developers may be hired to design for [[governmental services]] and [[Nonprofit|nonprofit services]] applications as well.

==== Entertainment and fine arts ====
Multimedia is heavily used in the entertainment industry, especially to develop [[special effect]]s in movies and animations (VFX, 3D animation, etc.). Multimedia games are a popular pastime and are software programs available either as CD-ROMs or online. Some [[video game]]s also use multimedia features.
Multimedia applications that allow users to actively participate instead of just sitting by as passive recipients of information are called ''interactive multimedia''.
In the [[arts]] there are [[multimedia art]]ists, whose minds are able to blend techniques using different media that in some way incorporates interaction with the viewer. One of the most relevant could be [[Peter Greenaway]] who is melding [[Film|cinema]] with [[opera]] and all sorts of digital media. Another approach entails the creation of multimedia that can be displayed in a traditional fine arts arena, such as an [[art gallery]]. Although multimedia display material may be volatile, the survivability of the content is as strong as any traditional media. Digital recording material may be just as durable and infinitely reproducible with perfect copies every time.

=== Education ===
In [[education]], multimedia is used to produce [[computer-based training]] courses (popularly called CBTs) and reference books like encyclopedia and almanacs. A CBT lets the user go through a series of presentations, text about a particular topic, and associated illustrations in various information formats. [[Edutainment]] is the combination of education with entertainment, especially multimedia entertainment.

Learning theory in the past decade has expanded dramatically because of the introduction of multimedia. Several lines of research have evolved, e.g. [[cognitive load]] and [[multimedia learning]].

From multimedia learning (MML) theory, David Roberts has developed a large group lecture practice using PowerPoint and based on the use of full-slide images in conjunction with a reduction of visible text (all text can be placed in the notes view’ section of PowerPoint).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=TEDx Talks|title=Visual feasts of the mind: matching how we teach to how we learn {{!}} David Roberts {{!}} TEDxLoughboroughU|date=2016-12-13|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJyhTg26w-A&amp;index=5&amp;list=PLoI1XyYg-D9WW51FPWUWLi4ZEp_mVZv5c|accessdate=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method has been applied and evaluated in 9 disciplines. In each experiment, students’ engagement and active learning has been approximately 66% greater, than with the same material being delivered using bullet points, text and speech, corroborating a range of theories presented by multimedia learning scholars like Sweller and Mayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lboro.academia.edu/DRoberts|title=David Roberts {{!}} Loughborough University - Academia.edu|website=lboro.academia.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of media convergence is also becoming a major factor in education, particularly higher education. Defined as separate technologies such as voice (and telephony features), data (and productivity applications) and video that now share resources and interact with each other, media convergence is rapidly changing the curriculum in universities all over the world.

==== Educational technology ====
&lt;p&gt;Multimedia provides students with an alternate means of acquiring knowledge designed to enhance teaching and learning through various mediums and platforms. This technology allows students to learn at their own pace and gives teachers the ability to observe the individual needs of each student. The capacity for multimedia to be used in [[multi-disciplinary]] settings is structured around the idea of creating a hands-on learning environment through the use of technology &lt;ref name=":032"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malik and Agarwal|first=S. and A.|date=October 2012|title=Use of Multimedia as a New Educational Technology
Tool–A Study|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/669a/07732895b025b68f9308560411c55040ade6.pdf|journal=International Journal of Information and Education Technology|volume=2|pages=|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Lessons can be tailored to the subject matter as well as be personalized to the students' varying levels of knowledge on the topic. Learning content can be managed through activities that utilize and take advantage of multimedia platforms&lt;ref name=":032" /&gt;. This kind of learning encourages interactive communication between students and teachers and opens feedback channels, introducing an active learning process especially with the prevalence of [[new media]] and [[social media]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andresen and Brink|first=Brent and Katja|date=2013|title=Multimedia in Education Curriculum|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0022/002241/224187e.pdf|journal=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organizaiton|volume=|pages=140|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Technology has impacted multimedia as it is largely associated with the use of computers or other electronic devices and [[digital media]] due to its capabilities concerning research, communication, problem-solving through simulations and feedback opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collis|first=Betty|title=Anticipating the Impact of Multimedia in Education: Lessons from the Literature|url=https://ris.utwente.nl/ws/files/6401710/K26499__.PDF|journal=Computers in Adult Education and Training|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

=== Social work ===
Multimedia is a robust education and research methodology within the social work context. The five different multimedia which supports the education process are narrative media, [[interactive media]], communicative media, adaptive media, and productive media. Contrary to long-standing belief, multimedia technology in social work education existed before the prevalence of the internet. It takes the form of images, audio, and video into the curriculum. 

First introduced to [[social work]] education by Seabury &amp; Maple in 1993, multimedia technology is utilized to teach social work practice skills including interviewing, crisis intervention, and group work. In comparison with conventional teaching method, including face-to-face courses, multimedia education shortens transportation time, increases knowledge and confidence in a richer and more authentic context for learning, generates interaction between online users, and enhances understanding of conceptual materials for novice students. 

In an attempt to examine the impact of multimedia technology on students’ study, A. Elizabeth Cauble &amp; Linda P. Thurston conducted a research in which Building Family Foundations (BFF), an interactive multimedia training platform, was utilized to assess social work students’ reactions to multimedia technology on variables of knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy. The results states that respondents show a substantial increase in academic knowledge, confidence, and attitude. Multimedia also benefits students because it brings expert to students online, fits students’ schedule, allows students to choose courses that suit them. 

Mayer’s Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning suggests, "people learn more from words and pictures than from words alone." According to Mayer and other scholars, multimedia technology stimulates people’s brains by implementing visual and auditory effects, and thereby assists online users to learn efficiently. Researchers suggest that when users establish dual channels while learning, they tend to understand and memorize better. Mixed literature of this theory are still present in the field of multimedia and social work.

=== Language communication ===
With the spread and development of the English language around the world, it has become an important way of communicating between different people and cultures. Multimedia Technology creates a platform where language can be taught. The traditional form of teaching English as a Second Language (ESL) in classrooms have drastically changed with the prevalence of technology, making easier for students to obtain language learning skills. Multimedia motivates students to learn more languages through audio, visual and animation support. It also helps create English contexts since an important aspect of learning a language is developing their grammar, vocabulary and knowledge of pragmatics and genres. In addition, cultural connections in terms of forms, contexts, meanings and ideologies have to be constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yang|first=Weiyan|last2=Fang|first2=Fan|date=November 2008|title=Optimization of Multimedia English Teaching

Revista Electrónica de Investigación Educativa|volume=17|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its effects on learning behavior. Their findings based on [[Howard Gardner|Gardner]]’s theory of the “[[Motivation in second-language learning|socio-educational model]] of learner motivation and attitudes”, the study shows that there is easier access to language learning materials as well as increased motivation with MI along with the use of [[Computer-assisted language learning|Computer-Assisted Language Learning]].

=== Journalism ===
Newspaper companies all over are trying to embrace the new phenomenon by implementing its practices in their work. While some have been slow to come around, other major newspapers like ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[USA Today]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]'' are setting the precedent for the positioning of the newspaper industry in a globalized world.

News reporting is not limited to traditional media outlets. Freelance journalists can make use of different new media to produce multimedia pieces for their news stories. It engages global audiences and tells stories with technology, which develops new communication techniques for both media producers and consumers. The Common Language Project, later renamed to [[The Seattle Globalist]], is an example of this type of multimedia journalism production.

Multimedia reporters who are mobile (usually driving around a community with cameras, audio and video recorders, and laptop computers) are often referred to as [[Mojo (mobile journalist)|mojos]], from ''mo''bile ''jo''urnalist.

=== Engineering ===
[[Software engineer]]s may use multimedia in [[Simulations#Computer simulators|computer simulations]] for anything from entertainment to [[training]] such as military or industrial training. Multimedia for [[Graphical user interface|software interfaces]] are often done as a collaboration between [[creative professional]]s and software engineers.

=== Mathematical and scientific research ===
In [[mathematics|mathematical]] and scientific [[research]], multimedia is mainly used for modeling and simulation. For example, a [[scientist]] can look at a [[Molecular modelling|molecular model]] of a particular substance and manipulate it to arrive at a new substance. Representative research can be found in journals such as the ''[[Journal of Multimedia]]''.

=== Medicine ===
In [[medicine]], [[Physician|doctors]] can get trained by looking at a virtual [[surgery]] or they can simulate how the [[human body]] is affected by [[disease]]s spread by [[virus]]es and [[bacterium|bacteria]] and then develop techniques to prevent it. Multimedia applications such as [[virtual surgery|virtual surgeries]] also help doctors to get practical training.

== Associations and conferences ==
In Europe, the reference organisation for the multimedia industry is the [[European Multimedia Associations Convention]] (EMMAC).

Scholarly conferences about multimedia include:
* [[ACM Multimedia]]
* [[IEEE]] International Conference on Multimedia &amp; Expo (ICME)

'''Nocturne painting''' is a term coined by [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]] to describe a painting style that depicts scenes evocative of the night or subjects as they appear in a veil of light, in twilight, or in the absence of direct light. In a broader usage, the term has come to refer to any  [[Night in paintings (Western art)|painting of a night scene]],&lt;ref&gt;Lawton, Denis. (1992). ''Education And Politics For The 1990s: Conflict Or Consensus?'' (edition reprint). Psychology Press. p. 150. {{ISBN|0750700793}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or night-piece, such as [[Rembrandt]]'s ''[[The Night Watch (painting)|The Night Watch]]''.

Whistler used the term within the title of his works to represent paintings with a "dreamy, pensive mood" by applying a musical name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dia.org/exhibitions/whistlersite/8.htm |title=Tonalism and the "Nocturne  |publisher=Detroit Institute of Arts |date= |accessdate=2012-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also titled (and retitled) works using other terms associated with music, such as a "symphony", "harmony", "study" or "arrangement", to emphasize the tonal qualities and the composition and to de-emphasize the narrative content.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Ronald and Anne Koval. (2002). ''James McNeill Whistler: Beyond the Myth.'' De Capo Press. p. 186. {{ISBN|0-786-71032-2}}. (''Note: need to verify this was the edition used.'')&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the term "nocturne" can be associated with the [[Tonalism]] movement of the American of the late 19th century and early 20th century which is "characterized by soft, diffused light, muted tones and hazy outlined objects, all of which imbue the works with a strong sense of mood."&lt;ref&gt;[[Joan Marter|Marter, Joan]]. (2011). ''The Grove Encyclopedia of American Art, Volume 1'' Oxford University Press. p. 54. {{ISBN|0195335791}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with winter scenes, nocturnes were a common Tonalist theme.&lt;ref&gt;Conrads, Margaret C.

Hudson Hills. p. 148. {{ISBN|1555950507}}.&lt;/ref&gt;[[Frederic Remington]] used the term as well for his nocturne scenes of the [[American Old West]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov/feature/remington/remington08.shtm |title=Artistic experiments |publisher=National Gallery of Art |date= |accessdate=2012-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov/feature/remington/remington09.shtm |title=18 images of Remington’s nocturnes on 18 web pages |publisher=National Gallery of Art |date= |accessdate=2012-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rembrandt’s nocturnes==
In northern [[Europe]], the [[Dutch Golden Age]] produced one of the greatest artists of all time. The first artist to paint scenes on a regular basis in the nocturne mode was [[Rembrandt van Rijn]] (1606–1669). Many of his portraits were also painted using a nocturne method. As in ''The Mill'' (1645), most of his landscapes were painted to evoke a sense of the nocturne, which could be expressed in either a calm or stormy manner.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2006/feb/11/art|title=The Enduring Genius of Rembrandt|author=[[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]]|date=11 February 2006|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Remington painted many of his nocturnes in the last years of his life, when he was transitioning from a career as an [[illustrator]] to that of a fine artist and had chosen [[American Impressionism|Impressionism]] as the style in which he worked at the time. One example of his work is [http://agweb.okstate.edu/fourh/aitc/images/agart/stampede.jpg ''The Stampede'' (also known as ''The Stampede by Lightning'', 1908).]

The '''OpenStreetMap Foundation''' is a [[company limited by guarantee]], registered in England and Wales on 22 August 2006.&lt;ref name=companieshouse /&gt;

It is a [[Foundation (non-profit)|non-profit foundation]] whose aim is to support and enable the development of freely-reusable geospatial data. As its name suggests, it is closely connected with the [[OpenStreetMap]] project, although its constitution does not prevent it supporting other projects.

== Structure ==
OSMF is a [[membership organisation]], with all members entitled to vote at a general meeting on foundation activities. OSMF members do not determine how OpenStreetMap itself operates, only the foundation.{{clarify|reason=It can be interpreted in two opposite meanings.|date=June 2018}} Membership is open to all on payment of the membership fee of £15 per year. {{Asof|2015|12}}, there were 701 members.&lt;ref name=membership /&gt;

The foundation is funded by a combination of membership fees and specific larger donations. Notably [[MapQuest]] donated $50,000 to the foundation in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Coast|first=Hurricane|title=Donation to OSMF by MapQuest/AOL|url=http://blog.osmfoundation.org/2011/01/26/donation-to-osmf-by-mapquestaol/|accessdate=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Esri]] donated an undisclosed amount in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Donation from Esri|url=http://blog.osmfoundation.org/2012/03/19/esri-donation/|accessdate=14 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since September 2013, the foundation accepted corporate memberships in a "associated member" (non-voting) category. Founding corporate members are Geofabrik, [[Geotab]], [[Naver]], NextGIS and [[Mapbox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Corporate Members|url=http://www.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Corporate_Members|accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation is run by a board of seven members, including the foundation's officers: chairman, secretary and treasurer.&lt;ref name=board /&gt;

In December 2015, the current board was announced:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Officers &amp; Board|url=https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Officers_%26_Board}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Portrait of Daniele Barbaro''''' ({{circa|1565–67}}) is a painting by the Italian Renaissance master [[Paolo Veronese]] in the [[Rijksmuseum Amsterdam]].
[[Daniele Barbaro]] was a member of the Venetian aristocracy (see [[Barbaro family]]).  He was an important prelate, humanist and architectural theorist, who commissioned a number of works from Veronese. Veronese had been involved directly with Barbaro and his brother [[Marcantonio Barbaro]], decorating the [[Villa Barbaro]], [[Maser]], which Palladio designed.

Barbaro, who was [[Patriarch of Aquileia]], is dressed as a bishop.  He was also a cardinal and is sitting in the ''audience'' posture (reserved normally for Popes and cardinals).

The book standing up is the ''La Practica della Perspettiva'', Barbaro's treatise on artistic perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20130508084244/http://www.zen-it.com/mason/studi/Rituale.htm ''Il Rituale…''] article by Maurizio Nicosia&lt;/ref&gt;  The other volume on the table is Barbaro's "Commentary" on [[Vitruvius]]' ''[[De architectura]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/collection/SK-A-4011 Rijksmuseum] Accessed December 2008 (when this source referred to the painting being in [[London]] on loan from the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam).&lt;/ref&gt; which has illustrations by [[Andrea Palladio]].
Barbaro's Commentary on Vitruvius was published in Italian in 1556, but the portrait may be linked to the publication of a second edition in Latin in the 1560s.

==Related works==
===Two portraits reunited===
Barbaro was also portrayed by [[Titian]] around 1545 in two versions in the [[Museo del Prado]] and the [[National Gallery of Canada]].
To commemorate the 500th anniversary of his birth, two portraits of Daniel Barbaro were brought together for a Venice exhibition in 2015, the painting by Titian from the Museo del Prado, and this painting from the Rijksmuseum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cini.it/en/events/portraits-of-daniele-barbaro-by-titian-and-veronese-at-the-palazzo-cini Portraits of Daniele Barbaro by Titian and Veronese at the Palazzo Cini] on [[Palazzo Cini]] website&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portrait in the Pitti Palace===
There is a portrait by Veronese in the [[Pitti Palace]], Florence, which has been described as Barbaro dressed as a Venetian aristocrat, but this identification is not certain.

A '''property designer''' or '''prop designer''' is a person who designs [[theatrical property|props]] for use in theatre, film, television, etc. Prop designers work in liaison with the [[costume designer]]s, [[set designer]]s and [[sound designer]]s, under the direction of the [[art director]] or [[technical director]].

However, the public seems to associate the term with home designer, or an [[interior designer]], a person who is considered a professional in the field of interior design or one who designs interiors as part of their job.

'''American Regionalism''' is an [[United States|American]] [[Realism (arts)|realist]] [[Modern art|modern]] [[art movement]] that included paintings, murals, lithographs, and illustrations depicting realistic scenes of rural and small-town America primarily in the [[Midwest]] and [[Deep South]]. It arose in the 1930s as a response to the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], and ended in the 1940s due to the end of [[World War II]] and a lack of development within the movement. It reached its height of popularity from 1930 to 1935, as it was widely appreciated for its reassuring images of the American heartland during the Great Depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/opr/t4/e1431 |title=Regionalism |website=Oxford Art Online |access-date=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite major stylistic differences between specific artists, Regionalist art in general was in a relatively conservative and traditionalist style that appealed to popular American sensibilities, while strictly opposing the perceived domination of French art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/opr/t118/e2190 |title=Regionalism |website=The Oxford Companion to Western Art |access-date=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rise==
Before World War II, the concept of [[Modernism]] was not clearly defined in the context of [[Visual art of the United States|American art]]. There was also a struggle to define a uniquely American type of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Great American Think |last=Corn |first=Wanda |publisher=University of California Press |year=1999 |isbn=9780520231993 |location= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the path to determining what American art would be, some American artists rejected the modern trends emanating from the [[Armory Show]] and European influences particularly from the [[School of Paris]]. By rejecting European [[abstract art|abstract]] styles, American artists chose to adopt [[Academic art|academic]] [[Realism (arts)|realism]], which depicted American urban and rural scenes. Partly due to the Great Depression, Regionalism became one of the dominant art movements in America in the 1930s, the other being [[Social Realism]]. At the time, the United States was still a heavily agricultural nation, with a much smaller portion of its population living in industrial cities such as [[New York City]] or [[Chicago]].

== American Scene Painting ==
American Scene Painting is an umbrella term for American Regionalism and [[Social realism|Social Realism]] otherwise known as Urban Realism. Much of American Scene Painting conveys a sense of [[nationalism]] and [[romanticism]] in depictions of everyday American life. This sense of nationalism stemmed from artists' rejection of modern art trends after [[World War I]] and the Armory Show. During the 1930s, these artists documented and depicted American cities, small towns, and rural landscapes; some did so as a way to return to a simpler time away from industrialization, whereas others sought to make a political statement and lent their art to revolutionary and radical causes. The works which stress local and small-town themes are often called "American Regionalism", and those depicting urban scenes, with political and social consciousness are called [[Social realism|"Social Realism]]".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/americanscene/ |title=American Scene Painting - American Regoionalism and Social Realism |website=www.arthistoryarchive.com |access-date=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The American Scene: American Painting of the 1930s |last=Baigell |first=Matthew |publisher=Praeger |year=1974 |isbn=0-275-46620-5 |location=New York |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The version that developed in California is known as [[California Scene Painting]].

== Regionalist Triumvirate ==
American Regionalism is best known through its "Regionalist Triumvirate" consisting of the three most highly respected artists of America's Great Depression era: [[Grant Wood]], [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]], and [[John Steuart Curry]]. All three studied art in Paris, but devoted their lives to creating a truly American form of art. They believed that the solution to urban problems in American life and the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] was for the United States to return to its rural, agricultural roots.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== [[Grant Wood]] ===
Wood, from [[Anamosa, Iowa]], is best known for his painting ''[[American Gothic]]''. He also wrote a notable pamphlet titled ''Revolt Against the City,'' published in [[Iowa City]] in 1935, in which he asserted that American artists and buyers of art were no longer looking to [[Paris]]ian culture for subject matter and style. Wood wrote that Regional artists interpret the [[physiography]], industry, and psychology of their hometown and that the competition of these preceding elements create American culture. He wrote that the lure of the city was gone, and hoped that part of the widely diffused "whole people" would prevail. He cited [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s characterization of cities as "ulcers on the body politic."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Revolt Against the City |last=Wood |first=Grant |publisher=Clio Press |year=1935 |isbn= |location=Iowa City |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] ===

Benton was a painter, illustrator, and lithographer from [[Neosho, Missouri]], who became widely known for his murals. His subject matter mostly focused on [[working-class]] America, while incorporating social criticism. He heavily denounced European modern art despite the fact that he was regarded as a modernist and an abstractionist. When Regionalism lost its popularity in America, Benton got a job as a teacher at the [[Kansas City Art Institute]], where he became a teacher and lifelong father figure for [[Jackson Pollock]]. Benton wrote two autobiographies, his first one titled ''An Artist in America'', which described his travels in the United States, and his second, ''An American in Art'', which described his technical development as an artist. Along with being a painter, he was a talented [[folk music]]ian, and released a record called ''Saturday Night at Tom Benton's''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T007989 |title=Benton, Thomas Hart |website=Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. |access-date=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[John Steuart Curry]] ===
[[File:31.159_curry_imageprimacy_800-676x548.jpg|thumb|[[John Steuart Curry]], ''[[Baptism in Kansas]]'', 1928, [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], New York City, NY]]
Curry, from [[Dunavant, Kansas]], began as an illustrator of "[[Wild West]]" stories, but after more training, he was hired to paint murals for the Department of Justice and the Department of Interior under the Federal Arts Patronage in the [[New Deal]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T020707 |title=Curry, John Steuart |website=Oxford Art Online |access-date=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had a histrionic, anecdotal style, and believed that art should come from everyday life and that artists should paint what they love. In his case he painted his beloved home in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/opr/t118/e663 |title=Curry, John Steuart |website=The Oxford Companion to Western Art |access-date=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wood wrote about Curry's style and subject matter of art, stating "It was action he loved most to interpret: the lunge through space, the split second before the kill, the suspended moment before the storm strikes."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/60510|title=Hogs Killing a Snake {{!}} The Art Institute of Chicago|website=www.artic.edu|access-date=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== American Modernism ==
A debate over who and what would define American art as Modernism began with the 1913 [[Armory Show]] in New York between abstraction and realism. The debate then evolved in the 1930s into the three camps, Regionalism, [[Social realism|Social Realism]], and [[abstract art]]. By the 1940s, Regionalism and [[Social realism|Social Realism]] were placed on the same side of the debate as American Scene Painting, leaving only two camps, that were divided geographically and politically. American Scene Painting was promoted by conservative, anti-Modernist critics such as [[Thomas Craven]], who saw it as a way to defeat the influence of [[Abstract art|abstraction]] arriving from Europe. American Scene painters primarily lived in rural areas and created works that were realistic and addressed social, economic and political issues. On the other side of the debate were the abstract artists who primarily lived in New York City and were promoted by pro-[[Modernist]] critics, writers and artists such as [[Alfred Stieglitz]].

==Decline==
When World War II ended, Regionalism and Social Realism lost status in the art world. The end of World War II ushered in a new era of peace and prosperity, and the [[Cold War]] brought a change in the political perception of Americans and allowed Modernist critics to gain power. Regionalism and Social Realism also lost popularity among American viewers due to a lack of development within the movement due to the tight constraints of the art to agrarian subject matter. Ultimately, this led to [[abstract expressionism]] winning out the title of American Modernism, and becoming the new prominent and popular artistic movement.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.siouxcityartcenter.org/collections/category/regionalism.html |title=Collections |website=www.siouxcityartcenter.org |access-date=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regionalism limited the spread of abstract art to the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], which allowed American art to gain confidence in itself instead of relying on European styles.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/history-of-art/regionalism.htm |title=Regionalism: Mid-West American Scene Painting |website=www.visual-arts-cork.com |access-date=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; With American art fully established, Regionalism then was able to bridge the gap between [[abstract art]] and [[Academic art|academic realism]] similarly to how the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]] bridged a gap for the [[Post-Impressionist]]s, like [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Vincent van Gogh]], and [[Paul Gauguin]], in [[France]] a generation earlier. Despite the fact that Regionalism developed with the intent of replacing European abstraction with authentic American realism, it became the bridge for American [[Abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionism]], led by Benton's pupil [[Jackson Pollock]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Pollock's power as an artist was mostly due to the encouragement and influence of Thomas Hart Benton.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==Influence==
[[File:THUMBNAIL001L.jpg|thumb|[[John Steuart Curry]], ''Tragic Prelude'', 1938-1940, [[Kansas State Capitol]], [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]]]]
[[Norman Rockwell]] and [[Andrew Wyeth]] were the primary successors to Regionalism's natural realism. Rockwell became widely popular with his illustrations of the American family in magazines. Wyeth on the other hand painted ''[[Christina's World]],'' which competes with Wood's ''[[American Gothic]]'' for the title of America's favorite painting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Regionalism has had a strong and lasting influence on popular culture, particularly in America. It has given America some of its most iconic pieces of art that symbolize the country. Regionalist-type imagery influenced many American children's book illustrators such as [[Holling Clancy Holling]], and still shows up in advertisements, movies, and novels today. Works like ''[[American Gothic]]'' are commonly parodied around the world. Even John Steuart Curry's mural, ''Tragic Prelude'', which is painted on a wall at the [[Kansas State Capitol]], was featured on the cover of American [[progressive rock]] band [[Kansas (band)|Kansas]]' debut album titled [[Kansas (Kansas album)|''Kansas'']] .&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.kshs.org/p/kansas-state-capitol-online-tour-tragic-prelude/16595 |title=Kansas State Capitol - Online tour - Tragic Prelude - Kansas Historical Society |website=www.kshs.org |access-date=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable paintings ==
* ''[[American Gothic]]'' painted by Grant Wood in 1930, now on display at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]]. He found inspiration in a [[Carpenter Gothic]]-style farm house in [[Eldon, Iowa]], and used his dentist and sister as models for the people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/6565 |title=American Gothic {{!}} The Art Institute of Chicago |website=www.artic.edu |access-date=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now commonly thought of as America's favorite painting, and is deeply rooted in American popular culture.
* ''America Today,'' Thomas Hart Benton's most notable mural painted in 1930-1931 for New York's [[New School for Social Research]]. This ten-panel mural celebrates rural and urban life of the 1920s, while alluding to race relations, social values, and the oncoming economic distress during the Great Depression. It is now on display at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/press/exhibitions/2014/thomas-hart-benton-america-today |title=Thomas Hart Benton's America Today Mural Rediscovered {{!}} The Metropolitan Museum of Art |website=www.metmuseum.org |access-date=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''The Social History of the State of Missouri,'' a 13-panel mural painted by Thomas Hart Benton in 1936 depicting the history of [[Missouri]] and the activity and progress of Missouri's cities, while also addressing racial issues.

A '''rhyme''' is a repetition of similar sounds (usually, the exact same sound) in the final stressed syllables (and any following syllables) of two or more words. Most often, this kind of "perfect" rhyming is consciously used for effect in the final positions of [[Line (poetry)|lines]] of [[poem]]s and [[song]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rhyme|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/rhyme}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less strictly speaking, a rhyme may also variously refer to other types of similar sounds near the ends of two or more words. Furthermore, the word ''rhyme'' has come to be sometimes used as a [[pars pro toto|shorthand term]] for any brief poem, such as a [[rhyming couplet]] or [[nursery rhyme]].

==Etymology==

The word derives from [[Old French]] ''rime'' or ''ryme'', which may be derived from [[Old Frankish language|Old Frankish]] ''*rīm'', a Germanic term meaning "series, sequence" attested in Old English (Old English ''rīm'' meaning "enumeration, series, numeral") and Old High German ''rīm'', ultimately cognate to Old Irish ''rím'', [[Greek language|Greek]] ''{{lang|grc|ἀριθμός}}'' ''arithmos'' "number". Alternatively, the Old French words may derive from [[Latin]] ''rhythmus'', from Greek ''{{lang|grc|ῥυθμός}}'' (''rhythmos'', [[rhythm]]).&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{cite book | title = rhyme, n. | work = OED Online | date = March 2013 | publisher = Oxford University Press | url = http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/165361?rskey=SsEOXt&amp;result=1&amp;isAdvanced=false | accessdate = 2013-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Harper | first = Douglas | title = Online Etymology Dictionary | year = 2000–2012 | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=rhyme&amp;searchmode=none | accessdate = 2013-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spelling ''rhyme'' (from original ''rime'') was introduced at the beginning of the Modern English period from a learned (but perhaps etymologically incorrect) association with Latin ''rhythmus''.&lt;ref name=OED/&gt; The older spelling ''rime'' survives in Modern English as a rare alternative spelling; cf. ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]''. A distinction between the spellings is also sometimes made in the study of [[linguistics]] and [[phonology]] for which ''rime/rhyme'' is used to refer to the [[Syllable nucleus|nucleus]] and [[Syllable coda|coda]] of a [[syllable]]. Some prefer to spell it ''rime'' to separate it from the poetic rhyme covered by this article (see [[syllable rime]]).

==Function of rhyming words==
Rhyme partly seems to be enjoyed simply as a repeating pattern that is pleasant to hear. It also serves as a powerful [[mnemonic]] device, facilitating memorization. The regular use of [[Rhyme#Classification by position|tail rhyme]] helps to mark off the ends of lines, thus clarifying the metrical structure for the listener. As with other poetic techniques, poets use it to suit their own purposes; for example [[William Shakespeare]] often used a rhyming [[couplet]] to mark off the end of a scene in a play.

==Types of rhyme==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2012}}

The word ''rhyme'' can be used in a specific and a general sense. In the specific sense, two words rhyme if their final stressed vowel and all following sounds are identical; two lines of poetry rhyme if their final strong positions are filled with rhyming words. A rhyme in the strict sense is also called a [[perfect rhyme]]. Examples are ''sight'' and ''flight'', ''deign'' and ''gain'', ''madness'' and ''sadness''.

===Perfect rhymes===
{{main article|Perfect rhyme}}

Perfect rhymes can be classified according to the number of syllables included in the rhyme, which is dictated by the location of the final stressed syllable.

* '''single''', also known as [[masculine rhyme|masculine]]: a rhyme in which the stress is on the final syllable of the words (''rhyme'', ''sublime'')
* '''double''', also known as [[Feminine rhyme|feminine]]: a rhyme in which the stress is on the penultimate (second from last) syllable of the words (''picky'', ''tricky'')
* '''[[Dactyl (poetry)|dactylic]]:''' a rhyme in which the stress is on the antepenultimate (third from last) syllable (''cacophonies'', ''Aristophanes'')

===General rhymes===
In the general sense, ''general rhyme'' can refer to various kinds of phonetic similarity between words, and to the use of such similar-sounding words in organizing verse. Rhymes in this general sense are classified according to the degree and manner of the phonetic similarity:

* '''[[syllable rhyme|syllabic]]:''' a rhyme in which the last syllable of each word sounds the same but does not necessarily contain stressed vowels. (''cleaver'', ''silver'', or ''pitter'', ''patter''; the final syllable of the words ''bottle'' and ''fiddle'' are {{IPA|/l/}}, a [[liquid consonant]].)
* '''imperfect (or near):''' a rhyme between a stressed and an unstressed syllable. (''wing'', ''caring'')
* '''weak (or unaccented):''' a rhyme between two sets of one or more unstressed syllables. (''hammer'', ''carpenter'')
* '''semirhyme:''' a rhyme with an extra syllable on one word. (''bend'', ''ending'')
* '''forced (or oblique):''' a rhyme with an imperfect match in sound. (''green'', ''fiend''; ''one'', ''thumb'')
* '''[[assonance]]:''' matching vowels. (''sh'''a'''ke'', ''h'''a'''te'') Assonance is sometimes referred to as slant rhymes, along with consonance.
* '''[[literary consonance|consonance]]:''' matching consonants. ('''''r'''a'''b'''ie'''s''', '''r'''o'''bb'''er'''s''''')
*'''[[half rhyme]]''' (or '''slant rhyme'''): matching final consonants. (''Roxie'''', ''Lexie''''')
* '''[[pararhyme]]:''' all consonants match. (''tell'', ''tall'')
* '''[[alliteration]]''' (or '''head rhyme'''): matching initial consonants. ('''''sh'''ip'', '''''sh'''ort'')

===Identical rhymes===
Identical rhymes are considered less than perfect in English poetry; but are valued more highly in other literatures such as, for example, ''[[rime riche]]'' in French poetry.

Though [[homophone]]s and [[homonym]]s satisfy the first condition for rhyming—that is, that the stressed vowel sound is the same—they do not satisfy the second: that the preceding consonant be different. As stated above, in a perfect rhyme the last stressed vowel and all following sounds are identical in both words.

If the sound preceding the stressed vowel is also identical, the rhyme is sometimes considered to be inferior and not a perfect rhyme after all.&lt;ref name="myclasses"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://myclasses.net/smiser/cwp/rhyme.html|title=Rhyme, which cites ''Whitfield's University Rhyming Dictionary'', 1951 |publisher=myclasses.net|accessdate=2015-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="michael-thomas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michael-thomas.com/music/songwriting/rhyming.htm|title=Rhyming and Songwriting|publisher=michael-thomas.com|accessdate=2015-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of such a ''super-rhyme'' or "more than perfect rhyme" is the ''identical rhyme'', in which not only the vowels but also the onsets of the rhyming syllables are identical, as in ''gun'' and ''begun''. Punning rhymes, such as ''bare'' and ''bear'' are also identical rhymes. The rhyme may extend even farther back than the last stressed vowel. If it extends all the way to the beginning of the line, so that there are two lines that sound identical, it is called a ''[[holorhyme]]'' ("For I scream/For ice cream").

In poetics these would be considered ''identity'', rather than rhyme.

===Eye rhyme===
{{main article|Eye rhyme}}
Eye rhymes or sight rhymes or spelling rhymes refer to similarity in spelling but not in sound where the final sounds are spelled identically but pronounced differently.&lt;ref name=Stillman /&gt;  Examples in English are ''cough'', ''bough'', and ''love'', ''move''.

Some early written poetry appears to contain these, but in many cases the words used rhymed at the time of writing, and subsequent changes in pronunciation have meant that the rhyme is now lost.

===Mind rhyme===
{{main article|Mind rhyme}}
Mind rhyme is a kind of substitution rhyme similar to [[rhyming slang]], but it is less generally codified and is “heard” only when generated by a specific verse context. For instance, “this sugar is neat / and tastes so sour.” If a reader or listener thinks of the word “sweet” instead of “sour,”  a mind rhyme has occurred.

===Classification by position===
Rhymes may be classified according to their position in the verse:
*'''Tail rhyme''' (also called '''end rhyme''' or '''rime couée''') is a rhyme in the final syllable(s) of a verse (the most common kind).
*'''[[Internal rhyme]]''' occurs when a word or phrase in the interior of a line rhymes with a word or phrase at the end of a line, or within a different line.
*'''[[Off-centered rhyme]]''' is a type of internal rhyme occurring in unexpected places in a given line. This is sometimes called a misplaced-rhyme scheme or a [[spoken word]] rhyme style.
*'''[[Holorime]]''', mentioned above, occurs when two entire lines have the same sound.
*'''[[Broken rhyme]]''' is a type of [[enjambement]] producing a rhyme by dividing a word at the line break of a poem to make a rhyme with the end word of another line.
*'''Cross rhyme''' matches a sound or sounds at the end of a line with the same sound or sounds in the middle of the following (or preceding) line.&lt;ref name=Stillman /&gt;

A [[rhyme scheme]] is the pattern of rhyming lines in a poem.

==History==
In many languages, including modern European languages and Arabic, poets use rhyme in set patterns as a structural element for specific poetic forms, such as [[ballad]]s, [[sonnet]]s and [[couplet|rhyming couplet]]s. Some rhyming schemes have become associated with a specific language, culture or period, while other rhyming schemes have achieved use across languages, cultures or time periods. However, the use of structural rhyme is not universal even within the European tradition. Much modern poetry avoids traditional [[rhyme scheme]]s.

The earliest surviving evidence of rhyming is the Chinese [[Shi Jing]] (ca. 10th century BC). Rhyme is also occasionally used in the [[Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=6wSWpZmmlAoC&amp;pg=PA236&amp;lpg=PA236&amp;dq=ugaritic+poetry+rhyme&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8i7tZjxiF6&amp;sig=F918VtPZEKIZ7r4ffu7lDRbrH6k&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=37ReTdeKLJKs8QOespxa&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=rhyme&amp;f=false Old Testament survey: the message, form, and background of the Old Testament pg. 236]"&lt;/ref&gt; Classical Greek and Latin poetry did not usually rhyme,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wesling|first=Donald|title=The chances of rhyme|year=1980|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-03861-5|pages=x–xi, 38–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; but rhyme was used very occasionally. For instance, Catullus includes partial rhymes in the poem ''[[Catullus 1|Cui dono lepidum novum libellum]]''.&lt;ref name="prosentient"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prosentient.com.au/balnaves/johnbalnaves/dissch6c.asp|title=Bernard of Morlaix - METRE AND RHYME|publisher=prosentient.com.au|accessdate=2015-08-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304031628/http://www.prosentient.com.au/balnaves/johnbalnaves/dissch6c.asp|archive-date=2016-03-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Greeks knew rhyme, and rhymes in ''[[The Wasps]]'' by [[Aristophanes]] are noted by a translator.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Aristophanes, 2: Wasps, Lysistrata, Frogs, The Sexual Congress|author1=Aristophanes|author2=Slavitt, D.R.|author3=Bovie, S.P.|date=1999|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press, Incorporated|isbn=9780812216844|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WHmfT2s4mLgC&amp;pg=PA4|page=4|accessdate=2015-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some archaic sources, [[Early Irish literature|Irish literature]] introduced the rhyme to Early Medieval Europe, but that is a disputed claim.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08116a.htm Article about early Irish literature by Prof. Douglas Hyde in The Catholic Encyclopedia]"&lt;/ref&gt; In the 7th century, the Irish had brought the art of rhyming verses to a high pitch of perfection. Also in the 7th century, rhyme was used in the [[Qur'an]]. The [[leonine verse]] is notable for introducing rhyme into High Medieval literature in the 12th century.

Rhyme entered European poetry in the [[High Middle Ages]], in part under the influence of the [[Arabic language]] in [[Al Andalus]] (modern Spain).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=88|author=Menocal, Maria Rosa|title=The Arabic Role in Medieval Literary History|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|year=2003|isbn=0-8122-1324-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arabic language poets used rhyme extensively from the first development of literary Arabic in the [[6th century in poetry|sixth century]], as in their long, rhyming [[qasida]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor= Sperl, Stefan|title=Qasida poetry in Islamic Asia and Africa|year=1996|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-90-04-10387-0|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since languages change over time, lines that rhymed in the past may no longer rhyme in today's language, and it may not be clear how one would pronounce the words so that they rhyme:
:Rejoice, O Judah, and in songs divine
:With cherubim and seraphim harmonious join.
::from [[Handel]]'s ''[[Judas Maccabaeus (Handel)|Judas Maccabaeus]]'' (libretto by [[Thomas Morell]])
Although historically valid, "Should we really sing 'harmonious jine'?"&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Thomas Forest (2011). ''Early Music: A Very Short Introduction'', p.83. {{ISBN|978-0-19-973076-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhyme in various languages==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2016}}

===Celtic languages===
:''For Welsh, see [[cynghanedd]]''

Rhyming in the [[Celtic Languages]] takes a drastically different course from most other Western rhyming schemes despite strong contact with the Romance and English patterns. Even today, despite extensive interaction with English and French culture, Celtic rhyme continues to demonstrate native characteristics. Brian Ó Cuív sets out the rules of rhyme in Irish poetry of the classical period: the last stressed vowel and any subsequent long vowels must be identical in order for two words to rhyme. Consonants are grouped into six classes for the purpose of rhyme: they need not be identical, but must belong to the same class. Thus 'b' and 'd' can rhyme (both being 'voiced plosives'), as can 'bh' and 'l' (which are both 'voiced continuants') but 'l', a 'voiced continuant', cannot rhyme with 'ph', a 'voiceless continuant'. Furthermore, "for perfect rhyme a palatalized consonant may be balanced only by a palatalized consonant and a velarized consonant by a velarized one."&lt;ref&gt;Ó Cuív, Brian (1967). 'The Phonetic Basis of Classical Modern Irish Rhyme'. ''Ériu 20, pp. 96-97''&lt;/ref&gt; In the post-Classical period, these rules fell into desuetude, and in popular verse simple assonance often suffices, as can be seen in an example of Irish Gaelic rhyme from the traditional song ''Bríd Óg Ní Mháille'':
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|ga|Is a Bhríd Óg Ní Mháille}}
{{IPA-ga|is ə vrʲiːdʲ oːɡ nʲiː wɒːlʲə|}}
{{lang|ga|'S tú d'fhág mo chroí cráite}}
{{IPA-ga|stuː dɒːɡ mə xriː krɒːtʲə|}}
|
Oh young Bridget O'Malley

You have left my heart breaking}}

Here the vowels are the same, but the consonants, although both palatalized, do not fall into the same class in the bardic rhyming scheme.

===Chinese===
{{Further|Rime dictionary}}
Besides the vowel/consonant aspect of rhyming, [[Chinese language|Chinese]] rhymes often include [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]] quality (that is, [[Contour (linguistics)|tonal contour]]) as an integral linguistic factor in determining rhyme.

Use of rhyme in [[Classical Chinese poetry]] typically but not always appears in the form of paired couplets, with end-rhyming in the final syllable of each couplet.

Another important aspect of rhyme in regard to Chinese language studies is the study or reconstruction of past [[varieties of Chinese]], such as [[Middle Chinese]].

===English===
{{see also|English poetry}}
[[Old English poetry]] is mostly [[alliterative verse]]. One of the earliest rhyming poems in English is [[The Rhyming Poem]].

As [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] is important in English, lexical stress is one of the factors that affects the similarity of sounds for the perception of rhyme. Perfect rhyme can be defined as the case when two words rhyme if their final stressed vowel and all following sounds are identical.&lt;ref name=Stillman&gt;{{cite book|last=Stillman|first=Frances|title=The Poet's Manual and Rhyming Dictionary|year=1966|publisher=Thames and Hudson|isbn=0500270309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some words in English, such as "[[Orange (word)|orange]]" and "silver", are commonly regarded as having no rhyme. Although a clever writer can get around this (for example, by obliquely rhyming "orange" with combinations of words like "door hinge" or with &lt;!--POV: far-fetched--&gt; lesser-known words like "[[Blorenge]]" – a hill in Wales – or the surname [[Gorringe (disambiguation)|Gorringe]]), it is generally easier to move the word out of rhyming position or replace it with a [[synonym]] ("orange" could become "amber", while "silver" could become a combination of "bright and argent").

One view of rhyme in English is from [[John Milton]]'s preface to ''[[Paradise Lost]]'':
{{quote|The Measure is ''English'' Heroic  Verse without Rime, as that of ''Homer'' in ''Greek'', and of ''Virgil'' in ''Latin''; Rime being no necessary Adjunct or true Ornament of Poem or good Verse, in longer Works especially, but the Invention of a barbarous Age, to set off wretched matter and lame Meeter; grac't indeed since by the use of some famous modern Poets, carried away by Custom...&lt;!--carefully proofread --&gt;}}

A more tempered view is taken by [[W. H. Auden]] in [[The Dyer's Hand]]:
{{quote|Rhymes, meters, stanza forms, etc., are like servants. If the master is fair enough to win their affection and firm enough to command their respect, the result is an orderly happy household. If he is too tyrannical, they give notice; if he lacks authority, they become slovenly, impertinent, drunk and dishonest.}}

Forced or clumsy rhyme is often a key ingredient of [[doggerel]].

===French===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Meter (poetry)]] --&gt;

In [[French poetry]], unlike in English, it is common to have ''identical rhymes'', in which not only the vowels of the final syllables of the lines rhyme, but their onset consonants ("consonnes d'appui") as well. To the ear of someone accustomed to English verse, this often sounds like a very weak rhyme. For example, an English perfect rhyme of homophones, ''flour'' and ''flower'', would seem weak, whereas a French rhyme of homophones ''doigt'' and ''doit'' or ''point'' ("point") and ''point'' ("not") is not only acceptable but quite common.

Rhymes are sometimes classified into the categories "rime pauvre" ("poor rhyme"), "rime suffisante" ("sufficient rhyme"), "[[rime riche]]" ("rich rhyme") and "rime richissime" ("very rich rhyme"), according to the number of rhyming sounds in the two words or in the parts of the two verses. For example, to rhyme "tu" with "vu" would be a poor rhyme (the words have only the vowel in common), to rhyme "pas" with "bras" a sufficient rhyme (with the vowel and the silent consonant in common), and "tante" with "attente" a rich rhyme (with the vowel, the onset consonant, and the coda consonant with its mute "e" in common). Authorities disagree, however, on exactly where to place the boundaries between the categories.

''[[Holorime]]''  is an extreme example of ''rime richissime'' spanning an entire verse. [[Alphonse Allais]] was a notable exponent of holorime. Here is an example of a holorime couplet from [[Marc Monnier]]:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|fr|Gall, amant de la Reine, alla (tour magnanime)
Galamment de l'Arène à la Tour Magne, à Nîmes.}}
|
Gallus, the Queen's lover, went (a magnanimous gesture)
Gallantly from the Arena to the Great Tower, at Nîmes.}}

Classical French rhyme not only differs from English rhyme in its different treatment of onset consonants. It also treats coda consonants in a distinctive way.

French spelling includes several final letters that are no longer pronounced, and that in many cases have never been pronounced. Such final unpronounced letters continue to affect rhyme according to the rules of Classical French versification. They are encountered in almost all of the pre-20th-century French verse texts, but these rhyming rules are almost never taken into account from the 20th century.

The most important "silent" letter is the "[[Silent letter#Vowels|mute e]]". In spoken French today, final "e" is, in some regional accents (in Paris for example), omitted&lt;!--leads a kind of half-life: this is an abuse of the term "half-life"--&gt; after consonants; but in Classical French prosody, it was considered an integral part of the rhyme even when following the vowel. "Joue" could rhyme with "boue", but not with "trou". Rhyming words ending with this silent "e" were said to make up a "double rhyme", while words not ending with this silent "e" made up a "single rhyme". It was a principle of stanza-formation that single and double rhymes had to alternate in the stanza. Virtually all 17th-century French plays in verse alternate single and double [[alexandrine]] couplets.

The now-silent final consonants present a more complex case. They, too, were traditionally an integral part of the rhyme, such that "pont" rhymed with "vont" but not with "long"; but spelling and pronunciation did not coincide exactly—"pont" also rhymed with "rond". There are a few rules that govern most word-final consonants in archaic French pronunciation:
* The distinction between voiced and unvoiced consonants is lost in the final position. So "d" and "t" (both pronounced /t/) rhyme. So too with "g" and "c" (both /k/), "p" and "b" (both /p/), and "s", "x" and "z" (all /z/). Rhymes ending in /z/ are called "plural rhymes".
* Nasal vowels rhyme whether they are spelled with "m" or "n". ("Essaim" rhymes with "sain" but not with "saint" because of the final "t".)
* If a word ends in a stop followed by "s", the stop is silent (therefore "temps" rhymes with "dents"). In the archaic orthography some of these silent stops are omitted from the spelling as well (e.g. "dens" for "dents").

===Greek===
:''See [[Homoioteleuton]]'' rhyme

Ancient Greek poetry seldom if ever uses rhyme. Modern Greek poetry uses it extensively.

===Hebrew===
Ancient [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] rarely employed rhyme, e.g. in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 29 35: ועשית לאהרן ולבניו כָּכה, ככל אשר צויתי אֹתָכה (the identical part in both rhyming words being / 'axa/ ). Rhyme became a permanent - even obligatory - feature of poetry in Hebrew language, around the 4th century CE. It is found in the [[piyyut|Jewish liturgical poetry]] written in the [[Byzantine empire]] era. This was realized by scholars only recently, thanks to the thousands of [[piyyut|piyyuts]] that have been discovered in the [[Cairo Geniza]]. It is assumed that the principle of rhyme was transferred from Hebrew liturgical poetry to the poetry of the [[Syriac Christianity]] (written in [[Aramaic]]), and through this mediation introduced into [[Latin poetry]] and then into all other languages of [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt; See: Benjamin Harshav (Hrushovski)'s article on Hebrew Prosody in the [[Encyclopedia Judaica]]&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Latin===
In [[Latin]] rhetoric and poetry [[homeoteleuton]] and [[Alliteration (Latin)|alliteration]] were frequently used devices.

[[Rhyme#Classification by position|Tail rhyme]] was occasionally used, as in this piece of poetry by [[Cicero]]:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|la|O Fortu'''natam''' '''natam''' me consule '''Romam'''.}}
|
O fortunate Rome, to be born with me consul}}

But [[Rhyme#Classification by position|tail rhyme]] was not used as a prominent structural feature of [[Latin poetry]] until it was introduced under the influence of local vernacular traditions in the early [[Middle Ages]]. This is the [[Latin]] [[hymn]] ''[[Dies Irae]]'':
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|la|Dies irae, dies illa
Solvet saeclum in favilla
Teste David cum Sybilla}}
|
The day of wrath, that day
which will reduce the world to ashes,
as foretold by David and the Sybil.}}

[[Medieval poetry]] may mix Latin and [[vernacular]] languages. Mixing languages in verse or rhyming words in different languages is termed [[macaronic]].

===Portuguese===
[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] classifies rhymes in the following manner:

*'''rima pobre''' (poor rhyme): rhyme between words of the same [[grammatical category]] (e.g. noun with noun) or between very common endings (''-ão'', ''-ar'');
*'''rima rica''' (rich rhyme): rhyme between words of different grammatical classes or with uncommon endings;
*'''rima preciosa''' (precious rhyme): rhyme between words with a different [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], for example ''estrela'' (star) with ''vê-la'' (to see her);
*'''rima esdrúxula''' (odd rhyme): rhyme between [[Proparoxytone|proparoxytonic]] words (example: ''ânimo'', "animus", and ''unânimo'', "unanimous").

===Russian===
Rhyme was introduced into [[Russian language|Russian]] poetry in the 18th century. Folk poetry had generally been unrhymed, relying more on dactylic line endings for effect. Rhyme depends on a vowel and adjacent consonant (which may include the [[semivowel]] ''[[Short I]]''). Vowel pairs rhyme - even though non-Russian speakers may not perceive them as the same sound. Consonant pairs rhyme if both are devoiced. Early 18th century poetry demanded perfect rhymes that were also grammatical rhymes—namely that noun endings rhymed with noun endings, verb endings with verb endings, and so on. Such rhymes relying on morphological endings become much rarer in modern Russian poetry, and greater use is made of approximate rhymes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wachtel|first=Michael|title=The Cambridge Introduction to Russian Poetry|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780511206986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polish=== 
In Polish literature rhyme was used from the beginning. Unrhymed verse was never popular, although sometimes it was sometimes imitated form Latin. [[Homer]]'s, [[Virgil]]'s and even [[John Milton|Milton]]'s epic poems were furnished with rhymes by Polish translators.&lt;ref&gt;Wiktor Jarosław Darasz, Mały przewodnik po wierszu polskim, Kraków 2003, p. 19 (in Polish).&lt;/ref&gt; Because of paroxytonic accentuation in Polish, feminine rhymes always prevailed. Rules of Polish rhyme were established in 16th century. Then only feminine rhymes were allowed in syllabic verse system. Together with introducing syllabo-accentual metres, masculine rhymes began to occur in Polish poetry. They were most popular at the end of 19th century. The most frequent rhyme scheme in Old Polish (16th - 18th centuries) was couplet AABBCCDD..., but Polish poets, having perfect knowledge of Italian language and literature, experimented with other schemes, among others [[ottava rima]] (ABABABCC) and [[sonnet]] (ABBA ABBA CDC DCD or ABBA ABBA CDCD EE).
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|pl|Wpłynąłem na suchego przestwór oceanu,
Wóz nurza się w zieloność i jak łódka brodzi,
Śród fali łąk szumiących, śród kwiatów powodzi,
Omijam koralowe ostrowy burzanu.}}
|attr1=Adam Mickiewicz,&lt;br&gt;"{{lang|pl|Stepy akermańskie}}", ''{{lang|pl|Sonety krymskie}}'', lines 1-4
|
Across sea-meadows measureless I go,
My wagon sinking under grass so tall
The flowery petals in foam on me fall,
And blossom-isles float by I do not know.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sonnets.org/mickiewicz.htm#001 Adam Mickiewicz's Sonnets from the Crimea at Sonnet Central]&lt;/ref&gt;|attr2="The Ackerman Steppe", ''Sonnets from the Crimea'',&lt;br&gt;translated by [[Edna Worthley Underwood]]}}

The metre of Mickiewicz's sonnet is the [[Polish alexandrine]] (tridecasyllable, in Polish "trzynastozgłoskowiec"): 13(7+6) and its rhymes are feminine: [anu] and [odzi].

===Arabic===
Rhymes were widely spread in the [[Arabian peninsula]] around the 6th century, in letters, poems and songs, as well as long, rhyming qasidas &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor= Sperl, Stefan|title=Qasida poetry in Islamic Asia and Africa|year=1996|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-90-04-10387-0|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In addition, the Koran uses a form of rhymed prose named [[saj']].

===Sanskrit===
Patterns of rich rhyme (''prāsa'') play a role in modern Sanskrit poetry, but only to a minor extent in historical Sanskrit texts. They are classified according to their position within the ''pada'' (metrical foot): ''ādiprāsa'' (first syllable), ''dvitīyākṣara prāsa'' (second syllable), ''antyaprāsa'' (final syllable) etc.

===Tamil===
There are some unique rhyming schemes in Dravidian languages like Tamil. Specifically, the rhyme called ''etukai'' (anaphora) occurs on the second consonant of each line.

The other rhyme and related patterns are called ''mō&lt;u&gt;n&lt;/u&gt;ai'' ([[alliteration]]), ''toṭai'' ([[epistrophe|epiphora]]) and ''iraṭṭai kiḷavi'' ([[Parallelism (rhetoric)|parallelism]]).

Some classical Tamil poetry forms, such as ''veṇpā'', have rigid grammars for rhyme to the point that they could be expressed as a [[context-free grammar]].

===Vietnamese===
Rhymes are used in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] to produce similes. The following is an example of a Rhyming Simile:

'''Nghèo''' như con '''mèo'''
&lt;br&gt;/'''ŋɛu''' ɲɯ kɔn '''mɛu'''/ 
&lt;br&gt;"Poor as a cat"
&lt;br&gt;

Compare the above Vietnamese example, which is a ''rhyming'' simile, to the English phrase "(as) poor as a church mouse", which is only a ''semantic'' simile.&lt;ref&gt;See p. 98 in Thuy Nga Nguyen and [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]] (2012), "Stupid as a Coin: Meaning and Rhyming Similes in Vietnamese", ''International Journal of Language Studies'' 6 (4), pp. 97-118.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Longhurst''' is an American [[sculpture|sculptor]] who was born in [[Schenectady, New York]] in 1949. At an early age he was fascinated by his father’s small figurative woodcarvings.&lt;ref&gt;"Peckin' Wood." ''Forbes FYI'' Fall 1997: 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Longhurst received a Bachelor of Architecture from [[Kent State University]] in 1975.  He began his artistic career in 1976 in Cincinnati, Ohio.  His first commissioned works were three figurative sculptures in black walnut for Cincinnati businessman Joe David who owned Midwest Woodworking company.&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, Iona.  "Feature: Robert Longhurst." ''Wood Carving''  Sept./Oct. 2005: 29-31.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1978 Longhurst completed a life size figure in pine of an Adirondack hermit, [[Noah John Rondeau]] for the [[Adirondack Museum]] in [[Blue Mountain Lake, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;Gilborn, Alice.  "Reaching for Perfection." ''Adirondack Life''  Sept./Oct. 1983: 30-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Longhurst's career began with figurative works, it soon evolved into non-representational abstraction in exotic woods, marble and granite that draws on his background in Architecture.  Many of his pieces are defined as being at the intersection of where the fields of art and math overlap, and they have been discussed by Mathematicians such as Nathaniel Friedman, [[Reuben Hersh]], and [[Ivars Peterson]].&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Nathaniel.  "Robert Longhurst's Arabesque 29." ''Hyperseeing'' June 2006: 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=F2&gt;Friedman, Nathaniel.  "Robert Longhurst: Three Sculptures." ''Hyperseeing'' July 2007: 9-12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hersh&gt;Hersh, Reuben. ''What is Mathematics, Really?'' Oxford: University of Oxford Press, 1997.  {{ISBN|0-19-511368-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Peterson&gt;Peterson, Ivars. ''Fragments of Infinity: A Kaleidoscope of Math and Art.'' New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc, 2001.  {{ISBN|0-471-16558-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of his sculptures portray [[minimal surface]]s, which were named after German geometer [[Alfred Enneper]].&lt;ref name=Hersh/&gt;  Nathaniel Friedman writes, "The surfaces [of Longhurst's sculptures] generally have appealing sections with [[negative curvature]] ([[saddle surface]]s).  This is a natural intuitive result of Longhurst's feeling for satisfying shape rather than a mathematically deduced result."&lt;ref name=F2/&gt;

Longhurst participated in the International Snow Sculpture Championships in [[Breckenridge, Colorado]], in 2000 and 2001, by joining a snow sculpting team from Minnesota.  Two of his sculptures representing minimal surfaces were enlarged and carved from blocks of snow measuring 12' high x 10' wide x 10' deep.&lt;ref&gt;"Rhapsody in White: A Victory for Mathematics." ''The Mathematical Intelligencer''  Fall 2000: 37-40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"White Narcissus."

Robert Longhurst lives in [[Chestertown, New York]].

{{refimprove|date=September 2013}}
'''Scratch video''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[video art]] movement that emerged in the early to mid-1980s. It was characterised by the use of [[Found footage (appropriation)|found footage]], [[fast cutting]] and multi-layered rhythms. It is significant in that, as a form of [[outsider art]], it challenged many of the establishment assumptions of broadcast television - as well of those of gallery-bound video art.

Scratch Video arose in opposition to broadcast television, as (anti-)artists attempted to deal critically and directly with the impact of mass communications. The context these videos emerged in is important, as it tended to critique of the institutions making broadcast videos and the commercialism found on youth TV, especially [[MTV]]. This it did in form, content and in its mode of distribution.

Much of the work was politically radical, often containing images of a sexual or violent nature, and using images [[Appropriation art|appropriated]] from mainstream media, including corporate advertising; using strategies inspired by the [[Situationist International|Situationist]] concept of [[detournement]] and [[William S. Burroughs]]’ theories of [[The Electronic Revolution|Electronic Revolution]].

==Context==
The primary audience for scratch video in the early to mid-1980s, was in nightclub performances by industrial music bands such as [[The Anti-Group]], [[Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Cabaret Voltaire]], [[Nocturnal Emissions]], [[Psychic TV]], [[SPK (band)|SPK]], [[Test Dept]], and [[Autopsia]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}  Some of those involved described their work as a form of [[cultural terrorism]] or as a form of [[anti-art]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

In the mid-1980s typical London venues would be screenings at artist-run spaces such as the Ambulance Station, in independent cinemas such as the Brixton [[Ritzy Cinema]], or [[the Fridge]] nightclub, which boasted an array of dozens of recycled colour televisions.  There was also significant distribution on [[VHS]] tape, following similar networks to [[cassette culture]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

After Andy Lipman’s [[City Limits (magazine)|City Limits]] feature contextualised the art values of this practice, material began to be featured in small screenings in official art galleries such as the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts|ICA]] and [[Tate]].  Television stations, like [[Channel 4]] began late night screenings of art videos, including scratch video. However, because much of the material was constructed using domestic VHS equipment, it was deemed both technically and legally unsuitable for broadcast (for fear of breaching copyright law).  Being highly politicised, some of the material also broke with the broadcaster’s criteria of balance.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

==History==
''Scratch video'' is a rather catch-all category of work which derive from popular dance and music fashions and the cutting of found trash images with it. Its long history begins with the [[cubist]] collages of Picasso and Braque, the 'ready-mades' of [[Duchamp]], and passes through [[Joseph Cornell]], [[Bruce Conner]], [[Andy Warhol]] and William S. Burroughs and [[Anthony Balch]] [[cut-ups]]. The movement was influenced by the American video artist [[Dara Birnbaum]].&lt;ref&gt;Mick Hartney, Grove Art Online, reproduced on the Museum of Modern Art website:[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10215]&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking of the movements emergence and how  it got its name, [[Rik Lander]] (one half of the [[Duvet Brothers]]) has stated: 

{{quote|I can’t remember when we found out what we were doing was scratch or that we were part of a movement. Certainly when we saw the work of [[Kim Flitcroft]] and Sandra Goldbacher, [[George Barber (artist)|George Barber]] and Gorilla Tapes it was uncanny that so many people had been experimenting in the same area without knowing that the others existed. In my mind a journalist called [[Pat Sweeney]] came up with the name Scratch, but Scratch Video may have already existed as a named form in the US. [[Andy Lipman]] ran a [[City Limits (magazine)|City Limits]] cover story on Scratch Video in October 1984 where he tried to create the myth that Scratch was made by disaffected youth taping the [[TV]] and reediting it on [[VCRs]] at home. If anyone knew this was not the case it was Andy. He was one of the few people who had actually met all the people involved. [[Dessa Fox]] in the [[NME]] tried a similar hype when she suggested that Scratch Video was a televisual punk rock".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duvetbrothers.com/history.htm the duvet brothers - history&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Original scratch video works continue to be shown in major exhibitions around the world. Notable events, amongst others, being Gorilla Tapes' participation in the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts|ICA]]'s 2007 exhibition ''[https://www.ica.org.uk/whats-on/secret-public The Secret Public: The Last Days of the British Underground 1978-1988]'' and ''[http://www.seventeengallery.com/exhibitions/scratch/ SCRATCH!]'' a 2008 retrospective exhibition curated by [[Paul Pieroni]] at the Seventeen gallery in London.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4862">The '''Stern Conservatory''' (''Stern'sches Konservatorium'') was a private [[music school]] in [[Berlin]] with many notable tutors and alumni. Today the school is part of the [[Berlin University of the Arts]].

==History==
It was founded in 1850 as the ''Berliner Musikschule'' by [[Julius Stern]], [[Theodor Kullak]] and [[Adolf Bernhard Marx]]. Kullak withdrew from the conservatory in 1855 in order to create a new academy of sculpture and three-dimensional art. With Marx's withdrawal in 1856, the conservatory came exclusively under the Stern family and adopted its name. In 1894 it was taken over by Gustav Hollaender (the uncle of film composer [[Friedrich Hollaender]]), who moved the school's location to the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] concert hall on Bernburger Strasse in Berlin-[[Kreuzberg]].

In the course of the ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'' process, the Stern Academy in 1936 was renamed ''Konservatorium der Reichshauptstadt Berlin'' controlled by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]]. Gustav Hollaender's heirs were disseized, but for a few years they were able to run a "Jewish Private Music School Hollaender" until they were [[The Holocaust|deported and murdered]] in 1941.

After the end of the Second World War in 1945, the school was again renamed as the ''Städtisches Konservatorium'' (City Conservatory) in what was to become [[West Berlin]]. In 1966 it was merged with the public ''Akademische Hochschule für Musik'' into the ''Staatliche Hochschule für Musik und Darstellende Kunst'' (Berlin State School of Music and the Performing Arts), since 2001 the [[Berlin University of the Arts]].

The '''Symphony No. 2 in F minor''' was written by [[Richard Strauss]] between 1883 and 1884.  It is sometimes referred to as just '''Symphony in F minor'''. He gave it the [[Opus number]] 12, and it also appears in other catalogues as TrV 126 and Hanstein A.I.2. It is not listed in von Asow's catalog.

The [[symphony]], written for a standard orchestra consisting of 2 [[flute]]s, 2 [[oboe]]s, 2 [[clarinet]]s in B-flat, 2 [[bassoon]]s, 4 [[French horn|horn]]s in F, 2 [[trumpet]]s in F and C, 3 [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], and strings, was premiered by [[Theodore Thomas (conductor)|Theodore Thomas]] conducting the [[New York Philharmonic]] on December 13, 1884.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (1976), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The European premiere, with Strauss himself conducting, took place in October 1885 (on the same night he was the soloist in [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s [[Piano Concerto No. 24 (Mozart)|Piano Concerto No. 24]], K. 491, with his own cadenza).&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (1999), p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (1976), p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; In 1887 he played it again with the [[Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra]].&lt;ref&gt;Schuh (1982), p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; The work has been performed only once at the BBC Proms, in the 1905 season on 1 September at the Queen's Hall with [[Henry Wood]] conducting the New Queens Hall Orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/events/errdgw BBC Proms archive, 1905 Prom 12]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The symphony is in the usual four movements, though the scherzo and slow movement are switched from their usual positions, as in Beethoven's [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 9]]:

# Allegro ma non troppo, un poco maestoso, [[F minor]], 2/4
# Scherzo: Presto, [[A-flat major]], 3/4 with Trio in [[C minor]]
# Andante cantabile, [[C major]], 3/8
# Finale: Allegro assai, molto appassionato, F minor switching to [[F major]], [[cut time]]

The first movement is a [[sonata form]] allegro with three themes.  The ways Strauss develops his material in this symphony owes much to Beethoven's middle period music, in particular "the slow movement of the [[Symphony No. 7 (Beethoven)|Seventh Symphony]] (in the chromatically inflected stepwise descent at mm. 139—43 of the first movement), the development of the ''[[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Eroica]]'', first movement (repeated tutti pounding of a single dissonance, in movement one, mm. 193—99), and the ''Egmont Overture'', this time in the same key (intensification through repetition of rising motive over dominant harmony, in movement four, mm. 346—49)."&lt;ref&gt;Youmans (2005), p. 236&lt;/ref&gt;  The recapitulation section is unusual because it modulates to [[A-flat major]] for the second subject group rather than staying in tonic or going to the parallel major.

The scherzo was successful and had to be repeated both times Strauss conducted the symphony in Milan in 1887.&lt;ref&gt;Jefferson (1975), p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

A transitional brass motif from the first movement intrudes in the lyricism of the slow movement.

The main theme of the fourth movement is "an agitated low-string melody rising beneath tremolo and sounding very much like [[Anton Bruckner|Bruckner]]."&lt;ref&gt;Youmans (2005), p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; Near the end, about halfway between [[rehearsal letter]]s T and U, Strauss recalls themes from the previous three movements, though the Andante is recalled second and the Scherzo third. Bruckner's [[Symphony No. 3 (Bruckner)|Symphony No. 3]], in its 1873 version, also recalls themes from the previous movements in the finale at an analogous point.&lt;ref&gt;Nowak (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johannes Brahms]]'s initial reaction to the piece was two words: "ganz hübsch"&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (1999), p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; ("quite nice"). Later he elaborated his advice, encouraging Strauss to "take a good look at Schubert's dances," to guard against "thematic irrelevances," and that there "is no point in this piling up of many themes which are only contrasted rhythmically on a single triad."&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (1976), p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; [[Béla Bartók]]'s [[Concerto for Orchestra (Bartók)|Concerto for Orchestra]] contains "an interesting resemblance between a canon for trumpets and horns in three pairs a quaver apart in the slow movement and the canon for brass in the first movement,"&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (1976), p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; something which was first noticed by Theodore Bloomfield.&lt;ref&gt;Bloomfield (1974), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Strauss's musical style moved on from his second symphony, he did occasionally program it later in his life, for example conducting it on 28 February 1899 in Heidelberg, and again on 29 January 1903 with the [[Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra]] in Amsterdam.&lt;ref&gt;Trenner, pages 178 and 233.&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 November 1935, he also made a radio broadcast with the [[Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra (East Berlin)|Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra]].&lt;ref&gt;Trenner, page 566&lt;/ref&gt; Strauss recorded some of his own compositions, but this symphony was not among them and the 1935 radio broadcast recording is currently lost. The few conductors to record this symphony are [[Michael Halasz]], [[Neeme Järvi]], [[Karl Anton Rickenbacher]], [[Hiroshi Wakasugi]] and [[Sebastian Weigle]]. A version for [[piano duet]] has also been recorded.

[[File:Igor Stravinsky, Roger Baulu, Jean-Marie Beaudet 1945.jpg|thumb|Stravinsky (left), Roger Baulu, and [[Jean-Marie Beaudet]] at Radio-Canada, Montreal, 4 March 1945]]
The '''Symphony in Three Movements''' is a work by Russian expatriate composer [[Igor Stravinsky]].  Stravinsky wrote the symphony from 1942–45 on commission by the [[Philharmonic Symphony Society of New York]].  It was premièred by the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]] under Stravinsky on January 24, 1946.

The Symphony in Three Movements is considered as Stravinsky's first major composition after emigrating to the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Oliver,  ''Igor Stravinsky'' (London: Phaidon Press Ltd, 1995), p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;  It uses material written by Stravinsky for aborted film projects.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Walsh, "Stravinsky, Igor", ''New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', 2nd ed., edited by Stanley Sadie and John Tyrrell (New York: Grove's Dictionaries), §8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943, Stravinsky had begun work on rescoring his ballet ''[[The Rite of Spring]].''  Although the project was left incomplete, his revisit to this earlier composition appears to have influenced the symphony.  The ostinatos and shock tactics of the last movement, for example, recalls the "Glorification of the Chosen One" and "Sacrificial Dance" from ''The Rite'', and some woodwind passages are reminiscent of the ballet's introduction. On the other hand, there are passages forecasting the opera ''[[The Rake's Progress]]'', notably the openings of the slow movement and the finale.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Walter White, ''Stravinsky: The Composer and his Works,'' 2nd edition (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1979), p. 435.&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical performance of the symphony lasts 20–25 minutes:

{{Ordered list|type=upper-roman
|Overture; Allegro (about 10 minutes)

|Andante; Interlude: L'istesso tempo (about 6 minutes)
|Con moto (about 6 minutes)
}}

The symphony is scored for an orchestra of [[piccolo]], 2 [[flute]]s, 2 [[oboe]]s, 3 [[clarinet]]s in B{{music|flat}} and A (3rd doubling [[bass clarinet]]), 2 [[bassoon]]s, [[contrabassoon]], 4 [[French horn|horn]]s, 3 [[trumpet]]s in C, 3 [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], [[bass drum]], [[piano]], [[harp]], [[violin]]s I &amp; II, [[viola]]s, [[cello]]s, and [[double bass]]es.

Stravinsky, who rarely acknowledged outside inspirations for his music, referred to the composition as his 'war symphony'.&lt;ref&gt;Charles M. Joseph,  ''Stravinsky Inside Out''  (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 2001), p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;  He claimed the symphony as a direct response to events of the [[Second World War]] in both [[Europe]] and [[Asia]].  The first movement was inspired by a documentary on Japanese [[scorched earth]] tactics in [[China]].  The third movement deals with footage of German soldiers goosestepping and the allied forces' mounting success.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Oliver, ''Igor Stravinsky'' (London: Phaidon Press Ltd, 1995), pp.152, 154-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Material is drawn from projects that Stravinsky had abandoned or reorganized. The [[piano]]'s presence in the first movement stems from a piano concerto that was left incomplete.  Music for [[harp]] is prominent in the second movement, using themes he had written for [[The Song of Bernadette (film)|the film adaptation]] of [[Franz Werfel]]'s novel ''[[The Song of Bernadette (novel)|The Song of Bernadette]]''.  Stravinsky was initially informally approached for the writing of the film score.  On 15 February 1943 he started writing music for the "Apparition of the Virgin" scene.  In the event, no contract was ever signed with him, and the project went to [[Alfred Newman (composer)|Alfred Newman]], who won an Oscar.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Walsh. [https://books.google.com/books?id=-TwBsckJEKsC&amp;pg=PA143&amp;lpg=PA143&amp;dq=The+Song+of+Bernadette+stravinsky&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9suWVBtpF6&amp;sig=IbfeafhanDoWgbpTXIwVbRq7rdo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=i2FUVL67NY_58QX5woLQCQ&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Song%20of%20Bernadette%20stravinsky&amp;f=false ''Stravinsky: The Second Exile: France and America 1934-1971, p. 144]. Retrieved 1 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The third movement unites the first two movements by giving equal emphasis to piano and harp.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Walter White, ''Stravinsky: The Composer and his Works,'' 2nd edition (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1979),  p. 429.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to Stravinsky's earlier [[Symphony in C (Stravinsky)|Symphony in C]], the Symphony in Three Movements is much more turbulent and chromatic. While the Symphony in C is based on abstract ideas, his later symphony makes use of pressing social concerns.  From a purely musical standpoint, the Symphony hearkens back to Stravinsky's earlier styles of composition while remaining an outstanding achievement of [[neoclassicism]].&lt;ref&gt;Eric Walter White, ''Stravinsky: The Composer and his Works,'' 2nd edition (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1979), p. 435.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1979 to 1980, the American intermedia artist, [[Jack Ox]], produced three visual mappings from Stravinsky's Symphony in Three Movements which can be seen at http://intermediaprojects.org/pages/Stravinsky.html

}}
'''The (International) Noise Conspiracy''' (abbreviated '''T(I)NC''') were a [[Swedish people|Swedish]] [[rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Sweden]] in the late months of 1998. The line-up consists of [[Dennis Lyxzén]] (vocals), [[Inge Johansson]] (bass), Lars Strömberg (guitar), and Ludwig Dahlberg (drums). The band is known for its [[punk rock|punk]] and [[garage rock]] musical influences, and its impassioned [[left-wing]] political stance. Up until 2004, guitarist/organist/keyboardist Sara Almgren was also a member of the band. Dennis formed The (I)NC almost immediately after the breakup of his former band, [[Refused]]. The (I)nc takes pride in blending the roots of at least four other bands, including Totalt Jävla Mörker (Johansson), [[Separation (band)|Separation]] (Strömberg), Saidiwas (Dahlberg and Almgren), and Doughnuts (Almgren). In 2007, Inge Johansson also played in the band [[The Most (Swedish band)|The Most]].

Influenced by a quote from 1960's folk singer [[Phil Ochs]], according to lead singer Lyxzén, the band wanted to achieve an ideal blend of music and politics that was, "a cross between [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Che Guevara]]."  Furthermore, according to the liner notes of their debut album, [[The First Conspiracy]], the band wanted to combat music's function as [[Spectacle (Situationism)|Spectacle]].  This is a concept taken from [[Guy Debord]]'s work ''The [[Society of the Spectacle]]''.

== History ==

=== First recordings ===
In 1999 the band recorded their debut ''[[The First Conspiracy]]'' with [[G7 Welcoming Committee Records]].  Although hardly a commercial success, the album led to the band's recognition by the punk label [[Burning Heart Records]] (though the same label already had released records of some of the band members' older bands), and in 2000 they released the album ''[[Survival Sickness]]''.  Considered one of the finest examples of situationist-influenced [[punk rock]], ''[[Survival Sickness]]'' saw the band pushing their [[revolution]]ary ideology with scathing lyrics and an infectious rhythm.  Many of the lyrics are taken directly from the writings of members of the Situationist International especially [[Raoul Vaneigem|Raoul Vaneigem's]] [[The Revolution of Everyday Life]].

By 2001, the band had re-entered the Burning Heart studio to record their next album, ''[[A New Morning, Changing Weather]]''. Taking advantage of Almgren’s organ playing, The (International) Noise Conspiracy produced a record far beyond the realm of most punk groups.  Using organs, horns, keys, etc., the band began to establish a reputation for eclectic instrumentation, which they would continue to cultivate.

=== Touring ===
[[File:International Noise Conspiracy in Karlstorbahnhof Heidelberg Germany 20081206.jpg|right|thumb|200px|On tour in [[Heidelberg]], Germany]]
The band's first tour outside [[Sweden]], their homeland, went to [[China]]. They played their songs in illegal and hidden rock clubs while the Chinese police waited outside with guns and nightsticks.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} They also toured with [[My Chemical Romance]] in the United States. The band's lead singer describes their music as like [[The Hives]] with added politics, as The (International) Noise Conspiracy have a strong [[Situationist International|Situationist]] agenda in some of their work, such as 'Capitalism Stole My Virginity'.

=== Later recordings ===
Between 2002 and 2003, the ''Up For Sale EP'' ([[Sympathy for the Record Industry]]) and ''[[Bigger Cages, Longer Chains EP]]'' (2003, [[Burning Heart Records|Burning Heart]]/[[Epitaph Records]]) were recorded and the 16 March 2002 show in [[Bremen]], [[Germany]] recorded and released by Tobby Holzinger ([[Your Choice Records]]) as ''[[Your Choice Live Series 025|''Your Choice Live Series Vol.25'']]''.

In 2004 The (International) Noise Conspiracy teamed up with famed producer [[Rick Rubin]] on what would become their next album. Swedish jazz saxophone player [[Jonas Kullhammar]] temporarily joined the band on sax and keyboards and also co-wrote the songs. Organists [[Billy Preston]] and [[Benmont Tench]] also temporarily joined the lineup, as Sara Almgren left the band in order to play for the Swedish punk band, [[The Vicious]] (later [[Masshysteri]]).  [[Rick Rubin]] signed the band on to his label [[American Recordings (US)|American Recordings]]. In the end, the band released [[Armed Love (album)|Armed Love]] in 2004. The inlay of the album pays tribute to the slogan: "¡O Bailan todos, o no baila nadie!" as written by [[Tupamaros]]. The saying translates to: "Either Everyone Dances, or No One Dances!" According to The (International) Noise Conspiracy, they try to define their idea and music with this phrase.

The (International) Noise Conspiracy continues to play and tour to this day, constantly pushing a far-left wing stance towards [[autonomous Marxism]].

In 2006 the (International) Noise Conspiracy contributed a cover of "Shut Up" to [[The Monks]] tribute album ''Silver Monk Time: A Tribute to The Monks'', which was released in October.

In 2007 the band completed the recording of a new album. In an interview for Rockstar.tv on 28 August, the band said they were planning on naming their new album "The Cross Of My Calling" and it would contain "mystical" lyrics with a more soulful sound, which will make its release on 17 November 2008, in Europe, and 25 November, in America. The fourteen-track album was recorded with producer Rick Rubin&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.burningheart.com/news/print.php?id=430,"The (International) Noise Conspiracy working on new album with Rick Rubin!" | Burning Heart] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926234013/http://www.burningheart.com/news/print.php?id=430, |date=26 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; through [[Burning Heart Records|Burning Heart]], American and Vagrant Records.

'''''The Protocols of the Elders of Zion''''' ({{lang-ru|Протоколы сионских мудрецов}}) or '''''The Protocols of the Meetings of the Learned Elders of Zion''''' is an [[antisemitic canard|antisemitic fabricated text]] purporting to describe a [[Jewish]] plan for global domination. The hoax, which was shown to be plagiarized from several earlier sources, some not antisemitic in nature,{{Sfn | Graves | 1921}} was first published in [[Russian Empire|Russia]] in 1903, translated into multiple languages, and disseminated internationally in the early part of the 20th century. According to the claims made by some of its publishers, the ''Protocols'' are the minutes of a late 19th-century meeting where Jewish leaders discussed their goal of global Jewish [[hegemony]] by subverting the morals of [[Gentile]]s, and by controlling the press and the world's economies.

[[Henry Ford]] funded printing of 500,000 copies that were distributed throughout the United States in the 1920s. The [[Nazi Party|Nazis]] sometimes used the ''Protocols'' as propaganda against Jews; it was assigned by some German teachers, as if factual, to be read by German schoolchildren after the Nazis came to power in 1933,&lt;ref name = "Segel"&gt;Segel, BW and Levy, RS. ''A Lie and a Libel: The History of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion''. University of Nebraska Press (1995), p. 30. {{ISBN|0803242433}},&lt;/ref&gt; despite having been exposed as fraudulent by ''[[The Times]]'' of [[London]] in 1921. It is still widely available today in numerous languages, in print and on the Internet, and continues to be presented by some proponents as a genuine document.

==Creation==
{{Antisemitism}}
The ''Protocols'' is a fabricated document purporting to be factual. Textual evidence shows that it could not have been produced prior to 1901. It is notable that the title of [[Sergei Nilus]]'s widely distributed edition contains the dates "1902–1903", and it is likely that the document was actually written at this time in Russia, despite Nilus' attempt to cover this up by inserting French-sounding words into his edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Michelis|first1=Cesare G. De|title=The non-existent manuscript : a study of the Protocols of the sages of Zion|date=2004|publisher=Univ. of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln|isbn=0803217277|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cesare G. De Michelis]] argues that it was manufactured in the months after a Russian Zionist congress in September 1902, and that it was originally a parody of Jewish idealism meant for internal circulation among antisemites until it was decided to clean it up and publish it as if it were real. Self-contradictions in various testimonies show that the individuals involved—including the text's initial publisher, [[Pavel Krushevan]]—deliberately obscured the origins of the text and lied about it in the decades afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Michelis|first1=Cesare G. De|title=The non-existent manuscript : a study of the Protocols of the sages of Zion|date=2004|publisher=Univ. of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln|isbn=0803217277|pages=76–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the placement of the forgery in 1902–1903 Russia is correct, then it was written at the beginning of the [[anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire]], in which thousands of Jews died or fled the country. Many of the people whom De Michelis suspects of involvement in the forgery were directly responsible for inciting the pogroms.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Political conspiracy background===
Towards the end of the 18th century, following the [[Partitions of Poland]], the [[Russian Empire]] inherited the world's largest Jewish population. The Jews lived in ''[[shtetls]]'' in the West of the Empire, in the [[Pale of Settlement]] and until the 1840s, local Jewish affairs were organised through the ''[[qahal]]'', including for purposes of taxation and conscription into the [[Imperial Russian Army]]. Following the ascent of [[liberalism]] in Europe, the Russian ruling class became more hardline in its reactionary policies, upholding the banner of ''[[Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality]]'', whereby non-Orthodox and non-Russian subjects, including the Jews, were not always embraced. Jews who attempted to [[Jewish assimilation|assimilate]] were regarded with suspicion as potential "infiltrators" supposedly trying to "take over society", while Jews who remained attached to traditional Jewish culture were resented as undesirable aliens.

[[File:Kagal book.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|right|''The Book of the Kahal'' (1869) by Jacob Brafman, in the Russian language original.]]
Resentment towards Jews, for the aforementioned reasons, existed in Russian society, but the idea of a Protocols-esque [[international Jewish conspiracy]] for world domination was minted in the 1860s. [[Jacob Brafman]], a Russian Jew from [[Minsk]], had a falling out with agents of the local kahal &amp;ndash; the semi-autonomous Jewish government &amp;ndash; and consequently turned against [[Judaism]]. He subsequently converted to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] and authored polemics against the [[Talmud]] and the kahal.{{sfn|Webman|2012|p=60}} Brafman claimed in his books ''The Local and Universal Jewish Brotherhoods'' (1868) and ''The Book of the Kahal'' (1869), published in [[Vilna]], that the kahal continued to exist in secret and that it had as its principal aim undermining Christian entrepreneurs, taking over their property and ultimately seizing power. He also claimed that it was an international conspiratorial network, under the central control of the ''[[Alliance Israélite Universelle]]'', which was based in Paris and then under the leadership of [[Adolphe Crémieux]], a prominent [[freemason]].{{sfn|Webman|2012|p=60}} The Vilna Talmudist, [[Jacob Barit]], attempted to refute Brafman's claim.

The impact of Brafman's work took on an international aspect, as it was translated into English, French, German and other languages. The image of the "kahal" as a secret international Jewish shadow government working as a [[state within a state]] was picked up by anti-Jewish publications in Russia and was taken seriously by some Russian officials such as P. A. Cherevin and [[Nikolay Pavlovich Ignatyev]] who in the 1880s urged governor-generals of provinces to seek out the supposed kahal. This was around the time of the ''[[Narodnaya Volya]]''  assassination of Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia]] and the subsequent [[pogrom]]s. In France it was translated by Monsignor [[Ernest Jouin]] in 1925, who supported the Protocols. In 1928, [[Siegfried Passarge]], a geographer active in the [[Third Reich]], translated it into German.

Aside from Brafman, there were other early writings which posited a similar concept to the Protocols. This includes ''The Conquest of the World by the Jews'' (1878),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Forms of Hatred: The Troubled Imagination in Modern Philosophy and Literature|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=M7Tdl6vgbmUC|publisher = Rodopi|date = 2003-01-01|isbn = 9042010665|first = Leonidas|last = Donskis}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in [[Basel]] and authored by Osman Bey (born Frederick Millingen). Millingen was a British subject of [[Dutch Jews|Dutch-Jewish]] extraction (the grandson of [[James Millingen]]), but served as an officer in the [[Ottoman Army]] where he was born. He converted to [[Islam]], but later became a Russian Orthodox Christian. Bey's work was followed up by [[Hippolytus Lutostansky]]'s ''The Talmud and the Jews'' (1879) which claimed  that Jews wanted to divide Russia among themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://newspaperarchive.com/us/new-york/new-york/new-york-times/1911/08-27/page-42|title = Ritual murder encouraged...|last = |first = |date = August 27, 1911|work = New York Times|access-date = |via = |publication-date = August 27, 1911}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incidentally, in a 1904 edition of ''The Talmud and the Jews,'' Hippolytus directly quoted verbatim the first, little-known 1903 edition of the ''Protocols''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Non-Existent Manuscript - University of Nebraska Press|url = http://www.nebraskapress.unl.edu/product/Non-Existent-Manuscript,671722.aspx|website = www.nebraskapress.unl.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sources employed===
Source material for the forgery consisted jointly of ''[[The Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu|Dialogue aux enfers entre Machiavel et Montesquieu]]'' (''Dialogue in Hell Between [[Niccolò|Machiavelli]] and [[Montesquieu]]''), an 1864 [[political satire]] by [[Maurice Joly]];{{Sfn | Jacobs | Weitzman | 2003 | p = 15}} and a chapter from ''Biarritz'', an 1868 novel by the antisemitic German novelist [[Hermann Goedsche]], which had been translated into [[Russian language|Russian]] in 1872.&lt;ref name = "translated97"&gt;{{Citation | last = Segel | first = Binjamin W | title = A Lie and a Libel: The History of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion | editor-link = Richard S.

A major source for the ''Protocols'' was ''[[Der Judenstaat]]'' by [[Theodor Herzl]], which was referred to as ''Zionist Protocols'' in its initial French and Russian editions. Paradoxically, early Russian editions of the ''Protocols'' assert that they did not come from a Zionist organization.{{Sfn|De Michelis|2004|p=47}} The text, which nowhere advocates for [[Zionism]], resembles a parody of Herzl's ideas.{{Sfn |De Michelis|2004|p=114]}}

===Literary forgery===
''The Protocols'' is one of the best-known and most-discussed examples of [[literary forgery]], with analysis and proof of its fraudulent origin going as far back as 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/hoax.html | title = A Hoax of Hate | publisher = Jewish Virtual Library}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The forgery is an early example of "[[conspiracy theory]]" literature.&lt;ref name=Boym&gt;{{Citation | first = Svetlana | last = Boym | title = Conspiracy theories and literary ethics: Umberto Eco, Danilo Kis and 'The Protocols of Zion' | journal = Comparative Literature | issue = Spring | year = 1999 | doi = 10.2307/1771244 | volume = 51 | pages = 97}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Written mainly in the first person plural,{{Efn | The text contains 44 instances of the word "I" (9.6%), and 412 instances of the word "we" (90.4%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.shoaheducation.com/protocols.html | title = The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion | others = Marsden, VE transl | publisher = Shoah education }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;}} the text includes [[generalization]]s, [[truism]]s, and [[platitude]]s on how to take over the world: take control of the media and the financial institutions, change the traditional social order, etc. It does not contain specifics.{{Sfn | Pipes | 1997 | p = 85}}

===Maurice Joly===
Elements of the ''Protocols'' were plagiarized from Joly's fictional ''Dialogue in Hell'', a thinly veiled attack on the political ambitions of [[Napoleon III]], who, represented by the [[Gentile|non-Jewish]] character [[Machiavelli]],&lt;ref name ="Google Books Search"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Ye’r | first1 = Bat | first2 = Miriam | last2 = Kochan | author3-link = David Littman (historian)| first3 = David | last3 = Littman | title = Islam and Dhimmitude | publisher = [[Fairleigh Dickinson University Press]] | place = US | date = December 1, 2001 | isbn = 978-0-8386-3942-9 | page = 142 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=n4kTdYgwQPkC&amp;pg=PA142&amp;dq=The+Protocols+of+the+Learned+Elders+of+Zion++forgery+%22Maurice+Joly%22}}.&lt;/ref&gt; plots to rule the world. Joly, a [[Monarchism|monarchist]] and [[Legitimism|legitimist]], was imprisoned in France for 15 months as a direct result of his book's publication. Scholars have noted the irony that ''Dialogue in Hell'' was itself a plagiarism, at least in part, of a novel by [[Eugène Sue]], ''Les Mystères du Peuple'' (1849–56).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Eco | first = Umberto | title = Six Walks in the Fictional Woods| year = 1994 | publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, MA | isbn = 0-674-81050-3| authorlink = Umberto Eco| page= 135| chapter= Fictional Protocols}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Identifiable phrases from Joly constitute 4% of the first half of the first edition, and 12% of the second half; later editions, including most translations, have longer quotes from Joly.{{Sfn | De Michelis | Newhouse | Bi-Yerushalayim | 2004 | p = [https://books.google.com/?id=9uG1jsrOenwC&amp;pg=PA113&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;dq=first+zionist+congress+nilus#v=onepage&amp;q=first%20zionist%20congress%20nilus&amp;f=false 8]}}

''The Protocols'' 1–19 closely follow the order of Maurice Joly's ''Dialogues'' 1–17. For example:

|{{Quote|Our Government will resemble the Hindu god Vishnu. Each of our hundred hands will hold one spring of the social machinery of State.| ''Protocols'', p.&amp;nbsp;65 }}
|}

[[Philip Graves]] brought this plagiarism to light in a series of articles in ''The Times'' in 1921, the first published evidence that the ''Protocols'' was not an authentic document.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last= Bein | first = Alex|year= 1990| page=339|title=The Jewish question: biography of a world problem|isbn = 978-0-8386-3252-9 |publisher= Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn | Graves | 1921}}

===Hermann Goedsche===
{{main|Hermann Goedsche}}
"Goedsche was a postal clerk and a spy for the [[Prussian Secret Police]]. He had been forced to leave the postal work due to his part in forging evidence in the prosecution against the Democratic leader [[Benedict Waldeck]] in 1849."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = IGC | format = [[PDF]] | url = http://ddickerson.igc.org/The_Protocols_of_the_Learned_Elders_of_Zion.pdf | last = Keren | first = David | title = Commentary on The Protocols of the Elders of Zion | date = February 10, 1993 | page = 4 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140729103854/http://ddickerson.igc.org/The_Protocols_of_the_Learned_Elders_of_Zion.pdf | archivedate = July 29, 2014 | df =  }}. Republished as {{Citation | contribution = Introduction | title = The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion | others = Marsden, Victor E transl}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Following his dismissal, Goedsche began a career as a conservative columnist, and wrote literary fiction under the pen name Sir John Retcliffe.&lt;ref name= Cohn1966&gt;{{Citation | first = Norman | last = Cohn | title = Warrant for Genocide: The Myth of the Jewish World-Conspiracy and the Protocols of the Elder of Zion | place = New York | publisher = Harper &amp; Row | year = 1966 | pages = 32–36}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His 1868 novel ''Biarritz'' (''To Sedan'') contains a chapter called "[[Old Jewish Cemetery, Prague|The Jewish Cemetery in Prague]] and the Council of Representatives of the [[Israelites|Twelve Tribes of Israel]]." In it, Goedsche (who was unaware that only two of the original twelve Biblical "tribes" remained) depicts a clandestine nocturnal meeting of members of a mysterious [[rabbi]]nical [[cabal]] that is planning a diabolical "Jewish conspiracy." At midnight, the Devil appears to contribute his opinions and insight. The chapter closely resembles a scene in [[Alexandre Dumas]]' ''Giuseppe Balsamo'' (1848), in which Joseph Balsamo a.k.a. [[Alessandro Cagliostro]] and company plot the [[Affair of the Diamond Necklace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Eco|first=Umberto|title=Serendipities: Language and Lunacy|year=1998|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-231-11134-7|page=14|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rCyBIa34aAMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA14#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1872 a Russian translation of "The Jewish Cemetery in Prague" appeared in [[Saint Petersburg]] as a separate pamphlet of purported non-fiction. François Bournand, in his ''Les Juifs et nos Contemporains'' (1896), reproduced the soliloquy at the end of the chapter, in which the character Levit expresses as factual the wish that Jews be "kings of the world in 100 years" —crediting a "Chief Rabbi John Readcliff." Perpetuation of the myth of the authenticity of Goedsche's story, in particular the "Rabbi's speech", facilitated later accounts of the equally mythical authenticity of the ''Protocols''.&lt;ref name = Cohn1966 /&gt; Like the ''Protocols'', many asserted that the fictional "rabbi's speech" had a ring of authenticity, regardless of its origin: "This speech was published in our time, eighteen years ago," read an 1898 report in [[La Croix]], "and all the events occurring before our eyes were anticipated in it with truly frightening accuracy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Maurice | last = Olender | authorlink = Maurice Olender | title = Race and Erudition | publisher = Harvard University Press | year = 2009 | page = 11}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Publication history===
{{see also|List of editions of Protocols of the Elders of Zion}}
''The Protocols'' appeared in print in the Russian Empire as early as 1903, published as a series of articles in ''[[Znamya (newspaper)|Znamya]]'', a [[Black Hundreds]] newspaper owned by [[Pavel Krushevan]]. It appeared again in 1905 as the final chapter (Chapter XII) of the second edition of ''Velikoe v malom i antikhrist'' ("The Great in the Small &amp; [[Antichrist]]"), a book by [[Sergei Nilus]]. In 1906, it appeared in pamphlet form edited by [[Georgy Butmi de Katzman]].{{Sfn | de Michelis | Newhouse | Bi-Yerushalayim | 2004}}

These first three (and subsequently more) Russian language imprints were published and circulated in the [[Russian Empire]] during the 1903–6 period as a tool for [[scapegoating]] Jews, blamed by the monarchists for the defeat in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] and the [[Revolution of 1905]]. Common to all three texts is the idea that Jews aim for world domination. Since ''The Protocols'' are presented as merely a [[document]], the [[Book design#Front matter|front matter]] and [[Book design#Back matter (end matter)|back matter]] are needed to explain its alleged origin. The diverse imprints, however, are mutually inconsistent. The general claim is that the document was stolen from a secret Jewish organization. Since the alleged original stolen manuscript does not exist, one is forced to restore a purported original edition. This has been done by the Italian scholar, [[Cesare G. De Michelis]] in 1998, in a work which was translated into English and published in 2004, where he treats his subject as [[Apocrypha]].{{Sfn | de Michelis | Newhouse | Bi-Yerushalayim | 2004}}{{Sfn | Cohn | 1967}}

As fiction in the genre of literature, the tract was further analyzed by [[Umberto Eco]] in his novel ''[[Foucault's Pendulum]]'' in 1988 (English translation in 1989), in 1994 in chapter 6, "Fictional Protocols", of his ''[[Six Walks in the Fictional Woods]]'' and in his 2010 novel ''[[The Prague Cemetery]]''.

As the [[Russian Revolution]] unfolded, causing [[White movement]]-affiliated Russians to flee to the West, this text was carried along and assumed a new purpose. Until then, ''The Protocols'' had remained obscure;{{Sfn | Cohn | 1967}} it now became an instrument for blaming Jews for the Russian Revolution. It became a tool, a political weapon, used against the [[Bolsheviks]] who were depicted as overwhelmingly Jewish, allegedly executing the "plan" embodied in ''The Protocols''. The purpose was to discredit the [[October Revolution]], prevent the West from recognizing the [[Soviet Union]], and bring about the downfall of [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s regime.{{Sfn | de Michelis | Newhouse | Bi-Yerushalayim | 2004}}{{Sfn | Cohn | 1967}}

===First Russian language editions===

====Conspiracy references====
According to [[Daniel Pipes]],
{{Quote |The great importance of ''The Protocols'' lies in its permitting antisemites to reach beyond their traditional circles and find a large international audience, a process that continues to this day. The forgery poisoned public life wherever it appeared; it was "self-generating; a blueprint that migrated from one conspiracy to another."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Umberto | last = Eco | author-link = Umberto Eco | title = [[Foucault's Pendulum]] | place = London | publisher = Picador | year = 1990 | page = 490}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The book's vagueness—almost no names, dates, or issues are specified—has been one key to this wide-ranging success. The purportedly Jewish authorship also helps to make the book more convincing. Its embrace of contradiction—that to advance, Jews use all tools available, including capitalism and communism, [[philo-Semitism]] and antisemitism, democracy and tyranny—made it possible for ''The Protocols'' to reach out to all: rich and poor, [[right-wing|Right]] and [[left-wing|Left]], Christian and [[Muslim]], American and Japanese.{{Sfn | Pipes | 1997 | p = 85}}}}

Pipes notes that the ''Protocols'' emphasizes recurring themes of conspiratorial antisemitism: "Jews always scheme", "Jews are everywhere", "Jews are behind every institution", "Jews obey a central authority, the shadowy 'Elders'", and "Jews are close to success."{{Sfn | Pipes | 1997 | pp = 86–87}}

''The Protocols'' is widely considered influential in the development of other conspiracy theories{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}, and reappears repeatedly in contemporary conspiracy literature, such as [[Jim Marrs]]' ''Rule by Secrecy,'' which identifies the work as a Czarist forgery. Some recent editions proclaim that the "Jews" depicted in the Protocols are a cover identity for other conspirators such as the [[Illuminati]],&lt;ref name="Freund2000" /&gt; [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]], the [[Priory of Sion]], or even, in the opinion of [[David Icke]], "[[Reptilian humanoid|extra-dimensional entities]]".{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Emergence in Russia===
[[File:1912ed TheProtocols by Nilus.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|right|The front piece of a 1912 edition using occult symbols.]]
The chapter "In the Jewish Cemetery in Prague" from Goedsche's ''Biarritz'', with its strong antisemitic theme containing the alleged rabbinical plot against the European civilization, was translated into Russian as a separate pamphlet in 1872.&lt;ref name="translated97"/&gt;  However, in 1921, Princess [[Catherine Radziwill]] gave a private lecture in New York in which she claimed that the Protocols were a forgery compiled in 1904–5 by Russian journalists [[Matvei Golovinski]] and Manasevich-Manuilov at the direction of [[Pyotr Rachkovsky]], Chief of the Russian secret service in Paris.&lt;ref name = NYT_RadziwillQuizzed&gt;{{Cite news |title = Princess Radziwill Quizzed at Lecture; Stranger Questions Her Title After She Had Told of Forgery of "Jewish Protocols."

In 1944, German writer [[Konrad Heiden]] identified Golovinski as an author of the ''Protocols''.&lt;ref name = Freund2000&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.reason.com/news/show/27585.html | title = Forging Protocols | first = Charles Paul | last = Freund | newspaper = Reason Magazine |date=February 2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Radziwill's account was supported by Russian historian Mikhail Lepekhine, who published his findings in November 1999 in the French newsweekly ''[[L'Express (France)|L'Express]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | language = French | url = http://www.phdn.org/antisem/protocoles/origines.html | first = Éric | last = Conan | title = Les secrets d'une manipulation antisémite |trans-title=The secrets of an antisemite manipulation | newspaper = L’Express | date = November 16, 1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Lepekhine considers the ''Protocols'' a part of a scheme to persuade Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] that the modernization of Russia was really a Jewish plot to control the world.&lt;ref name=Skuratovsky&gt;{{Citation | first = Vadim | last = Skuratovsky | title = The Question of the Authorship of "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion" | publisher = Judaica Institute | place = Kiev | year = 2001 | isbn = 966-7273-12-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen Bronner|Stephen Eric Bronner]] writes that groups opposed to progress, parliamentarianism, urbanization, and capitalism, and an active Jewish role in these modern institutions, were particularly drawn to the antisemitism of the document.{{Sfn | Bronner | 2003 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=kkl-ZxE6h0oC&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=A+rumor+about+the+Jews+modernity&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Bd3tTKjkMcKt8Aa6_u3SDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=A%20rumor%20about%20the%20Jews%20modernity&amp;f=false ix], [https://books.google.com/books?id=kkl-ZxE6h0oC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=A+rumor+about+the+Jews+attack+on+liberalism&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=WtvtTI3MOoK88gauzMGiDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 56]}} [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] scholar [[Vadim Skuratovsky]] offers extensive literary, historical and [[linguistics|linguistic]] analysis of the original text of the ''Protocols'' and traces the influences of [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s [[prose]] (in particular, ''[[The Grand Inquisitor]]'' and ''[[The Possessed (novel)|The Possessed]]'') on Golovinski's writings, including the ''Protocols''.&lt;ref name = Skuratovsky /&gt;

Golovinski's role in the writing of the Protocols is disputed by Michael Hagemeister, Richard Levy and Cesare De Michelis, who each write that the account which involves him is historically unverifiable and to a large extent provably wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = M. Hagemeister | title = The Non-Existent Manuscript | pages = ''passim''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Michael Hagemeister | title = The Protocols of the Elders of Zion: Between History and Fiction | journal = New German Critique 103 | volume = 35 | number = 1 | year = 2008 | pages = 83–95 | quote = How can we explain that when it comes to the origins and dissemination of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, the rules of careful historical research are so completely ignored and we are regularly served up stories}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Levy-record/&gt;

In his book ''The Non-Existent Manuscript'', Italian scholar [[Cesare G. De Michelis]] studies early Russian publications of the ''Protocols''. The ''Protocols'' were first mentioned in the Russian press in April 1902, by the Saint Petersburg newspaper ''Novoye Vremya'' ({{lang|ru|Новое Время}} – ''The New Times''). The article was written by famous conservative publicist [[:ru:Меньшиков, Михаил Осипович|Mikhail Menshikov]] as a part of his regular series "Letters to Neighbors" ("Письма к ближним") and was titled "Plots against Humanity". The author described his meeting with a lady ([[Yuliana Glinka]], as it is known now) who, after telling him about her mystical revelations, implored him to get familiar with the documents later known as the ''Protocols''; but after reading some excerpts, Menshikov became quite skeptical about their origin and did not publish them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | language = Russian | url = http://www.vehi.net/asion/kon/08.html#_ftnref14 | first1 = T | last1 = Karasova | first2 = D | last2 = Chernyakhovsky | title = Afterword}} in {{Citation | language = Russian | edition = translated | first = Norman | last = Cohn | title = Warrant for Genocide}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Krushevan and Nilus editions====
The ''Protocols'' were published at the earliest, in serialized form, from August 28 to September 7 ([[Old Style|O.S.]]) 1903, in ''[[Znamya (newspaper)|Znamya]]'', a Saint Petersburg daily newspaper, under [[Pavel Krushevan]]. Krushevan had initiated the [[Kishinev pogrom]] four months earlier.&lt;ref name = Kadzhaya&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.newtimes.ru/eng/detail.asp?art_id=470 |title= The Fraud of a Century, or a book born in hell |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20051217032523/http://www.newtimes.ru/eng/detail.asp?art_id=470 | archivedate =December 17, 2005 | first = Valery | last = Kadzhaya | accessdate = September 2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, Sergei Nilus published the full text of the ''Protocols'' in ''Chapter XII'', the final chapter (pp&amp;#8239;305–417), of the second edition (or third, according to some sources) of his book, ''[[Velikoe v malom i antikhrist]]'', which translates as "The Great within the Small: The Coming of the Anti-Christ and the Rule of Satan on Earth". He claimed it was the work of the [[First Zionist Congress]], held in 1897 in [[Basel, Switzerland]].{{Sfn | de Michelis | Newhouse | Bi-Yerushalayim | 2004}} When it was pointed out that the First Zionist Congress had been open to the public and was attended by many non-Jews, Nilus changed his story, saying the Protocols were the work of the 1902–3 meetings of the Elders, but contradicting his own prior statement that he had received his copy in 1901:
{{quote |In 1901, I succeeded through an acquaintance of mine (the late Court Marshal Alexei Nikolayevich Sukotin of Chernigov) in getting a manuscript that exposed with unusual perfection and clarity the course and development of the secret Jewish Freemasonic conspiracy, which would bring this wicked world to its inevitable end. The person who gave me this manuscript guaranteed it to be a faithful translation of the original documents that were stolen by a woman from one of the highest and most influential leaders of the Freemasons at a secret meeting somewhere in France—the beloved nest of Freemasonic conspiracy.&lt;ref name= Kominsky1970&gt;{{Citation | first = Morris | last = Kominsky | author-link = Morris Kominsky | title = The Hoaxers | year = 1970 | page = 209 | isbn = 0-8283-1288-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Stolypin's fraud investigation, 1905====
A subsequent secret investigation ordered by [[Pyotr Stolypin]], the newly appointed chairman of the Council of Ministers, came to the conclusion that the ''Protocols'' first appeared in Paris in antisemitic circles around 1897–1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.fedorov.ru/stolypin.html | title = P. Stolypin's attempt to resolve the Jewish question | first = Boris | last = Fyodorov | language = Russian | place = [[Russia|RU]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Nicholas II]] learned of the results of this investigation, he requested, "The Protocols should be confiscated, a good cause cannot be defended by dirty means."&lt;ref name=Burtsev1938&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Jewniverse | language = Russian | url = http://www.jewniverse.ru/RED/Burtsev/BPSM-1-4.htm | place = Paris | title = The Protocols of the Elders of Zion: A Proved Forgery | first = Vladimir | last = Burtsev | author-link = Vladimir Burtsev | year = 1938 | page = 106 | chapter = 4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the order, or because of the "good cause", numerous reprints proliferated.&lt;ref name=Kadzhaya /&gt;

===''The Protocols'' in the West===
[[File:1934 Protocols Patriotic Pub.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|right|A 1934 edition by the Patriotic Publishing Company of Chicago.]]
In the United States, ''The Protocols'' are to be understood in the context of the [[First Red Scare]] (1917–20). The text was purportedly brought to the United States by a Russian army officer in 1917; it was translated into English by [[Natalie de Bogory]] (personal assistant of [[Harris A. Houghton]], an officer of the [[United States Department of War|Department of War]]) in June 1918,&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, N. ''Henry Ford and the Jews. The mass production of hate''. PublicAffair (2001), p. 82. {{ISBN|1891620525}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and Russian expatriate [[Boris Brasol]] soon circulated it in American government circles, specifically diplomatic and military, in typescript form,&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, M. ''The American axis: Henry Ford, Charles Lindbergh, and the rise of the Third Reich''. St. Martin's Press (2003), p. 60. {{ISBN|0312290225}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a copy of which is archived by the [[Hoover Institute]].{{Sfn | Singerman | 1980 | pp = 48–78}} It also appeared in 1919 in the ''[[Public Ledger (Philadelphia)|Public Ledger]]'' as a pair of serialized newspaper articles. But all references to "Jews" were replaced with references to ''[[Bolsheviki]]'' as an [[Investigative journalism|exposé]] by the journalist and subsequently highly respected [[Columbia University]] School of Journalism dean [[Carl W. Ackerman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p61ACwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT190&amp;lpg=PT190&amp;dq=ackerman.+zion.+bolshevik&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SQs_6856AM&amp;sig=1A-Ll7ZMvv3419WlV06ZPKKXnVw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjAhuCB_NLXAhWS3KQKHd4jAJcQ6AEIQDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=Replaced%20every%20reference%20to%20Jews%20with%20Bolshevists&amp;f=false|title=Haters, Baiters and Would-Be Dictators: Anti-Semitism and the UK Far Right|last=Toczek|first=Nick|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=1317525876|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{Sfn | Singerman | 1980 | pp = 48–78}}

In 1923, there appeared an anonymously edited pamphlet by the [[Britons Publishing Society]], a successor to [[The Britons]], an entity created and headed by [[Henry Hamilton Beamish]]. This imprint was allegedly a translation by [[Victor E. Marsden]], who died in October 1920.{{Sfn | Singerman | 1980 | pp = 48–78}}

Most versions substantially involve "protocols", or minutes of a speech given in secret involving Jews who are organized as [[Elder (administrative title)|Elders]], or [[List of types of spiritual teachers|Sages]], of [[Zion]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/3930590/The-Protocols-of-Zion-Chapter-5 | last = Rivera | first = David Allen | title = Final Warning: A History of The New World Order | chapter = 5 | origyear = 1994 | year = 1998 | url = http://www.silverbearcafe.com/private/NWO/nwotoc.html}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and underlies 24 protocols that are supposedly followed by the Jewish people.

====English language imprints====
On October 27 and 28, 1919, the [[Philadelphia]] ''[[Public Ledger (Philadelphia)|Public Ledger]]'' published excerpts of an English language translation as the "Red Bible," deleting all references to the purported Jewish authorship and re-casting the document as a [[Bolshevik]] [[manifesto]].&lt;ref name="Jenkins"&gt;{{Citation | authorlink= Philip Jenkins|last=Jenkins | first = Philip | title = Hoods and Shirts: The Extreme Right in Pennsylvania, 1925–1950 | publisher = [[UNC Press]] | year = 1997 | page = 114 | isbn = 0-8078-2316-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author of the articles was the paper's [[correspondent]] at the time, [[Carl W.

In the leader (editorial) titled "The Jewish Peril, a Disturbing Pamphlet: Call for Inquiry", [[Wickham Steed]] wrote about ''The Protocols'':
{{Quote | What are these 'Protocols'? Are they authentic? If so, what malevolent assembly concocted these plans and gloated over their exposition? Are they forgery?

In 1934, an anonymous editor expanded the compilation with "Text and Commentary" (pp 136–41). The production of this uncredited compilation was a 300-page book, an inauthentic expanded edition of the twelfth chapter of Nilus's 1905 book on the coming of the anti-Christ. It consists of substantial liftings of excerpts of articles from Ford's antisemitic periodical ''The Dearborn Independent''. This 1934 text circulates most widely in the English-speaking world, as well as on the internet. The "Text and Commentary" concludes with [[quote mining|a comment]] on [[Chaim Weizmann]]'s October 6, 1920, remark at a banquet: "A beneficent protection which God has instituted in the life of the Jew is that He has dispersed him all over the world". Marsden, who was dead by then, is credited with the following assertion:
{{Quote | It proves that the Learned Elders exist. It proves that Dr. Weizmann knows all about them. It proves that the desire for a "National Home" in Palestine is only camouflage and an infinitesimal part of the Jew's real object. It proves that the Jews of the world have no intention of settling in Palestine or any separate country, and that their annual prayer that they may all meet "Next Year in Jerusalem" is merely a piece of their characteristic make-believe. It also demonstrates that the Jews are now a world menace, and that the Aryan races will have to domicile them permanently out of Europe.&lt;ref name=Marsden&gt;{{Citation | contribution = Introduction | edition = English | first = Victor E | last = Marsden | title = The protocols of the learned Elders of Zion}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====''The Times'' exposes a forgery, 1921====
[[File:TheTimes exposes TheProtocols as a forgery.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.85|''The Times'' exposed the ''Protocols'' as a forgery on August 16–18, 1921]]
In 1920–1921, the history of the concepts found in the ''Protocols'' was traced back to the works of Goedsche and [[Jacques Crétineau-Joly]] by [[Lucien Wolf]] (an English Jewish journalist), and published in London in August 1921. But a dramatic exposé occurred in the series of articles in ''The Times'' by its [[Constantinople]] reporter, [[Philip Graves]], who discovered the plagiarism from the work of [[Maurice Joly]].{{Sfn | Graves | 1921}}

&lt;!-- Note: In 1921, the city of Istanbul was called Constantinople. don't change the city name without discussing. --&gt;
According to writer Peter Grose, [[Allen Dulles]], who was in Constantinople developing relationships in post-[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] political structures, discovered "the source" of the documentation and ultimately provided him to ''The Times''. Grose writes that ''The Times'' extended a loan to the source, a Russian émigré who refused to be identified, with the understanding the loan would not be repaid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Peter | last = Grose | title = Gentleman Spy: The Life of Allen Dulles | publisher = Houghton Mifflin | year = 1994}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Colin Holmes, a lecturer in economic history at [[Sheffield University]], identified the émigré as Michael Raslovleff, a self-identified antisemite, who gave the information to Graves so as not to "give a weapon of any kind to the Jews, whose friend I have never been."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author-link = Leon Poliakov| last = Poliakov | first = Leon | year = 1997 | contribution = Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion | title = [[Encyclopedia Judaica]] | edition = CD-ROM 1.0 | editor-first = Cecil | editor-last = Roth | editor-link = Cecil Roth | publisher = Keter | isbn = 965-07-0665-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first article of Graves' series, titled "A Literary Forgery", the editors of ''The Times'' wrote, "our Constantinople Correspondent presents for the first time conclusive proof that the document is in the main a clumsy plagiarism. He has forwarded us a copy of the French book from which the plagiarism is made."{{Sfn | Graves | 1921}} In the same year, an entire book{{Sfn | Bernstein | 1921}} documenting the hoax was published in the United States by [[Herman Bernstein]]. Despite this widespread and extensive debunking, the ''Protocols'' continued to be regarded as important factual evidence by antisemites. Dulles, a successful lawyer and career diplomat, attempted to persuade the [[US State Department]] to publicly denounce the forgery, but without success.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Breitman et al. (2005).

===Arab world===
A translation made by an Arab Christian appeared in [[Cairo]] in 1927 or 1928, this time as a book. The first translation by an Arab Muslim was also published in Cairo, but only in 1951.&lt;ref name="Lewis 1986"&gt;{{Citation |last=Lewis |first=Bernard |authorlink=Bernard Lewis |title=Semites and Anti-Semites: An Inquiry into Conflict and Prejudice | year=1986 |publisher=WW Norton &amp; Co. |isbn=0-393-02314-1 | page = 199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===

====The Berne Trial, 1934–35====
{{Main|Berne Trial}}
The selling of the ''Protocols'' (edited by German antisemite [[Theodor Fritsch]]) by the [[National Front (Switzerland)|National Front]] during a political manifestation in the Casino of Berne on June 13, 1933,{{Efn | The main speaker was the former chief of the Swiss General Staff [[Emil Sonderegger]].}} led to the [[Berne Trial]] in the ''Amtsgericht'' (district court) of [[Berne]], the capital of [[Switzerland]], on October 29, 1934. The plaintiffs (the Swiss Jewish Association and the Jewish Community of Berne) were represented by Hans Matti and [[Georges Brunschvig]], helped by Emil Raas. Working on behalf of the defense was German antisemitic propagandist [[Ulrich Fleischhauer]]. On May 19, 1935, two defendants (Theodore Fischer and Silvio Schnell) were convicted of violating a Bernese statute prohibiting the distribution of "immoral, obscene or brutalizing" texts&lt;ref name="NZZ"&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.nzz.ch/2005/12/23/fe/articleDEYRW.html|title= Die Quelle allen Übels? Wie ein Berner Gericht 1935 gegen antisemitische Verschwörungsphantasien vorging|last= Hafner|first= Urs|date= December 23, 2005|publisher= [[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]]|language= German|accessdate= 2008-10-11|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110201033419/http://www.nzz.ch/2005/12/23/fe/articleDEYRW.html|archivedate= February 1, 2011|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while three other defendants were acquitted. The court declared the ''Protocols'' to be forgeries, plagiarisms, and obscene literature. Judge Walter Meyer, a Christian who had not heard of the ''Protocols'' earlier, said in conclusion,
{{Quote | I hope the time will come when nobody will be able to understand how in 1935 nearly a dozen sane and responsible men were able for two weeks to mock the intellect of the Bern court discussing the authenticity of the so-called Protocols, the very Protocols that, harmful as they have been and will be, are nothing but laughable nonsense.&lt;ref name=Kadzhaya /&gt;}}

[[Vladimir Burtsev]], a Russian émigré, anti-Bolshevik and [[Anti-fascism|anti-Fascist]] who exposed numerous [[Okhrana]] [[agent provocateur|agents provocateurs]] in the early 1900s, served as a witness at the Berne Trial. In 1938 in Paris he published a book, ''The Protocols of the Elders of Zion: A Proved Forgery'', based on his testimony.

On November 1, 1937, the defendants appealed the verdict to the ''Obergericht'' (Cantonal Supreme Court) of Berne. A panel of three judges acquitted them, holding that the ''Protocols'', while false, did not violate the statute at issue because they were "political publications" and not "immoral (obscene) publications (Schundliteratur)" in the strict sense of the law.&lt;ref name="NZZ"/&gt; The presiding judge's opinion stated, though, that the forgery of the ''Protocols'' was not questionable and expressed regret that the law did not provide adequate protection for Jews from this sort of literature. The court refused to impose the fees of defense of the acquitted defendants to the plaintiffs, and the acquitted Theodor Fischer had to pay 100 Fr. to the total state costs of the trial (Fr. 28'000) that were eventually paid by the Canton of Berne.{{Sfn | Ben-Itto | 2005 | loc = chapter 11}} This decision gave grounds for later allegations that the appeal court "confirmed authenticity of the Protocols" which is contrary to the facts. A view favorable to the pro-Nazi defendants is reported in an appendix to [[Leslie Fry]]'s ''Waters Flowing Eastward''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url= http://www.iamthewitness.com/books/Denis.Fahey/Waters.Flowing.Eastward/Appendix.2_The.Berne.Trials.htm |title= Waters Flowing Eastward | chapter = Appendix II: The Berne Trials|last=Fry|first=Leslie|accessdate=2009-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more scholarly work on the trial is in a 139-page monograph by Urs Lüthi&lt;!--not [[Urs Lüthi]]--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Lüthi | first = Urs | language = German | title = Der Mythos von der Weltverschwörung: die Hetze der Schweizer Frontisten gegen Juden und Freimaurer, am Beispiel des Berner Prozesses um die "Protokolle der Weisen von Zion" | place = Basel/Frankfurt am Main | publisher = Helbing &amp; Lichtenhahn | year = 1992 | isbn = 978-3-7190-1197-0 | oclc = 30002662}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Basel Trial====
A similar trial in Switzerland took place at [[Basel]]. The Swiss [[National Front (Switzerland)|Frontists]] Alfred Zander and Eduard Rüegsegger distributed the ''Protocols'' (edited by the German Gottfried zur Beek) in Switzerland. Jules Dreyfus-Brodsky and Marcus Cohen sued them for insult to Jewish honor. At the same time, chief rabbi [[Mordecai Ehrenpreis|Marcus Ehrenpreis]] of Stockholm (who also witnessed at the Berne Trial) sued Alfred Zander who contended that Ehrenpreis himself had said that the ''Protocols'' were authentic (referring to the foreword of the edition of the ''Protocols'' by the German antisemite Theodor Fritsch). On June 5, 1936 these proceedings ended with a settlement.{{Efn | Zander had to withdraw his contention and the stock of the incriminated ''Protocols'' were destroyed by order of the court. Zander had to pay the fees of this Basel Trial.{{Sfn | Lüthi | 1992 | p = 45}}}}

===Germany===
According to historian [[Norman Cohn]],{{Sfn | Cohn | 1967 | p = 169}} the assassins of German Jewish politician [[Walter Rathenau]] (1867–1922) were convinced that Rathenau was a literal "Elder of Zion".

It seems likely Hitler first became aware of the ''Protocols'' after hearing about it from ethnic German [[white émigrés]], such as [[Alfred Rosenberg]] and [[Max Erwin von Scheubner-Richter]].&lt;ref&gt;Gellately, Robert (2012). ''Lenin, Stalin and Hitler: The Age of Social Catastrophe'', {{ISBN|1448138787}}, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler refers to the ''Protocols'' in ''[[Mein Kampf]]'':

{{Quote | ... [The Protocols] are based on a forgery, the ''[[Frankfurter Zeitung]]'' moans [ ] every week ... [which is] the best proof that they are authentic ... the important thing is that with positively terrifying certainty they reveal the nature and activity of the Jewish people and expose their inner contexts as well as their ultimate final aims.&lt;ref name = Hitler1924&gt;{{Citation | first = Adolf | last = Hitler | title = [[Mein Kampf]] | chapter = XI: Nation and Race | volume = I | pages = 307–8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
	
The Protocols also became a part of the Nazi propaganda effort to justify persecution of the Jews. In ''[[The Holocaust]]: The Destruction of European Jewry 1933–1945'', [[Nora Levin]] states that "Hitler used the Protocols as a manual in his war to exterminate the Jews":
{{Quote | Despite conclusive proof that the ''Protocols'' were a gross forgery, they had sensational popularity and large sales in the 1920s and 1930s. They were translated into every language of Europe and sold widely in Arab lands, the US, and England. But it was in Germany after World War I that they had their greatest success. There they were used to explain all of the disasters that had befallen the country: the defeat in the war, the hunger, the destructive inflation.&lt;ref name=Levin&gt;Nora Levin, ''The Holocaust: The Destruction of European Jewry 1933–1945''. Quoting from [https://web.archive.org/web/20021001121141/http://ddickerson.igc.org/hitler-protokollen.html IGC.org]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hitler endorsed the Protocols in his speeches from August 1921 on, and it was studied in German classrooms after the Nazis came to power. "Distillations of the text appeared in German classrooms, indoctrinated the Hitler Youth, and invaded the USSR along with German soldiers."&lt;ref name = "Segel"/&gt; Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels proclaimed: "The Zionist Protocols are as up-to-date today as they were the day they were first published."{{Sfn | Pipes | 1997 | p = 95}}

In contrast to Hitler, Nazi leader [[Erich von dem Bach-Zelewsky]] admitted:

{{Quote |I am the only living witness but I must say the truth. Contrary to the opinion of the National Socialists, that the Jews were a highly organized group, the appalling fact was that they had no organization whatsoever. The mass of the Jewish people were taken complete by surprise. They did not know at all what to do; they had no directives or slogans as to how they should act. This is the greatest lie of anti-Semitism because it gives the lie to that old slogan that the Jews are conspiring to dominate the world and that they are so highly organized. In reality, they had no organization of their own at all, not even an information service. If they had had some sort of organization, these people could have been saved by the millions, but instead, they were taken completely by surprise. Never before has a people gone as unsuspectingly to its disaster. Nothing was prepared. Absolutely nothing.&lt;ref name="Levin1968"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nora Levin|title=The holocaust: the destruction of European Jewry, 1933-1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hvFmAAAAMAAJ|year=1968|publisher=T.

[[Richard S.

====German language publications====
Having fled Ukraine in 1918–19, [[Piotr Shabelsky-Bork]] brought the Protocols to Ludwig Muller Von Hausen who then published them in German.{{Sfn | Kellogg | 2005 | pp = 63–65}} Under the pseudonym Gottfried Zur Beek he produced the first and "by far the most important"{{Sfn | Pipes | 1997 | p = 94}} German translation. It appeared in January 1920 as a part of a larger antisemitic tract&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Geheimnisse der Weisen von Zion | publisher = Auf Vorposten | year = 1919 | language = German}}.&lt;/ref&gt; dated 1919. After ''The Times'' discussed the book respectfully in May 1920 it became a bestseller. "The [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern family]] helped defray the publication costs, and Kaiser [[Wilhelm, German Crown Prince|Wilhelm II]] had portions of the book read out aloud to dinner guests".{{Sfn | Pipes | 1997 | p = 95}} Alfred Rosenberg's 1923 edition&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Alfred | last = Rosenberg | author-link = Alfred Rosenberg | title = Die Protokolle der Weisen von Zion und die jüdische Weltpolitik | place = Munich | publisher = Deutscher Volksverlag | year = 1923}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "gave a forgery a huge boost".{{Sfn | Pipes | 1997 | p = 95}}

A new 1937 edition had a much higher impact, and three further editions in the following months sold 60,000 copies total.&lt;ref name="Pisanty2006"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2015}} The fifth edition had an introduction by [[Julius Evola]], which argued around the issue of forgery, stating: "The problem of the authenticity of this document is secondary and has to be replaced by the much more serious and essential problem of its truthfulness".&lt;ref name="Pisanty2006"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2015}}

===Modern era===

Governments or political leaders in most parts of the world have not referred to the ''Protocols'' since World War II. The exception to this is the Middle East, where a large number of [[Arab]] and Muslim regimes and leaders have endorsed them as authentic, including endorsements from Presidents [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] and [[Anwar Sadat]] of [[Egypt]], the elder President Arif of [[Iraq]],&lt;ref&gt;Katz, S. and Gilman, S.

{{Main|Ash-Shatat}}
''[[Ash-Shatat]]'' (Arabic: الشتات ''The Diaspora'') is a 29-part Syrian television series produced in 2003 by a private Syrian film company and was based in part on the ''Protocols.'' Syrian national television declined to air the program. ''Ash-Shatat'' was shown on Lebanon's Al-Manar, before being dropped.  The series was shown in Iran in 2004, and in Jordan during October 2005 on Al-Mamnou.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2658">A '''theatre consultant''' is a [[consultant]] who specializes in the design of facilities for the [[performing arts]], equipment for those facilities and the operation of [[theatre]].

Professional consultants provide unbiased, functionally sound, practical consulting and design services for performance and public assembly facilities of all kinds.[[Architects and owners | Owners and architects]] use their expertise to programme, plan and help with the construction of these kinds of complicated buildings. Their [[professional organization]] in the [[United States]] is the [[American Society of Theatre Consultants]] (ASTC). The [[United Kingdom British | international]] equivalent organisation is the [[Society | Institute]] of Theatre Consultants [[(STC)| (IoTC)]].  There are also many Theatre Consultants that are not members of these organisations.  Unlike the practice of architecture or engineering, theatre consulting is not regulated by [[professional license, but the Institute of Theatre Consultants accredits Theatre Consultants on the basis of proven work, operates a Code of Practice and provides training to members]].

Consultants are generally expert in building codes and the requirements of the American with Disabilities Act as related to theatres, auditoria, and concert halls.  They typically provide detailed design for special theatre systems such as performance lighting systems, [[Fly system|stage rigging]], orchestra pit lifts, seating (fixed and movable), acoustical canopies and more.  Some theatre consulting firms also provide acoustical and/or audio-visual '''consulting''', although those are specialties in their own right.

Theatre Consultants may work directly for a facility or organisation, or they may be contracted as a specialty (sub)consultant for a Project Architect or Engineer.  Services can range from programmatic planning for the development of new facilities, planning for the refurbishment or repurposing of existing facilities, or just (re)design or assessment of specific production systems.

'''Velours du Kasaï''' (Kasaï velvet) is a kind of textile fabric made in [[Kasai province|Kasai]], a province in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (Zaïre).  Traditionally, the weaving is done by men of the Shoowa from the [[Kuba_Kingdom|Kuba]] ethnic group, while the embroidery is reserved to women.  Ideally, the embroiderers should be pregnant.  The technique is still practised.

Originally the cloth was made using beaten wood bark but, since the introduction of [[raffia]], only vestiges of this remain. Some belts (duun) are still made in bark; they symbolize power and may be worn only by certain nobles. Bark is still used for certain loincloths for women (Ishyeen). The center of these loincloths is formed of many triangles of bark, alternately black and white. These are cut out of the raw bark either natural, or dyed black and sewn together. The choice of this method rather than that of drawing is significant - for the Kuba, value is measured by a work's difficulty.

The fabric is made of very fine fibre from the inside of the leaves of young [[palm trees]]. The leaves are dried in the sun, then split along their length and connected to form a basic warp of raffia, from 2m to 4m in length. Fine leaf fibres are then interweaved in a woof to create the ''velvet'' effect. This is then wrapped around the waist to create a loincloth known as ''Mapel'' (for men) or ''Ntshak'' (for women).

The designs are very varied and are created spontaneously but normally follow the body scarification patterns of the Kuba.

The cloth is heavy and expensive and is not normally intended to be worn, but is used as a bed covering or on the royal throne.  Individual items take from several months to a year to produce.  Cloths were used as currency or given as gifts.

'''''Walk on the beach''''' (Spanish '''''Paseo a la orilla del mar or Paseo an orillas del mar'''''), is a 1909 oil on canvas painting by the Spanish painter [[Joaquín Sorolla]].

==  Description ==
It has a height of 205&amp;nbsp;cm and a width of 200&amp;nbsp;cm. and shows the wife and eldest daughter of the painter during a walk on the beach in Valencia. The painting is part of the collection of the [[Museo Sorolla]] in [[Madrid]].

== Analysis ==
The large canvas is almost square in format and unusually monumental for a beach view.&lt;ref&gt;Begoña Torres González: ''Sorolla'', 2009, S. 326&lt;/ref&gt; The life-size women depicted are Sorolla's wife Clotilde and his eldest daughter Maria. Sorolla painted the scenery at the Playa de El Cabanyal beach in his hometown of [[Valencia]].&lt;ref&gt;José Luis Díez, Javier Barón: ''Joaquín Sorolla, 1863-1923'', 2009, S. 402.&lt;/ref&gt; Both women lean forward slightly, so that they appear to move toward the right edge. While the wife stands straight, aligned to the edge, the daughter Maria has slightly turned her head to her right shoulder and is looking towards the viewer.

Mother and daughter both wear long white sundresses. The elegant presentation, which also includes a straw hat for each and a parasol for the mother, is typical of the fashion of the time, around 1910. The 19-year-old Maria has a simple floor-length dress that emphasizes her slender silhouette. At the neck the dress is finished with a stand-up collar. The tight-fitting sleeves contrast with the rest of the dress, and are of a more transparent white cloth, through which shines the skin. Of similar fabric is an panel of cloth mounted below the chest on a large ring. The sea wind blows the cloth into arabesques behind the daughter.&lt;ref&gt;José Luis Díez, Javier Barón: ''Joaquín Sorolla, 1863-1923'', 2009, S. 402.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the dress appears a brown leather shoe; on its side reflections emphasize the smooth surface. In her right hand Maria holds a yellow straw hat with a wide, sweeping brim, decorated with purple colored flowers and a turquoise bow. She has pinned her brown hair into a knot, so that her face comes into its own.&lt;ref&gt;José Luis Díez, Javier Barón: ''Joaquín Sorolla, 1863-1923'', 2009, S. 402.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The figure behind the daughter, Clotilde Sorolla, also wears a white dress, her hips accented by a white belt. Thus both the breasts and the buttocks have clearer contours than the daughter's. Clothilde's dress has cropped sleeves, and she carries a jacket, also made of white fabric, on her left forearm in front of her abdomen. In her left hand she holds an open white parasol, which is angled to the ground on the left side. Under Clotilde's dress are two elegant white women's shoes with small heels. On her head Clotilde wears a straw hat, which is also decorated with purple colored flowers. In addition, a greenish-transparent veil is draped over the entire hat, and falls forward over her face and is blown backward almost horizontally in the wind. Clotilde has bent her right arm upward and her hand lies on the veil. This creates the impression that she must adjust it due to the wind veil or even hold it in place. Of the head of Clotilde little can be seen. Large parts of face, depicted in profile, are in shadow and only the chin is in brighter sunlight. Also, the wide sweeping hat obscures the hair almost completely. Just behind a pearl earring is a bit of dark hair. While the young face of the daughter Maria is looks directly into the sun, the face of the mother is hidden by the shadow of the hat. The clothes and accessories show the two women to be members of the upper class spending their free time in the summer with mild temperatures and light winds.&lt;ref&gt;Begoña Torres González: ''Sorolla'', 2009, S. 326&lt;/ref&gt;

Mother and daughter stand a few meters from the sea on an ocher expanse of sand in the foreground at the bottom. Unlike the people depicted, the sand surface is depicted in short strokes. Behind the two women is a seamless transition from the beach to the sea. The perspective of the viewer is slightly raised so that no horizon is visible. Instead, the beach and the sea form a curtain-like background and a curl of white foam &lt;!-- weißkräuselnden--&gt; rides a wave at the top of the screen, replacing the horizon. The sea shimmers in different shades of blue, which Sorolla applied in elongated brushstrokes.&lt;ref&gt;José Luis Díez, Javier Barón: ''Joaquín Sorolla, 1863-1923'', 2009, S. 402.&lt;/ref&gt; Before chest of Clotilde the sea has a pale blue color, and behind the backs of the womwn are rather darker shades of blue. Dimly seen, the area to the right of the daughter, where the turquoise surface of the water is difficult to distinguish from the shore. The dominant color of the image is the white of the dress and the parasol. Sorolla has mixed this white, like the French [[impressionism|impressionists]], with many other colors. So blue, yellow, lilac or orange shades are in the white form the light and shadow effects.&lt;ref&gt;Begoña Torres González: ''Sorolla'', 2009, S. 326&lt;/ref&gt; 
In their bright whites, the figures clearly stand out from the rest of the image. The light is characteristic of the early evening of a summer day in the Mediterranean. The already low sun appears from the direction of the viewer on the two sides to seeing women whose long shadows loom on the beach behind them. Playback of these lighting effects under the southern sun are typical [[Valenciano for Luminismo]], one in Spain resulting from the Impressionism as a special form of Neo-Impressionism, whose main representative was Joaquín Sorolla.

== Background to the creation of the painting ==
[[File:Joaquín_Sorolla_y_Bastida_-_Sol_de_la_tarde.jpg|thumb|Joaquín Sorolla: ''Abendsonne'', 1903]]
[[File:Joaquín_Sorolla_y_Bastida_-_La_hora_del_baño.jpg|thumb|''La hora del baño'', 1904]]
The 1909 was extremely successful for Sorolla. He had already been widely received recognized for his paintings and received awards not only in Spain but also in France and Germany, but the year 1909 was a high point in his career. On the invitation of the American art collector [[Archer M. Huntington]], he traveled with his wife and the two older children Maria and Joaquín at the beginning of the year to New York City. Here Huntington had previously opened the [[Hispanic Society of America]] that year and in their rooms should Sorolla showed the first exhibition of his work in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Blanca Pons-Sorolla: ''Joaquín Sorolla'', 2009, S. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; It was Sorolla's first trip across the Atlantic and later adjusting success unpredictable. On February 4, 1909, the opening of the exhibition took place;&lt;ref&gt;Blanca Pons-Sorolla: ''Joaquín Sorolla'', 2009, S. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; initially only a few visitors came. This changed gradually as very positive reviews appeared in the newspapers. When it closed on March 8 the exhibition had had a total of 169,000 visitors to see Sorolla's work.&lt;ref&gt;Blanca Pons-Sorolla: ''Joaquín Sorolla'', 2009, S. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; Encouraged by the overwhelming response, a slightly modified collection was also shown in Buffalo and Boston.&lt;ref&gt;José Luis Díez, Javier Barón: ''Joaquín Sorolla, 1863-1923'', 2009, S. 495.&lt;/ref&gt; During his stay in the United States Sorolla received 20 portrait commissions, including that of the just-elected US President [[William Howard Taft]], whom he visited in the White House in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;Blanca Pons-Sorolla: ''Joaquín Sorolla'', 2009, S. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1909, as Sorolla left the United States, he had sold a total of 195 images - including two works to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] - and taken in the enormous sum of 181,760 US dollars.&lt;ref&gt;Blanca Pons-Sorolla: ''Joaquín Sorolla'', 2009, S. 204.&lt;/ref&gt;

Back in Europe, Sorolla held initially in Paris and exhibited in art exhibition of the [[Société des Artistes Français]], the 1903 painting ''Evening Sun'', an image of fishermen from Valencia.&lt;ref&gt;José Luis Díez, Javier Barón: ''Joaquín Sorolla, 1863-1923'', 2009, S. 495.&lt;/ref&gt; About Madrid he traveled to Valencia, where he saw his daughter Elena and the rest of the family. He attended the local art exhibition Exposicion Regional and received a second award for the work exhibited there. Inspired by the success of his trip to America and the good reviews he received at the exhibitions in Paris and Valencia, he began a prolific summer. He planned in 1911 to travel again on exhibition tour in the United States and needed new paintings. He stayed until the end of September in Valencia and created in these summer months "some of his best and most spectacular beach scenes," as his biographer and granddaughter Blanca Pons-Sorolla notes.&lt;ref&gt;Blanca Pons-Sorolla: „Some of his best and most spectacular beach scenes come from this summer“ in ''Joaquín Sorolla'', 2009, S. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting paintings of this summer beach walk provide a climax in Sorolla's career according to José Luis Alcaide.&lt;ref&gt;José Luis Alcaide: „Por supuesto que pintará más cuadros de playa, pero sin duda este conjunto de lienzos representa un jalon esencial en su carrera.“ in José Luis Díez, Javier Barón: ''Joaquín Sorolla, 1863-1923'', 2009, S. 402.&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in Valencia, Joaquín Sorolla had been familiar since his youth with life on the sea. In his early work, there is the traditional port view ''Marina, Barcos en el puerto'' with which he made his debut in the art exhibition ''Expsoición National'' in Madrid in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;Blanca Pons-Sorolla: ''Joaquín Sorolla'', 2009, S48.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1890s he repeatedly returned to the subject of fishermen from Valencia. In some very large paintings he showed fishermen bringing their catch ashore or pulling their boat onto the beach with oxen. He also portrayed boatbuilders or fishwives, not a glamorous life of leisure activities, but working people at sea. For this work he received very positive reviews and was awarded prizes. In addition, these works brought international success. The French government bought the painting ''La vuelta de la presca'' from 1895 and the [[Berlin National Gallery]] acquired ''Pescadores Valencianos'' of 1895.

In 1900 Sorolla began to paint children bathing.&lt;ref&gt;Zu den frühesten Arbeiten mit dem Motiv badender Knaben gehört ''El baño'' von 1899, eine Studie zum großformatigen Gemälde ''¡Triste herencia!'' von 1901.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1904 painting ''La hora del baño'' Sorolla linked fishing and bathing children and portrayed naked children swimming between a fishing boat and an ox standing in the water. In the foreground one of the children comes from the sea and is awaited by a young woman who stretches out a white cloth to dry the wet child. Already this picture anticipates Sorolla's themes in ''Walk on the Beach''. So the white fabric plays a central role: The movement of the cloth in the wind is already the main subject, the shore area between the water and beach has no clear contours and the whole picture is bathed in the light of early evening.&lt;ref&gt;José Luis Díez, Javier Barón: ''Joaquín Sorolla, 1863-1923'', 1900, S. 326.&lt;/ref&gt;

That same summer Sorolla portrayed his wife Clotilde at Valencia. In ''Clotilde en la playa'' the wife sits on a stool near the sea in a white dress. Here as in the later ''Walk on the Beach'', the parasol is already an important prop. The open parasol casts shadows on her face, which is hidden by a veil in the later image. In this picture the painter has taken a slightly elevated position, so that no background horizon line is visible. Instead of the beach in the foreground it goes directly into the waves of the sea, with no sky to be seen.

In 1906, Sorolla and his family visited [[Biarritz]] in northern Spain (Note: Biarritz is in France). In the group portrait ''Paseo de Faro'' several women walk along the cliffs above the beach. The painter shows here the beach and washed around by underwater rock formation as a background motive. In front of the frieze-like image the women are loosely arranged side by side. Again, white clothing dominates the scene, and only the young girl in the center stands out in a bright red jacket. Large hats and parasols are important props in this image also.

In 1909 he returned to the beach in Valencia and again took up themes depicting people at sea. In the portrait ''Elena en la playa'' Sorolla portrayed his youngest daughter in a white dress with the beach as a background. In this portrait, from about the same time as ''Walk on the Beach'', Sorolla painted the meeting of land and sea, the waves of the sea, the dress moving in the wind, a hat and the light of a summer day in the Mediterranean.

== Provenance ==
The painting was until the artist's death in his possession. In his will he bequeathed the picture to his son Joaquín Sorolla García. who was the first director of the museum in the former home of his parents, [[Sorolla Museum]]. In 1931 Sorolla's wife Clotilde bequeathed the house together with the inventory to the Spanish government, set up with the support for a Joaquín Sorolla museum. The son Joaquín Sorolla García, followed the generous example of his mother and after his death in 1948 bequeathed to the Spanish government the ''Walk on the Beach'' painting, along with other works of his father. Since that time, it has belonged to the collection of the [[Museo Sorolla]] in [[Madrid]].
