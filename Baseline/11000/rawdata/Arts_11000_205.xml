'''''.detuned''''' is a [[demoscene]] project by the German demogroup [[.theprodukkt]] (also known as [[Farbrausch]]), released on the [[PlayStation 3]]. It was initially released on September 20, 2009 in Japan, and on October 15 in Europe and North America. It is the second [[demo (computer programming)|demo]] released on the PlayStation 3 after ''[[Linger in Shadows]]''.

''.detuned'' features a man sitting in a chair surrounded by a psychedelic environment. The player can switch into various modes, and using the trigger buttons and right analogue stick, apply certain effects on the man, which e.g. make his head shrink or apply a post-processing filter on the visuals and music. The player is also able to load their own music in.

[[IGN]] cited the lack of lasting appeal as the biggest problem about ''.detuned'', saying that "selling for $2.99 in the US PlayStation Store, that's about a dollar per minute of entertainment". Overall they awarded the game a 4/10, with a 1/10 on Lasting Appeal.&lt;ref name="ign"/&gt;

__NOTOC__
'''5x5=25''' was a two-part [[abstract art]] exhibition held in September–October 1921 in [[Moscow]]. The five artists whose work was shown were [[Aleksandra Ekster]], [[Lyubov Popova]], [[Alexander Rodchenko]], [[Varvara Stepanova]] and [[Alexander Vesnin]]. They presented highly abstracted, geometric work that rejected [[expressionist]] forms of painting common before the [[World War I]] and pretended to be the "end" or "death" of art.

Rodchenko presented three canvases of a single colour (red, yellow and blue). He saw that his formal research into [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] had reached completion at this point, and claimed that he had demonstrated the "end of painting".&lt;ref name="artdaily"&gt;[http://www.artdaily.org/section/news/index.asp?int_sec=11&amp;int_new=26647&amp;int_modo=1 Art Daily article on Rodchenko and his role in Constructivism]&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition has been considered an anti-painting manifesto.&lt;ref name="artprof"&gt;[http://www.artprofessor.com/artists/alexander-rodchenko.php Art Professor article on Alexander Rodchenko]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AA/&gt;

Lyubov Popova showed canvasses almost bare, puzzling viewers and provoking hail from the critics. Her "flight from painting" influenced [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Mark Rothko]] and [[Ad Reinhardt]].&lt;ref name=AA&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/drawing-a-blank-russian-constructivist-makes-late-tate-debut-1516801.html | title=Drawing a blank: Russian constructivist makes late Tate debut | publisher=[[The Independent]] | author=Arifa Akbar | accessdate=2009-06-25 | location=London | date=January 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popova herself did not regard her works as "the end"; on the contrary, she wrote, "all pieces presented here should be regarded as merely preparations for concrete construction".&lt;ref&gt;Gleason, Kenez, Stites, pp. 208-209.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander Vesnin presented five&lt;ref name=KM92&gt;Khan-Magomedov, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; abstract [[cubism|cubist]] canvases that appear pure abstractions but were, in fact, ultimate decomposition of human figures.&lt;ref name=KM92/&gt; Vesnin's catalogue cover, in particular, is typical of his book and advertising art of the period:  numbers in two "lines" (5x5 and 25) are offset against the baseline, but this irregularity is "disguised" by angled lines dissecting the space.&lt;ref name=KM93&gt;Khan-Magomedov, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Catalogues of the exhibition were hand-drawn by the artists and contained original artwork that has never been displayed publicly. At least ten unique albums survive in Russia to date.&lt;ref name=KM92/&gt; The 1921 show was reconstructed in 2009 in London's [[Tate|Tate Gallery]]. Modern critics remain divided over the question of whether "death of painting" was a genuine statement of modern art or, indeed, it was a dead end with no future.&lt;ref name=AA/&gt;

Part of the [[AFI 100 Years... series]], '''AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars''' is a list of the top 25 male and 25 female greatest screen legends of [[Cinema of the United States|American film history]]. The list was unveiled by the [[American Film Institute]] on June 15, 1999, in a [[CBS]] special hosted by [[Shirley Temple]], with 50 current actors making the presentations.

The American Film Institute defined an "American screen legend" as an actor or a team of actors during the [[Classical Hollywood cinema]] era with a significant screen presence in American feature-length (40 min or more) films whose screen debut occurred in or before 1950, or whose screen debut occurred after 1950, but whose death has marked a completed body of work.

The top stars of their respective gender are [[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[Katharine Hepburn]]. They starred together in the classic adventure 1951 film ''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'', for which Bogart won his only [[Academy Award]].

'''''An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump''''' is a 1768 [[Oil painting|oil-on-canvas painting]] by [[Joseph Wright of Derby]], one of a number of candlelit scenes that Wright painted during the 1760s. The painting departed from convention of the time by depicting a scientific subject in the reverential manner formerly reserved for scenes of historical or religious significance. Wright was intimately involved in depicting the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the scientific advances of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. While his paintings were recognized as exceptional by his contemporaries, his provincial status and choice of subjects meant the style was never widely imitated. The picture has been owned by the [[National Gallery, London]], since 1863 and is still regarded as a masterpiece of British art. In June 2015 it was on loan to [[Tate Britain]].

The painting depicts a [[natural philosophy|natural philosopher]], a forerunner of the modern scientist, recreating one of [[Robert Boyle]]'s [[vacuum pump|air pump]] experiments, in which a bird is deprived of air, before a varied group of onlookers. The group exhibits a variety of reactions, but for most of the audience scientific curiosity overcomes concern for the bird. The central figure looks out of the picture as if inviting the viewer's participation in the outcome.

==Historical background==
[[File:Robertboyle newexperiments.jpg|thumb|Title page of [[Robert Boyle]]'s ''New Experiments'' of 1660, in which he detailed how to perform the experiment.]]
In 1659, Robert Boyle commissioned the construction of an air pump, then described as a "pneumatic engine", which is known today as a [[vacuum pump]]. The air pump was invented by [[Otto von Guericke]] in 1650, though its cost deterred most contemporary scientists from constructing the apparatus. Boyle, the son of the [[Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork|Earl of Cork]], had no such concerns—after its construction, he donated the initial 1659 model to the [[Royal Society]] and had a further two redesigned machines built for his personal use. Aside from Boyle's three pumps, there were probably no more than four others in existence during the 1660s: [[Christian Huygens]] had one in [[The Hague]], [[Henry Power]] may have had one at [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], and there may have been pumps at [[Christ's College, Cambridge]], and the [[Montmor Academy]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin 1984, pp. 481–520.&lt;/ref&gt; Boyle's pump, which was largely designed to Boyle's specifications and constructed by [[Robert Hooke]], was complicated, temperamental, and problematic to operate. Many demonstrations could only be performed with Hooke on hand, and Boyle frequently left critical public displays solely to Hooke—whose dramatic flair matched his technical skill.&lt;ref&gt;Jardine 2004, pp. 104–106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the operational and maintenance obstacles, construction of the pump enabled Boyle to conduct a great many experiments on the properties of air, which he later detailed in his ''New Experiments Physico-Mechanicall, Touching the Spring of the Air, and its Effects, (Made, for the Most Part, in a New Pneumatical Engine)''. In the book, he described in great detail 43 experiments he conducted, on occasion assisted by Hooke, on the effect of air on various phenomena. Boyle tested the effects of "rarified" air on combustion, magnetism, sound, and barometers, and examined the effects of increased [[air pressure]] on various substances. He listed two experiments on living creatures: "Experiment 40," which tested the ability of insects to fly under reduced air pressure, and the dramatic "Experiment 41," which demonstrated the reliance of living creatures on air for their survival. In this attempt to discover something "about the account upon which Respiration is so necessary to the Animals, that Nature hath furnish'd with Lungs", Boyle conducted numerous trials during which he placed a large variety of different creatures, including birds, mice, eels, snails and flies, in the vessel of the pump and studied their reactions as the air was removed.&lt;ref&gt;West 2005, pp. 31–39.&lt;/ref&gt; Here, he describes an injured [[lark]]:

{{quote|text=…the Bird for a while appear'd lively enough; but upon a greater Exsuction of the Air, she began manifestly to droop and appear sick, and very soon after was taken with as violent and irregular Convulsions, as are wont to be observ'd in Poultry, when their heads are wrung off:  For the Bird threw her self over and over two or three times, and dyed with her Breast upward, her Head downwards, and her Neck awry.&lt;ref name="Boyle"&gt;Boyle 2003, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By the time Wright painted his picture in 1768, air pumps were a relatively commonplace scientific instrument, and itinerant "lecturers in [[natural philosophy]]"—usually more showmen than scientists—often performed the "animal in the air pump experiment" as the centrepiece of their public demonstration.&lt;ref name="NP"&gt;Elliott 2000, pp. 61–100.&lt;/ref&gt; These were performed in town halls and other large buildings for a ticket-buying audience, or were booked by societies or for private showings in the homes of the well-off, the setting suggested in both of Wright's demonstration pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Egerton, 1998, pp. 337–38.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most notable and respectable of the travelling lecturers was [[James Ferguson (1710–1776)|James Ferguson]] [[Royal Society|FRS]], a Scottish astronomer and probable acquaintance of Joseph Wright (both were friends of [[John Whitehurst]]). Ferguson noted that a "lungs-glass" with a small air-filled bladder inside was often used in place of the animal, as using a living creature was "too shocking to every spectator who has the least degree of humanity".&lt;ref name="RP"&gt;Baird 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}
The full moon in the picture is significant as meetings of the Lunar Circle (renamed the [[Lunar Society]] by 1775) were timed to make use of its light when travelling. 

Wright met Darwin in the early 1760s, probably through their common connection of [[John Whitehurst]], first consulting Darwin about ill health in 1767 when he stayed in the Darwin household for a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=King-Hele|first1=Desmond|title=Eramus Darwin. A life of unequalled achievement|date=1999|publisher=Giles de la Mare Publishers Ltd|location=London|isbn=1-900357-08-9|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; The energy and vivacity of both Erasmus and Mary (Polly) Darwin impressed Wright. In the 1980s Eric Evans (National Gallery) suggested that Darwin is the figure in the left foreground who holds a watch. As this composed timekeeper is not consistent with Darwin's flamboyant character, it is more likely that this is Dr [[William Small]]. The attention to timekeeping fits with Dr Small's role as the social secretary for the Lunar Circle. Small returned from Virginia in 1764 and established his practice in Birmingham in 1765, consistent with this being a meeting in 1767. The profile and wig of this figure are consistent with a contemporary portrait of Small by Tilly Kettle.

===Background===
[[File:Godfried Schalcken Kunstbetrachtung.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Candlelit scene by [[Godfried Schalcken]]]]
During his apprenticeship and early career Wright concentrated on portraiture. By 1762, he was an accomplished portrait artist, and his 1764 group portrait ''James Shuttleworth, his Wife and Daughter'' is acknowledged as his first true masterpiece. [[Benedict Nicolson]] suggests that Wright was influenced by the work of [[Thomas Frye]]; in particular by the 18 bust-length [[mezzotint]]s which Frye completed just before his death in 1762. It was perhaps Frye's candlelight images that tempted Wright to experiment with subject pieces. Wright's first attempt, ''A Girl reading a Letter by candlelight with a Young Man looking over her shoulder'' from 1762 or 1763, is a trial in the genre, and is fetching though uncomplicated.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolson 1968, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;
Wright's ''An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump'' forms part of a series of candlelit [[nocturne]]s that he produced between 1765 and 1768.

There was a [[Chiaroscuro|long history of painting candlelit scenes]] in Western art, although as Wright had not at this date travelled abroad, there remains uncertainty as to what paintings he might have seen in the original, as opposed to [[Old master print|prints]]. Nicolson, who made studies of both Wright and other candlelight painters such as the 17th-century [[Utrecht Caravaggisti]], thought their paintings, among the largest in the style, those most likely to have influenced Wright. However Judy Egerton wonders if he could have seen any, preferring as influences the far smaller works of the [[Leiden fijnschilder]] [[Godfried Schalcken]] (1643–1706), whose reputation was much greater in the early 18th century than subsequently. He had worked in England from 1692 to 1697, and several of his paintings can be placed in English collections in Wright's day.&lt;ref&gt;Egerton (1998), pp. 334–335, and Nicolson (1968), pp. 39–40 and 47. Waterhouse (1978), p. 285, says Wright "must have seen some works by [[Gerard van Honthorst|Honthorst]] or Schalken".&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he was the leading expert writing in English, Nicolson does not suggest that Wright is likely to have known of the 17th-century candlelit narrative religious subjects of [[Georges de La Tour]] and [[Trophime Bigot]], which, in their seriousness, are the closest works to Wright that are lit only by candle. The Dutch painters' works and other candlelit scenes by 18th-century English painters such as Henry Morland (father of [[George Morland|George]]) tended instead to exploit the possibilities of semi-darkness for erotic suggestiveness. Some of Wright's own later candlelit scenes were by no means as serious as his first ones, as seen from their titles: ''Two Boys Fighting Over a Bladder'' and ''[[Two Girls Dressing a Kitten by Candlelight]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Egerton (1998), p. 336.&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Three Persons Viewing the Gladiator by Candlelight.jpg|thumb|''Three Persons Viewing the Gladiator by Candlelight'' (1765)]]
[[File:Wright of Derby, The Orrery.jpg|thumb|''[[A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery]]'' (1768)]]

The first of his candlelit masterpieces, ''Three Persons Viewing the Gladiator by Candlelight'', was painted in 1765, and showed three men studying a small copy of the "[[Borghese Gladiator]]". ''Viewing the Gladiator'' was greatly admired; but his next painting, ''[[A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery|A Philosopher giving that Lecture on the Orrery, in which a Lamp is put in place of the Sun]]'' (normally known by the shortened form ''A Philosopher Giving a Lecture on the Orrery'' or just ''The Orrery''), caused a greater stir, as it replaced the Classical subject at the centre of the scene with one of a scientific nature. Wright's depiction of the awe produced by scientific "miracles" marked a break with traditions in which the artistic depiction of such wonder was reserved for religious events,&lt;ref&gt;Brooke 1991, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; since to Wright the marvels of the technological age were as awe-inspiring as the subjects of the great religious paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolson 1968, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

In both of these works the candlelit setting had a realist justification. Viewing sculpture by candlelight, when the contours showed well and there might even be an impression of movement from the flickering light, was a fashionable practice described by [[Goethe]].&lt;ref&gt;Guilding, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; In the orrery demonstration the shadows cast by the lamp representing the sun were an essential part of the display, used to demonstrate [[eclipse]]s. But there seems no reason other than heightened drama to stage the air pump experiment in a room lit by a single candle, and in two later paintings of the subject by [[Charles-Amédée-Philippe van Loo]] the lighting is normal.&lt;ref&gt;Egerton, 1998, 342.&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was one of a number of British works challenging the set categories of the rigid, French-dictated [[hierarchy of genres]] in the late 18th century, as other types of painting aspired to be treated as seriously as the costumed [[history painting]] of a Classical or mythological subject. In some respects the ''Orrery'' and ''Air Pump'' subjects resembled [[Conversation piece (paintings)|conversation pieces]], then largely a form of middle-class portraiture, though soon to be given new status when [[Johann Zoffany]] began to paint the royal family in about 1766. Given their solemn atmosphere however, and as it seems none of the figures are intended to be understood as portraits (even if models may be identified), the paintings can not be regarded as conversation pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse (1978), pp. 215–216, 270, 285–286.&lt;/ref&gt; The 20th-century art historian [[Ellis Waterhouse]] compares these two works to the "''genre serieux''" of contemporary French drama, as defined by [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Pierre Beaumarchais]], a view endorsed by Egerton.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse (1978), pp. 285–286, and Egerton (1998), p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt;

An anonymous review from the time called Wright "a very great and uncommon genius in a peculiar way".&lt;ref name="DS"&gt;Solkin 1994, p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Orrery'' was painted without a commission, probably in the expectation that it would be bought by [[Washington Shirley, 5th Earl Ferrers|Washington Shirley]], [[Earl Ferrers|5th Earl Ferrers]], an amateur astronomer who had an [[orrery]] of his own, and with whom Wright's friend [[Peter Perez Burdett]] was staying while in [[Derbyshire]]. Figures thought to be portraits of Burdett and Ferrers feature in the painting, Burdett taking notes and Ferrers seated with his son next to the orrery.&lt;ref name="RP" /&gt;
Ferrers purchased the painting for £210, but [[Robert Shirley, 6th Earl Ferrers|the 6th Earl]] auctioned it off, and it is now held by [[Derby Museum and Art Gallery]].&lt;ref name="Lunar"&gt;Uglow 2002, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

''An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump'' followed in 1768, the emotionally charged experiment contrasting with the orderly scene from ''The Orrery''. The painting, which measures 72 by 94½&amp;nbsp;inches (183 by 244&amp;nbsp;cm), shows a grey [[cockatiel]] fluttering in panic as the air is slowly withdrawn from the vessel by the pump. The witnesses display various emotions: one of the girls worriedly watches the fate of the bird, while the other is too upset to observe and is comforted by her father; two gentlemen (one of them dispassionately timing the experiment) and a boy look on with interest, while the young lovers to the left of the painting are absorbed only in each other.&lt;ref name="NMAH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/object.cfm?key=35&amp;objkey=216|title=Print of "Experiment of a Bird in the Air Pump"|publisher=National Museum of American History, Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=30 June 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080605124001/http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/object.cfm?key=35&amp;objkey=216| archivedate= 5 June 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scientist himself looks directly out of the picture, as if challenging the viewer to judge whether the pumping should continue, killing the bird, or whether the air should be replaced and the cockatiel saved.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;Jones 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from that of the children, little sympathy is directed toward the bird; [[David Solkin]] suggests the subjects of the painting show the dispassionate detachment of the evolving scientific society. Individuals are concerned for each other: the father for his children, the young man for the girl, but the distress of the cockatiel elicits only careful study.&lt;ref name="DS2"&gt;Solkin 1994, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;  To one side of the boy at the rear, the cockatiel's empty cage can be seen on the wall, and to further heighten the drama it is unclear whether the boy is lowering the cage on the pulley to allow the bird to be replaced after the experiment or hoisting the cage back up, certain of its former occupant's death. It has also been suggested that he may be drawing the curtains to block out the light from the full moon. 
[[File:jwstudy.jpg|thumb|An earlier [[oil sketch]] showed the demonstrator in a more reassuring pose. The bird here was a common songbird.&lt;ref&gt;The sketch extends somewhat further to the right than shown here. The full image is reproduced in Egerton (1998), p. 339.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Jenny Uglow]] believes that the boy echoes the figure in the last print of [[William Hogarth]]'s ''[[The Four Stages of Cruelty]]'' by pointing out the arrogance and potential cruelty of experimentation,&lt;ref name="Lunar" /&gt; while David Fraser also sees the compositional similarities with the audience grouped round a central demonstration.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser in Egerton 1990, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; The neutral stance of the central character and the uncertain intentions of the boy with the cage were both later ideas: an early study, discovered on the back of a self-portrait, omits the boy and shows the natural philosopher reassuring the girls. In this sketch it is obvious that the bird will survive, and thus the composition lacks the power of the final version.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolson 1968, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Wright, who took many of his subjects from English poetry, probably knew the following passage from "The Wanderer" (1729) by [[Richard Savage (poet)|Richard Savage]]:&lt;ref&gt;Egerton 1998, p. 339.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:So in some Engine, that denies a Vent,
:If unrespiring is some Creature pent,
:It sickens, droops, and pants, and gasps for Breath,
:Sad o'er the Sight swim shad'wy Mists of Death;
:If then kind Air pours powerful in again.
:New Heats, new Pulses quicken ev'ry Vein;
:From the clear'd, lifted, life-rekindled Eye,
:Dispers'd, the dark and dampy Vapours fly.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Trinity (Guiard des Moulins, Bible historiale, 15 c.).jpg|thumb|left|The figures beside the bird have been compared to some late medieval [[Trinity|Trinities]].]]

The cockatiel would have been a rare bird at the time, "and one whose life would never in reality have been risked in an experiment such as this".&lt;ref name="Egerton 1998, p. 340"&gt;Egerton 1998, p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt; It did not become well-known until after it was shown in illustrations to the accounts of the voyages of [[James Cook|Captain Cook]] in the 1770s. Prior to Cook's voyage, cockatiels had been imported only in small numbers as exotic cage-birds. Wright had painted one in 1762 at the home of William Chase, featuring it both in his portrait of Chase and his wife (''Mr &amp; Mrs William Chase'') and a separate study, ''The Parrot''.&lt;ref name="Eg"&gt;Egerton 1990, pp. 58–61.&lt;/ref&gt; In selecting such a rarity for this scientific sacrifice, Wright not only chose a more dramatic subject than the "lungs-glass", but was perhaps making a statement about the values of society in the [[Age of Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name="RP" /&gt; The grey plumage of the cockatiel also shows much more effectively in the darkened room than the small dull-coloured bird in Wright's early [[oil sketch]].&lt;ref name="Egerton 1998, p. 340"/&gt; A resemblance has been pointed out between the group of the bird and the two nearest figures and a type of depiction of the [[Trinity]] found in [[Early Netherlandish painting]], where the [[Holy Spirit]] is represented by a dove, to which [[God the Father]] (the philosopher) points, while Christ (the father) gestures in blessing to the viewer.&lt;ref&gt;First mentioned in Busch 1986, in the chapter  "Wright und sein Rekurs auf die christliche Bildtradition," pp. 29–49; Egerton 1998, p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the table are various other pieces of equipment that the natural philosopher would have used during his demonstration: a thermometer, candle snuffer and cork, and close to the man seated to the right is a pair of [[Magdeburg hemispheres]], which would have been used with the air pump to demonstrate the difference in pressure exerted by the air and a vacuum: when the air was pumped out from between the two hemispheres they were impossible to pull apart. The air pump itself is rendered in exquisite detail, a faithful record of the designs in use at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolson 1968, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; What may be a human skull in the large liquid-filled glass bowl would not have been a normal piece of equipment;&lt;ref&gt;Alternatives for the object in the bowl have been suggested, including lungs (which would be relevant to demonstrations of the properties of air)&lt;!-- BBC4 - http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/features/bird-air-pump.shtml - reports speculation that it could be a lung--&gt;, and Hockney suggests it may even be a ball of sulphur which is creating the illumination for the scene as it reacts with the liquid.&lt;/ref&gt; William Schupbach suggests that it and the candle, which is presumably lighting the bowl from behind, form a ''[[vanitas]]''—the two symbols of mortality reflecting the cockatiel's struggle for life.&lt;ref name="Eg" /&gt;

===Style===
[[File:Wright-Frye.jpg|thumb|Frye's [[mezzotint]] figures (left) are thought to have inspired those of Wright (right).]]
[[File:Fryewright.jpg|thumb|Frye's chalk drawing (left) was obviously the inspiration for this observer (right).]]
The powerful central light source creates a [[chiaroscuro]] effect. The light illuminating the scene has been described as "so brilliant it could only be the light of revelation".&lt;ref&gt;Kimmelman 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; The single source of light is obscured behind the bowl on the table; some hint of a lamp glass can be seen around the side of the bowl, but [[David Hockney]] has suggested that the bowl itself may contain sulphur, giving a powerful single light source that a candle or oil lamp would not.&lt;ref name="Hockney"&gt;Hockney 2001, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; In the earlier study a candle holder is visible, and the flame is reflected in the bowl. Hockney [[Hockney-Falco thesis|believes]] that many of the [[Old Master]]s used optical equipment to assist in their painting, and suggests that Wright may have used lenses to transfer the image to paper rather than painting directly from the scene, as he believes the pattern of shadows thrown by the lighting could have been too complicated for Wright to have captured so accurately without assistance.&lt;ref name="Hockney" /&gt; It may be observed, however, that the stand on which the pump is situated casts no shadow on the body of the philosopher, as it could be expected to do.

Wright's ''Air Pump'' was unusual in that it depicted archetypes rather than specific people, though various models for the figures have been suggested. The young lovers may have been based on Thomas Coltman and Mary Barlow, friends of Wright's, whom he later painted in ''Mr and Mrs Thomas Coltman'' (also in the National Gallery) after their marriage in 1769; [[Erasmus Darwin]] has been suggested as the man timing the experiment on the left of the table, and [[John Warltire]], whom Darwin had invited to help with some air pump experiments in real life, as the natural philosopher;&lt;ref&gt;Nicolson 1968, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; but Wright never identified any of the subjects or suggested they were based on real people.&lt;ref name="RP" /&gt;

In ''The Orrery'', all the subjects have been identified apart from the philosopher, who has physical similarities to [[Isaac Newton]] but differs enough to make positive identification impossible. Nicolson detects the strong influence of Frye throughout the picture. Particularly striking is the similarity between Frye's mezzotint ''Portrait of a Young Man'' of 1760–1761 and the figure of the boy with his head cocked staring intently at the bird. In 1977, Michael Wynne published one of Frye's chalk drawings from around 1760, ''An old man leaning on a staff'', which is so similar to the observer in the right foreground in Wright's picture to make it impossible that Wright had not seen it. There are other hints of Frye's style in the painting: even the figure of the natural philosopher has touches of Frye's ''Figure with Candle''. Though [[Henry Fuseli]] would later also develop on the style of Frye's work there is no evidence of him having painted anything similar until the early 1780s. So, although he had already been in England at the time the ''Air Pump'' was produced, it is unlikely that he was an influence on Wright.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolson 1968, pp. 41–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wright's scientific paintings adopted elements from the tradition of [[history painting]] but lacked the heroic central action typical of that genre. While ground-breaking, they are regarded as peculiar to Wright, whose unique style has been explained in many ways. Wright's provincial status and ties to the [[Lunar Society]], a group of prominent industrialists, scientists and intellectuals who met regularly in Birmingham between 1765 and 1813, have been highlighted, as well as his close association with and sympathy for the advances made in the burgeoning [[Industrial Revolution]]. Other critics have emphasised a desire to capture a snapshot of the society of the day, in the tradition of William Hogarth but with a more neutral stance that lacks the biting satire of Hogarth's work.&lt;ref name="DS3"&gt;Solkin 1994, p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[File:coltman.jpg|thumb|left|Mr and Mrs Thomas Coltman may have been the model for the two lovers.]]
The scientific subjects of Wright's paintings from this time were meant to appeal to the wealthy scientific circles in which he moved. While never a member himself, he had strong connections with the [[Lunar Society]]: he was friends with members John Whitehurst and Erasmus Darwin, as well as [[Josiah Wedgwood]], who later commissioned paintings from him.&lt;ref name="Paintings"&gt;Harrison 2006, p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt; The inclusion of the moon in the painting was a nod to their monthly meetings, which were held when the moon was full. Like ''The Orrery'', Wright apparently painted ''Air Pump'' without a commission, and the picture was purchased by Dr [[Benjamin Bates]], who already owned Wright's ''Gladiator''. An Aylesbury physician, patron of the arts and hedonist, Bates was a diehard member of the [[Hellfire Club]] who, despite his excesses, lived to be over 90. Wright's account book shows a number of prices for the painting: P&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;£200 is shown in one place and £210 in another, but Wright had written to Bates asking for £130, stating that the low price "might much injure me in the future sale of my pictures, and when I send you a receipt for the money I shall acknowledge a greater sum."&lt;ref&gt;Nicolson 1968, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Whether Bates ever paid the full amount is not recorded; Wright only notes in his account book that he received £30 in part payment.&lt;ref name="N235"&gt;Nicolson 1968, p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Joseph Wright of Derby. An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump. Detail.child.jpg|thumb|Detail of the painting]]

Wright exhibited the painting at the [[Society of Artists of Great Britain|Society of Artists]] exhibition in 1768 and it was re-exhibited before [[Christian VII of Denmark]] in September the same year. Viewers remarked that it was "clever and vigorous",&lt;ref name="Eg" /&gt; while [[Gustave Flaubert]], who saw it on a visit to England in 1865–66, considered it "charmant de naïveté et profondeur".&lt;ref name="Egerton 1998, p. 340"/&gt; It was popular enough that a mezzotint was engraved from it by [[Valentine Green]] which was published by [[John Boydell]] on 24 June 1769,&lt;ref name="N235" /&gt; and initially sold for 15 [[British shilling coin|shillings]]. This was reprinted throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, in increasingly weak impressions.&lt;ref&gt;Egerton 1998, p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt; Ellis Waterhouse called it "one of the wholly original masterpieces of British art".&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, 1978, 286.&lt;/ref&gt;

From Bates, the picture passed to Walter Tyrell; another member of the Tyrell family, Edward, presented it to the [[National Gallery (London)|National Gallery]], London, in 1863, after it had failed to sell at an auction at [[Christie's]] in 1854. The painting was transferred to the [[Tate Gallery]] in 1929, although it was actually on loan to [[Derby Museum and Art Gallery]] between 1912 and 1947. It has been lent out for exhibitions to the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, D.C. in 1976, the [[Nationalmuseum|National Museum of Fine Arts]] in Stockholm in 1979–1980, and Paris ([[Galeries nationales du Grand Palais|Grand Palais]]), New York ([[Metropolitan Museum of Art|Metropolitan]]) and the Tate in London in 1990. It was reclaimed by the National Gallery from the Tate in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Egerton 1998, 332. "Egerton (1990)" is the catalogue for the 1990 exhibition ''Wright of Derby'' in London, Paris and New York.&lt;/ref&gt; They describe its condition as good, with minor alterations visible on some figures. It was last cleaned in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Egerton 1998, p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt;

The striking scene has been used as the cover illustration for many books on topics both artistic and scientific. It has even spawned pastiches and parodies: the book cover of ''[[The Science of Discworld]]'', by [[Terry Pratchett]], [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]] and [[Jack Cohen (scientist)|Jack Cohen]], is a tribute to the painting by artist [[Paul Kidby]], who replaces Wright's figures with the book's protagonists. [[Shelagh Stephenson]]'s play ''[[An Experiment with an Air Pump]]'', inspired by the painting, was the joint winner of the 1997 [[Peggy Ramsay|Margaret Ramsay Award]] and had its premiere at the [[Royal Exchange, Manchester|Royal Exchange Theatre]], Manchester, in 1998.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2042">'''Artcirq''' is an [[Inuit]] [[circus]] performance collective based in [[Igloolik]], [[Nunavut]], Canada.  It was co-founded in 1998 by [[Guillaume Saladin]] and several circus artists from Montreal and youth from Igloolik, with the financial support of [[Igloolik Isuma Productions]], Canada's first Inuit independent production company and [[Cirque Éloize]]. Its activities provide Inuit youth with a vehicle for creative expression that maintains strong links to Inuit traditions and performance styles.

Artcirq members blend techniques of modern circus arts such as [[acrobatics]], [[juggling]], and [[clowning]] with traditional Inuit cultural practices including [[Inuit traditional games]], [[Inuit throat singing|throat singing]], and [[Inuit music|drum dancing]] to create meaningful and original work through performing arts, music, and video.

Artcirq has been invited to perform across the globe from Mexico to Greece to Timbuktu, including the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympic Games Opening Ceremony and Queen Elizabeth's Diamond Jubilee pageant in Windsor Castle. The collective has produced numerous short films as well as three albums: ''Artcirq Jam'', ''Made In Igloolik'', and ''Kikkukia''. The documentary film ''Circus Without Borders'', produced by Northern Light Productions, features Artcirq's story.

Most recently, Artcirq members have been coordinating an extra-curricular community arts program for youth at its Black Box studio in Igloolik. It is through these projects that Artcirq enables Inuit artists to express and redefine themselves together in their changing world.

'''Artists Rights Society''' (ARS) is a copyright, licensing, and monitoring organization for visual artists in the United States. Founded in 1987, ARS is a member of the [[ International Confederation of Societies of Authors and Composers]] and as such represents in the United States the intellectual property rights interests of over 60,000 visual artists and estates of visual artists from around the world (painters, sculptors, photographers, architects and others).

The long list of the artists represented by ARS includes such names as [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Georges Braque]], [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Constantin Brâncuși]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Henry Darger]], [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Max Ernst]], [[Alberto Giacometti]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Paul Klee]], [[Le Corbusier]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[René Magritte]], [[Joan Miró]], [[Edvard Munch]], [[Man Ray]], [[Andy Warhol]], [[Salvador Dalí]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], [[Diego Rivera]] and [[Frida Kahlo]], among many others.&lt;ref name="list1"&gt;[http://www.arsny.com/new-page-3/ "Most Frequently Requested ARS Member Artists"]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to estates, ARS represents many living artists, including [[Damien Hirst]], [[Judy Chicago]], [[Jenny Holzer]], [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Richard Serra]], [[Hans Haacke]], [[Jim Dine]], [[Robert Indiana]], [[Robert Irwin (artist)|Robert Irwin]], [[Brice Marden]], [[Dorothea Rockburne]], [[Mark Tobey]], and [[Bruce Nauman]], among others.&lt;ref name="list2"&gt;[https://www.arsny.com/searchartists// "Browse Complete List of ARS Member Artists"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Infringement and advocacy ==
In 2002 and 2006, ARS asked [[Google]] to remove customised versions of its logo put up to commemorate artists [[Salvador Dalí]] and Joan Miró, alleging that portions of specific artworks under their protection had been used in the logos, and that they were utilized without permission. According to Theodore Feder, president of ARS, "there are underlying copyrights to the works of Miró, and they are putting it up without having the rights."&lt;ref name="miro"&gt;[http://www.siliconbeat.com/entries/2006/04/20/google_takes_down_miro_image.html "Google takes down Miro image." ''Silicon Beat'' April 20, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; Google complied with the request, but denied that there was any violation of copyright. 

Since 2008, ARS and Google have worked together to produce customized versions of Google's logo{{cn|date=February 2015}} to commemorate ARS member artists, Marc Chagall (2008), René Magritte (2008) and Jackson Pollock (2009). &lt;ref name="chagall"&gt;[https://www.google.com/holidaylogos.html Google.com: More Google Logos]&lt;/ref&gt;  

In June 2008, ARS president Theodore Feder, with artist [[Frank Stella]], wrote an Op-Ed for ''The Art Newspaper'' decrying a proposed U.S. [[orphan works]] law. &lt;ref name="artnews"&gt;[http://www.theartnewspaper.com/article.asp?id=8580 ''The Art Newspaper'' "The proposed new law is a nightmare for artists" by Frank Stella. June 6, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2008, ARS worked with the Illustrator's Partnership of America (IPA) and the Advertising Photographers of America (APA) to submit to congress a document titled, "Suggested Amendments to H.R. 5889: Orphan Works Act of 2008."&lt;ref name="ipa1"&gt;[http://ipaorphanworks.blogspot.com/2008/07/hr-5889-amendments.html Illustrators' Partnership Orphan Works Blog: "H.R. 5889 Amendments" June 11, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; The document outlined 12 amendments which the ARS, IPA and APA believe will decrease the potential negative impact of the [[Orphan Works]] Act and discourage "wide-scale infringements of visual art while depriving creators of protections currently available under the [[Copyright Act of 1976|Copyright Act]]."&lt;ref name="ipa2"&gt;[http://capwiz.com/illustratorspartnership/home/ Orphan Works Legislative Action Center]&lt;/ref&gt; ARS has joined over 60 other art licensing businesses (including the [[Association of American Editorial Cartoonists]], [[Society of Children's Book Writers and Illustrators]] and the [[Stock Artists Alliance]], among others) in opposing both The Orphan Works Act of 2008 and The Shawn Bentley Orphan Works Act of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ASIP Home|url = http://capwiz.com/illustratorspartnership/issues/bills/?billid=11320236|website = capwiz.com|accessdate = 2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ipa2"/&gt;

'''Baren''' (馬連、馬楝) ''{{Audio|Baren.ogg|listen}}'' is a disk-like hand tool with a flat bottom and a knotted handle used in [[Japanese woodblock printing]]. It is used to burnish (firmly rub) the back of a sheet of paper, lifting ink from the block.
  
==Construction==
[[File:Coiled_cord_for_a_baren.gif|thumb|upright=0.8|A coiled braided cord forms the core of the baren]]
[[File:Baren2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Finishing the wrapping by pressing the baren down firmly with the left hand to tighten the wrapping and twisting the sheath with the right hand to form a handle.]]
The baren is made of layers.  A flat coil of [[braid]]ed cord forms the core. This is placed on a disk (''ategawa'') consisting of 30–40 sheets of high-grade long-fibred hosokawa paper, wrapped in tissue and black [[lacquer]]. This is covered by a thin bamboo sheath (''takenokawa'') twisted in such a manner as to form the handle on the top.&lt;ref name="McGregorIshida2016"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dr. Mark McGregor|author2=Mariko Ishida|title=Ukiyo-e: Secrets of the floating world|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aPbIDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT50|date=23 April 2016|publisher=Vyiha Publishing|isbn=978-988-13004-3-0|pages=50–}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Hiroshi Yoshida]]'s manual ''Japanese Woodblock Printing'' (1939) the ''[[Phyllostachys bambusoides|madake]]'' species of bamboo, grown in Kyushu, southwest Japan, is considered the best one to use.&lt;ref name=hiroshi&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Hiroshi Yoshida|author=Hiroshi Yoshida|title=Japanese Wood-block Printing|year=1939|publisher= Sanseido Company, Tokyo and Osaka}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bamboo-sheath covering the baren may need to be renewed after a day's printing.  Rewrapping requires great skill; a printer's ability is sometimes judged by their competence carrying out this work.&lt;ref name=hiroshi /&gt;

The disk inside the baren takes 40–50 days to create, as the craftsman glues one sheet of paper on the disk each day.  The disk must then dry for a year before the baren is assembled.  The coil and covering of the baren are woven and formed from parts of the bamboo plant, requiring the skill of a true master. Only one known person in Japan is still making traditional (''hon'') baren for a living — Hidehiko Goto of the Kikuhide workshop.

==Alternatives==
Large wooden spoons are also used as burnishing tools in printmaking, glass jars with a smooth circular base can also be used for some applications. Some new world barens are similar in shape to the traditional one with small metal ball bearings embedded in the bottom surface that generate the high point contact pressures (supplied by the braided cord) and have the low friction (offered by the bamboo leaf covering) of a traditional brayer.  Another interesting baren is one developed by Professor Seishi Ozakus and made from a bundle of bamboo toothpicks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepage.usask.ca/~nis715/S%20Ozakus.htm Professor Seishi Ozakus' Toothpick Baren]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nik Semenoff has developed a palm press that serves as a baren replacement, made with a number of roller bearings alternating on two close spaced shafts in a small hand held mounting.  The bearings have negligible friction and the pressures achievable are suitable for some [[Offset printing|offset]] [[lithography]] printing, though wider spacing of fewer contact points may make it less suited for traditional wood cut printing.

This '''bibliography of Donald Trump''' is a list of written and published works, by and about [[Donald Trump]], [[List of Presidents of the United States|45th]] [[President of the United States]]. Prior to his [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|2016 campaign for U.S. president]], Trump was already the focus of [[bibliography|many books]] describing his life as a businessman and politician.&lt;ref name=stewart&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/27/books/review/never-enough-donald-trump-and-the-pursuit-of-success-by-michael-dantonio.html|title=Sunday Book Review: 'Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success,' by Michael D’Antonio|date=September 10, 2015|first=James B.|last=Stewart|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=June 18, 2017|quote=published sources, which are voluminous, considering that Trump’s every move has been chronicled by the media and that he’s already the subject of a substantial bibliography, not to mention his 10 autobiographical and self-help books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Works written by Trump himself include [[self-help book]]s, [[personal finance]] books, political policy treatises, and [[autobiography|autobiographies]].&lt;ref name=stewart /&gt;&lt;ref name=lozada&gt;{{citation|first=Carlos|last=Lozada|access-date=June 18, 2017|work=[[The Washington Post]]|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/book-party/wp/2015/07/30/i-just-binge-read-eight-books-by-donald-trump-heres-what-i-learned/|date=July 30, 2015|title=I just binge-read eight books by Donald Trump.

''[[The Washington Post]]'' journalist Carlos Lozada observed that a continuous theme throughout Trump's written works is a focus on Trump himself, such as citing examples from his business in [[real estate investing]] and work on television.&lt;ref name=lozada /&gt; Parties and individuals discussed in books by Trump are reduced to a [[zero-sum game]], with Lozada writing: "Trump’s world is [[Splitting (psychology)|binary, divided into class acts and total losers]]."&lt;ref name=lozada /&gt; Trump often makes use of [[hyperbole]] to illustrate his points in his works.&lt;ref name=lozada /&gt; In other books, Trump repeats the same stories of what he views as key successes from his business career; for example, a tale about a 1980s business deal improving the [[Wollman Rink]] in [[Central Park]], New York.&lt;ref name=lozada /&gt; Trump's published writings shifted post-2000, from generally memoirs about himself to books giving advice about finance.&lt;ref name=lozada /&gt;

The amount of coverage in published written works about Trump over time is due to his fame prior to his 2016 presidential campaign.&lt;ref name=stewart /&gt; Biographer [[Michael D'Antonio]] observed in ''[[Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success]]'' (2015) that Trump "has been a topic of conversation in America for almost 40 years. No one in the world of business&amp;nbsp;– not Bill Gates, Steve Jobs or Warren Buffett&amp;nbsp;– has been as famous as Trump for as long."&lt;ref name=stewart /&gt; Almost one year after his inauguration as president, ''[[The Guardian]]'' noted that more than 4,500 English-language books about Trump had been published since he took office, compared to just over 800 works about predecessor [[Barack Obama]] during his first year in office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Madigan|first1=Andrew|title=After the Fire and Fury: what's next for books about Trump?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/17/books-about-trump-fire-and-fury|work=The Guardian|date=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the sheer volume of books about Trump, the titles listed here are limited to non-fiction books about Trump or his presidency, published by notable authors and scholars. Tertiary sources (including textbooks and juvenile literature), satire, and self-published books are excluded.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2053">'''Books of secrets''' were compilations of technical and medicinal recipes and magic formulae that began to be printed in the sixteenth century and were published continuously down to the eighteenth century.  They constituted one of the most popular genres in early modern scientific publishing.  The books of secrets contained hundreds of medical recipes, household hints, and technical recipes on metallurgy, alchemy, dyeing, making perfume, oil, incense, and cosmetics.  The books of secrets supplied a great deal of practical information to an emerging new, middle-class readership, leading some historians to link them with the emerging secularistic values of the early modern period and to see them as contributing to the making of an ‘age of how-to.’

Some books of secrets, such as [[Alessio Piemontese]]'s famous ''Secreti'' (1555), contained mainly practical and technological information in the form of useful recipes.  Others, such as [[Giambattista Della Porta]]'s ''[[Magia Naturalis]]'' (''Natural Magic'', 1558) deployed practical recipes in an effort to demonstrate the principles of [[natural magic]].  Other books of secrets, such as [[Isabella Cortese|Isabella Cortese's]] ''Secreti'' (1564), disseminated alchemical information to a wide readership.  Recent research has suggested that the books of secrets may have played an important role in the emergence of experimental science by bringing practical technical information to the attention of experimental scientists.&lt;ref&gt;W.

A '''collection manager''' ensures the proper care and preservation of objects within [[cultural institutions]] such as [[museums]], [[libraries]], and [[archives]]. Collection managers, along with [[Registrar (museum)|registrars]], [[curators]], and [[conservator-restorer|conservators]], play an important role in [[collections care]].  Collection Managers and Registrars are two distinct collection roles that are often combined into one within small to mid-size cultural institutions. Collection Managers can be found in large museums and those with a [[history]] and [[natural history]]
focus whose diverse collections require experienced assessment to properly sort, catalog, and store artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Glaser|first=Jane|title=Museums: A Place to Work|date=1996|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, NY|author2=Zenetou, Artemis|isbn=0-415-12724-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; A collection manager may oversee the registrar, archivist, curator, photographer, or other collection professionals, and may assume the responsibilities of these roles in their absence within an organization.&lt;ref&gt;Buck, R., Gilmore, J., ed. (2010). Museum Registration Methods (5 ed.). Washington, D.C.: The AAM Press. {{ISBN|978-1-933253-15-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences between collection managers and registrars==
Collection managers are responsible for the long-term preservation of collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fifield|first=Becky|title=Museum Mondays-What is a Collections Manager?|url=http://thestillroomblog.com/2012/04/23/museum-monday-what-is-a-collections-manager/|work=The Still Room|accessdate=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They oversee the physical care of objects and form the hands-on problem-solving component of a collections team. Collection managers work collaboratively with registrars, who are document-oriented and responsible for risk management of the collection. 
Registrars maintain facility reports, contracts, and legal records associated with acquisitions, inventory, incoming and outgoing loans, shipping, and insurance. They must keep current with national and international regulations and procedures as they work with custom agents and brokers to acquire security, custom permits, insurance coverage, government indemnity, and requests for immunity from judicial seizure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collections Management|url=https://www.mfa.org/collections/conservation-and-collections-care/collections-management|work=Museum of Fine Arts Boston|accessdate=April 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsibilities and duties==
[[File:Storage Gallery.jpg|300px|thumb|left|Storage of Peruvian ceramics at the [[Larco Museum]]]]
Collection managers work in cooperation with curators, registrars, conservators, art handlers, exhibit fabricators, mount makers, facilities managers, security, and housekeeping. They are responsible for establishing and maintaining high standards of collections care, from acquisition to conservation to display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collections Manager|url=http://www.museumsassociation.org/careers/9914|work=Museums Association|accessdate=April 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the institution, collection managers may by tasked with drawing up a departmental budget, providing expenditure projections, and if necessary, raising funds in the form of grant writing.

* '''Acquisition''': During acquisition consideration, the collection manager must research the object, determine its fit within the collection, ensure there are available resources for its care, and in the absence of a registrar, establish the object's [[provenance]]. Once acquired, the collection manager begins the accession process by carefully examining the object and classifying it based on the institution's specific guidelines. [[Categorization|Classification]] terms are drawn from an ordered system of categories and can vary from one institution to another. The purpose of classification is to provide order within a collection by grouping objects with similar characteristics such as form, shape, material, function, use, or social context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Class|url=http://www.vraweb.org/ccoweb/cco/parttwo_chapter7.html|work=Cataloging Cultural Objects Part 2: Chapter 7|accessdate=April 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The object is then given a unique [[Accession number (library science)|identifying number]], tying it to all related records. Next, the object is carefully measured, photographed, and described in a detailed condition report.  
* '''Object Care''': Proper [[collections care]], or preventative conservation, is imperative to the welfare of objects by avoiding and minimizing deterioration and loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Preventative Conservation|url=http://www.icom-cc.org/36/working-groups/preventive-conservation/|work=International Council of Museums-Committee for Conservation|accessdate=April 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collection managers are responsible for proper object handling and for instructing/supervising other staff members, researchers, interns, and volunteers on proper procedures. They monitor the condition and environment of objects in storage and on exhibit,  rotating sensitive objects off exhibit as needed. Collection managers clean and stabilize objects, select appropriate archival supplies, prepare objects for storage and exhibition, and pack and label objects for loan. Collection managers also design and prepare exhibit mounts for delicate objects on display and in storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fruth|first=Marth|title=A Primer on Museum Collection Management|url=http://www.ohiolha.org/how-tos/a-primer-on-museum-collection-management/|work=Ohio Local History Alliance|accessdate=April 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to best utilize storage space, collection managers may need to rehouse and relocate objects within and between museum facilities while closely tracking and documenting all object movement.
* '''Inventory''': A key responsibility of collection managers is performing a detailed inventory of all items in their collection.&lt;ref name="Brunot"&gt;{{cite web|last=Brunot|first=Trudy|title=Job Description of a Museum Collections Manager|url=http://work.chron.com/job-description-museum-collections-manager-18372.html|work=Houston Chronicle|accessdate=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the institution's collection management policy, a complete inventory can be taken every 5–10 years, with spot inventories performed annually. 
* '''Exhibition''': At the request of curators or borrowing institutions, the collection manager retrieves objects from storage and examines them for potential exhibition or loan consideration. After close examination and comparison with prior condition reports, a determination is made regarding the object's current condition, fragility level, special exhibition or shipping requirements, and/or need for conservation. Once objects have been cleared for exhibition or loan, the collection manager cleans and stabilizes them and ensures their safety by monitoring and/or assisting with the exhibit installation and deinstallation. Collection managers may also be tasked with interpretation and case selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collection Manager/Registrar|url=http://berkshiremuseum.org/collections-managerregistrar/|work=Berkshire Museum|accessdate=April 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;    
* '''Database Management''': Collection managers are responsible for documenting object information into their institution's database management system. The proper input and maintenance of this information is imperative. According to the National Park Service, "the information on the catalog records may be as important as the items themselves." &lt;ref name="NPS, 3:1"&gt;{{cite book|last =National Park Service|author-link=National Park Service|title=Museum Handbook, Part II: Museum Collections|year =2000|chapter =Chapter 3: Cataloging"|url=http://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHII/mh2ch3.pdf|accessdate=April 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The minimum amount of information entered into the database should be catalog number, accession number, nature of accession (e.g. gift, purchase), provenance, object name, classification, materials, dimensions, condition, and current location.  Institutions utilize the catalog information to manage their collections, facilitate interdepartmental communications, and make collections available to researchers and the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collection Management Systems: Museums and the Web 2011|url=http://www.idea.org/blog/2011/04/07/collection-management-systems-museums-and-the-web-2011/|work=Institute for Dynaic Educational Advancement|accessdate=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Museum Collection Management Software is determined by the size, collection type, and budget of the institution.
*  '''Environmental Control''': Dust, pests, light exposure, extremes and/or fluctuations in temperature and relative humidity can adversely affect objects. The collection manager, in conjunction with the facilities manager, is responsible for monitoring environmental controls, establishing and maintaining an [[integrated pest management]] system, coordinating a housekeeping routine, and ensuring the security of all objects within the building.
* '''Collection Management Policy''': Collection managers assist with  writing and updating [[collections policy|collection care policies]]. An institution's collection is its greatest asset. As such, they have a legal, ethical, and fiduciary obligation to provide for its safekeeping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collection Management Policies (CMP)|url=http://www.spencerart.ku.edu/collection/collection_management_policies.pdf|work=Spencer Art Museum|accessdate=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Collection management policy is a detailed, written statement that explains why a museum is in operation and how it goes about its business." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Malaro|first=Marie|title=A Legal Primer on Managing Museum Collections|date=2012|publisher=Smithsonian Books|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-1-58834-322-2|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collection management policy guides an institution's decision making and covers a range of topics including collection goals, methods of acquisition and disposal of objects, incoming/outgoing loan policies, care, control, and access to objects, insurance procedures, and record keeping. Some institutions also assign [[emergency management]] (disaster planning) responsibility to collection managers.&lt;ref name="Brunot"/&gt;

==Knowledge, abilities, and skills==
There are specific skills, abilities, and areas of knowledge necessary for collection managers. All collection managers must be skilled in object handling, able to accurately identify objects, artifacts, and specimens within their institution's collection, and have knowledge of preventative conservation methods and procedures. It is essential that collection managers are educated about the organization, arrangement, and nomenclature of objects, artifacts, and specimens in their field of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Glaser|first=Jane|title=Museums: A Place to Work|date=1996|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, NY|pages=75–76|author2=Zenetou, Artemis|isbn=0-415-12724-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collection managers also need to be knowledgeable about collection management software for cataloging and record keeping.

==Education and training (experience)==
Most institutions require collection managers to have an undergraduate degree in their specialty area such as art, history, or archeology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Seversen|first=Dana|title=The Salary of a Museum Collections Manager|url=http://everydaylife.globalpost.com/salary-museum-collections-manager-15479.html|work=Global Post|accessdate=April 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics, from 2012 - 2022 archivists, curators, and museum workers "should expect very strong competition for jobs" with a projected growth rate of only 11 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archivists, Curators, and Museum Workers|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/education-training-and-library/curators-museum-technicians-and-conservators.htm|work=Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this competitive field, a master's degree in the institution's area of focus, museum studies, or library/information science is preferred.

Internships and volunteer work in libraries, museums, and archives is the best way to acquire hands-on collection management experience. Whether paid or unpaid, experience with object/artifact handling, processing, cataloging, preservation, packing, storage, inventory, fabrication, and collection management software is essential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schlatter|first=N. Elizabeth|title=Museum Careers|date=2008|publisher=Left Coast Press|location=Walnut Creek, CA|isbn=978-1-59874-044-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experience or training in conservation would be an added bonus, especially to small museums with limited resources.

==Professional organizations==
There are numerous professional organizations of interest to collection managers and other museum professionals. These organizations provide opportunities to network, share information, and participate in continuing education.

'''Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler''' (25 June 1884 – 11 January 1979) was a German-born art historian, art collector, and one of the most notable [[France|French]] [[art dealer]]s of the 20th century. He became prominent as an art gallery owner in [[Paris]] beginning in 1907 and was among the first champions of [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Georges Braque]] and the [[Cubism|Cubist]] movement in art.&lt;ref name="JR"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=John Richardson (art historian) |first=John |last=Richardson |title=A Life Of Picasso, The Cubist Rebel, 1907-1916 |page=36 |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |date= 1991 |isbn=978-0-307-26665-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Kahnweiler's family moved from [[Rockenhausen]], a small village in the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]], to [[Mannheim]], [[Grand Duchy of Baden|Baden]], where Kahnweiler was born in 1884. His upbringing and education at a German [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] prepared him well for his life as an art connoisseur and pragmatic businessman. Early employment in the family business of [[Stockbroker|stock brokerage]] in Germany and Paris gave way to an interest in art collecting while Kahnweiler was still in his twenties. He opened his first small art gallery (4 by 4 meters) in Paris in 1907 at 28 rue Vignon. There was a family precedent for such an enterprise, since his uncle, who ran a famous stock brokerage house in [[London]], was a major art collector of traditional English art works and furniture.&lt;ref name="JR" /&gt;

==Art dealer==
[[File:Picasso Portrait of Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler 1910.jpg|thumb|[[Pablo Picasso]], 1910, ''[[Portrait of Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]]'', oil on canvas, [[Art Institute of Chicago]]]]
Kahnweiler is considered to have been one of the greatest supporters of the [[Cubism|Cubist]] art movement through his activities as an art dealer and spokesman for artists. He was among the first people to recognize the importance and beauty of Picasso's ''[[Les Demoiselles D'Avignon]]'' and immediately wanted to buy it along with all of Picasso's works. Picasso wrote of Kahnweiler, "What would have become of us if Kahnweiler hadn't had a business sense?" Kahnweiler's appreciation of Picasso's talents was especially gratifying to the artist, since he was largely unknown and destitute at the time when many of his most famous works were created.&lt;ref name="JR" /&gt;

In his gallery, Kahnweiler supported many of the great artists of his time who found themselves without adequate recognition and little or no interest among collectors. Initial purchases included works by [[Kees van Dongen]], [[André Derain]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Georges Braque]], [[Juan Gris]], [[Maurice de Vlaminck]] and several other artists of the same generation. To use his own word, Kahnweiler wanted to "defend" great artists, but only those who had no dealers and whose talents he was convinced of. Rather than exhibiting appealing works by established artists from the past and present, Kahnweiler championed burgeoning artists who had come from all over the globe to live and work in [[Montparnasse]] and [[Montmartre]] at the time. Thus [[Paul Cézanne]], although a great artist, was considered too old to be represented, and his work was already represented by the dealer [[Ambroise Vollard]] in any case.&lt;ref name= "JR" /&gt;

[[File:Kees van Dongen, c.1907-08, Portrait of Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, oil on canvas, 65 x 54 cm.jpg|thumb|[[Kees van Dongen]], c.1907-08, ''Portrait of Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler'', oil on canvas, Musée du Petit Palais, Geneva]]
Along with such men as [[Alfred Flechtheim]], [[Paul Cassirer]], [[Daniel Wildenstein]], [[Léonce Rosenberg]] and [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]], Kahnweiler was one of the influential art connoisseurs of the 20th century. As a businessman, Kahnweiler pioneered many new methods of working with artists and art dealing; these are now established practices in the industry.

In 1907, when there were only half a dozen viable galleries in Paris, he made contracts with artists to buy all of their work in order to free them from financial worries and permit them to concentrate on their creative work. He met with them daily to discuss their work, photographed each work they produced (he felt it imperative to have a record), held exhibitions of their work and promoted their work internationally. Since he considered himself friends with many of them, he co-owned little sailing boats with his artists.

As part of his activities in promoting the work of emerging artists, Kahnweiler sponsored the first exhibition of the work of [[Georges Braque]]. He encouraged the practice of publishing ''Beaux Livres'' (beautiful books), in which a contemporary artist would illustrate a work of a contemporary writer. He expanded his presentations by bringing together artists, writers and poets to produce their works as a joint project in more than 40 books. Picasso, for example, illustrated the works of [[Max Jacob]]. As a publisher of art with literary works, he had no equal, and was the first to sponsor publications by Max Jacob, [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[André Masson]], [[Gertrude Stein]], [[Pablo Picasso]], and many others. In doing so, he launched many literary careers.

Kahnweiler's entrepreneurial abilities were so acute that by the 1950s his art gallery was in the top 100 companies in France in terms of turnover from export.

==Art history==
Although the financial support for artists was an important contribution to art history, he was also a significant figure for his work as an art historian and eyewitness to the emergence of Cubism during the period 1907–1914. When working in Paris, his spare time was devoted to reading and understanding the [[history of art]] and [[aesthetics]]. He also spent his time visiting the city's museums and art galleries. Besides the museums in Paris, he took trips around the European continent to see what was being shown in museums and art galleries outside France. He gave his first interview on Cubism in 1912, and it was actual historical events that led to his career as a historian. There is a view that Kahnweiler's sensibility was such that his gallery, and the way he styled and developed it, was as much a Cubist gallery as were the paintings by Picasso and the other Cubist painters. The gallery had a clear [[aesthetic]] position, uncompromising integrity, financial stability and creative development. During the years 1907-1914 his gallery was a central cradle for Cubism, not only to see the works but where one also met the artists, discussed art and where artists discussed each other's works.

Concurrently, the primary means for avant-garde painters and sculptors to show their works to a wider audience remained the [[Société des Artistes Indépendants|Salon des Indépendants]] and the [[Salon d'Automne]]. Kahnweiler forbade his 'gallery Cubists' from exhibiting at these major Salons,&lt;ref name="Taylor, 2010"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aN9MriMKsE Michael Taylor, 2010, Philadelphia Museum of Art, ''Modern and Contemporary'' 439, Metzinger - ''Tea Time'' (''Woman with a Teaspoon''), 1 Audio Stop 439, Podcast]&lt;/ref&gt; and by doing so actually removed them from the public view. For the general public, Cubism was more associated with the 'Salon Cubists', such as [[Jean Metzinger]],&lt;ref name="Taylor, 2010" /&gt; [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], [[Marcel Duchamp]] and [[Francis Picabia]].&lt;ref name="Edwards, Wood"&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=TU0KwJuBvAsC&amp;pg=PA136&amp;dq=kahnweiler+gallery+cubists+vs+salon+cubists&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiH2On2m9zTAhUH8RQKHfhJDpwQ6AEINDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=kahnweiler%20gallery%20cubists%20vs%20salon%20cubists&amp;f=false Steve Edwards, Paul Wood, ''Art of the Avant-gardes''], Yale University Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0300102305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War I and World War II==
[[File:Juan Gris Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler 1921.jpg|thumb|right|Pencil drawing of Kahnweiler by [[Juan Gris]], 1921, [[Musée National d'Art Moderne]], Paris]]
The outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914 not only ruptured the Cubist experiments in art, but also forced Kahnweiler to live in exile in [[Switzerland]]; due to his German citizenship, he was considered an [[Alien (law)|alien]] under French law. Many German nationals living in France had their possessions sequestered by the French state, and as a result, Kahnweiler's collection was confiscated in 1914 and sold by the government in a series of auctions at the [[Hôtel Drouot]] between 1921 and 1923.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Gee, Dealers, Critics and Collectors of Modern Painting; Aspects of the Parisian Art Market Between 1910 and 1930, Courtauld PhD Dissertation 1977, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15324coll18/id/45980 Kahnweiler collection: Catalogue des tableaux, aquarelles, gouaches et dessins. Part II,  Hôtel Drouot, Paris, November 17-18, 1921]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the years of exile (until 1920), Kahnweiler studied and wrote works such as the ''Der Weg Zum Kubismus'' and ''Confessions esthétiques''. Writing becoming a passion he continued over his lifetime, and he authored hundreds of books and major articles. The second period of enforced writing came during a period of internal exile caused by the events of [[World War II]].  As a [[Jew]], the [[Nazi]]s forced him to flee Paris. He remained in France in hiding. "Under the clouds from the [[gas chamber]]s," as he put it, he wrote his seminal work on [[Juan Gris]].

==At the end==
Kahnweiler was very prolific as an author, but never produced a full autobiography. There was, however, a series of interviews first aired on French television, then published and translated as a book under the title ''Mes galleries et mes peintres'' ("my galleries and my painters". For his 80th birthday, a ''[[Festschrift]]'' was published with contributions by the world's leading philosophers, art historians, and artists, all of whom emphasized the vital importance of his unique contribution to art history – an importance still not yet fully appreciated, probably due to the fact that he has been viewed mostly as an art dealer and not as an [[art historian]]. This situation has been aggravated because some of his major works on [[aesthetics]] were either never translated into English or badly translated. The omission of key elements of a proper understanding of Cubism and focus on small and sensational elements of his complex relationship with Picasso has led to a flawed understanding of the ideas he put forward in these writings.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Although revered by artists for his business and aesthetic sense and respected by art dealers and art historians, the true impact of his life and work has yet to be recognized, despite a recent biography by [[Pierre Assouline]]. He died in 1979 in Paris aged 94.

'''Deste Foundation, Centre for Contemporary Art''' is an arts [[Foundation (nonprofit organization)|foundation]] in [[Nea Ionia]], a northern suburb of [[Athens]], [[Greece]]. Housing the art collection of Greek businessman [[Dakis Joannou]], it organizes exhibitions with the collection and commissions new work by emerging and established international contemporary artists. 

== Origin ==
The Deste Foundation was established in 1983 by [[Dakis Joannou]], with the purpose of exploring the relationship between contemporary art and contemporary culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artfacts.net/index.php/pageType/instInfo/inst/2529/contentType/news//nID/2906/lang/1 www.artfacts.net]&lt;/ref&gt;
Deste means "to see" (δέστε) in the [[Greek language]]. Between 1983 and 1996, when the foundation did not yet have a permanent exhibition space, the shows that took place in Athens were hosted at the House of Cyprus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://deste.gr/about/ About the foundation] Deste Foundation, Athens.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 the DESTE Foundation moved to its first permanent space, a former paper factory in [[Neo Psychiko]] redesigned by American architect Christian Hubert.&lt;ref&gt;[http://deste.gr/about/ About the foundation] Deste Foundation, Athens.&lt;/ref&gt; Built as a sock factory in 1931, the foundation's current building was renovated by architect Christos Papoulias in 2006.

== Activities ==
At the Deste Foundation, overviews of the Dakis Collection have been presented by curators like [[Massimiliano Gioni]] and [[Jeffrey Deitch]].&lt;ref&gt;James Reid (June 19, 2013), [http://www.wallpaper.com/art/dakis-joannous-art-collection-goes-on-show-at-the-deste-foundation-athens/6582 Dakis Joannou's art collection goes on show at the Deste Foundation, Athens] ''[[Wallpaper (magazine)|Wallpaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;Carol Vogel (September 24, 2009), [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/25/arts/design/25vogel.html Jeff Koons Tries Hand as Guest Curator] ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; every summer the foundation organizes a series of contemporary art exhibitions on the island of [[Hydra (island)]], with works on show there in a former slaughterhouse.&lt;ref&gt;Gareth Harris (January 9, 2014), [http://theartnewspaper.com/articles/Athens-institutions-partner-up-to-show-international-contemporary-art/31549 Athens institutions partner up to show international contemporary art] ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kevin McGarry (August 3, 2011), [http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/03/art-odyssey/ Art Odyssey] ''[[T: The New York Times Style Magazine]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, [[Pawel Althamer]] turned the exhibition space into a toy house, with puppets resembling his and his patron’s family members, down to hair styles and tattoos. The puppets of Joannou and his wife, Lietta, sat in a red mini armchair.&lt;ref&gt;Katya Kazakina (June 27, 2014), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-27/greek-tycoons-host-fetes-where-art-markets-are-built.html Greek Tycoon Host Slaughterhouse Fete as Art Markets Made] ''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  

For the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] in Athens, the foundation organized a show that featured the work of more than 60 artists from Joannou’s collection. He chartered a plane from [[Art Basel]] that year for collectors, curators, dealers and artists as part of the cultural program around the Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;Katya Kazakina (June 27, 2014), [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-27/greek-tycoons-host-fetes-where-art-markets-are-built.html Greek Tycoon Host Slaughterhouse Fete as Art Markets Made] ''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Beginning in 2009, the foundation has collaborated with the Athens-based [[Goulandris Museum of Cycladic Art]], co-organizing an annual exhibition of works by artists shortlisted for the biannual Deste contemporary art prize. In 2010, the [[New Museum of Contemporary Art]] in New York showcased the foundation's collection in a three-story exhibition, with [[Jeff Koons]] as the guest curator.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Sontag and Robin Pogrebin (November 10, 2009), [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/11/arts/design/11museum.html Some Object as Museum Shows Its Trustee’s Art] ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the foundation launched a series of contemporary art shows under a new partnership with the [[Benaki Museum]] in Athens, known for its collection of ancient Greek and Roman art.&lt;ref&gt;Gareth Harris (January 9, 2014), [http://theartnewspaper.com/articles/Athens-institutions-partner-up-to-show-international-contemporary-art/31549 Athens institutions partner up to show international contemporary art] ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Most exhibitions have publications to support the learning remit of the foundation.

In 1903, it was bought by the Shearith Israel congregation and converted to serve as a [[Jewish synagogue]], which it was until 1958.&lt;ref name="nrhpdoc"&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=69000041}}|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Emmanuel Shearith Israel Chapel / Emmanuel Episcopal Chapel |publisher=[[National Park Service]]|accessdate=1 July 2016 |author=Robert Fink |date=October 23, 1969 }} with {{NRHP url|id=69000041|photos=y|title=Two photos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Esther Shalev-Gerz''' (born Gilinsky) is a [[contemporary artist]]. She lives and works in [[Paris]], [[London]] and [[New York City]].

==Biography==

Esther Shalev-Gerz was born in [[Vilnius]], [[Lithuania]]. In 1957, she moved with her family to [[Jerusalem]], [[Israel]].

From 1975 to 1979 she studied [[Fine arts]] at the [[Bezalel Academy of Art and Design]] where she got her [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]]. She then lived in New York City for one year (1980/81).

From 1981 she participated in collective exhibitions in institutions such as the [[Israel Museum]] in Jerusalem and the [[Tel Aviv Museum of Art]].

In 1983 she produced her first work in public space: ''Oil on Stone'', a permanent installation in [[Tel Hai]], Israel, for the Tel Hai Contemporary Art Meeting.

In 1984 the artist moved to Paris and started working through Europe and Canada.

In 1990 she got an artistic residency from the [[German Academic Exchange Service]] and moved to Berlin for one year.

In 2002 she stayed at the [[IASPIS]] residency in [[Stockholm]], Sweden.

From 2003 to 2014 she taught the Master of Fine Arts students in [[Valand Academy]], [[University of Gothenburg]], Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shalev-gerz.net/?page_id=78 Shalev-Gerz's biography on her website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Her latest major exhibitions were ''Ton Image me Regarde?!'', 2010, in the [[Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume]], Paris, in which ten of her installations were displayed&lt;ref&gt;''Esther Shalev-Gerz'', catalogue of the exhibition ''Ton image me regarde?!'', Jeu de Paume and Fage Editions, {{ISBN|978-2-84975-187-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jeudepaume.org/index.php?page=article&amp;idArt=1124&amp;lieu=7  Jeu de Paume website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Jones, ''I Saw It'', frieze, UK, March, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Matheson, "Esther Shalev-Gerz Ton image me regarde!?", Ciel Variable n°86, Canada, September, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and her retrospective entitled ''Between Telling and Listening'', 2012, in the [[Cantonal Museum of Fine Arts]] in [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]] where she presented 15 of her installations. Besides, her work was the subject of an itinerary personal exhibition in Canada between 2012 and 2014, firstly in the [[Kamloops]] Art Gallery,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kag.bc.ca/2012.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; then in the [[Research#Morris and Helen Belkin Art Gallery|Belkin Art Gallery]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.belkin.ubc.ca/past/esther-shalev-gerz]&lt;/ref&gt; UBC, [[Vancouver]] and finally in the Galerie de l'UQAM, Montreal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://galerie.uqam.ca/en/exhibitions/past/2014.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 she received a three-year grant  from the [[Swedish Research Council]] for her [[Research#Artistic research|Artistic Research]] project ''Trust and the Unfolding Dialogue''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.valand.gu.se/english/research/ Valand website, Artistic Research page]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 was released the illustrated anthology ''Esther Shalev-Gerz, The Contemporary Art of Trusting Uncertainties and Unfolding Dialogues''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ideabooks.nl/9789198087475-esther-shalev-gerz-the-contemporary-art-of-trusting-uncertainties-and-unfolding-dialogues]&lt;/ref&gt; edited by [[Jason E. Bowman]] that gathers new texts around Shalev-Gerz's work and the notion of Trust as well as formerly published texts on her art. Among the authors are [[Jacques Rancière]], [[Georges Didi-Huberman]], [[Jacqueline Rose]], [[James E. Young]], [[Lisa Le Feuvre]].

In 2014 her team is one of the six finalists of the competition for the design of the Canadian National Holocaust Monument in Ottawa, with the teams of [[Yael Bartana]], [[Daniel Libeskind]], [[Krzysztof Wodiczko]], [[David Adjaye]] or [[Gilles Saucier]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadianarchitect.com/news/six-finalist-teams-for-national-holocaust-monument-announced/1002679111/?&amp;er=NA]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the Fonds municipal d'art contemporain of the city of [[Geneva]] acquired the artwork ''Les Inséparables'', 2000-2010, a monumental double-clock installed as a permanent work in public space.

==Work overview==

Esther Shalev-Gerz questions the perpetual construction of the relationship between an experience and the telling one gives of it. She analyses portraiture, which she understands as the reflection of a person, place or event. Her work invites the spectator to an opening to the ambiguities and multiplicities acting in the collective memory. Her installations, photography, video and public sculpture are developed through dialogue, consultation and negotiation with people whose participation provides an emphasis to their individual and collective memories, accounts, opinions and experiences. Constantly inquiring into transitional qualities of time and space and the correlative transformation of identities, locales and (hi)stories Esther Shalev-Gerz has produced a body of work that simultaneously records, critiques, and contributes to the understandings of the societal roles and value of artistic practice.&lt;ref&gt;Esther Shalev-Gerz, ''Listening Voices: On Actualizing Memories'' in ''Cultures and Globalization: Heritage, Memory and Identity'' by Helmut Anheir and Raj Isar, SAGE publications Ltd, London, United Kingdom, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In her text entitled ''The Perpetual Movement of Memory'', Shalev-Gerz describes her practice: "In my works in the public realm, a space is constructed for memories activated by participation, that is to say, the moment when the supposed spectator becomes a participant by writing his name, using his voice or sending in his photo. Thanks to the traces left during this acts, these participants keep the memory of their own participation in the work’s procedure, which also bears witness to their responsibility to their own times."&lt;ref&gt;in ''Geht dein Bild mich an?/Does Your Image Reflect Me?'', Sprengel-Museum, Hannover, Germany, 2002, p.87&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with [[Marta Gili]], director of the Jeu de Paume, Shalev-Gerz adds: "I try to enter the space that opens between listening and telling in order to get away from the logic of discourse, that is to say, to accede to another kind of space and consider it artistically. It’s a kind of "reveal" of the intelligibility of the sensible/sensitive or of a memory that differs from the one constructed by words, akin to concepts that traverse the body, able to be picked up by the gaze."&lt;ref&gt;in ''Esther Shalev-Gerz'', catalogue of the exhibition ''Ton image me regarde?!'', Jeu de Paume and Fage Editions, p.155&lt;/ref&gt;

And also: "As an artist, it is very important for me to trust the participants – whom I approach (right away) as equals, and whose contributions are an element of the project. I think that this is what makes it possible to produce the work: trust in the other person’s intelligence."&lt;ref&gt;in ''Esther Shalev-Gerz'', catalogue of the exhibition ''Ton image me regarde?!'', Jeu de Paume and Fage Editions, p.157&lt;/ref&gt;

In his text entitled ''The Image of the Other'', in the catalogue of the exhibition ''Does Your Image Reflect Me?'' [[Ulrich Krempel]] provides his understanding of Shalev-Gerz’ work: "One thing is certain: only by talking and listening, passing on first-hand experience, images, emotional glances and moments, can we bring ourselves to the point where remembrance is converted into action".&lt;ref&gt;in ''Geht dein Bild mich an?/Does Your Image Reflect Me?'', Sprengel-Museum, Hannover, Germany, 2002, p.85&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Rancière]] in his text ''The Work of the Image'', for the catalogue of ''MenschenDinge/The Human Aspect of Objects'', republished in the catalogue of the Jeu de Paume show, described the artist’s work in these words: "Esther Shalev-Gerz does not give voice to the witnesses of the past or of elsewhere, but to researchers that are at work in the here and now. She makes the ones who come from elsewhere speak of the present as they do of the past, of here as of there. She makes them speak about the way they have thought and arrange the relationship between one place and another, one time and another. But also the dispositifs that she constructs are themselves dispositifs that distend their words, and subject them to representation of the conditions governing their listening and uttering."&lt;ref&gt;in ''Esther Shalev-Gerz'', catalogue of the exhibition ''Ton image me regarde?!'', Jeu de Paume and Fage Editions, p.139&lt;/ref&gt;

==Some projects and exhibitions==

* ''Monument Against fascism'', [[Hamburg]], Germany, 1986. Esther Shalev-Gerz developed with [[Jochen Gerz]] this permanent installation via an international competition organized by the city.  They erected in a public square a column clad in lead beside which they provided a metal pencil and a panel with the following text translated in seven languages (English, French, German, Russian, Turkish, Arabic and Hebrew):
"We invite the citizens of [[Harburg, Hamburg|Harburg]], and visitors to the town, to add their names here to ours. In doing so we commit ourselves to remain vigilant. As more and more names cover this 12 metre-high lead column, it will gradually be lowered into the ground. One day it will have disappeared completely and the site of the Harburg monument against fascism will be empty. In the long run, it is only we ourselves who can stand up against injustice."

The column was sunk into the ground seven times from 1986 to 1993. All that remains visible are a lead plaque on the ground, the text panel and photos of the different stages.&lt;ref&gt;James E. Young, ''The Counter-Monument: Memory against Itself in Germany Today'', in ''Critical Inquiry'', Vol. 18, No. 2. (Winter, 1992), pp. 267-296&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Justin Branch, ''The Historiography of the Harburg Monument'', University Thesis, Eton College, Windsor, United Kingdom, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Publication by Esther Shalev-Gerz and Jochen Gerz: ''Mahnmal gegen Faschismus'', Cantz/Hatje Verlag Stuttgart, Germany, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shalev-gerz.net/EN/index.html#/selection/monument  Shalev-Gerz's Website, page of the ''Monument Against Fascism'']&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Erase the Past'', Berlin, Germany, 1991. In 1990, during her residency in Berlin and just after the [[Berlin Wall#The Fall|Fall of the Berlin Wall]], Shalev-Gerz received as a present a portrait of [[Honecker]] sold off the street. She realized then this work as a slide series and a book both inspired by the [[Flip book|flipbook]]. In the same room, one can see a portrait of Honecker or a portrait of [[Brecht]]. By flipping the images, one realizes that the portrait resists a zoom movement as it keeps the same size when the walls and furnitures shrink or enlarge.&lt;ref&gt;Catalogue: ''Erase the Past'', DAAD editions, Berlin, Germany, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shalev-gerz.net/EN/index.html#/selection/erasethepast  Shalev-Gerz's Website, page of ''Erase The Past'']&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Irreparable'', Musée de [[La Roche-sur-Yon]], France, 1996. In her first solo show in France, Shalev-Gerz presented her photographic series ''Irreparable'' as well as 15 other slideshows such as ''Just One Sky'', ''Homage to [[Lucy Schwob]]'' or ''Sea of Stones''.&lt;ref&gt;Catalogue by Esther Shalev-Gerz: ''Irréparable'', Musée de la Roche-sur-Yon, France, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shalev-gerz.net/EN/index.html#/selection/irreparable   Shalev-Gerz's Website, page of ''Irreparable'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shalev-gerz.net/EN/index.html#/selection/justeunciel  Shalev-Gerz's Website, page of ''Just One Sky'']&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''The Berlin Inquiry'', Berlin, Germany, 1998. She created with Jochen Gerz this interpretation of [[Peter Weiss]]’ play ''[[The Investigation (play)|Die Ermittlung'']], 1965. Weiss’ play is composed with testimonies of victims, perpetrators, judges and witnesses in the Auschwitz trials. The artists’ interpretation undermined the conventional distinctions between witnesses and actors by having the work performed by the audience. Over the five sold-out performances held in three theatres, Hebbel Theatre Berlin, Berliner Ensemble, Volksbühne am Rosa Luxemburg Platz, the course of each evening was determined by co-participation. Serving only as moderators, each theatre’s company of actors would invite attendees (individually, as a group, a musical choir or as a crowd) to recite passages from the text, so that every spectator became an actor. Not simply a recalling, the collective participatory qualities of ''The Berlin Inquiry'' rendered passive witnessing impossible and in permanently lit auditoria new forms of memory and remembrance were authored.&lt;ref&gt;Publication by Esther Shalev-Gerz and Jochen Gerz: ''Die Berliner Ermittlung'', Hebbel-Theater, Berlin, Germany, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Die Berliner Ermittlung von Jochen Gerz und Esther Shalev-Gerz'' in Theater als Öffentlicher ''Raum, Christel Weiler, ''Spielen in Auschwitz'', in Theater der Zeit, Germany, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shalev-gerz.net/EN/index.html#/selection/berlin  Shalev-Gerz's Website, page of the ''Berlin Inquiry'']&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''The Portraits of Stories'', 1998 to 2008. Esther Shalev-Gerz developed for this project a video and photo series. In [[Aubervilliers]], north of Paris, in Belzunce, a neighbourhood of [[Marseille]], in [[Skoghall]], Sweden and in [[Sandwell]], United Kingdom, she asked the participants in her project "What story must be told today?" Then they would decide where and how they wanted to be filmed and they would tell the story of their choice. More than 200 people answered this question. Each installation was shown in the city where it was conceived. In 2008 an exhibition displaying all the interviews was held in England.&lt;ref&gt;Publication by Esther Shalev-Gerz: ''Les Portraits des Histoires – Aubervilliers'', Editions ENSBA, France, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Publication by Esther Shalev-Gerz: ''Les Portraits des Histoires – Belsunce'', Editions Images en Manoeuvres, Marseille, France, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shalev-gerz.net/EN/index.html#/selection/portraitsaubervilliers  Shalev-Gerz's Website, page of the ''Portraits of Stories'', Aubervilliers]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shalev-gerz.net/EN/index.html#/selection/portraitsmarseille  Shalev-Gerz's Website, page of the ''Portraits of Stories'', Marseille]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shalev-gerz.net/EN/index.html#/selection/portraitsskoghall   Shalev-Gerz's Website, page of the ''Portraits of Stories'', Skoghall]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shalev-gerz.net/EN/index.html#/selection/portraitssandwell   Shalev-Gerz's Website, page of the ''Portraits of Stories'', Sandwell]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Inseparable Angels: The Imaginary House of Walter Benjamin'', 2000. This installation comprises a video of the artist’s taxi ride between Weimar and Buchenwald, a series of photographs and two objects: a double-chair and a clock that has two faces – one showing time going forwards, the other backwards.&lt;ref&gt;Catalogue: ''Två installationer/Two Installations'', History Museum, Stockholm, Sweden, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stefanie Heckmann, ''Spurensuche mit Engel'', in Berliner Zeitung, Germany n¡44, February 21st, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katrin Bettina Müller, ''Engel im Gepäck'', in Der Tagesspiegel, Germany, n°17, February 24th, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shalev-gerz.net/EN/#/selection/inseparable   Shalev-Gerz's Website, page of ''Inseparable Angels'']&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''White Out: Between Telling and Listening'', Stockholm, 2002. During her researches Shalev-Gerz found out that there was no word war in the [[Sami people|Sami]] language and that in parallel to that fact, Sweden had not participated in any war for over 200 years. Two screens facing each other show the same person. On one screen Asa Simma, a woman of dual culture, Sami and Swedish, speaks in her Stockholm apartment. On another video facing this one, she is in the landscape where she was born, in the North of Sweden, listening to her own words recorded in Stockholm.&lt;ref&gt;Catalogue: ''Två installationer/Two Installations'', History Museum, Stockholm, Sweden, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shalev-gerz.net/EN/#/selection/whiteout   Shalev-Gerz's Website, page of ''White Out'']&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Does Your Image Reflect Me?'' 2002, [[Sprengel Museum]], [[Hanover]]. In this work the artist created an encounter between two women who were not far away from each other during World War II. One is German and was living in Hanover, 40&amp;nbsp;km away from the [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]] camp. The other is born in Poland and survived her internment in this very camp. On a photographic series and four screens, one can see each woman twice. As she is telling her story and as she is listening to the story of the other. It is only during the opening of the exhibition that they did really meet.&lt;ref&gt;Catalogue: ''Geht dein Bild mich an? / Does Your Image Reflect Me?'', Sprengel-Museum, Hannover, Germany, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shalev-gerz.net/EN/#/selection/tonimage   Shalev-Gerz's Website, page of ''Does Your Image Reflect Me?'']&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''First Generation'', 2004, Sweden. For this permanent installation, Shalev-Gerz filmed in extreme close-ups the face of each of the 34 people from the first generation of immigrants as she/he listens to her/his answers to the questions: when arriving here, what did you lose? What did you find? What did you get? What did you give? This silent film is visible on the glass façade of the Multicultural Center Botkyrka. One can here their voice by entering the building.&lt;ref&gt;Catalogue: ''First Generation'', Multiculturel Center, Fitja, Sweden, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shalev-gerz.net/EN/#/selection/firstgeneration   Shalev-Gerz's Website, page of ''First Generation'']&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Between Listening and Telling: Last Witnesses, Auschwitz 1945-2005''. In 2005 in commemoration of the liberation of the [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]] camp, Shalev-Gerz designed this project for the [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris]]. In the great Hall of the Hotel de Ville 60 little DVD players arranged on big tables would allow the visitors to watch the testimonies of 60 survivors collected on this occasion. In parallel to these a large silent video triptych was installed on the wall at the end of the hall. On each screen the same video with a 7 seconds lap: a slow motion edition of the moments of silence in the testimonies of the survivors, between the question and the answer, between a memory and a telling.&lt;ref&gt;Carole Boulbès, ''Entre l’écoute et la parole, derniers témoins'', in Art Press, France, n°312, May, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shalev-gerz.net/EN/#/selection/between   Shalev-Gerz's Website, page of ''Between Listening and Telling'']&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''A Thread'', permanent installation, [[Castlemilk]], south of [[Glasgow]]. From 2003 to 2006 Esther Shalev-Gerz developed a project in which ten groups of participants were invited to choose their favourite view in the former park of a castle near their new housing. At each point of view a circular bench was installed thus creating a path through the park.&lt;ref&gt;Publication: ''The Thread'', Aje Aje, in collaboration with CCA, Glasgow, U.K., 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shalev-gerz.net/EN/#/selection/thread   Shalev-Gerz's Website, page of the ''Thread'']&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Menschendinge/The Human Aspect of Objects'', 2006, The [[Buchenwald]] Memorial, Germany. For this project the artist invited 5 persons working in the Memorial to talk about different objects created or adapted by the prisoners. The archaeologist, the historian, the conservator, the director and the photograph tell the reconstructed or imagined stories of these objects in 5 videos and 25 photographs.&lt;ref&gt;Catalogue: ''MenschenDinge'', (The Human Aspect of Objects), Gedenkstätte Buchenwald, Germany, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shalev-gerz.net/EN/#/selection/menschendinge   Shalev-Gerz's Website, page of ''Menschendinge'']&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Daedal(us)'', 2006, [[Dublin]], Ireland. 24 photographs of façades were projected on other buildings of the same neighbourhood after the owners of these buildings agreed for this as well as those who accepted to host a projector during the month the project lasted. Photos of these projections were printed and exhibited.&lt;ref&gt;''Wall to wall and off the beaten track'', in The Irish Times, Wednesday, p. 14, Ireland, February 8th, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Catalogue: ''Daedal(us)'', Fire Station Artists’ Studios, Dublin, Ireland, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shalev-gerz.net/EN/#/selection/daedalus  Shalev-Gerz's Website, page of ''Daedal(us)'']&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''The Place of Art'', 2006, Sweden. "How would you define art?" and "Where does it take place?" Shalev-Gerz collected the answers to these two questions from 38 artists living in the suburb of [[Gothenburg]]. A video was displayed in a shopping centre and four other in the Konsthalle, 7&amp;nbsp;km away from the mall.&lt;ref&gt;Catalogue: ''The Place of Art'', Art monitor, Göteborg University, Sweden, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shalev-gerz.net/EN/#/selection/theplaceofart   Shalev-Gerz's Website, page of the ''Place of Art'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The installation comprises a double HD projection, 24 photographs, a sound work gathering elements of the history of each artwork and his author, 20 glass hammers and 12 original musical composition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wolfsonian.org/explore/exhibitions/describing-labor]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Permanent installations in public space==

*''Oil on Stone'', [[Tel Hai]], [[Israel]], 1983. A sculpture realized from a white Jerusalem stone slab cut into bricks and brought to the Tel Hai hill where it reassembled by the artist as two walls forming a 45° angle without touching each other, so that depending on the point of view one sees a silhouette pointing north or walls fallen into ruins.
* ''Monument Against fascism'', [[Hamburg]], Germany, 1986. Esther Shalev-Gerz developed with [[Jochen Gerz]] this permanent installation via an international competition organized by the city.  They erected in a public square a column clad in lead beside which they provided a metal pencil and a panel with the following text translated in seven languages (English, French, German, Russian, Turk, Arabic and Hebrew):
"We invite the citizens of [[Harburg, Hamburg|Harburg]], and visitors to the town, to add their names here to ours. In doing so we commit ourselves to remain vigilant. As more and more names cover this 12 metre-high lead column, it will gradually be lowered into the ground. One day it will have disappeared completely and the site of the Harburg monument against fascism will be empty. In the long run, it is only we ourselves who can stand up against injustice."

The column was sunk into the ground seven times from 1986 to 1993. All that remains visible are a lead plaque on the ground, the text panel and photos of the different stages.&lt;ref&gt;James E. Young, ''The Counter-Monument: Memory against Itself in Germany Today'', in ''Critical Inquiry'', Vol. 18, No. 2. (Winter, 1992), pp. 267-296&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Justin Branch, ''The Historiography of the Harburg Monument'', University Thesis, Eton College, Windsor, United Kingdom, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Publication by Esther Shalev-Gerz and Jochen Gerz: ''Mahnmal gegen Faschismus'', Cantz/Hatje Verlag Stuttgart, Germany, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;
*''The Dispersal of Seeds, The Collection of Ashes'', UN Park, Geneva, Switzerland, 1995 and Marl, Germany, 1996. A commission by the German government to commemorate the 50 anniversary of the creation of the United nations in 1995. The two masts, reminiscent of the poles from which emblematic flags are flown, represent on the one hand the role of distribution to new beginnings and on the other hand the necessity to assemble histories.
*''First Generation'', 2004, Sweden. For this permanent installation, Shalev-Gerz filmed in extreme close-ups the face of each of the 34 people from the first generation of immigrants as she/he listens to her/his answers to the questions: when arriving here, what did you lose? What did you find? What did you get? What did you give? This silent film is visible on the glass façade of the Multicultural Center Botkyrka. One can here their voice by entering the building.&lt;ref&gt;Catalogue: ''First Generation'', Multiculturel Center, Fitja, Sweden, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''A Thread'', permanent installation, [[Castlemilk]], south of [[Glasgow]]. From 2003 to 2006 Esther Shalev-Gerz developed a project in which ten groups of participants were invited to choose their favourite view in the former park of a castle near their new housing. At each point of view a circular bench was installed thus creating a path through the park.&lt;ref&gt;Publication: ''The Thread'', Aje Aje, in collaboration with CCA, Glasgow, U.K., 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Les Inséparables'', Wanas, Sweden. In 2008 Wanas Foundation commissioned a new version of the double-clock ''Angel 10'', that is originally part of the installation Inseparable Angels: The Imaginary House for Walter Benjamin, 2000. This new {{convert|3|m|ft|adj=mid|-wide|sp=us}} double-clock is permanently installed in the park of the Foundation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7674">The '''free plan''',&lt;ref&gt;Alfirevic Djordje, Simonovic-Alfirevic Sanja. ''[https://www.academia.edu/30239295/Open-plan_in_Housing_Architecture_Origin_Development_and_Design_Approaches_for_Spatial_Integration_Otvoreni_plan_u_stambenoj_arhitekturi_Poreklo_razvoj_i_pristupi_prostornom_integrisanju_ Open-plan in Housing Architecture: Origin, Development and Design Approaches for Spatial Integration / Otvoreni plan u stambenoj arhitekturi: Poreklo, razvoj i pristupi prostornom integrisanju]''. Arhitektura i urbanizam (Belgrade), No.43 (2016), pp.&amp;nbsp;45–60.&lt;/ref&gt; as it relates to [[architecture]] refers to an [[open plan]] with non [[load-bearing wall|load-bearing]] walls dividing interior space.{{Technical statement|date=July 2011}} In this [[structural system]], the building structure is separate of the [[Framing (construction)#Interior partitions|interior partitions]]. This is made possible by replacing interior load-bearing walls with moving the structure of the building to the exterior, or by having [[columns]] that are free from space dividing partitions.

== Definition ==

Free plan, in the architecture world, refers to the ability to have a [[floor plan]] with non-load bearing walls and floors by creating a structural system that holds the weight of the building by ways of an interior skeleton of load bearing columns.  The building system carries only its columns, or skeleton, and each corresponding ceiling. Free plan allows for the ability to create buildings without being limited by the placement of walls for structural support, and enables an architect to have the freedom to design the outside and inside [[façade]] without compromise.&lt;ref name=conrads&gt;{{cite book|last=Conrads|first=lrich|title=Programs and Manifestos on 20th century Architecture.|year=1970|publisher=MIT|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influences ==

[[Le Corbusier]] became the pioneer of free plan during the 1914 through 1930’s with his “Five Points of New Architecture”&lt;ref name=curtis&gt;{{cite book|last=Curtis|first=William JR|title=LeCorbusier: Ideas and Forms|year=1986|publisher=Rizzoli|location=New York|pages=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and his adoption of the Dom-ino System.&lt;ref name=dom&gt;{{cite web|title=Dom-ino Houses|url=http://architectural-world.blogspot.com/2008/05/dom-ino-houses.html|publisher=Arch World|accessdate=29 Nov 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This heavily influenced the importance of free plan and its role in the “[[modernism|modern era]]” of architecture.

== Dom-ino Structural System ==

The Dom-ino system refers to the structural system that allows a free floor and wall plan, due to the load bearing columns within the skeleton of the structure. Originally conceived as a two story building, six vertical columns held the two concrete, steel reinforced floors in space. This allowed for exterior walls that accommodate to the aesthetic and compositional features of the building. This also created a free floor plan, moving from the previous ideology of load bearing walls. This new technology allowed for long strips of windows that could wrap corners and stretch greater lengths, something that was never seen before in architecture. This building system became a staple for high production buildings because of its cheap and fast production rate. Ways could be fashioned in any way, restrained only by technological advancements of the time.&lt;ref name="dom" /&gt;

== Corbusier and the Five Points of a New Architecture ==
[[Le Corbusier|Corbusier]] adopted what he considered to be the most important five architectural points in his architecture: [[pilotis]], free plan, horizontal windows, a free façade and [[roof garden|roof top gardens]].  The ideas all surface around the main point of free plan and the use of the Dom-ino system. The piloti system carries all the weight allowing for a free plan as well as a free façade. The free exterior façade allowed for vast openings and horizontal strips of windows creating aesthetic value. All of the five points work together, being based off the premises of the Dom-ino system, varied to a degree for aesthetic purposes.&lt;ref name="curtis" /&gt;

== Examples ==
[[File:Planta libre-pabellón de barcelona.png|thumb|300px|Plan of the [[Barcelona Pavilion]]. The columns (red) support the roof, while the walls are freely positioned.]]
Although Corbusier had become the pioneer of free plan in his own architecture, some other notable architects continued to follow in his footsteps, using free plan in their architecture as well. Two notable architects include [[Ludwig Mies Van Der Rohe]] and [[Eduardo Catalano]]. Three of Van Der Rohe’s most notable buildings that portray the use of free plan are the [[Barcelona Pavilion]] &lt;ref name="Barcelona..." /&gt; and the [[New National Gallery]] in [[Berlin]] &lt;ref name="Neue Nationalgalerie"&gt;{{cite web|last=Glynn|first=Simon|title=Neue Nationalgalerie by Ludwig Mies Van Der Rohe'|url=http://www.galinsky.com/buildings/neuenationalgalerie/index.htm|accessdate=29 Nov 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   and the [[Crown Hall]] building at the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref name="IIT Architecture..."&gt;{{cite web|title=IITArchitecture {{!}} Crown Hall|url=http://www.iit.edu/arch/crown_hall/|accessdate=29 Nov 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All three of these buildings show great expanses in floor plan due to the freedom from use of free plan. Notably, the Barcelona Pavilion expresses free plan by having glass walls and large expanses and openings in the outside façade of the building. It also has a completely open free floor plan in the interior with sections divided by walls lower than ceiling height to distinguish rooms and areas, something that can be done in any fashion through the use of free plan.&lt;ref name="Barcelona..."&gt;{{cite web|title=Barcelona Pavilion - Ludwig Mies Van Der Rohe|url=http://www.archiplanet.org/buildings/Barcelona_Pavilion.html|publisher=Achiplanet|accessdate=29 Nov 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of Corbusier’s architecture, the [[Villa Savoye|Villa Savoye Poissy]], demonstrates his five points in the most successful way, including free plan. By using free plan, the exterior façade of the building has large horizontal window bands to help achieve greater amounts of light reach the inside of the building. The interior also demonstrates free plan by not being limited by load bearing walls, but instead having large, openings and rooms in the inside façade of the building.&lt;ref name="Villa Savoye..."&gt;{{cite web|last=Glynn|first=Simon|title=Villa Savoye, Poissy, France, by Le Corbusier and Pierre Jeanerette|url=http://www.galinsky.com/buildings/savoye/index.htm|accessdate=29 Nov 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eduardo Catalano achieves the ultimate free plan in his [[Catalano House|Catalano residence]] in [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]], [[North Carolina]] in 1955 by using thin shield concrete to achieve a completely free floor plan. By using the concrete in his roof, he designs a [[Hyperbolic paraboloid|hyperbolic parabolic]] roof that is self-supporting with only two points touching the ground. No other points of contact support the roof. In doing this he achieves a floor plan that is completely independent of its roof structure. The roof stands by itself, and creates its own structure. This achieves, by definition, a completely independent free plan.&lt;ref name="Kunkel 2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Designs for Modern Living: Catalano House|url=http://www.jetsetmodern.com/catalano.htm|publisher=designs for Modern living and PNC|accessdate=6 Dec 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106100500/http://www.jetsetmodern.com/catalano.htm|archivedate=2012-01-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Audrey Hepburn screentest in Roman Holiday trailer.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Audrey Hepburn]] has been cited as the epitome of a gamine.]]
A '''gamine''' is  a slim, elegant young woman who is, or is perceived to be, mischievous, teasing or sexually appealing.

The word ''gamine'' is a French word, the feminine form of ''gamin'', originally meaning [[Street Urchin|urchin]], [[waif]] or playful, naughty child. It was used in English from about the mid-19th century (for example, by [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] in 1840 in one of his Parisian sketches), but in the 20th century, came to be applied in its more modern sense.

== Lexicography ==
In 1997 the publisher [[HarperCollins]] drew up a list of 101 words – one a year – that defined the years 1896 to 1997.&lt;ref&gt;See ''The Times'', 3 November 1997&lt;/ref&gt; "Gamine" was chosen for 1899, being described by Philip Howard in ''[[The Times]]'' as follows:

{{quote|An [[elf]]ish young woman. [[Audrey Hepburn]] in ''[[Roman Holiday (1953 film)|Roman Holiday]]'' was the archetypal, unforgettable, adorable gamine.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 3 November 1997&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Gamine'' has been used particularly of such women in the performing arts or world of fashion. In that context, the closest English word – of [[Anglo-Norman langauge|Anglo-Norman]] origin – is probably "waif" (although "gamine" is often seen as conveying an additional sense of style and [[chic (style)|chic]]). For example, in a press release of 1964, impresario [[Andrew Oldham]] described the 17-year-old singer [[Marianne Faithfull]] as "shy, wistful, waif-like";&lt;ref&gt;''Faithfull – An Autobiography'', 1994&lt;/ref&gt; and writer and musician John Amis referred to German-born actress [[Luise Rainer]] (b. 1910) as [[Paul Muni]]'s "waif-wife" in the 1937 film, ''[[The Good Earth (film)|The Good Earth]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oldie'', August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

''Gaminerie'' has sometimes been used in English with reference to the behaviour or characteristics of gamin(e)s.

== In silent films ==
In the early 20th century, [[silent films]] brought to public attention a number of actresses who sported a gamine look. These included the Canadian-born [[Mary Pickford]] (1892–1979), who became known as "America’s Sweetheart" and, with her husband [[Douglas Fairbanks]], was one of the founders of the film production company [[United Artists]]; [[Lillian Gish]] (1893–1993), notably in ''[[Way Down East]]'' (1920); and [[Louise Brooks]] (1906–86), whose short [[bob cut|bobbed]] [[hairstyles, eponymous|hairstyle]], widely copied in the 1920s, came to be regarded as both a gamine and a "[[boho-chic|Bohemian]]" trait (this style having first appeared among the Paris ''demi-monde'' before World War I and among London art students during the war.&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Nicholson (2002) ''Among the Bohemians''&lt;/ref&gt;) In 1936, [[Charlie Chaplin]] cast his then-girlfriend [[Paulette Goddard]] (1910–1990) as an orphaned gamine (credited as "A Gamin") in one of his last silent films, ''[[Modern Times (film)|Modern Times]]''.

== Audrey Hepburn and gamines of the 1950s ==
In the 1950s "gamine" was applied notably to the style and appearance of the [[Belgium|Belgian]]-born actress [[Audrey Hepburn]] (1929–1993): for example, in the films, ''[[Sabrina (1954 film)|Sabrina]]'' (1954) and ''[[Funny Face]]'' (1957). Hepburn also played the role of the gamine Gigi in New York (1951) in the play of that name, based on the novel (1945) by [[Colette]], who had personally "talent-spotted" her when she was filming in [[Monte Carlo]].&lt;ref&gt;Judith Thurman (1999) ''Secrets of the Flesh – A Life of Colette''&lt;/ref&gt; On film and in photographs, Hepburn’s short hair and petite figure created a distinct and enduring "look", well defined by Don Macpherson,&lt;ref&gt;''Stars of the Screen'' (Marks &amp; Spencer, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; who cited her "naïveté which did not rule out sophistication", and described her as "the first gamine to be accepted as overpoweringly chic".

Other film actresses of the period regarded as gamines included [[Leslie Caron]] (b. 1931), who played the leading role in the 1958 musical film of ''[[Gigi (1958 film)|Gigi]]''; [[Jean Seberg]] (1938–79), best known in ''[[Bonjour Tristesse]]'' (1957) and [[Jean-Luc Godard]]’s ''[[Breathless (1960 film)|À bout de souffle]]'' (1960); [[Jean Simmons]] (1929-2010), for example, in ''Angel Face'' (1952); and [[Rita Tushingham]] (b. 1940), whose first starring role was in ''[[A Taste of Honey (film)|A Taste of Honey]]'' (1961). The French singer [[Juliette Greco]] (b. 1926), who emerged from [[Bohemian style#Post-Liberation Paris|Bohemian]] Paris in the late 1940s to become an international star in the 1950s, also had gamine qualities.

== 1960s and beyond ==
In many ways, the "gamine look" of the 1950s paved the way for the success of the following English models: [[Jean Shrimpton]] (b. 1942), one of the first to promote the [[mini-skirt]] in 1965; [[Twiggy]] (b. Lesley Hornby, 1949), who became "The Face of '66";&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/breakfast/4725427.stm "The face of '66"] ''BBC News''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kate Moss]] (b. 1974), associated in the 1990s with the "[[waif]]" look and what, notably through an advertising campaign for [[Calvin Klein]] in 1997, became known as "[[heroin chic]]." Moss was part of a trend of "wafer" thin models which was satirized in [[Neil Kerber]]’s strip cartoon "Supermodels" in the magazine ''[[Private Eye]]''.

Gamines share similarities with the modern, cinematic "[[Manic Pixie Dream Girl]]" stock character.

== Other gamines ==
Others who have been described as gamines include Danish-French actress [[Anna Karina]] (b. 1940); American actresses [[Julia Roberts]] (b. 1967) (she was often compared to Audrey Hepburn at the start of her career), [[Edie Sedgwick]] (1943–1971), [[Elizabeth Hartman]] (1943–1987), [[Mia Farrow]] (b. 1945), [[Sissy Spacek]] (b. 1949), [[Winona Ryder]] (b. 1971),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Traill-Nash|first1=Glynis|title=Cream of the gamine crop|journal=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=1 April 2007|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/film/cream-of-the-gamine-crop/2007/03/31/1174761805542.html|accessdate=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]] (b. 1980), [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] (b. 1972),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Calendar/Film?Film=oid%3A747453 The Austin Chronicle 2009-02-27].

The '''German Forum for Art History Paris''' ('''Deutsches Forum für Kunstgeschichte''' (DFK; Centre Allemand d'Histoire de l'Art de Paris; German Center for the History of Art, Paris) is a [[Germany|German]] research institute specialized in [[France|French]] and [[Germany|German]] art and currently situated in the Hôtel de Lully in [[Paris]], the former residence of the French composer [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]]. It organizes conferences, symposia, and workshops, undertakes research projects, and has published many books on art.

The DFK was founded in 1997 with German, French, and Swiss colleagues by [[Thomas W. Gaehtgens]]. It is supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. Until October 2007, the institution was headed by Gaehtgens, from 2009 to 2014 by {{Interlanguage link multi|Andreas Beyer|de}} and since February 2014 by the current director, {{Interlanguage link multi|Thomas Kirchner (Historiker)|de}}. From 2006, the Forum is part of the "Foundation of German Humanities Institutes Abroad", which is now called "Max Weber Foundation of German Humanities Institutes Abroad".

The DFK supports research by [[Germany|German]] scholars on [[France|French]] subjects. It also promotes the research of French scholars on German art and German art history and endeavors to include other [[Europe]]an and [[Americas|transatlantic]] countries and academic disciplines to participate in its research programs.

The DFK cooperates with the [[Institut national d'histoire de l'art]] (INHA) in Paris, the [[Bibliotheca Hertziana – Max Planck Institute for Art History]] in Rome, the [[Kunsthistorisches Institut in Florenz]] and the [[Zentralinstitut für Kunstgeschichte]] in Munich. It is also member of the [[International Association of Research Institutes in the History of Art]] (RIHA).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8819">'''Hainteny''' (pronounced {{IPA-mg|hajnˈtenʲ|}}, [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]] for "knowledge of words") is a traditional form of [[Madagascar|Malagasy]] [[oral literature]] and [[poetry]],  involving heavy use of [[metaphor]]. It is associated primarily with the [[Merina]] people of [[Madagascar]].&lt;ref&gt;Houlder, J.A. (1929). ''Ohabolana, or Malagasy Proverbs, Illustrating the Wit and Wisdom of the Hova of Madagascar.'' Antananarivo: Friends' Foreign Missionary Association.&lt;/ref&gt; In its use of metaphor and allusion it resembles another type of poetry, the [[Malay language|Malay]] [[pantun]], and Fox&lt;ref&gt;Fox, L. (trans.). (1990). ''Hainteny, the Traditional Poetry of Madagascar.'' Lewisburg, PA: Bucknell University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests "it seems likely the Merina brought with them a [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]] poetic tradition" to Madagascar. The [[Ibonia]], an epic poem related for centuries in different versions across Madagascar, reflects the value placed on the linguistic skills celebrated in the hainteny tradition, and offers insight into the diverse mythologies and beliefs of traditional Malagasy communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Ibonia: the text in 17 sections |last = Unknown |publisher = University of Virginia | accessdate = November 15, 2010 |url = http://xroads.virginia.edu/~Public/Ibonia/text.html |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/604h5KUmV |archivedate = July 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Collections of hainteny were first gathered in print form on the orders of Queen [[Ranavalona I]] in the 19th century. The [[France|French]] writer [[Jean Paulhan]], who stayed in Madagascar from 1908 to 1910, made an intensive study of the hainteny and published a book of translations in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Paulhan, J. (1913). ''Les Hainteny merina.'' Paris: Geuthner.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hainteny often incorporates '''ohabolana''' (proverbs) and '''kabary''' (public discourse).  Both of these two oral traditions remain integral parts of Malagasy daily life, where they are pronounced at such events as weddings, funerals, births and [[famadihana]] and constitute an essential component of [[hiragasy]] performances.  They may also include ''angano'' (folktales and fables), ''tantara'' (historical narratives) or ''ankamantatra'' (riddles).&lt;ref&gt;Peek, P. and Yankah, K. (2004). "Malagasy Folklore and its Study." In ''African Folklore: an Encyclopedia.'' New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; These diverse Malagasy oral traditions were advanced in the 20th century by such artists as [[Jean Joseph Rabearivelo]], who is considered Africa's first modern poet,&lt;ref&gt;Rabearivelo (2007), p. x&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Elie Rajaonarison]], an exemplar of the new wave of Malagasy poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Auzias &amp; Labourdette (2007), p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ohabolana ==
"Proverb" offers a weak approximation of the meaning of '''ohabolana''', which constitute no less than concise expressions of the Malagasy philosophical worldview.  While the exact number of existing ohabolana is unknown, the largest published collection includes over 6,500 of them relating to all aspects of life and particularly the human condition.  Fox has described ohabolana as constituting "a universal philosophy of life that transcends its Malagasy context and merits admiration as one of man's noble attempts to construct a valid moral and philosophical framework for his existence."&lt;ref&gt;Fox, L. (1990). ''Hainteny: the traditional poetry of Madagascar.'' London: Associated University Presses. (p. 37)&lt;/ref&gt; Ohabolana are not the property of a particular class but are rather at the disposition of anyone who finds a salient application of a particular expression to a given situation.  Their form persists unchanged from ancient times even when grammar and syntax of contemporary speech have since evolved because, as Fox notes, altering an ohabolana would constitute disregard for the venerated ancestors who are their originators.  Ohabolana are characteristically brief, metaphorical, symmetrical in pattern and syntax.&lt;br&gt;
Examples:&lt;ref&gt;Sibree, J. &amp; Baron, R. (Eds.). (1893).''The Antananarivo annual and Madagascar magazine.'' 5(17)&amp;mdash;Part 1. Antananarivo: L.M.S. Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
{{quote|''Manasa lamba be tseroka; na madio aza, mangarahara.''&amp;mdash;Washing a very dirty dress: even though it gets clean, it becomes full of holes.&lt;br&gt;
''Ny tsiny toy ny rivotra: mikasika ny tena, fa tsy hita tarehy.''&amp;mdash;Blame is like the wind: felt but not seen.&lt;br&gt;
''Ny voky tsy mahaleo ny tsaroana.''&amp;mdash;A good belly-full doesn't equal a kind remembrance.&lt;br&gt;
''Aza asesiky ny fitia tanteraka, ka tsy mahalala ny ranonorana ho avy.''&amp;mdash;Don't be so much in love that you can't tell when the rain is coming.}}

== Kabary ==
The tradition of '''kabary''' in Madagascar, which predates Merina King [[Andrianampoinimerina]] (1787&amp;ndash;1810), nonetheless owes much of its modern form, usage and meaning to standards set at his court.  Kabary is a highly stylized form of speech that has formed an important part of Malagasy culture for centuries. One who speaks kabary is known as ''mpikabary''.  Skill in this form of ceremonial public speaking&amp;mdash;in which ''ohabolana'' proverbs play a privileged role&amp;mdash;is highly esteemed and one who shows himself to be a ''tompon'ny kabary'' (master of kabary) enjoys a higher level of respect and even authority. According to the classic collection of Malagasy folklore ''"[[Tantara ny Andriana eto Madagasikara]]"'' the right to rule could even be determined by one's eloquence and skills in kabary, to the point where ''tompon'ny kabary'' and sovereign become interchangeable concepts:
{{quote|We understand therein the function of the kabary:&lt;br&gt;
there is a master of the words,&lt;br&gt;
there is somebody who answers.&lt;br&gt;
It is the master of the words who rules the kingdom;&lt;br&gt;
As for the one who answers to the kabary,
it is the public acknowledgment of his submission.&lt;ref&gt;Ottino, P. (1983). Ancient Malagasy Dynastic Succession: The Merina Example.  ''History in Africa, 10'', 247&amp;ndash;292. (''"Dia hita eo ny fomban'ny kabary: 
misy tompon'ny teny,
dia misy mamaly.
Izay tompon'ny teny no mitondra ny fanjakana;
ary ny olona kosa mamaly kabary, 
fanehoana fa mpanoa."'' p. 261)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kabary forms an integral part of numerous important social ceremonies, including marriage, [[famadihana]], [[circumcision]] and burial.  By choosing to use the kabary speech style, a speaker can render any situation more formal and ceremonial, such as can happen when expressing condolences, offering thanks, formally addressing a gathering or giving a political address.  To this day, skill in kabary can play a deciding role in the success of a Malagasy politician's career.

Kabary may be delivered by two or more mpikabary at the same occasion, and each one generally was nominated by and represents a portion of the audience present, as during [[hiragasy]] performances.  When this happens, kabary speech can take on somewhat competitive overtones as the speakers attempt to demonstrate their superior skills. The mpikabary typically addresses himself to the audience of his opponent, and while direct confrontation is generally frowned upon in polite society in the Highlands of Madagascar, if an opponent mpikabary makes an error in the form of the kabary or misstates an ohabolana, this is commonly pointed out in an indirect or delicate manner as evidence of greater mastery.  The use of indirect language such as proverbs is viewed as the more challenging, adult manner of speaking and demonstrates skill, while direct criticism, bluntness, hateful speech or anything that causes loss of face to the audience or a rival speaker is censured and despised as lacking in skill.  Kabary is generally the domain of men and not women, because women are believed and expected to speak in a more straightforward way&amp;mdash;including the expression of anger that can cause loss of face to the speaker&amp;mdash;while men are expected to preserve face by taking the time to choose their words carefully when speaking to others.  Nonetheless, some women may exceptionally engage in kabary (for instance, all queens), although men represent the vast majority of mpikabary.&lt;ref&gt;Keenan, E. (1998). "Norm-makers, norm-breakers: Uses of speech by men and women in a Malagasy community." In ''The Matrix of Language: Contemporary linguistic anthropology.'' Boulder, CO: Westview Press. pp. 99&amp;ndash;115&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Horseshoe-Shaped Hearth with Ram-Headed Ends''', is a clay sculpture found in the [[History Museum of Armenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://historymuseum.am/collections/archaeological_collection|title=Archaeological Collection, History Museum of Armenia website|last=|first=|date=|website=historymuseum.am|publisher=|accessdate=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Armenia's Early [[Bronze Age]] monuments that were discovered had similar [[hearth]]s decorated with anthropomorphic and animal sculptures, that were special altars installed in homes to perform beliefs concerning agricultural rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://historymuseum.am/collections/online_collection/arc5|title=Horeshoe-Shaped Hearth` Ram-Headed Ends|website=historymuseum.am|accessdate=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Early Bronze Age culture built stone hearths next to clay mobile hearths which served different purposes. Horseshoe-shaped or arched-shaped mobile hearths are used only for ceremonial purposes. According to common belief, the mobile hearth symbolizes the male head of the household and their ability to prosper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://shirak.asj-oa.am/388/1/96-104.pdf Larisa Yeganyan, Clay Horseshoe Items in Ani Cave]&lt;/ref&gt; The mobile hearths are put over extinguished fires or on top of ashes, then are kept on the inside of ancient ovens called [[Tandoor|tonirs]], in a vertical position. There are examples of the Early Bronze Age found on a few stones assembled on fireplaces. &lt;ref group="notes"&gt;3000 BC monuments are not only found with strong ram heads, bodies, and limbs for worship in hearth fireplace horeshoe crutches, but also with ram-head medal accessories.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Impalement arts''' are a type of [[performing art]] in which a performer plays the role of human target for a fellow performer who demonstrates accuracy skills in disciplines such as knife throwing and archery. [[Impalement]] is actually what the performers endeavour to avoid – the thrower or marksman aims ''near'' the target rather than at him or her. The objective is to land the throw or shot as close as possible to the assistant's body without causing injury.

Impalement arts are often found in [[circuses]] and [[sideshow]]s as well as sometimes in [[Variety shows|variety]], [[cabaret]] or [[burlesque]] shows. In addition, impalement acts have provided subject matter for literature, art, photography and film and television scripts.

There are important distinctions between [[knife throwing]] or [[archery]] practised as competitive sports and similar skills displayed as impalement arts. For example, organising bodies for competitive archery prohibit activity that involves deliberate shooting in the general direction of a human being.&lt;ref&gt;For example, impalement arts contravene rules 101(b) and 102(a) of the UK Grand National Archery Society (GNAS) Rules of Shooting (see {{cite web

}})&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forms and variations==

}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The human target is the essential distinguishing feature of the impalement arts. It has been asserted by several sources, including well-known knife throwers, that the power and appeal of this type of act lies as much in audience appreciation of the target as in admiration of the skill of the thrower or archer.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Dr David Adamovich, aka The Great Throwdini, has frequently asserted the importance of his assistants in print and in web forums. In Adamovich, Heil &amp; Schollenberger, ''A Day on Broadway: The art of being a knife thrower's assistant'', Turnshare (London, 2005), {{ISBN|1-903343-73-9}}, p.150, he writes of: "...my lovely and daring assistants - sine qua non - without which there'd be no act!". In the same book Astrid Schollenberger describes her initial instruction by Adamovich thus: "Rule one: The target girl is the star of the show and she has to be aware that the stunts depend on her. Rule two: You must not move".&lt;/ref&gt; Various theories have been put forward to explain this, ranging from simple awe at the display of steely nerves and complete trust to more complex psychological and philosophical theories. While some point to overtones of [[BDSM|sadomasochistic]] [[eroticism]], others cite [[Dramaturgy|dramaturgical]] works and point to parallels with the story arc of the [[hero]] in classic drama. In particular the assistant's performance is said to mirror the plot device of the [[The Writer's Journey: Mythic Structure For Writers|hero's ordeal]], in which the hero proves his or her heroic qualities through self-sacrifice or by facing extreme peril.&lt;ref name="Heil"&gt;Dr Joachim Heil PhD, "A short philosophical essay on the art of knife throwing", in Adamovich, Heil &amp; Schollenberger, ''A Day on Broadway'', pp.83–114&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Extensive evidence of the debate on this topic is to be found in various online forums including the ''Dangerous Circus Acts'' groups on Yahoo!&lt;/ref&gt;

The target or assistant role is most often taken by a female performer,  sometimes known as a [[target girl]], who commonly wears a revealing costume, thus adding an element of overt sexuality to the act. While a few contemporary acts feature a male in the target role, and some play upon role reversal, the traditional figure of a female target still prevails.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Brion in the foreword to ''A Day on Broadway'', p.x&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally speaking, the assistant, whether male or female, stands in front of a board, made of wood or some similar material, into which the knives or arrows are embedded. For some stunts the assistant is strapped to a moving board. There are several disciplines and a great variety of tricks and stunts that are performed within this basic format. Some tricks are done by performers in all disciplines while others are generally the preserve of one discipline. For example, moving target stunts, such as the "[[Wheel of death (Impalement arts)|wheel of death]]", tend to be done by knife throwers but not by archers.

Impalement artists have adopted a variety of guises, including [[Wild West Shows|wild west]] figures, "gypsy" characters or tuxedo-wearing [[cabaret]] performers. There have even been efforts to package impalement arts within dramatic productions, such as the play ''Pin Cushion'', which consists of a monologue delivered by an actress as she takes part in a real knifethrowing act (see [[#Theatre|Theatre]]).&lt;ref name="httheatre"&gt;For official website see {{cite web

===Disciplines===
The impalement arts can be divided into distinct disciplines. While some performers specialise purely in one of the disciplines, others combine disciplines or even mix impalement arts into other types of performance.
* '''[[Knife throwing]]''' is the most common and well-known discipline within the impalement arts. It includes the throwing of axes, machetes and other sharp implements as well as knives.
* '''[[Archery]]''' is the other main discipline. An archer might use bows or crossbows or both.
* '''Sharpshooting:''' It is arguable that some firearms sharpshooting acts fall into the category of impalement arts when they involve a performer holding up targets for a [[marksman]]. Even when sharpshooting is not performed as an impalement art, it is sometimes grouped alongside knife throwing as a [[Wild West Shows|wild west]] art. It also has much in common with crossbow shooting in terms of the accuracy skills involved.
* '''Whips and other disciplines:''' Disciplines such as [[bullwhip]] displays and trick roping are not strictly impalement arts but are often grouped with impalement art disciplines for a variety of reasons. Bullwhip artists and ropers sometimes employ human "targets" for certain tricks. Furthermore, some impalement arts performers also feature these other disciplines in their acts. In addition, all the above disciplines are sometimes placed within a common context, such as [[Wild West Shows|wild west]] arts.

===Tricks===
There are many variations on the simple arrangement of having the assistant stand in front of a target board and remain still while knives, arrows or other objects land about them. Often the first type of variation in a routine is that the assistant will assume different poses. For example:
[[File:Target-girl Astrid performs profile stunt.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Astrid Schollenberger demonstrates the position of the target girl in the "profile" stunt.]]
* '''Profile:'''  This is a classic done by many performers. The assistant stands side-on to the board and then bends backwards. The impalement artist then aims a series of knives, axes or arrows along the line of the front edge of the assistant, beginning around the legs and ending with the last throw or shot coming close to the assistant's throat. One aspect of this pose is that it accentuates the vulnerability of the assistant, particularly with the last impact tantalisingly close to the throat. Another important aspect for knifethrowers is that the upper part of the assistant's body is positioned so that a series of throws can be landed ''above'' it - a flexible target girl might be able to place her neck and the upper part of her chest in a horizontal line. A skilled thrower can use the way that a knife turns in flight to land it sloping at a downward angle from the board; thus, the point of the knife can impact safely above the assistant but the rest of the knife can slope down and come very close indeed to the assistant's body, even making contact on some occasions.
* '''Headstand:''' An example from the repertoire of knife acts goes as follows: The assistant does a headstand against the target board; the thrower then throws two knives or axes, one into each of the two top corners of the target board; the assistant moves his or her legs apart until they touch the two implements embedded in the board; the thrower then throws a series of implements into the "V" formed by the assistants legs, progressing threateningly towards the crotch.

More complex stunts and challenges include:
* '''[[Wheel of death (Impalement arts)|The Wheel of death]]:''' One of the most difficult and dangerous feats for a knifethrower. The assistant is strapped to a large circular target board which spins about its middle, like a wheel. The thrower must execute a series of rapid, consistent and carefully timed throws to land knives on the segments of the wheel not covered by the assistant's body. There are some variations in the exact configuration of "wheels": in some the assistant is positioned with their arms at their sides while in others the assistant is [[spreadeagle (position)|spreadeagled]]. Sometimes the "wheel" might not actually be circular: shield shapes and rectangular rotating boards have been known and all will work as "wheels" as long as they are correctly balanced to rotate smoothly when the assistant is in place.&lt;ref name="blade-aug93"&gt;{{Cite journal

 |pages = 30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; A particularly challenging version of this stunt is "The Veiled Wheel", in which the target is covered with a paper screen so the thrower can't see the assistant. Only four artists are known to have attempted this dangerous trick. It was first performed by The Gibsons in the 1930s; a duo named The Zeros followed them in the 1940s, Fritz Brumbach did it in Monte Carlo in 1978 and The Great Throwdini revived it in New York in October 2010 with Melissa-Anne Ainley acting as his target girl.&lt;ref name="hartzman_aol"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aolnews.com/weird-news/article/throwdini-makes-wheel-of-death-even-deadlier/19659035 |title=Wheel of Death Made Deadlier |accessdate=2010-10-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011194355/http://www.aolnews.com/weird-news/article/throwdini-makes-wheel-of-death-even-deadlier/19659035 |archivedate=October 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''The Devil's door:''' A moving target challenge pioneered by knifethrower [[#Knife throwing|Larry Cisewski]]. This time the assistant is on a door-sized rectangular board that spins about a central vertical axis. Again the thrower must execute a series of rapid, consistent and carefully timed throws to land knives on parts of the board not covered by the assistant's body. Sometimes the aim is to hit the back of the board in the moments that the assistant is turned away from the thrower. Other throwers have placed a vertical row of knives down the sides of the assistant at the moments when the assistant turns to face them.&lt;ref name="cisewskiMcEvoy"/&gt;
* '''Balloon bursting:''' The assistant stands in front of the target board and holds balloons which the thrower or archer then attempts to burst. Balloons can be held in the hand, positioned under arms or between the legs and sometimes an assistant will hold a balloon between their teeth.
* '''William Tell:''' There are various stunts inspired by the story of [[William Tell]], who, according to legend, was forced to shoot an apple off of his son's head with a crossbow. Modern impalement artists have performed similar feats. In some ways the Tell legend can be seen as one of the earliest inspirations for the impalement arts.
* '''Impaling a card or paper plate:''' The assistant stands in front of the target board and holds out a card, or paper plate which the thrower or archer attempts to pin to the board. The level of danger can be varied to some extent by whether the assistant holds the card at full arms length or keeps it close. [[#Archery and crossbow acts|The Jasters]] do a "William Tell" version in which the card is balanced on the head of target girl Elena Busnelli.
* '''Cutting a straw or flower stem:''' An assistant holds a [[Drinking straw|straw]] or flower in his or her mouth and the impalement artist attempts to chop the tip of it off. This is mostly associated with knife throwers and bullwhip artists.
* '''Blind:''' The thrower or archer wears a [[blindfold]]. Generally the assistant first guides the blindfolded impalement artist into position facing towards the target board. The assistant then stands in place against the board and gives an audible signal to commence the stunt. The implication is that the impalement artist then has to aim on the basis of where they remember the target to be. There is a trick behind this stunt and budding impalement artists are warned not to attempt it unless coached by an experienced professional.
* '''Covered target:''' The assistant is covered so that the thrower or archer cannot see exactly where they are. The covering is made of paper or some other flimsy material so that knives or arrows will pass through it. The implication is that the thrower or archer must estimate the position of the assistant using memory and other indirect guides and aim on that basis.
* '''Double ladder of death:''' This involves two knifethrowers simultaneously performing a rapid sequence of throws at the same target board while aiming so that the trajectories of their knives cross. The throwers stand side by side facing the assistant at the board. The knives from the thrower on the right land on the left side of the target board while the knives from the thrower on the left impact to the right. Each thrower aims their next knife vertically above where they placed the preceding one, so that a ladder of knives is formed up each side of the assistant. This stunt was pioneered by [[#Knife throwing|The Great Throwdini]] in partnership with [[#Knife throwing|Harry Munroe]].&lt;ref name="cirkus"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Vegetable slice:''' A cucumber (or similar vegetable) is held on the bare skin of the assistant's body (usually the inside of her forearm).  A series of knives are thrown around the assistant, ending with a knife that slices the cucumber in half.  This stunt was performed by [[Jack Dagger]] on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]'s ''More Extreme Marksmen'' and ''[[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien]]''.

==History==
The precise origins of the impalement arts remain unknown, but its performance may reach back as far as antiquity. The [[Roman emperor]] [[Domitian]] (1st century AD) was said to entertain guests on his [[Alba Longa|Alban]] estate with virtuoso displays of marksmanship.&lt;ref name="suetonius-domitian-19"&gt;Suetonius, Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#19 19]&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Suetonius]] reported these acts in his biography of the emperor:

{{quote|text=There are many who have more than once seen [Domitian] slay a hundred wild beasts of different kinds on his Alban estate, and purposely kill some of them with two successive shots in such a way that the arrows gave the effect of horns. Sometimes he would have a slave stand at a distance and hold out the palm of his right hand for a mark, with the fingers spread; then he directed his arrows with such accuracy that they passed harmlessly between the fingers..&lt;br&gt;
:[[Suetonius]], ''[[On the Life of the Caesars|De Vita Caesarum]]'', "Life of Domitian", 19}}

Knife throwing performers are known to have performed in Europe and America in the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Brion in the foreword to ''A Day on Broadway'', p.vii&lt;/ref&gt; with recorded uses of the term "impalement" to describe this type of act as early as 1871.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}} (excerpts published on the internet by the Circus Historical Society)&lt;/ref&gt; The growth of the impalement arts was greatly facilitated by the way that [[circus]] developed in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and in particular by American influences. [[Buffalo Bill]]'s performances in Europe in 1887 resulted in a wave of popularity for [[Wild West Shows|wild west shows]] and the "western arts" they involved, including knife throwing, archery, whip cracking and sharp shooting.&lt;ref&gt;Brion, ''A Day on Broadway'', p.viii&lt;/ref&gt; In the circus world, the success of large-scale tented touring shows pioneered in America led to the introduction of more acts of skill and daring as well as the inclusion of [[sideshow]]s, in which impalement acts sometimes featured. Among the most significant events were [[Barnum and Bailey Circus|Barnum &amp; Bailey's]] tours of Europe from 1897 to 1902, which made a huge impact on European circus owners and led them to adopt similar formats. As well as providing a friendly stage where impalement acts could rely on finding an audience, circus was a competitive environment in which shows and performers sought to out do each other and thus there were incentives to develop new stunts. Moving targets were an innovation used by European artists in the 1930s. A notable example is the Wheel of Death, which is recorded as having been introduced into the US in 1938 by The Gibsons, from Germany.&lt;ref name="blade-aug93"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''ibid.'' p.ix&lt;/ref&gt;

Another trend in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was that acts from circuses began to find work in permanent venues that were developing in rapidly growing towns and cities. In the US they found a place in [[vaudeville]] and [[Burlesque|burlesque shows]]. In Britain the equivalent was [[music hall]]. And in both America and Europe, [[cabaret]] was another format that sometimes embraced impalement artists. The advent of cinema and later television in the 20th century eventually led to a gradual decline in the venues in which the impalement arts had previously thrived, but a new home was created in the form of [[variety shows|television variety shows]]. A knife throwing act was one of the first pieces of entertainment ever broadcast on television. When the [[BBC]] started the world's first practical television service with experimental transmissions in 1936 one of the types of programmes it produced were variety shows with circus artists. Those acts, which included the knife throwing Denvers, were thought to be very visual and thus suited to the new medium.&lt;ref name="apts"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Variety later became an important part of primetime schedules and remained so for decades.

Although television variety shows are no longer the central feature of network television that they once were, the acts they harboured have found new outlets. The impalement arts live on in modern versions of circus and burlesque and still manage to find an occasional broadcast showcase. An example of this is the recent trend for talent competitions styled on a "[[reality TV]]"  format, such as ''[[America's Got Talent]]'', which featured knifethrowing in its 2007 run.

==Myths==
[[File:Target-girl Astrid with knife in flight.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Astrid Schollenberger in rehearsal faces the knives for real. One is captured in flight, fractions of a second before impact.]]
It is occasionally alleged that knife throwing acts are actually a trick in which the thrower palms the knife as he pretends to throw it and a knife springs out from the target, giving the illusion of perfect aim. Although this technique has been used by at least one magician to emulate knife throwing, the great majority of knife throwers perform genuine acts.&lt;ref&gt;A magician who demonstrated the fake knives trick was [[Val Valentino]] in the TV series ''Breaking the Magicians' Code: Magic's Biggest Secrets Finally Revealed ''. See also [[knife throwing]].&lt;/ref&gt; There are secret tricks behind certain stunts, such as throwing while blindfolded, but they do not involve fake knives springing from the target board.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Injuries suffered by performers provide evidence of the genuine nature of the impalement acts in question. Examples include the cases of Yana Rodionova, injured in a televised stunt with knife thrower Jayde Hanson, and French target girl Catherine Jamet, of Duo Grey Arrow, who suffered a near fatal wound during a crossbow act at the World Circus Festival in Paris in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Notable artists==
The impalement arts have evolved as the product of a history of performance dating back to at least the 19th century. That heritage, and especially the collective achievements of notable performers, helps to define the subject. As with other performance arts, judgements about who might be the most notable are highly subjective and clouded by the hyperbole of publicity. For similar reasons it is also sometimes difficult to resolve debates about who originated particular stunts. Nevertheless, some names recur frequently in historical records and current news. Some are recognised for pioneering achievements, some for bringing the arts to widespread audiences and some as distinctive characters who, although less famous, have had significant influence on their peers. Because this is not a league table of merit and because overlaps make a chronological presentation awkward, they are presented here in alphabetic order under the two main disciplines.

* '''Elizabeth and Collins''' - Hungarian thrower Martin Collins had travelled Europe as a circus performer in the 1930s. He met and married Elizabeth around the time of the outbreak of World War 2 after spotting her as a potential performing partner. They spent the war years in neutral Sweden and later settled in Britain. Collins developed a signature trick that involved doing the [[Wheel of death (Impalement arts)|wheel of death]] stunt while he balanced on a tightrope. Their act took them to nightclubs and vaudeville theaters around the world and they were one of the first impalement acts to break into television. Elizabeth retired from performing in the early 1960s and was replaced by their daughter who was also named Elizabeth (although additionally known as Agnes). Elizabeth and Collins performed on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' three times and appeared as themselves in an episode of the 1960s spy series ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.columbian.com/news/localNews/2007/11/11242007_Final-Salute-Her-husband-missed-her-a-lot-and-that-was-good.cfm |journal=The Columbian |title=Final Salute: Her husband missed her a lot, and that was good |first=Justin |last=Carinci |date=24 November 2007 |accessdate=2008-01-28 |format=&amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=author%3ACarinci+intitle%3AFinal+Salute%3A+Her+husband+missed+her+a+lot%2C+and+that+was+good&amp;as_publication=The+Columbian&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205042116/http://www.columbian.com/news/localNews/2007/11/11242007_Final-Salute-Her-husband-missed-her-a-lot-and-that-was-good.cfm/ |archivedate=December 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="collins"&gt;{{IMDb name |id=1812489|name=Elizabeth and Collins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional or artistic representations==
The impalement arts have been featured in movies, television, literature and art.  These representations, rather than real acts, will have provided many people with the main basis of their ideas about the impalement arts. Impalement acts have proved to be useful plot devices and have provided iconic images. The following sections provide some examples by way of illustration.

===Movies and television===
Perhaps the most notable movie example is the French film ''[[Girl on the Bridge]]'' (1999), in which a knife throwing act is at the centre of the plot and serves as a powerful erotic metaphor. [[Vanessa Paradis]] stars as Adele, a girl who attempts suicide by jumping from a bridge but is saved by knife thrower Gabor, played by [[Daniel Auteuil]], who persuades her to become his target girl.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0144201|title=Girl on the Bridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other examples include:
* In episode six of ''[[American Horror Story: Freak Show]]'', "Bullseye" (November 2014), character Elsa Mars ([[Jessica Lange]]) throws knives at Paul 'The Illustrated Seal' ([[Mat Fraser]]) as he spins on a wheel of death. 
* The fourth season of the television series ''[[Bones (TV series)|Bones]]'', featured an episode (first aired in 2009) in which title character [[Temperance "Bones" Brennan]] goes undercover as a target girl with Special Agent [[Seeley Booth]] as a knife-thrower.
* The film ''[[Gangs of New York]]'' (2002) features a confrontation between the main protagonists in which [[Cameron Diaz]]'s character Jenny Everdeane acts as a target girl in an impromptu knifethrowing act with the villain, Bill 'The Butcher' Cutting, played by [[Daniel Day-Lewis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0217505|title=Gangs of New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the television series ''[[Nikki (TV series)|Nikki]]'', the episode titled "The Jupiter and Mary Chain", first aired in 2001, featured the characters played by [[Nikki Cox]] and [[Susan Egan]] taking jobs as target girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Karel Dujardin''' (September 27, 1622{{spaced ndash}}November 20, 1678) was a [[Dutch Golden Age painter]].  Although he did a few portraits and a few [[history painting]]s of religious subjects, most of his work is small Italianate landscape scenes with animals and peasants, and other [[genre painting|genre scenes]].  Dujardin spent two extended periods, at the beginning and end of his career, in Italy, and most of his paintings and landscape etchings have an Italian or Italianate setting.

==Biography==
Karel Dujardin was a Dutch painter and [[etcher]], born in [[Amsterdam]] in 1622.  Typical of his landscape paintings is ''Farm Animals in the Shade of a Tree'' (1656; [[National Gallery]], London).  He died in [[Venice]] in 1678.

After supposedly training with [[Nicolaes Berchem]],&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, Roy (2009) ''The Collectors: Old Master Paintings'', "Karel Dujardin: ''A Horseman Holding a Roemer of Wine with an Ostler Tending the Horses''", London, Sphinx Books. {{ISBN|978-1-907200-03-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the young Dujardin went to [[Italy]], and joined the [[Bentvueghels]] group of painters in [[Rome]], among whom he was known as {{lang|it|"Barba di Becco"}}, "goat-beard", or ''Bokkebaart''.&lt;ref name=Houbraken&gt;{{Link language|nl}}&lt;!--Middle Dutch--&gt; [http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/houb005groo01_01/houb005groo01_01_0329.htm Karel de Jardyn biography] in ''De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen'' (1718) by [[Arnold Houbraken]], courtesy of the [[Digital library for Dutch literature]]&lt;/ref&gt; Here he encountered his first artistic successes.

According to Houbraken, while in [[Lyon]] in France, he contracted considerable debts, and married his (older) landlady to free himself of them. He went with her to Amsterdam, where his pictures were valued very highly.&lt;ref name=Houbraken /&gt; In 1675, he returned to Rome, on an invitation from his friend Joan Reynst and was welcomed by his old friends and admirers. Renst and Dujardin went on a [[Grand Tour]] to other Italian cities, but when Reynst went back to Amsterdam, Dujardin remained in Italy, and gave him a message for his wife that he would follow soon.&lt;ref name=Houbraken /&gt; 
[[Image:Karel Dujardin - Les Charlatans italiens.jpg|thumb|left|Karel Dujardin, [[Commedia dell'Arte]] Show, dated 1657 (Louvre)]]

He travelled on to [[Venice]] but died there unexpectedly in 1678. According to Reynst, he had said: "why should I be in a hurry to go back? I am where I want to be".&lt;ref name=Houbraken /&gt; According to his friend [[Johannes Glauber]], who he had met previously in Rome, he was painting for a Dutch merchant in Venice when he suddenly became unwell. Though he seemed to recover, his stomach was ''too full'' and he died. Though he was a member of the [[Dutch Reformed Church]], he was laid to rest in the Catholic manner (wrapped in a white shroud) and was carried to his grave by his friends [[Govert van der Leeuw]] and Glauber.&lt;ref name=Houbraken /&gt;
 
Among his pupils were Jacob II, son of [[Jacob van der Does]], [[Martinus Laeckman]], and [[Erick van den Weerelt]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://rkd.nl/en/explore/artists/24701 Karel Dujardin] in the [[RKD]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1375">'''Keypers''' are [[toy]]s in the shape of [[animal]]s that were designed with opening compartments for children to store small items in. They were made in the 1980s by [[Tonka]] Corp.

==Overview==
The Keypers characters depict animals (including a [[snail]], [[ladybug]] and [[turtle]]) and have small compartments which are intended for children to hide things in. The large adult Keypers have special keys so you can lock and unlock the compartments they have located on them. The small baby Keypers have a slit in their backs so you can squeeze, open and then hide things inside. The Keypers also have small Finders for friends. The Finders help the Keypers find lost items.

===Styles===
Various styles of Keypers were made, with many color variations depending on which country it was released in. Other variations were that some had glitter and non glittery eyes, and the adult [[bear]] even has different names depending on the [[United States|US]] or [[United Kingdom|UK]] version.

==As a collectors' item==
Some Keypers items are very rare and are now sought after by collectors or for [[nostalgia|nostalgic]] reasons. Some items can be found in [[thrift store]]s, on [[online auction]] websites like [[eBay]], and on 1980s toy-selling webpages.

The '''Mythopoeic Society''' ('''MythSoc''') is a non-profit organization devoted to the study of [[Mythopoeia|mythopoeic]] literature, particularly the works of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], [[Charles Williams (UK writer)|Charles Williams]], and [[C. S. Lewis]], all members of [[The Inklings]], an informal group of writers who met weekly in C.S. Lewis’ rooms at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], from the early 1930s through late 1949.

== History ==
The Mythopoeic Society was founded in 1967 by [[Glen H. GoodKnight]]. Originally composed of discussion groups based in the [[Los Angeles]] area, it expanded to include organized branches across North America; in 1972 it assimilated the Tolkien Society of America. Membership is open to those who read, study, or write in the genres of myth and fantasy.

== Publications ==
Three periodical publications are produced by the society:
* ''Mythprint'' is a quarterly newsletter with notices of Society activity, book reviews and articles;&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.mythsoc.org/mythprint/mythprint-history.htm "Mythprint: History and Back Issues"] Mythopoeic Society. Retrieved 2017-01-06.&lt;/ref&gt; Mythopoeic Society membership includes electronic Mythprint (PDF), also available in print format by subscription.
* ''[[Mythlore]]'', edited by [[Janet Brennan Croft]], publishes peer-reviewed articles on mythic and fantastic works, available by subscription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7LGmdAPdwDgC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=Janet+Brennan+Croft&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Fe0SUIL2CfLc4QTdk4CADA&amp;ved=0CF8Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Janet%20Brennan%20Croft&amp;f=false |title=Die aktuelle Tolkienforschung im Überblick: Personen – Organisationen – Verlage – Werke |trans-title=A Survey of Research on Tolkien: People – Organisations – Publishers – Works |language=German |first=Frank |last=Weinreich |first2=Thomas |last2=Honegger |pages=63–89 |journal=Zeitschrift für Fantastikforschung |year=2011 |issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[The Mythic Circle]]'' is a collection of original fiction and poetry, published yearly, available by subscription.

In addition to the periodicals, the society formed [http://www.mythsoc.org/press.htm The Mythopoeic Press] to publish material by and about writers of mythopoeic and fantastic literature, especially focused on The Inklings. Works published include out-of-print materials, collections of short articles and essays, and scholarly items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mythopoeic Press|url=http://www.mythsoc.org/press.htm|publisher=Mythopoeic Society|accessdate=April 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==
The society sponsors local discussion groups throughout the United States and the ''Annual Mythopoeic Conference'', also known as ''Mythcon'', generally held on college or university campuses in various locations, primarily within the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mythsoc.org/mythcon.htm Mythopoeic Conferences] Mythopoeic Society. Retrieved 2017-01-06.&lt;/ref&gt; Mythcon XX was held in Vancouver, British Columbia, in 1989. Mythcon XXIII was held at Keble College, Oxford, England, in 1992 as part of ''The J.R.R. Tolkien Centenary Conference'', co-sponsored with [[The Tolkien Society]]. Likewise, Mythcon XXXVI in 2005 was held at Aston University, Birmingham, England, combined with ''Tolkien 2005 - 50 Years of The Lord of the Rings'', sponsored by The Tolkien Society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mythsoc.org/mythcon/mythcon-history.htm History of Mythopoeic Conferences] Mythopoeic Society. Retrieved 2017-01-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mythopoeic Awards ==
{{main|Mythopoeic Awards}}
Since 1971 the Mythopoeic Society has bestowed a series of [http://www.mythsoc.org/awards.htm annual awards] to outstanding works. In 1991 the literary award was broken into two categories: the ''Mythopoeic Fantasy Award for Adult Literature'' and the ''Mythopoeic Fantasy Award for Children’s Literature''.

The ''Mythopoeic Scholarship Award in Inklings Studies'' is given to books on J.R.R. Tolkien, C.S. Lewis, and/or Charles Williams that make significant contributions to Inklings scholarship. The ''Mythopoeic Scholarship Award in Myth and Fantasy Studies'' is given to scholarly books on other specific authors in the Inklings tradition, or to more general works on the genres of myth and fantasy. For the scholarship awards, books first published during the previous three years are eligible, including finalists for previous years.

'''N.S. Bienstock, Inc.''' is one of the largest and most powerful television [[talent agency|talent agencies]] in the United States, representing more than 600 television personalities.&lt;ref name=power&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/24/business/media-a-talent-stable-that-s-huge-in-tv-news-is-it-too-big.html?pagewanted=all], accessed 02-04-2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Consistently ranked among the Top 10 of TV's most powerful,&lt;ref name=Top10&gt;[http://nsbvideos.com/images/articles/TVWeek2009.jpg], accessed 02-04-2009&lt;/ref&gt; the group represents clients ranging from [[Dan Rather]] and [[Chris Matthews]] to [[Anderson Cooper]] and [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]].&lt;ref name=press&gt;[http://www.nsbienstock.com/pg/jsp/general/press.jsp], accessed 02-04-2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Bienstock is the largest specialized agency, with more assets devoted to news and reality-based programming than any others. [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] claims the company has a "virtual monopoly on the news biz's biggest stars"&lt;ref name=history&gt;[http://www.nsbienstock.com/g/bsadvantage/487.html], accessed 02-04-2009&lt;/ref&gt; and the president of MSNBC told the New York Times that, ''They have a disproportionate share of America's news talent.
[[United Talent Agency]] acquired N.S. Bienstock on 22nd Jan 2014."&lt;ref name=power /&gt;

==History==
The company began in the 1940s as the small, New York City life insurance business of Nate Bienstock, whose client list included a number of journalists, including [[Walter Cronkite]], [[Charles Collingwood (journalist)|Charles Collingwood]] and [[Eric Sevareid]]. He sold a policy to the author John Steinbeck, who had Richard Leibner's father, Sol, as an accountant. Mr. Bienstock invited Sol Leibner into his business in 1964 and eventually sold out to him.

At the time, TV news was taking off, and Mr. Bienstock's newspaper and news agency clients were in demand at the networks. They asked for his help as they negotiated their contracts. Richard Leibner—not long out of New York University's business school—took up that part of the business and built it.

His wife and partner, Carole Cooper, whom he met on a blind date in 1962 and married in 1964, left her career as a producer of commercials to join the firm and become an agent in 1976. The firm also includes their sons, Adam and Jonathan.&lt;ref name=power /&gt;&lt;ref name=fam&gt;[http://www.observer.com/node/36439], accessed 02-04-2009&lt;/ref&gt;

But Mr. Leibner is the face of the company, perhaps best known for beginning the trend of big news salaries in the 1980s by playing the networks against one another and getting big deals for Dan Rather and Diane Sawyer. (The two now make more than $7 million and $10 million, respectively.) In the process, he has been accused of transforming journalists into something closer to Hollywood celebrities.

The agency has been at the forefront of the broadcast news business since 1964, pioneering representation of on-air and off-air talent in syndication, cable, reality television, and talk radio over the last 40+ years.  The group not only represents talent, but also pitches and packages some of the most popular programs on both television and radio.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

The [[Radio Television Digital News Association]] administers a fellowship for young professional journalists endowed by N.S. Bienstock.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rtdna.org/content/fellowship_info#.UwY3tWJdW8A&lt;/ref&gt;


In 2014 N.S. Bienstock was acquired by United Talent Agency.

[[Anthroponomastics]] is the study of personal names.

The '''Oxford University Society of Bibliophiles''' is a [[book collecting]] and [[Bibliophilia|bibliophile]] club run by, and primarily for, students at [[Oxford University]]. It was founded in 1950 by a group of young bibliophiles headed by John Granger, Bent Juel-Jensen and R. John Rickett, and the first meeting was held in Hilary Term of 1951.&lt;ref&gt;Nash and Howes 2006, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; For fifty years the Society held regular lectures, visits and other events during the University terms, and many of the leading [[Bibliography|bibliographers]], [[librarians]], book collectors, [[booksellers]] and other literary figures of the period spoke to the Society or hosted visits. Many of the Society's junior members went on to become prominent figures in the world of books, and some later served as senior members of the Society. One of the most influential members was [[John Hanbury Angus Sparrow|John Sparrow]], Warden of All Souls, who encouraged a love of books and manuscripts in a generation of students, and hosted a termly "Warden's Meeting"&lt;ref&gt;Davies et al. 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; at which members were encouraged to bring items from their own libraries to pass round and say a few words about; the tradition of the "Warden's Meeting" continued after 1986, when the Warden himself was too ill to host the meetings and, indeed, after his death in 1992. Another of the Society's traditions was the quality of the termly programme cards, often produced by the leading printers and [[private presses]] of the age, including the [[Oxford University Press|Oxford]] and [[Cambridge University Press|Cambridge]] University Presses, the [[Rampant Lions Press]], the [[Samson Press]], the [[Fantasy Press (UK)|Fantasy Press]], the [[Kit-Cat Press]], [[Big Wheel Press]], the [[Perpetua Press]], the [[Incline Press]], the [[Whittington Press]], the [[Libanus Press]], the [[Rocket Press]], the [[Stanbrook Abbey]] Press and the [[Officina Bodoni|Stamperia Valdonega]].&lt;ref&gt;Nash and Howes 2006, plates 1-4 and pp. 25-180.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a period of difficulties and disrupted activities in the last decade of the twentieth century, the Society closed in 2000, when interest among the students had declined so far that a junior committee could no longer be formed. However, due to the efforts of a new generation of Oxford students led by Geri Della Rocca de Candal, Enrico Emanuele Prodi and Matthew Cheung Salisbury, aided by Cristina Dondi, [[Richard Ovenden]] and a few surviving members of the former Society (notably [[Colin Franklin (writer and bibliographer)|Colin Franklin]] and Paul W. Nash), the Oxford University Society of Bibliophiles was refounded in [[Trinity term]] 2008 and became fully active in [[Michaelmas term]] in the same year. The first termcard for the new Society was printed by the Rampant Lions Press (and was among the last jobs printed by Sebastian Carter).

The Society's device, shown opposite, was designed by [[Michael Harvey (lettering artist)|Michael Harvey]].

'''POWER UP''' (the "'''P'''rofessional '''O'''rganization of '''W'''omen in '''E'''ntertainment '''R'''eaching Up") is an [[United States|American]] [[non-profit organization]] and film [[production company]] with the stated mission "to promote the visibility and integration of [[lesbian|gay women]] in entertainment, the arts, and all forms of media". It was founded in 2000 by  [[K. Pearson Brown]], [[Stacy Codikow]] and [[Amy Shomer]].&lt;ref name="PUHistory"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.power-up.net/celebrity_guests_include.htm |title=Challenging Perception through Film, POWER UP |accessdate=2007-05-15 |work=POWER UP |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070427101417/http://www.power-up.net/celebrity_guests_include.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its members include women and men, gay and [[heterosexual|straight]].

POWER UP provides funding and assistance to filmmakers, as well as producing its own films. After several [[short film]]s, its first [[feature film]] was the [[comedy film|comedy]] ''[[Itty Bitty Titty Committee]]'' directed by [[Jamie Babbit]].&lt;ref name="AfterEllen"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afterellen.com/people/2007/2/powerlesbians?page=0%2C1 |title=The Top 13 Power Lesbians in Entertainment in 2007 |last=Lo |first=Malinda |date=2007-02-27|work=AfterEllen.com |accessdate=2007-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, POWER UP was awarded the Leadership Award by the [[National Gay and Lesbian Task Force]].&lt;ref name="AfterEllen" /&gt;

In 2001 K. Pearson Brown, one of the founding members, brought a sexual harassment suit  against another founding member, Stacey Codikow. Codikow counter-sued alleging that Brown had made sexual overtures towards her and accusing Brown of defamation. Codikow also demanded Brown's resignation on the grounds that she was bisexual, and Brown later resigned. Both suits were dropped in late 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Welkos|first=Robert W.|title=Sexual harassment suit roils lesbian industry group|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/nov/02/entertainment/et-newwelkos2|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=November 2, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Palestinians}}
'''Palestinian art''' is a term used to refer to [[painting]]s, [[poster]]s, [[installation art]] and other visual media produced by [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] artists.

While the term has also been used to refer to ancient art produced in the geographical region of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], in its modern usage it generally refers to work of contemporary Palestinian artists.

Similar to the structure of Palestinian society, the Palestinian art field extends over four main geographic centers: the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip]]; [[Israel]]; the [[Palestinian diaspora]] in the [[Arab world]], [[Europe]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=Zvi&gt;{{cite web|title=''Hagar: Contemporary Palestinian Art''|author=Tal Ben Zvi|publisher=Hagar Association|year=2006|accessdate=06.05.2007|url=http://www.hagar-gallery.com/Catalogues/docs/PArt_eng_final.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary Palestinian art finds its roots in [[folk art]] and traditional [[Christian]] and [[Islamic]] painting popular in Palestine over the ages. After the [[Nakba Day|Nakba]] of 1948, nationalistic themes have predominated as Palestinian artists use diverse media to express and explore their connection to identity and land.&lt;ref name=Ankori&gt;{{cite book|title=''Palestinian Art''|author=[[Gannit Ankori]]|year=1996|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn=1-86189-259-4|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=SoagAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=%22palestinian+art%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
Before 1948, most Palestinian artists were self-taught, painting landscapes and religious scenes in imitation of the European style. Art exhibitions were almost unheard of. Notable artists of this era include Khalil Halaby, Nahil Bishara and Faddoul Odeh. Jamal Badran (1909–1999) was a leading artist in the Islamic style.&lt;ref&gt;[http://imeu.net/news/article00254.shtml Visual arts] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121214225723/http://imeu.net/news/article00254.shtml |date=2012-12-14 }}
IMEU, JAN 14, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Sophie Halaby studied in France and Italy before returning to teach at the Schmidt Girls College in 1935-1955.&lt;ref&gt;[http://virtualgallery.birzeit.edu/tour/cv?mart_id=71627 Sophie Halaby]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest artists to add a political dimension to his works was [[Nicola Saig]] (1863-1942). While most of the art in his day explored religious themes and non-controversial issues, Saig's work ventured into politics. Caliph Umar at Jerusalem Gates c. 1920, for example,  seems to recount a popular religious legend about Umar bloodlessly taking over Jerusalem and ushering centuries of peace between the local Christian and Jewish populations. However, upon closer look, the Christ-like stature given to the Caliph jab at what many Palestinians saw as divisive policies of the British during the Mandate Period which attempted to create friction between Muslims and Christian Arabs.&lt;ref name="Boullata, Kamal Palestinian Art 2009. pg. 33"/&gt;

After 1948, [[Ismail Shammout]], [[Naji al-ali]], [[Mustafa al-Hallaj]], [[Abdul Hay Mosallam Zarara|Abdul Hay Mosallam]]  and [[Paul Guiragossian]] tackled the painful memories of the Nabka showing massacres, refugees and clear political themes. Others such as Sophia Halaby, [[Ibrahim Ghannam]], and [[Juliana Seraphim]] focused more subtly on questions of identity including Palestinian cultural traditions, physical geography, and a surrealistic look at memories of childhood reverie.&lt;ref&gt;Boullata, Kamal Palestinian Art: From 1850 to Present Saqi Press, London, 2009. pgs. 124 - 159&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Tal Ben Zvi,  Palestinian artists after 1948 reside in four geographical territories and have no art colleges.
Thus unlike [[sovereign]] [[nation-states]] where art is based on "national borders, national museums and institutes of learning, he claims Palestinian art is based chiefly on artists operating within the frame of Palestinian identity.&lt;ref name=Zvi/&gt;

==Themes==

===Place===
[[File:Olive picking - Sliman Mansour.jpeg|thumb|220px|Olive picking, Sliman Mansour, Oil on canvas, 1988]]
Palestinian artist and art historian [[Kamal Boullata]] describes "place" as one of the major thematic components of Palestinian art throughout its history. Proximity and distance from the historical Palestinian homeland and the relationship between the artist and his current place of residence is the key element moving Palestinian art. For example, in art produced during the first decades following 1948, works created by Palestinian artists living in Israel are largely figurative, whereas those created by artists living outside the country are largely abstract.&lt;ref&gt;Boullata, Kamal Palestinian Art: From 1850 to Present Saqi Press, London, 2009. pg. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Before 1948, Jerusalem was an important theme.&lt;ref name="Boullata, Kamal Palestinian Art 2009. pg. 32"&gt;Boullata, Kamal Palestinian Art: From 1850 to Present Saqi Press, London, 2009. pg. 32&lt;/ref&gt; After 1948, memory of place and distance from homeland became a central theme.&lt;ref name="Boullata, Kamal Palestinian Art 2009. pg. 32"/&gt;  Even Palestinian artists born and raised in Israel explore alienation and a sense of growing up as foreigners in the land of their ancestors. The question of cultural memory and belonging is a recurrent theme.&lt;ref name="Boullata, Kamal Palestinian Art 2009. pg. 33"&gt;Boullata, Kamal Palestinian Art: From 1850 to Present Saqi Press, London, 2009. pg. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nidaa Badwan]] is an artist from who created a beautiful space in her room where she could isolate herself and escape from reality of Gaza. She says living in a city where she "lost basic rights as a human being" inspired her to "create an alternative world" in her room. The self-portraits taken in that room during her period of retreat have won her international recognition.&lt;ref name=arabiya&gt;{{Cite web| title = Finding creativity under siege: Gazan artist isolates herself| accessdate = 2018-06-25| url = http://english.alarabiya.net/en/life-style/art-and-culture/2015/01/24/Finding-creativity-under-siege-Gazan-artist-isolates-herself-for-over-a-year-.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alia Rayyan, director of the Al Hoash Gallery has said that Badwan is "talking about her own creation of the space, a dream actually, how life could be there, but this only works in combination with what happens outside".&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/28/world/middleeast/finding-gaza-unbearable-artist-creates-her-own-world-in-one-room.html|title=A Gaza Artist Creates 100 Square Feet of Beauty, and She's Not Budging|date=27 February 2015|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-05-02|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbols===
Key iconic symbols are keys and doors. Likewise the cactus tree plays a prominent role. According to Palestinian artist and art historian [[Samia Halaby]], "Liberation Art," or the art that resulted from the revolutionary period of Palestinian resistance that began in the late 1960s and continued through the First Intifada, "is symbolist, using images of things known to popular Palestinian culture – things that anyone experiencing Palestinian life could identify. The horse came to mean revolution. The flute came to mean the tune of the ongoing resistance. The wedding came to mean the entire Palestinian cause. The key came to mean the right of return. The sun came to mean freedom. The gun with a dove came to mean that peace would come after the struggle for liberation. Artists used the colors of the flag, patterns from embroidery, chains, etc. Village scenes, village dress, the prisoner, prison bars. There were special themes regarding the martyr. First there were generalized pictures of the martyr as well as pictures of specific individuals who had been killed by the Israelis. The second form was based on a popular practice of framing a collage of symbols representing the deceased's life then hanging it at their home or grave."&lt;ref&gt;Farhat, Maymanah. [http://www.jadaliyya.com/pages/index/6084/on-liberation-art-and-revolutionary-aesthetics_an- "On 'Liberation Art' and Revolutionary Aesthetics: An Interview with Samia Halaby"]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cactus====
The Cactus ({{lang-ar|الصبار}}) has been a motif in Palestinian art since the birth of Israel.  For Zionists, the indigenous plant became a national symbol of their attachment to the land, while Palestinians saw it as an incarnation of their national dispossession (see, for example, the Arabic version of Sahar Khalifa's '''Wild Thorns''', the Arabic title of which translates literally as '''Cactus''').  The plant served the practical function to designate territorial borders in peasant villages. In summer, the prickly pear was a common fruit eaten by people in the region. During the 1920s, the thorny tree was incorporated as a symbol of Israeli identity.&lt;ref&gt;Boullata, Kamal Palestinian Art: From 1850 to Present Saqi Press, London, 2009. pg. 184-186&lt;/ref&gt; Nicolas Saig painted the prickly pear as one of the pleasures of the era.&lt;ref&gt;Boullata, Kamal Palestinian Art: From 1850 to Present Saqi Press, London, 2009. pg. 186&lt;/ref&gt;  The cactus has also become a symbol of Palestinian defiance and sumud. Villagers incorporated it into a dance song protesting the 1917 Balfour Declaration with the phrase "Ya'ayn kuni subbara - O eye, be a cactus tree!". {{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==Contemporary==

===Modernism===
Although the Palestinian struggle stands as a great source of inspiration for many artists, Palestinian art is not solely defined by the political character of Palestine. Palestinian modern art has become part of a successive process in which [[Culture of Palestine|Palestinian culture]] and heritage play an essential role. The post [[1948 Palestinian exodus|Nakbah]] period has affected a great deal of art work, however, new generations of Palestinian artists redefined new boundaries of representation and creativity. The new generations of Palestinian artists have presented their work in a new manner reshaping the traditional representation of Palestinian art, and challenged the understanding of international audiences of the Palestinian Art and narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Farhat|first=Maymanah|title=The Unearthing of Secrets: Palestinian Art, 6+ and a Series of Transgressions|url=http://electronicintifada.net/content/unearthing-secrets-palestinian-art-6-and-series-transgressions/6879|publisher=The Electronic Intifada|accessdate=13 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Palestinian narrative through Art===
The Palestinian Israeli conflict and the narratives surrounding it gives Palestinian Art a unique character. Palestinian art often touches on two major themes, one is the potential for contemporary art to affect people's understanding of the social, cultural, and political elements of the Palestinian narrative; and the contribution this art can make in the field of art history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kathy|first=Zarur|title=Palestinian Art and Possibility: Made in Palestine, an Examination|url=http://www.nobleworld.biz/images/Zarur.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vivid political message in Palestinian contemporary art led to the realization of the so-called  "liberation art of Palestine" where Palestinian artists use art to communicate their narrative beyond the level of straightforwardness that is presented by media. There is a deep connection between the visual production of Palestinian art and the physical makeup of the land of [[History of Palestine|historical Palestine]].

Palestinian art has gone through multiple phases where the Palestinian artists dealt with cycles of production, destruction, and reestablishment due their [[Palestinian diaspora|diaspora]] from one area to another. With the continuation of the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], the artists like any other segment of the Palestinian community in the [[Palestinian Territories|Occupied Palestinian Territory]] suffer from Israeli exaction such as confiscation of art work, refusal to license artists' organizations, arson of exhibit halls, surveillance, arrests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Halaby|first=Samia|title=Liberation art of Palestine: Palestinian painting and sculpture in the second half of the 20th century|year=2001|publisher=H.T.T.B. Pub., S.A. Halaby|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Palestinian art narrative does not exclusively criticize the [[Israeli-occupied territories|Israeli occupation]], it also speak of the neglect of the [[Arab States|Arab states]], and the world at large of their struggle. A famous short novel by the Palestinian writer [[Ghassan Kanafani]], ''[[Men in the Sun]]'', speaks of the Palestinian struggle and the astonishing neglect of the international community towards their cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Maymanah|first=Farhat|title=The Unearthing of Secrets: Palestinian Art, 6+ and a Series of Transgressions|url=http://electronicintifada.net/people/maymanah-farhat|publisher=The Electronic Intifada|accessdate=13 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Picasso in Palestine'''

One of the International Art Academy's main accomplishment was its co-operation with the Dutch [[Van Abbemuseum]] in [[Eindhoven]] in bringing a [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] piece to Palestine in July, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tolan|first=Sandy|title=Picasso comes to Palestine|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/profile/sandy-tolan.html|accessdate=18 April 2013|newspaper=Al Jazeera|date=16 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It took two years of planning until the "[[List of Picasso artworks 1901–1910|Buste de Femme]]" arrived to [[Ramallah]] in the [[West Bank]]. The piece is a [[Cubism|Cubist]] rendition of a woman painted in 1943 with a value of $7.2m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The paintbrush is mightier than the M16|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2011/06/picasso-ramallah|accessdate=18 April 2013|newspaper=The Economist|date=27 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Buste de Femme" is the first modernist masterpiece to make it to [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] where it is exhibited to a Palestinian audience.  Palestinians see that the [[Picasso]] piece made it through protocols, peace agreements, and checkpoints to demonstrate Picasso's saying : Painting is not made to decorate houses, it is an instrument of offensive and defensive war against the enemy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Susan|first=Cole|title=Picasso In Palestine: Art meets Politics|url=http://www.nowtoronto.com/movies/story.cfm?content=191264|accessdate=18 April 2013|newspaper=Now Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Palestinian artists in Israel==
There is a significant difference between the Palestinian artists beyond the [[Green Line (Israel)|Green Line]] and the ones called "the Palestinian artists of 48". The artists born after 1948 are usually divided between the older painters and sculptors who acted during the 1970s and the 1980s, and the younger generation of artists who became active in the 1990s. The first, older generation comprises about twenty painters and sculptors who were born into the period of military rule over the Palestinian minority (1948–1966) and who studied art in Israel and abroad in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ben Zvi|first=Tal|title=Landscape Representations in Palestinian Art and Israeli Art Discourse: The Case of Asim Abu Shaqra|journal=[[Journal of Levantine Studies]]|url=http://www.levantine-journal.org/Landscape+Representations+in+Palestinian+Art+and+Israeli+Art+Discourse+The+Case+of+Asim+Abu+Shaqra_h_hd_77_14.aspx|access-date=2014-03-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219010140/http://www.levantine-journal.org/Landscape+Representations+in+Palestinian+Art+and+Israeli+Art+Discourse+The+Case+of+Asim+Abu+Shaqra_h_hd_77_14.aspx|archive-date=2014-02-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They include artists such as [[Souad Nasr Makhoul]], Terese Nasr Azzam, [[Ibrahim Nubani]] and [[Abed Abdi]], the latter who is considered to be a pioneer in the Arab Israeli art movement. The younger generation of artists became active after the Oslo agreements and now amounts to more than 200 art school graduates creating mainly installations, photography, video art and performances. The last decade shows a noticeable increase in the number of Palestinian students in Israeli art academies such as in the [[Bezalel Academy of Art and Design]].&lt;ref name="City Mouse Magazine"&gt;{{cite news|last=Halperin|first=Neta|title=The Palestinian art scene is flourishing|url=http://www.mouse.co.il/CM.articles_item,416,209,67122,.aspx|accessdate=18 April 2013|newspaper=City Mouse Magazine (Tel Aviv)|date=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Hisham Zreiq]], [[Ahlam Shibli]], Sami Bukhari, Reida Adon, Ashraf Fawakhry, Ahlam Jomah, [[Jumana Emil Abboud]], and Anisa Ashkar are Palestinian artists — most of whom are graduates from art schools in Israel and form part of an entire generation of Palestinians, [[Arab citizens of Israel|citizens of Israel]] born after [[Six-Day War|1967]].&lt;ref name=Zvi/&gt;

The issue of identity for Palestinian citizens of Israel is a key subject of importance to the artwork produced. This identity is described by [[Azmi Bishara]] as followed:
&lt;blockquote&gt;From both the historical and theoretical perspectives, the Arabs in Israel are part of the Palestinian Arab people. Their definition as 'Israeli Arabs' was formed concurrent with the emergence of the issue of the [[Palestinian refugees]], and the establishment of the State of Israel on the ruins of the Palestinian people. Thus, the point of departure from which the history of the Palestinians in Israel is written is the very point in which the history of the Palestinians outside Israel was created. One cannot point at a nationality or national group called 'Israeli Arabs' or 'the Arabs of Israel'.&lt;ref name=Zvi/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ben Zvi suggests that this definition pinpoints the dialectic underpinning the identity of this group of artists who are identified "on the one hand, as part of a broad Palestinian cultural system, and on the other — in a differentiated manner — as the Palestinian minority in Israel."&lt;ref name=Zvi/&gt;

The issue of identity becomes particularly clear in an artwork of the Palestinian artist [[Raafat Hattab]] from [[Jaffa]]. The video performance "untitled" was part of the exhibition "Men in the Sun" in the Herzliya Museum of Contemporary Art in 2009. In the work, Raafat Hattab is seen as he poures water into a bucket in order to lengthily water an olive tree which is a sign for the lost paradise before [[1948 Palestinian exodus|1948]]. The scene is primed by the song ''Hob'' (Love) by the Lebanese [[Ahmad Kaabour]] which expresses the need for Palestinian solidarity. The chorus repeats the phrase "I left a place" and it seems as if the video is dealing with memory. But as the camera zooms out, the spectator realizes that Hattab and the olive tree both actually stand in the middle of the [[Rabin Square]], a main place in [[Tel Aviv]], and the water used for watering the tree comes from the nearby fountain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Description of Raafat Hattab's work|url=http://www.men-in-the-sun.com/EN/raafat-hattab|publisher=The Men in the Sun|accessdate=18 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
"In my installations I appear in different identities that combined are my identity — a Palestinian minority in Israel and a queer minority in the Palestinian culture", explains Rafaat Hattab in an interview with the Tel Avivian City Mouse Magazine.&lt;ref name="City Mouse Magazine"&gt;{{cite news|last=Halperin|first=Neta|title=The Palestinian art scene is flourishing|url=http://www.mouse.co.il/CM.articles_item,416,209,67122,.aspx|accessdate=18 April 2013|newspaper=City Mouse Magazine (Tel Aviv)|date=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asim Abu Shaqra's focus of the sabra plant (prickly pear cactus) in his paintings is another example of the centrality of identity, especially vis-a-vie the Palestinian subject's Israeli counterpart, in Palestinian art. Tal Ben Zvi writes that Abu Shaqra is one of the very few Palestinian artists, who have succeeded in entering the canon of Israeli art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ben Zvi|first=Tal|title=Landscape Representations in Palestinian Art and Israeli Art Discourse: The Case of Asim Abu Shaqra|journal=Journal of Levantine Studies|volume=3|issue=2|pages=115|url=http://www.levantine-journal.org/Landscape+Representations+in+Palestinian+Art+and+Israeli+Art+Discourse+The+Case+of+Asim+Abu+Shaqra_h_hd_77_14.aspx|access-date=2014-03-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219010140/http://www.levantine-journal.org/Landscape+Representations+in+Palestinian+Art+and+Israeli+Art+Discourse+The+Case+of+Asim+Abu+Shaqra_h_hd_77_14.aspx|archive-date=2014-02-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Abu Shaqra painted various paintings featuring the sabra, both a symbol for the Palestinian Nakba and a symbol for the new Israeli and his work stirred up a debate in the Israeli art discourse over the image of the sabra in Israeli culture and over questions of cultural appropriation and ownership of this image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ben Zvi|first=Tal|title=http://www.levantine-journal.org/Landscape+Representations+in+Palestinian+Art+and+Israeli+Art+Discourse+The+Case+of+Asim+Abu+Shaqra_h_hd_77_14.aspx|journal=Journal of Levantine Studies|volume=3|issue=2|pages=118|url=http://www.levantine-journal.org/Landscape+Representations+in+Palestinian+Art+and+Israeli+Art+Discourse+The+Case+of+Asim+Abu+Shaqra_h_hd_77_14.aspx|access-date=2014-03-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219010140/http://www.levantine-journal.org/Landscape+Representations+in+Palestinian+Art+and+Israeli+Art+Discourse+The+Case+of+Asim+Abu+Shaqra_h_hd_77_14.aspx|archive-date=2014-02-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israeli art historian Gideon Ofrat argues that understanding Palestinian art requires familiarity with the complexities of Palestinian culture, language and history, and therefore attempts by Israeli art critics to analyze Palestinian art are doomed to failure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/culture/arts-leisure/two-palestinians-make-guest-appearance-on-tel-aviv-s-art-scene.premium-1.482499 Two Palestinians make guest appearance on Tel Aviv's art scene, [[Haaretz]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Souad Nasr (Makhoul), Palestinian woman painter based in Haifa is very known artist, most of her works deal with women from universal point of view .Souad also is city and regional planner, her earlier works in art were inspired by the remains of the old Palestinian Arab demolished quarters and expressed them very strongly in her works, In addition to a large series of documentary works  : paintings, etchings and drawings of historical buildings and neighborhoods in Haifa and other cities, in which she expressed the significant urban design and architerctural motives.
Her current paintings mainly express woman's universal sentimentality and soul through the body language and the interaction with the nature in which she try to outline how aesthetic valuing is embedded in our relationship with nature, and its ecological aesthetic qualities such as variety, diversity and harmony. 
In her acrylic works she uses mostly to paint on recycled-environmental paper which has special texture effect, and as part of the debates about environmental protection.

==Exhibitions==

===Museums===
[[Image:L. A. Mayer Institute P4110089.JPG|thumb|right|220px|The [[L.A. Mayer Institute for Islamic Art]]]]
In 2008, the [[L. A. Mayer Institute for Islamic Art]] in Jerusalem, a museum mainly dedicated to antiquities and ethnographic works, presented the first show of local Arab contemporary artists in a public Israeli museum. It was also the first exhibition in an Israeli museum which was organised by an Arab curator, [[Farid Abu Shakra]].&lt;ref name="The Art Newspaper"&gt;{{cite news|last=Feldinger|first=Lauren Gelfond|title=First show of Arab contemporary art in Israeli museum|url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/First-show-of-Arab-contemporary-art--in-Israeli-musem/16262|accessdate=15 April 2013|newspaper=The Art Newspaper|date=7 October 2008}}{{Dead link|date=December 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theme of the exhibition, Correspondence, is dealing with the complex situation of [[Arab citizens of Israel|Arab citizens in Israel]]. It can be seen as a reflexion on the different cultures to which Arab artists in Israel are exposed, on Western influences and Arab traditions, Jewish life, Palestinian cause and the search of a proper identity.&lt;ref name="The Jewish Forward"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lando|first=Michal|title=Between Two Cultures: In Jerusalem, a Breakthrough Show of Works by Arab-Israelis|url=http://forward.com/articles/14176/between-two-cultures-/|accessdate=15 April 2013|newspaper=The Jewish Forward|date=19 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Although not all art works presented are political, many refer to collective experiences of the Palestinian people, showing lost Arab villages and divided landscapes and evoking thus the [[1948 Palestinian exodus|Nakba]].&lt;ref name="The Art Newspaper"&gt;{{cite news|last=Feldinger|first=Lauren Gelfond|title=First show of Arab contemporary art in Israeli museum|url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/First-show-of-Arab-contemporary-art--in-Israeli-musem/16262|accessdate=15 April 2013|newspaper=The Art Newspaper|date=7 October 2008}}{{Dead link|date=December 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Besides the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], some works question traditions and customs within the Arab culture by dealing with gender and superstition.&lt;ref name="The Jewish Forward"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lando|first=Michal|title=Between Two Cultures: In Jerusalem, a Breakthrough Show of Works by Arab-Israelis|url=http://forward.com/articles/14176/between-two-cultures-/|accessdate=15 April 2013|newspaper=The Jewish Forward|date=19 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the director of the Museum, the Jewish Israeli Rachel Hasson, it was rather difficult to raise funds for the exhibition among Jewish, Muslim or Arab communities. In the Art Newspaper she is quoted: "For Arabs, we are not Arab enough and for Jews, we are not Jewish enough."&lt;ref name="The Art Newspaper"&gt;{{cite news|last=Feldinger|first=Lauren Gelfond|title=First show of Arab contemporary art in Israeli museum|url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/First-show-of-Arab-contemporary-art--in-Israeli-musem/16262|accessdate=15 April 2013|newspaper=The Art Newspaper|date=7 October 2008}}{{Dead link|date=December 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In summer 2009, the [[Herzliya Museum of Contemporary Art]] held the exhibition "Men in the Sun" presenting art works by 13 Palestinian contemporary artists who live and work in Israel. The name of the exhibition is borrowed from [[Ghassan Kanafani|Ghassan Kanafani's]] [[Men in the Sun|novel]] with the same title. The show was curated by the Palestinian artist and architect Hanna Farah-Kufer Bir'im and the Jewish Israeli art historian Tal Ben Zvi. The participating artists were from different generations and using different techniques from painting to video installations and architecture.&lt;ref name="Men in the Sun"&gt;{{cite web|title=Exhibition in Herzliya Museum|url=http://www.men-in-the-sun.com|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The leitmotif of the exhibition was location and territory. Most of the works deal with the sense of belonging to the Palestinian territory, some evoke the right to return or are about the forgotten history of places like in Jaffa.&lt;ref name=ynet&gt;{{cite news|last=Walder|first=Orit Hasson|title=Palestinian art show in Herzliya Museum|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3744709,00.html|accessdate=15 April 2013|newspaper=ynet|date=11 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the beginning of 2012, the [[Tel Aviv Museum of Art]] in a collaboration with the [[Um el-Fahem Art Gallery]] showed a retrospective of the Arab Israeli artists [[Walid Abu Shakra]]. The show was curated by the Jewish Israeli Irith Hadar and Walid's brother Farid Abu Shakra.&lt;ref name="Tel Aviv Museum of Art"&gt;{{cite web|title=Exhibition Tel Aviv Museum|url=http://www.tamuseum.com/about-the-exhibition/walid-abu-shakra-mintarat-albatten|publisher=Tel Aviv Museum of Art|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Born in [[Umm al-Fahm|Umm el-Fahem]] in 1946 and now based in London, the exhibition shows the strong ties which Walid Abu Shakra holds with his birthplace. The name of the exhibition, "Mintarat al-Batten", refers to a hill near his hometown which, due to its strategic position, became the site of a watchtower.&lt;ref name="Umm el-Fahem Art Gallery"&gt;{{cite web|title=website Umm el-Fahem Art Gallery|url=http://umelfahemgallery.org/?page_id=25317|publisher=Umm el-Fahem Art Gallery|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Because of the population explosion in the region, the picturesque landscapes are disappearing and the slopes of the watchtower hill are now covered with new residential neighbourhoods. The artist hoped that thanks to the exhibition, "all my friends, family and residents of the village who came to see the work will show more love and seriousness in their attitude toward the landscape that remains in the village."&lt;ref name=Haaretz&gt;{{cite news|last=Azoulay|first=Ellie Armon|title=Distant Landscapes|url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/magazine/distant-landscapes-1.407118|accessdate=15 April 2013|newspaper=Haaretz|date=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea for the exhibition and its collaboration with the Um el-Fahrem Art Gallery was a fruit of the friendship between Mordechai Omer, the former director of the Tel Aviv Museum of Art, and the Abu Shakra family. Omer died before the opening of show.&lt;ref name="Umm el-Fahem Art Gallery"&gt;{{cite web|title=website Umm el-Fahem Art Gallery|url=http://umelfahemgallery.org/?page_id=25317|publisher=Umm el-Fahem Art Gallery|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Umm el-Fahem Museum of Contemporary Art project===

In 1996, Said Abu Shakra, the third brother of the Abu Shakra family, founded in his hometown [[Um al-Fahm|Umm el-Fahem]] the only art gallery for Palestinian and Arab art in Israel and has now plans for its extension. He wants to build a museum nearby the city which would be the first contemporary art museum of the Arab sector in Israel.&lt;ref name="Umm el-Fahem Art Gallery"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://umelfahemgallery.org/?page_id=25661|publisher=Umm el-Fahem Art Gallery|accessdate=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project, worth 30 Million Dollar, is still at an early stage.&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sherwood|first=Harriet|title=Israel to get first museum of Arab art and culture|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/view-from-jerusalem-with-harriet-sherwood/2011/mar/10/new-museum-umm-al-fahm|accessdate=17 April 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an international competition, Amnon Bar Or, Lior Tsionov, and Lior Vitkon, a team of Jewish architects, had been chosen. With the help of the [[American Friends of Umm el-Fahem]] (AFUEF) and the [[Middle East Center for the Arts]] (MECA), funds had been raised to secure the first phase of the project.&lt;ref name=MECA&gt;{{cite web|title=website MECA|url=http://www.themeca.org/blog/tag/umm-el-fahem-museum-of-contemporary-art/|publisher=Middle East Center for the Arts|accessdate=17 April 2013}}{{dead|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum shall not only host exhibitions but also an archive collecting testimonies of Arab "elders" who witnessed the conflicts of the 20th century. The oral testimonies – ranging from the British mandate period to the creation of the Israeli state and the Arab-Israeli wars – are transcribed in Arabic, Hebrew and English and photographs are taken.&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sherwood|first=Harriet|title=Israel to get first museum of Arab art and culture|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/view-from-jerusalem-with-harriet-sherwood/2011/mar/10/new-museum-umm-al-fahm|accessdate=17 April 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Established in 2008, 250 testimonies are already recorded of which one third has died since. Along with the museum, there will be classrooms and an auditorium for Arab Israeli students, a library and a café.&lt;ref name="Friends of Umm el-Fahem"&gt;{{cite web|title=website Friends of Umm el-Fahem|url=http://www.friendsofummelfahem.com/about/archive.php|publisher=Friends of Umm el-Fahem|accessdate=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existing gallery has already begun to acquire a collection for the further museum through donations and gifts. Thus, works of artists like [[Fatma Abu Roumi]], [[Assam Abu Shakra]], [[Tyseer Barakat]], [[Assaf Evron]], [[Khalid Hourani]], [[Menashe Kadishman]], and [[Sliman Mansour]] are already in its possession. In addition to contemporary art, the museum will also expose traditional Arab embroidery works from the local region.&lt;ref name="Umm el-Fahem Art Gallery"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://umelfahemgallery.org/?page_id=25661|publisher=Umm el-Fahem Art Gallery|accessdate=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[The Guardian]], Said Abu Shakra wants to create thus "an inviting place, capable of embracing and enriching; bridging gaps and connecting different cultures. All of this in the heart of a troubled, war-weary region," where "Jewish people [have] the chance to touch the pain, the history and the culture of Arab people"&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sherwood|first=Harriet|title=Israel to get first museum of Arab art and culture|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/view-from-jerusalem-with-harriet-sherwood/2011/mar/10/new-museum-umm-al-fahm|accessdate=17 April 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project had to be inaugurated in 2013, but it was cancelled due to lack of budget, when sponsors from Gulf states found out the Israeli government is supporting the creation of the museum. Abu Shakra had to give up on the plan to build a new museum. He currently tries to receive an official recognition as a museum in the gallery’s present 1700 square meter building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/culture/.premium-1.662641 | title=When Is an Arab Museum Not an Arab Museum? | publisher=Haaretz | accessdate=22 August 2016 | author=Shany Littman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Galleries===

In 1996, after 25 years of police service, Said Abu Shakra decided to open the first art gallery in Israel entirely dedicated to contemporary Palestinian art in his hometown Umm el-Fahem, the [[Umm el-Fahem Art Gallery]]. Nevertheless, besides Palestinian and Arab artists, the gallery does also showcase Jewish and foreign artists. Indeed, when in 1999 [[Yoko Ono]] exhibited her art in the gallery, the institution came to public attention. According to the [[BBC]], the Japanese artist wanted "to "balance" a show of her work in the Israel Museum in Jerusalem". Some of her art work is still shown in the permanent exhibition of the gallery.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news|last=Patience|first=Martin|title=Israeli Arab gallery breaks taboos|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4790428.stm|accessdate=17 April 2013|newspaper=BBC News website|date=10 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gallery promotes mainly temporary shows, dealing with a wide range of subjects but sometimes with a special focus on memory and history of the region. This is in accordance with the 2008 started project of an archive collecting Palestinian testimonies (see [[Palestinian art#The Umm el-Fahem Museum of Contemporary Art project|The Umm el-Fahem Museum of Contemporary Art project]]).&lt;ref name=MECA /&gt; Besides the exhibitions and the archive, the gallery offers symposiums, activities and educational workshops around topics such as art but also sensitive issues such as the role of women or children at risk.{{cite web|url=http://umelfahemgallery.org/?page_id=25323|publisher=Umm el-Fahem Art Gallery|accessdate=17 April 2013}}

Umm el-Fahem, the biggest Arab city in Israel, is known for its conservative Islam but Said Abu Shakran says that he does not have any problems with anybody in the town. None of the exhibitions shows nudity and the gallery invites the town's religious leaders to its exhibition openings.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news|last=Patience|first=Martin|title=Israeli Arab gallery breaks taboos|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4790428.stm|accessdate=17 April 2013|newspaper=BBC News website|date=10 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the Palestinian artist [[Ahmad Canaan]] and the Jewish Israeli entrepreneurs [[Amir Neuman Ahuvia]] and [[Yair Rothman]] established the [[Jaffa Art Salon]].&lt;ref name="NY Times"&gt;{{cite news|last=David|first=Ariel|title=Dialogue by Way of Art in Israel|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/23/arts/23iht-rartisrael23.html?pagewanted=1&amp;tntemail1=y&amp;emc=tnt&amp;_r=0|accessdate=17 April 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=22 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; First planned as a contemporary exhibition and hosted by the [[Tel Aviv-Yafo Municipality]], it turned thanks to its success into an established gallery. The gallery is located in an old warehouse in the [[Jaffa Port|Jaffa port]]. From 2010 to 2011, the gallery hosted shows from various Palestinian artists from within the Israeli territory and from beyond the [[Green Line (Israel)|Greenline]] and from [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bogen|first=Amir|title=Palestinian gallery opens in Jaffa port|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3979577,00.html|accessdate=17 April 2013|newspaper=ynet news|date=11 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2012, the Art Salon opened it shows featuring both Jewish Israeli and Arab artists.&lt;ref name="Jaffa Art Salon"&gt;{{cite web|title=website Jaffa Art Salon|url=http://www.jaffaartsalon.com/gallery-info.html|publisher=Jaffa Art Salon|accessdate=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Palestinian artists in the Arab world==
Originating from the Palestinian culture that crystallized in the refugee camps mainly in [[Lebanon]] and [[Jordan]], Palestinian artists in the Arab world were among the first to put forward a vision of Palestinian contemporary art.&lt;ref name=Zvi/&gt; As the Palestinian Authority became more central to [[Palestinian nationalism]], their number and influence in the Palestinian art field has decreased, and diasporic Palestinian artists in Europe and the United States, have become increasingly prominent.&lt;ref name=Zvi/&gt;

One such artist whose works were exhibited in the ''Made in Palestine'' exhibit that toured the United States in 2005 is [[Mustafa Al-Hallaj]].&lt;ref name=Curiel&gt;{{cite web|title=Unknown face of Palestinian art|author=Jonathan Curiel|publisher=San Francisco Chronicler|date=April 3, 2005|accessdate=06.05.2007|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2005/04/03/ING74C1ATK1.DTL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in what is now Israel, Al-Hallaj is known throughout the Arab world, where he has been described as "Syria's most famous artist" and an "icon of contemporary Arab graphic arts."&lt;ref name=Curiel/&gt; Al Hallaj died in 2002 in a fire at his home while trying to save his artwork.&lt;ref name=Curiel/&gt; In ''Self-Portrait as God, the Devil, and Man'', Al-Hallaj uses rows of overlapping images and intricate etchings that took 10 years to complete to present "an epic retelling of the history of Palestinians from the 11th century B.C. to the present."&lt;ref name=Curiel/&gt;

==Palestinian artists in the US and in Europe==
[[Image:Sama Alshaibi "Zero Sum Game".jpg|thumb|widthpx|[[Sama Alshaibi]]'s solo exhibition "Zero Sum Game" in London ]]
A number of prominent Palestinian artists live and work outside of the Arab world, namely in the US and in Europe. Notable among them are leading international conceptual artists [[Mona Hatoum]], who is based in London, and [[Emily Jacir]], who is based between New York and Ramallah. Prominent painters such as [[Jumana El Husseini]], [[Kamal Boullata]] and [[Hani Zurob]] are based in France, while pioneering abstract painter Samia Halaby has resided in New York since the late 1970s. Rising new media artists Larissa Sansour (based in Denmark), [[Bissan Rafe]] (based in USA and The Netherlands), and [[Sama Raena Alshaibi]] (based in USA); have also become one of the recent new names in the Palestinian daispora spotlight. Such artists have played a crucial role in developing and expanding contemporary Palestinian art by pushing for the acceptance of the Palestinian narrative in the mainstream art world despite apparent hostilities, controversies, and setbacks due to blatant censorship and various political contexts. While the subject of Palestine has remained paramount for such artists, especially in light of forced exiles, many in the diaspora have maintained cutting-edge approaches, gaining recognition for the new and innovative ways through which they approach Palestine's complex history, its current reality, and uncertain future.

In 2009, [[Steve Sabella]] researched the value of Palestinian art from a fiscal point of view as part of his master thesis at [[Sotheby's Institute of Art]] in London. He analysed how Palestinian artists needed to get connected with cultural institutions and influential curators to achieve international recognition and art market success outside of Palestine. They became the mediators and the connecting link between the artists and the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sabella|first=Steve|title=RECONSIDERING THE VALUE OF PALESTINIAN ART &amp;ITS JOURNEY INTO THE ART MARKET|journal=Contemporary Practices Art Journal|year=2010 / 2011 (two parts)|volume=VII &amp; VIII|pages=80–100|url=http://stevesabella.com/reconsidering-the-value-of-Palestinian-art.pdf|accessdate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[New York Times]], collectors are reaching out for Palestinian art because prices are still comparably low ranging from $500 to $10,000. Yair Rothman, an Irsaeli art entrepreneur, is quoted that "prices have already tripled in the last three, four years, but there is still room for an increase."&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite news|last=David|first=Ariel|title=Dialogue by Way of Art in Israel|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/23/arts/23iht-rartisrael23.html?pagewanted=2&amp;tntemail1=y&amp;_r=0&amp;emc=tnt|accessdate=17 April 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=22 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9903">'''Paranoid fiction''' is a term sometimes used to describe works of [[literature]] that explore the [[Subjectivity|subjective]] nature of reality and how it can be manipulated by forces in power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/new_literary_history/v028/28.1flieger.html Postmodern Perspective: The Paranoid Eye. ''New Literary History''.Volume 28, Number 1, Winter 1997, pp. 87-109]&lt;/ref&gt;  These forces can be external, such as a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] government, or they can be internal, such as a character's [[mental illness]] or refusal to accept the harshness of the world he or she is in.

Unlike [[speculative fiction]], paranoid fiction is written in a way so as to imply that the story may only be a [[delusion]] of the characters, instead of treating it as an [[alternate history]] or an [[fictional universe|in-fiction universe]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==History==
The elements of paranoid fiction can be seen in works dating as far back as the late 19th and early 20th century. Some of [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s novels contained paranoid and psychologically troubled characters set against the dark backdrop of a modernizing [[Russia]]. [[Franz Kafka]], in particular, was known for his exaggerated accounts of what he portrayed as real life in his works, to enhance the absurdity of the life themes they conveyed.  Similarly, [[George Orwell]]'s works, while not as exaggerated, confirmed the practice of using [[dystopia]]n fiction to take a different outlook on highly common themes, including identity and personal desires.

The term ''paranoid fiction'' was first coined to label sensationalistic and off-beat stories as bizarre and thus outside the realm of literary fiction.  Starting after [[World War I]], however, [[modernism|modernists]] began exploring the stranger themes of life in art, in response to the themes of death being effectively mechanized and made impossible to toy with by the war's graphic depictions.  As a result, modernist literature tended to explore the meaning and construction of reality, shifting away from the progressive, cause-and-effect structure of [[Literary realism|realist]] fiction towards a more complex and disjointed depiction of reality.&lt;ref&gt;Lye, John (1997). [http://www.brocku.ca/english/courses/2F55/modernism.html "Some Attributes of Modernist Literature."]&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War II]], [[absurdism|absurdists]] carried this focus one step further by placing these common themes in surreal and fantastic settings, turning what would have been otherwise mundane concepts into distinctive, stand-out ones, thus converting the paranoid fiction genre into a legitimate one.

[[Philip K. Dick]] is most frequently viewed as the forefather of the modern paranoid fiction.  His works were born out of paranoia and hallucination; he had sudden visions of places he'd never been to and events he'd never witnessed, possibly from [[temporal lobe epilepsy]] or an overly active imagination.  These visions were so vivid that Dick put them down on paper, never failing to classify them as only "speculative thought," and thus outside the boundary of conventional thought.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Erik. [http://www.techgnosis.com/pkdnet.html "Philip K. Dick's Divine Interference."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205050412/http://techgnosis.com/pkdnet.html |date=2006-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of Dick's works start out uneventfully in a seemingly ordinary setting, then transpose to a [[surrealism|surrealistic]] [[fantasy]], with the characters discovering that what they thought real was in fact a delusion.  Throughout his works, Dick maintained a balance between the expected traits of the [[science fiction]] genre they were also categorized in, and the eccentric and disturbing elements coming from his mind.&lt;ref name="paranoid"&gt;[http://www.strangewords.com/archive/paranoia.html "Strange Words: Paranoid."]&lt;/ref&gt;  A recurring theme in his works is on how reality is perceived and treated differently by people depending on their mindsets.

At its most basic, paranoid fiction refers specifically to works about speculations and possible conspiracies by people in power, told by an [[unreliable narrator]].&lt;ref name="paranoid"/&gt;  However, the most popular type of paranoid fiction has proved to be one in which the universe appears on the surface to be definite and real, but upon closer inspection, to actually be deceptive and deliberately misleading.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}  In these works, there are either questions raised as to the realness of the world the characters are living in, or a distinction made between a fantasy world and its reality.

Paranoid fiction often overlaps with many other genres, most commonly [[dystopia]]n fiction, [[science fiction]], and [[film noir]], sharing many of its main themes and literary devices.  Generally, however, paranoid fiction avoids explicitly defined themes and concrete [[Motif (literature)|motif]]s in favor of [[allegory|allegories]] and ambiguous [[symbol]]ism to emphasize the dreamlike and unreal nature of the characters' world.&lt;ref name="sanmasonic"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091027080230/http://geocities.com/sanmasonic/Paranoid/ "Paranoid Fiction."]&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, a purely dystopian work typically explores the mechanisms and motives of the totalitarian state to keep its people under control, whereas one of paranoid fiction would concentrate more on the effects of the state on its inhabitants' mental and [[emotional well-being]], and its implications on the decadent condition of society.  George Orwell's ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' can be viewed as a balance of the two, depicting the Party as crushing free will through a strictly defined [[Newspeak|language]] and constant monitoring, but also through psychological torture and the distorting of people's viewpoints on what is true and what is false.

To further increase their "[[magic realism]]," works of paranoid fiction often employ common devices and archetypes from other genres, including a detective-solving structure, plot twists, or philosophical themes, to create a [[surrealism|surrealistic]] tone and an atmosphere of fear and dread.  Plots also tend to be fanciful and occasionally futuristic to emphasize their inherent absurdity and imaginativeness, but also maintain some measure of realism to comment on how apparently unrealistic stories can, in fact, be (often frighteningly) closer to real life than one might think at first glance.&lt;ref name="sanmasonic"/&gt;

Sometimes paranoid fiction will strongly imply, and occasionally admit outright, that its constructed world is a lie or an illusion.  In this case, the plot will center on the main character's struggle between the physical and spiritual; i.e. the actual world they are in, versus the world they want to see and believe in. Here, the cause of the fantasy is the protagonist's internal desires, doubts, and suspicions.  Such works tend to be more introspective and focused on the individual, than on a community or a regime.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

'''Purism''', referring to the arts, was a movement that took place between 1918 and 1925 that influenced French painting and architecture. Purism was led by [[Amédée Ozenfant]] and [[Le Corbusier|Charles Edouard Jeanneret (Le Corbusier)]]. Ozenfant and Le Corbusier created a variation of the [[Cubism|Cubist]] movement and called it Purism: where objects are represented as elementary forms devoid of detail. The main concepts were presented in their book ''Après le Cubisme'' (After Cubism) published in 1918.&lt;ref name="Ozenfant and Purism"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ball|first=Susan|title=Ozenfant and Purism: The Evolution of a Style 1915–1930|year=1981|publisher=UMI Research Press|location=Ann Arbor, Michigan|pages=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tate"&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/p/purism Purism, Tate]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post World War I==

Le Corbusier and Ozenfant were the creators of Purism. [[Fernand Léger]] was a principle associate.&lt;ref name="Tate" /&gt; Purism was an attempt to restore regularity in a war-torn France post World War I.&lt;ref name="Ozenfant and Purism"/&gt; Unlike what they saw as 'decorative' fragmentation of objects in Cubism, Purism proposed a style of painting where elements were represented as robust simplified forms with minimal detail, while embracing technology and the machine.&lt;ref name="Tate" /&gt;

Purism culminated in Le Corbusier’s ''Pavillon de l'Esprit Nouveau'' (Pavilion of the New Spirit), constructed for the [[International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts]] in 1925. This included the work of Cubists [[Juan Gris]] and [[Jacques Lipchitz]]. Following this exhibition the relationship between Le Corbusier and Ozenfant declined.&lt;ref name="Tate" /&gt;

Ozenfant and Le Corbusier contributed extensively to an art magazine called ''L'Esprit Nouveau'' from 1920 to 1925 serving as a platform for propaganda towards their Purist movement.&lt;ref name="Ozenfant and Purism"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eliel, Carol S. et al.

==Purist Manifesto==
The Purist Manifesto lays out the rules Ozenfant and Le Corbusier created to govern the Purist movement.&lt;ref name="Ozenfant and Purism"/&gt;

* Purism does not intend to be a scientific art, which it is in no sense.
* Cubism has become a decorative art of romantic ornamentism.
* There is a hierarchy in the arts: decorative art is at the base, the human figure at the summit.
* Painting is as good as the intrinsic qualities of its plastic elements, not their representative or narrative possibilities.
* Purism wants to conceive clearly, execute loyally, exactly without deceits; it abandons troubled conceptions, summary or bristling executions. A serious art must banish all techniques not faithful to the real value of the conception.
* Art consists in the conception before anything else.
* Technique is only a tool, humbly at the service of the conception.
* Purism fears the bizarre and the ''original''. It seeks the pure element in order to reconstruct organized paintings that seem to be facts from nature herself. 
* The method must be sure enough not to hinder the conception.
* Purism does not believe that returning to nature signifies the copying of nature.
* It admits all deformation is justified by the search for the invariant.
* All liberties are accepted in art except those that are unclear.&lt;ref name="Ozenfant and Purism"/&gt;

The '''Sabouroff head''' is an important example of Late Archaic Greek marble sculpture. It is dated to circa ca. 550-525 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Snodgrass |first1=Anthony M. |title=Archaic Greece: The Age of Experiment |date=1981 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=9780520043732 |page=182 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JVwWJAoUWRgC&amp;pg=PA182 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture was named after [[Peter Alexandrovich Saburov]], a collector of ancient Greek sculpture and antiquities. It is 23 centimeters in height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Arachne - individual object 80830: Kopf eines bärtigen Mannes (sog. Kopf Sabouroff) - Berlin, Staatliche Museen, Antikensammlung Berlin |url=http://arachne.uni-koeln.de/item/objekt/80830 |website=arachne.uni-koeln.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sabouroff head, which may have belonged to a life-size statue, has been the object of various debate regarding the unusual design of the heard and beard. Men usually had long hair in 6th century Greek statues, but the beard was a common attribute in archaic sculpture. The treatment of the moustache, separate from the beard on the cheeks and chin, is very rare for Greek sculture and gives an exotic look to the head.&lt;ref name="MS"/&gt;

The head has been described as "nearer to a [[portrait]] than any other work surviving from Archaic Greece" (other from [[Boxer Stele Fragment from Kerameikos|the Boxer Relief in Athens]]).&lt;ref name="MS"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stieber |first1=Mary |title=The Poetics of Appearance in the Attic Korai |date=2010 |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=9780292773493 |page=98 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DaIAAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA98 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sculpture, originally from [[Athens]] or [[Aegina]], is now located in the [[Altes Museum]] in [[Berlin]]. There are conjecture that it may also have been from [[Caria]] in [[Asia Minor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Morris |first1=Sarah P. |title=Daidalos and the Origins of Greek Art |date=1995 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=069100160X |page=298 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zqtx2tpGAk4C&amp;pg=PA298 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Single Screen''' game perspective can apply to all video games in which the entire playfield is shown on the screen, and the player character is unable to move beyond the boundaries of the screen either to a) scroll the game world (e.g. [[Mappy]]), or b) move to a different screen (e.g. [[Berzerk (video game)|Berzerk]]). It is not to be confused with the [[Diorama (game perspective)|diorama]] perspective, which refers to non-screen based games ([[shooting range#Shooting gallery|shooting galleries]], [[pinball]] and other mechanical games) which were popular before and during the early years of video games. Also not to be confused with hybrid perspective games such as Caveman (Gottlieb), and [[Boot Hill (video game)|Boot Hill]] (Midway), which because of their dual camera nature are harder to classify into one perspective.

==History==
Single Screen video games became popular in the early 1970s with [[Pong]]. They offered a simpler and more affordable alternative to the expensive electro mechanical games of the time (such as Sega's Periscope).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Ultimate History of Video Games: From Pong to Pokémon and Beyond : the Story Behind the Craze that Touched Our Lives and Changed the World|url = https://books.google.co.za/books/about/The_Ultimate_History_of_Video_Games.html?id=C2MH05ogU9oC&amp;redir_esc=y|publisher = Prima Pub.|date = 2001-01-01|isbn = 9780761536437|language = en|first = Steve L.|last = Kent}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Ultimate History of Video Games: from Pong to Pokemon and beyond...the story behind the craze that touched our li ves and changed the world|url = https://books.google.co.za/books?id=PTrcTeAqeaEC&amp;pg=PT469&amp;lpg=PT469&amp;dq=periscope++sega+1295&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=amEv-8_Yfe&amp;sig=g-GkfQ8s4JjjzwuDKvFnFxb8Ojo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher = Crown/Archetype|date = 2010-06-16|isbn = 9780307560872|language = en|first = Steven|last = Kent}}&lt;/ref&gt; The limitations of these early games though was their lack of color and three dimensional effects compared to other games like [[Sonar (arcade game)|Sonar]].
In spite of these limitations single screen games were made covering multiple genres, including racing ([[Gran Trak 10]]), vehicle combat ([[Tank (video game)|Tank]]), shooting galleries ([[Qwak!]]), evasion / collection ([[Shark Jaws]]), and multiplayer shooters ([[Western Gun]]). In contrast to Pinball though (which could offer many more minutes per play) these games were still lacking, due to either their timed play mechanics (through a clock or limited ammunition).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tracer - Videogame by Sega|url = http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=12739|website = www.arcade-museum.com|accessdate = 2015-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest Arcade games to move beyond these limitations was [[Breakout (video game)|Breakout]], and when it was released in 1976 it would go on to inspire [[Space Invaders]], the second game to offer a much longer play time than what was common in this game perspective. The next big evolution in this game perspective was then the introduction of multiple screen types ([[Donkey Kong]]) and randomized elements in combination with destructible environments ([[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]) to add not only duration, but greater variety in the single screen experience.

The book contains poems written mostly in 1972 and 1973; after Auden's death in September 1973 it was prepared for publication by his [[literary executor]] [[Edward Mendelson]], who also included an "antimasque" titled "The Entertainment of the Senses", written in 1973 by Auden and [[Chester Kallman]] as an interpolation in a planned production of [[James Shirley]]'s masque ''Cupid and Death'' (1653); the antimasque was commissioned by the composer [[John Gardner (composer)|John Gardner]].

The shorter poems in the book, in addition to the title poem, include "Aubade", "Unpredictable but Providential", "Address to the Beasts", "Archaeology", "No, Plato, No", "Nocturne", "A Thanksgiving", and "Lullaby" ("The din of work is subdued"; titled in other editions with a title found in Auden's typescripts, "A Lullaby", which distinguishes it from a different earlier poem titled "Lullaby"). The book also includes two of the lyrics that Auden wrote for the musical comedy [[Man of La Mancha]], which were rejected by the original librettist of that play.

[[File:The Falling Man.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|''The Falling Man'']]

'''''The Falling Man''''' is a photograph taken by [[Associated Press]] photographer [[Richard Drew (photographer)|Richard Drew]] of a man falling from the [[One World Trade Center|North Tower]] of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] at 9:41:15&amp;nbsp;a.m. during the [[September 11 attacks]] in [[New York City]]. The subject of the image, whose identity remains uncertain, was one of the people trapped on the upper floors of the skyscraper who either fell searching for safety or jumped to escape the fire and smoke.

The photograph gives the impression that the man is falling straight down; however, a series of photographs taken of his fall showed him to be tumbling through the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/photographer-behind-9-11-falling-man-retraces-steps-recalls-unknown-soldier.html|title=Photographer behind 9/11 "Falling Man" retraces steps, recalls "unknown soldier"|first=Joe|last=Pompeo|date=August 29, 2011|publisher=''[[Yahoo! News]]''|accessdate=August 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The photographer has noted that, in at least two cases, newspaper stories commenting on the image have attracted a barrage of criticism from readers who found the image "disturbing.”&lt;ref&gt;Howe, Peter (2001).

==Background==
Of the nearly 3,000 people killed on 9/11, at least 200 people are believed to have fallen or jumped to their deaths, while other estimates say the number is half of that or fewer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/10/nyregion/10jumpers.html?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first1=Kevin | last1=Flynn | first2=Jim | last2=Dwyer | title=Falling Bodies, a 9/11 Image Etched in Pain | date=September 10, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Whitworth |first=Melissa |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/september-11-attacks/8737671/911-Jumpers-from-the-World-Trade-Center-still-provoke-impassioned-debate.html |title=9/11: 'Jumpers' from the World Trade Center still provoke impassioned debate |publisher=Telegraph |date= September 3, 2011|accessdate=December 13, 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=usatoday&gt;Cauchon, Dennis.

''[[USA Today]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Officials could not recover or identify the bodies of those forced out of the buildings prior to the [[Collapse of the World Trade Center|collapse of the towers]]. All deaths in the attacks except those of [[Hijackers in the September 11 attacks|the hijackers]] were ruled to be homicides due to [[blunt trauma]] (as opposed to suicides).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Leonard|first=Tom|title=The 9/11 victims America wants to forget: The 200 jumpers who flung themselves from the Twin Towers who have been 'airbrushed from history'|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2035720/9-11-jumpers-America-wants-forget-victims-fell-Twin-Towers.html|publisher=Daily Mail|accessdate=September 9, 2013|location=London|date=September 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Office of Chief Medical Examiner of the City of New York|New York City medical examiner's office]] said it does not classify the people who fell to their deaths on September 11 as "[[jumper (suicide)|jumpers]]". According to Ellen Borakove, the examiner's office spokeswoman, "A 'jumper' is somebody who goes to the office in the morning knowing that they will commit suicide. These people were forced out by the smoke and flames or blown out."&lt;ref name=usatoday /&gt;

==Publication history==
The photograph initially appeared in newspapers around the world, including on page 7 of ''[[The New York Times]]'' on September 12, 2001. The photo's caption read, "A person falls headfirst after jumping from the north tower of the World Trade Center. It was a horrific sight that was repeated in the moments after the planes struck the towers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mills|title=Images of Terror|journal=Dissent|year=2009|pages=75–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; It appeared only once in the ''Times'' because of criticism and anger against its use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nymag.com/news/9-11/10th-anniversary/jumpers/ |title=The Encyclopedia of 9/11: Jumpers: Why the most haunting images of 2001 were hardly ever seen. |date=August 27, 2011 |publisher=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |author=Susie Linfield}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six years later, it appeared on page 1 of ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' on May 27, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Boutin |first=Maurice |editor=Arvin Sharma |year=2009 |chapter=The Current State of the Individual: A Meditation on "The Falling Man" |title=The World's Religions after September 11 |pages=3–9 |isbn=0-275-99621-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| source=Gwendolyn, ''9/11: The Falling Man''}}

The identity of the subject of the man has never been officially confirmed. The large number of people trapped in the tower has made identifying the man in the 12 photos difficult. It is thought, though the number is uncertain, that at least 200 people fell to their deaths.&lt;ref name=usatoday/&gt;

Reporter [[Peter Cheney]]  suggested in the nationally distributed Canadian newspaper ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' that the man pictured in the photo may have been Norberto Hernandez, a [[pastry chef]] at [[Windows on the World]], a restaurant located on the 106th floor of the [[List of tenants in One World Trade Center|North Tower]]. Some members of Hernandez's family agreed with Cheney,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/incoming/the-life-and-death-of-norberto-hernandez/article4153194/|title=The life and death of Norberto Hernandez |first=Peter |last=Cheney |date=September 22, 2001 |publisher="[[The Globe and Mail]]"|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but after examining the entire photo sequence and noting details of his clothing, were no longer convinced.&lt;ref name="JunodEsquire"&gt;{{cite web |last=Junod |first=Tom |publisher= Esquire Magazine| year=2003 |url=http://www.esquire.com/features/ESQ0903-SEP_FALLINGMAN |title=The Falling Man }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jonathan Eric Briley===
"The Falling Man", an article about the photograph by American journalist [[Tom Junod]], was published in the September 2003 issue of ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine. It was adapted into a documentary film by the same name. The article gave the possible identity of the falling man as Jonathan Briley, a 43-year-old audio technician for Windows on the World. Briley, a resident of [[Mount Vernon, New York]], was a [[sound engineer]]. His brother [[Alex Briley|Alex]] is an original member of the 1970s [[disco]] group [[Village People]]. Briley had [[asthma]] and would have known he was in danger when smoke began to pour into the restaurant.&lt;ref name="JunodEsquire"/&gt;

[[Michael Lomonaco]], the Executive Chef/Director at Windows on the World, also suggested that the man was Briley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/memorial/people/2023.html|title=Jonathan Briley|work=September 11: A Memorial|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=July 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Briley was initially identified by his brother, Timothy.&lt;ref name="JunodEsquire" /&gt; Lomonaco could identify Briley by his clothes and his body type. In one of the pictures, the Falling Man's shirt or white jacket was blown open and up, revealing an orange t-shirt similar to one shirt that Briley often wore. Briley's older sister, Gwendolyn, originally helped in identifying the victim. She told reporters of ''[[Daily Mirror|The Sunday Mirror]]'', "When I first looked at the picture [...] and I saw it was a man—tall, slim—I said, 'If I didn't know any better, that could be Jonathan.{{' "}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/911-the-image-of-the-falling-man-that-still-152974|title=9/11: The image of The Falling Man that still haunts 10 years on|accessdate=May 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
''9/11: The Falling Man'' is a 2006 [[documentary film]] about the picture and the story behind it. It was made by American filmmaker [[Henry Singer]] and filmed by Richard Numeroff, a New York-based director of photography. The film is loosely based on Junod's ''Esquire'' story. It also drew its material from photographer [[Lyle Owerko]]'s pictures of falling people. It debuted on March 16, 2006, on the [[United Kingdom|British]] television network [[Channel 4]]. It later made its [[North America]]n premiere on [[Canada]]'s [[CBC Newsworld]] on September 6, 2006, and has been broadcast in more than 30 countries. The U.S. premiere was September 10, 2007, on the [[Discovery Times|Discovery Times Channel]].

The novel ''[[Falling Man (novel)|Falling Man]]'', by [[Don DeLillo]], is about the September 11 attacks. The "falling man" in the novel is a performance artist recreating the events of the photograph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Matthew J. Morgan |last=Versluys |first=Kristiaan |chapter=9/11 in the Novel |title=The Impact of 9/11 on the Media, Arts, and Entertainment: The Day that Changed Everything? |volume=4 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |pages=142–143 |isbn=978-0-230-60841-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; DeLillo says he was unfamiliar with the title of the picture when he named his book. The artist straps himself into a harness and jumps from an elevated structure in a high visibility area (such as a highway overpass), hanging in the pose of ''The Falling Man''.

==History==

=== Founding (1991-2005) ===
Raymond and Susan Johnson held the first retail exhibition of Russian Realist Art in North America in 1991. The largest collectors of Soviet-era paintings outside the former USSR, the Johnsons showed their work privately until envisioning a public museum in 2002. It commenced exhibition activities open to the public in 2002, initially in loaned space in a corporate office park located in [[Bloomington, Minnesota]].  The organization initially showcased Russian Realist-style paintings from the late 19th century as well as from the Soviet era (1917–1991). Ray Johnson was appointed an [[Honorary Consul]] for the [[Russian Federation]] in 2003, and in recognition of their respective contributions "to international cultural diversity and education," both Johnson (2005) and TMORA's first Director Bradford Shinkle (2009) were awarded Russia's [[Order of Friendship|Order of Friendship Medal]], the highest civilian honor accorded to non-Russian citizens.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
 
In 2005, TMORA acquired and thoroughly remodeled the former Mayflower Church in south Minneapolis, a 75-year-old building that previously served as a [[Congregational church]] and funeral home. The building received special recognition for [[adaptive reuse]] from the Minnesota Heritage Preservation Commission, and opened to the public in 2007. TMORA now operates a state-of-the-art exhibition facility that includes {{convert|18,000|sqft|m2}} of display galleries and administrative offices.

TMORA has established international relationships with numerous Russian cultural organizations and museums including [[Rossotrudnichestvo]], the [[List of diplomatic missions of Russia|Russian Embassy in the United States]] - Washington D.C., the [[Russian Cultural Center]], the [[State Tretyakov Gallery]] (Moscow), [[State Russian Museum]] (St. Petersburg), [[State Museum of Yaroslaval]] (Yaroslaval). The museum works with both private collectors as well as institutions throughout the United States; the mutual cultural embargo established between Russia and the United States in 2010 currently prevents collections from state institutions in Russia to travel to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.startribune.com/minnesota-russia-create-a-way-to-skirt-russian-arts-embargo/329721831/|title=Minnesota, Russia create a way to skirt Russian arts embargo|work=Star Tribune|access-date=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In addition to its exhibition calendar, TMORA hosts a variety of events throughout the year including concerts, lectures, theater, dance, artist talks, book clubs, and an annual vodka tasting.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

On March 6, 2018, the museum's former Director Vladimir von Tsurikov, Ph.D., received the Silver Archer "[http://www.luchnik.ru/ СЕРЕБРЯНЫЙ ЛУЧНИК]" award at the Russian Cultural Center in Washington, D.C. for his leadership of over 30 programs at TMORA in 2017: "In recognition of his work advancing creative activities contributing to Cultural Diplomacy in the United States during a time of cooling bilateral relations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tmora.org/2018/04/04/silverarcher/|title=Director Honored with “Silver Archer” award in D.C.|date=2018-04-04|work=The Museum of Russian Art|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1306">'''"The Woman Who Had No Shadow"''' is a Scandinavian fairy tale, included by Sven Grundtvig in ''Gamle danske Minder i Folkemunde'' and Ella Ohlson in ''Sagor från Ångermanland''.&lt;ref name="redeem"&gt;D. L. Ashliman, "[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0756.html Forgiveness and Redemption: folktales of Aarne-Thompson types 755 and 756]"&lt;/ref&gt;

It is [[Aarne–Thompson classification systems|Aarne-Thompson]] type 755, Sin and grace.&lt;ref name="redeem"/&gt;

==Synopsis==
A woman, wishing to have no children, threw rocks into a well at a witch's direction.  Thereafter, she had no shadow.  Her husband, the parson, demanded to know why and threw her out, saying that their slate roof would blossom with flowers before she was forgiven.  One day, a beggar woman sought refuge there; she died in the night, the parson recognized her as his wife, and the housekeeper called him out to see how the roof had bloomed with flowers.

==Motifs==
The legend of ''[[Tannhäuser]]'' features the same growth as evidence of miraculous forgiveness.&lt;ref name="redeem"/&gt;

==Adaptations==
''[[Die Frau ohne Schatten]]'' by Hugo von Hofmannsthal and Richard Strauss is loosely based on this tale.&lt;ref name="redeem"/&gt;

The '''''Yellow Crucifixion''''' is a painting by [[Marc Chagall]]. It was painted in 1943 and is on display at [[Musée National d'Art Moderne]] in [[Paris, France]].

== Description of Artwork ==

The piece reworked many themes that first occurred in Chagall's more famous artwork ''[[White Crucifixion]]'' whereby the suffering of Jewish victims of [[the Holocaust]] was communicated through the image of [[Jesus]] [[Christ (title)|Christ]] as a Jew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://diglotting.com/2014/02/28/theology-and-art-chagalls-crucifixion-in-yellow/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150816111522/http://diglotting.com/2014/02/28/theology-and-art-chagalls-crucifixion-in-yellow/ |archivedate=2015-08-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesus is not the central image of this picture, and instead shares the canvas with a large green Torah scroll and [[angel]]. This positioning emphasises the Jewish character of Jesus in this work, supported by Jesus wearing a Jewish prayer shawl ([[tallit]]) and [[tefillin]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Cohen. Christ Killers. Oxford. 2007. p.166&lt;/ref&gt;

The surrounding details are scenes from the programs occurring in Europe. There is a burning [[shtetl]] to the right, surrounded by distressed looking figures. Below this is found a Jew wearing traditional Jewish clothing (and a placard) and a fleeing woman with her child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://diglotting.com/2014/02/28/theology-and-art-chagalls-crucifixion-in-yellow/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150816111522/http://diglotting.com/2014/02/28/theology-and-art-chagalls-crucifixion-in-yellow/ |archivedate=2015-08-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter scene is reminiscent of the story of Jesus’ flight to Egypt as a child.&lt;ref&gt;The Bible. Matt. 2.13-15&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theme that has been reworked into the ''Yellow Crucifixion'', which first appeared in the ''White Crucifixion'', is the presence of a ship. The significant difference is that in this painting, the ship is shown sinking into the waters. This is undoubtably an allusion to the [[Struma disaster|''Struma'' disaster]] in 1942. The fact that Jesus is looking down on the ship, watching the passengers, is said to convey the artist's own passage to [[New York City]] from Europe that took place by ship.&lt;ref&gt;J. Cohen. Christ Killers. Oxford. 2007. p.166&lt;/ref&gt;

Other details include fish leaping out of the sea and a goat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://diglotting.com/2014/02/28/theology-and-art-chagalls-crucifixion-in-yellow/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150816111522/http://diglotting.com/2014/02/28/theology-and-art-chagalls-crucifixion-in-yellow/ |archivedate=2015-08-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence of Piece ==

Reformed theologian Jürgen Moltmann mentions this painting as being his muse while writing ''The Crucified God'', a book which has been called a Christian [[Holocaust theology|theology after Auschwitz]]:

"In front of me hangs Marc Chagall’s picture ''Crucifixion in Yellow''. It shows the figure of the crucified Christ in an apocalyptic situation: people sinking into the sea, people homeless and in flight, and yellow fire blazing in the background. And with the crucified Christ there appears the angel with the trumpet and the open roll of the book of life [Rev 14.6]. This picture has accompanied me for a long time. It symbolizes the cross on the horizon of the world, and can be thought of as a symbolic expression of the studies which follow." &lt;ref&gt;''The Crucified God'', xxii; See also Moltmann’s autobiography, ''A Broad Place'', p.191&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1640">The '''Théâtre-Musée des Capucines''', also known as the '''Théâtre musée des Capucines-Fragonard''', is a private museum dedicated to [[perfume]], and located in the [[2nd arrondissement of Paris]] at 39, boulevard des Capucines, [[Paris]], [[France]]. It closes on Sundays; admission is free.

The museum was created in 1993 by the Fragonard perfume company within a former theater, the [[Théâtre des Capucines]], dating to 1889. It exhibits 19th-century copper distilling apparatus, [[alembic]]s, [[laboratory flask|flask]]s, pots-pourris, and perfume roasters, as well as the animals and plants that provide raw materials for perfumes. A collection of perfume bottles illustrates 3000 years of perfume making.

'''Heinrich Christian Wilhelm Busch''' (15 April 1832&amp;nbsp;– 9 January 1908) was a German humorist, poet, illustrator and painter. He published comic illustrated [[cautionary tale]]s from 1859, achieving his most notable works in the 1870s. Busch's illustrations used [[wood engraving]], and later, [[zincography]].

Busch drew on contemporary [[Parochialism|parochial]] and city life, satirizing Catholicism, [[Philistinism]], strict religious morality and [[bigotry]]. His comic text was colourful and entertaining, using [[onomatopoeia]], [[neologism]]s and other [[figure of speech|figures of speech]], and led to some work being [[Book censorship|banned]] by the authorities.

Busch was influential in both poetry and illustration, and became a source for future generations of [[comics|comic]] artists. ''[[The Katzenjammer Kids]]'' was inspired by Busch's ''[[Max and Moritz]]'', one of a number of imitations produced in Germany and the United States. The [[Wilhelm Busch Prize]] and the [[Wilhelm Busch Museum]] help maintain his legacy. His 175th anniversary in 2007 was celebrated throughout Germany. Busch remains one of the most influential poets and artists in Western Europe.

==Family background==
[[File:Buschhaus in Wiedensahl.JPG|thumb|240px|The house in which Busch was born, Wiedensahl, 2008]]

In the late 18th century Johann Georg Kleine, Wilhelm Busch's maternal grandfather, settled in the small village of [[Wiedensahl]]. There, in 1817, he bought a thatched [[Timber framing|half-timbered house]], where Wilhelm Busch was to be born about 15 years later. Amalie Kleine, Johann's wife and Wilhelm Busch's grandmother, kept a shop in which Busch's mother Henriette assisted while her two brothers attended high [[Gymnasium (school)|school]]. When Johann Georg Kleine died in 1820, his widow continued to run the shop with Henriette.&lt;ref&gt;Kraus, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pape, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schury, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 19 Henriette Kleine married surgeon Friedrich Wilhelm Stümpe.&lt;ref&gt;Schury, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Henriette became widowed at the age of 26, with her three children to Stümpe dying as infants. About 1830 Friedrich Wilhelm Busch, the illegitimate son of a farmer, settled in Wiedensahl after completing a business apprenticeship in the nearby village of [[Loccum]]. He took over the Kleine shop in Wiedensahl, which he completely modernised.&lt;ref&gt;Weissweiler, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

===Childhood===
Wilhelm Busch was born on 15 April 1832, the first of seven children to the marriage of Henriette Kleine and Friedrich Wilhelm Busch. His six siblings followed shortly after: Fanny (1834), Gustav (1836), Adolf (1838), Otto (1841), Anna (1843) and Hermann (1845); all survived childhood. His parents were ambitious, hard-working and devout [[Protestantism|Protestants]] who later, despite becoming relatively prosperous, could not afford to educate all three sons.&lt;ref&gt;Wessling, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; Busch's biographer Berndt W. Wessling suggested that Friedrich Wilhelm Busch invested heavily in his sons' education partly because his own illegitimacy held significant [[Social stigma|stigma]] in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;Wessling, p. 22, 24&lt;/ref&gt;

The young Wilhelm Busch was a tall child, but with a rather delicate and graceful physique. The coarse boyishness of his later protagonists "[[Max and Moritz]]" was rare in his childhood. He described himself in autobiographical sketches and letters as sensitive and timid, as someone who "carefully studied apprehension",&lt;ref name="Weissweiler, p. 20"&gt;Weissweiler, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; and who reacted with fascination, compassion and distress when animals were killed in the autumn.&lt;ref name="Weissweiler, p. 20"/&gt; He described the "transformation to [[sausage]]" as "dreadfully compelling",&lt;ref&gt;Weissweiler, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weissweiler, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; leaving a lasting impression; [[pork]] nauseated him throughout his life.&lt;ref&gt;Weissweiler, pp. 25–27&lt;/ref&gt;

In the autumn of 1841, after the birth of his brother Otto, Busch's education was entrusted to the 35-year-old clergyman Georg Kleine, his maternal uncle at [[Ebergötzen]], this probably through lack of space in the Busch family home, and his father's desire for a better education than the small local school could provide, where 100 children were taught within a space of {{convert|66|sqm|sqft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;Schury, pp. 32–33&lt;/ref&gt; The nearest convenient school was located in [[Bückeburg]], {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Wiedensahl. Kleine, with his wife Fanny Petri, lived in a [[Clergy house|rectory]] at Ebergötzen, while Busch was lodged with an unrelated family. Kleine and his wife were responsible and caring, exercised a substitute parental role, and provided refuge for him in future unsuccessful times.&lt;ref&gt;Weissweiler, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diers, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:MaxMoritz.jpg|thumb|240px|A scene from ''Max and Moritz'']]

Kleine's private lessons for Busch were also attended by Erich Bachmann, the son of a wealthy Ebergötzen [[miller]]. Both became friends, according to Busch the strongest friendship of his childhood. This friendship was echoed in the 1865 story ''Max and Moritz''. A small pencil portrait by the 14-year-old Busch depicted Bachmann as a chubby, confident boy, and showed similarities with Max. Busch portrayed himself with a "cowlick", in the later "Moritzian" [[Pompadour (hairstyle)|perky style]].&lt;ref&gt;Weissweiler, pp. 33–34&lt;/ref&gt;

Kleine was a [[Philology|philologist]], his lessons not held in contemporary language, and it is not known for certain all subjects Busch and his friend were taught. Busch did learn [[elementary arithmetic]] from his uncle, although science lessons might have been more comprehensive, as Kleine, like many other clergymen, was a [[beekeeper]], and published essays and textbooks on the subject&lt;ref&gt;Weisweiler, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diers, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;— Busch demonstrated his knowledge of bee-keeping in his future stories. Drawing, and German and English poetry, were also taught by Kleine.&lt;ref&gt;Schury, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

Busch had little contact with his natural parents during this period. At the time, the {{convert|165|km|mi|abbr=on}} journey between Wiedensahl and Ebergötzen took three days by horse.&lt;ref&gt;Schury, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; His father visited Ebergötzen two to three times a year, while his mother stayed in Wiedensahl to look after the children. The 12-year-old Busch visited his family once; his mother at first did not recognize him.&lt;ref&gt;Kraus, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Some Busch biographers think that this early separation from his parents, especially from his mother, resulted in his eccentric bachelorhood.&lt;ref&gt;Wessling, p.&amp;nbsp;30–32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ueding, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; In the autumn of 1846, Busch moved with the Kleine's to [[Lüthorst]], where, on 11 April 1847, he was [[Confirmation|confirmed]].&lt;ref&gt;Kraus, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

===Study===
In September 1847 Busch began studying [[mechanical engineering]] at [[University of Hanover|Hanover Polytechnic]]. Busch's biographers are not in agreement as to why his Hanover education ended; most believe that his father had little appreciation of his son's artistic inclination.&lt;ref&gt;Kraus, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Biographer Eva Weissweiler suspects that Kleine played a major role, and that other possible causes were Busch's friendship with an innkeeper, Brümmer, political debates in Brümmer's tavern, and Busch's reluctance to believe every word of the [[Bible]] and [[catechism]].&lt;ref&gt;Weissweiler, p.&amp;nbsp;43–44&lt;/ref&gt;

Busch studied for nearly four years at Hanover, despite initial difficulties in understanding the subject matter. A few months before graduation he confronted his parents with his aspiration to study at the [[Kunstakademie Düsseldorf|Düsseldorf Art Academy]]. According to Bush's nephew Hermann Nöldeke, his mother supported this inclination.&lt;ref&gt;Diers, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; His father eventually acquiesced and Busch moved to [[Düsseldorf]] in June 1851,&lt;ref name="Weissweiler, p. 51"&gt;Weissweiler, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; where, to his disappointment at not being admitted to the advanced class, he entered preparatory classes.&lt;ref&gt;Weissweiler, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Busch's parents had his tuition fees paid for one year, so in May 1852 he traveled to [[Antwerp]] to continue study at the [[Royal Academy of Fine Arts (Antwerp)|Royal Academy of Fine Arts]] under [[Josephus Laurentius Dyckmans]]. He led his parents to believe that the Academy was less regimented than Düsseldorf, and had the opportunity to study [[Old Master|old masters]].&lt;ref&gt;Weissweiler, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; At Antwerp he saw for the first time paintings by [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Adriaen Brouwer]], [[David Teniers the Younger|David Teniers]] and [[Frans Hals]].&lt;ref name="Schury, p. 49"&gt;Schury, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; The pictures aroused his interest, but made him doubt his own skills.&lt;ref name="K30"/&gt; Eventually, in 1853, after suffering heavily from [[Typhoid fever|typhus]], he abandoned his Antwerp studies and returned penniless to Wiedensahl.&lt;ref&gt;Busch, Bohne, Meskemper, Haberland, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Munich===
Busch was ravaged by disease, and for five months spent time painting and collecting [[Fairy tale|folk tales]], legends, songs, ballads, rhymes and fragments of regional superstitions.&lt;ref name="Weissweiler, p. 75"&gt;Weissweiler, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; Busch's biographer Joseph Kraus saw these collections as useful additions to [[folklore]], as Busch noted the narrative background to tales and the idiosyncrasies of storytellers.&lt;ref&gt;Kraus, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Busch tried to release the collections, but as a publisher could not be found at the time they were issued after his death. During the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi era]] Busch was known as an "ethnic seer".&lt;ref name="Weissweiler, p. 75"/&gt;

[[File:Wilhelm Busch.jpg|thumb|right|Wilhelm Busch, 1860]]

After Busch had spent six months with his uncle Kleine at [[Lüthorst]], he expressed an aim to continue study in [[Munich]]. This request caused a rift with his father who, however, eventually funded this move;&lt;ref&gt;Weissweiler, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; - see for comparison Busch's illustrated story of ''Painter Klecksel''. Busch's expectations of the Munich [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich|Academy of Fine Arts]] were not met. His life became aimless; there were occasional return visits to Lüthorst, but contact with his parents had been broken off.&lt;ref&gt;Weissweiler, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; In 1857 and 1858, as his position seemed to be without prospects, he contemplated emigration to [[Brazil]] to keep bees.&lt;ref&gt;Diers, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

Busch made contact with the artist association Jung München (Young Munich), met several notable Munich artists, and wrote and provided cartoons for the Jung München newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;Schury, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kaspar Braun]], who published the satirical newspapers ''Münchener Bilderbogen'' (Picture Sheets from Munich) and ''[[Fliegende Blätter]]'' (Flying Leaves), proposed a collaboration with Busch.&lt;ref&gt;Diers, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; This association provided Busch with sufficient funds to live. An existing self-caricature suggests that at this time he had an intense relationship with a woman from [[Ammerland]].&lt;ref&gt;Weissweiler, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; His courtship with a seventeen-year-old merchant's daughter, Anna Richter, whom Busch met through his brother Gustav, ended in 1862. Busch's biographer, Diers, suggests that her father probably refused to entrust his daughter to an almost unknown artist without regular income.&lt;ref&gt;Diers, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

In his early Munich years Busch's attempts to write [[libretto|libretti]], which are almost forgotten today, were unsuccessful. Up to 1863 he worked on two or three major works; the third was [[Composer|composed]] by [[Georg Kremplsetzer]]. Busch's ''Liebestreu und Grausamkeit'', a romantic opera in three acts, ''[[Hansel and Gretel|Hansel und Gretel]]'' and ''Der Vetter auf Besuch'', an [[opera buffa]] of sorts, were not particularly successful. There was a dispute between Busch and Kremplsetzer during the staging of ''Der Vetter auf Besuch'', leading to the removal of Busch's name from the production; the piece was renamed ''Singspiel von Georg Kremplsetzer''.&lt;ref&gt;Weissweiler, pp.102–9&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1873 Busch returned several times to Munich, and took part in the intense life of the Munich Art Society as an escape from provincial life.&lt;ref name="di120"&gt;Diers, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; In 1877, in a last attempt to be a serious artist, he took a studio in Munich.&lt;ref name="di120" /&gt; He left Munich abruptly in 1881, after he disrupted a variety show and subsequently made a scene through the effects of alcohol&lt;ref&gt;Kraus, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; The 1878 nine episode illustrated tale ''Eight Sheets in the Wind'' describes how humans behave like animals when drunk. Busch's biographer Weissweiler felt the story was only superficially funny and harmless, but was a study on addiction and its induced state of delusion.&lt;ref&gt;Weissweiler, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publication of ''Max and Moritz''===
[[File:Wilhelm Busch, ca. 1882.jpg|thumb|upright|Wilhelm Busch, ca. 1882]]
Between 1860 and 1863 Busch wrote over one hundred articles for the ''Münchener Bilderbogen'' and ''Fliegende Blätter'', but he felt his dependence on publisher Kaspar Braun had become constricting. Busch appointed [[Dresden]] publisher Heinrich Richter, the son of Saxon painter [[Adrian Ludwig Richter|Ludwig Richter]], as his new publisher&amp;nbsp;— Richter's press up to that time was producing children's books and religious [[Christian devotional literature]].&lt;ref&gt;Weissweiler, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; Busch could choose themes, although Richter raised some concerns regarding four suggested illustrated tales that were proposed. However, some were published in the 1864 as ''Bilderpossen'', proving a failure. Busch then offered Richter the manuscripts of ''Max and Moritz'', waiving any fees. Richter rejected the manuscript as sales prospects seemed poor. Busch's former publisher, Braun, purchased the right to ''Max and Moritz'' for 1,000 [[Bavarian gulden|gulden]], corresponding to approximately double the annual wage of a [[Artisan|craftsman]].&lt;ref name="Diers 45 46"&gt;Diers, pp. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt;

For Braun the manuscript was fortuitous.&lt;ref name="Diers 45 46"/&gt; Initially the sales of ''Max and Moritz'' were slow, but sales figures improved after the 1868 second edition. Overall there were 56 editions and more than 430,000 copies sold up to Busch's death in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;Diers, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Despite at first being ignored by critics, teachers in the 1870s described ''Max and Moritz'' as frivolous and an undesirable influence on the moral development of young people.&lt;ref&gt;Weissweiler, pp. 132–133&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frankfurt===
Increasing economic success allowed Busch to visit Wiedensahl more frequently. Busch had decided to leave Munich, as only few relatives lived there, and the artists' association was temporarily disbanded.&lt;ref name="Weissweiler, p. 138"&gt;Weissweiler, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1867 Busch met his brother Otto for the first time, in [[Frankfurt]]. Otto was working as a tutor to the family of a wealthy banker and industrialist, Kessler. Busch became friends with Kessler's wife, Johanna, a mother of seven and an influential art and music [[Patronage|patron]] of Frankfurt. She regularly opened [[Salon (gathering)|salons]] at her villa, frequented by artists, musicians and philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;Weissweiler, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; She believed Busch to be a great painter, a view supported by [[Anton Burger (artist)|Anton Burger]], a leading painter of the Kronberger Malerkolonie, the [[Kronberg im Taunus|Kronberg]]-based group of painters.&lt;ref&gt;Weissweiler, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; While his humorous drawings did not appeal to her, she supported his painting career. At first she established an apartment and [[atelier|studio]] for Busch in her villa, later providing him with an apartment nearby.&lt;ref&gt;Kraus, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Motivated by Kessler's support and admiration, and introduction to the cultural life of Frankfurt, the 'Frankfurter Years' were the most artistically productive for Busch. At this time he and Otto discovered the philosophical works of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]].&lt;ref&gt;Diers, pp. 75–76&lt;/ref&gt;

Busch did not remain in Frankfurt. Towards the end of the 1860s he alternated between Wiedensahl and Lüthorst, and [[Wolfenbüttel]] where his brother Gustav lived.&lt;ref&gt;Weissweiler, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; The association with Johanna Kessler lasted five years, and after his return to Wiedensahl in 1872 they communicated by letter. This contact was interrupted between 1877 and 1891, after which it was revived with the help of Kessler's daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Wessing, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later life===
[[File:Busch Grab.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Busch's grave in Mechtshausen]]

Biographer Weissweiler does not dismiss the possibility that Busch's increasing [[alcohol dependence]] hindered self-criticism.&lt;ref name="weiss232"&gt;Weissweiler, pp. 232–234&lt;/ref&gt; He refused invitations to parties, and publisher Otto Basserman sent him to Wiedensahl to keep his alcohol problem undetected from those around him. Busch was also a heavy smoker, resulting in symptoms of severe [[nicotine poisoning]] in 1874. He began to illustrate drunkards more often.&lt;ref name="weiss232" /&gt;

Dutch writer [[Marie Anderson]] corresponded with Busch. More than fifty letters were exchanged between January and October 1875 in which they discussed philosophy, religion and ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Kraus, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Although only one Anderson letter survives, Busch's letters are in [[manuscript]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Weissweiler, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; They met in [[Mainz]] in October 1875, after which he returned to Basserman at Heidelback in a "horrible mood". According to several people at the time, Busch's failure to find a wife was responsible for his conspicuous behaviour. There is no evidence that Busch had a close relationship with any woman after that with Anderson.&lt;ref&gt;Weissweiler, pp. 252–253&lt;/ref&gt;

Busch lived with his sister Fanny's family after her husband Pastor Hermann Nöldeke's death in 1879. His nephew Adolf Nöldeke remembers that Busch wanted to move back to Wiedensahl with the family.&lt;ref&gt;Diers, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; Busch renovated the house, which Fanny looked after even though he was a rich man,&lt;ref name="weiss270" /&gt; and became "father" to his three young nephews. She would, however, have preferred to live in a more urban area for the education of her sons. For Fanny and her three sons, Busch could not replace their former idyllic life. The years around 1880 were psychically and emotionally exhausting for Busch, who was still reliant on alcohol. He would not invite visitors to Wiedensahl; because of this Fanny lost contact with her friends in the village,&lt;ref name="weiss270"&gt;Weissweiler, pp. 270–271&lt;/ref&gt; and whenever she questioned his wishes, Busch became furious;&lt;ref&gt;Wesslng, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; Even his friends Otto Friedrich Bassermann, [[Franz von Lenbach]], [[Hermann Levi]] and [[Wilhelm von Kaulbach]] were not invited; he would meet them in [[Kassel]] or [[Hanover]].

Busch stopped painting in 1896 and signed over all publication rights to [[Bassermann Verlag]] for 50,000 [[German gold mark|gold marks]].&lt;ref&gt;Weissweiler, p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt; Busch, now aged 64, felt old. He needed spectacles for writing and painting, and his hands trembled slightly. In 1898, together with his aging sister Fanny Nöldeke, he accepted Bassermann's suggestion to move into a large parsonage in Mechtshausen.&lt;ref&gt;Weissweiler, p. 334&lt;/ref&gt; Busch read biographies, novels and stories in German, English and French. He organized his works and wrote letters and poems. Most of the poems from the collections ''Schein und Sein'' and ''Zu guter Letzt'' were written in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;Kraus, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; The following years were eventless for Busch. He developed a sore throat in early January 1908, and his doctor detected a weak heart. During the night of 8–9 January 1908 Busch slept uneasily, taking [[camphor]], and a few drops of [[morphine]] as a tranquilizer. Busch died the following morning before his physician, called by Otto Nöldeke, came to assist.&lt;ref&gt;Weissweiler, p. 344&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
[[File:Versuchung und Ende 01.jpg|thumb|right|A scene from ''Helen Who Couldn't Help It'']]
During the Frankfort period Busch published three self-contained illustrated satires. Their [[Anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] themes proved popular during the [[Kulturkampf]].&lt;ref&gt;Kraus, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; Busch's satires typically did not address political questions, but exaggerated churchiness, superstition and philistine double-standards. This exaggeration made at least two of the works historically erroneous.&lt;ref&gt;Diers, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; The third illustrated satire, ''Father Filucius'' (Pater Filucius), described by Busch as an "allegorical [[mayfly]]", has greater historical context.&lt;ref&gt;Kraus, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Max and Moritz''===
In German ''Eine Bubengeschichte in sieben Streichen'', ''Max and Moritz'' is a series of seven illustrated stories concerning the mischievous antics of two boys, who are eventually ground down and fed to ducks.

===''Saint Antonius of Padua'' and ''Helen Who Couldn't Help It''===
[[File:Busch Werke v2 p 142.jpg|thumb|right|Two scenes from ''Monsieur Jacques à Paris während der Belagerung von 1870'']]
In ''Saint Antonius of Padua'' (Der Heilige Antonius von Padua) Busch challenges Catholic belief. It was released by the publisher Moritz Schauenburg at the time [[Pope Pius IX]] proclaimed the [[dogma]] of [[papal infallibility]] that was harshly criticized by Protestants.&lt;ref&gt;Wessing, pp. 92–93&lt;/ref&gt; The publisher's works were heavily scrutinized or censored,&lt;ref&gt;Weissweiler, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[state's attorney]] in [[Offenburg]] charged Schauenberg with "vilification of religion and offending public decency through indecent writings"&amp;nbsp;— a decision which affected Busch.&lt;ref&gt;Weissweiler, pp. 166–167&lt;/ref&gt; Scenes of Antonius accompanied by a pig being admitted to heaven, and the devil being shown as a half-naked ballet dancer seducing Antonius, were deemed controversial. The district court of Düsseldorf subsequently banned ''Saint Antonius''. Schauenburg was acquitted on 27 March 1871 in Offenburg, but in Austria the satire's distribution was prohibited until 1902.&lt;ref&gt;Weissweiler, pp. 169–172&lt;/ref&gt; Schauenburg refused to publish further Busch satires to avoid future accusations.&lt;ref&gt;Wessling, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

Busch's following work, ''Helen Who Couldn't Help It'' (Die fromme Helene), was published by Otto Friedrich Bassermann, a friend whom Busch met in Munich. ''Helen Who Couldn't Help It'', which was soon translated into other European languages, satirizes religious hypocrisy and dubious morality:&lt;ref&gt;Wessling, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

Many details from ''Helen Who Couldn't Help It'' criticizes the way of life of the Kesslers. Johanna Kessler was married to a much older man and entrusted her children to governesses and tutors, while she played an active role in the social life of Frankfurt.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second part of ''Helen Who Couldn't Help It'' Busch attacks [[pilgrimage|Catholic pilgrimages]]. The childless Helen goes on a pilgrimage, accompanied by her cousin and Catholic priest Franz. The pilgrimage is successful as later Helen gives birth to twins, who resemble Helen and Franz. Franz is later killed by a jealous valet, Jean, for his interest in female kitchen staff. The now widowed Helen is left with only a rosary, prayer book and alcohol. Drunk, she falls into a burning oil lamp. Finally, Nolte coins a moral phrase, echoing the philosophy of Schopenhauer:&lt;ref&gt;Kraus, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pater Filucius'' (Father Filucius) is the only illustrated satire of this period suggested by the publisher. Also aimed at anti-Catholic taste and buyers, it criticizes the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit Order]]. Kraus felt it was the weakest of all three anti-clerical works.&lt;ref&gt;Kraus, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; Some satires refer to contemporary events, such as ''Monsieur Jacques à Paris during the Siege of 1870'' (Monsieur Jacques à Paris während der Belagerung von 1870). Busch biographer Manuela Diers declares the story "tasteless work, drawing on anti-French emotions and mocking the misery of French people in Paris, which is occupied by Prussian troops".&lt;ref&gt;Diers, pp. 90–91&lt;/ref&gt; It depicts an increasingly desperate French citizen who at first eats a mouse during the [[Franco-Prussian War|German siege]], then amputates his dog's tail to cook it, and finally invents an explosion pill which kills his dog and two fellow citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Weissweiler, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; Weissweiler believes that Busch wrote with irony.&lt;ref name="Weissweiler, p. 138"/&gt; In ''Eginhard and Emma'' (1864), a fictional family story that takes place in the [[Charlemagne]] era, he criticizes the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and calls for a German empire in its place; in ''The Birthday or the Particularists'' (Der Geburtstag oder die Partikularisten) he satirizes the anti-[[Prussia]]n sentiments of his Hanover countrymen.&lt;ref&gt;Weissweiler, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Critique of the Heart''===
[[File:Eingeschlafener-Trinker-(Wilhelm-Busch).jpg|thumb|upright|''Eingeschlafener Trinker'' by Wilhelm Busch 1869, [[Städel]]art museum]]

Busch did not write further illustrated tales for a while, and focused on the literary ''Kritik des Herzens'' (Critique of the Heart), wanting to appear more serious to his readers. Contemporary reception for the collection of 81 poems was mainly poor; it was criticized for its focus on marriage and sexuality. His long-time friend [[Paul Lindau]] called it "very serious, heartfelt, charming poems".&lt;ref&gt;Weissweiler, p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch writer Marie Anderson was one of few people who enjoyed his ''Kritik des Herzens'', and even planned to publish it in a Dutch newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;Kraus, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Adventures of a Bachelor''===
Notwithstanding the hiatus after moving from Frankfurt, the 1870s were one of Busch's most productive decades. In 1874 he produced the short illustrated tale ''Diddle-Boom!'' (Dideldum!).

Following, in 1875, was the ''Knopp Trilogy'', about the life of Tobias Knopp: ''Adventures of a Bachelor'' (Abenteuer eines Junggesellen), ''Mr. and Mrs. Knopp'' (Herr und Frau Knopp) (1876), and "Julie" (Julchen) (1877). The antagonists of the trilogy are not pairs of nuisances as with ''Max and Moritz'' or ''Jack Crook, Bird of Evil'' (Hans Huckebein, der Unglücksrabe).&lt;ref&gt;Kraus, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; Without pathos, Busch makes Knopp become aware of his mortality:&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, pp.66–7&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first part of the trilogy, Knopp is depressed and will look for a wife. He visits his old friends and their wives who he finds in unenviable relationships. Still not convinced that the life of a bachelor is one for him, he returns home, and without further ado proposes to his housekeeper. The following marriage proposal is, according to Busch biographer Joseph Kraus, one of the shortest in the history of German literature:&lt;ref&gt;Kraus, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Wessling, Busch became skeptical of marriage after writing the story.&lt;ref&gt;Wessling, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; To Marie Anderson he wrote: "I will never marry(...) I am already in good hands with my sister".&lt;ref&gt;zitiert nach Wessling, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

===Last works===
Among Busch's last works were the stories ''Clement Dove, the Poet Thwarted'' (Balduin Bählamm, der verhinderte Dichter) (1883) and ''Painter Squirtle'' (Maler Klecksel) (1884), both of which focus on artistic failure, and indirectly his own failure.&lt;ref&gt;Diers, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; Both stories begin with a preface, which, for biographer Joseph Kraus, were bravura pieces of "Komische Lyrik"&amp;nbsp;— German comic poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Kraus, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; ''Clement Dove'' ridicules the bourgeois amateur poet circle of Munich, "The Crocodiles" ([[Die Krokodile]]), and their prominent members [[Emanuel Geibel]], [[Paul Heyse|Paul von Heyse]] and [[Adolf Wilbrandt]]. ''Painter Squirtle'' criticizes the bourgeois art connoisseur, who believes the worth of art is gauged by its price.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

What broad authoritative sweep!
The thrill transmitted as one traces
That lattice-work of patterned spaces!
Those economical designs
Of trailing asymptotic lines!

The prose play ''Edwards Dream'' (Eduards Traum) was released in 1891, composed of several small grouped episodes, rather than one linear storyline. The work received mixed reception. Joseph Kraus felt it was the peak of Busch's life's work,&lt;ref&gt;Kraus, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; his nephews called it a masterwork of world literature, and the publisher of a critical collective edition spoke of a narrative style that is not found in contemporary literature.&lt;ref&gt;Weissweiler, pp. 316–317&lt;/ref&gt; Eva Weissweiler saw in the play Busch's attempt to prove himself in the novella genre, believing that everything that angered or insulted him, and his accompanying emotional depths, are apparent in the story.&lt;ref&gt;Weissweiler, pp. 320–322.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1895 story ''The Butterfly'' (Der Schmetterling) parodies themes and motifs and ridicules the religious optimism of a German romanticism which contradicted Busch's realistic [[anthropology]] influenced by Schopenhauer and [[Charles Darwin]].&lt;ref&gt;Clemens Heydenreich: ''"...&amp;nbsp;und damit gut!" Wilhelm Buschs Märchen "Der Schmetterling" als Trümmerfeld der "Taugenichts"-Romantik''. (In German) In: Aurora. Jahrbuch der Eichendorff-Gesellschaft, 68/69 (2010), pp. 67–78&lt;/ref&gt; Its prose is more stringent in narrative style compared to ''Edwards Dream''. Both were not popular amongst readers, because of their unfamiliar style.&lt;ref&gt;Weissweiler, pp. 330–331&lt;/ref&gt;

===Painting===
[[File:Wilhelm Busch Waldlandschaft.jpg|thumb|right|240px|''Waldlandschaft mit Heufuder und Kühen'', 1884–1893]]
Busch felt his painting skills could not compete with those of the [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch masters]].&lt;ref name="K30"&gt;Kraus, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; He regarded few of his paintings as finished, often stacking them one on top of the other in damp corners of his studio, where they stuck together. If the pile of paintings became too high, he burnt some in his garden.&lt;ref name="we163"&gt;Weissweiler, pp. 163–164&lt;/ref&gt; Since only a few remaining pictures are dated, categorizing them is difficult.&lt;ref name="K30" /&gt; His doubts regarding his skills are expressed in his choice of materials. His [[primer (paint)|ground]] was usually chosen carelessly. Sometimes he used uneven cardboard or poorly-prepared [[spruce]]-wood boards.&lt;ref name="we163" /&gt; One exception is a portrait of Johanna Kessler, on a [[canvas]] support measuring {{convert|63|cm|in|0}} by {{convert|53|cm|in|0}}, one of his largest paintings.&lt;ref name="we163" /&gt; Most of his works, even [[Landscape painting|landscapes]], are small.&lt;ref name="we163" /&gt; As Busch used poor grounds and colours, most are heavily darkened and have an almost monochrome effect.

Many pictures depict the countryside at Wiedensahl and Lüthorst. They include [[Pollarding|pollarded]] [[willow]]s, cottages in cornfields, cowherds, autumn landscapes and meadows with streams.&lt;ref&gt;Weissweiler, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; A particular feature is the use of red jackets, found in about 280 of 1000 Busch paintings and drawings. The muted or bright red coats are worn usually by a small figure, depicted from behind.&lt;ref&gt;Schury, pp. 52–53&lt;/ref&gt; The paintings generally represent typical villages. Portraits of the Kesslers, and a series of other portraits depicting Lina Weissenborn in the mid-1870s, are exceptions. A painting of a 10-year-old girl from a Jewish family at Lüthorst portrays her as serious, and having dark, oriental features.&lt;ref&gt;Weissweiler, S. 215 und S. 216&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of Dutch painters is clearly visible in Busch's work. "[[Frans Hals|Hals]] diluted and shortened(...) but still Halsian", wrote [[Paul Klee]] after visiting a Busch memorial exhibition in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;Ueding, p. 369&lt;/ref&gt; A strong influence on Busch was [[Adriaen Brouwer]], whose themes were farming and inn life, rustic dances, card players, smokers, drunkards and rowdies. He dismissed the techniques of [[Impressionism]] with its strong preoccupation with the effect of light, and used new colours, such as [[Aniline Yellow]], and photographs, as an aid. The landscapes from the mid-1880s show the same broad brushstrokes as seen in the paintings of the young [[Franz von Lenbach]].&lt;ref&gt;Weissweiler, p. 310&lt;/ref&gt; Busch refused to exhibit work even though he was befriended by many artists of the [[Munich School]], which would have allowed him to do so;&lt;ref&gt;Weissweiler, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; it was not until near the end of his life that he presented his paintings to the public.&lt;ref name="Schury, p. 49"/&gt;

==Themes, technique and style==
[[File:Jaja, das kommt von das.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Final illustration from ''Diogenes und die bösen Buben von Korinth'']]
Busch biographer Joseph Kraus divided his work into three periods. He points out, however, that this classification is a simplification, as some works by their nature can be of a later or earlier period.&lt;ref&gt;Kraus, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; All three periods show Busch's obsession with German middle class life.&lt;ref&gt;Ueding, pp. 296–297&lt;/ref&gt; His peasants are devoid of sensitivity and village life is marked by a vivid lack of sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;Ueding, pp. 301–302&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1858 to 1865 Busch chiefly worked for the ''Fliegenden Blätter'' and the ''Münchener Bilderbogen''.
The period from 1866 to 1884 is characterized by his major illustrated stories, such as ''Helen Who Couldn't Help It''. These stories are different in theme from works of his earlier period. The life of his characters start well, but disintegrate, as in ''Painter Squirtle'' (Maler Klecksel); someone sensitive who becomes a [[pedant]]. Others concern recalcitrant children or animals, or make the great or significant foolish and ridiculous.&lt;ref&gt;Ueding, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; The early stories follow the pattern of children's books of orthodox education, such as those by [[Heinrich Hoffmann (author)|Heinrich Hoffmann]]'s ''[[Struwwelpeter]]'', that aim to teach the devastating consequences of bad behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Ueding, pp. 71–72&lt;/ref&gt; Busch did not assign value to his work, as he once explained to Heinrich Richter: "I look at my things for what they are, as Nuremberg trinkets [toys], as Schnurr Pfeiferen [worthless and useless things] whose value is to be found not in its artistic content, but in public demand (...)".&lt;ref&gt;Weissweiler, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1885 until his death in 1908 his work was dominated by prose and poems. The 1895 prose text ''Der Schmetterling'' contains autobiographical accounts.&lt;ref&gt;Pietzcker, Frank: ''Symbol und Wirklichkeit im Werk Wilhelm Buschs – Die versteckten Aussagen seiner Bildergeschichten.'', Europäische Hochschulschriften, Frankfurt am Main 2002, {{ISBN|3-631-39313-X}}, pp. 71, 104&lt;/ref&gt; Peter's enchantment by the witch Lucinde, of whom he regards himself a slave, is possibly in reference to Johanna Kessler. Peter, like Busch, returns to his birthplace. It is similar in style to the romantic travel story that [[Ludwig Tieck]] established with his 1798 ''Franz Sternbalds Wanderungen''. Busch plays with its traditional forms, motifs, pictures, [[Literary topos|literary topics]] and form of narration.&lt;ref&gt;Ueding, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt;

Publisher [[Kaspar Braun]], who commissioned Busch's first illustrations, had established the first workshop in Germany to use [[wood engraving]]. This [[letterpress printing]] technique was developed by English graphic artist [[Thomas Bewick]] near the end of the 18th century and became the most widely used reproduction system for illustrations over the years. Busch insisted on first making the drawings, afterwards writing the verse. Surviving preparatory drawings show line notes, ideas, and movement and [[physiognomy]] studies.&lt;ref&gt;Schury, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;
The draft was then transferred by pencil on white-primed panels of [[hardwood]] [[Wood grain|end grain]]. Not only was it hard work, but the quality of the printing block was crucial.&lt;ref&gt;Schury, pp. 89–90&lt;/ref&gt; Everything left white on the block, around Busch's drawn lines, was cut from the plate by skilled [[Engraving|engravers]]. Wood engraving allows a finer differentiation than [[woodcut]] and the potential tonal values are of almost the quality of [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] printing, such as copper [[engraving]]. Sometimes the result was not satisfactory, leading Busch to rework or reproduce plates.&lt;ref&gt;Schury, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; The wood engraving technique did not allow for fine lines, which is why Busch's drawing, especially in his illustrated tales up to the mid-1870s, are boldly drawn, giving his work its particular characteristic.&lt;ref&gt;Diers, pp. 41–42&lt;/ref&gt;

From the mid-1870s Busch's illustrations were printed using [[zincography]]. With this technique there was no longer any danger that a wood engraver could change the character of his drawings. The originals were photographed and transferred onto a photosensitive zinc plate. This process allowed for the application of a clear, free pen-drawn ink line, and was a much faster printing method. Busch's use of zincography began with ''Mr. and Mrs. Knopp''.&lt;ref&gt;Weissweiler, p. 254&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===
The effect of Busch's illustrations are enhanced by his forthright verse, with taunts, derision, ironic twists, exaggeration, ambiguity and startling rhymes.&lt;ref&gt;Kraus, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; His language had an influence on the humorous poetry of [[Erich Kästner]], [[Kurt Tucholsky]], [[Joachim Ringelnatz]] and [[Christian Morgenstern]].&lt;ref&gt;Wessling, pp. 120–121&lt;/ref&gt; The contrast in his later work between comic illustration and its seemingly serious accompanying text&amp;nbsp;— already demonstrated in his earlier ''Max and Moritz''&amp;nbsp;— is shown in Widow Bolte's mawkish dignity which is disproportionate to the loss of her chickens:&lt;ref&gt;Kraus, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Max und Moritz (Busch) 014.png|thumb|right|240px|A scene from ''Max and Moritz'']]
Many of Brusch's [[couplet]]s, part of contemporary common usage, give the impression of weighty wisdom, but in his hands become only apparent truths, hypocrisy or [[Bromide (language)|platitudes]]. His use of [[onomatopoeia]] is a characteristic of his work: "Allez-oop-da"&amp;nbsp;— Max and Moritz steal fried chickens with a fishing rod down a chimney&amp;nbsp;— "reeker-rawker"; "at the plank from bank to bank"; "rickle-rackle", "hear the millstones grind and crackle"; and "tinkly-clinket" as Eric the cat rips a chandelier from a ceiling in ''Helen Who Couldn't Help It''. Busch uses names he gives characters to describe their personality. "Studiosus Döppe" (Young Bumbel) has little mental ability; "Sauerbrots" ([[Sourdough]]) would not be of a cheerful disposition; and "Förster Knarrtje" (Forester Knarrtje) could hardly be a socialite.&lt;ref&gt;Diers, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of his picture stories use verses with [[trochee]] structure:&lt;ref&gt;Pietzcker, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
'''Mas'''ter '''Lam'''pel's '''gen'''tle '''pow'''ers
'''Failed''' with '''ras'''cals '''such''' as '''ours'''
&lt;/poem&gt;
The overweighting of the stressed [[syllable]]s strengthens the humour of the lines. Busch also uses [[Dactyl (poetry)|dactyls]], where one accented syllable is followed by two unaccented syllables, as in his ''Plisch und Plum'', where they underline the pedantic and solemn words with which teacher Bokelmann educates his pupils. They create tension in the Sourdough chapter from ''Adventures of a Bachelor'', through the alternation of trochees and dactyls.&lt;ref&gt;Pietzcker, pp. 28–30&lt;/ref&gt; Busch often synchronizes format and content in his poems, as in ''Fips the Monkey'', where he uses the epic [[hexameter]] in a speech about wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;Pietzcker, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

In both his illustrations and poems Busch uses familiar fables, occasionally appropriating their morality and stories, spinning them to illustrate a very different and comic "truth",&lt;ref&gt;Ueding, pp. 103, 105&lt;/ref&gt; and bringing to bear his pessimistic view of the world and human condition. While traditional fables follow the typical philosophy of differentiating between good and evil behaviour, Busch combines both.&lt;ref&gt;Ueding, pp. 106–107&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canings and other cruelties===
[[File:Busch Werke v3 p 326.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Two scenes from ''Fips the Monkey'']]
It is not unusual to see thrashing, tormenting and [[caning]] in Busch's works. Sharp pencils pierced through models, housewives fall onto kitchen knives, thieves are spiked by umbrellas, tailors cut their tormentors with scissors, rascals are ground in [[Gristmill|corn mills]], drunkards burn, and cats, dogs and monkeys defecate while being tormented. Busch has been frequently called a [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadist]] by educators and psychologists.&lt;ref&gt;Weissweiler, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; Tails that are burnt, pulled off, trapped, stretched or eaten is seen by Weissweiler as not aggression against animals, but a [[Phallus|phallic]] allusion to Busch's undeveloped sexual life.&lt;ref name="Weissweiler, p. 194"/&gt;  Such graphic text and imagery in cartoon form was not unusual at the time, and publishers, the public or censors found it not particularly noteworthy.&lt;ref name="Weissweiler, p. 51"/&gt; Topics and motifs for his early work were derived from 18th- and 19th-century popular literature, the gruesome endings of which he often softened.&lt;ref&gt;Pietzcker, pp. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt;

Caning, a common aspect of 19th-century teaching, is prevalent in many of his works, for example Meister Druff in ''Adventures of a Bachelor'' and Lehrer Bokelmann in ''Plish and Plum'', where is shown an almost sexual pleasure in applying punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Mihr, pp. 76–79&lt;/ref&gt; Beatings and humiliation are found in his later work too; biographer Gudrun Schury described this as Busch's life-motif.&lt;ref&gt;Schury, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--In the 1904 poetry collection ''Zu guter Letzt'' there is written:
:''Es saust der Stock, es schwirrt die Rute.
:''Du darfst nicht zeigen, was du bist
:''Wie schad, o Mensch, daß dir das Gute
:''Im Grunde so zuwider ist.
--&gt;

In the estate of Busch there is the note "Durch die Kinderjahre hindurchgeprügelt" (Beaten through the childhood years),&lt;ref&gt;Mihr, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; however there is no evidence that Busch was referring to himself.&lt;ref&gt;Schury, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; He couldn't recall any beating from his father. His uncle Kleine beat him once, not with the conventional [[rattan]] stick, but symbolically with dried [[dahlia]] stalks, this for stuffing cow hairs into a village idiot's pipe.&lt;ref&gt;Kraus, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Weissweiler observes that Busch probably saw canings at his village school, where he went for three years, and quite possibly also received this punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Weissweiler, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Abenteuer eines Junggesellen'' Busch illustrates a form of nonviolent progressive education that fails in one scene, and caning in the following scene; the canings that ensued indicate Busch's pessimistic picture of life, which has its roots in the [[Augustine of Hippo|Protestant]] ethic of the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;Mihr, pp. 27–40, 61–70&lt;/ref&gt; in which he believed that man is inherently evil and will never master his vices. Civilisation is the aim of education, but it can only mask man's instincts superficially.&lt;ref&gt;Pietzcker, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; Gentleness only leads to a continuation of man's misdeeds, therefore punishment is required, even if he retains his unrepentant character, becomes a trained puppet, or in extreme cases, dies.&lt;ref&gt;Schury, pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antisemitism===
[[File:Busch Werke v3 p 477.jpg|thumb|right|upright|240px|Preface of the fifth chapter of ''Plisch und Plum'']]
The [[Panic of 1873]] led to growing criticism of high finance and the spread of radical [[Antisemitism]], which in the 1880s became a broad undercurrent.&lt;ref&gt;[[Volker Ullrich|Ullrich, Volker]]: ''Die nervöse Großmacht: Aufstieg und Untergang des deutschen Kaiserreichs 1871–1918'', [[S. Fischer Verlag|Fischer Taschenbuch]] 17240, Frankfort on the Main, 2006, {{ISBN|978-3-596-11694-2}}, p. 383&lt;/ref&gt; These criticisms saw a separation of capital into what was construed as "raffendes" ([[financial capital|speculative capital]]), and what constituted "constructive" creative production capital. The "good", "native" and "German" manufacturer was praised by Antisemitic [[agitator]]s, such as [[Theodor Fritsch]], who opposed what he saw as "'rapacious' 'greedy', 'blood-sucking', 'Jewish' financial capitalism in the form of '[[Plutocracy|plutocrats]]' and 'usurers'".&lt;ref&gt;Piefel, Matthias: ''Antisemitismus und völkische Bewegung im Königreich Sachsen 1879–1914'', V&amp;R unipress Göttingen, 2004, {{ISBN|3-89971-187-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Busch was thought to have embraced those [[stereotype]]s. Two passages are often underlined, one in ''Helen Who Couldn't Help It'':
{{Col-begin|width=70%}}
{{Col-2}}
&lt;poem&gt;
Und der Jud mit krummer Ferse,
Krummer Nas' und krummer Hos'
Schlängelt sich zur hohen Börse
Tiefverderbt und seelenlos.
&lt;/poem&gt;
{{Col-2}}
&lt;poem&gt;
And the Hebrew, sly and craven,
Round of shoulder, nose, and knee,
Slinks to the Exchange, unshaven
And intent on usury
&lt;/poem&gt;
{{Col-end}}
&lt;!--
Even more obvious remarks are found in ''[[Plisch und Plum]]''; according to biographer Joseph Kraus, they could have been written for anti-Semitical hate sheets, and Weissweiler noted they were the most memorable and ugliest depictions of a German Jew.&lt;ref&gt;Kraus, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weissweiler, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Col-begin|width=70%}}
{{Col-2}}
&lt;poem&gt;
Kurz die Hose, lang der Rock
Krumm die Nase und der Stock
Augen schwarz und Seele grau,
Hut nach hinten, Miene schlau&amp;nbsp;—
So ist Schmulchen Schiefelbeiner
(Schöner ist doch unsereiner!)
&lt;/poem&gt;
{{Col-2}}
&lt;poem&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;
{{Col-end}}
--&gt;
[[Robert Gernhardt]] defended Busch by stating that Jews are satirized only in three passages, of which the oldest is an illustration of a text by another author, published in 1860. He stated that Busch's Jewish figures are merely stereotypical, one of a number of stereotypes, such as the "limited Bavarian farmer" and the "Prussian tourist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.literaturkritik.de/public/rezension.php?rez_id=6369&amp;ausgabe=200309|title=Schöner ist doch unsereiner|author=Gernhardt, Robert|language=German|accessdate=29 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Kraus shares the same view, and uses a couplet from ''Eight Sheets in the Wind'' (Die Haarbeutel),&lt;ref&gt;Kraus, pp. 88–89&lt;/ref&gt; in which profit-seeking people are:
{{Col-begin|width=70%}}
{{Col-2}}
&lt;poem&gt;
Vornehmlich Juden, Weiber, Christen,
Die dich ganz schrecklich überlisten.
[Mainly Jews, women, Christians / They outwit you terribly]
&lt;/poem&gt;
{{Col-2}}
&lt;poem&gt;
Most often wenches, Christians, Jews,
Who would much sooner see you lose
&lt;/poem&gt;
{{Col-end}}
&lt;!--The non-Jew is therefore not better, as the ironical row "Schöner ist doch unsereiner!" indicates in ''Plüsch und Plum''.--&gt;Although Gernhardt felt that Jews for Busch were alien, the Jewish conductor [[Hermann Levi]] befriended him, suggesting that Busch had a slight bias towards Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Kraus, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biographies==
The first biography on Busch, ''Über Wilhelm Busch und seine Bedeutung'' (About Wilhelm Busch and His Importance), was released in 1886. The publisher Eduard Daelen, also an artist and writer, echoed Busch's anti-Catholic bias, putting him on equal footing with [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], and uncritically quoting correspondences. Even Busch and his friends were embarrassed.&lt;ref&gt;Kraus, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; Literary scholar [[Friedrich Theodor Vischer]] attacked Daelen's biography and called him the "envious eunuch of the desiccated Philistine".&lt;ref&gt;Weissweiler, pp. 308–309&lt;/ref&gt; After reading this biography Johannes Proelß posted an essay in the [[Frankfurter Zeitung]], which contained many biographical falsehoods&amp;nbsp;— as a response to this, Busch wrote two articles in the same newspaper. Published in October and December 1886, the autobiographical essay ''Regarding Myself'' (Was mich betrifft) includes basic facts, and some description of his troubles;&lt;ref&gt;Krause, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; analysts see within the essay a deep identity crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Wessling, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; Busch revised his autobiography over the following years. The last such essay was published under the title ''From Me About Me'' (Von mir über mich), which includes fewer biographical details and less reflection on bitterness and amusement than ''Regarding Myself''.&lt;ref&gt;Kraus, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Hannover Wilhelm-Busch-Museum.jpg|thumb|right|240px|The [[Wilhelm Busch Museum]] in the [[Georgenpalais]], Hanover]]
[[File:Busch Haus Mechtshausen.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Museum Wilhelm-Busch-Haus in Busch's former home in [[Mechtshausen]]]]

Busch celebrated his 70th anniversary at his nephew's house in [[Hattorf am Harz]]. Over 1,000 congratulatory messages were sent to Mechtshausen from around the world. [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] praised the poet and artist, whose "exquisite works are full of genuine humour and are everlasting for the German people".&lt;ref&gt;Weissweiler, p. 340&lt;/ref&gt; The Austrian [[:de:Alldeutsche Vereinigung|Alldeutsche Vereinigung]] (Pan-German Association) repealed the ban on ''Der heilige Antonius von Padua''.&lt;ref name="K1" /&gt; Verlag Braun &amp; Schneider, who owned the rights of ''Max and Moritz'', gave Busch 20,000 [[Reichsmark]] (around €200,000 or $270,000), which was donated to two hospitals in [[Hanover]].&lt;ref name="K1"&gt;Kraus, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, on the dates of his birth and death, he has been celebrated frequently. During the 175th anniversary in 2007, there were numerous re-publications of Busch works. [[Deutsche Post]] issued stamps depicting the Busch character Hans Huckebein — itself the inspiration for the nickname of the never-built [[Focke-Wulf Ta 183]] German jet fighter design of 1945 — and the German Republic minted a 10 [[Euro]] silver coin faced with his portrait.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressedienst-numismatik.de/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=242&amp;Itemid=37 "Wilhelm Busch wird mit 10-Euro-Silbergedenkmünze geehrt"] (in German), Pressedienst Numismatik, 7 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Hanover declared 2007 the "Wilhelm Busch Year", with [[advertising column|images]] featuring Busch works erected within the city centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/reise/article806534/Zuhause-bei-Max-und-Moritz.html|title=Zuhause bei Max und Moritz|trans-title=At Home with Max and Moritz|publisher=Die Welt|author=Lammert, Andrea|language=German|date=15 April 2007|accessdate=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Wilhelm Busch Prize]] is awarded annually for satirical and humorous poetry. The Wilhelm Busch Society, active since 1930, aims to "(...) collect, scientifically revise and promote Wilhelm Busch's works with the public". It supports the development of [[caricature]] and satirical artwork as a recognized branch of the visual arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.karikatur-museum.de/index.php|title=Home Page|publisher=Wilhelm Busch&amp;nbsp;— Deutsches Museum für Karikatur &amp; Zeichenkunst|language=German|accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an advocate of the [[Wilhelm Busch Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilhelm-busch-museum.de/ Homepage of the Deutsches Museum für Karikatur und Zeichenkunst] (in German). Retrieved on 14 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Memorials are located in places he lived, including Wiedensahl, Ebergötzen, Lüthorst, Mechtshausen and Hattorf am Harz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.karikatur-museum.de/233_Gedenkstaetten.html|title=Gedenkstätten|trans-title=Memorials|publisher=Deutsches Museum für Karikatur und Zeichenkunst|language=German|accessdate=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence on comics===
[[Andreas C. Knigge]] described Busch as the "first virtuoso" of illustrated stories.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andreas C. Knigge|Knigge, Andreas C.]]: ''Comics&amp;nbsp;— Vom Massenblatt ins multimediale Abenteuer'', p. 14. Rowohlt Taschenbuch Verlag, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; From the second half of the 20th century he was considered the "Forefather of Comics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/zeitung/der-urvater-des-comics/1125978.html | title=Urvater des Comics |trans-title=Forefather of Comics|author=Töpper, Stephan | publisher=''[[Der Tagesspiegel]]''|language=German| date=22 December 2007 | accessdate= 28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His early illustrations differ from those of the colleagues of Kaspar Braun. They show an increasing focus on protagonists, are less detailed in drawing and atmosphere, and develop from a dramatic understanding of the whole story.&lt;ref&gt;Schury, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; All Busch's illustrated tales have a plot that firstly describes the circumstance, then a resulting conflict, then solution.&lt;ref&gt;Ruby, Daniel: ''Schema und Variation&amp;nbsp;— Untersuchungen zum Bildergeschichtenwerk Wilhelm Buschs''. Europäische Hochschulschriften, Frankfurt am Main 1998, {{ISBN|3-631-49725-3}}, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Plots are developed through consecutive scenes, similar to film storyboards. Busch conveys an impression of movement and action, at times strengthened through a change of perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Ueding, p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gert Ueding, his depiction of movement is unique.&lt;ref&gt;Ueding, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Busch's notable stories is ''Der Virtuos'' (1865), which describes the life of a pianist who plays privately for an excited listener. Satirizing the self-publicizing artist's attitude and his overblown adoration, it varies from Busch's other stories as each scene does not contain prose, but is defined with music terminology, such as "Introduzione", "Maestoso" and "Fortissimo vivacissimo". As the scenes increase in tempo, each part of his body and [[lappet]] run around. The penultimate scene again depicts the pianist's movements, with score sheets floating above the grand piano on which musical notes are dancing.&lt;ref&gt;Weissweiler, pp. 142–143&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schury, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years graphic artists have been fascinated by ''Der Virtuos''. [[August Macke]], in a letter to gallery owner [[Herwarth Walden]], described Busch as the first [[Futurism|Futurist]], stating how well he captured time and movement.&lt;ref&gt;Weissweiler, pp. 143–144&lt;/ref&gt; Similar pioneering scenes are in ''Bilder zur Jobsiade'' (1872). Job fails to answer rather easy questions set by twelve clergy, who shake their heads in synchronicity. Each scene is a movement study that presages [[Eadweard Muybridge]]'s photography. Muybridge began his work in 1872, not released until 1893.&lt;ref&gt;Weissweiler, pp. 204–205&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Moritzian" influence===
[[File:Katzenjammer1901.jpg|right|thumb|240px|A scene from [[Rudolph Dirks]]' ''[[The Katzenjammer Kids]]'', 1901]]
Busch's greatest success, both within Germany and internationally, was with ''Max and Moritz'':&lt;ref&gt;Wessling, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; Up to the time of his death it was translated into English, Danish, Hebrew, Japanese, Latin, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Hungarian, Swedish and Walloonian.&lt;ref&gt;Schury, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; Several countries banned the story&amp;nbsp;– about 1929 the [[Styria]]n school board prohibited sales of ''Max and Moritz'' to teens under eighteen.&lt;ref&gt;Wessling, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; By 1997 more than 281 dialect and language translations had been produced.&lt;ref&gt;Diers, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

Some early "Moritzian" comic strips were heavily influenced by Busch in plot and narrative style. ''Tootle and Bootle'' (1896), borrowed so much content from ''Max and Moritz'' that it was described as a pirate edition.&lt;ref name="we331"&gt;Weissweiler, p. 331&lt;/ref&gt; The true "Moritzian" recreation is ''[[The Katzenjammer Kids]]'' by German artist [[Rudolph Dirks]], published in the ''[[New York Journal-American|New York Journal]]'' from 1897. It was published though [[William Randolph Hearst]]'s suggestion that a pair of siblings following the pattern of "Max and Moritz" should be created.&lt;ref name="we331" /&gt; ''The Katzenjammer Kids'' is regarded as one of the oldest, continuous [[comic strip]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1989458_1989457_1989441,00.html |title=Top 10 Long-Running Comic Strips / The Katzenjammer Kids |author=Claire Suddath |publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine |date=17 May 2010 |accessdate=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German "Moritzian"-inspired stories include ''Lies und Lene; die Schwestern von Max und Moritz'' (Hulda Levetzow, F. Maddalena, 1896), ''Schlumperfritz und Schlamperfranz'' (1922), ''Sigismund und Waldemar, des Max und Moritz Zwillingspaar'' (Walther Günther, 1932) and ''Mac und Mufti'' (Thomas Ahlers, Volker Dehs, 1987).&lt;ref&gt;Diers, pp. 65–67&lt;/ref&gt; These are shaped by observations of the First and Second World Wars, while the original is a moral story.&lt;ref&gt;Ueding, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958 the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|Christian Democratic Union]] used the ''Max and Moritz'' characters for a [[Political campaign|campaign]] in North Rhine-Westphalia, the same year that the [[East Germany|East German]] satirical magazine ''[[Eulenspiegel (magazine)|Eulenspiegel]]'' used them to caricature black labour. In 1969 ''Max and Moritz'' "participated" in late 1960s [[German student movement|student activism]].&lt;ref&gt;Diers, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;
