'''Abhimāna''' ([[Sanskrit]]:अभिमान) variously means – pride, false prestige, desire, an impression, the conception, by self-conception, from the misconception; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meaning of the Sanskrit word – abhimana|publisher=Sanskritdictionary.org|url=http://sanskritdictionary.org/abhimana}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Hindu philosophy]], it means – prideful attachment of "I-sense" i.e. ''man'' (to think) + ''māna'' (too much); it also means – identify or identification&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Be Free From “Me|author=Paul Bahder|publisher=Vision of Vedanta|page=|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=PdGwAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT191&amp;dq=abhimana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_efyVNmwCo6OuASq1YKoAw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=abhimana&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; and also refers to selfish conviction, for ''abhimāna'' is the function of ''[[ahamkara]]'' (ego) as the state of mind which interprets experience as " mine ".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of the Hindu World Part 1|publisher=Concept Publishing|page=107|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=w9pmo51lRnYC&amp;pg=PA107&amp;dq=abhimana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=n-PyVN64Mc6WuATfq4G4Cg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=abhimana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The psychological sense of "I" am experience is ''ahamkāra'' which comes about as and when owing to '' [[Avidya (Hinduism)|avidya]] '', [[Brahman]], the Universal transcendental Self, is distinguished from the [[Jiva]], the empirical individual self. ''Sanga'' (one’s associations), ''mamkāra'' (attachments) and ''moha'' (attractions) are the three aspects of abhimāna (ego-consciousness)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Psychology in India Vol. 4|publisher=Pearson Publications|pages=130–131|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=fXQzo7LGfuIC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;dq=abhimana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=n-PyVN64Mc6WuATfq4G4Cg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=abhimana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; which produces ''katrtva'' (the sense agency) as the deliberate consciousness of ''niścaya'' (decision) without which there would be no difference between the self and other material objects; '' [[buddhi]] '' (intellect), which manifests according to ''[[vāsanā]]s'' (impressions), is deliberate decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Indian Philosophy Vol.5|author=Surendranathh Dasgupta|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|pages=34–35|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=aohGsuUuXuMC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;dq=abhimana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=g-fyVI6xB86KuASYvIHACQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=abhimana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:  " The antahkarana (internal organ, the mind) has its seat in these, the eye and other organs of the body identifying itself with them with the sense of "I" by reflection of the ātman in it. "   – [[Vivekachudamani]] (105)

[[Adi Shankara|Shankara]] tells us that the mind or manas dwells in the organs and body as ''aham'' (ego) with ''abhimāna'' – अहमित्यभिमानेन in the reflected brightness of the atman as the ''kartā'' (doer) and the ''bhoktā'' (enjoyer) experiencing all three states of consciousness but the atman, the witness of everything, limited by ''buddhi'' is not tainted by anything that ''buddhi'' does – अशेषसाक्षी for the taint of action attaches only to the actor, the ātman does not act. This ''abhimāna'' or identification with names and forms dependent on the perishable body, as also with the subtle body, needs to be given up entirely in order to realize ''akhanda ānanda'' (inseparable bliss).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Foundations of Indian Psychology Vol.1|author=Cormelissen R.M.Matthijs|publisher=Pearson Education|page=139|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=xmiJWZnCH1oC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;dq=abhimana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=n-PyVN64Mc6WuATfq4G4Cg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=abhimana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vācaspati Miśra]] explains that it is ''ahamkāra'' (empirical ego) which presides over the objects intuited by the sense-organs and then definitely perceived by the mind; and that the sense-organ intuits the object, ''manas'' reflects on it, ''ahamkāra'' appropriates it and finally ''buddhi'' (intellect) resolves which way the intended action must proceed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ancient Indian Education|author=Radha Kumud Mookerji|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=294|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=mjFfqpq7HhkC&amp;pg=PA294&amp;dq=abhimana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7uTyVKHQLMSHuATkzYCgBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=abhimana&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Abhimāna'' is the false sense of "I" and "mine"; it is because of the emphatic identity (''abhimāna'') with one’s body etc., that there is ''pramata'' (cognising subject) and involvement with ''pramānas'' (acts or processes of knowing, perception, inference and the rest) owing to functioning of the senses as resulting from ''avidyā'' (ignorance) and resulting in bondage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Philosophy of Sankar’s Advaita Vedanta|author=Shyama Kumar Chattopadhyaya|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|pages=41,366|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=IPasbJW-1PwC&amp;pg=PA366&amp;dq=abhimana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=S-jyVIefOIeRuASBwIKYBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=abhimana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examined from the level of social consciousness, ātman or the transcendental consciousness is certainly essential for man’s being but ''[[upadhi]]s'' (limitations) are its accidental parts the self-identification with which gives rise to ''abhimāna'' (identification with the body) that makes man a socio-spiritual being subjective and objective, both, and becomes the basis for his ''adhikāra'' (social and ritual eligibility).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Foundations of Indian Culture Vol.1|author=Govind Chandra Pande|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=3|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=VMf-isGALqQC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=abhimana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=n-PyVN64Mc6WuATfq4G4Cg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=abhimana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Shudha Advaita school of [[Vallabha Acharya]], ''saguna'' means – one having the ''abhimāna'' of gunas (forming part of one’s own self), the ''nirguna'' is one having no abhimāna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kalatattvakosa|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=18|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=_YHYrni9wckC&amp;pg=PA186&amp;dq=abhimana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7uTyVKHQLMSHuATkzYCgBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=abhimana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lakshmi Tantra]] tells us that "''ahamkāra'' which is a cognitive-sense, is identical with ''abhimāna''" and "the awareness of the knower in relating time and place to himself is called ''abhimāna''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lakshmi Tantra|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=33|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=pENlKmZ4r94C&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=abhimana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vubyVLmMIIKSuQTn5IIg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=abhimana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; For most people desiring success, incidental gains and weighed down by sense of self-respect ''abhimāna'' is a virtue but for those who are wise and contented, it is mere pride associated with arrogance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Design and Rhetoric in Sanskrit Court Epic|publisher=SUNY Press|page=81|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=tTm5RVOAEnMC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=abhimana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7uTyVKHQLMSHuATkzYCgBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=abhimana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Bhoja]], who outlined the theory of [[Rasa (aesthetics)|Rasa]] (experience of delight), attaches great importance to ''abhimāna'' or ''ahankāra'' (ego). He states that the ''[[rasika]]'' who has ''rasa'' in him has it because of ''[[sringara]]'' (peak), ''ahamkāra'' and ''abhimāna'', enjoyable as a ''[[guna]]'' of his atman; he uses the term ''abhimāna'' in a good sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=I.A.Richards and Indian Theory of Rasa|author=Gupteshwar Prasad|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|pages=16–25|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=hmy5cnSbsWYC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=abhimana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=P-byVJTjLdCOuATbwIC4Bw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=abhimana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; From ''ahamkāra'' rises ''abhimāna'' that originates ''sringāra'', and from ''abhimāna'' rises ''[[rati]]'' (love, amorousness), and from ''rati'' are originated all ''rasas''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Glimpses of Indian Poetics|author=Satya Dev Chaudhari|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|page=106|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=hnB8-TPF7pYC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;dq=abhimana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=n-PyVN64Mc6WuATfq4G4Cg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=abhimana&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Architecture criticism''' is the critique of architecture. Everyday criticism relates to published or broadcast critiques of [[building]]s, whether completed or not, both in terms of news and other criteria. In many cases, criticism amounts to an assessment of the architect's success in meeting his or her own aims and objectives and those of others. The assessment may consider the subject from the perspective of some wider context, which may involve planning, social or aesthetic issues. It may also take a polemical position reflecting the critic's own values. At the most accessible extreme, architectural criticism is a branch of lifestyle journalism, especially in the case of high-end residential projects.

==Media coverage==
Most major national [[newspapers]] in developed countries cover the [[arts]] in some form. Architectural [[criticism]] may be included as a part of their arts coverage, in a [[real estate]] section or a ''Home &amp; Style'' supplement.&lt;ref name="goldberger"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Goldberger |first=Paul |title=Architecture Criticism: Does It Matter |work=Paul Goldberger |accessdate=2008-07-10 |date=2003-11-12 |url=http://www.paulgoldberger.com/speeches.php?speech=criticism |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070622164550/http://www.paulgoldberger.com/speeches.php?speech=criticism |archivedate=June 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the USA, reviews are published in specialist magazines ranging from the popular (e.g. [[Architectural Digest]], [[Wallpaper (magazine)|Wallpaper]]) to specialist magazines for design professionals (e.g. [[Architectural Review]], [[DETAIL (professional journal)|Detail]]). As with other forms of criticism, [[technical language]] is used to a varying extent to convey impressions and views precisely.

[[Lewis Mumford]] wrote extensively on architecture in the nineteen thirties, forties and fifties at ''[[The New Yorker]]''.&lt;ref name="goldberger" /&gt; [[Ada Louise Huxtable]] was the first full-time architecture critic working for an American daily newspaper when ''[[The New York Times]]'' gave her the role in 1963.&lt;ref name="goldberger" /&gt; [[John Betjeman]], a co-founder of the [[Victorian Society]], wrote and broadcast from the 1950s to 1970s, principally covering historical rather than new buildings, but contributing to a trend for criticism to expand into radio and then television. [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], is outspoken in his criticism of modern architecture, memorably describing a proposed extension to the [[National Gallery (London)|National Gallery in London]] as a "[[monstrous carbuncle]] on the face of a much-loved friend".

==Criteria==

The  critic's task is to assess how successful the architect and others involved with the project have been in meeting both the criteria the project set out to meet and those that the critic himself feels to be important. Specific criteria include:

* [[Aesthetics]]
* [[Proportion (architecture)|Proportion]]
* [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionality]]
* [[Architectural styles|Architectural style]]
* Choice and use of [[building materials]]
* [[Built environment]] or context
* [[Sustainability]]

'''Biting''' is a common behavior which involves the opening and closing of the [[jaw]] found in many animals. This behavior is found in [[Reptile|reptiles]], [[Mammal|mammals]], [[fish]] and [[Amphibian|amphibians]]. [[Arthropod|Arthropods]] can also bite. Biting is a physical action in an attack but it is also a normal activity or response in an animal as it eats, carries objects, softens and prepares food for its young, removes [[Parasitism|ectoparasites]] from its body surface, removes plant seeds attached to its fur or hair, scratches itself, and grooms other animals and for defense. Animal bites often result in serious infections and death.&lt;ref name=Cherry2014&gt;{{cite book | last = Cherry | first = James | title = Feigin and Cherry's textbook of pediatric infectious diseases – Animal and Human Bites, Morven S.

== In Humans ==
Biting is also an [[age appropriate]] [[behavior]] and reaction for human children 30 months and younger. Conversely, children above this age are expected to have verbal skills to explain their needs and dislikes, as biting is not seen as age appropriate. Biting may be prevented by methods including redirection, change in the environment and responding to biting by talking about appropriate ways to express anger and frustration. School age children, those older than 30 months, who habitually bite may require professional intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Child Care Links,"[http://www.childcarelinks.org/fyi/fyi_pdf/HOW%20TO%20HANDLE%20BITING.pdf How to Handle Biting] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007012046/http://www.childcarelinks.org/fyi/fyi_pdf/HOW%20TO%20HANDLE%20BITING.pdf|date=October 7, 2011}}", retrieved 14 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  Some discussion of human biting appears in ''[[Kinsey Reports#Biting|The Kinsey Report on Sexual Behavior in the Human Female]]''.

The '''California Clay Movement''' (or '''American Clay Revolution''') was a school of [[ceramic art]] that emerged in [[California]] in the 1950s.{{sfn|Marter|2011|p=185}}
The movement was part of the larger transition in crafts from "designer-craftsman" to "artist-craftsman".
The editor of ''[[Rose Slivka#work on Craft Horizons|Craft Horizons]]'', New York-based [[Rose Slivka]], became an enthusiastic advocate of the movement.{{sfn|Kaplan|2011|p=227}}

==Peter Voulkos==

[[Peter Voulkos]] was one of the movement's driving forces.
He established the Ceramic Center at the Los Angeles County Art Institute (now the [[Otis College of Art and Design]]), 
where he created massive, abstract ceramic sculptures.{{sfn|Marter|2011|p=185}} He felt that his free-form ceramic works were like jazz compositions: improvisational and free spirited.{{sfn|Barron|Bernstein|Fort|2000|p=185}} Voulkos began creating ever larger ceramic works to break away from the conventional arts and crafts of his day. Some of his work, named "plates", "ice buckets" or "tea bowls", were "deconstructed" traditional forms of glazed pottery. Others, such as his "stacks", were non-utilitarian and purely sculptural. During a career that lasted almost half a century, Voulkos made over 200 "stacks", some as much as {{convert|2|m}} in height.{{sfn|Marter|2011|p=132}}  
Writing about the clay movement in 1963, a reviewer in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' said "Peter Voulkos' rough, ragged monuments are powerful weapons against the slick coffee-table pottery that often passes for modern art, and already a generation of fierce West Coast individualists has joined him at the barricades."{{sfn|Art: The Clay Movement}}

==Pupils==

Voulkos profoundly influenced [[John Mason (artist)|John Mason]], [[Kenneth Price]]{{sfn|Marter|2011|p=185}} and [[Paul Soldner]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.franklloyd.com/dynamic/artist_bio.asp?ArtistID=30|title=Paul Soldner biography presented by|website=www.franklloyd.com|access-date=2017-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Paul Soldner|.]]
Voulkos turned the Los Angeles County Art Institute into an important center for ceramic art between 1954 and 1959.  Moving to the University of California in Berkeley he and sculptors such as [[Sidney Gordon (sculptor)|Sidney Gordon]] and [[Harold Paris]] developed an influential school of sculpture. His pupils included [[Kenneth Price]], [[Billy Al Bengston]], [[Robert Arneson]] and [[Stan Bitters]].{{sfn|Marter|2011|p=132}} The work of Voulkos, Arneson and others typified Californian art in the 1950s and 1960s, and was featured in many exhibitions.{{sfn|Barron|Bernstein|Fort|2000|p=36}}

[[Stephen De Staebler]] was another influential sculptor working mostly in clay and bronze who has been associated with the California Clay movement.{{sfn|Turner|2010}} A reviewer said of him that "He practically invented his own art form by beating and buckling tons of clay into awesome mountainous landscapes, but his human sculptures are also very moving."{{sfn|Keats|2012}} [[Michael Frimkess]] is another master of the California clay movement.{{sfn|Davidson|2011}} Frimkess was a student of Peter Voulkos, and adopted the [[abstract expressionist]] style of sculpture taught by Voulkos.{{sfn|Michael Frimkess}} In 2014, Frimkess received the Career Achievement Award from the [[Hammer Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-hammer-museum-made-in-la-awards-winners-20140818-story.html Jessica Gelt, "Hammer Museum announces winners of 2014 Made in L.A. Mohn Awards", ''Los Agenels Times'', 18 August 2014.],&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==

Voulkos had huge influence, not just on potters and sculptors but even on painters.{{sfn|Marter|2011|p=132}}
Awareness of the movement quickly spread. In 1959 the Guyanese artist [[Donald Locke]] obtained a grant to study for a master's degree in fine arts at [[Edinburgh College of Art]], a school in the [[University of Edinburgh]]. There he met the artists Dave Cohen, Sheldon Kaganof and Dion Myers, who introduced the ideas of the California Clay Movement to Britain. For many years his work reflected their influence.{{sfn|Locke|2007}}

{{Cleanup|reason=The Carnegie Classifications changed sponsorship on January 1, 2015 &amp; most ref cites are already invalid.|date=October 2014}}

The '''Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education''' is a framework for classifying colleges and universities in the [[United States]]. The framework primarily serves educational and research purposes, where it is often important to identify groups of roughly comparable institutions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carnegieclassifications.iu.edu/|title=About Carnegie Classification|last=|first=|date=n.d.|website=The Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education|publisher=Indiana University Center for Postsecondary Research|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The classification includes all [[School accreditation|accredited]], [[academic degree|degree]]-granting colleges and universities in the United States that are represented in the National Center for Education Statistics [[Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System]] (IPEDS).

The Carnegie Classification was created by the [[Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching|Carnegie Commission on Higher Education]] in 1970. The classification was first published in 1973 with updates in 1976, 1987, 1994, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; To ensure continuity of the classification framework and to allow comparison across years, the 2015 Classification update retains the same structure of six parallel classifications, initially adopted in 2005.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The 2005 report substantially reworked the classification system, based on data from the 2002–2003 and 2003–2004 school years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Basic Classification Technical Details | publisher = Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching | year=  2005 | url = http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/index.asp?key=805 | accessdate = 24 September 2008 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 8, 2014, the Carnegie Foundation transferred responsibility for the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education to the Center for Postsecondary Research of the [[Indiana University School of Education]] in [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]], [[Indiana]]. The classification retained the Carnegie name after the Center for Postsecondary Research took over on January 1, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.carnegiefoundation.org/newsroom/news-releases/iu-research-center-house-carnegie-classification-institutions-higher-education|title=IU research Center to House Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education|last=|first=|date=2014-10-08|work=Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching|access-date=2017-06-02|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General description==
Information used in these classifications comes primarily from IPEDS and the [[College Board]].

==Basic classification==
The number of institutions in each category is indicated in parentheses.&lt;ref name="BasicClassSum"&gt;

===Doctorate-granting Universities===
''Doctorate-granting Universities'' are institutions that awarded at least 20 research/scholarly doctorates in 2013–14. Professional doctorates (M.D., J.D., etc.) are not included in this count. The framework further classifies these universities by their level of research activity, as measured by research expenditures, number of research doctorates awarded, number of research-focused faculty, and other factors.&lt;ref name=BasicTechnical&gt;The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (2005). [http://www.carnegieclassification-preview.org/pdf/cc2005.pdf 2005 Carnegie Classifications Initial Release]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929061656/http://www.carnegieclassification-preview.org/pdf/cc2005.pdf |date=29 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A detailed list of schools can be found in the [[List of research universities in the United States]].

===Baccalaureate Colleges===
''Baccalaureate Colleges'' are institutions where "bachelor's degrees accounted for at least 10 percent of all undergraduate degrees and they awarded fewer than 50 master's degrees (2013–14-degree conferrals)."&lt;ref name=BasicTechnical /&gt;

*''Baccalaureate Colleges—Arts &amp; Sciences'' (259)
*''Baccalaureate Colleges—Diverse Fields'' (324)
*''Baccalaureate/Associate's Colleges: Associates Dominant'' (149)
*''Baccalaureate/Associate's Colleges: Mixed Baccalaureate/Associate's'' (259)

===Associates Colleges===
''Associates Colleges'' are institutions whose highest degree is the associate degree, or bachelor's degrees account for fewer than 10 percent of all undergraduate degrees (2013–14-degree conferrals).

*''Associate's Colleges: High Transfer - High Traditional'' (166)
*''Associate's Colleges: High Transfer - Mixed Traditional/Nontraditional'' (127)

*''Associate's Colleges: High Career - Mixed Traditional/Nontraditional'' (123)
*''Associate's Colleges: High Career - High Nontraditional'' (184)

===Special Focus Institutions===
''Special Focus Institutions'' were classified "based on the concentration of degrees in a single field or set of related fields, at both undergraduate and graduate levels. Institutions were determined to have a special focus with concentrations of at least 80 percent of undergraduate and graduate degrees. In some cases this percentage criterion was relaxed if an institution identified a special focus on the [[College Board]]'s Annual Survey of Colleges, or if an institution's only accreditation was from a body related to the special focus categories".&lt;ref name=BasicTechnical /&gt;

*''Special Focus Two-Year: Health Professions'' (267)
*''Special Focus Two-Year: Technical Professions'' (62)

===Not classified===
The Basic Classification omits 26 institutions.

==Undergraduate Instructional Program==
The ''Undergraduate Instructional Program'' classification combines (a) the ratio of Arts and sciences and professional fields (as defined in the [http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2002165 Classification of Instructional Programs] (CIP)) and (b) the coexistence of programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels (again using the CIP).&lt;ref name=UIPTechnical&gt;The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (2005). [http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/index.asp?key=793 Technical Details &gt; Undergraduate Instructional Program].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arts and sciences and professional fields===
The framework categorizes institutions based on the proportion of undergraduate majors in arts and sciences or professional fields, based on their two-digit CIP.&lt;ref name=UIPTechnical /&gt;

* ''Associates Only (Assoc)'' only award associate degrees.
* ''Associates Dominant (Assoc-Dom)'' award some bachelor's degrees, but award more associates's degrees.
* ''Arts &amp; Sciences Focus (A&amp;S-F)'' award least 80 percent of undergraduate degrees in the arts and sciences.
* ''Arts &amp; Sciences + Professions (A&amp;S+Prof)'' award between 80 and 59 percent of undergraduate degrees in the arts and sciences.
* ''Balanced Arts &amp; Sciences/Professions (Bal)'' award 41 to 59 percent of undergraduate degrees in each domain.
* ''Professions + Arts &amp; Sciences (Prof+A&amp;S)'' award between 80 and 59 percent of undergraduate degrees in a professional field.
* ''Professions Focus (Prof-F)'' award at least 80 percent of undergraduate degrees in a professional field.

===Graduate coexistence===
The framework categorizes institutions based on the proportion of undergraduate and graduate programs (defined by their 4-digit CIP) that coexist.&lt;ref name=UIPTechnical /&gt;

* ''No coexistence (NGC)''—no programs coexist.
* ''Some coexistence (SGC)''—some graduate programs coexist with undergraduate programs but fewer than half.
* ''High coexistence (HGC)''—at least half of the graduate programs coexist with undergraduate programs.

==Graduate instructional program==
The ''Graduate Instructional Program'' classification indicates (a) if the institution awards just master's degrees or master's degrees and doctoral degrees, and (b) in what general categories they  predominantly award graduate degrees. Institutions that do not award graduate degrees are not classified by this scheme.&lt;ref name=GIPTechnical&gt;The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (2005). [http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/index.asp?key=794 "Technical Details &gt; Graduate Instructional Program"].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postbaccalaureate graduate programs===
Institutions that offer graduate and professional programs (such as law schools) but do not award the doctorate are classified as having ''Postbaccalaureate'' graduate programs.&lt;ref name=GIPTechnical /&gt; These programs are classified by the fields in which the degrees are awarded.

*Single postbaccalaureate (education) (S-PostBac/Ed)''—only offer graduate training in education.
*''Single postbaccalaureate (business) (S-PostBac/Bus)''—only offer graduate training in business.

*''Doctoral, professional dominant (Doc/Prof)'' award most of their doctorates are awarded in professional fields other than engineering.

==Enrollment profile==
The Enrollment Profile of institutions are classified according to (a) the level of the highest degree awarded and (b) the ratio of undergraduate to graduate students.&lt;ref name=EPTechnical&gt;The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (2005). [http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/index.asp?key=795 Technical Details &gt; Enrollment Profile Program].&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Exclusively undergraduate two-year (ExU2)''—students are not awarded bachelor's or higher degrees.
*''Exclusively undergraduate four-year (ExU4)''—students are only awarded bachelor's degrees.
*''Very high undergraduate (VHU)''—fewer than 10 percent of students are graduate students.
*''High undergraduate (HU)''—more than 10 percent, but fewer than 25 percent of students are graduate students.
*''Majority undergraduate (MU)''—more than 24 percent, but fewer than 50 percent of students are graduate students.
*''Majority graduate/professional (MGP)''—fewer than 50 percent of students are undergraduates.
*''Exclusively graduate/professional (ExGP)—''students are only awarded degrees higher than bachelor's.

==Undergraduate profile==
The framework classifies institutions' ''Undergraduate Profile'' according to (a) the proportion of part-time undergraduate students to full-time students, (b) the institutions selectivity in admitting undergraduate students, and (c) the percentage of students who transfer into the university.&lt;ref name=UPTechnical&gt;The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (2005). [http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/index.asp?key=796 Technical Details &gt; Undergraduate Profile].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enrollment status===
The framework classifies ''Enrollment Status'' according to the ratio of part-time to full-time students (degree seeking students in four-year institutions).&lt;ref name=UPFlowchart&gt;The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (2005). [http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/dynamic/downloads/file_1_338.pdf Undergraduate Profile] classification flow chart.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''PT2'': Higher part-time two-year—more than 60 percent of students at this 2-year institution are part-time.

''Transfer origin'' characterizes the percentage of students who transfer to the institution, and only applies to four-year or higher institutions.&lt;ref name=UPTechnical /&gt;
*''Lower transfer-in (LTI)''—fewer than 20 percent of students transfer into the institution.
*''Higher transfer-in (HTI)''—more than 19 percent of students transfer into the institution.

==Size and setting==
''Size and Setting'' classifies institutions according to (a) size of their student body and (b) percentage of student who reside on campus. This does not apply to exclusively graduate and professional institutions and special-focus institutions.&lt;ref name=SSTechnical&gt;The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (2005). [http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/index.asp?key=797 Technical Details &gt; Size &amp; Setting].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Size===
The ''size'' of institutions is based on their ''full-time equivalent (FTE)'' enrollment. FTEs are calculated by adding the number of full-time students to one-third the number of part-time students.  Two-year colleges are classified using a different scale than four-year and higher institutions.&lt;ref name=SSTechnical /&gt;

*''Very small two-year (VS2)''—fewer than 500 FTEs attend this two-year institution.
*''Small two-year (S2)''—at least 500 but fewer than 2000 FTEs attend this two-year institution.
*''Medium two-year (M2)''—at least 2000 but fewer than 5000 FTEs attend this two-year institution.
*''Large two-year (L2)''—at least 5000 but fewer than 10000 FTEs attend this two-year institution.
*''Very large two-year (VL2)''—10000 or more FTEs attend this two-year institution.
*''Very small four-year (VS4)''—fewer than 1000 FTEs attend this four-year institution.
*''Small four-year (S4)''—at least 1000 but fewer than 3000 FTEs attend this four-year institution.
*''Medium four-year (M4)''—at least 3000 but fewer than 10000 FTEs attend this four-year institution.
*''Large four-year (L4)''—more than 10000 FTEs attend this four-year institution.

===Setting===
''Setting'' is based on the percentage of full-time undergraduates who live in institutionally-managed housing.&lt;ref name=SSTechnical /&gt; Two-year institutions are not classified by setting.&lt;ref name=SSFlowchart&gt;The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (2005). [http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/dynamic/downloads/file_1_373.pdf Size and Setting] classification flow chart.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Primarily nonresidential (NR)''—fewer than 25 percent of degree-seeking undergraduates or fewer than 50 percent enrolled full-time live on campus.&lt;ref name=SSTechnical /&gt;
*''Primarily residential (R): (a)''—at least 25 percent of degree-seeking undergraduates live on campus and (b) at least 50 percent but fewer than 80 percent attend full-time.
*''Highly residential (HR)''—at least half of degree-seeking undergraduates live on campus and at least 80 percent attend full-time.&lt;ref name=SSTechnical /&gt;

==2005 edition==
In contrast to previous classifications, the 2005 classification scheme provides a "...set of multiple, parallel classifications."&lt;ref name=MainWebsite&gt;The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (2005). [http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/ The Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822000000/http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/ |date=22 August 2008 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Alexander C. McCormick, Senior Scholar at The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching and director of the classifications project, "The five new classifications are organized around three central questions: 1) What is taught, 2) to whom, and 3) in what setting?"&lt;ref name=McCormickPerspective&gt;McCormick, Alexander C. (2005). [http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/perspectives/sub.asp?key=245&amp;subkey=882 A New Set of Lenses for Looking at Colleges and Universities], [http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/perspectives/index.asp?key=532 Carnegie Perspectives], November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the new classification categories, the previously used classification scheme ("Basic classification") has been revised.

The Carnegie Foundation is also developing one or more voluntary classification schemes that rely on data submitted by institutions.&lt;ref name=MainWebsite /&gt; The first focuses on outreach and community engagement, and the second on "...how institutions seek to analyze, understand, and improve undergraduate education."&lt;ref name=McCormickPerspective /&gt;

The Carnegie Foundation has no plans to issue printed editions of the classifications. Their [https://web.archive.org/web/20080822012422/http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/ website] has several tools that let researchers and administrators view classifications.&lt;ref name=PrintFAQ&gt;The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (2005). [http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/about/sub.asp?key=18&amp;subkey=405#13 Carnegie Classification FAQs: Will the classifications be available in print?].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revisions in the basic classification===
The "basic classification" is an update of the original classification scheme. In addition to changing names of some categories, the 2005 revision differs from previous editions in that it:&lt;ref name=BasicTechnical /&gt;

# Splits Associates colleges into subcategories. This is based on the work of Stephen Katsinas, Vincent Lacey, and David Hardy at the [[University of Alabama]] and is an update of work funded in the 1990s by the [[Ford Foundation]].
# Categorizes doctorate-granting institutions according to their level of research activity. This level is calculated using multiple measures, financial and otherwise.
# Simplifies the measurement of doctorate degrees awarded.
# Divides Master's colleges and universities into three categories based on the number of [[Master's degrees]] awarded.
# Deprecates "[[Liberal Arts]]" terminology.{{Request quotation|date=May 2014}}
# Modified the criteria separating Master's and Baccalaureate institutions. Institutions formerly classified as Master's Colleges and Universities are now classified as Baccalaureate Colleges.
# Requires institutions to have higher levels of single-field or related-field concentration for designation as special-focus institutions and utilizes more sources of information to identify special-focus institutions.
# Splits the "Schools of engineering and technology" category into two categories and eliminates the "Teacher's colleges" category.
# Measures and classifies service academies using to the same criteria as other institutions.

==Previous editions==
Prior to the 2000 edition, the Carnegie Foundation categorized doctorate-granting institutions according to the amount of [[Federal Government of the United States|federal]] funding they received.  The 2005 edition categorizes doctoral-institutions according to their research support but uses a more complex formula than used in previous editions.  Despite the fact that it is no longer used by the Carnegie Foundation, the descriptor ''[[Research I university|Research&amp;nbsp;I]]'' is still commonly used in reference to universities with the largest research budgets, often by the institutions themselves in their promotional materials.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9323">'''Cement chemist notation''' ('''CCN''') was developed to simplify the [[formula]]s [[cement]] chemists use on a daily basis. It is a shorthand way of writing the [[chemical formula]] of [[oxide]]s of [[calcium]], [[silicon]], and various [[metal]]s.

==Abbreviations of oxides==

The main oxides present in cement (or in glass and ceramics) are abbreviated in the following way:

{|class="wikitable"
!CCN!!Actual formula!!Name
|-
|C||CaO||[[Calcium oxide]], or [[Lime (material)|lime]]
|-
|S||SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;||[[Silicon dioxide]], or [[silica]]
|-
|A||Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;||[[Aluminium oxide]], or [[alumina]]
|-
|F||Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;||[[Iron oxide]], or [[rust]]
|-
|T||TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;||[[Titanium dioxide]], or titania
|-
|M||MgO||[[Magnesium oxide]], or [[periclase]]
|-
|K||K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O||[[Potassium oxide]]
|-
|N||Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O||[[Sodium oxide]]
|-
|H||H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O||[[Water]]
|-
|{{overline|C}}||CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;||[[Carbon dioxide]]
|-
|{{overline|S}}||SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;||[[Sulfur trioxide]]
|-
|P||P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;||[[Phosphorus pentoxide|Phosphorus hemi-pentoxide]]
|}

==Conversion of hydroxides in oxide and free water==
For the sake of mass balance calculations, hydroxides present in hydrated phases found in hardened cement paste, such as in [[portlandite]], Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, must first be converted into oxide and water.

To better understand the conversion process of hydroxide anions in oxide and water, it is necessary to consider the autoprotolysis of the [[hydroxyl]] anions; it implies a [[proton]] exchange between two OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, like in a classical [[acid-base reaction]]:

:{{underset|acid 1|OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;}} + {{underset|base 2|OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;}} → {{underset|base 1|O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;}} + {{underset|acid 2|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O}}
or also,
:2 OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

For [[portlandite]] this gives thus the following mass balance:

:Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CaO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Thus portlandite can be written as CaO · H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O or CH.

==Main phases in Portland cement before and after hydration==

These oxides are used to build more complex [[Compound (chemistry)|compounds]]. The main crystalline phases described hereafter are related respectively to the composition of: 
* Clinker and non-hydrated Portland cement, and; 
* Hardened cement pastes obtained after hydration and cement setting.

===Clinker and non-hydrated Portland cement===

Four main phases are present in the [[clinker (cement)|clinker]] and in the non-hydrated Portland [[cement]]. &lt;br /&gt;They are formed at high temperature (1,450&amp;nbsp;°C) in the [[cement kiln]] and are the following:

{|class="wikitable"
!CCN!!Actual formula!!Name!!Mineral phase
|-
|C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S||3 CaO · SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;||Tricalcium silicate||[[Alite]]
|-
|C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S||2 CaO · SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;||[[calcium silicate|Dicalcium silicate]]||[[Belite]]
|-
|C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;A||3 CaO · Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;||[[Tricalcium aluminate]]||[[Tricalcium aluminate|Aluminate]] or Celite
|-
|C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;AF||4 CaO · Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; · Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;||Tetracalcium alumino ferrite||[[Calcium Aluminoferrite|Ferrite]]
|}

The four compounds referred as C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;A and C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;AF are known as the main crystalline phases of Portland cement. The phase composition of a particular cement can be quantified through a complex set of calculation known as the [[Bogue formula]].

===Hydrated cement paste===

[[Hydration reaction|Hydration]] products formed in hardened cement pastes (also known as HCPs) are more complicated, because many of these products have nearly the same formula and some are solid solutions with overlapping formulas. Some examples are given below:

{|class="wikitable"
!CCN !! Actual formula !! Name or mineral phase
|-
|[[Portlandite|CH]]||Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or CaO · H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O||[[Calcium hydroxide]]
|-
||[[Calcium silicate hydrate|C-S-H]]||0.6–2.0 CaO · SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; · 0.9–2.5 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, with variable composition within this range, and often also incorporating partial substitution of Al for Si||[[Calcium silicate hydrate]]
|-
|[[Calcium Aluminate Hydrate|C-A-H]]||This is even more complex than C-S-H||Calcium aluminate hydrate
|-
|[[AFt phase|AFt]]||C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;A{{overline|S}}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;32&lt;/sub&gt;, sometimes with substitution of Fe for Al, and/or [[Carbonate|{{chem|CO|3|2-}}]] for [[Sulfate|{{chem|SO|4|2-}}]]||calcium trisulfoaluminate hydrate, or [[ettringite]]
|-
|[[AFm phase|AFm]]||C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;A{{overline|S}}H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, often with substitution of Fe for Al, and/or various other anions such as OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; or {{chem|CO|3|2-}} for {{chem|SO|4|2-}} ||Calcium monosulfoaluminate
|-
|[[Hydrogarnet|C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;AH&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]]||3CaO · Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;6&amp;nbsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O||[[Hydrogarnet]]
|}

The hyphens in C-S-H indicate a calcium silicate hydrate phase of variable composition, while 'CSH' would indicate a calcium silicate phase, CaH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Use in ceramics, glass, and oxide chemistry==
The cement chemist notation is not restricted to cement applications but is in fact a more general notation of oxide chemistry applicable to other domains than cement chemistry ''sensu stricto''.

For instance, in [[ceramic]]s applications, the [[kaolinite]] formula can also be written in terms of oxides, thus the corresponding formula for kaolinite, 
:Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;,

is
:Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; · 2 SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; · 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

or in CCN
:AS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Possible use of CCN in mineralogy==
Although not a very developed practice in mineralogy, some chemical reactions involving silicate and oxide in the melt or in hydrothermal systems, and silicate weathering processes could also be successfully described by applying the cement chemist notation to silicate mineralogy.

An example could be the formal comparison of [[Belite#Hydration|belite hydration]] and [[forsterite]] [[Serpentinite#Serpentinite_reactions|serpentinisation]] dealing both with the hydration of two structurally similar earth -alkaline silicates, Ca&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively.

;Calcium system: [[Belite#Hydration|belite hydration]]:
{{NumBlk|::
|{{overset|[[Belite]]|2 Ca&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}} + {{overset|water|4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O}} → {{overset|C-S-H phase|3 CaO · 2 SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; · 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O}} + {{overset|[[portlandite]]|Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}
|{{EquationRef|Reaction 4a}}}}
{{NumBlk|::
|2 C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S + 4 H → C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + CH
|{{EquationRef|Reaction 4b}}}}

;Magnesium system: [[forsterite]] [[Serpentinite#Serpentinite_reactions|serpentinisation]]:
{{NumBlk|::
|{{overset|Forsterite|2 Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}} + {{overset|water|3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O}} → {{overset|[[serpentinite|serpentine]] |Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}} + {{overset|[[brucite]]|Mg(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}
|{{EquationRef|Reaction 4c}}}}
{{NumBlk|::
|2 M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S + 3 H → M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + MH
|{{EquationRef|Reaction 4d}}}}

The ratio Ca/Si (C/S) and Mg/Si (M/S) decrease from 2 for the dicalcium and dimagnesium silicate reagents to 1.5 for the hydrated silicate products of the hydration reaction. In other term, the C-S-H or the serpentine are less rich in Ca and Mg respectively. This is why the reaction leads to the elimination of the excess of [[portlandite]] (Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[brucite]] (Mg(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), respectively,  out of the silicate system, giving rise to the crystallization of both hydroxides as separate phases.

The rapid reaction of [[belite]] hydration in the setting of [[cement]] is formally "chemically analogue" to the slow natural hydration of [[forsterite]] (the magnesium end-member of [[olivine]]) leading to the formation of [[serpentinite|serpentine]] and [[brucite]] in nature. However, the kinetic of hydration of poorly crystallized artificial belite is much swifter than the slow conversion/weathering of well crystallized Mg-[[olivine]] under natural conditions.

This comparison suggests that mineralogists could probably also benefit from the concise formalism of the cement chemist notation in their works.

{{essay-like|date=January 2015}}
'''Cheating''' is the receiving of a reward for ability or finding an easy way out of an unpleasant situation by dishonest means. It is generally used for the breaking of rules to gain unfair advantage in a competitive situation. This broad definition will necessarily include acts of bribery, [[cronyism]], [[nepotism]], sleaze and any situation where individuals are given preference using inappropriate criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csuh.iii.com/search~S0?/X(cheating+)&amp;SORT=D/X(cheating+)&amp;SORT=D&amp;SUBKEY=(cheating+)/1%2C63%2C63%2CB/frameset&amp;FF=X(cheating+)&amp;SORT=D&amp;8%2C8%2C |title=California State University, East Bay |publisher=Csuh.iii.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rules infringed may be explicit, or they may be from an unwritten code of conduct based on [[morality]], [[ethics]] or [[Convention (norm)|custom]], making the identification of cheating conduct a potentially subjective process. Cheating can refer specifically to [[infidelity]]. Someone who is known for cheating is referred to as a ''cheat'' in [[British English]], and a ''cheater'' in [[Comparison of American and British English|American English]]. A person described as a "cheat" doesn't necessarily cheat all the time, but rather, relies on deceiving tactics to the point of acquiring a reputation for it.

==Academic==
{{Main article|Academic dishonesty}}
[[File:Cheating.JPG|thumb|A small [[cheat sheet]] can be used to cheat during an academic examination.]]

[[Academic]] cheating is a significantly common occurrence in high schools and colleges in the United States. Statistically, 64% of public high school students admit to serious test cheating. 58% say they have [[plagiarized]]. 95% of students admit to some form of cheating. This includes tests, copying homework, and papers. Only 50% of private school students, however, admit to this. The report was made in June 2005 by [[Rutgers University]] professor Donald McCabe for The Center for Academic Integrity. The findings were corroborated in part by a [[Gallup survey]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.academicintegrity.org/icai/integrity-3.php&lt;/ref&gt; In McCabe's 2001 of 4500 high school students, "74% said they cheated on a test, 72% cheated on a written work, and 97% reported to at least had copied someone's homework or peeked at someone's test. 1/3 reported to have repeatedly cheated."&lt;ref&gt;The Case of the Purloined Paper by Brigid Schulte&lt;/ref&gt; The new revolution in high-tech digital info contributes enormously to the new wave in cheating: online term-paper mills sell formatted reports on practically any topic; services exist to prepare any kind of homework or take online tests for students, despite the fact that this phenomenon, and these websites, are well known to [[educator]]s &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiomatyc.org/web_documents/newsletter_fall_09.pdf |title=Ohiomatyc.org |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110202253/http://www.ohiomatyc.org/web_documents/newsletter_fall_09.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;; [[MP3]] players can hold digitalized notes; [[graphing calculators]] store formulas to solve math problems.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Reader's Digest]]'', pp. 123-7, March 2006; Cheating: "but everybody is doing it".&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chinese civil service examination|Chinese civil service examinations]], the main route to career success for literate men in imperial China, was bedeviled for centuries by rampant cheating and examiner-bribery, as detailed in books like the Ming-dynasty ''[https://cup.columbia.edu/book/the-book-of-swindles/9780231178631 Book of Swindles]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Type 20: Corruption in Education," in Zhang Yingyu, ''The Book of Swindles: Selections from a Late Ming Collection'', translated by Christopher Rea and Bruce Rusk (New York, NY: Columbia University Press, 2017), pp. 142-163.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sport, games and gambling ==

=== Sports ===
{{Main article|Unsportsmanlike conduct}}
Cheating in sports is the intentional breaking of rules in order to obtain an advantage over the other teams or players. Sports are governed by both customs and explicit rules regarding acts which are permitted and forbidden at the event and away from it. Forbidden acts frequently include performance-enhancing drug taking (known as "[[Doping in sport|doping]]"), using equipment that does not conform to the rules or altering the condition of equipment during play, and deliberate harassment or injury to competitors.

High-profile examples of alleged doping cheating include [[Lance Armstrong]]'s use of [[steroid]]s in professional [[cycling]] - particularly controversial as it is widely suspected that a high percentage of professional cyclists are using prohibited substances - [[Ben Johnson (sprinter)|Ben Johnson]]'s disqualification following the [[100 metres]] final at the [[1988 Summer Olympics]], and admissions of [[steroid]] use by former professional baseball players after they have retired, such as [[José Canseco]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2005-02-13-canseco-60minutes_x.htm |title=Canseco:Steroids made my baseball career possible |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=2005-02-17 |accessdate=2009-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ken Caminiti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/videoplus/news/2002/05/29/si_steroids_video_archive/ |title=Sports Illustrated:Steroids in baseball |publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=2002-06-23 |accessdate=2009-11-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226205128/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/videoplus/news/2002/05/29/si_steroids_video_archive/ |archivedate=2009-02-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A famous sporting scandal involving cheating via harassment and injury occurred in 1994 in [[figure skating]] when [[Tonya Harding]]'s ex-husband, Jeff Gillooly, and her bodyguard Shawn Eckhardt, hired Shane Stant to break [[Nancy Kerrigan]]'s leg to remove her from the year's competitions and prevent her from competing with Harding. One of the most famous instances of cheating involving a prohibited player action occurred during the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]] quarter-final, when [[Diego Maradona]] [[Hand of God goal|used his hand to punch the ball]] into the goal of [[England national football team|England]] [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] [[Peter Shilton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2005/writers/mark_bechtel/08/24/daily.blog/index.html |title=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=2005-08-24 |accessdate=2009-11-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814051451/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2005/writers/mark_bechtel/08/24/daily.blog/index.html |archivedate=2009-08-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the hand or arm by anyone other than a goalkeeper is illegal according to the rules of association football.

Illegally altering the condition of playing equipment is frequently seen in bat sports such as [[baseball]] and [[cricket]], which are heavily dependent on equipment condition. For example, in baseball, a [[pitcher]] using a [[Spitball|doctored baseball]] (e.g. putting [[graphite]] or [[Petroleum jelly|Vaseline]] on the baseball), or a [[batting (baseball)|batter]] using a [[corked bat]] are some examples of this. [[Tennis]] and [[golf]] are also no strangers to equipment cheating, with players being accused of using rackets of illegal string tension, or golf clubs of illegal weight, size, or make. Equipment cheating can also occur via the use of external aids in situations where equipment is prohibited - such as in [[American football]] via the use of [[stickum]] on the hands of receivers, making the ball easier to catch. An example of this is Hall of Famer Jerry Rice, who admitted to regularly &amp; illegally using "stickum" throughout his career, calling into question the integrity of his receiving records.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/25061154/jerry-rice-admitted-to-cheating-just-days-before-calling-pats-cheaters&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nj.com/giants/index.ssf/2015/02/whos_cheating_now_jerry_rice_admits_stickum_use_af.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/jerry-rice-calls-out--cheating--patriots-but-admitted-to-using-stickum-200324269.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Athletic cheating is a widespread problem. For example, in [[professional bodybuilding]], cheating is now estimated to be so universal that it is now considered impossible to engage in professional competition without cheating and the use of supposedly banned substances; bodybuilders who refuse to take banned substances now compete in [[natural bodybuilding]] leagues.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Cheating may also be seen in [[coaching]]. One of the most common forms of this is the use of [[bribery]] and [[Kickback (bribery)|kickbacks]] in the player recruitment process. {{citation needed|date=April 2018}}Such practices are widespread all across athletics, and are particularly visible in [[college sports]] recruitment. Another common form of cheating in coaching is profiteering in association with [[gambling|gamblers]] and [[match fixing]] (see also the section below on cheating in the gambling industry). The most famous coach of the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]] Runnin' Rebels basketball team, [[Jerry Tarkanian]], was accused of both recruitment fraud and gambling fraud over the course of his career and was the subject of intense [[NCAA]] scrutiny. Another form of this involves a team coach or other manager undertaking [[corporate espionage]] or another form of prohibited spying in order to obtain details about other teams' strategies and tactics. The [[2007 New England Patriots videotaping controversy]], in which the [[New England Patriots]] were found to have videotaped an opposing team from an unapproved location while trying to obtain defensive signals. As was the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] use of, at the time legal, performance enhancers. However, there was cheating proven by the [[Denver Broncos]] during their back to back titles in the late 90's to circumvent the league's salary cap and obtain and retain players that they would otherwise not have been able to. Circumvention of rules governing conduct and procedures of a sport can also be considered cheating. During the [[2007 Formula One Season]], driver [[Fernando Alonso]] was labelled a "cheat" for exchanging confidential information between the teams of [[Scuderia Ferrari]] and [[Mclaren]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/article293761.ece |title=Fernando is just a 'cheat' |publisher=thesun.co.uk |date=2007-09-15 |accessdate=2010-03-21 |location=London |first=Michael |last=Spearman |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114233444/http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/article293761.ece |archivedate=2012-01-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a form of [[collusion]]. 

An example of cheating via judging collusion occurred in the [[2002 Winter Olympics figure skating scandal]] when the Russian team was awarded a gold medal over the Canadian team in an alleged vote-swapping judging deal; the Canadian team's silver medals were eventually upgraded to gold at a second awards ceremony and the French judge was suspended for misconduct. The head of the French skating federation was later also suspended, and both were banned from the 2006 Olympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/1959181.stm | work=BBC News | title=Three-year Ban for Skating Judge | date=April 30, 2002 | accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Skating Union]] modified its [[ISU Judging System|judging system]] as a result of this case. 

Cheating is also used to refer to movements in [[strength training]] that transfer weight from an isolated or fatigued muscle group to a different or fresh muscle group. This allows the cheater to move an initial greater weight (if the cheating continues through an entire training set) or to continue exercising past the point of muscular exhaustion (if the cheating begins part way through the set). As strength training is not a sport, cheating has no rule-based consequences, but can result in injury or a failure to meet training goals. This is because each exercise is designed to target specific muscle groups and if the proper form is not used the weight can be transferred away from the targeted group.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

=== Video games ===
{{Main article|Cheating in video games}}
[[File:Action Replay Amiga500.jpg|thumb|The [[Action Replay]] card allows Amiga computer owners to cheat in videogames]]
In video games, cheating can take the form of secret access codes in single-player games (such as the [[Konami code]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/cheats/games/gradius-nes-6035|title=Gradius Cheats &amp; Codes|publisher=IGN|language=English|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) which unlock a bonus for the player when entered, [[hacking (computers)|hacks]] and exploits which give players an unfair advantage in online multiplayer games and single-player modes, or unfair [[collusion]] between players in online games (such as a player who spectates a match, removing limitations such as "[[fog of war]]", and reports on enemy positions to game partners).

Attitudes towards cheating vary. Using exploits in single-player modes is usually considered to be simply another form of exploring the game's content unless the player's accomplishments are to be submitted competitively, and is common in single-player games with a high difficulty level; however, cheating in multiplayer modes is considered immoral and harshly condemned by fair players and developers alike. On one hand, cheating allows casual players to complete games at much-accelerated speed, which can be helpful in some cinematic or one-player games, which can take a subjectively long time to finish, as is typical of the [[Role-Playing Game]] (RPG) genre. While this may be seen as a hasty advantage causing no damage to anyone, in a multi-player game such as [[MMORPG]]s the repercussions of cheating are much more damaging, breaking the risk/reward curve of the game and causing fair players to lose online matches and/or character development. Cheating in those types of games is generally prohibited - though often widespread anyway. In many circles, the purchasing of items or currency from sources outside the game is also considered to be cheating. The [[Terms of Service#Video games|Terms of Service]] from many games where this is possible, directly prohibits this activity. {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} One area where there is little consensus as of yet involves modern [[Free-to-play]] business models which support and are supported by the exchange of real-world money for in-game services, items, and advantages. Games that grant excessive advantages only available to paying customers may be criticized as being 'Pay to win'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2012/08/13/separating-free-to-play-and-pay-to-win |title=Separating Free-to-Play and Pay-To-Win |publisher=IGN.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; - sometimes considered a form of "cheating" that is actually legitimatized by the system - whilst games that limit real-money purchases to cosmetic changes are generally accepted as fair.

Another form of video game cheating is when a player does things to interact with game objects that are unforeseen by the programmers and break the intended function or reward system of the object. This can involve the way enemies are encountered, objectives met, items used, or any other game object that contains a [[software bug]]. One common example is the exploitation of errors in an enemy's [[pathfinding]]; if a player can cause an enemy to become "stuck" in a given terrain feature, that player can then usually dispatch the enemy from a distance without risk, even if much stronger, and achieve greater rewards than the player is intended to be able to at that level of progression. Another example was common in early [[first-person shooter]] games and involved skipping a weapon's reload timer by quickly switching weapons back and forth without actually reloading the weapons; resulting in what was effectively instant reloading. It also can be accomplished through means of altered game files are substituted for the normal files, or image graphics changed to permit greater visibility of the targets, etc. - for example, replacing the colors on a dark-colored enemy intended to blend in with the background with a bright color permitting instant visibility and targeting. Generally speaking, there is often some concern that this is not truly cheating, as it is the fault of the programmers that such an exploit exists in the first place. However, technically, as with live sports, it is cheating if the player is not playing the game in a formally approved manner, breaking unwritten rules. In some cases, this behavior is directly prohibited by the Terms of Service of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csuh.iii.com/record=b2293396~S0 |title=California State University, East Bay |publisher=Csuh.iii.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gambling ===
[[File:Georges de La Tour - Cheater with the Ace of Diamonds - WGA12334.jpg|thumb|''Cheater with the [[Ace of Diamonds]]'', by [[Georges de La Tour]]]]
{{see also|Cheating in casinos}}

The wagering of money on an event extends the motivation for cheating beyond directly participating competitors. As in sport and games, cheating in [[gambling]] is generally related to directly breaking rules or laws, or misrepresenting the event being wagered on, or interfering in the outcome.
A boxer who takes a dive, a [[casino]] which plays with secretly [[loaded dice]], a rigged [[roulette wheel]] or [[slot machine]], or a [[doctored deck of cards]], are generally regarded as cheating, because it has misrepresented the likelihood of the game's outcomes beyond what is reasonable to expect a bettor to protect himself against. However, for a bookmaker to flatter a horse in order to sell bets on it at shorter [[odds]] may be regarded as [[salesmanship]] rather than cheating, since bettors can counter this by informing themselves and by exercising [[skepticism]].
Doping a horse is a clear example of cheating by interfering with the instruments of the event under wager. Again, not all interference is cheating; spending money to support the health and well-being of a horse one has wagered on is not in itself generally regarded as cheating, nor is improving the morale of a sportsman one has backed by [[cheering]] for them. Generally, interference is more likely to be regarded as cheating if it diminishes the standard of a sporting competition, damages a participant, or modifies the apparatus of the event or game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csuh.iii.com/record=b2175166~S0 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130629123454/http://csuh.iii.com/record=b2175166~S0 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-06-29 |title=California State University, East Bay |publisher=Csuh.iii.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the world of gambling, knowing a secret which is not priced into the odds gives a significant advantage, which may give rise to a perception of cheating. However, legal systems do not regard secretly making use of knowledge in this way as criminal deception in itself. This is in contrast to the financial world, where people with certain categories of relationship to a company are restricted from transacting, which would constitute the crime of [[insider trading]]. This may be because of a stronger presumption of equality between investors, or it may be because a company employee who also trades in the company's stock has a conflict of interest, and has thus misrepresented himself the company.
An [[advantage play]]er typically uses mental, observational or technical skills to choose when and how much to bet, and neither interferes with the instruments of the game nor breaks any of its rules. Representatives of the [[casino]] industry have claimed that all [[advantage play]] is cheating, but this point of view is reflected neither among societies in general nor in legislation. As of 2010, the only example anywhere of a type of advantage play being unlawful is for an advantage player to use an auxiliary device in the U.S. State of [[Nevada]], whose legislation is uniquely influenced by large casino corporations. Nonetheless it remains a widely held principle that the law should not impose any restraint over the method by which a player arrives at a playing or betting decision from information held by him lawfully and which he is not debarred from under the rules of the game. In "hole carding", a casino player tries to catch sight of the front of cards which are dealt face-down according to the rules.
One way of cheating and profiting through gambling is to bet against yourself and then intentionally lose. This is known as [[match fixing|throwing a game or taking a dive]]. Illegal gamblers will at times pay sports players to lose so that they may profit from the otherwise unexpected loss. An especially notorious case is the [[Black Sox Scandal]], when eight players of the 1919 Chicago White Sox took payment from gamblers and intentionally played poorly. Another happened in [[boxing]] when [[Jake LaMotta]] famously took a dive against Billy Fox in order to obtain his entry to a championship match against [[Marcel Cerdan]], a deal offered by the mobsters who controlled professional boxing.

== Business ==

Various [[Trade regulation|regulation]]s exist to prevent unfair competitive advantages in business and finance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://definitions.uslegal.com/u/unfair-competitive-advantage-energy/|title=unfair-competitive-advantage-energy (law)}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example [[competition law]], or the prohibition of [[insider trading]].

The most extreme forms of cheating (e.g. attempting to gain money through outright deceit rather than providing a service) are referred to as [[fraud]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="70077">A '''citizen's arrest''' is an [[arrest]] made by a person who is not acting as a [[oath|sworn]] [[Police officer|law-enforcement official]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=va&amp;vol=1022703&amp;invol=1 |title=HUDSON v. COMMONWEALTH, Record No. 022703., September 12, 2003 - VA Supreme Court - FindLaw |publisher=FindLaw |year= 2009 |accessdate=20 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[common law]] jurisdictions, the practice dates back to medieval [[Kingdom of England|England]] and the [[English common law]], in which [[sheriff]]s encouraged ordinary [[Citizenship|citizen]]s to help apprehend [[criminal|law breakers]].

Despite the practice's name, in most countries, the arresting person is usually designated as a ''person'' with arrest powers, who need not be a ''citizen'' of the country in which they are acting. For example, in the [[United Kingdom|British]] jurisdiction of [[England and Wales]], the power comes from section 24A(2) of the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/60/section/24A |title=Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 |publisher=The National Archives, UK |date=16 Aug 2011 |accessdate=20 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; called "any person arrest". This [[legislation]] states "any person" has these powers, and does not state that they need to be a [[British nationality law|British citizen]].

==Legal and political aspects==
A person who makes a citizen's arrest could risk exposing him or herself to possible [[lawsuit]]s or [[criminal charge]]s &amp;ndash; such as charges of [[false imprisonment]], [[unlawful restraint]], [[kidnapping]], or [[wrongful arrest]] &amp;ndash; if the wrong person is apprehended or a suspect's [[civil rights]] are violated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=REGINA -V- SELF; CACD 25 FEB 1992|url=http://swarb.co.uk/regina-v-self-cacd-25-feb-1992/|website=SWARB.CO.UK|publisher=SWARB.CO.UK|accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially true when [[police force]]s are attempting to determine who an [[aggression|aggressor]] is. Private citizens don’t enjoy the same immunity from civil liability when making arrests on other private citizens as police officers.

The level of responsibility that a person performing a citizen's arrest may bear depends on the jurisdiction. For instance, in [[France]] and [[Germany]], a person stopping a criminal from committing a crime, including crimes against belongings, is not [[criminal responsibility|criminally responsible]] as long as the means employed are in proportion to the threat. Note, however, that in both countries, this results from a different legal norm, "aid to others in immediate danger", which is concerned with prevention, not [[prosecution]], of crimes.

==Laws by country==

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], the power to arrest is granted by both [[Government of Australia|federal]] and [[States and Territories of Australia|state]] legislation, however the exact power granted differs depending on jurisdiction. The power to arrest for a Federal offence is granted by s.3Z of the [[Crimes Act 1914|''Crimes Act'' 1914]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legislation.gov.au/ComLaw/Legislation/ActCompilation1.nsf/0/612E850EF1814DE9CA257344000972EE/$file/CrimesAct1914Vol1_WD02.pdf |title=ComLaw Home |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia |date=1 Oct 2012 |accessdate=20 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Act, a [[person (law)|person]] who is not a [[police constable]] may, without [[warrant (law)|warrant]], arrest another person if they believe on [[reasonable suspicion|reasonable grounds]] that:

*the other person is committing or has just committed an [[indictable offence]]; and
*proceedings by [[summons]] against the other person would not: ensure the appearance of the person before a court in respect of the offence; prevent a repetition or continuation of the offence or the commission of another offence; prevent the concealment, loss or destruction of evidence relating to the offence; prevent harassment of, or interference with, a person who may be required to give evidence in proceedings in respect of the offence; prevent the fabrication of evidence in respect of the offence; or would not preserve the safety or welfare of the person.

A person who arrests another person must, as soon as practicable after the arrest, arrange for the other person, and any property found on the other person, to be delivered into the custody of a constable.

====Victoria====
In the Australian state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], the power to arrest is granted in section 458 of the ''[[Crimes Act 1958]]'' (Vic).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/ca195882/ |title=Crimes Act 1958 |publisher=Australasian Legal Information Institute |date=20 Apr 2014 |accessdate=20 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It states that a person may, without a [[warrant (law)|warrant]], arrest a person that they find committing an offence for one or more of the following reasons:
*to ensure the appearance of the offender in court, and/or
*to preserve public order, and/or
*to prevent the continuation or repetition of the offence, or the commission of a further offence, and/or
*for the safety or welfare of the public or the offender

A person may also arrest another person if they are instructed to do so by a member of the police force, or if they believe on reasonable grounds that the offender is escaping legal custody.

Section 461 states that if an arrest is made under 458 of the Crimes Act, and is later proven to be false, then the arrest itself won't be considered unlawful if it was made on reasonable grounds. Section 462A allows any person the right to use force "not disproportionate to the objective as he believes on reasonable grounds to be necessary to prevent the commission, continuance or completion of an indictable offence or to effect or assist in effecting the lawful arrest of a person committing or suspected of committing any offence".

====New South Wales====
In the [[Australia]]n state of [[New South Wales]], the power to arrest is granted to anyone who is not a [[police officer]] by s.100 of the ''Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legalaid.nsw.gov.au/publications/factsheets-and-resources/police-powers |title=Police powers - Legal Aid NSW |publisher=NSW Government |date=15 Nov 2013 |accessdate=20 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; of New South Wales. Under the Act, a person may, without a [[warrant (law)|warrant]], arrest another person if:
*the person is in the act of committing an [[offence (law)|offence]] under any Act or statutory instrument, or
*the person has just committed any such offence, or
*the person has committed a serious indictable offence for which the person has not been [[trial|tried]].

Section 231 of the Act allows the use of such force as is "reasonably necessary to make the arrest or to prevent the escape of the person after arrest". A person who arrests another person under s.100 must, as soon as is reasonably practicable, take the person, and any [[personal property|property]] found on the person, before a [[magistrate]] to be dealt with according to law. The [[magistrate]] will also decide whether or not the force applied in making the arrest was reasonable under the circumstances.

According to the [[Law Society of New South Wales]], the arresting person should:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawsociety.com.au |title=Homepage - Law Society of NSW |publisher=The Law Society of New South Wales |year=2009 |accessdate=20 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*inform the person that they are under arrest and
*inform the person of the reasons for the arrest&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawsociety.com.au/community/publicationsandfaqs/legalquestions/Underarrest/025900 |title=Law Society of New South Wales - Under arrest? |publisher=Law Society of New South Wales |date=(?)2009 |accessdate=20 Apr 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220170852/http://www.lawsociety.com.au/community/publicationsandfaqs/legalquestions/Underarrest/025900 |archivedate=February 20, 2014 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Queensland====
In the [[Australia]]n state of [[Queensland]], the power to arrest is granted by s.546 of Schedule 1 to the ''Criminal Code Act 1899'' of Queensland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/LEGISLTN/CURRENT/C/CriminCode.pdf |title=Criminal Code Act 1899 - CriminCode.pdf |publisher=Government of Queensland, Australia |date=27 Nov 2013 |accessdate=20 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Act, any person who [[in flagrante delicto|finds another committing]] an [[offence (law)|offence]] may, without [[warrant (law)|warrant]], arrest the other person. The power to arrest in Queensland also allows for arrest on suspicion of an offence:
{{quote|If the offence has been actually committed--it is lawful for any person who believes on reasonable ground that another person has committed the offence to arrest that person without warrant, whether that other person has committed the offence or not.}}

s.260 of the Act also provides a power to arrest in preventing a [[breach of the peace]]:
{{quote|It is lawful for any person who witnesses a breach of the peace to interfere to prevent the continuance or renewal of it, and to use such force as is reasonably necessary for such prevention and is reasonably proportioned to the danger to be apprehended from such continuance or renewal, and to detain any person who is committing or who is about to join in or to renew the breach of the peace for such time as may be reasonably necessary in order to give the person into the custody of a police officer.}}

====South Australia====
The Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 (s271)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consol_act/clca1935262/s271.html |title=South Australia Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 Section 271 |publisher=Australasian Legal Information Institute |date=1 Jan 2014 |accessdate=20 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; grants arrest powers to a person in [[South Australia]].

{{quote|s271(3): A person is liable to arrest and detention under this section if the person is in the act of committing, or has just committed an indictable offence; or theft (whether the theft is a summary or indictable offence); or an offence against the person (whether the offence is summary or indictable); or an offence involving interference with, [[vandalism|damage]] to or destruction of property (whether the offence is summary or indictable).}}

====Tasmania====
Under the Police Offences Act 1935 ([[Tasmania]]), section 55(3), any person may arrest any other person whom they find committing an offence, where they have reasonable grounds to believe that the conduct will create or may involve substantial injury to another person, serious danger of such injury, loss of property or serious injury to property. Section 55(5) states "For the purposes of this section, a person is said to be 'found offending' if he does any act, or makes any omission, or conducts or behaves himself, and thereby causes a person who finds him reasonable grounds for believing that he has, in respect of such act, omission, or conduct, committed an offence against this Act." There are further provisions in section 301 of the Criminal Code Act 1924 (Tas) that appear to allow a sliding scale of force in executing an arrest.

====Western Australia====
It was only in 2004 that the [[Western Australia]]n parliament repealed the provisions of the former section 47 of the Police Act 1892 which allowed any person to arrest without a warrant "any reputed common [[prostitute]], [[thief]], loose, idle or [[disorderly conduct|disorderly person]], who, within view of such person apprehending, shall offend against this Act, and shall forthwith deliver him to any constable or police officer of the place where he shall have been apprehended, to be taken and conveyed before a Justice, to be dealt with according to law …" A private citizen would have found it rather difficult to interpret the terms "loose" or "idle" with any degree of [[legal certainty]]. WA now locates its citizen's arrest powers in section 25 of the Criminal Investigation Act (WA) 2006.

====The Territories====
;[[Northern Territory]]: Under section 441(2) of the Criminal Code of the Northern Territory, any person can arrest another whom he or she finds committing an offence or behaving such that he or she believes on reasonable grounds that the offender has committed an offence and that an arrest is necessary for a range of specified reasons.
;[[Australian Capital Territory]]: refer to the Crimes Act 1900 (ACT), section 218, which permits a citizen's arrest.

Generally speaking, as regards the law in Australia: where it is clear on the evidence that a private citizen, or [[security guard|security officer]], in detaining a suspect, acted reasonably and the suspect unreasonably, then it is likely that the court will find in favour of the citizen or security officer and against the suspect if that suspect chooses, later, to sue the citizen for assault or false imprisonment. In other circumstances where, e.g., a property owner (or an agent) arrests a thief in a manner, and in circumstances, disproportionate to the likely harm to the victim, and in clear defiance of the rights of the suspect (for example, to be taken forthwith to a police station), then the court is very likely to find in favour of the suspect (guilty or otherwise). The courts may order [[restitution|compensation]] for such suspects in appropriate circumstances.

===Brazil===
In [[Brazil]], a Federal law&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jusbrasil.com.br/legislacao/anotada/2341030/art-301-do-codigo-processo-penal-decreto-lei-3689-41 |title=Art. 301 do Código Processo Penal - Decreto Lei 3689/41 |language=pt |publisher=Jusbrasil.com.br |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; allows any person to arrest a suspect criminal found in flagrante delicto or fleeing from the crime scene. The person has to, at his/her own judgment, have the physical power to keep the suspect detained, has to verbally explain what he/she is doing to the arrestee and has to call the police. Both have to wait for the arrival of the police. The person who makes a citizen's arrest has to sign the police forms as a witness and explain the facts. Typically it will lead to a time burden of at least two hours. If the facts cannot be verified the person who realizes the citizen's arrest might be sued by the arrestee.

===Canada===

====Federal law====
[[Canada]]'s blanket arrest authorities for crimes or violations of federal statutes are found in the Criminal Code. In Canada, a criminal offence is any offence that is created by a [[Federal Government of Canada|federal]] statute—there are no provincial "crimes".

Criminal offences are divided into three groups: indictable, dual procedure, and summary conviction. For the purposes of arrest, dual procedure offences are considered to be indictable.

The Criminal Code provisions related to citizen arrests were changed in 2012, by the Citizen's Arrest and Self-defence Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/AnnualStatutes/2012_9/FullText.html |title=Citizen’s Arrest and Self-defence Act |publisher=Laws-lois.justice.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, it is now possible to make a citizen's arrest in Canada in circumstances where a "reasonable" amount of time has lapsed between the commission of a property-related offence and the arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/news-nouv/nr-cp/2013/doc_32865.html |title=Backgrounder: Citizen's Power of Arrest and Self-Defence and Defence of Property |publisher=Justice.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-10-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023060656/http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/news-nouv/nr-cp/2013/doc_32865.html |archivedate=2013-10-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Provincial law====
There are several arrest authorities found through the various provincial statutes. The most notable citizen's arrest authority in Ontario is found in the Trespass to Property Act, but there are others found in the Highway Traffic Act, the Liquor Licence Act, and many others.

{{poemquote|'''TRESPASS TO PROPERTY ACT'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_90t21_e.htm|title=Trespass to Property Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. T.21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denmark===
In [[Denmark]], pursuant to § 755 (2) of the Administration of Justice Act, anyone may arrest a suspect found at or in the immediate vicinity of a crime scene if the criminal act is subject to public prosecution. The arrestee must as soon as possible be turned over to the police with information about the time of and reasons for the arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=138875#Kap69 |title=Retsplejeloven - Bekendtgørelse af lov om rettens pleje (in Dansk/Danish)- English: Administration of Justice Act - Act on Administration of Justice- retsinformation.dk |publisher=retsinformation.dk |date=24 October 2012 |accessdate=20 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finland===
In [[Finland]], [http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/2011/20110806 Coercive Measures Act 22.7.2011/806] gives a right to apprehend someone in the act of committing a crime ''([[in flagrante delicto]])'' or fleeing from the crime scene, if punishment for the crime might be imprisonment or the crime is petty assault, petty theft, petty embezzlement, petty unauthorized use, petty stealing of a motor vehicle for temporary use, petty damage to property or petty fraud. A person wanted by the police (arrest warrant) can be apprehended by anyone. After the apprehension, the detainee must be handed over to the police as soon as possible. If the criminal is resisting or tries to escape, the law gives a citizen the right to use an amount of force considered necessary, when considering the nature of the crime, the behavior of the apprehended and the situation as a whole.

===France===
[[French law]] allows any person to arrest a person having been caught ''[[in flagrante delicto]]'' committing a crime punishable by a jail or prison term, and to conduct that person before the nearest officer of judiciary police &amp;ndash; in modern practice, one would rather call the police in after performing the arrest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?idArticle=LEGIARTI000006575113&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006071154&amp;dateTexte=20100705&amp;oldAction=rechCodeArticle Code of penal procedure (France), Article 73].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
Citizen's arrests can be made under §&amp;nbsp;127&amp;nbsp;Ⅰ&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;StPO (code of penal procedures) if the arrestee is caught ''[[in flagrante delicto]]'' and either the identity of the person cannot be otherwise established immediately or he/she is suspected to try to flee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bundesrecht.juris.de/englisch_stpo/englisch_stpo.html#p1053 §&amp;nbsp;127&amp;nbsp;StPO (code of penal procedures) (Germany)].&lt;/ref&gt; The person making the arrest is allowed to hold the arrestee solely for the purpose of turning him over to a proper legal authority such as the police. German law does not establish that the crime has to be serious, nor that the person making the arrest has to actually be a citizen of Germany.

===[[Hong Kong]]===
Citizen's arrest is known as the "101 power". Under the Criminal Procedure Ordinance (cap. 221 of the Laws of Hong Kong), section 101(2) provides that "Any person may arrest without warrant any person whom he may reasonably suspect of being guilty of an arrestable offence" using "force as is [[reasonable person|reasonable]] and proportionate in the circumstances" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201411/26/P201411260507.htm |title=Reply by the Secretary for Justice, Mr Rimsky Yuen, SC, in the Legislative Council|website=news.gov.hk}}.&lt;/ref&gt;. Once an arrest is made, the suspect must be delivered to a police office as soon as possible for court proceedings. "Arrestable offence" is defined as any crimes that can be sentenced for more than 12 months of jail time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.elegislation.gov.hk/hk/cap221/s101 Criminal Procedure Ordinance (Hong Kong), Chapter 221, Section 101].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hungary===
According to article 127, section 3 of ''Act XIX. of 1998 concerning Penal Procedure'', anyone may arrest a person caught committing a felony, but is obliged to hand the person over to the "investigative authorities" immediately; if this is not possible, the police must be informed.

===India===
Section 43, of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 states that:
{{Quotation|
#Any private person may arrest or cause to be arrested any person who in his presence commits a non-bailable and cognizable offence, or any proclaimed offender, and, without unnecessary delay, shall make over or cause to be made over any person so arrested to a police officer, or, in the absence of a police officer, take such person or cause him to be taken in custody to the nearest police station.
#If there is a reason to believe that such person comes under the [provisions of Sec 41, a police officer shall re-arrest him.
#If there is a reason to believe that he has committed a non-cognizable offence, and he refuses on the demand of the police officer to give his name and residence, or gives name or residence which such officer has a reason to believe to be false, he shall be dealt with under the provisions of Sec 42, but if there is no sufficient reason to believe that he has committed any offence he shall at once be released.}}

===Israel===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2011}}
{{wikisourcelang|he|חוק סדר הדין הפלילי (סמכויות אכיפה – מעצרים)}}
An [[Israel]]i law allowing anyone to arrest a suspect whom they witnessed carrying out a felony was repealed in 1996 and a new law now allows the detention of a suspect by another person under certain conditions. Section 75 of the Criminal Procedure Law (Enforcement Powers – Arrest) of 1996 allows anyone to detain a person who is witnessed carrying out certain suspected crimes. The crimes include the following: a felony, theft, a crime of violence and a crime which has caused serious damage to property. A person using these detention powers may use reasonable force if their request is not met as long as they do not cause the suspect bruising. They must hand the suspect over to the police immediately and no later than three hours. Persons whose identity is known or who are not suspected of fleeing may not be detained. The law, which is relatively new, is used by both private individuals and private security but is problematic because it has not yet been interpreted by the courts. In early 2009, a magistrate's court in Jerusalem handed down a verdict convicting two private security officers of assault following a detention of a suspect who assaulted one of them. The court ruled that the guards were not allowed to detain the suspect who was seated in a taxi at the time and should have waited for the police to arrive.

===Japan===
In [[Japan]], Section 213 of the Code of Criminal Procedure allows anyone (not only citizens) witnessing any crime in progress to make an arrest. This is called ''genkouhan'' (現行犯, meaning ''[[in flagrante delicto]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[[wikibooks:ja:刑事訴訟法第213条]]&lt;/ref&gt; Most criminals who attempt to flee, or refuse to identify themselves, can be held until police arrive.&lt;ref&gt;[[wikibooks:ja:刑事訴訟法第217条]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, making a citizen's arrest to prevent [[petty crime]] (e.g. illegal assembly, accidental injury, accidental trespass, defamation of character, leaving a parking lot without paying)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tanteisha.net/taiho.html |title=現行犯逮捕 |publisher=Tanteisha.net |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; is [[false imprisonment]] per Section 220 of the Criminal Code.&lt;ref&gt;[[wikibooks:ja:刑事訴訟法第220条]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latvia===
[http://likumi.lv/doc.php?id=107820#p-457809 Criminal Procedure Law] in [[Latvia]] gives a right to any person to apprehend someone in the act of committing a crime ''([[in flagrante delicto]])'' or fleeing from the crime scene, if punishment for the crime might be imprisonment. Also a person wanted by the police, for whom there is an arrest warrant, can be arrested by anyone at any time. A person stopping a criminal from committing a crime is not criminally responsible [http://likumi.lv/doc.php?id=88966&amp;version_date=01.01.2007#p-9227 as long as the means employed are in proportion to the threat].

Sub-section 5 further allows the arrest of a person who commits an offence on or with respect to the property of another by any person who is using the property to which the injury is done, or by the servant of either of those persons or by any person authorized by or acting in aid of either of those persons:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agc.gov.my/agc/oth/Akta/Vol.%2012/Act%20593.pdf Criminal Procedure Code (Act 593) &amp;sect; 27(5)]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 16 of the 1917 [[Constitution of Mexico]] allows any person to arrest a criminal found ''[[in flagrante delicto]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilstu.edu/class/hist263/docs/1917const.html Constitution of Mexico, Article 16] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070303014932/http://www.ilstu.edu/class/hist263/docs/1917const.html |date=March 3, 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; A non-police officer doing so must immediately call the police, because it is illegal to retain or transport any person against their will; failing to do so is illegal deprivation of liberty, a crime similar to kidnapping that can result in a prison sentence for the perpetrator. In 2006, the celebrity bounty hunter [[Duane Chapman|Duane 'Dog' Chapman]] was charged with unlawful deprivation of liberty for arresting an American fugitive in Mexico and attempting to take him across the border to California without consulting police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2006/09/19/duane-dog-chapman-says-feds-sold-him-out-to-mexico-in-exchange-for-drug-lord/ |title=Duane 'Dog' Chapman Says Feds Sold Him Out to Mexico in Exchange for Drug Lord |publisher=Fox News |date=2006-09-19 |accessdate=2014-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
In [[New Zealand]], some legal protection exists to those making a citizen's arrest as provided in the [[Crimes Act 1961]] in that there may be justification or protection from criminal responsibility. Justification of the arrest ensures the arresting person is not guilty of an offence and is not liable to any [[civil procedure|civil proceeding]]. Protection from criminal responsibility means those who make the arrest are not liable to any criminal proceedings. They are however liable for [[civil procedure|civil proceedings]]. The legislation is carefully worded and only applies to offences covered in the Crimes Act 1961, not other offences such as those covered in the [[Summary Offences Act 1981]].&lt;ref name="ns.org.nz"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ns.org.nz/index.html/Factsheets/CitizensArrestAndSelf-defence?action=pdf |title=Citizen's Arrest and Self-defence |accessdate=2010-10-08 | publisher = Neighbourhood Support New Zealand |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, the [[Crimes Act 1961]] states that everyone (not just New Zealand citizens) is justified in arresting without warrant:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1961/0043/latest/DLM328250.html?search=ts_act_crimes+act#DLM328250 Crimes Act 1961, Section 35 &amp; 36].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Any person found committing any offence against this Act which the maximum punishment is not less than 3 years' imprisonment; or
* Any person found at night (9pm till 6am) committing any offence against this Act.

Other situations where members of the public are protected from criminal responsibility when involved in arresting where:
* They have been asked by a police officer to help arrest any person believed or suspected to have committed any offence unless they know that there is no reasonable ground for the belief or suspicion.&lt;ref name="ns.org.nz"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1961/0043/latest/DLM328250.html?search=ts_act_crimes+act#DLM328250 Crimes Act 1961, Section 34].&lt;/ref&gt;
* They witness a breach of the peace, and therefore are justified in interfering to prevent its continuance or renewal, and may detain any person committing it, in order to hand them over to a police officer provided that the person interfering does not use more force than is reasonably necessary to prevent the continuance or renewal of the breach of the peace, or than is reasonably proportionate to the danger to be apprehended from its continuance or renewal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1961/0043/latest/DLM328261.html?search=ts_act_crimes+act#DLM328261 Crimes Act 1961, Section 42].&lt;/ref&gt; Similar legislation applies to suppressions of riots by members of the public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1961/0043/latest/DLM328262.html?search=ts_act_crimes+act#DLM328262 Crimes Act 1961, Section 43].&lt;/ref&gt;
* They believe, on reasonable and probable grounds, someone has committed an offence against the Crimes Act 1961 and is fleeing and is being pursued by any one they believe can arrest that person for the offence (such as a police officer). This applies whether or not the offence has in fact been committed, and whether or not the arrested person committed it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1961/0043/latest/DLM328253.html?search=ts_act_crimes+act#DLM328253 Crimes Act 1961, Section 38].&lt;/ref&gt;
* The person making the arrest is entitled to perform a search on the suspect, provided he/she is not working for the place of arrest (e.g. a security guard in a hospital).

In all cases a person making a citizens arrest must hand over the suspect to a police officer at the earliest possible time.

===Norway===
In [[Norway]], pursuant to § 176 of the Criminal Procedure Act any person may arrest a suspect caught at the scene or pursued from it. The arrestee must be handed over to the police immediately.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lovdata.no/all/tl-19810522-025-021.html#176].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philippines===
Although the [[Philippines]] does not have a national law covering citizen's arrest, the local government of [[Quezon City]] passed ''Ordinance 2307'' or the "Citizen's Arrest Ordinance of Quezon City". Any citizens within the Quezon City area can arrest a person even without a warrant in the instances mentioned and provided by law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJkEuaEQtW4|title=QC ordinance allows 'citizen's arrest'|first=|last=ABS-CBN News|date=1 November 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
In [[Sweden]], any person may arrest someone in the act of committing a crime, or fleeing from the crime scene, if the crime committed is punishable by imprisonment. A person wanted by the police, for whom there is an arrest warrant, can be arrested by anyone at any time. After the arrest, the police must be contacted as soon as possible.

===Taiwan===
An arrest without a warrant is explicitly forbidden by the Article 8 in the [[Constitution of the Republic of China]], "except in case of flagrante delicto as provided by law", as shown below:

{{poemquote|
'''The Code of Criminal Procedure'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.moj.gov.tw/Eng/LawClass/LawSearchNo.aspx?PC=C0010001&amp;DF=&amp;SNo=88].&lt;/ref&gt;
''Article 88: Arrest without a Warrant''
{{unbulleted list
|A person in flagrante delicto may be arrested without a warrant by any person.
|A person in flagrante delicto is a person who is discovered in the act of committing an offense or immediately thereafter.
|A person is considered to be in flagrante delicto under one of the following circumstances:
{{unbulleted list
|'''(1)''' One is pursued with cries that he is an offender;
|'''(2)''' One is found in possession of a weapon, stolen property, or other items sufficient to warrant a suspicion that he is an offender or his body, clothes and the like show traces of the commission of an offense sufficient to warrant such suspicion.
}}
}}
}}

However, the first additional circumstance, i.e. "pursued with cries" has been considered ambiguous in recent years, leading to many ongoing discussions and controversies of whether this would cause an infringement of the personal freedom.

===Turkey===

[[Turkey|Turkish]] Criminal Procedure Code states:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislationline.org/download/action/download/id/4257/file/Turkey_CPC_2009_en.pdf Turkish Criminal Procedure Code]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|
'''Article 90''' – (1) In the instances listed below, any individual is entitled to make an arrest of another person temporarily without a warrant:
{{unbulleted list
|a) If the other person was seen committing an offense,
|b) If the other person was under pursuit after committing an offense, if there is the possibility of escape of the person under pursuit after committing an offense or, if the establishment of his identity right away is not possible.}}
}}

===United Kingdom===

====England and Wales====
A citizen's arrest is permitted to be made on any person under section 24A of the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]] for an [[indictable offence]], including [[either way]] offences (in this section referred to simply as "an offence"), but excluding certain specific ones listed below; the Ministry of Justice publishes a list of indictable offences on its website.&lt;ref&gt;Indictable offences, summary offences, and TEW offences - court codes https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/217713/offence-classifications.xls&lt;/ref&gt;. A few examples of [[indictable]] and [[either-way]] offences are [[theft]], [[criminal damage]], [[burglary]], [[assault]] occasioning [[actual bodily harm]], possession of an [[offensive weapon]] in a public place, etc.
It is thus permissible for any person to arrest another without warrant&lt;ref&gt;https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/60/section/24A&lt;/ref&gt;:

*anyone who is in the act of committing an offence, or whom the arrestor has reasonable grounds for suspecting to be in the act of committing an offence, or
*where an offence has been committed, anyone who is guilty of that offence or whom the arrestor has reasonable grounds for suspecting to be guilty of it

In order for the citizen's arrest to be lawful, the following two conditions must also be satisfied:

*it appears to the person making the arrest that it is not reasonably practicable for a Constable to make the arrest instead;
*the arrestor has reasonable grounds for believing that the arrest is ''necessary'' to prevent one or more of the following:
**the person causing physical injury to himself or others;
**the person suffering physical injury;
**the person causing loss of or damage to property;
**the person absconding before a constable can assume responsibility for him

Use of the second power above ("where an offence has been committed") is more limited than the first as it relies upon the person carrying out the arrest ''knowing'' that an (indictable) offence ''has been'' committed. It is a common misconception that a member of the public needs to witness the offence before being able to act. Section 24 of this act therefore gives a Constable two key additional powers:

*Anyone who is (without doubt) about to commit an offence, or whom the Constable has reasonable grounds for suspecting to be about to commit an offence;
*Anyone whom the Constable has reasonable grounds for suspecting to be guilty of an offence which is merely ''suspected'' to have taken place

A Constable's arrest power is not limited to indictable offences, and a necessity test different from the above applies.

However, a citizen's arrest cannot be made:

A person cannot normally make a citizen's arrest before an offence takes place (excluding any indictable offence covered by the Criminal Attempts Act 1981), but they may prevent the commission of further offences at the time e.g. a person arrested to cease ''further'' criminal damage. However, Section 3 of the [[Criminal Law Act 1967]] allows any person to use [[reasonable force]] for the prevention of crime. This would not allow a citizen's arrest before an offence takes place in this sense but would allow any person to use reasonable force to prevent an offence from occurring; for example, restraining a suspected offender who raised a brick in their hand in order to imminently smash a window.

"Any person" powers can be used to arrest ''before'' an offence occurs as long as the offence in question falls within the [[Criminal Attempts Act 1981]]. This act creates the offence of an ''attempted'' offence, as long as the offence being attempted is an [[indictable]] one. For this to apply, the offence must actually be in the process of being attempted &amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;#32; preparatory steps are not sufficient. For example, putting gloves on to smash a car window would not suffice, but the throwing of a brick at the window would. The definition of what constitutes a "crime" was clarified in R v Jones (Margaret)[2005] QB 259&lt;ref&gt;https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldjudgmt/jd060329/jones-3.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
which stated under the S3 CLA1967 meaning, it was held to be any domestic crime in England/Wales. Kent Police have released a brief yet comprehensive [http://library.college.police.uk/docs/APPref/use-of-force-briefing.pdf guide] on reasonable force&lt;ref&gt;http://library.college.police.uk/docs/APPref/use-of-force-briefing.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

It should be noted that a citizen's arrest is a form of [[lawful custody]] and anyone attempting to flee may be guilty of attempting to [[escape from lawful custody]]. Furthermore, the offence of 'assault with intent to resist arrest or lawful apprehension or detainer of himself' may apply if the arrestee assaulted the arrestor under Section 38 of the [[Offences Against the Person Act 1861]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/24-25/100/section/38&lt;/ref&gt;. Both assault with intent to resist arrest/lawful apprehension and escaping from lawful custody are indictable, the former being so by the mode of trial of the offence, the latter is a [[common law]] offence and therefore [[indictable]] only. Therefore, these offences - whether fully carried out or merely attempted - are citizen's arrestable in themselves.

(See also - [[Criminal Attempts Act 1981]])

In addition to the above, a private person may be authorised to execute an [[arrest warrant]], if the [[court]] issuing the warrant has given them the authority to do so.

A citizen's arrest may also be made technically for a warrant for an arrest if the offence listed is indictable as there is no law prohibiting a re-citizen's arrest or the number of times they may be arrested for it nor is there a time limit. The warrant would satisfy the requirement for the arrester to have reasonable grounds to suspect the guilt of the arrestee. For example, if an offender failed to attend [[Crown court]] this would satisfy two conditions for a lawful citizen's arrest at a later date - that the offence ''had'' taken place and that it was obviously indictable by way of being tried in Crown court.

=====Other Powers=====

Although not technically citizen's arrest powers, any person also has the power to arrest for a [[common law]] [[breach of the peace]] which also provides any person with a [[power of entry]]. Section 3 [[Criminal Justice Act 1967]] provides any person the power to apprehend a person [[unlawfully at large]] e.g. an offender on a recall to prison or in the circumstances where someone has managed to [[escape from lawful custody]].

See also - [[Breach_of_the_peace#England,_Wales_and_Northern_Ireland|Breach of the peace (main article)]]

Any person may arrest an individual/individuals to prevent an occurring, repeated, or an about to occur [[breach of the peace]]. The breach of the peace power of arrest is provided by the [[common law]] and therefore an 'any person' power of arrest and entry both within the same definition &lt;ref&gt;https://www.scie.org.uk/care-act-2014/safeguarding-adults/adult-suspected-at-risk-of-neglect-abuse/law/pcea1984.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

This offence definition and power of arrest are contained under the [[common law]] definition of "breach of the peace". Section 17(5) of [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984|PACE 1984]] abolished all powers of a Constable to enter under the common law with the specific exception (subsection 6) when dealing with or preventing a common law breach of the peace.

Breach of the peace powers are unusual in the fact they originate from the laws [[Alfred the Great]] consolidated into the [[common law]] approximately 1,000 years before the modern Constable was thought up. The first legislative reference to the common law breach of the peace was under the [[Justice of the Peace Act 1361]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/aep/Edw3/34/1&lt;/ref&gt;. As a result, when a Constable uses their breach of the peace powers, they are acting 'any person' and not fully as a sworn officer in this capacity.

Until 2006, there was an "any person" power of arrest under part of the [[Theft Act 1968]] in England and Wales that related to [[poaching]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/60/schedule/1|title=Paragraph 2(4) of Schedule 1 to the Theft Act 1968|website=www.legislation.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was used by private [[water bailiff]]s (as opposed to [[Environment Agency]] bailiffs). This ceased to have effect as a result of a general repeal of such arrest powers by the [[Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/15/schedule/7/paragraph/38 Paragraph 38] of Schedule 7 to the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005; commenced by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/3495/article/2/made#article-2-1-m article 2(m)] of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 (Commencement No. 4 and Transitory Provision) Order 2005&lt;/ref&gt; An officer or agent of certain companies may seize and detain any person who has committed an offence against the provisions of the [http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/legResults.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;title=Companies+Clauses+Consolidation+Act+1845&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;activeTextDocId=1035033 Companies Clauses Consolidation Act 1845] whose name and residence shall be but unknown to such officer or agent, and take them before a [[justice of the peace]], who "shall proceed with all convenient dispatch to the hearing and determining of the complaint against such offender".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;title=Companies+Clauses+Consolidation+Act+1845&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=1035033&amp;ActiveTextDocId=1035211&amp;filesize=772 |title=Companies Clauses Consolidation Act 1845 (c.16) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Parliamentary procedure|Standing Orders]] of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]], the [[Serjeant at Arms of the British House of Commons|Serjeant at Arms]] has the power to take into custody any member of the public who is in a Members-only area of the House, or who misconducts themselves, or who fails to leave when the House sits in private.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmstords/539/539.pdf|title=Standing Order 161 of the House of Commons|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scotland====
While no statutory provision for citizen's arrest exists in [[Scots law]], there is a [[common law]] position that anyone committing an offence can be arrested using minimum force if necessary with consideration to what is reasonable in the relevant circumstances. The offence must be a serious one and not merely for a breach of the peace. The person exercising the power must have witnessed the offence occurring therefore they cannot act upon information from another person. An arrest is applicable reliant on situation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200001/cmselect/cmarmed/154/1013004.htm House of Commons - Armed Forces - Minutes of Evidence&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1995/oct/18/citizens-arrest Citizen's Arrest (Hansard, 18 October 1995)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt;

Most states have codified the common law rule that a warrantless arrest may be made by a private person for a felony, misdemeanor or "breach of peace".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Daily, JD|first=James|title=Superheroes and Citizen's Arrest|url=http://lawandthemultiverse.com/2011/03/07/superheroes-and-citizens-arrest/|work=Law and the Multiverse}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Breach of peace" covers a multitude of violations in which the Supreme Court has even included a misdemeanor seatbelt violation punishable only by a
fine. The term historically included theft, "nightwalking", prostitution and playing card and dice games.&lt;ref name="Supreme Court of the United States"&gt;{{cite web|title=Atwater v. Lago Vista (No. 99-1408)|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/99-1408|publisher=Supreme Court of the United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====State statutes====
California Penal Code section 837 is a good example of this codification:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
837. A private person may arrest another:
# For a public offense committed or attempted in his/her presence.
# When the person arrested has committed a felony, although not in his presence.
# When a felony has been in fact committed, and he or she has reasonable cause for believing the person arrested to have committed it.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"Public offense" is read similarly as breach of peace in this case and includes felonies, misdemeanors and infractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=California Penal Code Section 16|url=http://law.onecle.com/california/penal/16.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=People v. Landis|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/ca-superior-court/1050756.html|publisher=Appellate Division, Superior Court,Orange County.|quote="Public offenses" include infractions.  (Pen.Code § 16; People v. Tennessee (1970) 4 Cal.App.3d 788, 791, 84 Cal.Rptr. 697.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that there is generally no provision for an investigative detention by a private person under the law. With certain exceptions (see below) an arrest must be made. "Holding them until the police get there", is simply a form of arrest. The officer is accepting the arrest and processing the prisoner on behalf of the private person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Citizens' Arrest |url=http://le.alcoda.org/publications/point_of_view/files/Citizen.pdf |publisher=Alameda County District Attorney's Office }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of felonies, a private person may make an arrest for a felony occurring outside their presence but the rule is that a felony must have, in fact, been committed. For example, imagine a suspect has been seen on surveillance video vandalizing a building to the extent that the arrestor believes it rises to a felony due to the damage. If they find the suspect and make the arrest but it later turns out that it was misdemeanor damage, the arrestor is liable for [[false arrest]] because a felony had not, in fact, been committed.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Because most states have codified their arrest laws, there are many variations. For example, in Pennsylvania, the
courts have been clear that a citizen cannot make an arrest for a "summary offense".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Legg |first=Jason |title=From the Desk of the DA |url=http://www.susquehannacounty-da.org/PDF/pdf2008/16may08.pdf |work=Susquehanna County Office of the District Attorney |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903083247/http://www.susquehannacounty-da.org/PDF/pdf2008/16may08.pdf |archivedate=2014-09-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In North Carolina, there is no de jure "citizens' arrest". Although it is essentially the same, North Carolina law refers to it as a "detention".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Detention of offenders by private persons. |url=http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/HTML/BySection/Chapter_15A/GS_15A-404.html |work=North Carolina General Statutes |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115092943/http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/HTML/BySection/Chapter_15A/GS_15A-404.html |archivedate=2012-11-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other states seem to allow only arrests in cases of felonies but court decisions have ruled more broadly. For example in Virginia, the statute appears to only permit warrantless arrests by officers listed in the Code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=§19.2-81 Arrest Without a Warrant|url=http://law.justia.com/codes/virginia/2006/toc1902000/19.2-81.html|work=Code of Virginia}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Virginia courts have upheld warrantless arrests by citizens for misdemeanors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Edward Thomas WILSON v. COMMONWEALTH of Virginia|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/va-court-of-appeals/1175015.html|publisher=Court of Appeals of Virginia, Richmond.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Use of force====
In general, a private person is justified in using non-deadly force upon another if they reasonably believe that: (1) such other person is committing a felony, or a misdemeanor amounting to a breach of the peace; and (2) the force used is necessary to prevent further commission of the offense and to apprehend the offender. The force must be reasonable under the circumstances to restrain the individual arrested. This includes the nature of the offense and the amount of force required to overcome resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Use of Force for Law Enforcement Purposes|url=http://www.lexisnexis.cfom/lawschool/study/outlines/html/crim/crim11.htm|work=Criminal Law Capsule Summary|publisher=LexisNexis}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Flynn|first=Michael W.|title=Citizen's Arrest |url=http://legallad.quickanddirtytips.com/citizens-arrest-2.aspx|work=Legal Lad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Shopkeeper's (merchant's) privilege ====
In some states of the United States, the courts recognize a common law [[shopkeeper's privilege]], under which a shopkeeper is allowed to detain a suspected [[shoplifting|shoplifter]] on store property for a reasonable period of time, so long as the shopkeeper has cause to believe that the person detained in fact committed, or attempted to commit, theft of store property. The purpose of this detention is to recover the property and make an arrest if the merchant desires.&lt;ref&gt;W. Page, Keeton et al., ''Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts'' § 22, at 142 (5th ed. 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Differing liability from police ====
Private persons are occasionally granted immunity from civil or criminal liability, like the police are, when arresting others.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/ByArticle/Chapter_15A/Article_20.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; While the powers to arrest are similar, police are entitled to mistake of fact in most cases, while citizens can be held to a stricter liability depending on the individual state. Police can also detain anyone upon reasonable suspicion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Terry v. Ohio (392 U.S. 1 (1968)) |url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/392/1/case.html |publisher=Supreme Court of the United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ordinary citizens cannot claim "qualified immunity" to attempt to defend against a civil complaint for false arrest.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/qualified_immunity&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[physics]], a '''conservation law''' states that a particular measurable property of an isolated [[physical system]] does not change as the system evolves over time. Exact conservation laws include [[conservation of energy]], [[conservation of linear momentum]], [[conservation of angular momentum]], and [[conservation of electric charge]]. There are also many approximate conservation laws, which apply to such quantities as [[conservation of mass|mass]], [[Parity (physics)|parity]], [[lepton number]], [[baryon number]], [[strangeness]], [[hypercharge]], etc.  These quantities are conserved in certain classes of physics processes, but not in all.

A local conservation law is usually expressed mathematically as a [[continuity equation]], a [[partial differential equation]] which gives a relation between the amount of the quantity and the "transport" of that quantity.    It states that the amount of the conserved quantity at a point or within a volume can only change by the amount of the quantity which flows in or out of the volume.

From [[Noether's theorem]], each conservation law is associated with a [[symmetry (physics)|symmetry]] in the underlying physics.

==Conservation laws as fundamental laws of nature==

Conservation laws are fundamental to our understanding of the physical world, in that they describe which processes can or cannot occur in nature.  For example, the conservation law of energy states that the total quantity of energy in an isolated system does not change, though it may change form.  In general, the total quantity of the property governed by that law remains unchanged during physical processes.  With respect to classical physics, conservation laws include conservation of energy, mass (or matter), linear momentum, angular momentum, and electric charge.  With respect to particle physics, particles cannot be created or destroyed except in pairs, where one is ordinary and the other is an antiparticle.  With respect to symmetries and invariance principles, three special conservation laws have been described, associated with inversion or reversal of space, time, and charge.

Conservation laws are considered to be fundamental laws of nature, with broad application in physics, as well as in other fields such as chemistry, biology, geology, and engineering.

Most conservation laws are exact, or absolute, in the sense that they apply to all possible processes.  Some conservation laws are partial, in that they hold for some processes but not for others.

One particularly important result concerning conservation laws is [[Noether's theorem]], which states that there is a one-to-one correspondence between each one of them and a differentiable [[symmetry (physics)|symmetry]] of nature.  For example, the conservation of energy follows from the time-invariance of physical systems, and the conservation of angular momentum arises from the fact that physical systems behave the same regardless of how they are oriented in space.

==Approximate laws==

There are also '''approximate''' conservation laws.  These are approximately true in particular situations, such as low speeds, short time scales, or certain interactions.

* [[Conservation of mass|Conservation of rest mass]]
* Conservation of [[baryon number]] (See [[chiral anomaly]] and [[sphaleron]])
* Conservation of [[lepton number]] (In the [[Standard Model]])
* Conservation of [[flavor (particle physics)|flavor]] (violated by the [[weak interaction]])
* Conservation of [[parity (physics)|parity]]
* Invariance under [[charge conjugation]]
* Invariance under [[T-symmetry|time reversal]]
* [[CP symmetry]], the combination of charge and parity conjugation (equivalent to time reversal if CPT holds)

==Global and local conservation laws==
The total amount of some conserved quantity in the universe could remain unchanged if an equal amount were to appear at one point ''A'' and simultaneously disappear from another separate point ''B''.  For example, an amount of energy could appear on Earth without changing the total amount in the Universe if the same amount of energy were to disappear from a remote region of the Universe.  This weak form of "global" conservation is really not a conservation law because it is not [[Lorentz invariant]], so phenomena like the above do not occur in nature.&lt;ref name="Aitchison"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to [[Special Relativity]], if the appearance of the energy at ''A'' and disappearance of the energy at ''B'' are simultaneous in one [[inertial reference frame]], they will not be simultaneous in other inertial reference frames moving with respect to the first.  In a moving frame one will occur before the other; either the energy at ''A'' will appear ''before'' or ''after'' the energy at ''B'' disappears.  In both cases, during the interval energy will not be conserved.  

A stronger form of conservation law requires that, for the amount of a conserved quantity at a point to change, there must be a flow, or ''flux'' of the quantity into or out of the point.  For example, the amount of [[electric charge]] in a volume is never found to change without an [[electric current]] into or out of the volume that carries the difference in charge.  Since it only involves continuous ''[[principle of locality|local]]'' changes, this stronger type of conservation law is [[Lorentz invariant]]; a quantity conserved in one reference frame is conserved in all moving reference frames.&lt;ref name="Aitchison" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Will"/&gt;  This is called a ''local conservation'' law.&lt;ref name="Aitchison" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Will"/&gt;  Local conservation also implies global conservation; that the total amount of the conserved quantity in the Universe remains constant.  All of the conservation laws listed above are local conservation laws. A local conservation law is expressed mathematically by a ''[[continuity equation]]'', which states that the change in the quantity in a volume is equal to the total net  "flux" of the quantity through the surface of the volume.  The following sections discuss continuity equations in general.

==Differential forms==
{{see also|conservation form|continuity equation}}
In continuum mechanics, the most general form of an exact conservation law is given by a [[continuity equation]]. For example, conservation of electric charge ''q'' is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} = - \nabla \cdot \mathbf{j} \,&lt;/math&gt;

where ∇⋅ is the [[divergence]] operator, ''ρ'' is the density of ''q'' (amount per unit volume), '''j''' is the flux of ''q'' (amount crossing a unit area in unit time), and ''t'' is time.

If we assume that the motion '''u''' of the charge is a continuous function of position and time, then
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{j} = \rho \mathbf{u} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} = - \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{u}) \,.&lt;/math&gt;

In one space dimension this can be put into the form of a homogeneous first-order [[nonlinear partial differential equation|quasilinear]] [[hyperbolic equation]]:&lt;ref name="To24"&gt;see Toro, p.43&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; y_t + A(y) y_x = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where the dependent variable ''y'' is called the ''density'' of a ''conserved quantity'', and ''A(y)'' is called the ''[[current jacobian]]'', and the [[Notation for differentiation#Partial derivatives|subscript notation for partial derivatives]] has been employed. The more general inhomogeneous case:

:&lt;math&gt; y_t + A(y) y_x = s &lt;/math&gt;

is not a conservation equation but the general kind of [[balance equation]] describing a [[dissipative system]]. The dependent variable ''y'' is called a ''nonconserved quantity'', and the inhomogeneous term ''s(y,x,t)'' is the-''[[Divergence|source]]'', or [[dissipation]]. For example, balance equations of this kind are the momentum and energy [[Navier-Stokes equations]], or the [[entropy#Entropy balance equation for open systems|entropy balance]] for a general [[isolated system]].

In the '''one-dimensional space''' a conservation equation is a first-order [[nonlinear partial differential equation|quasilinear]] [[hyperbolic equation]] that can be put into the ''advection'' form:

:&lt;math&gt; y_t + a(y) y_x = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where the dependent variable ''y(x,t)'' is called the density of the ''conserved'' (scalar) quantity (c.q.(d.) = conserved quantity (density)), and ''a(y)'' is called the '''current coefficient''', usually corresponding to the [[partial derivative]] in the conserved quantity of a [[current density]] (c.d.) of the conserved quantity ''j(y)'':&lt;ref name="To24" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; a(y) = j_y (y)&lt;/math&gt;

In this case since the [[chain rule]] applies:

:&lt;math&gt; j_x= j_y (y) y_x = a(y) y_x &lt;/math&gt;

the conservation equation can be put into the current density form:

:&lt;math&gt; y_t + j_x (y)= 0 &lt;/math&gt;

In a '''space with more than one dimension''' the former definition can be extended to an equation that can be put into the form:

:&lt;math&gt; y_t + \mathbf a(y) \cdot \nabla y = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where the ''conserved quantity'' is ''y('''r''',t)'', ''&lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt;'' denotes the [[scalar product]], ''&amp;nabla;'' is the [[nabla symbol|nabla]] operator, here indicating a [[gradient]], and ''a(y)'' is a vector of current coefficients, analogously corresponding to the [[divergence]] of a vector c.d. associated to the c.q. '''j'''(y):

:&lt;math&gt; y_t + \nabla \cdot \mathbf  j(y) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

This is the case for the [[continuity equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \rho_t + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf u) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Here the conserved quantity is the [[mass]], with [[density]] ''&amp;rho;''('''r''',t) and current density  ''&amp;rho;'''''u''', identical to the [[momentum conservation|momentum density]], while '''u'''('''r''',t) is the [[flow velocity]].

In the '''general case''' a conservation equation can be also a system of this kind of equations (a [[vector equation]]) in the form:&lt;ref name="To24" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf y_t + \mathbf A(\mathbf y) \cdot \nabla \mathbf y = \mathbf 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where '''y''' is called the ''conserved'' ('''vector''') quantity, &amp;nabla; y is its [[gradient]], '''0''' is the [[zero vector]], and '''A(y)''' is called the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] of the current density. In fact as in the former scalar case, also in the vector case '''A(y)''' usually corresponding to the Jacobian of a [[current density matrix]] '''J(y)''':

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf A( \mathbf y) = \mathbf J_{\mathbf y} (\mathbf y)&lt;/math&gt;

and the conservation equation can be put into the form:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf y_t + \nabla \cdot \mathbf J (\mathbf y)= \mathbf 0 &lt;/math&gt;

For example, this the case for Euler equations (fluid dynamics). In the simple incompressible case they are:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\nabla\cdot \mathbf u=0\\[1.2ex]
{\partial \mathbf u \over\partial t}+ \mathbf u \cdot
\nabla \mathbf u + \nabla s =\mathbf{0},
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where:
*'''''u''''' is the [[flow velocity]] [[Vector (geometric)|vector]], with components in a N-dimensional space ''u&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''u&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' ... ''u&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;'',
*''s'' is the specific [[pressure]] (pressure per unit [[density]]) giving the [[Linear differential equation|source term]],

{{see also|Euler equations (fluid dynamics)}}

It can be shown that the conserved (vector) quantity and the c.d. matrix for these equations are respectively:

:&lt;math&gt;
{\mathbf y}=\begin{pmatrix}1 \\  \mathbf u \end{pmatrix}; \qquad
{\mathbf J}=\begin{pmatrix}\mathbf u\\ \mathbf u \otimes \mathbf u + s \mathbf I\end{pmatrix};\qquad
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''&lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt;'' denotes the [[outer product]].

==Integral and weak forms==
Conservation equations can be also expressed in integral form: the advantage of the latter is substantially that it requires less smoothness of the solution, which paves the way to [[weak formulation|weak form]], extending the class of admissible solutions to include discontinuous solutions.&lt;ref name="ToroInt"&gt;see Toro, p.62-63&lt;/ref&gt; By integrating in any space-time domain the current density form in 1-D space:

:&lt;math&gt; y_t + j_x (y)= 0 &lt;/math&gt;

and by using [[Green's theorem]], the integral form is:

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{- \infty}^\infty y \, dx + \int_0^\infty j (y) \, dt = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

In a similar fashion, for the scalar multidimensional space, the integral form is:

:&lt;math&gt; \oint [y \, d^N r + j (y) \, dt] = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where the line integration is performed along the boundary of the domain, in an anticlock-wise manner.&lt;ref name="ToroInt" /&gt;

Moreover, by defining a [[test function]] ''&amp;phi;''('''r''',''t'') continuously differentiable both in time and space with compact support, the [[weak formulation|weak form]] can be obtained pivoting on the [[initial condition]]. In 1-D space it is:

: &lt;math&gt; \int_0^\infty \int_{-\infty}^\infty \phi_t y + \phi_x j(y) \,dx \,dt = - \int_{-\infty}^\infty \phi(x,0) y(x,0) \, dx &lt;/math&gt;

Note that in the weak form all the partial derivatives of the density and current density have been passed on to the test function, which with the former hypothesis is sufficiently smooth to admit these derivatives.&lt;ref name="ToroInt" /&gt;

{{Anti-consumerism |Theories}}
[[Advertising]] is a form of [[communication]] intended to [[persuade]] an audience to purchase products, ideals or services. While advertising can be seen as necessary for [[economic growth]], it is not without [[social cost]]s. [[E-mail spam|Unsolicited commercial email]] and other forms of [[Spam (electronic)|spam]] have become so prevalent that they are a major nuisance to internet users, as well as being a financial burden on [[internet service provider]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://interviews.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/03/03/1528247&amp;tid=111 |title=Slashdot &amp;#124; ISP Operator Barry Shein Answers Spam Questions |publisher=interviews.slashdot.org |date=2003-03-03 |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advertising increasingly invades public spaces, such as schools, which some critics argue is a form of child exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/parents/marketing/marketers_target_kids.cfm |title=How Marketers Target Kids |publisher=Media-awareness.ca |date=2009-02-13 |accessdate=2009-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416200521/http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/parents/marketing/marketers_target_kids.cfm |archivedate=2009-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Advertising frequently uses psychological pressure (for example, appealing to feelings of inadequacy) on the intended consumer, which may be harmful. As a result of these criticisms, the advertising industry has seen low approval rates in surveys and negative cultural portrayals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=Andrew C.|last2=Dromi|first2=Shai M.|title=Advertising morality: maintaining moral worth in a stigmatized profession|journal=Theory &amp; Society|volume=47|issue=2|pages=175–206|doi=10.1007/s11186-018-9309-7|url=https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1007/s11186-018-9309-7?author_access_token=7NqWYsAc_xBowppAv-q8mve4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY6AEWVv2PLqubmhfuYTCeD-V3SRQ6CfZmxJResEGYJBsoZEDraaO2K-ltnWj2TVPmZ7jDY7bNZ5z2Kbuu8SoXhAHCzJkdSEdHAdS5s0BzfR6w%3D%3D|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Criticism of advertising''' is closely linked with [[media criticism|criticism of media]] and often interchangeable. Critics can refer to advertising's
* audio-visual aspects (cluttering of [[public space]]s and airwaves)
* environmental aspects ([[pollution]], oversize packaging, increasing consumption)
* political aspects ([[media dependency]], [[free speech]], [[censorship]])
* financial aspects (costs)
* ethical/moral/social aspects (sub-conscious influencing, invasion of privacy, increasing consumption and waste, target groups, certain products, honesty)

==Hyper-commercialism==

As advertising has become prevalent in modern society, it is increasingly being criticized. Advertising occupies public space and more and more invades the private sphere of people. According to Georg Franck, "It is becoming harder to escape from advertising and the media. Public space is increasingly turning into a gigantic billboard for products of all kind. The aesthetical and political consequences cannot yet be foreseen."&lt;ref name="aufmerksamkeit1998"/&gt; Hanno Rauterberg in the German newspaper ''Die Zeit'' calls advertising a new kind of dictatorship that cannot be escaped.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|author=Die Zeit, Hamburg, Germany |url=http://www.zeit.de/2008/47/Vermuellung |title=Öffentlichkeit: Werbekampagnen vereinnahmen den öffentlichen Raum &amp;#124; Kultur &amp;#124; Nachrichten auf ZEIT ONLINE |language=de |publisher=Zeit.de |date=2008-11-13 |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ad creep]] says, "There are ads in schools, airport lounges, doctors offices, movie theaters, hospitals, gas stations, elevators, convenience stores, on the Internet, on fruit, on ATMs, on garbage cans and countless other places. There are ads on beach sand and restroom walls."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commercialalert.org/issues/culture/ad-creep |title=Ad Creep — Commercial Alert |publisher=Commercialalert.org |date= |accessdate=2009-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114142712/http://www.commercialalert.org/issues/culture/ad-creep |archivedate=2012-11-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; "One of the ironies of advertising in our times is that as [[commercialism]] increases, it makes it that much more difficult for any particular advertiser to succeed, hence pushing the advertiser to even greater efforts."&lt;ref&gt;McChesney, Robert W. "The Political Economy of Media: Enduring Issues, Emerging Dilemmas". Monthly Review Press, New York, (May 1, 2008), p. 266, {{ISBN|978-1-58367-161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a decade advertising in radios climbed to nearly 18 or 19 minutes per hour, on prime-time television the standard until 1982 was no more than 9.5 minutes of advertising per hour, today it is between 14 and 17 minutes. With the introduction of the shorter 15-second-spot the total amount of ads increased even more. Ads are not only placed in breaks but also into sports telecasts during the game itself. They flood the Internet, a growing market.

Other growing markets are [[product placement]]s in entertainment programming and movies where it has become standard practice and virtual advertising where products get placed retroactively into rerun shows. Product billboards are virtually inserted into Major League Baseball broadcasts and in the same manner, virtual street banners or logos are projected on an entry canopy or sidewalks, for example during the arrival of celebrities at the 2001 [[Grammy Awards]]. Advertising precedes the showing of films at cinemas including lavish 'film shorts' produced by companies such as Microsoft or DaimlerChrysler. "The largest advertising agencies have begun working to co-produce programming in conjunction with the largest media firms",&lt;ref&gt;McChesney, Robert W. "The Political Economy of Media: Enduring Issues, Emerging Dilemmas". Monthly Review Press, New York, (May 1, 2008), p. 272, {{ISBN|978-1-58367-161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; creating Infomercials resembling entertainment programming.

Opponents equate the growing amount of advertising with a "[[Tsunami|tidal wave]]" and restrictions with "damming" the flood. [[Kalle Lasn]], one of the most outspoken critics of advertising, considers advertising "the most prevalent and toxic of the mental pollutants. From the moment your radio alarm sounds in the morning to the wee hours of late-night TV microjolts of commercial pollution flood into your brain at the rate of around 3,000 marketing messages per day. Every day an estimated 12 billion display ads, 3 million radio commercials and more than 200,000 television commercials are dumped into North America's collective unconscious".&lt;ref name="Lasn 1999"&gt;Lasn, Kalle in: Culture Jam: The Uncooling of America, William Morrow &amp; Company; 1st edition (November 1999), {{ISBN|0-688-15656-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-688-15656-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of their life, the average American watches three years of advertising on television.&lt;ref&gt;Kilbourne, Jean: Can't Buy My Love: How Advertising Changes the Way We Think and Feel, Touchstone, 2000, {{ISBN|978-0-684-86600-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Video games incorporate products into their content. Special commercial patient channels in hospitals and public figures sporting temporary tattoos. A method unrecognisable as advertising is so-called ''[[guerrilla marketing]]'' which is spreading 'buzz' about a new product in target audiences. Cash-strapped U.S. cities offer police cars for advertising.&lt;ref&gt;McChesney, Robert W. "The Political Economy of Media: Enduring Issues, Emerging Dilemmas". Monthly Review Press, New York, (May 1, 2008), {{ISBN|978-1-58367-161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Companies buy the names of [[Stadium|sports stadiums]] for advertising. The [[Hamburg]] soccer Volkspark stadium first became the AOL Arena and then the [[HSH Nordbank Arena]]. The [[Stuttgart]] Neckarstadion became the [[Mercedes-Benz Arena (Stuttgart)|Mercedes-Benz Arena]], the Dortmund Westfalenstadion is the [[Signal Iduna Park]]. The former SkyDome in Toronto was renamed [[Rogers Centre]].

Whole subway stations in Berlin are redesigned into product halls and exclusively leased to a company. Düsseldorf has "multi-sensorial" adventure transit stops equipped with loudspeakers and systems that spread the smell of a detergent. Swatch used beamers to project messages on the Berlin TV-tower and Victory column, which was fined because it was done without a permit. The illegality was part of the scheme and added promotion.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; [[Christopher Lasch]] states that advertising leads to an overall increase in [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] in society; "Advertising serves not so much to advertise products as to promote [[Consumerism|consumption as a way of life]]."&lt;ref&gt;Lasch, Christopher. The Culture of Narcissism: American Life in an Age of Diminishing Expectations, Norton, New York, {{ISBN|978-0-393-30738-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constitutional rights==
In the US, advertising is equated with constitutionally guaranteed freedom of opinion and speech.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.csupomona.edu/~jkirkpatrick/Papers/EthicsAdvtTaxation.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Currently or in the near future, any number of cases are and will be working their way through the court system that would seek to prohibit any government regulation of... commercial speech (e.g. advertising or food labelling) on the grounds that such regulation would violate citizens' and corporations' First Amendment rights to free speech or free press."&lt;ref&gt;McChesney, Robert W. "The Political Economy of Media: Enduring Issues, Emerging Dilemmas". Monthly Review Press, New York, (May 1, 2008), pp. 132, 249, {{ISBN|978-1-58367-161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example for this debate is advertising for tobacco or alcohol but also advertising by mail or fliers (clogged mail boxes), advertising on the phone, in the Internet and advertising for children. Various legal restrictions concerning spamming, advertising on mobile phones, when addressing children, tobacco, alcohol have been introduced by the US, the EU and other countries.

McChesney argues, that the government deserves constant vigilance when it comes to such regulations, but that it is certainly not "the only antidemocratic force in our society. Corporations and the wealthy enjoy a power every bit as immense as that enjoyed by the lords and royalty of feudal times" and "markets are not value-free or neutral; they not only tend to work to the advantage of those with the most money, but they also by their very nature emphasize profit over all else. Hence, today the debate is over whether advertising or food labelling, or campaign contributions are speech... if the rights to be protected by the First Amendment can only be effectively employed by a fraction of the citizenry, and their exercise of these rights gives them undue political power and undermines the ability of the balance of the citizenry to exercise the same rights and/or constitutional rights, then it is not necessarily legitimately protected by the First Amendment". "Those with the capacity to engage in free press are in a position to determine who can speak to the great mass of citizens and who cannot".&lt;ref&gt;McChesney, Robert W. "The Political Economy of Media: Enduring Issues, Emerging Dilemmas". Monthly Review Press, New York, (May 1, 2008), pp. 252, 249, 254, 256, {{ISBN|978-1-58367-161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Georg Franck at Vienna University of Technology, says that advertising is part of what he calls "mental capitalism",&lt;ref name="aufmerksamkeit1998"&gt;Franck, Georg: ''Ökonomie der Aufmerksamkeit. Ein Entwurf.'' (Economy of Attention), 1. Edition. Carl Hanser, March 1998, {{ISBN|3-446-19348-0}}, {{ISBN|978-3-446-19348-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="medienzeitalter36"&gt;Lecture held at Philosophicum Lech (Austria) 2002, published in Konrad Paul Liessmann (Hrg.), Die Kanäle der Macht. Herrschaft und Freiheit im Medienzeitalter, Philosophicum Lech Vol. 6, Vienna: Zsolnay, 2003, pp. 36-60; preprint in Merkur No. 645, January 2003, S. 1-15&lt;/ref&gt; taking up a term (mental) which has been used by groups concerned with the mental environment, such as [[Adbusters]]. Franck blends the "Economy of Attention" with Christopher Lasch's [[The Culture of Narcissism|culture of narcissism]] into the mental capitalism:&lt;ref name="christopher1995"&gt;Lasch, Christopher: ''Das Zeitalter des Narzissmus.'' (The Culture of Narcissism), 1. Edition. Hoffmann und Campe, Hamburg 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; In his essay "Advertising at the Edge of the Apocalypse", [[Sut Jhally]] writes: "20th century advertising is the most powerful and sustained system of propaganda in [[human history]] and its cumulative cultural effects, unless quickly checked, will be responsible for destroying the world as we know it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sutjhally.com/articles/advertisingattheed/ |title=Sut Jhally Website - Advertising at the Edge of the Apocalypse |publisher=Sutjhally.com |date= |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Costs==
Advertising has developed into a multibillion-dollar business. In 2014, 537 billion US dollars &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/07/internet-ad-spend-to-reach-121b-in-2014-23-of-537b-total-ad-spend-ad-tech-gives-display-a-boost-over-search/ | title=Internet Ad Spend To Reach $121B In 2014, 23% Of $537B Total Ad Spend, Ad Tech Boosts Display |date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; were spent worldwide for advertising. In 2013, TV accounted for 40.1% of ad spending, compared to a combined 18.1% for internet, 16.9% for newspapers, 7.9% for magazines, 7% for outdoor, 6.9% for radio, 2.7% for mobile and 0.5% for cinema as a share of ad spending by medium. Advertising is considered to raise consumption.

Attention and attentiveness have become a new commodity for which a market developed. "The amount of attention that is absorbed by the media and redistributed in the competition for quotas and reach is not identical with the amount of attention, that is available in society. The total amount circulating in society is made up of the attention exchanged among the people themselves and the attention given to media information. Only the latter is homogenised by quantitative measuring and only the latter takes on the character of an anonymous currency."&lt;ref name="aufmerksamkeit1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="medienzeitalter36"/&gt; According to Franck, any surface of presentation that can guarantee a certain degree of attentiveness works as magnet for attention, for example, media which are actually meant for information and entertainment, culture and the arts, public space etc. It is this attraction which is sold to the advertising business. In Germany, the advertising industry contributes 1.5% of the gross national income. The German Advertising Association stated that in 2007, 30.78 billion Euros were spent on advertising in Germany,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zaw.de |title=ZAW - Zentralverband der deutschen Werbewirtschaft e.V |publisher=Zaw.de |date= |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 26% in newspapers, 21% on television, 15% by mail and 15% in magazines. In 2002 there were 360,000 people employed in the advertising business. The Internet revenues for advertising doubled to almost 1 billion Euros from 2006 to 2007, giving it the highest growth rates.

Few consumers are aware of the fact that they are the ones paying for every cent spent for public relations, advertisements, rebates, packaging etc., since they ordinarily get included in the price calculation.

The most important element of advertising is not information but suggestion - more or less making use of associations, [[appeal to emotion|emotions]] and drives in the subconscious, such as [[sex drive]], [[herd instinct]], [[desire]]s such as happiness, health, fitness, appearance, [[self-esteem]], [[reputation]], belonging, [[social status]], identity, adventure, distraction, reward, [[appeal to fear|fears]] such as illness, weaknesses, loneliness, need, uncertainty, security or of [[prejudice]]s, learned opinions and comforts. "All [[Need|human needs]], relationships, and [[fear]]s - the deepest recesses of the [[human psyche]] - become mere means for the expansion of the [[commodity]] universe under the force of modern marketing. With the rise to prominence of  modern marketing, [[commercialism]] - the translation of human relations into commodity relations - although a phenomenon intrinsic to capitalism, has expanded exponentially."&lt;ref&gt;McChesney, Robert W. "The Political Economy of Media: Enduring Issues, Emerging Dilemmas". Monthly Review Press, New York, (May 1, 2008), p. 265, {{ISBN|978-1-58367-161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cause-related marketing in which advertisers link their product to some worthy social cause has boomed over the past decade.

Advertising uses the model role of [[celebrities]] or popular figures and makes deliberate use of humor as well as of associations with color, tunes, certain names and terms. These are factors of how one perceives themself and one's self-worth. In his description of 'mental capitalism' Franck says, "the promise of consumption making someone irresistible is the ideal way of objects and symbols into a person's subjective experience. Evidently, in a society in which revenue of attention moves to the fore, consumption is drawn by one's self-esteem. As a result, consumption becomes 'work' on a person's attraction. From the subjective point of view, this 'work' opens fields of unexpected dimensions for advertising. Advertising takes on the role of a life councillor in matters of attraction. The cult around one's own attraction is what Christopher Lasch described as 'Culture of Narcissism'."&lt;ref name="medienzeitalter36"/&gt;&lt;ref name="christopher1995"/&gt;

For advertising critics another serious problem is that, "the long standing notion of separation between advertising and editorial/creative sides of media is rapidly crumbling" and advertising is increasingly hard to tell apart from news, information or entertainment. The boundaries between advertising and programming are becoming blurred. According to the media firms all this commercial involvement has no influence over actual media content, but as McChesney puts it, "this claim fails to pass even the most basic giggle test, it is so preposterous."&lt;ref&gt;McChesney, Robert W. "The Political Economy of Media: Enduring Issues, Emerging Dilemmas". Monthly Review Press, New York, (May 1, 2008), pp. 270, 272, {{ISBN|978-1-58367-161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advertising draws "heavily on psychological theories about how to create subjects, enabling advertising and marketing to take on a 'more clearly psychological tinge'.&lt;ref&gt;Miller and Rose, 1997, cited in Thrift, 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;67&lt;/ref&gt; Increasingly, the emphasis in advertising has switched from providing 'factual' information to the symbolic connotations of commodities, since the crucial cultural premise of advertising is that the material object being sold is never in itself enough. Even those commodities providing for the most mundane necessities of daily life must be imbued with symbolic qualities and culturally endowed meanings via the 'magic system' of advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; In this way and by altering the context in which advertisements appear, things 'can be made to mean 'just about anything' and the 'same' things can be endowed with different intended meanings for different individuals and groups of people, thereby offering mass produced visions of individualism."&lt;ref name="oxfordjournals1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://joeg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/8/3/421 |title=JEG - Sign In Page |publisher=Joeg.oxfordjournals.org |date= |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McFall, 2002, p.162&lt;/ref&gt;

Before advertising is done, [[market research]] institutions need to know and describe the target group to exactly plan and implement the advertising campaign and to achieve the best possible results. A whole array of sciences directly deal with advertising and marketing or are used to improve its effects. Focus groups, psychologists and cultural anthropologists are '''de rigueur''' in marketing research".&lt;ref name="mcchesney277"&gt;McChesney, Robert W. "The Political Economy of Media: Enduring Issues, Emerging Dilemmas". Monthly Review Press, New York, (May 1, 2008), p.277, {{ISBN|978-1-58367-161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vast amounts of data on persons and their shopping habits are collected, accumulated, aggregated and analysed with the aid of credit cards, bonus cards, raffles and internet surveying. With increasing accuracy this supplies a picture of behaviour, wishes and weaknesses of certain sections of a population with which advertisement can be employed more selectively and effectively.

The efficiency of advertising is improved through [[advertising research]]. Universities, of course supported by business and in co-operation with other disciplines (s. above), mainly [[Psychiatry]], [[Anthropology]], [[Neurology]] and behavioural sciences, are constantly in search for ever more refined, sophisticated, subtle and crafty methods to make advertising more effective. "[[Neuromarketing]] is a controversial new field of marketing which uses medical technologies such as functional [[Magnetic Resonance Imaging]] (fMRI)—not to heal, but to sell products. Advertising and marketing firms have long used the insights and research methods of psychology in order to sell products, of course. But today these practices are reaching epidemic levels, and with a complicity on the part of the psychological profession that exceeds that of the past. The result is an enormous advertising and marketing onslaught that comprises, arguably, the largest single psychological project ever undertaken. Yet, this great undertaking remains largely ignored by the American Psychological Association."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commercialalert.org/issues/culture/psychology |title=Psychology — Commercial Alert |publisher=Commercialalert.org |date=1999-10-31 |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert McChesney calls it "the greatest concerted attempt at [[psychological manipulation]] in all of human history."&lt;ref&gt;McChesney, Robert W. "The Political Economy of Media: Enduring Issues, Emerging Dilemmas"., (May 1, 2008), p. 277, {{ISBN|978-1-58367-161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media and Corporate censorship==
{{see|Corporate censorship}}
Almost all [[mass media]] are [[advertising media]] and many of them are exclusively advertising media and, with the exception of [[public service broadcasting]], are in the private sector. Their income is predominantly generated through advertising; in the case of newspapers and magazines from 50 to 80%. Public service broadcasting in some countries can also heavily depend on advertising as a source of income (up to 40%).&lt;ref&gt;Siegert, Gabriele, Brecheis Dieter in: Werbung in der Medien- und Informationsgesellschaft, Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften, 2005, {{ISBN|3-531-13893-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the view of critics no media that spreads advertisements can be independent and the higher the proportion of advertising, the higher the dependency. This dependency has "distinct implications for the nature of media content.... In the business press, the media are often referred to in exactly the way they present themselves in their candid moments: as a branch of the advertising industry."&lt;ref&gt;McChesney, Robert W. "The Political Economy of Media: Enduring Issues, Emerging Dilemmas". Monthly Review Press, New York, (May 1, 2008), p. 256, {{ISBN|978-1-58367-161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the private media are increasingly subject to mergers and concentration with property situations often becoming entangled and opaque. This development, which Henry A. Giroux calls an "ongoing threat to democratic culture",&lt;ref name="sutjhally.com"&gt;Giroux, Henry A., McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada, in the foreword for: The Spectacle of Accumulation by Sut Jhally, [http://www.sutjhally.com/biography Sutjhally.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  by itself should suffice to sound all alarms in a democracy. Five or six advertising agencies dominate this 400 billion U.S. dollar global industry.

"Journalists have long faced pressure to shape stories to suit advertisers and owners .... the vast majority of TV station executives found their news departments 'cooperative' in shaping the news to assist in 'non-traditional revenue development."&lt;ref&gt;McChesney, Robert W. "The Political Economy of Media: Enduring Issues, Emerging Dilemmas". Monthly Review Press, New York, (May 1, 2008), p. 43, {{ISBN|978-1-58367-161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Negative and undesired reporting can be prevented or influenced when advertisers threaten to cancel orders or simply when there is a danger of such a cancellation. Media dependency and such a threat become very real when there is only one dominant or very few large advertisers. The influence of advertisers is not only in regard to news or information on their own products or services but expands to articles or shows not directly linked to them. In order to secure their advertising revenues the media have to create the best possible 'advertising environment'.

Another problem considered censorship by critics is the refusal of media to accept advertisements that are not in their interest. A striking example of this is the refusal of TV stations to broadcast ads by [[Adbusters]]. Groups try to place advertisements and are refused by networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/3581/adbusters_ads_busted/ |title=Adbusters' Ads Busted |publisher=In These Times |date= |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is principally the viewing rates which decide upon the programme in the private radio and television business. "Their business is to absorb as much attention as possible. The viewing rate measures the attention the media trades for the information offered. The service of this attraction is sold to the advertising business"&lt;ref name="medienzeitalter36"/&gt; and the viewing rates determine the price that can be demanded for advertising.

"Advertising companies determining the contents of shows has been part of daily life in the USA since 1933. Procter &amp; Gamble (P&amp;G) .... offered a radio station a history-making trade (today known as "bartering"): the company would produce an own show for "free" and save the radio station the high expenses for producing contents. Therefore, the company would want its commercials spread and, of course, its products placed in the show. Thus, the series '[[Ma Perkins]]' was created, which P&amp;G skilfully used to promote Oxydol, the leading detergent brand in those years and the [[Soap opera]] was born ..."&lt;ref name="viadrina1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://viadrina.euv-ffo.de/~sk/SS99/werbung99/medien.html |title=Seminar: Werbewelten - Werbung und Medien |language=de |publisher=Viadrina.euv-ffo.de |date= |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While critics basically worry about the subtle influence of the economy on the media, there are also examples of blunt exertion of influence. The US company [[Chrysler]], before it merged with [[Daimler Benz]] had its agency (PentaCom) send out a letter to numerous magazines, demanding that they send an overview of all the topics before the next issue was published, to "avoid potential conflict". Chrysler most of all wanted to know if there would be articles with "sexual, political or social" content, or which could be seen as "provocative or offensive". PentaCom executive David Martin said: "Our reasoning is, that anyone looking at a 22.000 $ product would want it surrounded by positive things. There is nothing positive about an article on child pornography."&lt;ref name="viadrina1"/&gt; In another example, the USA Network held top-level‚ off-the-record meetings with advertisers in 2000 to let them tell the network what type of programming content they wanted in order for USA to get their advertising."&lt;ref&gt;McChesney, Robert W. "The Political Economy of Media: Enduring Issues, Emerging Dilemmas". Monthly Review Press, New York, (May 1, 2008), p.271, {{ISBN|978-1-58367-161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Television shows are created to accommodate the needs of advertising, e.g. splitting them up in suitable sections. Their dramaturgy is typically designed to end in suspense or leave an unanswered question in order to keep the viewer attached.

The movie system, at one time outside the direct influence of the broader marketing system, is now fully integrated into it through the strategies of licensing, tie-ins and product placements. The prime function of many Hollywood films today is to aid in the selling of the immense collection of commodities.&lt;ref name="advertisingattheed1"&gt;Jhally, Sut. Advertising at the edge of the apocalypse: [http://www.sutjhally.com/articles/advertisingattheed/ Sutjhally.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
The press called the 2002 Bond film 'Die Another Day' featuring 24 major promotional partners an 'ad-venture' and noted that [[James Bond]] "now has been 'licensed to sell'" As it has become standard practice to place products in motion pictures, it "has self-evident implications for what types of films will attract product placements and what types of films will therefore be more likely to get made".&lt;ref&gt;McChesney, Robert W. "The Political Economy of Media: Enduring Issues, Emerging Dilemmas". Monthly Review Press, New York, (May 1, 2008), pp. 269, 270, {{ISBN|978-1-58367-161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advertising and information are increasingly hard to distinguish from each other. "The borders between advertising and media .... become more and more blurred.... What August Fischer, chairman of the board of [[Axel Springer]] publishing company considers to be a 'proven partnership between the media and advertising business' critics regard as nothing but the infiltration of journalistic duties and freedoms". According to [[RTL Group]] former executive Helmut Thoma "private stations shall not and cannot serve any mission but only the goal of the company which is the 'acceptance by the advertising business and the viewer'. The setting of priorities in this order actually says everything about the 'design of the programmes' by private television."&lt;ref name="viadrina1"/&gt;
Patrick Le Lay, former managing director of TF1, a private French television channel with a market share of 25 to 35%, said: "There are many ways to talk about television. But from the business point of view, let's be realistic: basically, the job of TF1 is, e. g. to help Coca Cola sell its product. (...) For an advertising message to be perceived the brain of the viewer must be at our disposal. The job of our programmes is to make it available, that is to say, to distract it, to relax it and get it ready between two messages. It is disposable human brain time that we sell to Coca Cola."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.observatoire-medias.info/article.php3?id_article=225 |title=Selon Le Lay, TF1 a une mission: fournir du "temps de cerveau humain disponible" - [Observatoire français des médias&amp;#93;|publisher=Observatoire-medias.info |date= |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of these dependencies, a widespread and fundamental public debate about advertising and its influence on information and freedom of speech is difficult to obtain, at least through the usual media channels: it would saw off the branch it was sitting on. "The notion that the commercial basis of media, journalism, and communication could have troubling implications for democracy is excluded from the range of legitimate debate" just as "capitalism is off-limits as a topic of legitimate debate in US political culture".&lt;ref&gt;McChesney, Robert W. "The Political Economy of Media: Enduring Issues, Emerging Dilemmas". Monthly Review Press, New York, (May 1, 2008), pp. 235, 237, {{ISBN|978-1-58367-161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early critic of the structural basis of US journalism was [[Upton Sinclair]] with his novel [[The Brass Check]] in which he stresses the influence of owners, advertisers, public relations, and economic interests on the media. In his book "Our Master's Voice - Advertising" the social ecologist [[James Rorty]] (1890-1973) wrote:
"The gargoyle's mouth is a loudspeaker, powered by the vested interest of a two-billion dollar industry, and back of that the vested interests of business as a whole, of industry, of finance. It is never silent, it drowns out all other voices, and it suffers no rebuke, for it is not the voice of America? That is its claim and to some extent it is a just claim..."&lt;ref&gt;Rorty, James: "Our Master's Voice: Advertising" Ayer Co Pub, 1976, {{ISBN|0-405-08044-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-405-08044-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has taught us how to live, what to be afraid of, what to be proud of, how to be beautiful, how to be loved, how to be envied, how to be successful..  Is it any wonder that the American population tends increasingly to speak, think, feel in terms of this jabberwocky? That the stimuli of art, science, religion are progressively expelled to the periphery of American life to become marginal values, cultivated by marginal people on marginal time?"&lt;ref&gt;Rorty, James: (1934) "Our Master's Voice - Advertising", McMaster Press (June 30, 2008), {{ISBN|1-4097-6973-9}}, {{ISBN|978-1-4097-6973-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture and sports==
Performances, exhibitions, shows, concerts, conventions and most other events can hardly take place without sponsoring.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}  Artists are graded and paid according to their art's value for commercial purposes.
Corporations promote renowned artists, thereby getting exclusive rights in global advertising campaigns. Broadway shows like 'La Bohème' featured commercial props in their sets.&lt;ref&gt;McChesney, Robert W. "The Political Economy of Media: Enduring Issues, Emerging Dilemmas". Monthly Review Press, New York, (May 1, 2008), p. 276, {{ISBN|978-1-58367-161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advertising itself is extensively considered to be a contribution to culture. Advertising is integrated into fashion. On many pieces of clothing the company [[logo]] is the only design or is an important part of it. There is only a little room left outside the consumption economy, in which culture and art can develop independently and where alternative values can be expressed. A last important sphere, the universities, is under strong pressure to open up for business and its interests.&lt;ref&gt;Jhally, Sut in: Stay Free Nr. 16, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Inflatable Billboard in front of a sports stadium.jpg|thumb|left|Inflatable billboard in front of a [[Stadium|sports stadium]]]]

Competitive sports have become unthinkable without sponsoring and there is a mutual dependency.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} High income with advertising is only possible with a comparable number of spectators or viewers. On the other hand, the poor performance of a team or a sportsman results in less advertising revenues. Jürgen Hüther and Hans-Jörg Stiehler talk about a 'Sports/Media Complex which is a complicated mix of media, agencies, managers, sports promoters, advertising etc. with partially common and partially diverging interests but in any case with common commercial interests. The media presumably is at centre stage because it can supply the other parties involved with a rare commodity, namely (potential) public attention. In sports "the media are able to generate enormous sales in both circulation and advertising."&lt;ref&gt;McChesney, Robert W. "The Political Economy of Media: Enduring Issues, Emerging Dilemmas". Monthly Review Press, New York, (May 1, 2008), p. 213, {{ISBN|978-1-58367-161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Sports sponsorship is acknowledged by the tobacco industry to be valuable advertising. A Tobacco Industry journal in 1994 described the Formula One car as 'The most powerful advertising space in the world'. .... In a cohort study carried out in 22 secondary schools in England in 1994 and 1995 boys whose favourite television sport was motor racing had a 12.8% risk of becoming regular smokers compared to 7.0% of boys who did not follow motor racing."&lt;ref name="scientific1998"&gt;Report of the Scientific Committee on Tobacco and Health, Prepared March 20, 1998, in [http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/doh/tobacco/part-4.htm Archive.official-documents.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

Not the sale of tickets but transmission rights, sponsoring and merchandising in the meantime make up the largest part of sports association's and sports club's revenues with the IOC ([[International Olympic Committee]]) taking the lead. The influence of the media brought many changes in sports including the admittance of new 'trend sports' into the [[Olympic Games]], the alteration of competition distances, changes of rules, animation of spectators, changes of sports facilities, the cult of sports heroes who quickly establish themselves in the advertising and entertaining business because of their media value&lt;ref name="merzwissenschaft2006"&gt;Hüther, Jürgen and Stiehler, Hans-Jörg in: Merz, Zeitschrift für Medien und Erziehung, Vol. 2006/6: merzWissenschaft - Sport und Medien, [http://www.jff.de/merz/list.php?katid=3&amp;heft_id=80 JFF.de]&lt;/ref&gt; and last but not least, the naming and renaming of sport stadiums after big companies.

"In sports adjustment into the logic of the media can contribute to the erosion of values such as equal chances or fairness, to excessive demands on athletes through public pressure and multiple exploitation or to deceit ([[Use of performance-enhancing drugs in sport|doping]], manipulation of results ...). It is in the very interest of the media and sports to counter this danger because media sports can only work as long as sport exists.&lt;ref name="merzwissenschaft2006"/&gt;

==Public space==
{{see|public space}}
Every visually perceptible place has potential for advertising, especially urban areas with their structures but also landscapes in sight of thoroughfares are more and more turning into media for advertisements. Signs, posters, [[billboard]]s, flags have become decisive factors in the urban appearance and their numbers are still on the increase. "[[Outdoor advertising]] has become unavoidable. Traditional billboards and transit shelters have cleared the way for more pervasive methods such as wrapped vehicles, sides of buildings, electronic signs, kiosks, taxis, posters, sides of buses, and more. Digital technologies are used on buildings to sport 'urban [[wall display]]s'. In urban areas commercial content is placed in our sight and into our consciousness every moment we are in public space. The German Newspaper 'Zeit' called it a new kind of 'dictatorship that one cannot escape'.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

Over time, this domination of the surroundings has become the "natural" state. Through long-term commercial saturation, it has become implicitly understood by the public that advertising has the right to own, occupy and control every inch of available space. The steady normalization of invasive advertising dulls the public's perception of their surroundings, re-enforcing a general attitude of powerlessness toward creativity and change, thus a cycle develops enabling advertisers to slowly and consistently increase the saturation of advertising with little or no public outcry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://antiadvertisingagency.com/our-mission |title=Our Mission |publisher=The Anti-Advertising Agency |date= |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The massive optical orientation toward advertising changes the function of public spaces which are utilised by brands. Urban landmarks are turned into trademarks. The highest pressure is exerted on renown and highly frequented public spaces which are also important for the identity of a city (e.g. [[Piccadilly Circus]], [[Times Square]], [[Alexanderplatz]]).
Urban spaces are public commodities and in this capacity they are subject to "aesthetical environment protection", mainly through building regulations, heritage protection and landscape protection. "It is in this capacity that these spaces are now being privatised. They are peppered with billboards and signs, they are remodelled into media for advertising."&lt;ref name="aufmerksamkeit1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="medienzeitalter36"/&gt;

==Sexism, discrimination and stereotyping==
{{see|stereotyping|sexism|discrimination}}
[[File:Two girls examining a bulletin board posted on a fence. An advertisement painted above them asks "Are You a Woman?".jpg|thumb|right|Two girls examining a bulletin board posted on a fence. An advertisement painted above them asks "Are You a Woman?".]]

"Advertising has an "agenda setting function" which is the ability, with huge sums of money, to put consumption as the only item on the agenda. In the battle for a share of the [[public conscience]] this amounts to non-treatment ([[ignorance]]) of whatever is not commercial and whatever  is not advertised for

With increasing force, advertising makes itself comfortable in the [[private sphere]] so that the voice of commerce becomes the dominant way of expression in society."&lt;ref&gt;Eicke, Ulrich in: Die Werbelawine. Angriff auf unser Bewußtsein. München, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;
Advertising critics see advertising as the leading light in our culture. Sut Jhally and James Twitchell go beyond considering advertising as kind of [[religion]] and that advertising even replaces religion as a key institution.&lt;ref&gt;Stay Free Nr. 16, On Advertising, Summer 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

"Corporate advertising (or commercial media) is the largest single psychological project ever undertaken by the human race. Yet for all of that, its impact on us remains unknown and largely ignored. When I think of the media's influence over years, over decades, I think of those [[brainwashing]] experiments conducted by Dr. [[Donald Ewen Cameron|Ewen Cameron]] in a Montreal psychiatric hospital in the 1950s (see [[MKULTRA]]). The idea of the CIA-sponsored "[[depatterning]]" experiments was to outfit conscious, unconscious or semiconscious subjects with headphones, and flood their brains with thousands of repetitive "driving" messages that would alter their behaviour over time....Advertising aims to do the same thing."&lt;ref name="Lasn 1999"/&gt;

Advertising is especially aimed at young people and children and it increasingly reduces young people to consumers.&lt;ref name="sutjhally.com"/&gt;
For Sut Jhally it is not "surprising that something this central and with so much being expended on it should become an important presence in social life. Indeed, commercial interests intent on maximizing the consumption of the immense collection of commodities have colonized more and more of the spaces of our culture. For instance, almost the entire media system (television and print) has been developed as a delivery system for marketers, and its prime function is to produce audiences for sale to advertisers. Both the advertisements it carries and the editorial matter that acts as a support for it celebrate the consumer society. The movie system, at one time outside the direct influence of the broader marketing system, is now fully integrated into it through the strategies of licensing, tie-ins and product placements.

The prime function of many Hollywood films today is to aid in the selling of the immense collection of commodities. As public funds are drained from the non-commercial cultural sector, art galleries, museums and symphonies bid for corporate sponsorship."&lt;ref name="advertisingattheed1"/&gt; In the same way effected is the education system and advertising is increasingly penetrating schools and universities. Cities, such as New York, accept sponsors for public playgrounds. "Even the pope has been commercialized ... The pope's 4-day visit to Mexico in ...1999 was sponsored by Frito-Lay and PepsiCo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mularz|first=Stephen|title=The Negative Effects of Advertising, |url=http://www.mularzart.com/writings/THE%20NEGATIVE%20EFFECTS%20OF%20ADVERTISING.pdf|format=PDF|website=mularzart.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The industry is accused of being one of the engines powering a convoluted economic mass production system which promotes consumption.
As far as social effects are concerned it does not matter whether advertising fuels consumption but which values, patterns of behaviour and assignments of meaning it propagates.

Advertising is accused of hijacking the language and means of pop culture, of protest movements and even of subversive criticism and does not shy away from scandalizing and breaking taboos (e.g. Benneton). This in turn incites counter action, what Kalle Lasn in 2001 called ''Jamming the Jam of the Jammers''. Anything goes. "It is a central social-scientific question what people can be made to do by suitable design of conditions and of great practical importance. For example, from a great number of experimental psychological experiments it can be assumed, that people can be made to do anything they are capable of, when the according social condition can be created."&lt;ref&gt;Richter, Hans Jürgen. Einführung in das Image-Marketing. Feldtheoretische Forschung. Stuttgart: Kohlhammer (Urban TB, 1977). Hieraus: Aufgabe der Werbung S. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Advertising often uses stereotype gender specific roles of men and women reinforcing existing [[cliché]]s and it has been criticized as "inadvertently or even intentionally promoting sexism, racism, heterosexualism, ableism, ageism, et cetera... At very least, advertising often reinforces stereotypes by drawing on recognizable "types" in order to tell stories in a single image or 30 second time frame." Activities are depicted as typical male or female (stereotyping). In addition, people are reduced to their sexuality or equated with commodities and gender specific qualities are exaggerated. Sexualized female bodies, but increasingly also males, serve as eye-catchers.

In advertising, it is usually a woman that is depicted as
* a servant of men and children that reacts to the demands and complaints of her loved ones with a bad conscience and the promise for immediate improvement (wash, food)
* a sexual or emotional play toy for the self-affirmation of men
* a technically totally clueless being that can only manage a childproof operation
* female expert, but stereotype from the fields of fashion, cosmetics, food or at the most, medicine
* as ultra thin
* doing ground-work for others, e.g. serving coffee while a journalist interviews a politician&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanistische-union.de |title=Humanistische Union: Aktuelles |publisher=Humanistische-union.de |date= |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large portion of advertising deals with the promotion of products in a way that defines an "ideal" body image. This objectification greatly affects women; however, men are also affected. Women and men in advertising are frequently portrayed in unrealistic and distorted images that set a standard for what is considered "beautiful," "attractive" or "desirable." Such imagery does not allow for what is found to be beautiful in various cultures or to the individual. It is exclusionary, rather than inclusive, and consequently, these advertisements promote a negative message about body image to the average person. Because of this form of media, girls, boys, women and men may feel under high pressure to maintain an unrealistic and often unhealthy body weight or even to alter their physical appearance cosmetically or surgically in minor to drastic ways.

The EU parliament passed a resolution in 2008 that advertising may not be discriminating and degrading. This shows that politicians are increasingly concerned about the negative impacts of advertising. However, the benefits of promoting overall health and fitness are often overlooked. Men are also negatively portrayed as incompetent and the butt of every joke in advertising.

==Children and adolescents==
Business is interested in children and adolescents because of their buying power and because of their influence on the shopping habits of their parents. As they are easier to influence they are especially targeted by the advertising business.

Children "represent three distinct markets:
# Primary Purchasers ($2.9 billion annually)
# Future Consumers (Brand-loyal adults)
# Purchase Influencers ($20 billion annually)
Kids will carry forward brand expectations, whether positive, negative, or indifferent. Kids are already accustomed to being catered to as consumers. The long term prize: Loyalty of the kid translates into a brand loyal adult customer"&lt;ref&gt;YTV's 2007 Tween Report in: [http://ontariondp.com/ban-advertising-aimed-children-under-13 Ontariondp.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

"Kids represent an important demographic to marketers because they have their own purchasing power, they influence their parents' buying decisions and they're the adult consumers of the future." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/parents/marketing/marketers_target_kids.cfm |title=How Marketers Target Kids |publisher=The Media Awareness Network (MNet) |year=2010 |accessdate=2011-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416200521/http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/parents/marketing/marketers_target_kids.cfm |archivedate=2009-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Advertising for other products preferably uses media with which they can also reach the next generation of consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Eicke Ulrich u. Wolfram  in: Medienkinder: Vom richtigen Umgang mit der Vielfalt, Knesebeck München, 1994, {{ISBN|3-926901-67-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Key advertising messages exploit the emerging independence of young people".

===Children's exposure to advertising===
The children's market, where resistance to advertising is weakest, is the "pioneer for ad creep".&lt;ref&gt;McChesney, Robert W. "The Political Economy of Media: Enduring Issues, Emerging Dilemmas". Monthly Review Press, New York, (May 1, 2008), p. 269, {{ISBN|978-1-58367-161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example is product placement. "[[Product placement]]s show up everywhere, and children aren't exempt. Far from it. The animated film, Foodfight, had 'thousands of products and character icons from the familiar (items) in a grocery store.' Children's books also feature branded items and characters, and millions of them have snack foods as lead characters."&lt;ref&gt;McChesney, Robert W. "The Political Economy of Media: Enduring Issues, Emerging Dilemmas". Monthly Review Press (May 1, 2008), {{ISBN|978-1-58367-161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The average Canadian child sees 350,000 TV commercials before graduating from high school, spends nearly as much time watching TV as attending classes. In 1980 the Canadian province of Quebec banned advertising for children under age 13.&lt;ref&gt;Consumer Protection Act, R.S.Q., c. P-40.1, ss. 248-9 (see also: ss. 87-91 of the Consumer Protection Regulations, R.R.Q., 1981, c. P-40.1; and Application Guide for Sections 248 and 249 of the Quebec Consumer Protection Act (Advertising Intended for Children Under 13 Years of Age).&lt;/ref&gt;  "In upholding the constitutional validity of the [[Quebec Consumer Protection Act]] restrictions on advertising to children under age 13 (in the case of a challenge by a toy company) the Court held: '...advertising directed at young children is per se manipulative. Such advertising aims to promote products by convincing those who will always believe.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexum.umontreal.ca/csc-scc/en/pub/1989/vol1/html/1989scr1_0927.html|title=Redirection&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=umontreal.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Norway (ads directed at children under age 12), and Sweden (television ads aimed at children under age 12) also have legislated broad bans on advertising to children, during child programmes any kind of advertising is forbidden in Sweden, Denmark, Austria and Flemish Belgium. In Greece there is no advertising for kids products from 7 to 22 h. An attempt to restrict advertising directed at children in the US failed with reference to the First Amendment. In Spain bans are also considered undemocratic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Melanie Rother |url=https://www.berlinonline.de/berliner-zeitung/archiv/.bin/dump.fcgi/2001/0203/none/0086/index.html |title=Leichtes Spiel für die Werbeindustrie : Textarchiv : Berliner Zeitung Archiv |publisher=Berlinonline.de |date=2008-05-31 |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Corinna|last=Hawkes|title=Marketing Food to Children: The Global Regulatory Environment|location=Geneva|website=World Health Organization|year=2004|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2004/9241591579.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Web sites targeted to children may also display advertisements, though there are fewer ads on non-profit web sites than on for-profit sites and those ads were less likely to contain enticements. However, even ads on non-profit sites may link to sites that collect personal information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cai|first=Xiaomei|title=Advertisements and Privacy: Comparing For-Profit and Non-Profit Web Sites for Children|journal=Communication Research Reports|year=2008|volume=25|issue=1|page=67|doi=10.1080/08824090701831826}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food advertising===
{{see also|Fast food advertising|Adolescents and food marketing}}
[[Sweets]], [[ice cream]], and [[breakfast food]] makers often aim their promotion at children and adolescents. For example, an ad for a breakfast cereal on a channel aimed at adults will have music that is a soft ballad, whereas on a channel aimed at children, the same ad will use a catchy rock jingle of the same song to aim at kids.
"The marketing industry is facing increased pressure over claimed links between exposure to food advertising and a range of social problems, especially growing obesity levels."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-31767632_ITM |title=Commercial media literacy: what does it do, to whom-and does it matter? (22-JUN-07) |work=[[Journal of Advertising]] |publisher=Accessmylibrary.com |date=2007-06-22 |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Fast food]] chains spend more than 3 billion dollars a year on advertising, much of it aimed at children... Restaurants offer incentives such as playgrounds, contests, clubs, games, and free toys and other merchandise related to movies, TV shows and even sports leagues."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/parents/marketing/issues_kids_marketing.cfm |title=Special Issues for Young Children: Junk food advertising and nutrition concerns |publisher=[[The Media Awareness Network]] (MNet) |year=2010 |accessdate=2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These businesses are constantly reaping the benefits of this child manipulation.
In 2006, forty-four of the largest U.S. [[food industries]] spent about 2 billion dollars on advertising their products, which mainly consisted of unhealthy, sugary and fatty foods. Such massive advertising has a detrimental effect on children and it heavily influences their diets. Extensive research proves that most of the food consumed between ages of 2-18 is low in nutrients. Facing a lot of pressure from health industries and laws, such as the Children's Food and Beverage Advertising initiative, food marketers were forced to tweak and limit their advertising strategies. Despite regulations, a 2009 report shows that three quarters of all food advertising during [[children's television programs]] were outside of the law's boundaries. Government attempts to put a heavy burden on food marketers in order to prevent the issue, but food marketers enjoy the benefits of the [[First Amendment]] which limits government's power to prevent advertising against children. The [[Federal Trade Commission]] states that children between the ages of 2-11 on average see 15 food based commercials on television daily. Most of these commercial involve high-sugar and high-fat foods, which adds to the problem of [[childhood obesity]]. An experiment that took place in a summer camp, where researches showed food advertisements to children between ages 5–8 for two weeks. The outcome-what kids chose to eat at a cafeteria were the ads they saw on TV over the two weeks.&lt;ref name="Health Affairs"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/31/2/392 | title=Government can regulate food advertising to children because cognitive research shows that it is inherently misleading | author=Graff, S., Kunkel, D., Mermin E.

===Cigarettes and alcohol advertising===
{{main|Alcohol advertising|Cigarette advertising}}
{{see also|Alcohol advertising on college campuses|Alcohol consumption by youth in the United States}}

In advertisements, cigarettes "are used as a fashion accessory and appeal to young women. Other influences on young people include the linking of sporting heroes and smoking through sports sponsorship, the use of cigarettes by popular characters in television programmes and cigarette promotions. Research suggests that young people are aware of the most heavily advertised cigarette brands."&lt;ref name="scientific1998"/&gt; Alcohol is portrayed in advertising similarly to smoking, "Alcohol ads continue to appeal to children and portrayals of alcohol use in the entertainment media are extensive".&lt;ref name="eric.ed.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/ERIC_ED461810 &lt;!-- http://www.eric.ed.gov:80/ERICDocs/data/ericdocs2sql/content_storage_01/0000019b/80/19/cb/b6.pdf|format=PDF --&gt;|title=ERIC ED461810: Teen Tipplers: America's Underage Drinking Epidemic|publisher=ERIC - [[Education Resources Information Center]] ([[United States Department of Education]]), [[National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[consumption of alcohol]] is glamorized and shown without consequences in advertisements, music, magazines, television, film, etc. The advertisements include alcoholic beverages with colorful packaging and sweet tasting flavors, catering to the interests and likes of children and teens. The [[alcohol industry]] has a big financial stake in underage drinking, hoping to gain lifelong customers. Therefore, the media are overrun with alcohol ads which appeal to children, involving animal characters, popular music, and comedy.&lt;ref name="eric.ed.gov"/&gt;

"Kids are among the most sophisticated observers of ads. They can sing the jingles and identify the logos, and they often have strong feelings about products. What they generally don't understand, however, are the issues that underlie how advertising works. Mass media are used not only to sell goods but also ideas: how we should behave, what rules are important, who we should respect and what we should value."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schechter |first=Danny |url=http://www.mediachannel.org |title=Home |publisher=Media Channel |date=2009-04-16 |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition and campaigns against advertising==
According to critics, the total commercialization of all fields of society, the privatization of public space, the acceleration of consumption and waste of resources including the negative influence on lifestyles and on the environment has not been noticed to the necessary extent. The "hyper-commercialization of the culture is recognized and roundly detested by the citizenry, although the topic scarcely receives a whiff of attention in the media or political culture."&lt;ref&gt;McChesney, Robert W. ''The Political Economy of Media: Enduring Issues, Emerging Dilemmas''. Monthly Review Press, New York, (May 1, 2008), p. 279, {{ISBN|978-1-58367-161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "The greatest damage done by advertising is precisely that it incessantly demonstrates the prostitution of men and women who lend their intellects, their voices, their artistic skills to purposes in which they themselves do not believe, and .... that it helps to shatter and ultimately destroy our most precious non-material possessions: the confidence in the existence of meaningful purposes of human activity and respect for the integrity of man."&lt;ref&gt;Baran, Paul and Sweezy, Paul (1964) "Monopoly Capital" in: McChesney, Robert W. ''The Political Economy of Media: Enduring Issues, Emerging Dilemmas''. Monthly Review Press, New York, (May 1, 2008), p. 52, {{ISBN|978-1-58367-161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The struggle against advertising is therefore essential if we are to overcome the pervasive alienation from all genuine human needs that currently plays such a corrosive role in our society. But in resisting this type of hyper-commercialism we should not be under any illusions. Advertising may seem at times to be an almost trivial if omnipresent aspect of our economic system. Yet, as economist A. C. Pigou pointed out, it could only be 'removed altogether' if 'conditions of monopolistic competition' inherent to [[corporate capitalism]] were removed. To resist it is to resist the inner logic of capitalism itself, of which it is the pure expression."&lt;ref&gt;McChesney, Robert W. ''The Political Economy of Media: Enduring Issues, Emerging Dilemmas''. Monthly Review Press, New York, (May 1, 2008), p. 281, {{ISBN|978-1-58367-161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Visual pollution]], much of it in the form of advertising, is an issue in all the world's large cities. But what is pollution to some is a vibrant part of a city's fabric to others. New York City without [[Times Square]]'s huge digital billboards or Tokyo without the [[Ginza]]'s commercial panorama is unthinkable. [[Piccadilly Circus]] would be just a London roundabout without its signage. Still, other cities, like Moscow, have reached their limit and have begun to crack down on over-the-top outdoor advertising.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Downie |first=Andrew |url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1709961_1711305_1860002,00.html |title=São Paulo Sells Itself - Inner Workings of the World's Megacities |publisher=TIME |date= 2008-02-08|accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Many communities have chosen to regulate [[billboard]]s to protect and enhance their scenic character. The following is by no means a complete list of such communities. [[Scenic America]] estimates the nationwide total of cities and communities prohibiting the construction of new billboards to be at least 1500.

A number of states in the US prohibit all billboards:
* [[Vermont]] - Removed all billboards in the 1970s
* [[Hawaii]] - Removed all billboards in the 1920s
* [[Maine]] - Removed all billboards in the 1970s and early 80s
* [[Alaska]] - State referendum passed in 1998 prohibits billboards&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scenic.org/billboards/background/communities |title=Scenic America: Communities Prohibiting Billboard Construction |publisher=Scenic.org |date=2008-08-01 |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the city of [[São Paulo]], Brazil ordered the downsizing or removal of all billboards and most other forms of commercial advertising in the city."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Plummer |first=Robert |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/5355692.stm |title=Brazil's ad men face billboard ban, BBC News, September 19, 2006 |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-09-19 |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, [[Grenoble]], [[France]] similarly banned all billboards and public advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mahdawi|first1=Arwa|title=Can cities kick ads?

Technical appliances, such as [[Spam filters]], TV-Zappers, [[ad blocker]]s for TVs and stickers on mail boxes—"No Advertising"—and an increasing number of court cases indicate a growing interest of people to restrict or rid themselves of unwelcome advertising.

Consumer protection associations, environment protection groups, globalization opponents, consumption critics, sociologists, media critics, scientists and many others deal with the negative aspects of advertising. "Antipub" in France, "[[subvertising]]", [[culture jamming]] and [[adbusting]] have become established terms in the anti-advertising community. On the international level [[anti-globalization|globalization critics]] such as [[Naomi Klein]] and [[Noam Chomsky]] are also renowned media and advertising critics. These groups criticize the complete occupation of public spaces, surfaces, the airwaves, the media, schools etc. and the constant exposure of almost all senses to advertising messages, the invasion of privacy, and that only few consumers are aware that they themselves are bearing the costs for this to the very last penny. Some of these groups, such as the Billboard Liberation Front Creative Group in [[San Francisco]] or [[Adbusters]] in [[Vancouver]], Canada, have manifestos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboardliberation.com/manifesto.html |title=Billboard Liberation Front Creative Group |publisher=Billboardliberation.com |date= |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Grassroots organizations campaign against advertising or certain aspects of it in various forms and strategies and quite often have different roots. Adbusters, for example contests and challenges the intended meanings of advertising by subverting them and creating unintended meanings instead. Other groups, like Illegal Signs Canada, try to stem the flood of billboards by detecting and reporting ones that have been put up without permit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://illegalsigns.ca/|title=Under Construction illegalsigns.ca|work=illegalsigns.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples for various groups and organizations in different countries are L'association {{ill|Résistance à l'Aggression Publicitaire|fr}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antipub.org/ |title=Résistance À l'Agression Publicitaire |publisher=Antipub.org |date= |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; in France, where media critic [[Jean Baudrillard]] is a renowned author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaed.org |title=Media Education Foundation |publisher=Mediaed.org |date= |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Anti Advertising Agency]] works with parody and humour to raise awareness about advertising,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://antiadvertisingagency.com/ |title=The Anti-Advertising Agency |publisher=The Anti-Advertising Agency |date= |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Commercial Alert]] campaigns for the protection of children, family values, community, environmental integrity and democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commercialalert.org/ |title=Commercial Alert — Protecting communities from commercialism |publisher=Commercialalert.org |date= |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Media literacy]] organisations aim at training people, especially children, in the workings of the media and advertising in their programmes. In the US, for example, the [[Media Education Foundation]] produces and distributes documentary films and other educational resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaed.org/ |title=Media Education Foundation |publisher=Mediaed.org |date= |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
MediaWatch, a Canadian non-profit women's organization, works to educate consumers about how they can register their concerns with advertisers and regulators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediawatch.ca|title=Parked domain page|author=|date=|website=www.mediawatch.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Canadian 'Media Awareness Network/Réseau éducation médias' offers one of the world's most comprehensive collections of media education and Internet literacy resources. Its member organizations represent the public, non-profit but also private sectors. Although it stresses its independence, it accepts financial support from [[Bell Canada]], [[CTVglobemedia]], [[Canwest]], [[Telus]] and [[S-VOX]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.media-awareness.ca/|title=MediaSmarts|work=media-awareness.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To counter the increasing criticism of advertising aiming at children media literacy organizations are also initiated and funded by corporations and the advertising business themselves. In the US the Advertising Educational Foundation was created in 1983 supported by ad agencies, advertisers and media companies. It is the "advertising industry's provider and distributor of educational content to enrich the understanding of advertising and its role in culture, society and the economy,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Advertising Educational Foundation |url=http://www.aef.com/index.html |title=Advertising Educational Foundation - Educational Advertising Content |publisher=AEF |date=2008-05-20 |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; sponsored for example by [[American Airlines]], [[Anheuser-Busch]], [[Campbell Soup]], [[The Coca-Cola Company|Coca-Cola]], [[Colgate-Palmolive]], [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[General Foods]], [[General Mills]], [[Gillette (brand)|Gillette]], [[H. J. Heinz Company|Heinz]], [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]], [[Kellogg Company|Kellogg's]], [[Kraft Foods|Kraft]], [[Nabisco]], [[Nestlé]], [[Altria|Philip Morris]], [[Quaker Oats]], [[Schering AG|Schering]], [[Sterling Jewelers|Sterling]], [[Unilever]], [[Warner Lambert]], advertising agencies like [[Saatchi &amp; Saatchi]], and media companies like [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], [[Capital Cities Communications]], [[Cox Enterprises]], [[Forbes]], [[Hearst Corporation|Hearst]], [[Meredith Corporation|Meredith]], [[The New York Times]], [[RCA]]/[[NBC]], [[Reader's Digest]], [[Time (magazine)|Time]], and [[The Washington Post]], just to mention a few.

Canadian businesses established [[Concerned Children's Advertisers]] in 1990 "to instill confidence in all relevant publics by actively demonstrating our commitment, concern, responsibility and respect for children."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cca-kids.ca/about_cca/mission_mandate.html |title=Mission and Mandate |publisher=Cca-kids.ca |date= |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members are CanWest, Corus, CTV, General Mills, Hasbro, Hershey's, Kellogg's, Loblaw, Kraft, Mattel, McDonald's, Nestle, Pepsi, Walt Disney, and Weston, as well as almost 50 private broadcast partners and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cca-kids.ca/ |title=Concerned Children's Advertisers |publisher=Cca-kids.ca |date= |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Concerned Children's Advertisers was an example for similar organizations in other countries, like 'Media smart' in the United Kingdom, with offspring in Germany, France, the Netherlands and Sweden. [[New Zealand]] has a similar business-funded programme called Willie Munchright. "While such interventions are claimed to be designed to encourage children to be critical of commercial messages in general, critics of the marketing industry suggest that the motivation is simply to be seen to address a problem created by the industry itself, that is, the negative social impacts to which marketing activity has contributed.... By contributing media literacy education resources, the marketing industry is positioning itself as being part of the solution to these problems, thereby seeking to avoid wide restrictions or outright bans on marketing communication, particularly for food products deemed to have little nutritional value directed at children.... The need to be seen to be taking positive action primarily to avert potential restrictions on advertising is openly acknowledged by some sectors of the industry itself.... Furthermore, Hobbs (1998) suggests that such programs are also in the interest of media organizations that support the interventions to reduce criticism of the potential negative effects of the media themselves."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

There has also been movement that began in Paris, France, called "POP_DOWN PROJECT" in which they equate street advertising to the annoying [[pop-up ads]] on the internet. Their goal is "symbolically restoring everyone's right to non-exposure". They achieve their goal by using stickers of the "Close Window" buttons used to close  [[pop-up ads]].

==Taxation as revenue and control==
Public interest groups suggest that "access to the mental space targeted by advertisers should be taxed, in that at the present moment that space is being freely taken advantage of by advertisers with no compensation paid to the members of the public who are thus being intruded upon. This kind of tax would be a [[Pigovian tax]] in that it would act to reduce what is now increasingly seen as a public nuisance. Efforts to that end are gathering more momentum, with Arkansas and Maine considering bills to implement such a taxation. Florida enacted such a tax in 1987 but was forced to repeal it after six months, as a result of a concerted effort by national commercial interests, which withdrew planned conventions, causing major losses to the tourism industry, and cancelled advertising, causing a loss of 12 million dollars to the broadcast industry alone".{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

In the US, for example, advertising is tax deductible and suggestions for possible limits to the advertising tax deduction are met with fierce opposition from the business sector, not to mention suggestions for a special taxation. In other countries, advertising at least is taxed in the same manner services are taxed and in some advertising is subject to special taxation although on a very low level. In many cases the taxation refers especially to media with advertising (e.g. Austria, Italy, Greece, Netherlands, [[Turkey]], [[Estonia]]). Tax on advertising in European countries:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dip21.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/13/082/1308226.asc|title=DIP21.bundestag.de|author=|date=|website=bundestag.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Belgium: Advertising or billboard tax (taxe d'affichage or aanplakkingstaks) on public posters depending on size and kind of paper as well as on neon signs
* France: Tax on television commercials (taxe sur la publicité télévisée) based on the cost of the advertising unit
* Italy: Municipal tax on acoustic and visual kinds of advertisements within the municipality (imposta comunale sulla pubblicità) and municipal tax on signs, posters and other kinds of advertisements (diritti sulle pubbliche affisioni), the tariffs of which are under the jurisdiction of the municipalities
* Netherlands: Advertising tax (reclamebelastingen) with varying tariffs on certain advertising measures (excluding ads in newspapers and magazines) which can be levied by municipalities depending on the kind of advertising (billboards, neon signs etc.)
* Austria:  Municipal announcement levies on advertising through writing, pictures or lights in public areas or publicly accessible areas with varying tariffs depending on the fee, the surface or the duration of the advertising measure as well as advertising tariffs on paid ads in printed media of usually 10% of the fee.
* Sweden: Advertising tax (reklamskatt) on ads and other kinds of advertising (billboards, film, television, advertising at fairs and exhibitions, flyers) in the range of 4% for ads in newspapers and 11% in all other cases. In the case of flyers the tariffs are based on the production costs, else on the fee
* Spain: Municipalities can tax advertising measures in their territory with a rather unimportant taxes and fees of various kinds.
In his book, "[[When Corporations Rule the World]]", US author and [[Anti-globalization movement|globalization critic]]  [[David Korten]] even advocates a 50% tax on advertising to counterattack what he calls "an active propaganda machinery controlled by the world's largest corporations" which "constantly reassures us that [[consumerism]] is the path to happiness, governmental restraint of market excess is the cause of our distress, and economic globalization is both a historical inevitability and a boon to the human species."&lt;ref&gt;Korten, David. (1995) When Corporations Rule the World. 2. Edition 2001: Berrett-Koehler, [[San Francisco, California]], {{ISBN|1-887208-04-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Death by '''crushing''' or '''pressing''' is a method of [[capital punishment|execution]] that has a history during which the techniques used varied greatly from place to place, generally involving the placement of intense weight upon a person with the intent to kill. This form of execution is no longer sanctioned by any governing body.

A common method of death throughout South and South-East Asia for over 4,000 years was crushing by elephants. The [[Roman Empire|Romans]] and [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginians]] used this method on occasion.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

==Roman mythology==
In [[Roman mythology]], [[Tarpeia]] was a [[Rome|Roman]] maiden who betrayed the city of Rome to the [[Sabine]]s in exchange for what she thought would be a reward of jewelry. She was instead crushed to death and her body cast from the [[Tarpeian Rock]] which now bears her name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sanders |first=H.|title=Roman historical sources and institutions|publisher=Macmillan |year=1904|pages=1&amp;ndash;47|url=https://archive.org/stream/romanhistorical02sandgoog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crushing in pre-Columbian America==
Crushing is also reported from pre-Columbian America, notably in the [[Aztec Empire]].&lt;ref name="summerson"&gt;Summerson, Henry (1983). "The Early Development of Peine Forte et Dure."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ives"&gt;''Law, Litigants, and the Legal Profession: Papers Presented to the Fourth British Legal History Conference at the University of Birmingham 10–13 July 1979'' ed E. W. Ives &amp; A. H. Manchester, 116-125. Royal Historical Society Studies in History Series 36. London: Humanities Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crushing under common law==
{{main|Peine forte et dure}}

'''''Peine forte et dure''''' ([[Law French]] for "forceful and hard punishment") was a method of [[torture]] formerly used in the [[common law]] legal system, in which a [[defendant]] who refused to [[plea]]d ("stood mute") would be subjected to having heavier and heavier stones placed upon his or her chest until a plea was entered, or as the weight of the stones on the chest became too great for the condemned to breathe, fatal [[Asphyxia#Compressive asphyxia|suffocation]] would occur.

The common law courts originally took a very limited view of their own [[jurisdiction]]. They considered themselves to lack jurisdiction over a defendant until he had voluntarily submitted to it by entering a plea seeking judgment from the court.&lt;ref&gt;Sir [[Sir Frederick Pollock, 1st Baronet|Frederick Pollock]] and [[Frederic William Maitland]], ''[[The History of English Law]]'', v. 2, pp. 650–651 (Cambridge; 1968; {{ISBN|0-521-07062-7}})&lt;/ref&gt; Obviously, a [[criminal justice]] system that punished only those who volunteered for punishment was unworkable; this was the means chosen to coerce them.&lt;ref&gt;See generally, [[William Blackstone]], ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'' (1769), vol. 4, pp. *319-324&lt;/ref&gt;

Many defendants charged with capital offences nonetheless refused to plead, since thereby they would escape forfeiture of property, and their heirs would still inherit their estate; but if the defendant pleaded guilty and was executed, their heirs would inherit nothing, their property [[escheat]]ing to the Crown. ''Peine forte et dure'' was abolished in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] in 1772, and the last known use of the practice was in 1741.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsu.edu/~crimdo/forfeiture.html Drug Control and Asset Seizures: a review of the history of forfeiture in England and colonial America] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970428075512/http://www.fsu.edu/~crimdo/forfeiture.html |date=28 April 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1772, refusing to plead was deemed to be equivalent to pleading guilty. This was changed in 1827 to being deemed a plea of not guilty. Today, in all common law jurisdictions, standing mute is treated by the courts as equivalent to a plea of not guilty.

The elaborate procedure was recorded by a 15th-century witness in an oft-quoted description: "he will lie upon his back, with his head covered and his feet, and one arm will be drawn to one quarter of the house with a cord, and the other arm to another quarter, and in the same manner it will be done with his legs; and let there be laid upon his body iron and stone, as much as he can bear, or more ..."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=veURAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA219&amp;dq=%22laid+in+some+low+dark+house%22#PPA218,M1 Curiosities of Cowell's "Interpreter"]&lt;/ref&gt;

"Pressing to death" might take several days, and not necessarily with a continued increase in the load. The Frenchman Guy Miege, who from 1668 taught languages in London&lt;ref&gt;[http://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:ed89c430-0517-4065-b717-0243fd11b368 The enterprising and tenacious Guy Miège: four dictionaries from 1677 to 1688]&lt;/ref&gt; says the following about the English practice:&lt;ref&gt;Miege, G.:"[https://books.google.no/books?id=b3gZAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=editions:Pu8Sknlj31oC&amp;hl=no&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VAMaUeXcJ8jR4QSm1YGoCg&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The present state of Great-Britain and Ireland]" London 1715, p.294&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote| For such as stand Mute at their Trial, and refuse to answer Guilty, or Not Guilty, Pressing to Death is the proper Punishment. In such a Case the Prisoner is laid in a low dark Room in the Prison, all naked but his Privy Members, his Back upon the bare Ground his Arms and Legs stretched with Cords, and fastned to the several Quarters of the Room. This done, he has a great Weight of Iron and Stone laid upon him. His Diet, till he dies, is of three Morsels of Barley bread without Drink the next Day; and if he lives beyond it, he has nothing daily, but as much foul Water as he can drink three several Time , and that without any Bread: Which grievous Death some resolute Offenders have chosen, to save their Estates to their Children. But, in case of High Treason, the Criminal's Estate is forfeited to the Sovereign, as in all capital Crimes, notwithstanding his being pressed to Death.}}

[[File:Giles Corey restored.jpg|thumb|Giles Corey was pressed to death during the Salem Witch Trials in the 1690s.]]
The most famous case in the United Kingdom was that of [[Roman Catholic]] [[martyr]] [[Margaret Clitherow|St Margaret Clitherow]], who (in order to avoid a trial in which her own children would be obliged to give evidence) was pressed to death on March 25, 1586, after refusing to plead to the charge of having harboured Catholic (then outlawed) [[priest]]s in her house. She died within fifteen minutes under a weight of at least 700 pounds (320&amp;nbsp;kg). Several hardened criminals, including William Spigott (1721) and Edward Burnworth, lasted a half hour under 400 pounds (180&amp;nbsp;kg) before pleading to the indictment. Others, such as Major Strangways (1658) and John Weekes (1731), refused to plead, even under 400 pounds (180&amp;nbsp;kg), and were killed when bystanders, out of mercy, sat on them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lhr/23.2/mckenzie.html |title=Mackenzie, The Practise of Peine Forte et Dure in 16th and 17th Century England |access-date=29 May 2009 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120801195952/www.historycooperative.org/journals/lhr/23.2/mckenzie.html |archive-date=1 August 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only death by ''peine forte et dure'' in American history was [[Giles Corey]], who was pressed to death on September 19, 1692, during the [[Salem witch trials]], after he refused to enter a plea in the judicial proceeding. According to legend, his last words as he was being crushed were "More weight", and he was thought to be dead as the weight was applied. This is referred to in Arthur Miller's political drama ''[[The Crucible]]'' (1953), where Giles Corey is pressed to death after refusing to plead "aye or nay" to the charge of witchcraft. In the [[The Crucible (1996 film)|1996 film version of this play]], the screenplay also written by Arthur Miller, Corey is crushed to death for refusing to reveal the name of a source of information.

In medieval Europe, the slow crushing of body parts in screw-operated "bone vises" of iron was a common method of torture, and a tremendous variety of cruel instruments were used to savagely crush the head, the knee, the hand, and, most commonly, either the thumb or the naked foot. Such instruments were finely threaded and variously provided with spiked inner surfaces or heated red-hot before their application to the limb to be tortured.

Research on the dark triad is used in [[applied psychology]], especially within the fields of [[law enforcement]], [[clinical psychology]], and [[business management]]. People scoring high on these traits are more likely to commit crimes, cause social distress and create severe problems for an organization, especially if they are in leadership positions (for more information, see [[Psychopathy in the workplace|psychopathy]], [[Narcissism in the workplace|narcissism]], and [[Machiavellianism in the workplace]]).

All three dark triad traits are conceptually distinct although empirical evidence shows them to be overlapping. They are associated with a callous-manipulative interpersonal style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jones, D. N., Paulhus, D.

A [[factor analysis]] carried out at the [[Glasgow Caledonian University]] found that among the [[big five personality traits]], low [[agreeableness]] is the strongest correlate of the dark triad, while [[neuroticism]] and a lack of [[conscientiousness]] were associated with some of the dark triad members.&lt;ref name=Jakobwitz/&gt;

==History==
{{See also|History of narcissism|History of psychopathy}}
In 1998, McHoskey, Worzel, and Szyarto&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=McHoskey J. W.|author2=Worzel W.|author3=Szyarto C.| year = 1998| title = Machiavellianism and psychopathy| url =| journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology| volume = 74| issue = 1| pages = 192–210| doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.74.1.192| pmid = 9457782 }}&lt;/ref&gt; provoked a controversy by claiming that narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy are more or less interchangeable in normal samples. [[Delroy L. Paulhus]] and McHoskey debated these perspectives at a subsequent [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) conference, inspiring a body of research that continues to grow in the published literature. Paulhus and Williams found enough behavioral, personality, and cognitive differences between the traits to suggest that they were distinct constructs; however, they concluded that further research was needed to elucidate how and why they overlap.&lt;ref name="Paulhus &amp; Williams 2002"/&gt;

==Origins==
The long-debated "[[nature versus nurture]]" issue has been applied to the dark triad. Research has begun to investigate the origins of the dark triad traits. In a similar manner to research on the [[Big Five personality traits]], empirical studies have been conducted in an effort to understand the relative contributions of biology (nature) and environmental factors (nurture) in the development of dark triad traits.

One of the ways in which researchers attempt to dissect the relative influence of genetic and environmental factors on personality (and individual differences more generally) is a broad investigative technique loosely grouped under the heading of "twin studies". For example, in one approach to twin studies,&lt;ref name="Petrides, Vernon, Schermer, Veselka 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Petrides |first1=K. V. |last2=Vernon |first2=Philip A. |last3=Schermer |first3=Julie Aitken |last4=Veselka |first4=Livia |title=Trait Emotional Intelligence and the Dark Triad Traits of Personality |journal=Twin Research and Human Genetics |date=February 2011 |volume=14 |issue=01 |pages=35–41 |doi=10.1375/twin.14.1.35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vernon, Martin, Schermer, Mackie 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vernon |first1=Philip A. |last2=Martin |first2=Rod A. |last3=Schermer |first3=Julie Aitken |last4=Mackie |first4=Ashley |title=A behavioral genetic investigation of humor styles and their correlations with the Big-5 personality dimensions |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |date=April 2008 |volume=44 |issue=5 |pages=1116–1125 |doi=10.1016/j.paid.2007.11.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name = "Vernon, Villani, Vickers, Harris 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vernon|first1=P.A.|last2=Villani|first2=V.C.|last3=Vickers|first3=L.C.|last4=Harris|first4=J.A.|title=A behavioral genetic investigation of the Dark Triad and the Big 5|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|date=2008|volume=44|issue=2|pages=445–452|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2007.09.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; researchers compare the personality scores of monozygotic (MZ) or identical twins reared together to dizygotic (DZ) or fraternal twins reared together. Because both types of twins in this design are reared together, all twin pairs are regarded as having shared a 100% common environment. In contrast, the monozygotic twins share 100% of their genes whereas the dizygotic twins only share about 50% of their genes. Therefore, for any given personality trait, it is possible to parcel out genetic influences by first obtaining the MZ correlation (reflecting 100% common environment and 100% shared genes) and subtracting the DZ correlation (reflecting 100% common environment and 50% shared genes). This difference represents 50% of the genetic influence; doubled, this number is said to account for 100% of the genetic influence, and is one way to derive an index of heritability (sometimes called the heritability coefficient and represented as h&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Similarly, MZ - h&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; may be regarded as an estimate of the influence of the common environment. Finally, because individual differences and the environment are supposed to account for the totality of behavior, it is said that subtracting the sum of h&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and the common environment influence from 1 is equal to the influence of unique or non-shared environments.

===Biological===
All three traits of the dark triad have been
found to have substantial genetic components.&lt;ref name="Petrides, Vernon, Schermer, Veselka 2011"/&gt; It has also been found that the observed relationships among the dark triad, and among the dark triad and the Big Five, are strongly driven by individual differences in genes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Furnham|first1=A.|last2=Richards|first2=S.C.|last3=Paulhus|first3=D.L.|title=The Dark Triad of personality: A 10 year review|journal=Social and Personality Psychology Compass|date=2013|volume=7|issue=3|pages=199–216|doi=10.1111/spc3.12018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while psychopathy (h&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.64) and narcissism (h&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.59) both have a relatively large heritable component, Machiavellianism (h&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.31) has been found to be less heritable.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Vernon, Villani, Vickers, Harris 2008"/&gt;

===Environmental===
Compared to biological factors, the influence of environmental factors seem to be more subtle and account for less—yet still significant—variation in individual differences as related to the development of dark triad traits.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The influence of non-shared or unique environmental factors (definition and mathematical derivation included above at the end of the "Origins" subsection) accounts for a significant amount of the variance in all 3 dark triad traits (narcissism = 0.41, Machiavellianism = 0.30, psychopathy = 0.32), whereas only Machiavellianism (r = 0.39) has been found to be significantly related to a shared environmental factor.&lt;ref name="Vernon, Martin, Schermer, Mackie 2008"/&gt; Although it requires substantiation, some researchers have interpreted this latter finding (along with the comparatively lower heritability noted in the section above) to mean that Machiavellianism is the most likely dark triad trait to be influenced by experience.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=Daniel N. |last2=Paulhus |first2=Delroy L. |title=The role of impulsivity in the Dark Triad of personality |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |date=October 2011 |volume=51 |issue=5 |pages=679–682 |doi=10.1016/j.paid.2011.04.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the very least, this notion about the modifiability of Machiavellianism does make some sense insofar as that the less variance there is attributable to genetic factors, the more variance there must be attributable to other factors, and "other" factors have traditionally been synopsized as environmental or experiential in nature.

===Evolutionary===
[[Evolutionary theory|Evolutionary]] [[Scientific theory|theory]] may also explain the development of dark triad traits. It has been argued that evolutionary behavior predicts not only the development of dark triad personalities, but also the flourishing of such personalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mealey|first1=L.|title=The sociobiology of sociopathy: An integrated evolutionary model|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date=1995|volume=18|issue=03|pages=523–541|doi=10.1017/s0140525x00039595}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, it has been found that individuals demonstrating dark triad personality can be highly successful in society.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; However, this success is typically short-lived.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The main evolutionary argument behind the dark triad traits emphasizes mating strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jonason|first1=P.K.|last2=Webster|first2=G.D.|last3=Schmitt|first3=D.P.|title=The dark triad: Facilitating a short-term mating strategy in men|journal=European Journal of Personality|date=2009|volume=23|issue=1|pages=5–18|doi=10.1002/per.698}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brumbach|first1=B.H.|last2=Figueredo|first2=A.J.|last3=Ellis|first3=B.J.|title=Effects of harsh and unpredictable environments in adolescence on development of life history strategies|journal=Human Nature|date=2009|volume=20|issue=1|pages=25–51|doi=10.1007/s12110-009-9059-3|pmc=2903759}}&lt;/ref&gt; This argument focuses on the notion of life history strategy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rushton|first1=J.P.|title=Differential K theory: The sociobiology of individual and group differences|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|date=1985|volume=6|issue=4|pages=441–452|doi=10.1016/0191-8869(85)90137-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Life history strategy proposes that individuals differ in reproductive strategies; an emphasis on mating is termed a "fast life" strategy, while an emphasis on parenting is termed a "slow reproductive" strategy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; There is some evidence &lt;ref name="Jonason, Tost 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jonason |first1=Peter K. |last2=Tost |first2=Jeremy |title=I just cannot control myself: The Dark Triad and self-control |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |date=October 2010 |volume=49 |issue=6 |pages=611–615 |doi=10.1016/j.paid.2010.05.031}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jonason, Koenig, Tost 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jonason |first1=Peter K. |last2=Koenig |first2=Bryan L. |last3=Tost |first3=Jeremy |title=Living a fast life: The Dark Triad and Life History Theory |journal=Human Nature |date=19 November 2010 |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=428–442 |doi=10.1007/s12110-010-9102-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the dark triad traits are related to fast life history strategies; however, there have been some mixed results, and not all three dark triad traits have been related to this strategy. A more detailed approach&lt;ref name="McDonald, Donnellan, Navarrete 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McDonald |first1=Melissa M. |last2=Donnellan |first2=M. Brent |last3=Navarrete |first3=Carlos David |title=A life history approach to understanding the Dark Triad |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |date=April 2012 |volume=52 |issue=5 |pages=601–605 |doi=10.1016/j.paid.2011.12.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; has attempted to account for some of these mixed results by analyzing the traits at a finer level of detail. These researchers found that while some components of the dark triad are related to a fast life strategy, other components are related to slow reproductive strategies.&lt;ref name="McDonald, Donnellan, Navarrete 2012"/&gt;

===Sub-clinical dimensions vs. disorders===
{{See also|Personality disorder}}
In general, clinicians treat these traits as [[pathological]], something that needs to be treated, and inherently undesirable, e.g. socially condemned or personally counter-productive. However, others argue that adaptive qualities may accompany the maladaptive ones. The evolutionary perspective (above) considers the dark triad to represent different mating strategies. Their frequency in the gene pool requires at least some local adaptation.

The everyday versions of these traits appear in student and community samples, where even high levels can be observed among individuals who manage to get along in daily life. Even in these samples, research indicates correlations with [[aggression]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jones D.N.|author2=Paulhus D.

Narcissism was discussed in the writings of [[Sigmund Freud]], and psychopathy as a clinical diagnosis was addressed in the early writings of [[Hervey Cleckley]] in 1941 with the publication of ''[[The Mask of Sanity]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cleckly, H.&amp;nbsp;C. (1941). The Mask of Sanity: An Attempt to Reinterpret the So-Called Psychopathic Personality. St.&amp;nbsp;Louis, MO: Mosby.&lt;/ref&gt; Given the dimensional model of narcissism and psychopathy, complemented by self-report assessments that are appropriate for the general population, these traits can now be studied at the subclinical level.&lt;ref&gt;LeBreton, J. M., Binning, J. F., &amp; Adorno, A. J. (2005). Sub-clinical psychopaths. In D. L. Segal &amp; J. C. Thomas (Eds.), Comprehensive handbook of personality and psychopathology: Vol. 1. Personality and everyday functioning (pp. 388–411). New York: John Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; In the general population, the prevalence rates for sub-clinical and clinical psychopathy are estimated at around 1% and 0.2%, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Babiak| first1 = P.| last2 = Neumann| first2 = C.

With respect to empirical research, psychopathy was not formally studied until the 1970s with the pioneering efforts of [[Robert D. Hare|Robert Hare]], his [[Psychopathy Checklist]] (PCL), and its revision (PCL-R).&lt;ref&gt;Hare, R.D., (1991). The Hare Psychopathy Checklist-Revised. Toronto: Multi-Health Systems.&lt;/ref&gt; Hare notes in his book, ''Without Conscience'' &lt;ref&gt;Hare, R. D. (1999). ''Without conscience: The disturbing world of the psychopaths among us''. New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; that asking psychopaths to self-report on psychologically important matters does not necessarily provide accurate or unbiased data. However, recent efforts have been made to study psychopathy in the dimensional realm using self-reported instruments, as with the Levenson Primary and Secondary Psychopathy Scales,&lt;ref name="Levenson M. R., Kiehl K. A., Fitzpatrick C. M. 1995 151–58"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Levenson M. R.|author2=Kiehl K. A.|author3=Fitzpatrick C.

(2015). Manual for the Self-Report Psychopathy scales (4th ed.). Toronto, Canada: Multi-Health Systems.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, assessment of narcissism required clinical interviews, until the popular "[[Narcissistic Personality Inventory]]" was created by Raskin and Hall in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Raskin R.|author2=Hall C.

(1994). Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire-4 (Unpublished test). New York: NYSPI.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, new instruments have been developed to study "pathological" narcissism &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Pincus A. L.|author2=Ansell E.

Machiavellianism has never been referenced in any version of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM) for psychological disorders. It has been treated as strictly a personality construct. The original published version of the Mach-IV &lt;ref&gt;Christie, R., &amp; Geis, F.&amp;nbsp;L. (1970). Studies in Machiavellianism. New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; is still the most widely used in empirical research.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, D.&amp;nbsp;N., &amp; Paulhus, D.&amp;nbsp;L. (2009). Machiavellianism. In M.&amp;nbsp;R.

As noted previously, there is a good deal of conceptual and empirical overlap between the dark triad traits. For example, researchers have noted that all three traits share characteristics such as a lack of empathy,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; interpersonal hostility,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lynam|first1=D.R.|last2=Gaughan|first2=E.T.|title=Assessing the basic traits associated with psychopathy: Development and validation of the Elemental Psychopathy Assessment|journal=Psychological Assessment|date=2011|volume=23|issue=1|doi=10.1037/a0021146}}&lt;/ref&gt; and interpersonal offensiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Egan|first1=V.|last2=McCorkindale|first2=C.|title=Narcissism, vanity, personality and mating effort|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|date=2007|volume=43|issue=8|pages=2105–2115|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2007.06.034}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likely due in part to this overlap, a number of measures have recently been developed that attempt to measure all three dark triad traits simultaneously, such as the Dirty Dozen &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jonason |first1=Peter K. |last2=Webster |first2=Gregory D. |title=The dirty dozen: A concise measure of the dark triad. |journal=Psychological Assessment |date=2010 |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=420–432 |doi=10.1037/a0019265}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the short dark triad (SD3).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=D.N.|last2=Paulhus|first2=D.L.|title=Introducing the Short Dark Triad (SD3) A Brief Measure of Dark Personality Traits|journal=Assessment|date=2014|volume=21|issue=1|pages=28–41|doi=10.1177/1073191113514105}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
At their root, however, most of these measures are questionnaire-style and require either self-response or observer-response (e.g., ratings from supervisors or coworkers). Both methods can prove problematic when attempting to measure any socially aversive trait as self-responders may be motivated to deceive.&lt;ref name="social exchange perspective 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Boyle|first1=E.H.|last2=Forsyth|first2=D.R.|last3=Banks|first3=G.C.|last4=McDaniel|first4=M.A.|title=A meta-analysis of the dark triad and work behavior: A social exchange perspective|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|date=2012|volume=97|issue=3|pages=557–79|doi=10.1037/a0025679|pmid=22023075|url=https://zenodo.org/record/850152|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170827205904/https://zenodo.org/record/850152|archivedate=2017-08-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more specific confound might also exist for dark triad traits and Machiavellianism in particular: individuals who are skilled at deceiving and manipulating others should be perceived as low in deceptiveness and manipulation by others, and are therefore likely to receive inaccurate ratings.&lt;ref name="social exchange perspective 2012"/&gt;
	
Despite these criticisms and the acknowledged commonalities among the dark triad traits, there is evidence that the constructs are related yet distinct.

===Machiavellianism===
Named after the philosophy espoused by Niccolò Machiavelli in ''[[The Prince]]'', people who score high on this trait are cynical (in an amoral self-interest sense, not in a doubtful or skeptical sense), unprincipled, believe in interpersonal manipulation as the key for life success, and behave accordingly.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Scores on measures of [[Machiavellianism]] correlate negatively with [[agreeableness]] (r= -.47) and [[conscientiousness]] (r=-.34).&lt;ref name="Paulhus &amp; Williams 2002"/&gt; Machiavellianism is also significantly correlated with [[psychopathy]].&lt;ref name="Vernon, Villani, Vickers, Harris 2008"/&gt;

===Narcissism===
Individuals who score high on [[narcissism]] display grandiosity, entitlement, dominance, and superiority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Corry|first1=N.|last2=Merritt|first2=R.D.|last3=Mrug|first3=S.|last4=Pamp|first4=B.|title=The factor structure of the Narcissistic Personality Inventory|journal=Journal of Personality Assessment|date=2008|volume=90|issue=6|pages=593–600|doi=10.1080/00223890802388590}}&lt;/ref&gt; Narcissism has been found to correlate positively with [[extraversion]] (r = .42) and [[openness]] (r = .38) and negatively with [[agreeableness]] (r = -.36).&lt;ref name="Paulhus &amp; Williams 2002"/&gt; Narcissism has also been found to have a significant correlation with [[psychopathy]].&lt;ref name="Vernon, Villani, Vickers, Harris 2008"/&gt;

===Psychopathy===
Considered the most malevolent of the dark triad,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rauthmann|first1=J.F.|title=The Dark Triad and interpersonal perception: Similarities and differences in the social consequences of narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy|journal=Social Psychological and Personality Science|date=2012|volume=3|issue=4|pages=487–496|doi=10.1177/1948550611427608}}&lt;/ref&gt; individuals who score high on [[psychopathy]] show low levels of empathy combined with high levels of impulsivity and thrill-seeking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hare|first1=R.D.|title=Comparison of procedures for the assessment of psychopathy|journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|date=1985|volume=53|issue=1|pages=7–16|doi=10.1037/0022-006x.53.1.7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The similarity between psychopathy and [[antisocial personality disorder]] have been noted by some researchers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Psychopathy has been found to correlate with all of the Big Five personality factors: [[extraversion]] (r = .34), [[agreeableness]] (r = -.25), [[conscientiousness]] (r = -.24), [[neuroticism]] (r = -.34) and [[openness]] (r = .24).&lt;ref name="Vernon, Villani, Vickers, Harris 2008"/&gt;

==Group differences==
The most pronounced group difference is in gender: numerous studies have shown that men tend to score higher than women on narcissism,&lt;ref name="Egos inflating over time 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Twenge |first1=Jean M. |last2=Konrath |first2=Sara |last3=Foster |first3=Joshua D. |last4=Keith Campbell |first4=W. |last5=Bushman |first5=Brad J. |title=Egos Inflating Over Time: A Cross-Temporal Meta-Analysis of the Narcissistic Personality Inventory |journal=Journal of Personality |date=August 2008 |volume=76 |issue=4 |pages=875–902 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.2008.00507.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Machiavellianism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chonko|first1=L.B.|title=).

R., Kiehl K. A., Fitzpatrick C. M. 1995 151–58"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lilienfeld S. O., Andrews B. P. 1996 488–524"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cale|first1=E.M.|last2=Lilienfeld|first2=S.O.|title=Sex differences in psychopathy and antisocial personality disorder: A review and integration|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|date=2002|volume=22|issue=8|pages=1179–1207|doi=10.1016/s0272-7358(01)00125-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zagon|first1=I.K.|last2=Jackson|first2=H.J.|title=Construct validity of a psychopathy measure|journal=Journal of Personality and Individual Differences|date=1994|pages=125–135}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the magnitude of the difference varies across traits and the measurement instruments used. One interesting finding related to narcissism—albeit one based on non-representative samples—is that while men continue to score higher than women, it seems that the gender gap has shrunk considerably when comparing cohort data from 1992 and 2006. More specifically, the aforementioned findings indicate that there has been a general increase in levels of narcissism over time among college students of both sexes, but comparatively, the average level of narcissism in women has increased more than the average level of narcissism in men.&lt;ref name="Egos inflating over time 2008"/&gt;
 
There is far less information available on race differences in dark triad traits, and the data that is available is not representative of the population at-large. For instance, a 2008 research study using undergraduate participants found that Caucasians reported higher levels of narcissism relative to Asians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trzesniewski|first1=K.H.|last2=Donnellan|first2=M.B.|title=Do today's young people really think they are so extraordinary? An examination of secular trends in narcissism and self-enhancement|journal=Psychological Science|date=2008|volume=19|issue=2|pages=181–188|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02065.x|pmid=18271867}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Twenge|first1=J.M.|last2=Foster|first2=J.D.|title=Mapping the scale of the narcissism epidemic: Increases in narcissism 2002–2007 within ethnic groups|journal=Journal of Research in Personality|date=2008|volume=42|issue=6|pages=1619–1622|doi=10.1016/j.jrp.2008.06.014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, another 2008 study using undergraduate participants found that Caucasians tended to score slightly higher than non-Caucasians on Machiavellianism.&lt;ref name="new Machiavellianism scale"/&gt; When attempting to discern whether there are ethnic differences in psychopathy, researchers have addressed the issue using different measurement instruments (e.g., the Self-Report Psychopathy Scale and The Psychopathic Personality Inventory), but no race differences have been found regardless of the measure used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Epstein|first1=M.K.|last2=Poythress|first2=N.G.|last3=Brandon|first3=K.O.|title=The Self-Report Psychopathy Scale and Passive Avoidance Learning A Validation Study of Race and Gender Effects|journal=Assessment|date=2006|volume=13|issue=2|pages=197–207|doi=10.1177/1073191105284992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lander|first1=G.C.|last2=Lutz-ZOis|first2=C.J.|last3=Rye|first3=M.S.|last4=Goodnight|first4=J.A.|title=The differential association between alexithymia and primary versus secondary psychopathy|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|date=2012|volume=52|issue=1|pages=45–50|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2011.08.027}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, when comparing Caucasians and African Americans from correctional, substance abuse, and psychiatric samples—groups with typically high prevalence rates of psychopathy—researchers again failed to find any meaningful group differences in psychopathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Skeem|first1=J.L.|last2=Edens|first2=J.F.|last3=Camp|first3=J.|last4=Colwell|first4=L.H.|title=Are there ethnic differences in levels of psychopathy?

Lynn proposes "that there are racial and ethnic differences in psychopathic personality conceptualised as a continuously distributed trait, such that high values of the trait are present in blacks and Native Americans, intermediate values in Hispanics, lower values in whites and the lowest values in East Asians."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http:// https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222191018_Racial_and_ethnic_differences_in_psychopathic_personality|title=Racial and ethnic differences in psychopathic personality
|website=Research Gate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The focal variable when analyzing generational or cohort differences in dark triad traits has tended to be narcissism, arising from the hypothesis that so-called “[[Generation Me]]” or “Generation Entitlement” would exhibit higher levels of narcissism than previous generations. Indeed, based on analyses of responses to the [[Narcissistic Personality Inventory]] collected from over 16,000 U.S. undergraduate students between 1979 and 2006, it was concluded that average levels of narcissism had increased over time.&lt;ref name="Egos inflating over time 2008"/&gt; Similar results were obtained in a follow-up study that analyzed the changes within each college campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Twenge|first1=J.M.|last2=Campbell|first2=W.K.|title=Birth Cohort Differences in the Monitoring the Future Dataset and Elsewhere Further Evidence for Generation Me—Commentary on Trzesniewski &amp; Donnellan|journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science|date=2010|volume=5|issue=1|pages=81–88|doi=10.1177/1745691609357015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trzesniewski &amp; Donnellan (2010)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trzesniewski|first1=K.H.|last2=Donnellan|first2=M.B.|title=Rethinking "Generation Me" a study of cohort effects from 1976–2006|journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science|date=2010|volume=5|issue=1|pages=58–75|doi=10.1177/1745691609356789}}&lt;/ref&gt; present conflicting evidence and argue that there have not been large changes in disposition or behavioral strategies across generations, although they do note that the current generation is less trusting and more cynical, which are both changes that might be indicative of an increase in Machiavellianism.

==Perspectives==

===In the workplace===
[[Oliver James (psychologist)|Oliver James]] identifies each of the three dark triadic personality traits as typically being prevalent in the [[workplace]] (see also [[Machiavellianism in the workplace]], [[narcissism in the workplace]] and [[psychopathy in the workplace]]).&lt;ref&gt;James O Office Politics: How to Thrive in a World of Lying, Backstabbing and Dirty Tricks (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Furnham &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The dark triad of personality: A ten year review|last = Furnham|first = Adrian|date = 2010|journal = Social and personality psychology compass|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; (2010) has identified that the dark triad is related to the acquisition of leadership positions and interpersonal influence. In a meta-analysis of dark triad and workplace outcomes, Jonason and colleagues (2012) found that each of the dark triad traits were related to manipulation in the workplace, but each via unique mechanisms. Specifically, Machiavellianism was related with the use of excessive charm in manipulation, narcissism was related with the use of physical appearance, and psychopathy was related with physical threats.&lt;ref name="Jonason, Slomski, Partyka 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jonason |first1=Peter K. |last2=Slomski |first2=Sarah |last3=Partyka |first3=Jamie |title=The Dark Triad at work: How toxic employees get their way |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |date=February 2012 |volume=52 |issue=3 |pages=449–453 |doi=10.1016/j.paid.2011.11.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonason and colleagues also found that the dark triad traits fully mediated the relationship between gender and workplace manipulation. The dark triad traits have also been found to be fairly well-represented in upper-level management and CEOs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Accounting as a facilitator of extreme narcissism|last = Amernic|first = J.|date = 2010|journal = Journal of Business Ethics|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet trolls===
{{Main article|Troll (Internet)}}
Recent studies have found that people who are identified as trolls tend to have dark personality traits and show signs of [[Antisocial personality disorder|sadism]], [[antisocial behavior]], psychopathy, and Machiavellianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buckels | first1 = E.E. | last2 = Trapnell | first2 = P.D. | last3 = Paulhus | first3 = D.L. | year = 2013 | title = Trolls Just Want to Have Fun | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences| doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2014.01.016 | volume=67 | pages=97–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/your-online-secrets/201409/internet-trolls-are-narcissists-psychopaths-and-sadists | title = Internet Trolls Are Narcissists, Psychopaths, and Sadists}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/science/2014/02/science-confirms-online-trolls-are-horrible-people-also-sadists/ | title = Science confirms: Online trolls are horrible people (also, sadists!) | date = 20 February 2014 | accessdate = 2 November 2016 | publisher = ''Ars Technica'' | author = Nate Anderson | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161104004119/http://arstechnica.com/science/2014/02/science-confirms-online-trolls-are-horrible-people-also-sadists/ | archivedate = 4 November 2016 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2013 case study suggested that there are a number of similarities between anti-social and [[Flaming (Internet)|flame]] trolling activities and the 2014 survey indicated that trolling is an Internet manifestation of [[Sadistic personality disorder|everyday sadism]]. Both studies suggest that this trolling may be linked to [[bullying]] in both adolescents and adults.

===As a mating strategy===
Studies have suggested that on average, those who exhibit the dark triad of personality traits have an [[r/K selection theory|accelerated mating strategy]], reporting more sex partners, more favorable attitudes towards casual sex,&lt;ref name="short-term mating"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jonason |first1=Peter K. |last2=Li |first2=Norman P. |last3=Webster |first3=Gregory D. |last4=Schmitt |first4=David P. |title=The dark triad: Facilitating a short-term mating strategy in men |journal=European Journal of Personality |date=February 2009 |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=5–18 |doi=10.1002/per.698}}&lt;/ref&gt; lowered standards in their short-term mates,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jonason |first1=Peter K. |last2=Valentine |first2=Katherine A. |last3=Li |first3=Norman P. |last4=Harbeson |first4=Carmelita L. |title=Mate-selection and the Dark Triad: Facilitating a short-term mating strategy and creating a volatile environment |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |date=October 2011 |volume=51 |issue=6 |pages=759–763 |doi=10.1016/j.paid.2011.06.025}}&lt;/ref&gt; a tendency to steal or poach mates from others,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jonason |first1=Peter K. |last2=Li |first2=Norman P. |last3=Buss |first3=David M. |title=The costs and benefits of the Dark Triad: Implications for mate poaching and mate retention tactics |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |date=March 2010 |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=373–378 |doi=10.1016/j.paid.2009.11.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; more risk-taking in the form of substance abuse,&lt;ref name="Jonason, Koenig, Tost 2010"/&gt; a tendency to prefer immediate but smaller amounts of money over delayed but larger amounts of money,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jonason | first1 = P.

The evidence is mixed regarding the exact link between the dark triad and reproductive success. For example, there is a lack of empirical evidence for reproductive success in the case of psychopathy.&lt;ref name="gap"/&gt; Additionally, these traits are not universally short-term-oriented&lt;ref name="Jonason, Tost 2010"/&gt; nor are they all impulsive.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Furthermore, much of the research reported pertaining to the dark triad cited in the above paragraph is based on statistical procedures that assume the dark triad are a single construct, in spite of genetic &lt;ref name = "Vernon, Villani, Vickers, Harris 2008"/&gt; and meta-analytic evidence to the contrary.&lt;ref name="social exchange perspective 2012"/&gt;

===Appearance===
Several academic studies have found evidence that people with dark triad personalities are judged as slightly better-looking than average on first sight.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Gregory Louis, Anne C. Campbell, Steven Muncer, "[http://scottbarrykaufman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/The-Dark-Triad-Personality.pdf The Dark Triad personality: Attractiveness to women] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226020227/http://scottbarrykaufman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/The-Dark-Triad-Personality.pdf |date=2015-02-26 }}", ''[[Elsevier]]/[[ScienceDirect]]'', 12 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Two studies have determined that this is because people with dark triad traits put more effort into their appearance, and the difference in attractiveness disappears when "dressed down" with bland clothing and without make up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grewel | first1 = Daisy | year = 2012 | title = Psychology Uncovers Sex Appeal of Dark Personalities | url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/psychology-uncovers-sex-appeal-dark-personalities/ | journal = [[Scientific American]] | volume =  | issue =  | page =  | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150825175428/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/psychology-uncovers-sex-appeal-dark-personalities/ | archivedate = 2015-08-25 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holtzman | first1 = Nicholas | year = 2012 | title = People With Dark Personalities Tend to Create a Physically Attractive Veneer | url = http://spp.sagepub.com/content/early/2012/10/02/1948550612461284.abstract?rss=1 | journal = [[Social Psychological and Personality Science]] | volume = 4 | issue =  | pages = 461–467 | doi = 10.1177/1948550612461284 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141229202404/http://spp.sagepub.com/content/early/2012/10/02/1948550612461284.abstract?rss=1 | archivedate = 2014-12-29 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two more studies found that only narcissistic subjects were judged to be better-looking, but the other dark triad traits of machiavellianism and psychopathy had no correlation with looks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 =  | first1 =  | year = 2013 | title = Are Narcissists Sexy?

==Related concepts==

=== Big Five ===
The [[Big Five personality traits|five factor model of personality]] has significant relationships with the dark triad combined and with each of the dark triad’s traits. The dark triad overall is negatively related to both [[agreeableness]] and [[conscientiousness]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; More specifically, Machiavellianism captures a suspicious versus trusting view of human nature which is also captured by the Trust sub-scale on the agreeableness trait.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Machiavellian beliefs and personality: Construct invalidity of the Machiavellianism dimension|last = Hunter|first = J.

W.|first3 = F. J.|last3 = Boster}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Extroversion]] captures similar aspects of assertiveness, dominance, and self-importance as narcissism.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Narcissism also is positively related to the achievement striving and competence aspects of Conscientiousness. Psychopathy has the strongest correlations with low dutifulness and deliberation aspects of Conscientiousness.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=== Honesty-humility ===
The [[Honesty-humility factor of the HEXACO model of personality|honesty-humility]] factor from the [[HEXACO model of personality structure|HEXACO]] model of personality is used to measure sincerity, fairness, greed avoidance, and modesty. Honesty-Humility has been found to be strongly, negatively correlated to the dark triad traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Aghababaei | first1 = N. | last2 = Mohammadtabar | first2 = S. | last3 = Saffarinia | first3 = M. | year = 2014 | title = Dirty Dozen vs. the H factor: Comparison of the Dark Triad and Honesty–Humility in prosociality, religiosity, and happiness | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 67 | issue = | pages = 6–10 | doi=10.1016/j.paid.2014.03.026}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, all three dark triad traits are strongly negatively correlated with Honesty-Humility.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The conceptual overlap of the three traits which represents a tendency to manipulate and exploit others for personal gain defines the negative pole of the honesty-humility factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = K. | last2 = Ashton | first2 = M.

A study found that individuals who score low in Honesty-Humility have higher levels of self-reported creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Cantankerous creativity: Honesty–Humility, Agreeableness, and the HEXACO structure of creative achievement|last = Silvia|first = P|date = 2011|journal = Personality and Individual Differences|doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2011.06.011|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Kaufman|first2 = J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dark tetrad===
Several researchers have suggested expanding the dark triad to contain a fourth dark trait. Everyday sadism, defined as the enjoyment of cruelty, is the most common addition.&lt;ref name="apa-sadism"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/releases/everyday-sadists-take-pleasure-in-others-pain.html|title=Everyday Sadists Take Pleasure In Others’ Pain|work=Association for Psychological Science|access-date=2018-05-26|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180527025804/https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/releases/everyday-sadists-take-pleasure-in-others-pain.html|archivedate=2018-05-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While sadism is highly correlated with the dark triad, researchers have shown that sadism predicts [[anti-social behavior]] beyond the dark triad.&lt;ref name="Contributions to juvenile delinquency"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buckels | first1 = E.E. | last2 = Jones | first2 = D.

===Vulnerable dark triad===
The vulnerable dark triad (VDT) comprises three related and similar constructs: vulnerable narcissism, factor 2 psychopathy, and [[borderline personality disorder]]. A study found that these three constructs are significantly related to one another and manifest similar [[nomological]] networks. Although the VDT members are related to negative emotionality and antagonistic interpersonal styles, they are also related to [[introversion]] and [[disinhibition]]. The study does note however that its findings are based largely on the self-reports of parents of White undergrad students rather than information gleaned from clinical evaluation.&lt;ref name="vdt"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://wkeithcampbell.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/VulnerableDarkTriad.pdf | title=Searching for a Vulnerable Dark Triad: Comparing Factor 2 Psychopathy, Vulnerable Narcissism, and Borderline Personality Disorder | author1=Miller, JD. | author2=Dir, A. | author3=Gentile, B. | author4=Wilson, L. | author5=Pryor, LR. | author6=Campbell, K. | journal=Journal of Personality | date=October 2010 | volume=78 | issue=5 | pages=1529–1564 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.2010.00660.x | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913131007/http://wkeithcampbell.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/VulnerableDarkTriad.pdf | archivedate=2014-09-13 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Malignant narcissism ===
Within the clinical/pathological realm, narcissism can manifest itself in a particularly severe form known as [[malignant narcissism]]. Malignant narcissism presents not only with signs and symptoms of grandiose narcissism, but also includes features of paranoia, sadism, aggression, and psychopathy (particularly antisocial behaviors).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/492228 Lenzenweger] M.F., Clarkin J.F., Caligor E., Cain N.M., &amp; Kernberg O.F.

A '''devil''' is the [[personification]] of [[evil]] as it is conceived in many and various cultures and religious traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Burton Russell ''The Devil: Perceptions of Evil from Antiquity to Primitive Christianity'' Cornell University Press 1987 {{ISBN|978-0-801-49409-3}} pages 11 &amp; 34&lt;/ref&gt; It is seen as the objectification of a hostile and destructive force.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Burton Russell. ''The Devil: Perceptions of Evil from Antiquity to Primitive Christianity’'. Cornell University Press 1987 {{ISBN|978-0-801-49409-3}} page 34&lt;/ref&gt;

It is difficult to specify a particular definition of any complexity that will cover all of the traditions, beyond that it is a manifestation of evil.  It is meaningful to consider the devil through the lens of each of the cultures and religions that have the devil as part of their mythos.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Burton Russell. ''The Devil: Perceptions of Evil from Antiquity to Primitive Christianity’'. Cornell University Press 1987 {{ISBN|978-0-801-49409-3}} p. 41-75&lt;/ref&gt; 

The history of this concept intertwines with theology, mythology, psychiatry, art and literature, maintaining a validity, and developing independently within each of the traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Burton Russell. ''The Devil: Perceptions of Evil from Antiquity to Primitive Christianity.'' Cornell University Press 1987 {{ISBN|978-0-801-49409-3}} page 44 &amp; 51&lt;/ref&gt; It occurs historically in many contexts and cultures, and is given many different names — [[Satan]], [[Lucifer]], [[Beelzebub]], [[Mephistopheles]] — and attributes: It is portrayed as blue, black, or red; It is portrayed as having horns on its head, and without horns, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;Arp, Robert. ''The Devil and Philosophy: The Nature of His Game''. Open Court, 2014. {{ISBN|9780812698800}} p. 30-50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Burton Russell. ''The Devil: Perceptions of Evil from Antiquity to Primitive Christianity'' Cornell University Press 1987 {{ISBN|978-0-801-49409-3}} page 66&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of the devil has been taken seriously often, but not always, for example when devil figures are used in advertising and on candy wrappers.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Burton Russell.'' The Devil: Perceptions of Evil from Antiquity to Primitive Christianity’'. Cornell University Press 1987 {{ISBN|978-0-801-49409-3}} page 41 &amp; 75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Jeffrey Burton.

== Etymology ==
The Modern English word ''[[:wikt:devil|devil]]'' derives from the [[Middle English]] ''[[wikt:devel|devel]]'', from [[Old English]] ''[[wikt:deofol|dēofol]]'', that in turn represents an early Germanic borrowing of [[Latin]] ''[[:wikt:diabolus|diabolus]]''. This in turn was borrowed from {{lang-el|[[:wikt:διάβολος|διάβολος]]}} ''diábolos'', "slanderer",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Ddia%2Fbolos διάβολος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; from {{lang|el|διαβάλλειν}} ''diabállein'', "to slander" from [[wikt:διά|διά]] ''diá'', "across, through" and βάλλειν ''bállein'', "to hurl", probably akin to the [[Sanskrit]] ''gurate'', "he lifts up".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/devil|title=Definition of DEVIL|website=www.merriam-webster.com|access-date=2016-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
In his book ''The Devil: Perceptions of Evil from Antiquity to Primitive Christianity'' [[Jeffrey Burton Russell]] discusses various meanings, and difficulties that are encountered when using the term ''Devil''.  He doesn’t claim to define the word in a general sense, but he describes the limited use that he intends for the word in his book — limited in order to “minimize this difficulty” and “for the sake of clarity”. In this book Russel uses the word ''Devil'' as "the [[personification]] of [[evil]] found in a variety of cultures", as opposed the word "[[Satan]]", which he reserves specifically for the figure in the [[Abrahamic religions]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Burton Russell ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=D2-Na937xRYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Devil:+Perceptions+of+Evil+from+Antiquity+to+Primitive+Christianity&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiGsLKW1qneAhVEzoMKHYZ_DXMQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Devil%3A%20Perceptions%20of%20Evil%20from%20Antiquity%20to%20Primitive%20Christianity&amp;f=false The Devil: Perceptions of Evil from Antiquity to Primitive Christianity]'' Cornell University Press 1987 {{ISBN|978-0-801-49409-3}} pages 11 &amp; 34&lt;/ref&gt;

In the introduction to his book, ''Satan: A Biography'', Henry Ansgar Kelly discusses various considerations and meanings that he has encountered in using terms such as ''devil'' and ''Satan'', etc. While not offering a general definition, he describes that in his book "whenever ''diabolos'' is used as the proper name of Satan", he signals it by using "small caps."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kelly|first=Henry Ansgar|date=2006|title=Satan: A Biography|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gPIpQg0lRbMC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=intitle:satan+inauthor:kelly#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|location=Cambridge, England|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521604024|pages=3–4|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' has a variety of definitions for the meaning of "devil", supported by a range of citations: "Devil" may refer to Satan, the supreme spirit of evil, or one of the Satan's emissaries or demons that populate Hell, or to one of the spirits that possess a demonic person; "devil" may refer to one of the "malignant deities" feared and worshiped by "heathen people", a demon, a malignant being of superhuman powers; figuratively “devil" may be applied to a wicked person, or playfully to a rogue or rascal, or in empathy often accompanied by the word “poor" to a person — "poor devil".&lt;ref&gt; Craige, W. A.; Onions, C. T. A. "Devil". ''A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles: Introduction, Supplement, and Bibliography''. Oxford: Clarendon Press. (1933) p. 283-284&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hinduism==
The earliest Hindu texts do not offer further explanations for evil, regarding evil as something natural.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Jeffrey Burton Russell ''The Devil: Perceptions of Evil from Antiquity to Primitive Christianity'' Cornell University Press 1987 {{ISBN|978-0-801-49409-3}} page 56&lt;/ref&gt; However, later texts offer various explanations for evil. According to an explanation given by the [[Brahmin]]s, both [[demons]] and gods spoke truth and untruth, but the demons relinquished the truth and the gods relinquished the untruth.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; But both [[spirits]] are regarded as different aspects of one supreme god. Even some fierce deities like [[Kali]] are not thought of as devils but just as darker aspects of God&lt;ref&gt;Seema Mohanty, Seema ''The Book of Kali'' Penguin Books India 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-143-06764-1}} page 115&lt;/ref&gt; and may even manifest benevolence.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

== Ancient Egypt ==
{{Main|Apep|Set (mythology)}}
Apep ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|p|ɛ|p|,_|ˈ|ɑː|-}}) or Apophis ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|p|ə|f|ᵻ|s}}; {{lang-grc|Ἄποφις}}; also spelled Apepi or Aapep) was the [[ancient Egyptian deity]] who embodied [[Chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]] (''[[Isfet (Egyptian mythology)|ı͗zft]]'' in Egyptian) and was thus the opponent of light and [[Ma'at]] (order/[[truth]]). He appears in [[Art of ancient Egypt|art]] as a giant serpent. His name is reconstructed by Egyptologists as *ʻAʼpāpī, as it was written ''ꜥꜣpp(y)'' and survived in later [[Coptic language|Coptic]] as {{coptic|Ⲁⲫⲱⲫ}} ''Aphōph''.&lt;ref name="Wörterbuch"&gt;[[Adolf Erman|Erman, Adolf]], and [[Hermann Grapow]], eds. 1926–1953. ''Wörterbuch der aegyptischen Sprache im Auftrage der deutschen Akademien''. 6 vols. Leipzig: J. C. Hinrichs'schen Buchhandlungen. (Reprinted Berlin: Akademie-Verlag GmbH, 1971).&lt;/ref&gt;

The deity Set was originally associated with both positive and negative roles: a protector of [[Ra]] on the solar boat from the Serpent of Chaos, and a [[usurper]] who killed and mutilated his brother in order to assume the throne. However, he was later [[Demonizing the enemy|demonized]] and he became quite unpopular. According to Herman te Velde, the demonization of Set took place after Egypt's conquest by several foreign nations in the [[Third Intermediate Period|Third Intermediate]] and [[Late Period of Ancient Egypt|Late Periods]]. Set, who had traditionally been the god of foreigners, thus also became associated with foreign oppressors, including the [[Assyria]]n and [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] empires. It was during this time that Set was particularly vilified, and his defeat by [[Horus]] widely celebrated. Set's negative aspects were emphasized during this period. Set was the killer of [[Osiris]], having hacked Osiris' body into pieces and dispersed it so that he could not be [[Resurrection|resurrected]]. The Greeks later linked Set with [[Typhon]] because both were evil forces, [[Weather god|storm deities]], and sons of the Earth that attacked the main gods.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Nevertheless, throughout this period, in some outlying regions of Egypt Set was still regarded as the heroic chief deity.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Set has also been classed as a [[Trickster]] deity who, as a god of disorder, resorts to deception to achieve bad ends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2009|title=The Trickster Revisited: Deception as a Motif in the Pentateuch|journal=Studies in Biblical Literature|volume=117|pages=16–17|author=Dean Andrew Nicholas|ISSN=1089-0645}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Zoroastrianism ==
{{Main|Angra Mainyu|Dualistic cosmology}}
[[Zoroastrianism]] probably introduced the first idea of the conceptual ''devil''; a principle of evil independently existing apart from God.&lt;ref name="Russell99"&gt;Jeffrey Burton Russell ''The Devil: Perceptions of Evil from Antiquity to Primitive Christianity'' Cornell University Press 1987 {{ISBN|978-0-801-49409-3}} page 99&lt;/ref&gt; In Zoroastrianism, good and evil derive from two ultimately opposed forces.&lt;ref&gt;John R. Hinnells ''The Zoroastrian Diaspora: Religion and Migration'' OUP Oxford 2005 {{ISBN|978-0-191-51350-3}} page 108&lt;/ref&gt; The force of good is called [[Ahura Mazda]] and the "destructive spirit" in [[Avestan language|Avestan-language]] called [[Angra Mainyu]]. The [[Middle Persian]] equivalent is [[Ahriman]]. They are in eternal struggle and neither is all-powerful, especially Angra Mainyu is limited to space and time: in the end of time, he will be finally defeated. While Ahura Mazda creates what is good, Angra Mainyu is responsible for every evil and suffering in the world, such as toads and scorpions.&lt;ref name="Russell99"/&gt;

== Buddhism ==
[[Buddhism]] contains a devil-like figure called [[Mara (demon)|Mara]]&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; ([[Sanskrit]]: ''māra''; {{CJKV|t=魔|s=魔|p=mó}}; Tibetan Wylie: ''bdud''; {{lang-km|មារ}}; {{lang-my|မာရ်နတ်}}; {{lang-th|มาร}}; {{lang-si|මාරයා}}), who is a tempter figure in Buddhism, distracting humans from practicing the spiritual life by making mundane things alluring, or the negative seem positive. He tempted [[Gautama Buddha]] by trying to seduce him with the vision of beautiful women who, in various legends, are often said to be [[Mara (demon)#Three daughters|Mara's daughters]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 4.25, entitled, "Māra's Daughters" (Bodhi, 2000, pp. 217-20), as well as [[Suttanipata|Sn]] 835 (Saddhatissa, 1998, page 98). In each of these texts, Mara's daughters (''Māradhītā'') are personified by sensual Craving (''[[taṇhā]]''), Aversion (''arati'') and Passion (''rāga'').&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Buddhist cosmology]], Mara personifies unwholesome impulses, unskillfulness, the "death"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nirvanadhamma.com/en/articles/hidden-danger-of-existence%21/higher-realms/mara-the-god-of-death/ Mara-the god of death]&lt;/ref&gt; of the spiritual life.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

== Tengrism ==
Among the [[Tengrism|Tengristic]] myths, [[Erlik]] refers to a devil-like figure as the ruler of [[Tamag|hell]], who is also the first human. According to one narrative, Erlik and God swam together over the primordial waters. When God was about to create the earth, he send Erlik to dive into the waters and collect some mud. Erlik hid inside his mouth to later create his own world. But when God commanded earth to expand Erlik got troubled by the earth in his mouth. God aided Erlik to spit it out. The earth carried by Erlik gave place to the unpleasant areas of the world. Because of his sin, he was assigned to evil. In another cariant, the creator-god is identified with [[Ulgen]]. Again, Erlik appears to be the first human. He desired to create a human just as Ulgen did, thereupon Ulgen reacted by punishing Erlik, casting him into the underworld there he becomes its ruler.&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade ''History of Religious Ideas, Volume 3: From Muhammad to the Age of Reforms'' University of Chicago Press, 31.12.2013 {{ISBN|9780226147727}} p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Adams Leeming ''A Dictionary of Creation Myths'' Oxford University Press 2014 {{ISBN|9780195102758}} p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Tengrism, there is no death by meaning that life comes to an end, it is merely a transition into the invisible world. As the ruler of hell, Erlik enslaves the souls, who are damned to hell. Further he lurks on the souls of those humans living on earth, by causing death, disease and illnesses. At time of birth, Erlik sends a [[Kormos]] to seize the soul of the new-born, following him the rest of his life in an attempt to seize his soul by hampering, misguide and injure him. When Erlik succeeds in destroying the a humans body, the Kormos sent by Erlik will try take him down into the underworld. However a good soul will be brought to paradise, by a ''Yayutshi'' sent by Ulgen.&lt;ref&gt;Plantagenet Publishing ''The Cambridge Medieval History Series volumes 1-5'' &lt;/ref&gt; Some shamans also made sacrifices to Erlik, for gaining a higher rank in the underworld, if they should be damned to hell.

{{Further|Satan#Judaism}}
[[Yahweh]], the god in pre-exilic [[Judaism]], created both good and evil, as stated in [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 45:7: "I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the Lord do all these things." The Devil did not exist in early Jewish scriptures. However, the influence of [[Zoroastrianism]] during the [[Achaemenid Empire]] introduced evil as a separate principle into the Jewish belief-system, which gradually externalized the opposition until the Hebrew term ''satan'' developed into a specific type of supernatural entity, changing the monistic view of Judaism into a dualistic one.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Burton Russell ''The Devil: Perceptions of Evil from Antiquity to Primitive Christianity'' Cornell University Press 1987 {{ISBN| 978-0-801-49409-3}} page 58&lt;/ref&gt; Later [[Rabbinic Judaism]] rejected{{when?|date=October 2018}} the [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah) | Enochian books]] (written during the [[Second Temple period]] under [[Persians|Persian]] influence), which depicted the Devil as an independent force of evil besides God.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, David R.

Christianity identifies the [[Devil in Christianity|Devil]] with the [[Serpents in the Bible|serpent]] who tempted [[Adam and Eve]] to eat the [[forbidden fruit]], and describes him as a [[fallen angel]] who terrorizes the world through evil,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; is the [[antithesis]] of [[God|Truth]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/devil|title=Definition of DEVIL|website=www.merriam-webster.com|access-date=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and shall be condemned, together with the fallen angels who follow him, to eternal fire at the [[Last Judgement]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In mainstream [[Christianity]] the devil is usually referred to as [[Satan]]. Some modern Christians {{Who|date=April 2016}} consider the devil to be an [[angel]] who, along with one-third of the angelic host (the demons) rebelled against [[God]] and has consequently been condemned to the [[Lake of Fire]]. He is described {{Attribution needed|date=April 2016}} as hating all humanity (or more accurately creation), opposing God, spreading lies and wreaking havoc on their souls.

Satan is often identified {{by whom|date=April 2016}} as the [[Serpent (Bible)|serpent]] who convinced [[Eve]] to eat the [[forbidden fruit]]; thus, Satan has often been depicted as a serpent. Although this identification is not present in the [[Adam and Eve]] narrative, this interpretation goes back at least as far as the time of the writing of the [[Book of Revelation]], which specifically identifies Satan as being the serpent (Rev. 20:2).

In the [[Bible]], the devil is identified with "the dragon" and "the old serpent" in the [[Book of Revelation]] 12:9, 20:2 have also been identified with Satan, as has "the prince of this world" in the [[Gospel of John]] 12:31, 14:30; and "the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience" in the [[Epistle to the Ephesians]] 2:2; and "the god of this world" in [[Second Epistle to the Corinthians|2 Corinthians]] 4:4.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Corinthians|2:2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also identified as the dragon in the [[Book of Revelation]] (e.g.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Bible (American Standard)/Revelation#Chapter 12|Rev. 12:9]]&lt;/ref&gt;), and the tempter of the [[Gospels]] (e.g.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#Chapter 4|Mat. 4:1]]&lt;/ref&gt;).

The devil is sometimes called [[Lucifer]], particularly when describing him as an angel before his fall, although the reference in [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 14:12 to Lucifer, or the Son of the Morning, is a reference to a Babylonian king.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the entries in [http://studylight.org/con/ntb/view.cgi?number=T3103 Nave's Topical Bible], the [http://studylight.org/dic/hbd/view.cgi?number=T3937 Holman Bible Dictionary] and the [http://studylight.org/com/acc/view.cgi?book=isa&amp;chapter=14&amp;verse=12#Isa14_12 Adam Clarke Commentary].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Beelzebub]] is originally the name of a [[Philistines|Philistine]] god (more specifically a certain type of [[Baal]], from ''Ba‘al Zebûb'', lit. "Lord of Flies") but is also used in the New Testament as a synonym for Satan. A corrupted version, "Belzeboub", appears in [[Divine Comedy|The Divine Comedy]] (Inferno XXXIV).

In other, non-mainstream, Christian beliefs (e.g. the beliefs of the [[Devil in Christianity#Unitarians and Christadelphians|Christadelphians]]) the word "satan" in the Bible is not regarded as referring to a supernatural, personal being but to any 'adversary' and figuratively refers to human sin and temptation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christadelphia.org/pamphlet/devil.htm |title=Do you Believe in a Devil?

[[File:Lion-faced deity.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A lion-faced deity found on a Gnostic gem in [[Bernard de Montfaucon]]'s ''L'antiquité expliquée et représentée en figures'' may be a depiction of the Demiurge.]]
Gnostic and Gnostic influenced religions repeatedly addressed the idea, that the material world is inherently evil. The ''One true God'' is far remote, beyond the material universe, therefore this universe must be gouverned by an inferior imposter deity. This deity was identified by some sects, such as the [[Sethianism|Sethians]] or the [[Marcionism|Marcions]], with the deity of the Old testament. [[Tertullian]] accuses [[Marcion of Sinope]], that he {{quote|
[held that] the Old Testament was a scandal to the faithful … and … accounted for it by postulating [that Jehovah was] a secondary deity, a [[Demiurge|demiurgus]], who was god, in a sense, but not the supreme God; he was just, rigidly just, he had his good qualities, but he was not the good god, who was Father of Our Lord Jesus Christ.&lt;ref name="Marcion"&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Marcionites}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} [[John Arendzen]] (1909) in the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] (1913) mentions that [[Eusebius]] accused [[Apelles (gnostic)|Apelles]], the 2nd-century AD Gnostic, of considering the Inspirer of Old-Testament prophecies to be not a god, but an evil angel.&lt;ref name="Apelles"&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Gnosticism}}&lt;/ref&gt; These writings commonly refer to the Creator of the material world as "a [[Demiurge|demiurgus]]".&lt;ref name="Marcion" /&gt; to distinguish him from the ''One true God''. Some texts, such as the ''[[Apocryphon of John]]'' and ''[[On the Origin of the World]]'' not only demonized the Creator God but also called him by the name of the devil in some Jewish writings, ''[[Samael]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Birger A.

=== Catharism ===
In the 12th century in Europe the [[Catharism|Cathars]], who were rooted in [[Gnosticism]], dealt with the problem of evil, and developed ideas of dualism and demonology. The Cathars were seen as a serious potential challenge to the Catholic church of the time. The Cathars split into two camps. The first is ''absolute'' dualism, which held that evil was completely separate from the good God, and that God and the devil each had power. The second camp is ''mitigated'' dualism, which considers [[Lucifer]] to be a son of God, and a brother to Christ. To explain this they used the parable of the prodigal son, with Christ as the good soon, and Lucifer as the son that strayed into evilness. The Catholic church responded to dualism in 1215 AD in the Fourth Lateran Council, saying that God created everything from nothing, and the Devil was good when he was created, but he made himself bad by his own free will.&lt;ref&gt;Rouner, Leroy (1983).

Muslims held that the [[Pre-Islamic Arabia|pre-Islamic]] [[Jinn]], [[Tutelary deity|tutelary deities]], became subject under [[Islam]] to the judgment of God, and that those who did not submit to the law of God are [[Shaitan|demons]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Jeffrey Burton Russell The Devil: Perceptions of Evil from Antiquity to Primitive Christianity Cornell University Press 1987 {{ISBN|978-0-801-49409-3}} page 58&lt;/ref&gt;

Like in Christianity, Iblis was once a pious creature of God, but later cast out of heaven, due to his pride. However, to maintain God's absolute sovereignty&lt;ref&gt;Amira El-Zein ''Islam, Arabs, and Intelligent World of the Jinn'' Syracuse University Press 2009 {{ISBN|9780815650706}} page 45&lt;/ref&gt;, Islam adopts the line taken by Irenaeus, instead of the later Christian consensus, that the Devil did not rebel against God, but against humanity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Burton Russell ''Lucifer: The Devil in the Middle Ages'' Cornell University Press 1986 {{ISBN|978-0-801-49429-1}} page 57&lt;/ref&gt; Further, although Iblis is generally regarded as a real bodily entity,&lt;ref&gt;Cenap Çakmak ''Islam: A Worldwide Encyclopedia [4 volumes]'' ABC-CLIO 2017 {{ISBN|978-1-610-69217-5}} page 1399&lt;/ref&gt; he plays a less significant role as the personification of evil than in Christianity. Iblis is merely a tempter, notable for inciting humans into sin by ''whispering'' into humans minds (waswās), akin to the Jewish idea of the Devil as ''[[yetzer hara]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Fereshteh Ahmadi, Nader Ahmadi ''Iranian Islam: The Concept of the Individual'' Springer 1998 {{ISBN|978-0-230-37349-5}} page 79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nils G.

On the other hand, ''Shaitan'' refers unilaterally to forces of evil, including the Devil Iblis, then he causes mischief.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/topic/shaitan&lt;/ref&gt; Shaitan is also linked to humans psychological nature, appearing in dreams, causing anger or interrupting the mental preparation for prayer.&lt;ref&gt;Cenap Çakmak ''Islam: A Worldwide Encyclopedia [4 volumes]'' ABC-CLIO 2017 {{ISBN|978-1-610-69217-5}} page 1399&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the term ''Shaitan'' also refers to beings, who follow the evil suggestions of Iblis. Furthermore, the principle of "Shaitan" is in many ways a symbol of spiritual impurity, representing humans own deficits, in contrast to a "[[Mumin|true Muslim]]", who is free from anger, lust and other devilish desires.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Gauvain ''Salafi Ritual Purity: In the Presence of God'' Routledge 2013 {{ISBN|9780710313560}} page 74&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In Sufism and Mysticsm ===
{{See also|Nafs}}
In contrast to ''Occidental philosophy'', the Sufi idea of seeing "Many as One" and considering the creation in their essence as the Absolute, leads to the idea of the dissolution of any dualism between the ego substance and the "external" substinantial objects. The rebellion against God, mentioned in the Quran, takes place on the level of the [[nafs|psyche]], that must be trained and disciplined for its union with the [[Ruh|spirit]] that is pure. Since psyche drives the body, ''flesh'' is not the obstacle to human, but an unawarness that allowed the impulsive forces to cause rebellion against God on the level of the psyche. Yet, it is not a dualism between body, psyche and spirit, since the spirit embraces both psyche and corperal aspects of human.&lt;ref&gt;Fereshteh Ahmadi, Nader Ahmadi ''Iranian Islam: The Concept of the Individual'' Springer 1998 {{ISBN|978-0-230-37349-5}} page 81-82&lt;/ref&gt; Since the world is hold as the mirror in which God's attributes are reflected, participation in worldly affairs is not necessarily seen as opposed to God.&lt;ref&gt;Fereshteh Ahmadi, Nader Ahmadi ''Iranian Islam: The Concept of the Individual'' Springer 1998 {{ISBN|978-0-230-37349-5}} page 79&lt;/ref&gt; The Devil activates the selfish desires of the psyche, leading him astray from the Divine.&lt;ref&gt;John O'Kane, Bernd Radtke ''The Concept of Sainthood in Early Islamic Mysticism: Two Works by Al-Hakim Al-Tirmidhi - An Annotated Translation with Introduction'' Routledge 2013 {{ISBN|978-1-136-79309-7}} page 48&lt;/ref&gt; Thus it is the  ''[[I (pronoun)|I]]'' that is regarded as evil, and both Iblis as well as [[Pharaohs in the Bible|''Pharao'']] are present as symbols for uttering "I" in ones own behavior. Therefore it is recommanded, to use the term ''I'' as rare as possible. It is only God who has the right to say "I", since it is only God, who is self-subsistent. Uttering "I" is therefore a way to compare oneselves to God, regarded as ''[[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J.

== Bahá'í Faith ==
In the [[Bahá'í Faith]], a malevolent, superhuman entity such as a ''devil'' or ''satan'' is not believed to exist.&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= satan |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 304}}&lt;/ref&gt; These terms do, however, appear in the Bahá'í writings, where they are used as metaphors for the lower nature of man. Human beings are seen to have [[free will]], and are thus able to turn towards God and develop spiritual qualities or turn away from God and become immersed in their self-centered desires. Individuals who follow the temptations of the self and do not develop spiritual virtues are often described in the Bahá'í writings with the word ''satanic''.&lt;ref name="smith" /&gt; The Bahá'í writings also state that the devil is a metaphor for the "insistent self" or "lower self" which is a self-serving inclination within each individual. Those who follow their lower nature are also described as followers of "the Evil One".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Bahá'u'lláh|author2=Baháʼuʼlláh| authorlink = Bahá'u'lláh| title = Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh Revealed After the Kitáb-i-Aqdas| url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/TB/tb-8.html#pg87| origyear = 1873–92| year = 1994| publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust| location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA| isbn = 0-87743-174-4| page = 87| chapter = Tablet of the World }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shoghi Effendi quoted in {{cite book| last = Hornby| first = Helen| title = Lights of Guidance: A Bahá'í Reference File| url = http://bahai-library.com/hornby_lights_guidance_2&amp;chapter=4#n1738| year = 1983| publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust, New Delhi, India| isbn = 81-85091-46-3| page = 513| editor = Hornby, Helen (Ed.) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some traditions, divinities can become demons.

[[File:Baphomet.png|thumb|upright|The [[Baphomet]], adopted symbol of some [[Left-Hand Path]] systems, including [[Theistic Satanism]].]]
In some religions and traditions, these titles are separate demons; others identify these names as guises of the devil. Even when thought of as individual demons, some are often thought of being under the Devil's direct control. This identifies only those thought of as the devil; [[List of theological demons|List of demons]] has a more general listing.

A '''digital timing diagram''' is a representation of a set of signals in the time domain. A timing diagram can contain many rows, usually one of them being the clock. It is a tool that is commonly used in digital electronics, hardware debugging, and digital communications. Besides providing an overall description of the timing relationships, the digital timing diagram can help find and diagnose digital logic [[hazard (logic)|hazards]].

==Diagram convention==
Most timing diagrams use the following conventions:
* Higher value is a logic one
* Lower value is a logic zero
* A slot showing a high and low is an either or (such as on a data line)
* A Z indicates [[high impedance]]
* A greyed out slot is a [[don't-care (logic)|don't-care]] or indeterminate.

==Example: SPI bus timing==
[[File:SPI timing diagram2.svg|thumb|400px|A timing diagram for the [[Serial Peripheral Interface Bus]]]]

The timing diagram example on the right describes the [[Serial Peripheral Interface Bus|Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) Bus]].
Most SPI master nodes have the ability to set the clock polarity (CPOL) and clock phase (CPHA) with respect to the data.
This timing diagram shows the clock for both values of CPOL and the values for the two data lines (MISO &amp; MOSI) for each value of CPHA.
Note that when CPHA=1 then the data is delayed by one-half clock cycle.

SPI operates in the following way:
* The master determines an appropriate CPOL &amp; CPHA value
* The master pulls down the [[slave select]] (SS) line for a specific slave chip
* The master clocks SCK at a specific frequency
* During each of the 8 clock cycles the transfer is [[full duplex]]:
** The master writes on the MOSI line and reads the MISO line
** The slave writes on the MISO line and reads the MOSI line
* When finished the master can continue with another [[byte]] transfer or pull SS high to end the transfer

When a slave's SS line is high then both of its MISO and MOSI line should be high impedance so to avoid disrupting a transfer to a different slave.
Prior to SS being pulled low, the MISO &amp; MOSI lines are indicated with a "z" for high impedance.
Also, prior to the SS being pulled low the "cycle #" row is meaningless and is shown greyed-out.

Note that for CPHA=1 the MISO &amp; MOSI lines are undefined until after the first clock edge and are also shown greyed-out before that.

A more typical timing diagram has just a single clock and numerous data lines

'''Dorothy Day''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Oblate#Secular oblates|OblSB]]}} (November 8, 1897 – November 29, 1980) was an American journalist, [[social activist]], and [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] convert. Day initially lived a [[bohemianism|bohemian]] lifestyle before gaining fame as a social activist after her [[religious conversion|conversion]]. She later became a key figure in the [[Catholic Worker Movement]]&lt;ref name=elie43&gt;Elie (2003), p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; and earned a national reputation as a [[political radicalism|political radical]],&lt;ref name=elie433&gt;Elie (2003), p. 433&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps the most famous radical in [[Catholic Church in the United States|American Catholic Church]] history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/day-by-day-a-saint-for-the-occupy-era |title=Day by Day; A Saint for the Occupy Era? |last1=Cannon |first1=Virginia |date=November 30, 2012 |website=The New Yorker |access-date=September 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Day's conversion is described in her autobiography, ''[[The Long Loneliness]]''.&lt;ref name=Benedict&gt;{{cite web |url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/audiences/2013/documents/hf_ben-xvi_aud_20130213.html |title=General Audience, 13 February 2013 |last1=Pope Benedict XVI |date=February 13, 2013 |website=Vatican |access-date=September 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=elie43&gt;Elie (2003), p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Day was also an active journalist, and described her social activism in her writings.  In 1917 she was imprisoned as a member of suffragist [[Alice Paul]]'s nonviolent [[Silent Sentinels]]. In the 1930s, Day worked closely with fellow activist [[Peter Maurin]] to establish the Catholic Worker Movement, a pacifist movement that combines direct aid for the poor and homeless with [[nonviolent direct action]] on their behalf. She practiced [[civil disobedience]], which led to additional arrests in 1955,&lt;ref name=elie237&gt;Elie (2003), pp. 236-237&lt;/ref&gt; 1957,&lt;ref name=elie279&gt;Elie (2003), pp. 279&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1973 at the age of seventy-five.&lt;ref name=elie433&gt;Elie (2003), p. 433&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the Catholic Worker Movement, Day co-founded the ''[[Catholic Worker]]'' newspaper in 1933, and served as its editor from 1933 until her death in 1980. In this newspaper, Day advocated the Catholic economic theory of [[distributism]], which she considered a third way between capitalism and socialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = G.K. Chesterton and Dorothy Day on Economics:Neither Socialism nor Capitalism (Distributism)|url = http://cjd.org/2001/10/01/g-k-chesterton-and-dorothy-day-on-economicsneither-socialism-nor-capitalism-distributism/|website = cjd.org|accessdate = October 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The ChesterBelloc Mandate: Dorothy Day and Distributism|url = http://distributist.blogspot.com/2007/02/dorothy-day-and-distributism.html|accessdate = October 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Pope Benedict XVI]] used her conversion story as an example of how to "journey towards faith... in a secularized environment."&lt;ref name=Benedict /&gt; [[Pope Francis]] included her in a short list of exemplary Americans, together with [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], and [[Thomas Merton]], in his address before the [[United States Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/speeches/2015/september/documents/papa-francesco_20150924_usa-us-congress.html |title=Visit to the Joint Session of the United States Congress |last1=Pope Francis |date=September 24, 2015 |website=Vatican |access-date=September 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Church has opened the cause for Day's possible [[canonization]], which was accepted by the [[Holy See]] for investigation. Due to this, the Church refers to her with the title of [[Servant of God]].

==Biography==

===Early years===
Dorothy May Day was born on November 8, 1897, in the [[Brooklyn Heights]] neighborhood of [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Prophets: Seven Religious Radicals and Their Struggle for Social and Political Justice|last=Raboteau|first=Albert J.|publisher=|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was born into a family described by one biographer as "solid, patriotic, and middle class".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Coles |first=Robert |title=Dorothy Day: A Radical Devotion|location=Reading, MA|publisher=Addison-Wesley|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, John Day, was a [[Tennessee]] native of [[Scots-Irish American|Irish]] heritage, while her mother, Grace Satterlee, a native of upstate New York, was of [[English people|English]] ancestry. Her parents were married in an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] church in [[Greenwich Village]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=William D.|title=Ray Rivera Lopez: A Biography|year=1982|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|location=NY|pages=1–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had three brothers and a sister. In 1904, her father, who was a sports writer devoted to horse racing, took a position with a newspaper in [[San Francisco]]. The family lived in [[Oakland, California]], until the [[San Francisco Earthquake of 1906]] destroyed the newspaper's facilities, and her father lost his job. From the spontaneous response to the earthquake's devastation, the self-sacrifice of neighbors in a time of crisis, Day drew a lesson about individual action and Christian community. The family relocated to [[Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=William D.|title=Dorothy Day: A Biography|year=1982|publisher=Harper &amp; Row |location=NY |pages=9–10, 13–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Day's parents were nominal Christians who rarely attended church. As a young child, she showed a marked religious streak, reading the Bible frequently. When she was ten she started to attend Church of Our Saviour, an Episcopal church in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago, after its [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] convinced her mother to let Day's brothers join the church [[choir]]. She was taken with the [[liturgy]] and its music. She studied the [[catechism]] and was [[baptism|baptized]] and [[confirmation|confirmed]] in that church in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forest|first=Jim|title=All is Grace: A Biography of Dorothy Day|year=2011 |publisher=Orbis Books|location=Maryknoll, NY|pages=14–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Day was an avid reader in her teens, particularly fond of [[Upton Sinclair]]'s ''[[The Jungle]]''. She worked from one book to another, noting [[Jack London]]'s mention of [[Herbert Spencer]] in ''Martin Eden'', and then from Spencer to Darwin and Huxley. She learned about anarchy and extreme poverty from [[Peter Kropotkin]], who promoted a belief in cooperation in contrast to Darwin's competition for survival.&lt;ref name="Miller 1982 27–8"&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=William D.|title=Dorothy Day: A Biography|year=1982|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|location=NY|pages=27–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also enjoyed [[Russian literature]] in university, especially [[Fyodor Dostoevsky|Dostoevsky]], [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]], and [[Maxim Gorky|Gorky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Day|first=Dorothy|title=The Long Loneliness: the autobiography of Dorothy Day|year=1981|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|location=San Francisco|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Day read a lot of socially conscious work, which gave her a background for her future; it helped bolster her support for and involvement in social activism.

In 1914, Day attended the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] on a scholarship. She was a reluctant scholar.&lt;ref name="coles2"/&gt; Her reading was chiefly in a Christian radical social direction.&lt;ref name="coles2"/&gt; She avoided campus social life, and supported herself rather than rely on money from her father, buying all her clothing and shoes from discount stores.&lt;ref name="bulletin11-29-80"&gt;{{cite news | title = Dorothy Day dead at 83 | url =https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1243&amp;dat=19801201&amp;id=s9ZYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yPYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4367,6238981 | work = [[The Bulletin (Bend)|The Bulletin]]| page = 61 | date = November 29, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; She left the university after two years, and moved to [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="coles2"&gt;Coles (1987), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social activism===
She settled on the [[Lower East Side]] and worked on the staff of several Socialist publications, including [[The Liberator (magazine)|''The Liberator'']],&lt;ref name="catholicworker022109"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.catholicworker.org/historytext.cfm?Number=4 | first = Tom | last = Cornell | title = A Brief Introduction to the Catholic Worker Movement | publisher = catholicworker.org | accessdate = February 21, 2009 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140314165158/http://www.catholicworker.org/historytext.cfm?Number=4 | archivedate = March 14, 2014 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Masses]]'', and ''[[New York Call|The Call]]''. She "smilingly explained to impatient socialists that she was 'a pacifist even in the class war.'"&lt;ref&gt;Vance, Laurence (December 4, 2006) [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/vance/vance98.html Bill Kauffman: American Anarchist], ''[[LewRockwell.com]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, Day described how she was pulled in different directions: "I was only eighteen, so I wavered between my allegiance to Socialism, [[Syndicalism]] (the [[Industrial Workers of the World|I.W.W.]]'s) and [[Anarchism]]. When I read [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]] I was an Anarchist.

She celebrated the [[February Revolution]] in Russia in 1917, the overthrow of the monarchy and establishment of a reformist government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forest|first=Jim|title=All is Grace: A Biography of Dorothy Day|year=2011 |publisher=Orbis Books|location=Maryknoll, NY|pages=32–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1917, she was arrested for picketing at the White House on behalf of women's suffrage as part of a campaign called the [[Silent Sentinels]] organized by [[Alice Paul]] and the [[National Women's Party]].

She spent several months in Greenwich Village, where she became close to [[Eugene O'Neill]], whom she later credited with having produced "an intensification of the religious sense that was in me".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forest|first=Jim|title=All is Grace: A Biography of Dorothy Day|year=2011 |publisher=Orbis Books|location=Maryknoll, NY|pages=44–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had a love affair of several years with [[Mike Gold]], a radical writer who later became a prominent Communist.&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt; She maintained friendships with such prominent American [[Communists]] as [[Anna Louise Strong]], and [[Elizabeth Gurley Flynn]], who became the head of the [[Communist Party USA]].

Initially Day lived a [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] life. In February 1921,&lt;ref&gt;http://ctstatelibrary.org/marriage-records/&lt;/ref&gt; after ending an unhappy love affair with Lionel Moise, and having an abortion that was "the great tragedy of her life,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wright|first=Terrence C.|title=Dorothy Day: An Introduction to Her Life and Thought|year=2018|publisher=Ignatius Press|location=San Francisco|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; she married Berkeley Tobey in a civil ceremony. She spent the better part of a year with him in Europe, removed from politics, focusing on art and literature, and writing a semi-autobiographical novel, ''The Eleventh Virgin'' (1924), based on her affair with Moise. In its "Epilogue," she tried to draw lessons about the status of women from her experience: "I thought I was a free and emancipated young woman, and found out I wasn't at all ... [F]reedom is just a modernity gown, a new trapping that we women affect to capture the man we want."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forest|first=Jim |title=All is Grace: A Biography of Dorothy Day|year=2011 |publisher=Orbis Books |location=Maryknoll, NY|pages=56–7}} Tobey later helped to found the [[Literary Guild]].&lt;/ref&gt; She later called it a "very bad book."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Forest|first=Jim |title=All is Grace: A Biography of Dorothy Day|year=2011 |publisher=Orbis Books |location=Maryknoll, NY|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sale of the movie rights to the novel gave her $2,500, and she bought a beach cottage as a writing retreat in [[Staten Island, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forest|first=Jim |title=All is Grace: A Biography of Dorothy Day|year=2011 |publisher=Orbis Books |location=Maryknoll, NY|pages=65–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon she found a new lover, Forster Batterham, an activist and biologist, who joined her there on weekends. She lived there from 1925 to 1929, entertaining friends and enjoying a romantic relationship that foundered when she took passionately to motherhood and religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forest|first=Jim |title=All is Grace: A Biography of Dorothy Day|year=2011 |publisher=Orbis Books |location=Maryknoll, NY|page=67ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Day, who had thought herself sterile following her abortion, was elated to find she was pregnant in mid-1925, while Batterham dreaded fatherhood. While she visited her mother in Florida, separating from Batterham for several months, she intensified her exploration of Catholicism. When she returned to Staten Island, Batterham found her increasing devotion, attendance at Mass, and religious reading incomprehensible. Soon after the birth of their daughter Tamar Teresa, on March 4, 1926, Day encountered a local Catholic [[Religious Sister]], Sister Aloysia, [[Sisters of Charity of New York|S.C.]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|work=The Catholic Worker|first=Dorothy|last=Day|title=On Pilgrimage|date=May 1978|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with her help educated herself in the Catholic faith, and had her baby baptized in July 1927. Batterham refused to attend the ceremony, and his relationship with Day became increasingly unbearable, as her desire for marriage in the Church confronted his antipathy to organized religion, Catholicism most of all. After one last fight in late December, Day refused to allow him to return. On December 28, she had herself baptized with Sister Aloysia as her godparent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forest|first=Jim|title=All is Grace: A Biography of Dorothy Day|year=2011|publisher=Orbis Books|location=Maryknoll, NY|pages=74–86}} Her baptism was ''[[Conditional baptism|conditional]]'', because she had already been baptized in the Episcopal Church.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Russian neighbor's sister had named her daughter Tamar, and Day was impressed by St. [[Teresa of Avila]], whose biography she had recently read. {{cite book|last=Miller|first=William D.|title=Dorothy Day: A Biography|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|location=NY|year=1982|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1929, to put the situation with Batterham behind her, Day accepted a job writing film dialogue for [[Pathé|Pathé Motion Pictures]], and moved to Los Angeles with Tamar. A few months later, following the 1929 stock market crash, her contract was not renewed. She returned to New York via a sojourn in Mexico, and a family visit in Florida. Day supported herself as a journalist, writing a gardening column for the local paper, the ''[[Staten Island Advance]]'', and features articles and book reviews for several Catholic publications, like ''[[Commonweal (magazine)|Commonweal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forest |first=Jim|title=All is Grace: A Biography of Dorothy Day|year=2011 |publisher=Orbis Books|location=Maryknoll, NY|pages=90–95 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Jordan, ed., ''Dorothy Day: Writings from Commonweal'' [1929-1973] (Liturgical Press, 2002), 1-55&lt;/ref&gt;

It was during one of her assignments for The Commonweal in Washington, D.C. when she decided to take a greater role in social activism and Catholicism. During the hunger strikes in D.C. in December 1932, she noted that she was filled with pride watching the marchers, but she couldn't do much with her conversion. She writes in her autobiography: "I could write, I could protest, to arouse the conscience, but where was the Catholic leadership in the gathering of bands of men and women together, for the actual works of mercy that the comrades had always made part of their technique in reaching the workers?" Later, she visited the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in northeast D.C. to offer a prayer to find a way to use her gifts and talents to help her fellow workers and the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Day|first=Dorothy|title=The Long Loneliness: the autobiography of Dorothy Day|year=1981|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|location=San Francisco|pages=165–166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Catholic Worker Movement===
In 1932, Day met [[Peter Maurin]], the man she always credited as the founder of the movement with which she is identified. Maurin, a [[France|French]] immigrant and something of a vagabond, had entered the [[Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools|Brothers of the Christian Schools]] in his native France, before emigrating, first to Canada, then to the United States. Despite his lack of formal education, Maurin was a man of deep intellect and decidedly strong views. He had a vision of social justice and its connection with the poor, which was partly inspired by St. [[Francis of Assisi]]. He had a vision of action based on a sharing of ideas and subsequent action by the poor themselves. Maurin was deeply versed in the writings of the [[Church Fathers]] and the [[papal]] documents on social matters that had been issued by [[Pope Leo XIII]] and his successors. Maurin provided Day with the grounding in Catholic theology of the need for social action they both felt. Years later Day described how Maurin also broadened her knowledge by bringing "a digest of the writings of Kropotkin one day, calling my attention especially to ''Fields, Factories, and Workshops''. Day observed: "I was familiar with Kropotkin only through his ''Memoirs of a Revolutionist,'' which had originally run serially in the ''Atlantic Monthly.'' She wrote: "Oh, far day of American freedom, when Karl Marx could write for the morning ''Tribune'' in New York, and Kropotkin could not only be published in the ''Atlantic,'' but be received as a guest into the homes of New England Unitarians, and in Jane Addams' Hull House in Chicago!"&lt;ref&gt;''Loaves and Fishes,'' 1983 reprint, pp. 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt; The French models and literature Maurin drew to Day's attention are of particular interest.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1474225X.2013.780400&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Dorothy Day's social Catholicism: the formative French influences|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1474225X.2013.780400|journal = International journal for the Study of the Christian Church|date = May 1, 2013|issn = 1474-225X|pages = 96–110|volume = 13|issue = 2|doi = 10.1080/1474225X.2013.780400|first = Robert|last = Atkins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catholic Worker movement started when the first issue of the ''[[Catholic Worker]]'' appeared on May 1, 1933, priced at one cent, and published continuously since then. It was aimed at those suffering the most in the depths of the Great Depression, "those who think there is no hope for the future", and announced to them that "the Catholic Church has a social program...there are men of God who are working not only for their spiritual but for their material welfare." It accepted no advertising and did not pay its staff.&lt;ref name="Webb"/&gt; Publication of the first issue was supported in part by a $1 donation from [[Sister Peter Claver]], for whom a Catholic Worker house was later named.&lt;ref name="Fielding"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fielding|first1=Rosemary|title=Sister Peter Claver Spent Life Working for Poor and Forgotten|url=http://oldarchive.godspy.com/reviews/Sister-Peter-Claver-Spent-Life-Working-for-Poor-and-Forgotten-by-Rosemary-Fielding.cfm.html|website=GodSpy: Faith at the edge|accessdate=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many newspapers of the day, including those for which Day had been writing, it was an unapologetic example of advocacy journalism. It provided coverage of strikes, explored working conditions, especially of women and black workers, and explicated papal teaching on social issues.&lt;ref name="Webb"&gt;Sheila Webb, "Dorothy Day and the Early Years of the ''Catholic Worker'': Social Action through the Pages of the Press", in ''U.S. Catholic Historian'', Vol. 21, No. 3, Summer, 2003, 71-80, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25154868 JSTOR], accessed January 30, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Its viewpoint was partisan and stories were designed to move its readers to take action locally, for example, by patronizing laundries recommended by the Laundry Workers' Union. Its advocacy of federal child labor laws put it at odds with the American Church hierarchy from its first issue, but Day censored some of Maurin's attacks on the Church hierarchy and tried to have a collection of the paper's issues presented to [[Pope Pius XI]] in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Sheila Webb, "Dorothy Day and the Early Years of the ''Catholic Worker'': Social Action through the Pages of the Press", in ''U.S. Catholic Historian'', Vol. 21, No. 3, Summer, 2003, 80-84, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25154868 JSTOR], accessed January 30, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The paper's principal competitor both in distribution and ideology was the Communist ''[[Daily Worker]]''. Day opposed its atheism, its advocacy of "class hatred" and violent revolution, and its opposition to private property. The first issue of the ''Catholic Worker'' asked: "Is it not possible to be radical and not atheist?" and celebrated its distribution in [[Union Square, Manhattan|Union Square]] on [[International Workers' Day|May Day]] as a direct challenge to the Communists. Day defended government relief programs like the Civilian Conservation Corps that the Communists ridiculed. The ''Daily Worker'' responded by mocking the ''Catholic Worker'' for its charity work and for expressing sympathy for landlords when calling evictions morally wrong. In this fight, the Church hierarchy backed Day's movement and ''[[Commonweal (magazine)|Commonweal]]'', a Catholic journal that expressed a wide range of viewpoints, said that Day's background positioned her well for her mission: "There are few laymen in this country who are so completely conversant with Communist propaganda and its exponents."&lt;ref&gt;Sheila Webb, "Dorothy Day and the Early Years of the ''Catholic Worker'': Social Action through the Pages of the Press", in ''U.S. Catholic Historian'', Vol. 21, No. 3, Summer, 2003, 84-8, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25154868 JSTOR], accessed January 30, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Over several decades, the ''Catholic Worker'' attracted such writers and editors as [[Michael Harrington]], [[Ammon Hennacy]], [[Thomas Merton]], and [[Daniel Berrigan]]. From the publishing enterprise came a "[[house of hospitality]]", a shelter that provided food and clothing to the poor of the Lower East Side and then a series of farms for communal living.&lt;ref name="coles14-15"&gt;Coles (1987), pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; The movement quickly spread to other cities in the United States and to Canada and the United Kingdom. More than 30 independent but affiliated Catholic Worker communities had been founded by 1941.&lt;ref name="cwclist"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.catholicworker.org/communities/commlistall.cfm | title = List of Catholic Worker Communities | publisher = catholicworker.org | accessdate = November 30, 2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081220122836/http://www.catholicworker.org/communities/commlistall.cfm | archivedate = December 20, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1935, the ''Catholic Worker'' began publishing articles that articulated a rigorous and uncompromising pacifist position, breaking with the traditional Catholic doctrine of [[just war theory]]. The next year, the two sides that fought the [[Spanish Civil War]] roughly approximated two of Day's allegiances, with the Church allied with [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] fighting radicals of many stripes, the ''Catholic'' and the ''worker'' at war with one another. Day refused to follow the Catholic hierarchy in support of Franco against the Republican forces, which were atheist and anticlerical in spirit, led by anarchists and communists (that is, the Republican forces were).&lt;ref name=forest152&gt;{{cite book|last=Forest|first=Jim|title=All is Grace: A Biography of Dorothy Day|year=2011 |publisher=Orbis Books|location=Maryknoll, NY|pages=152–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; She acknowledged the martyrdom of priests and nuns in Spain and said she expected the age of revolution she was living in to require more martyrs:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Day|first=Dorothy |title=Explains CW Stand on Use of Force|url=http://dorothyday.catholicworker.org/articles/216.html|accessdate=January 31, 2014|newspaper=Dorothy Day Collection|date=September 1938}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The paper's circulation fell as many Catholic churches, schools, and hospitals that had previously served as its distribution points withdrew support.&lt;ref name=forest152/&gt; Circulation fell from 150,000 to 30,000.&lt;ref&gt;Sheila Webb, "Dorothy Day and the Early Years of the ''Catholic Worker'': Social Action through the Pages of the Press", in ''U.S. Catholic Historian'', Vol. 21, No. 3, Summer, 2003, 84, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25154868 JSTOR], accessed January 30, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, she published an account of the transformation of her political activism into religiously motivated activism in ''From Union Square to Rome''. She recounted her life story selectively, without providing the details of her early years of "grievous mortal sin" when her life was "pathetic little and mean".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Day|first=Dorothy|title=From Union Square to Rome: Chapter 1|year=1938|url=http://dorothyday.catholicworker.org/articles/201.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; She presented it as an answer to communist relatives and friends who have asked: "How could you become a Catholic?":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Day

===Activism===
In the early 1940s she affiliated with the [[Order of St. Benedict|Benedictines]], professing as an [[Oblate#Secular oblates|oblate]] of [[St. Procopius Abbey]] in 1955. This gave her a spiritual practice and connection that sustained her throughout the rest of her life. She was briefly a postulant in the Fraternity of Jesus Caritas, which was inspired by the example of [[Charles de Foucauld]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Merriman|first=Bridget O'Shea|title=Searching for Christ: The Spirituality of Dorothy Day|year=1994 |publisher=University of Notre Dame Press |location=Notre Dame, IN|pages=100–107, 124–127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Day felt unwelcome there and disagreed with how meetings were run. When she withdrew as a candidate for the Fraternity, she wrote to a friend: "I just wanted to let you know that I feel even closer to it all, tho it is not possible for me to be a recognized 'Little Sister,' or formally a part of it".&lt;ref&gt;''All the Way to Heaven: The Selected Letters of Dorothy Day'', Robert Ellsberg, ed., Milwaukee: Marquette University Press, p. 301&lt;/ref&gt;

Day reaffirmed her [[pacifism]] following the U.S. declaration of war in 1941 and urged noncooperation in a speech that day:&lt;ref&gt;December 8, 1941 speech to the Liberal-Socialist Alliance, New York City, quoted in Sandra J. Sarkela, Susan Mallon Ross, Margaret A. Lowe, ''From Megaphones to Microphones: Speeches of American Women, 1920-1960,'' 2003, pp. 191-192&lt;/ref&gt; "We must make a start. We must renounce war as an instrument of policy. . . . Even as I speak to you I may be guilty of what some men call treason. But we must reject war. . . . You young men should refuse to take up arms. Young women tear down the patriotic posters. And all of you—young and old—put away your flags." Her January 1942 column was headlined "We Continue Our Christian Pacifist Stand". She wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Day|first=Dorothy|title=Our Country Passes from Undeclared War to Declared War; We Continue Our Christian Pacifist Stand|url=http://dorothyday.catholicworker.org/articles/868.html|accessdate=January 28, 2014|newspaper=Dorothy Day Collection|date=January 1942}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
{{quote|We are still pacifists. Our manifesto is the Sermon on the Mount, which means that we will try to be peacemakers. Speaking for many of our conscientious objectors, we will not participate in armed warfare or in making munitions, or by buying government bonds to prosecute the war, or in urging others to these efforts.

But neither will we be carping in our criticism. We love our country and we love our President. We have been the only country in the world where men of all nations have taken refuge from oppression. We recognize that while in the order of intention we have tried to stand for peace, for love of our brother, in the order of execution we have failed as Americans in living up to our principles.}}
The circulation of the ''Catholic Worker'', following its losses during the Spanish Civil War, had risen to 75,000, but now plummeted again. The closing of many of the movement's houses around the country, as staff left to join the war effort, showed that Day's pacifism had limited appeal even within the Catholic Worker community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Forest|first=Jim|title=All is Grace: A Biography of Dorothy Day|year=2011 |publisher=Orbis Books |location=Maryknoll, NY |pages=161–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 13, 1949, unions representing workers at cemeteries managed by the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York|Archdiocese of New York]] went on strike. After several weeks, Cardinal [[Francis Spellman]] used [[lay brother]]s from the local [[Maryknoll]] seminary and then diocesan seminarians under his own supervision to break the strike by digging graves. He called the union action "Communist-inspired". Employees of the ''Catholic Worker'' joined the strikers' picket line, and Day wrote Spellman, telling him he was "misinformed" about the workers and their demands, defending their right to unionize and their "dignity as men", which she deemed far more important than any dispute about wages. She begged him to take the first steps to resolve the dispute: "Go to them, conciliate them. It is easier for the great to give in than the poor." Spellman stood fast until the strike ended on March 11 when the union members accepted the Archdiocese's original offer of a 48-hour 6-day work week. Day wrote in the ''Catholic Worker'' in April: "A Cardinal, ill-advised, exercised so overwhelming a show of force against the union of poor working men. There is a temptation of the devil to that most awful of all wars, the war between the clergy and the laity." Years later she explained her stance vis-à-vis Spellman: "[H]e is our chief priest and confessor; he is our spiritual leader–of all of us who live here in New York. But he is not our ruler." On March 3, 1951, the Archdiocese ordered Day to cease publication or remove the word ''Catholic'' from the name of her publication. She replied with a respectful letter that asserted as much right to publish the ''Catholic Worker'' as the Catholic War Veterans had to their name and their own opinions independent of those of the Archdiocese. The Archdiocese took no action, and later Day speculated that perhaps church officials did not want members of the Catholic Worker movement holding prayer vigils for him to relent: "We were ready to go to St. Patrick's, fill up the Church, stand outside it in prayerful meditation. We were ready to take advantage of America's freedoms so that we could say what we thought and do what we believed to be the right thing to do."&lt;ref&gt;David L. Gregory, "Dorothy Day, Workers' Rights, and Catholic Authenticity", ''Fordham Urban Law Journal'', Vol 26 Issue 5, 1998, 1371-92, [http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/ulj/vol26/iss5/2/ available online]&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 15, 1955, Day joined a group of pacifists in refusing to participate in civil defense drills scheduled that day. Some of them challenged the constitutionality of the law under which they were charged, but Day and six others took the position that their refusal was not a legal dispute but one of philosophy. Day said she was doing "public penance" for the United States' first use of an atom bomb. They pleaded guilty on September 28, 1955, but the judge refused to send them to jail saying "I'm not making any martyrs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=7 Pacifists Insist on Guilty Pleas|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1955/09/29/83375308.pdf|accessdate=January 26, 2014|newspaper=New York Times |date=September 29, 2014}} The statute at issue was the New York State Defense Emergency Act.&lt;/ref&gt; She did the same in each of the next five years.

On the other hand, when that regime is bending all its efforts to make a good life for the people, a naturally good life (on which grace can build) one cannot help but be in favor of the measures taken."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Day|first=Dorothy|title=Pilgrimage to Cuba--Part I |url=http://dorothyday.catholicworker.org/articles/793.html |accessdate=January 26, 2014|newspaper=Dorothy Day Collection |date=September 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Day hoped that the [[Second Vatican Council]] would endorse nonviolence as a fundamental tenet of Catholic life and denounce nuclear arms, both their use in warfare and the "idea of arms being used as deterrents, to establish a balance of terror".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Day|first=Dorothy|title=On Pilgrimage; Good News|url=http://dorothyday.catholicworker.org/articles/248.html|accessdate=January 28, 2014|newspaper=Dorothy Day Collection|date=December 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She lobbied bishops in Rome and joined with other women in a ten-day fast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Day|first=Dorothy|title=On Pilgrimage; October First|url=http://dorothyday.catholicworker.org/articles/835.html|accessdate=January 28, 2014|newspaper=Dorothy Day Collection|date=November 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was pleased when the Council in ''[[Gaudium et spes]]'' (1965), its statement on "the Church in the Modern World", said that nuclear warfare was incompatible with traditional Catholic [[just war theory]]: "Every act of war directed to the indiscriminate destruction of whole cities or vast areas with their inhabitants is a crime against God and man, which merits firm and unequivocal condemnation."&lt;ref&gt;Mark and Louis Zwick, "Introduction" to Dorothy Day, ''On Pilgrimage'' (Eerdmans, 1999), p. 51, [https://books.google.com/books?id=F4yZu5yGT5UC&amp;pg=PA51&amp; available online], accessed January 28, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Day's account of the Catholic Worker movement, ''Loaves and Fishes'', was published in 1963.

Despite her anti-establishment sympathies, Day's judgment of the 60s counterculture was nuanced. She enjoyed it when [[Abbie Hoffman]] told her she was the original [[hippie]], accepting it as a form of tribute to her detachment from materialism.&lt;ref name="bulletin11-29-80"/&gt; At the same time she disapproved of many who called themselves hippies. She described some she encountered in 1969 in Minnesota: "They are marrying young–17 and 18, and taking to the woods up by the Canadian border and building houses for themselves–becoming pioneers again." But she recognized in them the self-indulgence of middle-class affluence, people who had "not known suffering" and lived without principles. She imagined how soldiers returning from Vietnam would want to kill them, but thought what the "flower-people" deserved was "prayer and penance".&lt;ref&gt;Miller, William D. ''Dorothy Day: A Biography''. San Francisco: Harper &amp; Rowe, 1982, p. 491&lt;/ref&gt; Day struggled as a leader with influence but without direct authority over the Catholic Worker houses, even the Tivoli Catholic Worker Farm that she visited regularly. She recorded her frustration in her diary: "I have no power to control smoking of pot, for instance, or sexual promiscuity, or solitary sins."&lt;ref name="Duty of Delight, 2011, p. 447"&gt;''Duty of Delight'', 2011, p. 447.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, Spellman visited U.S. troops in Vietnam at Christmas, where he was reported as saying: "This war in Vietnam is ... a war for civilization." Day authored a response in the January 1967 issue of the ''Catholic Worker'' that avoided direct criticism but cataloged all the war zones Spellman had visited over the years: "It is not just Vietnam, it is South Africa, it is Nigeria, the Congo, Indonesia, all of Latin America." Visiting was "a brave thing to do", she wrote, and asked: "But oh, God, what are all these Americans doing all over the world so far from our own shores?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roberts |first=Nancy L.|title=Dorothy Day and the Catholic Worker|year=1984|publisher=State Univ of New York Press|page=164 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wx5A4UE05QYC&amp;pg=PA164&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, at the height of American participation in the [[Vietnam War]], she described [[Ho Chi Minh]] as "a man of vision, as a patriot, a rebel against foreign invaders" while telling a story of a holiday gathering with relatives where one needs "to find points of agreement and concordance, if possible, rather than the painful differences, religious and political."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Day|first=January|title=On Pilgrimage; Perkinsville|url=http://dorothyday.catholicworker.org/articles/498.html|accessdate=January 28, 2014|newspaper=Dorothy Day Collection|date=January 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
In 1971, Day was awarded the [[Pacem in Terris Award]] of the Interracial Council of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Davenport|Catholic Diocese of Davenport]], Iowa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pacem In Terris Past Recipients |url=http://www.davenportdiocese.org/socialaction/sapitrecipients.htm#DOROTHY_DAY |publisher=Diocese of Davenport |accessdate=January 26, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725222132/http://www.davenportdiocese.org/socialaction/sapitrecipients.htm#DOROTHY_DAY |archivedate=July 25, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[University of Notre Dame]] awarded her its [[Laetare Medal]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Laetare Medal Recipients|url=http://archives.nd.edu/research/facts/laetare.html |publisher=University of Notre Dame Archives|accessdate=January 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite suffering from poor health, Day visited India, where she met [[Mother Teresa]] and saw her work. In 1971, Day visited Poland, the Soviet Union, Hungary, and Romania as part of a group of peace activists, with the financial support of [[Corliss Lamont]], whom she described as a "'pinko' millionaire who lived modestly and helped the Communist Party USA." &lt;ref&gt;''The Duty of Delight,'' 2011, pp. 587-588.&lt;/ref&gt; She met with three members of the [[USSR Union of Writers|Writers' Union]] and defended [[Alexander Solzhenitsyn]] against charges that he had betrayed his country. Day informed her readers that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Day|first=Dorothy|title=On Pilgrimage: First Visit to Soviet Russia|url=http://dorothyday.catholicworker.org/articles/513.html|accessdate=January 31, 2014|newspaper=Dorothy Day Collection|date=September 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Solzhenitsin lives in poverty and has been expelled from the Writers Union and cannot be published in his own country. He is harassed continually, and recently his small cottage in the country has been vandalized and papers destroyed, and a friend of his who went to bring some of his papers to him was seized and beaten. The letter Solzhenitsin wrote protesting this was widely printed in the west, and I was happy to see as a result a letter of apology by the authorities in Moscow, saying that it was the local police who had acted so violently.}}
Day visited the [[Kremlin]], and she reported: "I was moved to see the names of the Americans, Ruthenberg and Bill Haywood, on the Kremlin Wall in Roman letters, and the name of Jack Reed (with whom I worked on the old ''Masses''), in Cyrillac characters in a flower-covered grave". Ruthenberg was [[C. E. Ruthenberg]], founder of the [[Communist Party USA]]. [[Bill Haywood]] was a key figure in the [[Industrial Workers of the World|IWW]]. Jack Reed was the journalist better known as [[John Reed (journalist)|John Reed]], author of ''[[Ten Days That Shook the World]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Day|first=Dorothy |title=On Pilgrimage: Russia, II: Kremlin Wall|url=http://dorothyday.catholicworker.org/articles/515.html|accessdate=January 31, 2014|newspaper=Dorothy Day Collection|date=October–November 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, the Jesuit magazine ''[[America (Jesuit magazine)|America]]'' marked her 75th birthday by devoting an entire issue to Day and the Catholic Worker movement. The editors wrote: "By now, if one had to choose a single individual to symbolize the best in the aspiration and action of the American Catholic community during the last forty years, that one person would certainly be Dorothy Day."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Krupa|first=Stephen J.|title=Celebrating Dorothy Day|url=http://americamagazine.org/node/145405|accessdate=January 26, 2014|newspaper=America|date=August 27, 2001|quote= Dorothy Day remains, at the dawn of the new millennium, the radical conscience of American Catholicism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Day had supported the work of [[Cesar Chavez]] in organizing California farm laborers from the beginning of his campaign in the mid-1960s. She admired him for being motivated by religious inspiration and committed to nonviolence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Forest|first=Jim|title=All is Grace: A Biography of Dorothy Day|year=2011 |publisher=Orbis Books |location=Maryknoll, NY |pages=252–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1973, she joined [[Cesar Chavez]] in his campaign for farm laborers in the fields of California. She was arrested with other protesters for defying an injunction against picketing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Caldwell |first=Earl |title=Picket Shot, Many More Arrested in Grape Strike|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1973/08/03/90461154.pdf |accessdate=January 31, 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=August 3, 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; and spent ten days in jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Day|first=Dorothy|title=On Pilgrimage |url=http://dorothyday.catholicworker.org/articles/533.html |accessdate=January 31, 2014|newspaper=Dorothy Day Collection |date=September 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, Boston's Paulist Center Community named her the first recipient of their Isaac Hecker Award, given to a person or group "committed to building a more just and peaceful world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McElwee|first=Joshua J.|title=LCWR receives Paulist award for social justice work|url=http://ncronline.org/blogs/ncr-today/lcwr-receives-paulist-award-social-justice-work|accessdate=January 26, 2014|newspaper=National Catholic Reporter|date=January 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Day made her last public appearance at the [[Eucharistic Congress]] held on August 6, 1976, in [[Philadelphia]] at a service honoring the U.S. Armed Forces on the [[United States bicentennial|Bicentennial of the United States]]. She spoke about reconciliation and penance, and castigated the organizers for failing to recognize that for peace activists August 6 is the day the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima]], an inappropriate day to honor the military.&lt;ref&gt;Eileen Egan, "Dorothy Day: Pilgrim of Peace", in Patrick G. Coy, ed., ''A Revolution of the Heart: Essays on the Catholic Worker'', pp. 69-71, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4dG87jxGDFcC&amp;pg=PA69&amp; available online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Rademacher, "'To Relate the Eucharist to Real Living': Mother Teresa and Dorothy Day at the Forty-First International Eucharistic Congress, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", ''U.S. Catholic Historian'', Volume 27, Number 4, Fall 2009, pp. 59-72&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==

Day suffered a heart attack and died on November 29, 1980, at Maryhouse on [[1st Street (Manhattan)|East 3rd Street]] in Manhattan.&lt;ref name=nytobit&gt;{{cite news |first= Alden|last= Whitman|title=Dorothy Day, Outspoken Catholic Activist, Dies at 83 |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1980/11/30/111818556.pdf |work=New York Times |date= November 30, 1980 |accessdate=January 28, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cardinal [[Terence Cooke]] greeted her funeral procession at the [[Church of the Nativity (Manhattan)|Church of the Nativity]], the local [[parish church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harrington|first=Michael|title=Existential Saint|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/13/books/existential-saint.html|accessdate=January 26, 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=June 13, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; Day was buried in the [[Cemetery of the Resurrection]] on [[Staten Island]] just a few blocks from the beachside cottage where she first became interested in Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stone|first=Elained Murray|title=Dorothy Day: Champion of the Poor|year=2004|publisher=Paulist Press|location=Mahwah, NJ|page=102|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Gx8oOw9DHQC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her gravestone is inscribed with the words ''Deo Gratias''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=pv&amp;GRid=6246009&amp;PIpi=408103 Dorothy Day, Photos], accessed January 26, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Day's daughter Tamar, the mother of nine children, was with her mother when she died, and she and her father joined the funeral procession and attended a later memorial Mass the cardinal celebrated at St. Patrick's Cathedral.

==Legacy==

[[Judith Palache Gregory]] was Day's executor.

Day's papers are housed at [[Marquette University]] along with many records of the Catholic Worker movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dorothy Day-Catholic Worker Collection|url=http://www.marquette.edu/library/archives/day.shtml|work=Special Collections &amp; University Archives|publisher=Raynor Memorial Libraries|accessdate=January 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''Catholic Worker'' had a circulation of more than 100,000 for some years, and reported a circulation of under 30,000 in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, pp.&amp;nbsp;179–182; ''Catholic Worker,'' "Statement of Ownership, Management, and Circulation," December 2013, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1983, a pastoral letter issued by the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops|U.S.Conference of Catholic Bishops]], "The Challenge of Peace," noted her role in establishing non-violence as a Catholic principle: "the nonviolent witness of such figures as Dorothy Day and Martin Luther King has had profound impact upon the life of the Church in the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Challenge of Peace: God's Promise and Our Response, May 3, 1983|url=http://old.usccb.org/sdwp/international/TheChallengeofPeace.pdf|publisher=US Conference of Catholic Bishops|accessdate=January 28, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140124122451/http://old.usccb.org/sdwp/international/TheChallengeofPeace.pdf|archivedate=January 24, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs==

===Charity and poverty===
Day struggled to write about poverty most of her life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Day|first=Dorothy|title=The Faces of Poverty, in Hearing the Call Across Traditions|year=1963|publisher=|page=117|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K7p8X6Lp7bAC&amp;pg=PA117}}&lt;/ref&gt; She admired America's efforts to take responsibility through the government, but ultimately felt that charitable works were personal decisions that needed the warmth of an individual.&lt;ref name="Day 1963 120"&gt;{{cite book|last=Day|first=Dorothy|title=The Faces of Poverty, in Hearing the Call Across Traditions|year=1963|publisher=|page=120|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K7p8X6Lp7bAC&amp;pg=PA120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Day also denounced sins against the poor. She said that "depriving the laborer" was a deadly sin,&lt;ref name="Day 1963 120"/&gt; using similar language to the [[Epistle of James]] in the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic.org/bible/book.php?id=66&amp;bible_chapter=5 |title=James - Chapter 5 |website=Catholic Online |access-date=September 24, 2015 |quote="Can you hear crying out against you the wages which you kept back from the labourers mowing your fields? The cries of the reapers have reached the ears of the Lord Sabaoth."}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also said that [[advertising]] men were sinners ("woe to that generation") because they made the poor "willing to sell [their] liberty and honor" to satisfy "paltry desires."&lt;ref name="Day 1963 120"/&gt;

===All men are brothers===
In the ''Catholic Worker'' in May 1951, Day wrote that Marx, Lenin, and  Mao Tse-Tung "were animated by the love of brother and this we must believe though their ends meant the seizure of power, and the building of mighty armies, the compulsion of concentration camps, the forced labor and torture and killing of tens of thousands, even millions." She used them as examples because she insisted that the belief that "all men are brothers" required the Catholic to find the humanity in everyone without exception. She explained that she understood the jarring impact of such an assertion:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Day|first=Dorothy|title=The Incompatibility of Love and Violence|url=http://dorothyday.catholicworker.org/articles/232.html| accessdate =January 31, 2014|newspaper=Dorothy Day Collection|date=May 1951}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{quote|Peter Maurin was constantly restating our position, and finding authorities from all faiths, and races, all authorities. He used to embarrass us sometimes by dragging in Marshall Petain and Fr. Coughlin and citing something good they had said, even when we were combating the point of view they were representing. Just as we shock people by quoting Marx, Lenin, Mao-Tse-Tung, or Ramakrishna to restate the case for our common humanity, the brotherhood of man and the fatherhood of God.}}

In 1970, Day emulated Maurin when she wrote:&lt;ref&gt;"On Pilgrimage--Our Spring Appeal," ''Catholic Worker,'' May 1970&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|the two words [anarchist-pacifist] should go together, especially at this time when more and more people, even priests, are turning to violence, and are finding their heroes in [[Camilo Torres Restrepo|Camillo Torres]] among the priests, and Che Guevara among laymen. The attraction is strong, because both men literally laid down their lives for their brothers. "Greater love hath no man than this." 
"Let me say, at the risk of seeming ridiculous, that the true revolutionary is guided by great feelings of love." Che Guevara wrote this, and he is quoted by Chicano youth in ''El Grito Del Norte''.}}

====Sympathy and Identification with anarchists====
{{Anarchism sidebar}}
Day encountered anarchism while studying in university. She read ''The Bomb'' by [[Frank Harris]], a fictionalized biography of one of the [[Haymarket Affair|Haymarket]] anarchists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Day|first=Dorothy|title=The Long Loneliness: the autobiography of Dorothy Day|year=1981|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|location=San Francisco|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; She discussed anarchy and extreme poverty with Peter Kropotkin.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, William D. (1982). Dorothy Day: A Biography. NY: Harper &amp; Row. pp. 27–8.&lt;/ref&gt; After moving to New York, Day studied the anarchism of [[Emma Goldman]] and attended the Anarchists Ball at [[Webster Hall]].&lt;ref name=elie17&gt;Elie (2003), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Day was saddened by the executions of the anarchists [[Sacco and Vanzetti]] in 1927. She wrote that when they died, "All the nation mourned." As a Catholic, she felt a sense of solidarity with them, specifically "the very sense of solidarity which made me gradually understand the doctrine of the Mystical Body of Christ whereby we are all members of one another."&lt;ref name=elie57&gt;Elie (2003), p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussing the term ''anarchism'', she wrote: "We ourselves have never hesitated to use the word. Some prefer personalism. But Peter Maurin came to me with Kropotkin in one pocket and St. Francis in the other!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Day|first=Dorothy|title=On Pilgrimage; Small is Beautiful|url=http://dorothyday.catholicworker.org/articles/538.html|accessdate=January 28, 2014|newspaper=Dorothy Day Collection|date=February 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dorothy Day's [[anarchist]]&lt;ref name="McKay, Iain 2007. pp. 75"&gt;McKay, Iain. ''An Anarchist FAQ Volume One''. AK Press. 2007. pp. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; [[distributist]] economic views are very similar to the [[anarchist]] [[Proudhon]]'s [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualist]] economic theory whom she was influenced by.&lt;ref name="McKay, Iain 2007. pp. 75"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Day, Dorothy. ''On Pilgrimage.'' Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co. 1999. pp. 22, 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of the [[anarchists]] [[Proudhon]] and [[Kropotkin]]&lt;ref&gt;Day, Dorothy. ''House of Hospitality''. Our Sunday Visitor Inc. 2015. pp. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; also led her to label herself an [[anarchist]]. Dorothy Day states: "An anarchist then as I am now, I have never used the vote that the women won by their demonstrations before the White House during that period.".&lt;ref&gt;Terrell, Brian. ''Dorothy Day's anarchism is the antidote to disappointing political system''. People: NCRonline.org. April 19, 2016. Retrieved July 21, 2018 from: https://www.ncronline.org/blogs/ncr-today/dorothy-days-anarchism-antidote-disappointing-political-system&lt;/ref&gt;

Day explained that anarchists accepted her as someone who shared the values of their movement "[b]ecause I have been behind bars in police stations, houses of detention, jails and prison farms, ... eleven times, and have refused to pay Federal income taxes and have never voted", but were puzzled by what they saw as her "Faith in the monolithic, authoritarian Church". She reversed the viewpoint and ignored their professions of atheism. She wrote: "I in turn, can see Christ in them even though they deny Him, because they are giving themselves to working for a better social order for the wretched of the earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Day|first=Dorothy|title=On Pilgrimage; A Hard Job|url=http://dorothyday.catholicworker.org/articles/540.html|accessdate=January 28, 2014|newspaper=Dorothy Day Collection|date=May 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sympathy with communists====
In the first years of the ''Catholic Worker'', Day provided a clear statement of how her individualism contrasted with communism:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Day|first=Dorothy|title=A Restatement of C. W. Aims and Ideals |url=http://dorothyday.catholicworker.org/articles/300.html |accessdate=March 30, 2014|newspaper=Dorothy Day Collection |date=May 1936}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|We believe in widespread private property, the de-proletarianizing of our American people. We believe in the individual owning the means of production, the land and his tools. We are opposed to the "finance capitalism" so justly criticized and condemned by Karl Marx but we believe there can be a Christian capitalism as there can be a Christian Communism.}} She also stated: "To labor is to pray -- that is the central point of the Christian doctrine of work. Hence, it is that while both Communism and Christianity are moved by 'compassion for the multitude,' the object of communism is to make the poor richer but the object of Christianity is to make the rich poor and the poor holy."&lt;ref&gt;(September 1946) "The Church and Work," ''Catholic Worker.''&lt;/ref&gt;
In November 1949, in the course of explaining why she had protested the recent [[Smith Act trials of Communist Party leaders#1949 trial|denial of bail to several Communists]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Porter|first=Russel|title=Law Change Cited|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1949/10/22/86787184.pdf|accessdate=January 28, 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=October 22, 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt; she wrote: "[L]et it be remembered that I speak as an ex-Communist and one who has not testified before Congressional Committees, nor written works on the Communist conspiracy. I can say with warmth that I loved the [communist] people I worked with and learned much from them. They helped me to find God in His poor, in His abandoned ones, as I had not found Him in Christian churches."&lt;ref name=beyondpolitics&gt;{{cite news|last=Day|first=Dorothy|title=Beyond Politics|url=http://dorothyday.catholicworker.org/articles/166.html|accessdate=March 30, 2014|newspaper=Dorothy Day Collection|date=November 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt; She identified points on which she agreed with the communists: "from each according to his ability, to each according to his need" and the "withering away of the State." Others she added with qualifications: "the communal aspect of property as stressed by the early Christians". And she identified differences: "we disagree over and over again with the means chosen to reach their ends". She agreed that "Class war is a fact and one does not need to advocate it", but posed the question of how to respond:&lt;ref name=beyondpolitics/&gt;
{{quote|The Communists point to it as forced upon them, and say that when it comes they will take part in it, and in their plans they want to prepare the ground, and win as many as possible to their point of view and for their side. And where will we be on that day? ...
[W]e will inevitably be forced to be on their side, physically speaking. But when it comes to activity, we will be pacifists, I hope and pray, non-violent resisters of aggression, from whomever it comes, resisters to repression, coercion, from whatever side it comes, and our activity will be the works of mercy. Our arms will be the love of God and our brother.}}

In regard to Fidel Castro's Cuba, she wrote in July 1961: "We are on the side of the revolution. We believe there must be new concepts of property, which is proper to man, and that the new concept is not so new. There is a Christian communism and a Christian capitalism.... We believe in farming communes and cooperatives and will be happy to see how they work out in Cuba.... God bless Castro and all those who are seeing Christ in the poor. God bless all those who are seeking the brotherhood of man because in loving their brothers they love God even though they deny Him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Day|first=Dorothy|title=About Cuba |url=http://dorothyday.catholicworker.org/articles/246.html |accessdate=March 30, 2014|newspaper=Dorothy Day Collection |date=July 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was only in December 1961 that Castro, who had repeatedly repudiated communism in the past, openly declared that his movement was not simply socialist, but communist.&lt;ref&gt;Leycester Coltman, ''The Real Fidel Castro'' (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 2008), p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catholic Church property===
[[Bill Kauffman]] of ''[[The American Conservative]]'' wrote of Day: "The Little Way. That is what we seek. That—contrary to the ethic of personal parking spaces, of the dollar-sign god—is the American way. Dorothy Day kept to that little way, and that is why we honor her. She understood that if small is not always beautiful, at least it is always human."&lt;ref&gt;[[Rod Dreher|Dreher, Rod]] (June 5, 2006) [http://www.amconmag.com/article/2006/jun/05/00029/ All-American Anarchists], ''[[The American Conservative]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Day's belief in smallness also applied to the property of others, including the Catholic Church, as when she wrote: "Fortunately, the Papal States were wrested from the Church in the last century, but there is still the problem of investment of papal funds. It is always a cheering thought to me that if we have good will and are still unable to find remedies for the economic abuses of our time, in our family, our parish, and the mighty church as a whole, God will take matters in hand and do the job for us. When I saw the Garibaldi mountains in British Columbia . . . I said a prayer for his soul and blessed him for being the instrument of so mighty a work of God. May God use us!"&lt;ref&gt;"Hutterite Communities," ''Catholic Worker'' (July–August 1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesuit priest Daniel Lyons "called Day 'an apostle of pious oversimplification.' He said that the ''Catholic Worker'' 'often distorted beyond recognition' the position of the Popes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roberts |first=Nancy L.|title=Dorothy Day and the Catholic Worker|year=1984|publisher=State Univ of New York Press|page=161 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wx5A4UE05QYC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catholic orthodoxy===
Day wrote in one of her memoirs: "I had a conversation with John Spivak, the Communist writer, a few years ago, and he said to me, "How can you believe? How can you believe in the Immaculate Conception, in the Virgin birth, in the Resurrection?" I could only say that I believe in the Roman Catholic Church and all she teaches. I have accepted Her authority with my whole heart. At the same time I want to point out to you that we are taught to pray for final perseverance. We are taught that faith is a gift, and sometimes I wonder why some have it and some do not. I feel my own unworthiness and can never be grateful enough to God for His gift of faith."&lt;ref&gt;''From Union Square to Rome'' (1938), pp. 144-45; [[John L. Spivak|John Spivak]] was a leftist and journalist.&lt;/ref&gt;

Day's commitment to Church teaching is illustrated by an encounter she had with [[Daniel Berrigan|Fr. Daniel Berrigan, S.J.]] while on a Catholic Worker farm in New York. Berrigan was about to say Mass for the community vested only in a [[stole (vestment)|stole]]. Day insisted that he put on the proper vestments before he began. When Berrigan fussed about the foolishness of the law regarding liturgical attire, Day responded, "On this farm, we obey the laws of the Church." He relented and said the Mass fully vested.&lt;ref name="Becker1997"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Becker|first1=Joseph|title=The Re-Formed Jesuits|date=1997|publisher=Ignatius Press|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-89870-627-0|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The laity===
In response to press coverage in 1964 of an ongoing dispute between Cardinal [[James Francis McIntyre|James McIntyre]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles|Los Angeles]] and some of his priests, who criticized him for a lack of leadership on civil rights,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Story Priest Disputes Coast Cardinal|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1964/12/29/93225028.pdf|accessdate=January 31, 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=December 29, 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Priest Who Assailed Cardinal McIntyre Talks at Chancery|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/06/17/archives/priest-who-assailed-cardinal-mcintyre-talks-at-chancery.html |accessdate=January 31, 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=June 17, 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Day authored an essay on the laity's responsibility to act independently of the church hierarchy. When the ''Catholic Worker'' during World War II, she wrote, took a pacifist stance, "Bishop McIntyre merely commented ... 'We never studied these things much in the seminary' ... adding doubtfully, 'There is the necessity of course to inform one's conscience.' " For that attitude, Day added, "our shepherds are to be reproached, that they have not fed their sheep these strong meats ... capable of overcoming all obstacles in their advance to that kind of society where it easier to be good." She instructed her readers: "Let Catholics form their associations, hold their meetings in their own homes, or in a hired hall, or any place else. Nothing should stop them. Let the controversy come out into the open in this way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Day|first=Dorothy|title=The Case of Cardinal McIntyre|url=http://dorothyday.catholicworker.org/articles/196.html|accessdate=January 31, 2014|newspaper=Dorothy Day Collection|date=July–August 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sex===
In September 1963, Day discussed pre-marital sex in her column, warning against those who portrayed it as a form of freedom: "The wisdom of the flesh is treacherous indeed." She described herself as "a woman who must think in terms of the family, the need of the child to have both mother and father, who believes strongly that the home is the unit of society" and wrote that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Day|first=Dorothy|title=On Pilgrimage: Cuba and Sex|url=http://dorothyday.catholicworker.org/articles/806.html|accessdate=February 2, 2014|newspaper=Dorothy Day Collection|date=September 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{quote|When sex is treated lightly, as a means of pleasure ... it takes on the quality of the demonic, and to descend into this blackness is to have a foretaste of hell... There is no such thing as seeing how far one can go without being caught, or how far one can go without committing mortal sin.}}
In 1968, Day wrote again about sex—this time in her diary—in response to the criticisms of Stanley Vishnewski (and other coworkers at the Tivoli farm) that she had "no power" over marijuana smoking "or sexual promiscuity, or solitary sins."&lt;ref name="Duty of Delight, 2011, p. 447"/&gt; The situation continued to remain a problem, as Day also documented in her diary:&lt;ref&gt;''Duty of Delight'' (2011) pp. 522-523.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|For some weeks now my problem is this: What to do about the open immorality (and of course I mean sexual morality) in our midst. It is like the last times—there is nothing hidden that shall not be revealed. But when things become a matter for open discussion, what about example set, that most powerful of all teachers. We have with us now a beautiful woman with children whose husband has taken up with a seventeen-year-old, is divorcing her and starting on a new marriage. She comes to us as to a refuge where by working for others in our community of fifty or more, she can forget once in a while her human misery. . . . 
We have one young one, drunken, promiscuous, pretty as a picture, college educated, mischievous, able to talk her way out of any situation—so far. She comes to us when she is drunk and beaten and hungry and cold and when she is taken in, she is liable to crawl into the bed of any man on the place. We do not know how many she has slept with on the farm. What to do? What to do?}}

==Cause for sainthood==
A proposal for Day's [[canonization]] was put forth publicly by the [[Claretian Missionaries]] in 1983. At the request of [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|Cardinal]] [[John Joseph O'Connor|John J. O'Connor]], head of the diocese in which she lived, in March 2000 [[Pope John Paul II]] granted the [[Archdiocese of New York]] permission to open her cause, allowing her to be called a "[[Servant of God]]" in the eyes of the [[Catholic Church]]. As [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] requires, the Archdiocese of New York submitted this cause for the endorsement of the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]], which it received in November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Catholic New Service |url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/1204800.htm |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20121207032158/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/1204800.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=December 7, 2012 |title=US bishops endorse sainthood cause of Catholic Worker's Dorothy Day |date=November 13, 2012 |accessdate=December 1, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some members of the Catholic Worker Movement objected to the canonization process as a contradiction of Day's own values and concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Some followers question Day sainthood | url = http://catholic-sf.org/ns.php?newsid=16&amp;id=60819 | work = Catholic San Francisco | date = December 5, 2012 | accessdate = January 27, 2014 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140220032443/http://catholic-sf.org/ns.php?newsid=16&amp;id=60819 | archivedate = February 20, 2014 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pope [[Benedict XVI]], on February 13, 2013, in the closing days of his papacy, cited Day as an example of conversion. He quoted from her writings and said: "The journey towards faith in such a secularized environment was particularly difficult, but Grace acts nonetheless."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McElwee|first=Joshua J.|title=Looking to legacy, pope mentions Dorothy Day|url=http://ncronline.org/blogs/ncr-today/looking-legacy-pope-mentions-dorothy-day|accessdate=January 26, 2014|newspaper=National Catholic Reporter|date=February 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- BEFORE ADDING COMMENTS BY POPE FRANCIS ON September 24, 2015, READ THE ENTIRE ARTICLE.

== Evacuation of the art collection ==

[[File:La Grande Gallerie désertée.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The Grande Gallerie in September 1939]]
On 25 August 1939, the Louvre was closed for 3 days, officially for repairs. However, many of the Louvre art collection was hauled on trucks (203 vehicles transporting 1862 wooden cases) and sent to [[Château de Chambord]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Some of the art pieces were too big to be fit in a truck. For example [[The Raft of the Medusa]] had to be covered with a blanket. When the truck initially arrived at Versailles on his route to Chambord, the canvas touched an electric cable and created a short-circuit which switched off the electricity in the whole town. After that, the routes were carefully planned to avoid this type of problems, and attendants which poles were responsible to deal with electric or phone cables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The last art piece to leave the museum was the [[Winged Victory of Samothrace]], which was moved on September 3, 1939, the day the French ultimatum to Germany expired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Throughout the war, the arts pieces were clandestinely moved from chateau to chateau to avoid being taken back by the Nazis.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; For example, the ''Mona Lisa'' was moved from Chambord to several castles and abbeys, to finish at the end of the war at the [[Musée Ingres]] in [[Montauban]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== The arrival of the German army in Paris ==
On 16 August 1940, count [[Franz von Wolff-Metternich]], who was responsible of the conservation of the French art collections under the [[Kunstschutz]] principle, arrived in Paris to oversee France’s art collection, but the museum was almost empty. He knew what was going on but voluntarily did not do anything.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15155">'''Evolution of cognition''' is the idea that life on earth has gone from organisms with little to no [[cognitive function]] to a greatly varying display of cognitive function that we see in organisms today.  [[Animal cognition]] is largely studied by observing [[behavior]], which makes studying extinct species difficult. The definition of cognition varies by discipline; psychologists tend define cognition by [[human behaviors]], while ethologists have widely varying definitions. Ethological definitions of cognition range from only considering cognition in animals to be behaviors exhibited in humans, while others consider anything action involving a nervous system to be cognitive.

== Methods of studying cognitive evolution ==

Studying the evolution of cognition is accomplished through a comparative cognitive approach&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dukas|first=Reuven|date=2004|title=Evolutionary Biology of Animal Cognition|jstor=30034120|journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics|volume=35|pages=347–374}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matsuzawa|first=Tetsuro|date=2009-10-01|title=The chimpanzee mind: in search of the evolutionary roots of the human mind|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10071-009-0277-1|journal=Animal Cognition|language=en|volume=12|issue=1|pages=1–9|doi=10.1007/s10071-009-0277-1|issn=1435-9448}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van Horik|first=Jayden|last2=Emery|first2=Nathan J.|date=2011-11-01|title=Evolution of cognition|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wcs.144/abstract|journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Cognitive Science|language=en|volume=2|issue=6|pages=621–633|doi=10.1002/wcs.144|issn=1939-5086}}&lt;/ref&gt; where a cognitive ability and comparing it between closely related species and distantly related species. For example, a researcher may want to analyze the connection between spatial memory and food caching behavior. By examining two closely related animals (chickadees and jays) and/or two distantly related animals (jays and chipmunks), hypotheses could be generated about when and how this cognitive ability evolved.

== Animals with high levels of cognition ==

Higher cognitive processes have evolved in many closely and distantly related animals. Some of these examples are considered convergent evolution, while others most likely shared a common ancestor that possessed higher cognitive function. For example, apes humans, and cetaceans most likely had a common ancestor with high levels of cognition, and as these species diverged they all possessed this trait. Corvids (the crow family) and apes show similar cognitive abilities in some areas such as tool use. This ability is most likely an example of convergent evolution, due to their distant relatedness.

== Selection favoring cognition ==
=== Social living ===
Social living is thought to have co-evolved with higher cognitive processes. It is hypothesized that higher cognitive function evolved to mitigate the negative effects of living in social groups. For example, the ability to recognize individual groups members could solve the problem of cheating behavior. If individuals within the group can keep track of the cheaters, then they can punish or exclude them from the group. There is also a positive correlation between relative brain size and aspects of sociality in some species&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dunbar|first=R. I. M.|last2=Shultz|first2=Susanne|date=2007-09-07|title=Evolution in the Social Brain|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/317/5843/1344|journal=Science|language=en|volume=317|issue=5843|pages=1344–1347|doi=10.1126/science.1145463|issn=0036-8075|pmid=17823343}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Emery|first=Nathan J.|last2=Seed|first2=Amanda M.|last3=Bayern|first3=Auguste M.

=== Sex, mating, and relationships ===

Many animals have complex mating rituals require higher levels of cognition to evaluate.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Birds are well known for their intense mating displays including swan dances that can last hours or even days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.express.co.uk/travel/articles/662213/birds-incredible-mating-ritual-five-days-video|title=These birds have the most INCREDIBLE mating ritual that lasts FIVE days|last=Meades|first=Sian|date=2016-04-18|work=Express.co.uk|access-date=2018-03-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Higher levels of cognition may have evolved to facilitate the formation of longer lasting relationships. Animals that form pair bonds and share parental responsibilities produce offspring that are more likely to survive and reproduce, which increases the fitness of these individuals. The cognitive requirements for this type of mating include the ability the differentiate individuals from their group and resolve social conflicts.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

=== Finding, extracting, and protecting food ===
Another hypothesis for the evolution of cognition is that cognition allowed individuals access to food and resources that were previously unavailable. For example, the genetic mutation for color vision allowed for a greatly increased efficiency in finding and foraging fruit.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Food caching behavior displayed in some birds and mammals is an example of a behavior that may have co-evolved with higher cognitive processes. This ability to store food for later consumption allows these animals to take advantage of temporary surpluses in food availability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Male|first=Lucinda H.|last2=Smulders|first2=Tom V.|date=2007-03-01|title=Memory for food caches: not just for retrieval|url=https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/18/2/456/204179|journal=Behavioral Ecology|language=en|volume=18|issue=2|pages=456–459|doi=10.1093/beheco/arl107|issn=1045-2249}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corvids have displayed incredible abilities to create and remember the locations of up to hundreds of caches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sherry|first=David|title=Food storage by black-capped chickadees: Memory for the location and contents of caches|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S000334728480281X|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=32|issue=2|pages=451–464|doi=10.1016/s0003-3472(84)80281-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there is evidence that this is not just an instinctual behavior, but an example of future planning. Jays have been found to diversify the types of food they cache, possible indicating they understand the need to eat a variety of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Kort|first=Selvino R.|last2=Dickinson|first2=Anthony|last3=Clayton|first3=Nicola S.|title=Retrospective cognition by food-caching western scrub-jays|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S002396900500024X|journal=Learning and Motivation|volume=36|issue=2|pages=159–176|doi=10.1016/j.lmot.2005.02.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some supporters of this hypothesis suggest that higher cognitive processes require a large brain to body ratio. This higher brain to body size ratio in turn requires a large metabolic input to function. The idea is that the two processes (greater access to food and the brain's growing need for energy) may have snowballed the evolution of these two features.

=== Technology, tools, innovation, and culture ===
The cognitive ability to use tools and pass information from one generation to the next is thought to have been a driving force of the evolution of cognition. Many animals use tools including: primates, elephants, cetaceans, birds, fish, and some invertebrates.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Tool use varies widely depending on the species. For example, sea otters have been observed using a rock to break open snail shells, while primates and New Caledonian crows have demonstrated an ability to fashion a new tool for a specific use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bird|first=Christopher D.|last2=Emery|first2=Nathan J.|date=2009-06-23|title=Insightful problem solving and creative tool modification by captive nontool-using rooks|url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.0901008106|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=106|issue=25|pages=10370–10375|doi=10.1073/pnas.0901008106}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to use tools seems to provide animals with a fitness advantage, usually in the form of access to food previously unavailable, which allows a competitive advantage for these individuals.

Some animals have demonstrated the ability to pass information from one generation to the next (culture) including: primates, cetaceans, and birds.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Primates and birds can pass information of specific tool use strategies on to their offspring who can, in turn, pass it on to their offspring. In this way, the information can remain in a group on individuals even after the original users are gone. One famous example of this is in a group of macaque monkeys in Japan.  Researchers studying this species observed these monkeys feeding behavior in a population in Japan. The researchers witnessed one female, named Imo, realize that by washing potatoes in the nearby river you could remove much more sand and dirt then by simply wiping it off. Over the next few generations the researcher saw this behavior begin to appear in other individuals throughout the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://alfre.dk/monkeys-washing-potatoes/|title=Monkeys Washing Potatoes {{!}} Alfred K|last=K|first=Alfred|website=alfre.dk|language=en|access-date=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''face-to-face''' relation ({{lang-fr|rapport de face à face}}) is a concept in the French [[philosopher]] [[Emmanuel Lévinas]]' thought on human sociality. It means that, ethically, people are responsible to one-another in the face-to-face encounter. Specifically, Lévinas says that the human face "orders and ordains" us. It calls the [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]] into “giving and serving” the Other.&lt;ref&gt;Lévinas, ''Ethics and Infinity'', 1985, pp. 95, 98, 119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Marcus, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxP92H6LFs8C&amp;dq= ''In Search of the Good Life: Emmanuel Levinas, Psychoanalysis and the Art of Living''], Karnac Books, 2010, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Lévinas' phenomenological account of the "face-to-face" encounter serves as the basis for his [[ethics]] and the rest of his philosophy. For Lévinas, "Ethics is the first philosophy." Lévinas argues that the encounter of the [[Other (philosophy)|Other]] through the [[Face (sociological concept)|face]] reveals a certain poverty which forbids a reduction to [[identity (philosophy)|Sameness]] and, simultaneously, installs a responsibility for the Other in the [[Self (philosophy)|Self]].

Lévinas' account of the face-to-face encounter bears many similarities to [[Martin Buber]]'s "[[I and Thou]]" relation. Its influence is also particularly pronounced in [[Jacques Derrida]]'s ethical writings. (However, some post-structuralist thinkers maintain that Derrida does not agree with Lévinas. See, perhaps most significantly, [[Martin Hägglund]].)

The major difference between Buber's account of the [[I and Thou]] relation and the ethics of the face-to-face encounter is the application of Lévinas' asymmetry towards the other.  For Buber, ethical relation meant a "symmetrical co-presence," while Lévinas, on the other hand, considers the relation with the other as something inherently asymmetrical: the other as they appear, the face, gives itself priority to the self, its first demand even before I react to it, love it or kill it, is: "thou shalt not kill me". Such a demand for Lévinas is prior to any reaction or any assertion of freedom by a subject. The face of the other in this sense looms above the other person and traces "where God passes." God (the [[infinite Other]]) here refers to the God of which one cannot refuse belief in Its history, that is the God who appears in traditional belief and of scripture and not some conceptual God of philosophy or [[ontotheology]].

{{quote|The face, in its nudity and defenselessness, signifies: “Do not kill me.” This defenseless nudity is therefore a passive resistance to the desire that is my freedom. Any exemplification of the face's expression, moreover, carries with it this combination of resistance and defenselessness: Lévinas speaks of the face of the other who is “widow, orphan, or stranger.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/levinas/ |title=Emmanuel Levinas |first=Bettina |last=Bergo |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=2008-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the face-to-face encounter we also see how Lévinas splits ethics from morality.  Ethics marks the primary situation of the face-to-face whereas morality comes later, as some kind of, agreed upon or otherwise, set of rules that emerge from the social situation, wherein there are more than just the two people of the face-to-face encounter.
This ethical relation for Lévinas is prior to an [[ontology]] of nature, instead he refers to it as a [[meontology]], which affirms a meaning beyond [[Being]], a mode of non-Being (Greek: ''me on'').

==Comparison==
Face-to-face is similar to [[Mikhail Bakhtin]]'s ethical concept in art and answerability and [[Martin Heidegger]]'s concept of the authentic guilt (present/face-to-face) as opposed to an inauthentic other.

Daunizeau, "[http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~karl/Generalised%20Filtering.pdf Generalised Filtering]," [[Mathematical Problems in Engineering]], vol. vol., 2010, p. 621670, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on a [[Principle of least action|variational principle of least action]], formulated in generalized coordinates.&lt;ref&gt;B Balaji and K Friston, "[http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~karl/Bayesian%20State%20Estimation%20Using%20Generalized%20Coordinates.pdf Bayesian state estimation using generalized coordinates]," Proc. SPIE, p. 80501Y , 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Note that the concept of "generalized coordinates" as used here differs from the concept of [[generalized coordinates]] of motion as used in (multibody) dynamical systems analysis. Generalized filtering furnishes posterior densities over hidden states (and parameters) generating observed data using a generalized gradient descent on variational free energy, under the [[Laplace's method|Laplace assumption]]. Unlike classical (e.g., [[Kalman filter|Kalman-Bucy]] or [[Particle filter|particle]]) filtering, generalized filtering eschews Markovian assumptions about random fluctuations. Furthermore, it operates online, assimilating data to approximate the posterior density  over unknown quantities, without the need for a backward pass. Special cases include '''variational filtering''',&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; '''dynamic expectation maximization'''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and '''generalized predictive coding'''.

== Definition ==
'''Definition''': Generalized filtering rests on the [[tuple]] &lt;math&gt;(\Omega,U,X,S,p,q)&lt;/math&gt;:
* ''A sample space'' &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;  from which random fluctuations &lt;math&gt;\omega \in \Omega&lt;/math&gt;  are drawn
* ''Control states'' &lt;math&gt;U \in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; – that act as external causes, input or forcing terms 
* ''Hidden states''  &lt;math&gt;X:X \times U \times \Omega \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; – that cause sensor states and depend on control states
* ''Sensor states''  &lt;math&gt;S:X \times U \times \Omega \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; – a probabilistic mapping from hidden and control states 
* ''Generative density''  &lt;math&gt;p(\tilde{s},\tilde{x},\tilde{u}\mid m)&lt;/math&gt; – over sensory, hidden and control states under a generative model &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;
* ''Variational density'' &lt;math&gt;q(\tilde{x},\tilde{u}\mid \tilde{\mu})&lt;/math&gt;  – over hidden and control states with mean &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\mu} \in \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt;

 
Here ~ denotes a variable in generalized coordinates of motion: &lt;math&gt;\tilde{u} = [u,u',u'',\ldots]^T&lt;/math&gt;

=== Generalized filtering ===
The objective is to approximate the posterior density over hidden and control states, given sensor states and a generative model – and estimate the (path integral of) [[Marginal likelihood|model evidence]]  &lt;math&gt;p(\tilde{s}(t)\vert m)&lt;/math&gt; to compare different models. This generally involves an intractable marginalization over hidden states, so model evidence (or marginal likelihood) is replaced with a variational free energy bound.&lt;ref&gt;R P Feynman, Statistical mechanics. Reading MA: Benjamin, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; Given the following definitions:

: &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\mu}(t) = \underset{\tilde{\mu}}{\operatorname{arg\,min}} \{F(\tilde{{s}}(t),\tilde{{\mu }})\}  &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; G(\tilde{s},\tilde{x},\tilde{u})=-\ln p(\tilde{s},\tilde{x},\tilde{u}\vert m) &lt;/math&gt;

Denote the [[Entropy (information theory)|Shannon entropy]] of the density &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;H[q]=E_q[-\log(q)]&lt;/math&gt;. We can then write the variational free energy in two ways:

: &lt;math&gt; F(\tilde{s}, \tilde\mu)=E_q [G(\tilde{s},\tilde{x},\tilde{u})]-H[q(\tilde{x},\tilde{u} \vert \tilde{\mu})] =-\ln p(\tilde{s} \vert m)+D_{KL} [q(\tilde{x},\tilde{u} \vert \tilde{\mu})\vert \vert p(\tilde{x},\tilde{u} \vert \tilde{s},m)]  &lt;/math&gt;

The second equality shows that minimizing variational free energy (i) minimizes the [[Kullback–Leibler divergence|Kullback-Leibler divergence]] between the variational and true posterior density and (ii) renders the variational free energy (a bound approximation to) the negative log evidence (because the divergence can never be less than zero).&lt;ref&gt;M J Beal, "[http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/faculty/mbeal/papers/beal03.pdf Variational Algorithms for Approximate Bayesian Inference]," PhD. Thesis, University College London, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Laplace assumption &lt;math&gt;q(\tilde{x},\tilde{{u}}\mid \tilde{\mu})=\mathcal{N}(\tilde{\mu},C)&lt;/math&gt; the variational density is Gaussian and the precision that minimizes free energy is &lt;math&gt;C^{-1}=\Pi =\partial_{\tilde{\mu}\tilde{\mu}} G(\tilde{\mu})&lt;/math&gt;. This means that free-energy can be expressed in terms of the variational mean &lt;ref&gt;K Friston, J Mattout, N Trujillo-Barreto, J Ashburner, and W Penny, "[http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~karl/Variational%20free%20energy%20and%20the%20Laplace%20approximation.pdf Variational free energy and the Laplace approximation]," NeuroImage, vol. 34, no. 1, pp. 220-34, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; (omitting constants):

: &lt;math&gt;F=G(\tilde{\mu})+\textstyle{1 \over 2}\ln \vert \partial_{\tilde{\mu}\tilde{\mu}} G(\tilde{\mu})\vert&lt;/math&gt;

The variational means that minimize the (path integral) of free energy can now be recovered by solving the generalized filter:

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\tilde{\mu}}=D\tilde{\mu}-\partial_{\tilde{\mu}} F(\tilde{s},\tilde{\mu})&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is a block matrix derivative operator of identify matrices such that &lt;math&gt;D\tilde{u}=[u',u'',\ldots ]^T&lt;/math&gt;

=== Variational basis ===

Generalized filtering is based on the following lemma: ''The self-consistent solution to'' &lt;math&gt;\dot{\tilde{\mu}}=D\tilde{\mu}-\partial_{\tilde{\mu}} F(s,\tilde{\mu})&lt;/math&gt; ''satisfies the variational [[Principle of least action|principle of stationary action]], where action is the path integral of variational free energy''

: &lt;math&gt;S=\int dt\, F(\tilde{s}(t),\tilde{\mu}(t))&lt;/math&gt;

'''Proof''': self-consistency requires the motion of the mean to be the mean of the motion and (by the [[Fundamental lemma of calculus of variations|fundamental lemma of variational calculus]])

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\tilde{\mu}} = D\tilde{\mu}\Leftrightarrow \partial_{\tilde{\mu}} F(\tilde{s},\tilde{\mu}) = 0\Leftrightarrow \delta_{\tilde{\mu}} S=0&lt;/math&gt;

Put simply, small perturbations to the path of the mean do not change variational free energy and it has the least action of all possible (local) paths.

'''Remarks''': Heuristically, generalized filtering performs a gradient descent on variational free energy in a moving frame of reference: &lt;math&gt;\dot{{\tilde{{\mu }}}}-D\tilde{{\mu }}=-\partial_{\tilde{\mu}} F(s,\tilde{\mu})&lt;/math&gt;, where the frame itself minimizes variational free energy. For a related example in statistical physics, see Kerr and Graham &lt;ref&gt;W C Kerr and A J Graham, "[http://epjb.epj.org/articles/epjb/abs/2000/10/b9689/b9689.html Generalised phase space version of Langevin equations and associated Fokker-Planck equations]," Eur. Phys. J. B., vol. 15, pp. 305-11, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; who use ensemble dynamics in generalized coordinates to provide a generalized phase-space version of Langevin and associated Fokker-Planck equations.

In practice, generalized filtering uses [[Linearization|local linearization]] &lt;ref&gt;T Ozaki, "[http://www3.stat.sinica.edu.tw/statistica/oldpdf/A2n16.pdf A bridge between nonlinear time-series models and nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems: A local linearization approach]," Statistica Sin., vol. 2, pp. 113-135, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; over intervals &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; to recover discrete updates

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\Delta \tilde{\mu} &amp; =(\exp (\Delta t\cdot J)-I)J^{-1}\dot{\tilde{\mu}} \\
J &amp; =\partial_{\tilde{\mu}} \dot{\tilde{\mu}} =D-\partial _{\tilde{\mu}\tilde{\mu}} F(\tilde{s},\tilde{\mu})
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This updates the means of hidden variables at each interval (usually the interval between observations).

== Generative (state-space) models in generalized coordinates ==

Usually, the generative density or model is specified in terms of a nonlinear input-state-output model with continuous nonlinear functions:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
         s &amp; = g(x,u)+\omega_s \\
 \dot{{x}} &amp; = f(x,u)+\omega_x
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The corresponding generalized model (under local linearity assumptions) obtains the from the chain rule

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 \tilde{s} &amp; =\tilde{g}(\tilde{x},\tilde{u})+\tilde{\omega}_s \\ 
 \\ 
     s &amp; =g(x,u)+\omega_s \\
  s' &amp; =\partial_x g\cdot x'+\partial_u g\cdot u'+\omega'_s \\ 
 s'' &amp; =\partial_x g\cdot x''+\partial_u g\cdot u''+\omega''_s
\\
&amp;  \vdots \\
 \end{align} \qquad \begin{align}
 \dot{\tilde{x}}  &amp; =\tilde{f}(\tilde{x},\tilde{u})+\tilde{\omega}_x \\ 
 \\
 \dot{x} &amp; =f(x,u)+\omega_x \\ 
 \dot{x}' &amp; =\partial_x f\cdot x'+\partial_u f\cdot u'+\omega'_x \\ 
 \dot{x}''&amp; =\partial_x f\cdot x''+\partial_u f\cdot u''+\omega''_x \\ 
 &amp; \vdots 
 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Gaussian assumptions about the random fluctuations &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; then prescribe the likelihood and empirical priors on the motion of hidden states

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 p\left( \tilde{s},\tilde{x},\tilde{u}\vert m \right) &amp; = p\left( \tilde{s}\vert \tilde{x},\tilde{u},m \right)p\left( {D\tilde{x}\vert x,\tilde{u},m} \right)p(x\vert m)p(\tilde{u}\vert m) \\ 
 p\left( \tilde{s}\vert \tilde{x},\tilde{u},m \right) &amp; = \mathcal{N}(\tilde{g}(\tilde{x},\tilde{u}),\tilde{\Sigma}(\tilde{x},\tilde{u})_s) \\ 
 p\left( {D\tilde{{x}}\vert x,\tilde{{u}},m} \right) &amp; = {\mathcal{N}}(\tilde{f}(\tilde{x},\tilde{u}),\tilde{\Sigma}(\tilde{x},\tilde{u})_x ) \\ 
 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The covariances &lt;math&gt;\tilde{{\Sigma }}=V\otimes \Sigma&lt;/math&gt; factorize into a covariance among variables and correlations &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; among generalized fluctuations that encodes their [[autocorrelation]]:

: &lt;math&gt;V=\begin{bmatrix}
 1  &amp; 0  &amp; \ddot{\rho}(0) &amp; \cdots  \\
 0  &amp; -\ddot{\rho}(0)  &amp; 0 \ &amp; \ \\
 \ddot{\rho}(0) \ &amp; 0 \ &amp; \ddot{\ddot{\rho}}(0) \ &amp; \ \\
 \vdots \ &amp; \ &amp; \ &amp; \ddots \ \\
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;\ddot{{\rho }}(0)&lt;/math&gt; is the second derivative of the autocorrelation function evaluated at zero. This is a ubiquitous measure of roughness in the theory of [[stochastic processes]].&lt;ref&gt;D R Cox and H D Miller, The theory of stochastic processes. London: Methuen, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; Crucially, the precision (inverse variance) of high order derivatives fall to zero fairly quickly, which means it is only necessary to model relatively low order generalized motion (usually between two and eight) for any given or parameterized autocorrelation function.

== Special cases ==

=== Filtering discrete time series ===

When time series are observed as a discrete sequence of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; observations, the implicit sampling is treated as part of the generative process, where (using [[Taylor's theorem]])

: &lt;math&gt; [s_1 ,\dots ,s_N ]^T = (E\otimes I)\cdot \tilde{s}(t): \qquad E_{ij} =\frac{(i-t)^{(j-1)}}{(j-1)!} &lt;/math&gt;

In principle, the entire sequence could be used to estimate hidden variables at each point in time. However, the precision of samples in the past and future falls quickly and can be ignored. This allows the scheme to assimilate data online, using local observations around each time point (typically between two and eight).

=== Generalized filtering and model parameters ===

For any slowly varying model parameters of the equations of motion &lt;math&gt;f(x,u,\theta )&lt;/math&gt; or precision &lt;math&gt;\tilde{{\Pi }}(x,u,\theta )&lt;/math&gt; generalized filtering takes the following form (where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the variational mean of the parameters)

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \dot{\mu} &amp; = \mu' \\ 
 \dot{\mu'} &amp; = -\partial_\mu F(\tilde{s},\mu )-\kappa \mu'
 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Here, the solution &lt;math&gt;\dot{{\tilde{{\mu }}}}=0&lt;/math&gt; minimizes variational free energy, when the motion of the mean is small. This can be seen by noting &lt;math&gt;\dot{{\mu }}={\dot{{\mu }}}'=0\Rightarrow \partial_{\mu } F=0\Rightarrow \delta_{\mu } S=0&lt;/math&gt;. It is straightforward to show that this solution corresponds to a classical [[Newton's method in optimization|Newton update]].&lt;ref&gt;K Friston, K Stephan, B Li, and J. Daunizeau, "Generalised Filtering," Mathematical Problems in Engineering, vol. vol., 2010, p. 621670, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship to Bayesian filtering and predictive coding ==

=== Generalized filtering and Kalman filtering ===

Classical filtering under Markovian or Wiener assumptions is equivalent to assuming the precision of the motion of random fluctuations is zero. In this limiting case, one only has to consider the states and their first derivative &lt;math&gt;\tilde{{\mu }}=(\mu ,{\mu }')&lt;/math&gt;. This means generalized filtering takes the form of a Kalman-Bucy filter, with prediction and correction terms:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \dot{\mu} &amp; = \mu'-\partial_\mu F(s,\tilde{\mu}) \\ 
 \dot{\mu'}  &amp; =-\partial_{\mu'} F(s,\tilde{\mu}) 
 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting this first-order filtering into the discrete update scheme above gives the equivalent of (extended) Kalman filtering.&lt;ref&gt;K J Friston, N Trujillo-Barreto, and J Daunizeau, "DEM: A variational treatment of dynamic systems," Neuroimage, vol. 41, no. 3, pp. 849-85, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Generalized filtering and particle filtering ===

[[Particle filter]]ing is a sampling-based scheme that relaxes assumptions about the form of the variational or approximate posterior density. The corresponding generalized filtering scheme is called '''variational filtering'''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;K J Friston, "[http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~karl/Variational%20filtering.pdf Variational filtering]," Neuroimage, vol. 41, no. 3, pp. 747-66, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In variational filtering, an ensemble of particles diffuse over the free energy landscape in a frame of reference that moves with the expected (generalized) motion of the ensemble. This provides a relatively simple scheme that eschews Gaussian (unimodal) assumptions. Unlike particle filtering it does not require proposal densities—or the elimination or creation of particles.

=== Generalized filtering and variational Bayes ===

[[Variational Bayesian methods|Variational Bayes]] rests on a mean field partition of the variational density:

: &lt;math&gt;q(\tilde{x},\tilde{u},\theta \dots \vert \tilde{\mu},\mu 
)=q(\tilde{x},\tilde{u}\vert \tilde{\mu})q(\theta \vert \mu 
)\dots&lt;/math&gt;

This partition induces a variational update or step for each marginal density—that is usually solved analytically using conjugate priors. In generalized filtering, this leads to '''dynamic expectation maximisation'''.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;K J Friston, N Trujillo-Barreto, and J Daunizeau, "[http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~karl/DEM%20A%20variational%20treatment%20of%20dynamic%20systems.pdf DEM: A variational treatment of dynamic systems]," Neuroimage, vol. 41, no. 3, pp. 849-85, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; that comprises a D-step that optimizes the sufficient statistics of unknown states, an E-step for parameters and an M-step for precisions.

=== Generalized filtering and predictive coding ===

Generalized filtering is usually used to invert hierarchical models of the following form

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\tilde{s} &amp; =\tilde{{g}}^1 (\tilde{x}^1,\tilde{u}^{(1)})+\tilde{\omega}_s^{(1)} \\ 
\dot{\tilde{x}}^{(1)} &amp; =\tilde{f}^{(1)}(\tilde{x}^{(1)},\tilde{u}^{(1)})+\tilde{\omega}_{x}^{(1)} \\ 
 \vdots \\
\tilde{u}^{(i-1)} &amp; =\tilde{g}^{(i)}(\tilde{x}^{(i)},\tilde{u}^{(i)})+\tilde{\omega}_u^{(i)} \\ 
\dot{\tilde{x}}^{(i)} &amp; =\tilde{f}^{(i)}(\tilde{x}^{(i)},\tilde{u}^{(i)})+\tilde{\omega}_x^{(i)} \\ 
 \vdots
 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The ensuing generalized gradient descent on free energy can then be expressed compactly in terms of prediction errors, where (omitting high order terms):

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \dot{\tilde{\mu}}_u^{(i)} &amp; =D\tilde{\mu}^{(u,i)}-\partial_u \tilde{\varepsilon}^{(i)}\cdot \Pi^{(i)}\tilde{\varepsilon}^{(i)}
-\Pi^{(i+1)}\tilde{\varepsilon}_u^{(i+1)} \\ 
 \dot{\tilde{\mu}}_x^{(i)} &amp; =D\tilde{\mu}^{(x,i)}-\partial_x \tilde{\varepsilon}^{(i)}\cdot \Pi^{(i)}\tilde{\varepsilon}^{(i)} \\ 
 \\
 \tilde{\varepsilon}_u^{(i)} &amp; =\tilde{\mu}_u^{(i-1)} -\tilde{g}^{(i)} \\ 
 \tilde{\varepsilon}_x^{(i)} &amp; =D\tilde{\mu}_x^{(i)} -\tilde{f}^{(i)}
 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;\Pi^{(i)}&lt;/math&gt; is the precision of random fluctuations at the ''i''-th level. This is known as generalized predictive coding [11], with [[linear predictive coding]] as a special case.

== Applications ==

Generalized filtering has been primarily applied to biological timeseries—in particular functional magnetic resonance imaging and electrophysiological data. This is usually in the context of [[dynamic causal modelling]] to make inferences about the underlying architectures of (neuronal) systems generating data.&lt;ref&gt;J Daunizeau, O David, and K E Stephan, "[http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~jdaunize/publications/dcm_review.pdf Dynamic causal modelling: a critical review of the biophysical and statistical foundations]," Neuroimage, vol. 58, no. 2, pp. 312-22, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used to simulate inference in terms of generalized (hierarchical) predictive coding in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;K Friston, "[http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~karl/Hierarchical%20Models%20in%20the%20Brain.pdf Hierarchical models in the brain]," PLoS Comput. Biol., vol. 4, no. 11, p. e1000211, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48454">A '''hub-and-spoke conspiracy''' (or '''hub-and-spokes conspiracy''') is a legal construct or doctrine of United States antitrust and criminal law.&lt;ref&gt;The U.S. use of the doctrine can be traced to an origin in the 1930s or 1940s. See ''Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. United States'', 306 U.S. 208 (1939); ''Kotteakos v. United States'', 328 U.S. 750 (1946). But since 2000 European cartel authorities have begun to use the concept. See, e.g.,  [http://www.catribunal.org.uk/files/Jdg_CoA_1014Argos_Little_JJB191006.pdf ''JJB Sports PLC v Office of Fair Trading''], [2006] EWCA Civ 1318(UK Ct App 2003).&lt;br&gt;See also {{cite AustLII|FCA|1813|1996|litigants=News Ltd v Australian Rugby League Ltd (No 2) |parallelcite=(1996) 64 [[Federal Court Reports|FCR]] 410 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In such a conspiracy, several parties ("spokes") enter into an unlawful agreement with a leading party ("hub"). The [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit]] explained the concept in these terms:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In a "hub-and-spoke conspiracy," a central mastermind, or "hub," controls numerous "spokes," or secondary co-conspirators. These co-conspirators participate in independent transactions with the individual or group of individuals at the "hub" that collectively further a single, illegal enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Newton'', 326 F.3d 253, 255 n.2 (1st Cir. 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]] explained the concept in these terms:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Such a conspiracy involves a hub, generally the dominant purchaser or supplier in the relevant market, and the spokes, made up of the distributors involved in the conspiracy. The rim of the wheel is the connecting agreements among the horizontal competitors (distributors) that form the spokes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1921/howard-hess-dental-v-dentsply-intern/ ''Howard Hess Dental Labs. Inc. v. Dentsply Int’l, Inc.'', 602 F.3d 237, 255 (3d Cir. 2010).]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The antitrust cases often emphasize the importance of interdependence among the spokes and their recognition of one another. The general criminal cases, such as narcotics conspiracy prosecutions, tend to require only a more general knowledge among the spokes that there is a larger overall unlawful scheme involving other actors who are cooperating with the hub in carrying out the scheme. It is controversial, particularly in the antitrust cases, how much knowledge spoke actors must have of the conduct of other spoke actors—which is to say how much of a "rim" must be put around the "wheel" of the hub-and-spoke conspiracy for it to be a single conspiracy rather than many separate "vertical" conspiracies. There is a controversy and some uncertainty over the legal status of the "rimless" conspiracy—one with very limited interaction among the spokes.

==History==

The leading two Supreme Court cases were ''Interstate Circuit'' and ''Kotteakos''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/306/208/case.html ''Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. United States''], 306 U.S. 208 (1939); [https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/328/750/case.html ''Kotteakos v. United States''], 328 U.S. 750 (1946).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interstate Circuit===

In [https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/306/208/case.html ''[[Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. United States]]''],&lt;ref&gt;306 U.S. 208 (1939).&lt;/ref&gt; the Government sued two groups of defendants for engaging in a price-fixing conspiracy. One group of eight defendants were distributors (such as Paramount Pictures) of motion picture films, that distributed about 75 percent of all first-class feature films exhibited in the United States.. A second group of defendants were two dominant theater owners in Texas and New Mexico—Interstate Circuit and a related company—which had a monopoly of first-run theaters in various cities.&lt;ref&gt;306 U.S. at 214-15.&lt;/ref&gt;
The manager of the defendant theater owners sent a same or similar letter to each of the distributor defendants, naming on its face as addressees all of the defendant distributors. The letter demanded as a condition of continued dealing that the distributor (1) require that second-run theaters never exhibit the films at a smaller admission price than 25¢, and (2) never exhibit them in conjunction with another feature picture (so-called double features). Conferences discussing the matter were held between representatives of Interstate and individual distributors. The distributors each agreed and complied with the demands.&lt;ref&gt;306 U.S. at 216-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court held it permissible to draw "the inference of agreement from the nature of the proposals made .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.[and] from the substantial unanimity of action taken upon them by the distributors." The Court emphasized that each distributor knew that the distributors all knew that the others were getting the same letter and knew that "without substantially unanimous action with respect to the restrictions for any given territory, there was risk of a substantial loss of the business and goodwill of the subsequent-run and independent exhibitors, but that, with it, there was the prospect of increased profits." The Court said that provided "strong motive for concerted action."&lt;ref&gt;306 U.S. at 221–22.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court added:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It was enough that, knowing that concerted action was contemplated and invited, the distributors gave their adherence to the scheme and participated in it. Each distributor was advised that the others were asked to participate; each knew that cooperation was essential to successful operation of the plan. .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. Acceptance by competitors, without previous agreement, of an invitation to participate in a plan the necessary consequence of which, if carried out, is restraint of interstate commerce is sufficient to establish an unlawful conspiracy under the Sherman Act.&lt;ref&gt;306 U.S. at 226–27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Kotteakos===

In [https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/328/750/case.html ''Kotteakos v. United States''],&lt;ref&gt;328 U.S. 750 (1946).&lt;/ref&gt; Simon Brown, owner of a construction company, conspired with Kotteakos and 31 other persons to defraud the Government by filing false statements in applications for loans for modernization and renovation under the National Housing Act. No connections was shown between the individual loan applicants. In each case, however, Brown induced the applicants to file the loan application and assisted them in applying, in return for a 5% commission.

[[File:Logoruota-romani.svg|thumb|100px|right]]

The Court characterized the facts as showing: "As the Government puts it, the pattern was 'that of separate spokes meeting at a common center,' though we may add without the rim of the wheel to enclose the spokes." The Court therefore held that while the indictment alleged one conspiracy the Government proved several (at least eight) conspiracies.&lt;ref&gt;328 U.S. at 755.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the Government failed to demonstrate the rim of the wheel, that connected the spokes to one another. "Without the rim, an alleged hub-and-spoke cartel is merely a set of vertical relationships (or restraints) that result in parallel conduct and does not establish" a hub-and-spoke conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;Barak Orbach, [http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publishing/antitrust_source/apr16_orbach_4_11f.authcheckdam.pdf '' Hub-and-Spoke Conspiracies''], {{smallcaps|the antitrust source}} (April 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent Supreme Court hub-and-spoke conspiracy cases==

Since ''Interstate Circuit'', the Supreme Court decided four hub-and-spoke conspiracy cases and one case rejecting a parallel-action conspiracy claim.

===Masonite===

''[[United States v. Masonite Corp.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;316 U.S. 265 (1942),&lt;/ref&gt; was a patent–antitrust price-fixing case, in which the patent holder negotiated licenses with price-fixing clauses while resolving infringement disputes with some of the licensees. The Supreme Court said that each licensee “acted independently of the others, negotiated only with [the patent holder], desired the agreement regardless of the action that might be taken by any of the others, did not require as a condition of its acceptance . . . an agreement with any of the others, and had no discussions with any of the others."&lt;ref&gt;316 U.S. at 275.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the Court applied ''Interstate Circuit'' because:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is not clear at what precise point of time each [defendant licensee] became aware of the fact that its contract was not an isolated transaction but part of a larger arrangement. But it [was] clear that as the arrangement continued each became familiar with its purpose and scope.”&lt;ref&gt;316 U.S. at 275.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Accordingly, even if the evidentiary requirements of ''Interstate Circuit'' were not met at the outset of the cartel arrangement, they were met after it remained in place. "It was enough that, knowing that concerted action was contemplated and invited, the distributors gave their adherence to the scheme and participated in it."

===Blumenthal===

In ''Blumenthal v. United States'', the Supreme Court looked at the other side of the coin of ''Kotteakos''. The Court distinguished the ''Kotteakos'' case involving several conspiracies from the case before it involving one conspiracy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[In ''Kotteakos''] no two of those agreements were tied together as stages in the formation of a larger all-inclusive combination, all directed to achieving a single unlawful end or result. On the contrary each separate agreement had its own distinct, illegal end. Each loan was an end in itself, separate from all others, although all were alike in having similar illegal objects. Except for Brown, the common figure, no conspirator was interested in whether any loan except his own went through. And none aided in any way, by agreement or otherwise, in procuring another's loan. The conspiracies therefore were distinct and disconnected, not parts of a larger general scheme, both in the phase of agreement with Brown and also in the absence of any aid given to others as well as in specific object and result. There was no drawing of all together in a single, over-all, comprehensive plan. Here the contrary is true. All knew of and joined in the overriding scheme.&lt;ref&gt;''Blumenthal v. United States'', 332 U.S. 539, 558 (1948).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Theater Enterprises===

In ''Theatre Enterprises, Inc. v. Paramount Film Distributing Corp.'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/346/537/case.html 346 U.S. 537] (1954).&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court rejected a claim by a suburban theater owner (TEI) that a group of motion picture producers and distributors had violated the antitrust laws by conspiring to restrict first-run films to downtown Baltimore theaters, thus confining petitioner's suburban theater to subsequent runs and unreasonable "clearances." Each of the defendant motion picture producers and distributors refused to make first-run films available to TEI and adhered to an established policy of restricting first-runs in Baltimore to the eight downtown theaters. There was no direct evidence of illegal agreement among the defendants. The "crucial question" was whether the defendants' conduct against TEI "stemmed from independent decision or from an agreement, tacit or express." The lower court, in effect, refused to direct the jury to find a conspiracy based on the facts as to parallel refusals to deal with TEI. The Supreme Court said that was correct, because:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]his Court has never held that proof of parallel business behavior conclusively establishes agreement or, phrased differently, that such behavior itself constitutes a Sherman Act offense. Circumstantial evidence of consciously parallel behavior may have made heavy inroads into the traditional judicial attitude toward conspiracy, but "conscious parallelism" has not yet read conspiracy out of the Sherman Act entirely.&lt;ref&gt;346 U.S. at 541.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Klor's===

In ''[[Klor’s, Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/359/207/case.html 359 U.S. 207] (1959).&lt;/ref&gt; a major California department store, Broadway-Hale, induced  Admiral, Emerson Radio, General Electric, Philco, RCA, Whirlpool, Zenith, and other major appliance manufacturers to stop selling to Klor's, a price cutter in San Francisco. Klor's brought an antitrust treble damages suit, alleging a conspiracy among Broadway-Hale and the manufacturers. By pre-trial order the case one was limited to a single conspiracy charging a Sherman Act violation. The defendants moved for summary judgment, and the lower courts agreed, on the grounds that Klor's was only one of many stores selling such goods, so that its elimination as a competitive factor did not substantially lessen competition in the general market—there was no public injury. Whether a conspiracy existed was by-passed, even though the allegations appear to have described a rimless wheel conspiracy, without the spokes (appliance manufacturers) being connected to one another, knowing what one another were doing, or being interdependent. The Supreme Court reversed, on the grounds that Klor's sufficiently pleaded a boycott conspiracy. The Court said, "Alleged in this complaint is a wide combination consisting of manufacturers, distributors, and a retailer."&lt;ref&gt;359 U.S. at 213.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parke, Davis===

In ''[[United States v. Parke, Davis &amp; Co.]]''&lt;ref&gt;362 U.S. 29 (1960).&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court held it proper to infer a combination among a drug manufacturer, wholesalers, and retailers when the manufacturer engaged in a substantial course of concerted activities in order to stop discounters from selling its products below recommended resale prices. The manufacturer 
informed its wholesalers that it would terminate any wholesaler that sold its products to discounters, and enforced this policy. It discussed the policy with its wholesalers and retailers to secure adherence to it, and it put together an agreement among retailers not to advertise products at prices below those recommended. Parke Davis offered the retailers its products "packaged in a competition-free wrapping .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. by virtue of concerted action induced by the manufacturer." Parke Davis was "thus the organizer of a price maintenance combination or conspiracy in violation of the Sherman Act."

===General Motors===

In ''United States v. General Motors Corp.'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/384/127/case.html 384 U.S. 127] (1966).&lt;/ref&gt; a group of Chevrolet car dealers in the Los Angeles area persuaded GM to eliminate price cutters. In response to dealers' complaints organized by their trade associations, GM Los Angeles area officials treated the "principal offenders" to "unprecedented individual confrontations" and obtained promises to abandon the practices deemed objectionable. Most agreed promptly but one put off decision for a week "to make sure that the other dealers, or most of them, had stopped their business dealings with discount houses." A "joint effort between General Motors, the three [local dealer] associations, and a number of individual dealers" was organized to police compliance. GM local officials confronted reoffenders and required them to repurchase cars sold in violation of policy. "[T]he campaign to eliminate the discounters from commerce in new Chevrolet cars was a success."

The district court refused to find a Sherman Act violation. But the Supreme Court reversed. It explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The dealers collaborated, through the associations and otherwise, among themselves and with General Motors, both to enlist the aid of General Motors and to enforce dealers' promises to forsake the discounters. The associations explicitly entered into a joint venture to assist General Motors in policing the dealers' promises, and their joint proffer of aid was accepted and utilized by General Motors.&lt;ref&gt;384 at U.S. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Not only did the dealers conspire among themselves but they enlisted GM to act as the "hub" of the conspiracy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As Parke Davis had done, General Motors sought to elicit from all the dealers agreements, substantially interrelated and interdependent, that none of them would do business with the discounters. These agreements were hammered out in meetings between nonconforming dealers and officials of General Motors' Chevrolet Division, and in telephone conversations with other dealers. It was acknowledged from the beginning that substantial unanimity would be essential if the agreements were to be forthcoming. And once the agreements were secured, General Motors both solicited and employed the assistance of its alleged co-conspirators in helping to police them. What resulted was a fabric interwoven by many strands of joint action to eliminate the discounters from participation in the market, to inhibit the free choice of franchised dealers to select their own methods of trade, and to provide multilateral surveillance and enforcement. This process for achieving and enforcing the desired objective can by no stretch of the imagination be described as "unilateral" or merely "parallel."&lt;ref&gt;384 U.S. at 144-45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This conduct was illegal ''per se''. "Exclusion of traders from the market by means of combination or conspiracy is so inconsistent with the free market principles embodied in the Sherman Act that it is not to be saved by reference to the need for preserving the collaborators' profit margins or their system for distributing automobiles, any more than by reference to the allegedly tortious conduct against which a combination or conspiracy may be directed.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&lt;ref&gt;384 U.S. at 146.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it was price fxing.&lt;ref&gt;384 U.S. at 147-48.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent lower court cases==

The various courts of appeals have interpreted and modified the Supreme Court's rulings on hub-and-spoke conspiracies.

===Drug cases===

====Poliafico====

One of the cases that the Supreme Court relied on in ''Blumenthal'' was ''Poliafico''. In ''Poliafico v. United States'', the Sixth Circuit found a conspiracy to sell heroin among several suppliers in bulk and their retail supplier agents (street dealers) who retailed it to addicts in diluted form and in smaller quantities. The Sixth Circuit explained the structure of the hub-and-spoke conspiracy as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;All of the appellants were either selling heroin to Poliafico and his associates, or reselling it for them, or carrying on negotiations for such sales, or making payments therefor, or delivering heroin for resale, or reselling it. The purchase of heroin and the resale of heroin, in this case, was concerned with one enterprise, which could be called the Poliafico deal, in the parlance of the underworld. The over-all conspiracy was the plan, conceived by Poliafico and his associates, to buy and sell heroin at a profit. The [retail] suppliers knew that the purchases were for resale and they also knew that several conspirators were involved in the purchases.&lt;ref&gt;''Poliafico v. United States'', 237 F.2d 97, 103 (6th Cir. 1956).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The court said, "The fact that one such [retail] supplier did not have dealings with another [retail] supplier does not matter," because if "each performs the same role at successive stages for the same ends, and both know and participate in the plan of the others to buy and sell heroin at a profit, each is guilty as a conspirator."&lt;ref&gt;237 F.2d at 103-04.&lt;/ref&gt; The court explained its concept of a hub-and-spoke conspiracy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When two or more persons are shown to have been engaged in the same unlawful conspiracy, having for its object the same common and unlawful purpose, it is not necessary to prove the knowledge by one of the dealings, or even of the existence, of the others, in order to render evidence of the actions of those others admissible against that person. There was one conspiracy in this case — the continuing scheme of buying and reselling heroin.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; 
The proofs of the government show that all appellants were associated in this scheme, some by virtue of selling or delivering the heroin to the Poliafico group, others because of being associated with the group in carrying out the scheme, collecting money through resales of the drug, making payments to suppliers, or carrying on negotiations for the purchase or resale. All appellants knew of the conspiracy. The suppliers knew that the Poliafico group must resell the heroin at a profit; and all associated with Poliafico in the resale of the heroin knew that Poliafico must buy it from suppliers and that the resales must be at a profit.&lt;ref&gt;237 F.2d at 104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is not necessary for each conspirator to know the whole scope or all the details of the conspiracy. "He must know the [unlawful] purpose of the conspiracy, however, otherwise he is not guilty."&lt;ref&gt;237 F.2d at 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tramaglino====

Other narcotics conspiracy cases are similar. For example, in ''United States v. Tramaglino'',&lt;ref&gt;197 F.2d 928 (2d Cir. 1952).&lt;/ref&gt; a distinguished panel of the Second Circuit (Swan, A. Hand, and Frank) found a single conspiracy to buy and resell marijuana based on "evidence of several sales, at different periods, by Rosario and Tramaglino, of marihuana to the same group of buyers with knowledge on the part of the two suppliers that several conspirators were involved in the purchases and that the purchases were for resale." The court explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This was enough, we think, to show that each appellant, as supplier, participated in, and acted to further the ends of, the conspiracy. It did not matter that neither had dealings with one another; each performed the same role at successive stages for the same ends. The overall conspiracy was the plan conceived by the intermediary group — Alvarez, Zayas, and their fellows — to buy and resell marihuana at a profit. Both Rosario and Tramaglino knew and participated in this plan by furnishing the essential ingredient — the marihuana.&lt;ref&gt;197 F.2d at 930.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Chain conspiracy====

A closely related concept to the hub-and-spoke conspiracy, or a variation on it, is the chain conspiracy, which is linear rather than wheel-shaped. A representative example is ''United States v. Bruno''. In ''Bruno'' 88 people were alleged to be members of a single conspiracy to import, sell and possess narcotics. The evidence was that over a substantial period of time a conspiracy existed embracing a great number of persons. The object of the conspiracy was to smuggle narcotics into New York and distribute them to addicts both in New York and in Texas and Louisiana. "This required the cooperation of four groups of persons: the smugglers who imported the drugs; the middlemen who paid the smugglers and distributed to retailers; and two groups of retailers — one in New York and one in Texas and Louisiana — who supplied the addicts."&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Bruno'', 105 F.2d 921 (2d Cir. 1939) (L. Hand, J.).&lt;/ref&gt;

The defendants argued that there were at least three separate conspiracies: one between the smugglers and the middlemen, one in New York between the New York middlemen and group of retailers. and one in Texas and Louisiana between those middlemen and retailers. Since the evidence did not disclose any cooperation or communication between the smugglers and either group of retailers, or between the two groups of retailers themselves. However, insisted the court:

[[File:Twisted link chain.jpg|thumb|right|100px]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;The smugglers knew that the middlemen must sell to retailers, and the retailers knew that the middlemen must buy of importers of one sort or another. Thus the conspirators at one end of the chain knew that the unlawful business would not, and could not, stop with their buyers; and those at the other end knew that it had not begun with their sellers. That being true, a jury might have found that all the accused were embarked upon a [single] venture, in all parts of which each was a participant, and an abettor in the sense that the success of that part with which he was immediately concerned, was dependent upon the success of the whole.&lt;ref&gt;105 F.2d at 922.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There could also be two conspiracies—one in New York including the smugglers, the New York middlemen and the New York group of retailers; and the other including the smugglers, the Gulf Coast middlemen and the Gulf Coast group of retailers. There was apparently no contact between the two groups of retailers, possibly negating their being in a conspiracy together. "That too would be fallacious," the court said, because there was only one conspiracy as far as the defendant smugglers were concerned:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For it was of no moment to them whether the middlemen sold to one or more groups of retailers, provided they had a market somewhere. So too of any retailer; he knew that he was a necessary link in a scheme of distribution, and the others, whom he knew to be convenient to its execution, were as much parts of a single undertaking or enterprise as two salesmen in the same shop. We think therefore that there was only one conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;105 F.2d at 923.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To sustain a chain conspiracy charge, the evidence must establish "that each conspirator had the specific intent to further the common unlawful objective."&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Tarantino'', 846 F.2d 1384, 1392 (D.C. Cir. 1988).&lt;/ref&gt; It is immaterial that the individual co-conspirators do not know each other or meet. "Courts have long recognized that participants in a continuous drug distribution enterprise can be parties to a single conspiracy even if they do not all know one another, so long as each knows that his own role in the distribution of drugs and the benefits he derives from his participation depend on the activities of the others."&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Childress'', 58 F.3d 693, 709-10 (D.C. Cir. 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Elder-Beerman===

In ''Elder-Beerman Stores Corp. v. Federated Dept. Stores, Inc.'', the plaintiff retailer E–B claimed that the defendant Federated department store chain conspired with 66 (later 12) suppliers in violation of the antitrust laws. E–B argued that Federated (and/or its predecessor Rike's) and the suppliers conspired to destroy E–B's ability to compete on fair terms, and for the purpose of attempting to obtain a department store monopoly in the Dayton, Ohio area.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5983967853810117033&amp;q=309+F.3d+193&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=20006 ''Elder-Beerman Stores Corp. v. Federated Dept. Stores, Inc.''], 459 F. 2d 138, 139–40 (6th Cir. 1972).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sixth Circuit characterized E–B's legal theory as the "rimless wheel" theory. E–B contended that it had established a conspiracy by showing the following: Rike's used "coercion" to persuade some suppliers to grant Rike's the exclusive right to sell the merchandise involved; other suppliers granted exclusives to Rike's although E–B lacked evidence that Rike's had in fact used coercion to persuade them to do so; there was evidence of an exclusive relationship between Rike's and many of the suppliers; there was evidence of an exclusive arrangement resulting from "coercion" as to some of the suppliers; for the other suppliers, the basic evidence was they refused to sell to E–B; there was also evidence that Rike's refused to buy from certain suppliers who sold to E–B.&lt;ref&gt;459 F.2d at 141–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial court relied on ''Poliafico'' to find a single conspiracy. The Sixth Circuit said that in that case "by the very nature of the business everyone involved in the alleged conspiracy had to know that other persons would be performing illegal acts in furtherance of the conspiracy." It therefore appears that to establish a conspiracy under the rimless wheel theory, it must be shown:
:(1) that there is an overall-unlawful plan or "common design" in existence; 
:(2) that knowledge that others must be involved is inferable to each member because of his knowledge of the unlawful nature of the subject of the conspiracy but knowledge on the part of each member of the exact scope of the operation or the number of people involved is not required, and 
:(3) there must be a showing of each alleged member's participation.&lt;ref&gt;459 F.2d at 146.&lt;/ref&gt;
Since there was no evidence for each supplier that the supplier in fact had knowledge of the existence of such conspiracy, such a supplier could not be considered a spoke. "We, therefore, hold that on this record Elder-Beerman failed to offer sufficient probative evidence to establish the alleged single conspiracy upon which it bases its claim for damages." &lt;ref&gt;459 F.2d at 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

One judge dissented as to the conspiracy issue. He stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;According to Elder-Beerman's theory, Rike's was the hub of the conspiratorial wheel and its exclusive suppliers were the spokes. One of the important questions in this case is whether the suppliers (or any of them) agreed with each other, as well as with Rike's, to participate in the conspiracy. My colleagues believe, and I believe, that there was no such evidence in this record. In short, there was no rim to this wheel, or to put it in more conventional antitrust language, there was no proof of a horizontal conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;459 F.2d at 153.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, he considered it proper to find a single conspiracy as in ''Poliafico''. He found ''Kotteakos'' inapplicable because that was a ruling to protect the spokes from being tarred with one another's conduct after the hub had pleaded guilty. Here, in contrast, the supplier spokes are not in court, "and the case proceeds against the central party charged with the conspiracy, the hub of this particular wheel." Any error is harmless, he said, and the case is more like ''Klor's'' than like ''Kotteakos''.&lt;ref&gt;459 F.2d at 153–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toys "R" Us===

The ''Toys "R" Us'' chain of retail toy stores, the largest such U.S. chain (selling approximately 20% of all the toys sold in the United States), found itself encountering severe competition from price-cutting warehouse clubs. It became concerned that warehouse clubs—with substantially lower prices—presented a threat to its low-price image and its profits. The FTC determined that to eliminate this threat, Toys "R" Us used its dominant position as a toy distributor to extract parallel agreements from among ten principal toy manufacturers (such as Mattel, Hasbro, Fisher Price, Tyco, and Sega) to stop selling to warehouse clubs exactly the same toys that they sold to other toy distributors such as the clubs. The FTC explained that Toys "R" Us wanted "to prevent consumers from comparing the price and quality of products in the clubs to the price and quality of the same toys displayed and sold at Toys "R" Us, and thereby to reduce the effectiveness of the clubs as competitors."

The FTC found that Toys "R" Us also used the acquiescence of one manufacturer to obtain that of others, orchestrating a horizontal agreement among at least seven manufacturers to adhere to Toys "R" Us’s restrictions. The company also used the manufacturers to police one another. When one manufacturer complained that a competitor was selling to warehouse clubs, Toys "R" Us threatened to stop buying that competitor’s products and got its renewed acquiescence to the sales restrictions. The FTC found that the effect of the agreements was to eliminate competition that would have driven Toys "R" Us to lower its prices had Toys "R" Us not taken action to stifle the competitive threat posed by the clubs. The FTC concluded that "Toys "R" Us and its reluctant collaborators set out to eliminate from the marketplace a form of price competition and a style of service that increasing numbers of consumers preferred," and that Toys "R" Us’ had orchestrated a boycott that harmed the clubs, competition, and consumers without any "business justification for a boycott that had [such] a pronounced anticompetitive effect."&lt;ref&gt;''Toys “R” Us, Inc.'', 126 F.T.C. 415, 574–75 (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

In so ruling, the FTC emphasized that "key toy manufacturers were unwilling to refuse to sell to or discriminate against the clubs unless they were assured that their competitors would do the same,” and that Toy "R" Us "acted as the central player in the middle of what might be called a hub-and-spoke conspiracy, shuttling commitments back and forth between toy manufacturers and helping to hammer out points of shared understanding.”&lt;ref&gt;126 F.T.C. at 574.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Seventh Circuit affirmed, comparing the case to ''Interstate Circuit''. The court emphasized FTC findings supporting a hub-and-spoke theory. For example, a Toys "R" Us official testified, "We made a point to tell each of the vendors that we spoke to that we would be talking to our other key suppliers." Mattel and Hasbro executives testified that they went along with "the special warehouse club policy (or, in the Commission's more pejorative language, boycott)" only "because our competitors had agreed" to it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11480829751523506812&amp;q=221+F.3d+928&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=20006 ''Toys “R” Us, Inc. v. FTC''], 221 F.3d 928, 932–33 (7th Cir. 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Seventh Circuit acknowledged that "there must be some evidence that tends to exclude the possibility' that the alleged conspirators acted independently," but rejected the idea that "the Commission had to exclude all possibility that the manufacturers acted independently." But the FTC relied on evidence even more compelling than that in ''Interstate Circuit'' because it included direct communications and interdependence—the manufacturers testified that "the only condition on which each toy manufacturer would agree to [the boycott] demands was if it could be sure its competitors were doing the same thing." And "as is classically true in such cartels," the court said, "they were willing to do so only if TRU could protect them against cheaters."&lt;ref&gt;221 F.3d at 934-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dickson v. Microsoft===

In ''Dickson v. Microsoft Corp.'', the plaintiffs unsuccessfully argued that Microsoft had engaged in a hub-and-spoke conspiracy with three original equipment manufacturers (OEMs)—Compaq, Dell, and PB Electronics—to restrain trade, in violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act, in the sale of operating systems, word processing, and spreadsheet software, and also a conspiracy to maintain Microsoft's alleged monopolies in the same  markets, in violation of § 2 of the Sherman Act. The alleged conspiracy was a set of similar licensing agreements in which the licensees agreed: (1) not to remove icons, folders, or Start menu entries from the Windows desktop; (2) not to modify the initial Windows boot sequence; (3) to integrate Microsoft's Internet browser software Internet Explorer (IE) and other application software with Microsoft's operating system software; and (4) to long-term distribution contracts, exclusive dealing distribution arrangements, and per-processor license fees. In exchange, the OEM defendants received various benefits, including discounts on software and "greater cooperation from Microsoft in product development." The OEMs also gained various competitive advantages in selling computer hardware. The district court held that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, and dismissed the case. An appeal to the Fourth Circuit followed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6381104972216483819&amp;q=309+F.3d+193&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=20006 ''Dickson v. Microsoft Corp.''], 309 F.3d 193, 198–200 (4th Cir. 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fourth Circuit said that the allegations described a "rimless wheel" conspiracy or a hub-and-spoke conspiracy. Citing ''Kotteakos'', the court stated, "A rimless wheel conspiracy is one in which various defendants enter into separate agreements with a common defendant, but where the defendants have no connection with one another, other than the common defendant's involvement in each transaction." That is a hub-and-spoke conspiracy "without the rim of the wheel to enclose the spokes." The court added, "In ''Kotteakos'', the Supreme Court made clear that a rimless wheel conspiracy is not a single, general conspiracy but instead amounts to multiple conspiracies between the common defendant and each of the other defendants." Thus, the hub-and-spoke conspiracy claim failed. The claim of separate vertical conspiracies, however, potentially survived a motion to dismiss.&lt;ref&gt;309 F.3d at 203-05.&lt;/ref&gt; The Fourth Circuit dismissed the complaint, however, on other grounds, including insufficient likelihood of substantial anticompetitive effects.

A dissenting judge distinguished ''Kotteakos'' from this case and would have found a sufficient allegation of a conspiracy. The missing element in ''Kotteakos'' was interdependence; each of the other defendants used Brown's services independently of every other defendant's use. The rimless conspiracy pleaded here had as its elements: (1) an overall unlawful plan; (2) knowledge that others must be involved is inferable to each member, because of his knowledge of the unlawful nature of the subject of the conspiracy, but knowledge on the part of each member of the exact scope of the operation or the number of people involved is not required; and (3) each alleged co-conspirator participated in some way. The dissent argued that the allegations were that "each OEM joined a conspiracy which it knew was, by its nature, broader than just itself and Microsoft." The dissent said this satisfied the Supreme Court's language on hub-and-spoke conspiracy in ''Interstate Circuit'' ("[I]t is elementary that an unlawful conspiracy may be and often is formed without simultaneous action or agreement on the part of the conspirators") and ''Masonite'' ("Here, as in ''Interstate Circuit'', .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. [i]t was enough that, knowing that concerted action was contemplated and invited, the distributors gave their adherence to the scheme and participated in it.").&lt;ref&gt;309 F.3d at 216-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===PepsiCo v. Coca-Cola===

In ''PepsiCo, Inc. v. Coca-Cola Co.'', the Second Circuit rejected PepsiCo's claim that it had shown a hub-and-spoke conspiracy that Coca-Cola put together with independent food service distributors ("IFDs"), prohibiting the IFDs from delivering PepsiCo products to any of their customers. Coca-Cola had a "loyalty program" that provided that IFDs who supply customers with Coca-Cola may not "handle [&amp;#8239;] the soft drink products" of PepsiCo, under penalty of termination. PepsiCo had sued Coca-Cola, charging that the enforcement of the program violated Sherman Act § 1's per se rule against boycotts, but the court granted summary judgment because it found that PepsiCo failed to prove a horizontal agreement among IFDs to boycott PepsiCo. PepsiCo offered no evidence of direct communications among the IFDs; it offered only to prove that Coca-Cola assured the IFDs that the loyalty policy would be uniformly enforced and encouraged them to report violations. The Second Circuit said, "We agree with the district court that this was insufficient evidence of a horizontal agreement to withstand summary judgment."&lt;ref&gt;''PepsiCo, Inc. v. Coca-Cola Co.'', [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3157695759800147418&amp;q=315+F.3d+101&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=20006 315 F.3d 101, 109–11 (2d Cir. 2002).]&lt;/ref&gt;

PepsiCo argued that it had shown a per se illegal hub-and-spoke conspiracy. But the Second Circuit said the cases on which PepsiCo relied were price-fixing hub-and-spoke cases, such as ''Interstate Circuit'' and ''Parke, Davis'', which were based on ''per se'' illegal conduct. But vertical exclusive dealing agreements are not ''per se'' illegal, so that hub-and-spoke conspiracies to establish exclusive dealing are mot ''per se'' illegal. To be ''per se'' illegal as a boycott, the IFDs must agree together not to deal with PepsiCo. "A horizontal agreement is a prerequisite in a group boycott case."&lt;ref&gt;315 F.3d at 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it did not say so, the court apparently thought PepsiCo had shown merely a rimless wheel.

===Apple (eBook Case)===

In ''United States v. Apple, Inc.'' (the ''eBook'' case), Apple decided to enter the electronic book business, which was dominated by Amazon, which sold about 90% of the ebooks of the six major U.S. publishers. Apple persuaded five of these Big 6 publishers to enter into agency distribution agreements with it as principal and them as agent. The agreements set prices, and the publishers raised their prices. Apple had established a cartel for the publishers. The district court found a hub-and-spoke price-fixing conspiracy and the Second Circuit affirmed.&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Apple Inc.'', 952 F. Supp. 2d 638, 694–695 (S.D.N.Y. 2013), aff'd, 791 F.3d 290, 313–14 (2d Cir. 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Apple unsuccessfully argued that the ''per se'' rule should not apply to a hub-and-spoke price-fixing conspiracy because it was "vertical."

===Guitar Center===

In the ''Guitar Center'' case,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leagle.com/decision/In%20FCO%2020150825175/IN%20RE%20MUSICAL%20INSTRUMENTS%20&amp;%20EQUIP.%20ANTITRUST%20LITIGATION ''In re Musical Instruments and Equip. Antitrust Litig. (Guitar Center)''], 798 F.3d 1186 (9th Cir. 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; the Ninth Circuit considered an alleged hub-and-spoke conspiracy case similar to ''Klor's'' and ''Interstate Circuit'', but the court (2-1) found it implausible that the spokes conspired rather than merely acting independently in a parallel fashion. Guitar Center, the largest retail seller of musical instruments in the United States, accounted for about a third of all U.S. retail sales of guitars and guitar amplifiers. It was alleged that Guitar Center, a trade association of music retailers, and the five major manufacturers of guitars and guitar amplifiers conspired to set minimum prices at which any retailer could advertise the manufacturers' guitars and guitar amplifiers, in violation of the antitrust laws.&lt;ref&gt;798 F.3d 1189-90.&lt;/ref&gt; The district court dismissed the federal antitrust claim on the pleadings.&lt;ref&gt;''In re Nat'l Ass'n of Music Merchs., No. MDL No. 2121, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118827 (S.D. Cal. Aug. 17, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

On appeal to the Ninth Circuit, the court conceded that "the line between horizontal and vertical restraints can blur," and a "conspiracy can involve both direct competitors and actors up and down the supply chain, and hence consist of both horizontal and vertical agreements," as in a hub-and-spoke conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;798 F.3d at 1192.&lt;/ref&gt; The court saw the key question before it as "whether plaintiffs have pleaded sufficient facts to provide a plausible basis from which we can infer the alleged [manufacturers' horizontal] agreements' existence.&lt;ref&gt;798 F.3d at 1193.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The court noted "one key difference between a rimless hub-and-spoke conspiracy (i.e., a collection of purely vertical agreements) and a rimmed hub-and-spoke conspiracy (i.e., a collection of vertical agreements joined by horizontal agreements)." The key difference was that "courts analyze vertical agreements under the rule of reason, whereas horizontal agreements are violations per se." The court then commented on the plaintiffs' motives:
&lt;blockquote&gt;This distinction provides strong incentives for plaintiffs to plead a horizontal conspiracy (either alone or as part of a rimmed hub-and-spoke conspiracy). The prospect of establishing a violation per se is much more appealing to plaintiffs than the potential difficulty and costliness of proving a § 1 claim under the rule of reason.&lt;ref&gt;798 F.3d at 1192 n.3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The plaintiffs relied on proof of the manufacturers' parallel conduct (they adopted the minimum price policy at about the same time) together with some so-called plus factors. The claim that the manufacturers' conduct was interdependent—that is, it would succeed only if they all did the same thing as appropriate united front—was not enough, the court said, because "companies base their actions in part on the anticipated reactions of their competitors. And because of this mutual awareness, two firms may arrive at identical decisions independently, as they are cognizant of—and reacting to—similar market pressures."&lt;ref&gt;798 F.3d at 1193.&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of plus factors is therefore critical. The court listed the plaintiffs' alleged plus factors—"economic actions and outcomes that are largely inconsistent with unilateral conduct but largely consistent with explicitly coordinated action"—that could make the manufacturers' parallel action appear to be the result of agreement, but dismissed each as insufficiently persuasive:
* defendants shared a common motive to conspire, but the court said that interdependent firms may engage in consciously parallel conduct through observation of their competitors' decisions, even absent an agreement;
* the manufacturers acted against their individual self-interest, but the court said that a firm can risk being the first to raise prices, confident that if its price is followed, all firms will benefit, and if they don’t follow the leader the firm can always drop the price back to avoid loss of market share; furthermore, that the manufacturers all responded to Guitar Center's pressure, heeding similar demands made by a common, important customer, does not suggest ''horizontal'' conspiracy or collusion, just self-interested independent parallel conduct in an interdependent market;
* the manufacturers simultaneously adopted substantially similar price policies, but the court said that simultaneity does not reveal anything more than similar reaction to similar pressures within an interdependent market;
* the FTC investigated the trade association defendant for the same practices, sued it, and the association accepted a consent decree, but the court said that did not prove a conspiracy occurred;
* the defendant manufacturers participated in the trade association's meetings urging adoption of the challenged pricing policy, but the court said listening to advocacy does not show an agreement; and 
* retail prices for guitars and guitar amplifiers rose during the class period as the number of units sold fell, but the court said a price increase is no more suggestive of collusion than it is of any other potential cause.
In the Ninth Circuit's view, all this showed was that "Guitar Center used its substantial market power to pressure each manufacturer to adopt similar policies, and each manufacturer adopted those policies as in its own interest."&lt;ref&gt;798 F.3d at 1195-98.&lt;/ref&gt; 

One judge dissented. He pointed out that "although the majority opinion purports to address the six plus factors as a whole, it actually focuses on each factor individually." In his view, "When truly analyzed together, the six plus factors strongly suggest that the manufacturer defendants reached an illegal horizontal agreement, which 'nudge' plaintiffs' allegations 'from conceivable to  plausible.'&amp;#8239;"&lt;ref&gt;798 F.3d at 1198-99.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commentary==

● Professor Orbach asserts that in the ''Guitar Center'' case "the Ninth Circuit made the error of trying to break the alleged conspiracy 'into its constituent parts, the respective vertical and horizontal agreements.'&amp;#8239;" Since this was a dismissal on the pleadings, the court's analysis "demand[s] that plaintiffs offer at the pleading stage evidence of direct horizontal coordination," which is a heavy burden. The result is that the court provides "a free pass to hub-and-spoke conspiracies where vertical communications may have dispensed with the need for such horizontal coordination."&lt;ref&gt; Barak Orbach, [http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publishing/antitrust_source/apr16_orbach_4_11f.authcheckdam.pdf '' Hub-and-Spoke Conspiracies''], {{smallcaps|the antitrust source}} 1, 11 (April 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides being an interesting means to visualise phenomena that are typical of the quantum mechanical world, floating droplets on a vibrating bath have interesting analogies with the [[pilot wave theory]], also known as the [[De Broglie–Bohm theory]], or the causal interpretation, one of the many interpretations of [[quantum mechanics]] in its early stages of conception and development. The theory was initially proposed by [[Louis de Broglie]] in 1927,&lt;ref&gt;

and later developed by [[David Bohm]]. It suggests that all particles in motion are actually borne on a wave-like motion, similar to how an object moves on a tide. In this theory, it is the evolution of the [[carrier wave]] that is given by the [[Schrödinger equation]]. It is a [[deterministic]] theory and is entirely [[Quantum nonlocality|nonlocal]]. It is an example of a [[hidden variable theory]], and all non-relativistic quantum mechanics can be accounted for in this theory. The theory was abandoned by de Broglie in 1932, and it gave way to the [[Copenhagen interpretation]]. The Copenhagen interpretation does not use the concept of the carrier wave or that a particle moves in definite paths until a measurement is made. 

== Physics of bouncing and walking droplets ==
=== History ===
Floating droplets on a vibrating bath were first described in writing by [[Jearl Walker]] in a 1978 article in ''Scientific American''. Recently in 2005, Yves Couder and his lab were the first to systematically study the dynamics of bouncing droplets and discovered most of the quantum mechanical analogs. John Bush and his lab expanded upon Couder’s work and studied the system in greater detail.

=== Stationary bouncing droplet ===
A fluid droplet can float or bounce over a vibrating fluid bath because of the presence of an air layer between the droplet and the bath surface. The behavior of the droplet depends on the acceleration of the bath surface. Below a critical acceleration, the droplet will take successively smaller bounces before the intervening air layer eventually drains from underneath, causing the droplet to coalesce. Above the bouncing threshold, the intervening air layer replenishes during each bounce so the droplet never touches the bath surface. Near the bath surface, the droplet experiences equilibrium between inertial forces, gravity, and a reaction force due to the interaction with the air layer above the bath surface. This reaction force serves to launch the droplet back above the air like a trampoline. Molacek and Bush proposed two different models for the reaction force. The first models the reaction force as a linear spring, leading to the following equation of motion:

This model was found to more accurately conform to the experimental data.

=== Walking droplet ===
For a small range of frequencies and drop sizes, a fluid droplet on a vibrating bath can be made to “walk” on the surface if the surface acceleration is sufficiently high (but still below the Faraday instability). That is, the droplet does not simply bounce in a stationary position but instead wanders in a straight line or in a chaotic trajectory. When a droplet interacts with the surface it creates a transient wave that propagates from the point of impact. These waves usually decay and stabilizing forces keep the droplet from drifting. However, when the surface acceleration is high, the transient waves created upon impact do not decay as quickly, deforming the surface such that the stabilizing forces are not enough to keep the droplet stationary. Thus, the droplet begins to “walk.” A detailed account of the forces involved in the dynamics of walking droplets is found in [ref].

== Quantum phenomena on a macroscopic scale ==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}

A walking droplet on a vibrating fluid bath was found to behave analogously to several different quantum mechanical systems, namely particle diffraction, quantum tunneling, quantized orbits, the Zeeman effect, and the quantum corral.

=== Single and double slit diffraction ===
It has been known since the early 19th century that when light is shone through one or two small slits, a diffraction pattern is shown on a screen far from the slits. Light behaves as a wave and interferes with itself through the slits, creating a pattern of alternating high and low intensity. Single electrons also exhibit wave-like behavior as a result of wave-particle duality. When electrons are fired through small slits, the probability of the electron striking the screen at a specific point shows an interference pattern as well.

In 2006, Couder and Fort demonstrated that walking droplets passing through one or two slits exhibit similar interference behavior.&lt;ref name="Couder_diff"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fort |first=E. |last2=Couder |first2=Y. |date=October 2006 |title=Single-Particle Diffraction and Interference at a Macroscopic Scale |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=97 |issue=15 |pages=154101 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.97.154101|bibcode = 2006PhRvL..97o4101C |pmid=17155330}}&lt;/ref&gt; They used a square shaped vibrating fluid bath with a constant depth (aside from the walls). The “walls” were regions of much lower depth, where the droplets would be stopped or reflected away. When the droplets were placed in the same initial location, they would pass through the slits and be scattered, seemingly randomly. However, by plotting a histogram of the droplets based on scattering angle, the researchers found that the scattering angle was not random, but droplets had preferred directions that followed the same pattern as light or electrons. In this way, the droplet may mimic the behavior of a quantum particle as it passes through the slit.

=== Quantum tunneling ===
Quantum tunneling is the quantum mechanical phenomenon where a quantum particle passes through a potential barrier. In classical mechanics, a classical particle could not pass through a potential barrier if the particle does not have enough energy, so the tunneling effect is confined to the quantum realm. For example, a rolling ball would not reach the top of a steep hill without adequate energy. However, a quantum particle, acting as a wave, can undergo both reflection and transmission at a potential barrier. This can be shown as a solution to the time dependent Schrödinger Equation. There is a finite, but usually small, probability to find the electron at a location past the barrier. This probability decreases exponentially with increasing barrier width.

The macroscopic analogy using fluid droplets was first demonstrated in 2009. Researchers set up a square vibrating bath surrounded by walls on its perimeter. These “walls” were regions of lower depth, where a walking droplet may be reflected away. When the walking droplets were allowed to move around in the domain, they usually were reflected away from the barriers. However, surprisingly, sometimes the walking droplet would bounce past the barrier, similar to a quantum particle undergoing tunneling. In fact, the crossing probability was also found to decrease exponentially with increasing width of the barrier, exactly analogous to a quantum tunneling particle.&lt;ref name="Couder_nature"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Couder|date=September 2005 |title=Dynamical phenomena: Walking and orbiting droplets |journal=Nature |volume=437 |pages=208 |doi=10.1038/437208a|bibcode = 2005Natur.437..208C |display-authors=etal |pmid=16148925}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quantized orbits ===
When two atomic particles interact and form a bound state, such the hydrogen atom, the energy spectrum is discrete. That is, the energy levels of the bound state are not continuous and only exist in discrete quantities, forming “quantized orbits.” In the case of a hydrogen atom, the quantized orbits are characterized by atomic orbitals, whose shapes are functions of discrete quantum numbers.

On the macroscopic level, two walking fluid droplets can interact on a vibrating surface. It was found that the droplets would orbit each other in a stable configuration with a fixed distance apart. The stable distances came in discrete values. The stable orbiting droplets analogously represent a bound state in the quantum mechanical system. The discrete values of the distance between droplets are analogous to discrete energy levels as well.&lt;ref name="Couder_tunnel"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eddi|date=June 2009 |title=Unpredictable Tunneling of a Classical Wave-Particle Association |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=102 |issue=24 |pages=240401 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.102.240401|bibcode = 2009PhRvL.102x0401E |display-authors=etal |pmid=19658983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Zeeman effect ===
When an external magnetic field is applied to a hydrogen atom, for example, the energy levels are shifted to values slightly above or below the original level. The direction of shift depends on the sign of the z-component of the total angular momentum. This phenomenon is known as the Zeeman Effect.

In the context of walking droplets, an analogous Zeeman Effect can be demonstrated by observing orbiting droplets in a vibrating fluid bath.&lt;ref name="Couder_zeeman"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eddi|date=June 2012 |title=Level Splitting at Macroscopic Scale |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=108 |issue=26 |pages=264503 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.108.264503|bibcode = 2012PhRvL.108z4503E |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bath is also brought to rotate at a constant angular velocity. In the rotating bath, the equilibrium distance between droplets shifts slightly farther or closer. The direction of shift depends on whether the orbiting drops rotate in the same direction as the bath or in opposite directions. The analogy to the quantum effect is clear. The bath rotation is analogous to an externally applied magnetic field, and the distance between droplets is analogous to energy levels. The distance shifts under an applied bath rotation, just as the energy levels shift under an applied magnetic field.

=== Quantum corral ===
Researchers have found that a walking droplet placed in a circular bath does not wander randomly, but rather there are specific locations the droplet is more likely to be found. Specifically, the probability of finding the walking droplet as a function of the distance from the center is non-uniform and there are several peaks of higher probability. This probability distribution mimics that of an electron confined to a quantum corral.&lt;ref name="Bush_corral"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harris|date=July 2013 |title=Wavelike statistics from pilot-wave dynamics in a circular corral |journal=Physical Review E |volume=88 |issue=1 |pages=011001 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.88.011001|bibcode = 2013PhRvE..88a1001H |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Board of Education, 05311955.gif|thumb|right|220px|The first page of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] judgement in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', the "mother of all impact litigation".{{sfn | Schuck | 2006 | p=104}}]]
'''Impact litigation''' or '''strategic litigation''' is the practice of bringing [[lawsuit]]s intended to effect societal change.{{sfn | Schuck | 2006 | p=103}}{{sfn | Okafor | 2006 | p=81}} Impact litigation cases may be [[class action]] lawsuits or individual claims with broader significance,{{sfn | Schuck | 2006 | p=104}} and may rely on [[statutory law]] arguments or on [[constitution]]al claims.{{sfn | Tushnet | 2008 | p=383}} Such litigation has been widely and successfully used to influence public policy, especially by [[Left-wing politics|left-leaning]] groups, and often attracts significant media attention.{{sfn | Schuck | 2006 | p=103}}

==History==
In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] and [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (at times though its [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund|Legal Defense Fund]]) both pursued legal action to advance and protect civil rights in the [[United States of America|United States]]. The ACLU followed a primarily "defensive" strategy, fighting individual violations of rights when they were identified. The NAACP, in contrast, developed a more coordinated plan to actively file suits to challenge discrimination, known as "affirmative" or "strategic" litigation.{{sfn |Tushnet |2008 |p=380}} The NAACP's model became the pattern for "impact litigation" strategies, which applied similar tactics in contexts other than racial discrimination.{{sfn|Tushnet |2008 |p=383}}

Important early impact litigation cases included ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' and ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''.{{sfn | Schuck | 2006 | p=104}} ''Brown'', a 1954 U.S. [[school desegregation]] decision, was carefully prepared by [[Thurgood Marshall]] and other NAACP lawyers so that the eventual [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruling invalidated official racial discrimination throughout the U.S. government. Many cases since then have closely imitated it, in the course of seeking greater protections for other disadvantaged groups.{{sfn | Schuck | 2006 | p=104}}

==Scope==
Impact litigation has played a major role in the development of American desegregation, [[abortion]],  [[Regulation of tobacco by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration |tobacco regulation]] policy{{sfn | Mason | Leavitt | Chaffee | 2013 | p=547}} and [[gay marriage]].  

Since the 1980s, impact litigation has been used to seek reform in the reform of U.S. [[Child protection|child welfare law]], following earlier work which involved the courts in jail and mental hospital reforms and in school desegregation.{{sfn| Lowry |1986 |p=260}}

Strategic impact litigation has also been used in [[Nigeria]], among other things to push for convictions of perpetrators of [[police brutality]] and to defeat legal attacks on the [[freedom of the press]].{{sfn | Okafor | 2006 | p=81}}

In a few jurisdictions where attorneys are prohibited from bringing class action lawsuits, citizens have filed "grassroots impact litigation" cases and successfully represented their own claims.{{sfn |Freeman |1991 }}

==Debate==
Impact litigation has been criticized by legal scholars and politicians on the bases of judicial legitimacy and competence.

The legitimacy argument holds that, in countries with a constitutional [[separation of powers]], societal changes are to be enacted by democratically elected bodies and are outside the purview of individual judges. The competence argument claims that institutional limitations on the amount and quality of information that can be made available in a court proceeding make the courts poorly prepared to handle complex policy issues. Another version of this argument points out that courts are limited in the scope of their responses, relative to legislative bodies.{{sfn | Schuck | 2006 | pp=107-111}} These debates overlap with those concerning so-called "[[judicial activism]]".{{sfn| Lowry |1986 |p=260}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8781">'''Just another Perl hacker''', or '''JAPH''', typically refers to a [[Perl]] program which prints "Just another Perl hacker," (the comma is [[canon (basic principle)|canon]]ical but is occasionally omitted).  Short JAPH programs are often used as [[signature block|signatures]] in online [[Internet forum|forums]], or as [[T-shirt]] designs.  The phrase or acronym is also occasionally used (without [[Computer programming|code]]) for a signature.

JAPH programs are classically done using extremely [[obfuscated code|obfuscated]] methods, in the spirit of the [[International Obfuscated C Code Contest|Obfuscated C Contest]].  More recently, as the phenomenon has become so well known, the phrase is sometimes used in ordinary examples (without obfuscation).

The idea of using tiny Perl programs which print a signature ''as a signature'' was originated by [[Randal L. Schwartz]], in his postings to the [[newsgroup]] comp.lang.perl.&lt;ref&gt;Randal L. Schwartz in [[Usenet]] message M1HFPVH2JQ.FSF@HALFDOME.HOLDIT.COM explaining the origin of JAPH. Available through  [http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.perl.misc/msg/ecc405feeefc120c Google.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the JAPHs below are his.

==Examples==

JAPH program without obfuscation:

&lt;source lang="perl"&gt;
print "Just another Perl hacker,";
&lt;/source&gt;

Embedding JAPH in opaque code:

&lt;source lang="perl"&gt;
$_='987;s/^(\d+)/$1-1/e;$1?eval:print"Just another Perl hacker,"';eval;
&lt;/source&gt;

Decoding JAPH from a transposed [[string literal]]:

&lt;source lang="perl"&gt;
$_="krJhruaesrltre c a cnP,ohet";$_.=$1,print$2while s/(..)(.)//;
&lt;/source&gt;

Printing out JAPH as separate processes:
&lt;source lang="perl"&gt;
for $i (0..4) { if (!fork) {
      $i == 0 or not { $SIG{INT} = sub { print "J" } } or
      $i == 1 or not { $SIG{INT} = sub { print "A" } } or
      $i == 2 or not { $SIG{INT} = sub { print "P" } } or
      $i == 3 or not { $SIG{INT} = sub { print "H" } } ;
      sleep $i; last; } } kill INT =&gt; $$;
&lt;/source&gt;

Appearing as if it does something completely unrelated to printing JAPH:

&lt;source lang="perl"&gt;
$_ = "wftedskaebjgdpjgidbsmnjgc";
tr/a-z/oh, turtleneck Phrase Jar!/; print;
&lt;/source&gt;

Forking processes to print out one letter each in the correct order:&lt;ref&gt;[http://perl.plover.com/obfuscated/ Plover.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;source lang="perl"&gt;
@P=split//,".URRUU\c8R";@d=split//,"\nrekcah xinU / lreP rehtona tsuJ";sub p{
@p{"r$p","u$p"}=(P,P);pipe"r$p","u$p";++$p;($q*=2)+=$f=!fork;map{$P=$P[$f^ord
($p{$_})&amp;6];$p{$_}=/ ^$P/ix?$P:close$_}keys%p}p;p;p;p;p;map{$p{$_}=~/^[P.]/&amp;&amp;
close$_}%p;wait until$?;map{/^r/&amp;&amp;&lt;$_&gt;}%p;$_=$d[$q];sleep rand(2)if/\S/;print
&lt;/source&gt;

Using only Perl [[Keyword (computer programming)|keywords]] (no [[punctuation]]):&lt;ref&gt;Originally posted at [http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=290607 perlmonks.org] by user blokhead&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang="perl6"&gt;
not exp log srand xor s qq qx xor
s x x length uc ord and print chr
ord for qw q join use sub tied qx
xor eval xor print qq q q xor int
eval lc q m cos and print chr ord
for qw y abs ne open tied hex exp
ref y m xor scalar srand print qq

each return local x y or print qq
s s and eval q s undef or oct xor
time xor ref print chr int ord lc
foreach qw y hex alarm chdir kill
exec return y s gt sin sort split
&lt;/source&gt;

Using only [[punctuation]], no [[alphanumeric]] characters (written by [https://metacpan.org/author/ROODE Eric Roode]; only works on [[Unix]] and [[Unix-like]] systems):

&lt;source lang="perl"&gt;
`$=`;$_=\%!;($_)=/(.)/;$==++$|;($.,$/,$,,$\,$",$;,$^,$#,$~,$*,$:,@%)=(
$!=~/(.)(.).(.)(.)(.)(.)..(.)(.)(.)..(.)......(.)/,$"),$=++;$.++;$.++;
$_++;$_++;($_,$\,$,)=($~.$"."$;$/$%[$?]$_$\$,$:$%[$?]",$"&amp;$~,$#,);$,++
;$,++;$^|=$";`$_$\$,$/$:$;$~$*$%[$?]$.$~$*${#}$%[$?]$;$\$"$^$~$*.&gt;&amp;$=` 
&lt;/source&gt;

A much shorter one, using only punctuation, based on the [https://metacpan.org/module/Acme::EyeDrops EyeDrops] module:
&lt;source lang="perl"&gt;
''=~('(?{'.('-)@.)@_*([]@!@/)(@)@-@),@(@@+@)'
^'][)@]`}`]()`@.@]@%[`}%[@`@!#@%[').',"})')
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Laurence Michael Powell''' (born August 26, 1962 in [[Los Angeles, California]]) is a former [[Los Angeles Police Department]] officer. He was one of the five officers involved in the beating of [[Rodney King]] on March 3, 1991.

==Background==
Powell graduated from [[Crescenta Valley High School]]. He later enrolled in the police academy. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/la_riot/article/0,28804,1614117_1614084_1614517,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rodney King incident and trial==
On March 3, 1991, Powell and three other officers, Sgt. [[Stacey Koon]], Officer Theodore Briseno, and Officer Timothy Wind were videotaped repeatedly striking Rodney King with their police batons in [[Lake View Terrace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RODNEY KING BEATING VIDEO Full length footage SCREENER|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb1WywIpUtY|accessdate=28 June 2016|date=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Officer Powell was partnered with Officer Wind at the time.  

The Los Angeles District Attorney charged the four officers with assault with a deadly weapon and use of excessive force.  A year later, after a change of venue from Los Angeles to [[Ventura County, California|Ventura]] County, a jury of ten whites, one Asian and one Hispanic, acquitted the four officers of the assault charge, but [[Hung jury|deadlocked]] on the excessive force charge for Powell. The verdict led to the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]].

The four officers were later indicted on federal charges for violating Rodney King's civil rights. Powell and Koon were convicted in 1993 and were sentenced to 30 months in prison.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/1996-06-14/news/mn-14959_1_sentencing-guidelines&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1992 song "Guerillas in the Mist" by [[Da Lench Mob]] uses a sample of the phrase "gorillas in the mist" uttered by Powell. The LAPD officer had used the phrase to describe a black family in a domestic dispute that he responded to just before stopping King, named after the 1988 film ''[[Gorillas in the Mist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, Eithne.

A '''legacy hero''' is a type of character, usually a [[superhero]], that is the descendant or relative of an already or previously existing hero who either inherits or adopts the name and attributes of the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbr.com/generations-the-15-best-marvel-legacy-heroes/|title=Taking Up The Mantle: The 15 Best Marvel Legacy Heroes|date=30 March 2017|publisher=|accessdate=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.syfy.com/syfywire/future-star-wars-films-focus-new-characters-not-legacy-heroes|title=Future Star Wars films to focus on new characters, not legacy heroes|first=Trent|last=Moore|publisher=|accessdate=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest examples of this character type was comic strip hero [[The Phantom]], assumed to be immortal by his enemies—various members of a single family, the descendants of Christopher Walker.

The term is used most often to refer to characters published by [[DC Comics|DC]] and [[Marvel comics]]. Family franchises such as DC's [[Batman]], [[Superman]], [[Wonder Woman]], [[Atom (comics)|Atom]], [[Black Canary]], [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], [[The Flash]], [[Green Lantern]], [[Hawkman]], [[Hawkwoman]], [[The Ray]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] or Marvel's [[Black Knight (comics)|Black Knight]], [[List of incarnations of Captain America|Captain America]], [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]], [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], [[Iron Man]], [[List of incarnations of Spider-Man|Spider-Man]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], have seen several characters take up the name and abilities of the original.

In the video games series, ''[[Assassin's Creed (video game)|Assassin's Creed]],'' many of the game's characters are descended from bloodlines of Assassins.

==Legacy villain==
In opposition, there have been legacy villains in fiction as well. In comics, examples are DC's [[Blockbuster (DC Comics)|Blockbuster]], [[Captain Boomerang]], and [[Clayface]]; Marvel's [[Green Goblin]], [[Mysterio]], and [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]].

One of the best examples exists in Disney's ''[[Gargoyles (TV series)|Gargoyles]]'', as a multi-generational line of villains known as [[Hunter (Gargoyles)|the Hunter]], originates with the TV series' fictionalized depiction of the historic [[Gille Coemgáin of Moray]] as a boy. The young "Gillecomegain", as he is known within the series' storyline, is confronted by the evil female gargoyle [[Demona]] and slashed by her on his face,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people= |year=1995 |title=Gargoyles — City of Stone (Part 1) |trans-title=|medium=YouTube |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUbuDobX484 |accessdate=April 24, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUbuDobX484 |archivedate=October 22, 2012 |format=YouTube |time=10:10 to 10:22 |location= |publisher=Disney Shows |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the trio of slash wound scars on Gillecomegain's face, carried by him for the rest of his life as he seeks his revenge on the female gargoyle, becomes part of the ''Hunter'' disguise for succeeding examples of the Demona-hunting antagonists.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21914">'''Liberation psychology''' or '''liberation social psychology''' is an approach to psychology that aims to actively understand the psychology of oppressed and impoverished communities by conceptually and practically addressing the oppressive sociopolitical structure in which they exist.&lt;ref name = sloan /&gt; The central concepts of liberation psychology include: conscientization; realismo-crítico; de-ideologized reality; a coherently social orientation; the preferential option for the oppressed majorities, and methodological eclecticism.&lt;ref name = russell /&gt;&lt;ref name = burton /&gt;&lt;ref name = martin /&gt;

== History ==

=== Emergence ===
The core ideas of liberation psychology emerged in [[Latin America]] in the 1970s in response to criticisms of traditional psychology, [[social psychology]] specifically. Psychology was criticised for its 1) value neutrality; 2) assertion of universality; 3) societal irrelevance.

# View of science as neutral – The idea that science was devoid of moral elements was considered a flawed framework.
# Assertion of universality – Psychological theories were being produced based on research conducted primarily with white, middle class, undergraduate males. Liberationists questioned the notion that such principles were universal and therefore applicable to all individuals without regard to the consideration of contextual factors.
# Societal irrelevance – Psychology was viewed as failing to generate knowledge that could address social inequalities.

In response to these criticisms, psychologists sought to create a psychological science that addressed social inequalities both in theory and practical application. It is important to note that liberation psychology is not an area of psychology akin to clinical, developmental, or social psychology. However, it is more of a framework that aims to reconstruct psychology taking into account the perspective of the oppressed (Martín-Baró's "new interlocutor") so the discipline ceases its (often unwitting) complicity with the structures that perpetuate domination, oppression and inequality. Generally, people using this framework would not call themselves "liberation psychologists", although this term is sometimes used to refer to them.&lt;ref name = burton /&gt;

The term "liberation psychology" (or ''psicología de la liberación'') may have first appeared in print in 1976. It was later brought into widespread use by [[Ignacio Martín-Baró]]. A number of other Latin American social psychologists have also developed and promoted the approach, including Martiza Montero (Venezuela), Ignacio Dobles (Costa Rica), Bernardo Jiménez Dominguez (Colombia/Mexico), Jorge Mario Flores (Mexico), Edgar Barrero (Colombia) and Raquel Guzzo (Brazil) among others.&lt;ref name = burton /&gt;&lt;ref name = martin /&gt;

=== Founder ===
The genesis of liberation psychology began amongst a body of psychologists in [[Latin America]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref name = burton /&gt; [[Ignacio Martín-Baró]] is credited as the founder of liberation psychology, and it was further developed by others.&lt;ref name = martin /&gt;

Martín-Baró was a Spanish-born Jesuit priest and social psychologist who dedicated his work to addressing the needs of oppressed groups in Latin America, and ultimately was assassinated as a result of his work.&lt;ref name = martin /&gt;&lt;ref name = aalbers /&gt; His project of constructing a psychology relevant to the oppressed majorities of the American continent was therefore terminated prematurely. The collection of some of his articles in the collection ''Writings for a Liberation Psychology''&lt;ref&gt;Aron, A., &amp; Corne, S. (Eds.). (1996). Ignacio Martín-Baró: Writings for a Liberation Psychology. New York: Harvard University Press, Aron, A.&lt;/ref&gt; is a seminal text in the field that discusses the role of psychology as socially transformative.&lt;ref name = sloan /&gt;&lt;ref name = burton /&gt;&lt;ref name = martin /&gt; Most of his work still remains untranslated into English. His two major textbooks, ''Social Psychology from Central America'',&lt;ref&gt;Martín-Baró, I. (1983). Acción e Ideología: Psicología social desde Centroamérica I. San Salvador: UCA Editores.; Martín-Baró, I. (1989). Sistema, Grupo y Poder: Psicología social desde Centroamérica II. San Salvador: UCA Editores.&lt;/ref&gt; and his other books&lt;ref&gt;Martín-Baró, I. (1989). La opinión pública salvadoreña (1987-1988). San Salvador: UCA Editores; Martín-Baró, I. (2000). Psicología social de la guerra: trauma y terapia. San Salvador: UCA Editores.&lt;/ref&gt; are published by a small University publisher, UCA editores in El Salvador with the consequence that the breadth and depth of his work is not well known even in Latin America.

== Key concepts ==
The central concepts of liberation psychology include: ''concientización''; ''realismo-crítico''; de-ideologization; a social orientation; the preferential option for the oppressed majorities, and methodological eclecticism.&lt;ref name = russell /&gt;&lt;ref name = burton /&gt;&lt;ref name = martin /&gt;

=== ''Concientización'' ===
The intrinsic connectedness of the person's experience and the sociopolitical structure is a fundamental tenet of liberation psychology and is referred to as ''concientización'', a term introduced by the Brazilian educator [[Paulo Freire]], roughly translatable as the raising of politico-social consciousness. In this process people become more conscious of themselves and their lives as structured by the social reality of oppression, understood structurally, and they thereby become social actors. They change as they begin to act on their social circumstances. Understanding this interconnectedness is of particular importance to understanding the experiences and psychology of oppressed peoples, the power structure to which they are subjugated, and the ways in which this subjugation manifests in their behavior and psychopathology.&lt;ref name = burton /&gt;&lt;ref name = aalbers /&gt;

=== A social orientation ===
Liberation psychology criticises traditional psychology for explaining human behavior independently of the sociopolitical, historical, and cultural context.&lt;ref name = sloan /&gt;&lt;ref name = russell /&gt;&lt;ref name = martin /&gt; Martín-Baró argued that a failure of mainstream psychology is the attribution to the individual of characteristics that are found in the societal relations of the group. He argued that individual characteristics are a result of social relations, and to view such individualistically de-emphasizes the role of social structures, incorrectly attributing sociopolitical problems to the individual.&lt;ref name = russell /&gt;&lt;ref name = martin /&gt; Liberation psychology addresses this by reorienting the focus from an individualistic to a social orientation. Using this framework, the behaviour of oppressed people is conceptualized not through intrapsychic processes, but as a result of the alienating environment. 

The social orientation has a particular emphasis on understanding the role of history in shaping current conditions, and the ways in which this history resulted in the oppression of particular communities. Within this orientation, critical examination of social power and its structures is crucial. This is necessary in order to understand political and social power as not being interpersonal, but part of a society's institutional organization.&lt;ref name = burton /&gt;

=== Preferential option for the oppressed majorities ===
The development of a psychology that is "from" oppressed people rather than "for" oppressed people is the aim of liberation psychologists. Traditional psychology is understood as Eurocentric and is critiqued for ignoring the unique experiences of oppressed individuals. Martín-Baró made a similar argument, critiquing Latin American psychologists for adopting Eurocentric psychological models that were not informed by the social, political, and cultural environment of the impoverished and oppressed, which was the majority of people in 1980s El Salvador.&lt;ref name = martin /&gt;&lt;ref name = aalbers /&gt;

Liberation psychology further criticizes traditional psychology for its ivory tower approach to understanding phenomena, following Martín-Baró's call for psychology to turn its attention from its own social and scientific status to the needs and struggles of the popular majority. Unlike traditional approaches, liberation psychology seeks to re-situate the psychologist as part of the emancipatory process for and with oppressed communities.

=== ''Realismo-crítico'' ===
Martín-Baró contended that theories should not define the problems to be explored, but that the problems generate their own theories.&lt;ref name = martin /&gt; This idea is termed ''realismo-crítico''. This is contrasted to the traditional approach of addressing problems based on preconceived theorization, ''idealismo-metodológico'' (methodological idealism). In ''realismo-crítico'', theorization plays a supportive, but not fundamental, role.&lt;ref name = martin /&gt; Martín-Baró's idea of ''realism-crítico'' should not be equated with the work of [[Roy Bhaskar]] on [[critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realism]]. Although the two ideas are conceptually similar in some ways, they have distinct meanings (hence the use of the term here in Spanish, rather than attempting a direct translation).&lt;ref name = burton /&gt;

=== De-ideologized reality ===
Martín-Baró emphasized the role of ideology in obscuring the social forces and relations that create and maintain oppression: a key task of psychologists then is to de-ideologize reality, helping people to understand for themselves the nature of social reality transparently rather than obscured by dominant ideology.&lt;ref name = burton /&gt;&lt;ref name = martin /&gt; Ideology, understood as the ideas that perpetuate the interests of hegemonic groups, maintains the unjust sociopolitical environment. Alternatively, a de-ideologized reality encourages members of marginalized populations to endorse ideologies that promote their own interests and not those of the hegemony.&lt;ref name = burton /&gt;&lt;ref name = martin /&gt;&lt;ref name = aalbers /&gt; Martín-Baró's analysis of supposed Latin American fatalism and the myth of the lazy Latino exemplified his approach as did his use of public opinion surveys to counter the distortion that the then government and military were presenting of the Salvadorian public's views on the war.

=== Methodological eclecticism ===
Research with a liberation psychology framework incorporates methodologies from diverse domains. Traditional methodologies, such as surveys and quantitative analyses, are combined with more novel techniques for psychology, such as qualitative analyses, photography, drama, and textual analysis.&lt;ref name = burton /&gt;

== Applications ==

===Community psychology===
{{Main|Community psychology}}
Ignacio Martín-Baró had opposed the introduction of community psychology to El Salvador, on the basis of the ameliorative (''asistencialista''') approach and limited social perspective of then dominant North American models. Nevertheless, community psychology, and especially the Latin American variants (typically termed community ''social'' psychology) is one of the areas most influenced by the concepts of liberation psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Burton, M., &amp; Kagan, C. (2005). Liberation Social Psychology: Learning From Latin America. Journal of Community and Applied Social Psychology, 15(1), 63–78.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, community social psychology in Latin America, which predates liberation psychology,{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} also shares roots in the wider movement of Latin American critical and liberatory praxis (especially [[dependency theory]], [[philosophy of liberation]], [[liberation theology]], [[Critical pedagogy|critical or popular pedagogy]])&lt;ref&gt;Montero, M., Sonn, C., &amp; Burton, M. (2016). Community Psychology and Liberation Psychology: Creative Synergy for Ethical and Transformative Praxis. In M. A. Bond, I. García de Serrano, &amp; C. Keys (Eds.), APA handbook of community psychology (First Edition, Vol. 1). Washington, D.C: American Psychological Association.
&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Psychotherapeutic applications ===
{{See also|Psychotherapy}}
Liberation psychology departs from traditional psychological prioritization of the individual and the attribution of an individual's distress to pathology within the individual. Liberation psychology seeks to understand the person within their sociopolitical, cultural, and historical context. Therefore, distress is understood not solely in intrapsychic terms but in the context of an oppressive environment that psychologises and individualises distress.
In a psychotherapeutic context, this removes the onus of psychological distress solely from the individual and their immediate circumstances, and reframes the origin of distress as the environment and social structure to which persons are subjugated. Furthermore, this helps people to understand their relationship to the power structure, and the ways in which they participate in it.&lt;ref name = russell /&gt;&lt;ref name = martin /&gt;&lt;ref name="Afuape, T. 2011"&gt;Afuape, T. (2011). Power, resistance and liberation in therapy with survivors of trauma. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moane, G. (2011). Gender and colonialism: a psychological analysis of oppression and liberation. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; In liberatory approaches to mental distress the therapy is only a step towards the 're-insertion' of a person into their social milieu, social action and their existential life-project.&lt;ref&gt;Lira, E., &amp; Weinstein, E. (2000). La tortura. Conceptualización psicológica y proceso terapéutico. In I. Martín-Baró (Ed.), Psicología social de la guerra. San Salvador: UCA Editores.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Moving liberation psychology forward ==
Since the late 1990s, international congresses on liberation psychology have been held, primarily at Latin American universities. These congresses have been attended by hundreds of professionals and students, and have been crucial in perpetuating the social justice message of liberation psychology.

Specific congress themes include human rights, social justice, democratization, and creating models for liberation psychology in psychological practice and pedagogy.&lt;ref name = sloan /&gt; In recent years, these meetings have become increasingly focused on addressing issues related to poverty and economic inequality.

International congresses on liberation psychology include:

Liberation psychology is not limited to Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Burton, ¿Existe la psicología de la liberación fuera de América latina? https://www.academia.edu/2122428/_Existe_la_psicologia_de_la_liberacion_fuera_de_America_latina&lt;/ref&gt; The term was used by Philippine psychologist Virgilio Enríquez, apparently independently of Martín-Baró.&lt;ref&gt;Enriquez, V. (1994). From colonial to liberation psychology: the Philippine Experience. Manila: De La Salle University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere there have been explicit attempts to apply the approach to practice in other regions.&lt;ref&gt;Montero, M., &amp; Sonn, C. (2009). The Psychology of Liberation. Theory and Application. New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 an English language liberation psychology network was established by the British psychologist Mark Burton.&lt;ref&gt;http://libpsy.org&lt;/ref&gt; It has an international membership which reflects interest in liberation psychology from psychologists who do not read Spanish or Portuguese.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Moreover, not all liberatory praxis in psychology goes under the name "liberation psychology".

== Examples ==
More examples needed.
=== Black psychology ===

{{Main|Black psychology}}
Some scholars{{who|date=May 2018}} argue that the liberation psychology framework is central to [[black psychology]]. The interconnectedness of the personal and political, a fundamental tenet of liberation psychology, is central to black psychology. Furthermore, black psychology is thought of as inherently liberationist as it argues that addressing the psychology of black persons necessitates understanding, and addressing, the history and sociopolitical power structure that has resulted in the global oppression of individuals of African descent.&lt;ref name = azibo /&gt; 

Proponents of black psychology operate within the social orientation of liberation psychology, contending that Eurocentric ideologies of traditional psychology lack relevance when dealing with black communities. Therefore, an Afrocentric conceptualization that recognizes the unique history of individuals of African-descent is necessary when dealing with such communities. Using a liberation psychology framework, black psychology argues that simply recognizing the distinctiveness of the black experience is inadequate if the psychological theorization used does not come from the communities to which they are applied.&lt;ref name="Afuape, T. 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name = azibo /&gt; Such a position is consistent with Martín-Baró's assertion that the use of Eurocentric psychological methods is incongruent with the lived experiences of oppressed communities.&lt;ref name = martin /&gt;

=== Liberation psychology and LGBT psychotherapy ===
{{Main|LGBTQ psychology}}
Recent work in North America has sought to understand the applied use of liberation psychology in psychotherapy with [[LGBT]] individuals. Unlike traditional psychotherapeutic interventions, this approach reframes LGBT individuals' psychological issues as resulting from an understandable incorporation of the [[Homonegativity|homonegative]] attitudes characteristic of the social structures within which gay and transgender people live.

Traditional psychotherapy typically recognises the effect of homophobia and its impact on LGBT people, but often fails to clear the person of the blame for embracing such views. However, a liberationist psychological approach aims to facilitate the freeing the individual of the blame for adopting the homonegative views of the society. Instead, the onus is on the social environment, understanding that persons are themselves constituted as persons in their social context. Such an approach understands 'psychological' issues as inextricably linked to the societal context.

This may free the LGBT person from feeling flawed for harboring homonegative ideas. They are then able to examine how they are a participant in the social environment and the ways in which they can take responsibility for future actions. Additionally, using the concept of ''concientización'', people can examine how changing themselves can challenge the oppressive nature of the larger sociopolitical system,&lt;ref name = russell /&gt; although in most liberation psychology there is a more dialectical relationship between personal and social change where personal change does not have to precede social liberation.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

{{Tibetan Buddhism}}
'''Mahāmudrā''' ([[Sanskrit]], [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]]: ''Chagchen'', [[Wylie transliteration|Wylie]]: ''phyag chen'', contraction of ''Chagya Chenpo'', Wylie: ''phyag rgya chen po'') literally means "great seal" or "great imprint" and refers to the fact that "all phenomena inevitably are stamped by the fact of wisdom and emptiness inseparable".&lt;ref&gt;Duff, Tony, Gampopa's Mahamudra, p. vii, ix&lt;/ref&gt; 

Mahāmudrā is a multivalent term of great importance in later [[Indian Buddhism]] and [[Tibetan Buddhism]] which "also occurs occasionally in Hindu and [[Tangmi|East Asian Buddhist esotericism]]."&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Jackson |first=Roger R. |author-link=Roger R. Jackson |editor-last=|editor-first= |title=Mahāmudrā |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Religion | edition = 2|url= |date=2005 |publisher=|volume= |location= |oclc= |pages=5596 |isbn=0-02-865733-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name also refers to  a body of teachings representing the culmination of all the practices of the [[Sarma (Tibetan Buddhism)|Sarma]] schools of Tibetan Buddhism, who believe it to be the quintessential message of all of their sacred texts. The ''mudra'' portion denotes that in an adept's experience of reality, each phenomenon appears vividly, and the ''maha'' portion refers to the fact that it is beyond concept, imagination, and projection.&lt;ref name="Ray"&gt;[[Reginald Ray]], ''Secret of the Vajra World''. Shambhala 2001, page 261.&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of Mahāmudrā is also known as the teaching called “[[Sahaja|Sahajayoga]]” or “Co-emergence Yoga”.&lt;ref&gt;Duff, Tony, Gampopa's Mahamudra, p. x&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Tibetan Buddhism]], particularly the [[Kagyu]] school, this is sometimes seen as a different Buddhist vehicle ([[Yana (Buddhism)|yana]]), the "Sahajayana" (Tibetan: ''lhen chig kye pa''), also known as the vehicle of self-liberation. &lt;ref&gt;Traleg Kyabgon Rinpoche, Mind at Ease: Self-liberation Through Mahamudra Meditation, pp 7-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and semantic field==
[[File:Sharaha British Museum.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A scroll painting of Saraha, surrounded by other Mahāsiddhas, probably 18th century and now in the British Museum]]

The usage and meaning of the term ''mahāmudrā'' evolved over the course of hundreds of years of [[India]]n and [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] history, and as a result, the term may refer variously to "[[mudra|a ritual hand-gesture]], one of a sequence of 'seals' in [[tantra|Tantric]] practice, the nature of reality as [[Shunyata|emptiness]], a [[meditation]] procedure focusing on the nature of Mind, an innate blissful [[gnosis]] cognizing emptiness [[Nondualism#Nondual religious and spiritual traditions and teachings|nondually]], or the supreme attainment of [[buddhahood]] at the culmination of the Tantric path."&lt;ref name="Jackson" /&gt;

According to [[Jamgon Kongtrul]], the Indian theoretical sources of the mahāmudrā tradition are [[Yogacara]] [[Tathagatagarbha]] (Buddha-nature) texts such as the [[Samdhinirmocana sutra]] and the [[Uttaratantra]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Daniel P.;Pointing Out the Great Way: The Stages of Meditation in the Mahamudra Tradition, 2006, p 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The actual practice and lineage of mahāmudrā can be traced back to wandering [[mahasiddhas]] or great adepts during the Indian [[Pala Dynasty]] (760-1142), beginning with the 8th century siddha [[Saraha]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Daniel P.;Pointing Out the Great Way: The Stages of Meditation in the Mahamudra Tradition, 2006, p 16.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Saraha|Saraha's]] ''Dohas'' (songs or poems in rhyming couplets) are the earliest mahamudra literature extant, and promote some of the unique features of mahamudra such as the importance of [[Pointing-out instruction]] by a [[guru]], the non-dual nature of mind, and the negation of conventional means of achieving enlightenment such as samatha-vipasyana meditation, monasticism, rituals, tantric practices and doctrinal study in favor of mahamudra 'non-meditation' and 'non-action'.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Daniel P.;Pointing Out the Great Way: The Stages of Meditation in the Mahamudra Tradition, 2006, p 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Later Indian masters such as Padmavajra, [[Tilopa]], and [[Gampopa]] incorporated mahamudra into tantric, monastic and traditional meditative frameworks.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Daniel P.;Pointing Out the Great Way: The Stages of Meditation in the Mahamudra Tradition, 2006, p 18-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology in the tantras===
It has been speculated that the first use of the term was in the c. 7th century ''Mañjuśrīmūlakalpa'', in which it refers to a hand gesture.&lt;ref name="Jackson" /&gt; The term is mentioned with increasing frequency as Buddhist tantra developed further, particularly in the [[Yogatantra]]s, where it appears in ''Tattvasaṁgraha'' and the ''Vajraśekhara-tantra''. Here it also denotes a hand gesture, now linked to three other hand mudrās—the action (''karma''), pledge (''samaya''), and ''dharma'' mudrās—but also involves "mantra recitations and visualizations that symbolize and help to effect one’s complete identification with a deity’s divine form or awakening Mind (bodhicitta)."&lt;ref name="Jackson" /&gt; In [[Mahayoga|Mahāyoga]] tantras such as the [[Guhyasamāja tantra]], it "has multiple meanings, including a contemplation-recitation conducive to the adamantine body, speech, and Mind of the tathāgatas; and the object-—emptiness-—through realization of which 'all is accomplished,'" and it is also used as a synonym for awakened Mind, which is said to be "primordially unborn, empty, unarisen, nonexistent, devoid of self, naturally luminous, and immaculate like the sky."&lt;ref name="Jackson" /&gt;

In the Yoginī or [[Anuttarayoga Tantra]]s, mahāmudrā "emerges as a major Buddhist concept."&lt;ref name="Jackson" /&gt;&gt; As scholar Roger Jackson explains,
{{quote|Though still connected there to creation-stage maṇḍala practice, it is more often related to completion-stage meditations involving the manipulation of mental and physical forces in the subtle body so as to produce a divine form and a luminous, blissful, nonconceptual gnosis. In the completion-stage discussions in such Tantric systems as the Hevajra, Cakrasaṁvara, and Kālacakra, mahāmudrā has three especially important meanings. First, it may refer to a practitioner’s female consort in sexual yoga practices. Second, as before, it is one of a sequence of mudrās corresponding to various Buddhist concepts, experiences, and path-stages. Here, though, it usually is the culmination of the series, a direct realization of the nature of Mind and reality that transcends and perfects other, more conventional seals, including those involving actual or visualized sexual yoga. Third, Mahāmudrā by itself connotes the ultimate truth, realization, or achievement of yoginī Tantra practice: the great seal that marks all phenomena and experiences; a synonym for suchness, sameness, emptiness, space, and the goddess Nairātmyā (no-self); unchanging bliss beyond object and subject, shape, thought, or expression; and the ultimate gnostic attainment, ''mahāmudrā-siddhī''.&lt;ref name="Jackson" /&gt;}}

[[Thubten Yeshe]] explains: "Mahāmudrā means absolute seal, totality, unchangeability. Sealing something implies that you cannot destroy it. Mahāmudrā was not created or invented by anybody; therefore it cannot be destroyed. It is absolute reality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yeshe|first=Lama Thubten|title=Becoming the Compassion Buddha: Tantric Mahamudra for Everyday Life|publisher=Wisdom Publications|year=2003|page=21|isbn=0-86171-343-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aryadeva]] summarises: "The discussion of how to attain mahāmudrā entails methods for meditating on Mind itself as something having voidness as its nature".&lt;ref name="Gyatso"&gt;quoted in {{cite book|last=Gyatso|first=Tenzin |author2=Alexander Berzin|title=The Gelug/Kagyu Tradition of Mahamudra|publisher=Snow Lion Publications|location=New York|year=1997|page=119|isbn=1-55939-072-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Indian sources ==
[[File:Tilopa.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Tilopa]].]]
[[File:Maitripa.JPG|right|thumb|200px|[[Maitripa]].]]
All of the various Tibetan mahāmudrā lineages originated with the [[Mahasiddha]]s of the [[Pala Empire]] of 8-12th century India. The earliest figure is the tenth century poet yogi [[Saraha]], and his student Nagarjuna (not to be confused with the earlier philosopher).&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Peter Alan, Mahamudra and Related Instructions: Core Teachings of the Kagyu Schools (Library of Tibetan Classics) 2011, p. 9-10&lt;/ref&gt; Saraha's collections of poems and songs, mostly composed in the [[Middle Indo-Aryan languages#Apabhramsa|apabhramsa]] language are the earliest Indian sources for mahāmudrā teachings, aside from the [[Buddhist Tantras|Buddhist tantras]].   

Other influential Indian mahasiddhas include [[Tilopa]], his student [[Naropa]] and Naropa's consort [[Niguma]]. Tilopa's "Ganges Mahāmudrā" song is a widely taught short mahāmudrā text. Niguma is an important source for the [[Shangpa Kagyu]] lineage. 

Tilopa's pupil [[Maitripada|Maitripa]] became the principal master of mahāmudrā in India during his time and most lineages of mahāmudrā are traced from Maitripa.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Roberts, Peter Alan, Mahamudra and Related Instructions: Core Teachings of the Kagyu Schools (Library of Tibetan Classics) 2011, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Maitripa was a very influential figure of the eleventh century, a scholar and tantrika who widely taught the [[Ratnagotravibhāga|Ratnagotravibhaga]], a text which is widely seen as bridging the sutric Mahayana and [[Anuttarayoga Tantra|Anuttarayogatantra]] views.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Ulrich Timme Kragh, Tibetan yoga and mysticism : a textual study of the yogas of Nāropa and Mahāmudrā meditation in the medieval tradition of Dags po 2015, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; He composed commentaries on the buddhist dohas, and his works include a collection of 26 texts on "non-conceptual realization" (''amanasikara''), which are a key Indian source of mahāmudrā teachings that blend sutra and tantra and teach an instantaneous approach to awakening.&lt;ref&gt;Mathes, Klaus-Dieter, A Fine Blend of Mahamudra and Madhyamaka: Maitripa's Collection of Texts on Non-Conceptual Realization (Amanasikara), (Sitzungsberichte Der Philosophisch-Historischen Klasse), 2016, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Timme Kragh, Tibetan yoga and mysticism : a textual study of the yogas of Nāropa and Mahāmudrā meditation in the medieval tradition of Dags po 2015, p. 72-73&lt;/ref&gt;

Maitripa described mahāmudrā as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mahāmudrā, that which is unified and beyond the mind, is clear yet thoughtless, pervasive, and vast like space. Its aspect of great compassion is apparent yet devoid of any nature. Manifesting clearly like the moon in water; It is beyond all terms, boundaries or center. Polluted by nothing, it is stainless and beyond hope and fear. It cannot be described, like the dream of a mute."&lt;ref&gt;Drikung Kyabgon Chetsang; Khenpo Konchok Tamphel (translator), Water Crystal: A commentary on the Ganges Mahamudra.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;One of Maitripa's students was the [[Kadam (Tibetan Buddhism)|Kadam]] scholar [[Atiśa|Atisha]], who taught mahāmudrā to his pupil [[Dromtön|Dromton]] (1004-63) who decided not to make mahāmudrā a part of the Kadam tradition.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Another pupil of Maitripa, [[Marpa Lotsawa]], also introduced mahāmudrā to Tibet and his disciple [[Milarepa]] is also a central figure of this lineage. Another important figure in the introduction of mahāmudrā to the area is Vajrapani, yet another student of Maitripa.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Roberts, Peter Alan, Mahamudra and Related Instructions: Core Teachings of the Kagyu Schools (Library of Tibetan Classics) 2011, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; His student, Asu, also was a teacher of [[Rechung Dorje Drakpa|Rechungpa]] (1084-1161), one of Milarepa's pupils.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

[[Gampopa]], a key figure of the Kagyu school, refers to three important cycles of Indian texts which discuss Mahāmudrā as his main sources:&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Timme Kragh, Tibetan yoga and mysticism : a textual study of the yogas of Nāropa and Mahāmudrā meditation in the medieval tradition of Dags po 2015, p. 76-77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Mathes, Klaus-Dieter, A Fine Blend of Mahamudra and Madhyamaka: Maitripa's Collection of Texts on Non-Conceptual Realization (Amanasikara), (Sitzungsberichte Der Philosophisch-Historischen Klasse), 2016, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

* "The Seven [or eight] Siddhiḥ Texts" ''(Saptasiddhiḥ,'' [[Tibetic languages|Tib]]. ''Grub pa sde bdun),'' which include Padmavajra's ''Guhyasiddhi'' and Indrabhuti's ''Jñanasiddhi.''
* "The Cycle of Six Heart Texts" or "Six works on essential meaning" (''Snying po skor drug''), including Saraha's ''Dohakosha'' and Nagarjunagarbha's ''Caturmudraniscaya''.
* Maitripa's "Cycle of Teachings on Non-Cognition" (''Yid la mi byed pa 'i chos skor'').

This classification existed since the time of [[Buton Rinchen Drub|Bu ston Rin chen grub]] (1290-1364).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Indian sources of mahāmudrā were later compiled by the [[Karmapa|seventh Karmapa]] ''Chos grags rgya mtsho'' (1454- 1506) into a three-volume compilation entitled "The Indian Mahāmudrā Treatises" ([[Tibetic languages|Tib]]. ''Phyag rgya chen po 'i rgya gzhung''). This compilation includes the above three collections, along with the ''Anavilatantra'' and texts that teach a non-tantric "instantaneous"approach to the practice by an Indian master named Sakyasribhadra.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Timme Kragh, Tibetan yoga and mysticism : a textual study of the yogas of Nāropa and Mahāmudrā meditation in the medieval tradition of Dags po 2015, p. 65.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==Tibetan traditions==
[[File:Bhutanese painted thanka of Milarepa (1052-1135), Late 19th-early 20th Century, Dhodeydrag Gonpa, Thimphu, Bhutan.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Painted thanka of Milarepa (1052-1135), Late 19th-early 20th Century, Dhodeydrag Gonpa, Thimphu, Bhutan]]
Mahāmudrā is most well known as a teaching within the [[Kagyu]] school of Tibetan Buddhism. However the [[Gelug]] and [[Sakya]] schools also practice mahāmudrā. The [[Nyingma]] school and [[Bon]] practise [[Dzogchen]], a cognate but distinct method of direct introduction to the principle of [[śūnyatā]]. Nyingma students may also receive supplemental training in mahāmudrā, and the [[Palyul]] Nyingma lineage preserves a lineage of the "Union of Mahāmudrā and Ati Yoga" originated by [[Karma Chagme]].

===Kagyu tradition===
[[File:Gampopa portrait.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Gampopa]] (1079–1153), Kagyu founder]]

[[Gampopa]] Sönam Rinchen (1079-1153), a Kadam monk who was a student of the lay tantric yogi Milarepa, is a key figure in the Kagyu tradition. He is responsible for much of the development of Kagyu monastic institutions and for recording the teachings of the lineage in writing.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Duff, Tony, Gampopa's Mahamudra, p. v-vii.&lt;/ref&gt; He synthesized the Mahayana Kadam teachings with the tantric teachings he received from Milarepa and developed a unique system of mahāmudrā which he often taught without tantric [[Empowerment (Vajrayana)|empowerment]], relying instead on [[Guru Yoga|guru yoga]].&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Timme Kragh, Tibetan yoga and mysticism : a textual study of the yogas of Nāropa and Mahāmudrā meditation in the medieval tradition of Dags po 2015, p. 163-164.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Mahamudra is defined by [[Gampopa]] as "the realization of the natural state as awareness-emptiness, absolutely clear and transparent, without root". Gampopa also states that mahamudra is "the [[Prajnaparamita|paramita of wisdom]], beyond thought and expression."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Gampopa taught mahamudra in a five part system to his disciples, one of his most well known disciples, [[Phagmo Drupa Dorje Gyalpo|Phagmo Drupa]] (1110-1170) became a very successful teacher who continued to teach this five part system and eight "junior" kagyu lineages are traced to him.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This “Five-Part Mahāmudrā” system became one of the main ways that Mahāmudrā was transmitted in Kagyu lineages after Gampopa.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;   

The tradition which follows Gampopa is called [[Dagpo Kagyu|Dakpo Kagyu]]. A key Mahāmudrā author of this tradition is [[Dagpo Tashi Namgyal|Dakpo Tashi Namgyal]], well known for his ''Mahāmudrā: The Moonlight.'' [[Karma Kagyu]] [[Karmapa|Karmapas]] like the ninth Karmapa [[Wangchuk Dorje, 9th Karmapa Lama|Wangchuk Dorje]] also composed important Mahāmudrā texts. A development of these later mahāmudrā writers is the integration of the common Mahayana teachings on [[samatha]] and [[Vipaśyanā|vipasyana]] as preliminaries to the practice of mahāmudrā.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Timme Kragh, Tibetan yoga and mysticism : a textual study of the yogas of Nāropa and Mahāmudrā meditation in the medieval tradition of Dags po 2015, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;  

====Three types of teaching====
The Kagyu lineage divides the mahāmudrā teachings into three types, "sutra mahāmudrā," "tantra mahāmudrā," and "essence mahāmudrā," in a formulation that appears to originate with [[Jamgon Kongtrul]].&lt;ref&gt;"Blending the Sūtras with the Tantras: The Influence of Maitrīpa and his Circle on the formation of Sūtra Mahāmudrā in the Kagyu Schools" by Klaus-Dieter Mathes in ''Tibetan Buddhist Literature and Praxis : Studies in its Formative Period, 900-1400, PIATS 2003: Tibetan Studies: Proceedings of the Tenth seminar of the International Association for Tibetan Studies''. Oxford: 2003 pg 201&lt;/ref&gt; Sutra mahāmudrā, as the name suggests, draws its philosophical view and meditation techniques from the sutrayana tradition. Tantric mahāmudrā employs such [[tantra techniques (Vajrayana)|tantric techniques]] as [[tummo]], [[dream yoga]], and [[ösel (yoga)|ösel]], three of the [[Six Yogas of Naropa]]. Essence mahāmudrā is based on the direct instruction of a qualified lama, known as [[pointing-out instruction]].

====Blending of sutra and tantra====
The particular Kagyu propensity to blend sutric and tantric traditions of mahāmudrā became a point of controversy in 13th century Tibet. The possibility of sudden liberating realization and the practicing of mahāmudrā without the need for [[Empowerment (Vajrayana)|tantric initiation or empowerment]] was seen as a result of this blending as well as a development stemming from Sino-Tibetan influences.&lt;ref&gt;Dakpo Tashi Namgyal, Bkra-śis-rnam-rgyal (Dwags-po Paṇ-chen) (2006), ''Mahamudra: The Moonlight - Quintessence of Mind and Meditation'', Wisdom Publications, p.104&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mathes2" /&gt;{{refn|This is a reference to [[Moheyan|Hwashang]] and the [[Council of Lhasa]], in which Indian Buddhism and its gradual approach was chosen over the sudden approach of [[Chan Buddhism]]. See Dakpo Tashi Namgyal, Bkra-śis-rnam-rgyal (Dwags-po Paṇ-chen) (2006), ''Mahamudra: The Moonlight - Quintessence of Mind and Meditation'', Wisdom Publications, p.104-105.|group=note}}

According to Klaus-Dieter Mathes, the Kagyu tradition sought to base their teachings in Indian works:
{{quote| Later Bka´ brgyud pas defended their not specifically Tantric or sūtra mahāmudrā tradition by adducing Indian sources such as the Tattvadaśakaṭīkā or the Tattvāvatāra. These belong to a genre of literature which the Seventh Karmapa Chos grags rgya mtsho (1454–1506) called “Indian mahāmudrā-Works” (phyag chen rgya gzhung).&lt;ref name="Mathes" /&gt;}}

Dr. Mathes investigated the practice described in these mahāmudrā works and found that it is not necessarily Tantric. In Saraha's dohās, it is simply the realization of Mind's co-emergent nature with the help of a genuine guru. [[Maitripada|Maitrīpa]] (ca. 1007– 085) uses the term mahāmudrā for precisely such an approach, thus employing an originally Tantric term for something that is not a specifically Tantric practice. 

It is thus legitimate for later Kagyupas to speak of Saraha's mahāmudrā tradition as being originally independent of the Sūtras and the Tantras. For Maitrīpa, the direct realization of emptiness (or the co-emergent) is the bridging link between the Sūtras and the Tantras, and it is thanks to this bridge that mahāmudrā can be linked to the Sūtras and the Tantras. In the Sūtras it takes the form of the practice of non-abiding and becoming mentally disengaged, while in the Tantras it occupies a special position among the four mudrās.&lt;ref name="Mathes"&gt;"Indian Mahāmudrā-Works” in the Early Bka’ brgyud pa."

==== Kagyu mahāmudrā lineages ====
[[Khedrup Gelek Pelzang, 1st Panchen Lama]] identified a number of mahāmudrā lineages, according to their main practices for achieving mahāmudrā. In his teachings on the First Panchen Lama's root text and auto-commentary the [[14th Dalai Lama]] delineated the Kagyu practice lineages as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gyatso|first=Tenzin |author2=Alexander Berzin|title=The Gelug/Kagyu Tradition of Mahamudra|publisher=Snow Lion Publications|location=New York|year=1997|pages=262–271|isbn=1-55939-072-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Karma Kagyu]] "Simultaneously Arising as Merged" tradition - This is the tradition introduced by [[Gampopa]] with a main practice of the [[Six Yogas of Naropa]].
* The [[Shangpa Kagyu]] "Amulet Box" tradition - This tradition came from [[Khyungpo Naljor]] and its main practice is the Six yogas of [[Niguma]].
* The [[Drikung Kagyu]] "Possessing Five" tradition - [[Jigten Sumgön|Jigten Gonpo]] founded the school and mahāmudrā lineage whose main practice is known as the "fivefold mahāmudrā" consisting of bodhicitta, [[yidam]] practice, [[Guru Yoga|guru yoga]], mahamudra and dedication.
* The [[Drukpa Lineage]] "Six Spheres of Equal Taste" tradition - [[Tsangpa Gyare]] founded this tradition which encompasses a range of practices, including the [[Six Yogas of Naropa]].
* The [[Dagpo Kagyu]] "Four Syllables" tradition - This is the tradition that derives from [[Maitripada|Maitripa]]. The four syllables are ''a-ma-na-si'' which make up the Sanskrit word meaning 'not to take to mind' and passed through the [[Dagpo Kagyu]] branches, i.e. any that descend from the teachings of [[Tilopa]] rather than those of [[Niguma]], which in practice means all but the [[Shangpa Kagyu]].

===Gelug tradition===

The Gelug school's mahamudra tradition is traditionally traced back to the school's founder [[Je Tsongkhapa|Tsongkhapa]] (1357- 1419), who was said to have received oral transmission from [[Manjushri]], and it is also traced to the Indian masters like Saraha through the [[Drikung]] Kagyu master Chennga Chokyi Gyalpo who transmitted Kagyu Mahamudra teachings (probably the five fold Mahamudra) to Tsongkhapa.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Roger, "The dGe ldan-bKa’ brgyud Tradition of Mahamudra How Much dGe ldan? How Much bKa’ brgyud?" in ''Newland, Guy, Changing Minds: Contributions to the Study of Buddhism and Tibet in Honor of Jeffrey Hopkins 2001 p. 155''.&lt;/ref&gt; Jagchen Jampa Pal (1310-1391), a prominent holder of the 'jag pa tradition of the Shangpa teachings, was also one of the teachers of rje Tsongkhapa.

However, a specifically "Gelug" Mahamudra system was only recorded at the time of [[Lobsang Chökyi Gyaltsen, 4th Panchen Lama]] (sometimes named the "1st Panchen Lama", 1570-1662), who wrote a root Mahamudra text on the "''Highway of the Conquerors: Root Verses for the Precious Geden [Gelug] Kagyu [Oral] Transmission of Mahāmudrā''" (''dGe-ldan bka'-brgyud rin-po-che'i phyag-chen rtsa-ba rgyal-ba'i gzhung-lam'') and its auto commentary (the ''Yang gsal sgron me, "Lamp re-illuminating Mahamudra"''), which is still widely taught and commented upon.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Jackson, Roger, "The dGe ldan-bKa’ brgyud Tradition of Mahamudra How Much dGe ldan? How Much bKa’ brgyud?" in ''Newland, Guy, Changing Minds: Contributions to the Study of Buddhism and Tibet in Honor of Jeffrey Hopkins 2001 p. 155''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://studybuddhism.com/en/tibetan-buddhism/original-texts/tantra-texts/root-text-for-mahamudra Berzin, A root text for Mahamudra]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thuken Losang Chokyi Nyima, The Crystal Mirror of Philosophical Systems, p 620.

&lt;/ref&gt; Before this work, Gelug writings on Mahamudra tended to follow orthodox Kagyu teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Roger, "The dGe ldan-bKa’ brgyud Tradition of Mahamudra How Much dGe ldan? How Much bKa’ brgyud?" in ''Newland, Guy, Changing Minds: Contributions to the Study of Buddhism and Tibet in Honor of Jeffrey Hopkins 2001 p. 155''.&lt;/ref&gt; This text and its auto commentary have become a central work on Mahamudra in the Gelug school. The current [[14th Dalai Lama]] and [[Lama Yeshe]] are some of the modern Gelug figures which have written commentaries on this key Gelug Mahamudra text.&lt;ref&gt;Lama Yeshe, Mahamudra: How to Discover Our True Nature&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dalai Lama &amp;nbsp;(Author), Alexander Berzin (Author), The Gelug/Kagyu Tradition of Mahamudra.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Panchen Lama [[Lobsang Chökyi Gyaltsen, 4th Panchen Lama|Chökyi Gyaltsen]], himself was influenced by Kagyu teachings, and wished to imitate great siddhas like [[Milarepa]] and Sabaripa.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Willis, Jan, Enlightened Beings: Life Stories from the Ganden Oral Tradition, p 20.&lt;/ref&gt; He names various Mahamudra and Dzogchen lineages in his text, and comes to the conclusion that "their definitive meanings are all seen to come to the same intended point."&lt;ref&gt;Gyumed Khensur Lobsang Jampa; The Easy Path: Illuminating the First Panchen Lama's Secret Instructions, Calm abiding.&lt;/ref&gt; Chökyi Gyaltsen also sides with the Kagyu school against Sakya, arguing that there is a sutra level of Mahamudra.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; However, in his account, sutra Mahamudra is particularly associated with a gradual path and his presentation of insight practice (''vipasyana'') is uniquely Gelug.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Yongdzin Yeshe Gyaltsen (also known as Khachen Yeshe Gyaltsen, tutor of the 8th Dalai Lama, 1713–93) composed a commentary on [[Lobsang Chökyi Gyaltsen, 4th Panchen Lama|Chökyi Gyaltsen]]'s Mahamudra text, entitled "The Lamp of the Clear and Excellent Path of the Oral Tradition Lineage" (''Yongs-'dzin ye shes rgyal mtshan'').&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, B. Alan, Balancing the Mind: A Tibetan Buddhist Approach To Refining Attention, 2005, p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt; He also comments on Mahamudra in the context of Lama Chopa Guru Yoga.&lt;ref&gt;Kachen Yeshe Gyaltsen, David Gonzales (translator), Manjushri's Innermost Secret: A Profound Commentary of Oral Instructions on the Practice of Lama Chopa&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sakya mahāmudrā===
Following the great [[Sakya]] exegete and philosopher [[Sakya Pandita|Sakya pandita]] (1182-1251), mahāmudrā in the Sakya school is seen as the highest [[Tantra|tantric]] realization, which means that mahāmudrā practice is only taken on after having been [[Empowerment (Vajrayana)|initiated into tantric practice]] and practicing the creation and completion stages of [[deity yoga]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studybuddhism.com/en/tibetan-buddhism/tantra/mahamudra-dzogchen/what-is-dzogchen|title=What Is Dzogchen?|last=Berzin|first=Alexander|date=1995, revised July 2006|publisher=Study Buddhism|accessdate=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Stenzel, Julia, The Mahåmudrå of Sakya Pandita, Indian International Journal of Buddhist Studies Volume 15 (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; In his "A Clear Differentiation of the Three Codes" (''Sdom gsum rab dbye''), Sakya Pandita criticized the non-tantric "sutra" mahamudra approaches of the Kagyu teachers such as [[Gampopa]] who taught mahāmudrā to those who had not received tantric initiations and based themselves on the [[Ratnagotravibhāga|Uttaratantrasastra]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He argued that the term mahāmudrā does not occur in the sutras, only in the highest class of tantras and that only through tantric initiation does mahāmudrā arise: "Our own Great Seal consists of Gnosis risen from initiation."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to Sakya Pandita, through the four empowerments or initiations given by a qualified guru, most practitioners will experience a likeness of true mahāmudrā, though a few rare individuals experience true mahāmudrā.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Through the practice of the creation and completion stages of tantra, the tantrika develops this partial understanding of bliss and emptiness into a completely non-dual gnosis, the real Mahamudra, which corresponds to the attainment of the Path of Seeing, the first Bodhisattva bhumi.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In Sakya, this insight known as mahāmudrā is described variously as "the unity of lucidity and emptiness, the unity of awareness and emptiness, the unity of bliss and emptiness" and also "the natural reality (''chos nyid gnyug ma'') which is emptiness possessing the excellence of all aspects."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Practices and methods ==
A common schema used in the Kagyu school is that of Ground ([[buddha-nature]], [[Śūnyatā|emptiness]]), Path (practice) and Fruition mahāmudrā ([[Buddhahood]]).&lt;ref&gt;Reginald Ray, ''Secret of the Vajra World''. Shambhala 2001, page 266.&lt;/ref&gt; The advice and guidance of a qualified [[guru|teacher]] is considered to be very important in developing faith and interest in the dharma as well as in learning and practicing mahāmudrā meditation. Most often mahāmudrā (particularly essence mahāmudrā) is preceded by meeting with a lama and receiving [[pointing-out instruction]]. Some parts of the transmission are done verbally and through [[Wang (Tibetan Buddhism)|empowerments]] and "reading transmissions." A student typically goes through various tantric practices before undertaking the "formless" practices described below; the latter are classified as part of "essence mahāmudrā."&lt;ref&gt;Reginald Ray, ''Secret of the Vajra World''. Shambhala 2001, pages 273-274.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ngondro]] are the preliminary practices common to both mahāmudrā and [[dzogchen]] traditions and include practices such as contemplating the "four thoughts that turn the mind", prostrations, and [[Guru Yoga|guru yoga]]. According to one scholar, most people have difficulty beginning directly with formless practices and lose enthusiasm doing so, so the tantric practices work as a complement to the formless ones.&lt;ref&gt;Reginald Ray, ''Secret of the Vajra World''. Shambhala 2001, pages 272-274.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way to divide the practice of mahāmudrā is between the tantric mahāmudrā practices and the sutra practices. Tantric mahāmudrā practices involves practicing [[deity yoga]] with a [[yidam]] as well as [[subtle body]] practices like the [[Six Yogas of Naropa|six yogas of Naropa]] and can only be done after [[Empowerment (Vajrayana)|empowerment]].&lt;ref&gt;Reginald Ray, ''Secret of the Vajra World''. Shambhala 2001, pages 271-272.&lt;/ref&gt; After the preliminary practices, the [[Kagyu]] school's sutra mahāmudrā practice is often divided into the ordinary or essential meditation practices and the extraordinary meditation practices. The ordinary practices are [[samatha]] (calming) and [[vipassana|vipasyana]] (special insight). The extraordinary practices include "formless" practices like 'one taste yoga' and 'non-meditation'. The tradition also culminates with certain special enlightenment and post-enlightenment practices.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Daniel P.;Pointing Out the Great Way: The Stages of Meditation in the Mahamudra Tradition, 2006, p 28-29.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Reginald Ray]], the "formless" practices, also called "Essence mahamudra," is when "one engages directly in practices of abandoning discursive thinking and resting the mind in the clear, luminous awareness that is mahamudra."&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Reginald Ray, ''Secret of the Vajra World''. Shambhala 2001, pages 272.&lt;/ref&gt; The reason that preparatory practices and "form" practices like deity yoga and [[Vipassanā|vipasyana]] are needed is because formless practices are quite difficult and subtle, and most practitioners are not able to enter into the simple essence of mind successfully without considerable mental preparation.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Four yogas and five paths===
In the [[Dagpo Kagyu]] tradition as presented by [[Dagpo Tashi Namgyal]], Mahāmudrā is divided into four distinct phases known as the four yogas of mahāmudrā (S. ''catvāri mahāmudrā yoga'', {{bo|w=phyag rgya chen po'i rnal 'byor bzhi}}). They are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;''Mahamudra: The Moonlight: Quintessence of Mind and Meditation'' by Dakpo Tashi Namgyal Wisdom Publications; 2nd ed: 2006 {{ISBN|9780861712991}} pg 463&lt;/ref&gt;

# one-pointedness (S. ''ekāgra'', T. ''rtse gcig'')
# simplicity (S. ''niṣprapāncha'', T. ''spros bral'') "free from complexity" or "not elaborate."
# one taste (S. ''samarasa'', T. ''ro gcig'')
# non-meditation (S. ''abhāvanā'', ''sgom med'') The state of not holding to either an object of meditation nor to a meditator. Nothing further needs to be 'meditated upon' or 'cultivated at this stage.{{refn|group=note|See also [[Shikan-taza]], [[Turiya]], [[Sahaja]], and [[choiceless awareness]].}}

These stages parallel the [[Semde#Four Yogas of Semde|four yogas of Dzogchen semde]]. The four yogas of mahāmudrā have been correlated with the Mahāyāna [[Bhūmi (Buddhism)|five paths]] (S. ''pañcamārga''), according to [[Tsele Natsok Rangdröl|Tsele Natsok Rangdrol]] (''Lamp of Mahāmudrā''):

*[[Ngöndro|Outer and inner preliminary practices]]: path of accumulation
*One-pointedness: path of application
*Simplicity: paths of seeing and most of the path of meditation (bhūmis one through six)
*One taste: last part of the path of meditation, most of the path of no-more-learning (bhūmis seven through nine)
*Nonmeditation: last part of the path of no-more learning (tenth bhūmi) and buddhahood (bhūmis eleven through thirteen)

[[Dagpo Tashi Namgyal|Dakpo Tashi Namgyal]] meanwhile in his ''Moonlight of Mahāmudrā'' correlates them as follows:

*Outer and inner preliminary practices and one-pointedness: path of accumulation
*Simplicity: path of application
*One taste: paths of meditation &amp; no-more-learning
*Nonmeditation: path of no more learning &amp; buddhahood

According to Je Gyare as reported by Dakpo Tashi Namgyal (''Moonlight of Mahāmudrā''):

*One-pointedness: paths of accumulation and application
*Simplicity: path of seeing (first bhūmi)
*One taste: paths of meditation and part of the path no-more-learning (bhūmis two through eight)
*Nonmeditation: rest of path of no-more-learning, buddhahood (bhūmis nine through thirteen)

According to Drelpa Dönsal as reported by Dakpo Tashi Namgyal (''Moonlight of Mahāmudrā''):

*One-pointedness: paths of accumulation and application
*Simplicity: path of seeing (first bhūmi)
*One taste: paths of meditation and no-more-learning (bhūmis two through ten)
*Nonmeditation: buddhahood (bhūmis eleven through thirteen)

===Ordinary meditation practices===
As in most Buddhist schools of meditation, the basic meditative practice of mahāmudrā is divided into two approaches: [[samatha|śamatha]] ("tranquility","calm abiding") and [[vipassana|vipaśyanā]] ("special insight"). This division is contained in the instructions given by [[Wangchuk Dorje, 9th Karmapa Lama|Wangchuk Dorje]], the ninth [[Karmapa]], in a series of texts he composed; these epitomize teachings given on mahāmudrā practice.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Reginald Ray, ''Secret of the Vajra World''. Shambhala 2001, page 274.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Śamatha====
[[File:Karmapa9.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Wangchuk Dorje]] (1556–1603), 9th [[Karmapa]], composed various influential texts on Mahamudra.]]
Often associated with the yoga of one-pointedness, mahāmudrā śamatha contains instructions on ways to sit with proper posture, called the seven point posture of Vairocana.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The mahāmudrā shamatha teachings also include instructions on how to work with a mind that is beset with various impediments to focusing,&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Reginald Ray, ''Secret of the Vajra World''. Shambhala 2001, pages 274-275.&lt;/ref&gt; such as raising the gaze when one feels dull or sleepy, and lowering it again when one feels overly excited. Two types of mahāmudrā śamatha are generally taught: śamatha with support and śamatha without support.

Mahāmudrā śamatha with support involves the use of an object of attention to which the meditator continually returns his or her attention. Wangchuk Dorje mentions that  one can use a wide variety of supports, visual objects like a candle flame, but also sounds, a smell, etc.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

One of the main techniques involved in Mahāmudrā śamatha with support is [[Anapanasati|mindfulness of breathing]] (S. ānāpānasmṛti). Mindfulness of breathing practice is considered to be a profound means of calming the mind to prepare it for the stages that follow. For the Kagyupa, in the context of mahāmudrā, mindfulness of breathing is thought to be the ideal way for the meditator to transition into taking the mind itself as the object of meditation and generating vipaśyanā on that basis.&lt;ref&gt;Pointing Out the Great Way: The Stages of Meditation in the Mahamudra tradition by Dan Brown. Wisdom Publications: 2006 pg 221-34&lt;/ref&gt; The prominent contemporary Kagyu/Nyingma master [[Chogyam Trungpa]], expressing the Kagyu Mahāmudrā view, wrote, "your breathing is the closest you can come to a picture of your mind. It is the portrait of your mind in some sense... The traditional recommendation in the lineage of meditators that developed in the Kagyu-Nyingma tradition is based on the idea of mixing mind and breath."&lt;ref&gt;''The Path is the Goal'', in ''The Collected Works of Chogyam Trungpa, Vol Two''. Shambhala Publications. pgs 49, 51&lt;/ref&gt; 

Shamatha without support or objectless meditation refers to resting the mind without the use of a specific focal point or object of concentration. According to Reginald Ray, in this practice "the eyes are open and one gazes straight ahead into space, directing one's mind to nothing at all."&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; 

In Gelug sutra mahāmudrā, the samatha techniques are similar to the Kagyu presentation.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

====Vipaśyanā====
The detailed instructions for the insight practices are what make mahāmudrā (and [[Dzogchen]]) unique in Tibetan Buddhism. In Mahāmudrā vipaśyanā, Wangchuck Dorje gives ten separate contemplations that are used to disclose the essential mind within; five practices of "looking at" and five of "[[pointing-out instruction|pointing out]]" the nature of mind. They all presume some level of stillness cultivated by mahāmudrā shamatha. In retreat, each contemplation would typically be assigned specific time periods.&lt;ref&gt;Reginald Ray, ''Secret of the Vajra World''. Shambhala 2001, page 276.&lt;/ref&gt;

The five practices for "looking at" the nature of the mind are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Reginald Ray, ''Secret of the Vajra World''. Shambhala 2001, pages 276-277.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Looking at the settled mind.'' One repeatedly looks at the mind's still state, possibly posing questions to arouse awareness, such as "what is its nature? It is perfectly still?"
* ''Looking at the moving or thinking mind.'' One tries to closely examine the arising, existence, and ceasing of thoughts, possibly posing oneself questions so as to better understand this process, such as "how does it arise? What is its nature?"
* ''Looking at the mind reflecting appearances.'' One looks at the way in which phenomena of the external senses occur in experience. Usually, a visual object is taken as the subject. One repeatedly looks at the object, trying to see just how that appearance arises in the mind, and understand the nature of this process. One possibly asks questions such as "what is their nature? How do they arise, dwell, and disappear? Is their initial appearance different from how they eventually understood?"
* ''Looking at the mind in relation to the body.'' One investigates questions such as "what is the mind? What is the body? Is the body our sensations? What is the relation of our sensations to our mental image of our body?"
* ''Looking at the settled and moving minds together.'' When the mind is still, one looks at that, and when the mind is in motion, one looks at that. One investigates whether these two stages are the same or different, asking questions such as "if they are the same, what is the commonality? If different, what is the difference?"

The practices for "pointing out the nature of mind" build on these. One now looks again at each of the five, but this time repeatedly asks oneself "What is it?" In these practices, one attempts to recognize and realize the exact nature of, respectively:
* The settled mind,
* The moving or thinking mind,
* The mind reflecting appearances,
* The relation of mind and body,
* The settled and thinking mind together.

The above practices do not have specific "answers"; they serve to provoke one to scrutinize experience more and more closely over time, seeking to understand what is really there.&lt;ref&gt;Reginald Ray, ''Secret of the Vajra World''. Shambhala 2001, page 277.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gelug sutra Mahāmudrā, as presented by [[Lobsang Chökyi Gyaltsen, 4th Panchen Lama|Chökyi Gyaltsen]], practices a unique Gelug style of doing [[vipaśyanā]], based primarily on Gelug [[Madhyamaka]]. According to Roger Jackson:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In an actual meditation session, this involves, first of all, analyzing whether the meditator who has achieved tranquil equipoise actually can be found in an ultimate sense. Seeking the meditator both within and apart from the various elements, one encounters the meditator nowhere; seeking ultimacy in phenomena (dharmas), one encounters it nowhere. Thus, one comes to abide in a space-like awareness of the void nature of both the person and dharmas. Next (or, alternatively) one examines more carefully whether the mind itself can be found in an ultimate sense: it is discovered to have the conventional nature of a flow of awareness and clarity, but no ultimacy, no true existence. In short, one should recognize that any existent that arises, whether an object of the mind or the mind itself, is merely conceptual, is void and—as Chos rgyan quotes his guru, Sangs rgyas ye shes, as saying—”When . . . you are equipoised one-pointedly on that, marvelous!” (GBZL: 4a; trans. Dalai Lama and Berzin: 100; YSGM: 30b). In the period between meditation sessions (rjes thob), one should see all appearances as deceptive (sgyu ma), as existing differently than they appear, but one must at the same time recognize that their ultimate voidness does not preclude their conventional functioning, any more than conventional functioning gives them true existence.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Roger, "The dGe ldan-bKa’ brgyud Tradition of Mahamudra How Much dGe ldan? How Much bKa’ brgyud?" in ''Newland, Guy, Changing Minds: Contributions to the Study of Buddhism and Tibet in Honor of Jeffrey Hopkins 2001 p. 178''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Extraordinary meditation practices===
The practice of ordinary meditation eventually leads one to the yoga of simplicity, which according to Gampopa, is "understanding the essential state of that awareness [of one-pointedness] as nonarising [emptiness], which transcends conceptual modes of reality and unreality."&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; One sees all phenomena just as they are, non-conceptually, beyond extremes of existence and non-existence.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

====One taste====
According to [[Gampopa]] the yoga of one taste is "understanding diverse appearances as being one, from the standpoint of their intrinsic nature."&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Reginald Ray, ''Secret of the Vajra World''. Shambhala 2001, p 280.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Phagmo Drupa Dorje Gyalpo|Phagmo Drupa]] says: &lt;blockquote&gt;By meditating on the one taste of all things, the meditator will cognize the one taste of all these things. The diversity of appearances and nonappearances, mind and emptiness, emptiness and non-emptiness, Are all of one taste, undifferentiable in their intrinsic emptiness. Understanding and lack of understanding are of one taste; Meditation and nonmeditation are nondifferentiable; Meditation and absence of meditation are unified into one taste; Discrimination and lack of discrimination are one taste In the expanse of reality.&lt;ref&gt;Reginald Ray, ''Secret of the Vajra World''. Shambhala 2001, pages 280-281&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Non-meditation====
[[Gampopa]] states that non-meditation is "an unceasing realization of the union of appearance and its intrinsic emptiness."&lt;ref&gt;Reginald Ray, ''Secret of the Vajra World''. Shambhala 2001, p 282&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Phagmo Drupa Dorje Gyalpo|Phagmo Drupa]] says: &lt;blockquote&gt;By perfecting this [nonmeditation] stage the meditator attains naked, unsupported awareness. This nondiscriminatory awareness is the meditation! By transcending the duality of meditation and meditator, external and internal realities, the meditating awareness dissolves itself into its luminous clarity. Transcending the intellect, it is without the duality of meditation and post-meditation. Such is the quintessence of mind. &lt;ref&gt;Reginald Ray, ''Secret of the Vajra World''. Shambhala 2001, pp 282-283&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Six Words of Advice===
{{Main|Tilopa#Six_Words_of_Advice}}
[[Tilopa]] was a Bengali [[mahasiddha]] who developed the mahāmudrā method around 1,000 C.E. Tilopa gave [[Naropa]], his successor, a teaching on mahāmudrā meditation called the Six Words of Advice.

In the following chart a translation is given of the Tilopa's Six Words of Advice.&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Ken McLeod]], the text contains exactly six words; the two English translations given in the following table are both attributed to him.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Metallum Martis''''', a 1665 [[book]] by [[Dud Dudley]], is the earliest known reference to the use of [[coal]] in [[metallurgical]] [[smelting]]. The book is also referred to as ''Iron made with Pit-Coale, Sea-Coale, &amp;c. And with the same Fuell to Melt and Fine Imperfect Mettals, And Refine perfect Mettals.''

Many attendant difficulties had to be overcome before this [[fuel]] could be applied to the purpose of [[smelting]] [[iron]]. Dudley does not describe in his book how he was using coal, only that he was. In so doing, he described his use successively of an ironworks on [[Pensnett Chase]] and at [[Cradley, West Midlands|Cradley]], of a furnace at [[Himley Hall|Himley]], and of a furnace at Hasco Bridge near [[Gornal, West Midlands|Gornal]].

Dudley does mention several things that indicate what he was doing. The coal he used was the small pieces and slack which were "little or of no use in that inland country" and so brought in no money. This coal debris was left in heaps and "crowded moist slack heat naturally, and kindle in the middle of these great heaps, often sets the coal works on fire" and that "Also from these sulphurous heaps, mixed with ironstone (for out of many of the same pits is gotten much ironstone or mine), the fires heating vast quantities of water, passing through these soughs or adits becometh as hot as the bath at [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]".&lt;ref&gt;Scrivenor quoting Dudley, {{harv|Scrivenor|1854|p=40,41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dudley describes two rival attempts to smelt iron with coal instigated by supporters of Parliament during the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] and the [[Interregnum (England)|Interregnum]]. Dudley visited both sites and having examined their furnaces and production methods, when asked his opinion, informed the proprietors that they would fail. The first attempt was by Captain Buck, with the backing of many parliamentary officers including Oliver Cromwell, with technical help from Edward Dagney, an Italian. In the second attempt in the late 1656–67 by Captain John Copley also failed despite Dudley, at no charge, improving the efficiency of Copley's bellows. Dudley reapplied for a patent from Charles II, in 1660 stating "and seeing no man able to perform the mastery of making of iron with pit-coal or sea-coal, ... [without my] laudable inventions the author was, and is, unwilling [that they] should fall to the ground and die with him".&lt;ref&gt;Scrivenor quoting Dudley, {{harv|Scrivenor|1854|pp=45–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A significant feature of his great work ''Metallum Martis'' is a map showing [[Dudley Castle]] where he correctly identifies the order and geographic layout of [[stratum|strata]] of coal and [[ironstone]] under survey.

Considered to be the earliest of recorded [[geologic map]]s, ''Metallum Martis'' marks a turning point in the evolution of scientific rationale concerning the recording and interpretation of [[geology|geological]] information. It is considered to have been made at Castle Hill in Dudley by Dud Dudley in 1665.

'''Murder''' is the unlawful killing of another [[human]]&lt;!-- NOTE: As the vast majority of sources show, the term "murder" generally pertains to humans, not to all forms of life. So, per WP:Due weight, do not add text to this first sentence indicating that "murder" refers to all forms of life.--&gt; without [[justification (jurisprudence)|justification]] or valid [[excuse (legal)|excuse]], especially the unlawful killing of another human being with [[malice aforethought]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=West's Encyclopedia of American Law Volume 7 (Legal Representation to Oyez)|date=1998|publisher=West Group|isbn=978-0314201607|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ow7AQAAIAAJ&amp;q=0314201602|accessdate=10 September 2017}} ("The unlawful killing of another human being without justification or excuse.")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Murder 1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Murder|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/murder|website=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=10 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171002121211/https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/murder|archivedate=2 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Murder 2"&gt;{{cite book|title=The American Heritage Dictionary|date=2012|publisher=Random House Publishing Group,|isbn=978-0553583229|edition=5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-PT6ygAACAAJ|accessdate=10 September 2017}} ("The killing of another person without justification or excuse, especially the crime of killing a person with malice aforethought or with recklessness manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life.")&lt;/ref&gt; This state of mind may, depending upon the [[jurisdiction (area)|jurisdiction]], distinguish murder from other forms of unlawful [[homicide]], such as [[manslaughter]]. [[Manslaughter]] is a killing committed in the absence of ''malice'', brought about by reasonable [[Provocation (legal)|provocation]], or [[diminished capacity]]. [[Involuntary manslaughter|''Involuntary'' manslaughter]], where it is recognized, is a killing that lacks all but the most attenuated [[Mens rea|guilty intent]], recklessness. 

Most societies consider murder to be an extremely serious crime, and thus believe that the person charged should receive harsh punishments for the purposes of [[Retributive justice|retribution]], [[Deterrence (legal)|deterrence]], [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]], or [[Crime prevention|incapacitation]]. In most countries, a person convicted of murder generally faces a long-term prison sentence, possibly a [[life imprisonment|life sentence]]; and in a few, the [[death penalty]] may be imposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/28/us-china-death-penalty-amnesty |location=London |work=The Guardian |first=Mark |last=Tran |title=China and US among top punishers but death penalty in decline |date=2011-03-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217065243/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/28/us-china-death-penalty-amnesty |archivedate=2017-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The modern English word "murder" descends from the [[Proto-Indo-European]] "mrtró" which meant "to die".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bynon|first1=Theodora|title=Historical Linguistics|date=1977|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521291880|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A-dB-7CYMwcC|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Middle English]] ''mordre'' is a noun from [[Anglo-Saxon]] ''morðor'' and [[Old French]] ''murdre''. Middle English ''mordre'' is a verb from Anglo-Saxon ''myrdrian'' and the Middle English noun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nielson|first1=William A.|last2=Patch|first2=Howard R.|title=Selections from Chaucer|date=1921|publisher=Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co.|location=New York|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JTtLAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
&lt;!-- This section is too jurisdiction-specific, and need some analysis of the Common Law definition and maybe just a statement that it has been more or less universally applied, although with some modification, in common-law jurisdictions --&gt;
The eighteenth-century English jurist [[William Blackstone]] (citing [[Edward Coke]]), in his ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'' set out the [[common law]] definition of murder, which by this definition occurs
{{quote|when a person, of sound memory and discretion, unlawfully kills any reasonable creature in being and under the king's peace, with malice aforethought, either express or implied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blackstone|first1=William|title=Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England|date=1765|publisher=Avalon Project, Yale Law School|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/blackstone_bk4ch14.asp|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810204659/http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/blackstone_bk4ch14.asp|archivedate=2011-08-10|df=}} Book the Fourth - Chapter the Fourteenth : Of Homicide.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The elements of common law murder are:

# Unlawful
# killing
# through criminal act or omission
# of a human
# by another human
# with malice aforethought.&lt;ref name="Joshua Dressler 2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joshua Dressler |title=Understanding Criminal Law|edition=3rd |publisher=Lexis |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-8205-5027-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Unlawful''' – This distinguishes murder from killings that are done within the boundaries of law, such as capital punishment, justified [[self-defence]], or the killing of enemy [[combatant]]s by lawful combatants as well as causing [[collateral damage]] to [[non-combatant]]s during a war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dennis J. Baker |title=Glanville Williams Textbook of Criminal Law |location=London |year=2012 |chapter=Chapter 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Killing''' – At common law life ended with [[cardiopulmonary arrest]]&lt;ref name="Joshua Dressler 2001" /&gt; – the total and irreversible cessation of blood circulation and respiration.&lt;ref name="Joshua Dressler 2001" /&gt; With advances in medical technology courts have adopted irreversible cessation of all brain function as marking the end of life.&lt;ref name="Joshua Dressler 2001" /&gt;

'''Сriminal act or omission''' – Killing can be committed by an act or an [[Omission (law)|omission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ashford|first1=Elizabeth|title=Killing &amp; Letting Die|url=https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~ea10/topic3b.htm|website=Philosophy 4826, Life and Death|publisher=University of St. Andrews|accessdate=10 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202001338/http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~ea10/topic3b.htm|archivedate=2 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''of a human''' – This element presents the issue of when life begins. At common law, a [[fetus]] was not a human being.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Tait'' [1990] 1 QB 290.&lt;/ref&gt; Life began when the fetus passed through the [[vagina]] and took its first breath.&lt;ref name="Joshua Dressler 2001" /&gt;

'''by another human''' – In early common law, [[suicide]] was considered murder.&lt;ref name="Joshua Dressler 2001" /&gt; The requirement that the person killed be someone other than the perpetrator excluded suicide from the definition of murder.

'''with malice aforethought''' – Originally ''[[malice aforethought]]'' carried its everyday meaning – a deliberate and premeditated (prior intent) killing of another motivated by ill will. Murder necessarily required that an appreciable time pass between the formation and execution of the intent to kill. The courts broadened the scope of murder by eliminating the requirement of actual premeditation and deliberation as well as true malice. All that was required for malice aforethought to exist is that the perpetrator act with one of the four states of mind that constitutes "malice".

The four states of mind recognized as constituting "malice" are:&lt;ref&gt;Wise, Edward. "Criminal Law" in ''Introduction to the Law of the United States'' (Clark and Ansay, eds.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=lpybMKdDoVIC&amp;pg=PA154 154] (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Ordered list|list-style-type=lower-roman
|[[Intention (criminal law)|Intent to kill]],
|Intent to inflict [[grievous bodily harm]] short of death,
|Reckless indifference to an unjustifiably high risk to human life (sometimes described as an "abandoned and malignant heart"), or
|Intent to commit a dangerous [[felony]] (the "[[felony murder]]" doctrine).
}}

Under state of mind (i), intent to kill, the ''deadly weapon rule'' applies. Thus, if the defendant intentionally uses a [[deadly weapon]] or instrument against the victim, such use authorizes a permissive inference of intent to kill. In other words, "[[transferred intent|intent follows the bullet]]". Examples of deadly weapons and instruments include but are not limited to guns, knives, deadly toxins or chemicals or gases and even vehicles when intentionally used to harm one or more victims.

Under state of mind (iii), an "abandoned and malignant heart", the killing must result from the defendant's conduct involving a reckless indifference to human life and a conscious disregard of an unreasonable risk of death or serious bodily injury. In Australian jurisdictions, the unreasonable risk must amount to a foreseen probability of death (or grievous bodily harm in most states), as opposed to possibility.&lt;ref name="R v Crabbe"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|22|1985|litigants=R v [[Douglas Crabbe|Crabbe]] |parallelcite=(1985) 156 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 464 |courtname=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]] |date=26 March 1985}}; but the common law has been modified in NSW: {{cite AustLII|HCA|27|1991|litigants=Royall v R |parallelcite=(1991) 172 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 378 |courtname=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]] |date=25 June 1991}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under state of mind (iv), the felony-murder doctrine, the felony committed must be an inherently dangerous felony, such as burglary, arson, rape, robbery or kidnapping. Importantly, the underlying felony ''cannot'' be a [[lesser included offense]] such as assault, otherwise all criminal homicides would be murder as all are felonies.

As with most legal terms, the precise definition of murder varies between jurisdictions and is usually codified in some form of legislation. Even when the legal distinction between murder and manslaughter is clear, it is not unknown for a jury to find a murder defendant guilty of the lesser offence. The jury might sympathise with the defendant (e.g. in a [[crime of passion]], or in the case of a bullied victim who kills their tormentor), and the jury may wish to protect the defendant from a sentence of life imprisonment or execution.

===Degrees of murder===
{{Redirect|Murder in the second degree|the 2016 album|Murder in the Second Degree}}
Many jurisdictions divide murder by degrees. The distinction between first- and second-degree murder exists, for example, in [[Murder (Canadian law)|Canadian murder law]] and [[Murder (United States law)#Degrees|U.S. murder law]].

The most common division is between first- and second-degree murder. Generally, second-degree murder is common law murder, and first-degree is an aggravated form. The aggravating factors of first-degree murder depend on the jurisdiction, but may include a specific intent to kill, premeditation, or deliberation. In some, murder committed by acts such as [[strangulation]], [[poisoning]], or [[lying in wait]] are also treated as first-degree murder.&lt;ref&gt;Murder in the First and Second Degree (14–17)
A murder which shall be perpetrated by ... poison, lying in wait, imprisonment, starving, torture, or by any other kind of willful, deliberate and premeditated killing or which shall be committed in the perpetration or attempted perpetration of any arson, rape or sex offense, robbery, kidnapping, burglary, or other felony committed or attempted with the use of a deadly weapon, shall be ... murder in the first degree ... and shall be punished by death or life imprisonment ... except that any person ... under 17 years of age at the time of the murder shall be punished with imprisonment ... for life.
All other kinds of murder, including that which shall be proximately caused by the unlawful distribution of opium or any synthetic or natural salt, compound, derivative, or the preparation of opium ... cause the death of the user, shall be ... murder in the second degree and ... shall be punished as a Class C felony
&lt;/ref&gt; A few states in the U.S. further distinguish [[third-degree murder]], but they differ significantly in which kinds of murders they classify as second-degree versus third-degree. For example, Minnesota defines third-degree murder as [[depraved-heart murder]], whereas Florida defines third-degree murder as [[felony murder]] (except when the underlying felony is specifically listed in the definition of first-degree murder).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1427&amp;context=flr|first=Frank|last=Brenner|title=The Impulsive Murder and the Degree Device|journal=Fordham Law Review|volume=22|issue=3|year=1953|access-date=2018-03-13|ref=harv|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180313214239/https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1427&amp;context=flr|archivedate=2018-03-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://statelaws.findlaw.com/minnesota-law/minnesota-second-degree-murder.html|title=Minnesota Second-Degree Murder|website=findlaw.com|access-date=2018-03-13|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180314043759/http://statelaws.findlaw.com/minnesota-law/minnesota-second-degree-murder.html|archivedate=2018-03-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some jurisdictions also distinguish premeditated murder. This is the [[crime]] of wrongfully and intentionally causing the death of another [[human]] being (also known as murder) after rationally considering the timing or method of doing so, in order to either increase the likelihood of success, or to evade detection or apprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Premeditation|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/premeditation|website=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=10 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910082842/https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/premeditation|archivedate=10 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[U.S. state|State]] laws in the [[United States]] vary as to definitions of "premeditation". In some states, premeditation may be construed as taking place mere seconds before the murder. Premeditated murder is one of the most serious forms of [[homicide]], and is punished more severely than [[manslaughter]] or other types of murder, often with a [[life imprisonment|life sentence]] without the possibility of [[parole]], or in some countries, the [[capital punishment|death penalty]]. In the U.S, [[United States federal law|federal law]] ({{USCSub|18|1111|a}}) criminalizes premeditated murder, felony murder and second-degree murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Title 18 USC, Sec. 1111, Murder|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1111|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=10 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910040431/https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1111|archivedate=10 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] classifies [[Murder (Canadian law)|murder]] as either 1st- or 2nd-degree. The former type of murder is often called premeditated murder, although premeditation is not the only way murder can be classified as first-degree.

===Common law===
According to Blackstone, English [[common law]] identified murder as a ''public wrong''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/blackstone/bk4ch14.htm |title=Blackstone, Book 4, Chapter 14 |publisher=Yale.edu |accessdate=2010-06-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203082805/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/blackstone/bk4ch14.htm |archivedate=2010-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to common law, murder is considered to be ''[[malum in se]]'', that is an act which is evil within itself. An act such as murder is wrong or evil by its very nature. And it is the very nature of the act which does not require any specific detailing or definition in the law to consider murder a crime.&lt;ref&gt;A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage By Bryan A. Garner, p. 545.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some jurisdictions still take a [[common law]] view of murder. In such jurisdictions, what is considered to be murder is defined by [[precedent]] case law or previous decisions of the courts of law. However, although the common law is by nature flexible and adaptable, in the interests both of certainty and of securing convictions, most common law jurisdictions have [[Codification (law)|codified]] their criminal law and now have statutory definitions of murder.

===Exclusions===

====General====
Although laws vary by country, there are circumstances of exclusion that are common in many legal systems.
*Killing of enemy combatants who have not surrendered by lawful combatants, in accordance with lawful orders in war, is also generally not considered murder; although illicit killings within a war may constitute murder or homicidal [[war crime]]s. (see the [[Laws of war]] article)
*[[Self-defence (theory)|Self-defence]]: acting in self-defence or in defence of another person is generally accepted as legal justification for killing a person in situations that would otherwise have been murder. However, a self-defence killing might be considered manslaughter if the killer established control of the situation before the killing took place. In the case of self-defence it is called a "justifiable homicide".&lt;ref name="crim liability"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000278633&amp;dateTexte=|title=Article 122-5|accessdate=2007-11-01|publisher=Legifrance|author=The French Parliament|website=French Criminal Law|language=fr|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408162844/http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000278633&amp;dateTexte=|archivedate=2008-04-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Unlawful killings without malice or intent are considered [[manslaughter]].
*In many common law countries, [[provocation (legal)|provocation]] is a partial defence to a charge of murder which acts by converting what would otherwise have been murder into manslaughter (this is voluntary manslaughter, which is more severe than involuntary manslaughter).
*Accidental killings are considered [[homicide]]s. Depending on the circumstances, these may or may not be considered criminal offenses; they are often considered [[manslaughter]].
*[[Suicide]] does not constitute murder in most societies. Assisting a suicide, however, may be considered murder in some circumstances.

====Specific to certain countries====
*[[Capital punishment]]: some countries practice the death penalty. Capital punishment may be ordered by a legitimate court of law as the result of a conviction in a [[criminal trial]] with [[due process]] for a serious crime. The 47 Member States of the [[Council of Europe]] are prohibited from using the death penalty.
*[[Euthanasia]], doctor-assisted suicide: the administration of lethal drugs by a doctor to a [[terminally ill]] patient, if the intention is solely to alleviate pain, in many jurisdictions it is seen as a special case (see the doctrine of [[double effect]] and the case of [[John Bodkin Adams|Dr John Bodkin Adams]]).&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mDvBJ5J4tusC&amp;pg=PA177&amp;lpg=PA177&amp;dq=%22Thomas+Lodwig%22+dr |title=Margaret Otlowski, '&amp;#39;Voluntary Euthanasia and the Common Law'&amp;#39;, Oxford University Press, 1997, pp. 175–177 |accessdate=2010-06-25|isbn=978-0-19-825996-1|year=1997|last1=Otlowski |first1=Margaret }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In the United States, in some states and in federal jurisdiction, a killing by a police officer is excluded from prosecution if the officer believes they are being threatened with deadly force by the victim.

*[[Space jurisdiction]] is similar to that of [[international waters]]. Therefore, a murder committed in outer space is subject to jurisdiction in the country that owns the space craft in which the killing transpired. In the event the murder occurred on an extraterrestrial planet (e.g. The [[Moon]]), no country can own land of any other planet&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-03-31|title=Outer Space Treaty|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Outer_Space_Treaty&amp;oldid=773109867|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; so the killer is bound by the laws of the country in which they originate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-04-26|title=Extraterritorial jurisdiction|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Extraterritorial_jurisdiction&amp;oldid=777327355|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also applies to the [[International Space Station|ISS]] per agreement signed by all countries that have worked on the station so all astronauts are covered by [[Extraterritorial jurisdiction|extraterratorial jurisdiction.]]

===Victim===
[[File:Jakub Schikaneder - Murder in the House.JPG|thumb|''Murder in the House'', [[Jakub Schikaneder]].]]
All jurisdictions require that the victim be a natural person; that is, a [[human being]] who was still alive before being murdered. In other words, under the law one cannot murder a [[cadaver|corpse]], a corporation, a non-human animal, or any other non-human [[organism]] such as a plant or bacterium.

[[California]]'s murder statute, [[California Penal Code|Penal Code]] [[187 (murder)|Section 187]], was interpreted by the [[Supreme Court of California]] in 1994 as not requiring any proof of the viability of the fetus as a prerequisite to a murder conviction.&lt;ref name="davis"&gt;''People v. Davis'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/C4/7C4t797.htm 7 Cal. 4th 797, 30 Cal. Rptr. 2d 50, 872 P.2d 591] (1994).&lt;/ref&gt; This holding has two implications. The first is a defendant in California can be convicted of murder for killing a fetus which the mother herself could have terminated without committing a crime.&lt;ref name="davis" /&gt; The second, as stated by Justice [[Stanley Mosk]] in his dissent, is that because women carrying nonviable fetuses may not be visibly pregnant, it may be possible for a defendant to be convicted of intentionally murdering a person they did not know existed.&lt;ref name="davis" /&gt;

===Mitigating circumstances===
Some countries allow conditions that "affect the balance of the mind" to be regarded as [[mitigating factor|mitigating circumstances]]. This means that a person may be found guilty of "manslaughter" on the basis of "diminished responsibility" rather than being found guilty of murder, if it can be proved that the killer was suffering from a condition that affected their judgment at the time. [[clinical depression|Depression]], [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] and medication [[adverse effect (medicine)|side-effect]]s are examples of conditions that may be taken into account when assessing responsibility.

====Insanity====
{{main|Insanity defense|M'Naghten rules}}
[[Mental Disorder (Insanity) Defense|Mental disorder]] may apply to a wide range of disorders including [[psychosis]] caused by [[schizophrenia]] and [[dementia]], and excuse the person from the need to undergo the stress of a trial as to liability. Usually, [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopathy]] and other [[personality disorders]] are not legally considered insanity, because of the belief they are the result of [[free will]] in many societies. In some jurisdictions, following the pre-trial hearing to determine the extent of the disorder, the defence of "not guilty by reason of insanity" may be used to get a not guilty verdict.&lt;ref&gt;''M'Naughten's case'', [1843] All ER Rep 229.&lt;/ref&gt; This defence has two elements:

# That the [[defendant]] had a serious mental illness, disease, or defect.
# That the defendant's mental condition, at the time of the killing, rendered the perpetrator unable to determine right from wrong, or that what they were doing was wrong.
[[File:CCTV 1 of Aaron Alexis in building 197.jpg|thumb|[[Aaron Alexis]] holding a shotgun during his rampage.]]

Under [[New York (state)|New York]] law, for example:
{{quote|§ 40.15 Mental disease or defect. In any prosecution for an offense, it is an affirmative defence that when the defendant engaged in the proscribed conduct, he lacked criminal responsibility by reason of mental disease or defect. Such lack of criminal responsibility means that at the time of such conduct, as a result of mental disease or defect, he lacked substantial capacity to know or appreciate either: 1. The nature and consequences of such conduct; or 2. That such conduct was wrong.|[[N.Y. Penal Law]], § 40.15&lt;ref&gt;N.Y.

Under the [[French Penal Code of 1791|French Penal Code]]:
{{quote |Article 122-1
*A person is not criminally liable who, when the act was committed, was suffering from a psychological or neuropsychological disorder which destroyed his discernment or his ability to control his actions.
*A person who, at the time he acted, was suffering from a psychological or neuropsychological disorder which reduced his discernment or impeded his ability to control his actions, remains punishable; however, the court shall take this into account when it decides the penalty and determines its regime. |Penal Code §122-1 found at [http://195.83.177.9/code/liste.phtml?lang=uk&amp;c=33&amp;r=3627 Legifrance web site]}}

Those who successfully argue a defence based on a mental disorder are usually referred to mandatory clinical treatment until they are certified safe to be released back into the community, rather than prison.&lt;ref name="french civil law on mental health"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006072665&amp;idArticle=LEGIARTI000006687933&amp;dateTexte=20080929 |title=Code de la Santé Publique Chapitre III: Hospitalisation d'office Article L3213-1 |accessdate=2007-10-23 |publisher=Legifrance |year=2002 |language=fr |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081021032011/http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006072665&amp;idArticle=LEGIARTI000006687933&amp;dateTexte=20080929 |archivedate=2008-10-21 |df= }}, note: this text refers to the procedure of [[involuntary commitment]] by the demand of the public authority, but the prefect systematically use that procedure whenever a man is discharged due to his dementia.&lt;/ref&gt;  A criminal defendant is often presented with the option of pleading "not guilty by reason of insanity".  Thus, a finding of insanity results in a not-guilty verdict, although the defendant is placed in a state treatment facility where they could be kept for years or even decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.jrank.org/pages/7667/Insanity-Defense-Consequences.html|title=Insanity Defenses – Consequences|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt;|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=31 July 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170801080137/http://law.jrank.org/pages/7667/Insanity-Defense-Consequences.html|archivedate=1 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Postpartum depression====
[[Postpartum depression]] (also known as post-natal depression) is recognized in some countries as a mitigating factor in cases of [[infanticide]]. According to Dr. Susan Friedman, "Two dozen nations have infanticide laws that decrease the penalty for mothers who kill their children of up to one year of age. The United States does not have such a law, but mentally ill mothers may plead not guilty by reason of insanity."&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, SH. "Commentary: Postpartum Psychosis, Infanticide, and Insanity Implications for Forensic Psychiatry", J Am Acad Psychiatry Law 40:3:326-332 (September 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[law of the Republic of Ireland]], infanticide was made a separate crime from murder in 1949, applicable for the mother of a baby under one year old where "the balance of her mind was disturbed by reason of her not having fully recovered from the effect of giving birth to the child or by reason of the effect of lactation consequent upon the birth of the child".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1949/act/16/section/1/enacted/en/html#sec1 |title=Infanticide Act, 1949, Section 1 |website=[[Irish Statute Book]] |accessdate=22 May 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601084439/http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1949/act/16/section/1/enacted/en/html#sec1 |archivedate=1 June 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since independence, death sentences for murder in such cases had always been [[commutation of sentence|commuted]];&lt;ref name="Rattigan2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rattigan|first=Clíona|year=2008|title='Done to death by father or relatives': Irish families and infanticide cases, 1922–1950|journal=The History of the Family|volume=13|issue=4|pages=370–383|issn=1081-602X|doi=10.1016/j.hisfam.2008.09.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; the new act was intended "to eliminate all the terrible ritual of the [[black cap]] and the solemn words of the judge pronouncing sentence of death in those cases ... where it is clear to the Court and to everybody, except perhaps the unfortunate accused, that the sentence will never be carried out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/DebatesWebPack.nsf/takes/seanad1949070700007 |title=Infanticide Bill, 1949—Second and Subsequent Stages |website=Seanad Éireann debates |pages=Vol.36 c.1472 |nopp=Y |date=7 July 1949 |accessdate=22 May 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701225250/http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/DebatesWebPack.nsf/takes/seanad1949070700007 |archivedate=1 July 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Russia, murder of a newborn child by the mother has been separate crime since 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[[Criminal Code of Russia]], art.106&lt;/ref&gt;

====Unintentional====
For a killing to be considered murder in nine out of fifty states in the US, there normally needs to be an element of intent. A defendant may argue that they took precautions not to kill, that the death could not have been anticipated, or was unavoidable. As a general rule, [[manslaughter]]&lt;ref name="manslaughter in France"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://195.83.177.9/code/liste.phtml?lang=uk&amp;c=33&amp;r=3691|title=Article 222-8|accessdate=2007-11-01|publisher=Legifrance|author=The French Parliament|website=French Criminal Law|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102221056/http://195.83.177.9/code/liste.phtml?lang=uk&amp;c=33&amp;r=3691|archivedate=2007-11-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; constitutes [[recklessness (law)|reckless]] killing, but manslaughter also includes criminally negligent (i.e. grossly negligent) homicide.&lt;ref name="invol offences"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://195.83.177.9/code/liste.phtml?lang=uk&amp;c=33&amp;r=3686|title=Section II – Involuntary Offences Against Life|accessdate=2007-11-01|publisher=Legifrance|author=The French Parliament|website=French Criminal Law|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102221040/http://195.83.177.9/code/liste.phtml?lang=uk&amp;c=33&amp;r=3686|archivedate=2007-11-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unintentional killing that results from an involuntary action generally cannot constitute murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Michaels|first1=Alan C.|title=Defining Unintended Murder|journal=Columbia Law Review|volume=85|issue=4|pages=786–811|jstor=1122334|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; After examining the evidence, a judge or jury (depending on the jurisdiction) would determine whether the killing was intentional or unintentional.

====Diminished capacity====
In those jurisdictions using the Uniform Penal Code, such as [[California]], [[diminished capacity]] may be a defence. For example, [[Dan White]] used this defence&lt;ref&gt;The so-called "[[Twinkie defense]]").&lt;/ref&gt; to obtain a manslaughter conviction, instead of murder, in the [[assassination]] of Mayor [[George Moscone]] and Supervisor [[Harvey Milk]]. Afterward, California amended its penal code to provide "As a matter of public policy there shall be no defense of diminished capacity, diminished responsibility, or irresistible impulse in a criminal action...."&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.justia.com/codes/california/2011/pen/part-1/25-29/28/ California Penal Code § 28(b)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180425183608/https://law.justia.com/codes/california/2011/pen/part-1/25-29/28/ |date=2018-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aggravating circumstances===
Murder with specified [[aggravation (legal concept)|aggravating circumstances]] is often punished more harshly. Depending on the jurisdiction, such circumstances may include:

*Premeditation
*Poisoning
*Murder of a child
*Murder of a police officer,&lt;ref name="Murder English law"&gt;See [[Murder (English law)]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NSW (of Australia) Law"&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|ca190082|Crimes Act 1900|19B}} Mandatory life sentences for murder of police officers.&lt;/ref&gt; judge, firefighter or witness to a crime&lt;ref&gt;See [[Murder (United States law)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Murder in English law|Murder]], under [[English criminal law]], always carries a mandatory [[Life imprisonment in England and Wales|life sentence]], but is not classified into degrees. Penalties for murder committed under aggravating circumstances are often higher, under English law, than the 15-year minimum non-parole period that otherwise serves as a starting point for a murder committed by an adult.

===Felony murder rule===
{{Main|Felony murder rule}}
A legal [[doctrine]] in some [[common law]] jurisdictions  broadens the crime of murder: when an offender kills in the commission of a dangerous crime, (regardless of intent), he/she is guilty of murder. The felony murder rule is often justified by its supporters as a means of deterring dangerous felonies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sidak|first1=J.

===Year-and-a-day rule===
{{Main|Year and a day rule}}
In some [[common law]] jurisdictions, a [[defendant]] accused of murder is not guilty if the victim survives for longer than [[year and a day rule|one year and one day]] after the attack.&lt;ref&gt;See ''State v. Picotte'', 2003 WI 42, 261 Wis. 2d 249 (2003)[http://law.justia.com/wisconsin/codes/2010/940/940.10.html](search for "year-and-a-day rule")&lt;/ref&gt; This reflects the likelihood that if the victim dies, other factors will have contributed to the cause of death, breaking the chain of [[causation (law)|causation]]; and also means that the responsible person does not have a charge of murder "hanging over their head indefinitely".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Criminal lawyers back review of time limit for homicide charges|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/325302/criminal-lawyers-back-review-after-family's-plea|accessdate=14 August 2017|work=Radio NZ|date=25 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170814102630/http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/325302/criminal-lawyers-back-review-after-family's-plea|archivedate=14 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subject to any [[statute of limitations]], the accused could still be charged with an offence reflecting the seriousness of the initial assault.

With advances in modern medicine, most countries have abandoned a fixed time period and test causation on the facts of the case. This is known as "delayed death" and cases where this was applied or was attempted to be applied go back to at least 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.newsweek.com/will-john-hinckley-jr-face-murder-charges-delayed-death-james-brady-263716|journal=Newsweek|title=Will John Hinckley Jr. Face Murder Charges for the 'Delayed Death' of James Brady?|last=Wofford|first=Taylor|date=August 9, 2014|accessdate=2015-02-28|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150310062113/http://www.newsweek.com/will-john-hinckley-jr-face-murder-charges-delayed-death-james-brady-263716|archivedate=March 10, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[England and Wales]], the "year-and-a-day rule" was abolished by the [[Law Reform (Year and a Day Rule) Act 1996]]. However, if death occurs three years or more after the original attack then prosecution can take place only with the [[Attorney-General]]'s approval.

In the United States, many jurisdictions have abolished the rule as well.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3098137125217744818|title=''People v.

In 2001 the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held that retroactive application of a state supreme court decision abolishing the year-and-a-day rule did not violate the [[Ex post facto law|Ex Post Facto]] Clause of [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article I of the United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Rogers v. Tennessee]]'', {{ussc|532|451|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The potential effect of fully abolishing the rule can be seen in the case of 74-year-old William Barnes, charged with the murder of a Philadelphia police officer Walter Barkley, who he'd shot nearly 41 years before. Barnes had served 16 years in prison for attempting to murder Barkley, but when the policeman died on August 19, 2007, this was alleged to be from complications of the wounds suffered from the shooting - and Barnes was charged with his murder. He was acquitted on May 24, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Shooter acquitted of murder charge in 1966 shooting of Philadelphia police officer|url=http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2010/05/shooter_acquitted_of_murder_ch.html|agency=Associated Press|publisher=PA Media Group|date=24 May 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910084004/http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2010/05/shooter_acquitted_of_murder_ch.html|archivedate=10 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder and natural selection==
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2016}}
[[Martin Daly]] and [[Margo Wilson]] of [[McMaster University]] have claimed that several aspects of [[homicide]]s, including the genetic relations or proximity between murderers and their victims, (as in the [[Cinderella effect]]), can often be explained by the [[evolution theory]] or [[evolutionary psychology]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=dan|title=Human behaviour: Killer instincts|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080130/full/451512a.html|website=nature.com|publisher=Nature|accessdate=23 May 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170528155523/http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080130/full/451512a.html|archivedate=28 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Abrahamic religion]]s, the first ever murder was committed by [[Cain]] against his brother Abel out of [[jealousy]].&lt;ref&gt;Schimmel, Solomon. "Envy in Jewish thought and literature." Envy: Theory and research (2008): 17-38.&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, certain types of homicide were lawful and justified. Georg Oesterdiekhoff wrote:

{{quote|Evans-Pritchard says about the [[Nuer people|Nuer]] from Sudan: "Homicide is not forbidden, and Nuer do not think it wrong to kill a man in fair fight. On the contrary, a man who slays another in combat is admired for his courage and skill." ([[E. E. Evans-Pritchard|Evans-Pritchard]] 1956: 195) This statement is true for most African tribes, for pre-modern Europeans, for Indigenous Australians, and for Native Americans, according to ethnographic reports from all over the world. ... Homicides rise to incredible numbers among [[headhunting|headhunter]] cultures such as the [[New Guinea|Papua]]. When a boy is born, the father has to kill a man. He needs a name for his child and can receive it only by a man, he himself has murdered. When a man wants to marry, he must kill a man. When a man dies, his family again has to kill a man.&lt;ref&gt;Georg Oesterdiekhoff.

In many such societies the redress was not via a legal system, but by [[blood feud|blood revenge]], although there might also be a form of payment that could be made instead—such as the [[weregild]] which in early [[Germanic society]] could be paid to the victim's family [[in lieu]] of their right of revenge.

One of the oldest-known prohibitions against murder appears in the Sumerian [[Code of Ur-Nammu]] written sometime between 2100 and 2050 [[Before Christ|BC]]. The code states, "If a man commits a murder, that man must be killed."

In [[Judeo-Christian]] traditions, the [[murder in the Bible|prohibition against murder]] is one of the [[Ten Commandments]] given by God to Moses in (Exodus: 20v13) and (Deuteronomy 5v17). The [[Vulgate]] and subsequent early English translations of the Bible used the term ''secretly killeth his neighbour'' or ''smiteth his neighbour secretly'' rather than ''murder'' for the Latin ''clam percusserit proximum''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latinvulgate.com/verse.aspx?t=0&amp;b=5&amp;c=27 |title='&amp;#39;Vulgate'&amp;#39; Deuteronomy Ch27 V24 |publisher=Latinvulgate.com |accessdate=2010-06-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010204152/http://latinvulgate.com/verse.aspx?t=0&amp;b=5&amp;c=27 |archivedate=2010-10-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hebrewoldtestament.com/B05C027.htm#V24 |title='&amp;#39;Parallel Hebrew Old Testament'&amp;#39; Deuteronomy Ch27 V24 |publisher=Hebrewoldtestament.com |accessdate=2010-06-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129231400/http://hebrewoldtestament.com/B05C027.htm#V24 |archivedate=2010-11-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later editions such as [[Young's Literal Translation]] and the [[World English Bible]] have translated the Latin ''occides'' simply as ''murder''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccel.org/bible/ylt/Exodus/20.html |title=Exodus 20v13 |quote=Thou dost not murder. |website=Young's Literal Translation |accessdate=2011-01-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426062140/http://www.ccel.org/bible/ylt/Exodus/20.html |archivedate=2011-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Exodus 20v13 |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/8229/pg8229.txt |quote=You shall not murder. |website=World English Bible |accessdate=2011-01-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than the alternatives of ''kill'', ''assassinate'', ''fall upon'', or ''slay''.

In [[Islam]] according to the [[Qur'an]], one of the greatest [[sin]]s is to kill a human being who has committed no fault. "For that cause We decreed for the Children of Israel that whosoever killeth a human being for other than manslaughter or corruption in the earth, it shall be as if he had killed all mankind, and whoso saveth the life of one, it shall be as if he had saved the life of all mankind."{{Cite quran|5|32}} "And those who cry not unto any other god along with Allah, nor take the life which Allah hath forbidden save in (course of) justice, nor commit adultery – and whoso doeth this shall pay the penalty."{{Cite quran|25|68}}

The term ''assassin'' derives from [[Hashshashin]],&lt;ref&gt;''American Speech'' – McCarthy, Kevin M.. Volume 48, pp. 77–83&lt;/ref&gt; a militant [[Ismaili]] Shi'ite sect, active from the 8th to 14th centuries.

Murder demographics are affected by the improvement of [[trauma care]], which has resulted in reduced lethality of violent assaults – thus the murder rate may not necessarily indicate the overall level of social violence.&lt;ref name="harristhomas"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harris |first=Anthony R. |author2=Stephen H.

Workplace homicide, which tripled during the 1980s, is the fastest growing category of murder in America.&lt;ref name="ojp.usdoj.gov" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Csiernik|editor-first=Rick|date=2014 |title=Workplace Wellness: Issues and Responses|url= |location= |publisher=Brown Bear Press|page=19 |isbn=978-1551305714|author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development of murder rates over time in different countries is often used by both supporters and opponents of capital punishment and [[gun control]]. Using properly filtered data, it is possible to make the case for or against either of these issues. For example, one could look at murder rates in the United States from 1950 to 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Christopher Effgen |url=http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm |title=Disaster Center web site |publisher=Disastercenter.com |date=2001-09-11 |accessdate=2010-06-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68d9ZfOC6?url=http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm |archivedate=2012-06-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and notice that those rates went up sharply shortly after a [[capital punishment in the United States|moratorium on death sentences]] was effectively imposed in the late 1960s. This fact has been used to argue that capital punishment serves as a deterrent and, as such, it is morally justified. Capital punishment opponents frequently counter that the United States has much higher murder rates than [[Canada]] and most [[European Union]] countries, although all those countries have abolished the death penalty. Overall, the global pattern is [[chaos theory|too complex]], and on average, the influence of both these factors may not be significant and could be more social, economic, and cultural.

Despite the immense improvements in [[forensics]] in the past few decades, the fraction of murders solved has decreased in the United States, from 90% in 1960 to 61% in 2007.&lt;ref name="mccune"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Beale|first1=Lewis|title=Why Fewer Murder Cases Get Solved These Days|url=https://psmag.com/news/fewer-murder-cases-get-solved-3695|accessdate=10 September 2017|agency=PacificStandard|date=20 May 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910125159/https://psmag.com/news/fewer-murder-cases-get-solved-3695|archivedate=10 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solved murder rates in major U.S. cities varied in 2007 from 36% in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] to 76% in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], [[California]].&lt;ref name="monitor"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Whitley|first1=Brian|title=Why fewer murder cases get solved|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2008/1224/p02s01-usgn.html|accessdate=10 September 2017|publisher=Christian Science Monitor|date=24 December 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910084042/https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2008/1224/p02s01-usgn.html|archivedate=10 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major factors affecting the arrest rate include witness cooperation&lt;ref name="mccune" /&gt; and the number of people assigned to investigate the case.&lt;ref name="monitor" /&gt;

===History of murder rates===
[[File:Homicide-world.png|250px|thumb|Intentional homicide rate per 100,000 inhabitants, 2009]]
According to scholar Pieter Spierenburg [[homicide rates]] per 100,000 in [[Europe]] have fallen over the centuries, from 35 per 100,000 in medieval times, to 20 in 1500&amp;nbsp;AD, 5 in 1700, to below two per 100,000 in 1900.&lt;ref name="Spierenburg"&gt;Spierenburg, Pieter, ''A History of Murder: Personal Violence in Europe from the Middle Ages to the Present'', Polity, 2008. Referred to in [http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2009/11/09/091109crat_atlarge_lepore#ixzz0ePRpHvGz "Rap Sheet Why is American history so murderous?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109044828/http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2009/11/09/091109crat_atlarge_lepore |date=2010-01-09 }} by [[Jill Lepore]] New Yorker, November 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, murder rates have been higher and have fluctuated. They fell below 2 per 100,000 by 1900, rose during the first half of the century, dropped in the years following World War II, and bottomed out at 4.0 in 1957 before rising again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US murder rate by year, 1900-2010|url=https://www.democraticunderground.com/10021998000|website=Democratic Underground|accessdate=10 September 2017|date=16 December 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910083329/https://www.democraticunderground.com/10021998000|archivedate=10 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate stayed in 9 to 10 range most of the period from 1972 to 1994, before falling to 5 in present times.&lt;ref name="Spierenburg" /&gt; The increase since 1957 would have been even greater if not for the significant improvements in medical techniques and emergency response times, which mean that more and more attempted homicide victims survive. According to one estimate, if the lethality levels of criminal assaults of 1964 still applied in 1993, the country would have seen the murder rate of around 26 per 100,000, almost triple the actually observed rate of 9.5 per 100,000.&lt;ref name="harristhomas"/&gt;

[[File:Historical homicide rate in Stockholm.svg|thumb|left|250px|The historical homicide rate in [[Stockholm]] since 1400&amp;nbsp;AD. The murder rate was very high in the [[Middle Ages]]. The rate has declined greatly: from 45 / 100,000 to a low of 0.6 in the 1950s. The last decades have seen the homicide rate rise slowly.]]
A similar, but less pronounced pattern has been seen in major European countries as well. The murder rate in the United Kingdom fell to 1 per 100,000 by the beginning of the 20th century and as low as 0.62 per 100,000 in 1960, and was at 1.28 per 100,000 {{as of|lc=y|2009}}. The murder rate in France (excluding Corsica) bottomed out after World War II at less than 0.4 per 100,000, quadrupling to 1.6 per 100,000 since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cjrc.osu.edu/researchprojects/hvd/AHSV/tables/AHSV%20European%20Homicides.pdf|title=American Homicide Supplemental Volume (AHSV), European Homicides (EH)|author=Randolph Roth|date=October 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100629054202/http://cjrc.osu.edu/researchprojects/hvd/AHSV/tables/AHSV%20European%20Homicides.pdf|archivedate=2010-06-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The specific factors driving this dynamics in murder rates are complex and not universally agreed upon. Much of the raise in the U.S. murder rate during the first half of the 20th century is generally thought to be attributed to gang violence associated with [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]]. Since most murders are committed by young males, the near simultaneous low in the murder rates of major developed countries circa 1960 can be attributed to low birth rates during the Great Depression and World War II. Causes of further moves are more controversial. Some of the more exotic factors claimed to affect murder rates include the availability of abortion&lt;ref&gt;"Freakonomics", Steven D. Levitt, Stephen J. Dubner, 2005, {{ISBN|0-06-073132-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the likelihood of chronic exposure to [[lead poisoning#Nervous system|lead]] during childhood (due to the use of leaded paint in houses and [[tetraethyllead]] as a gasoline additive in internal combustion engines).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Natural resource management''' refers to the management of [[natural resource]]s such as [[Land (economics)|land]], [[water]], [[soil]], [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s, with a particular focus on how management affects the [[quality of life]] for both present and future generations ([[stewardship]]).

Natural resource management deals with managing the way in which people and natural [[landscapes]] interact. It brings together land use planning, water management, [[Conservation biology|biodiversity conservation]], and the future sustainability of industries like [[agriculture]], [[mining]], [[tourism]], [[fisheries]] and [[forestry]]. It recognises that people and their livelihoods rely on the health and productivity of our landscapes, and their actions as stewards of the land play a critical role in maintaining this health and productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nrc.nsw.gov.au/content/documents/Brochure%20-%20Resilient%20landscapes.pdf|format=PDF|title=Resilient landscapes and communities  managing natural resources in New South Wales|publisher=Nrc.nsw.gov.au|accessdate=27 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208173746/http://www.nrc.nsw.gov.au/content/documents/Brochure%20-%20Resilient%20landscapes.pdf|archivedate=8 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural resource management specifically focuses on a scientific and technical understanding of resources and [[ecology]] and the life-supporting capacity of those resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Massey University|url=http://study.massey.ac.nz/massey/students/studymassey/programme.cfm?major_code=2261&amp;prog_code=93013|title=Bachelor of Applied Science (Natural Resource Management)|accessdate=27 October 2014}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Environmental management]] is also similar to natural resource management. In academic contexts, the [[Rural sociology|sociology of natural resources]] is closely related to, but distinct from, natural resource management.

==History==
[[File:US-DOI-BureauOfLandManagement-Logo.svg|thumb|right|135px|The [[Bureau of Land Management]] in the United States manages America's [[public land]]s, totaling approximately 264 million acres (1,070,000 km2) or one-eighth of the landmass of the country.]]

The emphasis on sustainability can be traced back to early attempts to understand the ecological nature of [[North America]]n [[rangeland]]s in the late 19th century, and the [[Conservation movement|resource conservation]] movement of the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Berkeley University of California: Geography: [http://geography.berkeley.edu/programcourses/CoursePagesSP2006/Geog175Rangelands/Geog175syllabus.pdf Geog 175: Topics in the History of Natural Resource Management: Spring 2006: Rangelands] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611112307/http://geography.berkeley.edu/ProgramCourses/CoursePagesSP2006/Geog175Rangelands/Geog175syllabus.pdf |date=11 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;San Francisco State University: Department of Geography: GEOG 657/ENVS 657:  Natural Resource Management:  Biotic Resources: [http://bss.sfsu.edu/holzman/courses/GEOG%20657/env%20history%20lecture.pdf Natural Resource Management and Environmental History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217101744/http://bss.sfsu.edu/holzman/courses/GEOG%20657/env%20history%20lecture.pdf |date=17 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This type of analysis coalesced in the 20th century with recognition that preservationist [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] strategies had not been effective in halting the decline of natural resources. A more integrated approach was implemented recognising the intertwined social, cultural, economic and political aspects of resource management.&lt;ref name="Thakadu2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Thakadu |first=O. T. |year=2005 |title=Success factors in community based natural resources management in northern Botswana: Lessons from practice |journal=Natural Resources Forum |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=199–212 |doi=10.1111/j.1477-8947.2005.00130.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; A more holistic, national and even global form evolved, from the [[Brundtland Commission]] and the advocacy of [[sustainable development]].

In 2005 the government of [[New South Wales]], established a ''Standard for Quality Natural Resource Management'',&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;NSW Government 2005, Standard for Quality Natural Resource Management, NSW Natural Resources Commission, Sydney&lt;/ref&gt; to improve the consistency of practice, based on an [[adaptive management]] approach.

In the [[United States]], the most active areas of natural resource management are [[wildlife management]] often associated with [[ecotourism]] and [[rangeland management]]. In [[Australia]], water sharing, such as the [[Murray Darling Basin|Murray Darling Basin Plan]] and [[catchment management]] are also significant.

==Ownership regimes==

Natural resource management approaches can be categorised according to the kind and right of [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]], natural resources:

* State property:  Ownership and control over the use of resources is in hands of the state. Individuals or groups may be able to make use of the resources, but only at the permission of the state. National forest, National parks and military reservations are some US  examples.

* Private property: Any property owned by a defined individual or corporate entity. Both the benefit and duties to the resources fall to the owner(s). Private land is the most common example.

* Common property: It is a private property of a group. The group may vary in size, nature and internal structure e.g. indigenous neighbours of village. Some examples of common property are community forests.

* Non-property (open access): There is no definite owner of these properties. Each potential user has equal ability to use it as they wish. These areas are the most exploited. It is said that "Everybody's property is nobody's property". An example is a lake fishery. [[Common land]] may exist without ownership, in which case in the UK it is vested in a local authority.

* Hybrid: Many ownership regimes governing natural resources will contain parts of more than one of the regimes described above, so natural resource managers need to consider the impact of hybrid regimes. An example of such a hybrid is native vegetation management in NSW, Australia, where legislation recognises a public interest in the preservation of native vegetation, but where most native vegetation exists on private land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/vegetation/nvact.htm|title=Native Vegetation Act 2003|publisher=Environment.nsw.gov.au|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stakeholder analysis==

[[Stakeholder analysis]] originated from business management practices and has been incorporated into [[natural resource]] management in ever growing popularity. Stakeholder analysis in the context of natural resource management identifies distinctive interest groups affected in the utilisation and conservation of natural resources.&lt;ref name="Dandy"&gt;Dandy, N. et al. (2009) ‘Who's in and why? A typology of stakeholder analysis methods for natural resource management,’ Journal of Environmental Management, vol. 90, pp. 1933–1949&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no definitive definition of a stakeholder as illustrated in the table below. Especially in natural resource management as it is difficult to determine who has a stake and this will differ according to each potential stakeholder.&lt;ref name="Billgrena"&gt;Billgrena, C., Holme, H. (2008) ‘Approaching reality: Comparing stakeholder analysis and cultural theory in the context of natural resource management,’ Land Use Policy, vol. 25, pp. 550–562&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, it is dependent upon the circumstances of the stakeholders involved with natural resource as to which definition and subsequent theory is utilised.

Billgrena and Holme&lt;ref name="Billgrena" /&gt; identified the aims of stakeholder analysis in natural resource management:

*Identify and categorise the stakeholders that may have influence
*Develop an understanding of why changes occur
*Establish who can make changes happen
*How to best manage natural resources

This gives transparency and clarity to policy making allowing stakeholders to recognise conflicts of interest and facilitate resolutions.&lt;ref name="Billgrena" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grimble"&gt;{{cite book|author=Grimble, R|date=1998|title=Stakeholder methodologies in natural resource management, Socioeconomic Methodologies|publisher=Chatham: Natural Resources Institute|pages=1–12|url=http://www.nri.org/old/publications/bpg/bpg02.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=27 October 2014}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are numerous stakeholder theories such as Mitchell et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mitchell, R. K.|date=1997|title=TOWARD A THEORY OF STAKEHOLDER IDENTIFICATION AND SALIENCE: DEFINING THE PRINCIPLE OF WHO AND WHAT REALLY COUNTS|publisher=Academy of Management Review|volume=22|number=4|pages=853–886|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; however Grimble&lt;ref name="Grimble" /&gt; created a framework of stages for a Stakeholder Analysis in natural resource management. Grimble&lt;ref name="Grimble" /&gt;  designed this framework to ensure that the analysis is specific to the essential aspects of natural resource management.

'''Stages in Stakeholder analysis:'''&lt;ref name="Grimble" /&gt;
#        Clarify objectives of the analysis
#       Place issues in a systems context
#        Identify decision-makers and stakeholders
#         Investigate stakeholder interests and agendas
#           Investigate patterns of inter-action and dependence  (e.g. conflicts and compatibilities, trade-offs and synergies)

'''Application:'''

Grimble and Wellard&lt;ref name="GrimbleWellard" /&gt; established that Stakeholder analysis in natural resource management is most relevant where issued can be characterised as;

*	Cross-cutting systems and stakeholder interests
*	Multiple uses and users of the resource.
*	[[Market failure]]
*	[[Subtractability]] and temporal trade-offs
*	Unclear or [[open-access]] [[property rights]]
*	Untraded products and services
*	[[Poverty]] and under-representation&lt;ref name="GrimbleWellard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grimble" /&gt;

'''Case studies:'''

In the case of the [[Bwindi Impenetrable National Park]], a comprehensive stakeholder analysis would have been relevant and the Batwa people would have potentially been acknowledged as stakeholders preventing the loss of people's livelihoods and loss of life.&lt;ref name="GrimbleWellard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grimble" /&gt;

Nepal, Indonesia and Koreas' [[community forestry#5Best Practices|community forestry]] are successful examples of how stakeholder analysis can be incorporated into the management of natural resources. This allowed the stakeholders to identify their needs and level of involvement with the forests.

'''Criticisms:'''

*	Natural resource management stakeholder analysis tends to include too many stakeholders which can create problems in of its self as suggested by Clarkson. ‘‘Stakeholder theory should not be used to weave a basket big enough to hold the world's misery.’’&lt;ref&gt;Clarkson, M.B.E. (1994) A risk based model of stakeholder theory. Toronto: Working Paper, University of Toronto, pp.10&lt;/ref&gt;
*	Starik&lt;ref&gt;Starik, M. (1995) ‘Should trees have managerial standing? Toward stakeholder status for non-human nature,’ Journal of Business Ethics, vol. 14, pp. 207–217&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that nature needs to be represented as stakeholder. However this has been rejected by many scholars as it would be difficult to find appropriate representation and this representation could also be disputed by other stakeholders causing further issues.&lt;ref name="Billgrena" /&gt;
*	Stakeholder analysis can be used exploited and abused in order to marginalise other stakeholders.&lt;ref name="Dandy" /&gt;
*	Identifying the relevant stakeholders for participatory processes is complex as certain stakeholder groups may have been excluded from previous decisions.&lt;ref name="Prell"&gt;Prell, C., et al. (2007) Stakeholder Analysis and Social Network Analysis in Natural Resource Management. Leeds: Sustainability Research Institute, University of Leeds, pp. 1-21&lt;/ref&gt;
*	On-going conflicts and lack of trust between stakeholders can prevent compromise and resolutions.&lt;ref name="Prell" /&gt;

'''Alternatives/ Complementary forms of analysis:'''

*	[[Social network analysis]]
*	[[Common pool resource]]

==Management of the resources==

Natural resource management issues are inherently complex. They involve the ecological cycles, hydrological cycles, climate, animals, plants and geography, etc. All these are dynamic and inter-related. A change in one of them may have far reaching and/or long term impacts which may even be irreversible. In addition to the natural systems, natural resource management also has to manage various stakeholders and their interests, policies, politics, geographical boundaries, economic implications and the list goes on. It is a very difficult to satisfy all aspects at the same time. This results in conflicting situations.

After the United Nations Conference for the Environment and Development (UNCED) held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, most nations subscribed to new principles for the integrated management of land, water, and forests. Although program names vary from nation to nation, all express similar aims.

The various approaches applied to natural resource management include:

* Top-down (command and control)
* Community-based natural resource management
* [[Adaptive]] management
* Precautionary approach
* Integrated natural resource management

=== Community-based natural resource management ===

The community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) approach combines conservation objectives with the generation of economic benefits for rural communities. The three key assumptions being that: locals are better placed to conserve natural resources, people will conserve a resource only if benefits exceed the costs of conservation, and people will conserve a resource that is linked directly to their quality of life.&lt;ref name="Thakadu2005" /&gt; When a local people's quality of life is enhanced, their efforts and commitment to ensure the future well-being of the resource are also enhanced.&lt;ref&gt;Ostrom, E,  Schroeder, L and Wynne, S 1993. Institutional incentives and sustainable development: infrastructure policies in perspective. Westview Press. Oxford, UK. 266 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Regional and community based natural resource management is also based on the principle of [[subsidiarity]].

The United Nations advocates CBNRM in the Convention on Biodiversity and the Convention to Combat Desertification. Unless clearly defined, decentralised NRM can result an ambiguous socio-legal environment with local communities racing to exploit natural resources while they can e.g. forest communities in central Kalimantan (Indonesia).&lt;ref&gt;Bartley, T Andersson, K, Jager P and Van Laerhoven 2008 The contribution of Institutional Theories for explaining [[Decentralization]] of Natural Resource Governance. Society and Natural Resources, 21:160-174 {{doi|10.1080/08941920701617973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A problem of CBNRM is the difficulty of reconciling and harmonising the objectives of socioeconomic development, biodiversity protection and sustainable resource utilisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kellert, S|author2=Mehta, J|author3=Ebbin, S|author4=Litchtenfeld, L.|date=2000|title=Community natural resource management: promise, rhetoric, and reality|publisher=Society and Natural Resources, 13:705-715|url=http://biologicalcapital.com/art/Article-%20Community%20Natural%20Resource%20Management.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=27 October 2014}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept and conflicting interests of CBNRM,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Brosius, J.|author2=Peter Tsing|author3=Anna Lowenhaupt|author4=Zerner, Charles|date=1998 |title=Representing communities: Histories and politics of community-based natural resource management |journal=Society &amp; Natural Resources|publisher=Society &amp; Natural Resources: An International Journal |volume=11 |issue=2|pages=157–168|url=http://www.informaworld.com/10.1080/08941929809381069|accessdate=27 October 2014|doi=10.1080/08941929809381069}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Twyman, C 2000.

Understanding power relations is crucial to the success of community based NRM. Locals may be reluctant to challenge government recommendations for fear of losing promised benefits.

CBNRM is based particularly on advocacy by nongovernmental organizations working with local groups and communities, on the one hand, and national and transnational organizations, on the other, to build and extend new versions of environmental and social advocacy that link social justice and environmental management agendas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Shackleton, S|author2=Campbell, B|author3=Wollenberg, E|author4=Edmunds, D.|date=March 2002|title=Devolution and community-based natural resource management: creating space for local people to participate and benefit? |publisher=ODI, Natural Resource Perspectives|number=76|url=http://dlc.dlib.indiana.edu/dlc/bitstream/handle/10535/3646/76-devolution-community-based-natural-resource-management.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with both direct and indirect benefits observed including a share of revenues, employment, diversification of livelihoods and increased pride and identity.

Caring for our Country is an Australian Government initiative jointly administered by the Australian Government Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts. These Departments share responsibility for delivery of the Australian Government's environment and sustainable agriculture programs, which have traditionally been broadly referred to under the banner of ‘natural resource management’. These programs have been delivered regionally, through 56 State government bodies, successfully allowing regional communities to decide the natural resource priorities for their regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nrc.nsw.gov.au/content/documents/2010%20Progress%20report.pdf|title=PROGRESS TOWARDS HEALTHY RESILIENT LANDSCAPES IMPLEMENTING THE STANDARD, TARGETS AND CATCHMENT ACTION PLANS|publisher=Nrc.nsw.gov.au|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110217095859/http://nrc.nsw.gov.au/content/documents/2010%20Progress%20report.pdf|archivedate=17 February 2011|deadurl=yes|accessdate=27 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More broadly, a research study based in Tanzania and the Pacific researched what motivates communities to adopt CBNRM's and found that aspects of the specific CBNRM program, of the community that has adopted the program, and of the broader social-ecological context together shape the why CBNRM's are adopted&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mascia|first=Michael B.|last2=Mills|first2=Morena|title=When conservation goes viral: The diffusion of innovative biodiversity conservation policies and practices|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/conl.12442/abstract|journal=Conservation Letters|language=en|pages=n/a–n/a|doi=10.1111/conl.12442|issn=1755-263X}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Governance is seen as a key consideration for delivering community-based or regional natural resource management. In the State of NSW, the 13 [[Catchment Management Authority of (New South Wales)|catchment management authorities]] (CMAs) are overseen by the [http://nrc.nsw.gov.au/ Natural Resources Commission] (NRC), responsible for undertaking audits of the effectiveness of regional natural resource management programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/viewtop/inforce/act+102+2003+cd+0+N/?autoquery=%28Content%3D%28%28%22natural%22%20OR%20%22resources%22%20OR%20%22commission%22%29%29%29%20AND%20%28%28Type%3D%22act%22%20AND%20Repealed%3D%22N%22%29%20OR%20%28Type%3D%22subordleg%22%20AND%20Repealed%3D%22N%22%29%29&amp;dq=Document%20Types%3D%22Acts,%20Regs%22,%20Any%20Words%3D%22natural%20resources%20commission%22,%20Search%20In%3D%22Text%22&amp;fullquery=%28%28%28%22natural%22%20OR%20%22resources%22%20OR%20%22commission%22%29%29%29|title=NSW Legislation|publisher=Legislation.nsw.gov.au|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adaptive management===
The primary methodological approach adopted by [[Catchment Management Authority (New South Wales)|catchment management authorities]] (CMAs) for regional natural resource management in Australia is [[adaptive management]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

This approach includes recognition that adaption occurs through a process of ‘plan-do-review-act’. It also recognises seven key components that should be considered for quality natural resource management practice:
*	Determination of scale
*	Collection and use of knowledge
*	[[Information management]]
*	Monitoring and evaluation
*	[[Risk management]]
*	[[Community engagement]]
*	Opportunities for [[collaboration]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=== Integrated natural resource management ===
Integrated natural resource management (INRM) is a process of managing natural resources in a systematic way, which includes multiple aspects of natural resource use (biophysical, socio-political, and economic) meet production goals of producers and other direct users (e.g., food security, profitability, risk aversion) as well as goals of the wider community (e.g., poverty alleviation, welfare of future generations, environmental conservation). It focuses on sustainability and at the same time tries to incorporate all possible stakeholders from the planning level itself, reducing possible future conflicts. The conceptual basis of INRM has evolved in recent years through the convergence of research in diverse areas such as sustainable land use, participatory planning, integrated watershed management, and adaptive management.&lt;ref name="Conservation Ecology 52: 25"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lovell, C.|author2=Mandondo A.|author3=Moriarty P.|date=2002|title=The question of scale in integrated natural resource management|publisher=Conservation Ecology 5(2): 25|url=http://www.consecol.org/vol5/iss2/art25/|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Holling C.S pages 328"&gt;Holling C.S. and Meffe, G.

==Frameworks and modelling==
There are various frameworks and computer models developed to assist natural resource management.

'''Geographic Information Systems (GIS)'''

[[GIS]] is a powerful analytical tool as it is capable of overlaying datasets to identify links. A bush regeneration scheme can be informed by the overlay of rainfall, cleared land and erosion.&lt;ref&gt;Harding R., 1998, Environmental Decision-Making: The Role of Scientists, Engineers and the Public, Federation Press, Leichhardt. pp366.&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, Metadata Directories such as NDAR provide data on Australian natural resources such as vegetation, fisheries, soils and water.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, C and Attwater, R (1996) Usage of, and demand for Environmental Statistics in Australia, in Tracking Progress: Linking Environment and Economy Through Indicators and Accounting Systems Conference Papers, 1996 Australian Academy of Science Fenner Conference on the Environment, Institute of Environmental Studies, UNSW, Sydney, 30 September to 3 October 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; These are limited by the potential for subjective input and data manipulation.

'''Natural Resources Management Audit Frameworks'''

The NSW Government in Australia has published an audit framework&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrc.nsw.gov.au/content/documents/Audit%20framework.pdf|format=PDF|title=Framework for Auditing the  Implementation of Catchment Action Plans|publisher=Nrc.nsw.gov.au|accessdate=27 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140621122515/http://www.nrc.nsw.gov.au/content/documents/Audit%20framework.pdf|archivedate=21 June 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for natural resource management, to assist the establishment of a performance audit role in the governance of regional natural resource management. This audit framework builds from other established audit methodologies, including [[performance audit]], [[environmental audit]] and [[internal audit]]. Audits undertaken using this framework have provided confidence to stakeholders, identified areas for improvement and described policy expectations for the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrc.nsw.gov.au/content/documents/Audit%20report%20-%20Murray%202010.pdf|format=PDF|title=MURRAY CATCHMENT MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY : Audit Report|publisher=Nrc.nsw.gov.au|accessdate=27 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140621120858/http://www.nrc.nsw.gov.au/content/documents/Audit%20report%20-%20Murray%202010.pdf|archivedate=21 June 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://riskaudit.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Nature-audit-NZ-Accountants-Journal-March-2010.pdf|format=PDF|title=Nature Audit|publisher=Nrc.nsw.gov.au|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian Government has established a framework for auditing greenhouse emissions and energy reporting, which closely follows Australian Standards for Assurance Engagements.

The Australian Government is also currently preparing an audit framework for auditing water management, focussing on the implementation of the Murray Darling Basin Plan.

==Other elements==
;Biodiversity Conservation

The issue of biodiversity conservation is regarded as an important element in natural resource management. What is biodiversity? Biodiversity is a comprehensive concept, which is a description of the extent of natural diversity. Gaston and Spicer&lt;ref&gt;Gaston, KJ &amp; Spicer, JI 2004, Biodiversity: An Introduction, Blackwell Publishing Company, Malden.&lt;/ref&gt; (p.&amp;nbsp;3) point out that biodiversity is "the variety of life" and relate to different kinds of "biodiversity organization". According to Gray&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gray, JS|date=1997|title=Marine biodiversity: patterns, threats and conservation needs|url=http://bolt.lakeheadu.ca/~bpaynewww/CMR/marinebiod.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=27 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721172744/http://bolt.lakeheadu.ca/~bpaynewww/CMR/marinebiod.pdf|archive-date=21 July 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; (p.&amp;nbsp;154), the first widespread use of the definition of biodiversity, was put forward by the United Nations in 1992, involving different aspects of biological diversity.

;Precautionary Biodiversity Management

The "threats" wreaking havoc on biodiversity include; [[habitat fragmentation]], putting a strain on the already stretched biological resources; forest deterioration and deforestation; the invasion of "alien species" and "climate change"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cooney, R|date=2004|title=The Precautionary Principle in Biodiversity Conservation and Natural Resource Management|publisher=IUCN Policy and Global Change Series|number=2|url=http://pprinciple.net/publications/PrecautionaryPrincipleissuespaper.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=27 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100509063720/http://www.pprinciple.net/publications/PrecautionaryPrincipleissuespaper.pdf|archive-date=9 May 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;( p.&amp;nbsp;2). Since these threats have received increasing attention from environmentalists and the public, the precautionary management of biodiversity becomes an important part of natural resources management. According to Cooney, there are material measures to carry out precautionary management of biodiversity in natural resource management.

;Concrete "policy tools"

Cooney claims that the policy making is dependent on "evidences", relating to "high standard of proof", the forbidding of special "activities" and "information and monitoring requirements". Before making the policy of precaution, categorical evidence is needed. When the potential menace of "activities" is regarded as a critical and "irreversible" endangerment, these "activities" should be forbidden. For example, since explosives and toxicants will have serious consequences to endanger human and natural environment, the South Africa Marine Living Resources Act promulgated a series of policies on completely forbidding to "catch fish" by using explosives and toxicants.

;Administration and guidelines

According to Cooney, there are 4 methods to manage the precaution of biodiversity in natural resources management;

# "[[Ecosystem-based management]]" including "more risk-averse and precautionary management", where "given prevailing uncertainty regarding ecosystem structure, function, and inter-specific interactions, precaution demands an ecosystem rather than single-species approach to management".
# "[[Adaptive management]]" is "a management approach that expressly tackles the uncertainty and dynamism of complex systems".
# "[[Environmental impact assessment]]" and exposure ratings decrease the "uncertainties" of precaution, even though it has deficiencies, and
# "Protectionist approaches", which "most frequently links to" biodiversity conservation in natural resources management.

;Land management

In order to have a sustainable environment, understanding and using appropriate management strategies is important. In terms of understanding, Young&lt;ref&gt;Young, A 1998, Land resources: now and for the future, Cambridge University Press, UK&lt;/ref&gt; emphasises some important points of land management:

* Comprehending the processes of nature including ecosystem, water, soils
* Using appropriate and adapting management systems in local situations
* Cooperation between scientists who have knowledge and resources and local people who have knowledge and skills

Dale et al. (2000)&lt;ref&gt;Dale, VH, Brown, S, Hawuber, RA, Hobbs, NT, Huntly, Nj Naiman, RJ, Riebsame, WE, Turner, MG &amp; Valone, TJ 2000, ‘Ecological guidelines for land use and management’, in Dale, VH &amp; Hawuber, RA (eds), Applying ecological principles to land management, Springer-Verlag, NY&lt;/ref&gt; study has shown that there are five fundamental and helpful ecological principles for the land manager and people who need them. The ecological principles relate to time, place, species, disturbance and the landscape and they interact in many ways.It is suggested that land managers could follow these guidelines:

* Examine impacts of local decisions in a regional context, and the effects on natural resources.
* Plan for long-term change and unexpected events.
* Preserve rare landscape elements and associated species.
* Avoid land uses that deplete natural resources.
* Retain large contiguous or connected areas that contain critical habitats.
* Minimize the introduction and spread of non-native species.
* Avoid or compensate for the effects of development on ecological processes.
* Implement land-use and land-management practices that are compatible with the natural potential of the area.

'''''Non bis in idem''''', which translates literally from [[Latin]] as "not twice in the same [thing]", is a legal doctrine to the effect that no legal action can be instituted twice for the same cause of action. It is a legal concept originating in [[Roman law|Roman civil law]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buckland|first=W.W.|title=A Text-book of Roman Law from Augustus to Justinian|edition=3|date=1963|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge UP| pages=695–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is essentially the equivalent of the [[double jeopardy]] (''autrefois acquit'') doctrine found in [[common law]] jurisdictions.

The [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] guarantees the right to be free from double jeopardy; however, it does not apply to prosecutions by two different sovereigns&lt;ref&gt;For example, see A.P. v Italy, UN HRC CCPR/C/31/D/204/1986&lt;/ref&gt; (unless the relevant [[extradition treaty]] expresses a prohibition). The [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] creates a different form of ''non bis in idem''.

==  Rome Statute and ''ad hoc'' UN tribunals ==

The [[Rome Statute]] establishing the International Criminal Court (ICC) states that the ''non bis in idem'' principle has a peculiar meaning, especially in comparison to European supranational law. The ICC jurisdiction is complementary to national law, and Article 20 of the Rome Statute specifies that even if the principle remains in general terms, it cannot be taken in consideration if there is unwillingness or incapability of the existence of the supranational court's jurisdiction.
Article 10 of the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|ICTY]] Statute and Article 9 of the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda|ICTR]] Statute both state that the principle can be enforced mainly to clarify that the ''ad hoc'' tribunal's sentences are "stronger" than the ones in domestic courts.

In other words, national courts cannot proceed against the responsible parties of crimes within the tribunal's jurisdiction if the international tribunal has already pronounced sentence for the same crimes.  However, the ICTY and the ICTR can judge alleged criminals already sentenced by national courts if both of the following occur:
*the sentence defined the crimes as "ordinary".
*the judiciary of the state is not considered impartial or the domestic trial is considered to be a pretense to protect the accused from the legal action of international justice or is considered to be unfair on some fundamental legal basis.

The '''psychology of programming''' ('''PoP''') is the field of research that deals with the [[psychological]] aspects of writing [[Computer program|program]]s (often [[computer]] programs). The field has also been called the '''''empirical studies of programming''''' ('''ESP'''). It covers research into computer programmers' cognition; tools and methods for programming-related activities; and programming education.

Psychologically, computer programming is a human activity which involves [[cognition]]s such as [[Reading (process)|reading]] and [[writing]] [[computer language]], [[learning]], [[problem solving]], and [[reasoning]].

==History==
The history of psychology of programming dates back to late 1970s and early 1980s, when researchers realized that computational power should not be the only thing to be evaluated in programming tools and technologies, but also the usability from the users.&lt;ref&gt;Jorma Sajaniemi. Psychology of Programming: Looking into Programmers’ Heads. Human Technology [Internet]. 2008 May 4–8 [cited 2012 Oct 4]; 4(1): Available from: http://www.humantechnology.jyu.fi/articles/volume4/2008/ge-sajaniemi.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In the first Workshop on Empirical Studies of Programmers, [[Ben Shneiderman]] listed several important destinations for researchers. These destinations include refining the use of current languages, improving present and future languages, developing special purpose languages, and improving tools and methods. Two important workshop series have been devoted to psychology of programming in the last two decades: the Workshop on Empirical Studies of Programmers (ESP), based primarily in the US, and the Psychology of Programming Interest Group Workshop (PPIG), having a European character. ESP has a broader scope than pure psychology in programming, and on the other hand, PPIG is more focused in the field of PoP. However, PPIG workshops and the organization PPIG itself is informal in nature, It is group of people who are interested in PoP that comes together and publish their discussions.

==Goals and purposes==
It is desirable to achieve a programming performance such that creating a program meets its specifications, is on schedule, is adaptable for the future and runs efficiently.&lt;ref name="weinberg"&gt;{{Citation |last=Weinberg |first=Gerald M. |authorlink=Gerald Weinberg |title=The Psychology of Computer Programming |place=New York |publisher=Dorset House |year=1998 |edition=Silver |url=https://leanpub.com/thepsychologyofcomputerprogramming |isbn=0-932633-42-0 |format=&lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=author:Weinberg+intitle:The+Psychology+of+Computer+Programming]&lt;/sup&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being able to satisfy all these goals at a low cost is a difficult and common problem in software engineering and project management. By understanding the psychological aspects of computer programming, we can better understand how to achieve a higher programming performance, and to assist programmers to produce better software with less error.

==Research methods==
Some methods which one can use to study the psychological aspects of computer programming include [[introspection]], [[observation]], [[experiment]], and [[qualitative research]].&lt;ref name="weinberg"/&gt;

Blaine]] finally gained the [[1884 Republican National Convention|1884 Republican nomination for U.S. president]], in his third attempt – "Another victory like this and our money's gone!"]] 
A '''Pyrrhic victory''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Pyrrhic victory.ogg|ˈ|p|ɪr|ɪ|k|}} {{respell|PIRR|ik}}) is a victory that inflicts such a devastating toll on the victor that it is tantamount to defeat. Someone who wins a Pyrrhic victory has also taken a heavy toll that negates any true sense of achievement.   

==Etymology==

''Pyrrhic victory'' is named after King [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]] of [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]], whose army suffered irreplaceable casualties in defeating the [[Roman Republic|Romans]] at the [[Battle of Heraclea]] in 280 BC and the [[Battle of Asculum]] in 279 BC, during the [[Pyrrhic War]]. After the latter battle, [[Plutarch]] relates in a report by [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus|Dionysius]]:

{{quote|The armies separated; and, it is said, Pyrrhus replied to one that gave him joy of his victory that ''one other such victory would utterly undo him''. For he had lost a great part of the forces he brought with him, and almost all his particular friends and principal commanders; there were no others there to make recruits, and he found the confederates in Italy backward. On the other hand, as from a fountain continually flowing out of the city, the Roman camp was quickly and plentifully filled up with fresh men, not at all abating in courage for the loss they sustained, but even from their very anger gaining new force and resolution to go on with the war.|Plutarch, [[Parallel Lives|Life of Pyrrhus]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]] (trans. John Dryden) ''[http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/pyrrhus.html Pyrrhus]'', hosted on [http://classics.mit.edu The Internet Classics Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In both Epirote victories, the Romans suffered greater casualties but they had a much larger pool of replacements, so the casualties had less impact on the Roman war effort than the losses of King Pyrrhus.

The report is often quoted as
{{quote|text=''Ne ego si iterum eodem modo uicero, sine ullo milite Epirum reuertar.''&lt;br&gt;
Another such victory and I come back to Epirus alone.|source=[[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/orosius/orosius4.shtml#1 Historiarum Adversum Paganos Libri]'', IV, 1.15.&lt;/ref&gt;}} 
or 
{{quote|text=If we are victorious in one more battle with the Romans, we shall be utterly ruined.|source=

Ironically enough, it can never fairly be said that Pyrrhus of Epirus ever incurred such a "victory", having handily defeated the Romans in each of their engagements by a large margin,  all the while suffering substantially fewer casualties (see, for example, the [[Battle of Heraclea]]). The term entered the English vernacular due to popular misconceptions of the magnitude of Pyrrhus's losses: beginning before the 1800s, Latin history teaching books said that Pyrrhus suffered losses in the tens of thousands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Study_of_History_Rendered_Easy_by_a.html?id=tklHMwEACAAJ | title = The Study of History Rendered Easy, by a Plan Founded on Experience | first1 = Ann | last1 = Fletcher | first2 = S. | last2 = Dutton | first3 = H.F. | last3 = Dutton | publisher = University of St. Andrews | year = 1798}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Battle of Asculum]] (279 BC),&lt;ref name=Plutarch/&gt; [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]] and Italian allies against the [[Roman Empire|Romans]]: the Romans, though suffering twice as many casualties, could easily replenish their ranks. Pyrrhus lost most of his commanders and a great part of the forces he had brought to Italy, and he withdrew to Sicily.

The French army withdrew in good order and relatively intact, and it remained a potent threat to further Allied operations.

Lee]] split his army in the face of Hooker's larger Union force; the audacious strategy allowed the Confederate army to win the day against a numerically superior foe. However, 20% of Lee's army was injured or killed, including General [[Stonewall Jackson]], and his losses were difficult to replace. Lee's weakened army went on the offensive, but less than two months later was defeated and forced to retreat after the [[Battle of Gettysburg]].

This last one, although a victory, unfortunately, was not an overwhelming victory." Naval victories are usually counted in ships lost but given the destruction of the cream of the Japanese Navy’s aircrews, it could even be argued that, in the case of the ''Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands'', the Japanese came off worst. Reporting several weeks after the battle, Nimitz too correctly calibrated the result of the battle: "This battle cost us the lives of many gallant men, many planes and two ships that could ill be spared... We nevertheless turned back the Japanese again in their offensive to regain ''Guadalcanal'' and shattered their carrier air strength on the eve on the critical days of mid-November.

After an exchange of carrier air attacks, U.S. surface ships retreated with one carrier sunk and another severely damaged. The Japanese carrier forces achieved a tactical victory, as none of their ships were sunk, but the heavy loss of irreplaceable veteran aircrews was to the strategic advantage of the Allies.

The '''Rashomon effect''' occurs when the same event is given contradictory interpretations by different individuals involved. The effect is named after [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s 1950 film ''[[Rashomon]]'', in which a murder is described in four mutually contradictory ways by its four witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davenport|first=Christian|title=Media Bias, Perspective, and State Repression: The Black Panther Party | year=2010 | location = Cambridge, UK | publisher=Cambridge University Press | isbn=9780521759700 | pages=52–73, esp. 55 | chapter=Rashomon Effect, Observation, and Data Generation}}&lt;/ref&gt; More broadly, the term addresses the motivations, mechanism, and occurrences of the reporting on the circumstance, and so addresses contested interpretations of events, the existence of disagreements regarding the evidence of events, and the subjects of subjectivity versus objectivity in human perception, memory, and reporting.

The Rashomon effect has been defined in a modern academic context (from Robert Anderson, in 2016), as "the naming of an [[Epistemology|epistemological]] framework—or ways of thinking, knowing, and remembering—required for understanding complex and ambiguous situations."&lt;ref name = AndersonCJC2016&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Robert|date=2016|title=The Rashomon Effect and Communication|url=|journal=Canadian Journal of Communication|location=Vancouver Canada|issue=41(2)|pages=250–265|doi=|issn=0705-3657|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term for the effect is derived from the eponymous film, Kurosawa's ''Rashomon,'' in which a number of factors are at play, simultaneously, leading the same academic to comment:{{quote|[T]he Rashomon effect is not only about differences in perspective. It occurs particularly where such differences arise in combination with the absence of evidence to elevate or disqualify any version of the truth, plus the social pressure for closure on the question.&lt;ref name = AndersonCJC2016/&gt;}}

==History==
There are varying claims made regarding the coining of this term, but a reliable statement of the earliest use of the term "Rashomon effect" comes from 2015 testimony of Robert Anderson, professor of communication at [[Simon Fraser University]] in [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, Canada, who states that,{{quote|

My own understanding of its origins arises much earlier, upon hearing my respected teacher, [[Nur Yalman]] [as of 2016, an emeritus professor at [[Harvard University]]], say to us in a class in early 1966 at the University of Chicago that 'anthropology's main problem is to deal with the Rashomon effect'. Unlike some graduate students in that room in Chicago, I had seen [[Rashomon|the film [''Rashomon'']]] in 1961 or 1962, so this remark crystalized something… in my memory… I suspect the Rashomon effect has shown up in many historic intellectual undertakings that deal with the contested interpretation of events or with disagreements and evidence for them, or with subjectivity/objectivity, memory and perception. A pertinent example is the long poem called ''The Ring and the Book'' by Robert Browning… published in 1868-9…&lt;ref name = AndersonDAWroutledge15&gt;{{cite book | author = Anderson, Robert | year = 2015 | chapter = What is the Rashomon Effect?

The '''reward system''' is a group of neural structures responsible for [[incentive salience]] (i.e., motivation and "wanting", desire, or craving for a reward), [[associative learning]] (primarily [[positive reinforcement]] and [[classical conditioning]]), and [[Valence (psychology)|positively-valenced]] [[emotion]]s, particularly ones which involve [[pleasure]] as a core component (e.g., [[joy]], [[euphoria]] and [[Ecstasy (emotion)|ecstasy]]).&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pleasure system" /&gt; Reward is the attractive and motivational property of a stimulus that induces appetitive behavior, also known as approach behavior, and consummatory behavior.&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt; In its description of a rewarding stimulus (i.e., "a reward"), a review on reward neuroscience noted, "any stimulus, object, event, activity, or situation that has the potential to make us approach and consume it is by definition a reward."&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt;  In [[operant conditioning]], rewarding stimuli function as [[positive reinforcer]]s;&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt; however, the [[Converse (logic)|converse statement]] also holds true: positive reinforcers are rewarding.&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt;

Primary rewards are a class of rewarding stimuli which facilitate the [[Evolution|survival of one's self and offspring]], and include homeostatic (e.g., [[palatability|palatable food]]) and reproductive (e.g.,  [[Sexual intercourse|sexual contact]] and [[parental investment]]) rewards.&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/94023.php |work=Medical News Today |title=Dopamine Involved In Aggression |date=15 January 2008 |accessdate=14 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intrinsic rewards are unconditioned rewards that are attractive and motivate behavior because they are inherently pleasurable.&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt; Extrinsic rewards (e.g., money or seeing one's favorite sports team winning a game) are conditioned rewards that are attractive and motivate behavior, but are not inherently pleasurable.&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duarte|first=Isabel C.|last2=Afonso|first2=Sónia|last3=Jorge|first3=Helena|last4=Cayolla|first4=Ricardo|last5=Ferreira|first5=Carlos|last6=Castelo-Branco|first6=Miguel|date=1 May 2017|title=Tribal love: the neural correlates of passionate engagement in football fans|url=https://academic.oup.com/scan/article/12/5/718/3051628|journal=Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience|language=en|volume=12|issue=5|pages=718–728|doi=10.1093/scan/nsx003|pmid=28338882|pmc=5460049|issn=1749-5016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extrinsic rewards derive their motivational value as a result of a [[associative learning|learned association]] (i.e., conditioning) with intrinsic rewards.&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt; Extrinsic rewards may also elicit pleasure (e.g., euphoria from winning a lot of money in a lottery) after being [[classical conditioning|classically conditioned]] with intrinsic rewards.&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt;

Survival for most animal species depends upon maximizing contact with beneficial stimuli and minimizing contact with harmful stimuli. Reward cognition serves to increase the likelihood of survival and reproduction by causing associative learning, eliciting approach and consummatory behavior, and triggering [[Valence (psychology)|positively-valenced]] emotions.&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt; Thus, reward is a mechanism that evolved to help increase the adaptive fitness of animals.&lt;ref name="Behavioral neuroscience textbook" /&gt;

== Definition ==

In neuroscience, the reward system is a collection of brain structures and neural pathways that are responsible for reward-related cognition, including [[associative learning]] (primarily [[classical conditioning]] and [[operant reinforcement]]), [[incentive salience]] (i.e., motivation and "wanting", desire, or craving for a reward), and [[Valence (psychology)|positively-valenced]] [[emotion]]s, particularly emotions that involve [[pleasure]] (i.e., hedonic "liking").&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pleasure system" /&gt;

Terms that are commonly used to describe behavior related to the "wanting" or desire component of reward include appetitive behavior, approach behavior, preparatory behavior, instrumental behavior, anticipatory behavior, and seeking.&lt;ref name="Wanting and liking behaviors" /&gt; Terms that are commonly used to describe behavior related to the "liking" or pleasure component of reward include consummatory behavior and taking behavior.&lt;ref name="Wanting and liking behaviors"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Salamone JD, Correa M|title=The Mysterious Motivational Functions of Mesolimbic Dopamine|journal=Neuron|volume=76|issue=3|pages=470–485|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2012.10.021|pmid=23141060|pmc=4450094|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three primary functions of rewards are their capacity to:
#produce [[associative learning]] (i.e., [[classical conditioning]] and [[operant reinforcement]]);&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt;
#affect decision-making and induce approach behavior (via the assignment of [[motivational salience]] to rewarding stimuli);&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt;
#elicit [[Valence (psychology)|positively-valenced]] emotions, particularly pleasure.&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt;

== Anatomy ==

The brain structures that compose the reward system are located primarily within the [[cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop]];&lt;ref name="Striatal efferents, afferents, and colocalized receptors in dMSNs and iMSNs" /&gt; the [[basal ganglia]] portion of the loop drives activity within the reward system.&lt;ref name="Striatal efferents, afferents, and colocalized receptors in dMSNs and iMSNs" /&gt; Most of the pathways that connect structures within the reward system are [[glutamatergic]] [[interneuron]]s, [[GABAergic]] [[medium spiny neuron]]s (MSNs), and [[dopaminergic]] [[projection neuron]]s,&lt;ref name="Striatal efferents, afferents, and colocalized receptors in dMSNs and iMSNs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reward system components and structure-specific functions"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Taylor SB, Lewis CR, Olive MF | title = The neurocircuitry of illicit psychostimulant addiction: acute and chronic effects in humans | journal = Subst Abuse Rehabil | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 29–43 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24648786 | pmc = 3931688 | doi = 10.2147/SAR.S39684 | quote = Regions of the basal ganglia, which include the dorsal and ventral striatum, internal and external segments of the globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus, and dopaminergic cell bodies in the substantia nigra, are highly implicated not only in fine motor control but also in [prefrontal cortex] PFC function.43 Of these regions, the [nucleus accumbens] NAc (described above) and the [dorsal striatum] DS (described below) are most frequently examined with respect to addiction. Thus, only a brief description of the modulatory role of the basal ganglia in addiction-relevant circuits will be mentioned here. The overall output of the basal ganglia is predominantly via the thalamus, which then projects back to the PFC to form cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) loops. Three CSTC loops are proposed to modulate executive function, action selection, and behavioral inhibition. In the dorsolateral prefrontal circuit, the basal ganglia primarily modulate the identification and selection of goals, including rewards.44 The [orbitofrontal cortex] OFC circuit modulates decision-making and impulsivity, and the anterior cingulate circuit modulates the assessment of consequences.44 These circuits are modulated by dopaminergic inputs from the [ventral tegmental area] VTA to ultimately guide behaviors relevant to addiction, including the persistence and narrowing of the behavioral repertoire toward drug seeking, and continued drug use despite negative consequences.43–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; although other types of projection neurons contribute (e.g., [[orexinergic]] projection neurons). The reward system includes the [[ventral tegmental area]], [[ventral striatum]] (i.e., the [[nucleus accumbens]] and [[olfactory tubercle]]), [[dorsal striatum]] (i.e., the [[caudate nucleus]] and [[putamen]]), [[substantia nigra]] (i.e., the [[pars compacta]] and [[pars reticulata]]), [[prefrontal cortex]], [[anterior cingulate cortex]], [[insular cortex]], [[hippocampus]], [[hypothalamus]] (particularly, the [[orexinergic]] nucleus in the [[lateral hypothalamus]]), [[thalamus]] (multiple nuclei), [[subthalamic nucleus]], [[globus pallidus]] (both [[globus pallidus external|external]] and [[globus pallidus internal|internal]]), [[ventral pallidum]], [[parabrachial nucleus]], [[amygdala]], and the remainder of the [[extended amygdala]].&lt;ref name="Pleasure system" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Striatal efferents, afferents, and colocalized receptors in dMSNs and iMSNs"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yager LM, Garcia AF, Wunsch AM, Ferguson SM | title = The ins and outs of the striatum: Role in drug addiction | journal = Neuroscience | volume = 301 | issue = | pages = 529–541 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 26116518 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2015.06.033 | quote = [The striatum] receives dopaminergic inputs from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the substantia nigra (SNr) and glutamatergic inputs from several areas, including the cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamus (Swanson, 1982; Phillipson and Griffiths, 1985; Finch, 1996; Groenewegen et al., 1999; Britt et al., 2012). These glutamatergic inputs make contact on the heads of dendritic spines of the striatal GABAergic medium spiny projection neurons (MSNs) whereas dopaminergic inputs synapse onto the spine neck, allowing for an important and complex interaction between these two inputs in modulation of MSN activity&amp;nbsp;... It should also be noted that there is a small population of neurons in the [nucleus accumbens] NAc that coexpress both D1 and D2 receptors, though this is largely restricted to the NAc shell (Bertran- Gonzalez et al., 2008).&amp;nbsp;... Neurons in the NAc core and NAc shell subdivisions also differ functionally. The NAc core is involved in the processing of conditioned stimuli whereas the NAc shell is more important in the processing of unconditioned stimuli; Classically, these two striatal MSN populations are thought to have opposing effects on basal ganglia output. Activation of the dMSNs causes a net excitation of the thalamus resulting in a positive cortical feedback loop; thereby acting as a 'go’ signal to initiate behavior. Activation of the iMSNs, however, causes a net inhibition of thalamic activity resulting in a negative cortical feedback loop and therefore serves as a 'brake’ to inhibit behavior&amp;nbsp;... there is also mounting evidence that iMSNs play a role in motivation and addiction (Lobo and Nestler, 2011; Grueter et al., 2013). For example, optogenetic activation of NAc core and shell iMSNs suppressed the development of a cocaine CPP whereas selective ablation of NAc core and shell iMSNs&amp;nbsp;... enhanced the development and the persistence of an amphetamine CPP (Durieux et al., 2009; Lobo et al., 2010). These findings suggest that iMSNs can bidirectionally modulate drug reward.&amp;nbsp;... Together these data suggest that iMSNs normally act to restrain drug-taking behavior and recruitment of these neurons may in fact be protective against the development of compulsive drug use. | pmc=4523218}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Review Reward System"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grall-Bronnec M, Sauvaget A | title = The use of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for modulating craving and addictive behaviours: a critical literature review of efficacy, technical and methodological considerations | journal = Neurosci.

Two theories exist with regard to the activity of the nucleus accumbens and the generation liking and wanting.  The inhibition (or hyper&amp;shy;polar&amp;shy;ization) hypothesis proposes that the nucleus accumbens exerts tonic inhibitory effects on downstream structures such as the ventral pallidum, hypothalamus or ventral tegmental area, and that in inhibiting {{abbr|MSNs|medium spiny neurons}} in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), these structures are excited, "releasing" reward related behavior.  While [[GABA receptor]] [[agonist]]s are capable of eliciting both "liking" and "wanting" reactions in the nucleus accumbens, glutaminergic inputs from the [[basolateral amygdala]], ventral hippocampus, and medial prefrontal cortex can drive incentive salience.  Furthermore, while most studies find that NAcc neurons reduce firing in response to reward, a number of studies find the opposite response.

After nearly 50 years of research on brain-stimulation reward, experts have certified that dozens of sites in the brain will maintain [[intracranial self-stimulation]]. Regions include the lateral hypothalamus and medial forebrain bundles, which are especially effective. Stimulation there activates fibers that form the ascending pathways; the ascending pathways include the [[mesolimbic dopamine pathway]], which projects from the ventral tegmental area to the [[nucleus accumbens]]. There are several explanations as to why the mesolimbic dopamine pathway is central to circuits mediating reward. First, there is a marked increase in dopamine release from the mesolimbic pathway when animals engage in intracranial self-stimulation.&lt;ref name="Behavioral neuroscience textbook" /&gt; Second, experiments consistently indicate that brain-stimulation reward stimulates the reinforcement of pathways that are normally activated by [[natural rewards]], and [[drug reward]] or intracranial self-stimulation can exert more powerful activation of central reward mechanisms because they activate the reward center directly rather than through the [[peripheral nerves]].&lt;ref name="Behavioral neuroscience textbook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wise et al. 1989"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wise RA, Rompre PP | title = Brain dopamine and reward | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 40 | issue = | pages = 191–225 | date = 1989 | pmid = 2648975 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.ps.40.020189.001203 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wise 2002"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wise RA | title = Brain reward circuitry: insights from unsensed incentives | journal = Neuron | volume = 36 | issue = 2 | pages = 229–240 | date = October 2002 | pmid = 12383779 | doi = 10.1016/S0896-6273(02)00965-0 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Third, when animals are administered addictive drugs or engage in naturally rewarding behaviors, such as feeding or sexual activity, there is a marked release of dopamine within the nucleus accumbens.&lt;ref name="Behavioral neuroscience textbook"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kolb B, Whishaw IQ|title=An Introduction to Brain and Behavior|date=2001|publisher=Worth|location=New York|isbn=9780716751694|pages=438–441|edition=1st|chapter=&lt;!-- placeholder --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, dopamine is not the only reward compound in the brain.

Operant behavior gives a good definition for rewards. Anything that makes an individual come back for more is a positive reinforcer and therefore a reward. Although it provides a good definition, positive reinforcement is only one of several reward functions.&amp;nbsp;... Rewards are attractive. They are motivating and make us exert an effort.&amp;nbsp;... Rewards induce approach behavior, also called appetitive or preparatory behavior, and consummatory behavior.&amp;nbsp;... Thus any stimulus, object, event, activity, or situation that has the potential to make us approach and consume it is by definition a reward.&amp;nbsp;... Rewarding stimuli, objects, events, situations, and activities consist of several major components. First, rewards have basic sensory components (visual, auditory, somatosensory, gustatory, and olfactory)&amp;nbsp;... Second, rewards are salient and thus elicit attention, which are manifested as orienting responses (FIGURE 1, middle). The salience of rewards derives from three principal factors, namely, their physical intensity and impact (physical salience), their novelty and surprise (novelty/surprise salience), and their general motivational impact shared with punishers (motivational salience). A separate form not included in this scheme, incentive salience, primarily addresses dopamine function in addiction and refers only to approach behavior (as opposed to learning)&amp;nbsp;... Third, rewards have a value component that determines the positively motivating effects of rewards and is not contained in, nor explained by, the sensory and attentional components (FIGURE 1, right). This component reflects behavioral preferences and thus is subjective and only partially determined by physical parameters. Only this component constitutes what we understand as a reward. It mediates the specific behavioral reinforcing, approach generating, and emotional effects of rewards that are crucial for the organism’s survival and reproduction, whereas all other components are only supportive of these functions.&amp;nbsp;... Rewards can also be intrinsic to behavior (31, 546, 547). They contrast with extrinsic rewards that provide motivation for behavior and constitute the essence of operant behavior in laboratory tests. Intrinsic rewards are activities that are pleasurable on their own and are undertaken for their own sake, without being the means for getting extrinsic rewards.&amp;nbsp;... Intrinsic rewards are genuine rewards in their own right, as they induce learning, approach, and pleasure, like perfectioning, playing, and enjoying the piano. Although they can serve to condition higher order rewards, they are not conditioned, higher order rewards, as attaining their reward properties does not require pairing with an unconditioned reward.&amp;nbsp;...  These emotions are also called liking (for pleasure) and wanting (for desire) in addiction research (471) and strongly support the learning and approach generating functions of reward.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stimuli that are naturally pleasurable, and therefore attractive, are known as ''intrinsic rewards'', whereas stimuli that are attractive and motivate approach behavior, but are not inherently pleasurable, are termed ''extrinsic rewards''.&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt;  Extrinsic rewards (e.g., money) are rewarding as a result of a [[associative learning|learned association]] with an intrinsic reward.&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt; In other words, extrinsic rewards function as motivational magnets that elicit "wanting", but not "liking" reactions once they have been acquired.&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt;

The reward system contains {{if pagename|Reward system='''pleasure centers'''&amp;nbsp;or '''hedonic hotspots'''|other=[[pleasure centers]]&amp;nbsp;or [[hedonic hotspots]]}} – i.e., brain structures that mediate pleasure or "liking" reactions from intrinsic rewards. {{as of|2017|October|post=,}} hedonic hotspots have been identified in subcompartments within the [[nucleus accumbens shell]], [[ventral pallidum]], [[parabrachial nucleus]], [[orbitofrontal cortex]] (OFC), and [[insular cortex]].&lt;ref name="Pleasure system"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Berridge KC, Kringelbach ML | title = Pleasure systems in the brain | journal = Neuron | volume = 86 | issue = 3 | pages = 646–664 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25950633 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuron.2015.02.018 | quote = In the prefrontal cortex, recent evidence indicates that the [orbitofrontal cortex] OFC and insula cortex may each contain their own additional hot spots (D.C.

Successful confirmation of hedonic hot spots in the OFC or insula would be important and possibly relevant to the orbitofrontal mid-anterior site mentioned earlier that especially tracks the subjective pleasure of foods in humans (Georgiadis et al., 2012; Kringelbach, 2005; Kringelbach et al., 2003; Small et al., 2001; Veldhuizen et al., 2010). Finally, in the brainstem, a hindbrain site near the parabrachial nucleus of dorsal pons also appears able to contribute to hedonic gains of function (Söderpalm and Berridge, 2000). A brainstem mechanism for pleasure may seem more surprising than forebrain hot spots to anyone who views the brainstem as merely reflexive, but the pontine parabrachial nucleus contributes to taste, pain, and many visceral sensations from the body and has also been suggested to play an important role in motivation (Wu et al., 2012) and in human emotion (especially related to the somatic marker hypothesis) (Damasio, 2010). | pmc=4425246}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mapping brain circuits"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Richard JM, Castro DC, Difeliceantonio AG, Robinson MJ, Berridge KC | title = Mapping brain circuits of reward and motivation: in the footsteps of Ann Kelley | journal = Neurosci.

[[Incentive salience]] is the "wanting" or "desire" attribute, which includes a motivational component, that is assigned to a rewarding stimulus by the [[nucleus accumbens shell]] (NAcc shell).&lt;ref name=Schultz /&gt;&lt;ref name="Incentive salience and motivation review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Berridge KC | title = From prediction error to incentive salience: mesolimbic computation of reward motivation | journal = Eur.

Incentive salience takes Pavlovian learning and memory as one input and as an equally important input takes neurobiological state factors (e.g. drug states, appetite states, satiety states) that can vary independently of learning. Neurobiological state changes can produce unlearned fluctuations or even reversals in the ability of a previously learned reward cue to trigger motivation. Such fluctuations in cue-triggered motivation can dramatically depart from all previously learned values about the associated reward outcome.&amp;nbsp;... Associative learning and prediction are important contributors to motivation for rewards. Learning gives incentive value to arbitrary cues such as a Pavlovian conditioned stimulus (CS) that is associated with a reward (unconditioned stimulus or UCS). Learned cues for reward are often potent triggers of desires. For example, learned cues can trigger normal appetites in everyone, and can sometimes trigger compulsive urges and relapse in addicts.&lt;br /&gt;Cue-triggered 'wanting’ for the UCS&lt;br /&gt;A brief CS encounter (or brief UCS encounter) often primes a pulse of elevated motivation to obtain and consume more reward UCS. This is a signature feature of incentive salience.&lt;br /&gt;Cue as attractive motivational magnets&lt;br /&gt;When a Pavlovian CS+ is attributed with incentive salience it not only triggers 'wanting’ for its UCS, but often the cue itself becomes highly attractive – even to an irrational degree. This cue attraction is another signature feature of incentive salience&amp;nbsp;... Two recognizable features of incentive salience are often visible that can be used in neuroscience experiments: (i) UCS-directed 'wanting’ – CS-triggered pulses of intensified 'wanting’ for the UCS reward; and (ii) CS-directed 'wanting’ – motivated attraction to the Pavlovian cue, which makes the arbitrary CS stimulus into a motivational magnet.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NAcc function"&gt;{{cite book | author=Malenka RC, Nestler EJ, Hyman SE |veditors=Sydor A, Brown RY, eds | title = Molecular Neuropharmacology: A Foundation for Clinical Neuroscience | year = 2009 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-07-148127-4 | pages = 147–148, 367, 376 | edition = 2nd | quote= VTA DA neurons play a critical role in motivation, reward-related behavior (Chapter 15), attention, and multiple forms of memory. This organization of the DA system, wide projection from a limited number of cell bodies, permits coordinated responses to potent new rewards. Thus, acting in diverse terminal fields, dopamine confers motivational salience ("wanting") on the reward itself or associated cues (nucleus accumbens shell region), updates the value placed on different goals in light of this new experience (orbital prefrontal cortex), helps consolidate multiple forms of memory (amygdala and hippocampus), and encodes new motor programs that will facilitate obtaining this reward in the future (nucleus accumbens core region and dorsal striatum). In this example, dopamine modulates the processing of sensorimotor information in diverse neural circuits to maximize the ability of the organism to obtain future rewards.&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt;The brain reward circuitry that is targeted by addictive drugs normally mediates the pleasure and strengthening of behaviors associated with natural reinforcers, such as food, water, and sexual contact.

As previously mentioned, the activity of dopaminergic neurons in the VTA appears to be linked to reward prediction. The NAc is involved in learning associated with reinforcement and the modulation of motoric responses to stimuli that satisfy internal homeostatic needs. The shell of the NAc appears to be particularly important to initial drug actions within reward circuitry; addictive drugs appear to have a greater effect on dopamine release in the shell than in the core of the NAc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degree of dopamine neurotransmission into the NAcc shell from the [[mesolimbic pathway]] is highly correlated with the magnitude of incentive salience for rewarding stimuli.&lt;ref name="Incentive salience and motivation review" /&gt;

Robinson and Berridge's incentive-sensitization theory (1993) proposed that ''reward'' contains separable psychological components: wanting (incentive) and liking (pleasure). To explain increasing contact with a certain stimulus such as chocolate, there are two independent factors at work – our desire to have the chocolate (wanting) and the pleasure effect of the chocolate (liking). According to Robinson and Berridge, wanting and liking are two aspects of the same process, so rewards are usually wanted and liked to the same degree. However, wanting and liking also change independently under certain circumstances. For example, rats that do not eat after receiving dopamine (experiencing a loss of desire for food) act as though they still like food. In another example, activated self-stimulation electrodes in the lateral hypothalamus of rats increase appetite, but also cause more adverse reactions to tastes such as sugar and salt; apparently, the stimulation increases wanting but not liking. Such results demonstrate that our reward system includes independent processes of wanting and liking. The wanting component is thought to be controlled by [[dopaminergic pathways]], whereas the liking component is thought to be controlled by opiate-benzodiazepine systems.&lt;ref name="Behavioral neuroscience textbook" /&gt;

===Animals vs. humans===
Animals quickly learn to press a bar to obtain an injection of opiates directly into the [[midbrain tegmentum]] or the [[nucleus accumbens]]. The same animals do not work to obtain the opiates if the dopaminergic neurons of the [[mesolimbic pathway]] are inactivated. In this perspective, animals, like humans, engage in behaviors that increase dopamine release.

[[Kent C. Berridge|Kent Berridge]], a researcher in [[affective neuroscience]], found that sweet (''liked''&amp;thinsp;) and bitter (''disliked''&amp;thinsp;) tastes produced distinct [[Facial expression|orofacial expression]]s, and these expressions were similarly displayed by human newborns, orangutans, and rats. This was evidence that pleasure (specifically, ''liking'') has objective features and was essentially the same across various animal species. Most neuroscience studies have shown that the more dopamine released by the reward, the more effective the reward is. This is called the hedonic impact, which can be changed by the effort for the reward and the reward itself. Berridge discovered that blocking dopamine systems did not seem to change the positive reaction to something sweet (as measured by facial expression). In other words, the hedonic impact did not change based on the amount of sugar. This discounted the conventional assumption that dopamine mediates pleasure. Even with more-intense dopamine alterations, the data seemed to remain constant.&lt;ref name="Berridge" /&gt;

Berridge developed the ''[[incentive salience]] hypothesis'' to address the ''wanting'' aspect of rewards. It explains the compulsive use of drugs by drug addicts even when the drug no longer produces euphoria, and the cravings experienced even after the individual has finished going through withdrawal. Some addicts respond to certain stimuli involving neural changes caused by drugs. This sensitization in the brain is similar to the effect of dopamine because ''wanting'' and ''liking'' reactions occur. Human and animal brains and behaviors experience similar changes regarding reward systems because these systems are so prominent.&lt;ref name="Berridge"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Berridge KC, Kringelbach ML|date=2008|title=Affective neuroscience of pleasure: reward in humans and animals|url=http://lsa.umich.edu/psych/research&amp;labs/berridge/publications/Berridge%20&amp;%20Kringelbach%20Affective%20neuroscience%20of%20pleasure%20Psychopharmacology%202008.pdf|journal=Psychopharmacology|volume=199|issue=3|pages=457–480|doi=10.1007/s00213-008-1099-6|issn=0033-3158|access-date=20 October 2012|pmid=18311558|pmc=3004012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Learning==
{{Further|Associative learning}}
Rewarding stimuli can drive [[learning]] in both the form of [[classical conditioning|classical conditioning (Pavlovian conditioning)]] and [[operant conditioning|operant conditioning (instrumental conditioning)]]. In classical conditioning, a reward can act as an unconditioned stimulus that, when associated with the conditioned stimulus, causes the conditioned stimulus to elicit both musculoskeletal (in the form of simple approach and avoidance behaviors) and vegetative responses.  In operant conditioning, a reward may act as a [[reinforcer]] in that it increases or supports actions that lead to itself.&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt; Learned behaviors may or may not be sensitive to the value of the outcomes they lead to; behaviors that are sensitive to the contingency of an outcome on the performance of an action as well as the outcome value are [[goal|goal-directed]], while  elicited actions that are insensitive to contingency or value are called [[habit]]s.&lt;ref name="Yinn 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yin |first1=HH |last2=Ostlund |first2=SB |last3=Balleine |first3=BW |title=Reward-guided learning beyond dopamine in the nucleus accumbens: the integrative functions of cortico-basal ganglia networks |journal=The European Journal of Neuroscience |date=October 2008 |volume=28 |issue=8 |pages=1437–48 |doi=10.1111/j.1460-9568.2008.06422.x |pmid=18793321 |pmc=2756656}}&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction is thought to reflected two forms of learning, model free and model based.  Model free learning involves the simple caching and updating of values.  In contrast, model based learning involves the storage and construction of an internal model of events that allows inference and flexible prediction. Although pavlovian conditioning is generally assumed to be model-free, the incentive salience assigned to a conditioned stimulus is flexible with regard to changes in internal motivational states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dayan |first1=P |last2=Berridge |first2=KC |title=Model-based and model-free Pavlovian reward learning: revaluation, revision, and revelation |journal=Cognitive, Affective &amp; Behavioral Neuroscience |date=June 2014 |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=473–92 |doi=10.3758/s13415-014-0277-8 |pmid=24647659 |pmc=4074442}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Distinct neural systems are responsible for learning associations between stimuli and outcomes, actions and outcomes, and stimuli and responses. Although classical conditioning is not limited to the reward system, the enhancement of instrumental performance by stimuli (i.e., [[Pavlovian-instrumental transfer]]) requires the nucleus accumbens. Habitual and goal directed instrumental learning are dependent upon the lateral [[striatum]] and the medial striatum, respectively.&lt;ref name="Yinn 2008"/&gt;

During instrumental learning, opposing changes in the ratio of [[AMPA receptor|AMPA]] to [[NMDA receptor|NMDA]] receptors and phosphorylated [[extracellular signal–regulated kinases|ERK]] occurs in the [[dopamine receptor D1|D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]]-type and [[dopamine receptor D2|D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]-type MSNs that constitute the [[cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop|direct and indirect pathways]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Balleine |first1=BW |last2=Morris |first2=RW |last3=Leung |first3=BK |title=Thalamocortical integration of instrumental learning and performance and their disintegration in addiction |journal=Brain Research |date=2 December 2015 |volume=1628 |issue=Pt A |pages=104–16 |doi=10.1016/j.brainres.2014.12.023 |pmid=25514336 |quote=Importantly, we found evidence of increased activity in the direct pathway; both intracellular changes in the expression of the plasticity marker pERK and AMPA/NMDA ratios evoked by stimulating cortical afferents were increased in the D1-direct pathway neurons.

The intracellular cascade activated by D1 receptors involves the recruitment of [[protein kinase A]], and through resulting phosphorylation of [[DARPP-32]], the inhibition of phosphatases that deactivate ERK.  NMDA receptors activate ERK through a different but interrelated [[MAPK/ERK|Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway]].  Alone NMDA mediated activation of ERK is self-limited, as NMDA activation also inhibits PKA mediated inhibition of ERK deactivating phosphatases.  However, when D1 and NMDA cascades are co-activated, they work synergistically, and the resultant activation of ERK regulates synaptic plasticity in the form of spine restructuring, transport of AMPA receptors, regulation of [[CREB]], and increasing cellular excitability via inhibiting [[KCND2|Kv4.2]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shiflett |first1=MW |last2=Balleine |first2=BW |title=Molecular substrates of action control in cortico-striatal circuits |journal=Progress in Neurobiology |date=15 September 2011 |volume=95 |issue=1 |pages=1–13 |doi=10.1016/j.pneurobio.2011.05.007 |pmid=21704115 |pmc=3175490}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schultz |first1=W |title=Updating dopamine reward signals |journal=Current Opinion in Neurobiology |date=April 2013 |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=229–38 |doi=10.1016/j.conb.2012.11.012 |pmid=23267662 |pmc=3866681}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shiflett |first1=MW |last2=Balleine |first2=BW |title=Contributions of ERK signaling in the striatum to instrumental learning and performance |journal=Behavioural Brain Research |date=17 March 2011 |volume=218 |issue=1 |pages=240–7 |doi=10.1016/j.bbr.2010.12.010 |pmid=21147168 |pmc=3022085}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Skinner box scheme 01.png|right|thumb|250px|Skinner box]]
The first clue to the presence of a reward system in the brain came with an accident discovery by James Olds and Peter Milner in 1954. They discovered that rats would perform behaviors such as pressing a bar, to administer a brief burst of electrical stimulation to specific sites in their brains. This phenomenon is called [[intracranial self-stimulation]] or [[brain stimulation reward]]. Typically, rats will press a lever hundreds or thousands of times per hour to obtain this brain stimulation, stopping only when they are exhausted. While trying to teach rats how to solve problems and run mazes, stimulation of certain regions of the brain where the stimulation was found seemed to give pleasure to the animals. They tried the same thing with humans and the results were similar. The explanation to why animals engage in a behavior that has no value to the survival of either themselves or their species is that the brain stimulation is activating the system underlying reward.&lt;ref name="pmid8833446"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wise RA | title = Addictive drugs and brain stimulation reward | journal = Annu.

In a fundamental discovery made in 1954, researchers [[James Olds]] and Peter Milner found that low-voltage electrical stimulation of certain regions of the brain of the rat acted as a reward in teaching the animals to run mazes and solve problems.&lt;ref name="brit"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/409709/human-nervous-system/75649/Reward-and-punishment?anchor=ref942262 |title=human nervous system}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="work"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wadsworth.com/psychology_d/templates/student_resources/0155060678_rathus/ps/ps02.html |title=Positive Reinforcement Produced by Electrical Stimulation of Septal Area and Other Regions of Rat Brain}}&lt;/ref&gt; It seemed that stimulation of those parts of the brain gave the animals pleasure,&lt;ref name="brit" /&gt; and in later work humans reported pleasurable sensations from such stimulation. When rats were tested in [[Skinner box]]es where they could stimulate the reward system by pressing a lever, the rats pressed for hours.&lt;ref name="work" /&gt; Research in the next two decades established that [[dopamine]] is one of the main chemicals aiding neural signaling in these regions, and [[dopamine]] was suggested to be the brain's "pleasure chemical".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discoverymedicine.com/Morten-L-Kringelbach/2010/06/25/the-functional-neuroanatomy-of-pleasure-and-happiness/ |title=The Functional Neuroanatomy of Pleasure and Happiness}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ivan Pavlov]] was a psychologist who used the reward system to study [[classical conditioning]]. Pavlov used the reward system by rewarding dogs with food after they had heard a bell or another stimulus. Pavlov was rewarding the dogs so that the dogs associated food, the reward, with the bell, the stimulus.&lt;ref name=PavlovAnrep2003&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ivan Petrovich Pavlov|author2=G. V.

Edward L. Thorndike used the reward system to study operant conditioning. He began by putting cats in a puzzle box and placing food outside of the box so that the cat wanted to escape. The cats worked to get out of the puzzle box to get to the food. Although the cats ate the food after they escaped the box, Thorndike learned that the cats attempted to escape the box without the reward of food. Thorndike used the rewards of food and freedom to stimulate the reward system of the cats. Thorndike used this to see how the cats learned to escape the box.&lt;ref name="Fridlund 2014"&gt;Fridlund, Alan and James Kalat. Mind and Brain, the Science of Psychology.

=== Addiction ===
{{main|Addiction}}
[[&amp;Delta;FosB]] (DeltaFosB) – a [[gene transcription factor]] – [[overexpression]] in the [[D1-type]] [[medium spiny neuron]]s of the [[nucleus accumbens]] is the ''crucial'' common factor among virtually all forms of addiction (i.e., [[behavioral addiction]]s and [[drug addiction]]s) that induces addiction-related behavior and [[neural plasticity]].&lt;ref name="Cellular basis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="What the ΔFosB?" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Natural and drug addictions" /&gt;&lt;ref name="G9a reverses ΔFosB plasticity" /&gt; In particular, ΔFosB promotes [[self-administration]], [[reward sensitization]], and reward cross-sensitization effects among specific addictive drugs and behaviors.&lt;ref name="Cellular basis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="What the ΔFosB?"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ruffle JK | title = Molecular neurobiology of addiction: what's all the (Δ)FosB about? | journal = Am.

Over the past two decades, research has progressed from identifying ΔFosB induction to investigating its subsequent action (38). It is likely that ΔFosB research will now progress into a new era – the use of ΔFosB as a biomarker.&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt;Conclusions&lt;br /&gt;ΔFosB is an essential transcription factor implicated in the molecular and behavioral pathways of addiction following repeated drug exposure. The formation of ΔFosB in multiple brain regions, and the molecular pathway leading to the formation of AP-1 complexes is well understood. The establishment of a functional purpose for ΔFosB has allowed further determination as to some of the key aspects of its molecular cascades, involving effectors such as GluR2 (87,88), Cdk5 (93) and NFkB (100). Moreover, many of these molecular changes identified are now directly linked to the structural, physiological and behavioral changes observed following chronic drug exposure (60,95,97,102). New frontiers of research investigating the molecular roles of ΔFosB have been opened by epigenetic studies, and recent advances have illustrated the role of ΔFosB acting on DNA and histones, truly as a ''molecular switch'' (34). As a consequence of our improved understanding of ΔFosB in addiction, it is possible to evaluate the addictive potential of current medications (119), as well as use it as a biomarker for assessing the efficacy of therapeutic interventions (121,122,124). Some of these proposed interventions have limitations (125) or are in their infancy (75). However, it is hoped that some of these preliminary findings may lead to innovative treatments, which are much needed in addiction.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Natural and drug addictions"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Olsen CM | title = Natural rewards, neuroplasticity, and non-drug addictions | journal = Neuropharmacology | volume = 61 | issue = 7 | pages = 1109–1122 |date=December 2011  | pmid = 21459101 | pmc = 3139704 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuropharm.2011.03.010 | quote =  Functional neuroimaging studies in humans have shown that gambling (Breiter et al, 2001), shopping (Knutson et al, 2007), orgasm (Komisaruk et al, 2004), playing video games (Koepp et al, 1998; Hoeft et al, 2008) and the sight of appetizing food (Wang et al, 2004a) activate many of the same brain regions (i.e., the mesocorticolimbic system and extended amygdala) as drugs of abuse (Volkow et al, 2004).&amp;nbsp;... Cross-sensitization is also bidirectional, as a history of amphetamine administration facilitates sexual behavior and enhances the associated increase in NAc DA&amp;nbsp;... As described for food reward, sexual experience can also lead to activation of plasticity-related signaling cascades. The transcription factor delta FosB is increased in the NAc, PFC, dorsal striatum, and VTA following repeated sexual behavior (Wallace et al., 2008; Pitchers et al., 2010b). This natural increase in delta FosB or viral overexpression of delta FosB within the NAc modulates sexual performance, and NAc blockade of delta FosB attenuates this behavior (Hedges et al, 2009; Pitchers et al., 2010b). Further, viral overexpression of delta FosB enhances the conditioned place preference for an environment paired with sexual experience (Hedges et al., 2009).&amp;nbsp;...

In humans, the role of dopamine signaling in incentive-sensitization processes has recently been highlighted by the observation of a dopamine dysregulation syndrome in some patients taking dopaminergic drugs.

Sexual behavior is highly rewarding (Tenk et al., 2009), and sexual experience causes sensitized drug-related behaviors, including cross-sensitization to amphetamine (Amph)-induced locomotor activity (Bradley and Meisel, 2001; Pitchers et al., 2010a) and enhanced Amph reward (Pitchers et al., 2010a). Moreover, sexual experience induces neural plasticity in the NAc similar to that induced by psychostimulant exposure, including increased dendritic spine density (Meisel and Mullins, 2006; Pitchers et al., 2010a), altered glutamate receptor trafficking, and decreased synaptic strength in prefrontal cortex-responding NAc shell neurons (Pitchers et al., 2012). Finally, periods of abstinence from sexual experience were found to be critical for enhanced Amph reward, NAc spinogenesis (Pitchers et al., 2010a), and glutamate receptor trafficking (Pitchers et al., 2012).

In the case of fear or paranoia, dysfunction may lie in elevated [[aversive salience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Olney |first1=JJ |last2=Warlow |first2=SM |last3=Naffziger |first3=EE |last4=Berridge |first4=KC |title=Current perspectives on incentive salience and applications to clinical disorders |journal=Current Opinion in Behavioral Sciences |date=August 2018 |volume=22 |pages=59–69 |doi=10.1016/j.cobeha.2018.01.007 |pmid=29503841 |pmc=5831552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neuroimaging studies across diagnoses associated with anhedonia have reported reduced activity in the OFC and ventral striatum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Preda |first1=Adrian |editor1-last=Ritsner |editor1-first=Michael |title=Anhedonia : a comprehensive handbook |date=2014 |publisher=Springer Netherlands |location=Dordrecht |isbn=978-94-017-8590-7 |chapter=Brain Imaging Correlates of Anhedonia}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One meta analysis reported anhedonia was associated with reduced neural response to reward anticipation in the caudate nucleus, putamen, nucleus accumbens and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zhang |first1=B |last2=Lin |first2=P |last3=Shi |first3=H |last4=Öngür |first4=D |last5=Auerbach |first5=RP |last6=Wang |first6=X |last7=Yao |first7=S |last8=Wang |first8=X |title=Mapping anhedonia-specific dysfunction in a transdiagnostic approach: an ALE meta-analysis |journal=Brain Imaging and Behavior |date=September 2016 |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=920–39 |doi=10.1007/s11682-015-9457-6 |pmid=26487590 |pmc=4838562}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mood Disorders====
Depression is associated with reduced motivation, as assessed by willingness to expend effort for reward.  These abnormalities have been tentatively linked to reduced activity in areas of the striatum, and while dopaminergic abnormalities are hypothesized to play a role, most studies probing dopamine function in depression have reported inconsistent results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Treadway |first1=Michael, T. |editor1-last=Simpson |editor1-first=Eleanor H. |editor2-last=Balsam |editor2-first=Peter D. |title=Behavioral Neuroscience of Motivation (Current Topics in Behavioral Neurosciences) |date=2016 |publisher=Springer International Publishing |location=Switzerland |isbn=978-3-319-26933-7 |page=343 |edition=1st |chapter=The Neurobiology of Motivational Deficits in Depression— An Update on Candidate Pathomechanisms |quote=In a relatively recent literature, studies of motivation and reinforcement in depression have been largely consistent in detecting differences as compared to healthy controls (Whitton et al. 2015). In several studies using the effort expenditure for reward task (EEfRT), patients with MDD expended less effort for rewards when compared with controls (Treadway et al. 2012; Yang et al. 2014)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Salamone |first1=JD |last2=Yohn |first2=SE |last3=López-Cruz |first3=L |last4=San Miguel |first4=N |last5=Correa |first5=M |title=Activational and effort-related aspects of motivation: neural mechanisms and implications for psychopathology |journal=Brain: A Journal of Neurology |date=May 2016 |volume=139 |issue=Pt 5 |pages=1325–47 |doi=10.1093/brain/aww050 |pmid=27189581 |pmc=5839596}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although postmortem and neuroimaging studies have found abnormalities in numerous regions of the reward system, few findings are consistently replicated.  Some studies have reported reduced NAcc, hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) activity, as well as elevated [[basolateral amygdala]] and [[Brodmann area 25|subgenual cingulate cortex (sgACC)]] activity during tasks related to reward or positive stimuli. These neuroimaging abnormalities are complimented by little post mortem research, but what little research has been done suggests reduced excitatory synapses in the mPFC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Russo |first1=SJ |last2=Nestler |first2=EJ |title=The brain reward circuitry in mood disorders |journal=Nature Reviews. Neuroscience |date=September 2013 |volume=14 |issue=9 |pages=609–25 |doi=10.1038/nrn3381 |pmid=23942470 |pmc=3867253}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reduced activity in the mPFC during reward related tasks appears to be localized to more dorsal regions(i.e. the [[Brodmann area 24|pregenual cingulate cortex]]), while the more ventral sgACC is hyperactive in depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Treadway |first1=MT |last2=Zald |first2=DH |title=Reconsidering anhedonia in depression: lessons from translational neuroscience |journal=Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews |date=January 2011 |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=537–55 |doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2010.06.006 |pmid=20603146 |pmc=3005986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts to investigate underlying neural circuitry in animal models has also yielded conflicting results.  Two paradigms are commonly used to simulate depression, chronic social defeat (CSDS), and chronic mild stress (CMS), although many exist. CSDS produces reduced preference for sucrose, reduced social interactions, and increased immobility in the forced swim test.  CMS similarly reduces sucrose preference, and behavioral despair as assessed by tail suspension and forced swim tests.  Animals susceptible to CSDS exhibit increased phasic VTA firing, and inhibition of VTA-NAcc projections attenuates behavioral deficits induced by CSDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Walsh |first1=JJ |last2=Han |first2=MH |title=The heterogeneity of ventral tegmental area neurons: Projection functions in a mood-related context |journal=Neuroscience |date=12 December 2014 |volume=282 |pages=101–8 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroscience.2014.06.006 |pmid=24931766 |pmc=4339667}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, inhibition of VTA-{{abbr|mPFC|medial prefrontal cortex}} projections exacerbates social withdrawal.  On the other hand, CMS associated reductions in sucrose preference and immobility were attenuated and exacerbated by VTA excitation and inhibition, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lammel |first1=S |last2=Lim |first2=BK |last3=Malenka |first3=RC |title=Reward and aversion in a heterogeneous midbrain dopamine system |journal=Neuropharmacology |date=January 2014 |volume=76 Pt B |pages=351–9 |doi=10.1016/j.neuropharm.2013.03.019 |pmid=23578393 |pmc=3778102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Knowland |first1=D |last2=Lim |first2=BK |title=Circuit-based frameworks of depressive behaviors: The role of reward circuitry and beyond |journal=Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior |date=5 January 2018 |doi=10.1016/j.pbb.2017.12.010 |pmid=29309799}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although these differences may be attributable to different stimulation protocols or poor translational paradigms, variable results may also lie in the heterogenous functionality of reward related regions.&lt;ref name="Lammel2014b"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lammel |first1=S |last2=Tye |first2=KM |last3=Warden |first3=MR |title=Progress in understanding mood disorders: optogenetic dissection of neural circuits |journal=Genes, Brain, and Behavior |date=January 2014 |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=38–51 |doi=10.1111/gbb.12049 |pmid=23682971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Optogenetic]] stimulation of the mPFC as a whole produces antidepressant effects.  This effect appears localized to the rodent homologue of the pgACC (the prelimbic cortex), as stimulation of the rodent homologue of the sgACC (the infralimbic cortex) produces no behavioral effects.  Furthermore, deep brain stimulation in the infralimbic cortex, which is thought to have an inhibitory effect, also produces an antidepressant effect.  This finding is congruent with the observation that pharmacological inhibition of the infralimbic cortex attenuates depressive behaviors.&lt;ref name="Lammel2014b"/&gt;

====Schizophrenia====

Schizophrenia is associated with deficits in motivation, commonly grouped under other negative symptoms such as [[alogia|reduced spontaneous speech]].  The experience of “liking” is frequently reported to be intact,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bucci |first1=P |last2=Galderisi |first2=S |title=Categorizing and assessing negative symptoms |journal=Current Opinion in Psychiatry |date=May 2017 |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=201–208 |doi=10.1097/YCO.0000000000000322 |pmid=28212174 |quote=They also provide a separate assessment of the consummatory anhedonia (reduced experience of pleasure derived from ongoing enjoyable activities) and anticipatory anhedonia (reduced ability to anticipate future pleasure). In fact, the former one seems to be relatively intact in schizophrenia, whereas the latter one seems to be impaired [32 – 34]. However, discrepant data have also been reported [35].}}&lt;/ref&gt; both behaviorally and neurally, although results may be specific to certain stimuli, such as monetary rewards.{{sfn|Young|2018|215a|ps=,"Several recent reviews (e.g., Cohen and Minor, 2010) have found that individuals with schizophrenia show relatively intact self-reported emotional responses to affect-eliciting stimuli as well as other indicators of intact response...A more mixed picture arises from functional neuroimaging studies examining brain responses to other types of pleasurable stimuli in schizophrenia (Paradiso et al., 2003)"}}  Furthermore, implicit learning and simple reward related tasks are also intact in schizophrenia.{{sfn|Young|2018|215b|ps=,"As such it is surprising that behavioral studies have suggested that reinforcement learning is intact in schizophrenia when learning is relatively implicit (though, see Siegert et al., 2008 for evidence of impaired Serial Reaction Time task learning), but more impaired when explicit representations of stimulus-reward contingencies are needed (see Gold et al., 2008). This pattern has given rise to the theory that the striatally mediated gradual reinforcement learning system may be intact in schizophrenia, while more rapid, on-line, cortically mediated learning systems are impaired."}}  Rather, deficits in the reward system present during reward related tasks that are cognitively complex.  These deficits are associated with both abnormal striatal and OFC activity, as well as abnormalities in regions associated with cognitive functions such as the [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]] (dlPFC).{{sfn|Young|2018|216|ps =, "We have recently shown that individuals with schizophrenia can show improved cognitive control performance when information about rewards are externally presented but not when they must be internally maintained (Mann et al., 2013), with some evidence for impairments in DLPFC and striatal activation during internal maintenance of reward information being associated with individuals’ differences in motivation (Chung and Barch, 2016)."}}

'''Scotistic realism''' (also '''Scotist realism''' or '''Scotist formalism''') is the [[Scotist]] position on the [[problem of universals]]. It is a form of [[moderate realism]].

The "problem of universals", which was an ancient problem in [[metaphysics]] about whether [[universals]] exist. For [[John Duns Scotus]], a [[Franciscan]] [[philosopher]], [[theologian]] and [[Catholic priest]], universals such as "greenness" and "goodness" exist in reality. This is opposed to the later [[conceptualism]] of [[William of Ockham]], and the earlier views of [[Abelard]] and others, which say universals exist only within the mind and have no external or substantial reality.&lt;ref&gt;"conceptualism" in ''The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy''. Simon Blackburn. Oxford University Press, 1996. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press. 8 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spade 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

==In scholasticism==

The problem of universals existed as early as [[Plato]], who taught the [[Theory of Forms]], that universal "forms" existed. This opinion was rejected by many later thinkers, such as [[Peter Abelard]], who instead argued that forms are merely mental constructs.&lt;ref&gt; Abelard:Logica Ingredientibus (Glosses on Porphyry)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:De Fantis - Opus Oxoniense - 4324737.tif|thumb|[[Antonio De Fantis]], ''Opus Oxoniense'']]
Scotus denied these claims; in his ''[[Opus Oxoniense]]'' he argued that universals have a real and substantial existence.&lt;ref&gt;Opus Oxoniense II. D3, 1-6, 1-212&lt;/ref&gt; For Scotus, the problem of universals was closely tied to that of [[individuation]], by identifying what makes a particular thing this or that particular thing; we could also come to understand if any form of universal exists, it is in this work that Scotus introduces the word "[[haecceity]]", which means the "thisness" of a particular object – what makes it what it is.

{{Quotation|I say then that the main reason for the likening or similarity is the form itself shared between the generator and the generated, not according to individual unity and identity insofar as it is "this" form, but according to a lesser unity and identity insofar as it is a form. The reason for generating is in accordance with this. Form also is a more principal reason for the distinction than matter is, because just as the form is more principally that by which something is a composite than the matter is, so it is more principally that by which a composite is one, and consequently not distinguished in itself and yet distinct from everything else|Scotus|Ordinatio II, d. 3, p. 1. q. 6, n. 210 [Scotus, (1950-), 7:412-413; Spade (1994), 69]}}

In this, Scotus argues that form is a better means of individuating a particular object; because according to him the form of an object as a composite is the best manner of making objects distinct from one another, rather than the matter of the object. This is at the heart of Scotist realism, particularly at the theories of haecceity and [[formal distinction]]. Scotus also argues, against [[Aquinas]] and others, that there is no distinction between the [[essence]] of a thing and its [[existence]].&lt;ref&gt;Opus Oxoniense I iii 1-2, &lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation of C. S. Peirce==

The American philosopher [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] was quite influenced by Scotus. Here is a statement of Peirce's interpretation of Scotistic Realism by [[T. A. Goudge]]:

The gist of that 'subtle and difficult' doctrine is taken by Peirce to be as follows.  Apart from thought, only singular things exist.  But there are in singulars certain 'natures,' themselves neither universal nor particular, which constitute the ground of intelligibility.  In things, these natures are particular; when brought into relation with an act of the intellect, they are universal ... Thus, for example, the directly experienced hard surface of a particular stone is determinate, whereas the universal hardness which the intellect grasps is indeterminate or general.  A consequence of this view is that the individual per se is not a proper object of knowledge.  What we know are genera and species, themselves the product of mental action.  Yet because complete being embraces both universality and particularity, because man perceives the singular with his senses while cognizing the universal with his intellect, it is possible for him to attain to the singular by relating universals to something which is ''this.''&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A. Goudge, The Thought of C. S. Peirce (Dover 1969), p. 99.  &lt;/ref&gt;

Peirce interprets Scotus's idea of individuation or '''haecceity''' (thisness) in terms of his own category of "secondness." When we think of ''this,'' we are relating our pointing finger, for example, or a particular sense organ with another individual thing. As Scotus said, "nothing is ''this'' in itself." It is so only in relation to something else. Goudge goes on to give Peirce's argument for the objectivity of universals: 

The objection may be raised that such a view destroys the reality of the universal by making it depend on a relation to thought.  Peirce replies that this objection springs from the belief that the real must be wholly independent of reflective activity, i.e., must be a thing in itself.  But the notion of the thing in itself is self-contradictory, for it requires us to think about what is per definitionem out of relation to thought.  We can have no conception of any incognizable reality ... Indeed, “a realist is simply one who knows no more recondite reality than that which is represented in a true representation.”&lt;ref&gt;Charles S. Peirce, Collected papers 5.312.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5184">'''Sewa Day''' is an international [[Volunteering|volunteer]] day and annual event celebrated primarily by [[Hindu]] and [[Sikh]]-affiliated groups. It is celebrated a Sunday of October.

==Background==

''Sewa'', also ''Seva'', is short for the word ''[[Kar seva|Kar Seva]]'', which is derived from the [[Sanskrit]] words ''kar'', meaning hands or work, and ''seva'', meaning service.&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia&gt;
{{cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of Sikhism |first=H. S. |last=Singha |publisher=Hemkunt Press |year=2000 |ISBN=8170103010 |p=121}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |title=Image journeys: audio-visual media and cultural change in India |last= |first= |authorlink= |author=Christiane Brosius, Melissa Butcher |year=1999 |publisher=Sage Publications |location= |isbn=978-0-7619-9325-4 |page=134 |pages= |url=}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], the word ''seva'' also means "to worship, to adore, to pay homage through the act of love". In the writings of Sikh gurus, these two meanings of ''seva'' (service and worship) have been merged. ''Seva'' is expected to be a labour of love performed without desire and intention, and with humility.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |title=Labour of love: Kar seva at Darbar Sahib's Amrit Sarover |first=Gurmit Singh |last=Virdee |journal=Sikh Formations: Religion, Culture, Theory |volume=1 |number=1 |pp=13–28 |DOI=10.1080/17448720500231409}}
&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kar seva'' is often translated as "voluntary labour". In the Punjabi language the person performing such service is called a ''Sevadar''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sikhiwiki.org/index.php/Seva Sikhi Wiki Seva definition], accessed June 24, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Sewa Day was launched in 2010 by a nonprofit of the same name, a charity registered in [[England]] &amp; [[Wales]] (No. 4446848).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sewaday.org/about-sewa-day//  Sewa Day About Us], accessed June 24, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sewaday.org/facts/  Sewa Day Facts], accessed June 24, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

The first six Sewa Days were held on the first Sunday of October. This will change in 2016:

Participating groups have organised Sewa Day volunteering projects in old peoples’ homes, homeless shelters, schools in disadvantaged areas, hospitals and hospices, parks, conservation areas and farms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhsf.org.uk/sewa-day/  What is Sewa Day], National Hindu Students' Forum (UK), accessed June 24, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, over 75,000 volunteers took part in over 25 countries resulting in more than 561,000 volunteering hours. Sewa Day has taken place in the following countries:
* [[Asia]]: [[China]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Nepal]]
* [[Europe]]: [[Russia]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Ireland]], [[Finland]], [[Denmark]], [[Spain]], [[Portugal]]
* [[Middle East]]: [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Oman]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3017">'''Spacecraft Event Time (SCET)''' is the spacecraft-local time for events that happen at the spacecraft.  SCET is used for command programs that control the timing of spacecraft operations and to identify when specific events occur on the spacecraft relative to Earth time.

==SCET versus Earth time==

Since signals between the spacecraft and Earth are limited to the speed of light, there is a delay between the time an event happens on the spacecraft (such as the transmission of data taken from an instrument reading) and the time that a signal reporting the event reaches Earth.  Similarly, there is a delay between when instructions are sent from Earth and when the spacecraft receives the instructions.  The length of delay is relative to the distance between the sending and receiving points.  Failure to take this delay into account could result in inaccurate data or mistakes in spacecraft control.

===Calculating SCET===

Determining the Spacecraft Event Time involves taking the time at Earth and adding or subtracting the signal travel time, depending on whether the signal is being sent to or received from the spacecraft.  For events transmitted from the spacecraft to Earth, the SCET of an event on the spacecraft can be defined as equal to the ERT (Earth-Received Time) minus the OWLT (One-Way Light Time).&lt;ref&gt;Basics of Space Flight Glossary; JPL/NASA&lt;/ref&gt;  For events transmitted from Earth to the spacecraft, the calculation is TRM ([http://www.memidex.com/transmission-time transmission time]) plus OWLT.  For example, if a signal were received on Earth at exactly 11:00 UTC from a spacecraft showing that it had just completed a maneuvering thrust, but the spacecraft was four light-hours away from Earth (the distance of the [[New Horizons]] spacecraft at one point as it approaches [[Pluto]]), the SCET time of the thrust maneuver would have been four hours earlier, at 07:00.

'''Spacecraft Event Time''' in [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] is also known as '''Orbiter UTC''', and Earth-received time as '''Ground UTC'''.

===Spacecraft control===

Since it takes time for a radio transmission to reach a spacecraft from [[Earth]], the usual operation of a spacecraft is controlled with an uploaded command script containing SCET markers to ensure a certain timeline of events. Because of the delay between the sending of instructions from Earth and their receipt and execution by the spacecraft, real-time commanding of robotic spacecraft is done rarely: usually only in response to an emergency event, when changes in spacecraft operations must be made as soon as possible.  For example, a spacecraft could be instructed to go into [[Safe mode (spacecraft)|safe mode]] to protect it during a [[Coronal mass ejection|CME]] of the [[Sun]].

The '''speckled kingsnake''' (''Lampropeltis holbrooki'') is a nonvenomous [[species]] of [[kingsnake]], which is [[Endemism|endemic]] to the [[United States]].

==Description==
[[Image:Speckled Kingsnake-head.jpg|thumb|right|Adult in Mississippi]]
The speckled kingsnake usually grows up to {{convert|48|in|cm}} in total length (including tail), but the record total length is {{convert|72|in|cm}}. The common name is derived from the pattern, which is [[black]], with small [[yellow]]-[[white]] specks, one speck in the center of almost every [[Dorsal scales|dorsal scale]]. It is also known as the "salt-and-pepper snake".&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Conant (herpetologist)|Conant R]] (1975). ''A Field Guide to Reptiles and Amphibians of Eastern and Central North America, Second Edition''. Boston: Houghton Mifflin. xviii + 429 pp. + Plates 1-48. {{ISBN|0-395-19979-4}} (hardcover), {{ISBN|0-395-19977-8}} (paperback). (''Lampropeltis getulus holbrooki'', pp. 203-204 + Plate 29 + Map 156).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographic range==
The speckled kingsnake is found in the central to southern [[United States]] from southern [[Iowa]] to the [[Gulf of Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kingsnake.com/louisiana/species_speckled_kingsnake.htm |title=Speckled Kingsnake |publisher=Kingsnake.com |date= |accessdate=2009-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its range overlaps that of the desert kingsnake, ''[[Lampropeltis getula splendida]]'', and it is known to [[Hybrid (biology)|intergrade]] with that subspecies.

==Habitat==
The speckled kingsnake prefers wetter [[habitat]]s than other kingsnakes, like swamps and rivers, but it does commonly venture to dry areas like woodlands and grassy fields.

==Diet==
The [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] of the speckled kingsnake consists of [[mammal]]s, [[bird]]s, [[rodent]]s, frogs, [[lizard]]s, and other [[snake]]s. It kills by constriction.

==Behavior==
When threatened, the speckled kingsnake will shake its tail like a rattlesnake to deter predators. It frequently will expel [[musk]] and [[feces]] or bite when threatened.

It is usually docile, often striking only one or two times after capture, and is frequently kept as a [[pet]]. It is commonly [[captive breeding|captive bred]].

==Taxonomy and etymology==
This snake was first described by American herpetologist [[John Edwards Holbrook]] in 1842.  At that time he called it ''Coronella sayi'' under the mistaken impression that it was the species previously described by [[Hermann Schlegel|Schlegel]] as ''Coluber sayi''.  In 1902 [[Leonhard Hess Stejneger|Stejneger]] pointed out that because ''Coluber sayi'' is a different snake, ''[[Pituophis catenifer sayi]]'', the name ''sayi'' could not be applied to this snake. Therefore, he proposed the name ''Lampropeltis holbrooki'', honoring Holbrook.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank N. Blanchard|Blanchard FN]] (1921). "A Revision of the King Snakes: Genus ''Lampropeltis'' ". ''Bull. U.S. Nat. Mus.'' (114): 1-260.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). ''The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. {{ISBN|978-1-4214-0135-5}}. (''Lampropeltis getula holbrooki'', p. 125).&lt;/ref&gt; It was for many years considered a subspecies of ''L. getula'', but has been elevated to full species status as ''L. holbrooki''.

The Underground Man, in [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]]'s novella ''[[Notes from Underground]]'', is an example of spite. His motivation remains constantly spiteful, undercutting his own existence and ability to live.

In his 1929 examination of emotional disturbances, ''Psychology and Morals: An Analysis of Character'', J. A. Hadfield uses deliberately spiteful acts to illustrate the difference between disposition and sentiment.&lt;ref name=Hadfield&gt;{{Cite web|title = Psychology and Morals: An Analysis of Character |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=T5xACwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA196&amp;lpg=PA196&amp;dq=%22psychology+and+morals%22+analysis+character |website = Google Books preview|accessdate = 2016-05-02|first = J.

'''Structural abuse''' is the process by which an individual is dealt with unfairly by a system of harm in ways that the person cannot protect themselves against, cannot deal with, cannot break out of, cannot mobilise against, cannot seek justice for, cannot redress, cannot avoid, cannot reverse and cannot change.

Every system contains at least one level at which structural abuse occurs, when the actions of the system takes over the actions of individuals within that system to create structures by which abuse of others occurs.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Structural abuse should not be confused with [[structural violence]]. Structural violence refers to action committed by a larger society, such as [[racism]] or [[classism]] in an entire society. Structural abuse refers to actions that are not necessarily endorsed by the broader society.

==Classes==
There are three kinds of structural abuse:
# Imposed interference with an individual's personal space-time-energy control; 
# "Normal" interferences with an individual's ability to control relationships and their construction; 
# Missing connections that harness the physical, mental and emotional energies of a person over a protracted period, thus causing damage to both the relationship and the physical and emotional wellbeing of the person being kept waiting.

Structural abuse is indirect, and exploits the victim on an emotional, mental and psychological level. It manifests itself in specific situations within each cultural, social, corporate and family framework.

== Impacts ==

Structural abuse is also called societal abuse. It has four permanent impacts upon the individuals subjected to it:
* Cognitive abuse by which the meaning of the world is changed forever
* Sexual abuse in which a person's identity is changed for life
* Emotional abuse by which the capability to function in a human manner is impaired
* Physical abuse that is imposed upon an individual or group by a personal, social, commercial or cultural system of dominance.

An example of how surface-level structural abuses are accepted by the community is where a political journalist{{Who|date=August 2011}} in Australia presented a review of the day's work within the Australian Parliament in August 2011. During the one-minute presentation, consisting of 18 points, she began eight new points with the word "Now". "Now" is a fixation cue for viewers to forget about the past and the future, but to concentrate only on the "now" time frame. The use of the word was surplus to the data she presented, and even contradictory to it. The regularity of the word "Now", its placement at the front of each point by which the interpretation of each point is shaped, and the later repetitive use of the word by the anchor journalist steering the news program, who does not normally use such a control habit, showed that the word was a verbal dissociative cue by which hypnotic states are induced.

Other examples include:
*  Standing over another in a dominating manner;
*  Calling people unkind{{clarify|this smacks of appeal to pity and pov terminology|date=May 2014}} names;
*  Snatching belongings of another, refusing to return them immediately;
*  Being late for meetings;
*  Talking over other people, thus excluding them from participating in the discussion;
*  Touching another in a sexual manner without their verbal or body language permission;
*  Punching people on the arm as "a gesture of friendship";
*  Torturing newcomers to the organisation as a form of Rites of Passage.

'''Cues indicating a Structurally Abusive Corporate System'''

Structural Abuse Indicators include the inability of an outsider to make contact on a personal level with the people who work within an organisation. Cafe meetings turn discussions into plagiarisable events, while lack of agendas for high performance meetings create heightened levels of feeling threatened which impacts on how such meetings are approached. Being kept on hold with music blaring down the earpiece is structural abuse because by listening for the resumption of the discussion there is no escape from the sound.

'''Structurally abusive political systems'''

Making promises which are not kept is a category of political structural abuse. Unkept promises fixate the expectations that people create from such promises. Expectations that create physical arousal states and a physical, emotional, intellectual and behavioural mindset by which to accommodate the fulfillment of those promises. When those visualisations of the future and its mobilisation of personal responsiveness is not satisfied in a timely or appropriate manner the result is an extended period of physiological arousal which can turn into stress and emotional depression over time. Hence the anger responses of electorates to the unkept promises of politicians, as well as the frustrated responses of victims of abuses of court processes (e.g. "protective" orders) to the [[abuse of discretion]] exhibited by misfeasant court and law enforcement officers who can claim to be acting under authority or color of law.

'''Community Control Functions of Structural Abuse'''

All categories of structural abuse involve the manipulative control of time, energy, focus and connection between people, groups and organisations, in the service of one side, and to the disservice of the other.

Most people call structural abuse "bad manners" or "rudeness", since it generally breaks conventions by which there is mutual control within each situation.

Each instance of structural abuse breaks down the positive relationship between the two parties, creating for those being abused increasingly negative relationships built on expectations of exploitation, snatching of time, waste of effort, missing redress, and feelings of entrapment from which it is hard to escape.

'''Dealing with structural abuse'''

Structural abuse is helped by talking therapies in which those abused find a listener, and then find their voice by which to begin to remove the power of the abusing system to continue to harm their inner identities.

Currently in most countries, there is no formal [[law]] that has been formulated against structural abuse, protecting the victim from such abuse, and enabling him or her to approach the [[court]] for relevant justice.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

[[File:Pangaea continents.svg|thumb|Map of [[Pangaea]] with modern continental outlines.]]

The '''supercontinent cycle''' is the [[Quasiperiodicity|quasi-periodic]] aggregation and dispersal of [[Earth]]'s [[continental crust]]. There are varying opinions as to whether the amount of continental crust is increasing, decreasing, or staying about the same, but it is agreed that the Earth's crust is constantly being reconfigured. One complete [[supercontinent]] cycle is said to take 300 to 500&amp;nbsp;million years. [[Continental collision]] makes fewer and larger continents while [[rifting]] makes more and smaller continents.

==Description==
[[File:Platetechsimple.png|thumb|right|Simplistic representation of the supercontinent cycle to modern day.]]
{{see also|List of supercontinents}}
The most recent supercontinent, [[Pangaea]], formed about 300&amp;nbsp;million years ago (0.3 Ga). There are two different views on the history of earlier supercontinents. The first proposes a series of supercontinents: [[Vaalbara]] ({{circa}} 3.6 to c. 2.8&amp;nbsp;billion years ago); [[Ur (continent)|Ur]] ({{circa}} 3&amp;nbsp;billion years ago); [[Kenorland]] ({{circa}} 2.7 to 2.1&amp;nbsp;billion years ago); [[Columbia (supercontinent)|Columbia]] ({{circa}} 1.8 to 1.5&amp;nbsp;billion years ago); [[Rodinia]] ({{circa}} 1.25&amp;nbsp;billion to 750&amp;nbsp;million years ago); and [[Pannotia]] ({{circa}} 600&amp;nbsp;million years ago), whose dispersal produced the fragments that ultimately collided to form Pangaea.&lt;ref name="Zhao1"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0012-8252(02)00073-9 |first=Guochun |last=Zhao |last2 = Cawood |first2=Peter A. |last3=Wilde |first3=Simon A. |last4=Sun |first4=M. |year=2002|title=Review of global 2.1–1.8&amp;nbsp;Ga orogens: implications for a pre-Rodinia supercontinent |journal=Earth-Science Reviews |volume=59 |issue=1–4 |pages=125–162 |bibcode=2002ESRv...59..125Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zhao2"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.earscirev.2004.02.003 |first=Guochun |last=Zhao |last2=Sun |first2=M. |last3=Wilde |first3=Simon A. |last4= Li |first4=S.&amp;nbsp;Z. |year=2004|title=A Paleo-Mesoproterozoic supercontinent: assembly, growth and breakup |journal=Earth-Science Reviews |volume=67 |issue=1–2 |pages=91–123 |bibcode=2004ESRv...67...91Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second view (Protopangea-Paleopangea), based on both [[Paleomagnetism|palaeomagnetic]] and geological evidence, is that supercontinent cycles did not occur before about 0.6&amp;nbsp;[[Gigayear#SI prefix multipliers|Ga]] (during the [[Ediacaran]] Period). Instead, the continental crust comprised a single supercontinent from about 2.7&amp;nbsp;Ga (Gigaannum, or "billion years ago") until it broke up for the first time, somewhere around 0.6&amp;nbsp;Ga. This reconstruction&lt;ref name='piper'&gt;{{cite journal|last=Piper |first=J.&amp;nbsp;D.&amp;nbsp;A. |title=A planetary perspective on Earth evolution: Lid Tectonics before Plate Tectonics |journal=Tectonophysics |volume=589 |date=2013 |pages=44–56 |doi= 10.1016/j.tecto.2012.12.042|bibcode=2013Tectp.589...44P }}&lt;/ref&gt; is based on the observation that if only small peripheral modifications are made to the primary reconstruction, the data show that the palaeomagnetic poles converged to quasi-static positions for long intervals between about 2.7–2.2, 1.5–1.25 and 0.75–0.6&amp;nbsp;Ga.&lt;ref name='piper2'&gt;{{cite journal|last=Piper |first=J.&amp;nbsp;D.&amp;nbsp;A. |title=Continental velocity through geological time: the link to magmatism, crustal accretion and episodes of global cooling |journal=Geoscience Frontiers |volume=4 |date=2013 |pages=7–36 |doi= 10.1016/j.gsf.2012.05.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the intervening periods, the poles appear to have conformed to a unified [[apparent polar wander]] path. Thus the paleomagnetic data are adequately explained by the existence of a single Protopangea–Paleopangea supercontinent with prolonged quasi-integrity. The prolonged duration of this supercontinent could be explained by the operation of [[lid tectonics]] (comparable to the tectonics operating on Mars and Venus) during [[Precambrian]] times, as opposed to the [[plate tectonics]] seen on the contemporary Earth.&lt;ref name=piper /&gt;
  
The kinds of minerals found inside ancient diamonds suggest that the cycle of supercontinental formation and breakup began roughly 3.0&amp;nbsp;billion years ago (3.0 Ga). Before 3.2&amp;nbsp;billion years ago only diamonds with [[peridot]]itic compositions (commonly found in the Earth's mantle) formed, whereas after 3.0&amp;nbsp;billion years ago eclogitic diamonds (rocks from the Earth's surface crust) became prevalent. This change is thought to have come about as subduction and continental collision introduced [[eclogite]] into subcontinental diamond-forming fluids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Shirey | first1 = S.&amp;nbsp;B. | last2 = Richardson | first2 = S.&amp;nbsp;H. | doi = 10.1126/science.1206275 | title = Start of the Wilson Cycle at 3&amp;nbsp;Ga Shown by Diamonds from Subcontinental Mantle | journal = Science | volume = 333 | issue = 6041 | pages = 434–436 | year = 2011 | pmid =  21778395| pmc = | bibcode = 2011Sci...333..434S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wilson-cycle hg.svg|thumb|The supercontinent cycle and the Wilson cycle produced the supercontinents Rodinia and Pangaea]]
The hypothesized supercontinent cycle is overlaid by the [[Wilson cycle]] named after [[plate tectonics]] pioneer [[J. Tuzo Wilson]], which describes the periodic opening and closing of [[ocean basin]]s from a single plate rift. The oldest seafloor material found today dates to only 170&amp;nbsp;million years old, whereas the oldest continental crust material found today dates to 4&amp;nbsp;billion years, showing the relative brevity of the regional Wilson cycles compared to the planetary pulse seen in the arrangement of the continents.

==Effects on sea level==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}
It is known that [[sea level]] is generally low when the continents are together and high when they are apart. For example, sea level was low at the time of formation of Pangaea ([[Permian]]) and Pannotia (latest [[Neoproterozoic]]), and rose rapidly to maxima during [[Ordovician]] and [[Cretaceous]] times, when the continents were dispersed. This is because the age of the [[oceanic lithosphere]] provides a major control on the depth of the ocean basins, and therefore on global sea level. Oceanic lithosphere forms at [[mid-ocean ridges]] and moves outwards, [[thermal conduction|conductively cooling]] and [[thermal expansion|shrinking]], which decreases the thickness and increases the density of the oceanic lithosphere, and lowers the seafloor away from mid-ocean ridges. For oceanic lithosphere that is less than about 75&amp;nbsp;million years old, a simple cooling [[Half-space (geometry)|half-space]] model of conductive cooling works, in which the depth of the ocean basins ''d'' in areas in which there is no nearby [[subduction]] is a function of the age of the oceanic lithosphere ''t''. In general,

:&lt;math&gt;d(t) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} a_{\rm eff} T_1 \sqrt{\kappa t} + d_{\rm r}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''κ'' is the [[thermal diffusivity]] of the mantle lithosphere ({{circa}} {{val|8|e=-7|u=[[meter|m]]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/[[second|s]]}}), ''a''&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt; is the effective [[thermal expansion coefficient]] for rock ({{circa}} {{val|5.7|e=-5|u=°C&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}), ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the temperature of ascending magma compared to the temperature at the upper boundary ({{circa}} 1220&amp;nbsp;°C for the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, {{circa}} 1120&amp;nbsp;°C for the eastern Pacific) and ''d''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; is the depth of the ridge below the ocean surface.&lt;ref name="fundamentals"&gt;{{cite journal|last=E.&amp;nbsp;E.|first=Davis|last2=Lister |first2=C.&amp;nbsp;R.&amp;nbsp;B.|title=Fundamentals of Ridge Crest Topography|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|publisher=North-Holland Publishing Company|volume=21|pages=405–413|year=1974|doi=10.1016/0012-821X(74)90180-0|bibcode = 1974E&amp;PSL..21..405D }}&lt;/ref&gt; After plugging in rough numbers for the sea floor, the equation becomes:

:for the eastern Pacific Ocean:
::&lt;math&gt;d(t) = 350 \sqrt{t} + 2500&lt;/math&gt;
::
::and for the Atlantic and Indian Oceans:

::&lt;math&gt;d(t) = 390 \sqrt{t} + 2500&lt;/math&gt;

where ''d'' is in meters and ''t'' is in millions of years, so that just-formed crust at the mid-ocean ridges lies at about 2,500&amp;nbsp;m depth, whereas 50-million-year-old seafloor lies at a depth of about 5,000&amp;nbsp;m.&lt;ref name="analysis"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parsons|first=Barry|last2=Sclater |first2=John G.|title=An analysis of the variation of ocean floor bathymetry and heat flow with age|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|publisher=American Geophysical Union|volume=82|issue=B5|pages=802–827|bibcode=1977JGR....82..802P|year=1977|doi=10.1029/jb082i005p00803}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the mean level of the sea floor decreases, the volume of the ocean basins increases, and if other factors that can control sea level remain constant, sea level falls. The converse is also true: younger oceanic lithosphere leads to shallower oceans and higher sea levels if other factors remain constant.

Area ''A'', of the oceans, can change when continents [[rift]] (stretching the continents decreases A and raises sea level) or as a result of [[continental collision]] (compressing the continents leads to an increase ''A'' and lowers sea level). Increasing sea level will flood the continents, while decreasing sea level will expose  continental shelves.

Because the [[continental shelf]] has a very low slope, a small increase in sea level will result in a large change in the percent of continents flooded.

If the world ocean on average is young, the seafloor will be relatively shallow, and sea level will be high: more of the continents are flooded.  If the world ocean is on average old, seafloor will be relatively deep, and sea level will be low: more of the continents will be exposed.

There is thus a relatively simple relationship between the supercontinent cycle and the mean age of the seafloor.
*Supercontinent = lots of old seafloor = low sea level
*Dispersed continents = lots of young seafloor = high sea level

There will also be a climatic effect of the supercontinent cycle that will amplify this further:
*Supercontinent = continental climate dominant = continental glaciation likely = still lower sea level
*Dispersed continents = maritime climate dominant = continental glaciation unlikely = sea level is not lowered by this mechanism

==Relation to global tectonics==
There is a progression of tectonic regimes that accompany the supercontinent cycle:

During break-up of the supercontinent, rifting environments dominate.  This is followed by passive margin environments, while seafloor spreading continues and the oceans grow.  This in turn is followed by the development of collisional environments that become increasingly important with time.  First collisions are between continents and island arcs, but lead ultimately to continent-continent collisions.  This is the situation that was observed during the Paleozoic supercontinent cycle and is being observed for the [[Mesozoic]]–[[Cenozoic]] supercontinent cycle, still in progress.

==Relation to climate==
&lt;!--{{unreferenced section|date=February 2011}}--&gt;{{refimprove section|date=August 2012}}
{{Main|Greenhouse and icehouse Earth}}
There are two types of global earth climates: icehouse and greenhouse. Icehouse is characterized by frequent continental glaciations and severe desert environments.  Greenhouse is characterized by warm climates. Both reflect the supercontinent cycle.  It is now a short greenhouse phase of an icehouse world.&lt;ref name="Read, PhD"&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Record of ancient climates can be a map to riches| first = J.

Periods of icehouse climate: much of [[Neoproterozoic]], late [[Paleozoic]], late [[Cenozoic]].

Periods of greenhouse climate: Early [[Paleozoic]], [[Mesozoic]]–early [[Cenozoic]].

==Relation to evolution==
The principal mechanism for evolution is natural selection among diverse populations.  As [[genetic drift]] occurs more frequently in small populations, diversity is an observed consequence of isolation. Less isolation, and thus less diversification, occurs when the continents are all together, producing both one continent and one ocean with one coast. In Latest Neoproterozoic to Early Paleozoic times, when the tremendous proliferation of diverse [[Animal|metazoa]] occurred, isolation of marine environments resulted from the breakup of Pannotia.

A north–south arrangement of continents and oceans leads to much more diversity and isolation than east–west arrangements.  North-to-south arrangements give climatically different zones along the communication routes to the north and south, which are separated by water or land from other continental or oceanic zones of similar climate.  Formation of similar tracts of continents and ocean basins oriented east–west would lead to much less isolation, diversification, and slower evolution, since each continent or ocean is in fewer climatic zones.  Through the [[Cenozoic]], isolation has been maximized by a north–south arrangement.

Diversity, as measured by the number of families, follows the supercontinent cycle very well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Benton|first=Michael J.|title=Fossil Record: Quality|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/npg.els.0004144|work=eLS (Encyclopedia of Life Sciences)|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|doi=10.1038/npg.els.0004144|date=23 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tact''' is a term that [[B.F. Skinner]] used to describe a verbal [[operant]] which is controlled by a nonverbal stimulus (such as an object, event, or property of an object) and is maintained by nonspecific social reinforcement ([[praise]]).&lt;ref name="Skinner"&gt;{{cite book|author=Skinner, B.F.|year=1957|title=Verbal Behavior|publisher=Appleton Century Croft}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Less technically, a tact is a label. For example, a child may see their pet dog and say "dog"; the nonverbal stimulus (dog) evoked the response "dog" which is maintained by praise (or generalized conditioned reinforcement) "you're right, that is a dog!"

Chapter five of Skinner's ''[[Verbal Behavior]]'' discusses the tact in depth. A tact is said to "make contact with" the world, and refers to behavior that is under the control of generalized [[reinforcement]]. The controlling antecedent [[stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] is [[nonverbal]], and constitutes some portion of "the whole of the physical environment." &lt;ref name="Skinner" /&gt;

The tact described by Skinner includes three important and related events, known as the 3-term-contingency: a stimulus, a response, and a consequence, in this case reinforcement.&lt;ref name="Skinner" /&gt; A verbal response is occasioned by the presence of a stimulus, such as when you say "ball" in the presence of a ball. In this scenario, "ball" is more likely to be reinforced by the listener than saying "cat", showing the importance of the third event, reinforcement, in relation to the stimulus (ball) and response ("ball"). Although the stimulus controls the response, it is the verbal community which establishes the stimulus' control over the verbal response of the speaker. For example, a child may say "ball" in the presence of a ball (stimulus), the child's parent may respond "yes, that is a ball", (reinforcement) thereby increasing the probability that the child will say ball in the presence of a ball in the future. On the other hand, if the parent never responds to the child saying "ball" in the presence of a ball then the probability of that response will decrease in the future.

A tact may be pure or impure. For example, if the environmental stimulus evokes the response, the tact would be considered pure. If the tact is evoked by a verbal stimulus the resulting tact would be considered impure. For example, if a child is shown a picture of a dog, and emits the response "dog" this would be an example of a pure tact. If a child is shown a picture of a dog, and is given the verbal instruction "what is this?" then the response "dog" would be considered an impure tact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Bondy, A., Tincani, M., Frost, L.|year=2004|title=Multiply controlled verbal operants: An analysis and extension to the picture exchange communication system|journal=The Behavior Analyst|volume=27|issue=2|pages=247–261|pmc=2755401|pmid=22478433}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tact can be extended, as in generic, metaphorical, metonymical, solecistic, nomination, and "guessing" tact. It can also be involved in [[abstraction]]. Lowe, Horne, Harris &amp; Randle (2002) would be one example of recent work in tacts.

==Extensions==
The tact is said to be capable of generic extension. Generic extension is essentially an example of stimulus generalization. The novel stimulus contains all of the relevant features of the original stimulus. For example, we may see a red car and say "car" as well as see a white car and say "car". Different makes and models of cars will all evoke the same response "car".&lt;ref name="Cooper"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Cooper,  J.C., Heron, T.E., &amp; Heward, W.L.|year=2007|title=Applied Behavior Analysis|edition=2nd|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=978-0131421134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tacts can be extended metaphorically; in this case the novel stimulus has only some of the defining features of the original stimulus. For example, when we describe something as "exploding with taste" by drawing the common property of an explosion with the response to our having eaten something (perhaps a strong response, or a sudden one).&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt;

Tacts can undergo metonymical extension when some irrelevant but related feature of the original stimulus controls a response. In metonymical extension, one word often replaces another; we may replace a part for a whole. For example, saying "refrigerator" when shown a picture of a kitchen, or saying "White house" in place of "President."&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt;

When controlling variables unrelated to standard or immediate reinforcement take over control of the tact, it is said to be solecistically extended. Malapropisms, solecism and catachresis are examples of this.&lt;ref name="Skinner" /&gt;

Skinner notes things like serial order, or conspicuous features of an object, may come to play as nominative tacts. A proper name may arise as a result of the tact. For example, a house that is haunted becomes "The Haunted House" as a nominative extension to the tact of its being haunted.&lt;ref name="Skinner" /&gt;

A guess may seemingly be the emission of a response in the absence of controlling stimuli. Skinner notes that this may simply be a tact under more subtle or hidden controlling variables, although this is not always the case in something like guessing the landing side of a coin toss, where the possible alternatives are fixed and there is no subtle or hidden stimuli to control responses.&lt;ref name="Skinner" /&gt;

==Special conditions affecting stimulus control==
Skinner deals with factors that interfere with, or change, generalized reinforcement. It is these conditions which, in turn, affect verbal behavior which may depend largely or entirely on generalized reinforcement. In children with developmental disabilities, tacts may need intensive training procedures to develop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Pereira-Delgado, J.A. &amp; Oblak, M.|year=2007|title=The Effects of Daily Intensive Tact Instruction on the Emission of Pure Mands and Tacts in Non-Instructional Settings by Three Preschool Children with Developmental Delays|journal=Journal of early and Intensive Behavioral Intervention|volume=4|issue=2|pages=392–411|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/eib/4/2/392/|doi=10.1037/h0100381}}&lt;/ref&gt; Factors such as [[Poverty|deprivation]], emotional conditions and personal history may interfere with or change verbal behavior. Skinner mentions alertness, irrelevant emotional variables, "special circumstances" surrounding particular listeners or speakers, etc. (He refers to the conditions which are said to produce objective and subjective responses for example). We would now look at these as motivating operations/establishing conditions.

Under [[wikt:emersion|emersion]] conditions tacts will frequently emerge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Tsiouri, I. &amp; Greer, R.D.|year=2007|title=The Role of Different Social Reinforcement Contingencies in Inducing Echoic Tacts Through Motor Imitation Responding in Children with Severe Language Delays|journal=Journal of Early and Intensive Behavior Intervention|volume=4|issue=4|pages=229–48|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ805694|doi=10.1037/h0100397}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in children with disabilities, more intensive training procedures are often needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Schauffler, G. &amp; Greer, R.D.|year=2006|title=The Effects of Intensive Tact Instruction on Audience-Accurate Tacts and Conversational Units|journal=JEIBI|volume=3|issue=1|pages=121–7|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ843635|doi=10.1037/h0100326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distortion==
Distorted [[stimulus control]] may be minor as when a description (tact) is a slight exaggeration. Under stronger conditions of distortion, it may appear when the original stimulus is absent, as in the case of the response called a lie. Skinner notes that [[troubadour]]s and fiction writers are perhaps both motivated by similar forms of tact distortion. Initially, they may recount real events, but as differential reinforcement affects the account we may see distortion and then total fabrication.&lt;ref name="Skinner" /&gt;

==Tact training==
Often, individuals with autism, developmental disabilities, or language delays have difficulty acquiring novel tacts. Many researchers in the field of verbal behavior and developmental disabilities have examined more intensive training procedures in order to teach tacts to these individuals. Specific types of prompts can be used in order to make a tact response more likely. For example, asking the student the question "what is this?" (this would be an example of an impure tact) has been used to prompt a correct tact response (this prompt can be faded until the learner can emit a pure tact). Echoic prompts (teacher repeats the correct answer which the learner must echo) have also been used to train tact responses. Kodak and Clements (2009) found that echoic training sessions before tact training was more effective at increasing independent tact responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Kodak, T., &amp; Clements, A.|year=2009|title=Acquisition of mands and tacts with concurrent echoic training|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|volume=42|pages=839–842|doi=10.1901/jaba.2009.42-839|pmc=2790939|pmid=20514191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skinner (1957) suggested that verbal operants were functionally independent, meaning that after teaching one verbal operant the individual may not be able to emit the topographically same response under different stimulus conditions. For example, a child may be able to request water, but may not be able to tact water. Researchers are currently examining procedures that may facilitate the generalization across verbal operants. Some studies have indicated, for example, that after teaching a child to [[Mand (psychology)|mand]] for items, they could then tact them as well without direct instruction. Multiple studies have found support for the emergence of tact responses without direct instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Egan, C. E., &amp; Barnes-Holmes, D.|year=2009|title=Emergence of tacts following mand training in young children with autism|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|volume=42|issue=3|pages=691–696|doi= 10.1901/jaba.2009.42-691|pmc=2741075|pmid=20190930}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Greer, R. D., Chavez-Brown, M., &amp; Rivera-Valdes, C.|year=2005|title=The emergence of the listener to speaker component of naming in children as a function of multiple exemplar instruction|journal=The Analysis of Verbal Behavior|volume=21|issue=1|pages=123–134|pmc=2774093|pmid=22477318}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Petursdottir, A. I., Carr, J. E., &amp; Michael, J.|year=2005|title=Emergence of mands and tacts of novel objects among preschool children|journal=The Analysis of Verbal Behavior|volume=21|issue=1|pages=59–74|pmc=2774104|pmid=22477314}}&lt;/ref&gt; These teaching procedures are especially important for individuals with autism and developmental disabilities because the learner can gain additional skills without direct instruction time.

'''Terry O'Gorman''' is a lawyer in [[Queensland, Australia]] and is the president of the [[Australian Council for Civil Liberties]]. In 1979, O'Gorman was elected President of the [[Queensland Council for Civil Liberties]] and served as president until 1985. He again held presidency from 1990 to 1994. He is currently the Vice President of the QCCL. 

O'Gorman specialises in [[criminal law]], yet it was the area of Aboriginal Aid in which he first commenced his legal career. An influential member of the QCCL, "it was during the days as a university student and under the rule of Joh Bjelke-Petersen that he first became aware of the need to protect civil rights." In 2003 he pleaded guilty to drink driving after the vehicle he was driving rolled in to a police car. In 2008 O'Gorman commented that "civil liberties on the streets have improved, but the battle has moved to a 'law and order auction' being played out in the media, which used to be centred around the political cycle but now appears to be a permanent fixture."&lt;ref name="Criminal Lawyer Terry O 2008"&gt;"Civil Libertarian and Criminal Lawyer Terry O'Gorman" ABC Local conversations with Richard Fidler 7 Aug 2008. Abc.net.au. Web. 7 May. 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Raised in Brisbane, he was one of 15 children raised in a Catholic family which included two police officers, another lawyer, and three nuns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/queensland/stories/s1486071.htm |title=Policeman John "Bluey" O'Gorman :: ABC Queensland |publisher=Abc.net.au |date= |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; His upbringing could be described as right wing. As a university student during the [[Joh Bjelke Petersen|Bjelke Petersen]] years, O'Gorman became aware of the need to fight for human rights. His early working years were spent with [[Aboriginal Legal Aid]]. It was there that he noticed the brutal treatment of indigenous Australians at the hands of the police. Taking matters into their own hands, O'Gorman and colleagues began secretly taping the police. This resulted in a number of miscarriage of justice cases being proved. 

By cross-examining [[Joh Bjelke Petersen]] during the [[Fitzgerald Inquiry]], he was instrumental in changing the thinking and mindset of judges and politicians who refused to believe that the police were abusing their positions of power.&lt;ref&gt;612 ABC Brisbane [http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2008/08/07/2327794.htm Civil libertarian and Criminal lawyer Terry O'Gorman]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
In later years O'Gorman became involved in the Australian Council of Civil Liberties. He has also been involved in a number of issues involving racism, treatment of asylum-seekers,&lt;ref&gt;ABC the World today [http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/stories/s334626.htm Push for tagging of asylum seekers, Reporter: Joe O'Brien]&lt;/ref&gt; the introduction of the [[Smart Card]] &lt;ref&gt;Sydney Morning Herald [http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Smartcard-plan-sparks-privacy-fearss/2005/04/21/1114028476868.html Smartcard plan sparks privacy fears 21 April 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Go card]].&lt;ref&gt;goldcoast.com.au News Gold Coast [http://www.goldcoast.com.au/article/2010/07/30/243451_gold-coast-news.html Gold Coast go card privacy warning Jessica Johnston | 30 July 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; He has also been critical of the way that Australia's police have dealt with indigenous Australians, and the resulting [[Deaths in custody]].&lt;ref&gt;ABC Stateline [http://www.abc.net.au/news/video/2010/07/09/2949831.htm deaths in custody in Qld]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent activities==
In July 2010 it was reported in major newspapers around Australia that people have had their movements tracked by using the Go Card. It had turned out that Australian police had been accessing the Go Card records to find out about the movements of certain people.  O'Gorman had commented that he wasn't surprised that the police were accessing Go Card records, stating that previous concerns asserting that Go Cards would be used for surveillance had been justified.&lt;ref name="brisbanetimes.com.au"&gt;Brisbane Times [http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/police-watching-where-you-go-20100728-10vx2.html Police watching where you Go, Sean Baugmart]&lt;/ref&gt; O'Gorman also stated that he was unsure if his Go Card was registered, as his wife had obtained it for him, but added that he would be de-registering it.&lt;ref name="brisbanetimes.com.au"/&gt; As of August 2010, Queensland Police were set to appeal to the state’s privacy commissioner  not to cut their access to the movements of Brisbane's commuters that were recorded on the Go Cards.&lt;ref&gt;Brisbane Times [http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/atkinson-to-ask-privacy-commissioner-not-to-cut-access-to-go-cards-20100801-1116i.html Atkinson to ask privacy commissioner not to cut access to Go Cards, Courtney Trnwith]&lt;/ref&gt; 
As a result, O'Gorman has been watching closely the developments that have been taking place.

A '''truth claim''' is a proposition or statement that a particular person or [[belief system]] holds to be true. The term is commonly used in philosophy in discussions of [[logic]], [[metaphysics]], and [[epistemology]], particularly when discussing the [[Doctrine|doctrinal]] statements of religions; however, it is also used when discussing non-religious [[Ideology|ideologies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=people of every religion, as well as of no religion, have a reason for wanting it to be possible to face other people with challenges to their faith, namely that this is the only way those people can be brought to see the truth.|author1=Michael Herz|author2=Peter Molnar|title=The Content and Context of Hate Speech: Rethinking Regulation and Responses|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KC0gAwAAQBAJ|date=9 April 2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-37561-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==

=== Positive and negative ===
A major division of truth claims is that between positive and negative truth claims. Positive truth claims proclaim the existence of an object or [[entity]]. Negative truth claims, which are the opposite of truth claims, proclaim the non-existence of an object or [[entity]].

== Religions ==
{{anchor|In religion}}
Some religions make strong [[Absolute truth|absolutist]] truth claims about the [[Laws of science|laws of nature]] and [[human nature]] while others make [[Relativism|relativist]] or [[Universalism|universalist]] truth claims.

===Hinduism===
{{anchor|Hindu}}
In the post-modern period Hinduism is generally known to be Universalist and accepts
all other religions to be true and valid. [[Mahatma Gandhi]] is credited to be the original proponent. However, this seems to be true from a socio-political perspective, since Hinduism itself is a congregation of large numbers of individual sects and peoples that have long lived in harmony among themselves without persecuting each other. But if one goes into what is in the scriptures of
more organised Hindu sects like Vedanta; we do find exclusive truth claims.

Bhagavad Gita says -

''ye me matamidaM nityamanutishhThanti maanavaaH .&lt;br /&gt;''
''shraddhaavanto.anasuuyanto muchyante te.api karmabhiH .. 3.31''

Those who continuously practice what I preach they will be freed from Karma.

''ye tvetadabhyasuuyanto naanutishhThanti me matam.h .&lt;br /&gt;''
''sarvaGYaanavimuuDhaa.nstaanviddhi nashhTaanachetasaH .. 3.32''

But those who, out of envy, disregard these teachings and do not practice them regularly, are to be considered bereft of all knowledge, befooled, and doomed to ignorance and bondage.

A Hindu is expected to examine a truth claim based on his intellect. He can add or improve upon the vast ocean of Hindu philosophy. This is unlike religions such as [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]], where, because of the truth claim is endowed as infallible, a contradiction of single verse is a contradiction of the entire claim.

Traditionally Hinduism (more specifically Vedanta) considers itself to be eternal religion (Sanatana Dharma).  Fundamental belief is that all beings are divine, that the human condition is one of ignorance to not recognize this divinity inside, and that direct experience of God is achievable for all human beings.

== Science ==
{{Main|Philosophy of science}}
It has been debated as to whether science makes any truth claims of its own, or if it is a set of [[Scientific method|methods]] for evaluating or [[Falsifiability|falsifying]] other truth claims.

=== Agnosticism ===
Agnosticism makes the claim that the existence or non-existence of any deity is unknown and possibly unknowable.  This is a claim about what we can or do know, not a metaphysical claim as to the nature of the world.

===Atheism===
{{Main|Negative and positive atheism}}
The truth claims of atheism are divided between negative atheism, which does not accept the positive truth claims of religions, and positive atheism, which specifically claims the non-existence of deities (and other spiritual phenomena).

It opened in the [[Neoproterozoic|Late Neoproterozoic]] and closed in the [[Paleozoic|Early Paleozoic]].]]
The '''Wilson cycle''' is a model where a [[continent]] [[rift]]s, forms an [[ocean basin]] in-between, and then begins a process of [[Convergent boundary|convergence]] that leads to the [[continental collision|collision]] of the two plates and closure of the ocean.  The model is named after its originator [[John Tuzo Wilson]]. It has been suggested that Wilson cycles on Earth started about 3 [[gigaannum|Ga]] (3 billion years) ago in the [[Archean|Archean Eon]] of Earth's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shirey |first1=Steven B. |last2=Richardson |first2=Stephen H. |date=2011 |title=Start of the Wilson Cycle at 3 Ga Shown by Diamonds from Subcontinental Mantle |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/333/6041/434 |journal=Science |volume= 333 |issue= 6041 |pages=434-436 |doi= 10.1126/science.1206275  |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Wilson cycle is not the same as a [[supercontinent cycle]], which is the break-up of one [[supercontinent]] and the development of another and takes place on a global scale. The Wilson cycle rarely synchronizes with the timing of a supercontinent cycle.&lt;ref name='rogers'&gt;Rogers, John J.W., and M. Santosh. Continents and Supercontinents. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2004.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="110002">[[File:Leffler - WomensLib1970 WashingtonDC (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|400px|The Women's Liberation Movement featured political activities such as  a march demanding legal equality for women in the United States. (26 August 1970)]]

The '''women's liberation movement''' ('''WLM''') was a political alignment of women and [[feminism|feminist]] [[intellectualism]] that emerged in the late 1960s and continued into the 1980s primarily in the industrialized nations of the Western world, which effected great change (political, intellectual, cultural) throughout the world. The WLM branch of [[Radical feminism]], based in [[contemporary philosophy]], comprised women of racially- and culturally-diverse backgrounds who proposed that economic, psychological, and social freedom were necessary for women to progress from being second-class citizens in their societies.{{sfn|''New Fontana''|1999|pp=314}}

Towards achieving the equality of women, the WLM questioned the cultural and legal validity of [[patriarchy]] and the practical validity of the social and sexual [[Hierarchy|hierarchies]] used to control and limit the legal and physical independence of women in society. Women's liberationists proposed that [[sexism]] — legalised formal and informal sex-based discrimination predicated on the existence of the social construction of gender — was the principal political problem with the power dynamics of their societies. In general, the WLM proposed socio-economic change from the [[Left-wing politics|political Left]], rejected the idea that piece-meal equality, within and according to [[social class]], would eliminate sexual discrimination against women, and fostered the tenets of [[humanism]], especially the respect for [[human rights]] of all people. In the decades during which the Women's Liberation Movement flourished, liberationists successfully changed how women were perceived in their cultures, redefined the socio-economic and the political roles of women in society, and transformed mainstream society.{{sfn|''New Fontana''|1999|pp=315}}
{{Feminism sidebar |expanded=Suffrage}}

== Background ==
The [[Social cycle theory|wave theory of social development]] holds that intense periods of social activity are followed by periods of remission, in which the activists involved intensely in mobilization are systematically marginalized and isolated.{{sfn|Taylor|1989|p=762}} After the intense period fighting for [[women's suffrage]], the common interest which had united international feminists left the women's movement without a single focus upon which all could agree. Ideological differences between radicals and moderates, led to a split and a period of deradicalization, with the largest group of women's activists spearheading movements to educate women on their new responsibilities as voters. Organizations like the [[African National Congress Women's League]],{{sfn|Walker|1991|p=83}} the [[Irish Housewives Association]],{{sfn|Connolly|1997|p=109}} the [[League of Women Voters]], the [[Townswomen's Guild]]s and the [[Women's Institutes]] supported women and tried to educate them on how to use their new rights to incorporate themselves into the established political system.{{sfn|Taylor|1989|pp=763–764}}{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=5}} Still other organizations, involved in the mass movement of women into the work force during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] and their subsequent exit at the end of the war with concerted official efforts to return to family life, turned their efforts to labor issues.{{sfn|Taylor|1989|p=764}} The [[World YWCA]] and [[Zonta International]], were leaders in these efforts, mobilizing women to gather information on the situation of working women and organize assistance programs.{{sfn|Hannan|2008|p=175}}{{sfn|Elias|1979|p=9}} Increasingly, radical organizations, like the American [[National Women's Party]], were marginalized, by media which denounced feminism and its proponents as "severe neurotics responsible for the problems of" society. Those who were still attached to the radical themes of equality were typically unmarried, employed, socially and economically advantaged and seemed to the larger society to be deviant.{{sfn|Taylor|1989|p=765}}

In countries throughout Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, the Middle East and South America efforts to decolonize and replace authoritarian regimes, which largely began in the 1950s and stretched through the 1980s, initially saw the state overtaking the role of radical feminists. For example, in Egypt, the 1956 Constitution eliminated gender barriers to labour, political access, and education through provisions for gender equality.{{sfn|Al-Ali|2002|p=8}} Women in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Cuba, Nicaragua and other [[Latin America]]n countries had worked for an end to dictatorships in their countries. As those governments turned to socialist policies, the state aimed to eliminate gender inequality through state action.{{sfn|Russell|2012|p=19}} As ideology in Asia, Africa and the Caribbean shifted left, women in newly independent and still colonized countries saw a common goal in fighting imperialism. They focused their efforts to address gendered power imbalances in their quest for respect of human rights and nationalist goals.{{sfn|Armstrong|2016|p=305}}{{sfn|Sanatan|2016}}{{sfn|Neptune|2011}} This worldwide movement towards decolonization and the realignment of international politics into [[Cold War]] camps after the end of World War II, usurped the drive for women's enfranchisement, as universal suffrage and nationhood became the goal for activists.{{sfn|Rubio-Marín|2014}} A Pan-African awareness and global recognition of blackness as a unifying point for struggle, led to a recognition by numerous marginalized groups that there was potential to politicize their oppression.{{sfn|Bagneris|2011|p=4}}

In their attempt to influence these newly independent countries to align with the United States, in the polarized Cold War climate, [[racism]] in U.S. policy became a stumbling block to the foreign policy objective to become the dominant [[superpower]]. Black leaders were aware of the favorable climate for securing change and pushed forward the [[Civil Rights Movement]] to address racial inequalities.{{sfn|Morris|1999|pp=522–524}} They sought to eliminate the damage of oppression, using [[Liberation psychology|liberation theory]] and a movement which sought to create societal transformation in the way people thought about others by infusing the disenfranchised with political power to change the power structures.{{sfn|Curthoys|2003|p=1}} The [[Black Power movement]] and global student movements protested the apparent double standards of the age and the authoritarian nature of social institutions.{{sfn|Barker|2008|pp=44–45, 50}} From [[Czechoslovakia]] to [[Mexico 68|Mexico]], in diverse locations like Germany, France, Italy, and Japan, among others, students protested the civil, economic and political inequalities, as well as involvement in the [[Vietnam War]].{{sfn|Barker|2008|pp=48–50}} Many of the activists participating in these causes would go on to participate in the feminist movement.{{sfn|Bullock|2010|p=4}}

Socially, the [[Baby boomers|baby boom]] experienced after World War II, the relative worldwide economic growth in the post-war years, the expansion of the television industry sparking improved communications, as well as access to higher education for both women and men led to an awareness of the social problems women faced and the need for a cultural change.{{sfn|Magarey|2014|p=16}} At the time, women were economically dependent on men and neither the concept of [[patriarchy]] nor a coherent theory about the power relationships between men and women in society existed.{{sfn|Bradshaw|2013|pp=391–392}} If they worked, positions available to women were typically in light manufacturing or agricultural work and a limited segment of positions in the service industries, such as bookkeeping, domestic labor, nursing, secretarial and clerical work, retail sales, or school teaching.{{sfn|Cheal|2003|p=70}}{{sfn|Backhouse|Flaherty|1992|pp=218–219}} They were expected to work for lower wages than men and upon marriage, terminate their employment.{{sfn|Mioko|1978|p=77}}{{sfn|Cheal|2003|p=70}}{{sfn|Backhouse|Flaherty|1992|pp=218–219}} Women were unable to obtain bank accounts or credit, making renting housing impossible, without a man's consent. In many countries they were not allowed to go into public spaces without a male chaperone.{{sfn|Enke|2007|p=6}}

Married women from countries founded the British colonial system and thus with a legal code based on English law were legally bound to have sex with their husbands upon demand. Marital rape was not a concept, as under law women had given consent to regular intercourse upon marrying.{{sfn|Cook|2004|p=2}} The state and church, placed enormous pressure on young women to retain their virginity. Introduction of the pill, gave many men a sense that as women could not get pregnant, they could not say no to intercourse.{{sfn|Cook|2004|p=3}} Though by the 1960s the pill was widely available, prescription was tightly controlled and in many countries, dissemination of information about birth control was illegal.{{sfn|Nilsson|Spencer|2015}} Even after the pill was legalized, contraception remained banned in numerous countries, like Ireland where condoms were banned and the pill could only be prescribed to control menstrual cycles.{{sfn|Franks|2013|p=46}} The Catholic Church issued the encyclical ''[[Humanae vitae]]'' in 1968, reiterating the ban on [[Birth control|artificial contraception]].{{sfn |Rengel|2000|p=202}} Abortion often required the consent of a spouse,{{sfn|Magarey|2014|p=241}} or approval by a board, like in Canada, wherein the decisions often revolved around whether pregnancy posed a threat to the woman's health or life.{{sfn|Sethna|Hewitt|2009|pp=469–470}}

As women became more educated and joined the work force, their home responsibilities remained largely unchanged. Though families increasingly depended on dual incomes, women carried most of the responsibility for domestic work and care of children.{{sfn|Adamson|Briskin|McPhail|1988|pp=37–38}} There had long been recognition by society in general of the inequalities in civil, socio-economic, and political agency between women and men. However, the Women's Liberation Movement was the first time that the idea of challenging [[sexism]] gained wide acceptance.{{sfn|Bucy|2010|p=306}} Literature on sex, such as the [[Kinsey Reports]], and the development and distribution of the [[birth control pill]], created a climate wherein women began to question the authority others wielded over their decisions regarding their bodies and their morality.{{sfn|Magarey|2014|p=17}} Many of the women who participated in the movement, were aligned with leftist politics and after 1960, with the development of Cold War polarization, took their inspiration from [[Maoist theory]]. Slogans such as "workers of the world unite" turned into "women of the world unite" and key features like consciousness-raising and egalitarian consensus-based policies "were inspired by similar techniques used in China".{{sfn|Hathaway|2018}}{{sfn|Roseneil, et al.|2010|p=136-137}}

Into this backdrop of world events, [[Simone de Beauvoir]] published ''[[The Second Sex]]'' in 1949, which was translated into English in 1952. In the book, de Beauvoir put forward the idea that equality did not require women be masculine to become empowered.{{sfn|Bergoffen|2004}} With her famous statement, "One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman", she laid the groundwork for the concept of [[gender]] as a social construct, as opposed to a biological trait.{{sfn|Butler|1986|p=35}} The same year, [[Margaret Mead]] published ''[[Male and Female (book)|Male and Female]]'', which though it analyzed primitive societies of New Guinea, showed that gendered activities varied between cultures and that biology had no role in defining which tasks were performed by men or women. By 1965, de Beauvoir and Mead's works had been translated into Danish and became widely influential with feminists.{{sfn|Larsen|2014}}{{sfn|Tobias|1997}}  [[Kurahashi Yumiko]] published her debut ''Partei'' in 1960, which critically examined the student movement.{{sfn|Bullock|2010|p=13}} The work started a trend in Japan of feminist works which challenged the opportunities available to women and mocked conventional power dynamics in Japanese society.{{sfn|Bullock|2010|pp=50–51}} In 1963, [[Betty Friedan]] published ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'', voicing the discontent felt by American women.{{sfn|Fox|2006}}

== Aims ==
As the [[Women's Suffrage]] movement emerged from the [[Abolitionism|Abolition Movement]], the Women's Liberation Movement grew out of the struggle for civil rights.{{sfn|Wiegers|1970|p=50}}{{sfn|''The Dayton Daily News''|1969|p=11}} Though challenging patriarchy and the anti-patriarchal message of the Women's Liberation Movement was considered radical, it was not the only, nor the first, radical movement in the early period of [[second-wave feminism]].{{sfn|Thompson|2002|pp=344–345}} Rather than simply desiring legal equality, those participating in the movement believed that the moral and social climate which perceived women as second-class citizens needed to change. Though most groups operated independently—there were no national umbrella organizations—there were unifying philosophies of women participating in the movement. Challenging patriarchy and the hierarchical organization of society which defined women as subordinate in both public and private spheres, liberationists believed that women should be free to define their own individual identity as part of human society.{{sfn|Wiegers|1970|p=50}}{{sfn|''The Dayton Daily News''|1969|p=11}}{{sfn|Studer|2017|p=15-16}}

One of the reasons that women who supported the movement chose not to create a single approach to addressing the problem of women being treated as second-class citizens was that they did not want to foster an idea that anyone was an expert or that any one group or idea could address all of the societal problems women faced.{{sfn|Foley|1971|p=22}} They also wanted women, whose voices had been silenced to be able to express their own views on solutions.{{sfn|Bennett|1970|p=40}} Rejecting authority and espousing participatory democracy as well as direct action, they promoted a wide agenda including civil rights, eliminating objectification of women, ethnic empowerment, granting women reproductive rights, increasing opportunities for women in the workplace, peace, and redefining familial roles, as well as gay and lesbian liberation.{{sfn|Wiegers|1970|p=50}} A dilemma faced by movement members was how they could challenge the definition of femininity without compromising the principals of feminism.{{sfn|Wiegers|1970|p=50}}{{sfn|Sethna|Hewitt|2009|p=466}}

Women's historical participation in the world was virtually unknown, even to trained historians.{{sfn|Myrbråten|2013|p=20-21}}{{sfn|DuBois|1998|p=10}} Women's roles in historic events were not covered in academic texts and not taught in schools. Even the fact that women had been denied the vote was something few university students were aware of in the era.{{sfn|Lee|2014}}{{sfn|Hannam|2008}} To understand the wider implications of women's experiences, WLM groups launched [[women's studies]] programs introducing feminist history, sociology and psychology to higher education and adult education curricula to counter gender biases in teaching these subjects.{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=76-77}} Writing women back into history became extremely important in the period with attention to the differences of experiences based on class, ethnic background, race and sexual orientation.{{sfn|Hannam|2008}} The courses became widespread by the end of the decade in Britain, Canada and the United States, and were also introduced in such places as Italy and Norway.{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=76-77}}

Thousands of adherents joined the movement which began in the United States{{sfn|Enke|2007|p=2}} and spread to Canada and Mexico.{{sfn|Sethna|Hewitt|2009|p=466}}{{sfn|González Alvarado|2002|p=56}} In Europe, movements developed in Austria{{sfn|''Der Funke''|2003}} Belgium,{{sfn|Jacques|2013}} Denmark,{{sfn|Dahlerup|2017}} England,{{sfn|Barber, et al.|2013}} France,{{sfn|Picq|2008}} Germany,{{sfn|Perincioli|Selwyn|2015}} Greece,{{sfn|''Greek News Agenda''|2017}} Iceland,{{sfn|Haavio-Mannila|Skard|2013|p=27}} Ireland,{{sfn|Cosgrove|2008|p=882}} Italy,{{sfn|Radical Party Archive|1972}} The Netherlands,{{sfn|Foley|1971|p=22}} Northern Ireland,{{sfn|Aughey|Morrow|2014|p=173}} Norway,{{sfn|Haavio-Mannila|Skard|2013|p=28}} Portugal,{{sfn|Pena|2008}} Scotland,{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=4}} Spain,{{sfn|Morgan|1984|p=626}} Sweden,{{sfn|Haavio-Mannila|Skard|2013|p=28}} Switzerland{{sfn|Joris|2008}} and Wales.{{sfn|Rolph|2002}} The liberationist movement also was active in Australia,{{sfn|Magarey|2014|pp=25–26}} Fiji,{{sfn|Griffen|Yee|1987|p=1}} Guam,{{sfn|''The Ladder''|1972|p=47}} India,{{sfn|Omvedt|1975|p=40}} Israel,{{sfn|Ram|2012|p=150}} Japan,{{sfn|Shigematsu|2012|p=ix}} New Zealand,{{sfn|Cook|2011}} Singapore,{{sfn|Lyons|2000}} South Korea,{{sfn|Kim|2000|pp=220-221}} and Taiwan.{{sfn|Chiang|Liu|2011|p=559}}

Key components of the movement were [[consciousness-raising]] sessions aimed at politicizing personal issues,{{sfn|Spain|2016|p=51}}{{sfn|Sethna|Hewitt|2009|pp=468–469}} small group and limited organizational structure{{sfn|Magarey|2014|pp=29–30}} and a focus on changing societal perception rather than reforming legislation.{{sfn|Elias|1979|p=9}} For example, liberationists did not support reforming family codes to allow abortion, instead, they believed that neither medical professionals nor the state should have the power to limit women's complete control of their own bodies.{{sfn|Bracke|2014|p=85}} They favored abolishing laws which limited women's rights over their reproduction, believing such control was an individual right, not subject to moralistic majority views.{{sfn|Pena|2008|p=108}} Most liberationists banned the participation of men in their organizations.{{sfn|Magarey|2014|pp=27–28}}{{sfn|Sethna|Hewitt|2009|p=467}} Though often depicted in media as a sign of "man-hating", separation was a focused attempt to eliminate defining women via their relationship to men. Since women's inequality within their employment, family and society were commonly experienced by all women, separation meant unity of purpose to evaluate their second-class status.{{sfn|Adamson|Briskin|McPhail|1988|p=8}}

== Development ==
=== North America ===
{{Main|Women's liberation movement in North America}}
In Canada and the United States, the movement developed out of the [[Civil Rights Movement]], Anti-War sentiment toward the Vietnam War, the [[Indigenous rights|Native Rights Movement]] and the [[New Left]] student movement of the 1960s.{{sfn|Sethna|Hewitt|2009|p=466}}{{sfn|Sklar|2015}}{{sfn|Adamson|Briskin|McPhail|1988|p=39}} Between 1965 and 1966, papers presented at meetings of the [[Students for a Democratic Society]] and articles published in journals, such as the Canadian ''Random'' began advocating for women to embark on a path of self-discovery free from male scrutiny.{{sfn|Yates|1975|p=7}} In 1967, the first Women's Liberation organizations formed in major cities like Berkeley, Boston, Chicago, New York City and Toronto.{{sfn|Yates|1975|pp=7–8}} Quickly organizations spread across both countries.{{sfn|Sethna|Hewitt|2009|pp=466–469}}{{sfn|Freeman|1972}} In Mexico, the first group of liberationists formed in 1970, inspired by the [[Mexico 68|student movement]] and US women's liberationists.{{sfn|González Alvarado|2002|p=56}}{{sfn|''El Universal''|2012}}

Organizations were loosely organized, without a hierarchical power structure and favored all-women participation to eliminate defining women or their autonomy by their association with men.{{sfn|Adamson|Briskin|McPhail|1988|p=8}} Groups featured consciousness raising discussions on a wide variety of issues, the importance of having freedom to make choices, and the importance of changing societal attitudes and perceptions of women's roles.{{sfn|Magarey|2014|p=20}}{{sfn|Kanes|1969|p=11}} Canadian Women's Lib groups typically incorporated a class-based component into their theory of oppression which was mostly missing from U.S. liberation theory, {{sfn|Sethna|Hewitt|2009|pp=468–469}}{{sfn|Adamson|Briskin|McPhail|1988|p=50}} which focused almost exclusively on sexism and a belief that women's oppression stemmed from their gender and not as a result of their economic or social class.{{sfn|Echols|1989|p=3}} In Quebec, women's and Quebec's autonomy were entwined issues with women struggling for the right to serve as jurors.{{sfn|Dupuis-Déri|2007}}

Advocating public self-expression by participating in protests and sit-ins, liberationists demonstrated against discriminatory hiring and wage practices in Canada,{{sfn|Wasserlein|1990|p=64}} while in the US liberationists protested the [[Miss America]] Beauty Pageant for objectifying women.{{sfn|Bucy|2010|p=307}} In both countries Women's Liberation groups were involved protesting their legislators for abortion rights for women.{{sfn|Sethna|Hewitt|2009|p=472}}{{sfn|Nelson|2003|pp=33–34}} In Mexico liberationists protested at the Monument to the Mother on [[Mother's Day]] to challenge the idea that all women were destined to be mothers.{{sfn|''El Universal''|2012}}{{sfn|González Alvarado|2002|p=58}} Challenging gender definitions and the sexual relationship to power drew lesbians into the movement in both the United States and Canada.{{sfn|Tremblay|Paternotte|Johnson|2016|p=75}} Because liberationists believed that sisterhood was a uniting component to women's oppression, lesbians were not seen as a threat to other women.{{sfn|Brownmiller|1970}} Another important aspect for North American women was developing spaces for women to meet with other women, offer counseling and referral services, provide access to feminist materials, and establish [[women's shelter]]s for women who were in abusive relationships.{{sfn|Spain|2016|p=51}}{{sfn|Adamson|Briskin|McPhail|1988|pp=45, 56}}{{sfn|González Alvarado|2002|p=60}}

Increasingly mainstream media portrayed liberationists as man-haters or deranged outcasts.{{sfn|Adamson|Briskin|McPhail|1988|p=70}}{{sfn|Brownmiller|1970}} To gain legitimacy for the recognition of sexual discrimination, the media discourse on women's issues was increasingly shaped by the [[liberal feminist]]'s reformist aims.{{sfn|Dow|2014|pp=121–122}} As liberationists were marginalized, they increasingly became involved in single focus issues, such as violence against women. By the mid-1970s, the Women's Liberation Movement had been effective in changing the worldwide perception of women, bringing sexism to light and moving reformists far to the left in their policy aims for women,{{sfn|Willis|1984|pp=91–92}} but in the haste to distance themselves from the more radical elements, liberal feminists attempted to erase their success and rebrand the movement as the Women's Movement.{{sfn|Curthoys|2003|p=5}}

=== Europe ===
{{Main|Women's liberation movement in Europe}}
In Europe, the women's liberation movement started in the late 1960s and continued through the 1980s. Inspired by events in North America and triggered by the growing presence of women in the labour market, the movement soon gained momentum in Britain and the Scandinavian countries.{{sfn|Dahlerup|2017}} Though influenced by leftist politics, liberationists in general were resistant to any political order which ignored women entirely or relegated their issues to the sidelines.{{sfn|Miller|2013|p=20}} Women's liberation groups in Europe were distinguished from other feminist activists by their focus on women's rights to control their own bodies and sexuality, as well as their direct actions aimed at provoking the public and making society aware of the issues faced by women.{{sfn|Kiani|2017|p=19}}

There were robust Women's Liberation movements in Western European countries, including developments in Greece, Portugal and Spain, which in the period  were emerging from dictatorships.{{sfn|Allen|2007|p=116}} Many different types of actions were held throughout Europe.{{sfn|Allen|2007|p=120}} To increase public awareness of the problems of equal pay, liberationists in Denmark staged a bus sit in, where they demanded lower fares than male passengers to demonstrate their wage gap.{{sfn|Fauré|2004|p=668}} Swedish members of ''[[Group 8 (Sweden)|Grupp 8]]'' heckled politicians at campaign rallies, demanding to know why women were only allowed part-time jobs and thus were ineligible for pensions.{{sfn|Harr|2014}} To address the objectification of women, Belgian liberationists protested at beauty pageants,{{sfn|Degavre|Stoffel|2005}} ''[[Dolle Mina]]s'' in the Netherlands and ''Nyfeministene'' of Norway invaded male-only bars,{{sfn|Foley|1971|p=22}}{{sfn|Nørve|2007}} [[Irish Women United]] demonstrated against male-only bathing at [[Forty Foot]] promontory{{sfn|McCabe|2010}} and Portuguese women dressed as a bride, a housewife and a sex symbol, marching in [[Eduardo VII Park]].{{sfn|Pena|2008|pp=101-103}}

Women in England, Scotland and Wales led [[Reclaim the Night]] marches to challenge the notion that women's behavior caused the violence perpetrated against them.{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=164-167}} Spanish liberationists from the ''Colectivo Feminista Pelvis'' (Pelvis Feminist Collective), ''Grup per l'Alliberament de la Dona'' (Group for Women's Liberation) and ''Mujeres Independientes'' (Independent Women) carried funeral wreaths through the streets of [[Mallorca]] calling for an end to sexual abuse and a judicial system which allowed men to use alcohol or [[crime of passion|passion]] as mitigating factors for sexual violence.{{sfn|Rodriguez|1979}} In Iceland, women virtually shut down the country; when spurred by liberationists, 90% of them took ''[[1975 Icelandic women's strike|Women's Day Off]]'' and refused to participate in household duties or work, instead attending a protest rally.{{sfn|Brewer|2015}}

In almost all Western European countries liberationists fought for elimination of barriers to free and unrestricted access to contraception and abortion.{{sfn|Studer|2017|p=15}}{{sfn|Allen|2007|p=123}} In Austria, to advocate for abolition of section 144 of their criminal code, activists used street theater performance.{{sfn|''Der Standard''|2004}} Prominent French activists declared their criminal actions signing the [[Manifesto of the 343]], admitting to having had abortions,{{sfn|Picq|2008}} as did German activists who signed the ''Manifesto of the 374''.{{sfn|Brown|2013|pp=300-301}} Irish activists [[Contraceptive Train|took the train]] and crossed into Northern Ireland to secure prohibited contraception devices and upon their return flouted authorities by passing the contraband to the public.{{sfn|Farren|2006}} In the UK, an uneasy alliance formed between liberationists, the [[National Abortion Campaign]] and trade unionists to fight a series of bills designed to restrict abortion rights.{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=121-122}} In Italy, 50,000 women marched through the streets of Rome demanding their right to control their own bodies,{{sfn|Bracke|2014|pp=87}} but as was typically the result throughout Europe, compromise reform to existing law was passed by the government, limiting the decision by gestation or requiring preliminary medical authorization.{{sfn|Allen|2007|p=124}}{{sfn|Bracke|2014|pp=87}}{{sfn|Roseneil, et al.|2010|p=145}}

Throughout the period, publishing was crucial for disseminating the theory and ideas of liberation and other feminist schools of thought.{{sfn|Denis|van Rokeghem|1992|pp=76-77}} Initially many activists relied on translations of material from the US,{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=47-48}}{{sfn|Danielsen|2010|p=38}}{{sfn|University of Gothenburg|2011}} but increasingly the focus was on producing country-specific editions, or local journals to allow activists to adapt the movement slogan the "personal is political" to reflect their own experiences.{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=63-67}}{{sfn|Rees|2010|p=178}} Journals and newspapers founded by liberationists included Belgium's ''Le Petit livre rouge des femmes'' (The Little Red Book of Women),{{sfn|Denis|van Rokeghem|1992|pp=76-77}} France's ''{{ill|Le torchon brûle|fr}}'' (Waging the Battle),{{sfn|Picq|2008}} Greece's ''Gia tin Apeleftherosi ton Gynaikon'' (For the Liberation of Women),{{sfn|Greek News Agenda|2017}} Italy's ''Sottosopra'' (Upside Down),{{sfn|Melandri|2016}} the Scottish ''The Tayside Women's Liberation Newsletter'' or the British ''[[Spare Rib]]'', among many others.{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=85-87}} In the UK, a [[news agency|news service]] called the [[Women's Information and Referral Service]] (WIRES) distributed news of WLM groups throughout the nation.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=85}}

Books like ''Die Klosterschule'' (The Convent School, 1968) by [[Barbara Frischmuth]], which evaluated patriarchy in the [[parochial school]]s of Austria{{sfn|Fiddler|1997|p=252}} and ''The Descent of Woman'' (1972) by Welsh author and feminist [[Elaine Morgan]], brought women into the movement who thought that their lives differed from those of women in large urban settings where the movement originated.{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=17}} Other influential publications included the British edition of ''Our Bodies, Ourselves'' (1971) edited by [[Angela Phillips]] and [[Jill Rakusen]];{{sfn|Browne|2017|p=67}} ''Frauenhandbuch Nr. 1: Abtreibung und Verhütungsmittel'' (Women's Guide # 1: Abortion and Contraceptives, 1971) produced in Germany by Helke Sander and [[Verena Stefan]]{{sfn|Broeck|2007|p=100}} and ''Skylla sig själv'' (Self-blame, 1976) by Swede [[Maria-Pia Boëthius]], which evaluated [[rape culture]] applied analysis and solutions to local areas.{{sfn|Miller|2013|pp=28-29}} In some cases, books themselves became the focus of liberationists' protests over censorship, as in the case of the Norwegian demonstration at the publishing house [[Aschehoug]], which was forced to publish a translation of the Swedish text ''{{ill|Frihet, jämlikhet och systerskap|sv}}'' (Freedom, Equality and Sisterhood, 1970),{{sfn|Nørve|2007}} or the international outcry which resulted from the ban and arrest of Portuguese authors [[Maria Teresa Horta]], [[Maria Isabel Barreno]] and [[Maria Velho da Costa]] over their book ''Novas Cartas Portuguesas'' (New Portuguese Letters, 1972).{{sfn|Pena|2008|pp=63-64}}{{sfn|Dias Martins|2012|pp=24-26}}

As the idea of women's autonomy gained mainstream approval,{{sfn|Rúdólfsdóttir|1997|p=87}} governments and more reformist minded women's groups adopted liberationists' ideas and began incorporating them into compromise solutions.{{sfn|Sarrimo|2003}} By the early 1980s, most activists in the Women's Liberation Movements in Europe moved on to other single focus causes or transitioned into organizations which were political.{{sfn|Pena|2008|pp=112-114}}{{sfn|Beccalli|1994}}{{sfn|van Oven|2005|pp=13-14}}

=== Oceania ===
{{Main|Women's liberation movement in Oceania}}
Spreading from the United States and Britain, the Women's Liberation Movement reached Oceania in 1969. The first organizations were formed in [[Sydney]] in 1969,{{sfn|Magarey|2014|p=25}} and by 1970 had reached [[Adelaide]] and [[Melbourne]],{{sfn|Magarey|2014|pp=26–27}} as well as [[Wellington]] and [[Auckland]].{{sfn|Cook|2011}} The following year, organizations were formed at the [[University of the South Pacific]] in [[Fiji]]{{sfn|Griffen|Yee|1987|p=1}} and in [[Guam]].{{sfn|''The Ladder''|1972|p=47}} As in the US and other places where the movement flourished, small consciousness-raising groups with a limited organizational structure were the norm{{sfn|Magarey|2014|pp=29–30}}{{sfn|Else|1993|p=65}} and the focus was on changing societal perception rather than legislation.{{sfn|Elias|1979|p=9}}{{sfn|Else|1993|p=65}}

Involved in public protests, liberationists demonstrated at beauty pageants to protest women's objectification,{{sfn|Magarey|2014|p=26}}{{sfn|Else|1993|p=63}} and invaded male-only pubs.{{sfn|Else|1993|p=63}} In Australia they ran petition drives and protests in favor of legalizing abortion{{sfn|Genovese|1998|p=103}} and in Auckland led a funeral procession through [[Albert Park, Auckland|Albert Park]] to demonstrate lack of progress on issues which were of concern to women.{{sfn|Ministry for Culture and Heritage|2018}} Liberationists developed multiple publications such as ''[[Broadsheet (magazine)|Broadsheet]]'',{{sfn|Aukland Museum|n.d.}} ''Liberaction'',{{sfn|Magarey|2014|p=44}} ''MeJane'',{{sfn|Henderson|Bartlett|2014|pp=105–108}} ''[[Lesbian Feminist Circle|The Circle]]''{{sfn|Else|1993|p=559}} and ''Women's Liberation Newsletter''{{sfn|Henderson|Bartlett|2014|pp=91–92}} to address issues and concerns;.{{sfn|Magarey|2014|p=44}} They founded women's shelters{{sfn|Genovese|1998|p=128}}{{sfn|Cook|2011}} and women's centers for meetings and child care services,{{sfn|Else|1993|pp=96–97}}{{sfn|Genovese|1998|p=131}} which were open to all women,{{sfn|Magarey|2014|pp=27–28}} be they socialists, lesbians, indigenous women, students, workers or homemakers.{{sfn|Ministry for Culture and Heritage|2018}} The diversity of adherents fractured the movement by the early 1980s, as groups began focusing on specific interests rather than solely on sexism.{{sfn|Elias|1979|p=9}}{{sfn|Else|1993|pp=97, 554}}

=== Asia ===
{{Main|Women's liberation movement in Asia}}
By the 1970s, the movement had spread to Asia with Women's Liberation organizations forming in Japan in 1970.{{sfn|Shigematsu|2015|p=175}} The [[Yom Kippur War]] raised awareness of the subordinate status of Israeli women, fostering the growth of the WLM.{{sfn|Herzog|2009}} In India, 1974 was a pivotal year when activists from the [[Navnirman Movement]] against corruption and the economic crisis, encouraged women to organize direct actions to challenge traditional leadership.{{sfn|Patel|1985|pp=2-3}} In 1975, liberationist ideas in South Korea were introduced by [[Yi Hyo-jae]] a professor at [[Ewha Womans University]], after she had read western texts on the movement which were first translated into Korean in 1973.{{sfn|Kim|2000|pp=220-221}} Similarly, [[Hsiu-lien Annette Lu]], who had completed her graduate courses in the United States, brought liberationist ideas to Taiwan,{{sfn|Chiang|Liu|2011|p=559}} when she returned and began publishing in the mid-1970s.{{sfn|Lu|2009|p=48}}

In Singapore and other Asian countries, conscious effort was made to distinguish their movement from decadent, "[[Sexual revolution|free sex]]" [[Feminist movement|Western feminist]] ideals,{{sfn|Shigematsu|2015|p=176}}{{sfn|Lyons|2000|p=11}}{{sfn|Menon|2011|p=24}} while simultaneously addressing issues that were experienced worldwide by women. In India, the struggle for women's autonomy was rarely separated from the struggle against the [[caste system]]{{sfn|Patel|1985|p=7}} and in Israel, though their movement more closely resembled the WLM in the US and Europe, the oppression of Palestinian women was a focal area.{{sfn|Frankfort-Nachmias|Shadmi|2005|p=43}} In Japan, the movement focused on freeing women from societal perceptions of limitations because of their sex, rather than on a stand for equality.{{sfn|Shigematsu|2015|p=174}}{{sfn|Ito|2015}} In South Korea, women workers' concerns merged with liberationist ideas within the broader fight against dictatorship,{{sfn|Ching|Louie|2000|pp=123-125}} whereas in Taiwan, theories of respect for women and eliminating double-standards were promoted by weaving in [[Confucianism|Confucianist philosophy]].{{sfn|Chang|2009|p=94}}

== Surveillance ==
The [[FBI]] kept records on numerous participants in the WLM, both spying on them and infiltrating their organizations.{{sfn|Echols|1989|p=8}} Roberta Sapler, a participant in the movement between 1968 and 1973 in Pittsburgh, wrote an article regarding her attempts to obtain the FBI file kept on her during the period.{{sfn|Salper|2008}} Similarly, the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] spied upon liberationists in Canada,{{sfn|Sethna|Hewitt|2009|p=465}} as did the [[Australian Security Intelligence Organisation]] surveil WLM groups and participants in Australia.{{sfn|Smith|2017}} In Germany, the [[Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution]] ({{lang-de|Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz}}) kept tabs on activists participating in women's center activities. Merely having lived in a communal housing project or been affiliated with rebellious youth movements made liberationists targets for their meeting places to be searched and materials to be confiscated.{{sfn|Perincioli|Selwyn|2015|p=1970-77 Fear and Terror}}

== Criticism ==
The philosophy practiced by liberationists assumed a global sisterhood of support working to eliminate inequality without acknowledging that women were not united; other factors, such as age, class, ethnicity, and opportunity (or lack thereof) created spheres wherein women's interests diverged, and some women felt underrepresented by the WLM.{{sfn|Willis|1984|p=100}} While many women gained an awareness of how sexism permeated their lives, they did not become radicalized and were uninterested in overthrowing society. They made changes in their lives to address their individual needs and social arrangements, but were unwilling to take action on issues that might threaten their socio-economic status.{{sfn|Willis|1984|p=107}} Liberationist theory also failed to recognize a fundamental difference in fighting oppression. Combating sexism had an internal component, whereby one could change the basic power structures within family units and personal spheres to eliminate the inequality. Class struggle and the fight against racism are solely external challenges, requiring public action to eradicate inequality.{{sfn|Willis|1984|p=110}}

There was criticism of the movement not only from factions within the movement itself,{{sfn|Foley|1971|p=22}}{{sfn|Bennett|1970|p=40}} but from outsiders, like [[Hugh Heffner]], ''[[Playboy]]'' founder, who launched a campaign to expose all the "highly irrational, emotional, kookie trends" of feminism in an effort to tear apart feminist ideas that were "unalterably opposed to the romantic boy-girl society" promoted by his magazine.{{sfn|Dow|2014|p=120}} "Women's libbers" were widely characterized as "man-haters" who viewed men as enemies, advocated for [[separatist feminism|all-women societies]], and encouraged women to leave their families behind.{{sfn|Bennett|1970|p=40}} Semanticist Nat Kolodney argued that while women were oppressed by social structures and rarely served in tyrannical roles over the male population as a whole, men in general were not oppressors of women either. Instead, social constructs and the difficulty of removing systems which had long served their purpose exploited both men and women.{{sfn|Kolodney|1978|p=300}} Women's liberationists acknowledged that patriarchy affects both men and women, with the former receiving many privileges from it, but focused on the impact of systemic sexism and misogyny on women throughout the world.

To many women activists in the [[American Indian Movement]], black Civil Rights Movement, [[Chicano Movement#Chicanas in the movement|Chicana Movement]], as well as Asians and other minorities, the activities of the primarily white, middle-class women in the Women's Liberation Movement were focused specifically on sex-based violence and the social construction of gender as a tool of sex-based oppression. By evaluating all economic, socio-cultural, and political issues through the lens of sexism without pairing it with racism and classism, liberationists often poorly represented [[women of color]] in their analyses.{{sfn|Thompson|2002|p=337}}{{sfn|Regua|2012|p=141}}{{sfn|Longeaux y Vásquez|1997|p=31}} While women of color recognized that sexism was an issue, some did not see how it could be separated from the issue of race or class, which compounds to impact their access to education, health care, housing, jobs, legal justice, and the poverty and violence which permeates their lives.{{sfn|Regua|2012|p=141}}{{sfn|Thompson|2002|pp=341–342}}{{sfn|Longeaux y Vásquez|1997|pp=30–31}} For women who did not speak English, or spoke it as a second language, sexism had little to do with the ability to protect herself or utilize existing systems.{{sfn|Castillo|1997|p=46}} The focus on personal freedom was another divergence between white women and women of color. Some did not see the intrinsic connection between the liberation of women and the liberation of men that was advocated for by the Women's Liberation Movement and felt that feminists did not care about the inequalities suffered by men; they felt that the liberation of women without the liberation of men from policies that keep men of color from obtaining jobs and limit their civil rights, further preventing them from being able to protect their families, neither improved humanity as a whole nor improved the plight experienced by families.{{sfn|Sklar|2015}}{{sfn|Longeaux y Vásquez|1997|p=31}} [[Dorothy Height]], president of the [[National Council of Negro Women]], expressed that the best way black women could help themselves was to help their men gain equality.{{sfn|Sklar|2015}}

Regarding the "sex-positive" sect that broke away from the women's liberation movement, extending personal freedom to sexual freedom, the meaning of being free to have relations with whoever one wanted, was lost on black women who had been sexually assaulted and raped with impunity for centuries{{sfn|Sklar|2015}} or Native Women who were routinely sterilized.{{sfn|Thompson|2002|p=339}} Their issues were not about limiting their families but having the freedom to form families.{{sfn|Thompson||2002|p=349}} It had very little meaning in the traditional Chicana culture wherein women were required to be virgins until marriage and remain naïve in her marriage.{{sfn|Anonymous|1997|p=83}} Though invited to participate within the Women's Liberation Movement, many women of color cautioned against the single focus on sexism, finding it to be an incomplete analysis without the consideration of racism.{{sfn|Regua|2012|p=141}}{{sfn|Thompson||2002|p=342}} Likewise, though many lesbians saw commonalities with Women's Liberation through the goals of eponymous liberation from sex-based oppression, which included fighting against homophobia, others believed that the focus was too narrow to confront the issues they faced.{{sfn|Klemesrud|1970}} Differences in the understanding of gender and how it relates to and informs sex-based oppression and systemic sexism called attention to differences in issues. For example, many liberationists rejected the performance of femininity as a positive behavior, which meant that white lesbians who actively chose to perform femininity had to decide between their desire to be feminine-presenting and their rejection of sexual objectification. Jackie Anderson, an activist and philosopher, observed that in the black lesbian community being able to dress up made them feel confident because during the work week, black women had to conform to dress codes imposed upon them.{{sfn|Enke|2007|p=55}} This was and continues to be a sentiment held by most women, who tend to believe that the feeling of confidence derived from performing femininity as dictated by the sexist status quo is the same as empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Rottenberg, "The Rise of Neoliberal Feminism" (2013) Cultural Studies, 28(3), 418-437. doi: 10.1080/09502386.2013.857361 [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09502386.2013.857361]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
The Women's Liberation Movement created a global awareness of patriarchy and sexism.{{sfn|Willis|1984|pp=91–92}}{{sfn|Walker|1991|pp=xxii–xxiii}}{{sfn|Sanatan|2016}}{{sfn|''The Winnipeg Free Press''|1989|p=35}} By bringing matters that had long been considered private issues into the public view and linking those issues to deepen understanding about how systemic suppression of women's rights in society are interrelated, liberationists made innovative contributions to feminist theory.{{sfn|Browne|2017|pp=179-180}} Desiring to know about women's historic contributions but often being thwarted in their search due to centuries of censoring and blocking of women's intellectual work, liberationists brought the study of power relationships, including those of sex and diversity, into the social sciences. They launched women's studies programs and publishing houses to ensure that a more culturally comprehensive history of the complex nature of society was developed.{{sfn|Hannam|2008}}{{sfn|Lee|2014}}

In an effort to distance themselves from the politics and ideas of women in the Liberation Movement, as well as the personal politics which emerged, many [[Second-wave feminism|second-wave feminists]] distanced themselves from the early movement. [[Meaghan Morris]], an Australian scholar of popular culture stated that later feminists could not associate themselves with the ideas and politics of the period and maintain their respect.{{sfn|Curthoys|2003|p=5}} And yet, liberationists succeeded in pushing the dominant liberal feminists far to the left of their original aims and forced them to include goals that address sexual discrimination.{{sfn|Willis|1984|pp=91–92}} [[Jean Curthoys]] argued that in the rush to distance themselves from liberationists, an unconscious amnesia rewrote the history of their movement,{{sfn|Curthoys|2003|p=6}} and failed to grasp the achievement that, without a religious connotation, the movement created an "ethic of the irreducible value of human beings."{{sfn|Curthoys|2003|p=7}} Phrases that were used in the movement, like "consciousness raising" and "male chauvinism," became keywords associated with the movement.{{sfn|Curthoys|2003|p=4}}{{sfn|Foley|1971|p=22}}

'''Workplace violence''' (WPV) or '''occupational violence''' refers to [[violence]], usually in the form of [[physical abuse]] or [[threat]], that creates a risk to the health and [[safety]] of an [[employee]] or multiple employees.&lt;ref name = Worksafe&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worksafe.vic.gov.au/safety-and-prevention/health-and-safety-topics/occupational-violence |title=Occupational Violence | publisher= WorkSafe| accessdate= January 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==
According to data from the US [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]], in 2011 violence and other injuries caused by persons or animals contributed to 17% of all US occupational fatalities, with homicides contributing to 10% of the total.&lt;ref name = BLS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/iif/oshwc/cfoi/cfch0010.pdf |title=Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries, 2011| publisher= US Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics| accessdate= January 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1992 to 2010, there were 13,827 reported workplace homicide victims, averaging over 700 victims per year, in the United States.&lt;ref name = OccViolence&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/violence/ |title=CDC - Occupational Violence - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic| publisher= Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health| accessdate= January 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examination of the 2011 data shows that while a majority of workplace fatalities occurred to males, workplace violence disproportionately affects females. Homicides contributed to 21% of all occupational fatalities for women, compared to 9% for men.&lt;ref name = BLS/&gt; Of these homicides, relatives or domestic partners contributed to 39% of female homicide cases; male homicide cases were most likely to be perpetrated by robbers, contributing to 36% of male homicide cases.&lt;ref name = BLS/&gt;

The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] ("OSHA") a department of the United States Department of Labor defines workplace violence as "any act or threat of physical violence, harassment, intimidation, or other threatening disruptive behavior that occurs at the work site.  It ranges from threats and verbal abuse to physical assaults and even homicide." &lt;ref name="SLTC"&gt;Source: https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/workplaceviolence/&lt;/ref&gt;

2,000,000 US workers per year report workplace violence&lt;ref name="SLTC"/&gt;

Most cases of workplace violence are non-fatal. From 1993 to 1999, an average of about 1.7 million people reported occupational violence.&lt;ref name = OccViolence/&gt; About 75% of these cases are considered simple assault, while 19% of cases are considered aggravated assault.&lt;ref name = OccViolence/&gt;

Workplace violence is at epidemic proportions. "There used to be a time when an employee shooting someone in the workplace would be a shock. Now it’s becoming common.” states [[Kathleen M. Bonczyk]], Esq. a researcher and expert on workplace violence prevention.
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/work-grave-danger-article-1.3279671&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a June 2017 shooting spree when a former employee returned to his Orlando, Florida workplace to murder five co-workers before committing suicide Kathleen M. Bonczyk, Esq. stated “You hear it again and again. People always say ‘We didn’t think it (workplace violence) would happen here,’ but it can happen anywhere and anytime. It shouldn’t be a question of if; employers should operate under the question of when.” &lt;ref&gt;http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/orlando-workplace-shooting/os-orlando-workplace-shooting-violence-uptick-20170605-story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

* Patrick Henry Sherrill, a 44-year-old [[mail carrier]] from [[Edmond, Oklahoma]], was reprimanded after a heated argument with two supervisors on August 19, 1986. At approximately 7:00 the following morning, Sherrill showed up at the post office in his uniform. Over the course of the next 15 minutes, Sherrill went on [[Edmond post office shooting|a murderous rampage]], gunning down any employee who crossed his path. After sealing off the exits, Sherrill ended up murdering fourteen coworkers and wounding six others. When police arrived at the post office, Sherrill turned the gun on himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,144859,00.html | work=Time | first=Jacob V. | last=Lamar Jr | title="Crazy Pat's" Revenge | date=June 24, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On November 5, 2009, [[Nidal Malik Hasan]], who was serving in the [[United States Army]] as a [[psychiatrist]], fatally shot 13 people and injured more than 30 others at [[Fort Hood]], near [[Killeen, Texas]].  [[2009 Fort Hood shooting|The shooting]] produced more casualties than any other on an American military base.

* David Burke was employed by [[USAir]] as a ticket agent until his supervisor, Raymond Thompson, fired him for theft. After Thompson refused to reinstate him, Burke showed up at [[Los Angeles International Airport]] on December 7, 1987, and purchased a ticket for [[Pacific Southwest Airlines Flight 1771]] to [[San Francisco International Airport]]. Burke smuggled a [[.44 Magnum]] onto the aircraft. Shortly after takeoff, the aircraft's [[flight recorder|cockpit voice recorder]] picked up the sound of gunshots. Then came the sound of David Burke’s voice. The pilots were shot and the aircraft crashed into a hillside in [[San Luis Obispo County]], killing all 43 people on board, including Burke and Thompson. At the crash site, an airsickness bag was found containing a message which Burke had written for his former supervisor. It read: “I asked for some leniency for my family, remember. Well, I got none. And you’ll get none.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,145653,00.html | work=Time | first=Ed | last=Magnuson | title=David Burke's Deadly Revenge | date=June 24, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* At 6:45&amp;nbsp;a.m. on August 26, 2015, 41-year-old Vester Lee Flanagan, a disgruntled ex-reporter for [[Roanoke, Virginia|Roanoke]] station [[WDBJ-TV]], shot and killed two former colleagues live on television in [[Moneta, Virginia]]. At the time, 24-year-old WDBJ reporter Alison Parker was conducting an interview of local chamber of commerce executive Vicki Gardener as 27-year-old videographer Adam Ward filmed the interview on a live feed. Flanagan, who had been previously terminated from his position at WDBJ, captured the three via a body cam and appeared to wait until the piece was airing before he began shooting and emptied his Glock handgun of all bullets. Gardener who was also shot survived the attack. After the shootings, Flanagan fled the scene and later boasted about the attack on social media before he was killed by police.&lt;ref name="propertycasualty360.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.propertycasualty360.com/2016/04/22/three-keys-to-reducing-workplace-violence-risks|title=Three keys to reducing workplace violence risks|access-date=2016-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* On April 8, 2016, workplace violence erupted at Lackland Airforce Base in San Antonio, Texas.  At that time, the squadron's commanding officer was shot and killed by an airman who then killed himself.  Thereafter, the facility went into lockdown mode.  Soon after the shootings, it was reported that the incident was not a case involving terrorism but was workplace violence.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-texas-shooter-idUSKCN0X51OW&lt;/ref&gt; The shooter was being escorted to a disciplinary hearing when he committed the murder-suicide.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/crime/article/Bexar-County-Sheriff-s-deputies-responding-to-7236358.php&lt;/ref&gt;
* On May 4, 2016, a man who had been involuntarily terminated two weeks earlier from his position at Knight Transportation in Katy, Texas approximately 20 miles west of Houston returned to his former workplace armed with a shotgun and a pistol.  Marion Guy Williams, 65, was reported to have said words to the effect of "You all ruined my life."

* On June 8, 2017 a grocery story employee named Randy Stair age 24 blocked all entrance/exits to the Weis Market in Tunkhannock, Pennsylvania where he was employed and opened fire.  Stair killed three co-workers before turning his gun on himself and committing suicide.  Dating back to July 2016, Stair left behind a cache of disturbing and violent images, cartoons, videos, and messages on-line for the world to view on his social media accounts. Amongst other things, Stair posted numerous images of himself with his shotguns.  He went so far as to name them "the twins" and is even seen caressing and kissing one.  In one of his videos Stair proclaims “All souls are fair game.” Stair who idolized the Columbine killers Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold.

* On April 3, 2018, Nasim Najafi Aghdam opened fire on her co-workers at Youtube headquarters in San Bruno, California, killing herself and sending 3 others to the hospital. Police describe it as workplace violence.

==Aggression==
Dr. [[Arnold H. Buss]], of the University of Texas at Austin (1961),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Buss |first=AH |year=1961 |title=The Psychology of Aggression}}&lt;/ref&gt; identified eight types of [[workplace aggression]]:
*Verbal-passive-indirect (failure to deny false rumors about target, failure to provide information needed by target)&lt;ref name="propertycasualty360.com"/&gt;
*Verbal-passive-direct ("[[silent treatment]]", failure to return communication, i.e. phone calls, e-mails)
*Verbal-active-indirect (spreading [[False accusation|false rumors]], belittling ideas or work)
*Verbal-active-direct (insulting, acting condescendingly, yelling)
*Physical-passive-indirect (causing others to create a delay for the target)
*Physical-passive-direct (reducing target's ability to contribute, e.g. scheduling them to present at the end of the day where fewer people will be attending)
*Physical-active-indirect (theft, destruction of property, unnecessary consumption of resources needed by the target)
*Physical-active-direct (physical attack, nonverbal, vulgar gestures directed at the target)

In a study performed by Baron and Neuman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baron|first1=RA|last2=Neuman|first2=HA|title=Workplace violence and workplace aggression: Evidence on their relative frequency and potential causes|journal=Aggressive Behavior|volume=22|pages=161–173|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1098-2337(1996)22:3&lt;161::AID-AB1&gt;3.0.CO;2-Q}}&lt;/ref&gt; researchers found pay cuts and pay freezes, use of part-time employees, change in management, increased diversity, computer monitoring of employee performance, reengineering, and budget cuts were all significantly linked to increased workplace aggression.  The study also showed a substantial amount of evidence linking unpleasant physical conditions (high temperature, poor lighting) and high negative affect, which facilitates workplace aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===Risk assessments===
{{globalize|date=September 2009}}
In the United Kingdom there is a legal obligation to complete risk assessments for both physical and psychosocial workplace hazards. Other countries have similar occupational health and safety legislation in place relating to identifying and either eliminating or controlling for hazards in the workplace. Workplace violence is considered to be a significant hazard in its own right. Regulation 3 of the ''Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations'' 1999 states that, “every employer shall make a suitable and sufficient assessment of:
* The risks to the health and safety of his (or her) employees to which they are exposed whilst they are at work; and
* The risks to the health and safety of persons not in his employment arising out of or in connection with the conduct of him or his undertaking".

==Occupational groups at higher risk==
The Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety lists the following higher risk occupations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
| title = Violence in the Workplace
| url = http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/psychosocial/violence.html#_1_3
| accessdate = May 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Healthcare workers
* Correctional officers
* Social Services workers
* Teachers
* Municipal housing inspectors
* Public Works Employees
* Retail Workers
* Police Officers

Health care workers are at high risk for experiencing violence in the workplace. Examples of violence include threats, physical assaults, and muggings. According to estimates of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the rate of nonfatal occupational injuries and illnesses involving days away from work was 15.1 per 10,000 full-time workers in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Labor Statistics. Nonfatal Occupational Injuries and Illnesses Requiring Days Away from Work, 2012. Retrieved March 13, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; This rate is much higher than the rate for total private industries, which is 4.0 per 10,000 full-time workers.

Monitoring workplace violence trends is essential to identifying targeted prevention strategies. The [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/ohsn/ Occupational Health Safety Network (OHSN)] is a secure electronic surveillance system developed by the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)]] to address health and safety risks among health care personnel. Hospitals and other healthcare facilities can upload the occupational injury data they already collect to the secure database for analysis and benchmarking with other de-identified facilities. NIOSH works with OHSN participants in identifying and implementing timely and targeted interventions. OHSN modules currently focus on three high risk and preventable events that can lead to injuries or musculoskeletal disorders among healthcare personnel: musculoskeletal injuries from patient handling activities; slips, trips, and falls; and workplace violence. OHSN enrollment is open to all healthcare facilities.
