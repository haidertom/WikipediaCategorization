In the field of [[intellectual property]] licensing, an '''advance against royalties'''  is a payment made by the licensee to the licensor at the start of the period of [[License|licensing]] (usually immediately upon contract, or on delivery of the property being licensed) which is to be offset against future [[Royalties|royalty payments]].  It is also known as a ''guaranteed minimum royalty payment''.

For example, a book's author may sell a license to a publisher in return for 5% royalties on sales of the book and a $5,000 advance against those royalties.  In this case, the author would immediately receive the $5,000, and royalty payments would be withheld until $5000 in royalties already paid had been earned — that is, until the publisher's takings from selling copies of the book reached $100,000; after that point the 5% royalty would be paid on any additional sales.&lt;ref&gt;Rachelle Gardner, [http://www.rachellegardner.com/2009/11/how-book-royalties-work/ "How Book Royalties Work"], Nov. 10, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some business areas (e.g. film production), it is common practice for the licensee to demand repayment of any advance that is not covered by royalties, whereas in others (e.g. book publication) this practice is unusual.

'''Agricultural economics''' is an applied field of [[economics]] concerned with the application of economic theory in optimizing the production and distribution of food and fiber.  Agricultural economics began as a branch of economics that specifically dealt with [[land use|land usage]], it focused on maximizing the [[crop yield]] while maintaining a good [[soil science|soil ecosystem]].  Throughout the 20th century the discipline expanded and the current scope of the discipline is much broader.  [[Agricultural]] economics today includes a variety of applied areas, having considerable overlap with conventional economics.&lt;ref&gt;Karl A. Fox (1987). "agricultural economics," ''[[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]]'', v. 1, pp. 55–62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. L. Gardner (2001), "Agriculture, Economics of," ''[[International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences]]'', v. 1, pp. 337-344.  [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B0-08-043076-7/02313-5 Abstract &amp; outline.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. Ford Runge (2008). "agricultural economics," ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd Ed., [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_A000243&amp;q=agricultural%20&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=4 Abstract.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sumner et al. (2010)"&gt;Daniel A. Sumner, Julian M. Alson, and Joseph W. Glauber (2010). "Evolution of the Economics of Agricultural Policy", ''[[American Journal of Agricultural Economics]]'', v. 92, pp. 403-423.&lt;/ref&gt; Agricultural economists have made substantial contributions to research in economics, [[econometrics]], [[development economics]], and [[environmental economics]].  Agricultural economics influences [[food policy]], [[agricultural policy]], and [[environmental policy]].

Economics has been defined as the study of resource allocation under scarcity. Agricultural economics, or the application of economic methods to optimizing the decisions made by agricultural producers, grew to prominence around the turn of the 20th century.  The field of agricultural economics can be traced out to works on land economics.  [[Henry Charles Taylor]] was the greatest contributor with the establishment of the Department of Agricultural Economics at Wisconsin in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Story of The Department of Agricultural Economics: 1909-1972 | author = Shaars, Marvin A. | year=  1972 | url = http://www.aae.wisc.edu/pubs/AAEStory.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2009-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another contributor, 1979 Nobel Economics Prize winner [[Theodore Schultz]], was among the first to examine [[development economics]] as a problem related directly to agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schultz |first=Theodore |title=Economic Growth and Agriculture |location=New York |publisher=MacGraw-Hill |year=1968 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Schultz was also instrumental in establishing [[econometrics]] as a tool for use in analyzing agricultural economics empirically; he noted in his landmark 1956 article that agricultural supply analysis is rooted in "shifting sand", implying that it was and is simply not being done correctly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Theodore W. |last=Schultz |year=1956 |title=Reflections on Agricultural Production, Output and Supply |journal=Journal of Farm Economics |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=748–762 |jstor=1234459 |doi=10.2307/1234459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One scholar summarizes the development of agricultural economics as follows:

"Agricultural economics arose in the late 19th century, combined the [[theory of the firm]] with marketing and organization theory, and developed throughout the 20th century largely as an empirical branch of general economics.  The discipline was closely linked to empirical applications of mathematical statistics and made early and significant contributions to econometric methods.  In the 1960s and afterwards, as agricultural sectors in the OECD countries contracted, agricultural economists were drawn to the development problems of poor countries, to the trade and macroeconomic policy implications of agriculture in rich countries, and to a variety of production, consumption, and environmental and resource problems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ford |last=Runge|title=Agricultural Economics: A Brief Intellectual History|page=1 (abstract)|work= University of Minnesota Working Paper WP06-1|year= June 2006|url= http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/13649/1/wp06-01.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agricultural economists have made many well-known contributions to the economics field with such models as the [[cobweb model]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Mordecai Ezekiel]]|title=The Cobweb Theorem|journal=Quarterly Journal of Economics|date=February 1938|volume=52|issue=2|pages=255–280|url=http://www.econ-pol.unisi.it/paolopin/TeachMaterial/IntroMatlabStata/Ezekiel1938.pdf|doi=10.2307/1881734|access-date=2015-03-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150616073821/http://www.econ-pol.unisi.it/paolopin/TeachMaterial/IntroMatlabStata/Ezekiel1938.pdf|archive-date=2015-06-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[hedonic regression]] pricing models,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/1230278 | last1 = Waugh | first1 = F. | year = 1928 | title = Quality Factors Influencing Vegetable Prices | jstor = 1230278| journal = Journal of Farm Economics | volume = 10 | issue = 2| pages = 185–196 }}&lt;/ref&gt; new technology and diffusion models ([[Zvi Griliches]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/1905380 | last1 = Griliches | first1 = Zvi | authorlink = Zvi Griliches | year = 1957 | title = Hybrid Corn: An Exploration in the Economics of Technical Change | jstor = 1905380| journal = Econometrica | volume = 25 | issue = 4| pages = 501–522 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[multifactor productivity]] and efficiency theory and measurement,&lt;ref&gt;Farrell, M.J., "The Measurement of Productive Efficiency," ''[[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society]]'' Series A, General 125 Part 2(1957): 252-267.  Farrell's frequently cited application involved an empirical application of state level agricultural data&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Vernon Wesley Ruttan]], "Technological Progress in the Meatpacking Industry, 1919-47," USDA Marketing Research Report No. 59, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; and the random coefficients regression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/2284029 | last1 = Hildreth | first1 = H. | last2 = Houck | first2 = J. | year = 1968 | title = Some Estimators for a Linear Model with Random Coefficients | jstor = 2284029| journal = Journal of the American Statistical Association | volume = 63 | issue = 322| pages = 584–595 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The farm sector is frequently cited as a prime example of the [[perfect competition]] economic paradigm.

In Asia, agricultural economics was offered first by the University of the Philippines Los Baños Department of Agricultural Economics in 1919. Today, the field of agricultural economics has transformed into a more integrative discipline which covers farm management and production economics, rural finance and institutions, agricultural marketing and prices, agricultural policy and development, food and nutrition economics, and environmental and natural resource economics.

Since the 1970s, agricultural economics has primarily focused on seven main topics, according to a scholar in the field: agricultural environment and resources; risk and uncertainty; food and consumer economics; prices and incomes; market structures; trade and development; and technical change and human capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ford |last=Runge|title=Agricultural Economics: A Brief Intellectual History|page=15-16|work= University of Minnesota Working Paper WP06-1|year= June 2006|url= http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/13649/1/wp06-01.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major topics in agricultural economics==

===Agricultural environment and natural resources===
In the field of environmental economics, agricultural economists have contributed in three main areas: designing incentives to control environmental externalities (such as water pollution due to agricultural production), estimating the value of non-market benefits from natural resources and environmental amenities (such as an appealing rural landscape), and the complex interrelationship between economic activities and environmental consequences.&lt;ref name="Kling et al. (2010)"&gt;Catherine L. Kling, Kathleen Segerson and Jason F. Shogren (2010). "Environmental Economics: How Agricultural Economists Helped Advance the Field" ''[[American Journal of Agricultural Economics]]'', v. 92, pp. 487-505.&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to natural resources, agricultural economists have developed quantitative tools for improving land management, preventing erosion, managing pests, protecting biodiversity, and preventing livestock diseases.&lt;ref name="Lichtenberg et al. (2010)"&gt;Erik Lichtenberg, James Shortle, James Wilen and David Zilberman (2010). "Natural Resource Economics and Conservation: Contributions of Agricultural Economics and Agricultural Economists" ''[[American Journal of Agricultural Economics]]'', v. 92, pp. 469-486.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food and consumer economics===
While at one time, the field of agricultural economics was focused primarily on farm-level issues, in recent years agricultural economists have studied diverse topics related to the economics of food consumption. In addition to economists' long-standing emphasis on the effects of prices and incomes, researchers in this field have studied how information and quality attributes influence consumer behavior. Agricultural economists have contributed to understanding how households make choices between purchasing food or preparing it at home, how food prices are determined, definitions of poverty thresholds, how consumers respond to price and income changes in a consistent way, and survey and experimental tools for understanding consumer preferences.&lt;ref name="Unnevehr et al. (2010)"&gt;Laurian Unnevehr, James Eales, Helen Jensen, Jayson Lusk, Jill McCluskey and Jean Kinsey (2010). "Food and Consumer Economics" ''[[American Journal of Agricultural Economics]]'', v. 92, pp. 506-521.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Production economics and farm management===
Agricultural economics research has addressed diminishing returns in agricultural production, as well as farmers' costs and supply responses. Much research has applied economic theory to farm-level decisions. Studies of risk and decision-making under uncertainty have real-world applications to crop insurance policies and to understanding how farmers in developing countries make choices about technology adoption. These topics are important for understanding prospects for producing sufficient food for a growing world population, subject to new resource and environmental challenges such as [[water scarcity]] and global climate change.&lt;ref name="Chavas et al. (2010)"&gt;Jean-Paul Chavas, Robert G. Chambers and Rulon D. Pope (2010). "Production Economics and Farm Management" ''[[American Journal of Agricultural Economics]]'', v. 92, pp. 356-375.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development economics===
Development economics is broadly concerned with the improvement of living conditions in low-income countries, and the improvement of economic performance in low-income settings. Because agriculture is a large part of most developing economies, both in terms of employment and share of GDP, agricultural economists have been at the forefront of empirical research on development economics, contributing to our understanding of agriculture's role in economic development, economic growth and structural transformation. Many agricultural economists are interested in the food systems of developing economies, the linkages between agriculture and nutrition, and the ways in which agriculture interact with other domains, such as the natural environment.&lt;ref name="Gollin et al. (2002)"&gt;Douglas Gollin, Stephen Parente and Richard Rogerson (2002). "The Role of Agriculture in Development" ''[[The American Economic Review]]'', v. 92, pp. 160-164.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Timmer (2002)"&gt;C. Peter Timmer (2002). "Agriculture and economic development" ''[[Handbook of Agricultural Economics]]'', Vol 2, Part A, pp. 1487-1546.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional associations==

The International Association of Agricultural Economists (IAAE) is a worldwide professional association, which holds its major conference every three years. The association publishes the journal ''Agricultural Economics''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaae-agecon.org/journal/journal.html ''Agricultural Economics'']&lt;/ref&gt; There also is a European Association of Agricultural Economists (EAAE), an African Association of Agricultural Economists [AAAE]and an [[Australian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society]]. Substantial work in agricultural economics internationally is conducted by the [[International Food Policy Research Institute]].

In the United States, the primary professional association is the [[Agricultural &amp; Applied Economics Association]] (AAEA), which holds its own annual conference and also co-sponsors the annual meetings of the Allied Social Sciences Association (ASSA). The AAEA publishes the ''[[American Journal of Agricultural Economics]]'' and ''[[Applied Economic Perspectives and Policy]]''.

==Careers in agricultural economics==

Graduates from agricultural and applied economics departments find jobs in many sectors of the economy: agricultural management, agribusiness, commodities markets, education, the financial sector, government, natural resource and environmental management, real estate, and public relations. Careers in agricultural economics require at least a bachelor's degree, and research careers in the field require graduate-level training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Careers in Agricultural Economics: Job Options and Requirements | author = Education Portal | year=  2014 | url = http://education-portal.com/articles/Careers_in_Agricultural_Economics_Job_Options_and_Requirements.html | accessdate = 2014-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 study by the Georgetown Center on Education and the Workforce rated agricultural economics tied for 8th out of 171 fields in terms of employability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = What's the Value of an Agricultural Economics Degree? | authors = Department of Agricultural, Environmental, and Development Economics, the Ohio State University | year=  2014 | url = http://aede.osu.edu/about-us/news/what%E2%80%99s-value-agricultural-economics-degree-answer-987-chance-you%E2%80%99ll-have-job-after | accessdate = 2014-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = What's It Worth?

'''Andrei Aleksandrovich Fursenko''' ({{lang-ru|Андрей Александрович Фурсенко}}; born 17 July 1949 in [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]]) is a Russian politician, scientist and businessman. He was the [[Ministry of Education and Science (Russia)|Minister of Education and Science]] of the [[Russian Federation]] from 2004 to 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Andrei Fursenko|url=http://russkiymir.ru/en/fund/board-of-trustees/Fursenko-Andrej-Aleksandrovich.php|website=Russkiy Mir}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is considered to be a member of the Saint Petersburg [[Political groups under Vladimir Putin's presidency#St. Petersburg economists and lawyers|political groups under Vladimir Putin's presidency]].

==Family and education==
His father [[Aleksandr Fursenko]] (1927–2008) was a renowned historian, a member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]. His brother [[Sergey Fursenko]] (b. 1954) is a technician, businessman, TV producer and the president of the football club [[FC Zenit Saint Petersburg|Zenit]] ([[St. Petersburg]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sergey Fursenko|url=http://www.uefa.org/about-uefa/executive-committee/news/newsid=1587065.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrei Fursenko entered the Department of Mathematics and Mechanics of the [[Leningrad State University]] in 1966 and graduated from there in 1971. In the university he became a member of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], which he left in August 1991 as it had been banned.

==Career==
From 1971-1991 he worked in Leningrad at the [[Ioffe Physico-Technical Institute]] as a junior researcher, senior researcher, the chief of the Computer Department (1985–1989), deputy director for science (1987–1991).

He defended his [[Candidate of Science]] dissertation in physics in 1978 and his [[Doctor of Science]] dissertation in physics in 1990.

In 1990-1991 together with [[Yuriy Kovalchuk]] (another deputy director) and [[Vladimir Yakunin]] (head of the foreign relations department of the institute) he tried to create a commercial enterprise within the institute that would be engaged in the application of scientific achievements. These plans, however, were opposed by [[Zhores I. Alferov|Zhores Alfyorov]], director, so that Fursenko, Kovalchuk and Yakunin left their positions in the institute.

Outside the institute in St. Petersburg they founded several companies specializing in science application.

In 1991-1992 Fursenko was a vice-president of the R&amp;D company Advanced Technology Center Ltd headed by Yuriy Kovalchuk.

Since 1992 - November 2001 he was the Director General of the St. Petersburg Regional Foundation for Scientific and Technological Development attached to the electronic factory OJSC Svetlana. RFSED was founded by the [[Russia bank]], JSC "Fund for Regional Development, OJSC Svetlana, [[City Property Committee of St. Petersburg]] and three more enterprises.

In 1993 Andrei Fursenko got acquainted with [[Vladimir Putin]] who worked in the [[Office of the Mayor of St. Petersburg]] as the head of the Committee for External Relations and had registered some of his companies. [https://web.archive.org/web/20070109131958/http://anticompromat.ru/oligarhi/ppo.html]

Since the early 90s, Andrei Fursenko owns a [[dacha]] in Solovyovka, [[Priozersky District]] of the [[Leningrad Oblast|Leningrad region]], which is located on the eastern shore of the Komsomol'skoye lake on the [[Karelian Isthmus]] near St. Petersburg. His neighbours there are [[Vladimir Putin]], [[Vladimir Yakunin]], his brother [[Sergey Fursenko]], [[Yuriy Kovalchuk]], [[Viktor Myachin]], [[Vladimir Smirnov (businessman)|Vladimir Smirnov]] and [[Nikolay Shamalov]]. On 10 November 1996, together they instituted the co-operative society [[Ozero]] (the Lake) which united their properties.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/02/how-the-1980s-explains-vladimir-putin/273135/#  How the 1980s Explains Vladimir Putin.

In May 1994 - September 1995 he was CEO of Russian-German Joint venture Investment Consulting Company St. Petersburg (ICC).

In 1995 Andrei Fursenko became a member of the pro-government [[Our Home Is Russia]] party.

In September 2000 - 2001 he was a [[Philippines]] consul in St. Petersburg, A.H.

Since October 2000 he is the Chairman of the Academic Council of the Foundation "Centre for Strategic Research North-West" (CEO Yuriy Kovalchuk).

==Government==
From November 2001 until November 2003 Fursenko was Deputy Minister of Industry, Science and Technologies of the [[Russian Federation]]. From November 2003 until March 2004 he was Minister of Industry, Science and Technologies of the Russian Federation. From 9 March 2004 until 21 May 2012 Fursenko was Minister of Education and Science of the Russian Federatiom.

Andrei Fursenko refused to prevent compulsory teaching of religious subjects at school [http://www.mk.ru/numbers/2418/article84922.htm][https://web.archive.org/web/20070322040544/http://www.anticompromat.ru/fursenko_a/index.html][http://religion.sova-center.ru/events/13B7455/13DF6DE/7F786A9] and objected to teaching advanced mathematics at school.[http://www.rosbalt.ru/2009/02/11/617365.html]

Andrei Fursenko is married and has a son named Alexander. He is fluent in English.

Because of the [[Ukrainian crisis|crisis in Ukraine]], the [[Office of Foreign Assets Control]] (OFAC) published on March 20, 2014, that [[List of people sanctioned during the Ukrainian crisis|Fursenko and 19 other men]] have been added to the [[Office of Foreign Assets Control#Specially Designated Nationals List|Specially Designated Nationals List (SDN)]] which froze his assets in the United States, prevented him from traveling to the United States, and prohibited United States citizens and entities from conducting business with Fursenko.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Treasury Sanctions Russian Officials, Members Of The Russian Leadership’s Inner Circle, And An Entity For Involvement In The Situation In Ukraine |url=http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl23331.aspx |publisher=US Department of the treasury}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Executive Order - Blocking Property of Additional Persons Contributing to the Situation in Ukraine |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/03/20/executive-order-blocking-property-additional-persons-contributing-situat |publisher=The White House - Office of the Press Secretary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/OFAC-Enforcement/Pages/20140320_33.aspx|title=Ukraine-related Designations|publisher=|accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx|title=Specially Designated Nationals List (SDN)|publisher=|accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sanctions&gt;{{cite web|last=Shuklin |first=Peter |title=Putin's inner circle: who got in a new list of US sanctions |url=https://news.liga.net/articles/politics/1066761-blizhniy_krug_putina_kto_popal_v_novyy_spisok_sanktsiy_ssha.htm |publisher=liga.net |date=March 21, 2014 |accessdate=February 20, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207152258/http://news.liga.net/articles/politics/1066761-blizhniy_krug_putina_kto_popal_v_novyy_spisok_sanktsiy_ssha.htm |archivedate=February 7, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ukraine-EO13661&gt;{{cite web | last = President of The United States | title = Ukraine EO13661 | url = https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/ukraine_eo2.pdf | publisher = Federal Register | date = March 19, 2016 | accessdate = February 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cast Urethanes''' are similar to [[injection molding]]. During the process of injection molding, a hard tool is created. The hard tool, made of an A side and a B side, forms a void within and that void is injected with plastics ranging in material property, durability, and consistency. Plastic cups, dishware, and toys are most commonly made using the process of injection molding because they are common consumer items that need to be produced on a mass scale, and injection molding (once the hard tool has been created) is designed for [[mass production]].

Casting urethanes is similar in that [[polyurethanes]] are injected into a tool. But with cast urethanes, the tool is a soft tool, typically made with a type of [[silicone]] mold. The mold is created via a master pattern. Master patterns for cast urethanes can be created with [[CNC machining]] (which is a common process for injection molding) but cast urethane master patterns are often created with additive manufacturing (or [[3D Printing]]) and the reasons for this vary.

Creating a cast urethane master pattern is different from the steps involved in creating hard tooling for injection molding. Hard tools for injection molding are going to be subjected to a lot of stress and heat during the injection process. They will see runs of thousands of parts per day. The care that goes into a hard tool involves intense machine programming which costs thousands of dollars alone. The price for hard tooling is balanced by the mass production the tooling brings, which is where cast urethanes begin to differ. Cast urethanes are suited for smaller runs of parts and prototyping. Because the cost for soft tooling is lower, down in the hundreds rather than hundreds of thousands, cast urethanes are excellent resources for creators still testing product design, for one-off products, or for testing market and consumer response to a new product.

== Master Patterns ==
Cast urethane master patterns can be produced using machining, additive manufacturing—even an already existing product. The master pattern is used to create an A side and a B side for a mold. The pattern is used to form a void within a mold. The mold material is one that easily picks up surface detail (such as silicones) because the mold will be responsible for reflecting the surface of the product.

== Applications ==
There are many types of cast urethane applications including:
· Urethane Molded Bearings
· Urethane Covered Rollers
· Urethane Cast Wheels
· FDA Approved Cast Urethane Parts

== Process ==
Cast urethane starts as a liquid that can be dispensed into a mold, post cured in ovens and where required, secondary machining operations can be added. Cast thermoset urethanes have better physical properties than most injection or extruded thermoplastics. Dispensing liquid urethane into open molds or compression tools makes it possible to cast just about any configuration from affordable tooling.

Steps include first printing a master pattern for an accurate silicone mold, which is then encased in liquid silicone. After the mold cures, it is cut into distinct sections and the pattern is removed. The cavity formed is used for casting the end product. The cavity or void is filled with a material, which will cure and be removed from the tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/340051/Design_Guides/Xometry_DesignGuide_UrethaneCasting.pdf|title=Design Guide: Urethane Casting|last=|first=|date=|website=Xometry|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Industries ==
The types of industries that utilize cast urethane include: 

· Distribution Centers
· Printing
· Wheels for Skateboards, Robots and other rotating applications
· Conveyor Systems 

== Benefits of Cast Urethane ==
· Abrasion resistance
· Reduction of noise
· Excellent tear strength
· High / Low temperature

The role of a corporate lawyer is to ensure the legality of commercial transactions, advising corporations on their legal rights and duties, including the duties and responsibilities of [[corporate officer]]s.  In order to do this, they must have knowledge of aspects of [[contract law]], [[tax law]], [[accounting]], [[securities law]], [[bankruptcy]], [[intellectual property rights]], [[licensing]], [[zoning law]]s, and the laws specific to the business of the corporations that they work for.&lt;ref name=Princeton&gt;{{cite book|title=Guide to Your Career|author=Alan B. Bernstein and Princeton Review Publishing Staff|chapter=Corporate Lawyer|date=2004|publisher=[[The Princeton Review]]|isbn=0-375-76399-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vault&gt;{{cite book|title=The Vault College Career Bible|author=Vault Editors|chapter=Corporate Law Basics|pages=289&amp;ndash;290|date=2007|publisher=Vault Inc.|isbn=1-58131-419-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In recent years, controversies involving well known companies such as, [[Walmart]] and [[General Motors]] have highlighted the complex role of corporate lawyers in internal investigations, in which  [[attorney-client privilege]] could be considered to shelter potential wrongdoing by the company. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Solomon|first1=Steven Davidoff|title=Keeping Corporate Lawyers Silent Can Shelter Wrongdoing|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/08/26/keeping-corporate-lawyers-silent-can-shelter-wrongdoing/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0|accessdate=30 August 2014|work=The New York Times|date=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a corporate lawyer's internal company clients are not assured of confidentiality, they will be less likely to seek legal advice, but keeping confidences can shelter society's access to vital information. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bishop|first1=Keith Paul|title=Why Keeping Corporate Lawyers Quiet Is Good For Us All|journal=The National Law Review|date=28 August 2014|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/why-keeping-corporate-lawyers-quiet-good-us-all|accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The practice of corporate law is less adversarial than that of trial law.  Lawyers for both sides of a commercial transaction are less opponents than facilitators.  One lawyer (quoted by Bernstein) characterizes them as "the [[handmaiden]]s of the deal".  Transactions take place amongst peers.  There are rarely wronged parties, underdogs, or inequities in the financial means of the participants.  Corporate lawyers structure those transactions, draft documents, review agreements, negotiate deals, and attend meetings.&lt;ref name=Princeton /&gt;&lt;ref name=Vault /&gt;

What areas of corporate law a corporate lawyer experiences depend from where the firm that he/she works for is, geographically, and how large it is.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://brycelegal.com/2016/08/how-i-got-my-legal-dream-job-series-how-to-become-one-of-the-most-powerful-lawyers-in-new-york-state-government/|title=Intensive Practical Skills Training Build a Foundation for a Legal Career|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2017-07-27|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A small-town corporate lawyer in a small firm may deal in many short-term jobs such as drafting [[will (law)|will]]s, [[divorce]] settlements, and real estate transactions, whereas a corporate lawyer in a large city firm may spend many months devoted to negotiating a single business transaction.  Similarly, different firms may organize their subdivisions in different ways.  Not all will include [[mergers and acquisitions]] under the umbrella of a corporate law division, for example.&lt;ref name=Princeton /&gt;&lt;ref name=Vault /&gt;

Some corporate lawyers become partners in their firms.  Others become in-house counsel for corporations.  Others still migrate into other professions such as [[investment banking]] and teaching law.&lt;ref name=Princeton /&gt;

Some publications read by those in the profession include ''Global Legal Studies'', ''Lawyers Weekly'', and the ''[[National Law Journal]]''.&lt;ref name=Princeton /&gt;

==Salary==
The salary of a corporate lawyer can vary widely: those employed by major [[international]] [[law firms]] ("BigLaw" firms) earn starting salaries of US$180,000, which rise every year with experience (this amount excludes any additional bonus payments).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/07/business/dealbook/law-firm-salaries-jump-for-the-first-time-in-nearly-a-decade.html?_r=0|title=Law Firm Salaries Jump for the First Time in Nearly a Decade|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the geographical location, the starting salary may be closer to US$160,000 if the market is secondary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/17/business/dealbook/welcome-to-your-first-year-as-a-lawyer-your-salary-is-160000-a-year.html|title=Welcome to Your First Year as a Lawyer.

In 2016, Vidanes was appointed as the chief operating officer for broadcast division of ABS-CBN effective February 1.

'''Demeter International''' is the largest certification organization for [[biodynamic agriculture]], and is one of three predominant organic certifiers.&lt;ref name=coffee&gt;Commission for Environmental Cooperation and TerraChoice Environmental Services Inc, ''Environmental and Other Labelling of Coffee: the role of mutual recognition, supporting cooperative action'', May 2004. [http://crdi.org/uploads/user-S/11278532171sci_coffee_labelling.pdf Document text] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207122045/http://crdi.org/uploads/user-S/11278532171sci_coffee_labelling.pdf |date=February 7, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its name is a reference to [[Demeter]], the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] [[goddess]] of [[grain]] and [[fertility]]. Demeter Biodynamic Certification is used in over 50 countries to verify that biodynamic products meet international standards in production and processing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140530033038/http://biodynamic.org.nz/demeter.html Demeter certification in New Zealand]&lt;/ref&gt; The Demeter certification program was established in 1928, and as such was the first ecological label for organically produced foods.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Diver, ''Biodynamic Farming &amp; Compost Preparation'', Alternative Farming Systems Guide: ATTRA, February 1999. [http://attra.ncat.org/attra-pub/PDF/biodynam.pdf Document text]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
Certification is difficult to come by and must be renewed annually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metroactive.com/papers/sonoma/08.31.05/dining-0535.html ''Biodynamic Berries: Ancient ways are the next step in organic winemaking'']&lt;/ref&gt; Demeter’s “biodynamic” certification requires biodiversity and ecosystem preservation, soil husbandry, livestock integration, prohibition of genetically engineered organisms and viewing the farm as a living “holistic organism”.&lt;ref name=coffee/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://demeter-usa.org/?page_id=5 Overview of Demeter certification requirements] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070730185553/http://demeter-usa.org/?page_id=5 |date=2007-07-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The certification verifies the fulfillment of the standards on behalf of the farmers, which in turn guarantees high quality food products to the consumers. This is rewarded by receiving a higher price for food certified with the “Demeter” label, ranging from 10-30% on average.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Rist and Lucas Rist, "Towards a post-materialist understanding of science – lessons learnt form the interface of biodynamic agriculture and research."

== History ==

The origin of Demeter is a Cooperative for the processing of products of the [[biodynamic agriculture]] created in Berlin, Germany, in 1927. The trademark Demeter was registered in 1928. Demeter was administered by the German agronomist Erhard Bartsch who also directed the Experimental Circle of anthroposophical (biodynamic) farmers, and who had chosen the name Demeter, jointly with the German chemist Franz Dreidax. Dreidax was responsible for the development of the Demeter criteria and the quality control.

The Demeter name was adopted internationally. In Australia, two members of the Experimental Circle, Ernesto Genoni and Ileen Macpherson founded Demeter Biological Farm in Melbourne in 1934 and operated it as a biodynamic farm for two decades (until 1954).&lt;ref&gt;John Paull (2017) [https://www.academia.edu/31572839/Ileen_Macpherson_Life_and_tragedy_of_a_pioneer_of_biodynamic_farming_at_Demeter_Farm_and_a_benefactor_of_Anthroposophy_in_Australia  Ileen Macpherson: Life and tragedy of a pioneer of biodynamic farming at Demeter Farm and a benefactor of Anthroposophy in Australia], Journal of Organics, 4(1):29-56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Paull (2017) [http://orgprints.org/32143/1/Paull2017.Demeter.JBDT.pdf Australia’s original Demeter Farm (1934-1954)], Journal of Biodynamics Tasmania, 123:16-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Demeter ceased temporarily to exist in 1941 when the Nazi Government dissolved the Union for biodynamic agriculture. It was reestablished in Germany after the Second World War. In 1997 19 independent Demeter organisations came together to establish Demeter International. All continents were represented.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

'''Downtown San Bernardino''' is a district in the city of [[San Bernardino]], [[California]], in [[San Bernardino County]], United States. It is home to city and county government buildings, and to the city's [[central business district]].&lt;ref name="ULI"/&gt; The downtown area of San Bernardino is home to multiple (and the only) diplomatic missions for the Inland Empire, being one of only four California cities with multiple consulates (the other cities being Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco). The governments of Guatemala (opened July 2014) and Mexico have established their consulates in the civic center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pe.com/local-news/local-news-headlines/20140307-immigration-guatemala-to-open-san-bernardino-consulate.ece |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317020932/http://www.pe.com/local-news/local-news-headlines/20140307-immigration-guatemala-to-open-san-bernardino-consulate.ece |archivedate=2014-03-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Downtown San Bernardino is bounded by [[Interstate 215 (California)|I-215]] to the west, [[California State Route 18|Waterman Avenue]] to the east, Baseline Street to the north, and Mill Street to the south.&lt;ref name="ULI"&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Advisory Services Panel | title=San Bernardino, California: Crossroads of the Southwest | url=http://www.ci.san-bernardino.ca.us/civica/filebank/blobdload.asp?BlobID=4907 | publisher=[[Urban Land Institute]] | location=[[Washington, D.C.]] | date=June 24–29, 2007 | accessdate=2007-12-26 | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entertainment district==

[[File:California Theatre, San Bernardino.JPG|thumb|left|The historic California Theatre.]]

Downtown is home to three performing arts venues and a movie theatre, the most for any central business district in the Inland Empire. The city is planning a new district along Fourth Street. The key aspect of the plan is to make the area around the California Theatre and future Regal San Bernardino Theatre Square Stadium 14 site on Fourth Street as an area for entertainment and dining. Dining is all that is needed to make this into a reality, as Regal Stadium 14 opened in the spring of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sbsun.com/ci_19436441?source=most_viewed |date=2011-11-29 |publisher=[[San Bernardino Sun]] |accessdate=2011-11-29 |title=EDC gives approval for lease to return movie theater to San Bernardino's downtown |author=Josh Dulaney |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111201193730/http://www.sbsun.com/ci_19436441?source=most_viewed |archive-date=2011-12-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Duncan Walker Bannatyne''', [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (born 2 February 1949),&lt;ref name="DBinterview"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/feb/18/broadcasting.comment|title=Duncan Bannatyne interview|last=Barber|first=Lynn|date=18 February 2007|work=[[The Observer]]|accessdate=10 November 2008|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneur]], [[Philanthropy|philanthropist]] and author. His business interests include hotels, health clubs, spas, media, TV, and property. He is most famous for his appearance as a [[business angel]] on the [[BBC]] programme ''[[Dragons' Den (UK)|Dragons' Den]]''. He was appointed an [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] for his contribution to charity. He has written seven books.

==Early life==

Bannatyne was born in [[Dalmuir]] west of [[Glasgow]]. His father Bill had served in the [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]] in [[World War II]] and worked on the [[Burma Railway]] after being captured by the Japanese following the [[Battle of Singapore|Fall of Singapore]], he then worked in the foundry at the Clydebank [[Singer Corporation|Singer]] plant. As a child Duncan lived in one room with his parents and siblings in a large house shared with six other families. He attended Dalmuir Primary School where he displayed a talent for arithmetic and won a place at [[Clydebank High School]] after passing the [[Eleven plus exam]]. Most pupils owned a bicycle so he resolved to earn the money to buy one for himself. The local newsagent was not interested in employing him so she challenged him to find 100 new customers in return for a paper round. He called her bluff by returning with 100 names, but later reflected that it would have been more entrepreneurial to have sold the list. He only enjoyed [[Physical education|PE]] and woodwork at the High School and left at 15 without any qualifications.&lt;ref name=Autobiography&gt;{{cite book|date=3 September 2007|author=Duncan Bannatyne|isbn=0-7528-8189-2|title=Anyone Can Do It:My Story|publisher=Orion Publishing Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, after a few weeks working for a local [[cabinet-maker]] he joined the [[Royal Navy]], initially enlisting for twelve years as a junior second class engineering mechanic ([[Stoker (occupation)|stoker]]) at [[RNTE Shotley]] near [[Ipswich]], better known as the boys' training establishment HMS ''Ganges''. He served in the Navy for several years including a spell on the aircraft carrier HMS ''[[HMS Eagle (R05)|Eagle]],'' before throwing an officer off a boat landing jetty in Scotland and receiving a [[dishonourable discharge]]. In his autobiography he claims this was in part a reaction to this officer's abuse of his authority, in part a dare by his shipmates and in part a way of getting out of the Navy, with which he had become disillusioned. Bannatyne was nineteen when this happened. After the incident he had to serve nine months in [[Colchester]] military detention centre.&lt;ref name=Autobiography /&gt; He later spent ten days in Glasgow's [[Barlinnie prison]] for not paying a [[pound sterling|£]]10 fine in relation to a charge of [[breach of the peace]] and [[resisting arrest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sundayherald.com/life/people/display.var.2442236.0.0.php |title=In the Dragons' Den with God |publisher=Sunday Herald |date=6 September 2008 |accessdate=23 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206120928/http://www.sundayherald.com/life/people/display.var.2442236.0.0.php |archivedate=6 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Would I Lie To You Series 1 Episode 1|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8BygaZXsj4&amp;t=8m58s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Bannatyne spent his twenties moving from one job to another. Upon his return to Clydebank he trained as an agricultural vehicle fitter and then travelled around the country repairing tractors. He lived on the island of [[Jersey]] for four years from 1974 where he gained an [[Large goods vehicle|HGV]] licence and earned a living through several jobs including deckchair attendant, ice cream seller and hospital porter. He also [[surfing|surfed]], partied and met his first wife on the island. With Jersey's difficult business climate for outsiders, at age 29, Bannatyne and his wife moved to [[Stockton-on-Tees]] in [[North East England]]. He has stated that he was poor and did not have a bank account until the age of 30.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/tv/programmes/genres/entertainment/schedules/2010/07/14 Direct quote from Bannatyne from ''Dragon's Den'', 14 July 2010]. BBC. Retrieved on 28 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

His business career began almost immediately after his move to [[Stockton-on-Tees]] with an ice cream van purchased for £450.&lt;ref name="bannatyne1"&gt;[http://www.bannatyne.co.uk/about-duncan About Duncan - The Bannatyne Group&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He soon expanded by buying more vans during the period of the [[Glasgow Ice Cream Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2900560/Business-profile-Duncan-is-ready-for-his-close-up.html|title=Business profile: Duncan is ready for his close-up|date=28 November 2004|accessdate=3 August 2011|location=London|work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sold the business for £28,000, founding a [[nursing home]] business called Quality Care Homes which he then sold for £26 million&lt;ref name="bannatyne1"/&gt; in 1997 and children's nursery chain Just Learning for £12 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.darlingtonandstocktontimes.co.uk/leisure/weekendtimes/feature/display.var.1004496.0.driven_restless_and_a_bit_arrogant_but_definitely_not_the_retiring_kind.php|title=Driven Restless And A Bit Arrogant But Definitely Not The Retiring Kind |work=Darlington and Stockton Times |date=4 November 2006 |accessdate=23 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Just Learning [[chief executive]] during the 1992–97 period was Conservative MP [[Michael Fallon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Tiffany |last=Holland|url=http://www.retail-week.com/profile-michael-fallon-minister-for-business/5040550.article|title=Profile: Michael Fallon, Minister for business|publisher=retail-week.com |date=14 September 2012 |accessdate=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bannatyne has since expanded into health clubs, with the Bannatyne Health Club &amp; Spa chain to his name, and also hotels and property. He acquired 26 health clubs from [[Hilton Hotels]] in August 2006 at a price of £92 million.&lt;ref name="bannatyne1" /&gt; The Bannatyne Group is now the largest independent chain of health clubs in the United Kingdom with 71 sites.  The business currently (June 2018) has 46 spas with plans for more, including at its first Northern Ireland-based health club in Belfast &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/business/northern-ireland/dragons-dens-duncan-bannatyne-opening-gym-in-northern-ireland-36361757.html|title=Dragon's Den's Duncan Bannatyne opening gym in Northern Ireland|work=BelfastTelegraph.co.uk|access-date=2018-06-14|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it operates 4 hotels.

His wealth as of 2018, was estimated at £280 million by the [[Sunday Times Rich List 2018|Sunday Times Rich List]].&lt;ref name="sunday times 2011"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/public/richlist/article629845.ece|title=The wealthiest in film and TV|publisher=Daily Telegraph|date=20 May 2011|accessdate=1 November 2011|last=Coxon|first=Ian|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bannatyne has written seven books: ''Anyone Can Do It'', ''Wake Up and Change Your Life'', ''How to be Smart With Your Money'', ''How to be Smart With Your Time'', ''43 Mistakes Businesses Make'', ''37 Questions Everyone in Business Needs to Answer'', and ''Riding The Storm''.

===Television===
From 2005 until 2015, Duncan was a Dragon on the BBC television series ''[[Dragons' Den (UK TV series)|Dragons' Den]]''. During his time on the show he invested in 36 businesses.

In 2015, Bannatyne took part in the [[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! (UK series 15)|fifteenth series]] of ''[[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! (UK TV series)|I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!]]''. His fee for taking part in the show was donated to the [[Operation Smile]] charity.

===Charity works===
Bannatyne received his OBE partly in recognition for his work with charities such as [[Mary's meals]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-12373390 Mary's Meals charity 'feeding 500,000 children a day' - 5 February 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; He has funded several projects over a ten-year period in Romania, including Casa Bannatyne in [[Târgu-Mureş]], a [[hospice]] for orphans with [[HIV]] and [[AIDS]] in which he invested £80,000. In March 2008, he established the Bannatyne Charitable Trust  with a personal injection of £1,000,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Sylvia  |last=Morris |url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/meandmymoney/article-1630415/Duncan-Bannatyne-Me--money.html |title=Duncan Bannatyne: Me &amp; my money |work=thisismoney.co.uk|date=23 April 2008 |accessdate=12 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 May 2008, Bannatyne added his support to the launch of the [[Geared for Giving]] Campaign at the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] to encourage UK business leaders to set up and promote a Workplace Giving scheme to benefit UK registered charities with tax effective donations through employees' pay. He then helped to promote [[Clydesdale Bank]]'s and [[Yorkshire Bank]]'s efforts to promote the programme through ATM ([[Automated Teller Machine]]) rolls. "They are really going for it, over 20 per cent of their employees are giving money through this system", Bannatyne says.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Mills |url=https://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2010/dec/16/duncan-bannatyne-geared-for-giving |title=A charitable dragon: Why Duncan Bannatyne is geared for giving |work=The Guardian |date=16 December 2010 |accessdate=12 October 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 August 2008, Bannatyne appeared on television programme ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'', raising £20,000 for charity [[Action for Children|NCH]].

He became President of the charity [[No Smoking Day]] in October 2008. The charity runs the annual health awareness campaign&amp;nbsp;– helping people who want to [[Smoking cessation|stop smoking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/7406568/Smokers-can-use-Facebook-to-quit.html# |title=Smokers can use Facebook to quit |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=10 March 2010 |accessdate=12 October 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dunlop Rubber''' was a  multinational company involved in the manufacture of various rubber goods. Its business was founded in 1889 by [[Harvey du Cros]] and he involved [[John Boyd Dunlop]] who had (re-) invented and developed the first [[pneumatic tyre]]. It was one of the first multinationals, and under du Cros and, after him, under Eric Geddes grew to be one of the largest British industrial companies. J B Dunlop had dropped any ties to it well before his name was used for any part of the business. The business and manufactory was founded in Upper Stephens Street in Dublin. A plaque marks the site, which is now part of the head office of the Irish multinational departments store brand, Dunnes Stores.

Dunlop Rubber failed to adapt to evolving market conditions in the 1970s despite having recognised by the mid 1960s the potential drop in demand as the [[Radial tire|new]] much more durable tyres swept throughout the market. After taking on excessive debt Dunlop was acquired by the industrial conglomerate [[BTR plc|BTR]] in 1985. Since then, ownership of the Dunlop trade-names has been fragmented.

==Early history==
In 1888, [[John Boyd Dunlop]], a Scottish veterinary surgeon living in Ireland discovered the [[pneumatic tyre]] principle.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Growth and Performance of British Multinational Firms before 1939: The Case of Dunlop|first= Geoffrey |last=Jones|journal= The Economic History Review |series=New Series|volume= 37|issue= 1|date=February 1984|pages=35–53|publisher=Wiley on behalf of the Economic History Society Article Stable|jstor=2596830}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Willie Hume]] created publicity for J B Dunlop's discovery by winning seven out of eight races with his pneumatic tyres.&lt;ref name="Gold Hume"&gt;[http://www.thepedalclub.org/archives/goldenbook/u-z/WilliamHume.html The Golden Book of Cycling – William Hume, 1938. Archive maintained by 'The Pedal Club'.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403120845/http://www.thepedalclub.org/archives/goldenbook/u-z/WilliamHume.html |date=3 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dunlop time"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dunlop.eu/dunlop_uk/what_sets_dunlop_apart/history/|title=Our history|work=dunlop.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; To own the rights and exploit the discovery, the Pneumatic Tyre and Booth's Cycle Agency Co. Ltd was incorporated in 1889 and floated by [[Harvey du Cros]] who was, amongst other things, president of the Irish Cyclists' Association. The invitation to du Cros to participate was made by William Bowden, a Dublin cycle agent. J B Dunlop who could see no prosperous future in his discovery, had informally made over his rights to Bowden. Initially J B Dunlop held a 20 percent stake in the venture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article55751961|title=08 Apr 1939 - No Faith In Tyre Invention|publisher=nla.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company and manufactory was first founded in Stephens Street in Dublin.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Pneumatic Tyre===
[[File:Bicycle circa 1896 with boy and three men.jpg|thumb]]
The late 1880s was a period of great demand for [[John Kemp Starley]]'s new [[safety bicycles]]. Pneumatic Tyre began cycle tyre production in Belfast in late 1890, and quickly expanded to fill consumer demand. However, in 1890, J B Dunlop's patent was withdrawn. It had been discovered that [[Robert William Thomson]] had first patented the pneumatic tyre in 1845.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; J B Dunlop and Harvey du Cros together worked through the ensuing considerable difficulties. They employed inventor Charles Kingston Welch and also acquired other rights and patents which allowed them to protect their business's position to some extent.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4/&gt;

In the early 1890s, Pneumatic Tyre established divisions in Europe and North America sending there four of du Cros's six sons. Factories were established overseas because foreign patents rights would only be maintained if the company was engaged in active manufacture where its tyres were sold.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; Pneumatic Tyre partnered with local cycle firms such as [[Clement Cycles]] in France and [[Adler (automobile)|Adler]] in Germany in order to limit the necessary capital expenditure.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; An American business was established in the USA in 1893 with a factory in [[Buffalo, New York]]&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; after [[Harvey du Cros#Harvey du Cros junior 1872-1928|Harvey du Cros junior]] was old enough (21) to sign the necessary deeds.&lt;ref&gt;Mr. Harvey Du Cros. ''The Times'', Friday, 2 November 1928; pg. 19; Issue 45040&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1893 home manufacture was relocated from [[Belfast]] and Dublin to [[Coventry]], the centre of the British cycle industry. The [[Dublin Corporation]] had launched a case against Pneumatic Tyre claiming nuisance from the smell of rubber and [[naphtha]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Martin Adeney, 'Du Cros, (William) Harvey (1846–1918)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2008 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/46891, accessed 17 Jan 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jstor16"/&gt; Pneumatic Tyre soon spread developing interests in [[Birmingham]]. The following year a major interest was taken in their component supplier Byrne Bros India Rubber of Lichfield Road, [[Aston]] Birmingham. The same year du Cros started Cycle Components Manufacturing in [[Selly Oak]] to supply inner tubes.&lt;ref name=TT34916&gt;The Rubber Tyre Manufacturing Company, Limited. ''The Times'', Saturday, 13 June 1896; pg. 8; Issue 34916&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre===

Associate and supplier, Byrne Bros India Rubber, at their Manor Rubber Mills, [[Aston#Aston Cross|Aston Cross]], had moved from making tyre and tube components to complete inner tubes and covers. In June 1896 du Cros formed a new company, Rubber Tyre Manufacturing, to acquire Byrne Bros. E J Byrne was contracted to be managing director for five years.&lt;ref name=TT34916/&gt;

===Dunlop Rubber===
From the late 1890s, Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre began to acquire its own rubber mills, and began to process rubber, whereas previously it had assembled tyres using components from other manufacturers.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; In 1901 Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre used its majority holding to rename Rubber Tyre Manufacturing – Dunlop Rubber.  [[Arthur Du Cros]] replaced E J Byrne.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;G. K. S. Hamilton-Edwards, 'Du Cros, Sir Arthur Philip, first baronet (1871–1955)', rev. Geoffrey Jones, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Oct 2009 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32914, accessed 17 Jan 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1900, Dunlop began to diversify from cycle tyres.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; The company manufactured its first motor car tyre in 1900.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; In 1906, a car wheel manufacturing plant was built.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; In 1910 Dunlop developed its first aeroplane tyre and golf ball.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

Between 1904 and 1909, the French Dunlop subsidiary lost a total of £200,000, as European rivals such as [[Michelin]] of France and [[Continental AG|Continental]] of Germany overtook it in the motor tyre market.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; In 1909, Dunlop of France, and in 1910, Dunlop of Germany were wholly acquired by the British parent in order to enforce stronger quality control.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

===Amalgamation of Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre and Dunlop Rubber===
In August 1912 Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre went out of business though retaining certain financial commitments. It passed its activities to Dunlop Rubber in exchange for shares. Then it changed its name to The Parent Tyre Company Limited. Dunlop Rubber purchased certain of its assets including goodwill and trading rights and in exchange the tyre company shareholders now owned three-quarters of Dunlop Rubber. The amalgamation was intended to bring about a substantial reduction in overhead and clarify what had been seen as a confusing relationship between the two enterprises when they shared most shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;Amalgamation approved. Dunlop Rubber Company (Limited). ''The Times'', Saturday, 31 August 1912; pg. 13; Issue 39992&lt;/ref&gt;

Arthur du Cros was made managing director and deputy chairman in 1912 and retained that position after his father's death in 1918 when A L Ormrod became chairman through until 1921. For supply, Du Cros selected estates in Ceylon and Malaya for purchase, and by 1917 the company owned about 60,000 acres of rubber plantations.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; In 1916, construction began on the [[Fort Dunlop]] site across 400 acres.&lt;ref name="jstor16"/&gt; By 1918, Dunlop was the fourteenth largest manufacturing company in Britain, and its only large-scale tyre manufacturer.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;[http://luxor.acadiau.ca/library/ASAC/v27/content/authors/m/McGovern,%20Tom/DOMINANCE%20TO%20DECLINE%20A%20CASE%20STUDY%20OF%20THE%20DEMISE%20OF%20DUNLOP.pdf DOMINANCE TO DECLINE: A CASE STUDY OF THE DEMISE OF DUNLOP]&lt;/ref&gt;

Arthur Du Cros became personally close to the financier [[James White (financier)|James White]], and appointed him as Dunlop's financial advisor in 1913.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; By 1919, White had acquired control of the company.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; White speculated on the rubber futures market with disastrous results when the price of rubber collapsed.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; Meanwhile, there were also quality control problems with tyres.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; This came to a head in August 1921 when the company announced a loss of £8&amp;nbsp;million on the year's trading.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; The company was saved by the intervention of [[Frederick Szarvasy]] of the [[Foreign &amp; Colonial Investment Trust|British Foreign and Colonial Corporation]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; White's board member nominees were removed, and [[Sir Eric Geddes]] was appointed as chairman.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

==Geddes era diversification==
From 1924, Sir Eric Geddes began to diversify Dunlop.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; In 1924, the company began to manufacture tennis balls.&lt;ref name="Grieves1989"&gt;{{cite book|last=Grieves|first=Keith|title=Sir Eric Geddes: Business and Government in War and Peace|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MUW8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA112|year=1989|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-2345-3|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1925, F A Davis was acquired, which had tennis racket manufacturing expertise.&lt;ref name="Grieves1989" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Dunlop And F. A. Davis, Limited." ''The Times'' [London, England] 29 January 1925: 18.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926 the company acquired [[Mackintosh|Charles Macintosh]] of Manchester for £2.5&amp;nbsp;million, and the Dunlop name was applied to footwear and clothing.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; Dunlop opened acquisition discussions with [[Slazenger]] in 1927, but without success.&lt;ref name="Grieves1989" /&gt; By 1928 only 72 percent of turnover was in tyres, compared to 90 percent in 1920.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

An advertising campaign in 1928 heralded "the Dunlop way".&lt;ref name="Grieves1989" /&gt;

In the late 1920s, Dunlop had manufacturing subsidiaries in the US, Canada, France, Germany and Japan.&lt;ref name="Grieves12"&gt;{{cite book|last=Grieves|first=Keith|title=Sir Eric Geddes: Business and Government in War and Peace|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MUW8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA112|year=1989|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-2345-3|pages=112–127}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1930, Dunlop secured an equal market share with its archrival Michelin in France.&lt;ref name="Grieves12" /&gt;

In 1929, Dunlopillo [[Foam rubber|latex foam]] was patented.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; In 1933, the commercial production of Dunlopillo products began.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

In 1930, Dunlop was the eighth largest public company in Britain by market value.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

The inter-war years saw considerable international expansion for Dunlop.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; The German subsidiary was reacquired after the First World War, and by 1929, Dunlop of Germany operated the second largest tyre factory in the country.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; Dunlop built manufacturing facilities in Ireland, South Africa and India during the 1930s.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; In 1932 the Dunlop bridge was built over the Circuit De La Sarthe, home to the [[Le Mans]] 24-hour race.&lt;ref name=plantclosure&gt;{{cite news|last=John Murray Brown in Birmingham and Henry Foy in London|title=Dunlop plant closure announcement branded cynical|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/b3b8c534-aeb5-11e3-aaa6-00144feab7de.html|accessdate=19 March 2014|newspaper=Financial Times|date=18 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The years 1922 to 1937 firmly established Dunlop as a household name.&lt;ref name="Grieves12" /&gt; By 1939, Dunlop was one of the largest British multinational companies.&lt;ref name="Grieves12" /&gt;

By 1946, Dunlop had 70,000 employees, and sales outlets in nearly every country in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/a2a/records.aspx?cat=074-acc2166&amp;cid=0#0|title=DUNLOP RUBBER COMPANY LIMITED|publisher=nationalarchives.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948 Dunlop invented the self-sealing tyre, which reduced the risk from blowouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://motorsport.dunlop.eu/motorsport-heritage/|title=Motorsport Heritage - Dunlop Motorsport|work=dunlop.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1950s, Dunlop developed [[Maxaret]], the first [[anti-lock braking system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1953/1953%20-%201433.html|title=maxaret unit - maxaret automatic - brake pressure - 1953 - 1433 - Flight Archive|publisher=Flightglobal}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1955 Dunlop had almost half of the UK tyre market.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;[http://www.competition-commission.org.uk/rep_pub/reports/1950_1959/012tyres.htm Competition Report, 1955] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118211506/http://www.competition-commission.org.uk/rep_pub/reports/1950_1959/012tyres.htm |date=18 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A report by the Monopolies and Restrictive Practices Commission in that year found that Dunlop and the four other main sellers in the UK market ([[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]], [[Avon Rubber|Avon]], [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]] and [[Michelin]]) companies had arrangements which resulted in fixed prices.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt; These arrangements were forced to change, and Dunlop's market share decreased.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;

[[File:Tom Okker en Jan Hajer (1964).jpg|thumbnail|Dutch tennis players [[Tom Okker]] and Jan Hajer pose with Dunlop and Slazenger rackets in 1964]]
A further factor in Dunlop's decline was the decision during the early 1960s to develop cheaper textile [[radial tyre]]s rather than the more durable steel-belted radial tyres.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; Dunlop lost market share to the Michelin company and other manufacturers marketing steel-belted tyres.&lt;ref&gt;''International Directory of Company Histories'' (1992) St James Press Vol V, p.252&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, UK productivity and quality was poor.&lt;ref name="oxforddnb.com"&gt;Martin Adeney, 'Fraser, Sir (James) Campbell (1923–2007)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Jan 2011 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/98784, accessed 11 Aug 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; Salesmen preferred products from the company's continental factories.&lt;ref name="oxforddnb.com"/&gt;

In 1967, the company changed its name from the Dunlop Rubber Company Ltd to Dunlop Ltd, to reflect the more diversified nature of the business.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; At this time, around 60 percent of sales came from overseas, and tyres represented 60 percent of company turnover.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;

Sir [[Reay Geddes]], the son of [[Eric Geddes|Sir Eric Geddes]], became chairman of Dunlop in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19680624&amp;id=G989AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OEgMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3991,4159791|title=The Glasgow Herald - Google News Archive Search|publisher=Google}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, Dunlop acquired George Angus Ltd of Newcastle upon Tyne, a world leader in the supply of fire hoses and fire fighting equipment.&lt;ref&gt;"Dunlop's £22m bid for Angus." ''The Times'' [London, England] 4 October 1968: 21.&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, Dunlop had operating profits of £31.8&amp;nbsp;million, with net profits of £11.2&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; By the late 1960s, Dunlop was the 35th largest company in the world outside the United States.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; In 1970, Dunlop had 102,000 employees.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;http://www.ebha.org/ebha2007/pdf/AmatoriLavista.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, Dunlop merged with [[Pirelli]] of Italy to form the world's third-largest tyre company after [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] and [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; The merger was not a takeover by either company, but a joint venture arrangement where each company took minority interests in the other's subsidiaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,942423,00.html?promoid=googlep Time magazine, 4 January 1971] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120822105723/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,942423,00.html?promoid=googlep |date=22 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The merger was not successful, and the joint venture was dissolved in 1981.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; Pirelli was not profitable throughout the entire duration of the merger.&lt;ref name="Toniolo2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gianni Toniolo|title=The Oxford Handbook of the Italian Economy Since Unification|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=upVpAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA432|date=4 January 2013|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=978-0-19-993670-0|page=432}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decline of the British car manufacturing industry from 1972 onwards also impacted the core Dunlop business.&lt;ref name="oxforddnb.com"/&gt; Matters were compounded by the [[1973 oil crisis]].&lt;ref name="oxforddnb.com"/&gt;

==Takeover and breakup==

As a result of increasing competition in the tyre industry, and the disastrous results of the [[Pirelli]] tie-up, Dunlop had amassed massive debts. Sir Reay Geddes stepped down as chairman in 1978 and Sir Campbell Fraser took over. Between 1978 and 1981 Dunlop spent $102&amp;nbsp;million on modernising its European tyre business.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/06/business/dunlop-pirelli-tire-breakup-symbolic.html|title=DUNLOP-PIRELLI TIRE BREAKUP SYMBOLIC|first=Elizabeth Bailey, Special To The New York|last=Times|date=6 June 1981|publisher=|accessdate=13 March 2017|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British workforce was cut from 13,000 to 7,000.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt; Angus and the company rubber plantations were sold. By July 1983, the Malaysian businessman [[Ghafar Baba]] had built a 26.1 percent stake in the company.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;

In September 1983, the European tyre business was sold to its former subsidiary, [[Sumitomo Rubber Industries]] Ltd of Japan, for £82&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; In 1984 the remaining tyre factories in New Zealand and [[Sahaganj#Dunlop at Sahaganj|India]] were sold for £200&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; In 1985 the company was acquired by [[BTR plc]] for £100&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html|title=Dunlop and BTR Reach an Accord|date=9 March 1985|publisher=|accessdate=13 March 2017|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; BTR immediately sold the US tyre business to its management for £142&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;''The Guardian'' (London) 16 May 1985 "BTR to sell US tyre arm of Dunlop". James Erlichman&lt;/ref&gt;

[[BTR plc|BTR]] began to divest itself of the Dunlop businesses from 1996 in order to transform itself from a conglomerate into a streamlined engineering company. In 1996, it sold [[Dunlop Slazenger]] to its management, backed by private equity group [[CINVen]] for £372&amp;nbsp;million, who in 2004 sold the business to [[Sports Direct International]] for £40&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2001/02/10/cndun10.xml Telegraph.co.uk 21 March 2001]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108214330/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fmoney%2F2001%2F02%2F10%2Fcndun10.xml |date=8 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Dunlop Aircraft Tyres Ltd of Birmingham was sold to a group of investors backed by [[3i]] for £10&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dunlopaircrafttyres.com/|title=Dunlop Aircraft Tyres - Manufacturer and Retreader of Aircraft Tires|publisher=|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, [[BTR plc|BTR]] sold [[BTR Aerospace Group]], including Dunlop Aviation and Dunlop Precision Rubber, to [[Doughty Hanson &amp; Co]] for £510&amp;nbsp;million to form [[Dunlop Standard Aerospace Group|Dunlop Standard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/btr-hives-off-aero-divisions-1168900.html|title=BTR hives off aero divisions|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Dunlop Standard was sold to [[Meggitt plc]] for £800&amp;nbsp;million. Meggitt has inherited the original English company, now named Dunlop Holdings Ltd, incorporated in 1896.&lt;ref name="Companies House webcheck"&gt;[http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk/ Companies House webcheck] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229053844/http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk/ |date=29 December 2008 }} Company number 50091&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, [[BTR plc|BTR]] sold its share of the South African subsidiary, Dunlop Africa Ltd, which was itself divided in 2001. The industrial products division was sold to become Dunlop Industrial Products and Dunlop Rubber Mouldings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dunlopmouldings.co.za/Display.asp?MainID=29 Dunlop Rubber Mouldings website]&lt;/ref&gt; The tyre business, Dunlop Tyres International, was bought by [[Apollo Tyres]] of India in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7048594e-d400-11e2-a464-00144feab7de.html|title=Apollo Tyres skids 24% on Cooper deal fears|work=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Apollo Tyres]] were never comfortable with, nor fully committed to the Dunlop Brand and sold most of the company (including all of the Dunlop Tyre trademark rights in Africa) to [[Sumitomo Rubber Industries]] in 2013. Dunlop Tyres International had owned the rights to various Dunlop brands in a number of countries outside South Africa, and these rights were sold to [[Sports Direct]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sports-direct-international.com/library/prospectus1pdf.pdf Sports Direct prospectus, 2007] p.147 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910123650/http://www.sports-direct-international.com/library/prospectus1pdf.pdf |date=10 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dunlop Tyres since 1985==
{{main|Dunlop Tyres}}

[[Sumitomo Rubber Industries]] sold tyres for road vehicles with the Dunlop brand from 1985 to 1999.  In 1999 Sumitomo RI and [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company]] of the US formed a joint venture.  Goodyear obtained the Dunlop tyre assets in Europe and the US, and Sumitomo RI continued to sell Dunlop tyres in other countries.

The Dunlop Tyres company in South Africa was acquired by the Indian company [[Apollo Tyres]] in 2007. In December 2013, Apollo Tyres sold most of its South African operations to Sumitomo RI for $60&amp;nbsp;million (Rs 3.33&amp;nbsp;billion) including the [[Ladysmith, KwaZulu-Natal|Ladysmith]] passenger car tyre plant.  Apollo Tyres retained its [[Durban]] plant, which manufactured truck &amp; bus radial (TBR) tyres and off-highway tyres used in the mining and construction industries (The [[Durban]] plant however closed in 2014 after management failed to maintain profitability). Sumitomo RI had also previously acquired ownership rights for the Dunlop brand in 32 African markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-05-30/news/39628974_1_dunlop-tyres-international-vredestein-onkar-s-kanwar |title=Apollo Tyres sells South African business to Sumitomo Rubber for Rs 340 crore|newspaper=The Economic Times|date=30 May 2013|accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2018 Sumitomo RI started manufacturing truck &amp; bus radial (TBR) tyres at the [[Ladysmith, KwaZulu-Natal|Ladysmith]]  plant. Much of this TBR equipment was acquired from the closed [[Apollo Tyres]] [[Durban]] plant. Sumitomo RI invested heavily in the [[Ladysmith, KwaZulu-Natal|Ladysmith]] plant. By 2018 the plant was almost double the size since they acquired the company in 2013.

'''Eliza James''' (30 September 1855– 26 September 1927) was an English [[watercress]] grower and entrepreneur, known as the Watercress Queen of Covent Garden. Her watercress business was the largest watercress company of the time in Europe.

== Life ==
She was born Eliza Currall, in Birmingham on 30 September 1855. She began selling watercress to help support her family following the suicide of her father. Aged sixteen, she was under detention as a female juvenile offender at the Warwickshire Reformatory for Girls in Coventry, which taught offenders a trade.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-109511|title=Fleet [née Currall; former married name Griffiths], Eliza [known as Eliza James] (1855–1927), watercress grower and entrepreneur|last=Morrin|first=Jean|date=2018-07-12|publisher=Oxford University Press|series=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|language=en|doi=10.1093/odnb/9780198614128.013.109511}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1877, she moved to London.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

On 28 May 1877 she married William Arthur Griffiths, a mariner, in Liverpool and they had four daughters and three sons. They lived in Coventry, Birmingham and Liverpool before settling in Sheffield as fruit and vegetable sellers. By 1986, she owned a fruit and commission agency business at Castlefolds Market in Sheffield. 

Her husband was an alcoholic, and on three occasions stabbed her. He threatened to murder her when she attempted to take divorce proceedings against him, and he was imprisoned in 1897. She was granted a divorce by [[decree nisi]] in April of that year, while William was in [[HM Prison Wakefield|Wakefield gaol]]. In her divorce petition, she argued that from the start of her marriage she had maintained her children with her own resources. It was rescinded on the basis of adultery, as she had lived with another man, James Fleet, a meat salesman at Sheffield market, in Glasgow after the divorce nisi, which she mistakenly believed had legally ended her marriage. She married Fleet in 1902, describing herself as a widow, and the couple lived in London and were sellers at [[Covent Garden]] market.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1912 she visited the United States of America with her daughter, travelling out on the ocean liner the Carmania and returning on the [[RMS Lusitania|Lusitania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=NOTABLE VISITOR ELUDED US.|last=|first=|date=18 February 1912|work=New York Times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Watercress business ===

[[File:Vitacress, watercress production - geograph.org.uk - 880633.jpg|alt=watercress beds|thumb|Vitacress watercress beds in [[St Mary Bourne]]]]
Because of her success as an entrepreneur and grower, she was known as the Watercress Queen. She was a successful businesswoman in a male-dominated environment, and in 1908 was trading in her own right as a saleswoman of watercress and salad. She diversified her trade, and began supplying, in addition to markets, restaurants, hotels and shops, and gained an almost monopoly of London's watercress market.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.coventgarden.london/whats-on/eliza-james-watercress-covent-garden|title=The Green Queen {{!}} Covent Garden London|website=www.coventgarden.london|language=en|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She founded her company James &amp; Son and from 1908 invested in watercress beds in Hampshire and Surrey, in [[Hurstbourne Priors]] and [[St Mary Bourne]] on the [[Bourne Rivulet|Bourne rivulet]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; She leased six acres of watercress beds from the [[Earl of Portsmouth]] in 1908, and again in 1917, this time a further nine acres. Her business suffered from the extensive drought of 1921, for which she had to sink [[Artesian aquifer|artesian wells]] for irrigation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Her firm was the largest watercress company in Europe,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and she became among the largest owners of watercress sites in the world.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-27148341|title=England's veneration of vegetables|last=Bell|first=Bethan|date=2014-05-21|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-10-26|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite her success as a businesswoman, James continued to work on her stall at Covent Garden Market, opening each morning having arrived on her son-in-law's watercress cart.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Death and legacy ==
She died on 26 September 1927 from a [[Intracerebral hemorrhage|brain haemorrhage]], [[arteriosclerosis]], and chronic [[Bright's disease|Bright’s disease]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She was buried at [[West Norwood Cemetery]] in London,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fownc.org/pdf/newsletter65.pdf|title=Elizabeth (Eliza) James (1856-1927) The Watercress Queen|last=Flanagan|first=Bob|date=May 2009|website=Friends of West Norwood Cemetery newsletter|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; where her coffin was laid with a large wreath of watercress.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/mar/27/watercress-recipes-hugh-fearnley-whittingstall|title=Watercress recipes {{!}} Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall|last=Fearnley-Whittingstall|first=Hugh|date=2010-03-27|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of her life, James was supplying London's restaurant trade, selling selling 50 tonnes of watercress a week.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The fields of watercress beds she created in Hampshire are still used for watercress production,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and are now owned by [[Vitacress|Vitacress Salads]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7673">'''Energy Management Software''' ('''EMS''') is a general term and category referring to a variety of energy-related software &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mahmud|first1=Khizir|last2=Town|first2=Graham E.|title=A review of computer tools for modeling electric vehicle energy requirements and their impact on power distribution networks|journal=Applied Energy|date=June 2016|volume=172|pages=337–359|doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.03.100}}&lt;/ref&gt; applications which may provide utility bill tracking, real-time metering, building HVAC and lighting control systems, building simulation and modeling, carbon and sustainability reporting, IT equipment management, [[demand response]], and/or energy audits. Managing energy can require a system of systems approach.&lt;ref&gt;Curry, Edward. 2012. [http://www.edwardcurry.org/publications/Curry_LinkedDataspaceForSOS_SOSE.pdf “System of Systems Information Interoperability Using a Linked Dataspace.”] In IEEE 7th International Conference on System of Systems Engineering (SOSE 2012), 101–106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy management software often provides tools for reducing energy costs and consumption for buildings or communities. EMS collects energy data and uses it for three main purposes: Reporting, Monitoring and Engagement. Reporting may include verification of energy data, benchmarking, and setting high-level energy use reduction targets. Monitoring may include trend analysis and tracking [[energy consumption]] to identify cost-saving opportunities. Engagement can mean real-time responses (automated or manual), or the initiation of a dialogue between occupants and building managers to promote [[energy conservation]]. One engagement method that has recently gained popularity is the real-time energy consumption display available in web applications or an onsite energy dashboard/display.

==Data collection==
Energy Management Software collects historic and/or [[real-time data|real-time]] [[interval data]], with intervals varying from quarterly billing statements to minute-by-minute [[smart meter]] readings. The data are collected from interval meters, [[Building automation|Building Automation Systems (BAS)]], directly from utilities, directly from sensors on electrical circuits,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SiteSage EMS architecture|url=https://powerhousedynamics.com/solutions/sitesage/#architecture}}&lt;/ref&gt; or other sources. Past bills can be used to provide a comparison between pre- and post-EMS energy consumption.

Electricity and Natural Gas are the most common utilities measured, though systems may monitor steam, petroleum or other energy uses, water use, and even locally generated energy. Renewable energy sources have contributed to the spurred growth in EMS data collection markets.

==Reporting==
Reporting tools are targeted at owners and executives who want to automate energy and emissions auditing. Cost and consumption data from a number of buildings can be aggregated or compared with the software, saving time relative to manual reporting. EMS offers more detailed energy information than utility billing can provide; another advantage is that outside factors affecting energy use, such as weather or building occupancy, can be accounted for as part of the reporting process. This information can be used to prioritize energy savings initiatives and balance energy savings against energy-related capital expenditures.

Bill verification can be used to compare metered consumption against billed consumption. Bill analysis can also demonstrate the impact of different energy costs, for example by comparing electrical demand charges to consumption costs.

Greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting can calculate direct or indirect [[Greenhouse gas emissions|GHG emissions]], which may be used for internal reporting or [[enterprise carbon accounting]].

==Monitoring==
Monitoring tools track and display real-time and historical data. Often, EMS includes various benchmarking tools, such as energy consumption per square foot, weather normalization or more advanced analysis using energy modeling algorithms to identify anomalous consumption. Seeing exactly when energy is used, combined with anomaly recognition, can allow Facility or Energy Managers to identify savings opportunities.

Initiatives such as demand shaving, replacement of malfunctioning equipment, retrofits of inefficient equipment, and removal of unnecessary loads can be discovered and coordinated using the EMS. For example, an unexpected energy spike at a specific time each day may indicate an improperly set or malfunctioning timer. These tools can also be used for Energy Monitoring and Targeting. EMS uses models to correct for variable factors such as weather when performing historical comparisons to verify the effect of conservation and efficiency initiatives.

EMS may offer alerts, via text or email messages, when consumption values exceed pre-defined thresholds based on consumption or cost. These thresholds may be set at absolute levels, or use an energy model to determine when consumption is abnormally high or low. More recently, smartphones and tablets are becoming mainstream platforms for EMS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Serious Energy Management Software uses Smartphones |url=http://www.seriousenergy.com/energy-management/software/sem.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110619012549/http://www.seriousenergy.com:80/energy-management/software/sem.html |archivedate=2011-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Powerhouse Dynamics’ mobile app expands real-time facility ops and energy management capabilities|url=http://www.chainstoreage.com/article/powerhouse-dynamics-mobile-app-expands-real-time-facility-ops-and-energy-management-capabil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Engagement==
Engagement can refer to automated or manual responses to collected and analyzed energy data. Building control systems can respond as readily to energy fluctuation as a heating system can respond to temperature variation. Demand spikes can trigger equipment power-down processes, with or without human intervention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.echome.co.uk/renewable-energy-services/heating-and-lighting-controls/ "Building Automation and Control"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another objective of Engagement is to connect occupants’ daily choices with building energy consumption. By displaying real-time consumption information, occupants see the immediate impact of their actions. The software can be used to promote energy conservation initiatives, offer advice to the occupants, or provide a forum for feedback on sustainability initiatives.

People-driven energy conservation programs, such as those sponsored by Energy Education, can be highly effective in reducing energy use and cost. 

Letting occupants know their real-time consumption alone can be responsible for a 7% reduction in energy consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://americancity.org/afteroil/entry/1136/ "The Prius Effect"] by [http://americancity.org/afteroil/entry/1136/ Elizabeth Dickinson]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2013}}

'''Eurodollars''' are [[time deposit]]s denominated in [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]]s at [[bank]]s outside the [[United States]], and thus are not under the [[jurisdiction]] of the [[Federal Reserve]]. Consequently, such deposits are subject to much less regulation than similar deposits within the U.S. The term was originally coined for U.S. dollars in European banks, but it expanded over the years to its present definition. A U.S. dollar-denominated deposit in Tokyo or Beijing would be likewise deemed a Eurodollar deposit. There is no connection with the [[euro]] currency or the [[eurozone]].

More generally, the ''euro-'' prefix can be used to indicate any currency held in a country where it is not the official currency: for example, '''Euroyen''' or even '''Euroeuro'''.

== History ==

Gradually, after [[World War II]], the quantity of [[United States dollar|U.S. dollars]] outside the [[United States]] increased significantly, as a result of both the [[Marshall Plan]] and imports into the U.S., which had become the largest consumer market after World War II.

As a result, large amounts of [[United States dollar|U.S. dollars]] were in the custody of foreign banks outside the United States. Some foreign countries, including the [[Soviet Union]], also had deposits in U.S. dollars in American banks, granted by certificates. Various history myths exist for the first Eurodollar creation, or booking, but most trace back to Communist governments keeping dollar deposits abroad:–

In one version, the first booking traces back to [[History of the People's Republic of China|Communist China]], which, in 1949, managed to move almost all of its U.S. dollars to the Soviet-owned [[Banque Commerciale pour l'Europe du Nord – Eurobank|Banque Commerciale pour l'Europe du Nord]] in Paris before the United States froze the remaining assets during the Korean War.&lt;ref name="Garson 2001"/&gt;

In another version, the first booking traces back to the Soviet Union during the [[Cold War]] period, especially after the invasion of [[Hungary]] in 1956, as the Soviet Union feared that its deposits in North American banks would be frozen as a retaliation. It decided to move some of its holdings to the [[Moscow Narodny Bank]], a Soviet-owned bank with a [[United Kingdom|British]] charter. 
The British bank would then deposit that money in the U.S. banks. There would be no chance of confiscating that money, because it belonged to the British bank and not directly to the Soviets. 
On 28 February 1957, the sum of $800,000 was transferred, creating the first eurodollars. Initially dubbed "Eurbank dollars" after the bank's [[Teleprinter|telex]] address, they eventually became known as "eurodollars"&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{cite book

|authorlink=George Goodman}}&lt;/ref&gt; as such deposits were at first held mostly by [[Europe]]an banks and [[financial institution]]s.&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt; A major role was played by [[City of London]] banks, as the [[Midland Bank]], now [[HSBC]], and their offshore [[holding company|holding companies]].

In the mid-1950s, Eurodollar trading and its development into a dominant world currency began when the Soviet Union wanted better interest rates on their Eurodollars and convinced an Italian banking cartel to give them more interest than what could have been earned if the dollars were deposited in the U.S. The Italian bankers then had to find customers ready to borrow the Soviet dollars and pay above the U.S. legal interest-rate caps for their use, and were able to do so; thus, Eurodollars began to be used increasingly in global finance.&lt;ref name="Garson 2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Garson|first=Barbara|title=Money Makes the World Go Around|year=2001|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=0-670-86660-1|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eurodollars can have a higher interest rate attached to them because of the fact that they are out of reach from the Federal Reserve. U.S. banks hold an account at the Fed and can, in theory, receive unlimited liquidity from the Fed if necessary. These required reserves and Fed backing make U.S. Dollar deposits in U.S. banks inherently less risky, and Eurodollar deposits slightly more risky, which requires a slightly higher interest rate.&lt;ref name="Willette"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.traderbrains.com/what-is-a-eurodollar-and-why-does-it-have-a-different-interest-rate/ |title=What is a Eurodollar and Why Does it Have a Different Interest Rate? |last1= Willette |first1= Jeff |date= April 3, 2014 |website= traderbrains.com |accessdate= April 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 1970, 385 billion eurodollars were booked offshore.&lt;ref&gt;William Brittain-Catlin: Offshore – The Dark Side of the Global Economy; Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2005, p.8-9&lt;/ref&gt; 
These deposits were lent on as U.S. dollar loans to businesses in other countries where interest rates on loans were perhaps much higher in the local currency, and where the businesses were exporting to the USA and being paid in dollars, thereby avoiding [[foreign exchange risk]] on their loans.

Several factors led Eurodollars to overtake certificates of deposit (CDs) issued by U.S. banks as the primary private short-term money market instruments by the 1980s, including:
* The successive [[Bretton Woods system#The U.S. balance of payments crisis .281958.E2.80.9368.29|commercial deficits]] of the [[United States]]
* The U.S. Federal Reserve's ceiling on domestic deposits during the high inflation of the 1970s&lt;ref name="Burghardt"&gt;{{cite book

|title=The Eurodollar Futures and Options Handbook

|location=New York
|year=2003
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Eurodollar deposits were a cheaper source of funds because they were free of reserve requirements and deposit insurance assessments&lt;ref name="Burghardt"/&gt;

== Market size ==

By December 1985 the [[Eurocurrency]] market was estimated by [[J.P. Morgan &amp; Co.|Morgan]] Guaranty bank to have a net size of 1.668 billion, of which 75% were likely eurodollars.&lt;ref&gt;Harold G. Vatter and John F. Walker (editors): History of the U.S. Economy since World War II; Sharpe, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the markets are not responsible to any government agency its growth is hard to estimate. The Eurodollar market is by a wide margin the largest source of global finance. In 1997, nearly 90% of all international loans were made this way.&lt;ref name="Shaxson"&gt;{{cite book

== Futures contracts ==

The Eurodollar futures contract refers to the financial [[futures contract]] based upon these deposits, traded at the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]] (CME). More specifically, EuroDollar futures contracts are derivatives on the interest rate paid on those deposits. A Eurodollar future is a cash settled futures contract whose price moves in response to the interest rate offered on US Dollar denominated deposits held in European banks.{{cn|date=June 2015}} 
Eurodollar futures are a way for companies and banks to lock in an interest rate today, for money it intends to borrow or lend in the future.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikinvest:Eurodollar futures|Eurodollar futures on Wikinvest]]&lt;/ref&gt; Each CME Eurodollar futures contract has a notional or "face value" of $1,000,000, though the [[Leverage (finance)|leverage]] used in futures allows one contract to be traded with a [[Margin (finance)|margin]] of about one thousand dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmegroup.com/wrappedpages/clearing/pbrates/performancebond.html?group=CME%20INTEREST%20RATE%20FUTURES&amp;type=OutrightRates&amp;h=2&amp;reporttype=marginrate|title=Outrights/Vol Scans for Performance Bonds - Margins - CME Group|work=cmegroup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CME Eurodollar futures prices are determined by the market’s forecast of the 3-month [[United States dollar|USD]] [[London Interbank Offered Rate|LIBOR]] [[interest rate]] expected to prevail on the [[settlement date]]. A price of 95.00 implies an interest rate of 100.00 - 95.00, or 5%. The settlement price of a contract is defined to be 100.00 minus the official [[British Bankers' Association]] fixing of 3-month LIBOR on the day the contract is settled.

=== How the Eurodollar futures contract works ===

For example, if on a particular day an investor buys a single three-month contract at 95.00 (implied settlement LIBOR of 5.00%):

* if at the close of business on that day, the contract price has risen to 95.01 (implying a LIBOR decrease to 4.99%), US$25 will be paid into the investor's margin account; or
* if at the close of business on that day, the contract price has fallen to 94.99 (implying a LIBOR increase to 5.01%), US$25 will be deducted from the investor's margin account.

On the settlement date, the settlement price is determined by the actual LIBOR fixing for that day rather than a market-determined contract price.

===History===
The Eurodollar futures contract was launched in 1981, as the first cash-settled futures contract. People reportedly camped out the night before the contract’s open, flooding the pit when the CME opened the doors. That trading pit was the largest pit ever, nearly the size of a football field, and quickly became one of the most active on the trading floor, with over 1500 traders and clerks coming to work every day on what was then known as the CME’s upper trading floor. That floor is no longer, with the CME having moved over to the CBOT’s trading floor and 98% of Eurodollar trading now done electronically.{{cn|date=June 2015}}

=== Eurodollar futures contract as synthetic loan ===

A single Eurodollar future is similar to a [[forward rate agreement]] to borrow or lend US$1,000,000 for three months starting on the contract settlement date. Buying the contract is equivalent to lending money, and selling the contract short is equivalent to borrowing money.

Consider an investor who agreed to lend US$1,000,000 on a particular date for three months at 5.00% per annum (months are calculated on a 30/360 basis). Interest received in 3 months' time would be US$1,000,000 × 5.00% × 90 / 360 = US$12,500. 
* If the following day, the investor is able to lend money from the same start date at 5.01%, s/he would be able to earn US$1,000,000 × 5.01% × 90 / 360 = US$12,525 of interest. Since the investor only is earning US$12,500 of interest, s/he has lost US$25 as a result of interest rate moves.
* On the other hand, if the following day, the investor is able to lend money from the same start date only at 4.99%, s/he would be able to earn only US$1,000,000 × 4.99% × 90 / 360 = US$12,475 of interest. Since the investor is in fact earning US$12,500 of interest, s/he has gained US$25 as a result of interest rate moves.

This demonstrates the similarity. However, the contract is also different from a loan in several important respects:
* In an actual loan, the US$25 per basis point is earned or lost ''at the end of the three-month loan, not up front''. That means that the profit or loss per 0.01% change in interest rate ''as of the start date of the loan'' (i.e., its [[present value]]) is less than US$25. Moreover, the present value change per 0.01% change in interest rate is ''higher'' in ''low'' interest rate environments and ''lower'' in ''high'' interest rate environments. This is to say that an actual loan has [[bond convexity|convexity]]. A Eurodollar future pays US$25 per 0.01% change in interest rate no matter what the interest rate environment, which means it does not have convexity. This is one reason that Eurodollar futures are not a perfect proxy for expected interest rates. This difference can be adjusted for by reference to the [[implied volatility]] of options on Eurodollar futures.
* In an actual loan, the lender takes credit risk to a borrower. In Eurodollar futures, the principal of the loan is never disbursed, so the credit risk is only on the margin account balance. Moreover, even that risk is the risk of the [[Clearing house (finance)|clearinghouse]], which is considerably lower than even unsecured single-A credit risk.

=== Other features of Eurodollar futures ===

40 quarterly expirations and 4 serial expirations are listed in the Eurodollar contract.&lt;ref name="Eurodollar Contract Specifications"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cme.com/clearing/clr/spec/contract_specifications_cl.html?product=ED|title=Futures &amp; Options Trading|work=cme.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This means that on 1 January 2011, the exchange will list 40 quarterly expirations (March, June, September, December for 2011 through 2020), the exchange will also list another four serial (monthly) expirations (January, February, April, May 2011). This extends tradeable contracts over ten years, which provides an excellent picture of the shape of the [[yield curve]]. The front-month contracts are among the most liquid futures contracts in the world, with liquidity decreasing for the further out contracts. Total [[open interest]] for all contracts is typically over 10 million.

The CME Eurodollar futures contract is used to hedge [[interest rate swap]]s. There is an [[arbitrage]] relationship between the interest rate swap market, the [[forward rate agreement]] market and the Eurodollar contract. CME Eurodollar futures can be traded by implementing a spread strategy among multiple contracts to take advantage of movements in the forward curve for future pricing of interest rates.

== Sweeps ==
{{update|section|date=October 2013}}
In [[Banking in the United States|United States banking]], Eurodollars are a popular option for what are known as "[[sweep account|sweeps]]". Until 21 July 2011, banks were not allowed to pay interest on corporate [[Transactional account|checking accounts]]. To accommodate larger businesses, banks may automatically transfer, or sweep, funds from a corporation's checking account into an overnight investment option to effectively earn interest on those funds. Banks usually allow these funds to be swept either into [[Money market fund|money market mutual funds]], or alternately they may be used for bank funding by transferring to an offshore branch of a bank.

'''Ferdinand Karl Piëch''' (born 17 April 1937) is an [[Austrians|Austrian]] [[business magnate]], engineer and executive who was the chairman of the [[executive board]] (''Vorstandsvorsitzender'') of [[Volkswagen Group]] in 1993-2002 and the chairman of the [[supervisory board]] (''Aufsichtsratsvorsitzender'') of [[Volkswagen Group]] in 2002-2015.&lt;ref name="finanzen.net"/&gt;

A grandson of [[Ferdinand Porsche]], Piëch started his career at [[Porsche]], before leaving for Audi after an agreement that no member of the Porsche or Piëch families should be involved in the day-to-day operations of the company. Piëch eventually became the head of Audi, where he is credited with evolving and growing Audi into a competitor to equal [[Mercedes-Benz]] and [[BMW]], thanks in part to innovative designs such as the [[Audi Quattro|Quattro]] and [[Audi 100|100]]. In 1993, Piëch became the chairman and CEO of [[Volkswagen Group]], which he is credited with turning into the large conglomerate it is today; He oversaw the purchase of [[Lamborghini]] and [[Bentley]], as well as 
the founding of [[Bugatti Automobiles]], all of which he integrated with the [[Volkswagen]], [[Škoda Auto|Škoda]], [[SEAT]] and [[Audi]] brands into a ladder-type structure similar to that used by [[Alfred Sloan]] at [[General Motors]]. Piëch was required to retire at age 65 per Volkswagen company policy, but he remained on its supervisory board and was involved in the company's strategic decisions until his  resignation on 25 April 2015.&lt;ref name = "Ousted"&gt;{{cite news|title= Volkswagen chairman Ferdinand Piech quits in power struggle|publisher=[[BBC News]]|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-32468360|date=25 April 2015|accessdate=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Educated as an engineer, Piëch influenced the development of numerous significant cars including the [[Audi Quattro]] and notably, the [[Bugatti Veyron]], which as of 2012 was the fastest, most powerful and most expensive road legal automobile ever built.  Due to his influence on the automobile industry, Piëch was named the [[Car Executive of the Century]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= This Just In: Model T Gets Award|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E02E1DF1439F937A15751C1A96F958260|date=24 December 1999|accessdate=8 May 2008 | first=James G. | last=Cobb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Piëch was born in Vienna, Austria, to [[Louise Piëch|Louise]] (''née'' Porsche; Ferdinand's daughter) and [[Anton Piëch]], a lawyer. He studied at the [[Lyceum Alpinum Zuoz]] and graduated from the [[ETH Zurich]], [[Switzerland]], in 1962, with a degree in mechanical engineering, having written a master thesis about the development of a [[Formula One]] (F1) engine.  At the same time, Porsche was involved in F1 and developed an 8-cylinder engine for the [[Porsche 804]].

From 1963 to 1971, he worked at [[Porsche]] in [[Stuttgart]], on the development of the [[Porsche 906]] and following models that led to the successful [[Porsche 917]]. In 1972, he moved to [[Audi]] in [[Ingolstadt]]. Starting from 1975, he was manager of technological engineering, being responsible for the concepts of the [[Audi 80]] and [[Audi 100]].  He celebrated his 40th birthday on 17 April 1977 with a ball at which guests included [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] and at which the staff of the Porsche Hotel presented him with an Audi 80 that was just {{convert|40|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and constructed of [[marzipan]].&lt;ref name=AutoMotoruSport197709&gt;{{cite journal| authorlink = Ferdinand Simoneit (Ed_| title = Personalien: Ferdinand Piech| journal = [[Auto, Motor und Sport]]| volume = Heft 9 1977| pages = Seite 7 |date = 27 April 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977 he also initiated the development of a car for the [[World Rally Championship]], resulting in the [[four-wheel drive]] [[Audi Quattro]].  The engine used in the Quattro model was a [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] [[Straight-five engine|inline-5]] cylinder unit.

Piëch held a small engineering company in the time between leaving Porsche AG and joining Audi, and while there, he developed a 5 cylinder in-line [[diesel engine]] for [[Mercedes-Benz]].  He picked up the concept again after moving to Audi, because there was a market demand for engines with more than 4 cylinders. At the time, Audi (and the Audi-derived VW Passat/Santana model range) used longitudinally mounted inline engines and front wheel drive. More conservative layouts with 6 cylinders were rejected because of engineering and production costs ([[V6 engine]]) or packaging requirements ([[Straight-six engine|straight 6]] did not fit because front wheel drive required that it be mounted in front of the axis).

In 1993, Piëch moved to Volkswagen AG, parent company of the [[Volkswagen Group]], where he became [[Chairman]] of the Board of Management, succeeding [[Carl Hahn]]. At that time Volkswagen was only three months from bankruptcy, and he was central to orchestrating its dramatic turnaround.{{citation needed|date = November 2018}} He retired from the Board of Management in 2002, but still serves in an advisory capacity as Chairman of the [[Supervisory Board]].
In 2000, he was named chairman of [[Scania (company)|Scania AB]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scania.com/news/press_releases/2000/q2/press_9741.asp Ferdinand Piëch new chairman of the Scania Board] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927070038/http://www.scania.com/news/press_releases/2000/q2/press_9741.asp |date=27 September 2007 }} 24 May 2000, Scania.com.&lt;/ref&gt; He retired from the management board in 2002 and was succeeded as chairman by [[Bernd Pischetsrieder]].

While head of [[Volkswagen Group]], Piëch was known for his aggressive moves into other markets.  He drove the Volkswagen and Audi brands upmarket with great success.  Piëch also pursued other [[marque]]s, successfully acquiring [[Lamborghini]] for Audi, and establishing [[Bugatti Automobiles SAS]].  His purchase of British [[Rolls-Royce Motors|Rolls-Royce]] and [[Bentley]] was more controversial.  After successfully buying the [[Crewe]], [[England]], carbuilding operation, VW was denied the use of the Rolls-Royce brand name.  Piëch later claimed that he only really wanted the Bentley brand, but at the time the loss of Rolls to rival [[BMW]] was widely seen as a major failure.

What was not a failure, however, was his effort to revitalize Volkswagen in [[North America]].  Hahn's previous efforts to regain market share in the United States and [[Canada]]—which he had built up as the head of [[Volkswagen Group of America|Volkswagen of America]] from 1958 to 1965—were unsuccessful, but Piëch helped reverse VW's fortunes by the decision to manufacture the [[Volkswagen New Beetle]], the introduction of which in 1998 gave Volkswagen of America a much needed impulse.

Due to his continued influence in the auto industry, [[Automobile Magazine]] announced that Piëch has won their Man of the Year award for 2011.&lt;ref name = "Auto"&gt;[http://www.automobilemag.com/features/awards/1101_2011_man_of_the_year_ferdinand_piech/index.html Ferdinand Piech - 2011 Man of the Year - Automobile Magazine] Retrieved 16 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Engineering==
[[File:Bodman-Ludwigshafen - Ludwigshafen - Hafenstraße - Ludwigs Erbe r 09 ies.jpg|thumb|Relief ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Ludwigs Erbe|de}}'' by [[Peter Lenk]], close to Zollhaus and tourist information, Hafenstraße 5, Ludwigshafen am Bodensee, [[Bodman-Ludwigshafen]] in Germany: Right-hand part of the triptych, top: [[Utz Claassen]], [[Dieter Zetsche]], '''Ferdinand Piëch''', bottom: [[Leo Kirch]]]]

At Porsche, Piëch triggered significant changes in the company's policy.  For example, the position of drivers in [[auto racing|race cars]] was moved from the left to the right, as this gives advantages on the predominantly clockwise race tracks.  After making mainly small 2000&amp;nbsp;cc race cars that were supposed to be closely related to road cars, Porsche made a risky investment by unexpectedly building twenty-five 5000&amp;nbsp;cc [[Porsche 917]], surprising the rule makers at the [[FIA]].  Even [[Ferrari]] had needed to sell his company to [[Fiat]] before making such a move.  Always thinking big, Piëch started development of a [[16-cylinder engine]] for the [[Can-Am]] series.  It is probably no coincidence that his grandfather had developed a famous supercharged 16-cylinder engine for the [[Auto Union]] racing cars in the 1930s.  Piëch was denied the chance to complete it, as a turbocharged version of the existing 12-cylinder was simpler, more powerful and very successful.  Three decades later as CEO of Volkswagen Group, Piëch insisted on the very ambitious [[Bugatti Veyron]], with a [[turbocharged]] [[W16 engine|W16]]-cylinder, {{convert|1001|hp|kW}} and {{convert|407|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}} top speed. Some of these figures are still not higher than those of the Porsche 917/30, but higher than most current racing cars.  Piëch was also behind the [[Volkswagen Phaeton]] luxury saloon, which was intended as a rival to other German luxury cars, but the sales of the model have been disappointing.

==Porsche ownership==
Piëch owns a significant share of [[Porsche]], exactly 10%. In order to prevent discussions among the many family members, a policy was established in early 1972 that no [[Porsche family]] member is allowed to be involved in the management of the company.  Even company founder [[Ferry Porsche]], Piëch's uncle, only held a seat on the supervisory board of Porsche after the company's legal form was changed from a limited partnership to a private legal company.  This made Piëch move to [[Audi]] after the foundation of his engineering bureau.

==Personal life and management style==
Piëch has fathered 12 children with four different women, and is currently married to Ursula (Uschi) Piëch.&lt;ref name = "Auto" /&gt; He is [[Dyslexia|dyslexic]],&lt;ref name = "Auto" /&gt; an atheist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.celebatheists.com/wiki/Ferdinand_Piech|title=Ferdinand Piech|work=celebatheists.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has a vast car collection that includes two [[Bugatti Veyron]]s that are regularly driven by him and his wife. An aggressive and demanding manager, Piëch's prolific firing of subordinates throughout his career has been legendary in automotive circles, particularly how he engineered the ousting of former Volkswagen CEO [[Bernd Pischetsrieder]] and Porsche CEO [[Wendelin Wiedeking]].{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=September 2012}} According to Piëch, he fires any subordinate who "makes the same mistake twice".&lt;ref name = "Auto" /&gt;  However, his efforts to similarly oust chief executive [[Martin Winterkorn]] backfired and led to the resignations of Piëch and his wife from the supervisory board.&lt;ref name = "Ousted" /&gt;

'''Germán Efromovich''' (born 1948 in [[La Paz]])&lt;ref&gt;[https://exame.abril.com.br/negocios/quem-e-o-empresario-que-perdeu-a-disputa-pela-tap/], 12 June 2015 (in Portuguese)&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Bolivia]]n-born entrepreneur with [[multiple citizenship]]: [[Brazil]]ian, [[Colombia]]n, and [[Poland|Polish]]. He was born into a family of Polish [[Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rp.pl/artykul/61991,976495.html Paweł Rożyński: Całkiem fajny kraj] at ''[[Rzeczpospolita (newspaper)|Rzeczpospolita]]'', 2 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
His family is originally from Poland. Looking for a new home after [[World War II]], his parents left Poland for [[South America]], first to [[Bolivia]], where he was born, and later to [[Chile]], where Germán Efromovich was raised from 1955 in [[Arica ]] and then from 1964 in [[São Paulo]], Brazil. After schooling he earned a degree in mechanical engineering from FEI University in Brazil. His career includes selling [[encyclopedia]]s, dubbing Mexican movies into Portuguese and the ownership of a school in [[São Bernardo do Campo]], where in the 1980s he taught a union leader named [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latintrade.com/2011/05/efromovich-hardworking-visionary |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927111949/http://latintrade.com/2011/05/efromovich-hardworking-visionary |archivedate=2013-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; who later became [[President of Brazil]].

However, the oil sector laid the foundation for what evolved into the Synergy Group.  To build his [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[aviation]] empire Efromovich bought [[Avianca]], Colombia's national airline, in 2004, for US$ 2 billion, plus the assumption of US$ 220 million in debt and leasing liabilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/5f4c05e0-9519-11e1-ad38-00144feab49a.html#axzz1yusPAF58 Efromovich: Unlikely owner saves national airline] Financial Times Online, 8 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Initially performing only [[nondestructive testing]] for the Brazilian-government-run oil company, [[Petrobras]], Efromovich developed more business to the point of building and [[leasing]] [[Oil platform|oil rig]]s. His other businesses include [[power plants]], [[shipyards]] and products for the [[medical industry]].

After the sinking of one of these oil rigs in the [[South Atlantic]], off the Brazilian coast, legal disputes with insurance companies and with [[Petrobras]], Germán Efromovich began investing in [[aviation]]. This was by pure chance, because a customer, who could not pay cash in a business deal, gave him two of his aircraft. This was the beginning of an [[air taxi]] company. The Efromovich brothers called it [[OceanAir]] and started to transport staff between the oil exploration site in [[Macaé]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.estadao.com.br/noticias/economia,jose-efromovich-o-imigrante-que-construiu-um-imperio-ao-lado-do-irmao,70142.htm José Efromovich: O imigrante que construiu um império ao lado do irmão] (in English: ''José Efromovich : The immigrant who built an empire with his brother''), Estadão Online, 6 June 2011 (pt)&lt;/ref&gt; OceanAir, 2010 renamed [[Avianca Brazil]], was launched in 1998 and six years later he purchased the [[Colombia]]n legacy airline [[Avianca]] from [[Julio Mario Santo Domingo]]. As a result of his major investments in Colombia's economic and social development, Efromovich was officially made an honorary Colombian [[citizen]] in 2005 by the Colombian government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finamundo.com/internaCont_idc_256219_id_cat_229.html Empresario brasileño Efromovich recibió nacionalidad colombiana] [[EFE Agency]], retrieved 28 July 2012 (es)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presidencia.gov.co/prensa_new/sne/2005/noviembre/09/02092005.htm Official press release from the Presidency of Colombia] 9 November 2005 (es)&lt;/ref&gt;

He has control or shares in his own [[Synergy Group]], based in [[Rio de Janeiro]], which in 1998 was offering maintenance services for oil operations in Brazil. In late 2004, Efromovich's company agreed to buy a controlling stake in Avianca, which at the time was under the protection of Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. Synergy Group subsequently acquired the remainder of Avianca in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eturbonews.com/12314/efromovich-own-latin-americas-no-2-airline Efromovich to own Latin America's No. 2 airline] Global Travel Industry News Online, 18 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010, [[Avianca]] and [[TACA Airlines|TACA]] merged to [[AviancaTaca]]. TACA Group encompasses [[TACA Airlines]] and their participation in [[Lacsa]], [[TACA Peru]], [[Aviateca]], [[Sansa Airlines]], [[La Costeña (airline)|La Costeña]], [[Aeroperlas]] and [[Isleña Airlines]]. Avianca includes: Avianca, [[Tampa Cargo]] and the recently incorporated [[AeroGal]] from Ecuador. The combined Avianca and Taca is now the second-largest airline in the region in terms of revenue, behind Chilean-Brazilian's [[LATAM Airlines Group]]. All these airlines are controlled by [[Synergy Aerospace Corp.]] based in [[Bogota]], a subsidiarity of [[Synergy Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Reuters Editorial |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/18/us-portugal-tap-idUSBRE89H0X520121018 |title=Portugal picks Synergy for final TAP airline bid |publisher=Reuters |date=2012-10-18 |accessdate=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Efromovich also has shares in [[Wayraperú]], [[Avianca Ecuador]] and OceanAir, which was later renamed [[Avianca Brasil]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eturbonews.com/12314/efromovich-own-latin-americas-no-2-airline Efromovich to own Latin America's No. 2 airline] Global Travel Industry News, 18 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 November 2017, the [[Paradise Papers]], a set of confidential [[electronic document]]s relating to [[offshore investment]], revealed that Efromovich and Synergy Group's subsidiary [[Avianca Holdings]] are linked to an offshore conglomerate used for the aerocommercial [[holding business]] with ramifications in Bermuda, Panama and Cyprus. Efromovich used a Panamanian offshore that hid more than 20 firms located in tax havens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=10 November 2017|last1=Delfino|first1=Emilia|last2=Crucianelli|first2=Sandra|last3=Fitz Patrick|first3=Mariel|last4=Brom|first4=Ricardo|last5=Jastreblansky|first5=Maia|last6=Ruiz|first6=Iván|last7=Alconada Mon|first7=Hugo|title=Paradise Papers - El entramado de más de 20 offshores detrás del desembarco de Avianca|url=http://www.perfil.com/paradisepapers/paradise-papers-el-entramado-de-mas-de-20-offshores-detras-del-desembarco-de-avianca.phtml|accessdate=10 November 2017|work=[[Perfil]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Germán Efromovich is married to Hilda Liberas,related to the Gilinski,Rabinovitch and Garcias  business families from Colombia  and they have three daughters. His life is spent shuttling between both [[São Paulo]] and [[Bogotá]]. He has a younger brother named [[José Efromovich]], five years younger, who is chairman of Avianca Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://economia.estadao.com.br/videos/videos,jose-efromovich-o-imigrante-que-criou-um-imperio-ao-lado-do-irmao,139998,a,0.htm Interview in Portuguese with Estadão TV], 5 June 2011 (pt)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Gringo'''''|グリンゴ|Guringo|lead=yes}} is a [[manga]] series by [[Osamu Tezuka]] that began serialization in 1987 in the [[Shogakukan]] manga magazine ''[[Big Comic]]''.

==Plot==
In 1982, the Edo Shoji Corporation is a large [[Japan]]ese trading company that has created a new branch in the fictional country of Cannibalia (or Kanivaria depending on how you transcribe it).  Executive Director Yabushita assigns Hitoshi Himoto to be the head of the new [[South America]]n office, which is an exceptional promotion for Hitoshi.  Having joined the workforce after his days of being a [[sumo wrestling|sumo wrestler]], Hitoshi finds himself rapidly climbing the corporate ladder.

However, not long after he is assigned to South America, Director Yabushita suddenly resigns from the company.  Apparently he was involved in a scandalous affair with a woman and forced to leave after news of the affair had leaked.  This severely affects Hitoshi as he is then demoted and transferred to a different location in South America.

Hitoshi finds himself assigned to the city of Esecarta in the Republic of Santalna, a South American country that is in a state of political turmoil.  Each day, the government soldiers fight with a rebel group of guerrillas in the streets.  However, while reading some information at the Japanese [[embassy]], Hitoshi learns of a certain [[metal]] that is indispensable to the manufacturing of [[electronics]].  This rare metal is mined at Mt. Montetombo in the Fego Province of South America.  However, the mountain serves as the stronghold for the rebel guerrillas, led by the fearsome José García.

Hitoshi attempts to make a name for himself in a dangerous land, working together with the people that know him as the "Gringo". Political and [[corporate espionage|corporate intrigue]] and drama are all around in Tezuka's last manga.

==Characters==

==Unfinished work==
[[Osamu Tezuka]] died on February 9, 1989, leaving ''Gringo'' as one of his few unfinished works.  It was still in serialization only a couple of weeks before his death.  The page for ''Gringo'' at TezukaOsamu@World claims that the protagonist was based on [[Nobuyuki Wakaoji]], a Japanese businessman who was kidnapped in the [[Philippines]] in 1986 and released after four months of captivity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mahk.com/sc1617.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  This event was a major piece of shocking news that shook Japan.  Oddly, the day Tezuka died was also the day Nobuyuki Wakaoji died.

==Other manga==
In the Osamu Tezuka Manga Complete Works release of ''Gringo'', one of Tezuka's short stories, "New Ryosaishii Koukenidan", was added at the end of Volume 3.

'''Humanist Counseling in the Dutch Armed Forces''' is a task in the [[Armed forces of the Netherlands]]. [[Humanism|Humanist]] counsellors, sometimes called humanist chaplain, contribute to the (mental) well-being of military personnel, those related to them, and veterans. They do this through visible presence at the workplace, personal contact and guidance. They hold conversations, give advice and offer support. Issues concerning meaning and ethics are central to their work.&lt;ref&gt;http://humanistischverbond.nl/humanistische-geestelijke-begeleiding-defensie&lt;/ref&gt;

==Task description==

The work of humanist counsellors in the armed forces consists of:
*Presence at the workplaces, training locations and during deployments
*Individual guidance to (former) military personnel and those related to them
*Informal training for groups
*Education/training in e.g. ethics
*Philosophical/spiritual meetings
*Contribution to military ceremonies
*Identification of, and advice and counselling on issues that concern the well-being of people (humanization)
*Participation in Social Medical Teams (SMT’s), together with other aid and care workers.

Humanist counsellors are appointed as civil servants, though for carrying out their work they are viewed equivalent to the military ranks (captain, major or lieutenant colonel). They are employed in the military, not by the military, and work outside the military hierarchy. Professionally they are not accountable to the [[Ministry of Defence (Netherlands)|Ministry of Defence]] or the military authority, but to the agency that sends them, the Dutch Humanist Society (Humanistisch Verbond). This service exists primarily for the people, not for the military apparatus. Humanist counsellors thus like to call themselves (positively) critically involved. 
	
Humanist counsellors give support, but also maintain a critical distance. It means being part of the (military) unit, befriending them and gaining access to their world, while at the same time being able to pose the critical question, keeping sufficient distance to be able to see things from a different perspective, to remain the involved outsider.

Wherever the soldiers are stationed, humanist counsellors are active, working for the benefit of the mental well-being of personnel in the armed forces. Humanist counsellors are thus, also stationed outside the Netherlands, for example at [[Curaçao]], and join missions abroad as well as longer naval operations. 
 
A humanist counsellor works together with the unit they're stationed with. A counsellor goes along once in a while on patrol, helps out in the kitchen sometimes, sits with the guards at another time, or visits someone at the military field hospital. They are a member of the unit, while holding an independent position as well. They also join the deployments abroad, so they live and work in the same circumstances as the soldiers.

The humanist counseling department in the armed forces was introduced on 1 September 1964, in order to serve secular and non-religious soldiers. The department started with five counsellors. Over the years however, it has developed into one of the major counseling departments of the armed forces, with a current total of thirty eight humanist counsellors. The counsellors adopt the humanist philosophy in their work, not imposing one’s ideas onto others. In this form of counselling, the person asking for help and his own views and ways of thinking are central. But the counsellors do try to contribute to the humanization of the armed forces, by creating a more dignified, humane atmosphere.

Humanism is a life stance in which the human being is central. Humanists want to determine their life-choices themselves, assuming self-responsibility, and living autonomously, but in connection with others and the world around them.&lt;ref&gt;http://humanistischverbond.nl/humanisme&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''ISO 9000''' family of [[quality management system]]s standards is designed to help organizations ensure that they meet the needs of customers and other stakeholders while meeting statutory and regulatory requirements related to a product or service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1108/09544780210439734 |title=The state of ISO 9000 certification: A study of Swedish organizations |year=2002 |last1=Poksinska |first1=Bozena |last2=Dahlgaard |first2=Jens Jörn |last3=Antoni |first3=Marc |journal=The TQM Magazine |volume=14 |issue=5 |pages=297}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ISO]] 9000 deals with the fundamentals of quality management systems,&lt;ref name="Tsim, Yeung, Leung 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1108/02686900210429669 |title=An adaptation to ISO 9001:2000 for certified organisations |year=2002 |last1=Tsim |first1=Y.C. |last2=Yeung |first2=V.W.S. |last3=Leung |first3=Edgar T.C. |journal=Managerial Auditing Journal |volume=17 |issue=5 |pages=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the seven quality management principles upon which the family of standards is based.&lt;ref name="Tsim, Yeung, Leung 2002" /&gt;

==Background==
ISO 9000 was first published in 1987 by ISO ([[International Organization for Standardization]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsieducation.org/Education/about/brief-history.shtml|title=BSOL Academic - BSI Group|website=Bsieducation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was based on the BS 5750 series of standards from [[BSI Group|BSI]] that were proposed to ISO in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsigroup.com/en/About-BSI/News-Room/BSI-Fast-Facts2/|title=Standards, Training, Testing, Assessment and Certification - BSI Group|website=Bsigroup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, its history can be traced back some twenty years before that, to the publication of government procurement standards, such as the [[United States Department of Defense]] MIL-Q-9858 standard in 1959, and the U.K's Def Stan 05-21 and 05-24. Large organizations which supplied government procurement agencies often had to comply with a variety of quality assurance requirements for each contract awarded which led the defence industry to adopt mutual recognition of NATO AQAP, MIL-Q and Def Stan standards. Eventually, ISO 9000 was adopted as a suitable option, instead of forcing contractors to adopt multiple - and often similar - requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stamatis|first1=D H|title=Understanding ISO 9000 and Implementing the Basics to Quality|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1YGfv04PdS0C&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;dq=Def+Stan+05-21+and+05-24&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oHo-BVa1Yk&amp;sig=daVSwh3-ma79IGwMe8Pne4qSZ14&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiCsuTK76LZAhUiDMAKHRQ7Bw8Q6AEIVDAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Def%20Stan%2005-21%20and%2005-24&amp;f=false|publisher=CRC Press|accessdate=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons for use==
The global adoption of ISO 9001 may be attributable to a number of factors. In the early days, the ISO 9001 (9002 and 9003) requirements were intended to be used by procuring organizations, as the basis of contractual arrangements with their suppliers. This helped reduce the need for "supplier development" by establishing basic requirements for a supplier to assure product quality. The ISO 9001 requirements could be tailored to meet specific contractual situations, depending on the complexity of product, business type (design responsibility, manufacture only, distribution, servicing etc.) and risk to the procurer. If a chosen supplier was weak on the controls of their measurement equipment (calibration), and hence QC/inspection results, that specific requirement would be invoked in the contract. The adoption of a single Quality Assurance requirement also lead to cost savings throughout the supply chain by reducing the administrative burden of  maintaining multiple sets of quality manuals and procedures.

A few years later, the U.K. Government took steps to improve national competitiveness following publication of cmd 8621, and Third Party Certification of Quality Management Systems was born, under the auspices of the National Accreditation Council of Certification Bodies (NACCB) which has become the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS) .

In addition to several stakeholders' benefits, a number of studies have identified significant financial benefits for organizations certified to ISO 9001, with a 2011 survey from the British Assessment Bureau showing 44% of their certified clients had won new business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-assessment.co.uk/news/iso-9001-proven-to-help-win-new-business |title=ISO 9001 proven to help win new business |date=25 May 2011 |publisher=British Assessment Bureau |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728164740/http://www.british-assessment.co.uk/news/iso-9001-proven-to-help-win-new-business |archivedate=28 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Corbett ''et al.'' showed that certified organizations achieved superior [[return on assets]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsi-emea.com/Quality/CaseStudies/Interstate.pdf |title=BSI Case Study on the Benefits of ISO 9000 Registration - Interstate Worldwide Relocation |publisher=BSi Management System |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060519003025/http://www.bsi-emea.com/Quality/CaseStudies/Interstate.pdf |archivedate=19 May 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; compared to otherwise similar organizations without certification.&lt;ref name="Corbett, Montes-Sancho, Kirsch 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=20110397 |doi=10.1287/mnsc.1040.0358 |title=The Financial Impact of ISO 9000 Certification in the United States: An Empirical Analysis |year=2005 |last1=Corbett |first1=Charles J. |last2=Montes-Sancho |first2=María J. |last3=Kirsch |first3=David A. |journal=Management Science |volume=51 |issue=7 |pages=1607–16 |url=http://neumann.hec.ca/cref/sem/documents/040923.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070109164222/http://neumann.hec.ca/cref/sem/documents/040923.pdf |archivedate=9 January 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Heras ''et al.''  found similarly superior performance&lt;ref name="Corbett, Montes-Sancho, Kirsch 2005" /&gt; and demonstrated that this was statistically significant and not a function of organization size.&lt;ref name="eps.udg.es"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1108/02656710210429618 |title=ISO 9000 registration's impact on sales and profitability: A longitudinal analysis of performance before and after accreditation |year=2002 |last1=Heras |first1=Iñaki |last2=Dick |first2=Gavin P.M. |last3=Casadesús |first3=Martí |journal=International Journal of Quality &amp; Reliability Management |volume=19 |issue=6 |pages=774|url=http://kar.kent.ac.uk/5118/1/IJQRM%282002%29vol19n6.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Naveha and Marcus claimed that implementing ISO 9001 led to superior operational performance in the [[Automotive industry in the United States|U.S. automotive industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.aap.2006.11.004 |title=Financial performance, ISO 9000 standard and safe driving practices effects on accident rate in the U.S. Motor carrier industry |year=2007 |last1=Naveh |first1=Eitan |last2=Marcus |first2=Alfred |journal=Accident Analysis &amp; Prevention |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=731}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharma identified similar improvements in operating performance and linked this to superior financial performance.&lt;ref name="Sharma2005"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.intacc.2005.01.011 |title=The association between ISO 9000 certification and financial performance |year=2005 |last1=Sharma |first1=Divesh S. |journal=The International Journal of Accounting |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chow-Chua ''et al.'' showed better overall financial performance was achieved for companies in [[Denmark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1108/02656710310493643 |title=Does ISO 9000 certification improve business performance? |year=2003 |last1=Chow-Chua |first1=Clare |last2=Goh |first2=Mark |last3=Wan |first3=Tan Boon |journal=International Journal of Quality &amp; Reliability Management |volume=20 |issue=8 |pages=936}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rajan and Tamimi (2003) showed that ISO 9001 certification resulted in superior stock market performance and suggested that shareholders were richly rewarded for the investment in an ISO 9001 system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3905/joi.2003.319536 |title=Payoff to ISO 9000 Registration |year=2003 |last1=Rajan |first1=Murli |last2=Tamimi |first2=Nabil |journal=The Journal of Investing |volume=12 |pages=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the connection between superior financial performance and ISO 9001 may be seen from the examples cited, there remains no proof of direct causation, though [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal studies]], such as those of Corbett ''et al.'' (2005)&lt;ref name="Corbett, Montes-Sancho, Kirsch 2005"/&gt; may suggest it. Other writers, such as Heras ''et al.'' (2002),&lt;ref name="eps.udg.es"/&gt; have suggested that while there is some evidence of this, the improvement is partly driven by the fact that there is a tendency for better performing companies to seek ISO 9001 certification.

The mechanism for improving results has also been the subject of much research. Lo ''et al.'' (2007) identified operational improvements (e.g., cycle time reduction, inventory reductions) as following from certification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/joi.00207540600733709 |title=The difference in the perceived benefits between firms that maintain ISO certification and those that do not |year=2007 |last1=Lo |first1=Liang Kang |last2=Chang |first2=Dong Shang |journal=International Journal of Production Research |volume=45 |pages=1881–1897}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internal process improvements in organizations lead to externally observable improvements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1108/02656719710186867 |title=ISO 9000: Marketing motivations and benefits |year=1997 |last1=Buttle |first1=Francis |journal=International Journal of Quality &amp; Reliability Management |volume=14 |issue=9 |pages=936–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1108/02656710210415703 |title=Benefits of the ISO  9000:1994 system: Some considerations to reinforce competitive advantage |year=2002 |last1=Santos |first1=Leticia |last2=Escanciano |first2=Carmen |journal=International Journal of Quality &amp; Reliability Management |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=321–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; The benefit of increased international trade and domestic market share, in addition to the internal benefits such as customer satisfaction, interdepartmental communications, work processes, and customer/supplier partnerships derived, far exceeds any and all initial investment.&lt;ref name="Alcorn1995"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/9780470314661.ch3 |title=The Benefits of ISO 9000 Certification |journal=A Collection of Papers Presented at the 55th Conference on Glass Problems: Ceramic Engineering and Science Proceedings |volume=16 |issue=2 |series=Ceramic Engineering and Science Proceedings |year=2008 |last1=Alcorn |first1=Janice E. |isbn=978-0-470-31466-1 |pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==ISO 9000 series Quality Management Principles==

The ISO 9000 series are based on seven quality management principles (QMP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISO quality management principles|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/pub100080.pdf|website=Iso.org|accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The seven quality management principles are:
*QMP 1 – Customer focus
*QMP 2 – Leadership
*QMP 3 – Engagement of people
*QMP 4 – Process approach
*QMP 5 – Improvement
*QMP 6 – Evidence-based decision making
*QMP 7 – Relationship management

Principle 1 – Customer focus
: Organizations depend on their customers and therefore should understand current and future customer needs, should meet customer requirements and strive to exceed customer expectations.

Principle 2 – Leadership
: Leaders establish unity of purpose and direction of the organization. They should create and maintain the internal environment in which people can become fully involved in achieving the organization's objectives.

Principle 3 – Engagement of people
:People at all levels are the essence of an organization and their full involvement enables their abilities to be used for the organization's benefit.

Principle 4 – Process approach
:A desired result is achieved more efficiently when activities and related resources are managed as a process.

Principle 5 – Improvement
:Improvement of the organization's overall performance should be a permanent objective of the organization.

Principle 6 – Evidence-based decision making
:Effective decisions are based on the analysis of data and information.

Principle 7 – Relationship management
:An organization and its external providers (suppliers, contractors, service providers) are interdependent and a mutually beneficial relationship enhances the ability of both to create value.

'''''ISO 9001:2015 Quality management systems — Requirements''''' is a document of approximately 30 pages which is available from the national standards organization in each country.  Only ISO 9001 is directly audited against for third party assessment purposes.

Contents of ISO 9001:2015 are as follows:

* Section 1: Scope
* Section 2: Normative references
* Section 3: Terms and definitions
* Section 4: Context of the organization
* Section 5: Leadership
* Section 6: Planning
* Section 7: Support
* Section 8: Operation
* Section 9: Performance evaluation
* Section 10: Continual Improvement

Essentially the layout of the standard is similar to the previous ISO 9001:2008 standard in that it follows the [[PDCA|Plan, Do, Check, Act]] cycle in a process-based approach, but is now further encouraging this to have risk-based thinking. (section 0.3.3 of the introduction) The purpose of the quality objectives is to determine the conformity of the requirements (customers and organizations), facilitate effective deployment and improve the quality management system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.qualitydigest.com/magazine/2000/nov/article/using-quality-objectives-drive-strategic-performance-improvement.html|title=Using Quality Objectives to Drive Strategic Performance Improvement|website=Qualitydigest.com|accessdate=2017-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isopocketguides.com/media/docs/ISO2KMAN.doc|format=DOC|title=OBJECTIVE OF THE SAMPLE MANUAL|website=Isopocketguides.com|accessdate=2017-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the certification body can issue or renew a certificate, the auditor must be satisfied that the company being assessed has implemented the requirements of sections 4 to 10.  Sections 1 to 3 are not directly audited against, but because they provide context and definitions for the rest of the standard, not that of the organization, their contents must be taken into account.

The standard no longer specifies that the organization shall issue and maintain documented procedures, however, ISO 9001:2015 requires the organization to document any other procedures required for its effective operation.  The standard also requires the organization to issue and communicate a documented [[quality policy]], a quality management system scope, and quality objectives. The standard no longer requires compliant organizations to issue a formal Quality Manual. The standard does require retention of numerous records, as specified throughout the standard. New for the 2015 release is a requirement for an organization to assess risks and opportunities (section 6.1) and to determine internal and external issues relevant to its purpose and strategic direction (section 4.1). The organization must demonstrate how the standard’s requirements are being met, while the external auditor’s role is to determine the quality management system's effectiveness. More detailed interpretation and implementation examples are often sought by organizations seeking more information in what can be a very technical area.

==Certification==
[[International Organization for Standardization|International Organization for Standardization (ISO)]] does not certify organizations itself. Numerous certification bodies exist, which audit organizations and, upon success, issue ISO 9001 compliance certificates. Although commonly referred to as "ISO 9000" certification, the actual standard to which an organization's quality management system can be certified is ISO 9001:2015 (ISO 9001:2008 will expire by around September 2018). Many countries have formed [[accreditation]] bodies to authorize ("accredit") the certification bodies. Both the accreditation bodies and the certification bodies charge fees for their services. The various accreditation bodies have mutual agreements with each other to ensure that certificates issued by one of the [[accredited registrar|accredited certification bodies]] (CB) are accepted worldwide. Certification bodies themselves operate under another quality standard, ISO/IEC 17021,&lt;ref&gt;ISO/IEC 17021: "Conformity assessment. Requirements for bodies providing audit and certification of management systems" (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; while accreditation bodies operate under ISO/IEC 17011.&lt;ref&gt;ISO/IEC 17011: "Conformity assessment. General requirements for accreditation bodies accrediting conformity assessment bodies" (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

An organization applying for ISO 9001 certification is audited based on an extensive sample of its sites, functions, products, services and processes. The auditor presents a list of problems (defined as "nonconformities", "observations", or "opportunities for improvement") to management. If there are no major nonconformities, the certification body will issue a certificate.  Where major nonconformities are identified, the organization will present an improvement plan to the certification body (e.g., corrective action reports showing how the problems will be resolved); once the certification body is satisfied that the organization has carried out sufficient corrective action, it will issue a certificate.  The certificate is limited by a certain scope (e.g., production of golf balls) and will display the addresses to which the certificate refers.

An ISO 9001 certificate is not a once-and-for-all award but must be renewed at regular intervals recommended by the certification body, usually once every three years. There are no grades of competence within ISO 9001: either a company is certified (meaning that it is committed to the method and model of quality management described in the standard) or it is not. In this respect, ISO 9001 certification contrasts with measurement-based quality systems.

==Evolution of ISO 9000 standards==
The ISO 9000 standard is continually being revised by standing technical committees and advisory groups, who receive feedback from those professionals who are implementing the standard.

===1987 version===
ISO 9000:1987 had the same structure as the UK Standard BS 5750, with three "models" for quality management systems, the selection of which was based on the scope of activities of the organization:
*ISO 9001:1987 ''Model for quality assurance in design, development, production, installation, and servicing'' was for companies and organizations whose activities included the creation of new products.
*ISO 9002:1987 ''Model for quality assurance in production, installation, and servicing'' had basically the same material as ISO 9001 but without covering the creation of new products.
*ISO 9003:1987 ''Model for quality assurance in final inspection and test'' covered only the final inspection of finished product, with no concern for how the product was produced.
''ISO 9000:1987'' was also influenced by existing U.S. and other [[Defense Standard]]s ("MIL SPECS"), and so was well-suited to manufacturing. The emphasis tended to be placed on conformance with procedures rather than the overall process of management, which was likely the actual intent.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

===1994 version===
''ISO 9000:1994'' emphasized [[quality assurance]] via preventive actions, instead of just checking final product, and continued to require evidence of compliance with documented procedures. As with the first edition, the down-side was that companies tended to implement its requirements by creating shelf-loads of procedure manuals, and becoming burdened with an ISO bureaucracy. In some companies, adapting and improving processes could actually be impeded by the quality system.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

===2000 version===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:apcer.png|250px|thumb|right|The Portuguese [[ISO 9001]] certification image]] --&gt;
''ISO 9001:2000'' replaced all three former standards of 1994 issue, ''ISO 9001'', ''ISO 9002'' and ''ISO 9003''. Design and development procedures were required only if a company does, in fact, engage in the creation of new products. The 2000 version sought to make a radical change in thinking by actually placing front and centre the concept of [[process management]] (the monitoring and optimisation of a company's tasks and activities, instead of just inspection of the final product). The 2000 version also demanded involvement by upper executives in order to integrate quality into the business system and avoid delegation of quality functions to junior administrators. Another goal was to improve effectiveness via process performance metrics: numerical measurement of the effectiveness of tasks and activities. Expectations of continual process improvement and tracking customer satisfaction were made explicit.

ISO 9000 Requirements include:
* Approve documents before distribution;
* Provide correct version of documents at points of use;
* Use your records to prove that requirements have been met; and
* Develop a procedure to control your records.

===2008 version===
ISO 9001:2008 in essence re-narrates ISO 9001:2000. The 2008 version only introduced clarifications to the existing requirements of ISO 9001:2000 and some changes intended to improve consistency with [[ISO 14000|ISO 14001:2004]]. There were no new requirements. For example, in ISO 9001:2008, a quality management system being upgraded just needs to be checked to see if it is following the clarifications introduced in the amended version.

ISO 9001 is supplemented directly by two other standards of the family:

* ISO 9000:2005 "Quality management systems. Fundamentals and vocabulary"
* ISO 9004:2009 "Managing for the sustained success of an organization. A quality management approach"
Other standards, like [[ISO 19011]] and the ISO 10000 series, may also be used for specific parts of the quality system.

===2015 version===
In 2012, ISO TC 176 - responsible for ISO 9001 development - celebrated 25 years of implementing ISO 9001,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://asq.org/blog/2012/03/25-years-of-iso-9000/|title=25 Years of ISO 9000 {{!}} A View from the Q|publisher=ASQ|access-date=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and concluded that it was necessary to create a new QMS model for the next 25 years. They subsequently commenced the official work on creating a revision of ISO 9001, starting with the new QM principles. This moment was considered by important specialists in the field as "beginning of a new era in the development of quality management systems."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.asigurareacalitatii.ro/wp-content/uploads/83-02.pdf|title = The Standard ISO 9001:2015 - A Milestone in the Evolution of Quality Management|last = Bacivarov|first = Ioan|date = 1 October 2015|journal = Asigurarea Calitatii - Quality Assurance|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the intensive work from this technical committee, the revised standard ISO 9001:2015 was published by ISO on 23 September 2015. The scope of the standard has not changed; however, the structure and core terms were modified to allow the standard to integrate more easily with other international management systems standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Infographic: ISO 9001:2015 vs. 2008 revision – What has changed? |url=https://maritimecyprus.com/2016/08/11/infographic-iso-90012015-vs-2008-revision-what-has-changed/ |publisher=Maritime Cyprus |accessdate=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2015 version is also less prescriptive than its predecessors and focuses on performance. This was achieved by combining the process approach with risk-based thinking, and employing the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle at all levels in the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/news_index/news_archive/news.htm?refid=Ref2002|title=ISO 9001:2015 - Just published!|publisher=ISO |accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the key changes include:

*High-Level Structure of 10 clauses is implemented. Now all new standards released by ISO will have this high-level structure
*Greater emphasis on building a management system suited to each organization's particular needs
*A requirement that those at the top of an organization be involved and accountable, aligning quality with wider business strategy 
*Risk-based thinking throughout the standard makes the whole management system a preventive tool and encourages continuous improvement 
*Less prescriptive requirements for documentation: the organization can now decide what documented information it needs and what format it should be in 
*Alignment with other key management system standards through the use of a common structure and core text&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/about-bsi/media-centre/press-releases/2015/august/BSI-obtains-first-global-accreditation-for-the-new-Quality-Management-standard-ISO-90012015-from-ANAB/#.Vem-kxFVhBc|title=BSI obtains first global accreditation from ANAB to certify organizations to the new Quality Management standard ISO 9001:2015|publisher=BSI |accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Inclusion of Knowledge Management principles
*Quality Manual &amp; Management representative (MR) are no longer mandatory

==Auditing==

Two types of auditing are required to become registered to the standard: auditing by an external certification body (external audit) and audits by internal staff trained for this process (internal audits). The aim is a continual process of review and assessment to verify that the system is working as it is supposed to, to find out where it can improve, and to correct or prevent identified problems. It is considered healthier for internal auditors to audit outside their usual management line, so as to bring a degree of independence to their judgements.

==Industry-specific interpretations==
The ISO 9001 standard is generic; its parts must be carefully interpreted to make sense within a particular organization. [[Software development process|Developing software]] is not like making [[cheese]] or offering [[counseling]] services, yet the ISO 9001 guidelines, because they are business management guidelines, can be applied to each of these.  Diverse organizations&amp;mdash;police departments (United States), professional [[soccer]] teams (Mexico), and city councils (UK)&amp;mdash;have successfully implemented ISO 9001:2000 systems.

Over time, various industry sectors have wanted to standardize their interpretations of the guidelines within their own marketplace.  This is partly to ensure that their versions of ISO 9000 have their specific requirements, but also to try and ensure that more appropriately trained and experienced auditors are sent to assess them.

* The '''[[TickIT]]''' guidelines are an interpretation of ISO 9000 produced by the UK Board of Trade to suit the processes of the information technology industry, especially software development.
* '''[[AS9000]]''' is the Aerospace Basic Quality System Standard, an interpretation developed by major aerospace manufacturers. Those major manufacturers include AlliedSignal, Allison Engine, Boeing, General Electric Aircraft Engines, Lockheed-Martin, McDonnell Douglas, Northrop Grumman, Pratt &amp; Whitney, Rockwell-Collins, Sikorsky Aircraft, and Sundstrand. The current version is '''[[AS9100|AS9100D]]'''.
* '''PS 9000''' * '''QS 9000''' is an interpretation agreed upon by major automotive manufacturers (GM, Ford, Chrysler). It includes techniques such as [[failure mode and effects analysis|FMEA]] and [[Advanced Product Quality Planning|APQP]]. QS 9000 is now replaced by ISO/TS 16949.
* '''[[ISO/TS 16949|ISO/TS 16949:2009]]''' is an interpretation agreed upon by major automotive manufacturers (American and European manufacturers); the latest version is based on ISO 9001:2008. The emphasis on a process approach is stronger than in ISO 9001:2008. ISO/TS 16949:2009 contains the full text of ISO 9001:2008 and automotive industry-specific requirements.
* '''[[TL 9000]]''' is the Telecom Quality Management and Measurement System Standard, an interpretation developed by the telecom consortium, [http://www.questforum.org QuEST Forum]. In 1998 QuEST Forum developed the TL 9000 Quality Management System to meet the supply chain quality requirements of the worldwide telecommunications industry. The TL 9000 standard is made up of two handbooks: the QMS Requirements Handbook, and the QMS Measurement Handbook. The current versions of the Requirements and Measurements Handbooks are 5.0. Unlike ISO 9001 or other sector-specific standards, TL 9000 includes standardized product and process measurements that must be reported into a central repository, which allows organizations to benchmark their performance in key process areas against peer organizations. It is important to note that TL 9000 R5.0 contains the full text of ISO 9001:2008. 
* '''[[ISO 13485]]:2016''' is the medical industry's equivalent of ISO 9001. ISO 13485:2016 is a stand-alone standard. Because ISO 13485 is relevant to medical devices manufacturers (unlike ISO 9001, which is applicable to any industry), and because of the differences between the two standards relating to continual improvement, compliance with ISO 13485 does not necessarily mean compliance with ISO 9001 (and vice versa).
* '''[[ISO/IEC 90003]]:2014''' provides guidelines for the application of ISO 9001 to computer software.
* '''[[ISO/TS 29001]]''' is quality management system requirements for the design, development, production, installation, and service of products for the petroleum, petrochemical, and natural gas industries.  It is equivalent to API Spec Q1 without the Monogram annex.
* '''[[ISO 22000]]''' Food Safety Management Systems.

==Effectiveness==
{{Original research|section|date=May 2013}}

The debate on the effectiveness of ISO 9000 commonly centres on the following questions:
#Are the quality principles in ISO 9001 of value?
#Does it help to implement an ISO 9001-compliant quality management system?
#Does it help to obtain ISO 9001 certification?

The effectiveness of the ISO system being implemented depends on a number of factors, the most significant of which are:
#Commitment of senior management to monitor, control, and improve quality. Organizations that implement an ISO system without this desire and commitment often take the cheapest road to get a certificate on the wall and ignore problem areas uncovered in the audits.
#How well the ISO system integrates into current business practices.  Many organizations that implement ISO try to make their system fit into a cookie-cutter quality manual instead of creating a manual that documents existing practices and only adds new processes to meet the ISO standard when necessary.
#How well the ISO system focuses on improving the customer experience.  The broadest definition of quality is "Whatever the customer perceives good quality to be."  This means that a company doesn't necessarily have to make a product that never fails; some customers will have a higher tolerance for product failures if they always receive shipments on-time or have a positive experience in some other dimension of customer service.  An ISO system should take into account all areas of the customer experience and the industry expectations, and seek to improve them on a continual basis.  This means taking into account all processes that deal with the three stakeholders (customers, suppliers, and organization); only then will a company be able to sustain improvements in the customer's experience.
#How well the auditor finds and communicates areas of improvement.  While ISO auditors may not provide consulting to the clients they audit, there is the potential for auditors to point out areas of improvement.  Many auditors simply rely on submitting reports that indicate compliance or non-compliance with the appropriate section of the standard; however, to most executives, this is like speaking a foreign language.  Auditors that can clearly identify and communicate areas for improvement in language and terms executive management understands facilitate action on improvement initiatives by the companies they audit.  When management doesn't understand why they were non-compliant and the business implications associated with non-compliance, they simply ignore the reports and focus on what they do understand.

===Advantages===
Proper quality management can improve business, often having a positive effect on investment, market share, sales growth, sales margins, competitive advantage, and avoidance of litigation.&lt;ref name="sroufe"&gt;Sroufe, Robert and Sime Curkovic, "An examination of ISO 9000:2000 and supply chain quality assurance." Journal of Operations Management, Volume 26, Issue 4, July 2008, Pages 503-520&lt;/ref&gt; The quality principles in ISO 9000:2000 are also sound, according to Wade &lt;ref name="wade"/&gt; and Barnes, who says that "ISO 9000 guidelines provide a comprehensive model for quality management systems that can make any company competitive".&lt;ref name="barnes"/&gt; Sroufe and Curkovic, (2008) found benefits ranging from registration required to remain part of a supply base, better documentation, to cost benefits, and improved involvement and communication with management.&lt;ref name="sroufe"/&gt; According to ISO&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Debunking the myths|url=https://www.iso.org/files/live/sites/isoorg/files/archive/pdf/en/iso_9001_debunking_the_myths.pdf|website=Iso.org|publisher=International Organization for Standardization|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 2015 version of the standard brings the following benefits:
#By assessing their context, organizations can define who is affected by their work and what they expect. This enables clearly stated business objectives and the identification of new business opportunities.  
#Organizations can identify and address the risks associated with their organization.
#By putting customers first, organizations can make sure they consistently meet customer needs and enhance customer satisfaction. This can lead to more repeat customers, new clients and increased business for the organization. 
#Organizations work in a more efficient way as all their processes are aligned and understood by everyone. This increases productivity and efficiency, bringing internal costs down. 
#Organizations will meet necessary statutory and regulatory requirements. 
#Organizations can expand into new markets, as some sectors and clients require ISO 9001 before doing business.

===Criticisms of ISO 9001 certification===
A common criticism of ISO 9000 and 9001 is the amount of money, time, and paperwork required for a complete implementation, and later when needed; ISO 9001 certification.&lt;ref name="clifford" /&gt; Dalgleish cites the "inordinate and often unnecessary paperwork burden" of ISO, and says that "quality managers feel that ISO's overhead and paperwork are excessive and extremely inefficient".&lt;ref name="dalgleish 2003"&gt;{{cite web |first=Scott |last=Dalgleish |url=http://www.qualitymag.com/articles/84308-probing-the-limits-br-iso-9000-more-hindrance-than-help |title=Probing the Limits - ISO 9000: More Hindrance Than Help |work=Quality Magazine |date=5 May 2003 |accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The level of minimum documentation for a minimum scope organization has been greatly reduced going from ISO 9001:2000, through ISO 9001:2008 and lastly ISO 9001:2015.

According to Barnes, "Opponents claim that it is only for documentation. Proponents believe that if a company has documented its quality systems, then most of the paperwork has already been completed".&lt;ref name="barnes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allbusiness.com/specialty-businesses/713376-1.html |title=Good Business Sense Is the Key to Confronting ISO 9000 |first=Frank |last=Barnes |work=Review of Business |date=Spring 2000|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227121123/http://www.allbusiness.com/specialty-businesses/713376-1.html|archivedate=27 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson suggests that ISO standards "elevate inspection of the correct procedures over broader aspects of quality", and therefore, "the workplace becomes oppressive and quality is not improved".&lt;ref name="wilson" /&gt;

One study showing reasons for not adopting this standard include the risks and uncertainty of not knowing if there are direct relationships to improved quality, and what kind and how many resources will be needed.  Additional risks include how much certification will cost, increased bureaucratic processes and risk of poor company image if the certification process fails.&lt;ref name="sroufe"/&gt; According to [[John Seddon]], ISO 9001 promotes specification, [[Control (management)|control]], and procedures rather than [[understanding]] and improvement.&lt;ref name="seddon" /&gt; Wade argues that ISO 9000 is effective as a guideline, but that promoting it as a standard "helps to mislead companies into thinking that certification means better quality, ... [undermining] the need for an organization to set its own quality standards".&lt;ref name="wade"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bin.co.uk/IMS_May_2002.pdf |title=Is ISO 9000 really a standard? |first=Jim |last=Wade |publisher=ISO Management Systems |date=May–June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In short, Wade argues that reliance on the specifications of ISO 9001 does not guarantee a successful quality system.

The standard is seen as especially prone to failure when a company is interested in certification before quality.&lt;ref name="seddon"/&gt; Certifications are in fact often based on customer contractual requirements rather than a desire to actually improve quality.&lt;ref name="barnes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="henricks"/&gt; "If you just want the certificate on the wall, chances are you will create a paper system that doesn't have much to do with the way you actually run your business", said ISO's Roger Frost.&lt;ref name="henricks"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/magazine/entrepreneur/2001/december/46342.html |title=ISO a GO-Go |first=Mark |last=Henricks |work=Entrepreneur Magazine |date=December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certification by an independent auditor is often seen as the problem area, and according to Barnes, "has become a vehicle to increase consulting services".&lt;ref name="barnes"/&gt;

Dalgleish argues that while "quality has a positive effect on return on investment, market share, sales growth, better sales margins and competitive advantage," "taking a quality approach is unrelated to ISO 9000 registration."&lt;ref name="dalgleish 2005"&gt;{{cite web |first=Scott |last=Dalgleish |url=http://www.qualitymag.com/articles/84308-probing-the-limits-br-iso-9000-more-hindrance-than-help |title=Probing the Limits: ISO 9001 Proves Ineffective |work=Quality Magazine |date=1 April 2005 |accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, ISO itself advises that ISO 9001 can be implemented without certification, simply for the quality benefits that can be achieved.&lt;ref name="isosurvey"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/en/iso9000-14000/pdf/survey2005.pdf |title=The ISO Survey – 2005 |version=Abridged version |format=PDF |publisher=ISO |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abrahamson argues that fashionable management discourse such as [[Quality Circles]] tends to follow a [[Enterprise life cycle|lifecycle]] in the form of a [[Normal distribution|bell curve]], possibly indicating a [[management fad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=258636 |pages=254–285 |last1=Abrahamson |first1=E. |title=Management Fashion |volume=21 |issue=1 |journal=The Academy of Management Review |year=1996 |doi=10.5465/amr.1996.9602161572}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pickrell argues{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} that ISO systems merely gauge whether the processes are being followed. It does not gauge how good the processes are or whether the correct parameters are being measured and controlled to ensure quality. Furthermore, when unique technical solutions are involved in the creation of a new part, ISO does not validate the robustness of the technical solution which is a key part of advanced quality planning. It is not unheard of for an ISO-certified plant to display poor quality performance due to poor process selection and/or poor technical solutions.

The '''Institute of Financial Accountants (IFA)''' is a [[professional body]] representing and providing certification for financial accountants in the [[United Kingdom]].  The IFA is a full member of the [[International Federation of Accountants]].

==History==
The Institute was founded in 1916.&lt;ref name=accounting-history&gt;[http://www.icaew.com/en/library/historical-resources/accountancy-profession/index-of-uk-and-irish-accountancy-and-professional-bodies Index of UK and Irish Accountancy and Professional Bodies] at [[ICAEW]] website&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1973, the IFA established the [[International Association of Book-keepers]] (IAB)&lt;ref name=accounting-history/&gt;&lt;ref name=IFAbenfund&gt;IFA. [http://www.ifa.org.uk/members/new-members/membership-benefits/benevolent-fund/ Benevolent Fund] Page accessed June 21, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and members of IAB participate in IFA's benevolent fund.&lt;ref name=IFAbenfund/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Open Charities. [http://opencharities.org/charities/234082 The Institute of Financial Accountants and International Association of Book-Keepers Benevolent Fund] Page accessed June 21, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the [[Chartered Institute of Management Accountants]] (CIMA) granted reciprocal exemption to the IFA for seven of its exams.&lt;ref name=AA1007Aug&gt;[http://www.accountancyage.com/aa/news/1785081/institutes-ifa-acca-damages-claim-syllabus-copying IFA faces big ACCA damages claim for syllabus copying], ''Accountancy Age'', 8 Aug 1997&lt;/ref&gt; However, in that same year [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants|ACCA]] sued IFA for plagiarising ACCA's examination syllabi.&lt;ref name=AA1007Aug/&gt;  The parties neared a settlement agreement.&lt;ref&gt;John Stokdyk for Accountancy Age. 01 Jul 1998 [http://www.accountancyage.com/aa/news/1771012/institutes-acca-issues-plagiarism-writ Institutes - ACCA issues plagiarism writ]&lt;/ref&gt; However ''Accountancy Age'' reported that, "The High Court found the IFA had plagiarised large portions of ACCA's syllabus, including a typographical error."&lt;ref&gt;Accountancy Age, 17 July 1998 [http://www.accountancyage.com/aa/news/1783936/news-brief-july News in Brief]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, during a round of merger talks between certain chartered bodies, talks took place with the [[ICAEW]] with a view to establishing IFA both as a feeder body, and as a 'fall-back' professional body for accountants who had not passed the final exams of other bodies such as CIMA or ACCA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accountancyage.com/aa/news/1764999/icaew-talks-planned-home-failed-chartereds ICAEW talks planned new home for 'failed' chartereds], ''Accountancy Age'', 19 Jan 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, talks took place between the IFA, the [[Association of Accounting Technicians]] (AAT) and the [[International Association of Book-keepers]] (IAB), regarding the creation of a joint qualification structure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accountancyage.com/aa/news/1757639/accounting-bodies-discuss-qualifications-merger Accounting bodies to discuss qualifications merger], ''Accountancy Age'', 24 Apr 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2007, IFA members are recognised by [[HM Treasury]] as supervisors under [[Money_laundering#Enforcement|anti-money laundering legislation]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/anti-money-laundering-and-counter-terrorist-finance-supervision-reports/anti-money-laundering-and-counter-terrorist-finance-supervision-report-2012-13 HM Treasury AML/CFT Report] Retrieved 15 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the IFA became an associate member of the [[International Federation of Accountants]] (IFAC), and a full member in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifac.org/news-events/2011-11/international-federation-accountants-welcomes-new-members-and-associates International Federation of Accountants Welcomes New Members and Associates], IFAC, 16 November 2011. Retrieved 17 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

IFA merged with the [[Federation of Tax Advisers]] (FTA) in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fta.uk.com/FTA/downloads/pdf/pressreleases/PR8_FTA_Conference.pdf FTA’s First Annual Conference celebrated its merge with the IFA Group], FTA, 8 June 2009.  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/60AwKOP0Q?url=http://www.fta.uk.com/FTA/downloads/pdf/pressreleases/PR8_FTA_Conference.pdf |date=14 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the IFA announced a merger with the [[Institute of Public Accountants]] of Australia to form the IPA Group; the world's largest SME/SMP professional accountancy body. Members of the IFA obtained membership of the IPA at their equivalent IFA membership grade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.professionalplanner.com.au/cut-and-paste/2014/10/15/ipa-and-ifa-unite-to-form-the-worlds-largest-smesmp-accounting-group-31746/ Professional Planner]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.accountancylive.com/uk-ifa-and-australian-ipa-institutes-merge Accountancy Live 18 Dec 2014, Retrieved 10 Jan 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2015, IFA had about 10,000 members in about 80 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifa.org.uk/about-us/ IFA.ORG About Us] Retrieved 29 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership and certifications==
To be admitted to membership of the IFA, applicants must generally complete a period of relevant work experience and pass a series of examinations; applicants can also be admitted to membership by way of exemption or by accreditation of prior learning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifa.org.uk/members/new-members/routes-to-membership/ Routes to membership]. IFA.&lt;/ref&gt;

IFA is recognised by the [[Ofqual|Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation]] (Ofqual). Ofqual regulates qualifications, examinations and assessments in England and vocational qualifications in Northern Ireland and grants formal recognition to bodies and organisations that deliver qualifications and assessments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ofqual.gov.uk/who-we-are Who we are], Ofqual. Retrieved 14 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; As of June 2015 IFA offers various certifications in financial accounting, tax advisement, and financial and business management, all in [[small and medium-sized enterprises]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://register.ofqual.gov.uk/Qualification?recognitionNumber=RN5331 The Register of Regulated Qualifications] Ofqual Register Retrieved 11 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==University links==

In 2003, the IFA agreed to grant membership to accountancy graduates from the Bolton Institute, now the [[University of Bolton]], where the course includes vocational aspects.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=B_4BJWXYnmkC&amp;lpg=PA440&amp;ots=qzPKLfWrxr&amp;dq=Institute%20of%20Financial%20Accountants%20membership%20levels&amp;pg=PA440#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false British Qualifications], [[Kogan Page]], 36th Edition (2006), page 440&lt;/ref&gt;

[[University of Northampton]] cooperates with IFA to offer [[continuing professional development]] for IFA members, leading to a BA (Hons) degree.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northampton.ac.uk/study/courses/courses-by-subject/business-and-management/international-accounting-topup-ba-hons-ifa University of Northampton International Accounting (Top Up BA Hons) IFA] Retrieved 21 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jacques Dauphin''' (July 4, 1923 &amp;ndash; April 1, 1994) was a French advertising pioneer&lt;ref name="He is referred to as a pioneer"&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of FEPE|url=http://www.fepe.com/page.php?id=31|publisher=FEPE official website}}&lt;/ref&gt;  founder and CEO of Dauphin OTA. He is best known as the father of modern [[billboard]] [[advertising]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Durand|first=Dominique|title=Le Livre du Mur Peint (Painted Walls) - Preface by Jacques Dauphin as the inventor of painted walls as advertising mediums|year=1985|publisher=Editions Alternatives|location=Paris|pages=166|url=http://www.priceminister.com/offer/buy/131712145/le-livre-du-mur-peint-art-et-techniques-de-durand-dominique-et-boulogne-daniel.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Innovation and OOH are synonymous: John Ellery|url=http://www.mxmindia.com/2011/09/exclusive-interview-with-john-ellery/}} Jacques Dauphin is cited as "legendary".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notre histoire|url=http://www.clearchannel.fr/notre-histoire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 Dauphin OTA was sold to the American company [[Clear Channel]] and became an emblematic part of its outdoor communication division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Company History|url=http://www.clearchannel.com/Corporate/PressRelease.aspx?PressReleaseID=1166&amp;p=hidden|publisher=Clear Channel official website}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clear Channel acquires Dauphin OTA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Clear Channel Buys Stake In French Outdoor Ad Company|url=http://www.sddt.com/News/article.cfm?SourceCode=19990611fai|publisher=San Diego Daily Transcript}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
After graduating with a law degree from Faculte de droit de Paris and from [[HEC Paris]], Jacques Dauphin re-opened the Parisian-based office created by his father Eugene Dauphin&lt;ref name="Eugene Dauphin"&gt;{{cite web|last=Barrett|first=Lucy|title=Media Briefs|url=http://www.prweek.com/uk/news/58816/Media-Briefs/?DCMP=ILC-SEARCH|publisher=Marketing|accessdate=17 June 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in 1921 who closed it during WWII to prevent any collaboration with the Nazis. He then developed the company to a broader scale after the French Liberation expanding its activities (mainly billboard advertising and radio) to other European countries including the UK, Belgium, Italy or Spain.&lt;ref name="Eugene Dauphin"/&gt; Jacques Dauphin has notably created and developed the 4x3 format that remains today the international standard format used in billboard advertising worldwide.

==Career==
His professional achievements have been honoured in several occasions and he has successively occupied the following positions: president (1958 - 1966) of the national outdoor advertising federations of France, Germany, Belgium, Finland, Italy and the Netherlands best known as FEPE that he created&lt;ref name="He is referred to as a pioneer"/&gt; and the [[International Advertising Association]]. He was then vice-president (1969), president (1972 - 1974), and honorary president of the French Chambers of advertising. He presided the 3rd World Congress of Outdoor Advertising in London in 1972. He was a member of the International Commission « Publicité distribution » of the International Chamber of Commerce, and co-president of Grand prix international de l´affichage. He has been made Knight of the [[Legion of Honour]] and Knight of the [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]] by the French authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dauphin Coat of Arms and Name History|url=http://www.houseofnames.com/dauphin-coat-of-arms|publisher=House of Names}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Personal Interests==
[[File:Dauphin aime le cinéma, Cannes 1989.jpg|thumb|344x344px|Dauphin’s campaign and billboard advertising in support of the Cannes Film Festival - 1989]]Through Dauphin OTA Jacques Dauphin was also particularly active in the promotion of the arts and image. 

He notably promoted the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and the French International Contemporary Art Fair best known as FIAC.

Through Dauphin, Jacques Dauphin has commissioned and inspired various artists, such as [[Daniel Buren]] or [[François Morellet]] among others.

Jacques Dauphin has turned billboard advertising into a popular art form, a witness of the contemporary society, and one of the leading media of the XXth century in Europe.

==Other facts==
After his only son died in a tragic car accident in 1988 Jacques Dauphin had no heir to take up the business that has led to the sale of the company in 1999.

His only heiress is his only granddaughter Charlotte de La Rochefoucauld (born Charlotte Dauphin in 1987) who has married Comte Charles-Henri de La Rochefoucauld in 2012 in Saint-Louis des Invalides cathedral in Paris, France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=William 1|title=Hanover8|url=http://www.william1.co.uk/han8.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=The Royal forums|title=Noble Marriages Announcements 2012|url=http://www.theroyalforums.com/forums/f265/noble-marriages-announcements-2012-a-32280-3.html|publisher=The Royal Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacques Dauphin's life and career, his personality, leadership, and his passion for sailing have inspired French film director [[Claude Lelouch]] for his film [[Itinerary of a Spoiled Child]] and its lead character Sam Lion.

== Quotes ==
“Billboard advertising is a visual rape.”

“Our billboards are our stage, our trestles: we are an entertainment business, a performing art company.”

“Billboards are the infantry of advertising.”

A '''kommanditselskab''' (abbreviated K/S) is the [[Denmark|Danish ]] equivalent of the [[limited partnership]]. The owners are divided into general partners (''komplementarer'' in Danish) and limited partners (''kommanditister'' in Danish). Often the only general partner of a K/S is an [[Anpartsselskab]] with the least possible capital, thus reducing the liability of the K/S to the capital of the Anpartsselskab.

==Liability==

The general partners have [[joint and several liability]] for the debts of the partnership while the limited partners have [[limited liability]] i.e. they are only liable on debts incurred by the firm to the extent of their investment.

Often it is the general partners who are running the company while the limited partners acts as passive investors.

==Taxation of a K/S==

In Danish tax law a K/S is not taxable and does thus not pay corporation taxes. This means that the assets of the K/S is taxed as personal assets of the owners. This is a great advantage if the K/S is having a deficit as this can be subtracted from the taxable income of the owners.

'''Labour battalions''' have been a form of [[alternative service]] or [[unfree labour]] in various countries in lieu of or resembling regular [[military service]]. In some cases they were the result of some kind of [[discrimination|discriminative]] segregation of the population, while in some others they have been a conscious choice.

==Political reasons==
In some countries labour battalions were created from part of population which for various reasons were not suitable for regular military service, often because this population was considered "undesirable" or "unreliable", e.g., political enemies, population of occupied territories or "lower [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]]".

Examples include labour battalions in the late [[Ottoman Empire]] and early [[Turkish Republic]] both [[Labour Battalions (Ottoman Empire)|during World War I]] and [[The Twenty Classes|during World War II]], [[labour service (Hungary)|labour service in Hungary during World War II]], as well as labour battalions in other territories held by [[Nazi Germany]] and its allies (see also  "[[Hiwi (volunteer)|Hiwi]]".).

==Alternative service==
In some countries labour battalions are a form of alternative [[conscription]] for people who cannot join military service for various reasons, e.g., due to bad health or being [[conscientious objector]]s to any forms of violence.

Until the last days of the [[Soviet Union]] with obligatory military duty in the state, men deemed unfit to regular military duty, as well as many able-bodied ones, were assigned to ''[[construction battalion (Soviet Union)|construction battalion]]s'' (стройбаты) of the [[Soviet Army]] .

'''Nuri Demirağ''' (born 1886 in [[Divriği]] – died 1957 in [[Istanbul]]) was an early [[Turkish people|Turkish]] [[Business magnate|industrialist]]. He was one of the first millionaires of the [[Turkish Republic]].

==Biography==
His first enterprise was a [[Rolling paper|cigarette paper]] factory which commenced production in 1922. Starting from the late 1920s, Demirağ began to invest his capital in the development of the Turkish railway network. Because of this investment, [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] gave him the surname ''Demirağ'' (meaning "Iron web") when the [[Surname Law]] was put into effect in 1934.

In 1936 he established an aircraft factory employing 500 people in [[Beşiktaş]], [[Istanbul]] (later nationalized by the government and now occupied by the [[Istanbul Naval Museum]]). The production of the [[Nuri Demirağ Nu D.36|Nu D.36]] two-seat [[trainer (aircraft)|trainer]] [[biplane]], and [[Nuri Demirağ Nu D.38|Nu D.38]] twin-engine [[high-wing]] [[airplane|light transport plane]] took place in this factory.

In 1945 he founded the first opposition party, which was named ''Milli Kalkınma Partisi'' ([[National Development Party (Turkey)|National Development Party]]), but his party failed to receive the required amount of votes for entering the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|Turkish parliament]] in the 1946 and 1950 general elections, and was eventually dissolved in 1958, a year after his death. In 1954, he was elected as a [[member of parliament]] for [[Sivas]] on behalf of the [[Democrat Party (Turkey, historical)|Democratic Party]], which won the general elections.

Demirağ donated his airplanes to his flying school (''Gök Okulu'') in [[Yeşilköy]], which he established for attracting the interest of young Turks in aviation. The land upon which the school was built was later nationalized by the Turkish government in order to enlarge the neighbouring Yeşilköy Airport ([[Atatürk International Airport]]) which was originally established as a military air base of the [[Ottoman Air Force]] in 1911.

Demirağ died in 1957 from [[diabetes]].

The '''Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions''' ('''OSFI'''; {{lang-fr|Bureau du surintendant des institutions financières}}) is an [[Structure of the Canadian federal government|independent agency]] of the [[Government of Canada]] reporting to the [[Minister of Finance (Canada)|Minister of Finance]] created "to contribute to public confidence in the Canadian financial system". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lois.justice.gc.ca/en/O-2.7/253439.html|title=Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Act}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the sole regulator of banks, and the primary regulator of insurance companies, trust companies, loan companies and pension plans in Canada.

The current Superintendent is Jeremy Rudin, appointed in June 2014. He replaced [[Julie Dickson]], who retired. The term of the appointment is seven years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/new-osfi-head/article19163329/ "Jeremy Rudin to replace Julie Dickson as head of OSFI", by Tara Perkins and Kevin Carmichael, ''Globe and Mail'', June 13, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; 
== Mandate ==
The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) was created to contribute to public confidence in the Canadian financial system. 

OSFI's role is to:

* Supervise institutions and pension plans to determine whether they are in sound financial condition and meeting minimum plan funding requirements respectively, and are complying with their governing law and supervisory requirements; 
* Promptly advise institutions and plans in the event there are material deficiencies and take or require management, boards or plan administrators to take necessary corrective measures expeditiously; 
* Advance and administer a regulatory framework that promotes the adoption of policies and procedures designed to control and manage risk; 
* Monitor and evaluate system-wide or sectoral issues that may impact institutions negatively. 

OSFI’s legislation has due regard to the need to allow institutions to compete effectively and take reasonable risks. The legislation also recognizes that management, boards of directors and plan administrators are ultimately responsible and that financial institutions and pension plans can fail. 

The Office of the Chief Actuary, which is part of OSFI, provides actuarial services to the Government of Canada.

== History ==
Late 1800s – establishment of the Office of the Superintendent of Insurance (OSI), which subsequently became the Department of Insurance (DOI). The DOI was responsible for overseeing federally licensed life insurance companies, property and casualty insurance companies, trust and loan companies and pension plans, and for providing actuarial services to the government. 

1925 – the Office of the Inspector General of Banks was established in response to the Home Bank failure and was responsible for regulating Canada's chartered banks. 

Early 1930s – [[Royal Commission on Banking and Currency]] reviewed banking and currency issues in the Canadian financial system. 

Early 1960s – Porter Royal Commission reviewed structural and operational issues affecting the financial system and financial institutions in Canada. The Commission's report concluded the financial system was sound, but developments had moved beyond the current state of laws and regulatory practices. Porter argued the public could not be insulated from loss in dealing with public institutions and markets. The Commission called for a system that would provide for adequate disclosure and that would set high standards of self-regulation, backed by strong government supervision and powers to enforce proper practices. 

1967 – the Minister of Finance introduced legislation to establish the [[Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (CDIC) to ensure the safety of small deposits and bring about a gradual improvement in the minimum financial standard of deposit-taking institutions in Canada. In 1983, legislative amendments extended CDIC's mandate to include assisting to maintain public confidence and stability in the financial system. 

Mid-1980s – increased international competition and the failure of two Canadian banks and the subsequent enquiry into these failures by the Honourable Willard Z. Estey highlighted the need to ensure a sound approach to handling the risks associated with the financial marketplace. 

July 1987 – to ensure a coordinated approach to supervision and a modern regulatory framework for Canada's financial system, and acting on the recommendations of the Estey commission, the government proclaimed the Financial Institutions and Deposit Insurance Amendment Act and the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Act. This latter Act joined the Department of Insurance and the Office of the Inspector General of Banks to form OSFI, which was given the powers to supervise and regulate all federally regulated financial institutions. 

May 1996 – Bill C-15 receives Royal Assent. This new legislation clarifies OSFI's prime responsibilities as helping to minimize losses to depositors, policy holders, and pension plan members and to maintain public confidence in the Canadian financial system. Preventing failure of financial institutions is not part of OSFI's mandate; however, promoting sound business practices helps reduce the risk that financial institutions will fail. The mandate stresses the importance of early intervention to achieve OSFI's objectives and establishes the basis for OSFI's mission, objectives, priorities and strategies.

'''The Peak Time''' is an international student business competition organized every year by the students of the [[Stockholm School of Economics in Riga]]. Currently, it is one of the biggest international events held in the [[Baltic states|Baltic States]], attracting attention from about around 2000 students from 70 countries, i.e., USA, Germany, UK, Brazil, Canada, Singapore, Sweden, China, Italy, and others. Over 16 years, thousands of students have applied and competed against each other, to win prizes and gain experience. Participants of the competition are tested in their [[Business analysis|analytic]] and [[Decision-making|decision making]] skills in an online business simulation provided by CESIM, but their ability to provide creative solutions for real life business problems is challenged in [[Case study|case studies]] prepared by consultancy companies. Teams and individuals which break to the finals in [[Riga]] not only compete for main prizes, but also have an opportunity to listen to world famous speakers and attend social and networking events.

== History ==

Peak Time has originated in year 1999, where it was first organized at the Stockholm School of Economics in Riga, exclusively by the students themselves. The initial aim of the competition was “to find the most talented and passionate students from the Baltic States, involve top companies that were looking for high-performing employees and establish an annual meeting platform – [http://www.peaktime.org Peak Time]”. As time passed by, it started to become more and more international, and now it gathers around 1.5 thousand participants from around 70 countries around the world. The motto of Peak Time is BE THE ONE WHO SHAPES TOMORROW OF BUSINESS.

== Stages of the competition ==
[[File:New Pictured (3).png|thumb|right|Structure of Peak Time competition]]

* '''Online registration'''
Participants register as a team of four people or as an individual, when the registration for the competition is opened. After the participants have registered and sent in their applications, the preliminary online round of the competition starts.

* '''Preliminary CESIM simulation rounds''' 
The first stage is playing in a business simulation, provided by the Finnish company CESIM. In the business simulation participants have to operate a production company in a competitive market and play against other teams in the assigned group. The goal of the simulation is to gain the biggest share of the market. After the simulation round, the results are summed up, and top 100 teams and top 100 individuals are invited to the next round of the competition.

* '''Case studies and Team portfolios''' 
The next round of the competition is solving a case study. Case study is usually a challenging task - teams and individuals are provided with raw data and other relevant information about a company, market, country etc. and they have to provide both numerical and creative analysis for the given tasks. For example: how to cut on costs, without making the customer suffer from that.After the case study solutions are evaluated, 16 teams (64 people) and 16 individuals (16 people) are invited to come to the final stage which is held in Riga. If a person is invited as an individual, he or she is randomly given a team (to form 4 teams of 4 individual participants in each team) whereas those who come as teams continue to participate together.

* '''Final event''' 
The finals in Riga have three stages: the first day is CESIM simulations, where the participants once again have to play a more complex yet faster version of the CESIM simulation. The next day they are given a case study, which they once again have to solve and present this time live to jury members. After the two stages are finished, the results are summed up and the top 5 teams are selected, who will have to prove their worthiness once more - they will receive another case study which they will then have to solve and present during only a couple of hours. Afterwards, the teams are ranked once again by the same jury members, and the winners of Peak Time are finally chosen.

== Final event ==
The final event is not only about a tough competition. It's also a good time to meet new friends and acquaintances. Throughout the three days, the participants have special evening programmes: team building activities in the city, led by our student compadres, Cultural and National evenings, where the participants share something that they brought from their countries, or experience what Latvian culture has to offer. And of course a party. It is held on the day the top 5 is selected - during the party the winners are announced and leave to prepare for the next day, whereas the other finalists party SSE Riga style.

Formerly one of the largest Asian airlines, PAL was severely affected by the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]]. In one of the Philippines' biggest corporate failures, PAL was forced to downsize its international operations by completely cutting flights to [[Europe]] and [[Middle East]], cutting virtually all domestic flights except routes operated from Manila, reducing the size of its fleet, and laying off thousands of employees. The airline was placed under [[receivership]] in 1998, and gradually restored operations to many destinations. After PAL's exit from receivership in 2007, PAL embarked on a frequent revamp of management. However, PAL's vision to re-establish itself as one of Asia's premier carriers, is still the matter of greatest importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/pal-aims-to-be-a-five-star-airline-in-five-years/ |title=PAL aims to be a five star airline in five years |publisher=Manila Bulletin |accessdate=January 16, 2016 |author=Sionil, Fil C. |date=December 7, 2015 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160208105404/http://www.mb.com.ph/pal-aims-to-be-a-five-star-airline-in-five-years/ |archivedate=February 8, 2016 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Philippine Airlines operates a mixed fleet of [[Airbus]] and [[Boeing]] aircraft with [[Airbus A320]], [[Airbus A321]], [[Airbus A321neo]], [[Airbus A330]], [[Airbus A350XWB|Airbus A350]], and [[Boeing 777-300ER]].

Philippine Airlines is owned by PAL Holdings ({{Pse|PAL}}), a [[holding company]] responsible for the airline's operations. PAL Holdings is in turn part of a group of companies owned by business tycoon [[Lucio Tan]].

PAL had forecast net profit to reach $32.32 million for the fiscal year ending on March 31, 2008, $26.28 million in 2009 and $47.41 million in 2010, but this proved difficult to achieve, with a large loss announced in early 2009 causing some concern.

== Fleet ==
{{main|Philippine Airlines fleet}}
[[File:Philippine Airlines Boeing 777-300ER RP-C7776 LHR 2014-03-29.png|200px|thumb|right|RP-C7776, a 777-36N(ER) on approach to [[Heathrow Airport|London's Heathrow Airport]] in 2014.]]
The Philippine Airlines fleet composed of wide-body and narrow-body aircraft from five families (excluding PAL Express fleet): [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320]], [[Airbus A320neo family|Airbus A321neo]], [[Airbus A330]], its flagship [[Airbus A350 XWB|Airbus A350]], and [[Boeing 777]]. As of October 21, 2018, there were 67 aircraft registered in the PAL fleet.

== Brand ==

=== Logo ===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}
The Philippine Airlines logo has gone under four incarnations in the entire length of its operations.  The first logo incorporated a blue oval with "PAL" superimposed in white letters, a four-pointed star whose points intersect behind the "A" in the PAL initials, and a wing whose position varied depending on the location of the logo (the wing points to the right if located on the left side of the plane, left if on the right side). A variant of this logo used a globe instead in the blue oval with the PAL initials superimposed.  This logo would be in use from the 1950s until the mid-1960s, when it would be replaced by a second logo.

The second logo adopted a blue triangle (with the bottom point missing) and a red triangle superimposed upon it, enclosed by a circle; this was meant to evoke a vertically-displayed [[Flag of the Philippines|national flag]] (the white being formed by the negative space between the two triangles' tips). In the mid-1970s, a third logo, which removed the circle and simplified the shapes, was introduced. The typeface used in the third logo was later applied to the second logo, which remained the official PAL logo until 1986, when it would be replaced by the current logo.

The current PAL logo features the same two blue and red sailed triangles used in the second and third logos. However, an eight-rayed yellow sunburst that called the shaped [[Sail]]boat was superimposed on top of the blue triangle, and a new [[Helvetica]] typeface was used.

=== Livery ===
[[File:RP-C8785.jpg|thumb|213x213px|RP-C8785, an [[Airbus A330-343]] operated by Philippine Airlines arrives in [[Francisco Bangoy International Airport]] from [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport]] as PR1812.]]
PAL [[livery|liveries]] have undergone many incarnations.  The first PAL aircraft bore a simple white-top, silver-bottom livery separated by solid straight cheatlines, with a small Philippine flag superimposed on the tail. The name "Philippine Air Lines" was superimposed in the upper forward portion of the fuselage and the PAL logo was located at the back. Later variants of the livery, especially on PAL jet aircraft, made use of an extended Philippine flag as cheatlines, with the PAL logo superimposed on the tail.  By this time, the name "Philippine Airlines" was used in the livery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=M.Oertle |url=http://www.airliners.net/photo/Philippine-Airlines/BAC-111-518FG-One-Eleven/0451320/M/ |title='&amp;#39;PAL BAC 111-518FG One-Eleven'&amp;#39; |publisher=Airliners.net |date=February 6, 2011 |accessdate=February 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another variant of the original livery used by PAL is somewhat similar to the current livery.  However, it uses PAL's third logo on the tail with blue, white and red cheatlines running the center of the fuselage.  Later on, the bottom half of the fuselage was also painted white.

The current "Eurowhite" livery, first used with the [[Short 360]], was adopted in 1986 following PAL's corporate rebranding.  This livery, (designed by [[Landor Associates]]) has the name "Philippines" superimposed on the forward portion of the fuselage in italics (using the PAL logo typeface),  while the tail is painted with the logo and the Philippine flag is visible near the rear of the aircraft.  The PAL logo is also painted on the [[wingtip device|winglets]] of aircraft that have them. The name "Philippines", instead of "Philippine Airlines", is to denote that PAL is the primary flag carrier of the Philippines. However, this sometimes leads to confusion that a PAL plane, especially when chartered by the [[President of the Philippines|President]] for official or state visits, is in fact the [[Air transports of heads of state and government|official air transport of the Philippine head of state]]. Any PAL aircraft with the flight number '''"PR/PAL 001"''' and the callsign '''"PHILIPPINE ONE"''' is a special plane operated by Philippine Airlines to transport the President of the Philippines.

For the airline's 70th anniversary, a special decal was placed on all of its aircraft. The sticker featured a stylized "70" and the words, "Asia's first, shining through".

As the airline celebrates its 75th anniversary, a special decal was put at the back of every aircraft. The sticker features a stylized "75".

== Frequent flyer program ==
[[File:Mabuhay Miles logo.png|thumb|left| Mabuhay Miles logo]]
Mabuhay Miles is the Philippine Airlines [[frequent flyer program]].  It was established in 2002 by merging all existing PAL frequent flyer programs prior to the Asian financial crisis: namely, PALsmiles, the Mabuhay Club and the Flying Sportsman, with PALsmiles and Mabuhay Club members being moved to the new program on August 1, 2002.&lt;ref name="palsmiles"&gt;[https://www.mabuhaymiles.com/mabuhayMiles-web/common/faq.jsp Mabuhay Miles FAQ], Philippine Airlines. Retrieved April 20, 2008.  {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Flying Sportsman program was subsequently transformed into SportsPlus, a three-tiered, subscription-based program which gives extra baggage allocations for sports equipment. Mabuhay Miles members earn miles that can be redeemed at face value on most Philippine Airlines-operated flights, as well as on code-shared routes of partner airlines.

Mabuhay Miles is divided into multiple tiers:
* '''Classic''' – The basic level at which one starts earning 'miles',
* '''Elite''' – Passengers who have earned 25,000 flight miles, flown 30 one-way sectors in any class of service, or flown 15 one-way sectors in business class become an Elite member.
* '''Premiere Elite''' –  Passengers who have earned 45,000 flight miles, flown 50 one-way sectors in any class of service, or flown 25 one-way sectors in business class become a Premiere Elite member.
*'''Million Miler''' – Passengers who have flown one million (1,000,000) cumulative Tier/Flight Miles on Philippine Airlines and PAL Express become Million Milers.

Each lounge chair is equipped with a power supply, enabling passengers to charge their personal electronic devices. Wi-Fi is available in the lounging and dining areas.

On June 27, 2018, Philippine Airlines unveiled a new Mabuhay Lounge for international business class, million millers, premier elite, and elite passengers in [[Mactan–Cebu International Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sunstar.com.ph/article/1750282/Cebu/Business/Cebu-US-flights-likely-with-T2-opening|title=Cebu-US flights likely with T2 opening|last=Cacho|first=Katlene|date=2018-06-29|work=Sunstar|access-date=2018-07-07|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cabin reconfiguration project was completed in 2009&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

On 2017, PAL reconfigured the cabin layout of eight [[A330]]s, from a single class 414-seater configuration into a 309-seater tri-class, with Business, Premium Economy and Economy class sections.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ltp.com.ph/Pages/News.aspx?cid=233|title=Welcome to Lufthansa Technik Philippines|website=www.ltp.com.ph|access-date=2018-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reconfigured A330s were rolled out within a seven-month period in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.philippineairlines.com/AboutUs/newsandevents/pal-to-roll-out-tri-class-a330s|title=PAL to roll out tri-class A330s with enhanced Premium Economy|website=www.philippineairlines.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IFEs were Zodiac's RAVE system.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.philippineairlines.com/AboutUs/newsandevents/new-a330|title=PAL rolls out tri-class A330 with New Premium Economy|website=www.philippineairlines.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seats were designed by Lift Strategic Design,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://runwaygirlnetwork.com/2017/07/12/lift-designs-thoughtful-elegant-fun-cabins-for-revitalised-philippine-airlines/|title=Lift designs thoughtful, elegant cabins for revitalised Philippine Airlines - Runway Girl|date=2017-07-12|work=Runway Girl|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lufthansa Technik|Lufthansa Technik Philippines]] performed the reconfiguration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Incidents and accidents ==
{{main|List of Philippine Airlines accidents and incidents}}
Although Philippine Airlines aircraft have been involved in a string of accidents since its founding in 1941, the majority of airline accidents have occurred with propeller aircraft during the early years of operations. Few PAL jet aircraft have been involved in accidents, the most notable being the explosion onboard [[Philippine Airlines Flight 434]], masterminded by [[al-Qaeda]] and precursor to the ill-fated [[Bojinka plot|Project Bojinka]].

Despite this, PAL is known for being the only airline in the Philippines to be accredited by the [[International Air Transport Association]] with passing the [[IATA Operational Safety Audit]] (IOSA), having been accredited in February 2007.&lt;ref name="PAL IOSA-Certified"&gt;[http://www.philippineairlines.com/TEMPFILES/828.asp?funcpostinglink=267&amp;funcpostingID=1&amp;funcextensionID=3403 PAL now IOSA-Certified], Philippine Airlines Press Release, February 8, 2007  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304060350/http://www.philippineairlines.com/TEMPFILES/828.asp?funcpostinglink=267&amp;funcpostingID=1&amp;funcextensionID=3403 |date=March 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==

===Financial issues===
PAL experienced huge financial losses in the late 2000s. On March 31, 2006, PAL’s consolidated total assets amounted to 100,984,477 PHP, a 11% decrease from March 31, 2005. On March 31, 2007, the company’s consolidated assets continued to diminish by 8% with amount equivalent to 92,837,849 PHP as against to 2006 figures. The declination of PAL’s assets was primarily due to net decrease in property and equipment and advance payments to aircraft and engine manufacturers, current and other non current assets. As of March 31, 2007, other current and noncurrent assets fell by 29% to 2,960.4 million PHP and by 20% to 2,941.7 million PHP "due to the effect of re-measurement to fair value of certain financial assets and derivative instruments".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philippineairlines.com/Images/PHI-17Q-December%202007_tcm61-6305.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; After carrying 17% more passengers in 2009 due to acquisition of additional aircraft and growth in the local market, PAL annual income report showed an increase in revenues of US$1.634 billion from US$1.504 billion in 2008. In spite of this, PAL expenses escalated as a result of more flight operations and higher maintenance costs aggravated by fuel prices fluctuations; forty-four percent (44%) of PAL income operating expenditures is utilized for fuel consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cebu-philippines.net/philippine-airlines-income.html Philippine Airlines Income Forces Cost Cuts to Survive Global Recession]. Cebu-philippines.net. Retrieved on October 20, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labor issues===
PAL has a history of labor relations problems. On June 15, 1998, PAL retrenched 5,000 of its employees, including more than 1,400 flight attendants and stewards to allegedly reduce costs and alleviate financial downturn in airline industry as consequence of Asian financial crisis. Represented by Flight Attendants and Stewards Association of the Philippines (FASAP), the retrenched employees particularly the 1,400 cabin crews seek remedy for their problem through judicial process and filed a complaint on the grounds of unfair labor practice and illegal retrenchment.

It took a decade before it was finally settled. It passed the Labor Arbiter to the National Labor Relations Commission then to the Court of Appeals and, finally, to the Supreme Court. The Philippine Highest Tribunal favored the aggrieved party and on July 22, 2008, in its 32-page decision ordered PAL to  "reinstate the cabin crew personnel who were covered by the retrenchment of and demotion scheme of June 15, 1998 made effective on July 15, 1998, without loss of seniority right and other privileges, and to pay them full backwages, inclusive of allowances and other monetary benefits computed from the time of their separation up to time of actual reinstatement, provided that with respect to those who have received their respective separation pay, the amount of payments shall be deducted from their backwages." The Supreme Court further explained that there was a failure on the part of PAL to substantiate its claims of actual and imminent substantial losses. Although the Asian financial fiasco severely affected the airline, PAL defense of bankruptcy and rehabilitation are untenable; hence, the retrenchment policy is not justified.&lt;ref&gt;Fonbuena, C. (2009) [http://news.abs-cbn.com/nation/02/06/09/retrenching-workers-don%E2%80%99t-repeat-pal%E2%80%99s-mistake Retrenching workers? Don’t repeat PAL’s mistake]. news.abs-cbn.com&lt;/ref&gt;

However, on March 26, 2018, the Supreme Court en banc voted in favor of Philippine Airlines, which affirms the 2006 Court of Appeals decision that says Philippine Airlines is not required to consult FASAP for its criteria for its retrenchment program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rappler.com/nation/198050-supreme-court-retrenchment-valid-philippine-airlines-fasap|title=SC votes after 20 years: PAL wins in retrenchment case vs FASAP|work=Rappler|access-date=2018-03-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/business/03/26/18/sc-reverses-own-ruling-says-pal-employees-not-illegally-retrenched|title=SC reverses own ruling, says PAL employees not illegally retrenched|last=News|first=Ina Reformina, ABS-CBN|work=ABS-CBN News|access-date=2018-03-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competition===
For more than 20 years, PAL monopolized the air transport industry in the Philippines. This came to an end in 1995 through the passage of Executive Order No. 219 that permits entry of new airlines in the industry. The liberalization and deregulation of Philippine airline industry have brought competition in the domestic air transport industry resulting to lower airfare, improvement in the quality of service and efficiency in the industry in general. At present, three airlines are competing in international and major domestic routes: PAL, Cebu Pacific and PAL Express (formerly known as Air Philippines) and two airlines are serving minor and short-distance routes: Philippines AirAsia, Cebgo (formerly SEAIR and Tiger Airways) and other small airlines.&lt;ref&gt;Manuela Jr., W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13046">A '''polytechnic''' ({{Lang-cy|coleg polytechnig}}&lt;ref&gt;http://m.cy.caimeiprinter.com/info/polytechnic-museum-of-printing-621616.html&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[tertiary education]] teaching institution in [[England]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]] offering higher diplomas, undergraduate degree and post graduate education (masters and PhDs) that was governed and administered at the national level by the [[Council for National Academic Awards]]. At the outset the focus of Polytechnics was on [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] subjects with a special emphasis on [[engineering]].  After the passage of the [[Further and Higher Education Act 1992]] they became independent [[university|universities]] which meant they could award their own degrees. The comparable institutions in [[Scotland]] were collectively referred to as [[Central Institution]]s. Like polytechnics or technological universities ([[institute of technology]]) in other countries, their aim was to teach both purely academic and professional vocational degrees (engineering, computer science, law, architecture, management, business, accounting, journalism, town planning) etc. Their original focus was applied education for professional work and their original roots concentrated on advanced engineering and applied science ([[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] subjects), though soon after being founded they also created departments concerned with the humanities. The polytechnic legacy was to advance and excel in undergraduate and post graduate degrees in engineering and technology (STEM) education that now form a core faculty at most universities in the UK. While many former polytechnics have advanced their research focus many have stayed true to their original ethos by focusing on teaching for professional practice.

The division between universities and polytechnics was known as the [[Binary Divide]] in UK higher education.

==History==

=== 19th century ===
Some polytechnics trace their history back to the early 19th century. The [[University of Westminster|London Polytechnic]] (now the [[University of Westminster]]) emerged from the Royal Polytechnic Institution which was founded at Regent Street, London in 1838. The establishment of the polytechnic was a reaction to the rise of industrial power and technical education in France, Germany and the USA.&lt;ref&gt;Brosan, "The Development of Polytechnics in the UK", ''Paedagogica Europaea'', Vol 7, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; Degrees at the London Polytechnic were validated by the University of London. The first British institution to use the name "polytechnic" was the [[Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society]], which it still retains, together with the affectionate nickname "The Poly".

=== 1960s–1992 ===
Most polytechnics were formed in the expansion of higher education in the 1960s, [[Academic degree]]s in polytechnics were validated by the UK [[Council for National Academic Awards]] (CNAA) from 1965 to 1992. The CNAA was chartered by the British government to validate and award degrees and maintain national quality assurance standards. The CNAA subject boards from their inception were from the universities. A CNAA degree was formally recognised as equivalent to a university degree and the courses were under strict scrutiny by assessors external to the polytechnics.&lt;ref name="DAvis1979"&gt;{{cite paper|title=The council for national academic awards 1964-74: a study of a validating agency|author=Davis, Martin C.|date=1979|url=https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/dspace-jspui/bitstream/2134/7924/3/Thesis-1979-Davis.pdf|publisher=Loughborough University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sub-degree courses at these institutions were validated by the Business &amp; Technology Education Council ([[Business and Technology Education Council|BTEC]]).

Some polytechnics were often seen as ranking below universities in the provision of higher education because they lacked degree-awarding powers, concentrated on applied science and engineering education and produced less research than the universities, and because the qualifications necessary to gain a place in one were sometimes lower than for a university (the failure rate in the first year of undergraduate courses was high due to a rigorous filtering process). However, in terms of an undergraduate education this was a misconception since many polytechnics offered academic degrees validated by the CNAA from bachelor's and master's degree to PhD research degrees.&lt;ref&gt;Silver, Harold: "Higher Education in the UK: A critical examination of the Role of the CNAA", ''Higher Education Journal'', Springer Netherlands, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Also professional degrees in, for instance, engineering, town planning, law, and architecture were rigorously validated by various professional institutions. Many polytechnics argued that a CNAA degree was superior to many university degrees especially in engineering, due to the external independent validation process employed by the CNAA, the oversight of the engineering institutions, and innovations such as [[sandwich degree]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2004/apr/04/theobserver.observerbusiness4|title=Design's angel of the North|date=2004-04-03|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such innovations made a polytechnic education more relevant for professional work in applying science and advanced technology in industry.&lt;ref&gt;Brosan, "The Development of Polytechnics in the UK", ''Paedagogica Europaea'', Vol 7, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://technicaleducationmatters.org/about/|title=About|website=technicaleducationmatters.org|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In UK culture an engineering, applied science and technological education tended to be looked down upon socially. Industries and activities such as "manufacturing" and "engineering" were perceived to be things of the past, boring and "dirty". This connection to polytechnics did not help their cause in terms of achieving status in the public eye. This attitude and influence led to an expansion of the more popular subjects in the "creative" industries such as fashion, arts and design, media studies, journalism, film studies, and sports management. This social influence caused many polytechnics to change their faculty of "Engineering" to faculty of "Design and Technology"

For many years a central admissions system for polytechnics was not seen as necessary. However, a large increase in applications resulted from funding cuts to universities in the early 1980s. The [[Polytechnics Central Admissions System]] was introduced and handled the years of entry from 1986 to 1992.

===Post-1992===
Under the [[Further and Higher Education Act 1992]] they became fully fledged universities. After 1992, the former polytechnics ("[[new universities]]") awarded their own degrees. Most sub-degree BTEC qualifications have been phased out of the new universities and transferred to colleges of further education.

The polytechnics changed their names when they gained university status. Some simply dropped "polytechnic" and added "university" to their titles. For example, the Huddersfield Polytechnic became the University of Huddersfield. However, this was often not possible as there was another university with the name. One alternative title was "Metropolitan University", because the institution was situated in a city or other large [[metropolitan area]]. Examples are [[Manchester Metropolitan University]] and [[London Metropolitan University]]. These titles are often shortened to "Met" (Man Met, London Met) or an [[acronym]] (MMU, LMU). Others adopted a name which reflects the local area, such as [[Nottingham Trent University]] (named after the River Trent which flows through Nottingham) and [[Sheffield Hallam University]] ("Hallam" refers to the area of South Yorkshire in which much of Sheffield is situated). [[Ulster Polytechnic]] remains the only polytechnic to unite with a university; this occurred in 1984.

The last degree-awarding institution to hold on to the name "polytechnic" after 1992 was Anglia Polytechnic University (which had only attained polytechnic status the previous year). The word was soon identified as being off-putting to potential students, and the university became known as [[Anglia Ruskin University]] from 2005. The name "polytechnic" ([[École Polytechnique]]) in continental Europe and the USA ([[MIT]]) are viewed and styled as globally elite universities specializing in STEM education where science, engineering and engineers are premier forward looking strategic professions.  This is in stark contrast to the culture and social identity of engineers in the UK.

==List of former polytechnics==
At their peak there were over thirty polytechnics in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the English ones being primarily located in urban areas large enough to support industry or commerce, from which they usually took the city name. 
These are now universities.

In England, there are:
*[[Anglia Ruskin University]], formerly Anglia Polytechnic (located in Cambridge and Chelmsford)
*[[Birmingham City University]], formerly [[Birmingham Polytechnic]]
*[[University of Brighton]], formerly Brighton Polytechnic
*[[Bournemouth University]], formerly Bournemouth Polytechnic
*[[University of Central Lancashire]], formerly Lancashire Polytechnic and before that Preston Polytechnic (until 1984)
*[[Coventry University]], formerly Coventry Polytechnic and Lanchester Polytechnic (until 1987)
*[[De Montfort University]] Leicester, formerly Leicester Polytechnic
*[[University of East London]], formerly North East London Polytechnic and Polytechnic of East London
*[[University of Greenwich]], formerly Woolwich Polytechnic (later Thames Polytechnic)
*[[University of Hertfordshire]], formerly Hatfield Polytechnic
*[[University of Huddersfield]], formerly Huddersfield Polytechnic
*[[Kingston University]], formerly Kingston Polytechnic
*[[Leeds Beckett University]], formerly Leeds Polytechnic and as Leeds Metropolitan University from 1998 to 2013
*[[University of Lincoln|Lincoln University]] was formed in part from Humberside Polytechnic which was briefly Humberside University
*[[Liverpool John Moores University]], formerly Liverpool Polytechnic
*[[London Metropolitan University]], formerly [[London Guildhall University|City of London Polytechnic]] and [[University of North London|Polytechnic of North London]]
*[[Manchester Metropolitan University]], formerly Manchester Polytechnic
*[[Middlesex University]], formerly Middlesex Polytechnic
*[[University of Northumbria at Newcastle]], formerly Newcastle Polytechnic
*[[Nottingham Trent University]], formerly Trent Polytechnic (later Nottingham Polytechnic)
*[[Oxford Brookes University]], formerly Oxford Polytechnic
*[[University of Plymouth]], Plymouth Polytechnic (until 1989), then Polytechnic South West
*[[University of Portsmouth]], formerly Portsmouth Polytechnic
*[[Sheffield Hallam University]], formerly Sheffield Polytechnic
*[[South Bank University]], formerly South Bank Polytechnic (in London)
*[[Staffordshire University]], formerly Staffordshire Polytechnic
*[[University of Sunderland]], formerly Sunderland Polytechnic
*[[Teesside University]], formerly Teesside Polytechnic
*[[University of the West of England]], formerly Bristol Polytechnic
*[[University of West London]], formerly Polytechnic of West London
*[[University of Westminster]], formerly Polytechnic of Central London and the Royal Polytechnic Institution – Regent Street
*[[University of Wolverhampton]], formerly Wolverhampton Polytechnic


In addition, Wales has
*[[University of South Wales]], formerly Polytechnic of Wales and University of Glamorgan 

and Northern Ireland has:
*[[New University of Ulster]] which was a [[plate glass university]]. It absorbed the former Ulster Polytechnic, afterwards it was known as the University of Ulster. It is now known as [[Ulster University]]

In Scotland there were comparable Higher Education institutions called [[Central Institution]]s but these very rarely used the designation "Polytechnic" in their titles; these also converted into universities.
* One institution that did briefly use the designation "Polytechnic" was [[Edinburgh Napier University]]. Between 1988 and 1992 the institution was known as Napier Polytechnic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Edinburgh Napier University|title=About Edinburgh Napier University|url=http://www.napier.ac.uk/aboutus/foi/Pages/AboutEdinburghNapierUniversity.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728015527/http://www.napier.ac.uk/aboutus/foi/Pages/AboutEdinburghNapierUniversity.aspx|dead-url=yes|archive-date=28 July 2011|accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1706">'''Raymond Pelgrims de Bigard''' (2 April 1875 to 14 May 1955) was a Belgian industrialist, famous for the conservation and restoration of historic castles.&lt;ref&gt;https://inventaris.onroerenderfgoed.be/dibe/persoon/6616&lt;/ref&gt;

De Bigard became wealthy at the beginning of the 20th century. During the First World War, however, his activities were destroyed. He gained national fame in rescuing multiple important residences with his private fortune, personally owning multiple castles. In 1903 he bought Bijgaerden Castle, former residence of the [[Lord of Saventhem and Sterrebeke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tuinencyclopedie.be/pages/detail.asp?Id=4393 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323102657/http://tuinencyclopedie.be/pages/detail.asp?Id=4393 |archivedate=2016-03-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He restored the castle long before it became a protected monument in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.be/books?id=rKjn0nQrkzcC&amp;pg=PA338&amp;lpg=PA338&amp;dq=Raymond+Pelgrims+de+Bigard&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ml1NIHvvFH&amp;sig=E5M3-0tjZ3Gf6wVf60oXb2UPnOs&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwix_JW5v6_VAhWRKlAKHaiVAI0Q6AEIhgEwFQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Raymond%20Pelgrims%20de%20Bigard&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides [[Groot-Bijgaarden Castle]], he saved [[Beersel Castle]].

In 1934 he founded ''Les Demeures Historiques de Belgique''.&lt;ref&gt;http://anet.ua.ac.be/submit.phtml?UDses=67305290%3A775771&amp;UDstate=1&amp;UDmode=&amp;UDaccess=&amp;UDrou=%25Start:bopwexe&amp;UDopac=isaarua&amp;UDextra=au::107618&lt;/ref&gt;
For his efforts he received royal gratitude.

His son, [[Eugeen-Willy Pelgrims de Bigard]], inherited his castles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3466">'''Rules of origin''' are used to determine the [[country of origin]] of a product for purposes of [[international trade]].  There are two common types of rules of origin depending upon application, the preferential and non-preferential rules of origin (19 CFR 102).   The exact rules vary from country to country, from agreement to agreement.

== Non-preferential ==
Non-preferential rules of origin are used to determine the country of origin for certain purposes.
These purposes ''may'' be for quotas, anti-dumping, anti-circumvention, statistics or origin labelling.

The basis for the non-preferential rules originates from the Kyoto convention&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unece.org/trade/kyoto/ky-d1-e0.htm|title=Trade Programme – Trade – UNECE|website=www.unece.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; which states that if a product is wholly obtained or produced completely within one country the product shall be deemed having origin in that country. For a product which has been produced in more than one country the product shall be determined to have origin in the country where the '''last substantial transformation''' took place.

To determine exactly what was the last substantial transformation, three general rules are applied:
# Change of tariff classification (on any level, though 4-digit level is the most common)
# Value added-rule ([[ad valorem]])
# Special processing rule, the minimum transformation is described. For instance, in the EU non-preferential rules of origin for T-shirts (HS6109), the origin is supposed to be in the country where the ''complete making-up'' was done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/Result.do?direct=yes&amp;lang=en&amp;consleg=01993R2454|title=EUR-Lex – Simple search&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the non-preferential rules a product always has exactly one country of origin.  However, the non-preferential rules may differ from country to country; the same product may have different origins depending on which country's scheme is applied. Usually it is the rules of the country into which a product is being imported that apply.

== Preferential ==
Preferential RoO are part of a [[free trade area]] or preferential trade arrangement which includes tariff concessions. These trade arrangements might be unilateral, bilateral or regional (also sometimes called multilateral) trade arrangements. The rules of origin determine what products can benefit from the tariff concession or preference, in order to avoid [[transshipment]].

[[File:Team Valley Retail World.jpg|thumb|Team Valley Retail World]]
'''Team Valley''' is a traditionally heavily industrial area of [[Gateshead]] in [[Tyne and Wear]], [[England]]. More recently it has become home to the 'Retail World' [[retail park]], which makes up just a small percentage of the entirety of the Team Valley Trading Estate. Many large international companies are based in the area's trading estate and it is rapidly developing as a [[business park]] rather than the heavily industrialised area it used to be. There are currently approximately 700 companies on the estate, and each day approximately 20,000 people travel to Team Valley.&lt;ref name=hist&gt;[http://www.team-valley.com/downloads/history-of-team-valley.pdf History of Team Valley]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The residential area known as '''the Teams''' is adjacent to [[Dunston, Tyne and Wear|Dunston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Gateshead Council|url=http://www.gateshead.gov.uk/Building%20and%20Development/LiveGatesheadLoveGateshead/Greatplacestolive/Teams.aspx|title=Dunston and Teams|accessdate=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In the 1930s the Government decided to spend nearly £2m on this part of [[Gateshead]] establishing the Team Valley Trading Estate as a well-planned industrial environment. The [[architect]] in charge was [[William Holford]] with [[Hugh Beaver]] as chief engineer.&lt;ref&gt;Mervyn Miller, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31245|''Holford, William Graham, Baron Holford (1907-1975)''], Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press 2004; accessed 20 Jan 2012&lt;/ref&gt; It included a central headquarters, now used by [[English Partnerships]], a bank, a post office and, some modestly scaled industrial buildings as well as some smaller industrial units for start-up ventures.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;

These facilities were laid out along a wide central artery, known as 'Kingsway', almost two miles long. Work on the estate began in May 1936 and the first factory opened in October that year.&lt;ref name=bbc2011&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-13445649|title=Team Valley Trading Estate in Gateshead toasts 75 years|publisher=BBC|date=19 May 2011|accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction, which was undertaken by [[George Wimpey|Wimpey Construction]], took several years and was completed in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;White, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the older residents of Gateshead were involved in the building of the original team valley.  The estate was officially opened by King George VI on 22 February 1939.&lt;ref name=bbc2011/&gt;

The southern end used to be the location of the National Coal Board's regional headquarters&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/46376/pages/9215/page.pdf London Gazette]&lt;/ref&gt; but after the closure of the mines in the area this was replaced by a [[Safeway (UK)|Safeway]] supermarket which is now owned by [[Sainsbury's]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usdaw.org.uk/newsevents/news/2004/may/usdawstatementonsainsburys.aspx Usdaw statement on Sainsburys acquiring 13 Safeway stores and one Morrisons] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120915100728/http://www.usdaw.org.uk/newsevents/news/2004/may/usdawstatementonsainsburys.aspx |date=2012-09-15 }} USDAW, 14 May 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[River Team]] runs directly through the centre of the trading estate, hidden in a culvert.&lt;ref&gt;[http://217.205.94.37/pdf/ne-casestudies-riverteamcorridor.pdf/$FILE/ne-casestudies-riverteamcorridor.pdf River Team Corridor]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport==
Although the Team Valley Trading Estate predates the road by several decades, it is now bordered on the West by the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1 road]], and has two junctions at both the north and south ends. A dual carriageway runs the length of the trading estate between the two [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]] road junctions.  The worsening congestion and the lack of scope for improving the A1 has led to the [[Highways Agency]] using the provisions of Article 14 of the Town and Country Planning (General Development Procedure) Order 1995 to restrict additional development taking place on Team Valley.  The North East Chamber of Commerce and two local newspapers (''[[The Journal (newspaper)|The Journal]]'' and ''[[Evening Chronicle]]'') have launched a campaign against these restrictions, entitled "Go for Jobs".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journallive.co.uk/north-east-news/newcastle-campaigns/jobs-north-east/ Go for Jobs]&lt;/ref&gt;

To the East it is bordered by the [[East Coast Main Line]] which is the main railway between [[London]] and [[Edinburgh]] via Newcastle. Until 1952, the Trading Estate was served by [[Low Fell railway station]].&lt;ref name=Butt&gt;{{cite book |last=Butt |first=R.V.J. |title=The Directory of Railway Stations |year=1995 |publisher=Patrick Stephens Ltd |location=Yeovil |isbn=1-85260-508-1 |id=R508 |page=150 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; The nearest heavy rail station is in [[Newcastle railway station|Newcastle]], while the [[Tyne and Wear Metro]] is accessible at [[Gateshead Interchange]].&lt;ref name=metro&gt;[http://www.picturesofgateshead.co.uk/interchange/index.html Gateshead Bus &amp; Metro Interchange]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bus services are provided by [[Go North East]] with most operating to and from Gateshead Interchange.&lt;ref name=metro/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10046">'''Tenant screening''' is a process used primarily by residential [[landlord]]s and property managers to evaluate prospective tenants.  The purpose is to assess the likelihood the tenant will fulfill the terms of the [[Lease|lease or rental agreement]] and will also take great care of the rental property in question.  The process culminates in a decision as to whether to approve the applicant, approve the applicant conditionally (such as requiring an increased deposit or [[Co-signing|cosigner]]) or deny tenancy.

==Tenant screening process==
The tenant screening process typically begins when the prospective tenant (each adult applicant) completes a rental application, pays an application fee and perhaps a holding deposit.

Rental applications are designed to collect [[personally identifying information]] (name, social security number and date of birth, etc.), address, employment, criminal and eviction history.  A signature is generally required, attesting to the accuracy of information provided, agreeing to certain terms and conditions and authorizing procurement of a tenant screening report.

Valid government issued photo identification is typically required to confirm the identity of applicants and in compliance with the [[Federal Trade Commission]]'s (FTC's) identity theft [[Red Flags Rule]].

Most landlords rely on a tenant screening company to produce a tenant screening report - to compile relevant credit, [[public records]] and other information needed to adequately vet prospective tenants.  Information gleaned from the application, tenant screening report and the landlord's own research is used to arrive at a decision based on landlord's rental criteria.

Applicant initiated tenant screening services are beginning to emerge. Under this model, applicants order reports on themselves and grant access to prospective landlords.

==Tenant screening companies==
Tenant screening services are specialized consumer reporting agencies (CRAs) or investigative consumer reporting agencies as defined and regulated by the [[Fair Credit Reporting Act]] (FCRA), [http://www.ftc.gov/os/statutes/031224fcra.pdf 15 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq].

CRAs have many obligations under the FCRA.  Notably,they must establish the identity of each end-user (landlord) and the purpose for which the information is sought - before providing a tenant screening report.  
::*They must "follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates".
::*"Upon request, and subject to section 610(a)(1)of the FCRA (§ 1681h), clearly and accurately disclose to the consumer "all information in the consumer's file at the time of the request."  Failure to do so can result in strong regulatory action.  See http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2010/02/saferent.shtm.
::*Additional CRA compliance procedures are outlined in Section 607 of the FCRA (15 U.S.C. § 1681e).

==Tenant screening reports==
Tenant screening reports contain one or more of the following elements:
::*Consumer [[Credit history|credit report]] (with or without a score) - from one of the three national credit bureaus (Experian, Equifax or Transunion).
::*[[Eviction]] records search
::*[[Criminal record]]s search
::*[[Sex offender registry]] search
::*Specially designated nationals search (frequently referred to as an OFAC search)
::*Rental references
::*Employment verifications
::*Recommendation - based on the landlord's criteria (parameters)

[[Credit history|Credit reports]] and database searches are often returned instantly via [[Transport Layer Security|secure web sites]].  Additional information resulting from more in-depth public records searches, rental references and employment verifications can take anywhere from a few hours to a few days.

==Landlord responsibilities==

Landlords are Users of Consumer Reports, also as defined and regulated by the FCRA.  The FCRA imposes specific requirements on landlords as Users.  Notably, they must "…provide oral, written, or electronic notice of adverse action taken based in whole or in part on any information contained in a consumer (tenant screening] report.  Adverse action is a determination that is adverse to the interest of the consumer.  Certainly denial of tenancy is an adverse action.  But so too is attaching additional terms, such as requiring an additional deposit or co-signer.  The notification must include:
::*The name, address and telephone number of the consumer reporting agency (tenant screening company] that furnished the report; and
::*The consumer's right to a free copy of the tenant screening report; and
::*The consumer's right to dispute the accuracy and completeness of the report.

The [[Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] (Dodd-Frank) amended Section 615 of the FCRA to add a new requirement that a person (landlord) taking Adverse Action…  “provide to the consumer written or electronic disclosure (A) of a numerical [[credit score]] as defined in section 609(f)(2)(A) [of the FCRA] used by such person in taking any Adverse Action based in whole or in part on any information in a consumer report; and (B) of the information set forth in subparagraphs (B) through (E) of section 609(f)(1),” including:
::*Numerical Score
::*Score Range
::*Score Factors
::*Score Date
::*Score Source

==Tenant screening and the law==

There is a substantial body of law regulating consumer reporting.  The FCRA, 15 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq. as amended by the [[Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act]] of 2003 (FACTA) and more recently by Dodd-Frank is the primary body of law regulating consumer reporting.  Many states have laws regulating consumer reporting as well.  Section 625 of the FCRA (15 U.S.C. § 1681t) addresses the Relation (of the FCRA) to State laws by stating that "…this title does not annul, alter, affect, or exempt any person subject to the provisions of this title from complying with the laws of any State with respect to collection, distribution, or use of any information on consumer, …except to the extent that those laws are inconsistent with any provision of this title…".  Federal law is said to pre-empt state law to the extent of any inconsistencies.

Dodd-Frank transferred regulatory authority over consumer reporting (and therefore tenant screening companies) from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to the new [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]] in 2011.

Federal&lt;ref name="Federal Fair Housing Laws"&gt;[http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/FHLaws], Fair Housing Laws and Presidential Orders.&lt;/ref&gt; and state&lt;ref name="Washington Fair Housing Law"&gt;[http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=49.60.222], Example: state fair housing law.&lt;/ref&gt; fair housing and residential landlord-tenant law impact the tenant screening process in several ways.  It is, in a nutshell, a violation of fair housing law to treat protected individuals differently in the tenant screening process. Fair housing law at the federal level is found in Title VIII of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1968]]. Residential landlord-tenant law often limits what landlords may charge for tenant screening to the actual costs in obtaining the background information, not to exceed the customary costs charged by a screening service in the general area.

==Legal and legislative trends==

Fair housing advocates have long argued for application of the [[Disparate Impact|disparate impact]] legal theory (historically applied to employment practices) to Title VIII ([[Fair Housing Act]]) claims.&lt;ref name="NHLP Disparate Impact Lawsuit Guide"&gt;[http://nhlp.org/files/PRRAC%20Disparate%20Impact%201-2011.pdf], National Housing Law Project (NHLP) Lawsuit Guide.&lt;/ref&gt;  They argue, for example, that people of certain races and ethnicities are disproportionately represented in the criminal justice system, that use of criminal records data for tenant screening purposes has a disparate impact on those individuals and is therefore discriminatory.

The debate was largely settled in 2015 when in the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs(The Department) v. The Inclusive Communities Project, Inc.(ICP), the Supreme Court of the United States affirmed that a facially neutral business practice that has a disparate impact on a protected class can form the basis of a Fair Housing Act claim. The decision was in part based upon the Housing &amp; Urban Development (HUD) regulation interpreting the Fair Housing Act's Discriminatory Effects Standard - including its burden-shifting framework for adjudicating such claims.&lt;ref name="Supreme Court, Fair Housing and Disparate Impact Discrimination"&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-1371_8m58.pdf], Supreme Court and Fair Housing.&lt;/ref&gt;

Landlords have a right and obligation &lt;ref name="Charlotte Housing Authority Settlement"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://charlotte.news14.com/content/headlines/621791/jury-finds-housing-authority-negligent-in-woman-s-death |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514061952/http://charlotte.news14.com/content/headlines/621791/jury-finds-housing-authority-negligent-in-woman-s-death |archivedate=2012-05-14 |df= }}, Charlotte Housing Authority Settlement.&lt;/ref&gt; to take reasonable steps to protect themselves, their residents and neighbors from prospective residents with a history of violent felonies (for example). Landlords can take steps to reduce their exposure to disparate impact claims by limiting consideration to criminal convictions (versus arrests), to offenses that are relevant to the tenancy, and that occur within a reasonable period of time.

Note section 605 of the FCRA prohibits CRA's from reporting records of arrest which from the date of final disposition antedate the report by more than seven years.  Some states similarly limit reporting of criminal convictions - while there is no such limit in the FCRA.

Theranos claimed its technology was revolutionary and that its tests required only about 1/100 to 1/1,000 of the amount of blood that would ordinarily be needed and cost far less than existing tests.

A turning point came in October 2015, when investigative reporter [[John Carreyrou]] of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' questioned the validity of Theranos' technology. Since then, the company has faced a string of legal and commercial challenges from medical authorities, investors, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC), [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS), state attorneys general, former business partners, patients, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ableson|first1=Reed|title=Theranos Under Federal Criminal Investigation, Adding to Its Woes|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/19/business/theranos-sec-justice-department-investigation.html|accessdate=18 April 2018|work=New York Times|date=April 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By June 2016, it was estimated that Holmes' personal net worth had dropped from $4.5 billion to virtually nothing.&lt;ref name="Forbes_nothing" /&gt; The company was near [[bankruptcy]] until it received a $100 million investment from [[Fortress Investment Group]] in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/blood-testing-firm-theranos-gets-100-million-lifeline-from-fortress-1514057523|title=Blood-Testing Firm Theranos Gets $100 Million Lifeline From Fortress|last1=Carreyrou|first1=John|date=24 December 2017|work=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=14 March 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2018, the company was again close to going bankrupt.

In July 2016, Theranos received sanctions from the CMS, including the revocation of its [[Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments|CLIA]] certificate and prohibition of Holmes and other company officials from owning or operating a lab for two years.&lt;ref name=carreyrou&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-regulator-bans-theranos-ceo-elizabeth-holmes-from-operating-labs-for-two-years-1467956064 |title=Theranos Dealt Sharp Blow as Elizabeth Holmes Is Banned From Operating Labs|last=Carreyrou|first=John|date=2016-07-08 |last2=Siconolfi|first2=Michael|newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]]|issn=0099-9660|last3=Weaver|first3=Christopher|access-date=2016-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theranos announced it would close its laboratory operations and wellness centers to work on miniature medical testing machines.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news |title=Theranos to Close Labs and Lay Off 340 Workers|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/06/business/theranos-to-close-labs-and-lay-off-340-workers.html|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2017, Theranos said it had reached a settlement agreement with CMS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.theranos.com/2017/04/17/theranos-reaches-resolution-centers-medicare-medicaid-services/|title=Theranos Reaches Resolution with Centers For Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services |publisher=Theranos Newsroom|date=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the CMS sanctions, the [[Walgreens]] pharmacy chain terminated its contract with Theranos and filed a lawsuit claiming continuous [[Breach of contract|breaches of contract]]. The suit was [[settled out of court]], with Theranos compensating Walgreens for a much smaller amount than the claimed $140 million, reported at about $30 million.

On March 14, 2018, Theranos, Holmes, and former company president [[Ramesh Balwani|Ramesh "Sunny" Balwani]] were charged with "massive [[fraud]]" by the SEC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2018/03/14/theranos-founder-elizabeth-holmes-charged-massive-fraud/424670002/|title=Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes charged with 'massive fraud'|publisher=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; One section of the complaint says Holmes falsely claimed in 2014 that the company had annual revenues of $100 million, a thousand times more than the actual figure of $100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/14/theranos-president-exaggerated-revenue-by-1000x-says-sec.html|title=Theranos president exaggerated the company's revenue by 1,000x to investors, says SEC|last=Aiello|first=Chloe|date=2018-03-14|work=CNBC|access-date=2018-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theranos and Holmes agreed to resolve the charges against them, with Holmes paying a fine of $500,000, returning the remaining 18.9 million shares that she held, relinquishing her control of the company, and being barred from being an officer or director of any [[public company]] for ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/14/health/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-fraud.html|title=Elizabeth Holmes, Theranos C.E.O. and Silicon Valley Star, Accused of Fraud|last1=Thomas|first1=Katie|date=14 March 2018|work=New York Times|accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2018/03/14/theranos-founder-elizabeth-holmes-charged-massive-fraud/424670002/|title=Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes charged with 'massive fraud'|work=USA Today|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the agreement, if Theranos were acquired or otherwise [[liquidation|liquidated]], Holmes would not profit from her ownership until more than $750 million was returned to investors and other preferred shareholders.

==History==

While at [[Stanford University]], Elizabeth Holmes had an idea to develop a wearable patch that could adjust the dosage of drug delivery and notify doctors of variables in patients' blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inc.com/magazine/201510/kimberly-weisul/the-longest-game.html|title=How Playing the Long Game Made Elizabeth Holmes a Billionaire|work=[[Inc. (magazine)|Inc.]]|date=October 2015|access-date=3 September 2016|author=Weisul, Kimberly}}&lt;/ref&gt; She started developing [[lab-on-a-chip]] technology for blood tests, and had the idea for a company that would make testing cheaper, more convenient and accessible to consumers.&lt;ref name=never&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/print-edition/2013/08/30/theranos-the-biggest-biotech-youve.html|title=Theranos: The biggest biotech you've never heard of|last=Leuty|first=Ron|date=30 August 2013|work=San Francisco Business Times|accessdate=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holmes dropped out of Stanford and used the education trust from her parents to found the company that would later be called Theranos, derived from a combination of the words "therapy" and "diagnosis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/02/elizabeth-holmes-theranos/|title=This Woman Invented a Way to Run 30 Lab Tests on Only One Drop of Blood|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=18 February 2014|access-date=27 September 2016|author=Roper, Caitlin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pharmacytimes.com/contributor/beth-bolt-rph/2014/11/bringing-painless-blood-testing-to-the-pharmacy|title=Bringing Painless Blood Testing to the Pharmacy|work=[[Pharmacy Times]]|date=14 November 2014|access-date=27 September 2016|author=Bolt, Beth}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's original name was '''Real-Time Cures''',&lt;ref name="parloff" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/the-history-of-silicon-valley-unicorn-theranos-and-ceo-elizabeth-holmes-2018-5|title=The rise and fall of Theranos, the blood-testing startup that went from a rising star in Silicon Valley to facing fraud charges over a wild 15-year span|work=[[Business Insider]]|date=May 25, 2018|access-date=June 11, 2018|author1=Hu, Charlotte|author2=Ramsey, Lydia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/05/everything-need-know-theranos-saga-far/|title=Everything You Need to Know About the Theranos Saga So Far|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=May 4, 2016|access-date=June 11, 2018|author=Stockton, Nick}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Holmes changed after deciding that too many people were dubious about the word "cure".&lt;ref name="parloff" /&gt;

===Partnerships===
In September 2013, Theranos partnered with Walgreens to offer in-store blood tests at more than 40 locations. Walgreens announced plans to expand the "wellness centers" across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/11/18/walgreens-blood-tests/|title=Walgreens to offer affordable and needle-free blood tests in more stores (updated)|work=[[Business Insider]]|date=18 November 2014|access-date=4 September 2016|author=Moon, Mariella}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theranos blood tests were used on drug trial patients of [[GlaxoSmithKline]] and [[Pfizer]]. Each company stated that there were no ongoing active projects with Theranos in October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21656196-theranos-ambitious-silicon-valley-firm-wants-shake-up-market-medical|title=Young blood|work=[[The Economist]]|date=27 June 2015|access-date=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Duhaime-Ross"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Theranos didn't work with the huge drug company it supposedly made money from, drug company says|last=Duhaime-Ross|first=Arielle|date=2015-10-26|url = https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/26/9618390/Theranos-glaxosmithkline-denies-partnership-pfizer-blood-test|website = The Verge|accessdate = 2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016, Walgreen Co. filed suit against Theranos in a federal court in Delaware, for breach of contract.

===Exposure and downfall===
In October 2015, [[John Carreyrou]] of the ''The Wall Street Journal'' reported that Theranos was using traditional blood testing machines to run its tests instead of the company's Edison devices, and that the company's Edison machines might provide inaccurate results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/09/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-exclusive|title=Exclusive: How Elizabeth Holmes's House of Cards Came Tumbling Down|last=Bilton|first=Nick|work=The Hive|access-date=2017-04-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Hot Startup Theranos Has Struggled With Its Blood-Test Technology|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901|newspaper = Wall Street Journal|access-date = 2015-10-29|issn = 0099-9660|first = John|last = Carreyrou}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theranos claimed that the allegations were "factually and scientifically erroneous and grounded in baseless assertions by inexperienced and disgruntled former employees and industry incumbents".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Report Claims Theranos Struggling With Blood Test Tech|url = http://fortune.com/2015/10/15/theranos-blood-tests-wsj/|website = Fortune|accessdate = 2015-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recode.net/2015/10/22/theranos-attacks-wall-street-journal-again-in-a-rebuttal-youll-need-a-medical-degree-to-understand/|title=Theranos Attacks Wall Street Journal (Again) in a Rebuttal You'll Need a Medical Degree to Understand|author=Dawn Chmielewski|work=[[Re/code]]|accessdate=26 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walgreens suspended plans to expand blood-testing centers in their stores following the report.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Walgreens halts expansion of Theranos centers | work = Fortune Magazine | date = 24 October 2015 | accessdate = 2015-10-25 | url=http://fortune.com/2015/10/24/walgreens-theranos/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/21/in-defense-of-theranos/ | title=In Defense Of Theranos | publisher=TechCrunch | date=21 November 2015 | accessdate=23 October 2016 | author=Rosenbloom, Micah}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the Cleveland Clinic announced that it would work to verify Theranos technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/30/well-work-to-verify-theranos-technology-cleveland-clinic-ceo.html | title=We'll test Theranos tech: Cleveland Clinic CEO | publisher=CNBC | date=30 October 2015 | accessdate=23 October 2016 | author=DiChristopher, Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theranos fought back against the ''Journal''&lt;nowiki&gt;'s&lt;/nowiki&gt; investigation, sending lawyers after sources in the story in an effort to stop them from providing information to the press.&lt;ref name="BadBlood" /?  Tyler Shultz was a key source for the WSJ story.  Schultz was a Theranos employee from 2013 to 14 and the grandson of one-time Theranos director [[George P. Shultz]]. Tyler Shultz had attempted to bring concerns about the company's activities to his management, and when that had failed, he had spoken to Carreyrou and also, under an alias, reported the company the New York State Department of Health.&lt;ref name=WSJ1116&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-whistleblower-shook-the-companyand-his-family-1479335963|title=Theranos Whistleblower Shook the Company{{snd}}And His Family| last=Carreyrou| first=John| date=2016-11-17| work=[[Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the WSJ story, the history of FDA interactions with Theranos were scrutinized.  The FDA had received a formal inquiry to look at Theranos blood test devices by the U.S. Department of Defense in 2012 before the devices were commercially available and did not require FDA approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/12/02/internal-emails-reveal-concerns-about-theranoss-fda-compliance-date-back-years/?tid=pm_business_pop_b|title=E-mails reveal concerns about Theranos's FDA compliance date back years|first = Carolyn Y.|last = Johnson|date=2 December 2015|work=[[Washington Post]]|accessdate=26 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; FDA inspection reports from 2014 and 2015 stated that its containers for blood collection were "not validated under actual or simulated use conditions" and "were not reviewed and not approved by designated individual(s) prior to issuance".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = The FDA's notes from its visit to Theranos' labs don't look good  | work = Business Insider | date = 27 October 2015 | accessdate = 2015-10-27 | url=http://www.businessinsider.com/fda-documents-on-theranos-2015-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FDA inspection in 2015 resulted in multiple [[Form_FDA_483|483]]'s from the FDA where inspectors observed violations of [[Title_21_of_the_Code_of_Federal_Regulations|FDA Title 21 Regulations]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OfficeofGlobalRegulatoryOperationsandPolicy/ORA/ORAElectronicReadingRoom/UCM469396.pdf | title = FDA-483 | date = 16 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OfficeofGlobalRegulatoryOperationsandPolicy/ORA/ORAElectronicReadingRoom/UCM469395.pdf |title = FDA-483 | date = 16 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the inspection, Theranos announced that it would voluntarily suspend its tests apart from the FDA-approved herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.techtimes.com/articles/98407/20151022/blood-testing-start-up-theranos-is-in-pause-period-says-ceo-elizabeth-holmes.htm | title=Blood-Testing Start-Up Theranos Is In 'Pause Period', Says CEO Elizabeth Holmes | publisher=Tech Times | date=22 October 2015 | accessdate=23 October 2016 | author=Derla, Katherine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Arizona Department of Health Services]] reported issues with the company's Scottsdale lab meeting regulations in October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Theranos suspends micro blood tests to allow FDA review | work = AZ Central| date = October 25, 2015 | accessdate = 2015-10-26 | url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/arizona/investigations/2015/10/25/theranos-suspends-micro-blood-tests-allow-fda-review/74355082/}}{{dead link|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In January 2016, the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS) sent a letter to Theranos based on an inspection of its Newark, California, lab in the Fall of 2015, reporting that the facility did not "comply with certificate requirements and performance standards" and caused an "immediate jeopardy to patient health and safety" due to a test to determine the correct dose of the blood-thinning drug [[warfarin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = US government says Theranos lab poses 'immediate jeopardy to patient safety'|url = https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/27/10853340/government-says-theranos-lab-poses-immediate-threat-to-public-safety|website = The Verge|access-date = 2016-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Walgreens and Capital BlueCross announced a suspension of Theranos blood tests from the Newark lab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.businessinsider.com/capital-bluecross-and-theranos-2016-1 | title=Another partner just asked Theranos to stop running blood tests | publisher=Business Insider | date=29 January 2016 | accessdate=23 October 2016 | author=Ramsey, Lydia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, Theranos announced that it had voided two years of results from its Edison device.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-voids-two-years-of-edison-blood-test-results-1463616976|title=Theranos Voids Two Years of Edison Blood-Test Results|last=Carreyrou|first=John|date=2016-05-19|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=2016-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company announced that about 1&amp;nbsp;percent of test results had been voided or corrected from its proprietary machines in June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-03/theranos-says-only-1-of-results-affected-some-doubt-tests|title=Theranos Says Only 1% of Results Affected; Some Doubt Tests|author1=Caroline Chen|author2=Rebecca Spalding|date=June 3, 2016|accessdate=June 29, 2016|website=Bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, Theranos announced that the CMS had revoked its CLIA certificate and issued sanctions prohibiting its owners and operators from owning or operating a lab for two years, suspension of approval to receive Medicare and Medicaid payments, and a civil monetary penalty. The company discontinued testing at its Newark location while attempting to resolve the issues.&lt;ref name=carreyrou/&gt; Theranos announced plans to appeal the decision by regulators to revoke its license to operate a lab in California and other sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-to-appeal-regulatory-sanctions-1472192782 "Theranos to Appeal Regulatory Sanctions"] ''Wall Street Journal'', Retrieved 26 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, lawyers for Partner Investments LP and two other funds, with combined stakes totaling more than $96 million in Theranos preferred shares, charged that Theranos had threatened to seek [[Chapter 11 Bankruptcy|bankruptcy protection]] if the investors did not agree to accept additional stock equity in lieu of litigation.

In March 2018 the US Securities and Exchange Commission charged Theranos, its CEO Elizabeth Holmes and former president Ramesh "Sunny" Balwani, claiming they had engaged in an "elaborate, years-long fraud" wherein they "deceived investors into believing that its key product&amp;nbsp;– a portable blood analyzer&amp;nbsp;– could conduct comprehensive blood tests from finger drops of blood."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/03/14/theranos-chief-executive-elizabeth-holmes-charged-with-massive-fraud/|title=Theranos chief executive Elizabeth Holmes charged with massive fraud|first=Carolyn Y.|last=Johnson|date=14 March 2018|publisher=|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2018/comp-pr2018-41-theranos-holmes.pdf|title=Securities and Exchange Commission, vs. Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos, Inc., Complaint |website=sec.gov|publisher=SEC|accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holmes reached a settlement with the SEC, which requires her to pay $500,000, forfeit 19 million shares of company stock, and be barred from having a leadership position in any public company for ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Robinson|first1=Matt|title=Theranos and CEO Elizabeth Holmes Accused of Fraud by SEC|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-14/theranos-ceo-holmes-accused-of-fraud-by-sec-jeraxw6a|accessdate=14 March 2018|work=Bloomberg News|date=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balwani did not settle with the SEC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Balakrishnan|first1=Anita|title=Theranos CEO Holmes and former president Balwani charged with massive fraud|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/14/theranos-ceo-holmes-and-former-president-balwani-charged-with-massive-fraud.html|accessdate=14 March 2018|work=CNBC|date=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shutdown ===
On September 4, 2018, Theranos announced in an email to investors that it would cease operations and release its assets and remaining cash to creditors after all efforts to find a buyer came to nothing. Most of the company's remaining employees were laid off on the previous Friday, August 31. However, CEO David Taylor and a few support staffers remained on payroll for a few more days.&lt;ref name="TheranosShutdown"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/blood-testing-firm-theranos-to-dissolve-1536115130|last1=Carreyrou|first1=John|title=Blood-Testing Firm Theranos to Dissolve|publisher=Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time the Theranos website was inaccessible. The Wall Street Journal reported that any equity investments in the company were made worthless by the shutdown.

==Technology and products==
Theranos claimed to have developed devices to automate and miniaturize blood tests using microscopic blood volumes.

===Management===
From its incorporation in 2003 until 2018, Holmes was the company's chief executive officer. She recruited [[Channing Robertson]], a chemical-engineering professor at Stanford, to be a technical advisor and the company's first board member during its early years.
