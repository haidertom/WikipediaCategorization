The decade of the '''1950s in film''' involved many significant films.

==Events==

Films of the 1950s were of a wide variety. As a result of the introduction of television, the studios and companies sought to put audiences back in theaters. They used more techniques in presenting their films through widescreen and big-approach methods, such as [[Cinemascope]], [[VistaVision]], and [[Cinerama]], as well as gimmicks like [[3-D film]]. Big production and spectacle films perfect for this gained popularity, with the many historic and fantasy epics like ''[[The Robe (film)|The Robe]]'' (1953),''[[The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men]]'' (1952), ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' (1956), ''[[The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad]]'' (1958), and ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' (1959). Other big-scoped films thrived internationally, too, such as Russian fantasy director [[Aleksandr Ptushko]]'s mythological epics ''[[Sadko]]'', ''[[Ilya Muromets (film)|Ilya Muromets]]'', and ''[[Sampo]]'', and Japanese director [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s historic ''[[Seven Samurai]]'', ''[[Throne of Blood]]'', and ''[[Rashomon]]''. [[Toshiro Mifune]], who starred in those Kurosawa films, also starred in the color spectacle ''[[Samurai Trilogy]]''.

This spectacle approach, coupled with [[Cold War]] paranoia, a renewed interest in science from the [[atomic bomb]], as well as increased interest in the mysteries of outer space and other [[forteana]], lent itself well to what this film decade is best known for, [[science fiction]]. The [[science fiction film|science fiction]] genre began its [[golden age]] during this decade with such notable films as ''[[The Day the Earth Stood Still]]'' (1951), ''[[The Thing from Another World]]'' (1951), ''[[The War of the Worlds (1953 film)|The War of the Worlds]]'' (1953), ''[[It Came from Outer Space]]'' (1953), ''[[Creature from the Black Lagoon]]'' (1954), ''[[Them!]]'' (1954), ''[[This Island Earth]]'' (1955), ''[[Earth vs. the Flying Saucers]]'' (1956), and ''[[Forbidden Planet]]'' (1956). There were also Earth-based "sci-fi" subjects, such as ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954 film)|20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]'' (1954) and ''[[When Worlds Collide (1951 film)|When Worlds Collide]]'' (1951). Companies such as [[American International Pictures]], Japan's [[Toho]], and Britain's [[Hammer Film Productions]] were created to solely produce films of the [[fantastique]] genres.

The decade was equally adept at both character and realistic films. The highly noted actors [[James Stewart]], [[John Wayne]], and [[Marlon Brando]] were at the peak of their popularity. Stewart, starring in ''[[Winchester '73 (1950 film)|Winchester '73]]'', and Wayne, starring in John Ford's Cavalry Trilogy and ''[[The Searchers (film)|The Searchers]]'', revitalized the [[western film|western]]. Brando mastered versatile roles in films such as ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'', ''[[The Wild One]]'' (1953), ''[[Julius Caesar (1953 film)|Julius Caesar]]'', ''[[On the Waterfront]]'' (1954), ''[[Guys and Dolls (film)|Guys and Dolls]]'' (1955), ''[[The Teahouse of the August Moon (film)|The Teahouse of the August Moon]]'' (1956), and ''[[Sayonara]]'' (1957).

Director [[Alfred Hitchcock]] was at the peak of his craft, with films such as ''[[Strangers on a Train (film)|Strangers on a Train]]'' (1951), ''[[Dial M for Murder]]'' (1954), ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954), ''[[To Catch a Thief (film)|To Catch a Thief]]'' (1955), ''[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956 film)|The Man Who Knew Too Much]]'' (1956), ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958), and ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959), with [[James Stewart]] and [[Grace Kelly]] starring in three each. The [[Cinema of West Bengal|Bengali]] Indian director [[Satyajit Ray]], who began his career in the 1950s, was also at the peak of his career during this decade, with films such as ''[[The Apu Trilogy]]'' (1955–1959), ''[[Jalsaghar]]'' (1958), and ''[[Parash Pathar]]'' (1958).

'''Ananda Kentish Muthu Coomaraswamy''' ({{lang-ta|ஆனந்த குமாரசுவாமி}}, ''Ānanda Kentiś Muthū Kumāraswāmī''; 22 August 1877 − 9 September 1947) was a [[Ceylon]]ese [[Tamil people|Tamil]] philosopher and [[metaphysics| Metaphysicist]], as well as a pioneering historian and [[Aesthetics#Indian aesthetics|philosopher of Indian art]], particularly [[art history]] and [[symbol]]ism, and an early interpreter of [[Indian culture]] to the West.&lt;ref&gt;Murray Fowler, "In Memoriam: Ananda Kentish Coomaraswamy", ''Artibus Asiae,'' Vol. 10, No. 3 (1947), pp. 241-244&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, he is described as "the groundbreaking theorist who was largely responsible for introducing ancient Indian art to the West."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090201093042/http://mfa.org/collections/sub.asp?key=22&amp;subkey=133 MFA: South Asian Art].

==Life==
{{See also|Ponnambalam–Coomaraswamy family}}

Ananda Kentish Coomaraswamy was born in Colombo, Ceylon, now [[Sri Lanka]], to the [[Sri Lankan Tamil|Ceylon]]ese [[Sri Lanka Tamils (Indian origin)|Tamil]] legislator and philosopher Sir [[Muthu Coomaraswamy]] of the [[Ponnambalam–Coomaraswamy family]] and his English wife Elizabeth Beeby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Annual Ananda Coomaraswamy Memorial Oration 1999|url=http://kataragama.org/centers/akc_oration99.htm|accessdate=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen Taylor, ''Sir John Woodroffe Tantra and Bengal'', Routledge (2012), p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of Comparative Literature &amp; Aesthetics'', Volume 16 (1993), p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; His father died when Ananda was two years old, and Ananda spent much of his childhood and education abroad.

Coomaraswamy moved to England in 1879 and attended [[Wycliffe College (Gloucestershire)|Wycliffe College]], a preparatory school in [[Stroud, Gloucestershire]], at the age of twelve. In 1900, he graduated from [[University College London|University College]], London, with a degree in geology and botany. On 19 June 1902, Coomaraswamy married [[Ethel Mary Partridge]], an English photographer, who then traveled with him to Ceylon. Their marriage lasted until 1913. Coomaraswamy's field work between 1902 and 1906 earned him a [[doctor of science]] for his study of [[Ceylonese]] [[mineralogy]], and prompted the formation of the Geological Survey of Ceylon which he initially directed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/article-preview?article_id=7902 Philip Rawson, "A Professional Sage", ''The New York Review of Books,'' v. 26, no. 2 (February 22, 1979)]&lt;/ref&gt; While in Ceylon, the couple collaborated on ''Mediaeval Sinhalese Art''; Coomaraswamy wrote the text and Ethel provided the photographs. His work in Ceylon fueled Coomaraswamy's anti-[[Westernization]] sentiments.&lt;ref name="diglib.princeton.edu"&gt;{{cite web

|title=Stella Bloch Papers Relating to Ananda K. Coomaraswamy, 1890-1985 (bulk 1917-1930)
|publisher= Princeton University Library Manuscripts Division}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After their divorce, Partridge returned to England, where she became a famous weaver and later married the writer [[Philip Mairet]].

By 1906, Coomaraswamy had made it his mission to educate the West about Indian art, and was back in London with a large collection of photographs, actively seeking out artists to try to influence. He knew he could not rely on museum curators or other members of the cultural establishment – in 1908 he wrote "The main difficulty so far seems to have been that Indian art has been studied so far only by archaeologists. It is not archaeologists, but artists … who are the best qualified to judge of the significance of works of art considered as art." By 1909, he was firmly acquainted with [[Jacob Epstein]] and [[Eric Gill]], the city's two most important early Modernists, and soon both of them had begun to incorporate Indian aesthetics into their work. The curiously hybrid sculptures that were produced as a result can be seen to form the very roots of what is now considered British Modernism.&lt;ref&gt;Arrowsmith, Rupert Richard.

Coomaraswamy then met and married a British woman [[Ratan Devi|Alice Ethel Richardson]] and together they went to India and stayed on a houseboat in [[Srinagar]] in Kashmir. Commaraswamy studied Rajput painting while his wife studied Indian music with Abdul Rahim of Kapurthala. When they returned to England, Alice performed Indian song under the stage name [[Ratan Devi]]. Alice was successful and both went to America when Ratan Devi did a concert tour. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.open.ac.uk/researchprojects/makingbritain/content/alice-richardson Alice Richardson], Making Britain, Open University, Retrieved 17 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt; While they were there, Coomaraswamy was invited to serve as the first Keeper of Indian art in the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Boston Museum of Fine Arts]] in 1917.&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;G. R. Seaman, ''[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/55201 Coomaraswamy, Ananda Kentish (1877–1947)]'', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 17 Oct 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had two children, a son, Narada, and daughter, Rohini.
[[File:AnandaCoomaraswamy.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of Ananda Coomaraswamy, published 1907]]

Coomaraswamy divorced his second wife after they arrived in America.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; He married the American artist [[Stella Bloch]], 29 years his junior, in November 1922.  Through the 1920s, Coomaraswamy and his wife were part of the [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] art circles in New York City, Coomaraswamy befriended [[Alfred Stieglitz]] and the artists who exhibited at Stieglitz's gallery. At the same time, he studied Sanskrit and Pali religious literature as well as Western religious works. He wrote catalogues for the Museum of Fine Arts and published his ''History of Indian and Indonesian Art'' in 1927.

After the couple divorced in 1930, they remained friends. Shortly thereafter, on 18 November 1930, Coomaraswamy married [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[Luisa Runstein]], 28 years younger, who was working as a society photographer under the professional name Xlata Llamas. They had a son, Coomaraswamy's third child, Rama Ponnambalam (1929-2006), who became a physician and convert at age 22 to the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Following [[Vatican II]], Rama became a critic of the reforms and author of Catholic [[Traditionalist School|Traditionalist]] works.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religioperennis.org/documents/stoddart/On_Rama_Coomaraswamy-by_Stoddart_and_de_Azevedo.pdf "Rama P.Coomaraswamy (1929-2006)" by William Stoddart and Mateus Soares de Azevedo (3 pdfs)]&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also ordained a Traditionalist Roman Catholic priest, despite the fact that he was married and had a living wife.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-pope.com/validity.html "On the Validity of My Ordination" by Dr. Rama P. Coomaraswamy]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933 Coomaraswamy's title at the Museum of Fine Arts changed from [[curator]] to Fellow for Research in Indian, [[Persian art|Persian]], and [[Mohammedan]] Art.&lt;ref name="diglib.princeton.edu"/&gt;

He served as curator in the Museum of Fine Arts until his death in [[Needham, Massachusetts]], in 1947. During his long career, he was instrumental in bringing Eastern art to the West. In fact, while at the Museum of Fine Arts, he built the first substantial collection of Indian art in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[[Princeton University Press]], [http://press.princeton.edu/titles/6166.html The Door in the Sky: Coomaraswamy on Myth and Meaning]&lt;/ref&gt;

He also helped with{{clarify|date=December 2014}}&lt;!--"Helped with" is rather vague. This really ought to be more specific.--&gt; the collections of [[Persian Art]] at the [[Freer Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and the Museum of Fine Arts.

After Coomaraswamy's death, his widow, Doña Luisa Runstein, acted as a guide and resource for students of his work.

==Contributions==
Coomaraswamy made important contributions to the philosophy of art, literature, and religion. In Ceylon, he applied the lessons of [[William Morris]] to Ceylonese culture {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} and, with his wife Ethel, produced a groundbreaking study of Ceylonese crafts and culture. While in India, he was part of the literary circle around [[Rabindranath Tagore]], and he contributed to the "[[Swadeshi]]" movement, an early phase of the struggle for Indian independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Antliff|first1=Allan|title=Anarchist Modernism : Art, Politics, and the First American Avant-Garde|date=2001|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=9780226021041|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s, he made pioneering discoveries in the history of Indian art, particularly some distinctions between [[Rajput]] and [[Moghul]] painting, and published his book ''Rajput Painting''. At the same time he amassed an unmatched collection of Rajput and Moghul paintings, which he took with him to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, when he joined its curatorial staff in 1917. Through 1932, from his base in Boston, he produced two kinds of publications: brilliant scholarship in his curatorial field but also graceful introductions to Indian and Asian art and culture, typified by ''The Dance of Shiva'', a collection of essays that remain in print to this day. Deeply influenced by [[René Guénon]], he became one of the founders of the [[Traditionalist School]]. His books and essays on art and culture, symbolism and metaphysics, scripture, folklore and myth, and still other topics, offer a remarkable education to readers who accept the challenges of his resolutely cross-cultural perspective and insistence on tying every point he makes back to sources in multiple traditions. He once remarked, "I actually think in both Eastern and Christian terms—Greek, Latin, Sanskrit, Pali, and to some extent Persian and Chinese."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ignca.gov.in/nl001801.htm Anand Coomaraswamy A Pen Sketch By - Dr. Rama P. Coomaraswamy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside the deep and not infrequently difficult writings of this period, he also delighted in polemical writings created for a larger audience—essays such as "Why exhibit works of art?" (1943).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studiesincomparativereligion.com/public/articles/Why_Exhibit_Works_of_Art-by_Ananda_Coomaraswamy.aspx Why Exhibit Works of Art?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100828112019/http://www.studiesincomparativereligion.com/public/articles/Why_Exhibit_Works_of_Art-by_Ananda_Coomaraswamy.aspx |date=28 August 2010 }}, essay. He also published a book of that title.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''The Information Society: An Introduction'' (Sage, 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;44), Armand Mattelart credits Coomaraswamy for coining the term 'post-industrial' in 1913.

== Perennial philosophy==
[[File:Ananda Coomaraswamy.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Coomaraswamy printed in the April 1916 issue of ''The Hindusthanee Student'']]
He was described by [[Heinrich Zimmer]] as "That noble scholar upon whose shoulders we are still standing."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stumbleupon.com/url/www.multiworld.org/m_versity/althinkers/coomara.htm Multiworld.org/m_versity/althinkers... - StumbleUpon&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; While serving as a curator to the Boston Museum of Fine Arts in the latter part of his life, he devoted his work to the explication of traditional metaphysics and symbolism. His writings of this period are filled with references to [[Plato]], [[Plotinus]], [[Clement of Alexandria|Clement]], [[Philo]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], [[Aquinas]], [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]], [[Meister Eckhart|Eckhart]], [[Rumi]] and other mystics. When asked how he defined himself foremost, Coomaraswamy said he was a "metaphysician", referring to the concept of [[perennial philosophy]], or ''sophia perennis''.

Along with [[René Guénon]] and [[Frithjof Schuon]], Coomaraswamy is regarded as one of the three founders of [[Integral Traditionalism|Perennialism]], also called the [[Traditionalist School]]. Several articles by Coomaraswamy on the subject of [[Hinduism]] and the perennial philosophy were [[List of works published posthumously|published posthumously]] in the quarterly journal ''[[Studies in Comparative Religion]]'' alongside articles by Schuon and Guénon among others.

Although he agrees with Guénon on the universal principles, Coomaraswamy's works are very different in form. By vocation, he was a scholar who dedicated the last decades of his life to "searching the Scriptures".{{clarify|date=December 2014}}&lt;!--It's not clear how this sentence relates to the sentence before it. What does "By vocation, he was a scholar" have to do with differences in the form of his writings (works)?--&gt; He offers a perspective on the tradition that complements Guénon's.{{clarify|date=December 2014}}&lt;!--(a) Which tradition? (b) What IS this perspective? Before, this was about differences in form (not explained). Now, it's about differences in perspective, also not explained. Remember, [[WP:MTAU]].--&gt; He was extremely perceptive regarding aesthetics and wrote dozens of articles on traditional arts and mythology. His works are also finely balanced intellectually. Although born in the [[Hindu]] tradition, he had a deep knowledge of the [[Western world|Western]] tradition as well as a great expertise in, and love for, Greek metaphysics, especially that of Plotinus, the founder of [[Neoplatonism]].

Coomaraswamy built a bridge between East and West that was designed to be two-way: among other things, his metaphysical writings aimed at ''demonstrating the unity of the Vedanta and Platonism''.  His works also sought to rehabilitate [[original Buddhism]], a tradition that Guénon had for a long time limited to a rebellion of the [[Kshatriya]]s against [[Brahmin]] authority.

[[File:ArielPlath.jpg|thumb|right| First edition ([[Faber and Faber]])]]

'''''Ariel''''' was the second book of [[Sylvia Plath]]'s poetry to be published, and was originally published in 1965, two years after her death by suicide. The poems in the 1965 edition of '''''Ariel''''', with their free flowing images and characteristically menacing psychic landscapes, marked a dramatic turn from Plath's earlier ''[[The Colossus and Other Poems|Colossus]]'' poems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/m_r/plath/colossus.htm |title=On "The Colossus" |publisher=English.illinois.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1965 edition of ''Ariel'', [[Ted Hughes]] changed Plath's chosen selection and arrangement by dropping twelve poems, adding twelve composed a few months later, and shifting the poems' ordering, in addition to including an introduction by the poet [[Robert Lowell]].&lt;ref name="powells1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powells.com/cgi-bin/biblio?inkey=62-0060732598-0 |title=''Ariel: The Restored Edition: A Facsimile of Plath's Manuscript, Reinstating Her Original Selection and Arrangement by Sylvia Plath''&amp;nbsp;– Powell's Books |publisher=Powells.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having Lowell write the introduction to the book was appropriate, since, in a BBC interview, Plath cited Lowell's book ''[[Life Studies]]'' as having had a profound influence over the poetry she was writing in this last phase of her writing career.&lt;ref name="youtube1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-v-U70xoZM&amp;feature=related |title=YouTube |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same interview, Plath also cited the poet [[Anne Sexton]] as an important influence on her writing during this time since Sexton was also exploring some of the same dark, taboo, personal subject matter that Plath was exploring in her writing.&lt;ref name="youtube1"/&gt;

In 2004 a new edition of ''Ariel'' was published which for the first time restored the selection and arrangement of the poems as Plath had left them; the 2004 edition also features a foreword by Plath and Hughes' daughter [[Frieda Hughes]].&lt;ref name="powells1"/&gt;

{{Culture of Bangladesh}}
{{Bengalis}} 
'''Bangladeshi art''' is a form of [[visual arts]] that has been practiced throughout the land of what is now known as [[Bangladesh]]. Bangladeshi art has a perennial history which originated more than two thousand years ago and is practiced even to this date. Among the various forms of Bangladeshi art, photography, architecture, sculpture and painting are the most notable.

== History ==
{{further|History of Bangladesh}}
The recent excavations of the artifacts in the archaeological site of [[Wari-Bateshwar ruins|Wari-Bateshwar]] indicates that the history of Bangladeshi art dates back to 450 BC.&lt;ref name=bpedia&gt;MM Hoque and SS Mostafizur Rahman, [http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Wari-Bateshwar Wari-Bateshwar], [[Banglapedia]]: The National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh, [[Asiatic Society]] of Bangladesh, [[Dhaka]], ''Retrieved: 11 January 2013''&lt;/ref&gt; However, more research is being carried out in this regard as these excavations conflict with the earlier notions about the existence of early urban civilization in Bangladesh. Proper evidence about the earliest development of Bangladeshi art refers to the [[Mauryan empire|Mauryan age]]. A number of sculptures have been discovered in Bangladesh which reflect the rich heritage of [[Mauryan art]].

The most significant development of Bangladeshi art took place during the [[Pala Empire|Pala rule]] which existed from 750–1174 CE. The Palas created a distinctive form of [[Buddhist art]] in Bangladesh which even influenced the [[Chinese art|Chinese]], [[Japanese art|Japanese]], [[History of Eastern art|eastern Asian]] and [[Tibetan art]].&lt;ref name="French 1928"&gt;{{cite book|last=French|first=JC|title=The art of the Pal empire of Bengal|year=1928|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YYXkAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=The%20Art%20of%20the%20Pala%20Empire%20of%20Bengal&amp;source=gbs_book_other_versions}}&lt;/ref&gt; This progress of Bangladeshi art continued to some extent during the [[Sena dynasty|Sena rule]] through the 11th and 12th centuries.

Bangladeshi art witnessed the influence of [[Islamic art]] though the arrival of [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent|Muslims in Bengal]] beginning from the 11th century. This influence started through the establishment of [[Sultanate of Bengal]] which covered most of the area of present-day Bangladesh. However, Islamic art in Bangladesh mostly flourished during the [[Mughal empire|Mughal rule]]. The Muslim dynasties mainly contributed in the architectural field. A huge influence of [[Islamic architecture]] can be seen in numerous mosques, shrines and mazars located throughout Bangladesh.

A new wave of evolution was introduced in Bangladeshi art through the pervading of [[British Raj|British rule]]. The British left their impact in almost every field of visual arts in Bangladesh. Bangladeshi art was bolstered through the introduction of [[Modern art]]. This period also gave birth to many famous artists in Bangladesh, including the great artist [[Zainul Abedin]].

== Photography ==
{{main|Photography in Bangladesh}}
Photography is the contemporary art form where Bangladesh has really made its mark. The early work was done by the pioneers like Golam Kasem Daddy, [[Manzoor Alam Beg]], Nowazesh Ahmed and Naibuddin Ahmed. Sayeeda Khanom was one of the first women photographers. [[Anwar Hossain (photographer)|Anwar Hossain]] brought about a shift through strong humanistic work in the late 1970s. Documentary photography practice was pioneered by [[Shahidul Alam]], who went on to set up the Drik Picture Library, Pathshala, the South Asian Media Institute; now considered one of the finest schools of photography in the world, [[Chobi Mela]]; the highly regarded biannual festival of photography and the Majority World Agency. [[Mohammad Rakibul Hasan]] has a great contribution in contemporary photo media. 

Women photographers have also taken up the profession with Taslima Akhter and Jannatul Mawa working on sustained personal projects. However, while Bangladeshi photography is celebrated worldwide, within Bangladesh it has not been sufficiently recognised. It is taught neither at the Faculty of Fine Arts (Charukala Institute) nor at the Department of Fine and Performing Arts (Shilpakala Academy). The entry rules of the Asian Art Biennale do not allow the submission of photography or video, though international artists have submitted photography and have been awarded for them.

[[Shahidul Alam]]'s book ''My journey as a witness'' was the first of a set of 40 books on Bangladeshi fine art to be brought out by the Italian publisher Skira jointly with the Bengal Foundation. Books by Kazi Ghiasuddin, Shafiuddin Ahmed and the great artist Zainul Abedin have since been published.

== Architecture ==
{{main|Architecture of Bangladesh}}
The remains of the ancient archaeological sites bear ample testimony to the fact that the art of architecture was practiced in Bangladesh from very early period of her history. The [[Somapura Mahavihara]], a creation of the Pala ruler [[Dharmapala]], at Paharpur, Bangladesh, is the largest Buddhist Vihara in the Indian subcontinent, and has been described as a "pleasure to the eyes of the world."&lt;ref name="French 1928"/&gt;

The [[Kantajew Temple]] in [[Dinajpur District, Bangladesh|Dinajpur]], built in [[navaratna (architecture)|navaratna]] style contains one of the finest examples of terracotta ornamentation of the late period of the art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journeyplus.com/bangladesh.html Journey plus – Dinajpur] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090823041638/http://www.journeyplus.com/bangladesh.html |date=23 August 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sixty Dome Mosque]] in [[Bagerhat District|Bagerhat]] has been described as "the most impressive Muslim monument in the whole of the Indian subcontinent."&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Shatgumbad_Mosque Shatgumbad Mosque], ''Banglapedia'', accessed 12 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lalbagh Fort]] is considered as one of the greatest examples of [[Mughal architecture]].

The influence of [[European architecture]] is also noticeable in several colonial monuments and churches in the country. The most significant one is [[Ahsan Manzil]], the former residence of the [[Nawabs of Dhaka]], later turned into a museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ahsan Manzil|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Ahsan_Manzil|publisher=[[Banglapedia]]|accessdate=12 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern context, Bangladeshi architecture has become more diversified comprising reflections of contemporary architectural attributes, aesthetic artistic and technologically advanced forms. Since the [[Independence of Bangladesh|inception of Bangladesh]], economical advancement has boosted the architecture from its traditional forms to contemporary context. With the growing urbanization and modernization, the architectural form is becoming modern, covering a wide range of its heritage and tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bangladesh.com/architecture/|title=Appealing Architecture – From Ancient Treasures to Contemporary Landmarks|accessdate=12 January 2013 |publisher=Bangladesh.com| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100108033246/http://www.bangladesh.com/architecture/| archivedate= 8 January 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sculpture ==
{{main|Sculptures of Bangladesh}}
Unlike other parts of the Indian Subcontinent, the art of sculpture in Bangladesh started through the [[Molding (process)|molding]] of terracotta because of the dearth of stone relief and abundance of the soft alluvial clay. This dates back to the 3rd/2nd century BC.

In course of time, the influence of north and central India began to grow in the sculptural art of Bangladesh and the introduction of stone sculpting started. From the early three centuries of the common era, the local sculptors started to make black stone sculptures in the [[Kusana]] style, native to northern India. These sculptures were the images of the deities worshiped by the followers of the three major religions of the time, namely, [[Brahmanism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]].

Bronze sculptures began to be assimilated in the 7th century AD primarily from the [[Chittagong Division|Chittagong region]]. The earliest sculptures of this kind were depictions of Buddhist beliefs but the art was later integrated into the [[Hindu art]] as well.

In modern times, the theme of sculptural art has been dominated by some historical events, mainly the [[Bangladesh liberation war]]. [[Aparajeyo Bangla]], [[Shabash Bangladesh]] are some of the noteworthy examples of this trend.

== Folk art ==
As in other countries of the world, the people of rustic, and primitive ideas developed [[folk art]] in Bangladesh. Because of this the structure and growth of the folk-art of Bangladesh are filled with pure and simple vigor and the symbolic representations of hope, aspiration and sense of beauty of the rural [[Bangladeshi people|Bangladeshi folk]]. The environment and the agricultural activities greatly helped to enrich the traditional folk-art of Bangladesh. It uses traditional motifs reflecting the land and its people. Different forms of folk art tend to repeat these common motifs. For instance, the lotus, the sun, the tree-of-life, flowery creepers etc. are seen in paintings, embroidery, weaving, carving and engraving. Other common motifs are fish, elephant, horse, peacock,circle, waves, temple, mosque etc. Many of these motifs have symbolical meanings. For example, the fish represents fertility, the sheaf of paddy prosperity, the lotus purity. Another important factor that has influenced the art and culture of this land is the six seasons.

The folk art of Bangladesh has been largely contributed by the rural women because of the aesthetic value as well as the quality of their work. A key reason behind it was that in most cases their art has been non-commercial, whereas the folk art produced by men has a commercial value attached to it. Thus, artists like blacksmiths, potters, cobblers, painters, goldsmiths, brass-smiths, weavers earn their livelihood from what they produce while traditionally, in the past, [[Alpana]] artists or [[Nakshi kantha]] needlewomen were working within their homes and received no monetary recompense for their labour. Both Alpana and Nakshi kantha are some of the most attractive forms of Bangladeshi folk art. [[Pottery]] and [[Ivory]] are also some popular forms of the art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Folk art of Bangladesh:In the eye of an American|url=http://www.theindependentbd.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=139100:folk-art-of-bangladesh-in-the-eye-of-an-american-folklorist&amp;catid=123:art-culture&amp;Itemid=217|publisher=[[The Independent (Bangladesh)|The Independent]]|accessdate=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ivory arts|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Ivory_Arts|publisher=[[Banglapedia]]|accessdate=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern Art ==
The movement of [[modern art]] in Bangladesh has its roots in the early 20th century. Back then there was no training or educational institutions for arts in Bangladesh. In the late 19th century, the British started to establish art schools in [[Calcutta]], then provincial capital of [[Bengal]] which inspired the local art admirers to pursue a particular form of art. The art lovers of Bangladesh or erstwhile [[East Bengal]] were also induced by this. This phenomenon gave birth to many preeminent figures of arts in Bangladesh whose fame not only spread through Bangladesh but also the whole world. Zainul Abedin was from this generation of artists. He is considered the pioneer of art movement in Bangladesh.

After the [[partition of India]], Calcutta became a part of [[West Bengal]] in India while the current geographical area of Bangladesh formed the [[East Pakistan]] province of [[Pakistan]]. Hence, the local artists felt a dire need of an art institution in Bangladesh. In 1948, Zainul Abedin, along with other leading local artists like [[Quamrul Hassan]], [[Safiuddin Ahmed]], Anwarul Huq, Khawaja Shafique established the [[Faculty of Fine Arts, University of Dhaka|Government Institute of Arts and Crafts]] to evolve the art tradition in Bangladesh.

Since the establishment of the art institute, the artists in Bangladesh started to gain the much required professionalism and also started to attach commercial value to it. This prompted them to organise art exhibitions to showcase their work to the audiences. By the 1960s the artists started to link with the art traditions of other parts of the world which gained them a pretty clear understanding of [[contemporary art]] in those countries. Many artists went to Europe and Japan for training and came back with new ideas and latest techniques, but they were also steeped in the traditions of indigenous art forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Modern Art|url=http://www.ebanglapedia.com/en/article.php?id=3555&amp;title=Modern-Art|publisher=[[Banglapedia]]|accessdate=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Bangladesh liberation war|independence of Bangladesh]], [[Shilpakala Academy|Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy]] was set up in 1974 which later started to organise regular art exhibitions and festivals involving both national and international artists. By this time, Bangladeshi art also began to get international recognitions and appreciations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inauguration of the Pavilion of Bangladesh on 3rd June at Venice|url=http://www.venicebiennale-bangladeshpavilion.org/|publisher=venicebiennale|accessdate=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary Art == 
Several art movements arose in Bangladesh as well, artists exhibited internationally and few groups of artists formed in the Bangladeshi contemporary art scene. Few institutions were established to be involved with contemporary creation. Several artists left the country and practiced on interdisciplinary media in Europe, America and Japan. Bangladeshi born [[Runa Islam]], [[Hasan M. Elahi|Hasan Elahi]], [[Naeem Mohaiemen]], [[Firoz Mahmud]], Rana Begum and [[Mohammad Rakibul Hasan]] practiced on various media including video, installation, photography, text, sound, painting and other new media of art and got recognition exhibiting internationally. Britto organised several art events on contemporary media. The 1990s saw greater connections between artists and their audience through increasing art venues and art sales&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://aaa.org.hk/en/ideas/ideas/bangladeshi-art-in-the-1990s/type/essays|title=Bangladeshi Art in the 1990s|last=Archive|first=Asia Art|website=aaa.org.hk|language=en|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 
[[Samdani Art Foundation]] was established in early 2010s and massively changing the scenario of contemporary art and culture via events such as the Dhaka Art Summit where "international, non-commercial research and exhibition platform for art and architecture"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dhakaartsummit.org/overview/|title=Overview|website=Dhaka Art Summit|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; of South Asia is organized. One of the noted contemporary artists is [[Maksudul Ahsan]].

'''''Belles on Their Toes''''' is a 1950 autobiographical book written by the siblings [[Frank Bunker Gilbreth, Jr.]] and [[Ernestine Gilbreth Carey]]. It is the follow-up to their book ''[[Cheaper by the Dozen]]'' (1948), which covered the period before [[Frank Gilbreth|Frank Gilbreth, Sr.]] died. It was adapted as a [[Belles on Their Toes (film)|film in 1952]].

==Title==
The title alludes both to a line in the [[nursery rhyme]] "[[Ride a cock horse to Banbury Cross]]" (i.e., "Rings on her fingers and bells on her toes") and to the marriages of the Gilbreth sisters:  "It was apparent that in order to get rings on their fingers, belles would have to be on their toes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gilbreth, Frank Bunker, Jr. |author2=Carey, Ernestine Gilbreth |last-author-amp=yes |title=Belles on Their Toes |date=1948 |page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
''Belles on Their Toes'' was written about the Gilbreth family after [[Frank Bunker Gilbreth]], Sr.'s death, and how they survived as their mother, [[Lillian Moller Gilbreth]], continued the pioneering work in [[industrial engineering]], [[time and motion studies]], and industrial/organizational psychology she had shared with her husband. This book is also the first place where the absence of the second oldest child, Mary Gilbreth, is explained; she died of [[diphtheria]] in 1912, at age five.

==Film adaptation==
''[[Belles on Their Toes (film)|Belles on Their Toes]]'' was made into a 1952 motion picture starring [[Myrna Loy]] as Lillian Gilbreth.

The '''Cloisters Cross''', also referred to as the '''[[Bury St Edmunds]] Cross''', is an unusually complex 12th century ivory [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] [[altar cross]] in [[The Cloisters]], part of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York. The cross is carved from [[walrus ivory]] and measures 22{{fraction|5|8}} × 14{{fraction|1|4}} in. (57.5 × 36.2&amp;nbsp;cm).

The carvings which cover both front and back sides include ninety-two intricately carved figures and ninety-eight inscriptions.  The figures, each of which is only about one-half inch tall, illustrate a number of [[Bible|Biblical]] scenes, and on the back a number of the [[Old Testament]] prophets with [[banderole (speech scroll)|banderole]]s containing quotations from their books. There is debate over whether or not these inscriptions are chosen with an [[anti-Semitic]] intent. The Metropolitan Museum of Art's website currently says: "Prominent among the inscriptions are several strong invectives against Jews. Though it is impossible to know precisely who commissioned this piece and with what aims, the cross certainly offers some indication of the anti-Semitism prevalent in England at this time. By the end of the thirteenth century, Jews were expelled from the country".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/07/euwb/ho_63.12.htm Metropolitan: The Cloisters Cross with another view] Accessed November 1st, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This theme was developed in a book by [[Thomas Hoving]], the curator involved when the Metropolitan acquired the cross, and later Director. This was unkindly described in an academic review of Elizabeth C. Parker and Charles T. Little as "an autobiographical romance...written in [[Raymond Chandler]] style".&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Burlington Magazine]]'', Vol. 136, No. 1096 (Jul., 1994), p. 459&lt;/ref&gt;

Parker and Little disagree with Hoving and think that it is doubtful that the cross, a sophisticated theological object, was specifically designed for the purpose of either castigating or converting any member of the small [[History of the Jews in England|Jewish]] population in [[England]] in the mid-twelfth century.

The sculptor is not known. Thomas Hoving, who managed the acquisition of the cross while he was associate curator at The Cloisters, concluded that it was carved by [[Master Hugo]] at [[Bury St Edmunds Abbey]] in [[Suffolk]]. However, beyond stylstic affinities there is no certain evidence to suggest that the cross was even made in England; although this is accepted by most scholars, other places of origin such as Germany have been proposed.

The history of the cross before it was acquired by [[Ante Topić Mimara]] is unknown.  He sold it to the Metropolitan Museum in 1963.  The [[British Museum]] was also keen to buy the cross, but they eventually declined, because Topić Mimara steadfastly refused to provide proof that he had full title to sell the cross. Hoving reportedly sat up drinking coffee with Topić Mimara until after midnight on the night that the British Museum's option lapsed, and he purchased the cross immediately afterwards for £200,000.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Watson &amp; Cecilia Todeschini (2007), ''The Medici Conspiracy: The Illicit Journey of Looted Antiquities from Italy's Tomb Raiders to the World's Greatest Museums'' (Public Affairs, NY), pp.134-135&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5222">'''Computer-aided mural''' ('''CAM''')  is the use of [[computer]] technology for designing mural art and wall decoration resulting in the [[frescography]] procedure, which was invented in 1998 by German muralist [[Rainer Maria Latzke]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patent-de.com/20000203/DE19829627C1.html Patent information for mural-reproduction technique]&lt;/ref&gt; CAM may be used to design completely individual illusionary or decorative mural art. It is especially useful for artists who re-use certain images in each project, but also for people who cannot draw or paint at all.
[[Image:CAM software screenshots.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Procedure for a CAM design (screenshots):
1.Step: Cut out motiv. 2.Step: Convert into smaller sizes for composition. 3.Store into database and define properties. 4.create CAM design]]

== Properties of CAM ==
When starting a new project CAM software requests a user to fill in measurements, these will usually be of the wall which the frescography is later mounted to. 
Once the project has been created the user may choose from a library of images which are categorized into themes and motives.
The library will either be filled with content by the user himself, or the user can purchase a CAM software which is already filled by the manufacturer, the Dreamworlds Design Studio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://download.cnet.com/Dreamworlds-Design-Studio/3000-18496_4-10907042.html?tag=mncol Dreamworlds Design Studio]&lt;/ref&gt;
The user creates designs by placing the motifs on the workspace. By giving the motifs layer attributes, it is possible to put image elements such as skies or oceans in the background and a beach or vegetation in the foreground. With additional options such as re-sizing and [[cropping]] individual motifs, a design gains depth and realistic proportions.

To avoid long waiting times when selecting new motifs CAM software uses low-[[Image resolution|resolution]] preview images. These are often only a hundredth of the original size, yet still large enough on a [[computer screen]]. After a design is completed it is converted into a PSD where each motif is automatically placed into its own layer to allow further changes and editing to be made with [[Adobe Systems]]'s [[Photoshop]].

== History and development ==
In the past, standard image editing software such as [[Photoshop]] or [[Illustrator]] were used to digitally create wall decoration such as [[Theatrical scenery|theatre backdrops]] or [[billboard]]s. The market for this type of art was scarce due to computers being expensive, and not being able to cope with the high resolution image files.
Only recent advances in computer and hardware technology allow artists to scan and print their work in very high and detailed quality. 

The last hurdle for artists to overcome was the large size a high-resolution image would produce. Even though there are no more problems cutting out individual images- to actually assemble several large images to create a design is still a challenge.
That is why CAM software not only works as design software, but is also a data management tool. In the front-office of the software the user will be working with low resolution files ([[GIF]] or [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] to keep transparency). Once a design is finished it is rendered or converted back into a [[Adobe Photoshop#File format|PSD]] file using the images maximum resolution and converting their color-coding from [[RGB]] to [[CMYK]].

== Computer hardware and operating systems ==
Today most Computer-Aided Mural software runs on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] based [[Personal Computer|PCs]]. Recent development in [[Emulator]] technologies and Apple's switch to [[Intel]] based hardware provide the option of running CAM software on Apple computers.
Because CAM software used low-resolution preview images while designing, there is no need for powerful computers. However developers recommend [[Intel Core 2 Duo]] technology and 2GB [[Random access memory|RAM]] or more.

==Printing and material==
[[Image:Pool with CAM designed murals.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Pool with a CAM designed wall mural printed with a vutek UV printer on synthetic canvas.]]A finished design is usually produced on Canvas, but depending on the printer a large variety of material may be used. With [[Ultraviolet|UV]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewpa.org/4.0.html?&amp;L=1  UV Drying Printing technologie (last paragraph)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[flatbed printer]]s also tiles, glass and other nonflexible material can be used as support. Because of the mostly large size of the files the images are usually given in with 72 [[Dots per inch|DPI]] but through [[interpolation]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.surewest.net/frcn/Interpolation.html What is Interpolation]&lt;/ref&gt; methods appear optically like a higher resolution print. 

The lifetime of the print depends on the material; however modern printers offer an anti-abrasion layer to coat the material while being printed. Additionally, invisible UV and protective coating may be applied manually to increase the products lifetime. Manufacturers state that a Frescography will last over 10 years without noticeable change.

According to international organizations such as [[UNESCO]] and the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT), '''cultural industries''' (sometimes also known as "[[creative industries]]") combine the creation, production, and [[Distribution (business)|distribution]] of [[good (accounting)|goods]] and [[Service (economics)|services]] that are [[cultural]] in nature and usually protected by [[intellectual property]] rights.&lt;ref&gt;. "Exploring The Cultural and Creative Industries Debate". Culture Action Europe. Retrieved 2013-07-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The concept==
The notion of cultural industries generally includes textual, [[music]], [[television]], and [[film]] production and [[publishing]], as well as crafts and design. For some countries, [[architecture]], the visual and [[performing arts]], [[sport]], [[advertising]], and cultural tourism may be included as adding value to the content and generating values for individuals and societies. They are knowledge-based and labour-intensive, creating employment and wealth. By nurturing creativity and fostering innovation societies will maintain cultural diversity and enhance economic performance.

Cultural industries worldwide have adapted [[To The New]] digital technologies and to the arrival of national, regional and international (de)regulatory policies. These factors have radically altered the context in which cultural goods, services, and investments flow between countries and, consequently, these industries have undergone a process of internationalization and progressive concentration, resulting in the formation of a few big conglomerates: a new global [[oligopoly]].

|[[Image:Death poem by Kuroki Hiroshi.jpg|frame|The ''jisei'', or death poem, of Kuroki Hiroshi, a Japanese sailor who died in a [[Kaiten]] suicide torpedo accident on 7 September 1944. It reads: "This brave man, so filled with love for his country that he finds it difficult to die, is calling out to his friends and about to die".]]
}}
The '''death poem''' is a genre of [[poetry]] that developed in the literary traditions of [[East Asia]]n cultures—most prominently in [[Culture of Japan|Japan]] as well as certain periods of [[Chinese history]] and [[Joseon Korea]]. They tend to offer a reflection on death—both in general and concerning the imminent death of the author—that is often coupled with a meaningful observation on life. The practice of writing a death poem has its origins in [[Zen Buddhism]]. It is a concept or worldview derived from the [[Buddhist]] teaching of the {{nihongo|[[three marks of existence]]|三法印|sanbōin}}, specifically that the material world is transient and {{nihongo|[[Impermanence|impermanent]]|無常|mujō}}, that attachment to it causes {{nihongo|[[dukkha|suffering]]|苦|ku}}, and ultimately all reality is an {{nihongo|[[śūnyatā|emptiness or absence of self-nature]]|空|kū}}. These poems became associated with the literate, spiritual, and ruling segments of society, as they were customarily composed by a poet, warrior, nobleman, or [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[Bhikkhu|monk]].

The writing of a poem at the time of one's death and reflecting on the nature of death in an impermanent, transitory world is unique to East Asian culture. It has close ties with Buddhism, and particularly the mystical [[Zen Buddhism]] (of Japan), [[Chan Buddhism]] (of China) and [[Seon Buddhism]] (of Korea). From its inception, Buddhism has stressed the importance of death because awareness of death is what prompted the Buddha to perceive the ultimate futility of worldly concerns and pleasures. A death poem exemplifies both the "eternal loneliness" that is found at the heart of Zen and the search for a new viewpoint, a new way of looking at life and things generally, or a version of enlightenment (''[[satori]]'' in Japanese;'' [[Wu (Chinese religion)|wu]]'' in Chinese). According to comparative religion scholar [[Julia Ching]], [[Japanese Buddhism]] "is so closely associated with the memory of the dead and the ancestral cult that the family shrines dedicated to the ancestors, and still occupying a place of honor in homes, are popularly called the ''Butsudan'', literally 'the Buddhist altars'. It has been the custom in modern Japan to have [[Shinto wedding]]s, but to turn to Buddhism in times of bereavement and for funeral services".&lt;ref&gt;[[Julia Ching]], "Buddhism: A Foreign Religion in China. Chinese Perspectives", in [[Hans Küng]] and Julia Ching (editors), ''Christianity and Chinese Religions'' (New York: Doubleday, 1989), 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

The writing of a death poem was limited to the society's literate class, ruling class, samurai, and monks. It was introduced to Western audiences during World War II when Japanese soldiers, emboldened by their culture's [[samurai]] legacy, would write poems before suicidal missions or battles.&lt;ref&gt;Mayumi Ito, ''Japanese Tokko Soldiers and Their Jisei''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Style and technique===
The poem's structure can be in one of many forms, including the two traditional forms in Japanese literature: [[Kanshi (poetry)|kanshi]] or [[waka (poetry)|waka]].{{efn|"Kanshi" is a Chinese-style poem written in Chinese characters by a Japanese poet; while "waka", which literally means "Japanese poem", is written in lines alternating between 5 and 7 syllables}} Sometimes they are written in the three-line, seventeen-syllable [[haiku]] form, although the most common type of death poem (called a ''jisei'' 辞世) is in the waka form called the [[tanka]] (also called a ''jisei-ei'' 辞世詠) which consists of five lines totaling 31 syllables (5-7-5-7-7)—a form that constitutes over half of surviving death poems.(Ogiu, 317-318).

Poetry has long been a core part of Japanese tradition. Death poems are typically graceful, natural, and emotionally neutral, in accordance with the teachings of [[Buddhism]] and [[Shinto]]. Excepting the earliest works of this tradition, it has been considered inappropriate to mention death explicitly; rather, [[metaphor]]ical references such as sunsets, autumn or falling [[cherry blossom]] suggest the transience of life.

It was an ancient custom in Japan for literate persons to compose a ''jisei'' on their deathbed. One of earliest records was recited by [[Prince Ōtsu]], executed in 686. For examples of death poems, see the articles on the famous haiku poet [[Matsuo Bashō|Bashō]], the Japanese Buddhist monk [[Ryōkan]], [[Ōta Dōkan]] (builder of [[Edo Castle]]), the monk [[Gesshū Sōko]], and the Japanese woodblock master [[Yoshitoshi|Tsukioka Yoshitoshi]]. The custom has continued into modern Japan. Some people left their death poems in multiple forms. Prince Ōtsu made both waka and kanshi, [[Sen no Rikyū]] made both kanshi and [[kyōka]].

On March 17, 1945, General [[Tadamichi Kuribayashi]], the Japanese commander-in chief during the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]], sent a final letter to Imperial Headquarters. In the message, General Kuribayashi apologized for failing to successfully defend Iwo Jima against the overwhelming forces of the United States military. At the same time, however, he expressed great pride in the heroism of his men, who, starving and thirsty, had been reduced to fighting with rifle butts and fists. He closed the message with three traditional death poems in ''[[waka (poetry)|waka]]'' form.

Though the book translates these lines as one poem, they in fact are three poems in waka form as shown in this article.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

In 1970, writer [[Yukio Mishima]] and his disciple [[Masakatsu Morita]] composed death poems before their attempted coup at the [[Ichigaya]] garrison in Tokyo, where they committed the ritual suicide of [[Seppuku]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Keene]], ''[[The Pleasures of Japanese Literature]]'', p.62&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|&lt;poem&gt;

Although he did not compose any formal death poem on his deathbed, the last poem written by the great poet [[Matsuo Bashō]] (1644-1694) recorded by his disciple [[Takarai Kikaku]] during his final illness is generally accepted as his poem of farewell:

{{quotation|&lt;poem&gt;

{{transl|ja|''Tabi ni yande''

Despite the seriousness of the subject matter, some Japanese poets have employed levity or irony in their final compositions. The Zen monk, Tokō (杜口; 1710–1795, aged 85), commented on the pretentiousness of some jisei in his own death poem:

{{quotation|&lt;poem&gt;
{{lang|ja|辞世とは

{{transl|ja|''Jisei to wa''

This poem by Moriya Sen'an (d. 1838) showed an expectation of an entertaining afterlife:

{{quotation|&lt;poem&gt;

Bury me when I die
beneath a wine barrel
in a tavern.
With luck
the cask will leak.&lt;ref name=Hoffmann/&gt;{{rp|81}}&lt;/poem&gt;}}

The final line, "hopefully the cask will leak" (''mori ya sen nan)'', is a play on the poet's name, Moriya Sen'an.

Written over a large calligraphic character 死 ''shi'', meaning Death, the Japanese Zen master [[Hakuin Ekaku]] (白隠 慧鶴; 1685-1768) wrote as his jisei:

{{quotation|&lt;poem&gt;

==Korean death poems==
Besides Korean Buddhist monks, Confucian scholars called [[seonbi]]s sometimes wrote death poems (절명시).  However, better-known examples are those written or recited by famous historical figures facing death when they were executed for loyalty to their former king or due to insidious plot.  They are therefore impromptu verses, often declaring their loyalty or steadfastness.  The following are some examples that are still learned by school children in Korea as models of loyalty.  These examples are written in Korean [[sijo]] (three lines of 3-4-3-4 or its variation) or in [[Hanja]] five-syllable format (5-5-5-5 for a total of 20 syllables) of ancient Chinese poetry (五言詩).

===Yi Gae===
[[Yi Gae]] (이개·1417–1456) was one of "[[six martyred ministers]]" who were executed for conspiring to assassinate [[Sejo of Joseon|King Sejo]], who usurped the throne from his nephew [[Danjong of Joseon|Danjong]]. Sejo offered to pardon six ministers including Yi Gae and Seong Sam-mun if they would repent their crime and accept his legitimacy, but Yi Gae and all others refused.  He recited the following poem in his cell before execution on June 8, 1456.  In this [[sijo]], Lord (임) actually should read ''someone beloved or cherished'', meaning King Danjong in this instance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sijomunhak.com/gnu4/bbs/board.php?bo_table=gosijo&amp;wr_id=143&amp;sfl=&amp;stx=&amp;sst=wr_hit&amp;sod=asc&amp;sop=and&amp;page=4 Korean Sijo Literature Association]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|&lt;poem&gt;
{{lang|ko|방안에 혔는 촛불 눌과 이별하엿관대
겉으로 눈물지고 속타는 줄 모르는다.
우리도 천리에 임 이별하고 속타는 듯하여라.}}

Oh, candlelight shining the room, with whom did you part?
You shed tears without and burn within, yet no one notices.
We part with our Lord on a long journey and burn like thee.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

===Seong Sam-mun===
Like Yi Gae, [[Seong Sam-mun]] (성삼문·1418–1456) was one of "six martyred ministers," and was the leader of the conspiracy to assassinate Sejo.  He refused the offer of pardon and denied Sejo's legitimacy.  He recited the following sijo in prison and the second one (five-syllable poem) on his way to the place of execution, where his limbs were tied to oxen and torn apart.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Cheon-tak, Cheong-gu-yeong-un, 1728&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|&lt;poem&gt;
{{lang|ko|이 몸이 죽어 가서 무어시 될고 하니,

===Jo Gwang-jo===
[[Jo Gwang-jo]] (조광조·1482–1519) was a [[neo-Confucian]] reformer who was framed by the conservative faction opposing his reforms in the [[Korean Literati Purges|Third Literati Purge of 1519]].  His political enemies slandered Jo to be disloyal by writing "Jo will become the king" (주초위왕, 走肖爲王) with honey on leaves so that caterpillars left behind the same phrase as if in supernatural manifestation.  [[Jungjong of Joseon|King Jungjong]] ordered his death by sending poison and abandoned Jo's reform measures.  Jo, who had believed to the end that Jungjong would see his errors, wrote the following before drinking poison on December 20, 1519.&lt;ref&gt;[[Annals of Joseon Dynasty]], December 16, 1519&lt;/ref&gt;  Repetition of similar looking words is used to emphasize strong conviction in this five-syllable poem.

{{lang|ko|愛君如愛父 (애군여애부) 임금 사랑하기를 아버지 사랑하듯 하였고
憂國如憂家 (우국여우가) 나라 걱정하기를 집안 근심처럼 하였다

Loved my sovereign as own father
Worried over country as own house
The bright sun looking down upon earth

===Jeong Mong-ju===
[[Jeong Mong-ju]] (정몽주·1337–1392), considered "father" of Korean neo-Confucianism, was a high minister of [[Goryeo]] dynasty when Yi Seong-gye overthrew Goryeo and established [[Joseon]] dynasty.  He  answered with the following sijo to the future [[Taejong of Joseon]] when the latter demanded his support for the new dynasty with [[Jeong Mong-ju#Poem|a poem of his own]].  Just as he suspected, he was assassinated the same night on April 4, 1392.

Should this body die and die again a hundred times over,
White bones turning to dust, with or without trace of soul,
My steadfast heart toward Lord, could it ever fade away?&lt;/poem&gt;}}

'''Ecodesign''' is an approach to designing products with special consideration for the environmental impacts of the product during its whole lifecycle.  In a [[life cycle assessment]], the life cycle of a product is usually divided into procurement, manufacture, use, and disposal.

Ecodesign is a growing responsibility and understanding of our [[ecological footprint]] on the planet. Green awareness, [[overpopulation]], [[industrialization]] and an increased environmental population have led to the questioning of consumer values. It is imperative to search for new building solutions that are [[environmentally friendly]] and lead to a reduction in the consumption of materials and [[energy consumption|energy]].

==Overview==
[[File:Stainless Steel Talbe with FSC Eucalyptus wood Ecodesign.JPG|thumb|left|200px|[[Stainless steel]] table with [[Forest Stewardship Council|FSC]] Teca wood - [[Brazil]] ecodesign]]
As the whole product's life cycle should be regarded in an integrated perspective, representatives from advance development, design, production, marketing, purchasing, and project management should work together on the Ecodesign of a further developed or new product.  Together, they have the best chance to predict the holistic effects of changes of the product and their environmental impact.

An eco-design product has a [[cradle-to-cradle]] life cycle ensuring zero waste is created in the whole process. By mimicking life cycles in nature, eco-design is a fundamental concept in achieving a truly [[circular economy]].

Environmental aspects which ought to be analysed for every stage of the life cycle are:

* Consumption of resources (energy, materials, water or land area)
* Emissions to air, water, and the ground (our Earth) as being relevant for the environment and human health
* Miscellaneous (e.g. noise and vibration)

Waste (hazardous waste and other waste defined in environmental legislation) is only an intermediate step and the final emissions to the environment (e.g. methane and leaching from landfills) are inventoried. All consumables, materials and parts used in the life cycle phases are accounted for, and all indirect environmental aspects linked to their production.

The environmental aspects of the phases of the life cycle are evaluated according to their environmental impact on the basis of a number of parameters, such as extent of environmental impact, potential for improvement, or potential of change.

According to this ranking the recommended changes are carried out and reviewed after a certain time.

==Environmental effect analysis==
[[File:Electric wire reel reused in a furniture ecodesign.jpg|right|thumb|350px|An electric wire reel reused as a center table in a [[Rio de Janeiro]] [[Interior design|decoration]] [[fair]]. The reuse of materials is a sustainable practice that is rapidly growing among [[designers]] in [[Brazil]].]]

One instrument to identify the factors that are important for the reduction of the environmental impact during all lifecycle stages is the environmental effect analysis (EEA).

For an EEA the following are taken into account:

* Customers' wishes
* Legal requirements, market requirements (competitors)
* Data concerning the product and the manufacturing process

==Applications in design==
Ecodesign concepts currently have a great influence on many aspects of design; the impact of [[global warming]] and an increase in CO₂ emissions have led companies to consider a more environmentally conscious approach to their design thinking and process.
In building design and construction, designers are taking on the concept of Ecodesign throughout the design process, from the choice of materials to the type of energy that is being consumed and the disposal of waste.

With respect to these concepts, [[online]] platforms dealing in only Ecodesign products are emerging, with the additional sustainable purpose of eliminating all unnecessary distribution steps between the designer and the final customer.&lt;ref&gt;http://nupe.co.uk/an-interview-with-sustainable-design-company-moorbi/ Kamran Assadi for Nupè April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''EcoMaterials''', such as the use of local raw materials, are less costly and reduce the environmental costs of shipping, fuel consumption, and CO₂ emissions generated from transportation. Certified green building materials, such as wood from sustainably managed forest plantations, with accreditations from companies such as the [[Forest Stewardship Council]] (FSC), or the Pan-European Forest Certification Council (PEFCC), can be used.

Several other types of components and materials can be used in sustainable buildings. Recyclable and recycled materials are commonly used in construction, but it is important that they don’t generate any waste during manufacture or after their life cycle ends. Reclaimed materials such as timber at a construction site or junkyard can be given a second life by reusing them as support beams in a new building or as furniture. Stones from an excavation can be used in a retaining wall. The reuse of these items means that less energy is consumed in making new products and a new natural aesthetic quality is achieved.

'''[[Water recycling]]''' systems such as rainwater tanks that harvest water for multiple purposes. Reusing [[grey water]] generated by households are a useful way of not wasting drinking water.

'''Off-grid homes''' only use clean electric power. They are completely separated and disconnected from the conventional electricity grid and receive their power supply by harnessing active or passive energy systems.

==Active system==
These systems use the principle of harnessing the power generated from renewable and inexhaustible sources of energy, for example; solar, wind, thermal, biomass, and geothermal energy.

'''[[Solar power]]''' is a widely known and used renewable energy source. An increase in technology has allowed solar power to be used in a wide variety of applications. Two types of solar panels generate heat into electricity. Thermal solar panels reduce or eliminate the consumption of gas and diesel, and reduce CO₂ emissions. Photovoltaic panels convert solar radiation into an electric current which can power any appliance. However, this is a more complex technology and is generally more expensive to manufacture than thermal panels.

'''[[Biomass]]''' is the energy source created from organic materials generated through a forced or spontaneous biological process.

'''[[Geothermal energy]]''' is obtained by harnessing heat from the ground. This type of energy can be used to heat and cool homes. It eliminates dependence on external energy and generates minimum waste. It is also hidden from view as it is placed underground, making it more aesthetically pleasing and easier to incorporate in a design.

'''Wind turbines''' are a useful application for areas without immediate conventional power sources, e.g., rural areas with schools and hospitals that need more power. Wind turbines can provide up to 30% of the energy consumed by a household but they are subject to regulations and technical specifications, such as the maximum distance at which the facility is located from the place of consumption and the power required and permitted for each property.

==Passive systems==
Buildings that integrate passive energy systems ([[bioclimatic buildings]]) are heated using non-mechanical methods, thereby optimizing natural resources. The use of optimal daylight plays an integral role in passive energy systems. This involves the positioning and location of a building to allow and make use of sunlight throughout the whole year. By using the sun's rays, thermal mass is stored into the building materials such as concrete and can generate enough heat for a room.

A '''[[green roof]]''' is a roof partially or completely covered with plants or other vegetation. This creates insulation that helps regulate the building's temperature. It also retains water, providing a water recycling system. It also provides soundproofing.

==In art and decorating==
Recycling has been used in art since the early part of the 20th century, when cubist artist [[Pablo Picasso]] (1881–1973) and [[Georges Braque]] (1882–1963) created collages from newsprints, packaging and other found materials. The "Outside Art" movement is recognized as a genuine expressive art form, and is celebrated because of the materials used and not in spite of them.  The same principle can be used inside the home, where found objects are now displayed with pride and collecting certain objects and materials to furnish a home is now admired rather than looked down upon.

There is a huge demand in Western countries to decorate homes in a "green" style. A lot of effort is placed into recycled product design and the creation of a natural look. This ideal is also a part of developing countries, although their use of recycled and natural products is often based in necessity and wanting to get maximum use out of materials.

[[Image:Fihi ma fihi sample.jpg|thumb|right|A page of ''Fihi ma Fihi'' from MuntaXab-i ''Fihi ma fihi'']]
The '''''Fihi Ma Fihi''''' ({{lang-fa|فیه مافیه}}; from {{lang-ar|فیه ما فیه}}), "It Is What It Is" or "In It What Is in It") is a [[Persian language|Persian]] prose work of a famous 13th century writer, [[Rumi]]. The book has 72 short discourses.

==Description==

=== The title and origin of the book ===
According to [[Jaafar Modarres-Sadeghi|J. M. Sadeghi]] the title "Fihi ma fihi" has appeared on a copy dated 1316. Another copy of the book dated 1350 has the title '''''Asrar al-jalalieh'''''. Rumi himself in the fifth volume of [[masnavi|''Masnavi-i Ma'navi'']] mentions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title="حکایت شیخ محمد سررزی غزنوی قدس الله سره" in Masnavi-i Ma'navi}}&lt;/ref&gt; that
{{cquote|&lt;center&gt; بس سوال و بس جواب و ماجرا &lt;br /&gt; بد میان زاهد و رب الوری &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; که زمین و آسمان پر نور شد &lt;br /&gt; در مقالات آن همه مذکور شد&lt;/center&gt;}}

which most likely refers to this book. The title '''''Maghalat-e Mowlana''''' of copies of the book published in Iran follows this.

Not much is known about the publication time and the writer of the book. According to [[forouzanfar|B. Forouzanfar]], the editor of the most reliable copy of the book, it is likely that the book was written by [[Sultan Walad|Sultanwalad]], the eldest son of Rumi, based on manuscripts and notes taken by himself or others from the lectures of his father on [[masnavi|''Masnavi-i Ma'navi'']].

In the ''Essence of Rumi'', John Baldock states that Fihi Mafihi was one of Rumi's discourses written towards the end of his life.  Rumi lived from 1207 to 1273 so ''Fihi Mafihi'' was likely written some time between 1260 and 1273 by Rumi himself.

==Significance==
This book is one of the first [[persian language|Persian]] prose books after the so-called [[Persian literature]] revolution (enghelāb-e adabi). Moreover, the book has become an introduction to the ''[[Masnavi]]''. Also many concepts in [[Sufism]] are described in this book in simple terms.

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Maghalat-mowlana-sample.png|thumb|right|A excerpt of "Maghãlât-e Mowlânâ" on "I hate poems".]] --&gt;

== English translations ==
The book has been ([[Untranslatability#Translation procedures|freely]]) translated into English under the title '''''Discourses of Rumi''''' by [[A. J. Arberry]]  in 1961 and consists of 71 discourses. An authoritative translation by Dr. Bankey Behari was published in 1998 under the title '''''Fiha Ma Fiha, Table Talk of Maulani Rumi''''' (DK Publishers, New Delhi), {{ISBN|81-7646-029-X}}.

==Plot==
[[Chen Zhen (character)|Chen Zhen]] ([[Jet Li]]) attends class in [[Kyoto University]] when some Japanese students from the Black Dragon Clan burst in and attempt to force him out because he is [[Chinese people|Chinese]]. Mitsuko Yamada ([[Shinobu Nakayama]]), one of Chen Zhen's female classmates who is in a romantic relationship with him, along with Chen's professor and classmates, defend his presence. The thugs turn violent but Chen easily defeats them using a variety of controlled [[Chin Na]] techniques. The Japanese thugs' [[sensei]], Funakochi Fumio ([[Yasuaki Kurata]]), who is also Mitsuko's uncle, arrives to take control of the situation and apologizes for his students' behavior. Fumio is impressed by Chen's skill and converses with him, and Chen learns that his [[sifu|master]] [[Huo Yuanjia]] has died after losing in a match against a Japanese Fighter. Chen is distraught after hearing the bad news and he leaves [[Kyoto]] for [[Shanghai International Settlement|Shanghai]] immediately.

Chen returns to [[Chin Woo Athletic Association|Jingwu School]] and learns that — his master's son Huo Ting'en ([[Chin Siu-ho]]) — has become the new master of the Jingwu. The next day, Chen goes to the Japanese [[dojo]] to challenge Ryoichi Akutagawa (Jackson Liu), the Japanese fighter who allegedly defeated Huo Yuanjia. Akutagawa honorably accepts Chen's challenge. Chen defeats Akutagawa easily and concludes that Akutagawa is not capable of defeating his master, after which he suspects [[crime|foul play]] in Huo Yuanjia's death. Chen has Huo's corpse exhumed for an autopsy against the wishes of Huo Ting'en and Jingwu's members. It is revealed that Huo Yuanjia was poisoned and weakened before his match against Akutagawa. Over the next few days, word of Chen's victory against Akutagawa spreads and Chen becomes a local celebrity in Shanghai. Jingwu's students begin to look up to Chen as their new instructor, which incurs the jealousy of Huo Ting'en. Huo remains silent and seeks comfort in a [[brothel]], where he becomes romantically involved with a prostitute Rose ([[Ada Choi]]).

Meanwhile, Akutagawa confronts General Gō Fujita ([[Billy Chow]]) of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] that his match result with Huo Yuanjia was pre-meditated by Fujita, which he considers dishonorable. After a heated argument, Fujita kills Akutagawa by breaking his back brutally in front of the Japanese ambassador (Toshimichi Takahashi), but places the blame for this on Chen Zhen. Enraged by their master's death, Akutagawa's students attack the Jingwu School, culminating in a fight that is eventually stopped by the local police. Chen is arrested and placed on trial for allegedly murdering Akutagawa. Several "witnesses" provide false and conflicting accounts of the murder, but the court refuses to accept testimony from any Chinese defense witnesses on the grounds of "bias" towards Chen. Mitsuko testifies that Chen is innocent because he spent the night with her, and the court accepts her false testimony because she is a Japanese. Chen is exonerated, but his apparent relationship with Mitsuko ruins his reputation, as the Chinese view it as an act of treachery against the Chinese empire. Huo Ting'en and the senior Jingwu members demand that Chen either leave Mitsuko or leave the school, and Huo uses the opportunity to settle his personal vendetta against Chen by challenging him to a fight. Chen defeats Huo eventually with much reluctance but chooses to leave with Mitsuko. Huo Ting'en is humiliated by his defeat and gives up his position as headmaster of Jingwu before leaving to join his lover. Jingwu's members eventually discover Huo's relationship with her and reprimand him. Huo learns his lesson and returns to Jingwu.

Chen and Mitsuko faces hostility from the locals and are forced to lay in an abandoned hut near Huo Yuanjia's grave. At the same time, Fumio arrives from Japan as requested by Fujita, to eliminate Chen. Fumio engages Chen in a [[blindfold]]ed fight, which ends in a draw, acknowledging that if Chen can learn to adapt to his opponent, he will be unbeatable. Fumio leaves after warning Chen about General Fujita's ill intentions and brutal methods. Days later, Huo Ting'en visits Chen and apologizes for his earlier behavior, saying that Jingwu School accepts Chen and Mitsuko's relationship now. Huo teaches Chen the [[Mizongyi|Mizong Fist]] that night while Mitsuko leaves secretly, leaving behind a message for Chen that she will wait for him in Japan.

The next day, Chen and Huo Ting'en confront Fujita at his dojo, where Fujita exposes a traitor from Jingwu, who played a role in Huo Yuanjia's death, and shoots him in order to atone for planning Huo's death. Huo Ting'en then fights Fujita, who appears to be incredibly strong and resilient, and Huo suffers grave injuries. Chen engages Fujita himself in a long and exhausting fight, and eventually defeats him. Just as Chen and Huo are about to leave, the enraged Fujita comes after them with a [[katana]]. Huo pushes Chen out of the katana's way but is stabbed in the arm, and Chen is forced to kill Fujita.  Armed Japanese soldiers then surround them and prepare to open fire. The Japanese ambassador (who is a [[pacifist]] against [[Japanese militarism]]) arrives and orders his soldiers to stand down. He agrees with Chen's actions as he has been aware that Fujita is a madman, but also warns them that the Japanese government will use Fujita's death as an excuse to start a war with China, unless the Chinese can account for Fujita's death by executing the murderer. Chen expresses his willingness to accept the blame for Fujita's death in order to prevent war, earning the ambassador's further admiration.  Instead of ordering Chen's death, the ambassador stages a fake execution and substitutes the dead Jingwu's traitor's body for Chen's, while Chen leaves Shanghai secretly to join Mitsuko in Japan once more.

==Influence on other films==
''Fist of Legend'' inspired [[the Wachowskis]] to hire [[Choreography|choreographer]] [[Yuen Woo-ping]] for the fight scenes in ''[[The Matrix]]''. The style of fighting in the two films bears some resemblance.

In 1996, an unofficial sequel titled ''Fists of Legends 2: Iron Bodyguards'' was released starring Jet Le (not Jet Li).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jing wu ying xiong 2: Tie bao biao (1996)|publisher=[[IMDb]]|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0217493/|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later films have also been influenced by ''Fist of Legend''. ''[[Hitman (1998 film)|Hitman]]'' also has a scene involving him using a belt as a weapon as seen previously. The more realistic and less [[wire fu|wire-driven]] fight choreography seen in ''[[Kiss of the Dragon]]'' was a result of fan criticism to [[Corey Yuen]]'s choreography in ''[[Romeo Must Die]]'' and preference for the style seen in ''Fist of Legend''.

In 2006, Jet Li played his character's teacher, [[Huo Yuanjia]], in ''[[Fearless (2006 film)|Fearless]]''.

In 2010, [[Gordon Chan]] and [[Andrew Lau]] produced a continuation of this film named ''[[Legend of the Fist: The Return of Chen Zhen]]'' with [[Donnie Yen]] as [[Chen Zhen (character)|Chen Zhen]] in his thirties.

==Box office==
Though ''Fist of Legend'' is widely considered one of Li's best films, during the downturn period of the Hong Kong film industry, its HK $14,785,382 box office gross was considered a disappointment. By comparison, Li's ''[[Fong Sai-yuk (film)|Fong Sai-yuk]]'' grossed over HK $30 million, and ''[[Fong Sai-yuk II]]'' grossed HK $23 million. However, its overall box office from other countries was good.

==Different versions==

===Miramax===
The English-dubbed U.S. release by [[Miramax Films|Miramax]] and [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Distribution]] contains four specific mistranslations that drastically alter the meaning of the film as a whole.

# Before Chen leaves Japan, Mitsuko asks him if he hates the Japanese. In the U.S. version he replies, "I don't hate." In the Hong Kong version he replies, "I don't know."
# In the U.S. version of the scene where Chen fights Fumio, Fumio asks him what the most effective way to defeat an enemy is. Chen replies that the most effective way is to focus one's energy and strike, and Fumio agrees with him. In the Hong Kong version, they begin by discussing their match. Chen says that the purpose of martial arts is to defeat an enemy. Fumio says, "No, you're wrong. The best way to defeat your enemy is to use a gun. Martial arts is about personal development."
# Prior to the final fight sequence in the U.S. version, Chen and Huo face Fujita who holds up a sign reading ''Dongya Bingfu'' (東亞病夫) and he tells them that the sign says, "Jingwu is closed". The Chinese characters are commonly translated to "[[Sick man of Asia|Sick men of the East]]" and is used as a famous reference to ''[[Fist of Fury]]''. The subtitles in the Hong Kong version translate the sign correctly.
# At the end in the U.S. version, Chen's driver asks him if he will go to be with Mitsuko. Chen responds, "If I no longer have a country, at least I can still be with the woman I love." His response in the Hong Kong version is, "Which area is most affected by Japanese invasion?" The driver says, "Tungshan" and he says, "We'll go to Tungshan then."

With regard to footage, this version deletes the final moments of students training and contains a brand new set of opening (animated) and closing credits in English, abandoning the previous ones completely.

===Taiwan===
Compared to the Hong Kong version, the 106 minute Mandarin-dubbed Taiwanese version contains the following footage:

# An extension to the scene where Fujita gives a harsh lecture to several men, prior to his order to spy on certain Japanese individuals.
# An extension of the scene with Chen after bowing to his master's shrine where Liu Zhensheng then hands over a suitcase to Chen and the latter proceeds to leave. Prior to following him, Mitsuko also respectfully bows.
# An entire scene where Hill Hung is looking for Huo Ting'en at a brothel, only to find him smoking [[opium]] with a prostitute.
# An entire scene where Hill Hung brings tea to Huo Ting'en, the night prior to the final match.
# An extension of Fumio talking with the ambassador, prior to the former winning the Go game.
# After the final fight ends, a very small extension sees the Japanese soldiers pause for a moment prior to entering the Dojo.

In the Mandarin soundtracks of the film, there is background music when Chen fights Huo. However, in the Cantonese soundtrack, the music only plays after Chen performs a Capoeira-style kick later on in the fight.

===Hong Kong===
The Hong Kong version in return, has the following footage:

# A reaction shot of the cook in the kitchen (followed by a shot from Huo Yuanjia's shrine) after Uncle Nong dispatches students to search for Huo Ting'en.
# A few seconds of Chen Zhen feigning death to Fujita.
# After the credits finish, we see the crew waving to the camera.

Both Hong Kong and Taiwanese version have slightly different end credits.

==Media==

===DVD===

====Ritek====
In 1997, the first DVD was released by Ritek in [[Republic of China|Taiwan]], which fans later reported to be an "uncut" version. This has been a widely held misconception - whilst this version does carry some more footage (as a Taiwanese version), it is in turn missing a few moments that the Hong Kong version has.

====Miramax====
On 15 February 2000, Miramax issued a DVD of this film in the [[United States|U.S.]] (later in the [[United Kingdom|U.K.]] too by [[Hollywood Pictures]] on VHS first, then DVD later on 29 March 2002). Whilst it featured better visual quality than any other release (some agree even to this day), it immediately caused an uproar with the [[Cinema of Hong Kong|Hong Kong Cinema]] fan community because it contained only a new English dub/score with alterations to the original dialogue and no original Cantonese option - a defect shared with many of their Hong Kong-acquired titles (not to mention the edits).

====HKVideo====
On 20 March 2002, the first official DVD of the Hong Kong version with a Cantonese soundtrack was issued by HKVideo in [[France]]. However, it contained no English subtitles. One notable difference to other versions carrying a Chinese/Taiwanese version is that it doesn't contain the ending text describing the aftermath of Jingwu School, but is otherwise the same and, bar a few missing frames, uncut.

====Maxam====
A lesser-known DVD was issued on 25 March 2005 by Japanese [[Film distributor|distributor]] Maxam which contains the Hong Kong version (and its ending text) in complete form, but no English subtitles.

====Dragon Dynasty====
A [[Regional lockout|R1]] 2-DVD "Ultimate Edition" was finally released on 9 September 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= FIST OF LEGEND Ultimate Edition DVD Review|work= Collider |date=|url= http://www.collider.com/dvd/reviews/article.asp/aid/9245/tcid/3 |accessdate=2010-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[The Weinstein Company]]'s [[Dragon Dynasty]] label in America, which features many extras and the original Cantonese soundtrack with English subtitles, marking the first official DVD release to do so. This version was also released in Australia ([[Regional lockout|Region 4]]), in single disk.

However, this is still visually the previous US version with the Cantonese soundtrack edited to fit its visuals. Matters are worsened when the subtitles revert to [[dubtitle]]s towards the end - relying on the previous incorrectly transcribed "Sick Men Of Asia" sign and story-changing ending (see [[#Miramax|above]]) from Miramax's English dub.

====New Age 21/HMH====
[[Germany|German]]-issued DVDs from distributor 'New Age 21' (released 12 November 2008) and 'HMH' (released 20 November 2008) were released in an uncut state and contain a Cantonese soundtrack with English subtitles.

====Other releases====
Other uncut English-subtitled releases of the Hong Kong Cantonese-language versions (now [[Out of print|OOP]]) include the US 'Tai Seng' [[VHS]] (released 20 October 2000), the [[Australia]]n 'Chinatown Video' VHS, the [[United Kingdom|U.K.]] 'Made In Hong Kong' VHS (released 1 October 1999), the [[Mei Ah Entertainment|Mei Ah]] [[Video CD|VCD]], VHS and [[Laserdisc|LD]].

The [[Malaysia]]n 'Speedy' VCD also contains a similar version, but enforces cuts to some scenes for violence:

# Fujita kneeing Ryōichi Akutagawa's back.
# Huo Ting'en hitting his head on a window during the finale.
# Chen Zhen hitting his head on a window during the finale.

The [[Spanish language|Spanish]] 'Manga Films' DVD entitled "El Mejor Luchador" (released 24 October 2001) and a slightly edited Indian 'Diskovery' VCD entitled "The Hitter: Fist Of The Legend" contain an English-dubbed version intended for export to English-speaking territories. Strangely, this version has aired occasionally on US TV with a Miramax [[Station identification|ident]], instead of their own produced version.

===Blu-ray===
Cine Asia released a Blu-ray version 22 March 2010 in the UK and on 20 April 2010 in USA.

[[File:Flag of the Pitcairn Islands.svg|thumb|Flag of the Pitcairn Islands]]

The '''coat of arms of the [[Pitcairn Islands]]''' was granted by [[royal warrant (document)|royal warrant]] dated November 4, 1969. The '''flag of the [[Pitcairn Islands]]''' was adopted on April 2, 1984. The design was suggested by the [[Pitcairn Island Council]] in December 1980 and approved by [[Queen Elizabeth II]] in April 1984. The flag was flown on Pitcairn for the first time in May 1984, during a visit by the then Governor, [[Richard Stratton (high commissioner)|Sir Richard Stratton]] (1980—84).

==Features==
The coat of arms of the Pitcairn Islands features a shield depicting the anchor and Bible from [[HMS Bounty|HMS ''Bounty'']]. This represents the ancestral history of the islanders, most of whom are descended from the sailors who mutinied on the ''Bounty'' in 1789. The design of the shield is green and blue representing the island rising from the ocean. The helmet and crest are  a flowering slip of [[Portia tree|miro]] and a Pitcairn Island wheelbarrow.

The flag of the Pitcairn Islands is a Blue Ensign with the Union Flag in the canton and the coat of arms of the Pitcairn Islands in the fly.

==Flag of Governor==
[[File:Flag of the Governor of the Pitcairn Islands.svg|thumb|Flag of the Governor of Pitcairn]]

The [[Governor of the Pitcairn Islands]] maintains a separate flag. This flag of the Governor consists of the Union Flag [[defacement (flag)|defaced]] with the coat of arms.

[[File:Stanley_Woolen_Mill_reflection_rotated.jpg|thumb|A flipped reflection in water of the [[Stanley Woolen Mill]] in Massachusetts]]
A '''flipped image''' or '''reversed image''', the more formal term, is a static or moving image that is generated by a mirror-reversal of an original across a horizontal axis (a ''[[Flopped image|flopped]]'' image is mirrored across the vertical axis).&lt;ref&gt;Ron Brinkmann, [https://books.google.com/books?id=O_W0_8opPgoC&amp;pg=PA133&amp;dq=flopped+image&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WoyNT7u2JaKk0QW3u73yDA&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=flopped%20image&amp;f=false "The Art and Science of Digital Compositing: Techniques for Visual Effects"], Morgan Kaufmann Publishers (2008), pp. 132–3. {{ISBN|978-0-12-370638-6}} ...shows examples.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many [[printmaking]] techniques produce images where the printed copy is reversed from the image made on the printing plate, so in a print copying another image, or a real scene or object, unless the artist deliberately creates the plate as a mirror-image of his subject, the finished print will be a mirror image of it.  Many print makers developed the skill of reversing images when making printing plates, but many prints, especially early ones, have images that are reversed.

==Photography==
Many large format cameras present the image of the scene being photographed as a flipped image through their viewfinders. Some photographers regard this as a beneficial feature, as the unfamiliarity of the format allows them to compose the elements of the picture properly without being distracted by the actual contents of the scene. The technique is meant to bypass or override the brain's visual processing which normally sees what is expected rather than what is there.

Flipping is occasionally used as a [[trompe l'oeil]] effect in scenes which incorporate reflections in a body of water.  The image is deliberately inverted so that people slowly discern that something is 'not quite right' with the picture, and come to notice that it is upside down.

'''Formalism''' is a school of [[literary criticism]] and [[literary theory]] having mainly to do with structural purposes of a particular text. It is the study of a text without taking into account any outside influence. Formalism rejects or sometimes simply "brackets" (''i.e.'', ignores for the purpose of analysis) notions of culture or societal influence, authorship, and content, and instead focuses on modes, genres, discourse, and forms.

==In literary theory==
In [[literary theory]], formalism refers to critical approaches that analyze, interpret, or evaluate the inherent features of a text. These features include not only [[grammar]] and [[syntax]] but also literary devices such as meter and [[Trope (literature)|tropes]]. The formalistic approach reduces the importance of a text’s historical, biographical, and cultural context.

Formalism rose to prominence in the early twentieth century as a reaction against [[Romanticist]] theories of literature, which centered on the artist and individual creative genius, and instead placed the text itself back into the spotlight to show how the text was indebted to forms and other works that had preceded it. Two schools of formalist literary criticism developed, [[Russian formalism]], and soon after Anglo-American [[New Criticism]]. Formalism was the dominant mode of academic literary study in the US at least from the end of the Second World War through the 1970s, especially as embodied in [[René Wellek]] and [[Austin Warren]]'s ''[[Theory of Literature]]'' (1948, 1955, 1962).

Beginning in the late 1970s, formalism was substantially displaced by various approaches (often with political aims or assumptions) that were suspicious of the idea that a literary work could be separated from its origins or uses.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The term has often had a pejorative cast and has been used by opponents to indicate either aridity or ideological deviance.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Some recent trends in academic literary criticism suggest that formalism may be making a comeback.&lt;ref&gt;“Formalism and its Malcontents: Benjamin and de Man on the Function of Allegory”, Jim Hansen, New Literary History, 2004, Vol. 35, No. 4, 663.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pedagogy==
William H Thelin criticizes Maxine Hairston’s approach to teaching composition from a current-traditional standpoint, which she then mixes with the political. He claims that “No matter how sound the politics … the student would have no choice but to regurgitate that dogma in the clearest terms possible and to shift concentration onto matters of structure and correctness”.&lt;ref&gt;Thelin, WIlliam H. "Advocating Language: An Ethical Approach to Politics in the Classroom". ''The Ethics of Writing Instruction''. Michael Pemberton, ed. Stamford: Ablex Publishing, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary Ann Cain writes that “formalism asserts that the text stands on its own as a complete entity, apart from the writer who produced it”.&lt;ref name="Cain, Mary Ann 1999"&gt;Cain, Mary Ann. "Problematizing Formalism: A Double-Cross of Genre Boundaries." ''College Composition and Communication''. 51:1 Sept 1999. 89-95.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Cain says that “one can regard textual products as teachable and still maintain that being a writer is a "natural" act, one not subject to instruction.&lt;ref name="Cain, Mary Ann 1999"/&gt; Composition, like creative writing, has flourished under the assumption that students are already writers, or have the capacity to learn-and that everyone should be writers. Yet the questions composition tends to pose within this assumption are not so much about which aspects of writing can or cannot be taught, but how writing can be taught and under what conditions.&lt;ref name="Cain, Mary Ann 1999"/&gt;
In regards to formalist composition, one must ask, “to what extent is this ‘need’ for ‘academic discourse’ real – any more than the need for more ‘imaginative writing’ is real-except to perform some function, to get something done?”.&lt;ref name="Cain, Mary Ann 1999"/&gt;

==Research==
Formalism research involves studying the ways in which students present their writing.&lt;ref name="Cain, Mary Ann 1999"/&gt; Some ways formalism research is conducted involves allowing the text to speak to the readers versus cutting out unintended meaning in a written piece. Respectively, these two methods deal with language as the “master” writer versus a teacher as the “master” writer.

===Russian formalism===
{{Main|Russian formalism}}
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}
Russian Formalism refers to the work of the Society for the Study of Poetic Language (OPOYAZ) founded in 1916 in St. Petersburg (then Petrograd) by [[Boris Eichenbaum]], [[Viktor Shklovsky]] and [[Yury Tynyanov]], and secondarily to the Moscow Linguistic Circle founded in 1914 by [[Roman Jakobson]]. (The folklorist [[Vladimir Propp]] is also often associated with the movement.) Eichenbaum's 1926 essay "The Theory of the 'Formal Method'" (translated in Lemon and Reis) provides an economical overview of the approach the Formalists advocated, which included the following basic ideas:
*The aim is to produce "a science of literature that would be both independent and factual," which is sometimes designated by the term ''[[poetics]].''{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}
*Since literature is made of language, linguistics will be a foundational element of the science of literature.
*Literature is autonomous from external conditions in the sense that literary language is distinct from ordinary uses of language, not least because it is not (entirely) communicative.
*Literature has its own history, a history of innovation in formal structures, and is not determined (as some crude versions of Marxism have it) by external, material history.
*What a work of literature says cannot be separated from ''how'' the literary work says it, and therefore the form and  of a work, far from being merely the decorative wrapping of an isolable content, is in fact part of the content of the work.

According to Eichenbaum, Shklovsky was the lead critic of the group, and Shklovsky contributed two of their most well-known concepts: defamiliarization (''ostraneniye,'' more literally, 'estrangement') and the plot/story distinction (''[[syuzhet]]/fabula''). "Defamiliarization" is one of the crucial ways in which literary language distinguishes itself from ordinary, communicative language, and is a feature of how art in general works, namely by presenting the world in a strange and new way that allows us to see things differently. Innovation in literary history is, according to Shklovsky, partly a matter of finding new techniques of defamiliarization. The plot/story distinction separates out the sequence of events the work relates (the story) from the sequence in which those events are presented in the work (the plot). Both of these concepts are attempts to describe the significance of the form of a literary work in order to define its "literariness." For the Russian Formalists as a whole, form is what makes something art to begin with, so in order to understand a work of art as a work of art (rather than as an ornamented communicative act) one must focus on its form.

This emphasis on form, seemingly at the expense of thematic content, was not well-received after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]]. One of the most sophisticated critiques of the Formalist project was [[Leon Trotsky]]'s ''[[Literature and Revolution]]'' (1924).{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Trotsky does not wholly dismiss the Formalist approach, but insists that "the methods of formal analysis are necessary, but insufficient" because they neglect the social world with which the human beings who write and read literature are bound up: "The form of art is, to a certain and very large degree, independent, but the artist who creates this form, and the spectator who is enjoying it, are not empty machines, one for creating form and the other for appreciating it. They are living people, with a crystallized psychology representing a certain unity, even if not entirely harmonious. This psychology is the result of social conditions" (180, 171). The Formalists were thus accused of being politically reactionary because of such unpatriotic remarks as Shklovsky's (quoted by Trotsky) that "Art was always free of life, and its color never reflected the color of the flag which waved over the fortress of the City"(source?)(164). The leaders of the movement suffered political persecution beginning in the 1920s, when [[Joseph Stalin]] came to power, which largely put an end to their inquiries. But their ideas continued to influence subsequent thinkers, partly due to Tzvetan Todorov's translations of their works in the 1960s and 1970s, including Todorov himself, Barthes, Genette and Jauss.

The Moscow Linguistic Circle founded by Jakobson was more directly concerned with recent developments in linguistics than Eichenbaum's group. Jakobson left Moscow for Prague in 1920 and in 1926 co-founded the Prague Linguistic Circle, which embodied similar interests, especially in the work of Ferdinand de Saussure.{{cn|date=December 2016}}

''''' Fur Traders Descending the Missouri''''' is an 1845 painting by [[George Caleb Bingham]]. Bingham brought the painting to [[St. Louis, Missouri]] on June 4, 1845, along with several other pieces of artwork.

One of Bingham's most famous paintings, this work is owned by the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City|New York]]. Painted around 1845 in the style called [[Luminism (American art style)|luminism]] by some historians of American art, it was originally entitled, ''French-Trader, [[Half-breed]] Son''. The [[American Art Union]] thought the title potentially controversial and renamed it when it was first exhibited. It reflected the reality of fur traders' common marriages with Native American women; in Canada the [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] ethnic group formed as a result. The painting is haunting for its evocation of an era in American history-—note, in particular, the [[Phrygian cap#In the United States|liberty cap]] worn by the older man. The animal in the boat is widely accepted as a bear cub and not a cat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/33.61 Metropolitan Museum of Art, Timeline]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Haitian Vodou art''' is art related to the [[Haitian Vodou]] religion. This religion has its roots in West African traditional religions brought to [[Haiti]] by slaves, but has assimilated elements from Europe and the Americas and continues to evolve. The most distinctive Vodou art form is the ''drapo Vodou'', an embroidered flag often decorated with sequins or beads, but the term covers a wide range of visual art forms including paintings, embroidered clothing, clay or wooden figures, musical instruments and assemblages. Since the 1950s there has been growing demand for Vodou art by tourists and collectors.

==Origins==

Art historians disagree on the origins of Haitian Vodou arts. [[Suzanne Blier]] makes the case that they come from the coastal areas of [[Benin]] and [[Togo]]. [[Robert Farris Thompson]] makes a plausible connection with Central Africa based on similarities with ''[[nkisi]]'' figures from the [[Kingdom of Kongo|Kongo]], and cosmograms, flags, drums and dances from that region.{{sfn|Vanhee|2002|p=244}}

The first slaves from West and Central Africa were brought to the Caribbean in the 16th century. Europeans often claimed that the slaves were being rescued from devil worship. 
However, the slaves maintained their religious practices in secret, and their priests were among the leaders of the first revolt in [[Haiti]] in 1791.{{sfn|Hodgson|2001}}
Haiti became the first independent nation of African people in the [[Western Hemisphere]] in 1804 under President [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]].{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}
The traditional religion continued to be banned, and as late as the 1940s the Catholic church undertook a campaign against Vodou, ransacked temples and burned religious artifacts. 
Many of the techniques of sacred art have now been forgotten, and few sculptures were being made by 2001.{{sfn|Hodgson|2001}}
The Vodou religion was finally recognized officially in 2002.{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}

The great majority of Haitians still practice the Vodou{{efn|The word ''Vodou'' means spirit.{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}}} religion. 
The religion continues to evolve, and in addition to the traditional West African ''lwo'' (spirits) it now includes the spirits of heroes of resistance to the colonial forces, and spirits of powerful religious leaders.{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}
The iconography of the Haitian Vodou religion combines elements from Africa, Europe and the Americas.{{sfn|Cosentino|2013}}
Thus a ''drapo'' made for an African spirit may include an image of a Catholic saint. 
The saint's image was originally in part designed to deceive Catholic missionaries, but also was chosen in recognition of similarity between the saint and the ''lwa''.{{sfn|Drapo Vodou : Spirit Flags}}
Since then the saint and the spirit have become [[Syncretism|syncretized]].{{sfn|Polk|1997|p=20}}

==Interpretation==
[[File:Antique ceremonial suit for Haitian Vodou Voudun rites.jpg|thumb|Antique ceremonial suit for Haitian Vodou rites]]
Vodou art can be difficult to classify in Western terms. 
Rachel Beauvoir-Dominique, writing of Marianne Lehmann's{{efn|Marianne Lehmann is a former Swiss diplomat who made her home in Port au Prince, Haiti, where she collected about 2,000 examples of Haitian sacred art over a twenty year period. [[UNESCO]] has contributed some funds towards indexing and photographing the collection, which includes musical instruments, figures dressed in costumes and other artifacts.{{sfn|Hodgson|2001}} }} Vodou art collection, notes that "even today, the Creole language does not possess any word to designate what Western civilization qualifies as 'art'."{{sfn|Benedicty-Kokken|2014|p=244}}
Poet and critic [[André Breton]] dismissed Haitian art, noting that Haiti had no museums or art collections. 
He apparently saw no value in the art associated with the "backward" Vodou religion.{{sfn|Benedicty-Kokken|2014|p=245}}

Some scholars distinguish narrative Haitian art, which may include depictions of events or ceremonies in which there are many images from Vodou, from "Vodou art" in the sense of art that has a sacred function. The latter would be designed for use in ceremonies or for placement in temples or on altars. 
Given the omnipresence of Vodou in Haiti, most narrative art would also include Vodou images.{{sfn|Crown|Rivers|Wilson|2013|p=110-111}}
However, the fluid and adaptive nature of Vodou makes it hard to clearly distinguish religion, art and religious art.{{sfn|Harvey|2014|p=219}}

Alessandra Benedicty points out that Western scholars are led by their [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] intellectual framework into trying to explain Vodou art in terms of "intellectual truths". 
Vodou is open-ended and sometimes purposely dissimulates. 
Benedicty writes that in "the Vodou/Haitian aesthetic system, the ''objet d'art'' nurtures ambivalence and demands that the reader or the spectator interpret and thus participate in the production of an artistic text's meaning."  If there is a ''[[veve]]'' in the work, there is a possibility that the ''[[lwa]]'' the work was made for will possess the viewer.{{sfn|Glover|2010|p=194}}
The purchaser of a Vodou altar or other artwork may be possessed by their purchase.{{sfn|Harvey|2014|p=219}}
A 1995 exhibit at the Fowler Museum of Cultural History in California of "The Sacred Arts of Haitian Vodou"  included dramatic ritual interactions between Vodouists and ''lwa'' that may have included possession.{{sfn|Harvey|2014|p=219}}

==Drapo==
A ''drapo Vodou'' is a handmade flag, typically embroidered and decorated with beads and sequins.
Although flags may have been made in West Africa before the arrival of Europeans, the flags widely used there by 1600 were derived from European flags. 
They were used as symbols of ethnic, military or religious allegiance.
The ''drapo Vodou'' also drew on Yoruba beadwork, Catholic vestments and Masonic aprons.{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}
In the 19th century and early 20th century most ''drapo Vodou'' were made from one or two colored fabric pieces decorated with embroidery, metal bangles and glass beads, with an image of the ''lwa'' made of shiny fabrics [[appliqué]]d to the cloth using techniques still followed in West Africa.{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}
Flags and banners used in the 21st century in rural areas often still have stylistically simple designs, in part due to the high cost of decorative material.{{sfn|Polk|1997|p=18}}

With the older flags the background field that frames the image was usually decorated with widely spaced sequins or beads. 
Modern flag makers often completely cover the fabric of the field with sparkling sequins of one color, or with intricate geometrical patterns. 
Borders, which were either simple or did not exist on early ''drapo Vodou'', have evolved into highly elaborate patterns.{{sfn|Polk|1997|p=21}}
The use of sequins in modern ''drapos'' dates to 1940, when Joseph Fortine saw a troupe of Afro-Brazilian samba dancers wearing sequin costumes in a Carnival parade. Fortine began to decorate the costumes of [[Rara]] band players with sequins, and in 1943 made a ''drapo Vodou'' for [[Damballa]] from a burlap coffee sack which he stretched on a wooden frame.
He made the image from sequin lines on a satin background, and added random sequins surrounding the image. 
Fortine taught his techniques to sequin artists such as Edgard Jean Louis, Sylva Joseph, Clotaire Bazile, and Yves Telemak. 
The youngest of these, Telemak, was the first to sign his work.{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}

There are two kinds of ''drapo Vodou''. The ''drapo servis'' are made for ceremonial use, and art flags are made for sale.{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}

===Drapo servis===
[[File:Trop Pou Te Haitian Vodou banners.jpg|thumb|Haitian Vodou drapos. The front flag is for Trop Pou Te.]]
The ''drapo servis'' are important religious icons. 
They are kept in shrine rooms, and carried by flag bearers in elaborate ceremonies in the main chamber of the temple. A ''drapo servis'' will include an image of a Catholic saint or a ''vèvè'' (trace-work emblem) of an ''lwa''{{efn|The ''lwas'' serve as intermediaries between humans and the supreme god.{{sfn|Drapo Vodou : Spirit Flags}} }} (spirit) such as [[Papa Legba]] or [[Ogun]] of the [[Yoruba religion]].{{sfn|Cosentino|2013}}
There are many ''lwas'', including [[Erzulie]], [[Guédé]], Damballa and [[La Sirene]].{{sfn|Drapo Vodou : Spirit Flags}} 
The purpose of a ceremonial ''drapo'' is to flatter the ''lwa'' in the hope of gaining favor in return.{{sfn|Drapo Vodou : Spirit Flags}} 
Usually ''drapo servis'' are made in pairs, for example representing Ogun and Damballa.
Ogun was the ''lwa'' who led the slaves to freedom, and Damballa is the snake, representing the life force.
Ogun may be paired with other ''lwas''.{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}

A ''drapo servis'' will have a central image surrounded by a diamond-shaped border, will often have a fringe, and will be {{convert|36|by|36|in}} in size. The image may depict a Catholic saint associated with an ''lwa'' or may be a ''veve'' that represents the ''lwa'' symbolically and provides a gateway for it to enter the world of humans.{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}
The image may be a [[Chromolithography|chromolithograph]], a vividly colored paper image from Italy, Mexico or Spain of a Catholic saint that has been syncretized with the corresponding African spirit of the drapo.  The image may be an outline of the saint traced from a chromolithograph, or may be a detailed and faithful copy of a chromolithograph in beads and sequins.{{sfn|Polk|1997|p=20}}

The most widely used images of saints are those of [[Isidore of Chios|Saint Isidore]], [[James, son of Zebedee|Saint James Major]], [[Saint Patrick]] and the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Holy Virgin]].{{sfn|Polk|1997|p=20}}
Veves include the ship of [[Agwé]], the cemetery cross of [[Baron Samedi]], the crossroads of Legba and so on.{{sfn|Polk|1997|p=19}}
An image of a mermaid is used on flags for the water spirit [[LaSiren]]. 
This does not derive from ''veve'' or Catholic origins, but seems to have come from European nautical sources.{{sfn|Polk|1997|p=20}}
The image of a fish is important in Vodou as in Christian art, but the Vodou symbol comes from [[Fon people|Fon]] mythology rather than Christianity.{{sfn|Desmangles|1992|p=151}}
It represents Agwé, who corresponds to the Fon sea deity Agbê.
Agbê took the shape of a fish when he was given responsibility for the sea.{{sfn|Desmangles|1992|p=152}}

===Art flags===
[[File:VoodooValris.jpg|thumb|Flag by George Valris]]
Art flags show much wider variation in size and theme than ''drapo servis'', and rarely have a fringe. Some flags are closer to tapestries.{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}
In the 1950s collectors started to buy ''drapo Vodou'', and the ''oungan'' (priests) began to make them for sale as a source of income. 
The next generation of artists, active in the 1990s, included Eviland Lalanne, Joseph Oldof Pierre, Le Petit Frere Mogirus, Wagler Vital, Georges Valris, Roland Rockville, Ronald Gouin, and Antoine Oleyant. They introduced various innovations, in part driven by the shortage of materials for flagmaking. Antoine Oleyant has been called "the artist who really brought the flags into the realm of fine art."{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}

In [[Port-au-Prince]] the skilled ''drapo'' artists have ready access to beads and sequins brought in from Canada and the United States. 
These artists earn their living from sales to tourists and to art galleries.{{sfn|Polk|1997|p=18}}
In the 21st century there have been considerable changes to ''drapo Vodou'' as an art-form, in which artists such as Myrlande Constant{{efn|Myrlande Constant, born in 1970, was taught seamstress and beading techniques by her mother, and worked in a factory making wedding dresses. She taught herself flagmaking, using beads rather than sequins, and has since become internationally recognized.{{sfn|Ulysse|2011}} }} have introduced new themes and techniques.
Other contemporary ''drapo'' artists include Evelyne Alcide, Roudy Azor, Gabriel Chery, Lindor Chiler, Mireille Delice, Christian Dorleus and Josiane Joseph.
Their large and elaborate ''drapo'' represent in greater details the interactions with the ''lwas'' in events such as Vodou ceremonies and weddings.
They may also represent evangelical Christian themes, or have secular subjects.{{sfn|Drapo Vodou : Spirit Flags}} 
Edgard Jean Louis, a well-known flagmaker, made a flag called "Diana Erzulie" that included a photograph of the English [[Princess Diana]].{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}
There is growing demand for such ''drapo'' by international art collectors.{{sfn|Drapo Vodou : Spirit Flags}}

==Other objects==
[[File:Haitian vodou altar to Petwo, Rada, and Gede spirits; November 5, 2010..jpg|thumb|Altar to Petwo, Rada, and Gede spirits; 2010]]
In the 1940s Haitian professional artists began to create imitations of images provided by foreign entrepreneurs. The images represented the foreigners' view of the essence of Vodou art. This interaction was later dismissed and the Haitian works were stated to be [[Authenticity in art|authentic]].{{sfn|Richman|2008|p=203}}
In 1949 fifteen artists decorated the Episcopal Saint Trinite Cathedral in Port-au-Prince with murals that contrast Vodou art and traditional scenes from the bible.
Thirteen of the artists were Catholics and/or Vodouists.{{sfn|Thomas|2014|p=190}}
In the 1950s the murals became world famous. African gods were found in the symbolism of Christian images. Thus the "Damballah Virgin" by Andre Dimanche was identified as [[Erzulie]], a lwa connected to Aphrodite, Mater Dolorosa, health and an angry Madonna.{{sfn|Thomas|2014|p=191}}

A doll incorporated in a work of Vodou art can be animated so it can perform supernatural work, protecting the home. The Haitian Vodou priest Georges René explains the process, saying "anything can do mystique if you believe in it... you have to turn it into mystic. You baptize it. You make a ceremony. You put the food the ''lwa'' eats... after that you can work with it. It gets a soul. You can put it on an altar."{{sfn|Apter|Derby|2009|p=357}}

[[Pierrot Barra]] (1942–99) and Marie Cassaise made sacred altar installations from everyday objects such as dolls, sunglasses, sequins, speedometers, rosaries, mirrors and tinsel.{{sfn|Cosentino|1998|p=9}}
Barra said his work was inspired by the Vodou spirits, who sometimes demanded it. He said, "When I sleep, while I'm dreaming, I see the Mysteries. When I sleep I see the spirits...they show me a design, some face, some kind of thing. Then when I wake up I create it."{{sfn|Cosentino|1999|p=16}}
A visitor to Port-au-Prince in 1991 described an altar installation Barra made for the mother goddess [[Ezili Dantor]]. Her head came from a plaster doll, with rouge, lipstick and white synthetic hair. She held a cutout picture of the baby Jesus, which represented the goddess's daughter Anais.{{sfn|Cosentino|1998|p=9}}
A red fabric snake was wrapped round the body of the goddess, and a small rubber baby doll was at the foot of the statue. The whole was decorated with sparkles and cheap jewelry. This was not a traditional design, but was immediately recognized by Vodouists as authentic Vodou art.{{sfn|Cosentino|1998|p=10}}

Distribution and copyrights are held by [[Columbia Pictures]]. ''Half Past Dead'' was released on November 15, 2002 by [[Screen Gems]]. The film grossed $19 million worldwide against its budget of $25 million.

==Plot==
{{story|date=August 2018}}
In [[San Francisco]], Sasha Petrosevitch (Steven Seagal) is a Russian car thief who's brought in by criminal Nick Frazier (Ja Rule)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Ja Rule|date=2018-08-11|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ja_Rule&amp;oldid=854451248|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; to work for crime boss Sonny Eckvall (Richard Bremmer), who apparently shot and killed Sasha's wife. After some time, FBI Special Agent Ellen "E. Z." Williams (Claudia Christian) and her team show up to nail Nick, but things go bad, and Sasha gets shot.

After eight months of recovery following his brief bout of being clinically dead from the shooting, Sasha is incarcerated along with Nick in the newly reopened Alcatraz prison. Run by the charismatic warden, Juan Ruiz "El Fuego" Escarzaga (Tony Plana), the place is known for its new state of the art death chamber where the condemned can choose from five different ways to die: lethal injection, gas chamber, hanging, firing squad, or electric chair.

Lester McKenna (Bruce Weitz), is the first death row prisoner brought to the new Alcatraz and also the first prisoner scheduled to be executed. An older man, he stole $200,000,000 worth of gold bricks in a heist that resulted in five deaths, and hid the loot at an unknown location. Federal Bureau of Prisons head Frank Hubbard ([[Stephen J. Cannell]]) and Supreme Court Justice Jane McPherson (Linda Thorson) have arrived to witness the execution, which is a result of June sentencing Lester.

But she's not the only one interested in Lester. A small but well equipped team of terrorists who call themselves the "49ers" have parachuted onto the Alcatraz island, and gained control of it. Led by 49er One, a.k.a. Hubbard's assistant Donny Johnson (Morris Chestnut), and 49er Six (Nia Peeples), the team finds Lester, and they want him to give up the location of his hidden stash of gold. When Lester will not tell them, Donny shoots a nearby priest (Eva-Maria Schönecker), and threatens to kill others if the information is not delivered.

Donny's plan is disrupted, however, when Sascha decides to step in and fight back. It turns out that Sasha is actually an undercover FBI agent who has been trying to use Nick to get to Sonny Eckvall. When Sasha rescues Lester, the 49ers strap Jane to the electric chair and threaten to kill her, all while Ellen and her team prepare a rescue plan from the mainland.

With the help of Nick and some of the other inmates such as Twitch (Kurupt) and Little Joe (Michael "Bear" Taliferro), Sasha sets out to rescue Jane and bring Donny down, before Alcatraz becomes everyone's final resting place.

[[File:HelenD'OylyCarte.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Helen Carte]] 

'''Helen Carte Boulter''' (born '''Susan Helen Couper Black'''; 12 May 1852 – 5 May 1913), also known as '''Helen Lenoir''', was the second wife of impresario and hotelier [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]]. She is best known for her stewardship of the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] and [[Savoy Hotel]] from the end of the 19th century and into the early 20th century.

Born in [[Wigtown]], Scotland, she attended the [[University of London]] from 1871–74 and pursued brief teaching and acting careers. In 1875, she met Richard D'Oyly Carte and soon became his assistant and business manager. She helped produce all of the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] and other [[Savoy Opera]]s, beginning with ''[[The Sorcerer]]'' in 1877 and for the rest of her life, and helped Carte with all of his business interests. One of her principal assignments was to superintend arrangements for American productions and tours of the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operas. Her grasp of detail and her diplomatic skills surpassed even those of her husband. 

She married Richard D'Oyly Carte in 1888. During the 1890s, with her husband's health declining, Helen assumed greater and greater responsibility for the businesses, taking full control upon his death in 1901. She remarried in 1902 but continued to own the opera company and run most of the Carte business interests until her death, when they passed to her stepson, [[Rupert D'Oyly Carte]].  Although the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company's operations decreased after Richard's death, Helen staged successful repertory seasons in London from 1906 to 1908, establishing that the Gilbert and Sullivan operas could continue to be revived profitably.  

By the time of her death in 1913, the opera company had become a repertory touring company, and [[W. S. Gilbert]] had died. Helen hired [[J. M. Gordon]] to preserve the company's unique style. In her will, she left the [[Savoy Theatre]], the [[Savoy Hotel]] and the opera company to Rupert, the last of which operated continuously until 1982.

==Life and career==
[[File:HelenCarte1885.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Painting of Helen Carte by [[Walter Richard Sickert]], c. 1885: ''The Acting Manager'']]

===Early years===
'''Susan Helen Couper Black''' (or '''Cowper Black''' in some sources)&lt;ref&gt;Cellier and Bridgeman, p. 379&lt;/ref&gt; was born in [[Wigtown]], Scotland, to George Couper Black (1820–c. 1874), [[procurator fiscal]] and banker, and his wife, Ellen, née Barham (1823–after 1877 from Penzance), the second of four siblings. One of her brothers, [[John McConnell Black]], later became a well-known botanist. Her grandfather, Robert Couper, M.D., was a Scottish physician and poet.&lt;ref&gt;Seeley, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;  

She attended the [[University of London]] from 1871–74 and was a gifted student, passing the examinations for Special Certificates in mathematics and in logic and moral philosophy (the university did not award degrees to women until 1878).  She also spoke several languages.  She registered at the university as '''Helen Susan Black'''.  After her studies, she taught mathematics and had a brief acting career, during which she changed her name to '''Helen Lenoir''' ("Black", in French).&lt;ref&gt;Seeley, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; She appeared at the Gaiety Theatre in [[Glasgow]], Scotland, in ''The Great Divorce Case''. While a member of the Theatre Royal, in [[Dublin]], Ireland in September 1875, Helen met Richard D'Oyly Carte. He was there to manage the first tour of ''[[Trial by Jury]]'', and Helen became fascinated by his vision for establishing a company to promote English [[comic opera]].&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; She gave up her next engagement to join his theatrical organisation.&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;Stedman, Jane W. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/59169, "Carte, Helen (1852–1913)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, September 2004, {{doi|10.1093/ref:odnb/59169}}; accessed 12 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1877, Helen's mother, then a widow, relocated with Helen's sister and two brothers to Australia. Helen had just become secretary to Richard D'Oyly Carte and remained in London to help with production of ''[[The Sorcerer]]'' at the [[Opera Comique]].

===The woman behind the man===
From the time that she was hired as Carte's secretary, Helen was intensely involved in his business affairs and had a grasp of detail and organisational and diplomacy skills that surpassed even Carte's.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 111–12&lt;/ref&gt; She became the business manager of the company and was also responsible for the [[Savoy Hotel]], into which she introduced the new hydraulic passenger lifts.  One of Helen's early tasks was to produce the British copyright performance of ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' in [[Paignton]].  She made fifteen visits to America to promote Carte's interests, superintending arrangements for American productions and tours of the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operas.  She also assisted in arranging American lecture tours for [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Matthew Arnold]] and others.  Helen, more than anyone else, was able to smooth out the differences between [[W. S. Gilbert]] and [[Arthur Sullivan]], in the 1880s, to ensure that the two produced more operas together.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Arthur.  [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32311, "Carte, Richard D'Oyly (1844–1901)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, September 2004, accessed 12 September 2008, {{doi|10.1093/ref:odnb/32311}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She also tactfully and sympathetically dealt with the personal and professional problems of the actors in the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]] casts.  The editor of ''The Era'' wrote in her obituary, "She never took advantage of anybody; but I never heard of her letting anybody take advantage of her."&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; 

[[File:Helen Carte Parasol.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Helen Carte, c. 1885, from ''The Sketch'', 1901]]
In 1886, Carte raised Helen's salary to £1,000 a year plus a 10% commission on the net profits of all business at his theatres.  According to historian Jane Stedman, "When she demurred, he wrote, 'You know very well, and so do all those who know anything about my affairs, that I could not have done the business at all, at any rate on nothing like the same scale, without you'".&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Carte's first wife had died in 1885, and Helen married Richard on 12 April 1888 in the [[Savoy Chapel]], with Sir [[Arthur Sullivan]] acting as Carte's best man.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Andrew.  ''Gilbert and Sullivan's London'' (1988; 2000), Faber &amp; Faber; {{ISBN|0-571-20016-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The couple's London home included the first private elevator. [[James McNeill Whistler]], a client of Carte's agency and friend of the Cartes, made an etching of Helen in 1887 or 1888, "Miss Lenoir", and later helped to decorate the Cartes' home. Although some sources refer to Mrs. Carte as "Helen D'Oyly Carte", this is incorrect, as D'Oyly was a given name, not a surname. Her married name was '''Helen Carte'''.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Throughout the 1890s, Richard's health was declining, and Helen assumed more and more of the responsibilities for the opera company and other family businesses. In his 1922 memoir, [[Henry Lytton]] described Helen Carte as follows:
:"She was a born business woman with an outstanding gift for organisation.  No financial statement was too intricate for her, and no contract too abstruse. Once, when I had to put one of her letters to me before my legal adviser... he declared firmly 'this letter must have been written by a solicitor.' He would not admit that any woman could draw up a document so cleverly guarded with qualifications.  Mrs. Carte, besides her natural business talent, had fine artistic taste and was a sound judge, too, of the capabilities of those who came to the theatre in search of engagements".&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/books/lytton_secrets/ch4.html Lytton, Henry.  ''Secrets of a Savoyard'' (1922), chapter 4]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1894, Carte hired his son [[Rupert D'Oyly Carte]] as an assistant. Rupert's older brother, Lucas (1872–1907), a barrister, was not involved in the family businesses and died of tuberculosis at the age of 34.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary of Lucas D'Oyly Carte, ''The Times'', 22 January 1907, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; With no new [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] shows written after 1896, the [[Savoy Theatre]] put on a number of [[Savoy operas|other shows]] for comparatively short runs, including several of Sullivan's less successful operas.

Gilbert]] with the first revival of ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'' at the Savoy in May 1897.&lt;ref&gt;''[[New York Post]]'', 7 January 1948&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899, the theatre finally had a new success in Sullivan and [[Basil Hood]]'s ''[[The Rose of Persia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Wearing, p. 844; and Gordon-Powell, Robin.

===After Carte's death===
[[File:BarringtonHelen.jpg|left|thumb|Helen with [[Rutland Barrington]], c. 1908]]
Richard died in 1901 leaving the theatre, opera company and hotel to Helen, who assumed full control of the family businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; She leased the [[Savoy Theatre]] to [[William Greet]] in 1901.  She oversaw his management of the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]]'s revival at the Savoy of ''[[Iolanthe]]'', and several new [[comic opera]]s including ''[[The Emerald Isle]]'' (1901; Sullivan and [[Edward German]], with a libretto by [[Basil Hood]]), ''[[Merrie England (opera)|Merrie England]]'' (1902) and ''[[A Princess of Kensington]]'' (1903; both by German and Hood).&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

The last of these ran for four months in early 1903 and then toured.  When ''A Princess'' closed at the Savoy, Greet terminated his lease,&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Penny Illustrated Paper and Illustrated Times]]'', 11 July 1903&lt;/ref&gt; and Helen leased the theatre to other managements until 8 December 1906. She had married [[Stanley Boulter]], a barrister, in 1902, but she continued to use the surname Carte in her business dealings. Boulter assisted her in the Savoy businesses. She was a founder member of the Society of West End Theatre Managers, along with [[Frank Curzon]], [[George Edwardes]], [[Arthur Bourchier]] and sixteen others.&lt;ref&gt;"The Society of West-End Theatre Managers", ''The Times'', 24 April 1908, pg. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her stepson Rupert took over his late father's role as Chairman of the [[Savoy Hotel]] in 1903, which Helen continued to own. The years between 1901 and 1906 saw a decline in the fortunes of the opera company.  The number of D'Oyly Carte repertory companies touring the provinces gradually declined until there was only one left, visiting often small centres of population.  After the company visited South Africa in 1905, more than half a year elapsed with no professional productions of G&amp;S in the British Isles.  During this period, Helen and Rupert focused their attention on the hotel side of the family interests, which were very profitable.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

In late 1906, Helen re-acquired the performing rights to the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operas from Gilbert (she already had those of Sullivan) and staged a repertory season at the Savoy Theatre, reviving the opera company and leasing the Savoy to herself. She persuaded the recently knighted Gilbert, now 71, to stage direct the productions in repertory, and once again she had to exercise the greatest tact, as Gilbert sometimes had difficulty accepting that he was no longer an equal partner and was taking no financial risk. Gilbert was angry that he had not been consulted regarding casting of the productions.&lt;ref name=Bridget&gt;Carte, Bridget D'Oyly. Foreword to Mander, Raymond and Joe Mitchenson, ''A Picture History of Gilbert and Sullivan'', Vista Books, London, 1962.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The season, and the following one, were tremendous successes, revitalising the company.  Contemporary accounts describe her taking three curtain calls with Gilbert on the opening night of the 1906 revival of ''The Yeomen of the Guard''.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;  

[[File:DOCplanter.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Planter in Embankment gardens behind the [[Savoy Hotel]]]]
After the repertory seasons in 1906–08 the company did not perform in London again until 1919, only touring throughout Britain during that time. Carte wrote in 1911 that her health made it impossible for her to produce any more revivals at the Savoy.&lt;ref name=Bridget/&gt; In March 1909, [[Charles H. Workman]] assumed management of the Savoy Theatre from the now frail Helen Carte Boulter. She continued to manage the rest of the family businesses with the assistance of Rupert. In 1911, the company hired [[J. M. Gordon]], who had been a member of the company under Gilbert's direction, as stage manager. Carte was so generous that [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] granted to her the Order of the [[League of Mercy]] in 1912.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

After another illness lasting several months, Helen died of a cerebral haemorrhage complicated by acute bronchitis in 1913, a week before her 61st birthday.  A private funeral was held at [[Golders Green]] crematorium.  In her will, she left the Savoy Theatre, the opera company and the Savoy Hotel to Rupert, bequests of £5,000 to each of her two brothers and smaller bequests to a number of friends and colleagues.  She left the considerable [[residuary estate]] to her husband.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 6 May 1913, p. 11, reporting on "Probated Will of Helen Boulter"&lt;/ref&gt; The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company continued to operate continuously until 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Skow, John.

[[Image:Ride a cock horse to Banbury Cross 1 - WW Denslow - Project Gutenberg etext 18546.jpg|thumb|[[William Wallace Denslow]]'s illustrations for a variant of ''Ride a cock horse'', from a 1901 edition of [[Mother Goose]].]]

A '''hobby horse''' (or '''hobby-horse''') is a child's [[toy]] [[horse]], particularly popular during the days before cars. Children played at riding a wooden hobby horse made of a straight stick with a small horse's head (of wood or stuffed fabric), and perhaps reins, attached to one end. The bottom end of the stick sometimes had a small wheel or wheels attached. This toy was also sometimes known as a '''cock horse''' (as in the [[nursery rhyme]] ''[[Ride a cock horse to Banbury Cross]]'') or '''stick horse'''.

Hobby horses feature in the worship of [[Rajasthan]]i folk deity [[Baba Ramdevji]], a reference to a [[Baba Ramdevji#Folklore about Baba Ramdevji|story about his childhood]]; wooden toy horses are popular offerings at his temple at [[Ramdevra]]. They also figured in the public rites of the [[Romania]]n [[Călușari]].&lt;ref&gt;O. Buhociu, ''Le folklore roumain de printemps'', 1957, p. 250&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other meanings ==
A hobby horse is not always a riding-stick like the child's toy; larger [[hobby horse]]s feature in some traditional seasonal customs (such as [[Mummers Play]]s and the [[Morris dance]] in [[England]]). They vary in size from a costume for one person to large frameworks carried by nine people.

[[File:George Cruikshank - Tristram Shandy, Plate V. My Uncle Toby on his Hobby-horse.jpg|thumb|right|In ''[[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman]]'', the characters' hobby-horses, or particular obsessions, are discussed in detail. Here, Uncle Toby's obsession with the military leads him and Trim - who gets caught up in Toby's enthusiasm - to begin acting out military actions. Illustration by [[George Cruikshank]].]]
From "hobby horse" (see [[Hobby horse (toy)#Etymology|Etymology]], below) came the expression "to ride one's hobby-horse", meaning "to follow a favourite pastime", and in turn, the modern sense of the term ''[[hobby]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"hobby," The Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd ed. 1989. OED Online. Oxford University Press. Retrieved 2010-06-26. [http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50106771]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is also connected to the ''[[draisine]]'', a forerunner of the [[bicycle]], invented by Baron [[Karl Drais|Karl von Drais]].  In 1818, a London coach-maker named Denis Johnson began producing an improved version, which was popularly known as the "hobby-horse".&lt;ref&gt;David V. Herlihy, ''Bicycle'', Yale University Press, 2004; pp. 31-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

The artistic movement, [[Dada]], is possibly named after a French child's word for hobby-horse.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Dachy, Dada &amp; les dadaïsmes, Paris, Gallimard, "Folio Essais", n° 257, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The word ''hobby'' is glossed by the [[OED]] as "a small or middle-sized horse; an ambling or pacing horse; a pony." The word is attested in English from the 14th century, as [[Middle English]] ''hobyn''. [[Old French]] had ''hobin'' or ''haubby'', whence Modern French ''aubin'' and Italian ''ubino''. But the Old French term is apparently adopted from English rather than vice versa. OED connects it to "the by-name ''Hobin'', ''Hobby''", a variant of ''Robin''" (compare the abbreviation ''Hob'' for ''Robert''). This appears to have been a name customarily given to a cart-horse, as attested by [[White Kennett]] in his ''Parochial Antiquities '' (1695), who stated that "Our ploughmen to some one of their cart-horses generally give the name of Hobin, the very word which [[Philippe de Commines|Phil. Comines]] uses, Hist. VI. vii." Another familiar form of the same Christian name, ''Dobbin'' has also become a generic name for a cart-horse.

[[Samuel Johnson]], ''Dictionary of the English Language'', 1755, glosses "A strong, active horse, of a middle size, said to have been originally from Ireland; an ambling nag."

== Further use ==
Hoblers or Hovellers were men who kept a light nag that they may give instant information of threatened invasion. (Old French, hober, to move up and down; our hobby, q.v.) In mediæval times their duties were to reconnoitre, to carry intelligence, to harass stragglers, to act as spies, to intercept convoys, and to pursue fugitives. [[Henry Spelman]] (d. 1641) derived the word from "hobby".

{{quote|Hobblers were another description of cavalry more lightly armed, and taken from the class of men rated at 15 pounds and upwards.|[[John Lingard]]|''The History of England'', (1819), vol. iv. chap. ii. p. 116.}}

The Border horses, called hobblers or [[Horses in the Middle Ages#Hobbies|hobbies]], were small and active, and trained to cross the most difficult and boggy country, "and to get over where our footmen could scarce dare to follow." - [[George MacDonald Fraser]], ''The Steel Bonnets, The Story of the Anglo-Scottish Border Reivers''.

[[Hobby Horse Polo]] uses parts of the [[polo]] rules but has its own specialities, as e.g. 'punitive sherries' and is using hobby horses instead of ponies. The Hobby Horse variant started 1998 as a fun sport in south western Germany and lead 2002 to the foundation of the First Kurfürstlich-Kurpfälzisch Polo-Club in [[Mannheim]]. In the meantime it gained further interest in other German cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/steckenpferdpolo-trendsportart-in-duesseldorf-im-rheinpark-a-994129.html|title=Steckenpferdpolo: Trendsportart in Dsseldorf im Rheinpark|author=((Spiegel online, Hamburg, Germany))|date=27 September 2014|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hobby horse activities ==
[[File:Hobby horse jumping.jpg|thumb|330x330px|Jumping with a hobby horse.]]
Nowadays hobby horses are not only ridden by children, but also teenagers and adults. Hobby horses have become a popular hobby in Northern Europe, especially in Finland. Horses used are not mass produced toy horses, but fine, realistic pieces of art usually done completely by hand. Hobbyists give each of their horses names, breeds, genders and personalities. They also compete with hobby horses in same disciplines as real horses, the most popular disciplines being dressage and show jumping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ozy.com/fast-forward/a-horse-is-a-horse-except-sometimes-its-a-hobbyhorse/75088|title=Why Are Teenage Girls Riding Stick-Horses — Competitively?|last=Zublin|first=Fiona|work=OZY|access-date=2017-03-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Cartoons==

The hobby horse has been used numerous times in classic cartoons and in some new ones incorporating a Wild West theme.

*The [[Looney Tunes]] cartoon [[Buckaroo Bugs]] had [[Bugs Bunny]] riding a hobby horse while shooting a gun to escape from Red Hot Ryder as the Masked Marauder.
*There is another Looney Tunes cartoon called Wagon Heels, and it shows Injun Joe using the toy to head to a massacre.
*There is another Looney Tunes cartoon called Hobby Horse Laffs, but instead of a hobby horse in the title card, it shows a [[rocking horse]] instead.
*There is a Merrie Melodies cartoon called I've Got to Sing a Torch Song. In one short scene, a caricature of [[Ed Wynn]] rode a revamped version of a hobby horse towards a microphone to make an announcement.
*The [[Sheriff Callie's Wild West]] episode Peck Clowns Around had Peck dressed up as a [[rodeo clown]] riding a hobby horse instead of a real horse, like Sparky, that Sheriff Callie used in a rodeo. He thought it was humiliating, and he was laughed at by the entire audience, making Peck very angry.
*One of [[Spot the Dog]]'s toys is a hobby horse, usually stored under the stairs or in a closet in his house. It was used numerous times in Spot cartoons animated by [[King Rollo Films]]. In the Discover Spot episode Spot's Hobby Horse, Spot rides his hobby horse outdoors, then Steve takes a turn. When Helen strolls by the neighborhood to say hello to her friends, she is fascinated by Spot's hobby horse, so Steve hands it over to her. Steve then uses a stick as a hobby horse for the rest of this episode. Spot uses a [[broom]] and rides it like a hobby horse after failing to use a hose as one for the rest of this episode as well. The toy was also used in the Discover Spot episode Spot's Show, except it was used by Tom this time when he was pretending to be a cowboy in Spot's theatrical production. The Adventures of Spot episode Spot Goes to a Party has Spot dressed up as a cowboy going to a [[costume party]]. Sally gives him his hobby horse as an accessory to complete his look, explaining to him "Here's something else for your costume!" He then takes his hobby horse over to the party located at Helen's house but he left it over there. It is unknown if he ever picked up the toy from Helen's house to take back to his house. Instead of taking his hobby horse home, Spot rode home in a two person yellow polka dotted horse [[costume]], controlled by Steve and Tom, while acting like a cute little cowboy shouting "Howdy Mom! It was a great party!"

Following in the tradition of international art fairs and other global platforms for art exhibition and sale, Neha Kirpal, Founder and Director of India Art Fair realised the need for a similar platform in India to respond to the global interest in Indian art. This led to the first ever India Art Summit (IAS) in 2008. It was patronised by prominent Indian artists like [[Anjolie Ela Menon]], [[S H Raza]], [[Krishen Khanna]] and [[Keshav Malik]].&lt;ref name=toi1 /&gt; Since then it has taken place every year with the exception of 2010.

'''''Mammon''''', originally exhibited as '''''Mammon{{notatypo|.}} Dedicated to his Worshippers''''', is an 1885 [[oil painting]] by English artist [[George Frederic Watts]], currently in [[Tate Britain]]. One of a number of paintings by Watts in this period on the theme of the corrupting influence of wealth, ''Mammon'' shows a scene from [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' in which [[Mammon]], the embodiment of greed, crushes the weak through his indifference to their plight. This reflected Watts's belief that wealth was taking the place of religion in modern society, and that this worship of riches was leading to social deterioration. The painting was one of a group of works Watts donated to the [[Victoria and Albert Museum|South Kensington Museum]] (now the Victoria and Albert Museum) in late 1886, and in 1897 it was one of 17 Watts paintings transferred to the newly created [[Tate Gallery]]. Although rarely exhibited outside the Tate Gallery, the popularity of reproductions made ''Mammon'' one of Watts's better known paintings.

==Background==
[[File:George Frederic Watts by Henry Herschel Hay Cameron.jpg|left|thumb|upright|George Frederic Watts in 1885|alt=elderly bearded man]]
[[George Frederic Watts]] was born in 1817, the son of a London musical instrument manufacturer.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=20}} His two brothers died in 1823, and his mother in 1826, giving Watts an obsession with death throughout his life.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=20}} Meanwhile, his father's strict [[evangelical Christianity]] led to Watts developing a deep knowledge of the Bible but a strong dislike of organised religion.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=20}} Watts was apprenticed as a sculptor at the age of 10, and at the age of 16 was proficient enough as an artist to be earning a living as a portrait painter and as a [[cricket]] illustrator.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=22}}{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=21}} At the age of 18 he gained admission to the [[Royal Academy schools]], although he disliked their methods and his attendance was intermittent.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=22}} In 1837 Watts was commissioned by Greek shipping magnate [[Alexander Constantine Ionides]] to copy a portrait of his father by renowned artist [[Samuel Lane]]; Ionides preferred Watts's version to the original and immediately commissioned two more paintings from him, allowing Watts to devote himself full-time to painting.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=23}}

In 1843 Watts travelled to Italy, where he remained for four years.{{sfn|Warner|1996|p=238}} On his return to London he suffered from depression, and painted a number of notably gloomy works. His skills were widely celebrated, and in 1856 he decided to devote himself to portrait painting.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=33}} His portraits were extremely highly regarded.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=33}} In 1867 he was elected a [[Royal Academician]], at the time the highest honour available to an artist,{{sfn|Warner|1996|p=238}}{{efn-ua|In Watts's time, honours such as knighthoods were only bestowed on presidents of major institutions, not on even the most well respected artists.{{sfn|Robinson|2007|p=135}} In 1885 serious consideration was given to raising Watts to the peerage; had this happened, he would have been the first artist so honoured.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=69}} In the same year, he refused the offer of a [[baronetcy]].{{sfn|Warner|1996|p=238}}}} although he rapidly became disillusioned with the culture of the Royal Academy.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=40}} From 1870 onwards he became widely renowned as a painter of [[Allegory|allegorical]] and mythical subjects;{{sfn|Warner|1996|p=238}} by this time, he was one of the most highly regarded artists in the world.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=xi}} In 1881 he added a glass-roofed gallery to his home at [[Little Holland House]], which was open to the public at weekends, further increasing his fame.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=42}} In 1884 a selection of 50 of his works were shown at New York's [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], believed to have been the first such exhibition by any artist.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=42}}

==Subject==
[[File:Watts – The Wife of Plutus.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Watts's ''The Wife of Plutus'' also depicted the corrupting influence of wealth.|alt=topless bare-breasted woman holding jewels]]
[[Mammon]] originally meant wealth in [[Aramaic]], but from the early days of the Christian Church the name was occasionally used to represent the personification of greed.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=230}} This notion of Mammon as an individual, rather than an abstract concept, became commonplace in English culture owing to [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', published in the late 16th century, and later in [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (1667), both of which treated Mammon as an individual exemplar of greed.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=230}} As was the case with almost all English artists of the period, Watts was heavily influenced by the works of both Spenser and Milton.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=230}}

Watts based ''Mammon'' on a scene from Book II of ''The Faerie Queene'' in which the protagonist Guyon encounters Mammon in a cave containing {{notatypo|"richesse such exceeding store as eie of man did never see before"}}.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=230}}&lt;ref&gt;''The Faerie Queene'', Edmund Spenser, Book II, Verse 32&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mammon'' was one of a series Watts painted at around this time on the theme of the corruption brought about by wealth, including ''The Wife of Plutus'' (1880s&lt;!-- not a typo, we don't know the year only that it was between 1880 and 1889 --&gt;), ''Sic Transit'' (1880–1882) and ''For he had Great Possessions'' (1894).{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=141}}

==Composition==
Watts depicted Mammon as a corrupted version of traditional images of the gods.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=232}} This reflected his belief that the worship of wealth was taking the place of traditional beliefs in modern society, and that this attitude, which he described as "the hypocritical veiling of the daily sacrifice made to this deity",{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=232}} was leading to social decay.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=230}} (His widow, [[Mary Seton Watts]], wrote in 1912 that Watts had said that "Mammon sits supreme, while great art, as a child of the nation, cannot find a place; the seat is not wide enough for both".{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=230}}) Mammon wears gold and scarlet robes, and crushes "whatever is weak and gentle and timid and lovely".{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=232}}{{efn-ua|From the description accompanying the painting on its initial exhibition.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=232}}}} Watts aimed to show Mammon not as crushing the weak through deliberate cruelty, but through an indifference to the damage he was causing.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=232}} His headdress resembles donkey's ears, an allusion to [[Thomas Carlyle]]'s description of "serious, most earnest Mammonism grown Midas-eared" in ''[[Past and Present (book)|Past and Present]]''.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=232}}

==Reception and legacy==
[[File:Assistants and George Frederic Watts - Hope - Google Art Project.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[P. T. Forsyth]] thought ''Mammon'' a companion to ''[[Hope (painting)|Hope]]'' (1886).|alt=blind girl sitting on an orange ball]]
''Mammon'' was first exhibited in 1885, under the title of ''Mammon{{notatypo|.}} Dedicated to his Worshippers''.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=232}} The catalogue accompanying this exhibition described this unusual title as "righteously scornful".{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=232}} Aside from an [[oil sketch]] now in the [[Watts Gallery]],{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=232}} only one completed version of ''Mammon'' was made.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=232}} This was among a number of paintings donated by Watts to the [[Victoria and Albert Museum|South Kensington Museum]] (now the Victoria and Albert Museum) in late 1886.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=22}} In 1897 it was one of the 17 Watts works transferred to the newly-created [[National Gallery of British Art|Tate Gallery]] (commonly known as the Tate Gallery, now Tate Britain);{{sfn|Bills|2011|p=9}} at the time, Watts was so highly regarded that an entire room of the new museum was dedicated to his works.{{sfn|Bills|2011|p=5}}{{sfn|Bills|2011|p=44}}

[[File:Watts – Progress (Watts Gallery version).jpg|right|thumb|upright|''Progress''|alt=horseman brandishing a bow rides behind three crouched figures]]
Although rarely exhibited outside the Tate Gallery, cheap photographic reproductions of ''Mammon'' made by [[Frederick Hollyer]] circulated widely, making it one of Watts's better-known paintings.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=232}} In 1887 it was one of the paintings discussed by Scottish theologian [[P. T. Forsyth]] in his series of lectures on "Religion in Recent Art". Forsyth considered ''Mammon'' a companion to Watts's 1885 ''[[Hope (painting)|Hope]]'', arguing that both depicted false gods and the perils awaiting those who attempted to follow them in the absence of faith.{{sfn|Tromans|2011|p=34}} By 1904 the image was well-enough known that the ''[[Daily Express]]'' reproduced the head of ''Mammon'' alongside that of [[John D. Rockefeller]], a person of whom the newspaper greatly disapproved,{{efn-ua|The accompanying article described Rockefeller as "the greatest money tyrant the world has ever known".{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=232}}}} implicitly inviting readers to draw comparisons.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=232}}

Watts returned to the theme of greed in ''Progress'' (1902–1904), one of his final works. This shows the figure of Mammon as one of three figures representing what Watts called "non-progress"; academia, wealth and laziness, oblivious to the emergence of Progress on horseback behind them.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=272}} The central figure was described by Watts as "money grubbing";{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=230}} as with ''Mammon'' and many of his other works, Watts aimed to show spiritual and material values as inherently contradictory.{{sfn|Bills|Bryant|2008|p=272}}

'''''Memories with Maya''''' is a [[hard science fiction]] novel by the author Clyde Dsouza. It has been received well by the [[transhumanism]] and the science community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kurzweilai.net/book-review-memories-with-maya |title=book review &amp;#124; Memories with Maya |publisher=KurzweilAI |date= |accessdate=2013-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel looks at how [[augmented reality]] and [[artificial intelligence|AI]] will merge to augment human beings in ways that will affect emotions, intimate human relationships, and our evolution as a species.

==Plot==
The story is a first person narrative told through the eyes of [[protagonist]] Daniel (Dan). Dan lives life on his own terms, convinced that he can hack his destiny through the use of technology to better his condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://io9.com/in-memories-with-maya-human-sexuality-gets-an-upgrade-1172882567 |title=In Memories with Maya, human sexuality gets an upgrade |publisher=Io9.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believes that prayer is panacea for the weak and he can steer the course of his life through the use of logic, technology and science.

With his close friend Krish, they merge [[artificial intelligence]] and [[augmented reality]] technology to create the ''Wizer'', a [[smartglasses|wearable visor]] much like [[Google Glass]] but powered by [[artificial general intelligence]]. The Wizer plays a key role in advancing the story and has uses in entertainment, sports, and even [[cyber sex]] via ''Dirrogates'' (a portmanteau of the words Digital and Surrogate, invented by the author)

Mid way through the story a dark side of ''Wizer'' technology and augmented reality comes to the front, with a major tragedy occurring in a nightclub. It changes the course of Dan and Krish's life. Dan experiences a loss that challenges him in no uncertain terms to prove he is capable of hacking his destiny. He faces internal turmoil, battling moral and ethical issues to emerge a [[transhuman]], both in mind and body.

==Reception==
The novel has received praise by science fiction reviewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hardsf.org/HSFRMemo.htm |title=Review - Memories With Maya by Clyde DeSouza |publisher=Hard SF |date= |accessdate=2013-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924024935/http://www.hardsf.org/HSFRMemo.htm |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies]] has featured the novel on their list of publications &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/publications#books |title=Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies: Publications |publisher=Ieet.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professionals and science fiction enthusiasts, have said the novel has more than [[hard science fiction]] in its pages, and some reviewers say they were touched on an emotional level as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tedhowardnz.wordpress.com/2013/06/09/book-review-memories-with-maya/ |title=Book review – Memories with Maya &amp;#124; Ted Howard NZ's Blog |publisher=Tedhowardnz.wordpress.com |date=2013-06-09 |accessdate=2013-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A writer for the [[Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies|IEET]] wrote an essay titled: ''Till Death do us part - The ethics and evolution of human relationships''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/nickence20130904 |title=Till Death do us part - The ethics and evolution of human relationships |publisher=Ieet.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; that interprets the reach of the technology described in the book and its effect on human relationships, even after death.

The '''Merioola Group''' (sometimes also called the "'''Sydney Charm School'''") was a Sydney-based group of Australian artists active during the 1940s and early 1950s. The group was named after ''Merioola'', a mansion where many of the group lived.

== Merioola house ==

[[File:Merioola house - front view.png|thumb|"Merioola" house as it appeared in 1911]]

The group took its name from ''Merioola'', a [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]]-era [[mansion]] converted into a [[boarding house]] in the Sydney suburb of [[Woollahra, New South Wales]], managed from 1941 by Chica Edgeworth Lowe. Lowe consciously encouraged artists, dancers, writers and theatre people to take up residence, forming the [[bohemian]] artistic centre of Sydney in the immediate post-war years.

Tenants included the European-born and trained artists [[Arthur Fleischmann]] (sculptor), Roland Strasser, Peter Kaiser, [[Michael Kmit]] and George de Olszanski. Others, such as [[Donald Friend]], Edgar Ritchard (artist and costume designer), [[Loudon Sainthill]] (later to become one of the most prominent theatre designers of the 20th century) and his life partner Harry Tatlock Miller (writer, critic and curator and subsequently the director of the Redfern Galleries, London), had lived and worked overseas.&lt;ref name="Diaries" /&gt; Others connected with the visual arts included photographer Alec Murray, painters Justin O'Brien, Mary Edwards, artist and later noted costume designer [[Jocelyn Rickards]]. Other tenants included dancers Alison Lee, Darya Collin, Beatrice Vitringer and Edmee Monod, author and historian [[Hector Bolitho]], architect George Beiers, civil engineer William Pierre Beiers, mathematician and astronomer John Sidgewick, musicians John and Norma [[Jon Bannenberg|Bannenberg]], and many others.&lt;ref name="French" /&gt;

When in Sydney, [[Rambert Dance Company|Ballet Rambert]] dancers often spent time at Merioola, where many theatrical and literary collaborations took place.&lt;ref name="nla" /&gt;

== Merioola and the Sydney Charm School ==

Although there was no common style or '[[Art movement|movement]]' at Merioola, it could be said that its artists were more interested in art as a light-hearted and poetic expression of the spirit and less interested in art as a progressive force. Many of the group had spent long years in the [[armed service]]s or had been [[displaced person]]s as a result of the [[World War II|war in Europe]].&lt;ref name="French" /&gt;

Artists under the label of the "Merioola Group" exhibited in both Sydney (November 1947) and Melbourne in 1947.&lt;ref name="French" /&gt;

[[File:Walter Gore at Merioola.jpg|thumb|Ballet Rambert dancer [[Walter Gore]] at ‘Merioola’, 1948]]

The "Sydney Charm School" was another term used synonymously to refer to the Merioola group of artists&lt;ref name="CanberraTimes-1988" /&gt; because they shared a light-hearted, decorative element in their work. The Sydney Charm School included painters [[William Dobell]], [[Russell Drysdale]], [[Donald Friend]], [[Lloyd Rees]], [[Jeffrey Smart]], [[Jean Bellette]], [[Paul Haefliger]], [[David Edgar Strachan|David Strachan]], [[Sali Herman]], [[Eric Wilson (artist)|Eric Wilson]], [[Mary Edwell-Burke]], [[Margaret Olley]], [[Roland Strasser]], [[Peter Kaiser (artist)|Peter Kaiser]], [[Harry Tatlock Miller]], [[Jocelyn Rickards]], [[Adrian Feint]], [[Arthur Fleischmann]], [[Eileen Haxton]] and applied artists [[Wallace Thornton]], [[Loudon Sainthill]] and [[Wolfgang Cardamatis]].&lt;ref name="NLAmagazine" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dutton" /&gt;

Paul Haefliger first used the phrase "Charm School" in 1948 in a review of the work of [[Jocelyn Rickards]].&lt;ref name="NLAmagazine" /&gt; Titled ‘Artist Relies on Charm’, Haefliger's review states that Rickard's work "certainly belongs to the charm-school and, as a substitute, it will carry this young artist quite a distance".&lt;ref name="SMH-1948" /&gt;

Later, the name "The Sydney Charm School" was disparagingly used by Australian Art critic [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]] to describe the Merioola group of artists. He believed that the art made in Sydney in the period circa 1940–1955 was less worthy than the works produced in Melbourne as it was decorative and overly romantic, unlike the "truthful vital energy of Melbourne".&lt;ref name="Judd" /&gt; Regarding the difference in art expressions between Sydney and Melbourne at that time Donald Friend commented:&lt;ref name="Dutton" /&gt;

{{Quote|''Melbourne during the war and after the war went in quite heavily for social realism, which is a kind of expression of resentment against being poor and other people being poor. Sydney artists were poor. They enjoyed themselves in their attics. They were drinking plonk and eating crusts of bread... the usual thing... We didn't think of resenting it. We had a bloody marvellous time and we did all sorts of interesting things. Sydney extroverted sort of things – plenty of laughter and plenty of laughter in the paintings.''}}

By its ad hoc nature the Merioola Group were destined not to last, and by the mid-1950s its original members had left or were on the point of leaving, most overseas. But while it lasted Merioola provided a bohemian atmosphere, described by its chronicler Christine France:

{{Quote|''In post-war Sydney, Merioola was probably the most exciting place to live. Justin O'Brien said, "I've never laughed so much, not at people but with people". Merioola was always full of visitors; both local and overseas artists would call in [and] the mix of creative people at Merioola often led to interdisciplinary activities. The dancers would pose for [Arthur] Fleischmann or Alec Murray. The artists would make sets for theatrical activities. And Harry [Tatlock Miller] and [[Loudon Sainthill|Loudon [Sainthill]]] and Alec [Murray] would combine their talents as editor, designer and photographer for Ballet Rambert and Old Vic programs.''&lt;ref name="Loudon Sainthill" /&gt;}}

'''[[Our Lady of Sorrows]], Queen of [[Poland]]''', '''Our Lady of Licheń''', or '''Virgin of [[Licheń Stary|Licheń]]''' is a [[Roman Catholic]] [[icon]] of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] venerated by its Polish faithful dating from 1772 and is permanently enshrined within the [[Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lichen|Sanctuary of Our Lady of Licheń]], in central Poland, which was built to honor it, and receives about 1.5 million pilgrims per year.&lt;ref&gt;''Moved by Mary: The Power of Pilgrimage in the Modern World'' by Anna-Karina Hermkens, Willy Jansen, Catrien Notermans 2009 {{ISBN|0-7546-6789-8}} page 99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Poland'' by Neal Bedford 2008 {{ISBN|1-74104-479-0}} page 401&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Matka Boska lichenska.jpg |thumb|200px|Close-up of the image.]]
[[File:Licheń - bazylika 08.JPG|thumb|200px|The framed icon (lower image in red) on the altar of the basilica.]]

Along with the [[Black Madonna of Częstochowa]], located in [[Częstochowa]], southern Poland, the image is one of the two most venerated Marian images in Poland. The image was canonically crowned by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 15 August 1967.

==Description==
In the central image, the Virgin Mary has a gold dress&lt;ref&gt;A new golden dress (named 'sapphire') was made in 2017 for the gratitude of the jubilee of 50 years from coronation of the icon in 1967. See the [http://www.lichen.pl/pl/579/szafirowa_sukienka_matki_bozej_lichenskiej official website of the shrine] (Polish).&lt;/ref&gt;, is being crowned by two angels and is surrounded by a ring of stars. Below the image a ribbon carries the inscription: "Queen of Poland, give us days of peace." The image measures 9.5 × 15.5&amp;nbsp;cm and is on larger panel of 16 × 25&amp;nbsp;cm. There is a second crown above the image, on the larger panel.

==Legend and history==

The icon was painted in 1772 as a replica of the icon of the Blessed Virgin Mary enshrined in [[Rokitno, Międzyrzecz County]] in Western Poland. According to legend, a Polish soldier (called Thomas Kłossowski) was wounded in the [[Battle of Leipzig]] in 1813 and had a vision of the Virgin Mary who saved him from death and instructed him to look for the image upon his return to Poland. Kłossowski is then said to have looked for and found the image in the woods in [[Grąblin]] as instructed.

According to oral tradition, in 1850 Kłossowski and shepherd Nicholas Sikatka witnessed several apparitions of the Virgin Mary who called for repentance and prayer. In the apparitions, the Virgin reportedly predicted war and a cholera epidemic, but also gave hope. During the cholera plague of 1852, the image became famous for performing miracles.

On 29 September  1852 the image was moved to the parish church in [[Licheń]] and remained there until 2006.  Cardinal [[Stefan Wyszynski]], the Primate of the Millennium gave its [[Canonical Coronation]] towards the image with the approval of Pope Paul VI on 15 August 1967.

==The basilica==
In 1994 the construction of the new basilica of [[Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lichen]] was started to house the image and accommodate the large number of pilgrims. Pope [[John Paul II]] blessed the basilica in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/travels/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_07061999_lichen_en.html Vatican web site: John Paul II at Lichen]&lt;/ref&gt; The basilica is Poland's largest church, the seventh largest in Europe and eleventh in the world. The basilica's organ manufactured by the Zych company (157 stops, 6 manuals and pedalboard) is the largest instrument in Poland, the fourth largest in Europe and thirteenth largest in the world&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Licheńskie organy na tle największych instrumentów Polski, Europy i świata |last=Szostak |first=Michał |date=2017 |publisher=Zakład Gospodarczy "Dom Pielgrzyma" |isbn=9788364126147 |location=Licheń Stary |pages=154-155 |oclc=1005163172}}&lt;/ref&gt;. On July 2, 2006 the image was placed in the main altar of the basilica.

The Sacramento Philharmonic is a symphony [[orchestra]] in the [[Sacramento]] region, established in 1997 after the disbandment of the Sacramento Symphony that same year.  Led by Maestro [[Michael Morgan (conductor)|Michael Morgan]], the orchestra performs at the [[Community Center Theatre]] and at the [[Mondavi Center]] at the [[University of California, Davis]]

== History ==

=== Sacramento Symphony Orchestra ===
The Sacramento Symphony was established in 1948 and rapidly became a large regional orchestra made up of local professional musicians.  However, starting in 1986 and continuing through the mid-1990s, the Sacramento Symphony had severe administrative difficulties and ran into significant operating deficits, repeatedly filing for bankruptcy.  Despite several moderate bail-outs from businesses, the general public and local government, in 1997 the Sacramento Symphony officially closed its doors.

Directors included [[Fritz Berens]] (1956?-1963?), who helped found the [[Sacramento Youth Symphony]], [[Harry Newstone]] [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/harry-newstone-475735.html](1965–78), who oversaw the move from the [[Memorial Auditorium (Sacramento)|Memorial Auditorium]] and the [[Hiram Johnson High School]] Auditorium (where most of the concerts were held {{citation needed|date=October 2013}}) to the new Community Center, [[Carter Nice]] (1979–92) and [[Geoffrey Simon]].

=== The Sacramento Philharmonic ===
Established the same year as the Symphony shut down, the new Sacramento Philharmonic, composed almost entirely of the same orchestra members, featured a significantly smaller schedule.  The Philharmonic, with the support of [[Sacramento County]], sought to avoid the unfortunate fate of the defunct Symphony and requested several market studies from national firms to help determine the potential for professional orchestral music in the Sacramento region.  With a similar population to Cleveland, which has a world-famous orchestra in the highest calibre, the potential, as determined by the studies, seemed positive.

In 2013, the Sacramento Philharmonic merged with the Sacramento Opera to form the Sacramento Region Performing Arts Alliance. A year after the merger, the new group announced it would sit out the 2014–15 season due to financial problems and disagreements between leaders of the two formerly separate organizations.&lt;ref name=NewsReview2014&gt;{{cite news |title=Sactown Symphony Saga |first=Jeff |last=Hudson |date=September 4, 2014 |work=News Review|url=https://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/sactown-symphony-saga/content?oid=14739632}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, the organization announced that it would reopen for the 2015–16 season. The group promoted its return with a series of surprise flash-mob style performances at locations throughout the city.&lt;ref name=SacBizJournal2015&gt;{{cite news |title=Sacramento Philharmonic retires music director, plans flash-mob-style marketing events |first=Mark |last=Anderson |date=April 16, 2015 |work=News Review|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sacramento/news/2015/04/16/sacramento-philharmonic-retires-music-director.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Seven Easy Pieces''''' was a series of [[performance art|performances]] given by artist [[Marina Abramović]] in [[New York City]] at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] in November 2005.

Although the performance art world traditionally frowns on repeating individual works, valuing their transient, ephemeral nature as intrinsic to their essence, as she aged, Abramović found herself compelled to preserve the performances that influenced her own development as an artist. Angry at seeing so many of the ideas developed in her and others' performances being appropriated without credit, including by commercial enterprises such as advertising and fashion, Abramović committed herself to archiving seven iconic works by recreating or reinterpreting them in ''Seven Easy Pieces'', but only with the expressed consent of each of the original artists or their estates. "There's nobody to keep the history straight," she told the ''New York Times'' in an interview published in early November 2005. "I felt almost, like, obliged. I felt like I have this function to do it."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/06/arts/design/06kenn.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0| New York Times, ''Self-mutilation is the sincerest form of flattery'', November 6, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Seven Easy Pieces'' is available on DVD and is considered{{who|date=August 2018}} to be useful for performing arts students who study [[post-structuralism]]. 

''Seven Easy Pieces'' comprised seven individual works – two of her own and five by other artists – performed on seven consecutive nights beginning on November 9th. They were, in order of performance:&lt;ref&gt;[http://pastexhibitions.guggenheim.org/abramovic/ Guggenheim exhibition web page for ''Seven Easy Pieces'']&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Bruce Nauman]]'s ''[[Body Pressure]]'' (1974)
*[[Vito Acconci]]'s ''[[Seedbed (performance piece)|Seedbed]]'' (1972)
*[[Valie Export]]'s ''Action Pants: Genital Panic'' (1969)
*[[Gina Pane]]'s ''The Conditioning'' (1973)
*[[Joseph Beuys]]'s ''[[How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare]]'' (1965)
*Abramović's own ''Lips of Thomas'' (1975)
*Abramović's own ''Entering the Other Side'' (2005)

'''Spook Hill''' is a [[gravity hill]], an [[optical illusion]] where cars appear to roll up the spooky hill in [[Lake Wales, Florida]].

Spook Hill is located on the [[Lake Wales Ridge National Wildlife Refuge|Lake Wales Ridge]], a [[geology|geologically]] significant range of sand and [[limestone]] hills, which were islands from two to three million years ago, when [[sea level]]s were much higher than at present.

The attraction is adjacent to Spook Hill Elementary School, which adopted [[Casper The Friendly Ghost]] as their school mascot. The attraction is also in close proximity to [[Bok Tower Gardens|Bok Tower]].

Spook Hill received national media attention when an article about it appeared on the front page of the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' on October 25, 1990, and it was featured in a segment on ''[[CBS Morning News]]'' with [[Charles Osgood]] on November 5, 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tampabayskeptics.org/Spook_Hill.html Tampa Bay Skeptics: Do cars really roll up Spook Hill?]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"The Frost King"''' was a short story about King [[Jack Frost]] written by 12-year-old [[Helen Keller]].&lt;ref name="Berube"&gt;Bérubé, Michael. [http://www.thenation.com/doc/20030804/berube Written in Memory], ''The Nation.'' July 17, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Keller's teacher, [[Anne Sullivan]], had mentioned that the autumn leaves were "painted ruby, emerald, gold, crimson, and brown," and Keller, by her own account, imagined [[fairies]] doing the work. Keller wrote a story about how a cask of jewels, being transported by fairy servants, had melted in the sun and covered the leaves.&lt;ref name="upenn1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/keller/life/part-III.html#Style |title=Part III, The Story of My Life |publisher=Digital.library.upenn.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a birthday gift, Keller sent the story to [[Michael Anagnos]], head of the [[Perkins School for the Blind]], who published the story in ''The Mentor,'' the Perkins alumni magazine. It was picked up by ''[[The Goodson Gazette]]'', a journal on deaf-blind education, based in Virginia.

== Controversy ==
{{see also|Plagiarism|Cryptomnesia}}

A friend, one of the Perkins teachers informed the ''Gazette'' that Keller's story was a reproduction of "Frost Fairies",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afb.org/mylife/book.asp?ch=P3Ch5app2|title=Consecutive version of "The Frost Fairies" and "The Frost King"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Margaret Canby]]'s book ''Birdie and His Fairy Friends.''

''The Gazette'' ran both stories, and the editor commented that he believed it a deliberate attempt at [[fraud]] by Keller's handlers. Keller insisted she had no memory of having read the book or having had it read to her, but passages in her letters from the period, which she describes as "dreams", strongly resembled other episodes in the book.&lt;ref name="upenn1"/&gt;

In Sullivan's account of the incident, addressed to [[John Hitz]] of the [[Volta Laboratory and Bureau|Volta Bureau]], she had investigated to see who could have read the story to Helen or even owned a copy of the book. It seemed her own mentor, Sophia Hopkins, had taken charge of the then eight-year-old Keller while Sullivan was on vacation, and had read the book to her through [[finger spelling]]. Keller stated that she remembered nothing of this, and she was devastated that people she had loved and trusted would accuse her of lying.&lt;ref&gt;"It made us feel so bad to think that people thought we had been untrue and wicked. My heart was full of tears, for I love the beautiful truth with my whole heart and mind." From "Helen Keller's Own Statement," from her diary, dated 1892, January 30, and printed in ''[http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/keller/life/life.html#Style The Story of My Life]'' in the chapter "Literary Style."&lt;/ref&gt;

References to '''King Frost''' in popular culture include the temporal ''"The reign of King Frost had begun"'' in a 1920s dime romance novel.&lt;ref name="Clay"&gt;{{cite book |last=Clay |first=Bertha M |year=1923 |title=Thorns and Orange Blossoms |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.$b248489;view=1up;seq=5 |accessdate=2016-08-21 |location=New York |publisher=J. H. Sears &amp; Co |asin=B000GSXUDA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Anagnos was apparently willing to believe that Keller had simply adapted the story from buried memories. However, Keller further discussed the matter with one of the Perkins teachers, and as she remembered it, "something I said made her think she detected in my words a confession" that she had knowingly plagiarized the story. The teacher's own detailed account, which was only discovered in 1978 and published in Joseph Lash's ''Helen and Teacher,'' confirms that Keller told her Sullivan had read her "Frost Fairies" the previous fall and that she had adapted her own story out of that one.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Joseph P. Lash in ''Helen and Teacher'' (DaCapo, 1997), p. 136-138. He cites it as coming from the document ''Miss Sullivan's Methods,'' referenced below.&lt;/ref&gt;

By all accounts, the teacher reported what Keller had told her to Anagnos. A storm of outrage swept through the school, apparently headed by the teachers. Keller's biographers, particularly Joseph P. Lash, suggest that they were also incensed by the fact that Sullivan and Keller used the facilities although they were neither employed by nor officially registered with the school.&lt;ref&gt;Lash, Joseph P., ''Helen and Teacher.'' DaCapo, 1997, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

An in-house "trial" ensued to determine whether or not Sullivan had deliberately falsified Keller's abilities; eight teachers interrogated the twelve-year-old child for two hours and fought the issue to a draw, the tie-breaking vote being cast by Anagnos in Keller's favor. Although Sullivan protested that "all use of language is imitative, and one's style is made up of all other styles that one has met," and even Canby came forward to say that Keller's version was superior to her own,&lt;ref&gt;"What a wonderfully active and retentive mind that gifted child must have! If she had remembered and written down accurately, a short story, and that soon after hearing it, it would have been a marvel; but to have heard the story once, three years ago, and in such a way that neither her parents nor teacher could ever allude to it or refresh her memory about it, and then to have been able to reproduce it so vividly, even adding some touches of her own in perfect keeping with the rest, which really improve the original, is something that very few girls of riper age, and with every advantage of sight, hearing, and even great talents for composition, could have done as well, if at all." Margaret Canby, quoted by John A. Macy, in [http://www.afb.org/mylife/book.asp?ch=P3Ch5 Literary Style], supplemental chapter to Keller's ''Story of My Life,'' entire text online and found 2008-03-07.&lt;/ref&gt; Anagnos never regained his faith in Sullivan or Keller and described them years later as "a living lie." Keller had a [[nervous breakdown]] over the incident,{{cn|date=August 2016}} and never wrote fiction again.

In 1978, an anonymously written typescript titled "Miss Sullivan's Methods" was uncovered at the Perkins Institute library.&lt;ref name=Lash&gt;{{cite book |last=Lash |title=Helen and Teacher|first =Joseph P }}, p. 134. See also "Touching Words," by Jim Swan, in ''The Construction of authorship: textual appropriation in Law and Literature'', ed. by Martha Woodmansee, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Lash describes it as an analysis of ''The Story of My Life,'' probably written by David Prescott Hall in 1906 just after the death of Michael Anagnos. The text identifies many of Keller's letters as containing paraphrases of Canby's writing, as well as verbatim passages. Keller and Sullivan cited some of these in their own explanation of what happened, and Sullivan stated several times Keller's writings at the time contained extensive paraphrases of either what she had read or what she had ''had'' read ''to'' her. The document also contains the text of the letter written by the Perkins teacher in which she transcribed the conversation with Keller that had led to the inquiry.

Lash believes the author of the document was trying to prove Sullivan, not Hopkins, had read ''Birdie and his Fairy Friends'' to Keller, and had done so that same autumn, not four years previously. He concludes that if this was the case:

* Keller wrote "The Frost King" as another one of her paraphrased stories, similar to what she'd been writing in her letters of the period.
* Sullivan, who always checked Keller's writings before allowing them to be mailed, would have recognized "The Frost King" as a paraphrase, but considering it to be sufficiently original, passed it on as Keller's own work.
* Sullivan may not have understood what plagiarism is.
* When Keller was accused, Sullivan attempted a coverup, denying she had read the ''Birdie'' stories and impressing upon Keller the importance of stating Hopkins had read her the stories years before.

The story was later published in [[The Story of My Life (biography)|Keller's 1903 biography]] with a complete analysis of both stories and the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.worldwideschool.org/library/books/hst/biography/StoryofMyLife/chap44.html |title=Story of My Life - The Frost King |publisher=Worldwideschool.org |date= |first=Helen A. |last=Keller |accessdate=2009-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1903, [[Mark Twain]] described the controversy as "owlishly idiotic and grotesque."&lt;ref name=Twain&gt;{{cite web |last=Twain |first=Mark |authorlink=Mark Twain |title=Helen's writing |url=http://www.afb.org/section.aspx?FolderID=1&amp;SectionID=1&amp;TopicID=193&amp;SubTopicID=24&amp;DocumentID=1111|accessdate=2012-06-01 |date=March 17, 1903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Good Fruit of the Earth''' is a painting created by the [[Cyprus|Cypriot]] painter [[Loukia Nicolaidou]] between the years 1933 - 1936.

== Description ==
The painting, oil on canvas, has dimensions of 188&amp;nbsp;cm. X 140&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cyprusdigitallibrary.org.cy/items/show/614|title=Nicolaidou, Loukia (1909-1994), “The Good Fruit of the Earth - Αγαθοί Καρποί της Γης”|last=|first=|date=|website=cyprusdigitallibrary.org.cy|publisher=Ψηφιακή Πλατφόρμα Κυπριακής Βιβλιοθήκης|accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is exhibited at the State Gallery of Contemporary Cypriot Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cyprusdigitallibrary.org.cy/items/show/614|title=Nicolaidou, Loukia (1909-1994), “The Good Fruit of the Earth - Αγαθοί Καρποί της Γης”|last=|first=|date=|website=cyprusdigitallibrary.org.cy|publisher=Ψηφιακή Πλατφόρμα Κυπριακής Βιβλιοθήκης|accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
The painting was made by Lucia Nicolaidou-Vasiliou, the first woman from Cyprus to study painting abroad,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sigmalive.com/archive/simerini/news/social/403696|title=Οχτώ Κύπριες άνοιξαν το δρόμο στις υπόλοιπες|last=Σωφρονίου|first=Ελευθερία|date=23 July 2011|website=sigmalive.com|publisher=Sigma Live|accessdate=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in France. 
In this canvas she demonstrates the obvious influence of [[Paul Gauguin]] as shown in the areas of the forms, the theme and the symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cyprusdigitallibrary.org.cy/items/show/614|title=Nicolaidou, Loukia (1909-1994), “The Good Fruit of the Earth - Αγαθοί Καρποί της Γης”|last=|first=|date=|website=cyprusdigitallibrary.org.cy|publisher=Ψηφιακή Πλατφόρμα Κυπριακής Βιβλιοθήκης}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The painting stands out for its large color surfaces and for the female figures mother and daughter, symbolizing the quest for innocence,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cyprusdigitallibrary.org.cy/items/show/614|title=Nicolaidou, Loukia (1909-1994), “The Good Fruit of the Earth - Αγαθοί Καρποί της Γης”|last=|first=|date=|website=cyprusdigitallibrary.org.cy|publisher=Ψηφιακή Πλατφόρμα Κυπριακής Βιβλιοθήκης|accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while exuding a sense of sensuality absent from the corresponding women depicted in the works of other Cypriot artists of that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Η ανθρώπινη μορφή στη νεότερη Κυπριακή τέχνη: οι πρώτες γενιές|last=Δανός|first=Αντώνης|publisher=Ίδρυμα Ευαγόρα Λανίτη &amp; Κάθλην Λανίτη, Υπουργείο Παιδείας και Πολιτισμού.|year=2006|isbn=|location=Κύπρος|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Three Critics of the Enlightenment: Vico, Hamann, Herder''''' is a collection of essays in the [[history of philosophy]] by 20th century philosopher and historian of ideas [[Isaiah Berlin]]. Edited by [[Henry Hardy]] and released posthumously in 2000, the collection comprises the previously published works ''Vico and Herder: Two Studies in the History of Ideas'' (1976) – an essay on [[Counter-Enlightenment]] thinkers [[Giambattista Vico]] and [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] – and ''The Magus of the North: J. G. Hamann and the Origins of Modern Irrationalism'' (1993), concerning [[irrationalism|irrationalist]] [[Johann Georg Hamann]]. 

==Overview==
Berlin's initial interest in the critics of the Enlightenment arose through reading the works of [[Marxism|Marxist]] historian of ideas [[Georgi Plekhanov]].&lt;ref name=sep&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=berlin |title=Isaiah Berlin |first=Joshua |last=Cherniss, |first2=Henry |last2=Hardy |author2-link=Henry Hardy |date=2008-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Zeev Sternhell]] has raised questions concerning the editing of the work, pointing to Henry Hardy's replacement of Berlin's citations of secondary sources with primary sources on a number of occasions. He suggests that Hardy's editing "raises doubts as to Berlin's reading of his sources," and concludes with the following observation: "The question whether systematically omitting the secondary sources and replacing them with texts that Berlin himself did not mention, which probably means he did not read them, can be considered a legitimate procedure is highly dubious."&lt;ref name=Sternhell2010&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vico and Herder are portrayed by Berlin as alternatives to the [[rationalism|rationalistic]] epistemology which characterized the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name=Password2006&gt;{{cite journal

|quote= Suggesting in effect that it can be better to theorize boldly than to engage in circumscribed projects, Berlin characterizes the "creative imagination" and "imaginative reconstruction of forms of life" in Vico and Herder as legitimate criticisms of scientific rationalism and the Enlightenment…In theory as well as in art, imagination represents an alternative to arid rationality.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berlin held that the agenda of the Enlightenment could be understood in a number of ways, and that to view it from the perspectives of its critics (i.e. Vico, Herder and Hamann) was to bring its distinctive and controversial aspects into sharp focus.&lt;ref name=McGrath2001&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Three Critics'' was one of Berlin's many publications on the Enlightenment and its enemies that did much to popularise the concept of a Counter-Enlightenment movement that he characterised as [[Relativism|relativist]], [[Rationalism|anti-rationalist]], [[Vitalism|vitalist]] and organic,&lt;ref&gt;[[Darrin McMahon|Darrin M. McMahon]], "The Counter-Enlightenment and the Low-Life of Literature in Pre-Revolutionary France" ''Past and Present'' No. 159 (May 1998:77-112) p. 79 note 7.&lt;/ref&gt; and which he associated most closely with German [[Romanticism]].

Berlin identifies Hamann as one of the first thinkers to conceive of human [[cognition]] as [[language]] – the articulation and use of symbols. Berlin saw Hamann as having recognised as the rationalist's [[Cartesianism|Cartesian]] fallacy the notion that there are "clear and distinct" ideas "which can be contemplated by a kind of inner eye", without the use of language.&lt;ref name=Bleich2006&gt;{{cite journal

A '''transept''' (with two '''semitransepts''') is a transverse part of any building, which lies across the main body of the edifice.&lt;ref name="PE"&gt;"Transept", ProbertEncyclopaedia.com: [http://www.probertencyclopaedia.com/cgi-bin/xphrase.pl?keyword=transept PE-tran]. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025004837/http://www.probertencyclopaedia.com/cgi-bin/xphrase.pl?keyword=transept |date=2012-10-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In churches, a transept is an area set crosswise to the [[nave]] in a [[cruciform]] ("[[cross]]-shaped") building within the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[Christianity|Christian]] [[church architecture|church]] architectural traditions. Each half of a transept is known as a ''semitransept''.&lt;ref name=PE/&gt;

==Description==
The transept of a church separates the nave from the [[sanctuary]], [[apse]], [[Choir (architecture)|choir]], [[chevet]], [[presbytery (architecture)|presbytery]], or [[chancel]]. The transepts cross the nave at the [[crossing (architecture)|crossing]], which belongs equally to the main nave axis and to the transept. Upon its four [[Pier (architecture)|piers]], the crossing may support a [[spire]] (''e.g.'', [[Salisbury Cathedral]]), a central [[tower]] (''e.g.'', [[Gloucester Cathedral]]) or a crossing [[dome]] (''e.g.'', [[St Paul's Cathedral]]). Since the [[altar]] is usually located at the east end of a church, a transept extends to the north and south.  The north and south end walls often hold decorated [[window]]s of [[stained glass]], such as [[rose window]]s, in stone [[tracery]].

Occasionally, the [[basilica]]s and the church and [[cathedral]] planning that descended from them were built without transepts; sometimes the transepts were reduced to matched [[chapel]]s. More often, the transepts extended well beyond the sides of the rest of the building, forming the shape of a cross. This design is called a "Latin cross" ground plan, and these extensions are known as the '''arms''' of the transept.&lt;ref name=PE/&gt; A  "Greek cross" ground plan, with all four extensions the same length, produces a central-plan structure.

When churches have only one transept, as at [[Pershore Abbey]], there is generally a historical disaster, fire, war or funding problem, to explain the anomaly. At [[Beauvais Cathedral|Beauvais]] only the chevet and transepts stand; the nave of the cathedral was never completed after a collapse of the daring high [[Vault (architecture)|vaulting]] in 1284. At [[St. Vitus Cathedral]], [[Prague]], only the choir and part of a southern transept were completed until a renewed building campaign in the 19th century.

==Other senses of the word==
The word "transept" is occasionally extended to mean any subsidiary corridor crossing a larger main corridor, such as the cross-halls or "transepts" of [[The Crystal Palace]], London, of glass and iron that was built for the [[Great Exhibition]] of 1851. 

In a [[metro station]] or similar construction, a transept is a space over the [[railway platform|platforms]] and [[rail tracks|tracks]] of a station with side platforms, containing the [[bridge]] between the platforms. Placing the bridge in a transept rather than an enclosed [[tunnel]] allows passengers to see the platforms, creating a less cramped feeling and making orientation easier.

'''''Two Girls in the Snow''''' is an 1894 oil on canvas painting by the Dutch artist [[Isaac Israels]]. It was bought from the artist in 1904 for the private Drake-Fraser collection in London, which lent it to the [[Rijksmuseum]] in Amsterdam in 1917. It was then bought by the museum in 1944.

[[File:Flag of Ulster.svg|thumb|right|Traditional [[Flag of Ulster]]]]

The [[Coat of Arms of Northern Ireland|arms]] and flag were designed in Dublin by [[Ulster]] King of Arms Neville-Rodwell Wilkinson in 1923–1924. The flag is based on [[Flag of Ulster|the flag of the traditional province of Ulster]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/gb-ni.html#hist CRW Flags of the World – Northern Ireland (United Kingdom)]&lt;/ref&gt; including a [[Red Hand of Ulster]] in the centre, and the red [[House of Burke|de Burgh]] cross&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/gb-ni.html#uj CRW Flags – Northern Ireland (United Kingdom)]&lt;/ref&gt; (though some claim this is the [[Saint George's Cross]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/images/symbols/flags.htm CAIN: Symbols – Flags Used in Northern Ireland&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;). It has the addition of a crown to represent the [[monarchy of the United Kingdom]]. Rather than a shield, the Red Hand is inside a six pointed star, representing the six [[Counties of Ireland|counties]] that make up [[Northern Ireland]]. It is [[blazon]]ed: ''"Argent a cross gules, overall on a six pointed star of the field ensigned by an Imperial crown proper a dexter hand couped at the wrist of the second"''.

The flag is also sometimes called the '''Ulster flag''',&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60713-0954.htm Lords Hansard text for 13 Jul 200613 July 2006 (pt 0947)]&lt;/ref&gt; '''Northern Ireland flag''', the '''(old) Stormont flag''', or the '''Red Hand of Ulster flag'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.limavady.gov.uk/filestore/documents/good_relations/Web_Questionnaire.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030185054/http://www.limavady.gov.uk/filestore/documents/good_relations/Web_Questionnaire.pdf |archivedate=30 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Loyalists often use 'Ulster' as another name for Northern Ireland, and [[Stormont Estate|Stormont]] was the seat of Northern Ireland's government.

==History==

===Use by the Government of Northern Ireland===
In 1924, the [[Government of Northern Ireland]] was granted [[Coat of arms of Northern Ireland|its own coat of arms]] by [[Royal warrant (document)|Royal Warrant]] and had the right to display these arms on a [[Heraldic flag|flag or banner]]. This right was exercised for the [[Coronation of the British monarch|Coronation]] of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1953. From 1953 until 1972, the flag was used officially by the Government of Northern Ireland and also as a ''de facto'' civic [[Flag of Northern Ireland|flag for Northern Ireland]]. In 1972, the Government and [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|Parliament]] of Northern Ireland were abolished by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] under the [[Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973]].

===Later use===
Since the Government of Northern Ireland was abolished in 1972, the flag (and variations thereof) has continued to be used by [[Unionism in Ireland|unionists]]. In 2004, [[Belfast City Council]] commissioned a study on the flying of flags which noted that the Ulster Banner continued to be flown, alongside the [[Flag of the United Kingdom|Union flag]], by three unionist-controlled [[local government in Northern Ireland|local authorities]] in Northern Ireland: [[Ards (borough)|Ards Borough Council]], [[Carrickfergus Borough Council]] and [[Castlereagh (borough)|Castlereagh Borough Council]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.belfastcity.gov.uk/equality/docs/FlyingOfUnionFlagEQIA.pdf  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326225420/http://www.belfastcity.gov.uk/equality/docs/FlyingOfUnionFlagEQIA.pdf |date=26 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''U.S. Army Art Program''' or '''United States Army Combat Art Program''' is a program brought about by the [[United States Army]] to create artwork documenting the U.S. Army in war and peacetime engagement. The art collection associated with the program is held by the [[United States Army Center of Military History]].

==History==
[[File:On Guard at Sunset.jpg|''On Guard at Sunset'' by SFC Peter G. Varisano, a painting made for the United States Army Collection|thumb]]
The Army's official interest in art originated in [[World War I]] when eight [[American official war artists|artists]] (see the list at [[Template:AEF artist|AEF artists]]) were commissioned as captains in the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Corps of Engineers]] and were sent to Europe to record the activities of the [[American Expeditionary Forces]]. At the end of the war most of the team's artwork went to the [[Smithsonian Institution]], which at that time was the custodian of Army historical property and art.

There was no Army program for acquiring art during the interwar years, but with the advent of World War II the Corps of Engineers, drawing on its World War I experience, established a War Art Unit in early 1943.&lt;ref&gt;See also Harrington, Peter. ’The 1943 War Art Program’, ''Army History'' No. 55 (Spring-Summer 2002), 4-19.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Associated American Artists]] helped the Army recruit artists and the War department established a War Art Advisory Committee, a select group of civilian art experts, who selected artists to work in the program.&lt;ref name = mcnoughten&gt;{{cite book| title = A Guide to the Stude and Use of Military History| chapterurl = http://www.cgsc.edu/carl/download/csipubs/jessup/jessup_ch14.pdf| chapter =The Army Art Program| first = Marian R. | last = McNoughten}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the spring of 1943 the committee had selected 42 artists: 23 active duty military and 19 civilians. These artists included [[Reginald Marsh (artist)|Reginald Marsh]], [[Jack Levine]], [[Joe Jones (artist)|Joe Jones]], [[Mitchell Siporin]], [[Aaron Bohrod]], and [[Henry Vernum Poor]].&lt;ref name = mcnoughten/&gt; The first artists were sent to the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II]], but in May 1943 Congress withdrew funding from the program and the War Art Unit was inactivated. The Army assigned the military artists to other units and released the civilians.

The effort to create a visual record of the American military experience in World War II was then taken up by the private sector in two different programs, one by ''[[Life magazine]]'' and one by [[Abbott Laboratories]], a large medical supply company. When ''Life'' offered to employ civilian artists as war correspondents, the War Department agreed to provide them the same support already being given to print and film correspondents. Seventeen of nineteen civilians artists who had been selected by the War Art Committee joined ''Life'' as war correspondents. A deal was struck between, then editor of ''Life'', [[Daniel Longwell]] and the Secretary of War for the artists to receive the same treatment as news correspondents.&lt;ref name = mcnoughten/&gt; Abbott, in coordination with the Army's [[Office of the Surgeon General]], commissioned twelve artists to record the work of the [[Medical Corps (United States Army)|Army Medical Corps]]. These two programs resulted in a wide range of work by distinguished artists, such as [[The Farm Is a Battleground, Too#Combat Art|John Steuart Curry]],&lt;ref&gt;James M. Myers, "CAMP BARKELEY," Handbook of Texas Online (http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/qbc02), Uploaded on June 12, 2010. Published by the Texas State Historical Association.&lt;/ref&gt; who had the opportunity to observe the war firsthand.

By the end of World War II the Army had acquired over 2,000 pieces of art. In June 1945 the Army established a Historical Properties Section to maintain and exhibit this collection, thus creating the nucleus of today's Army art Collection. On 7 December 1960, ''Life'' also presented 1,050 works by its own correspondents to the Defense Department, many which the Army later received. In 1947, the Army Art program also assumed custody of 8,000 German war art, created by similar Nazi programs,&lt;ref name = mcnoughten/&gt; including four architectural renderings by [[Adolf Hitler]].

===Official Army Art Program===
War art continued through subsequent wars, including the [[Korean War]], [[Vietnam War]], [[Desert Storm]]/[[Operation Desert Shield (Gulf War)|Desert Shield]] and the [[Global War on Terrorism]] as well as other operations by the Army. Although no official artists were forwarded to Korea by the Army, nine combat artists teams operated in Vietnam from 1966–1970 as part of the U.S. Army [[Vietnam Combat Artists Program]]. The Chief of Military History, developed the Army Art Program as it is today, with specialized training for both civilian and military artists who went into the field as complete units.&lt;ref name = ncc&gt;{{cite web| title = THE U.S. ARMY ART PROGRAM: A HISTORY| publisher=National Constitution Center| url = http://www.constitutioncenter.org/Files/AS_arthistory.pdf| accessdate =29 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2010|11}}, the Army Art collection comprises over 15,500 works of art from over 1,300 artists. The Army Staff Artist Program was assigned to the [[United States Army Center of Military History]], Museum Division in 1992 and where it has been established as a permanent part of the Museum Division's Collections Branch.

==Public showings==
In September 2010 the [[National Constitution Center]] in Philadelphia, PA will host an exhibit entitled "Art of the American Soldier" featuring more than 300 works from the army art collection, one of the first times that the Army Art from the Army Art Program has been put on display en masse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.constitutioncenter.org/ncc_press_Art_of_the_American_Soldier.aspx| title = Art of the American Soldier| publisher = [[National Constitution Center]]| accessdate = 29 June 2010| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100612202323/http://constitutioncenter.org/ncc_press_Art_of_the_American_Soldier.aspx| archive-date = 12 June 2010| dead-url = yes| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update after|2010|09}} In addition to the 300 works, soldier/artists were also given the opportunity to submit works to be part of digital kiosks at the exhibit. The exhibit was designed to contain highly realistic works, such as those of U.S. Army artist, Master Sergeant Martin Cervantez. Cervantez commented on his pieces on display in Reuters on the nature of the exhibit "If a soldier takes his family to the museum, I want them to be able to say, 'That's what it was like.'"&lt;ref name = reut&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE66I3AF20100719| title = U.S. Army unveils a trove of soldiers' war paintings| first =  Jon| last = Hurdle | date = 19 July 2010|agency=Reuters  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Velificatio''''' is a stylistic device used in [[Roman art|ancient Roman art]] to frame a [[List of Roman deities|deity]] by means of a billowing garment. It represents "vigorous movement," an [[theophany|epiphany]],&lt;ref&gt;Paul Rehak, ''Imperium and Cosmos: Augustus and the Northern Campus Martius'' (University of Wisconsin Press, 2006), p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; or "the vault of heaven," often appearing with celestial, weather, or sea deities.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Turcan, ''Les religions de l'Asie dans la vallée du Rhône'' (Brill, 1972), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; It is characteristic of the [[iconography]] of the [[Aura (mythology)|Aurae]], the Breezes [[personification|personified]], and one of the elements which distinguish representations of Luna, the Roman [[Moon goddess|goddess of the Moon]], alluding to her astral course.&lt;ref&gt;Stefania Sorrenti, "Les représentations figurées de Jupiter Dolichénien à Rome," in ''La terra sigillata tardo-italica decorata del Museo nazionale romano'', «L'Erma» di Bretschneider, 1999), p. 370.&lt;/ref&gt;

A figure so framed is a '''''velificans''''' (plural '''''velificantes'''''). Not all deities are portrayed as ''velificantes'', but the device might be used to mark a member of the [[Roman Emperor|Imperial family]] who had been divinized (a [[Divus|''divus'' or ''diva'']]).&lt;ref&gt;Lise Vogel, ''The Column of Antoninus Pius'' (Harvard University Press, 1973), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Velificatio'' is a frequent device in Roman art,&lt;ref&gt;Hélène Walter, ''La Porte Noire de Besançon'' (Presses Univ. Franche-Comté, 1984), vol. 1, p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt; including painting, [[mosaic]], [[relief]], and [[Roman sculpture|sculpture]], though it poses technical difficulties for freestanding sculpture. The Athenian sculptor [[Praxiteles]] was able to achieve it.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Natural History'' 36.29; Davide Stimilli, ''The Face of Immortality: Physiognomy and Criticism'' (State University of New York Press, 2005), p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also used to describe [[Hellenistic art]].&lt;ref&gt;Brunilde Sismondo Ridgway, ''Hellenistic Sculpture II: The Styles of ca. 200–100 B.C.'' (University of Wisconsin Press, 2000), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Y6Jj6rcIup4C&amp;pg=PA124&amp;dq=velificatio+OR+velificantes+OR+velificans&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=c5ZJTYfmBIKClAez4ZXYDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=velificatio%20OR%20velificantes%20OR%20velificans&amp;f=false passim.]''&lt;/ref&gt; The device continued to be used in later [[Western art history|Western art]], in which it is sometimes described as an ''aura'', "a breeze that blows from either without or from within that lifts the veil to reveal the face of an otherwise invisible being."&lt;ref&gt;The term is so used in the art criticism of [[Walter Benjamin]]; Aleida Assmann and Jan Assmann, "Air From Other Planets Blowing: The Logic of Authenticity and the Prophet of the Aura," in ''Mapping Benjamin: The Work of Art in the Digital Age'' (Stanford University Press, 2003), pp. 153–154.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage and examples==
In [[classical Latin]], the [[abstract noun]] ''velificatio'' is uncommon,&lt;ref&gt;It occurs in [[Cicero]], ''Ad familiares'' 1.9.21, and not again in Latin literature until Fronto, 267,4–5; Michel P.J. van den Hout, ''A Commentary on the Letters of M. Cornelius Fronto'' (Brill, 1999), p. 608.&lt;/ref&gt; and refers to the act of setting sail, from ''velum'', "sail" (but also "cloth, garment, veil") and the ''-fic-'' combining element from ''-ficio, -ficere'' (= ''facio, facere'', "do, make"). The verbal form was the basis for modern scholarly usage. [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] describes ''[[Aura (mythology)|Aurae]] velificantes sua veste'', the Breezes "making a sail with their own garment"&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], ''Natural History'' 36.29.&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Porticus Octaviae]] ("[[Portico]] of [[Octavia the Younger|Octavia]]").&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Köves-Zulauf, "Plinius d. Ä. und die römische Religion," ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' II.16.1 (1978), p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt; Such depictions of the Aurae are known from extant Roman art, and have been used as comparative material to identify the pair of ''velificantes'' in a scene from the [[Ara Pacis|Augustan Altar of Peace]]. On the basis of a passage from the ''[[Carmen Saeculare]]'' of [[Horace]], composed and performed for [[Augustus]]'s staging of the [[Saecular Games]] in 17 BC, the central figure is often identified as Tellus (Earth):

&lt;blockquote&gt;Fertile in produce and cattle, let Tellus grant Ceres a crown of grain; let the healthful waters and breezes of Jove nourish offspring.&lt;ref&gt;''Fertilis frugum pecorisque Tellus / spicea donet Cererem corona; / nutriant fetus et aquae salubres / et Iovis aurae''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Not all scholars agree on this analysis of the scene. The creatures on which the ''velificantes'' are seated also suggest [[Nereids]], and the reference may point to the [[Cult of the Nymphs]].&lt;ref&gt;Babette Stanley Spaeth, "The Goddess Ceres in the Ara Pacis Augustae and the Carthage Relief," ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 98 (1994), pp. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

The significance of the veil is sometimes explained in terms of the [[initiation rite]]s of the [[mystery religions]]. Initiates wore drapery or a veil which was lifted by a priestess. The veil was a symbol of death, and its removal in the rite signified the initiate's rebirth. The ''velificatio'' thus appears in scenes on [[sarcophagi]] and in other [[funerary art]].&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Matelli, "Hieronymous in Athens and Rhodes", in ''Lyco of Troas and Hieronymous of Rhodes'' (Transaction Publishers, 2004), pp. 294–295.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vue_de_Grottaferrata_avec_Vénus_et_Adonis-_Poussin_-Montpellier.jpg|thumb]]
'''''Venus and Adonis''''' or '''''View of Grottaferrata with Venus, Adonis and a River Divinity''''' is a c.1626 painting by [[Nicolas Poussin]], now in the [[Musée Fabre]] in Montpellier.

It was cut in two in the 18th century, with the larger right-hand part entering the [[Musée Fabre]]. The left part ended up with the Patti Birch Trust by 1991, on long-term loan to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. Both halves were displayed together at the Metropolitan and then the Musée Fabre in 2008. At the end of 2009 the Montpellier Agglomération (guardian of the Musée Fabre) used two private donations to purchase the right part and reunite the painting. The complete painting was then exhibited at ''Nature et idéal : Le paysage à Rome 1600-1650'', a 2011 exhibition in the [[Grand Palais]] in Paris.

The [[white savior]] is a [[trope (cinema)|cinematic trope]] in which a [[white people|white]] character rescues [[person of color|people of color]] from their plight.&lt;ref name="temple1" /&gt; Certain critics have observed this narrative in an array of genres of films in [[Cinema of the United States|American cinema]], wherein a white protagonist is portrayed as a [[Messiah|messianic figure]] who often learns something about him or herself in the course of rescuing characters of color.&lt;ref name="temple1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sturges"&gt;{{cite book | first1=Kysa |last1=Nygreen | first2=Barbara| last2=Madeloni| first3=Jennifer | last3=Cannon |title=Neoliberalizing Educational Reform: America's Quest for Profitable Market-Colonies and the Undoing of Public Good |chapter='Boot Camp' Teacher Certification and Neoliberal Education Reform | editor-last=Sturges | editor-first=Keith M. | publisher=Springer Publishing | location=New York City|date=2015|page=116 | isbn=978-94-6209-975-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The narrative [[Trope (literature)|trope]] of the white savior is one way the mass communications medium of cinema represents the [[sociology of race and ethnic relations]], by presenting abstract concepts—such as [[morality]]—as innate characteristics, racial and cultural, of white people, rather than as characteristics innate to people of color.&lt;ref name="temple2" /&gt; The white savior usually is a man who is out of place within his own society, until he assumes the [[The White Man's Burden|burden of racial leadership]] to rescue non-white foreigners and minorities from their plights. As such, white savior stories "are essentially grandiose, exhibitionistic, and narcissistic" fantasies of psychological [[Compensation (psychology)|compensation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Hernán|last1=Vera|first2=Andrew M.|last2=Gordon|title=Screen Saviors: Hollywood Fictions of Whiteness|publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers]]|location=Lanham, Maryland|date=2003|ISBN=978-0847699476|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "The Whiteness of Oscar Night" (2015), [[Matthew Hughey]] describes the narrative structure of the subgenre:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A White Savior film is often based on some supposedly true story. Second, it features a nonwhite group or person who experiences conflict and struggle with others that is particularly dangerous or threatening to their life and livelihood. Third, a White person (the savior) enters the milieu and through their sacrifices, as a teacher, mentor, lawyer, military hero, aspiring writer, or wannabe Native American warrior, is able to physically save—or at least morally redeem—the person or community of folks of color, by the film's end. Examples of this genre include films like ''[[Glory (1989 film)|Glory]]'' (1989), ''[[Dangerous Minds]]'' (1996), ''[[Amistad (film)|Amistad]]'' (1997), ''[[Finding Forrester]]'' (2000), ''[[The Last Samurai]]'' (2003), ''[[Half Nelson (film)|Half Nelson]]'' (2006), ''[[Freedom Writers]]'' (2007), ''[[Gran Torino]]'' (2008), ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' (2009), ''[[The Blind Side (film)|The Blind Side]]'' (2009), ''[[The Help (film)|The Help]]'' (2011), and the list goes on.&lt;ref name=Hughey2015&gt;{{cite web|first=Matthew W.|last=Hughey |authorlink = Matthew Hughey|url=https://contexts.org/blog/the-whiteness-of-oscar-night/ |title=The Whiteness of Oscar Night |website=Contexts |date=January 19, 2015 |accessdate=July 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the release of cinematic adaptations of the play ''[[A Raisin in the Sun]]'' (1959), by [[Lorraine Hansberry]], and the novel ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'' (1960), by [[Harper Lee]], the films of the [[blaxploitation]] genre of the 1970s reflected continued discontent over the social and racial inequality of non-white people in the United States and functioned as counterbalance to the trope of the white savior. Then in the 1980s, continued cultural [[hypersegregation]] led to the common misbelief, by many American white people, that the nation had reached a post-racial state of social relations, which resulted in a backlash against the racial and ethnic diversity of the cinema of the previous decades, on screen during the 1960s and the 1970s; thus, the popular cinema of the 1990s and the early 2000s featured the white savior narrative. That reappearance of the white-savior narrative occurred because the majority of white people in the United States had little substantive social interaction with people of different races and ethnic groups.&lt;ref name="temple1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Philip S. S.|last1=Howard|first2=George J. Sefa|last2=Dei|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rX4Gp55jacMC&amp;pg=PA176&amp;dq=white+savior+nonwhites+real+life&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjAscDh1MvaAhXNzlkKHRSeC4wQ6AEIKTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=white+savior+nonwhites+real+life&amp;f=true|title=Crash Politics and Antiracism: Interrogations of Liberal Race Discourse|date=27 May 2018|publisher=Peter Lang|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of story==

=== Inspirational teacher  ===

The white-savior teacher story, such as ''[[Up the Down Staircase (film)|Up the Down Staircase]]'' (1967), ''[[Dangerous Minds]]'' (1995), and ''[[Freedom Writers]]'' (2007), "features a group of lower-class, urban, non-whites (generally black and Latino/a) who struggle through the social order in general, or the educational system specifically. Yet, through the sacrifices of a white teacher they are transformed, saved, and redeemed by the film's end."&lt;ref name="hughey2010" /&gt; As an inspirational tale of the human spirit, the storyline of the white-savior-teacher is not racist, in itself, but is culturally problematic for being [[racialist]], because it is a variant of the white-savior narrative that factually misrepresents the cultural and societal reality that there exist minority-group teachers who have been successfully educating (racial, ethnic, cultural) minority-group students in their communities, without the saving stewardship of white people.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald"&gt;{{cite book |first=Kathleen| last=Fitzgerald | title=Recognizing Race and Ethnicity: Power, Privilege, and Inequality | publisher=Westview Press | location=Boulder, Colorado|date=2014|page=364 | isbn=978-0-8133-4931-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Man of principle  ===
The white savior's principled opposition to [[chattel slavery]] and to [[Jim Crow laws]] makes him advocate for the humanity of slaves and defender of the rights of black people unable to independently stand within an [[institutional racism|institutionally racist]] society, in films such as ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird (film)|To Kill a Mockingbird]]'' (1962), ''[[Conrack]]'' (1974), and ''[[Amistad (film)|Amistad]]'' (1997). Despite ostensibly being stories (fictional and true) about the racist oppression of black people, usually in the [[Southern United States]] (American South), the white-savior narrative relegates characters of color to the story's background, as the passive object(s) of the dramatic action, and in the foreground places the white man who militates to save him, and them, from the depredations of racist white folk, respectively: a false accusation of inter-racial rape, truncated schooling, and chattel slavery.&lt;ref name="vera32_33" /&gt;&lt;ref name="berlatsky" /&gt;

''[[The Atlantic]]''{{'}}s Berlatsky said the denouement's use of the white savior, while historically accurate, was unnecessary, "As it is, in the context of Hollywood, Northup's stunned/numb gratitude at the end of the film tends to blur into a montage of other teary-eyed black actors gazing with awe and wonder at the surprising, over-determined nobility of some white actor or other."&lt;ref name="berlatsky" /&gt;

Film critic [[Ann Hornaday]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' said, "[Director] Ross has insisted that he didn't want 'Free State of Jones' to become another white savior movie, but that's precisely what it is, especially during scenes when the murderous injustice of slavery is refracted through Knight’s frustrated tears."

Newkirk II said, "To say that McConaughey's portrayal of Newton Knight is a white savior perhaps undersells the trope...

''[[The New York Times]]'' film critic [[A. O.
