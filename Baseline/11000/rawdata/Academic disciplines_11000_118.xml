The '''angular momentum problem''' is a problem in astrophysics identified by [[Leon Mestel]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://academic.oup.com/astrogeo/article/53/5/5.19/208905/Losing-spin-the-angular-momentum-problem|title=Losing spin: the angular momentum problem|last=Ray|first=Tom|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|access-date=12 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was found that the angular momentum of a [[protoplanetary disk]] is misappropriated when compared to models during stellar birth. The [[Sun]] and other stars are predicted by models to be rotating considerably faster than they actually are. The Sun, for example, only accounts for about 0.3 percent of the total angular momentum of the [[Solar System]] while about 60% is attributed to [[Jupiter]].

{{italictitle}}
'''''Antidosis''''' ([[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀντίδοσις}}), is the title of a speech treatise by the ancient Greek [[rhetoric]]ian, [[Isocrates]].  The ''Antidosis'' can be viewed as a defense, an [[autobiography]], or rhetorical treatise. However, since Isocrates wrote it when he was 82 years old, it is generally seen by some people as an autobiography.  The title literally translates as “an exchange,” and was applied in ancient [[Greece|Greek]] courts as a peculiar law pertaining to an exchange of estates between two parties.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.stoa.org/projects/demos/article_law_glossary?page=5&amp;greekEncoding= ''Antidosis'' as an Ancient Athenian legal term]&lt;/ref&gt;  If one of the 1200 wealthiest Athenians eligible was tasked with the performance of a public liturgy and financing one of the many public concerns of [[Athens]], then he could avoid the duty by nominating a richer man who was more qualified than himself to perform it.  If the supposedly richer man disagreed with the terms, then the entirety of their estates would be exchanged and the now more wealthy man would have to perform the [[liturgy]], as originally planned.  The law inspired Isocrates' ''Antidosis'', which was written in the form of a [[Legal case|court case]] where Isocrates had to defend himself from a charge of corrupting the youth by teaching them how to speak well in order for them to gain an unfair advantage over their peers.  Although this work is put forward by Isocrates as his imagined defense in a legal case, it is more a treatise on [[morality]] and teaching.

== As a Court Case ==
Although it is assumed that he is defending himself from a charge of corrupting the youth, nowhere in his Antidosis does Isocrates mention what [[crime]] he is charged with and from which he must defend, nor does it say what the penalty would be for being found guilty.  Isocrates also does not make any attempt to offer evidence in his favor, yet presents the defense that he is a good [[teacher]] to his students as the full defense for the crime that he has committed.  There is no specific mention of anything that would prove him innocent in this particular case.

Another idea by scholars is that early on in the ''Antidosis'', Isocrates reads aloud that he is being indicted for corrupting his students.  He is accused of educating his students to speak against the courts, question the laws, and think for themselves.  Isocrates says, “Here is the indictment my accuser endeavors to vilify me, charging that I corrupt young men by teaching them to speak and gain their won advantage in the courts contrary to justice…”&lt;ref&gt;Isocrates. The Antidosis. Harvard: Harvard UP, 1929. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Isocrates is being charged by Lysimachus who has accused Isocrates of receiving money from his students.  In return, Isocrates has been teaching them how to become better public speakers and leaders.  Isocrates proves his innocence by showing, that through teaching his students rhetoric, he is teaching them how to become better citizens and leaders of Athens.  Isocrates proved his rationale by citing the accomplishments and devotion to the state his students displayed after being educated by him.  Isocrates says in his defense, “But, I beg of you, consider well whether I appear to you to corrupt the young by my words, or, on the contrary, to inspire them to a life of valor and of dangers endured for their country…”&lt;ref&gt;Isocrates. The Antidosis. Harvard: Harvard UP, 1929. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  B. Keith Murphy says of Isocrates’s defense, “For Isocrates, it is through rhetoric that we can approximate truth, or at least a consensual truth. A man who is trained in rhetoric is trained in truth, and the creation of that truth through oratory.”&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, B. Keith. "Isocrates." Salem Press, 1998. Web. 29 Apr 2011. &lt;http://www.keithmurphy.info/399/Isoc.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the sense that he is defending himself from an onerous charge to perform a liturgy, Isocrates makes a claim that his value to the city was provided through his teaching.  He states that as a lifelong teacher, the value of the [[education]] that he has provided for students is worth far more than any monetary donation he can give to Athens.  His teaching has provided for civic-minded and properly educated [[Citizenship|citizen]]s that contribute to the orderly running of the city-state.  For Isocrates to be sentenced to death would be to ignore the public service that he has performed for the city, by which he has devoted his life to giving its citizens a proper rhetorical education.

== As an Autobiography ==
Isocrates was 82 years old at the time he wrote ''Antidosis'', the longest work of his life.  Antidosis is used by the author to depict himself as a model citizen and a contributor to the city-state of Athens.  Since he was nearing the end of his life, he presumably would have wanted to leave behind a legacy of a devoted and moderate citizen to his home town and to justify his life as a service to Athens and the citizens to whom he taught rhetoric.  Isocrates presents himself as a quiet citizen who avoids the public light, where [[Public speaking|oratory]] is used in a way to bring many different cases of [[Lawsuit|litigation]] against each other - which the elite believed to negatively affect the way in which the [[republic]] was run.  He tries to withdraw himself from the public interfering and intrusive efforts made into [[Democracy|democratic]] politics.

The ''Antidosis'' is not seen by some as an autobiography of Isocrates; it was written later in his life as a fictionalized story similar to his own court trial.  While there are similarities between Isocrates’s real court case and the one in the ''Antidosis'', many aspects of the case were fictionalized.  Examples are Lysimachus being the person who has brought Isocrates to trial for this crime, and the crime being different from the one with which he was actually accused.  According to George Norlin, “At any rate, in the ''Antidosis''-a title which he borrows from the actual suit to which he had just been subjected-he adopts the fiction of a capital charge brought against him by an informer named Lysimachus, and of a trial before a court with its accessories.”&lt;ref&gt;Norlin, George. The Antidosis. Harvard: Harvard UP, 1929. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  

It is known that in his own life Isocrates did in fact go to court in his own defense over an amount of money he was made to pay.  Isocrates argued this fine was based on the fact people thought he was wealthier than he actually was.  He claimed this distorted perception of his wealth was due to his popularity as a public figure.  This is similar to Isocrates’s defense in the ''Antidosis'' in which he claims he has been indicted due to the fact he is a very successful person, people are jealous of him, and people want to publicly embarrass him.  In the ''Antidosis'', Isocrates is charged with corrupting the youth by teaching them to become good public speakers.  With this ability, the students may trick people by convincing them of false truths which could ultimately allow the students to corrupt the government.  This is an obvious defense of his life’s work of teaching.

==As a Rhetorical Treatise==
Isocrates states that the teacher should be judged by his students, in that if they do good and moral works then the teacher has done a good job and should be [[praise]]d.  This directly opposes [[Gorgias]]’ view that it is not up to him how his students use what he teaches them.  

At the end of his Antidosis, Isocrates explains how he attempts to keep his students in high moral standing by discouraging some of the more debaucherous behaviors available in the city, such as “participating in drinking-bouts and [[Gambling|tossing dice]] in gambling dens.”  He posits the idea that as a teacher, he can be judged as successful by the moral ways in which his students live their lives when compared to other young men who are wasting their youth in revelry. Hence he agrees to submit to the punishment if any of his students can be shown to be bad influences on [[society]] and challenges his accuser to present even one student who could be said to belong to the group of degenerate youth.

Another important topic is natural talent. Isocrates argues that native ability is necessary for becoming a good orator, along with a proper education on the subject and practical experience.

==Commentary==
D. S. Hutchinson and Monte Johnson (2010) pointed out&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.protrepticus.info/2011/06/antidosis-and-protrepticus.html|title=Antidosis and Protrepticus|year=2011|authors=D. S. Hutchinson and Monte Ransome Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Aristotle’s Protrepticus was written in the late 350s in polemical response to a work by the Athenian philosopher and teacher Isocrates called the Antidosis. In this work, Isocrates contested the application of the word philosophy to the kind of abstract and speculative mathematical preoccupations current in Plato’s Academy. For him, education and philosophy meant training men to become effective political leaders, and the means to this was training in rhetoric. Speculation about advanced mathematics, astronomy, and the “elements” or “principles” of nature were useful as “mental gymnastic” for the young but, according to the argument, in adulthood become distractions from the important business of military, political, and legal action. In the Protrepticus, Aristotle responded to Isocrates’ attack on Academic philosophy by defending the search for the elements and principles of nature as the best means not only for political science, but for every other goal in life as well.''

[[Image:Argonne aerial.jpg|thumb|200px|Aerial view of Argonne National Laboratory]]

'''Argonne National Laboratory''' is a science and engineering research [[United States Department of Energy National Labs|national laboratory]] operated by the [[University of Chicago]] Argonne LLC for the [[United States Department of Energy]] located near [[Lemont, Illinois]], outside [[Chicago]]. It is the largest national laboratory by size and scope in the [[Midwest]].

Argonne was initially formed to carry out [[Enrico Fermi]]'s work on [[nuclear reactor]]s as part of the [[Manhattan Project]], and it was designated as the first national laboratory in the United States on July 1, 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Holl, Hewlett, and Harris, page xx (Introduction).&lt;/ref&gt; In the post-war era the lab focused primarily on non-weapon related nuclear physics, designing and building the first power-producing nuclear reactors, helping design the reactors used by the US's [[nuclear navy]], and a wide variety of similar projects. In 1994 the lab's nuclear mission ended, and today it maintains a broad portfolio in basic science research, energy storage and [[renewable energy]], environmental [[sustainability]], [[Supercomputer|supercomputing]], and [[national security]].

UChicago Argonne, LLC, the operator of the laboratory, "brings together the expertise of the [[University of Chicago]] (the sole member of the LLC) with [[Jacobs Engineering Group|Jacobs Engineering Group Inc]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uchicagoargonnellc.org/ |title=World-class Scientific Research &amp; Innovation |publisher=UChicago Argonne, LLC |date= |accessdate=2012-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Argonne is a part of the expanding [[Illinois Technology and Research Corridor]]. Argonne formerly ran a smaller facility called Argonne National Laboratory-West (or simply Argonne-West) in Idaho next to the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory. In 2005, the two Idaho-based laboratories merged to become the [[Idaho National Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.postregister.com/special/siteofimpact/story.php?accession=1001-01272008|work = Post Register|location = Idaho Falls, ID|title = Cleaning house and charting a future at INL|last = Menser|first = Paul|publisher = |accessdate = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131113020138/http://www.postregister.com/special/siteofimpact/story.php?accession=1001-01272008|archivedate = 2013-11-13|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Argonne has five main areas of focus. These goals, as stated by the [[United States Department of Energy|DOE]] in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Argonne National Laboratory|publisher=U.S. Department of Energy|url=http://humansubjects.energy.gov/labs/argonne.htm|accessdate=2009-12-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527095748/http://humansubjects.energy.gov/labs/argonne.htm|archivedate=2010-05-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; consist of:

* Conducting [[Basic research|basic scientific research]];
* Operating national scientific facilities;
* Enhancing the nation's energy resources;
* Developing better ways to manage environmental problems;
* Protecting national security.

==History==
[[Image:ZGS preaccelerator.png|thumb|200px|[[Albert Crewe]] (right), Argonne's third director, stands next to the [[Zero Gradient Synchrotron]]'s [[Cockcroft-Walton generator]].]]
Argonne began in 1942 as the "[[Metallurgical Laboratory]]" at the [[University of Chicago]], which became part of the [[Manhattan Project]]. The Met Lab built [[Chicago Pile-1]], the world's first [[nuclear reactor]], under the stands of a University of Chicago sports stadium. Considered unsafe, in 1943, CP-1 was reconstructed as CP-2, in what is today known as [[Red Gate Woods]] but was then the Argonne Forest of the Cook County Forest Preserve District near [[Palos Hills, Illinois|Palos Hills]]. The lab was named after the surrounding Argonne Forest, which in turn was named after the [[Forest of Argonne]] in [[France]] where U.S. troops fought in [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anl.gov/about-argonne/history|title=Argonne: History|publisher=Argonne National Laboratory|accessdate=12 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fermi's pile was originally going to be constructed in the Argonne forest, and construction plans were set in motion, but a labor dispute brought the project to a halt. Since speed was paramount, the project was moved to the squash court under [[Stagg Field]], the football field on the campus of the University of Chicago. Fermi told them that he was sure of his calculations, which said that it would not lead to a runaway reaction, which would have contaminated the city.

Other activities were added to Argonne over the next five years. On July 1, 1946, the "Metallurgical Laboratory" was formally re-chartered as Argonne National Laboratory for "cooperative research in nucleonics." At the request of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|U.S. Atomic Energy Commission]], it began developing nuclear reactors for the nation's peaceful nuclear energy program. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, the laboratory moved to a larger location in unincorporated [[DuPage County, Illinois]] and established a remote location in [[Idaho]], called "Argonne-West," to conduct further nuclear research.

In quick succession, the laboratory designed and built [[Chicago Pile 3]] (1944), the world's first [[heavy water reactor|heavy-water moderated reactor]], and the [[Experimental Breeder Reactor I]] (Chicago Pile 4), built in Idaho, which lit a string of four light bulbs with the world's first nuclear-generated electricity in 1951. A complete list of the reactors designed and, in most cases, built and operated by Argonne can be viewed in the, "[http://www.ne.anl.gov/About/ANL-Reactors.html Reactors Designed by Argonne]" page. The knowledge gained from the Argonne experiments conducted with these reactors 1) formed the foundation for the designs of most of the commercial reactors currently used throughout the world for electric power generation and 2) inform the current evolving designs of liquid-metal reactors for future commercial power stations.

Conducting classified research, the laboratory was heavily secured; all employees and visitors needed badges to pass a checkpoint, many of the buildings were classified, and the laboratory itself was fenced and guarded. Such alluring secrecy drew visitors both authorized—including [[Leopold III of Belgium|King Leopold III of Belgium]] and [[Frederica of Hanover|Queen Frederica of Greece]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Argonne Highlights: 1950–1959 |publisher = Argonne National Laboratory |url = http://www.anl.gov/Science_and_Technology/History/fifties.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;—and unauthorized. Shortly past 1 a.m. on February 6, 1951, Argonne guards discovered reporter [[Paul Harvey]] near the {{convert|10|ft|m|adj=on}} perimeter fence, his coat tangled in the barbed wire. Searching his car, guards found a previously prepared four-page broadcast detailing the saga of his unauthorized entrance into a classified "hot zone". He was brought before a federal grand jury on charges of conspiracy to obtain information on national security and transmit it to the public, but was not indicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Stephens |first = Joel |title = New documents show longtime friendship between J.

Not all nuclear technology went into developing reactors, however. While designing a scanner for reactor fuel elements in 1957, Argonne physicist William Nelson Beck put his own arm inside the scanner and obtained one of the first [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]] images of the human body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = William Nelson "Nels" Beck: Joliet Physicist's Work Changed Medical World |publisher = CityofJoliet.com |url = http://www.cityofjoliet.com/halloffame/scientists/wnbeck.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remote manipulators designed to handle radioactive materials laid the groundwork for more complex machines used to clean up contaminated areas, sealed laboratories or caves.&lt;ref&gt;Holl, Hewlett, and Harris, page 126&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, the "Janus" reactor opened to study the effects of neutron radiation on biological life, providing research for guidelines on safe exposure levels for workers at power plants, laboratories and hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Research helps safeguard nuclear workers worldwide |publisher = Argonne National Laboratory |url = http://www.ne.anl.gov/About/hn/news960803.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scientists at Argonne pioneered a technique to analyze the [[Moon|moon's]] surface using [[alpha decay|alpha radiation]], which launched aboard the [[Surveyor 5]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Jacobsen |first = Sally |title = Getting Aboard Viking: No Room on the Mars Lander. |date = December 1971|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=JgsAAAAAMBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1967 and later analyzed lunar samples from the [[Apollo 11]] mission.

In addition to nuclear work, the laboratory maintained a strong presence in the basic research of [[physics]] and [[chemistry]]. In 1955, Argonne chemists co-discovered the [[Chemical element|elements]] [[einsteinium]] and [[fermium]], elements 99 and 100 in the [[periodic table]].&lt;ref&gt;Holl, Hewlett, and Harris, page 179.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, laboratory chemists produced the first compound of the inert [[noble gas]] [[xenon]], opening up a new field of chemical bonding research.&lt;ref&gt;Holl, Hewlett, and Harris, page 226.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, they discovered the [[Aqueous electron|hydrated electron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Argonne History: Innovation and Serendipity |publisher = Argonne National Laboratory |url = http://www.anl.gov/Science_and_Technology/History/Anniversary_Frontiers/chemhist.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High-energy physics made a leap forward when Argonne was chosen as the site of the 12.5 GeV [[Zero Gradient Synchrotron]], a [[particle accelerator|proton accelerator]] that opened in 1963. A [[bubble chamber]] allowed scientists to track the motions of [[subatomic particle]]s as they zipped through the chamber; in 1970, they observed the [[neutrino]] in a hydrogen bubble chamber for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Patel, page 23&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the laboratory was also helping to design the reactor for the world's first [[Nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear-powered]] [[submarine]], the [[USS Nautilus (SSN-571)|U.S.S. ''Nautilus'']], which steamed for more than 513,550 nautical miles (951,090&amp;nbsp;km). The next nuclear reactor model was Experimental [[Boiling Water Reactor]], the forerunner of many modern nuclear plants, and [[Experimental Breeder Reactor II]] (EBR-II), which was sodium-cooled, and included a fuel recycling facility. EBR-II was later modified to test other reactor designs, including a [[fast-neutron reactor]] and, in 1982, the [[Integral Fast Reactor]] concept—a revolutionary design that reprocessed its own fuel, reduced its atomic waste and withstood safety tests of the same failures that triggered the [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] and [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island]] disasters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Frontline: Nuclear Reaction: Interview with Dr. Charles Till |publisher = PBS |url = https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/reaction/interviews/till.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, however, the U.S. Congress terminated funding for the bulk of Argonne's nuclear programs.

Argonne moved to specialize in other areas, while capitalizing on its experience in physics, chemical sciences and [[metallurgy]]. In 1987, the laboratory was the first to successfully demonstrate a pioneering technique called [[plasma wakefield acceleration]], which accelerates particles in much shorter distances than conventional accelerators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Argonne History: Understanding the Physical Universe |publisher=Argonne National Laboratory |url=http://www.anl.gov/Science_and_Technology/History/Anniversary_Frontiers/physhist.html#neutrino |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040909173546/http://www.anl.gov/Science_and_Technology/History/Anniversary_Frontiers/physhist.html |archivedate=9 September 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also cultivated a strong [[battery (electricity)|battery]] research program.

Following a major push by then-director Alan Schriesheim, the laboratory was chosen as the site of the [[Advanced Photon Source]], a major X-ray facility which was completed in 1995 and produced the brightest X-rays in the world at the time of its construction.

{{Renewable energy sources}}

'''Bioliquids''' are liquid fuels made from biomass for energy purposes other than transport (i.e. heating and electricity).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.r-e-a.net/document-library/articles/REAYearbook2009FINALVersion.pdf Renewable Energy Association 2009 Handbook]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bioliquids are usually made from virgin or used vegetable and seed oils, like [[Palm oil|palm]] or [[Soybean oil|soya]] oil. These oils are burned in a power station to create heat, which can then be used to warm homes or boil water to make steam. This steam can then be used to drive a turbine to generate electricity.

[[Rudolf Diesel]]'s first public exhibition of the internal combustion engine, that was to later bear his name, ran on [[peanut]] oil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energybulletin.net/node/3986 Sustainable Energy From Vegetable Oil]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bioliquid production and use==
Bioliquids have been used for many years to provide heat for homes on a small scale but now big energy providers are looking at their use on a larger scale.

A controversial plant in [[Bristol]] (UK) was recently given the go ahead despite receiving several hundred complaints.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-12439191 BBC News: Bristol biofuel plant given go-ahead by Eric Pickles]&lt;/ref&gt; The plant will be built and operated by W4B and provide enough power for 25,000 homes.

==Advantages==
Bioliquids have several key advantages over other sources of renewable energy:&lt;ref name="greenwise"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.greenwisebusiness.co.uk/news/bioliquids-do-they-have-a-role-in-renewable-energy-2183.aspx | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120315021204/http://www.greenwisebusiness.co.uk/news/bioliquids-do-they-have-a-role-in-renewable-energy-2183.aspx | dead-url= yes | archive-date= 2012-03-15 | title= Bioliquids: do they have a role in renewable energy? | last= Aylott | first= Matthew | date= March 2011 | work=  | publisher= Green Wise Business | accessdate=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bioliquids have a high energy density
* The technology is well established, having been used for many years
* Can be used on demand, reacting quickly to changes in demand for power
* Can help reduce dependency on foreign oil.
* Reduces the green house gas emissions.

==Disadvantages==
{{Main|Issues relating to biofuels}}

Many of the same problems that affect biofuels also affect bioliquids and there are various social, economic, environmental and technical issues, which have been discussed in the popular media and scientific journals. These include: the effect of moderating [[oil prices]], the "[[food vs fuel]]" debate, [[poverty reduction]] potential, [[carbon emissions]] levels, [[sustainable biofuel]] production, [[deforestation]] and [[soil erosion]], [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]], impact on [[water resources]], as well as energy balance and efficiency.

Bioliquids also have several key problems compared to other sources of renewable energy:&lt;ref&gt;[[National Non-Food Crops Centre]]. [http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/tools/evaluation-of-bioliquid-feedstocks-and-heat-electricity-and-chp-technologies-nnfcc-11-016 Evaluation of Bioliquid Feedstocks &amp; Heat, Elec. &amp; CHP Technologies, NNFCC 11-016]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Price of fuel is very variable, due to competitiveness of feedstock for other uses (e.g. soap)
* Supply chain is still very new
* Governments, such as the EU, remained undecided on bioliquids

'''Bomb disposal''' is the process by which hazardous explosive devices are rendered safe. ''Bomb disposal'' is an all-encompassing term to describe the separate, but interrelated functions in the military fields of '''explosive ordnance disposal''' ('''EOD''') and '''improvised explosive device disposal''' ('''IEDD'''), and the [[public safety]] roles of '''public safety bomb disposal '''('''PSBD''') and the '''bomb squad'''.

"Bomb disposal" does not encompass the [[Environmental remediation|remediation of soils polluted with explosive materials]].{{cn|date=September 2018}}

==History==
The first professional civilian bomb squad was established by Sir [[Vivian Dering Majendie]].&lt;ref name="Brodie"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WtGDHunq9zEC|title=Bombs and Bombings: A Handbook to Protection, Security, Disposal, and Investigation for Industry, Police and Fire Departments|author=Thomas G. Brodie|year=2005|publisher=Charles C Thomas Publisher|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a [[Major]] in the [[Royal Artillery]], Majendie investigated an explosion on 2 October 1874 in the [[Regent's Canal]], when the [[barge]] 'Tilbury', carrying six barrels of petroleum and five tons of gunpowder, blew up, killing the crew and destroying Macclesfield Bridge and cages at nearby [[London Zoo]].

In 1875, he framed The Explosives [[Bill (proposed law)|Act]], the first modern legislation for explosives control.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/26639/pages/3740 2 July 1895]&lt;/ref&gt; He also pioneered many bomb disposal techniques, including remote methods for the handling and dismantling of explosives.&lt;ref name="Brodie" /&gt; His advice during the [[Fenian dynamite campaign]] of 1881–85&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/200508080038 Armitage, Tom 'Bombing trains is nothing new - it is what 19th-century anarchists did' - The ''[[New Statesman]]'' 8 August 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; was officially recognised as having contributed to the saving of lives. After [[London Victoria station|Victoria Station]] was bombed on 26 February 1884 he defused a bomb with a [[clockwork]] mechanism which might have gone off at any moment.&lt;ref name=Obit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=EP18980625.2.74&amp;zto=1|title=Death Of A Distinguished Officer|date=25 June 1898|publisher=|pages=3|via=Papers Past}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New York City Police Department]] established its first bomb squad in 1903. Known as the "Italian Squad", its primary mission was to deal with [[dynamite]] bombs used by the [[Italian-American Mafia|Mafia]] to intimidate immigrant Italian merchants and residents. It would later be known as the "Anarchist Squad" and the "Radical Squad".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Kareem Fahim|title=Bomb Squad Has Hard-Won Expertise |work=New York Times |date=2010-05-02 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/03/nyregion/03squad.html?scp=2&amp;sq=bomb%20squad&amp;st=Search|accessdate=2010-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===WWI: Military bomb disposal units===
[[File:1918 German UXOs2.JPG|thumb|A British NCO prepares to dispose of an unexploded bomb, during the First World War.]]
Bomb Disposal became a formalized practice in the [[First World War]]. The swift mass production of munitions led to many manufacturing defects, and a large proportion of shells fired by both sides were found to be "duds".&lt;ref name="Payne"&gt;{{cite web |author=David Payne |title=Duds On The Western Front In The Great War |publisher=The Western Front Association |year= |work=westernfrontassociation.com |url=http://www.westernfront.co.uk/thegreatwar/articles/research/dudswestern.htm |accessdate=2006-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were hazardous to attacker and defender alike.  In response, the British dedicated a section of Ordnance Examiners from the [[Royal Army Ordnance Corps]] to handle the growing problem.

In 1918, the Germans developed [[delayed-action fuze]]s that would later develop into more sophisticated versions during the 1930s, as [[Nazi Germany]] began its secret course of arms development. These tests led to the development of UXBs ([[unexploded bombs]]), pioneered by Herbert Ruehlemann of [[Rheinmetall]], and first employed during the [[Spanish Civil War]] of 1936–37. Such delayed-action bombs provoked terror in the civilian population because of the uncertainty of time, and also complicated the task of disarming them. The Germans saw that unexploded bombs caused far more chaos and disruption than bombs that exploded immediately. This caused them to increase their usage of delayed-action bombs in [[World War II]].

Initially there were no specialized tools, training, or core knowledge available, and as Ammunition Technicians learned how to safely neutralize one variant of munition, the enemy would add or change parts to make neutralization efforts more hazardous. This trend of cat-and-mouse extends even to the present day, and the various techniques used to disarm munitions are not publicized.

===WWII: Modern techniques===
[[File:Bomb disposal 1940.jpg|thumb|left|A bomb disposal team in 1940.]]

Modern EOD Technicians across the world can trace their heritage to [[the Blitz]], when the United Kingdom's cities were subjected to extensive bombing raids by [[Nazi Germany]].  In addition to conventional [[airstrike|air raids]], [[unexploded ordnance|unexploded bombs]] (UXBs) took their toll on population and morale, paralyzing vital services and communications. Bombs fitted with delayed-action [[fuze]]s provoked fear and uncertainty in the civilian population.

The first UXBs were encountered in the autumn of 1939 before the Blitz and were for the most part easily dealt with, mostly by [[Royal Air Force]] or [[Air Raid Precautions]] personnel. In the spring of 1940, when the [[Phony War]] ended, the British realized that they were going to need professionals in numbers to deal with the coming problem. 25 sections were authorized for the Royal Engineers in May 1940, another 109 in June, and 220 by August. Organization was needed, and as the Blitz began, 25 "Bomb Disposal Companies" were created between August 1940 and January 1941. Each company had ten sections, each section having a bomb disposal officer and 14 other ranks to assist. Six companies were deployed in London by January 1941.

The problem of UXBs was further complicated when Royal Engineer bomb disposal personnel began to encounter munitions fitted with [[anti-handling device]]s e.g. the [[Luftwaffe]]'s ZUS40 [[Anti-handling device|anti-removal]] bomb [[fuze]] of 1940. Bomb fuzes incorporating anti-handling devices were specifically designed to kill bomb disposal personnel. Scientists and technical staff responded by devising methods and equipment to render them safe, including the work of [[Eric Moxey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/205049825|title=THE WORK OF RAF BOMB DISPOSAL SQUADS IN THE UK AND GERMANY DURING THE SECOND WORLD WAR.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States War Department]] felt the British Bomb Disposal experience could be a valuable asset, based on reports from [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], [[United States Navy|Navy]], and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] observers at RAF Melksham in [[Wiltshire, England]] in 1940. The next year, the [[Office of Civilian Defense]] (OCD) and War Department both sponsored a bomb disposal program. After the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], the British sent instructors to [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]], where the U.S. Army would inaugurate a formal bomb disposal school under the [[Ordnance Corps (United States Army)|Ordnance Corps]]. Col. Thomas J. Kane became the U.S. Army Ordnance Bomb Disposal School commandant, and later served as ETO Director of Bomb Disposal under [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]].&lt;ref&gt;Leatherwood, Jeffrey M. (2012). ''[[Nine From Aberdeen]]: U.S. Army Ordnance Bomb Disposal in World War II''. Cambridge Scholars Publishing. {{ISBN|978-1-4438-3786-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1941, British colleagues helped establish the Naval Mine Disposal School at the [[Washington Navy Yard|Naval Gun Factory]], [[Washington, D.C.]] Not to be outdone, the U.S. Navy, under the command of Lt. [[Draper L. Kauffman]] (who would go on to found the [[Underwater Demolition Team]]s{{spaced ndash}} better known as UDTs or the U.S. Navy Frogmen), created the Naval Bomb Disposal School at University Campus, [[Washington, D.C.]].

The first US Army Bomb Disposal companies were deployed in [[North Africa]] and [[Sicily]], but proved cumbersome and were replaced with mobile seven-man squads in 1943. Wartime errors were rectified in 1947 when Army personnel started attending a new school at [[Indian Head, Maryland]], under U.S. Navy direction. That same year, the forerunner of the EOD Technology Center, the USN Bureau of Naval Weapons, charged with research, development, test, and evaluation of EOD tools, tactics and procedures was born.

===Northern Ireland===
The [[Ammunition Technicians]] of the [[Royal Logistic Corps]] (formerly [[RAOC]]) became highly experienced in bomb disposal, after many years of dealing with bombs planted by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (PIRA) and other groups. The bombs employed by the PIRA ranged from simple pipe bombs to sophisticated victim-triggered devices and [[infrared]] switches.  The roadside bomb was in use by PIRA from the early 1970s onwards, evolving over time with different types of explosives and triggers. Improvised mortars were also developed by the IRA, usually placed in static vehicles, with self-destruct mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Steve ''3-2-1 Bomb Gone : Fighting Terrorist Bombers in Northern Ireland'', Sutton Publishing 2006 pp. 131–149 {{ISBN|0-7509-4205-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 38-year campaign in Northern Ireland, 23 British ATO bomb disposal specialists were killed in action.&lt;ref&gt;Rayment, Sean  ''Bomb Hunters: In Afghanistan with Britain's Elite Bomb Disposal Unit'' London HarperCollins 2011 p.58 {{ISBN|9780007374786}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A specialist Army unit, [[321 EOD]] Unit (later 321 EOD Company, and now part of [[11 Explosive Ordnance Disposal Regiment RLC]]), was deployed to tackle increased IRA violence and willingness to use bombs against both economic and military targets. The unit's radio call-sign was Felix. Many{{who|date=September 2015}} believe this to be an allusion to the cat with [[Cat#History and mythology|nine lives]] and led to the phrase "Fetch Felix" whenever a suspect device was encountered, which later became the title of the 1981 book ''Fetch Felix''. However, the real reason could be either of two possibilities.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} All units in Northern Ireland had a callsign to be used over the radios. 321 Company, a newly formed unit, didn't have such a callsign, so a young signaller was sent to the OC of 321 Coy. The OC, having lost two technicians that morning, decided on "[[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix]]". This was misheard as "Felix" by the signaller and was never changed. The other possible reason is that the callsign for RAOC was "Rickshaw"; however, the 321 EOD felt it needed its own callsign, hence the deliberate choice of "Felix the Cat with nine lives". 321 Coy RAOC (now 321 EOD Sqn RLC) is unique in that it is the most decorated unit (in peace time) in the British Army with over 200 gallantry awards, notably for acts of great bravery during [[Operation Banner]] (1969–2007) in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref name="Fetch Felix"&gt;{{cite book |last=Patrick |first=Derrick |year=1981 |title=Fetch Felix: The Fight Against the Ulster Bombers, 1976–1977 |publisher=Hamish Hamilton |isbn=0-241-10371-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British Ammunition Technicians of 11 EOD Regiment RLC were requested by the US Forces commanders to operate in support of the US Marine Corps in clearing the Iraqi oilfields of booby traps and were among the first British service personnel sent into Iraq in 2003 prior to the actual ground invasion.

===Low intensity conflicts===
[[File:3rd Battalion 3rd Marines controlled detonation.jpg|thumb|right|[[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] conducting a controlled detonation of [[improvised explosive device]]s in [[Afghanistan]].]]
The eruption of [[low intensity conflict]]s and [[terrorism]] waves at the beginning of the 21st century caused further development in the techniques and methods of bomb disposal. EOD Operators and Technicians had to adapt to rapidly evolving methods of constructing improvised explosive devices ranging from [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]]-filled [[explosive belts]] to 100&amp;nbsp;kg bombs. Since improvised explosives are generally unreliable and very unstable they pose great risk to the public and especially to the EOD Operator trying to render them safe. Therefore, new methods like greater reliance on remote techniques such as advanced remotely operated vehicles similar to the British [[Wheelbarrow (EOD)|Wheelbarrow]] or [[armored bulldozer]]s evolved. Many nations have developed their own versions such as the [[Caterpillar D7|D7 MCAP]] and the [[Caterpillar D9|armored D9R]].

[[File:US Navy explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) divers.jpg|thumb|left|[[U.S. Navy]] explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) divers.]]
The British Armed Forces have become experts in bomb disposal after many years of dealing with bombs planted by the IRA. These came in many different forms, particularly car bombs rigged to detonate via a variety of manners including command wire and remote trigger. Some of the first personnel sent into Iraq in 2003 were British bomb disposal experts of 11 EOD Regiment [[Royal Logistic Corps|RLC]]. Besides large mine-clearing vehicles such as [[Trojan (vehicle)|the Trojan]], the British Army also uses small remote controlled vehicles such as [[Dragon Runner]] and Chevette.&lt;ref&gt;Frontline Battle Machines with Mike Brewer&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=December 2010|reason=&lt;nowiki&gt;This is not a proper reference citation.

During the [[al-Aqsa Intifada]], Israeli EOD forces have disarmed and detonated thousands of explosive charges, lab bombs and explosive [[ammunition]] (such as rockets). Two Israeli EOD teams gained high reputation for leading the efforts in that area: the Army's [[Israeli Engineering Corps]]' [[Sayeret Yahalom]] and the [[Magav|Israeli Border Guard]] Gaza-area EOD team.

In the [[Iraq War]], the International coalition [[multinational force in Iraq]] forces have faced many bombs on travel routes. Such charges can easily destroy light vehicles such as the [[Humvee]], and large ones can even destroy [[main battle tank]]s. Such charges caused many casualties and along with [[car bomb]]s and [[suicide bomber]]s were a major cause of [[Casualty (person)|casualties]] in Iraq.

In Spain's autonomous [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], where bombings by [[Basque nationalist|Basque separatist]] groups were common during the 1980s and 1990s, there are three corps in charge of bomb disposal: [[Cuerpo Nacional de Policía (Spain)|Policia Nacional]], [[Civil Guard (Spain)|Guardia Civil]], and [[Ertzaintza]]. The Ertzaintza handle general civilian threats, while the Policia Nacional and Guardia Civil maintain capabilities mainly to defend their own assets and personnel. In other parts of the country, the Guardia Civil and Policia Nacional develop their tasks within their own abilities, with the exception of [[Mossos d'Esquadra]] in Catalonia (where the situation is the same as in the Basque Country).

==Fields of operations==

===EOD===

In the United Kingdom, EOD Operators are held within all three Services. Each Service has differing responsibilities for UXO, however they will often work closely on operations.

[[Ammunition Technical Officer]]s and [[Ammunition Technician]]s of the [[Royal Logistic Corps]] deal with many aspects of EOD, including conventional munitions and homemade bombs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.army.mod.uk/rlc/regiments/8731.aspx 11 EOD Regiment - British Army Website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118050728/http://www.army.mod.uk/rlc/regiments/8731.aspx |date=January 18, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also trained in [[chemical weapons|chemical]], [[biological weapons|biological]], incendiary, radiological ("[[dirty bomb]]s"), and [[nuclear weapons]]. They provide support to [[Very Important Person (person)|VIP]]s, help civilian authorities with bomb problems, teach personnel from all three services about bomb safety, and a variety of other tasks.

The [[Royal Engineers]] of [[33 Engineer Regiment (EOD)]]  provide EOD expertise for air dropped munitions in peace time and conventional munitions on operations, as well as battle area clearance and High Risk Search in support of improvised explosive device disposal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/5011A2EB-8ADD-4E1D-87EA-E7C40D61B2DA/0/20071218_jdp2_02_U_DCDCIMAPPS.pdf UK Joint Doctrine Publication 2-02 - Joint Service Explosive Ordnance Disposal] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608002417/http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/5011A2EB-8ADD-4E1D-87EA-E7C40D61B2DA/0/20071218_jdp2_02_U_DCDCIMAPPS.pdf |date=June 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They also provide expertise in Advanced IEDD and in the investigation of accidents and incidents involving ammunition and explosives, where they are seen as Subject Matter Experts (SMEs).
[[File:Bomb Disposal Squad Indian Army protective suit.jpg|thumb|Bomb suit of Bomb Disposal Squad of the [[Indian Army]] ]]
Weapons Intelligence is supplied by [[Royal Military Police]], [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|Intelligence Corps]] and Ammunition Technical Personnel who tap into the CEXC units of the USA.

All prospective Ammunition Technicians attend a gruelling course of instruction at [[Army School of Ammunition|The Army School of Ammunition]] and the [[Felix Centre]], United Kingdom.  The time frame for an RLC Ammunition Technician to complete all necessary courses prior to finally being placed on an EOD team is around 36 months.  Whereas the Engineer EOD training period although shorter in total is spread over a number of years and interspersed with operational experience, RE personnel may be posted to core trades such as carpentry or bridge building within their time as engineers.

[[Royal Air Force]] [[armourers]] from [[No. 5131 (BD) Squadron RAF|5131 (BD) Squadron]] and [[Royal Navy]] [[clearance diver]]s also deploy teams both in the UK and on operations working on both IEDD ([[Improvised Explosive Device]] Disposal) teams as well as the disposal of conventional munitions. Both the RAF and Royal Navy personnel spend their entire service working with and around explosives, and associated sciences. As such are given responsibilities relevant to their roles when it comes to conventional weapons;
* RAF: Any air-dropped munitions (with the exception of [[World War II]] German weapons) and aircraft crash sites.
* Royal Navy: Anything of an explosive nature found below the [[high water mark]] or deemed to be of a naval origin.

===PSBT===
[[Image:Sept05leb img 5.jpg|thumb|right|An [[FBI agent]] in a [[bomb suit]] performing a training mission]]

US EOD covers both on and off base calls in the US unless there is a local PSBT or "Public Safety Bomb Technician" that can handle the bomb - ordnance should only be handled by the EOD experts. Also called a "Hazardous Devices Technician", PSBTs are usually members of a [[Police]] department, although there are teams formed by [[fire department]]s or emergency management agencies.

To be certified, PSBTs must attend the joint U.S. Army-[[FBI]] Hazardous Devices School at [[Redstone Arsenal]], [[Alabama]] which is modeled on the International IEDD Training school at The [[Army School of Ammunition]], known as the [[Felix Centre]]. This school helps them to become knowledgeable in the detection, diagnosis and disposal of hazardous devices. They are further trained to collect evidence in hazardous devices, and present expert witness testimony in [[court]] on bombing cases.

===UXO===
{{Main|Unexploded ordnance}}
Before bombing ranges can be re utilized for other purposes, these ranges must be cleared of all unexploded ordnance. This is usually performed by civilian specialists trained in the field, often with prior military service in explosive ordnance disposal. These technicians use specialized tools for subsurface examination of the sites. When munitions are found, they safely neutralize them and remove them from the site.

=== Other (training, mining, fireworks) ===
In addition to neutralizing munitions or [[bomb]]s, conducting training and presenting evidence, EOD Technicians and Engineers also respond to other problems.

EOD Technicians help dispose old or unstable explosives, such as ones used in [[quarry]]ing, [[mining]], or old/unstable [[firework]]s and [[ammunition]]. They also assist specialist police units, raid and entry teams with boobytrap detection and avoidance, and they help in conducting post-blast investigations.

The EOD technician's training and experience with bombs make them an integral part of any bombing investigation. Another part of an EOD technician's job involves supporting the government intelligence units. This involves searching all places that the high ranking government officers or other protected dignitaries travel, stay or visit.

==Techniques==

Generally, EOD ''[[render safe procedure]]s'' (RSP) are a type of [[tradecraft]] protected from public dissemination in order to limit access and knowledge, depriving the enemy of specific technical procedures used to render safe ordnance or an improvised device. Another reason for keeping tradecraft secret is to hinder the development of new [[anti-handling device]]s by their opponents: if the enemy has thorough knowledge of specific EOD techniques, they can develop [[fuze]] designs which are more resistant to existing render-safe procedures.

Many techniques exist for the making safe of a bomb or munition. Selection of a technique depends on several variables. The greatest variable is the proximity of the munition or device to people or critical facilities. Explosives in remote localities are handled very differently from those in densely populated areas. Contrary to the image portrayed in modern-day movies, the role of the modern Bomb Disposal Operator is to accomplish their task as remotely as possible. Actually laying hands on a bomb is only done in an extremely life-threatening situation, where the hazards to people and critical structures cannot be reduced.

[[Image:Remotely controlled bomb disposal tool.JPG|thumb|right|[[Wheelbarrow (robot)|Wheelbarrow]] remotely controlled bomb disposal tool]]

[[Ammunition technician|Ammunition technicians]] have many tools for remote operations, one of which is the RCV, or remotely controlled vehicle, also known as the "[[EODWheelbarrow|Wheelbarrow]]". Outfitted with cameras, microphones, and sensors for chemical, biological, or nuclear agents, the Wheelbarrow can help the technician get an excellent idea of what the munition or device is. Many of these [[robot]]s even have hand-like manipulators in case a door needs to be opened, or a munition or bomb requires handling or moving.  The first ever [[EODWheelbarrow|Wheelbarrow]] was conceived by Major Robert John Wilson 'Pat' Patterson RAOC and his team at the Bomb Disposal School, CAD Kineton in 1972 and used by [[ammunition technicians|Ammunition technicians]] in the battle against [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] bombs.

Punsalan attached to the 69th Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Team, Philippine Army, wears the SRS-5 light weight explosive protection suit while uses a long pole and disruptor on a.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Placing a disruption charge while wearing a protective suit]]
Also of great use are items that allow ammunition technicians to remotely diagnose the innards of a munition or bomb. These include devices similar to the [[X-ray]] used by medical personnel, and high-performance sensors that can detect and help interpret sounds, odors, or even images from within the munition or bomb. Once the technicians determine what the munition or device is, and what state it is in, they will formulate a procedure to disarm it. This may include things as simple as replacing safety features, or as difficult as using high-powered explosive-actuated devices to shear, jam, bind, or remove parts of the item's firing train. Preferably, this will be accomplished remotely, but there are still circumstances when a robot won't do, and a technician must put themself at risk by personally going near the bomb. The technician will don a specialized [[bombsuit|protective suit]], using flame and fragmentation-resistant material similar to [[bulletproof vest]]s. Some suits have advanced features such as internal cooling, amplified hearing, and communications back to the control area. This suit is designed to increase the odds of survival for the technician should the munition or bomb function while they are near it.

Rarely, the specifics of a munition or bomb will allow the technician to first remove it from the area. In these cases, a containment vessel is used. Some are shaped like small water tanks, others like large [[sphere]]s. Using remote methods, the technician places the item in the container and retires to an uninhabited area to complete the neutralization. Because of the instability and complexity of modern bombs, this is rarely done. After the munition or bomb has been rendered safe, the technicians will assist in the removal of the remaining parts so the area can be returned to normal. All of this, called a Render Safe Procedure, can take a great deal of time. Because of the construction of devices, a waiting period must be taken to ensure that whatever render-safe method was used worked as intended.

Another technique is Trepanation, in which a bore is cut into the sidewall of a bomb and the explosive contents are extracted through a combination of steam and acid bath liquification of bomb contents.&lt;ref name="Jane's"&gt;{{cite web|title=Van Trepan{TM} Mk 3 explosive trepanning tool for vehicles (United Kingdom), Equipment - EOD weapons|url=http://www.janes.com/articles/Janes-Explosive-Ordnance-Disposal/Van-Trepan-TM-Mk-3-explosive-trepanning-tool-for-vehicles-United-Kingdom.html|work=Jane's Explosive Ordnance Disposal|publisher=Janes.com|accessdate=22 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although professional EOD personnel have expert knowledge, skills and equipment, they are not immune to misfortune because of the inherent dangers: in June 2010, construction workers in [[Göttingen]] discovered an Allied 500 kilogram bomb dating from [[World War II]] buried approximately 7 metres below the ground. German EOD experts were notified and attended the scene. Whilst residents living nearby were being evacuated and the EOD personnel were preparing to disarm the bomb, it [[detonated]], killing three of them and injuring 6 others. The dead and injured each had over 20 years of hands-on experience, and had previously rendered safe between 600 and 700 unexploded bombs. The bomb which killed and injured the EOD personnel was of a particularly dangerous type because it was fitted with a delayed-action chemical [[fuze]], which had become highly unstable after over 65 years under ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=International |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,698245,00.html |title=Spiegel.de |publisher=Spiegel.de |date=2010-06-02 |accessdate=2013-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/10212890.stm | work=BBC News | title=World War II bomb kills three in Germany | date=2010-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/7795709/Three-dead-as-Second-World-War-bomb-explodes-in-Germany.html |title=Three dead as Second World War bomb explodes in Germany |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2010-06-02 |accessdate=2013-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyexpress.co.uk/posts/view/178648/Bomb-kills-German-explosive-experts/ |title=Bomb kills German explosive experts |publisher=Dailyexpress.co.uk |date=2010-06-02 |accessdate=2013-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==EOD equipment==

===Portable X-ray systems===
[[File:EOD training.jpg|thumb|EOD training and material testing. A 105 mm shell is radiographied with battery powered portable X-ray generator and flat panel detector.]]

Portable X-ray systems are used to radiograph the bomb before intervention. The purpose is for example to determine if a chemical charge is present or to check the status of the detonator. High steel thickness require high energy and high power sources.

===Projected water disruptors===
[[Image:US Navy 090114-N-8730P-037 The detonation of a Boot Banger water charge demonstrates its destructive power.jpg|thumb|right|Boot Banger water charge disrupts simulated bomb]]
[[File:Bottler.jpg|thumb|Bottler Lite against a small suspect device]]
Projected water disruptors use a water-projectile [[shaped charge]] to destroy bombs, blasting the device apart and severing any detonating connections faster than any fuse or anti-tampering device on the bomb can react. One example is the BootBanger, deployed under the rear compartment of cars suspected to be carrying bombs.&lt;ref name="BootBangerJanes"&gt;{{Cite web

====Pigstick====
'''Pigstick''' is the British Army term for the waterjet disruptor commonly deployed on the [[wheelbarrow (EOD)|Wheelbarrow]] remotely operated vehicle against IRA bombs in the 1970s. It fires a jet of water driven by a propellent charge to disrupt the [[Electrical network|circuitry]] of a [[bomb]] and disabling it with a low risk of detonation. The modern pigstick is reliable and can be fired many times with minimal maintenance. It is now used worldwide. It is 485&amp;nbsp;mm long and weighs 2.95&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pigstick Disruptor |url=http://www.chemringeod.com/Download.aspx?ResourceId=14270|publisher=Chemring EOD|accessdate=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is made of hardened steel, and can be mounted on a [[remotely operated vehicle]] (ROV). These factors make it an effective way to render IEDs safe. It is not a panacea however, it can not deal with IEDs packed in hard containers like industrial gas bottles or beer kegs, for instance, and other disruptors have been designed to deal with those and a range of other situations including car bombs.

The name ''pigstick'' is an odd analogy coming from the verb meaning "to hunt the wild boar on horseback with a spear."

The device was developed by the scientists Mike Barker MBE and Peter Hubbard OBE at [[RARDE]] [[Fort Halstead]] in late 1971 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hubbard OBE|first1=Peter|title=the Exploding Kind|publisher=Peter J Hubbard|pages=1 to 6|url=http://www.racheldavid.plus.com/share/The_Exploding_Kind.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; working under great pressure over a period of several weeks after an [[Ammunition Technical Officer|ATO]] lost his life in Northern Ireland attempting to render safe the first IED in the theatre to contain anti-handling devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EoeuCAAAQBAJ|title=Operation Banner: The British Army in Northern Ireland 1969–2007|first=Nick Van der|last=Bijl|date=19 October 2009|publisher=Pen and Sword|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19710910&amp;id=j-Y9AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=iEgMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2209,1701851|work=The Glasgow Herald |title=Cahill freed after brief stay in Dublin jail|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They started with a prototype equipment designed to disrupt [[limpet mines]] attached to a ship's hull and through a process of many trials and error developed a disruptor that could deal with the crop of IEDs with anti-handling devices prevalent at the time. Barker used the device operationally for the first time in Northern Ireland during a visit there to demonstrate their prototype to [[George Styles]] and his team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hubbard OBE|first1=Peter|title=the Exploding Kind|publisher=Peter J Hubbard|pages=5 |url=http://www.racheldavid.plus.com/share/The_Exploding_Kind.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pigstick prototype was re-engineered by a member of Hubbard's team, Bob White MBE, down from its original 20&amp;nbsp;kg to its current 2.95&amp;nbsp;kg form but its internal ballistic design remained true to the original.

===ZEUS===
The [[ZEUS-HLONS (HMMWV Laser Ordnance Neutralization System)]], commonly known as ZEUS, was developed for surface land mines and unexploded ordnance (UXO) neutralization by the U.S. Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division (NAVEODTECHDIV). It uses a moderate-power commercial solid state laser (SSL) and beam control system, integrated onto a Humvee (HMMWV), to clear surface mines, improvised bombs, or unexploded ordnance (UXO) from supply routes and minefields.

===Bomb containment chamber===
[[File:ACFD-Bomb-Disposal-Unit.jpg|thumb|A bomb containment chamber]]
There are a wide range of containment chambers available.  The simplest are sometimes danger suppression vessels that merely contain some of the fragments generated by the explosion. The other end of the spectrum features top-of-the-line gas-tight chambers that can withstand multiple shots while remaining able to contain [[CBRNe|chemical, biological, or radioactive agents]]. Containment chambers of all types may be fitted onto towed trailers, or specialised EOD vehicles.

===EOD suits===
{{Main|Bomb suit}}
There is a long history of IEDD within the UK and protection for this role has evolved over the years. Starting with the Mk1 in 1969, in response to the Maoist Terrorist threat in Hong Kong, through to the Mk 2 in 1974, in response to the IRA threat in Northern Ireland (NI), with further developments of the Mk3 in 1980 to include a new helmet.  The Mk4 EOD Suit, introduced into service in 1993, combines fragmentation and blast protection that is prioritised over the most vulnerable parts of the body (head, face and torso).  The current system, MKV/VI, was introduced in 2004, and was a combined MOD/NP Aerospace project. The only part of the body that has no protection at all is the hands.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3031">The '''Center for Research in Economics and Statistics''' ('''CREST''') is the center of research of the [[INSEE]], the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies.
The research center is affiliated with the [[École Nationale de la Statistique et de l'Administration Économique|ENSAE]] graduate school.
It is directed by [[Francis Kramarz]] since 2007.

It includes several laboratories in econometrics, macroeconomics,microeconomics, statistics, finance, mathematics, sociology.

It is ranked 9th research center in Economics in the world, 2nd in Europe and 1st in France by www.econphd.net
[http://www.econphd.net/rank/rallec.htm See ranking here]

==Objectives==
The general objective of CREST is to play an active role in the international development of research in two main fields:
* economic and social modeling
* conception and implementation of statistical methods

This general goal can be broken down into four more specific objectives:
* The training of graduate students
* The production and diffusion of research
* The exchange and management of visitors programs
* The links with firms and public administrations

===The training of graduate students===
CREST organizes advanced PhD courses and participates in the supervision of dissertations. Over forty research students are currently working on their dissertations at the center. French and foreign students and apply for a CREST fellowship.

The CREST maintains very close relationships with the [[École Nationale de la Statistique et de l'Administration Économique|ENSAE]], the Graduate School of INSEE.

===The production and diffusion of research===
The CREST production is important both in the theoretical and the applied fields. The center organizes eight regular seminars and many international conferences (more than ten conferences over the last five years). The Centre also publishes a series of working papers, an information letter and an annual report.

===Exchange and visitors programs===
Invitations of junior and senior researchers are part of the Center's policy. The length of the visits varies between one week and one year and financial support is available. In addition, CREST is involved in several international networks, both in the doctoral field (the European Doctoral Program in quantitative economics, for example) and in research (Human Capital and Mobility networks, for instance).

===Links with firms and public administrations===
In particularly with INSEE. Several members of CREST are advisors for French firms or administrations. CREST also has strong links with INSEE: on the one hand, CREST benefits from the statistical data available at INSEE, and, on the other hand, the Center provides expertise for various studies and training programs.

The '''Centre International de Rencontres Mathématiques (CIRM)''' is a mathematics research institute associated with the [[Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique]] (CNRS) and the [[Société Mathématique de France]] (SMF). It is located in Luminy, Marseille, France and is affiliated with [[Aix-Marseille University]]. CIRM hosts weekly workshops on diverse topics where mathematicians and scientists from all over the world come to do collaborative research. Modeled as a "[[Medici villas|villa Medici]] of mathematics", it receives around 3,500 visitors per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lis|first1=Louise|title=Dans la villa Médicis des maths|url=https://lejournal.cnrs.fr/articles/dans-la-villa-medicis-des-maths|website=Le journal|publisher=Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique|accessdate=9 July 2017|language=fr|date=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1954, a report from the CNRS discussed potential sites for a meeting place to hold international seminars and workshops in mathematics similar to the [[Mathematical Research Institute of Oberwolfach|Mathematisches Forschunginstitut Oberwolfach]]. The Luminy estate, formerly owned by the prominent [[Fabre Line|Fabre]] shipping family, was chosen in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Bit of History|url=http://www.cirm-math.com/a-bit-of-history.html|website=Centre International de Rencontres Mathématiques|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The estate was handed over to the SMF in 1979. The center opened in 1981 and the first workshop was held in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Contrucci|first1=Jean|title=Le Centre international de rencontres mathématiques a été inauguré à Marseille|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/archives/article/1981/06/24/le-centre-international-de-rencontres-mathematiques-a-ete-inaugure-a-marseille_2729406_1819218.html|accessdate=9 July 2017|work=Le Monde|date=24 June 1981|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific programs==
CIRM supports a variety of residential programs and workshops. Each year, CIRM runs around 35 week-long workshops with an average of 75 weekly participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Propose an event|url=http://www.cirm-math.com/propose-an-event.html|website=Centre International de Rencontres Mathématiques|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; CIRM also supports joint programs with [[Société de Mathématiques Appliquées et Industrielles]], [[Institut Henri Poincaré]], and [[Société Mathématique de France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Le Centre d’Eté Mathématique de Recherche Avancée en Calcul Scientifique|url=http://smai.emath.fr/spip.php?article51&amp;lang=fr|website=Societe de Mathematiques Appliquees et Industrielles|accessdate=9 July 2017|language=fr|date=24 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jean-Morlet Chair===
CIRM hosts the Jean-Morlet Chair, which is a six-month residential program for international researchers to collaborate with a local project leader from [[Aix-Marseille University]] to plan events and projects. The chair was named after [[Jean Morlet]], a French geophysicist who worked with Marseille-based researcher [[Alex Grossman]], among others, to develop the [[Wavelet transform]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Jean-Morlet Chair|url=http://www.chairejeanmorlet.com/|website=Chaire Jean-Morlet|publisher=Centre International de Rencontres Mathématiques|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Past chairs have included Nicola Kistler, Boris Hasselblatt, Igor Shparlinski, [[Hans Georg Feichtinger]], Herwig Hauser, Francois Lalonde, [[Dipendra Prasad]], [[Mariusz Lemańczyk]], [[Konstantin Khanin]], Shigeki Akiyama, and Genevieve Walsh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Semester Chairs|url=http://www.chairejeanmorlet.com/semesters.html|website=Chaire Jean-Morlet|publisher=Centre International de Recontres Mathematiques|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Clean-In-Place Unit at the World of Coca-Cola.jpg|thumb|A clean-in-place unit on display at the [[World of Coca-Cola]] in [[Atlanta]]]]
'''Clean-in-place''' ('''CIP''') is a method of cleaning the interior surfaces of pipes, vessels, process equipment, [[Filtration|filters]] and associated fittings, without disassembly.

Up to the 1950s, closed systems were disassembled and cleaned manually. The advent of CIP was a boon to industries that needed frequent internal cleaning of their processes. Industries that rely heavily on CIP are those requiring high levels of hygiene, and include: [[Dairy#Industrial production|dairy]], [[beverage]], [[Brewing#Brewing process|brewing]], [[Food processing#Industries|processed foods]], [[Pharmaceutical company|pharmaceutical]], and [[cosmetics]].

The benefit to industries that use CIP is that the cleaning is faster, less labor-intensive and more repeatable, and poses less of a chemical exposure risk. CIP started as a manual practice involving a balance tank, [[Centrifugal Pump|centrifugal pump]], and connection to the system being cleaned. Since the 1950s, CIP has evolved to include fully automated systems with [[programmable logic controller]]s, multiple balance tanks, [[sensors]], [[valves]], [[heat exchangers]], [[data acquisition]] and specially designed spray nozzle systems. Simple, manually operated CIP systems can still be found in use today.

Depending on soil load and process geometry, the CIP design principle is one of the following:
* deliver highly turbulent, high flow-rate solution to effect good cleaning (applies to pipe circuits and some filled equipment).
* deliver solution as a low-energy spray to fully wet the surface (applies to lightly soiled vessels where a static sprayball may be used).
* deliver a high energy impinging spray (applies to highly soiled or large diameter vessels where a dynamic spray device may be used).
Elevated temperature and chemical detergents are often employed to enhance cleaning effectiveness.

== Factors affecting the effectiveness of the cleaning agents ==
'''Temperature of the cleaning solution'''. Elevating the temperature of a cleaning solution increases its dirt removal efficiency. Molecules with high kinetic energy dislodge dirt faster than slow moving molecules of a cold solution.

'''Concentration of the cleaning agent'''. A concentrated cleaning solution will clean a dirty surface much better than a dilute one due to the increased surface binding capacity.

'''Contact time of the cleaning solution'''. The longer the detergent contact period, the higher the cleaning efficiency. After some time, the detergent eventually dissolves the hard stains/soil from the dirty surface.

'''Pressure exerted by the cleaning solution (or turbulence)'''. The turbulence creates an abrasive force that dislodges stubborn soil from the dirty surface.

==Groundwater sources==

Originally developed for cleaning closed systems as described above, CIP has more recently been applied to [[groundwater]] source [[borehole]]s used for high end-uses such as natural mineral / spring waters, food production and carbonated soft drinks (CSD).

Boreholes that are open to the atmosphere are prone to a number of chemical and microbiological problems, so sources for high end-use are often sealed at the surface ([[headworks]]). An air filter is built into the headworks to permit the borehole to inhale and exhale when the water level rises and falls quickly (usually due to the pump being turned on and off) without drawing in airborne particles or contaminants (spores, molds, fungi, bacteria, etc.).

In addition, CIP systems can be built into the borehole headworks to permit the injection of cleaning solutions (such as sodium hypochlorite or other sanitizers) and the subsequent recirculation of the mix of these chemicals and the groundwater. This process cleans the borehole interior and equipment without any invasive maintenance being required.

==Bioreactors, fermentors, and mix vessels==

CIP is commonly used for cleaning bioreactors, fermenters, mix vessels, and other equipment used in biotech manufacturing, pharmaceutical manufacturing and food and beverage manufacturing. CIP is performed to remove or obliterate previous [[cell culture]] batch components. It is used to remove in-process residues, control [[bioburden]], and reduce [[endotoxin]] levels within processing equipment and systems. Residue removal is accomplished during CIP with a combination of heat, chemical action, and [[turbulent flow]].

The [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] published a CIP regulation in 1978 applicable to pharmaceutical manufacturing. The regulation states, “Equipment and utensils shall be cleaned, maintained, and sanitized at appropriate intervals to prevent malfunctions or contamination that would alter the safety, identity, strength, quality or purity of the drug product beyond the official or other established requirements.”&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Food and Drug Administration (1978). "Current Good Manufacturing Practice for Finished Pharmaceuticals: Equipment cleaning and maintenance." ''Code of Federal Regulations,'' {{uscfr|21|211|67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Repeatable, reliable, and effective cleaning is of the utmost importance in a manufacturing facility. Cleaning procedures are validated to demonstrate that they are effective, reproducible, and under control. In order to adequately clean processing equipment, the equipment must be designed with smooth stainless steel surfaces and interconnecting piping that has cleanable joints. The chemical properties of the cleaning agents must properly interact with the chemical and physical properties of the residues being removed.

A typical CIP cycle consists of many steps which often include (in order):
* Pre-rinse with WFI (water for injection) or PW ([[purified water]]) which is performed to wet the interior surface of the tank and remove residue. It also provides a non-chemical pressure test of the CIP flow path.
* [[Sodium hydroxide|Caustic]] solution single pass flush through the vessel to drain. Caustic is the main cleaning solution.
* Caustic solution re-circulation through the vessel.
* Intermediate WFI or PW rinse
* Acid solution wash – used to remove mineral precipitates and protein residues.
* Final rinse with WFI or PW – rinses to flush out residual cleaning agents.
* Final air blow – used to remove moisture remaining after CIP cycle.

Critical parameters must be met and remain within the specification for the duration of the cycle. If the specification is not reached or maintained, cleaning will not be ensured and will have to be repeated. Critical parameters include temperature, flow rate/supply pressure, chemical concentration, chemical contact time, and final rinse [[Conductivity (electrolytic)|conductivity]] (which shows that all cleaning chemicals have been removed).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2214">'''Contact''' is an annual interdisciplinary conference that brings together [http://www.contact-conference.com/archive/org.html renowned social and space scientists, science fiction writers and artists] to exchange ideas, stimulate new perspectives, and encourage serious, creative speculation about humanity's future. The intent of Contact is to promote the integration of [[human factor]]s into space research and policy, to explore the intersection of science and art, and to develop ethical approaches to [[extraterrestrial intelligence|cross-cultural contact]]. Since its beginnings, the Contact conference has fostered interdisciplinary inquiries into art, literature, exploration and scientific investigation.

Contact was conceived by anthropologist Jim Funaro in 1979, and the first formal conference was held in 1983 in [[Santa Cruz, California]]. Twenty-six annual events have followed and several held at [[NASA Ames Research Center]]. In many previous years, the COTI HI project involved teams of high school students in the creation of scientifically accurate extraterrestrial beings, and in simulated encounters between two such races. 

Many spin-off organizations have formed, on line, and as far away as Japan. One such organization is the [[Contact consortium]], which is focused on the medium of contact in multi-user [[virtual world]]s on the [[Internet]].  

Contact has been closely allied with the [[SETI Institute]], and its early participants created the hypothetical planet Epona.

The 27th  Contact conference was held on March 31 - April 2, 2012 at the [[SETI Institute]] and the Domain Hotel, in [[Sunnyvale, California]]. Beginning with the 28th conference, held in Mountain View, the organization adopted a biennial schedule. The 29th conference was held on April 1st-3rd, 2016, at the Domain Hotel, California.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18741">'''Devolution''', '''de-evolution''', or '''backward evolution''' is the notion that [[species]] can revert to supposedly more [[Primitive (phylogenetics)|primitive]] forms over time. The concept is related to the idea that [[evolution]] has [[teleology|a purpose (teleology)]] and [[orthogenesis|is progressive (orthogenesis)]], for example that feet might be better than [[hoof|hooves]] or [[lung]]s than [[gill]]s. However, [[evolutionary biology]] makes no such assumptions, and [[natural selection]] shapes [[adaptation]]s with no foreknowledge of any kind. It is possible for small changes such as in the frequency of a single gene to be reversed by chance or selection, but this is no different from the normal course of evolution.

In the 19th century, when belief in orthogenesis was widespread, the idea of devolution was advocated by zoologists such as [[Ray Lankester]] and [[Anton Dohrn]],  and the palaeontologists [[Alpheus Hyatt]] and [[Carl H. Eigenmann]]. The idea was used in [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s 1985 novel ''[[Galápagos (novel)|Galápagos]]'', where he portrays a society that has evolved backwards to have small brains.

[[Dollo's law of irreversibility]], first stated in 1893 by the palaeontologist [[Louis Dollo]], denies the possibility of devolution. The evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] explains Dollo's law as being simply a statement about the [[probability|improbability]] of evolution's following precisely the same path twice.

==Context==
[[File:Lamarck's Two-Factor Theory.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Lamarck's theory of evolution involved a complexifying force that [[orthogenesis|progressively]] drives animal [[body plan]]s towards higher levels, creating a ladder of [[phylum|phyla]], as well as an adaptive force that causes animals with a given body plan to [[inheritance of acquired characteristics|adapt to circumstances]]. The idea of progress in such theories permits the opposite idea of decay, seen in devolution.]]
{{see|Orthogenesis}}

The idea of devolution is based on the presumption of [[orthogenesis]], the view that [[evolution]] has a [[teleology|purposeful]] direction towards [[Evolution of biological complexity|increasing complexity]]. Modern evolutionary theory, beginning with Darwin at least, poses no such presumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=McShea D |title=Complexity and evolution: What everybody knows |journal=Biology and Philosophy |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=303–324 |year=1991 |doi=10.1007/BF00132234}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the concept of evolutionary change is independent of either any increase in complexity of organisms sharing a gene pool, or any decrease, such as in [[vestigiality]] or in loss of genes.&lt;ref name=sciam&gt;Dougherty, Michael J. [http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=is-the-human-race-evolvin Is the human race evolving or devolving?] ''[[Scientific American]]'' July 20, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier views that species are subject to "cultural decay", "drives to perfection", or "devolution" are practically meaningless in terms of current (neo-)Darwinian theory.&lt;ref name=Glossary&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/precursors/glossary.html |title=Darwin's precursors and influences: Glossary |accessdate=2010-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early scientific theories of [[transmutation of species]] such as [[Lamarckism]] perceived species diversity as a result of a purposeful internal drive or tendency to form improved adaptations to the environment. In contrast, Darwinian evolution and its elaboration in the light of subsequent advances in biological research, have shown that [[adaptation]] through [[natural selection]] comes about when particular heritable attributes in a population happen to give a better chance of successful reproduction in the reigning environment than rival attributes do. By the same process less advantageous attributes are less "successful"; they decrease in frequency or are lost completely. Since Darwin's time it has been shown how these changes in the frequencies of attributes occur according to the mechanisms of [[genetics]] and the laws of inheritance originally investigated by [[Gregor Mendel]].  Combined with Darwin's original insights, genetic advances led to what has variously been called the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]]&lt;ref name="Huxley1974"&gt;{{cite book |author=Huxley, Julian |authorlink=Julian Huxley |title=Evolution: the modern synthesis |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sIkoAQAAMAAJ |year=1974 |publisher=Allen and Unwin}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the neo-Darwinism of the 20th century. In these terms evolutionary adaptation may occur most obviously through the natural selection of particular [[allele]]s. Such alleles may be long established, or they may be new [[mutation]]s. Selection also might arise from more complex [[epigenetic]] or other [[Chromosome|chromosomal]] changes, but the fundamental requirement is that any adaptive effect must be [[heritable]].&lt;ref name="Koonin2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Koonin, Eugene V. |title=The Logic of Chance: The Nature and Origin of Biological Evolution |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fvmv2kU6PrYC&amp;pg=PA16 |date=23 June 2011 |publisher=FT Press |isbn=978-0-13-262317-9 |pages=16–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of devolution on the other hand, requires that there be a preferred hierarchy of structure and function, and that evolution must mean "progress" to "more advanced" organisms. For example, it could be said that "feet are better than [[hoof|hooves]]" or "[[lung]]s are better than [[gill]]s", so their development is "evolutionary" whereas change to an inferior or "less advanced" structure would be called "devolution". In reality an evolutionary biologist defines all heritable changes to relative frequencies of the genes or indeed to [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] states in the gene pool as evolution.&lt;ref name="Futuyma2013"&gt;{{cite book |author=Futuyma, Douglas |title=Evolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YkrRlwEACAAJ |date=31 March 2013 |publisher=Sinauer Associates |isbn=978-1-60535-115-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; All gene pool changes that lead to increased fitness in terms of appropriate aspects of reproduction are seen as (neo-)Darwinian adaptation because, for the organisms possessing the changed structures, each is a useful adaptation to their circumstances. For example, hooves have advantages for running quickly on plains, which benefits horses, and feet offer advantages in climbing trees, which some ancestors of humans did.&lt;ref name=sciam/&gt;

The concept of devolution as regress from progress relates to the ancient ideas that either life came into being through special creation or that humans are the ultimate product or goal of evolution. The latter belief is related to [[anthropocentrism]], the idea that human existence is the point of all universal existence. Such thinking can lead on to the idea that species evolve because they "need to" in order to adapt to environmental changes. Biologists refer to this misconception as [[teleology]], the idea of [[intrinsic finality]] that things are "supposed" to be and behave a certain way, and naturally tend to act that way to pursue their own good. From a biological viewpoint, in contrast, if species evolve it is not a reaction to necessity, but rather that the population contains variations with traits that favour their [[natural selection]]. This view is supported by the fossil record which demonstrates that roughly ninety-nine percent of all species that ever lived are now extinct.&lt;ref name=sciam/&gt;

People thinking in terms of devolution commonly assume that progress is shown by increasing complexity, but biologists studying the [[evolution of complexity]] find evidence of many examples of decreasing complexity in the record of evolution. The lower jaw in fish, reptiles and mammals has seen a decrease in complexity, if measured by the number of bones. Ancestors of modern horses had several toes on each foot; modern horses have a single hooved toe. Modern humans may be evolving towards never having [[wisdom teeth]], and already have lost most of the [[Human vestigiality#Coccyx|tail]] found in many other mammals - not to mention other [[vestigial]] structures, such as the [[vermiform appendix]] or the [[nictitating membrane]].&lt;ref name=sciam/&gt; In some cases, the [[:de:Organisationsstufe|level of organization]] of living creatures can also “shift” downwards (e.g., the [[multicellularity#Evolutionary history|loss of multicellularity]] in some groups of protists and fungi).&lt;ref&gt;Seravin L. N. (2001) The principle of counter-directional morphological evolution and its significance for constructing the megasystem of protists and other eukaryotes. ''Protistology'' 2: 6-14, [http://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/the-principle-of-counter-directional-morphological-evolution-and-its-significance-for-construction-the-megasystem-of-protists-and-other].&lt;/ref&gt;

A more rational version of the concept of devolution, a version that does not involve concepts of "primitive" or "advanced" organisms, is based on the observation that if certain genetic changes in a particular combination (sometimes in a particular sequence as well) are precisely reversed, one should get precise reversal of the evolutionary process, yielding an [[atavism]] or "throwback", whether more or less complex than the ancestors where the process began.&lt;ref&gt;Medawar, P. B., Medawar, J. S.; Aristotle to Zoos: A Philosophical Dictionary of Biology; Harvard University Press 1985, {{ISBN|978-0-674-04537-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a trivial level, where just one or a few mutations are involved, selection pressure in one direction can have one effect, which can be reversed by new patterns of selection when conditions change. That could be seen as reversed evolution, though the concept is not of much interest because it does not differ in any functional or effective way from any other adaptation to selection pressures.&lt;ref&gt;Majerus, Michael E. N. (ed:Fellowes, M, et al.); The Peppered Moth: Decline of a Darwinian Disciple; Insect Evolutionary Ecology (Royal Entomological Society) CABI 2005  {{ISBN|978-0-85199-812-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the number of genetic changes rises however, one combinatorial effect is that it becomes vanishingly unlikely that the full course of adaptation can be reversed precisely. Also, if one of the original adaptations involved complete loss of a gene, one can neglect any probability of reversal. Accordingly, one might well expect reversal of peppered moth colour changes, but not reversal of the loss of limbs in snakes.

==History==
[[File:Bénédict Augustin Morel (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bénédict Morel]] (1809–1873) suggested a link between the environment and [[social degeneration]].]]
{{see|Degeneration theory}}

The concept of degenerative evolution was used by scientists in the 19th century, at this time it was believed by most [[biologists]] that evolution had some kind of direction.

In 1857 the physician [[Bénédict Morel]] influenced by [[Lamarckism]] claimed that environmental factors such as taking [[drugs]] or [[alcohol]] would produce [[social degeneration]] in the offspring of those individuals, and would revert those [[offspring]] to a primitive state.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, James Richard. History, Humanity and Evolution: Essays for John C. Greene, p. 331&lt;/ref&gt; Morel, a devout [[Catholic]], had believed that mankind had started in perfection, contrasting modern humanity to the past, Morel claimed there had been "Morbid deviation from an original type".&lt;ref&gt;Beer, Daniel. Renovating Russia: the human sciences and the fate of liberal modernity, 1880-1930, 2008, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; His theory of devolution was later advocated by some biologists.

According to Roger Luckhurst:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Darwin soothed readers that evolution was progressive, and directed towards human perfectibility. The next generation of biologists were less confident or consoling. Using Darwin's theory, and many rival biological accounts of development then in circulation, scientists suspected that it was just as possible to ''devolve'', to slip back down the evolutionary scale to prior states of development.&lt;ref&gt;Luckhurst, Roger. Late Victorian Gothic tales, 2005, p. 20 [https://books.google.com/books?id=CpTCyV4uD4IC&amp;pg=PR20&amp;dq=Ray+Lankester+devolution&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=dLWdTsq6LYuhOoO6uecE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=Ray%20Lankester%20devolution&amp;f=false Link]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One of the first biologists to suggest devolution was [[Ray Lankester]], he explored the possibility that evolution by [[natural selection]] may in some cases lead to devolution, an example he studied was the regressions in the life cycle of [[sea squirts]]. Lankester discussed the idea of devolution in his book ''Degeneration: A Chapter in Darwinism'' (1880). He was a critic of progressive evolution, pointing out that higher forms existed in the past which have since degenerated into simpler forms. Lankester argued that "if it was possible to evolve, it was also possible to devolve, and that complex organisms could devolve into simpler forms or animals".&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Gregory; Nietzsche, Friedrich Wilhelm. Darwin's Screens: Evolutionary Aesthetics, Time and Sexual Display in the Cinema By Barbara Creed, 2009, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, biology, and metaphor, 2002, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anton Dohrn]] also developed a theory of degenerative evolution based on his studies of [[vertebrates]]. According to Dohrn many [[chordates]] are degenerated because of their environmental conditions. Dohrn claimed [[cyclostomes]] such as [[lampreys]] are degenerate fish as there is no evidence their jawless state is an ancestral feature but is the product of environmental adaptation due to [[parasitism]]. According to Dohrn if cyclotomes would devolve further then they would resemble something like an [[Amphioxus]].&lt;ref&gt;Bowler, Peter J. Life's splendid drama: evolutionary biology and the reconstruction of life's ancestry 1860-1940, 1996, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian of biology [[Peter J. Bowler]] has written that devolution was taken seriously by proponents of [[orthogenesis]] and others in the late 19th century who at this period of time firmly believed that there was a direction in evolution. [[Orthogenesis]] was the belief that evolution travels in internally directed trends and levels. The [[paleontologist]] [[Alpheus Hyatt]] discussed devolution in his work, using the concept of ''racial senility'' as the mechanism of devolution. Bowler defines ''racial senility'' as "an evolutionary retreat back to a state resembling that from which it began."&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter J. Bowler|Bowler, Peter J.]] ''The eclipse of Darwinism: anti-Darwinian evolution theories in the decades around 1900'', 1992, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyatt who studied the [[fossils]] of [[invertebrates]] believed that up to a point [[ammonoids]] developed by regular stages up until a specific level but would later due to unfavourable conditions descend back to a previous level, this according to Hyatt was a form of lamarckism as the degeneration was a direct response to external factors. To Hyatt after the level of degeneration the species would then become extinct, according to Hyatt there was a "phase of youth, a phase of maturity, a phase of senility or degeneration foreshadowing the extinction of a type".&lt;ref&gt;Bowler, Peter J. ''Evolution: the history of an idea'', 1989, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopædia britannica: a dictionary of arts, sciences, literature and general information'', Volume 20, Hugh Chisholm, The Encyclopædia britannica company, 1911, p. 590&lt;/ref&gt; To Hyatt the devolution was predetermined by internal factors which organisms can neither control or reverse. This idea of all evolutionary branches eventually running out of energy and degenerating into [[extinction]] was a pessimistic view of [[evolution]] and was unpopular amongst many scientists of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Bowler, Peter J. Evolution: the history of an idea, 1989, p. 249&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carl H. Eigenmann]] an [[ichthyologist]] wrote ''Cave vertebrates of America: a study in degenerative evolution'' (1909) in which he concluded that [[cave]] [[evolution]] was essentially degenerative.&lt;ref&gt;Romero Diaz, Aldemaro.

==Dollo's law==
{{Main|Dollo's law}}

Complex organs evolve in a lineage over many generations, and once lost they are unlikely to re-evolve.  This observation is sometimes generalized to a hypothesis known as ''Dollo's law'', which states that evolution is not reversible.  This does not mean that similar engineering solutions cannot be found by natural selection. For instance the tail of the [[cetacea]]—whales, dolphins and porpoises which are evolved from formerly land-dwelling mammals—is an adaptation of the spinal column for propulsion in water.  Unlike the tails of the mammal's marine ancestor, the [[Sarcopterygii]], and of the [[teleostei|teleosts]], which move from side to side, the cetacean's tail moves up and down as it flexes its mammalian spine, but the function of the tail in providing propulsion is remarkably similar.

'''Diamond Light Source''' (''"Diamond"'') is the UK's national [[synchrotron]] science facility located at the [[Harwell Science and Innovation Campus]] in [[Oxfordshire]]. Its purpose is to produce [[synchrotron light|intense beams of light]] whose special characteristics are useful in many areas of scientific research. In particular it can be used to investigate the structure and properties of a wide range of materials from [[proteins]] (to provide information for designing new and better drugs), and engineering components (such as a fan blade from an aero-engine&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diamond.ac.uk/Home/Media/LatestNews/02_12_10.html Diamond and Rolls-Royce shine light on world’s biggest synchrotron stage]&lt;/ref&gt;) to conservation of archeological artifacts (for example [[Henry VIII]]'s flagship the [[Mary Rose]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diamond.ac.uk/Home/Media/LatestNews/7February2008.html High-tech conservation solutions for old warship – Diamond Lights Source]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nakeddiscovery.com/downloads/split_individual/09.10.29/Naked_Scientists_Show_09.10.29_4852.mp3 Podcast – Dr Mark Jones from The Mary Rose Trust discusses his research]&lt;/ref&gt;).

== Design, construction and finance ==
[[File:Diamond Light Source building - 3338870 ff7a8854.jpg|thumb|300px|The Diamond Light Source building]]
Following early work during the 1990s, a final design study was completed in 2001 (the so-called '[https://epubs.stfc.ac.uk/work/25071633 Green Book]') by scientists at [[Daresbury Laboratory]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://diamond10.org/timeline/2002-3/] DIAMOND Light Source, 10th Anniversary Blog&lt;/ref&gt; construction then began following the creation of the operating company, DIAMOND Light Source Ltd.

Diamond was built at [[Chilton, Oxfordshire|Chilton]] near [[Didcot]] in [[Oxfordshire]], UK, next to the [[Rutherford Appleton Laboratory]] operated by the [[Science and Technology Facilities Council|Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC)]]. It produced its first user beam towards the end of January 2007, and was formally opened by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] on 19 October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diamond.ac.uk/Home/Media/LatestNews/October2007.html Diamond News: Her Majesty The Queen Officially Opens Diamond Light Source]&lt;/ref&gt;

The facility is operated by Diamond Light Source Ltd,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diamond.ac.uk/Home/About/Company.html Diamond Light Source Ltd] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130707191907/http://www.diamond.ac.uk/Home/About/Company.html |date=2013-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[joint venture]] company established in March 2002. The company receives 86% of its funding from the UK Government (via the STFC) and 14% from the [[Wellcome Trust]]. Diamond cost £260m to build which covered the cost of the synchrotron building, the accelerators inside it, the first seven experimental stations (beamlines) and the adjacent office block, Diamond House. [[Costain Group|Costain Ltd]] constructed the building and the synchrotron hall.
Significant construction achievements to note:

i) The project was completed on time and on budget;

ii) The construction of Diamond was completed with one of the lowest accident rates of a mega project ever completed in the UK. Over 1.4 million [[person-hour]]s were completed during the peak of construction without a single recordable accident.

== The synchrotron ==
Diamond generates [[synchrotron light]] at wavelengths ranging from [[X-rays]] to the [[infrared#Different regions in the infrared|far infrared]]. This is also known as [[synchrotron radiation]] and is the [[electromagnetic radiation]] emitted by charged particles travelling near the [[speed of light]]. It is used in a huge variety of experiments to study the structure and behaviour of many different types of matter.

The particles Diamond uses are [[electron]]s travelling at an energy of 3 [[electronvolt|GeV]] &lt;ref&gt;Equivalent to accelerating them through a voltage of 3 billion Volts; 1 electronvolt is the energy an electron gains when accelerated by a potential difference of 1 Volt.&lt;/ref&gt; round a 561.6 m circumference [[storage ring]]. The ring is not circular, but is shaped as a forty-eight-sided polygon, using a 'double bend achromat' magnet configuration in which two bending magnets are placed in each of 24 cells. As the electrons pass through specially designed magnets at each vertex, their sudden change of direction causes them to emit an exceptionally bright beam of electro-magnetic radiation. This is the synchrotron light used for experiments.

The electrons reach this high energy via a series of pre-accelerator stages before being injected into the 3 GeV storage ring:
* an [[electron gun]] – 90&amp;nbsp;keV
* a 100&amp;nbsp;MeV [[linear accelerator]]
* a 100&amp;nbsp;MeV – 3&amp;nbsp;GeV booster synchrotron (158&amp;nbsp;m in circumference).

The Diamond synchrotron is housed in a silver [[Toroid (geometry)|toroidal]] building of 738m in circumference, covering an area in excess of 43,300 square metres, or the area of over six [[Association football pitch|football pitches]]. This contains the [[storage ring]] and a number of [[beamline]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diamond.ac.uk/Home/Beamlines.html Current list of Diamond Beamlines]&lt;/ref&gt; with the linear accelerator and booster synchrotron housed in the centre of the ring. These beamlines are the experimental stations where the synchrotron light's interaction with matter is used for research purposes.  Seven (Phase I) beamlines were available when Diamond became operational in 2007, with  another fifteen (Phase II) completed over the period 2007–2012. As of January 2013 there were 22 in operation. The Government and the Wellcome Trust have now agreed to fund Phase III of Diamond which will increase the number of operational beamlines to 32 by 2017.

The seven beamlines which were available when Diamond first became operational in January 2007 were:
* extreme conditions beamline for studying materials under intense temperatures and pressures (Beamline I15).
* materials and magnetism beamline, set up to probe electronic and magnetic materials at the atomic level (Beamline I16).
* three [[macromolecule|macromolecular]] [[crystallography]] beamlines, for decoding the structure of complex biological samples, such as [[protein]]s (Beamlines I02, I03 and I04).
* microfocus spectroscopy beamline, able to map the chemical make up of complex materials such as [[moon rocks]] and geological samples (Beamline I18).
* [[nanoscience]] beamline, capable of imaging structures and devices at the scale of a few nanometres (millionths of a millimetre) (Beamline I06).

Phase III of Diamond provides for the design, procurement, construction and commissioning of an additional 10 beamlines to complement those in Phases I and II of Diamond. They will become operational over the period 2013–2017/18.

Diamond is intended ultimately to host up to ~ forty beamlines, supporting the life, physical and environmental sciences.

In 2015, Diamond began the electron Bio-Imaging Centre (eBIC), a UK national facility providing instruments and expertise in the field of [[cryo-electron microscopy]]. Initially, one FEI Titan Krios microscope I was housed in the experimental hall at Diamond. In September 2018, Dr. [[Richard Henderson (biologist)]], the 2017 Nobel Laureate in Chemistry, officially opened eBICs own dedicated facility. Housing four dedicated FEI cryo-electron microscopes for academia as well as two new cryo-electron microscopes and professional cryo-EM services designed exclusively for the pharmaceutical industry.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.selectscience.net/editorial-articles/nobel-prize-winner-in-chemistry-talks-cryo-em-and-its-impact-on-drug?artID=47351&lt;/ref&gt;  Experimental techniques available at this facility include single particle analysis of biological macromolecules, cellular tomography and electron crystallography.

== Case studies ==
* On 13 September 2007, scientists from [[Cardiff University]], led by Professor Tim Wess, found that the Diamond synchrotron could be used to discover hidden content of ancient documents by [[Lighting|illumination]] without opening them (penetrating layers of [[parchment]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6991893.stm  BBC NEWS, 'Super-scope' to see hidden texts]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diamond.ac.uk/Home/Beamlines/small-angle/Case-Studies/casestudy3.html Diamond: Unravelling the secrets of ancient parchments]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In November 2010 the Journal [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] published an article detailing how scientists Goedele Maertens, Stephen Hare &amp; Peter Cherepanov from [[Imperial College London]] used data collected at Diamond to advance the understanding of how HIV and other retroviruses infect human or animal cells.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diamond.ac.uk/Home/Media/LatestNews/10_11_10.html Diamond News: X-rays illuminate the mechanism used by HIV to attack human DNA]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v468/n7321/full/nature09517.html Nature Article: The mechanism of retroviral integration from X-ray structures of its key intermediates]&lt;/ref&gt; The findings may enable improvements in gene therapy to correct gene malfunctions.
* In June 2011 an international team of scientists led by Professor So Iwata published an article in the Journal Nature detailing how using Diamond they had successfully solved the complex 3D structure of the human [[Histamine H1 receptor]] protein. Their discovery opens the way for the development of ‘third generation’ anti-histamines, specific drugs effective against various allergies without causing adverse side-effects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diamond.ac.uk/Home/Media/LatestNews/22_06_11.html Diamond News: Histamine H1 receptor breakthrough heralds improved allergy treatments]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature10236 | volume=475 | title=Structure of the human histamine H1 receptor complex with doxepin | year=2011 | journal=Nature | pages=65–70 | last1 = Shimamura | first1 = Tatsuro| pmc=3131495 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Diamond is a UK National Facility that aims at providing researchers from the UK and the world with synchrotron-based techniques for a wide range of scientific applications.

The name DIAMOND was originally conceived by Mike Poole (the originator of the DIAMOND project) and stood as an acronym meaning '''DI'''pole '''A'''nd '''M'''ultipole '''O'''utput for the '''N'''ation at [[Daresbury Laboratory|'''D'''aresbury]].  With the location of Diamond now being in Oxfordshire, the explanation has been changed, and now derives from that the fact that the light from the synchrotron is both 'hard' (referring to the "hard" X-ray region of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]) and bright, and hence the current name "Diamond" was born).&lt;ref&gt;Private Communications with Prof [[Gerhard Materlik|Gerd Materlik]], CEO of Diamond, and with Mike Poole&lt;/ref&gt;

Diamond is located on the [[Science and Technology Facilities Council|STFC]] [[Rutherford Appleton Laboratory]] site, near to the [[ISIS neutron source|ISIS Neutron and Muon Source]], the Central Laser Facility, and the nearby laboratories at Harwell and Culham (including the [[Joint European Torus]] (JET) project). Diamond was originally due to replace the second-generation synchrotron at Daresbury in Cheshire, however, it was decided to locate the new British synchrotron in Oxfordshire.

The Diamond synchrotron is the largest UK-funded scientific facility to be built in the UK for over 45 years, since the Nimrod proton synchrotron which was sited at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory. In 1977 financial approval was given to convert the Nimrod facility into the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) named [[ISIS neutron source|ISIS]].

There are approximately 70&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lightsources.org/cms/?pid=1000098 ''Lightsources.org'': List of world Synchrotron (Light Source) Facilities]&lt;/ref&gt; ''dedicated'' synchrotron facilities in the world, and Diamond (3&amp;nbsp;GeV) is the world's largest ''medium energy'' synchrotron. Only four dedicated synchrotron facilities in the world are currently larger than Diamond, and all are ''high energy'' machines. These are: i) [[SPring-8]] in Japan (8&amp;nbsp;GeV); ii) The [[European Synchrotron Radiation Facility]] in Grenoble, France (6.03&amp;nbsp;GeV); iii) The [[Advanced Photon Source]] (APS) in Chicago, USA (7&amp;nbsp;GeV); iv) [[DESY]]'s PETRA III (6&amp;nbsp;GeV) in Germany, which is currently the world's largest dedicated synchrotron source.

It is offered by a consortium of nine universities: [[Erasmus University Rotterdam]] (co-ordinating institution), [[University of Hamburg]], [[University of Bologna]], [[University of Ghent]], [[University of Aix-Marseille]], [[University of Vienna]], [[University of Haifa]], [[Warsaw School of Economics]] and the [[Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research]]. Furthermore, the EMLE maintains a link with the [[University of California, Berkeley]] which allows some students to serve as visiting scholars in residence there.

Students who participate in the EMLE Program usually divide their time between two or three of the participating Universities and, depending on their allocations, can receive multiple-degrees from each institution where they have undertaken studies. The partner universities variously award [[LL.M.]], [[M.Sc.]] or [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] degrees. The language of instruction is English, but the master thesis can also be written in another European language.

==History of the programme==

The European Master Programme in Law and Economics started in 1990 at the [[University of Oxford]], [[University of Ghent]], [[Paris Dauphine University]], and [[Erasmus University Rotterdam]] with 20 students from a variety of countries. From the very beginning, the Programme received recognition and financial support of the ERASMUS Bureau of the European Community. The partner universities exchanged multilateral agreements to continue their joint venture and made all the necessary arrangements in order to be included in the new SOCRATES framework between the European Commission and the European universities. The number of partner universities has increased rapidly and the network now comprises seven teaching centres within the EU and two internationally.

==Admission==

Admission to the EMLE is extremely selective. Applicants must have a bachelor’s or master's degree in law or economics with high academic merit. Degrees from related disciplines are also acceptable, provided that the curriculum comprises a significant number of courses in law or economics. Preference is given to applicants who already have a first masters or above, and most admitted students already hold advanced degrees.  The demand for a place in the programme has steadily risen.  Given the increase in the number of applications, the acceptance rate is now consistently below 10%. While most students still come from within the E.U., over 30 other countries are represented in each class.

==Structure==

The European Master Programme in Law and Economics is the primary source of high quality postgraduate education in the field of the economic analysis of law. The EMLE is designed to provide students with advanced knowledge in the Economic Analysis of Law and to allow them to use economic methods to explain and assess the effects of divergent legal rules. Students study introductory courses and core courses on the major topics in the economic analysis of law.

Students also take specialized courses and write a master thesis. The EMLE includes three kinds of courses: Economic Courses, Comparative Law Courses, and Law and Economics Courses.

Students will become competent to work for private companies, public organizations, as economic advisers, or for large multinational law firms. Graduates are also well prepared for research in Law and Economics. Many EMLE graduates now hold teaching positions in European universities.

==Reputation and accreditation==

The EMLE has been recognized as an Erasmus Mundus Masters Course by a panel of independent academic experts and chosen by the Selection Committee out of 128 proposals.{{cn|date=November 2017}} The European Commission has designated the programme of "outstanding academic quality."{{cn|date=November 2017}} The Master in Law and Economics is the only Masters Course in Economics and one of the two Erasmus Mundus Courses in the legal discipline. In 2002, the EMLE Programme was already selected to take part in the Joint Masters Project of the European University Association (together with 10 other networks). In August 2004, the EMLE program in Rotterdam and Ghent was accredited by the NVAO, the [[Accreditation Organisation of the Netherlands and Flanders]]. Also in 2004, The EMLE was also included in the list of the eleven best European Joint Masters by the EUA. In February 2005, the EMLE was accredited by ZEvA, the German Central Evaluation and Accreditation Agency. The EMLE has participated in the TEEP II Project, which is a form of external quality assurance and The TEEP II Committee showed a very high appreciation of the EMLE. The Israeli economic newspaper [[Haaretz]] classified the EMLE programme as "the most elitist integrated Master program"&lt;ref&gt;''Haaretz'', 22 August 2010, Amit Ben - Aroya, "בבוקר משפט מסחרי, בערב שיטוט בפאריס", http://www.themarker.com/law/1.578905&lt;/ref&gt; for law and economics.

==Governance==

The EMLE is organized and governed by Associated Members and a Committee of Patronage, which is composed of public and private research institutions, governmental bodies, law firms and consulting firms, commercial enterprises, and renowned scholars in law and economics.

Associated Members include: [[Deutsche Bundesbank]], [[Deutsche Bank AG]], [[De Nederlandsche Bank]], [[Ernst &amp; Young]], [[Deloitte]], [[White &amp; Case LLP]], [[Covington &amp; Burling LLP]], [[Centre for European Policy Studies]], European Association of Law and Economics, [[RiskMetrics]] Group, Joseph von Sonnenfels Center for the Study of Public Law and Economics, [[Bombay Stock Exchange Limited]], and many other notable institutions.

The Committee of Patronage includes world-leading Professors: [[James M. Buchanan]] ([[Nobel Prize]] Award 1985), [[Ronald Coase]] ([[Nobel Prize]] Award 1991), [[Robert Cooter]] ([[University of California, Berkeley]]), R. Epstein ([[University of Chicago]]), Michael Faure ([[University of Maastricht]]), [[William Landes]] ([[University of Chicago]]), [[Ejan Mackaay]] ([[University of Montréal]]), [[Henry Manne]] (former Dean - [[George Mason University Law School]]), A. Mitchell Polinsky ([[Stanford Law School]]), [[Richard Posner]] ([[University of Chicago]], Chief Judge [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]]), Susan Rose-Ackerman ([[Yale Law School]]), Steven Shavell ([[Harvard Law School]]), Cento Veljanovski (Research &amp; Editorial Director of the [[Institute of Economic Affairs]], London), [[Oliver E. Williamson]] ([[University of California, Berkeley]]), and O. Zerbe, Jr. ([[University of Washington]]).

==The Midterm Meeting==

The first Midterm Meeting of the EMLE took place in Ghent in 1991. Since then the Midterm Meeting of EMLE has grown to be a multi-facetted event, a symposium of lectures and scientific discussion seminars, informal networking and other social activities. This annual event now rotates between Bologna, Ghent and Hamburg, and also serves as the forum for the EMLE graduation ceremonies. The EMLE Midterm Meeting attracts one of the largest groups of Law and Economics scholars in the world and is widely regarded as one of the leading conferences for law and economics.

The '''ecological humanities''' (also '''environmental humanities''') is an interdisciplinary area of research, drawing on the many environmental sub-disciplines that have emerged in the [[humanities]] over the past several decades (in particular environmental literature, environmental philosophy, environmental history and environmental anthropology)&lt;ref&gt;Robin, L., 2018. Environmental humanities and climate change: understanding humans geologically and other life forms ethically. Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Climate Change, 9(1), p.e499.&lt;/ref&gt;. The [[ecological]] humanities aim to help  bridge traditional divides between the sciences and the humanities, and between [[Western culture|Western]], [[Eastern culture|Eastern]] and [[Indigenous peoples|Indigenous]] ways of knowing the natural world and the place of humans in it (Rose 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.australianhumanitiesreview.org/archive/Issue-April-2004/rose.html|title=Rose and Robin, "The Ecological Humanities in Action: An Invitation"|last=Rose|first=Deborah Bird|date=|website=www.australianhumanitiesreview.org|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

The ecological humanities are characterised by a ''connectivity ontology'' and a commitment to two fundamental axioms relating to the need to submit to [[Ecology|ecological]] laws and to see humanity as part of a larger living system&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2017. Demonic geographies. Area. 49(4), pp. 503-509. https://doi.org/10.1111/area.12339 &lt;/ref&gt;.

==Connectivity ontology==
One of the fundamental [[Ontology|ontological]] presuppositions of ecological humanities is that the [[Organic compounds|organic]] world and its [[Inorganic compounds|inorganic]] parts are seen as a single system whereby each part is linked to each other part. This [[world view]] in turn shares an intimate connection with [[Lotka]]'s physiological philosophy and the associated concept of the "World Engine".{{ref|Kingsland1985}} When we see everything as connected, then the traditional questions of the humanities concerning economic and political justice become ''enlarged,'' into a consideration of how [[justice]] is connected with our transformation of our [[Natural environment|environment]] and [[ecosystems]]. The consequence of such a connectivity [[ontology]] is, as proponents of the ecological humanities argue, that we begin to seek out a more inclusive concept of justice that includes non-humans within the domain of those to whom rights are owing. This broadened conception of justice involves "enlarged" or "ecological thinking", which presupposes the enhancement of knowledge sharing within fields of plural and diverse ‘knowledges’. This kind of knowledge sharing is called transdisciplinarity. It has links with the political philosophy of [[Hannah Arendt]] and the works of [[Italo Calvino]]. As Calvino put it, "enlarge[s] the sphere of what we can imagine". It also has connections with Leibniz's Enlightenment project where, the sciences are simultaneously abridged while also being enlarged.{{ref|Rutherford2002}}

The situation is complicated however by the recognition of the fact that connections are both ''non-linear'' and ''linear''. The ecological humanities therefore, require both linear and non-linear modes of language through which reasoning about justice can be done. Thus there is a motivation to find linguistic modes which can adequately express both linear and non-linear connectivities.

==Axioms==

There are three [[axioms]] of ecological humanities:

# The axiom of submission to [[ecological energetics|ecosystem laws]];
# The axiom of ecological kinship, which situates humanity as participant in a larger living system; and 
# The axiom of the social construction of ecosystems and ecological unity, which states that ecosystems and nature may be merely convenient conceptual entities (Marshall, 2002).

Putting the first and second axioms another way, the connections between and among living things are the basis for how ecosystems are understood to work, and thus constitute laws of existence and guidelines for behaviour (Rose 2004)

The first of these axioms has a tradition in social sciences (''see'' Marx, 1968: 3). From the second axiom the notions of "[[Embodied energy|ecological embodiment/ embeddedness]]" and "habitat" have emerged from Political Theory with a fundamental connectivity to rights, democracy and ecologism (Eckersley 1996: 222, 225; Eckersley 1998).

The third axiom comes from the strong 'self-reflective' tradition of all 'humanities' scholarship and it encourages ecological humanities to investigate its own theoretical basis (and without which, ecological humanities is just 'ecology').

==Contemporary ideas==

===Political economic ecology===
{{See also|Political ecology}}

Some theorists have suggested that the inclusion of non-humans in the consideration of justice links ecocentric philosophy with political economics. This is because the theorising of justice is a central activity of political economic philosophy. If in accordance with the axioms of ecological humanities, theories of justice are enlarged to include ecological values then the necessary result is the synthesis of the concerns of ecology with that of political economy: i.e. Political Economic Ecology.

===Energy systems language===
The question of what language can best depict the linear and non-linear causal connections of [[ecosystem|ecological systems]] appears to have been taken up by the school of ecology known as [[systems ecology]]. To depict the linear and non-linear internal relatedness of ecosystems where the laws of thermodynamics hold significant consequences (Hannon et al. 1991: 80), Systems Ecologist H.T. Odum (1994) predicated the [[Energy Systems Language]] on the principles of [[ecological energetics]]. In ecological energetics, just as in ecological humanities, the causal bond between connections is considered an ontic category (see Patten et al. 1976: 460). Moreover, as a result of simulating ecological systems with the energy systems language H.T.Odum make the controversial suggestion that embodied energy could be understood as [[emergy|value]], which in itself is a step into the field of Political Economic Ecology noted above.

An '''electronic symbol''' is a [[pictogram]] used to represent various [[electrical]] and [[Electronics|electronic]] devices or functions, such as [[wire]]s, [[battery (electricity)|batteries]], [[resistor]]s, and [[transistor]]s, in a [[schematic diagram]] of an electrical or [[electronic circuit]].  These symbols are largely standardized internationally today, but may vary from country to country, or engineering discipline, based on traditional conventions.

==Standards for symbols==
The graphic symbols used for electrical components in circuit diagrams are covered by national and international standards, in particular:
* [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 60617 (also known as [[British Standard]] BS 3939).
* [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] Y32.2-1975 (also known as IEEE Std 315-1975 or CSA Z99-1975)
* [[IEEE]] Std 91/91a: graphic symbols for logic functions (used in digital electronics). It is referenced in ANSI Y32.2/IEEE Std 315.
* Australian Standard AS 1102. (Withdrawn without replacement)

Symbols usage is sometimes unique to engineering disciplines and national or local variations to international standards exist. For example, lighting and power symbols used as part of architectural drawings may be different from symbols for devices used in electronics.

[[Fish]] reproductive organs include [[testicle|testes]] and [[ovary|ovaries]]. In most species, [[gonad]]s are [[Bilateria|paired organs]] of similar size, which can be partially or totally fused.&lt;ref name="Guimaraes" /&gt; There may also be a range of secondary organs that increase reproductive fitness. The [[genital papilla]] is a small, fleshy tube behind the [[anus]] in some fishes, from which the [[sperm]] or [[egg]]s are released; the sex of a fish often can be determined by the shape of its papilla.

==Anatomy==

===Testes===
Most male fish have two [[testes]] of similar size. In the case of [[shark]]s, the testes on the right side is usually larger{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}. The primitive [[jawless fish]] have only a single testis, located in the midline of the body, although even this forms from the fusion of paired structures in the embryo.&lt;ref name=VB/&gt;

Under a tough membranous shell, the [[tunica albuginea (testicles)|tunica albuginea]], the testis of some [[teleost]] fish, contains very fine coiled tubes called [[seminiferous tubules]]. The tubules are lined with a layer of cells ([[germ cells]]) that from [[puberty]] into old age, develop into [[sperm]] [[cell (biology)|cells]] (also known as [[spermatozoa]] or male [[gametes]]).  The developing sperm travel through the seminiferous tubules to the [[rete testis]] located in the [[mediastinum testis]], to the [[efferent ducts]], and then to the [[epididymis]] where newly created sperm cells mature (see [[spermatogenesis]]).  The sperm move into the [[vas deferens]], and are eventually expelled through the [[urethra]] and out of the [[External urethral orifice (male)|urethral orifice]] through muscular contractions.

However, most fish do not possess seminiferous tubules. Instead, the sperm are produced in spherical structures called ''sperm ampullae''. These are seasonal structures, releasing their contents during the breeding season, and then being reabsorbed by the body. Before the next breeding season, new sperm ampullae begin to form and ripen. The ampullae are otherwise essentially identical to the seminiferous tubules in [[higher vertebrates]], including the same range of cell types.&lt;ref name=VB&gt;{{cite book |author=Romer, Alfred Sherwood|author2=Parsons, Thomas S.|year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 385–386|isbn= 978-0-03-910284-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of [[spermatogonia]] distribution, the structure of [[teleost]]s [[testes]] has two types: in the most common, spermatogonia occur all along the [[seminiferous tubule]]s, while in Atherinomorph fish they are confined to the [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|distal]] portion of these structures. Fish can present cystic or semi-cystic [[spermatogenesis]] in relation to the release phase of germ cells in cysts to the seminiferous tubules [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]].&lt;ref name="Guimaraes"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guimaraes-Cruz, Rodrigo J.|author2=Santos, José E. dos|author3=Santos, Gilmar B.|title=Gonadal structure and gametogenesis of ''Loricaria lentiginosa'' Isbrücker (Pisces, Teleostei, Siluriformes)|journal=Rev.

===Ovaries===
[[File:Torskens indre organer.jpg|thumb|right|{{center|3. [[Ovary]] of a female [[Atlantic cod]]}}]]

Many of the features found in [[ovaries]] are common to all vertebrates, including the presence of [[follicular cell]]s and [[Tunica albuginea (ovaries)|tunica albuginea]] There may be hundreds or even millions of fertile eggs present in the ovary of a fish at any given time. Fresh eggs may be developing from the [[Germinal epithelium (female)|germinal epithelium]] throughout life. [[Corpora lutea]] are found only in mammals, and in some [[elasmobranch]] fish; in other species, the remnants of the follicle are quickly resorbed by the ovary.&lt;ref name=VB/&gt; The ovary of [[teleost]]s is often contains a hollow, [[lymph]]-filled space which opens into the [[oviduct]], and into which the eggs are shed.&lt;ref name=VB/&gt; Most normal female fish have two ovaries.  In some [[elasmobranch]]s, only the right ovary develops fully. In the primitive [[jawless fish]], and some teleosts, there is only one ovary, formed by the fusion of the paired organs in the embryo.&lt;ref name=VB/&gt;

Fish ovaries may be of three types: gymnovarian, secondary gymnovarian or cystovarian. In the first type, the [[oocyte]]s are released directly into the [[coelom]]ic cavity and then enter the [[Ostium of Fallopian tube|ostium]], then through the [[oviduct]] and are eliminated. Secondary gymnovarian ovaries shed [[Ovum|ova]] into the [[coelom]] from which they go directly into the oviduct. In the third type, the oocytes are conveyed to the exterior through the [[oviduct]].&lt;ref name="Brito"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0102-09352003000500018|title=Reproduction of the surubim catfish (Pisces, Pimelodidae) in the São Francisco River, Pirapora Region, Minas Gerais, Brazil|last=Brito|first=M.F.G.|author2=Bazzoli, N.|journal=Arquivo Brasileiro de Medicina Veterinária e Zootecnia|volume=55|issue=5|year=2003|doi=10.1590/S0102-09352003000500018|issn=0102-0935|pages=624–633}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gymnovaries are the primitive condition found in [[lungfish]], [[sturgeon]], and [[bowfin]]. Cystovaries characterize most teleosts, where the ovary lumen has continuity with the oviduct.&lt;ref name="Guimaraes" /&gt; Secondary gymnovaries are found in [[salmonid]]s and a few other teleosts.

The eggs of fish and [[amphibian]]s are jellylike. [[Chondrichthyes|Cartilagenous fish]] (sharks, skates, rays, chimaeras) eggs are fertilized internally and exhibit a wide variety of both internal and external embryonic development. Most fish species spawn eggs that are fertilized externally, typically with the male inseminating the eggs after the female lays them. These eggs do not have a shell and would dry out in the air. Even air-breathing amphibians lay their eggs in water, or in protective foam as with the Coast foam-nest treefrog, ''[[Chiromantis xerampelina]]''.

}}

Male [[cartilaginous fish]]es (sharks and rays), as well as the males of some live-bearing [[ray finned fish]]es, have fins that have been modified to function as [[intromittent organ]]s, reproductive appendages which allow [[internal fertilization]]. In ray finned fish they are called ''gonopodiums'' or ''andropodiums'', and in cartilaginous fish they are called ''claspers''.

''Gonopodia'' are found on the males of some species in the [[Anablepidae]] and [[Poeciliidae]] families. They are anal fins that have been modified to function as movable intromittent organs and are used to impregnate females with [[milt]] during mating.  The third, fourth and fifth rays of the male's anal fin are formed into a tube-like structure in which the sperm of the fish is ejected.&lt;ref&gt;Kapoor BG and Khanna B (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=I7WhoPBdAooC&amp;pg=PA498&amp;lpg=PA498 ''Ichthyology Handbook''] pp. 497–498, Springer Science &amp; Business Media. {{ISBN|9783540428541}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When ready for mating, the gonopodium becomes erect and points forward towards the female. The male shortly inserts the organ into the sex opening of the female, with hook-like adaptations that allow the fish to grip onto the female to ensure impregnation. If a female remains stationary and her partner contacts her vent with his gonopodium, she is fertilized. The sperm is preserved in the female's oviduct. This allows females to fertilize themselves at any time without further assistance from males. In some species, the gonopodium may be half the total body length. Occasionally the fin is too long to be used, as in the "lyretail" breeds of ''[[Xiphophorus helleri]]''. Hormone treated females may develop gonopodia. These are useless for breeding.

Similar organs with similar characteristics are found in other fishes, for example the ''andropodium'' in the ''[[Hemirhamphodon]]'' or in the [[Goodeidae]].&lt;ref&gt;Helfman G, Collette BB, Facey DH and Bowen BW (2009) [http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/helfman/ ''The Diversity of Fishes: Biology, Evolution, and Ecology''] p. 35, Wiley-Blackwell. {{ISBN|978-1-4051-2494-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Clasper]]s'' are found on the males of [[cartilaginous fish]]es. They are the posterior part of the pelvic fins that have also been modified to function as intromittent organs, and are used to channel semen into the female's [[cloaca]] during copulation. The act of mating in sharks usually includes raising one of the claspers to allow water into a siphon through a specific [[Body orifice|orifice]].  The clasper is then inserted into the cloaca, where it opens like an umbrella to anchor its position. The siphon then begins to contract expelling water and sperm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fishbase.org/Glossary/Glossary.php?q=clasper&amp;language=english&amp;sc=is |title=System glossary |work=FishBase |accessdate=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Timetree of Life: Cartilaginous Fishes (Chondrichthyes) |last=Heinicke |first=Matthew P. |last2=Naylor |first2=Gavin J.

==Physiology==
[[Oogonia]] development in teleosts fish varies according to the group, and the determination of oogenesis dynamics allows the understanding of maturation and fertilisation processes. Changes in the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]], ooplasm, and the surrounding layers characterize the oocyte maturation process.&lt;ref name="Guimaraes"/&gt;

Postovulatory [[Ovarian follicle|follicle]]s are structures formed after oocyte release; they do not have [[endocrine]] function, present a wide irregular lumen, and are rapidly reabsorbed in a process involving the [[apoptosis]] of follicular cells. A degenerative process called [[follicular atresia]] reabsorbs vitellogenic oocytes not spawned. This process can also occur, but less frequently, in oocytes in other development stages.&lt;ref name="Guimaraes" /&gt;

Some fish are [[hermaphrodite]]s, having both testes and ovaries either at different phases in their life cycle or, as in [[hamlet (fish)|hamlets]], have them simultaneously.

==Reproductive strategies==
{{further|Modes of reproduction|Spawning|Ichthyoplankton|Pregnancy in fish}}

In fish, fertilisation of eggs can be either external or internal.  In many species of fish, fins have been modified to allow [[Fish fin#Internal fertilization|Internal fertilisation]].  Similarly, development of the embryo can be external or internal, although some species show a change between the two at various stages of embryo development. [[Thierry Lodé]]  described reproductive strategies in terms of the development of the zygote and the interrelationship with the parents; there are five classifications - ovuliparity, oviparity, ovo-viviparity, histotrophic viviparity and hemotrophic viviparity.&lt;ref name=Lode2012&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Reproductive Biology |volume=12 |issue=3 |year=2012 |pages=259–264 |title=Oviparity or viviparity? That is the question… |author=Lodé, T. |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1642431X12000022 |accessdate=November 4, 2014 |doi=10.1016/j.repbio.2012.09.001|pmid=23153695 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ovuliparity===
Ovuliparity means the female lays unfertilised eggs (ova), which must then be externally fertilised.&lt;ref name=Lode2012/&gt; Examples of ovuliparous fish include [[salmon]], [[goldfish]], [[cichlid]]s, [[tuna]] and [[eel]]s. In the majority of these species, fertilisation takes place outside the mother's body, with the male and female fish shedding their [[gamete]]s into the surrounding water.

===Oviparity===
{{main|Oviparity}}
Oviparity is where fertilisation occurs internally and so the female sheds zygotes (or newly developing embryos) into the water,&lt;ref name=Lode2012/&gt; often with important outer tissues added. Over 97% of all known fish are [[oviparous]].&lt;ref name="Scott"&gt;Peter Scott: ''Livebearing Fishes'', p. 13. Tetra Press 1997. {{ISBN|1-56465-193-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In oviparous fish, internal fertilisation requires the male to use some sort of [[Ichthyology terms#I|intromittent organ]] to deliver sperm into the genital opening of the female.  Examples include the oviparous sharks, such as the [[horn shark]], and oviparous rays, such as [[Skate (fish)|skate]]s. In these cases, the male is equipped with a pair of modified [[pelvic]] fins known as [[claspers]].

Marine fish can produce high numbers of eggs which are often released into the open water column. The eggs have an average diameter of {{convert|1|mm}}. The eggs are generally surrounded by the [[extraembryonic membrane]]s but do not develop a shell, hard or soft, around these membranes. Some fish have thick, leathery coats, especially if they must withstand physical force or desiccation. These type of eggs can also be very small and fragile.

&lt;gallery&gt;

File:Oeufs002b,55.png|Egg of [[bullhead shark]]
File:Oeufs002b,56.png|Egg of [[chimaera]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The newly hatched young of oviparous fish are called [[larva]]e. They are usually poorly formed, carry a large [[yolk sac]] (for nourishment) and are very different in appearance from juvenile and adult specimens. The larval period in oviparous fish is relatively short (usually only several weeks), and larvae rapidly grow and change appearance and structure (a process termed [[metamorphosis]]) to become juveniles. During this transition larvae  must switch from their yolk sac to feeding on [[zooplankton]] prey, a process which depends on typically inadequate zooplankton density, starving many larvae.

===Ovoviviparity===
{{main|Ovoviviparity}}
In [[ovoviviparous]] fish the eggs develop inside the mother's body after internal fertilisation but receive little or no nourishment directly from the mother, depending instead on a food reserve inside the egg, the [[yolk]].&lt;ref name=Lode2012/&gt; Each embryo develops in its own egg. Familiar examples of ovoviviparous fish include [[Guppy|guppies]], [[angel shark]]s, and [[coelacanth]]s.

===Viviparity===
{{main|Viviparity}}
There are two types of [[viviparity]], differentiated by how the offspring gain their nutrients.

* Histotrophic (tissue eating) viviparity means embryos develop in the female's oviducts but obtain nutrients by consuming other tissues, such as ova ([[oophagy]]) or zygotes.&lt;ref name=Lode2012/&gt; This has been observed primarily among sharks such as the [[shortfin mako]] and [[porbeagle]], but is known for a few bony fish as well such as the [[halfbeak]] ''[[Nomorhamphus ebrardtii]]''.&lt;ref name="Meisner"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Meisner | first1 = A | last2 = Burns | first2 = J | year = 1997 | title = Viviparity in the Halfbeak Genera ''Dermogenys'' and ''Nomorhamphus'' (Teleostei: Hemiramphidae) | url = | journal = Journal of Morphology | volume = 234 | issue = 3| pages = 295–317 | doi=10.1002/(sici)1097-4687(199712)234:3&lt;295::aid-jmor7&gt;3.3.co;2-p| pmid = 29852651 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An unusual mode of vivipary is adelphophagy or [[intrauterine cannibalism]], in which the largest embryos eat weaker, smaller unborn siblings. This is most commonly found among sharks such as the [[grey nurse shark]], but has also been reported for ''Nomorhamphus ebrardtii''.&lt;ref name="Meisner" /&gt;
* Hemotrophic (blood eating) viviparity means embryos develop in the female's (or male's) oviduct and nutrients are provided directly by the parent, typically via a structure similar to, or analogous to the [[placenta]] seen in [[placentalia|mammals]].&lt;ref name=Lode2012/&gt; Examples of hemotrophic fish include the [[surfperch]]es, [[Goodeidae|splitfins]], [[lemon shark]], [[seahorse]]s and [[pipefish]].

[[Fishkeeping|Aquarists]] commonly refer to ovoviviparous and viviparous fish as [[livebearers]].

{{main|Hermaphroditism}}

[[Hermaphroditism]] occurs when a given individual in a species possesses both male and female reproductive organs, or can alternative between possessing first one, and then the other. Hermaphroditism is common in invertebrates but rare in vertebrates. It can be contrasted with [[gonochorism]], where each individual in a species is either male or female, and remains that way throughout their lives. Most fish are gonochorists, but hermaphroditism is known to occur in 14 families of [[teleost]] fishes.&lt;ref name="Shapiro1984"&gt;Shapiro DY (1984) "Sex reversal and sociodemographics processes in coral reef fishes" Pages 103–116 in GW Potts and RK Wootoon, eds., ''Fish reproduction: Strategies and tactics'', Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually hermaphrodites are ''[[Sequential hermaphroditism|sequential]]'', meaning they can [[Sex change|switch sex]], usually from female to male ([[protogyny]]). This can happen if a dominant male is removed from a group of females. The largest female in the harem can switch sex over a few days and replace the dominant male.&lt;ref name="Shapiro1984" /&gt; This is found amongst [[coral reef fish]]es such as [[grouper]]s, [[parrotfish]]es and [[wrass]]es. It is less common for a male to switch to a female ([[protandry]]).&lt;ref name="Moyle&amp;Cech"&gt;Moyle PB and Cech JJ (2004) ''Fishes, An Introduction to Ichthyology.'' 5th Ed, Benjamin Cummings. {{ISBN|978-0-13-100847-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|162}} As an example, most [[wrasse]]s are [[protogynous]] hermaphrodites within a haremic mating system.&lt;ref name="Robertson1978"&gt;{{Cite journal

The [[mangrove rivulus]] ''Kryptolebias marmoratus'' produces both eggs and sperm by [[meiosis]] and routinely reproduces by self-fertilization.  Each individual [[hermaphrodite]] normally fertilizes itself when an egg and sperm that it has produced by an internal organ unite inside the fish's body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sakakura | first1 = Y. | last2 = Soyano | first2 = K. | last3 = Noakes | first3 = D.L.G. | last4 = Hagiwara | first4 = A. | year = 2006 | title = Gonadal morphology in the self-fertilizing mangrove killifish, Kryptolebias marmoratus | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10228-006-0362-2#/page-1 | journal = Ichthyological Research | volume = 53 | issue = 4| pages = 427–430 | doi=10.1007/s10228-006-0362-2| hdl = 10069/35713 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   In nature, this mode of reproduction can yield highly [[Zygosity#Homozygous|homozygous]] lines composed of individuals so genetically uniform as to be, in effect, identical to one another.&lt;ref name=Avise&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Avise JC, Tatarenkov A |title=Allard's argument versus Baker's contention for the adaptive significance of selfing in a hermaphroditic fish |journal=Proc.

Although [[inbreeding]], especially in the extreme form of self-fertilization, is ordinarily regarded as detrimental because it leads to expression of deleterious recessive alleles, self-fertilization does provide the benefit of ''fertilization assurance'' (reproductive assurance) at each generation.&lt;ref name=Avise /&gt;

===Sexual parasitism===

Sexual parasitism is a mode of [[sexual reproduction]], unique to [[anglerfish]], in which the males of a species are much smaller than the females, and rely on the females for food and protection from predators.  The males give nothing back except the [[sperm]] which the females need in order to produce the next generation.

Some anglerfish, like those of the deep sea [[Ceratiidae|ceratioid]] group, employ this unusual mating method. Because individuals are very thinly distributed, encounters are also very rare. Therefore, finding a mate is problematic. When scientists first started capturing ceratioid anglerfish, they noticed that all the specimens were female. These individuals were a few centimetres in size and almost all of them had what appeared to be [[Parasitism|parasites]] attached to them. It turned out that these "parasites" were highly reduced male ceratioid anglerfish. This indicates the anglerfish use a [[polyandry|polyandrous]] mating system.

The methods by which the anglerfish locate mates are variable. Some species have minute eyes unfit for identifying females, while others have underdeveloped nostrils, making it unlikely that they effectively find females using olfaction.&lt;ref name=Pietsch&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pietsch|first=Theodore W.|title=Dimorphism, parasitism, and sex revisited: modes of reproduction among deep-sea ceratioid anglerfishes (Teleostei: Lophiiformes)|journal=Ichthyological Research|date=25 August 2005|volume=52|issue=3|pages=207–236|doi=10.1007/s10228-005-0286-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When a male finds a female, he bites into her skin, and releases an [[enzyme]] that digests the skin of his mouth and her body, fusing the pair down to the blood-vessel level.&lt;ref name="gould"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gould |first1=Stephen Jay |title=Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes |year=1983 |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company |location=New York |isbn=978-0-393-01716-8 |page= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The male becomes dependent on the female host for survival by receiving nutrients via their now-shared circulatory system, and provides sperm to the female in return. After fusing, males increase in volume and become much larger relative to free-living males of the species. They live and remain reproductively functional as long as the female stays alive, and can take part in multiple spawnings.&lt;ref name=Pietsch /&gt; This extreme [[sexual dimorphism]] ensures that when the female is ready to spawn she has a mate immediately available.&lt;ref name="doran"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v256/n5512/abs/256038a0.html | author = Theodore W.

One explanation for the [[evolution]] of sexual parasitism is that the relative low density of females in deep-sea environments leaves little opportunity for mate choice among anglerfish. Females remain large to accommodate [[fecundity]], as is evidenced by their large ovaries and eggs. Males would be expected to shrink to reduce metabolic costs in resource-poor environments and would develop highly specialized female-finding abilities. If a male manages to find a female parasitic attachment, then it is ultimately more likely to improve lifetime fitness relative to free living, particularly when the prospect of finding future mates is poor. An additional advantage to parasitism is that the male's sperm can be used in multiple fertilizations, as he stays always available to the female for mating. Higher densities of male-female encounters might correlate with species that demonstrate [[facultative]] parasitism or simply use a more traditional temporary contact mating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miya|first=Masaki|author2=Pietsch, Theodore W |author3=Orr, James W |author4=Arnold, Rachel J |author5=Satoh, Takashi P |author6=Shedlock, Andrew M |author7=Ho, Hsuan-Ching |author8=Shimazaki, Mitsuomi |author9=Yabe, Mamoru |author10= Nishida, Mutsumi |title=Evolutionary history of anglerfishes (Teleostei: Lophiiformes): a mitogenomic perspective|journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology|date=1 January 2010|volume=10|issue=1|pages=58|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-10-58|pmid=20178642|pmc=2836326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parthenogenesis===
{{main|Parthenogenesis}}

[[Parthenogenesis]] is a form of [[asexual reproduction]] in which growth and development of [[embryos]] occur without [[fertilization]]. In animals, parthenogenesis means development of an embryo from an unfertilized [[Gametophyte|egg cell]]. The first all-female (unisexual) reproduction in [[vertebrates]] was described in the ''[[Amazon molly]]'' in 1932.&lt;ref name=Hubbs&amp;Hubbs1932&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hubbs|first=C. L.|author2=Hubbs, L. C.|title=Apparent parthenogenesis in nature, in a form of fish of hybrid origin|journal=Science|year=1932|volume=76|issue=1983|pages=628–630|doi=10.1126/science.76.1983.628|pmid=17730035|bibcode = 1932Sci....76..628H }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then at least 50 species of unisexual vertebrate have been described, including at least 20 fish, 25 lizards, a single snake species, frogs, and salamanders.&lt;ref name=UnisexualList&gt;Vrijenhoek, R.C., R.M. Dawley, C.J. Cole, and J.P. Bogart. 1989. A list of the known unisexual vertebrates, pp. 19-23 ''in'': Evolution and Ecology of Unisexual Vertebrates. R.M. Dawley and J.P. Bogart (eds.) Bulletin 466, New York State Museum, Albany, New York&lt;/ref&gt; As with all types of asexual reproduction, there are both costs (low genetic diversity and therefore susceptibility to adverse mutations that might occur) and benefits (reproduction without the need for a male) associated with parthenogenesis.

A special case of parthenogenesis is [[gynogenesis]]. In this type of reproduction, offspring are produced by the same mechanism as in parthenogenesis, however, the egg is stimulated to develop simply by the ''presence'' of [[sperm]] - the sperm cells do not contribute any genetic material to the offspring. Because gynogenetic species are all female, activation of their eggs requires mating with males of a closely related species for the needed stimulus. The [[Amazon molly]], (pictured), reproduces by gynogenesis.

===Others===
The elkhorn sculpin (''[[Alcichthys elongatus]]'') is a marine teleost with a unique reproductive mode called “internal gametic association”. Sperm are introduced into the ovary by copulation and then enter the micropylar canal of ovulated eggs in the ovarian cavity.  However, actual sperm-egg fusion does not occur until the eggs have been released into sea water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Experimental Zoology|volume=292|issue=2|pages=145–155|year=2002|author=Koya, Y., Munehara, H. and Takano, K.|title=Sperm storage and motility in the ovary of the marine sculpin Alcichthys alcicornis (Teleostei: Scorpaeniformes), with internal gametic association|doi=10.1002/jez.1150|pmid=11754030}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inbreeding==

===Inbreeding depression===

The effect of [[inbreeding]] on reproductive behavior was studied in the [[Poeciliidae|poeciliid]] fish ''Heterandria formosa''.&lt;ref name="pmid19486236"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ala-Honkola O, Uddström A, Pauli BD, Lindström K |title=Strong inbreeding depression in male mating behaviour in a poeciliid fish |journal=J. Evol. Biol. |volume=22 |issue=7 |pages=1396–406 |year=2009 |pmid=19486236 |doi=10.1111/j.1420-9101.2009.01765.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One generation of full-sib mating was found to decrease reproductive performance and likely reproductive success of male progeny.  Other traits that displayed [[inbreeding depression]] were offspring viability and maturation time of both males and females.

Exposure of zebra fish to a chemical environmental agent, analogous to that caused by anthropogenic pollution, amplified the effects of inbreeding on key reproductive traits.&lt;ref name="pmid23798977"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bickley LK, Brown AR, Hosken DJ, Hamilton PB, Le Page G, Paull GC, Owen SF, Tyler CR |title=Interactive effects of inbreeding and endocrine disruption on reproduction in a model laboratory fish |journal=Evol Appl |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=279–89 |year=2013 |pmid=23798977 |pmc=3689353 |doi=10.1111/j.1752-4571.2012.00288.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Embryo viability was significantly reduced in inbred exposed fish and there was a tendency for inbred males to sire fewer offspring.

The behaviors of juvenile [[Coho salmon]] with either low or medium inbreeding were compared in paired contests.&lt;ref name="pmid16189545"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gallardo JA, Neira R |title=Environmental dependence of inbreeding depression in cultured Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch): aggressiveness, dominance and intraspecific competition |journal=Heredity (Edinb) |volume=95 |issue=6 |pages=449–56 |year=2005 |pmid=16189545 |doi=10.1038/sj.hdy.6800741 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fish with low inbreeding showed almost twice the aggressive pursuit in defending territory than fish with medium inbreeding, and furthermore had a higher specific growth rate.  A significant effect of [[inbreeding depression]] on juvenile survival was also found, but only in high-density competitive environments, suggesting that intra-specific competition can magnify the deleterious effects of inbreeding.

===Inbreeding avoidance===

Inbreeding ordinarily has negative fitness consequences (inbreeding depression), and as a result species have evolved mechanisms to avoid inbreeding.  Numerous [[inbreeding avoidance]] mechanisms operating prior to mating have been described.  However, inbreeding avoidance mechanisms that operate subsequent to copulation are less well known.  In guppies, a post-copulatory mechanism of inbreeding avoidance occurs based on competition between sperm of rival males for achieving [[fertilisation]].&lt;ref name=Fitzpatrick&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fitzpatrick JL, Evans JP |title=Postcopulatory inbreeding avoidance in guppies |journal=J. Evol. Biol. |volume=27 |issue=12 |pages=2585–94 |year=2014 |pmid=25387854 |doi=10.1111/jeb.12545 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In competitions between sperm from an unrelated male and from a full sibling male, a significant bias in paternity towards the unrelated male was observed.&lt;ref name=Fitzpatrick /&gt;

Inbreeding depression is considered to be due largely to the expression of [[Zygosity#Homozygous|homozygous]] deleterious recessive mutations.&lt;ref name="pmid19834483"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Charlesworth D, Willis JH |title=The genetics of inbreeding depression |journal=Nat.

[[File:Frai de poissons rouges anim.gif|thumb|right|Female [[goldfish]] spawn (discharge) eggs into the water, encouraged by male goldfish who simultaneously discharge sperm which externally fertilizes the eggs]]
[[File:Goldfishfry.JPG|thumb|right|Within two or three days, the vulnerable goldfish eggs hatch into [[larva]]e, and rapidly develop into fry]]

;Goldfish
[[Goldfish]], like all [[cyprinid]]s, are egg-layers. They usually start breeding after a significant temperature change, often in spring. Males chase females, prompting them to release their eggs by bumping and nudging them. As the female goldfish spawns her eggs, the male goldfish stays close behind fertilizing them. Their eggs are adhesive and attach to aquatic vegetation. The eggs hatch within 48 to 72 hours. Within a week or so, the fry begins to assume its final shape, although a year may pass before they develop a mature goldfish colour; until then they are a metallic brown like their wild ancestors. In their first weeks of life, the fry grow quickly—an adaptation born of the high risk of getting devoured by the adult goldfish.

;Carp

A member of the Cyprinidae, carp spawn in times between April and August, largely dependent upon the climate and conditions they live in. Oxygen levels of the water, availability of food, size of each fish, age, number of times the fish has spawned before and water temperature are all factors known to effect when and how many eggs each carp will spawn at any one time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.carp.me.uk {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110321205019/http://www.carp.me.uk/ |date=2011-03-21 }} Carp Spawning Information&lt;/ref&gt;

;Siamese fighting fish
Prior to spawning, male [[Siamese fighting fish]] build [[bubble nest]]s of varying sizes at the surface of the water. When a male becomes interested in a female, he will flare his gills, twist his body, and spread his fins. The female darkens in colour and curves her body back and forth. The act of spawning takes place in a "nuptial embrace" where the male wraps his body around the female, each embrace resulting in the release of 10-40 eggs until the female is exhausted of eggs. The male, from his side, releases [[milt]] into the water and fertilization takes place externally. During and after spawning, the male uses his mouth to retrieve sinking eggs and deposit them in the bubble nest (during mating the female sometimes assists her partner, but more often she will simply devour all the eggs that she manages to catch). Once the female has released all of her eggs, she is chased away from the male's territory, as it is likely that she'll eat the eggs due to hunger.&lt;ref&gt;Leong, Paul (2004). {{cite web |url=http://www.cbsbettas.org/doc/articles/Tips_on_Spawning_Bettas.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302133251/http://www.cbsbettas.org/doc/articles/Tips_on_Spawning_Bettas.htm |archivedate=2009-03-02 |df= }}. Retrieved on March 13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The eggs then remain in the male's care. He keeps them in the bubble nest, making sure none fall to the bottom and repairing the nest as needed. Incubation lasts for 24–36 hours, and the newly hatched larvae remain in the nest for the next 2–3 days, until their yolk sacs are fully absorbed. Afterwards the fry leave the nest and the free-swimming stage begins.&lt;ref&gt;Rainwate FL and Miller EJ (1967) [http://digital.library.okstate.edu/oas/oas_pdf/v47/p98_114.pdf "Courtship and reproductive behavior of the Siamese fighting fish, ''Betta splendens Regan''"] ''Proceedings of the Oklahoma  Academy of Science'', Oklahoma State University.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''FOSS''' ('''Full-Option Science System''') is a research-based science curriculum for grades K—8 developed at the [[Lawrence Hall of Science]], [[University of California, Berkeley]]. FOSS is also an ongoing research project dedicated to improving the learning and teaching of science.

==History==
The FOSS K–8 program was developed at the [[Lawrence Hall of Science]], [[University of California at Berkeley]], under three separate [[National Science Foundation]] grants (1988&lt;ref&gt;FOSS Grades 3–6, NSF Grant MDR-8751727, July 1988 to March 1992&lt;/ref&gt; 1991,&lt;ref&gt;FOSS Grades K–2, NSF Grant MDR-9150097, July 1991 to Dec. 1994&lt;/ref&gt; 1996.&lt;ref&gt;FOSS for Middle School, NSF Grant ESI-9553600, Sept. 1996 to Aug. 2002&lt;/ref&gt;)  The program was originally developed and trial tested in urban and suburban [[San Francisco Bay Area]] school districts and field-tested and implemented nationally in ten sites.  Twenty-six modules were developed for K–6, and nine courses for middle school. The FOSS K–6 program went through a major revision in 2000 and was then adopted in Texas. The program went through a minor revision in 2005. A new, California specific, edition was developed for the California science adoption (K–5) in 2007. FOSS is currently published by Delta Education, a division of School Specialty Inc.

==Pedagogy==
The FOSS program uses several instructional pedagogies: [[inquiry-based learning]] (each investigation is guided by questions), hands-on learning and active investigation (students work with materials and conduct investigations to attempt to answer questions), student-to-student interaction, writing (students keep careful notes in science notebooks), and research/reading (readings are included to enhance or underscore active investigation—students work with materials prior to doing any reading).

==Components==
Each K–6 module consists of a kit of student materials, a teacher guide, and a student reading book. Each middle school course includes a kit of student materials, a teacher guide, a Science Resources book, a lab notebook, and a course-specific multimedia component. The FOSS website, FOSSweb, contains additional online activities for students and resources for parents and teachers. FOSSweb has two sister sites, FOSSweb CA, for the California 2007 edition, and FOSSweb NYC, for New York City teachers using FOSS.

==Program Use and Adoption==
FOSS is in use in every state in the country with over 100,000 teachers and 2 million students and is in approximately 16% of the nation's school districts.  FOSS was the first non-textbook curriculum to make the California adoption list (1992) and was adopted in California for the 2007 science adoption (FOSS California K–5).  The program is on many state adoption lists and is used in 50 of the 100 largest U.S. school districts.  FOSS is cited as an exemplary program in publications by nationally recognized organizations in the science reform movement, including National Science Resources Center,&lt;ref&gt;Resources for Teaching Elementary Science, 1996; Science for All Children, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[National Science Teachers Association]].&lt;ref&gt;Pathways to the National Standards, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

FOSS has been approved as a recommended science program in each of the adoption states in which it has been submitted.

In the [[Embryogenesis|development]] of [[Vertebrate|vertebrate animals]], the '''functional matrix hypothesis''' is a phenomenological description of bone growth.  It proposes that "the origin, development and maintenance of all skeletal units are secondary, compensatory and mechanically obligatory responses to temporally and operationally prior demands of related functional matrices."&lt;ref&gt;Salentijn, L. ''Functional anatomy of the head and neck'', [[Columbia University College of Dental Medicine]] post-graduate dental lecture series, 2009{{vs|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fundamental basis for this hypothesis, laid out by [[Columbia University College of Dental Medicine|Columbia]] [[Human anatomy|anatomy]] professor [[Melvin Moss]]  is that bones do not ''grow'' but ''are grown'',&lt;ref&gt;Fonseca, Raymond J. [https://books.google.com/books?id=XjLdFSotfiEC&amp;pg=PA246&amp;lpg=PA246&amp;dq=functional+matrix+theory&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EDL48mQFLi&amp;sig=bzpqlQ9rJ9DTl3PUp0Xs26fw52g&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=GACvSvP_J422lAeBr7XmBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8#v=onepage&amp;q=functional%20matrix%20theory&amp;f=false Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Volume 6], p 246.&lt;/ref&gt; thus stressing the [[ontogeny|ontogenetic]] primacy of function over form.&lt;ref name="FHA"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Moss ML |title=The functional matrix hypothesis revisited. 3.

The theory was introduced as a chapter in a dental textbook in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'' [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/29/nyregion/29moss.html Dr. Melvin Moss, 83, Theorist on How Bones of Face Grow, Is Dead], June 29, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

'''High production volume chemicals''', also referred to as HPV chemicals, are produced or imported into the United States in quantities of 1 million pounds or 500 tons per year.&lt;ref name=EPA /&gt; In [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development#Member countries|OECD countries]], HPV chemicals are defined as being produced at levels greater than 1,000 metric tons per producer/importer per year in at least one member country/region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 2004 OECD List of High Production Volume Chemicals Environment Directorate|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/55/38/33883530.pdf|publisher=OECD|accessdate=13 March 2014|pages=143|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A list of HPV chemicals serves as an overall priority list, from which chemicals are selected to gather data for a [[screening Information Dataset|screening information dataset]] (SIDS), for testing and for initial [[hazard]] assessment.

==History==

===OECD countries including EU===
In 1987, member countries of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] decided to investigate existing chemicals. In 1991, they agreed to begin by focusing on High production volume (HPV) chemicals, where production volume was used as a [[surrogate endpoint|surrogate]] for data on occupational, consumer, and [[environmental exposure]].&lt;ref&gt;(OECD Council Acts, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; Each country agreed to "sponsor" the assessment of a proportion of the HPV chemicals. Countries also agreed on a minimum set of required information, the [[Screening Information Dataset|screening information dataset]] (SIDS). Six tests are: [[acute toxicity]], [[chronic toxicity]], [[developmental toxicity]]/[[reproductive toxicity]], [[mutagenicity]], [[ecotoxicity]] and environmental fate.  Using SIDS and detailed exposure data OECD's [[High Production Volume Chemicals Programme]] conducted initial [[risk assessment]]s to screen and to identify any need for further work.

During the late 1990s, OECD member countries began to assess chemical categories and to use [[quantitative structure–activity relationship]] (QSAR) results to create OECD guidance documents, as well as a computerized QSAR toolbox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History: From the HPV Chemicals Programme to the Cooperative Chemicals Assessment Programme|url=http://www.oecd.org/chemicalsafety/risk-assessment/historyfromthehpvchemicalsprogrammetothecooperativechemicalsassessmentprogramme.htm| work=Chemical safety and biosafety; Assessment of chemicals|publisher=OECD|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, the global [[chemical industry]], organized in the [[International Council of Chemical Associations]] (ICCA) initiative, offered to join OECD efforts. The ICCA promised to sponsor by 2013 about 1,000 substances  from the OECD's HPV chemicals list "to establish as priorities for investigation", based on "presumed wide dispersive use, production in two or more global regions or similarity to another chemical, which met either of these criteria". OECD in turn agreed to refocus and to "increase transparency, efficiency and productivity and allow longer-term planning for governments and industry". The OECD refocus was on initial [[hazard]] assessments of HPV chemicals only, and no longer extensive [[exposure assessment|exposure information]] gathering and evaluation. Detailed exposure assessments within national (or regional) programmes and priority setting activities were postponed as post-SIDS work.

===United States===
On October 9, 1998, [[EPA Administrator]] Carol Browner sent letters to the CEOs of more than 900 chemical companies that manufacture HPV chemicals, asking them to participate in EPA's voluntary testing initiative, the so-called "HPV Challenge Program". The [[Environmental Defense Fund]], the [[American Petroleum Institute]], and [[American Chemistry Council]] joined in the effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=High Production Volume (HPV) Challenge|url=http://www.epa.gov/chemrtk/pubs/general/basicinfo.htm#creation|work=Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention Pollution Prevention &amp; Toxics|publisher=EPA| accessdate=13 March 2014|date=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== HPV chemical lists==
The OECD list of HPV chemicals keeps changing. A 2004 list of 143 pages contained 4,842 entries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 2004 OECD List of High Production Volume Chemicals|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/55/38/33883530.pdf|publisher=OECD|accessdate=13 March 2014|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 list was published in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 2007 OECD List of High Production Volume Chemicals|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/32/9/43947965.pdf|publisher=OECD|accessdate=13 March 2014|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of| 2009}} the EPA's HPV list had 2,539 chemicals, while the HPV Challenge Program chemical list contained only 1,973 chemicals because inorganic chemicals and polymers were not included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=U.S. EPA (Environmental Protection Agency)|title=The HPV Voluntary Challenge Chemical List|url= http://www.epa.gov/hpv/pubs/update/hpvchmlt.htm|date=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EPA has published an online list of HPV chemicals since 2010. The list is not numerated and without footnotes.&lt;ref name=EPA&gt;{{cite web|title=HPV Chemical Hazard Characterizations|url=http://iaspub.epa.gov/oppthpv/hpv_hc_characterization.get_report?doctype=2|work=High Production Volume Information System (HPVIS)|publisher=US EPA|accessdate=13 March 2014|date=March 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulatory context==

===Europe===
The "Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management" ([[SAICM]]) is a policy for achieving safe production and use of chemicals worldwide by 2020, developed with stakeholders from more than 140 countries, signed by 100 governments, adopted by the [[UNEP]] Governing Council in February 2006. 
The [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals]] (REACH) proposal and the [[European Chemicals Agency]] will help the EU to fulfill objectives of SAICM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), establishing a European Chemicals Agency and amending Directive 1999/45/EC and Regulation (EC) on Persistent Organic Pollutants|url=http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/06/st15/st15315.en06.pdf|publisher=European Union|accessdate=14 March 2014|author=Council of the European Union|pages=756|date=14 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The [[Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants]] has aimed to control production, use, trade, disposal and release of twelve [[Persistent organic pollutants]] (POPs); the European Community has proposed five additional chemicals. The Convention bans deliberate production and use of POPs, bans the development of new POPs, and aims at minimizing releases of unintentionally produced POPs. The Convention has so far been ratified by the European Community, 18 member states and the two accession countries.

===United States===
The 1976 [[Toxic Substances Control Act]] requires the EPA to "compile, keep current, and publish a list of each chemical substance that is manufactured or processed in the United States". In 1998, the EPA reported the most heavily used HPV chemicals in commerce were largely untested: 43% of 2,800 HPV chemicals had no basic [[toxicity test|toxicity data]] or screening level data at all, 50% had incomplete screening data, and only 7% of the HPV chemicals had a complete set of screening level toxicity data. However, screening level data, even if they indicated a problem, were not sufficient to restrict the use of a compound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/hpv/pubs/general/hazchem.pdf|publisher=Environmental Protection Agency|date=April 1998|title= Chemical Hazard Data Availability Study. What do we really know about the safety of high production volume chemicals? |author= Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics|pages=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1986, 2003, 2005, and in 2011 EPA issued regulations to amend and update the TSCA inventory.

As of April 2010, about 84,000 chemicals were on the TSCA inventory, per a [[GAO]] report.&lt;ref name=GAO&gt;{{cite web|title=TSCA Inventory Reset|url=http://www.epa.gov/champ/pubs/hpv/tsca.html|work=Chemical Assessment and Management Program (ChAMP)|publisher=EPA|accessdate=13 March 2014|date=April 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; TSCA Section 4 gives EPA the authority to demand chemical testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chemical Regulation: Observations on the Toxic Substances Control Act and EPA Implementation|url=http://www.gao.gov/assets/660/655209.txt|work=GAO-13-696T|publisher=GAO|accessdate=13 March 2014|date=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toxicity data==
In 1982, U.S. manufacturers, processors, and importers of 75 chemicals that the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] had found to cause cancers in animals, but the carcinogenicity of which in humans was uncertain, were surveyed. Only for 13 of the 75 chemicals had epidemiologic studies on human health been completed or were in progress. Eighteen of the 75 were HPV chemicals and only for eight HPV chemicals had epidemiologic studies been completed or were in progress. The largest number of chemicals (19) were drugs, and none of them had been epidemiologically studied. Seven chemicals that had been studied were used as pesticides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Availability of epidemiologic data on humans exposed to animal carcinogens. II. Chemical uses and production volume|journal=Teratognesise Carcinogenesis Mutagenesis|year=1982| volume=2| issue=2|pages=151–67|pmid=6126936|author=Karstadt M |author2=Bobal R.| doi=10.1002/tcm.1770020205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997 the [[Environmental Defense Fund]] reported in “Toxic Ignorance” results of its analysis of the availability of basic health test data on HPV chemicals that only 29% of the HPV chemicals in the US met minimum data requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Toxic Ignorance.|url=https://duckduckgo.com/l/?kh=-1&amp;uddg=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.edf.org%2Fhealth%2Freports%2Ftoxic-ignorance|publisher=Environmental Defense Fund.|accessdate=25 February 2015|date=Summer 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1998 the EPA published a report CHEMICAL HAZARD DATA AVAILABILITY STUDY showing "55% of TRI chemicals have had full SIDS testing, while only 7% of other chemicals have full test data".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=EPA’s Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics|title=Chemical Hazard Data Availability Study: What Do We Really Know About the Safety of High Production Volume Chemicals?|publisher=EPA|pages=35|date=April 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; They wrote 
"...of the 830 companies making HPV chemicals in the US, 148 companies have NO SIDS data available on their chemicals; an additional 459 companies sell products for which, on average, half or less of SIDS tests are available. Only 21 companies (or 3% of the 830 companies) have all SIDS tests available for their chemicals. The basic set of test data costs about $200,000 per chemical."
In 1999, the European Union (EU) published a study about how many EU-HPV chemicals were [[Publicly Available Specification|publicly available]] in a comprehensive chemical data base called [[IUCLID]]: Only 14% of the EU-HPV chemicals had data at the level of the base-set, 65% had less than base-set, and 21% had no data available. The authors concluded, "more data [were] publicly available than most previous studies" had shown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=R Allanou |author2=BG Hansen |author3=Y van der Bilt |title=Public Availability of Data on EU High Production Volume Chemicals|journal=EUR| year=1999| issue=18996| publisher=European Union|url=http://www.chemicalspolicy.org/downloads/DataAvailabilityEUHPV.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, one of the partners in EPA's HPV Challenge Program assessed 532 up to then unsponsored chemicals, whether they were "orphaned" or not, and found:
* 156 chemicals (29%) likely were still "orphans" – i.e., they could and should be sponsored, but had not been
* 103 chemicals (19%) had an unclear status 
* 266 chemicals (50%) were likely no longer HPV
* only 7 chemicals (1%) appeared to be in the process of becoming sponsored.&lt;ref name=ED&gt;{{cite web|title=Orphan Chemicals in the HPV Challenge: A Status Report|url=http://www.environmentaldefense.org.|publisher=Environmental Defense|accessdate=14 March 2014|author1=Richard A. Denison |page=12|date=June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Since 2009, the EPA required companies to perform toxicity testing on merely 34 chemicals. In 2011, the EPA announced, but as of 2013 had yet to finalize, plans to require testing for 23 additional chemicals, so altogether 57 chemicals. The EPA has prioritized 83 chemicals for [[risk assessment]], and initiated seven assessments in 2012, with plans to start 18 additional assessments in 2013 and 2014.&lt;ref name=GAO /&gt;
In 2007, EPA began Toxcast which uses "automated chemical screening technologies (called "high-throughput screening assays") to expose living cells or isolated proteins to chemicals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ToxCast™ Advancing the next generation of chemical safety evaluation|url=http://www.epa.gov/ncct/toxcast/|publisher=EPA|accessdate=25 February 2015|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=ToxCast Chemical Landscape: Paving the Road to 21st Century Toxicology|journal=Chemical Research in Toxicology|year=2016| volume=29| issue=8|pages=1225–1251|pmid=27367298|author=Richard A |author2=Judson R.| doi=10.1021/acs.chemrestox.6b00135}}&lt;/ref&gt;            

In 2009, EPA reported that it developed a system called ACToR (Aggregated Computational Toxicology Resource) to expose living cells or isolated proteins to chemicals.  It pooled chemical research, data and screening tools from multiple federal agencies including the National Toxicology Program/ National Institute of Environmental Health Science, National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences and the Food and Drug Administration.

{{Nihongo|'''''Hitsuzendō'''''|筆禅道|"way of Zen through brush"}} is believed by [[Zen Buddhism|Zen Buddhists]] to be a method of achieving [[samādhi]] (Japanese: 三昧 ''sanmai''), which is a unification with the highest reality. Hitsuzendo refers specifically to a school of [[Japan]]ese [[Zen]] calligraphy to which the rating system of modern [[calligraphy]] (well-proportioned and pleasing to the eye) is foreign. Instead, the calligraphy of Hitsuzendo must breathe with the vitality of eternal experience.{{Clarify|date=March 2011}}

==Origins==
[[Yokoyama Tenkei]] (1885–1966), inspired by the teachings of [[Yamaoka Tesshu]] (1836–1888), founded the Hitsuzendo line of thought as a "practice to uncover one's [[Buddha nature|original self]] through the brush." This was then further developed by [[Omori Sogen]] Roshi as a way of Zen practice. Hitsuzendo is practised standing, using a large brush and ink, usually on newspaper roll. In this way, the whole body is used to guide the brush, in contrast to writing at a table.

==History==
{{Main|Japanese calligraphy}}
Calligraphy was brought to Japan from China and Chinese masters such as [[Wang Xizhi]] 王羲之 (Jp: Ou Gishi; 303-361) have had a profound influence, especially on the ''karayō'' style which is still practiced today. The indigenous Japanese ''wayō tradition'' (和様書道, wayō-shodō) only appeared towards the end of the [[Heian era]]. However, the calligraphy of Zen scholars was often more concerned with spiritual qualities and individual expression and shunned technicalities which led to unique and distinctly personal styles.&lt;ref name="Nakata_73"&gt;Nakata, Yujiro. ''The Art of Japanese Calligraphy'', Weatherhill/Heibonsha, New York/Tojyo, 1973. {{ISBN|0-8348-1013-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese calligraphy has three basic styles: Kaisho 楷書, Gyōsho 行書, and Sōsho 草書.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qg7RAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8|title=An Introduction to Japanese Kanji Calligraphy|last=Kunii|first=Takezaki|last2=Godin|first2=Bob|date=2013-01-29|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|isbn=9781462905928|location=|pages=8|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical background==
True creativity is not the product of consciousness but rather the "phenomenon of life itself."{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} True creation must arise from mu-shin 無心, the state of "no-mind," in which thought, emotions, and expectations do not matter.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Truly skilful Zen calligraphy is not the product of intense "practice;" rather, it is best achieved as the product of the "no-mind" state, a high level of [[spirituality]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}, and a heart free of disturbances.

To write Zen calligraphic characters that convey truly deep meaning, one must focus intensely and become one with the meaning of the characters they create.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} In order to do this, one must free one's mind and heart of disturbances and focus only on the meaning of the character. Becoming one with what you create, essentially, is the philosophy behind Zen Calligraphy and other Japanese arts.

The '''Human Microbiome Project''' ('''HMP''') was a United States [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) research initiative to improve understanding of the [[Human microbiota|microbial flora]] involved in human health and disease. Launched in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Microbiome Project: Diversity of Human Microbes Greater Than Previously Predicted|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/05/100520141214.htm|publisher=ScienceDaily|access-date=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first phase (HMP1) focused on identifying and characterizing human microbial flora. The second phase, known as the Integrative Human Microbiome Project (iHMP) launched in 2014 with the aim of generating resources to characterize the [[Microbiota|microbiome]] and elucidating the roles of microbes in health and disease states. The program received $170 million in funding by the [[National Institutes of Health Common Fund|NIH Common Fund]] from 2007 to 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://commonfund.nih.gov/hmp|title=Human Microbiome Project - Home {{!}} NIH Common Fund|website=commonfund.nih.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Important components of the HMP were culture-independent methods of microbial [[community ecology|community]] characterization, such as [[metagenomics]] (which provides a broad genetic perspective on a single microbial community), as well as extensive [[whole genome sequencing]] (which provides a "deep" genetic perspective on certain aspects of a given microbial community, ''i.e.'' of individual bacterial species). The latter served as reference [[genomics|genomic sequences]] — 3000 such sequences of individual bacterial [[Isolation (microbiology)|isolates]] are currently planned — for comparison purposes during subsequent metagenomic analysis. The project also financed deep sequencing of bacterial [[16S ribosomal RNA|16S rRNA]] sequences amplified by [[polymerase chain reaction]] from human subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Microbiome Project|url=http://commonfund.nih.gov/hmp/|publisher=The NIH Common Fund|access-date=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
[[File:Skin Microbiome20169-300.jpg|thumb|Depiction of prevalences of various classes of bacteria at selected sites on human skin]]
Prior to the HMP launch, it was often reported in popular media and scientific literature that there are about 10 times as many microbial cells and 100 times as many microbial genes in the human body as there are human cells; this figure was based on estimates that the human microbiome includes around 100 trillion bacterial cells and an adult human typically has around 10 trillion human cells.&lt;ref name=AAM2014&gt;American Academy of Microbiology [http://academy.asm.org/index.php/faq-series/5122-humanmicrobiome FAQ: Human Microbiome] January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014 the [[American Academy of Microbiology]] published a FAQ that emphasized that the number of microbial cells and the number of human cells are both estimates, and noted that recent research had arrived at a new estimate of the number of human cells at around 37 trillion cells, meaning that the ratio of microbial to human cells is probably about 3:1.&lt;ref name=AAM2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rosner&gt;Judah L. Rosner for Microbe Magazine, Feb 2014. [http://www.asmscience.org/content/journal/microbe/10.1128/microbe.9.47.2 Ten Times More Microbial Cells than Body Cells in Humans?]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2016 another group published a new estimate of ratio as being roughly 1:1 (1.3:1, with "an uncertainty of 25% and a variation of 53% over the population of standard 70 kg males").&lt;ref name=NN2016&gt;Alison Abbott for Nature News. Jan 8 2016 [http://www.nature.com/news/scientists-bust-myth-that-our-bodies-have-more-bacteria-than-human-cells-1.19136 Scientists bust myth that our bodies have more bacteria than human cells]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sender&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sender R, Fuchs S, Milo R | title = Are We Really Vastly Outnumbered? Revisiting the Ratio of Bacterial to Host Cells in Humans | journal = Cell | volume = 164 | issue = 3 | pages = 337–40 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26824647 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2016.01.013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the staggering number of microbes in and on the human body, little was known about their roles in human health and disease. Many of the organisms that make up the microbiome have not been successfully [[microbiological culture|cultured]], identified, or otherwise characterized. Organisms thought to be found in the human microbiome, however, may generally be categorized as [[bacteria]], members of [[Domain (biology)|domain]] [[Archaea]], [[yeasts]], and [[protozoa|single-celled eukaryotes]] as well as various [[helminth]] [[parasitism|parasites]] and [[virus]]es, the latter including viruses that infect the cellular microbiome organisms (e.g., [[bacteriophages]]). The HMP set out to discover and characterize the human microbiome, emphasizing oral, skin, vaginal, gastrointestinal, and respiratory sites.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The HMP will address some of the most inspiring, vexing and fundamental scientific questions today. Importantly, it also has the potential to break down the artificial barriers between medical microbiology and environmental microbiology. It is hoped that the HMP will not only identify new ways to determine health and predisposition to diseases but also define the parameters needed to design, implement and monitor strategies for intentionally manipulating the human microbiota, to optimize its performance in the context of an individual's physiology.&lt;ref name=TurnbaughLey2007&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Turnbaugh PJ, Ley RE, Hamady M, Fraser-Liggett CM, Knight R, Gordon JI | title = The human microbiome project | journal = Nature | volume = 449 | issue = 7164 | pages = 804–10 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17943116 | pmc = 3709439 | doi = 10.1038/nature06244 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The HMP has been described as "a logical conceptual and experimental extension of the [[Human Genome Project]]."&lt;ref name=TurnbaughLey2007/&gt; In 2007 the HMP was listed on the NIH Roadmap for Medical Research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the NIH Roadmap |url=http://commonfund.nih.gov/aboutroadmap.aspx |publisher=The NIH Common Fund |access-date=8 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217072814/https://commonfund.nih.gov/aboutroadmap.aspx |archive-date=17 February 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as one of the ''New Pathways to Discovery''. Organized characterization of the human microbiome is also being done internationally under the auspices of the International Human Microbiome Consortium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The International Human Microbiome Consortium|url=http://www.human-microbiome.org/|access-date=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The [[Canadian Institutes of Health Research]], through the CIHR Institute of Infection and Immunity, is leading the Canadian Microbiome Initiative to develop a coordinated and focused research effort to analyze and characterize the microbes that colonize the human body and their potential alteration during chronic disease states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/39939.html|title=Canadian Microbiome Initiative|publisher=Canadian Institutes of Health Research|access-date=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contributing Institutions ==
The HMP involved participation from many research institutions, including [[Stanford University|Stanford University]], the [[Broad Institute]], [[Virginia Commonwealth University]], [[Washington University in St. Louis|Washington University]], [[Northeastern University]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], the [[Baylor College of Medicine]], and [https://commonfund.nih.gov/hmp/fundedresearch many others]. Contributions included data evaluation, construction of reference sequence data sets, ethical and legal studies, technology development, and more.

==Phase One (2007-2014)==
The HMP1 included research efforts from many institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Microbiome Project / Funded Research|url=https://commonfund.nih.gov/hmp/fundedresearch|publisher=The NIH Common Fund|access-date=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The HMP1 set the following goals:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Microbiome Project / Program Initiatives|url=http://commonfund.nih.gov/hmp/initiatives.aspx#resources|publisher=The NIH Common Fund|access-date=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Develop a reference set of microbial genome sequences and to perform preliminary characterization of the human microbiome
* Explore the relationship between disease and changes in the human microbiome
* Develop new technologies and tools for computational analysis
* Establish a resource repository
* Study the ethical, legal, and social implications of human microbiome research



== Phase Two (2014-2016) ==

In 2014, the NIH launched the second phase of the project, known as the Integrative Human Microbiome Project (iHMP). The goal of the iHMP was to produce resources to create a complete characterization of the human microbiome, with a focus on understanding the presence of microbiota in health and disease states.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hmpdacc.org/ihmp/overview/|title=NIH Human Microbiome Project - About the Human Microbiome|website=hmpdacc.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project mission, as stated by the NIH, was as follows: &lt;blockquote&gt;The iHMP will create integrated longitudinal datasets of biological properties from both the microbiome and host from three different cohort studies of microbiome-associated conditions using multiple "omics" technologies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The project encompassed three sub-projects carried out at multiple institutions. Study methods included [[16S ribosomal RNA|16S rRNA]] gene profiling, whole [[Metagenomics|metagenome]] [[shotgun sequencing]], [[whole genome sequencing]], [[metatranscriptomics]], [[metabolomics]]/[[lipidomics]], and [[immunoproteomics]]. The key findings of the iHMP are due for publishing in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://commonfund.nih.gov/hmp|title=Human Microbiome Project - Home {{!}} NIH Common Fund|website=commonfund.nih.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pregnancy &amp; Preterm Birth ===

The Vaginal Microbiome Consortium team at Virginia Commonwealth University led research on the Pregnancy &amp; Preterm Birth project with a goal of understanding how the microbiome changes during the gestational period and influences the neonatal microbiome. The project was also concerned with the role of the microbiome in the occurrence of preterm births, which, according to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]], account for nearly 10% of all births&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ferré C, Callaghan W, Olson C, Sharma A, Barfield W | title = Effects of Maternal Age and Age-Specific Preterm Birth Rates on Overall Preterm Birth Rates - United States, 2007 and 2014 | language = en-us | journal = MMWR.

=== Onset of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) ===

The Inflammatory Bowel Disease Multi'omics Data (IBDMDB) team was a multi-institution group of researchers focused on understanding how the [[Gut flora|gut microbiome]] changes longitudinally in adults and children suffering from [[Inflammatory bowel disease|IBD]]. IBD is an inflammatory [[Autoimmune disease|autoimmune disorder]] that manifests as either [[Crohn's disease]] or [[ulcerative colitis]] and affects about one million Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ibd/ibd-epidemiology.htm|title=CDC - Epidemiology of the IBD - Inflammatory Bowel Disease|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research participants included cohorts from [[Massachusetts General Hospital]], [[Emory University Hospital]]/[[Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center|Cincinnati Children's Hospital]], and [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ibdmdb.org/project/|title=Team|website=ibdmdb.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Onset of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) ===

Researchers from Standford University and the [[Jackson Laboratory|Jackson Laboratory of Genomic Medicine]] worked together to perform a longitudinal analysis on the biological processes that occur in the microbiome of patients at risk for [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|Type 2 Diabetes]]. T2D affects nearly 20 million Americans with at least 79 million pre-diabetic patients,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/data/statistics/statistics-report.html|title=National Diabetes Statistics Report {{!}} Data &amp; Statistics {{!}} Diabetes {{!}} CDC|date=2018-03-09|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is partially characterized by marked shifts in the microbiome compared to healthy individuals. The project aimed to identify molecules and signaling pathways that play a role in the etiology of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://med.stanford.edu/ipop.html|title=Integrated Personal Omics Profiling {{!}} Integrated Personal Omics Profiling  {{!}} Stanford Medicine|website=med.stanford.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Achievements==
The impact to date of the HMP may be partially assessed by examination of research sponsored by the HMP. Over 190 peer-reviewed publications are listed on the HMP website from June 2009 through August 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Microbiome Project / Science Publications|url=http://commonfund.nih.gov/hmp/publications.aspx|publisher=The NIH Common Fund|access-date=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Major categories of work funded by HMP include:
* Development of new database systems allowing efficient organization, storage, access, search and annotation of massive amounts of data. These include IMG, the [[Integrated Microbial Genomes System|Integrated Microbial Genomes]] database and comparative analysis system;&lt;ref name="MarkowitzChen2012a"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Markowitz VM, Chen IM, Palaniappan K, Chu K, Szeto E, Grechkin Y, Ratner A, Jacob B, Huang J, Williams P, Huntemann M, Anderson I, Mavromatis K, Ivanova NN, Kyrpides NC | title = IMG: the Integrated Microbial Genomes database and comparative analysis system | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 40 | issue = Database issue | pages = D115-22 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 22194640 | pmc = 3245086 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkr1044 }}&lt;/ref&gt; IMG/M, a related system that integrates metagenome data sets with isolate microbial genomes from the IMG system;&lt;ref name="MarkowitzChen2012b"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Markowitz VM, Chen IM, Chu K, Szeto E, Palaniappan K, Grechkin Y, Ratner A, Jacob B, Pati A, Huntemann M, Liolios K, Pagani I, Anderson I, Mavromatis K, Ivanova NN, Kyrpides NC | title = IMG/M: the integrated metagenome data management and comparative analysis system | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 40 | issue = Database issue | pages = D123-9 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 22086953 | pmc = 3245048 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkr975 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CharProtDB]], a database of experimentally characterized protein annotations;&lt;ref name="RichterDodson2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Madupu R, Richter A, Dodson RJ, Brinkac L, Harkins D, Durkin S, Shrivastava S, Sutton G, Haft D | title = CharProtDB: a database of experimentally characterized protein annotations | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 40 | issue = Database issue | pages = D237-41 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 22140108 | pmc = 3245046 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkr1133 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Genomes OnLine Database]] (GOLD), for monitoring the status of genomic and metagenomic projects worldwide and their associated metadata.&lt;ref name="PaganiLiolios2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pagani I, Liolios K, Jansson J, Chen IM, Smirnova T, Nosrat B, Markowitz VM, Kyrpides NC | title = The Genomes OnLine Database (GOLD) v.4: status of genomic and metagenomic projects and their associated metadata | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 40 | issue = Database issue | pages = D571-9 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 22135293 | pmc = 3245063 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkr1100 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 242 healthy U.S. volunteers, more than 5,000 samples were collected from tissues from 15 (men) to 18 (women) body sites such as mouth, nose, skin, lower intestine (stool) and vagina. All the DNA, human and microbial, were analyzed with DNA sequencing machines. The microbial genome data were extracted by identifying the bacterial specific ribosomal RNA, [[16S ribosomal RNA|16S rRNA]]. The researchers calculated that more than 10,000 microbial species occupy the human ecosystem and they have identified 81 – 99% of the [[genera]]. In addition to establishing the human microbiome reference database, the HMP project also discovered several "surprises", which include:

*Microbes contribute more genes responsible for human survival than humans' own genes. It is estimated that bacterial protein-coding genes are 360 times more abundant than human genes.
*Microbial metabolic activities; for example, digestion of fats; are not always provided by the same bacterial species. The presence of the activities seems to matter more.
*Components of the human microbiome change over time, affected by a patient disease state and medication. However, the microbiome eventually returns to a state of equilibrium, even though the composition of bacterial types has changed.

===Clinical application===
Among the first clinical applications utilizing the HMP data, as reported in several PLoS papers, the researchers found a shift to less species diversity in [[vaginal microbiome]] of pregnant women in preparation for birth, and high viral DNA load in the nasal microbiome of children with unexplained fevers.  Other studies using the HMP data and techniques include role of microbiome in various diseases in the digestive tract, skin, reproductive organs and childhood disorders.&lt;ref name=hmpdata/&gt;

===Pharmaceutical application===
[[Pharmaceutical microbiology|Pharmaceutical microbiologists]] have considered the implications of the HMP data in relation to the presence / absence of 'objectionable' microorganisms in non-sterile pharmaceutical products and in relation to the monitoring of microorganisms within the controlled environments in which products are manufactured. The latter also has implications for media selection and disinfectant efficacy studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilder, C, Sandle T, Sutton S | title = Implications of the Human Microbiome on Pharmaceutical Microbiology | journal = American Pharmaceutical Review|date= June 2013 | url=http://www.americanpharmaceuticalreview.com/1504-White-Papers-Application-Notes/140112-Implications-of-the-Human-Microbiome-on-Pharmaceutical-Microbiology/?catid=6262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[pathology]], '''hypertrophic decidual vasculopathy''', abbreviated '''HDV''', is the [[histomorphology|histomorphologic]] correlate of [[gestational hypertension]], as may be seen in [[intrauterine growth restriction]] (IUGR)&lt;ref name=pmid18641412&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Roberts | first1 = DJ. | last2 = Post | first2 = MD. | title = The placenta in pre-eclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction. | journal = J Clin Pathol | volume = 61 | issue = 12 | pages = 1254–60 |date=Dec 2008 | doi = 10.1136/jcp.2008.055236 | PMID = 18641412 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[HELLP syndrome]].  

The name of the condition describes its appearance under the [[microscope]]; the [[smooth muscle]] of the [[decidua]]l (or [[mother|maternal]]) [[blood vessel]]s is [[hypertrophy|hypertrophic]], i.e. the muscle part of the blood vessels feeding the placenta is larger due to cellular enlargement.

==Morphologic features==

*Perivascular inflammatory cells,
*+/-Vascular thrombosis,
*Smooth muscle hypertrophy, and
*Endothelial hyperplasia.
Severe HDV is characterized by:
*Atherosis - foamy macrophages within vascular wall, and
*Fibrinoid necrosis of vessel wall (amorphous eosinophilic vessel wall).

In [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], '''inclusion''' is the process whereby two [[species]] that were believed to be distinct are found in fact to be the same and are thus combined as one species. Which name is kept for this unified species is sometimes a cause of debate, but generally it is the earlier-named one, and the other species is said to be "included" within this one.

Inclusion is far more common in [[paleontology]] than more recent [[biology]], although it is not unheard of in the latter. When it occurs with more recent or modern species, it is usually the result of a species with wide geographical dispersion.

Internet sex addiction can have several causes according to the American Association for Sex Addition Therapy. The first cause is the neural physiological attachment that occurs during orgasms -  reinforcing and attaching the images or scenarios to the addictive behavior concurrently. Secondly, psychological defects like abandonment, unimportance or lack of genuine attachment are sometimes medicated by the instances of sex addiction behavior. Thirdly, the internet sex addict may be using the addiction to balance a legitimate chemical imbalance due to major depression, a bipolar disorder or a manic depressive disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://aasat.org/|title=SRT Training &amp; Certification {{!}} Sexual Recovery Therapist {{!}} AASAT|website=American Association for Sex Addiction Therapy|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cybersex addict may also struggle with [[intimacy anorexia]] since the cyber world feels safer than real relationships.

==General==

[[Cybersex]] addiction is a form of [[sexual addiction]] and [[Internet addiction disorder]].&lt;ref name=Griffiths /&gt; As a form of a [[compulsive behavior]], it can be identified by three criteria: the failure of making a decision about engagement in the behavior, obsession with the behavior, and the inability to stop the behavior despite negative consequences.&lt;ref name=Daneback /&gt;

Adults with this type of addiction, engage in at least one of the relevant behaviors. The majority of reasons why individuals experiment with such forms of sexual expression are diverse, and can be associated with an individual's [[psychological disorders]] or issues. Individuals who suffer from [[low self-esteem]], severely distorted [[body image]], untreated [[sexual dysfunction]], social isolation, [[Depression (mood)|depression]], or are in recovery from a prior [[sexual addiction]] are more vulnerable to cybersexual addictions.&lt;ref name=Griffiths /&gt;&lt;ref name=Young /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cooper&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Alvin|author2=Coralie R. Scherer |author3=Sylvain C. Boies |author4=Barry L. Gordon |title=Sexuality on the Internet: From Sexual Exploration to Pathological Expression.|journal=Professional Psychology: Research and Practice|date=April 1999|volume=30|issue=1|pages=154–164|url=http://journals1.scholarsportal.info/details-sfx.xqy?uri=/07357028/v30i0002/154_sotifsetpe.xml|accessdate=2 April 2013 |doi=10.1037/0735-7028.30.2.154}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other psychological issues that may arise with this addiction include struggles for intimacy, self-worth, [[self-identity]], self-understanding.&lt;ref name=Daneback /&gt;

The impact of cybersex addiction may also impact the spouse, partner or others in relationships with the addict. The resulting effects on others may include depression, weight gain and lower self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Partners: Healing From His Addiction|last=Weiss|first=Douglas|publisher=Discovery Press|year=2011|isbn=1-881292-34-7|location=Colorado Springs, CO 80949|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; If cyber sex addicts have children, their actions may also impact those children (whether they are grown adult children or younger dependents).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/57754066|title=Beyond the bedroom : healing for adult children of sex addicts|last=Douglas.|first=Weiss,|date=2005|publisher=Health Communications|year=|isbn=0757303250|location=Deerfield Beach, FL|pages=17-21|oclc=57754066}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==DSM classification==
There is an ongoing debate in the medical community concerning the insufficient studies, and of those, their quality, or lack thereof, and the resulting analysis and conclusions drawn from them, such as they are. So far, without repeatable, meaningful, measurable, and quantifiable analysis, no medical community wide acceptably reasonable standards, a definition, have been drawn yet.

Hence, internet sex addiction, just like it's umbrella [[sexual addiction]], is still not listed in the [[DSM-5]],&lt;ref name=dsm-5&gt;{{Cite book |first= |last= American Psychiatric Association |year= 2013 |title= Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders |edition= Fifth |publisher= American Psychiatric Publishing |location= Arlington, VA |pages= 797–798 |isbn= 978-0-89042-555-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is commonly used by psychiatrists in the United States for diagnosing patients problems in a standard uniform way.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7000">'''Intersubjective verifiability''' is the capacity of a concept to be readily and accurately communicated between different individuals ("[[intersubjectivity|intersubjectively]]"), and to be [[reproducibility|reproduced]] under varying circumstances for the purposes of verification. It is a core principle of [[empiricism|empirical]], [[science|scientific]] investigation.&lt;ref name=Kim&gt;''Philosophy of Mind.'' Jaegwon Kim. 2005. Westview Press, p. 75.  ({{ISBN|0813342694}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Martin&gt;
''Verstehen: The Uses of Understanding in the Social Sciences.'' Michael Martin. 2000. Transaction Publishers, p. 64 ({{ISBN|1560004169}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ferment&gt;''Knowledge in Ferment:  Dilemmas in Science, Scholarship and Society.'' Adriaan in ’t Groen, Henk Jan de Jonge,
Eduard Klasen, Hilje Papma, and Piet van Slooten, Eds. 2007. Leiden University Press, p. 265 ({{ISBN|9789087280178}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there are areas of belief that do not consistently employ intersubjective verifiability (e.g., many [[religion|religious]] claims), intersubjective verifiability is a near-universal way of arbitrating [[truth]] claims used by people everywhere. In its basic form, it can be found in colloquial expressions, e.g., "[[:wikt:from Missouri|I'm from Missouri. Show me!]]" or "[[:wikt:Seeing is believing|Seeing is believing]]". The scientific principle of replication of findings by investigators other than those that first reported the phenomenon is simply a more highly structured form of the universal principle of intersubjective verifiability.

==Subjective experience==
Each individual is a [[subject (philosophy)|subject]], and must [[subjectivity|subjective]]ly [[experience]] the physical world. Each subject has a different perspective and point of view on various aspects of the world. However, by sharing their comparable experiences intersubjectively, individuals may gain an increasingly similar understanding of the world. In this way, many different subjective experiences can come together to form intersubjective ones that are less likely to be prone to individual bias or gaps in knowledge.

While specific internal experiences are not intersubjectively verifiable, the existence of thematic patterns of internal experience can be intersubjectively verified.  For example, whether or not people are telling what they believe to be the truth when they make claims can only be known by the claimants.  However, we can intersubjectively verify that people almost universally experience discomfort (hunger) when they haven't had enough to eat.  We generally have only a crude ability to compare (measure) internal experiences.

==Congruence and incongruence==
When an external, public [[phenomenon]] is experienced and carefully described (in words or measurements) by one individual, other individuals can see if their experiences of the phenomenon "fit" the description. If they do, a sense of [[wikt:congruence|congruence]] between one subject and another occurs. This is the basis for a definition of what is true that is agreed upon by the involved parties. If the description does not fit the experience of one or more of the parties involved, incongruence occurs instead.

Incongruent contradictions between the experience and descriptions of different individuals can be caused by a number of factors. One common source of incongruence is the inconsistent use of language in the descriptions people use, such as the same words being used differently. Such [[semantics|semantic]] problems require more careful development and use of language.

Incongruence also arises from a failure to describe the phenomena well. In these cases, further development of the description, [[model (abstract)|model]], or [[theory]] used to refer to the phenomena is required.

A third form of incongruence arises when the descriptions do not conform to consensual (i.e., intersubjectively verifiable) experience, such as when the descriptions are faulty, incorrect, wrong, or inaccurate, and need to be replaced by more accurate descriptions, models, or theories.

==Versus belief based on faith==
{{Main|Science and religion}}

The contradiction between the truths derived from intersubjective verification and beliefs based on faith or on [[appeal to authority]] (e.g., many religious beliefs) forms the basis for the [[conflict between religion and science]].&lt;ref name=rel&amp;sci&gt;''The Marriage of Sense and Soul:  Integrating Science and Religion.'' Ken Wilbur. 1998. Random House ({{ISBN|0375500545}})&lt;/ref&gt;  There have been attempts to bring the two into congruence, and the modern, cutting edge of science, especially in [[physics]], seems to many observers to lend itself to a melding of religious experience and intersubjective verification of beliefs.  Some scientists have described religious worldviews—generally of a [[mystical]] nature—consistent with their understanding of science:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There are two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle ...

Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind ...

The religion of the future will be a cosmic religion. The religion which is based on experience, which refuses dogmatism ...

There remains something subtle, intangible and inexplicable. Veneration for this force beyond anything that we can comprehend is my religion. ([[Albert Einstein]])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other scientists, who are committed to basing belief on intersubjective verification, have called for or predicted the development of a religion consistent with science.

&lt;blockquote&gt;A religion old or new, that stressed the magnificence of the universe as revealed by modern science, might be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and awe hardly tapped by the conventional faiths. Sooner or later, such a religion will emerge. ([[Carl Sagan]], [[Pale Blue Dot]])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The evolutionary epic is probably the best myth we will ever have ...
The true evolutionary epic, retold as poetry, is as intrinsically ennobling as any religious epic. ([[Edward O. Wilson]])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Responding to this apparent overlap between cutting edge science and mystical experience, in recent years, there have been overt efforts to formulate religious belief systems that are built on truth claims based upon intersubjective verifiability, e.g. [[Anthroposophy]], [[Yoism]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yoism.org Yoism YOism site]&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''Leopold matrix''' is a qualitative [[environmental impact assessment]] method pioneered in 1971.&lt;ref name="Leopold"&gt;
{{cite book |title=A Procedure for Evaluating Environmental Impact |last1=Leopold |first1=Luna B. |last2=Clarke |first2=Frank E. |last3=Hanshaw |first3=Bruce B. |last4=Balsley |first4=James R. |authorlink= |coauthors= |series=Geological Survey Circular 645 |year=1971 |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |location=Washington |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/cir645 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to identify the potential impact of a [[Project#Engineering project|project]] on the [[natural environment|environment]]. The system consists of a matrix with columns representing the various activities of the project, and rows representing the various environmental factors to be considered. The intersections are filled in to indicate the magnitude (from -10 to +10) and the importance (from 1 to 10) of the impact of each activity on each environmental factor.

Measurements of magnitude and importance tend to be related, but do not necessarily directly correlate. Magnitude can be measured, in terms of how much area is affected by the [[land development|development]] and how badly, but importance is a more subjective measurement. While a proposed development may have a large impact in terms of magnitude, the effects it causes may not actually significantly affect the environment as a whole. The example given by Leopold is of a [[stream]] that significantly alters the [[Erosion#Water|erosion]] patterns in a specific area, which will have a significant magnitude, but may not be important, provided the stream in question is swift moving and transports large amounts of [[soil]] anyway. In this case, an impact of significant magnitude may not actually be important to the environment in question.&lt;ref name="Leopold" /&gt;{{rp|5}}

Log jams alter [[streamflow|flow]] hydraulics by diverting flow towards the bed or banks, increasing flow resistance and creating upstream pools, diverting flow onto the floodplain and damming the channel causing water to spill over the structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abbe|first1=T.B.|last2=Montgomery|first2=D.R.|title=Large woody debris jams, channel hydraulics and habitat formation in large rivers|journal=Regulated Rivers Research &amp; Management|date=1996|volume=12|issue=23|pages=201–221|doi=10.1002/(sici)1099-1646(199603)12:2/3&lt;201::aid-rrr390&gt;3.3.co;2-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Manners|first1=R.B.|last2=Doyle|first2=M.W.|last3=Small|first3=M.J.|title=Structure and hydraulics of natural woody debris jams|journal=Water Resources Research|date=2007|volume=43|issue=6|doi=10.1029/2006WR004910}}&lt;/ref&gt; These altered channel hydraulics change local patterns of erosion and [[deposition (sediment)|deposition]], which can create greater variety in local geomorphology and thus create provision and variety of habitat for instream living organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gurnell|first1=A.M.|last2=Gregory|first2=K.J.|last3=Petts|first3=G.E.|title=The role of coarse woody debris in forest aquatic habitats: Implications for management|journal=Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems|date=1995|volume=5|issue=2|pages=143–166|doi=10.1002/aqc.3270050206}}&lt;/ref&gt; The formation of a log jam against one bank typically concentrates flow in the wood-free portion of the channel, increasing velocity through this section and promoting [[Hydrodynamic scour|scour]] of the riverbed, the formation of channel-spanning log jams can lead to the formation of an upstream pool, water spilling over the structure generating a "plunge pool" immediately downstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dixon|first1=S.J.|title=A dimensionless statistical analysis of logjam form and process|journal=Ecohydrology|volume=9|issue=6|pages=1117|date=2015|doi=10.1002/eco.1710}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hydraulic and geomorphological effects of log jams are highly dependent on the slope of the river (and thus the potential power of the stream); in steep channels, log jams tend to form channel-spanning steplike structures with an associated downstream scour pool,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Curran|first1=J.C.|last2=Wohl|first2=E.E.|title=Large woody debris and flow resistance in step-pool channels, Cascade Range, Washington|journal=Geomorphology|date=2003|volume=51|issue=1–3|pages=141–157|doi=10.1016/S0169-555X(02)00333-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas, in large lowland rivers with low slopes, log jams tend to be partial structures primarily acting to deflect flow with minimal geomorphological change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shields|first1=F.D.|last2=Gippel|first2=C.J.|title=Prediction of effects of woody debris removal on flow resistance|journal=Journal of Hydraulic Engineering|date=1995|volume=121|issue=4|pages=341–354|doi=10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(1995)121:4(341)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on ecology==
Log jams provide important [[fish]] habitat. The pools created and sediment deposited by formation of log jams create prime spawning grounds for many species of [[salmon]]. These pools also provide refuge for fish during low water levels when other parts of a stream may be nearly dry. Log jams can provide refuge, as velocity shelters, during high-flow periods.

It has been suggested that log jams are part of trees acting as ecosystem engineers to alter river habitats to promote tree growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gurnell|first1=A.M.|title=Plants as river system engineers|journal=Earth Surface Processes and Landforms|date=2014|volume=39|issue=1|pages=4–25|doi=10.1002/esp.3397}}&lt;/ref&gt; In dynamic [[braided river]]s, such as the [[Tagliamento River]] in Italy where the dominant tree species is [[black poplar]], fallen trees form log jams when they are deposited on bars, fine sediment is deposited around these log jams and sprouting seedlings are able to stabilise [[braid bar]]s and promote the formation of stable islands in the river. These stable islands are then prime areas for establishment of seedlings and further vegetation growth, which in turn can eventually provide more fallen trees to the river and thus form more log jams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gurnell|first1=A.M.|last2=Petts|first2=G.E.|title=Trees as riparian engineers: The Tagliamento River, Italy|journal=Earth Surface Processes and Landforms|date=2006|volume=31|issue=12|pages=1558–1574|doi=10.1002/esp.1342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In large rivers in the [[Pacific Northwest]] of the United States, it has been shown there is a lifecycle of tree growth and river migration, with large trees falling into the channel as banks erode, then staying in place and acting as focal points for log jam formation. These log jams act as hard points resisting further erosion and channel migration. The areas of floodplain behind these log jams then become stable enough for more large trees to grow which in turn can potentially be log jam anchor points in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collins|first1=B.D.|last2=Montgomery|first2=D.R|last3=Fetherston|first3=K.L.|last4=Abbe|first4=T.B.|title=The floodplain large-wood cycle hypothesis: A mechanism for the physical and biotic structuring of temperate forested alluvial valleys in the North Pacific coastal ecoregion|journal=Geomorphology|volume=139-140|pages=460–470|doi=10.1016/j.geomorph.2011.11.011|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metaphorical usage==
"Logjam" or "log jam" can be used metaphorically to mean "deadlock" or "impasse." It can either be used more literally, to mean a physical impasse, or more metaphorically, to mean an impasse in a process due to differing opinions, legal or technical issues, etc.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/logjam&lt;/ref&gt; Here are two example sentences:
* "The presence of an ambulance on the side of the highway created a logjam of rubberneckers who just had to have a look" - more literal
* "He was called in to try to break the logjam in the negotiations" - more metaphorical

The '''Max Planck Institute for Chemical Energy Conversion''' (formerly '''Max Planck Institute for Bioinorganic Chemistry''') is a [[science|scientific]] [[research]] facility located in the [[Germany|German]] town of [[Mülheim]], northeast of [[Düsseldorf]]. One of 80 institutes in the [[Max Planck Society]], it was first part of the neighboring [[Max Planck Institute for Coal Research]] and became independent in 1981 under the name of '''Max Planck Institute for Radiation Chemistry'''. It was renamed to Max Planck Institute for Bioinorganic Chemistry in 2003, to reflect its changing research focus. Following a significant restructuring and expansion of its departments in 2011, it was re-established in 2012 as the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Energy Conversion. It consists of research departments specializing on heterogeneous catalysis, homogeneous catalysis, biophysical chemistry, and theoretical chemistry.

Directors at the Institute are:
* Serena DeBeer, Inorganic Spectroscopy
* Wolfgang Lubitz, Dept. Biophysical Chemistry
* Frank Neese, Dept. Molecular Theory and Spectroscopy
* Robert Schlögl, Heterogeneous Reactions

'''Medium theory''' is the name assigned to a variety of approaches used to examine how the means of expression of human communication impact the meaning(s) of human communication(s).

[[Joshua Meyrowitz]] originated the term in his 1985 book, ''No Sense of Place''.  Other scholars with work relevant to medium theory include [[Marshall McLuhan]] (1963, 1966, 1988) and [[Neil Postman]] (1985). Currently, medium theory occupies a marginal position within U.S. communication and media studies (Croteau &amp; Hoynes, 2003:305). The majority of U.S. communication and media studies place their emphasis on the content of communication (e.g., sex and violence) not the medium of communications. In Canada and elsewhere, the theory continues to inform studies that assess large-scale social changes that follow the adoption of a new medium. German [[media theory]] operates along similar lines and is influenced by McLuhan, though it occupies a more central location in German academia.

Joshua Meyrowitz (1985) uses the term 'medium theory' to refer to the body of literature that focuses on the technological aspects of media beyond their content. It aims to look beyond the content to the medium which reveals the key to its social impact (Croteau &amp; Hoynes, 2003:305).

==McLuhan's message==
[[Marshall McLuhan]] is best known for his phrase "the medium is the message". McLuhan believed that we should observe not only the media itself but 'the ways in which each new medium disrupts tradition and reshapes social life' (Croteau &amp; Hoynes 2003,307). He believed that the social impact of the media was that they became 'an extension of our senses, and alter our social world' (Croteau &amp; Hoynes, 2003:307). In his book ''[[The Gutenberg Galaxy]]'' (1962) McLuhan argued that when new media technologies were introduced into society, the balance of our senses were reworked, highlighting some at the expense of others. For example, print intensified the visual and separated it from our other senses; in particular sound. "McLuhan even argued that print media helped create a sensory environment that produced Western capitalist societies - an environment that was bureaucratic and organized around mass production, an ideology of individualism, and a commitment to the nation-state as the fundamental social unit."

==Technological determinism== 
Medium theory has always been criticized by its [[technological determinism]]. [[Raymond Williams]] is one of the most ardent critics of this concept. He believed that technological determinism 'emerges' from Technical study and experiments and then changes the sector or society in which it emerged from. Which means that we adapt towards the new technologies that arise because it is the new modern way of doing it.
The deterministic approach says that technology in itself has the power to change societies and the power to condition humans even though humans are the ones that's using said technology. Although [[McLuhan]] strongly believes that the introduction to any new media will change the way we live, Williams argue that the new technology in itself has no real significance to social value unless it has been adapted to existing social and economic conditions.

The '''Montreal Science Centre''' ({{lang_fr|Centre des sciences de Montréal}}) is a [[science museum]] in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], [[Canada]]. It is located on the [[King Edward Pier]] in the [[Old Port of Montreal]]. Established in 2000 and originally known as the ''iSci Centre'', the museum changed its name to the Montreal Science Centre in 2002.&lt;ref name="hist" /&gt; The museum is managed by the [[Old Port of Montreal Corporation]] (a division of the [[Canada Lands Company]], a [[crown corporation]] of the [[Government of Canada]]). The museum is home to interactive exhibitions on science and technology as well as an [[IMAX]] theatre.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15941">'''Neurorobotics''', a combined study of [[neuroscience]], [[robotics]], and [[artificial intelligence]], is the science and technology of embodied autonomous neural systems. Neural systems include brain-inspired algorithms (e.g. connectionist networks), computational models of biological neural networks (e.g. artificial [[spiking neural network]]s, large-scale simulations of neural microcircuits) and actual biological systems (e.g. ''in vivo'' and ''in vitro'' neural nets). Such neural systems can be embodied in machines with mechanic or any other forms of physical actuation. This includes [[robot]]s, [[prosthesis|prosthetic]] or wearable systems but also, at smaller scale, micro-machines and, at the larger scales, furniture and infrastructures.

Neurorobotics is that branch of neuroscience with robotics, which deals with the study and application of science and technology of embodied autonomous neural systems like brain-inspired algorithms. At its core, neurorobotics is based on the idea that the brain is embodied and the body is embedded in the environment. Therefore, most neurorobots are required to function in the real world, as opposed to a simulated environment.&lt;ref&gt;Chiel, H. J., &amp; Beer, R. D. (1997).

== Introduction ==
Neurorobotics represents the two-front approach to the study of intelligence.  Neuroscience attempts to discern what intelligence consists of and how it works by investigating intelligent biological systems, while the study of artificial intelligence attempts to recreate intelligence through non-biological, or artificial means. Neurorobotics is the overlap of the two, where biologically inspired theories are tested in a grounded environment, with a physical implementation of said model. The successes and failures of a neurorobot and the model it is built from can provide evidence to refute or support that theory, and give insight for future study.

== Major classes of neurorobotic models ==
Neurorobots can be divided into various major classes based on the robot's purpose. Each class is designed to implement a specific mechanism of interest for study. Common types of neurorobots are those used to study motor control, memory, action selection, and perception.

=== Locomotion and motor control ===
Neurorobots are often used to study motor [[feedback]] and control systems, and have proved their merit in developing controllers for robots. [[Animal locomotion|Locomotion]] is modeled by a number of neurologically inspired theories on the action of motor systems. Locomotion control has been mimicked using models or [[central pattern generator]]s, clumps of neurons capable of driving repetitive behavior, to make four-legged walking robots.&lt;ref&gt;Ijspeert, A. J., Crespi, A., Ryczko, D., and Cabelguen, J. M. (2007). From swimming to walking with a salamander robot driven by a spinal cord model. Science 315, 1416-1420.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other groups have expanded the idea of combining rudimentary control systems into a hierarchical set of simple autonomous systems. These systems can formulate complex movements from a combination of these rudimentary subsets.&lt;ref&gt;Giszter, S. F., Moxon, K. A., Rybak, I. A., &amp; Chapin, J. K. (2001). Neurobiological and neurorobotic approaches to control architectures for a humanoid motor system. Robotics and Autonomous Systems, 37(2-3), 219-235.&lt;/ref&gt; This theory of motor action is based on the organization of [[cortical column]]s, which progressively integrate from simple sensory input into a complex [[afferent nerve fiber|afferent]] signals, or from complex motor programs to simple controls for each [[skeletal muscle#Muscle fibers|muscle fiber]] in [[efferent nerve fiber|efferent]] signals, forming a similar hierarchical structure.

Another method for motor control uses learned error correction and predictive controls to form a sort of simulated [[muscle memory]]. In this model, awkward, random, and error-prone movements are corrected for using error feedback to produce smooth and accurate movements over time. The controller learns to create the correct control signal by predicting the error.  Using these ideas, robots have been designed which can learn to produce adaptive arm movements&lt;ref&gt;Eskiizmirliler, S., Forestier, N., Tondu, B., and Darlot, C. (2002). A model of the cerebellar pathways applied to the control of a single-joint robot arm actuated by McKibben artificial muscles. Biol Cybern 86, 379-394.&lt;/ref&gt; or to avoid obstacles in a course.

=== Learning and memory systems ===
Robots designed to test theories of animal [[memory]] systems. Many studies currently examine the memory system of rats, particularly the rat [[hippocampus]], dealing with [[place cells]], which fire for a specific location that has been learned.&lt;ref&gt;O'Keefe, J., and Nadel, L. (1978). The hippocampus as a cognitive map (Oxford: Clarendon Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=behavior-based&gt;Mataric, M. J. (1998). Behavior-based robotics as a tool for synthesis of artificial behavior and analysis of natural behavior. [Review]. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 2(3), 82-87.&lt;/ref&gt; Systems modeled after the rat hippocampus are generally able to learn [[cognitive map|mental maps]] of the environment, including recognizing landmarks and associating behaviors with them, allowing them to predict the upcoming obstacles and landmarks.&lt;ref name=behavior-based /&gt;

Another study has produced a robot based on the proposed learning paradigm of barn owls for orientation and localization based on primarily auditory, but also visual stimuli. The hypothesized method involves synaptic plasticity and [[Neuromodulation (biology)|neuromodulation]],&lt;ref name=barn-owls&gt;Rucci, M., Bullock, D., &amp; Santini, F. (2007). Integrating robotics and neuroscience: brains for robots, bodies for brains. [Article]. Advanced Robotics, 21(10), 1115-1129.&lt;/ref&gt; a mostly chemical effect in which reward [[neurotransmitters]] such as dopamine or serotonin affect the firing sensitivity of a neuron to be sharper.&lt;ref name=neuromodulation&gt;Cox, B. R., &amp; Krichmar, J. L. (2009). Neuromodulation as a Robot Controller A Brain-Inspired Strategy for Controlling Autonomous Robots. [Article]. IEEE Robotics &amp; Automation Magazine, 16(3), 72-80. {{doi|10.1109/mra.2009.933628}}&lt;/ref&gt; The robot used in the study adequately matched the behavior of barn owls.&lt;ref name=robotowl&gt;Rucci, M., Edelman, G. M. and Wray, J. (1999). Adaptation of orienting behavior: from the barn owl to a robotic system [Article]. IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation, 15(1), 96-110.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the close interaction between motor output and auditory feedback proved to be vital in the learning process, supporting active sensing theories that are involved in many of the learning models.&lt;ref name=barn-owls /&gt;

Neurorobots in these studies are presented with simple mazes or patterns to learn. Some of the problems presented to the neurorobot include recognition of symbols, colors, or other patterns and execute simple actions based on the pattern. In the case of the barn owl simulation, the robot had to determine its location and direction to navigate in its environment.

=== Action selection and value systems ===
Action selection studies deal with negative or positive weighting to an action and its outcome.  Neurorobots can and have been used to study *simple* ethical interactions, such as the classical thought experiment where there are more people than a life raft can hold, and someone must leave the boat to save the rest. However, more neurorobots used in the study of action selection contend with much simpler persuasions such as self-preservation or perpetuation of the population of robots in the study. These neurorobots are modeled after the neuromodulation of synapses to encourage circuits with positive results.&lt;ref name=neuromodulation /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hasselmo, M. E., Hay, J., Ilyn, M., and Gorchetchnikov, A. (2002). Neuromodulation, theta rhythm and rat spatial navigation. Neural Netw 15, 689-707.&lt;/ref&gt; In biological systems, neurotransmitters such as dopamine or acetylcholine positively reinforce neural signals that are beneficial. One study of such interaction involved the robot Darwin VII, which used visual, auditory, and a simulated taste input to "eat" conductive metal blocks. The arbitrarily chosen good blocks had a striped pattern on them while the bad blocks had a circular shape on them. The taste sense was simulated by conductivity of the blocks.  The robot had positive and negative feedbacks to the taste based on its level of conductivity. The researchers observed the robot to see how it learned its action selection behaviors based on the inputs it had.&lt;ref&gt;Krichmar, J. L., and Edelman, G. M. (2002). Machine Psychology: Autonomous Behavior, Perceptual Categorization, and Conditioning in a Brain-Based Device. Cerebral Cortex 12, 818-830.&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have used herds of small robots which feed on batteries strewn about the room, and communicate its findings to other robots.&lt;ref&gt;Doya, K., and Uchibe, E. (2005). The Cyber Rodent Project: Exploration of Adaptive Mechanisms for Self-Preservation and Self-Reproduction. Adaptive Behavior 13, 149 - 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sensory perception ===
Neurorobots have also been used to study sensory perception, particularly vision.  These are primarily systems that result from embedding neural models of sensory pathways in automatas. This approach gives exposure to the sensory signals that occur during behavior and also enables a more realistic assessment of the degree of robustness of the neural model. It is well known that changes in the sensory
signals produced by motor activity provide useful [[active perception|perceptual cues]] that are used extensively by organisms. For example, researchers have used the depth information that emerges during replication of human head and eye movements to establish robust representations of the visual scene.&lt;ref&gt;
Santini, F, and Rucci, M. (2007). Active estimation of distance in a robotic system that replicates human eye movements Journal of Robotics and Autonomous Systems, 55, 107-121.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kuang, K., Gibson, M., Shi, B. E., Rucci, M. (2012). Active vision during coordinated head/eye movements in a humanoid robot, IEEE Transactions on Robotics, 99, 1-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biological robots ==
[[Biological robot]]s are not officially neurorobots in that they are not neurologically inspired AI systems, but actual neuron tissue wired to a robot. This employs the use of [[cultured neural networks]] to study brain development or neural interactions. These typically consist of a neural culture raised on a [[multielectrode array]] (MEA), which is capable of both recording the neural activity and stimulating the tissue. In some cases, the MEA is connected to a computer which presents a simulated environment to the brain tissue and translates brain activity into actions in the simulation, as well as providing sensory feedback.&lt;ref&gt;DeMarse, T. B., Wagenaar, D. A., Blau, A. W. and Potter, S. M. (2001). "The Neurally Controlled Animat: Biological Brains Acting with Simulated Bodies." Autonomous Robots 11: 305-310.&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to record neural activity gives researchers a window into a brain, albeit simple, which they can use to learn about a number of the same issues neurorobots are used for.

An area of concern with the biological robots is ethics. Many questions are raised about how to treat such experiments. Seemingly the most important question is that of consciousness and whether or not the rat brain experiences it. This discussion boils down to the many theories of what consciousness is.&lt;ref&gt;Warwick, K. (2010). Implications and consequences of robots with biological brains. [Article]. Ethics and Information Technology, 12(3), 223-234. {{doi|10.1007/s10676-010-9218-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ebooks.iospress.nl/publication/38568|title=IOS Press Ebooks - Brains on Wheels: Theoretical and Ethical Issues in Bio-Robotics|website=ebooks.iospress.nl|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''See [[Hybrot]], [[consciousness]].''

== Implications for neuroscience ==
Neuroscientists benefit from neurorobotics because it provides a blank slate to test various possible methods of brain function in a controlled and testable environment. Furthermore, while the robots are more simplified versions of the systems they emulate, they are more specific, allowing more direct testing of the issue at hand.&lt;ref name=barn-owls /&gt; They also have the benefit of being accessible at all times, while it is much more difficult to monitor even large portions of a brain while the animal is active, let alone individual neurons.

With subject of neuroscience growing as it has, numerous neural treatments have emerged, from pharmaceuticals to neural rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;Bach-y-Rita, P. (1999). Theoretical aspects of sensory substitution and of neurotransmission-related reorganization in spinal cord injury. [Review]. Spinal Cord, 37(7), 465-474.&lt;/ref&gt; Progress is dependent on an intricate understanding of the brain and how exactly it functions. It is very difficult to study the brain, especially in humans due to the danger associated with cranial surgeries. Therefore, the use of technology to fill the void of testable subjects is vital. Neurorobots accomplish exactly this, improving the range of tests and experiments that can be performed in the study of neural processes.

'''Northwest Christian University''' ('''NCU''') is a private, Christian [[liberal arts college]] located in [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]], [[Oregon]] and is historically affiliated with the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)]] and the [[Christian churches and churches of Christ]]. ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' ranked it in the top twenty-five baccalaureate colleges in the western United States in its 2011 rankings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/eugene-or/northwest-christian-3208 America's Best Colleges 2011: Northwest Christian University]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Image:EugeneDivScho-OR.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Photo of Northwest Christian University (then Eugene Divinity School) and its founder, 1903]]
The school was founded  as a [[divinity school]] in 1895 by Disciple of Christ preacher and educator [[Eugene Claremont Sanderson]] as the '''Eugene Divinity School''' ('''EDS''').  In 1908 it became '''Eugene Bible University'''; in 1930 that name changed to '''Eugene Bible College'''. Finally, after a merger with [[Spokane University]] in 1934, it became known as Northwest Christian College and then Northwest Christian University in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nwcu.edu/about/quick-facts Quick Facts]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[Richardson, William J.

Grand Rapids, MN: Wm B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., 2004, p 572-573]&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 8, 2009, Dr. Joseph Womack was named as Northwest Christian University's 10th president, taking office on June 1, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://nwcunews.com/2009/12/16/womack-named-new-ncu-president/ |title=Womack Named New NCU President |access-date=2013-09-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206010720/http://nwcunews.com/2009/12/16/womack-named-new-ncu-president/ |archive-date=2013-12-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Womack is the son of NCU's eighth president, Dr. James Womack, who served from 1986 to 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://alumni.nwcu.edu/resource/resmgr/the_bulletin/04_spring.pdf Northwest Christian College Alumni Bulletin, Spring 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==
Northwest Christian University is located in east Eugene, at the corner of Alder Street and E. 11th Avenue, separated from the larger [[University of Oregon]] by the width of a single lane street. Founder Eugene Sanderson envisioned a school at which students would study the [[Bible]] and principles of Christian ministry under Eugene Divinity School's faculty, but take other subjects on the neighboring campus, a model he also attempted to set up at [[Manhattan Christian College]], located near [[Kansas State University]]. The Eugene Divinity School and its successive institutions maintained this arrangement with the University of Oregon until 1995, when the University of Oregon unilaterally discontinued it. Since that time NCU has grown to become a comprehensive liberal arts college. Today, NCU students occasionally take University of Oregon classes, have checkout privileges from [[Knight Library]], and take advantage of lectures and other events on the neighboring campus.

== Schools and academic majors ==
Northwest Christian University is organized into two schools: Liberal Arts &amp; Bible, and Professional Studies. The School of Liberal Arts &amp; Bible houses the academic majors of [[Biology]], [[Communication studies|Communication]], [[English studies|English]], [[Exercise Science]], [[History]], [[Interdisciplinary Studies]], [[Mathematics]], [[Psychology]], [[Theology|Bible and Theology]], [[Christian Ministry]], and [[Music]]. The School of Professional Studies includes both undergraduate majors in [[Accounting]], [[Business Administration]], [[Criminal Justice]], and [[Teacher Education]] as well as graduate programs in [[Business Administration]], Clinical Mental Health Counseling, [[School Counseling]], and [[Teacher Education]].  Programs are offered in three different formats: traditional undergraduate daytime, adult degree evening and online, and graduate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nwcu.edu/academics/majors |title=Academic Majors |access-date=2014-09-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006080459/http://www.nwcu.edu/academics/majors |archive-date=2014-10-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eugene Divinity School started with five students and one faculty member, Dr. Sanderson.  Today, NCU has 798 students served by over 25 full-time faculty, 62% of whom have doctoral degrees.

== Accreditation and affiliations ==
Northwest Christian University has been regionally accredited since 1962 by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nwccu.org/ NWCCU]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nwcu.edu/about/accreditation-memberships |title=Accreditations and Memberships  |access-date=2014-09-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140925122247/http://www.nwcu.edu/about/accreditation-memberships |archive-date=2014-09-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a member of the Oregon Alliance of Independent Colleges and Universities (OAICU), the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities (CCCU), and the Council on Undergraduate Research (CUR).  The education programs are approved by the Oregon Teacher Standards and Practices Commission (TSPC), the business programs are accredited by the International Assembly of Collegiate Business Education (IACBE), and the Clinical Mental Health Counseling programs is CACREP accredited (2017)(Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs) .

== Athletics ==
Northwest Christian teams, nicknamed athletically as the Beacons, are part of the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics]] (NAIA), primarily competing in the [[Cascade Collegiate Conference]] (CCC). Men's sports include basketball, cross country, golf, soccer and track &amp; field; while women's sports include basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, softball, track &amp; field and volleyball.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gobeacons.com Beacon Athletics]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2015 NAIA Cross Country National Championship'''''
During the fall of 2015 the woman's cross country team won 1st place in the NAIA Cross Country National Championship in Charlotte, North Carolina. This was the first time Northwest Christian University's cross country team won 1st place in this championship. The 7 runners who competed at the meet were, Melissa Rios (Freshman), Rosa Schmidt (Sophomore), Shea Vallaire, (Junior), Michelle Fletcher, (Junior), Macie Gale, (Junior), and Alyssa Harmon (Junior).&lt;ref&gt;http://gobeacons.com/news/2015/11/20/WXC_1120155114.aspx?path=wcross&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable alumni==
*[[David Ray Griffin]], noted Process theologian and retired professor of theology at Claremont School of Theology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="829">The '''osmostat''' is the regulatory center in the [[hypothalamus]] that controls the [[osmolality]] of the [[extracellular]] fluid. The area in the anterior region of the [[hypothalamus]] contains the [[osmoreceptor]]s, cells that control osmolality via the secretion of [[antidiuretic hormone]] (ADH).

In neurological conditions such as [[epilepsy]] or [[paraplegia]], the osmostat can be pathologically reset, secreting ADH at a lower osmolality, which may cause [[hyponatremia]]. A ''reset osmostat'' is also a feature of [[SIADH]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion Differential Diagnoses|url=https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/246650-differential|website=emedicine.medscape.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paul Morris Fitts Jr.''' (May 6, 1912 – May 2, 1965) was a [[psychologist]] at the [[Ohio State University]] (later at the [[University of Michigan]]). He developed a model of human movement, [[Fitts's law]], based on rapid, aimed movement, which went on to become one of the most highly successful and well studied [[mathematical model]]s of human motion. By focusing his attention on [[human factors]] during his time as [[Lieutenant Colonel]] in the [[US Air Force]], Fitts became known as one of the pioneers in improving [[aviation safety]]. There are also indications Fitts worked in some capacity as a consultant concerning the interview of alleged UFO witnesses, and was planning work on how terrestrial or psychological explanations could account for UFO sightings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluebookarchive.org/page.aspx?PageCode=MAXW-PBB2-6|title=Project Blue Book Archive|website=www.bluebookarchive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
In 1965 he died unexpectedly at the age of 52.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=KfLhAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA291&amp;dq=Paul+Fitts+1965&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwii-qqTjvDWAhUJ0GMKHWeqC704ChDoAQglMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Paul%20Fitts%201965&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was President of Division 21 (Division of Applied Experimental and [[Engineering psychology]]) of the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA), in 1957-1958. The association now has a Paul Fitts honorary award. From 1962-63 Paul M. Fitts was president of the [[Human Factors and Ergonomics Society]].

== Education ==

He received degrees in psychology at the following universities:

* [[University of Tennessee]] (BS 1934)
* [[Brown University]] (MS 1936)
* [[University of Rochester]] (PhD 1938)

'''Plant pathology''' (also '''phytopathology''') is the scientific study of [[disease]]s in [[plant]]s caused by [[pathogen]]s (infectious organisms) and environmental conditions (physiological factors).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Agrios, George N. |title=Plant Pathology |edition=3rd |publisher=Academic Press |date=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organisms that cause infectious disease include [[fungus|fungi]], [[oomycetes]], [[bacterium|bacteria]], [[plant virus|viruses]], [[viroid]]s, [[virus]]-like organisms, [[phytoplasmas]], [[protozoa]], [[nematode]]s and [[parasitic plant]]s. Not included are ectoparasites like [[insects]], [[mites]], [[vertebrate]], or other [[Plant defense against herbivory|pests that affect plant health]] by consumption of plant tissues. Plant pathology also involves the study of pathogen identification, disease etiology, disease cycles, economic impact, [[plant disease epidemiology]], [[plant disease resistance]], how plant diseases affect humans and animals, pathosystem genetics, and management of plant diseases.

== Overview ==
{{See also|Morphological symptoms of plant diseases}}
Control of plant diseases is crucial to the reliable production of food, and it provides significant reductions in agricultural use of land, water, fuel and other inputs.  Plants in both natural and cultivated populations carry inherent disease resistance, but there are numerous examples of devastating plant disease impacts such as [[Irish potato famine]] and [[chestnut blight]], as well as recurrent severe plant diseases like [[rice blast]], [[soybean cyst nematode]], and [[citrus canker]].  However, disease control is reasonably successful for most crops. Disease control is achieved by use of plants that have been bred for good resistance to many diseases, and by plant cultivation approaches such as [[crop rotation]], use of pathogen-free seed, appropriate planting date and plant density, control of field moisture, and [[pesticide]] use. Across large regions and many crop species, it is estimated that diseases typically reduce plant yields by 10% every year in more developed settings, but yield loss to diseases often exceeds 20% in less developed settings.  Continuing advances in the science of plant pathology are needed to improve disease control, and to keep up with changes in disease pressure caused by the ongoing evolution and movement of plant pathogens and by changes in agricultural practices. Plant diseases cause major economic losses for farmers worldwide. The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] estimates indeed that pests and diseases are responsible for about 25% of crop loss. To solve this issue, new methods are needed to detect diseases and pests early, such as novel sensors that detect plant odours and [[spectroscopy]] and [[biophotonics]] that are able to diagnose plant health and [[metabolism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Advanced methods of plant disease detection.

[[File:Powdery mildew.JPG|thumb|right|[[Powdery mildew]], a biotrophic fungus]]

=== Fungi ===
Most phytopathogenic fungi belong to the [[Ascomycetes]] and the [[Basidiomycetes]].
The fungi reproduce both [[sexual reproduction|sexually]] and [[asexual reproduction|asexually]] via the production of [[spores]] and other structures. Spores may be spread long distances by air or water, or they may be soilborne. Many soil inhabiting fungi are capable of living [[saprotroph]]ically, carrying out the part of their life cycle in the [[soil]]. These are facultative saprotrophs.
Fungal diseases may be controlled through the use of [[fungicides]] and other agriculture practices. However, new [[Race (biology)|races]] of fungi often [[evolution|evolve]] that are resistant to various fungicides.
Biotrophic fungal pathogens colonize living plant tissue and obtain nutrients from living host cells. [[Necrotroph]]ic fungal pathogens infect and kill host tissue and extract nutrients from the dead host cells. Significant fungal plant pathogens include:{{cn|date=July 2017}}

[[File:Rice blast.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Rice blast]], caused by a necrotrophic fungus]]

==== Ascomycetes ====
* ''[[Fusarium]]'' spp. (Fusarium wilt disease)
* ''[[Thielaviopsis]]'' spp. (canker rot, black root rot, ''Thielaviopsis'' root rot)
* ''[[Verticillium]]'' spp.
* ''[[Magnaporthe grisea]]'' (rice blast)
* ''[[Sclerotinia sclerotiorum]]'' (cottony rot)

==== Basidiomycetes ====
* ''[[Ustilago]]'' spp. (smuts)
* ''[[Rhizoctonia]]'' spp.
* ''[[Soybean rust|Phakospora pachyrhizi]]'' (soybean rust)
* ''[[Puccinia]]'' spp. (severe rusts of cereals and grasses)
* ''[[Armillaria]]'' spp. (honey fungus species, virulent pathogens of trees)

=== Fungus-like organisms ===

==== Oomycetes ====
The [[oomycetes]] are fungus-like organisms.&lt;ref name="watermold" /&gt; They include some of the most destructive plant pathogens including the [[genus]] ''[[Phytophthora]]'', which includes the causal agents of [[Phytophthora infestans|potato late blight]]&lt;ref name="watermold" /&gt; and [[sudden oak death]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1111/mpp.12190| title=The Top 10 oomycete pathogens in molecular plant pathology| journal=Molecular Plant Pathology| pages=413–434| year=2015| last1=Kamoun | first1=S. | last2=Furzer | first2=O. | last3=Jones | first3=J.

Despite not being closely related to the fungi, the oomycetes have developed similar infection strategies. Oomycetes are capable of using effector proteins to turn off a plant's defenses in its infection process.&lt;ref name="enter host cell"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://phys.org/news199007038.html | title=Scientists discover how deadly fungal microbes enter host cells | publisher=Physorg | work=(VBI) at Virginia Tech affiliates | date=July 22, 2010 | accessdate=July 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plant pathologists commonly group them with fungal pathogens.

Significant oomycete plant pathogens include:
* ''[[Pythium]]'' spp.
* ''[[Phytophthora]]'' spp., including the potato blight of the [[Great Irish Famine]] (1845–1849)

==== Phytomyxea ====
Some [[slime mold]]s in [[Phytomyxea]] cause important diseases, including [[club root]] in cabbage and its relatives and [[powdery scab]] in potatoes. These are caused by species of ''[[Plasmodiophora]]'' and ''[[Spongospora]]'', respectively.

=== Bacteria ===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Bacterial Plant Pathogen]] --&gt;
[[File:Agrobacteriumgall.jpg|thumb|Crown gall disease caused by [[Agrobacterium]]|left]]
Most [[bacteria]] that are associated with plants are actually [[saprotrophic]] and do no harm to the plant itself. However, a small number, around 100 known species, are able to cause disease.&lt;ref name=JacksonRW&gt;{{cite book | author=Jackson RW (editor). | title=Plant Pathogenic Bacteria: Genomics and Molecular Biology | publisher=Caister Academic Press | year=2009 | isbn=978-1-904455-37-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bacterial diseases are much more prevalent in [[subtropical]] and [[tropical]] regions of the world.

Most plant pathogenic bacteria are rod-shaped ([[Bacteria#Morphology|bacilli]]). In order to be able to colonize the plant they have specific pathogenicity factors. Five main types of bacterial pathogenicity factors are known: uses of cell wall–degrading enzymes, [[toxins]], effector proteins, [[phytohormones]] and [[exopolysaccharide]]s.

Pathogens such as ''[[Erwinia]]'' species use cell wall–degrading enzymes to cause [[Bacterial soft rot|soft rot]]. ''[[Agrobacterium]]'' species change the level of [[auxin]]s to cause tumours with phytohormones. [[Exopolysaccharide]]s are produced by bacteria and block [[xylem]] vessels, often leading to the death of the plant.

Bacteria control the production of [[pathogenicity factors]] via [[quorum sensing]].

[[File:Vitis vinifera phytoplasma.jpg|thumb|right|[[Vitis vinifera]] with "Ca. Phytoplasma vitis" infection]]
Significant bacterial plant pathogens:
* [[Burkholderia]]&lt;ref name="abstract bacteria"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Bacteria as Plant Pathogens | publisher=Cornell University | date=October 1948 | author=Burkholder | journal=Annual Review of Microbiology | doi=10.1146/annurev.mi.02.100148.002133 | volume=2 | pages=389–412 | pmid=18104350}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Proteobacteria]]
** ''[[Xanthomonas]]'' spp.
** ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' spp.
* [[Pseudomonas tomato|Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato]] causes tomato plants to produce less fruit, and it "continues to adapt to the tomato by minimizing its recognition by the tomato immune system."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Virginia Tech| year=2011| title= Research team unravels tomato pathogen's tricks of the trade| url=http://www.vtnews.vt.edu/articles/2011/11/110311-fralin-tomatopathogen.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Phytoplasmas and spiroplasmas ====
{{Main|phytoplasma}}
''[[Phytoplasma]]'' and ''[[Spiroplasma]]'' are genera of bacteria that lack cell walls and are related to the [[mycoplasmas]], which are human pathogens. Together they are referred to as the [[mollicutes]]. They also tend to have smaller [[genomes]] than most other bacteria. They are normally transmitted by sap-sucking [[insects]], being transferred into the plant's [[phloem]] where it reproduces.
[[File:Tobacco mosaic virus symptoms tobacco.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tobacco mosaic virus]]]]

=== Viruses, viroids and virus-like organisms ===
{{Main|Plant Virus}}
There are many types of [[plant virus]], and some are even [[asymptomatic]]. Under normal circumstances, plant viruses cause only a loss of [[crop yield]]. Therefore, it is not economically viable to try to control them, the exception being when they infect [[perennial plant|perennial]] species, such as fruit trees.

Most plant viruses have small, single-stranded [[RNA]] [[genome]]s. However some plant viruses also have double stranded [[RNA]] or single or double stranded [[DNA]] genomes. These genomes may encode only three or four [[proteins]]: a [[replicase]], a coat protein, a [[movement protein]], in order to allow cell to cell movement through [[plasmodesmata]], and sometimes a protein that allows transmission by a vector. Plant viruses can have several more proteins and employ many different molecular translation methods.

Plant viruses are generally transmitted from plant to plant by a [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]], but mechanical and seed transmission also occur. Vector transmission is often by an [[insect]] (for example, [[aphid]]s), but some [[fungus|fungi]], [[nematode]]s, and [[protozoa]] have been shown to be viral vectors. In many cases, the insect and virus are specific for virus transmission such as the [[beet leafhopper]] that transmits the [[curly top]] virus causing disease in several crop plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Creamer|first=Rebecca |author2=H. Hubble |author3=A. Lewis|title=Curtovirus Infection of Chile Pepper in New Mexico|journal=Plant Diseases|date=May 2005|volume=89|issue=5|pages=480–486|doi=10.1094/PD-89-0480}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nematodes ===
{{Main|Nematodes}}
[[File:Nematode nodules.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Root-knot nematode]] galls|left]]
[[Nematodes]] are small, multicellular wormlike animals. Many live freely in the soil, but there are some species that parasitize plant [[root]]s. They are a problem in [[tropical]] and [[subtropical]] regions of the world, where they may infect [[crops]]. Potato cyst nematodes (''Globodera pallida'' and ''G. rostochiensis'') are widely distributed in Europe and North and South America and cause {{Nowrap|$300 million}} worth of damage in Europe every year. Root knot nematodes have quite a large host range, they parasitize plant root systems and thus directly affect the uptake of water and nutrients needed for normal plant growth and reproduction,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huynh|first=Bao-Lam|last2=Matthews|first2=William C.|last3=Ehlers|first3=Jeffrey D.|last4=Lucas|first4=Mitchell R.|last5=Santos|first5=Jansen R.

Nematodes are able to cause radical changes in root cells in order to facilitate their lifestyle.

=== Protozoa and algae ===
There are a few examples of plant diseases caused by [[protozoa]] (e.g., ''[[Phytomonas]]'', a [[Kinetoplastida|kinetoplastid]]).&lt;ref&gt;Jankevicius, J.V. et al. [http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0074-02761988000500073&amp;script=sci_arttext Ciclo biológico de ''Phytomonas'' / Biological cycle of ''Phytomonas'']. ''Memórias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz'',  Rio de Janeiro, v. 83, supl. 1, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; They are transmitted as durable [[zoospore]]s that may be able to survive in a resting state in the soil for many years. Further, they can transmit plant [[viruses]]. When the motile zoospores come into contact with a [[root hair]] they produce a plasmodium which invades the [[root]]s.

Some colourless parasitic [[algae]] (e.g., ''[[Cephaleuros]]'') also cause plant diseases.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

=== Parasitic plants ===
Parasitic plants such as [[mistletoe]] and [[Cuscuta|dodder]] are included in the study of phytopathology. Dodder, for example, is used as a conduit either for the transmission of viruses or virus-like agents from a host plant to a plant that is not typically a host or for an agent that is not graft-transmissible.

== Common pathogenic infection methods ==
* '''Cell wall-degrading enzymes''': These are used to break down the plant [[cell wall]] in order to release the nutrients inside.
* '''[[Toxins]]''': These can be non-host-specific, which damage all plants, or host-specific, which cause damage only on a host plant.
* '''Effector proteins''': These can be secreted into the extracellular environment or directly into the host cell, often via the [[Type three secretion system]]. Some effectors are known to suppress host defense processes. This can include: reducing the plants internal signaling mechanisms or reduction of phytochemicals production.&lt;ref name="effector"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://newsroom.ucr.edu/2587 | title=How do plants fight disease?

== Physiological plant disorders ==
{{Main|Physiological plant disorders}}

Abiotic disorders can be caused by natural processes such as [[drought]], [[frost]], [[snow]] and [[hail]]; [[flood]]ing and poor drainage; [[Micronutrient deficiency|nutrient deficiency]]; deposition of mineral salts such as [[sodium chloride]] and [[gypsum]]; [[wind]]burn and breakage by storms; and [[wildfire]]s. Similar disorders (usually classed as abiotic) can be caused by human intervention, resulting in [[soil]] compaction, [[pollution]] of air and soil, [[Soil salinity#Salinity due to irrigation|salinisation caused by irrigation]] and road salting, over-application of [[herbicide]]s, clumsy handling (e.g. lawnmower damage to trees), and [[vandalism]].{{cn|date=April 2017}}

{{Further information|Pest control|Antagonism (phytopathology)}}
;Quarantine: A diseased patch of vegetation or individual plants can be isolated from other, healthy growth. Specimens may be destroyed or relocated into a greenhouse for treatment or study. Another option is to avoid the introduction of harmful nonnative organisms by controlling all human traffic and activity (e.g., [[The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service|AQIS]]), although legislation and enforcement are crucial in order to ensure lasting effectiveness.
;Cultural: Farming in some societies is kept on a small scale, tended by peoples whose culture includes farming traditions going back to ancient times. (An example of such traditions would be lifelong training in techniques of plot terracing, weather anticipation and response, fertilization, grafting, seed care, and dedicated gardening.) Plants that are intently monitored often benefit from not only active external protection but also a greater overall vigor. While primitive in the sense of being the most labor-intensive solution by far, where practical or necessary it is more than adequate.
;Plant resistance: Sophisticated agricultural developments now allow growers to choose from among systematically cross-bred species to ensure the greatest hardiness in their crops, as suited for a particular region's pathological profile. Breeding practices have been perfected over centuries, but with the advent of genetic manipulation even finer control of a crop's immunity traits is possible. The engineering of food plants may be less rewarding, however, as higher output is frequently offset by popular suspicion and negative opinion about this "tampering" with nature.
;Chemical: (See: [[pesticide application]]) Many natural and synthetic compounds can be employed to combat the above threats. This method works by directly eliminating disease-causing organisms or curbing their spread; however, it has been shown to have too broad an effect, typically, to be good for the local ecosystem. From an economic standpoint, all but the simplest natural additives may disqualify a product from "organic" status, potentially reducing the value of the yield.
;Biological: [[Crop rotation]] may be an effective means to prevent a parasitic population from becoming well-established, as an organism affecting leaves would be starved when the leafy crop is replaced by a tuberous type, etc. Other means to undermine parasites without attacking them directly may exist.
;Integrated: The use of two or more of these methods in combination offers a higher chance of effectiveness.

== History ==
{{further|Timeline of plant pathology}}

Plant pathology has developed from antiquity, starting with [[Theophrastus]], but scientific study began in the [[Early Modern]] period with the invention of the [[microscope]], and developed in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=Ainsworth&gt;{{cite book | author=Aisnworth, G.C. | title=Introduction to the History of Plant Pathology |publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=1981 | isbn=0-521-23032-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''pulsar''' (from ''pulse'' and ''-ar'' as in [[quasar]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pulsar|title=Definition of PULSAR|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a highly magnetized rotating [[neutron star]] that emits a beam of [[electromagnetic radiation]]. This radiation can be observed only when the beam of emission is pointing toward Earth (much like the way a [[lighthouse]] can be seen only when the light is pointed in the direction of an observer), and is responsible for the pulsed appearance of emission. Neutron stars are very [[density|dense]], and have short, regular rotational [[Period (physics)|period]]s. This produces a very precise interval between pulses that ranges from milliseconds to seconds for an individual pulsar. Pulsars are believed to be one of the candidates for the source of [[ultra-high-energy cosmic ray]]s (see also [[centrifugal mechanism of acceleration]]).

The periods of pulsars make them very useful tools. Observations of a pulsar in a [[PSR B1913+16|binary neutron star system]] were used to indirectly confirm the existence of [[gravitational wave|gravitational radiation]]. The first [[exoplanet|extrasolar planet]]s were discovered around a pulsar, [[PSR B1257+12]]. Certain types of pulsars rival [[atomic clock]]s in their accuracy in keeping time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/09/us/pulsar-termed-most-accurate-clock-in-sky.html|title=PULSAR TERMED MOST ACCURATE 'CLOCK' IN SKY|last=Sullivan|first=Walter|publisher=The New York Times|website=NY Times|date=February 9, 1983|access-date=January 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of observation==

===Discovery===

The [[PSR B1919+21|first pulsar]] was observed on November 28, 1967, by [[Jocelyn Bell Burnell]] and [[Antony Hewish]].&lt;ref&gt;Pranab Ghosh, ''Rotation and accretion powered pulsars''. World Scientific, 2007, p.2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. S. Longair, ''Our evolving universe''. CUP Archive, 1996, p.72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. S. Longair, ''High energy astrophysics, Volume 2''. Cambridge University Press, 1994, p.99.&lt;/ref&gt; They observed pulses separated by 1.33 seconds that originated from the same location in the sky, and kept to [[sidereal time]]. In looking for explanations for the pulses, the short period of the pulses eliminated most astrophysical sources of radiation, such as [[star]]s, and since the pulses followed [[Sidereal_time|sidereal time]], it could not be man-made [[radio frequency interference]]. When observations with another telescope confirmed the emission, it eliminated any sort of instrumental effects. At this point, Bell Burnell said of herself and Hewish that "we did not really believe that we had picked up signals from another civilization, but obviously the idea had crossed our minds and we had no proof that it was an entirely natural radio emission. It is an interesting problem—if one thinks one may have detected life elsewhere in the universe, how does one announce the results responsibly?"&lt;ref name="cosmic_search"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;  Even so, they nicknamed the signal  '''LGM-1''', for "[[little green men]]" (a playful name for intelligent [[extraterrestrial life|beings of extraterrestrial origin]]). It was not until a second pulsating source was discovered in a different part of the sky that the "LGM hypothesis" was entirely abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Science | date = 23 April 2004 | volume = 304 | issue = 5670 | page = 489 | author = Bell Burnell, S.

Although CP 1919 emits in [[radio waves|radio wavelengths]], pulsars have subsequently been found to emit in visible light, [[X-ray]], and [[gamma ray]] wavelengths.&lt;ref&gt;Courtland, Rachel.

The word "pulsar" is a portmanteau of 'pulsating' and '[[quasar]]', and first appeared in print in 1968:

{{quote|An entirely novel kind of star came to light on Aug. 6 last year and was referred to, by astronomers, as LGM (Little Green Men). Now it is thought to be a novel type between a white dwarf and a neutron [star]. The name Pulsar is likely to be given to it. Dr. A. Hewish told me yesterday: "… I am sure that today every radio telescope is looking at the Pulsars."&lt;ref&gt;''Daily Telegraph,'' 21/3, 5 March 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The existence of neutron stars was first proposed by [[Walter Baade]] and [[Fritz Zwicky]] in 1934, when they argued that a small, dense star consisting primarily of neutrons would result from a [[supernova]].&lt;ref name="Baade1934"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.46.76.2| title = Remarks on Super-Novae and Cosmic Rays| year = 1934| last1 = Baade | first1 = W.| last2 = Zwicky | first2 = F.| journal = Physical Review| volume = 46| pages = 76|bibcode = 1934PhRv...46...76B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the idea of magnetic flux conservation from magnetic main sequence stars, [[Lodewijk Woltjer]] proposed in 1964 that such neutron stars might contain magnetic fields as large as 10^14 to 10^16 G.&lt;ref name="Woltjer1964"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Woltjer | first1 = L. | title = X-rays and Type I Supernovae | doi = 10.1086/148028 | journal = Astrophysical Journal | volume = 140 | issue = | pages = 1309 | year = 1964 | pmid = | pmc = | bibcode = 1964ApJ...140.1309W }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, shortly before the discovery of pulsars, [[Franco Pacini]] suggested that a rotating neutron star with a magnetic field would emit radiation, and even noted that such energy could be pumped into a [[supernova remnant]] around a neutron star, such as the [[Crab Nebula]].&lt;ref name="Pacini1968"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Pacini | first1 = F. | title = Energy Emission from a Neutron Star | doi = 10.1038/216567a0 | journal = Nature | volume = 216 | issue = 5115 | pages = 567 | year = 1967 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1967Natur.216..567P }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the discovery of the first pulsar, [[Thomas Gold]] independently suggested a rotating neutron star model similar to that of Pacini, and explicitly argued that this model could explain the pulsed radiation observed by Bell Burnell and Hewish.&lt;ref name="Gold1968"&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Gold | first1 = T.| title = Rotating Neutron Stars as the Origin of the Pulsating Radio Sources| journal = Nature| volume = 218| pages = 731| year = 1968| doi = 10.1038/218731a0| bibcode=1968Natur.218..731G | issue=5143}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of the [[Crab pulsar]] later in 1968 seemed to provide confirmation of the rotating neutron star model of pulsars. The Crab pulsar has a 33-[[millisecond]] pulse period, which was too short to be consistent with other proposed models for pulsar emission. Moreover, the Crab pulsar is so named because it is located at the center of the [[Crab Nebula]], consistent with the 1933 prediction of Baade and Zwicky.&lt;ref name="Lyne1998_pp1-7"&gt;Lyne &amp; Graham-Smith, pp. 1–7 (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, Antony Hewish and [[Martin Ryle]] became the first astronomers to be awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]], with the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] noting that Hewish played a "decisive role in the discovery of pulsars".&lt;ref name="nobel1974"&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1974/press.html | title= Press Release: The Nobel Prize in Physics 1974 | accessdate= 2014-01-19 | date = 15 October 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considerable controversy is associated with the fact that Hewish was awarded the prize while Bell, who made the initial discovery while she was his Ph.D student, was not. Bell claims no bitterness upon this point, supporting the decision of the Nobel prize committee.&lt;ref&gt;Bell Burnell, S. Jocelyn. Little Green Men, White Dwarfs, or Pulsars?

[[Image:Vela Pulsar jet.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[Vela Pulsar]] and its surrounding [[pulsar wind nebula]].]]
In 1974, [[Joseph Hooton Taylor, Jr.]] and [[Russell Hulse]] discovered for the first time a pulsar in a [[binary star|binary system]], [[PSR B1913+16]]. This pulsar orbits another neutron star with an orbital period of just eight hours. [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]] predicts that this system should emit strong [[gravitational radiation]], causing the orbit to continually contract as it loses [[orbital energy]]. Observations of the pulsar soon confirmed this prediction, providing the first ever evidence of the existence of gravitational waves. As of 2010, observations of this pulsar continue to agree with general relativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Timing measurements of the relativistic binary pulsar PSR B1913+ 16

In 1982, [[Don Backer]] led a group which discovered [[PSR B1937+21]], a pulsar with a rotation period of just 1.6 milliseconds (38,500 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = D. Backer | title = A millisecond pulsar | journal = Nature | volume = 300 | issue = 5893 | pages = 315–318 | date = 1982 | doi = 10.1038/300615a0|bibcode = 1982Natur.300..615B | last2 = Kulkarni | first2 = Shrinivas R. | last3 = Heiles | first3 = Carl | last4 = Davis | first4 = M. M. | last5 = Goss | first5 = W. M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Observations soon revealed that its magnetic field was much weaker than ordinary pulsars, while further discoveries cemented the idea that a new class of object, the "[[millisecond pulsar]]s" (MSPs) had been found. MSPs are believed to be the end product of [[X-ray binary|X-ray binaries]]. Owing to their extraordinarily rapid and stable rotation, MSPs can be used by [[astronomers]] as clocks rivaling the stability of the best [[atomic clocks]] on Earth. Factors affecting the arrival time of pulses at Earth by more than a few hundred [[nanosecond]]s can be easily detected and used to make precise measurements. Physical parameters accessible through pulsar timing include the 3D position of the pulsar, its [[proper motion]], the [[electron]] content of the [[interstellar medium]] along the propagation path, the orbital parameters of any binary companion, the pulsar rotation period and its evolution with time. (These are computed from the raw timing data by [[Tempo (astronomy)|Tempo]], a computer program specialized for this task.) After these factors have been taken into account, deviations between the observed arrival times and predictions made using these parameters can be found and attributed to one of three possibilities: intrinsic variations in the spin period of the pulsar, errors in the realization of [[Terrestrial Time]] against which arrival times were measured, or the presence of background gravitational waves. Scientists are currently attempting to resolve these possibilities by comparing the deviations seen between several different pulsars, forming what is known as a [[pulsar timing array]]. The goal of these efforts is to develop a pulsar-based [[time standard]] precise enough to make the first ever direct detection of gravitational waves.
In June 2006, the astronomer [[John Middleditch]] and his team at [[LANL]] announced the first prediction of [[Glitch (astronomy)|pulsar glitches]] with observational data from the [[Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer]]. They used observations of the pulsar [[PSR J0537-6910]].

In 1992, [[Aleksander Wolszczan]] discovered the first [[extrasolar planet]]s around [[PSR B1257+12]]. This discovery presented important evidence concerning the widespread existence of planets outside the [[Solar System]], although it is very unlikely that any [[organism|life form]] could survive in the environment of intense radiation near a pulsar.

In 2016, [[AR Scorpii]] was identified as the first pulsar in which the compact object is a white dwarf instead of a neutron star.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buckley|first=D. A.

==Nomenclature==
Initially pulsars were named with letters of the discovering observatory followed by their [[right ascension]] (e.g. CP 1919). As more pulsars were discovered, the letter code became unwieldy, and so the convention then arose of using the letters PSR (Pulsating Source of Radio) followed by the pulsar's right ascension and degrees of [[declination]] (e.g. PSR 0531+21) and sometimes declination to a tenth of a degree (e.g. PSR 1913+16.7). Pulsars appearing very close together sometimes have letters appended (e.g. PSR 0021-72C and PSR 0021-72D).

The modern convention prefixes the older numbers with a B (e.g. PSR B1919+21), with the B meaning the coordinates are for the 1950.0 epoch. All new pulsars have a J indicating 2000.0 coordinates and also have declination including minutes (e.g. PSR J1921+2153). Pulsars that were discovered before 1993 tend to retain their B names rather than use their J names (e.g. PSR J1921+2153 is more commonly known as PSR B1919+21). Recently discovered pulsars only have a J name (e.g. [[PSR J0437-4715]]). All pulsars have a J name that provides more precise coordinates of its location in the sky.&lt;ref&gt;Lyne, Andrew G.; Graham-Smith, Francis. ''Pulsar Astronomy.'' Cambridge University Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation, mechanism, turn off==
[[Image:Pulsar schematic.svg|thumb|right|200px|Schematic view of a pulsar. The sphere in the middle represents the neutron star, the curves indicate the magnetic field lines, the protruding cones represent the emission beams and the green line represents the axis on which the star rotates.]]
The events leading to the formation of a pulsar begin when the core of a massive star is compressed during a [[supernova]], which collapses into a neutron star. The neutron star retains most of its [[angular momentum]], and since it has only a tiny fraction of its progenitor's radius (and therefore its [[moment of inertia]] is sharply reduced), it is formed with very high rotation speed. A beam of [[radiation]] is emitted along the magnetic axis of the pulsar, which spins along with the rotation of the neutron star.  The magnetic axis of the pulsar determines the direction of the electromagnetic beam, with the magnetic axis not necessarily being the same as its rotational axis. This misalignment causes the beam to be seen once for every rotation of the neutron star, which leads to the "pulsed" nature of its appearance.

In rotation-powered pulsars, the beam originates from the [[rotational energy]] of the neutron star, which generates an electrical field from the movement of the very strong magnetic field, resulting in the acceleration of protons and electrons on the star surface and the creation of an electromagnetic beam emanating from the poles of the magnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www3.amherst.edu/~gsgreenstein/progs/animations/pulsar_beacon/ | title = Pulsar Beacon Animation | accessdate = 2010-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/science/know_l2/pulsars.html | title = Pulsars | accessdate = 2010-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rotation slows down over time as [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] power is emitted.  When a pulsar's spin period slows down sufficiently, the radio pulsar mechanism is believed to turn off (the so-called "death line").  This turn-off seems to take place after about 10–100 million years, which means of all the neutron stars born in the 13.6 billion year age of the universe, around 99% no longer pulsate.&lt;ref name="cv.nrao.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cv.nrao.edu/course/astr534/Pulsars.html|title=Pulsars|website=www.cv.nrao.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the general picture of pulsars as rapidly rotating neutron stars is widely accepted, Werner Becker of the [[Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics]] said in 2006, "The theory of how pulsars emit their radiation is still in its infancy, even after nearly forty years of work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMB6IBUQPE_index_0.html |title= Old Pulsars Still Have New Tricks to Teach Us |publisher=[[European Space Agency|ESA]] |date=26 July 2006 |accessdate=30 April 2013|work=Staff }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Categories==
Three distinct classes of pulsars are currently known to [[astronomer]]s,  according to the source of the power of the electromagnetic radiation:

*Rotation-powered pulsars, where the loss of rotational energy of the star provides the power,
*[[Accretion-powered pulsar]]s (accounting for most but not all [[X-ray pulsar]]s), where the [[Potential energy#Gravitational potential energy|gravitational potential energy]] of [[accretion (astrophysics)|accreted]] matter is the power source (producing X-rays that are observable from the Earth).
*[[Magnetar]]s, where the decay of an extremely strong [[magnetic field]] provides the electromagnetic power.

Although all three classes of objects are neutron stars, their observable behavior and the underlying physics are quite different. There are, however, connections. For example, [[X-ray pulsar]]s are probably old rotationally-powered pulsars that have already lost most of their power, and have only become visible again after their [[binary star|binary companion]]s had expanded and began transferring matter on to the neutron star. The process of accretion can in turn transfer enough [[angular momentum]] to the neutron star to "recycle" it as a rotation-powered [[millisecond pulsar]]. As this matter lands on the neutron star, it is thought to "bury" the magnetic field of the neutron star (although the details are unclear), leaving millisecond pulsars with magnetic fields 1000-10,000 times weaker than average pulsars. This low magnetic field is less effective at slowing the pulsar's rotation, so millisecond pulsars live for billions of years, making them the oldest known pulsars.  Millisecond pulsars are seen in globular clusters, which stopped forming neutron stars billions of years ago.&lt;ref name="cv.nrao.edu"/&gt;

Of interest to the study of the state of the matter in a neutron
star are the ''[[Glitch (astronomy)|glitches]]'' observed in the rotation velocity
of the neutron star. This velocity is decreasing slowly but steadily, except by sudden variations. One model put forward to explain these glitches is that they are the result of "starquakes" that adjust the crust of the neutron star. Models where the glitch is due to a decoupling of the possibly [[superconductivity|superconducting]] interior of the star have also been advanced. In both cases, the star's [[moment of inertia]] changes, but its [[angular momentum]] does not, resulting in a change in rotation rate.

===Disrupted recycled pulsar===
When two massive stars are born close together from the same cloud of gas, they can form a binary system and orbit each other from birth. If those two stars are at least a few times as massive as our sun, their lives will both end in supernova explosions. The more massive star explodes first, leaving behind a neutron star. If the explosion does not kick the second star away, the binary system survives. The neutron star can now be visible as a radio pulsar, and it slowly loses energy and spins down. Later, the second star can swell up, allowing the neutron star to suck up its matter. The matter falling onto the neutron star spins it up and reduces its magnetic field. This is called "recycling" because it returns the neutron star to a quickly-spinning state. Finally, the second star also explodes in a supernova, producing another neutron star. If this second explosion also fails to disrupt the binary, a double neutron star binary is formed. Otherwise, the spun-up neutron star is left with no companion and becomes a "disrupted recycled pulsar", spinning between a few and 50 times per second.&lt;ref&gt;Background material on "Disrupted Recycled Pulsar" in press release on the pulsar found by Einstein@Home {{cite web |url=http://www.aei.mpg.de/pdf/pm_news/2010/PM2010_Einstein_Home_pulsar_engl.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100814144713/http://www.aei.mpg.de/pdf/pm_news/2010/PM2010_Einstein_Home_pulsar_engl.pdf |archivedate=2010-08-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

The discovery of pulsars allowed astronomers to study an object never observed before, the [[neutron star]]. This kind of object is the only place where the behavior of matter at [[atomic nucleus|nuclear]] density can be observed (though not directly). Also, millisecond pulsars have allowed a test of [[general relativity]] in conditions of an intense gravitational field.

Generally, the regularity of pulsar emission does not rival the stability of [[atomic clocks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Colloquium: Comparison of Astrophysical and Terrestrial Frequency Standards

 |bibcode=2011RvMP...83....1H}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for some millisecond pulsars, the regularity of pulsation is even more precise than an atomic clock.&lt;ref name=Matsakis1997&gt;{{cite journal | author = Matsakis, D.

''Timing noise'' is the name for rotational irregularities observed in all pulsars.  This timing noise is observable as random wandering in the pulse frequency or phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saao.ac.za/~wgssa/as4/urama.html|title=African Skies 4 – Radio Pulsar Glitch Studies&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is unknown whether timing noise is related to pulsar [[Glitch (astronomy)|glitches]].

===Probes of the interstellar medium===
The radiation from pulsars passes through the [[interstellar medium]] (ISM) before reaching Earth. Free [[electron]]s in the warm (8000&amp;nbsp;K), ionized component of the ISM and [[H II region]]s affect the radiation in two primary ways. The resulting changes to the pulsar's radiation provide an important probe of the ISM itself.&lt;ref name=Ferriere&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ferrière |first1=Katia |title=The Interstellar Environment of Our Galaxy |journal=Reviews of Modern Physics |volume=73 |issue=4 |pages=1031–1066 |date=2001 |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.73.1031|arxiv = astro-ph/0106359 |bibcode = 2001RvMP...73.1031F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the [[dispersion (optics)|dispersive]] nature of the interstellar [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], lower-frequency radio waves travel through the medium slower than higher-frequency radio waves. The resulting delay in the arrival of pulses at a range of frequencies is directly measurable as the ''[[dispersion measure]]'' of the pulsar. The dispersion measure is the total [[column density]] of free electrons between the observer and the pulsar,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{DM} = \int_0^D n_e(s) ds,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the distance from the pulsar to the observer and &lt;math&gt;n_e&lt;/math&gt; is the electron density of the ISM. The dispersion measure is used to construct models of the free electron distribution in the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{cite journal |author=Taylor, J. H. |author2=Cordes, J. M. | bibcode=1993ApJ...411..674T |title=Pulsar Distances and the Galactic Distribution of Free Electrons |doi=10.1086/172870 |journal=Astrophysical Journal |volume=411 |date=1993 |page=674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, [[turbulence]] in the interstellar gas causes density inhomogeneities in the ISM which cause [[scattering]] of the radio waves from the pulsar. The resulting [[scintillation (astronomy)|scintillation]] of the radio waves—the same effect as the twinkling of a star in [[visible light]] due to density variations in the Earth's atmosphere—can be used to reconstruct information about the small scale variations in the ISM.&lt;ref name=Rickett&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rickett, Barney J. |bibcode=1990ARA&amp;A..28..561R |title=Radio Propagation Through the Turbulent Interstellar Plasma |journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics |volume=28 |date=1990 |pages=561–605|doi = 10.1146/annurev.aa.28.090190.003021 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the high  velocity (up to several hundred km/s) of many pulsars, a single pulsar scans the ISM rapidly, which results in changing scintillation patterns over timescales of a few minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rickett, Barney J. |author2=Lyne, Andrew G. |author3=Gupta, Yashwant |bibcode=1997MNRAS.287..739R |title=Interstellar Fringes from Pulsar B0834+06 |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] |volume=287 |date=1997 |pages=739–752|doi=10.1093/mnras/287.4.739}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Probes of space-time===
Pulsars orbiting within the curved [[space-time]] around [[Sagittarius A*|Sgr A*]], the [[supermassive black hole]] at the center of the Milky Way, could serve as probes of gravity in the strong-field regime.&lt;ref name="saha10"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Angelil | first1 = R. | last2 = Saha | first2 = P. | last3 = Merritt | first3 = D. | author3-link = David Merritt | title = Towards relativistic orbit fitting of Galactic center stars and pulsars | arxiv = 1007.0007 | date=2010 | doi=10.1088/0004-637X/720/2/1303 | volume=720 | journal=The Astrophysical Journal | pages=1303–1310 | bibcode=2010ApJ...720.1303A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arrival times of the pulses would be affected by [[special relativity|special]]- and [[general relativity|general-relativistic]] [[Doppler shift]]s and by the complicated paths that the radio waves would travel through the strongly curved space-time around the black hole. In order for the effects of general relativity [[Tests of general relativity|to be measurable]] with current instruments, pulsars with orbital periods less than about 10 years would need to be discovered;&lt;ref name=saha10/&gt; such pulsars would orbit at distances inside 0.01 pc from Sgr A*.  Searches are currently underway; at present, five pulsars are known to lie within 100 pc from Sgr A*.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Deneva | first1 = J. S. | last2 = Cordes | first2 = J.

===Gravitational waves detectors===
There are 3 consortia around the world which use pulsars to search for [[gravitational waves]]. In Europe, there is the [[European Pulsar Timing Array]] (EPTA); there is the [[Parkes Pulsar Timing Array]] (PPTA) in Australia; and there is the [[North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves]] (NANOGrav) in Canada and the US.  Together, the consortia form the [[International Pulsar Timing Array]] (IPTA).  The pulses from [[Millisecond Pulsars]] (MSPs) are used as a system of Galactic clocks. Disturbances in the clocks will be measurable at Earth. A disturbance from a passing gravitational wave will have a particular signature across the ensemble of pulsars, and will be thus detected.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12498">The '''role of chance, or''' "'''[[luck]]'''", '''in science''' comprises all ways in which unexpected discoveries are made.

Many domains, especially psychology, are concerned with the way science interacts with chance — particularly "[[serendipity]]" (accidents that, through sagacity, are transformed into opportunity). Psychologist Kevin Dunbar and colleagues estimate that between 30% and 50% of all scientific discoveries are accidental in some sense (see [[#Serendipitous discoveries|examples below]]).&lt;ref name="DunbarFugelsangLuck"/&gt;

Psychologist Alan A. Baumeister says a scientist must be "sagacious" (attentive and clever) to benefit from an accident.&lt;ref name=AABaumeister/&gt; Dunbar quotes [[Louis Pasteur]]'s saying that "Chance favors only the prepared mind".&lt;ref&gt;Oersted vit tout à coup (par hasard, direz-vous peut-être, mais souvenez-vous que, dans les champs de l'observation, le hasard ne favorise que les esprits préparés), il vit tout à coup l'aiguille se mouvoir et prendre une position très différente de celle que lui assigne le magnétisme terrestre.&lt;/ref&gt; The prepared mind, Dunbar suggests, is one trained for observational rigor. Dunbar adds that there is a great deal of writing about the role that serendipity ("happy accidents") plays in the scientific method.&lt;ref name=DunbarFugelsangLuck&gt;Dunbar, K., &amp; Fugelsang, J. (2005). Causal thinking in science: How scientists and students interpret the unexpected. In M. E. Gorman, R. D. Tweney, D. Gooding &amp; A. Kincannon (Eds.), Scientific and Technological Thinking (pp. 57–79). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Darden, L. (1997). Strategies for discovering mechanisms: Schema instantiation, modular subassembly, forward chaining/backtracking. Proceedings of the 1997 Biennial Meeting of the Philosophy of Science Association.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thagard, P. (1999). How Scientists Explain Disease.

Cognitive Science, 12, 139–175.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research suggests that scientists are taught various [[heuristics]] and practices that allow their investigations to benefit, and not suffer, from accidents.&lt;ref name="DunbarFugelsangLuck"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oliver, J.E. 1991"&gt;Oliver, J.E. (1991) Ch2. of The incomplete guide to the art of discovery. New York:NY, Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; First, careful [[scientific control|control conditions]] allow scientists to properly identify something as "unexpected". Once a finding is recognized as legitimately unexpected and in need of explaining, researchers can attempt to explain it: They work across various disciplines, with various colleagues, trying various analogies in order to understand the first curious finding.&lt;ref name="DunbarFugelsangLuck"/&gt;

==Preparing to make discoveries==
[[File:DunbarFugelsangLuckInScience.png|thumb|left|A model based on the work of Kevin Dunbar and Jonathan Fugelsang. The two say that the first step is to realize a result is unexpected and unexplained.]]
Accidental discoveries have been a topic of discussion especially from the 20th century onwards. Kevin Dunbar and Jonathan Fugelsang say that somewhere between 33% and 50% of all scientific discoveries are unexpected. This helps explain why scientists often call their discoveries "lucky", and yet scientists themselves may not be able to detail exactly what role luck played (see also [[introspection illusion]]). Dunbar and Fugelsang believe scientific discoveries are the result of carefully prepared experiments, but also "prepared minds".&lt;ref name="DunbarFugelsangLuck"/&gt;

The author [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]] calls science "anti-fragile". That is, science can actually use — and benefit from — the chaos of the real world. While some methods of investigation are fragile in the face of human error and randomness, the scientific method relies on randomness in many ways. Taleb believes that the more anti-fragile the system, the more it will flourish in the real world.&lt;ref name=Taleb&gt;Taleb contributes a brief description of anti-fragility,http://www.edge.org/q2011/q11_3.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Taleb/&gt;&lt;ref name=TalebBook&gt;Taleb, N. N. (2010). The Black Swan: Second Edition: The Impact of the Highly Improbable: With a new section: "On Robustness and Fragility". NY: Random House.&lt;/ref&gt; According to  M. K. Stoskopf, it is in this way that serendipity is often the "foundation for important intellectual leaps of understanding" in science.&lt;ref name=Stoskopf&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=AbstractPlus&amp;list_uids=16179740&amp;query_hl=2&amp;itool=pubmed_DocSum|title=Observation and cogitation: how serendipity provides the building blocks of scientific discovery |last=Stosskopf |first= M. K |publisher=American College of Zoological Medicine, Wildlife and Aquatic Medicine and Environmental and Molecular Toxicology |accessdate=1 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "[[Serendipity]]" is frequently understood as simply "a happy accident", but [[Horace Walpole]] used the word 'serendipity' to refer to a certain kind of happy accident: the kind that can only be exploited by a "sagacious" or clever person.&lt;ref name=Stoskopf/&gt;&lt;ref name=MertonBarber&gt;{{Cite book|first=Robert K. |last=Merton |first2=Elinor |last2=Barber |title=The Travels and Adventures of Serendipity: A Study in Sociological Semantics and the Sociology of Science|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |year=2004 |isbn=0691117543 }} (Manuscript written 1958).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Dunbar and Fugelsang talk about, not just luck or chance in science, but specifically "serendipity" in science.&lt;ref name="DunbarFugelsangLuck"/&gt;

Dunbar and Fugelsang suggest that the process of discovery often starts when a researcher finds bugs in their experiment. These unexpected results lead a researcher to self-doubt, and to try and fix what they ''think'' is an error in their own  methodology. The first recourse is to explain the error using local hypotheses (e.g. analogies typical of the discipline). This process is also local in the sense that the scientist is relatively independent or else working with one partner. Eventually, the researcher decides that the error is too persistent and systematic to be a coincidence. Self-doubt is complete, and so the methods shift to become more broad: The researcher begin to think of theoretical explanations for the error, sometimes seeking the help of colleagues across different domains of expertise. The highly controlled, cautious, curious and even social aspects of the scientific method are what make it well suited for identifying persistent systematic errors (anomalies).&lt;ref name="DunbarFugelsangLuck"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oliver, J.E. 1991"/&gt;

[[Albert Hofmann]], the Swiss chemist who discovered [[LSD]]'s [[Psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] properties when he tried ingesting it at his lab, wrote
{{quotation|It is true that my discovery of LSD was a chance discovery, but it was the outcome of planned experiments and these experiments took place in the framework of systematic pharmaceutical, chemical research. It could better be described as serendipity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maps.org/news-letters/v11n2/11222gro.pdf Maps Organization. (2001). "Stanislav Grof interviews Dr. Albert Hofmann, 1984". Esalen Institute. Big Sur. Volume 11. Number 2.]&lt;/ref&gt;}} Dunbar and colleagues cite the discoveries of Hofmann and others as having involved serendipity. In contrast, the mind can be "prepared" in ways that obstruct serendipity — making new knowledge difficult or impossible to take in. Psychologist Alan A. Baumeister describes at least one such instance: Researcher Roy Heath failed to recognize evidence of "pleasure brain circuits" (in the [[septal nuclei]]). When Heath stimulated the brains of his schizophrenic patients, some of them reported feeling pleasure — a finding that Heath could have explored. Heath, however, was "prepared" (based on prior beliefs) for patients to report alertness, and when other patients did, it was on the reports of alertness that Heath focused his investigations. Heath failed to realize he had seen something unexpected and unexplained.&lt;ref name=AABaumeister&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=AbstractPlus&amp;list_uids=16608738&amp;query_hl=4&amp;itool=pubmed_docsum|title=Serendipity and the cerebral localization of pleasure |last=Baumeister |first= A.A|publisher=Department of Psychology, Louisiana State University |accessdate=1 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The brain===
Fugelsang and Dunbar observe scientists while they work together in labs or analyze data, but they also use experimental settings and even [[neuroimaging]].&lt;ref name=DunbarFugelsangLuck/&gt; [[Functional MRI|fMRI]] investigation found that unexpected findings were associated with particular brain activity. Unexpected findings were found to activate the [[prefrontal cortex]] as well as the [[left hemisphere]] in general. This suggests that unexpected findings provoke more attention, and the brain applies more linguistic, conscious systems to help explain those findings. This supports the idea that scientists are using particular abilities that exist to some extent in all humans.&lt;ref name="DunbarFugelsangLuck"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gazzaniga, M. (2000). Cerebral specialization and interhemispheric communication: does the corpus callosum enable the human condition? ''Brain'', 123, 1293–326.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box|align=right|width=40%|quote  =  Absent sagacity, a chance observation of an important phenomenon will have no impact, and the observer may be denied historical attribution for the discovery.|source = Alfred A Baumeister &lt;ref name=AABaumeister/&gt;}} 
On the other hand, Dunbar and Fugelsang say that an ingenious experimental design (and control conditions) may not be enough for the researcher to properly appreciate when a finding is "unexpected". Serendipitous discoveries often requires certain mental conditions in the investigator beyond rigor. For example, a scientist must know all about what is expected before they can be surprised, and this requires experience in the field.&lt;ref name="DunbarFugelsangLuck"/&gt; Researchers also require the sagacity to know to invest in the most curious findings.&lt;ref name=AABaumeister/&gt;

==Serendipitous discoveries==
{{Main| List of discoveries influenced by chance circumstances}}

Royston Roberts says that various discoveries required a degree of genius, but also some lucky element for that genius to act on.&lt;ref name=Roberts&gt;Roberts, Royston M. (1989). Serendipity: Accidental Discoveries in Science. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Gaughan writes that accidental discoveries result from the convergence of preparation, opportunity, and desire.&lt;ref name=Gaughan&gt;{{Cite book |first=Richard |last=Gaughan |title=Accidental Genius: The World's Greatest By-Chance Discoveries |publisher=Metro Books |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4351-2557-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of luck in science is when drugs under investigation become known for different, unexpected uses. This was the case for [[minoxidil]] (an [[antihypertensive]] [[vasodilator]] that was subsequently found to also slow [[alopecia|hair loss]] and promote hair regrowth in some people) and for [[sildenafil]] (a medicine for [[pulmonary arterial hypertension]], now familiar as "[[Viagra]]", used to treat [[erectile dysfunction]]). 

The hallucinogenic effects of [[lysergic acid diethylamide]] (LSD) were discovered by [[Albert Hofmann]], who was originally working with the substance to try and treat [[migraines]] and bleeding after childbirth. Hofmann experienced mental distortions and suspected it may have been the effects of LSD. He decided to test this hypothesis on himself by taking what he thought was "an extremely small quantity": 250&amp;nbsp;micrograms. Hofmann's description of what he experienced as a result of taking so much LSD is regarded by Royston Roberts as "one of the most frightening accounts in recorded medical history".&lt;ref name=Roberts/&gt;

'''Schechter Institute of Jewish Studies''', ({{lang-he|מכון שכטר למדעי היהדות}}, '''''Machon Schechter''''') located in [[Jerusalem]], [[Israel]], is an academic institution affiliated with [[Conservative Judaism]]. 
==History==
Founded in 1984 by the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America|Jewish Theological Seminary]] (N.Y.) and Israel's [[Masorti movement|Masorti Movement]] as a rabbinical seminary known as "The Seminary of Judaic Studies," the Schechter Institute has been located since 1990 in [[Neve Granot]], a neighborhood behind the [[Israel Museum]].

The campus in Jerusalem, in addition to its graduate school, is home to the Schechter Rabbinical Seminary, TALI Education Fund and Midreshet Yerushalayim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/793446.html The Israeli architectural genome, [[Haaretz]]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Schechter Institute also operates the Legacy Heritage Center for Jewish Culture in the historic former Cafe Lorenz building in [[Tel Aviv]]'s [[Neve Tzedek]] neighborhood.

More than 600 graduate students specialize in fourteen Jewish study tracks including art, women's studies, family and community studies, teaching, informal education, and classical Jewish disciplines such as [[Bible]], [[Talmud]], [[Midrash]], and [[Jewish Thought]]. Its newest program - Marpeh - unique to Israel - combines Health-care Chaplaincy with a degree in Family and Community Studies.

The Schechter Institute has 56 full- and part-time faculty members and over 1,200 M.A. graduates. Many work in the Israeli school system as principals and teachers, in the Ministry of Education in management positions, including curriculum planning, or in the nationwide Community Center Association. Schechter research centers include the Center for Women and Jewish Law, the Center for Judaism and the Arts, and the Center for Applied Jewish Law.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3243">'''Service-oriented Software Engineering''' (SOSE) is a [[software engineering methodology]] focused on the development of software systems by composition of reusable services ([[service-orientation]]) often provided by other service providers. Since it involves composition, it shares many characteristics of [[component-based software engineering]], the composition of software systems from reusable components, but it adds the ability to dynamically locate necessary services at run-time. These services may be provided by others as [[web services]], but the essential element is the dynamic nature of the connection between the service users and the service providers.&lt;ref name=Cervantes&gt;Cervantes, Humberto and Hall, Richard S., [https://www.igi-online.com/downloads/excerpts/01%20Stojanovic.pdf "Technical Concepts of Service Orientation."] Chapter 1, pp. 1-26 in Stojanović, Zoran and Dahanayake, Ajanthap.

Idea Group Inc. (IGI), 2004. {{ISBN|978-1-59140-428-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service-oriented interaction pattern==
There are three types of actors in a service-oriented interaction: service providers, service users and service registries. They participate in a dynamic collaboration which can vary from time to time. Service providers are software services that publish their capabilities and availability with service registries. Service users are software systems (which may be services themselves) that accomplish some task through the use of services provided by service providers. Service users use service registries to discover and locate the service providers they can use. This discovery and location occurs dynamically when the service user requests them from a service registry.&lt;ref name=Cervantes/&gt;

'''Design standards''', '''reference standards''' and '''performance standards''' are familiar throughout business and industry, virtually for anything that is definable.  [[Sustainable design]], taken as reducing our impact on the earth and making things better at the same time, is in the process of becoming defined.   There are also lots of well organized specific methodologies that are used by different communities of people for different purposes.

== Design standards ==
One of the better known is the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) green building rating system, which uses a diverse group of hard measures of environmental quality and impacts to define a holistic approach to sustainable building and assign ratings to individual projects.

Sustainable design is really just a more determined effort to consider the whole range of impacts on our environment in making any decision. A more complete design guide, guided more by whole project impact measures, is the model offered by the U.S. cooperating agencies in the [http://www.wbdg.org/ "Whole Building Design Guide"].

Green construction codes and standards are beginning to emerge on the national code stage. The standards go beyond energy standards such as [[ASHRAE 90.1]] and the [[International Energy Conservation Code]] (IECC) to cover additional areas such as site sustainability, [[water efficiency]], indoor [[environmental quality]] and materials and resources. The first is [[ASHRAE 189.1]], Standard for the Design of High-Performance, Green Buildings Except Low-Rise Residential Buildings, published by ASHRAE in January 2010 in conjunction with the [[U.S. Green Building Council]] and the [[Illuminating Engineering Society]]. Standard 189.1 provides criteria by which a building can be judged as “green,” written in model code language that jurisdictions can use to develop a green building construction code.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Several organizations have developed their own ways of setting goals for energy reductions, such as [[Architecture 2030]] and for qualifying performance toward them such as [[Cradle to Cradle Design|Cradle to Cradle]].

== Design methods ==
Developing real methods for how to discover the design opportunities that would allow you to meet or exceed the standards was one of the objectives of the environmental design movement in architectural schools in the 1960s and '70s, but though some of the issues introduced then are still an important part of the process, not much actually changed about the methods of design.  Now with the combination of many more interactive tools and much higher stakes in the outcome, and long gestating rethinking about natural systems in general, a dramatic new revolution in methodology seems inevitable.

BIM (building information modeling) allows designers to work with many remote consultants on the same data file that represents all the decisions being made by the team.  That same file is available to the [[climate and energy]] and environmental impact analysis and cost analysis tools and consultants, ... and of course to the prospective contractors and the regulators.   Along with this new integrated access to the model there in needed a new way to integrate the conversation of so many people, each with some interest in reviewing each other's comments on the progress with the central design model.  That is likely to involve development of wiki tools for the process.  One such very early impliementation of a Wiki SD tool called [https://web.archive.org/web/20081007000010/http://www.connection.metadot.net/ "4Dsustainability"] organizes the project design evolution around the general learning process of '''how you define the problem''' by exploring its environment, and following that through the project.

The main difference between sustainable design methods and conventional design is incorporating the entire environment of the project's stakeholders on the design team, essentially, and that calls for new ways to explore connections and for more people and perspectives to be taken into account.  Other methods that recognize this requirement are the [http://www.aia.org/liv_sdat "AIA SDAT"] (sustainable design assessment team) program and the [http://www.scenariosforsustainability.org/index.php "Scenarios for sustainability"] process design tools.

The '''tale of Phyllis and Aristotle''' is a [[Cautionary tale|cautionary medieval tale]] about the triumph of a seductive woman, Phyllis, over the greatest male intellect, the ancient Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]]. It is one of several [[Power of Women]] stories from that time. Among early versions is the French '''''Lai d'Aristote''''' from 1220.

The story of the [[dominatrix]] and the famous intellectual was taken up by artists from the 12th century onwards, in media from stone sculpture in churches to panels of wood or ivory, textiles such as carpets and tapestries, engravings, oil paintings, brass jugs ([[aquamanile]]), and stained glass. Artists attracted to the theme include [[Hans Baldung]], [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], and [[Alessandro Turchi]].

==Story==
The tale varies in the telling, but the core of it is as follows: [[Aristotle]] advised his pupil [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] to avoid the [[Philip of Macedon|king]]'s seductive mistress, Phyllis, but was himself captivated by her. She agreed to ride him, on condition that she could play the role of [[dominatrix]]. Phyllis had secretly told Alexander what to expect, and he witnessed Phyllis proving that a woman's charms could overcome even the greatest philosopher's male intellect. Phyllis is also described as Alexander's mistress, or possibly wife, rather than his father's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Aristotle and Phyllis |url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/20121 |publisher=[[Art Institute Chicago]] |accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith2013"&gt;{{cite web |author=Smith, Justin E.

===Origins===
The story is said by the [[Louvre]] to derive from the German work &lt;!--''{{Aristoteles und Phyllis|de}}'' --&gt;by [[Jacques de Vitry]] in the 13th century.&lt;ref name=Louvre/&gt; The French work ''Le {{ill|Lai d'Aristote|fr}}'' (The Lay of Aristotle) is known from manuscripts dating from as early as 1220, attributed by scholars to either [[Henri d'Andeli]] or {{ill|Henri de Valenciennes|fr}}.&lt;ref&gt;Wathelet-Willem, Jeanne. "[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/rbph_0035-0818_1953_num_31_1_2167_t1_0084_0000_3 Henri d'Andeli. ''Le lai d'Aristote'', publié d'après tous les manuscrits par Maurice Delbouille]", in ''Revue belge de philologie et d'histoire'', 1953, Vol. 31, n° 31-1, pp. 84–87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;François Zufferey, "Un problème de paternité: le cas d'Henri d'Andeli. II. Arguments linguistiques", ''Revue de linguistique romane'', n° 68, 2004, pp. 57–78, and "Henri de Valenciennes, auteur du Lai d'Aristote et de la Vie de saint Jean l'Évangéliste", in ''Revue de linguistique romane'', n° 69, 2004, pp. 335–358.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The source of the work was still contested in 2007 - see Mihai Cristian Bratu, ''L'Émergence de l'auteur dans l'historiographie médiévale en prose en langue française'', Ph.D., New York University, 2007, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1386, the English poet [[John Gower]] included a summary of the tale in his ''[[Confessio Amantis]]'' (in English, unlike his other major works), a collection of stories of immoral love told in verse. It appears in the poem on [[Apollonius of Tyre]] (Book 8, 271–2018), where Gower quips that the philosopher's logic and syllogisms do not save him:&lt;ref name=DNBG&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Gower, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''I syh there Aristotle also'',&lt;br&gt;
:''Whom that the queene of Grece so''&lt;br&gt;
:''Hath [[bridle]]d, that in thilke time''&lt;br&gt;
:''Sche made him such a [[Syllogism|Silogime]],''&lt;br&gt;
:''That he foryat al his [[Logic|logique]];''&lt;br&gt;
:''Ther was non art of his [[Aristotle#Practical philosophy|Practique]],''&lt;br&gt;
:''Thurgh which it mihte ben excluded''&lt;br&gt;
:''That he ne was fully concluded''&lt;br&gt;
:''To love, and dede his obeissance''

Also in the 14th century, the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] John Herold wrote a Latin version of the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sarton |first1=George |authorlink=George Sarton |title=Aristotle and Phyllis |journal=Isis |date=1930 |volume=14 |pages=8–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Latin and English"&gt;{{cite web|title=Phyllis and Aristotle|url=http://www2.latech.edu/~bmagee/201/phyllis/phyllis_w_img.htm|accessdate=1 April 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121122070456/http://www2.latech.edu/~bmagee/201/phyllis/phyllis_w_img.htm|archivedate=22 November 2012|language=Latin|quote=ARISTOTLES, cum doceret Alexandrum ut se contineret ab accessu frequenti uxoris suae, quae erat pulcra valde, ne animum suum a communi providentia impediret, et Alexander ei acquiesceret, hoc advertens regina et dolens, coepit Aristotelem trahere ad amorem suum, quia multociens sola transibat cum pedibus nudis et dissoluto crine, ut eum alliceret.|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 15th century, it was featured in the German comedy ''Ain Spil van Maister Aristotiles'' (A play of Master Aristotle).&lt;ref name=Louvre/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Briski, Marija Javor |editor1=Winkelman, Johan H. |editor2=Wolf, Gerhard |title=Eine Warnung vor dominanten Frauen oder Behajung der Sinnenlust?

===Medieval===

The [[cautionary tale]] of the dominatrix who made a fool of the famous philosopher became popular across medieval Europe.&lt;ref name="Smith2013"/&gt; Medieval sculptors in Maasland created [[aquamanile]], jugs in the forms of scenes with human or other figures, depicting Phyllis and Aristotle. The story was depicted in a variety of media including stone, ivory, brass, carpet, [[tapestry]], and engravings.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Early Modern to Enlightenment===
Artists such as [[Hans Baldung]], [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], [[Bartholomeus Spranger]] and [[Jan Sadeler]] continued to exploit the theme, eventually with Phyllis entirely naked.&lt;ref name=Louvre&gt;{{cite web |title=Phyllis and Aristotle {{!}} The Triumph of Seduction over Intellect |url=https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/phyllis-and-aristotle |publisher=[[Louvre]] |accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alessandro Turchi]] called the woman [[Campaspe]], the mistress of Alexander. The works used media including engraving, stained glass, wood, and oil painting.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Nineteenth and twentieth centuries===
Artists such as [[Julio Ruelas]] continued to adapt the Phyllis and Aristotle theme.
[[Oscar Kokoschka]] produced a version in 1913.&lt;ref name="Hayton2016"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hayton |first1=Darin |title=The Curious History of Phyllis on Aristotle |url=http://dhayton.haverford.edu/blog/2016/02/19/the-curious-history-of-phyllis-on-aristotle/#fn:72587 |accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[zoology]], the standard ending for the name of a zoological tribe is "-ini". Examples include the tribes [[Goat-antelope#Tribe Caprini|Caprini]] (goat-antelopes), [[Hominini]] (hominins), [[Bombini]] (bumblebees), and [[Thunnini]] (tunas). The tribe Hominini is divided into subtribes by some scientists; subtribe [[Hominina]] then comprises "humans". The standard ending for the name of a zoological subtribe is "-ina".

In [[botany]], the standard ending for the name of a botanical tribe is "-eae". Examples include the tribes [[Acalypheae]] and [[Scilloideae#Hyacintheae|Hyacintheae]]. The tribe Hyacintheae is divided into subtribes, including the subtribe Massoniinae. The standard ending for the name of a botanical subtribe is "-inae".

In [[bacteriology]], the form of tribe names is as in botany, e.g., Pseudomonadeae, based on the genus name ''[[Pseudomonas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |chapter-url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8808/ |title=International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria: Bacteriological Code, 1990 Revision |chapter=Chapter 3: Rules of Nomenclature with Recommendations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Tufts University}}

===19th century===
[[Image:Tufts1853.jpg|thumb|300px|Tufts College, c. 1854]]
In the 1840s, the [[Universalist Church of America|Universalist Church]] wanted to open a college in New England, and [[Charles Tufts]] donated 20 acres to the church in 1852 to help them achieve this goal. Charles Tufts had inherited the land, a barren hill which was one of the highest points in the Boston area, called [[Walnut Hill, Medford, Massachusetts|Walnut Hill]], and when asked by a family member what he intended to do with the land, he said "I will put a light on it". His 20-acre donation (then valued at $20,000) is still at the heart of Tufts' now-150 acre campus, straddling [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]] and [[Medford, Massachusetts|Medford]]. It was also in 1852 that the [[Commonwealth of Massachusetts]] chartered Tufts College, noting the college should promote "virtue and piety and learning in such of the languages and liberal and useful arts as shall be recommended". During his tenure, Ballou spent a year travelling and studying in the United Kingdom. The methods of instruction which he initiated were based on the tutorials that were conducted in the [[University of Oxford]] and the [[University of Edinburgh]]. Now more than 160 years old, Tufts is the third-oldest college in the Boston area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://colleges.niche.com/rankings/overall-experience/top-oldest-colleges/massachusetts/ |title=Massachusetts's Oldest Colleges – College Rankings – College Prowler |publisher=Colleges.niche.com |accessdate=August 14, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814054952/http://colleges.niche.com/rankings/overall-experience/top-oldest-colleges/massachusetts/ |archivedate=August 14, 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having been one of the biggest influences in the establishment of the College, [[Hosea Ballou II]] became the first president in 1853, and College Hall, the first building on campus, was completed the following year. That building now bears Ballou's name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://dl.tufts.edu//view_text.jsp?urn=tufts:central:dca:UA069:UA069.005.DO.00001&amp;chapter=B00006 |title=Tufts Digital Library: tufts:central:dca:UA069:UA069.005.DO.00001 |access-date=July 17, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100629164157/http://dl.tufts.edu/view_text.jsp?urn=tufts:central:dca:UA069:UA069.005.DO.00001&amp;chapter=B00006 |archive-date=June 29, 2010 |dead-url=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The campus opened in August 1854. President Ballou died in 1861 and was succeeded by [[Alonzo Ames Miner]]. Though not a college graduate, his presidency was marked by several advances. These include the establishment of preparatory schools for Tufts which include [[Goddard College|Goddard Seminary]], [[Westbrook College|Westbrook Seminary]], and [[Dean College|Dean Academy]]. During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] the college actively supported the Union cause. The mansion of Major George L. Stearns which stood on part of the campus was a station on the [[Underground Railroad]]. In addition to having the largest classes spring up, 63 graduates served in the Union army. The first course of a three-year program leading to a degree in civil engineering was established in 1865, the same year MIT was founded. By 1869, the [[Crane Theological School]] was organized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AmCyc|wstitle=Tufts College}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miner's successor, [[Elmer Capen]] was the first president to be a Tufts alumnus. During his time, one of the earliest innovators was [[Amos Dolbear]]. In 1875, as chair of the physics department, he installed a working telephone which connected his lab in Ballou Hall to his home on Professors Row. Two years later [[Alexander Graham Bell]] would receive the patent. Dolbear's work in Tufts was later continued by [[Guglielmo Marconi|Marconi]] and [[Nikola Tesla|Tesla]].&lt;ref name=thennow&gt;{{cite web |url=http://emerald.tufts.edu/alumni/pdfs/then&amp;now.pdf |title=Then &amp; Now | publisher=Tufts University |accessdate=March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other famous scholars include [[William Leslie Hooper]] who in addition to serving as acting president, designed the first slotted armature for dynamos. His student at the college, [[Frederick Stark Pearson]], would eventually become one of America's pioneers of the electrical power industry. He became responsible for the development of the electric power and electric street car systems which many cities in South America and Europe used. Another notable figure is [[Stephen M. Babcock]] who developed the first practical test to determine the amount of butterfat in milk. Since its development in the college, the Babcock Test has hardly been modified. Expansion of the chemistry and biology departments were largely led by scholars [[Arthur Michael]], who was one of the first organic chemists in the U.S., and [[John Sterling Kingsley]], who was one of the first scholars of comparative anatomy.&lt;ref&gt;Tufts College (1952).

[[Image:Interior view of Barnum Museum with Jumbo.jpg|thumb|200px|Jumbo in the Barnum Museum of Natural History]]

[[P. T. Barnum]] was one of the earliest benefactors of Tufts College, and the Barnum Museum of Natural History (Barnum Hall) was constructed in 1884 with funds donated by him to house his collection of animal specimens and the stuffed hide of [[Jumbo]] the elephant, who would become the university's mascot. The building stood until April 14, 1975, when fire gutted Barnum Hall, destroying the entire collection.

On July 15, 1892, the Tufts Board of Trustees voted "that the College be opened to women in the undergraduate departments on the same terms and conditions as men". Metcalf Hall opened in 1893 and served as the dormitory for women. At the same meeting, the trustees voted to create a graduate school faculty and to offer the [[Ph.D.]] degree in biology and chemistry. In 1893 the Medical School opened and in 1899 the Boston Dental College was integrated into the [[Tufts University School of Dental Medicine|university]]. In 1890, the Department of Electrical Engineering was created, and in 1892–1893 the course of three-year program in civil engineering was extended to four years. With the advent of the four-year program the degrees granted were bachelor of civil or electrical engineering. Tufts College added the Department of Mechanical Engineering and the Department of Chemical Engineering in 1894 and 1898, respectively. In 1898, the trustees voted to formally establish an undergraduate College of Engineering.&lt;ref name="Russell, Miller E. 1966"/&gt;

===20th century===
[[Image:Tufts1910.jpg|thumb|300px|Walnut Hill as it appeared prior to the construction of Tisch Library and steps, circa 1910. In the center is Eaton Hall. The road to the right no longer exists.]]

The [[Jackson College for Women]] was established in 1910 as a coordinate college adjacent to the Tufts campus. In 1980 it was integrated with the College of Liberal Arts but is still recognized in the formal name of the undergraduate arts and sciences division, the "College of Liberal Arts and Jackson College". Undergraduate women in arts and sciences continued to receive their diplomas from Jackson College until 2002.

Tufts expanded in the 1933 with the opening of the [[Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy]], the first graduate school of international affairs in the United States. The Fletcher School began as a joint effort between Tufts and [[Harvard University]], funded by an endowment from longtime Tufts benefactor and alumnus Austin Barclay Fletcher. Tufts assumed full administration of the Fletcher School in 1935, and strong linkages between the two schools remain.

During [[World War II]], Tufts College was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] which offered students a path to a Navy commission.&lt;ref name="tuftsv-12"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uss.tufts.edu/undergradEducation/opportunities/AcademicAwardsList.pdf |title=General Academic Awards |publisher=[[Medford, Massachusetts]]: Tufts University |last= |first= |accessdate=September 26, 2011 |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to travel restrictions imposed by World War II, the [[Boston Red Sox]] conducted [[spring training]] for the [[1943 Major League Baseball season|1943 Major League season]] at Tufts College.&lt;ref name="Snyder"&gt;{{cite book|last=Snyder|first=John|title=365 Oddball Days in Red Sox History|year=2009|publisher=Clerisy Press|location=United States|isbn=1578603447|page=384}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, continued expansion was reflected in the change of the school's name to Tufts University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://dl.tufts.edu/catalog/tei/tufts:UA069.005.DO.00001/chapter/T00041 |work=Concise Encyclopedia of Tufts History|title=Tufts University, 1852|accessdate=April 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university experienced some growth during the presidency of [[Jean Mayer]] (1976–1992).&lt;ref name="nyt_mayer"&gt;McFadden, Robert D. "[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/02/us/jean-mayer-72-nutritionist-who-led-tufts-dies.html Jean Mayer, 72, Nutritionist Who Led Tufts, Dies]." ''[[The New York Times]]''. January 2, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Mayer established Tufts' veterinary, nutrition, and biomedical schools and acquired the Grafton and Talloires campuses, at the same time lifting the university out of its dire financial situation by increasing the size of the endowment by a factor of 15.&lt;ref name="nyt_mayer" /&gt;

The College of Engineering added graduate study to its curriculum beginning in 1961, with master's degrees available in four departments. It added Ph.D. programs in mechanical engineering in 1963, electrical engineering in 1964, engineering design in 1981, and civil engineering in 1985. In 1984 CEO and chairman of Analogic Corporation and NeuroLogica Corporation [[Bernard Marshall Gordon]] founded the Tufts Gordon Institute as the first educational institution created to foster entrepreneurship in the engineering fields. In 1991 the [[New England Association of Schools and Colleges]] accredited the institute to confer the degree of Master of Science in Engineering Management and in 1992 the Gordon Institute became part of the College of Engineering. In 1999, the College of Engineering became the School of Engineering, when oversight of graduate engineering programs was transferred from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. As part of the same reorganization the Faculty of Arts and Science became the Faculty of Arts, Sciences, and Engineering (AS&amp;E).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://gordon.tufts.edu/about-us/history | title=History – Tufts University Connection – Gordon Institute | publisher=Tufts University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, [[Hines Interests]] and TUDC, a subsidiary of the university, planned to break ground on the [[South Station Tower]]. Tufts had acquired the air rights from [[South Station]] in 1990, with former President Jean Meyer envisioning a tower that would be the center of medical research.

Tufts' main campus is located on [[Walnut Hill, Medford, Massachusetts|Walnut Hill]] in [[Medford, Massachusetts|Medford]] and [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]], about {{convert|5|mi}} from [[Boston]]. This campus houses all undergraduates in Arts &amp; Sciences and Engineering, the graduate programs at [[The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy]] and all of the graduate programs in Arts &amp; Sciences and Engineering. While the majority of the campus is in Medford, the Somerville line intersects it, placing parts of the lower campus in Somerville and leading to the common terms "Uphill" and "Downhill".

The "Uphill" portion of the campus comprises the academic and the residential "Rez" quads, and is enclosed by a wrought-iron fence. Classes that contributed to the building of the fence are commemorated along its length. The academic quad contains the earliest buildings and was primarily built from the middle of the 19th century to the beginning of the 20th century. One of Tufts' first buildings, [[Ballou Hall]] was constructed from 1852–1854 and was designed in the Italianate style by the well known Boston architect [[Gridley James Fox Bryant]]. Ballou Hall was later restored by [[McKim, Mead, and White]] in 1955–56, and houses the offices of the president, the provost, and several vice presidents and deans. Other notable buildings include: [[Packard Hall]] (1856), [[East Hall (Tufts University)|East Hall]] (1860), West Hall (1871), [[Goddard Chapel (Tufts University)|Goddard Chapel]] (1882), [[Goddard Hall (Tufts University)|Goddard Hall]] (1883), [[Barnum Museum of Natural History|Barnum Hall]] (1884), and [[Eaton Hall (Tufts University)|Eaton Hall]] (1908).&lt;ref&gt;Tolles, Bryant Franklin.

University Press of New England, {{ISBN|978-1-58465-891-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The New York firm [[Whitfield &amp; King]] was responsible for the design of Eaton Hall.

The "Uphill" residential quad contains more modern buildings. The most notable building is Carmichael Hall (1954), designed by Arland A. Dirlam. Dirlam also designed Bendetson Hall (1947) on the academic quad.&lt;ref&gt;Sauer, Anne. (November 2004) ''Tufts University''. Arcadia, {{ISBN|978-0-7385-0853-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=thennow /&gt; Adjacent to both quads is the Cabot Intercultural Center designed by [[ARC/Architectural Resources Cambridge, Inc.]] one of the Fletcher School's buildings. Many points on the hill have noted views of the [[Boston]] skyline, particularly the patio on the Tisch Library roof. It has been ranked one of the prettiest college campuses in the United States.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The "Downhill" portion can be accessed with the memorial stairs. Designed by the [[Olmsted Brothers]] in the 1920s, the memorial stairs form one of the main entrances to the university and allows direct access to the engineering school from the academic quad. Notable buildings around the engineering school include Bromfield-Pearson Hall (1893), Robinson Hall (1899), and Curtis Hall (1894). Boston architect [[George Albert Clough]] is responsible for the design of Curtis Hall and Goddard Hall. Additionally Arland Dirlam is responsible for the designs of many buildings downhill. These include Cohen Auditorium (1950), Hodgdon Hall (1954), and Jackson Gymnasium (1947).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://greenlineextension.eot.state.ma.us/documents/FinalEIR/techRpt/6.pdf|title=Historic Resources|accessdate=March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Administrative offices also occupy the surrounding neighborhoods and nearby [[Davis Square]], where Tufts makes [[payment in lieu of taxes|payments in lieu of taxes]] on some of its tax-exempt (educational) properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://somervilleresistat.blogspot.com/2010/07/tufts-contribution.html|title=ResiStat: Tufts' Contribution|accessdate=August 3, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222152654/http://somervilleresistat.blogspot.com/2010/07/tufts-contribution.html|archivedate=December 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine]] is located in [[Grafton, Massachusetts]], west of Boston, on a {{convert|634|acre|km2|adj=on}} campus. The school also maintains the Ambulatory Farm Clinic in [[Woodstock, Connecticut]] and the Tufts Laboratory at the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole on [[Cape Cod]].

===Talloires===
Tufts has a [[satellite campus]] in [[Talloires, France]] at the Tufts European Center, a former [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] [[priory]] built in the 11th century. The priory was purchased in 1958 by Donald MacJannet and his wife Charlotte and used as a summer camp site for several years before the MacJannets gave the campus to Tufts in 1978. Each year the center hosts a number of summer study programs, and enrolled students live with local families. The Tufts Summit Program is for American high school students during the month of July. Tufts in Talloires is a 6-week program for Tufts undergraduates that extends from the middle of May until the end of June. Additionally Tufts in Annecy is a 4-week program which provides French language learners a chance to practice and learn the language. The site is frequently the host of international conferences and summits, most notably the [[Talloires Declaration]] which united 22 universities toward a goal of sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ase.tufts.edu/europeanCenter/about/|title=Tufts University European Center in Talloires, France|publisher=|accessdate=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Talloires campus has been ranked as one of the best branch campuses by the National Association of Branch Campus Administrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tuftsdaily.com/news/talloires-program-ranked-among-best-branch-campuses-1.2844605#.UuKxGxAo7IU |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201232938/http://www.tuftsdaily.com/news/talloires-program-ranked-among-best-branch-campuses-1.2844605#.UuKxGxAo7IU |archivedate=February 1, 2014 |title=Talloires program ranked among best branch campuses |first=Abigail |last=Feldman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tufts University is an independent, privately supported, nonsectarian institution of higher education. Its official corporate name is ''The Trustees of Tufts College''. The university is governed by up to forty-one Trustees and no fewer than twenty-eight. The Trustees themselves are responsible for choosing their successors. In addition to the president the university appoints Charter Trustees (up to 30 members) who are elected by the board and Alumni Trustees (up to 10 members) who serve for up to five years. Generally Charter Trustees are elected by majority vote of the members. Alumni Trustees are elected by alumni. The Trustees appoint the President and other senior administrative officers of the university, and review and confirm faculty appointments as required. They determine the university's mission and purpose, review and approve changes in academic programs, monitor the university's financial condition, establish investment and institutional policies, and authorize the budget. The officers of the corporation include the Chair of the Board, three Vice Chairs, the Treasurer, the Secretary, the Provost, the President, who serves ex officio, and the Executive Vice President.

The [[List of Presidents of Tufts University|President of Tufts University]], who is elected by the Trustees is the chief executive officer of the university. Assisting the President in administering the university are the Provost, the Executive Vice President, the Treasurer, and the Secretary, all of whom are appointed by the Trustees on the nomination of the President and serve at their pleasure. As the 13th president Anthony Monaco was sworn on August 1, 2011. An accomplished leader, scientist and teacher, Monaco was formerly a professor and the Pro-Vice-Chancellor at the [[University of Oxford]]. His doctoral research led to his landmark discovery of the gene responsible for X-linked [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy|Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy]]. He worked on the [[human genome project]] at the [[Imperial Cancer Research Fund]] in London and in the human genetics laboratory at the Institute of Molecular Medicine in Oxford. Additionally he identified the first gene specifically involved in human speech and language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/11/30/noted_geneticist_to_lead_tufts/?page=2|date=November 30, 2010|accessdate=December 4, 2010|newspaper=BostonGlobe|title=Noted geneticist to lead Tufts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tufts is organized into ten schools. Each school has its own faculty, and is led by a [[Dean (education)|dean]] appointed by the [[president]] and the [[provost (education)|provost]] with the consent of the Board of Trustees. The School of Arts and Sciences and the School of Engineering are the only schools that award both undergraduate and graduate degrees. The five schools offering undergraduate education are: Arts and Sciences, the liberal arts college offering both the Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degree, the School of Engineering (also known as the [[Tufts Gordon Institute|Gordon Institute]]) offers the Bachelor of Science degree, the School of Special Studies which awards the degree of bachelor of fine arts through the [[Tufts School of the Museum of Fine Arts]]. The other two the [[Jonathan M. Tisch College of Citizenship and Public Service]] and the [[Experimental College (Tufts University)|Experimental College]] are non-degree granting.

The Tisch College was founded in 2000 "to educate for active citizenship" with the help of a $10 million gift from [[eBay]] founder [[Pierre Omidyar]] and his wife Pam. The school was renamed in 2006 after a $40 million gift from [[Jonathan Tisch]]. It has been called the "most ambitious attempt by any research university to make public service part of its core academic mission".&lt;ref&gt;Bombardieri, Marcella. [http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2004/03/14/at_tufts_civic_engagement_stretches_across_the_globe/ At Tufts, civic engagement stretches across the globe]. ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', March 14, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The college facilitates and supports a wide range of community service, civic engagement programs, research, and teaching initiatives across the university. The university runs on a semester based calendar with most undergraduate students finishing within four years, however, Tisch College provides an innovative 1+4 Bridge year program where students have the opportunity to take a community service based gap year before starting in Tufts. Current projects undertaken by Bridge Year Fellows involve serving as mentors and teachers to children, caring for rescued wild animals, contributing to renewable energy and sustainability projects. Current projects are based in Brazil, Nicaragua, and Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://activecitizen.tufts.edu/tufts1plus4/|accessdate=May 16, 2016|title=Tufts 1+4 Bridge-Year Service Learning Program}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the purview of the School of Arts and Sciences is the Experimental College, created in 1964 as a proving ground for innovative, experimental, and [[interdisciplinary]] curricula and courses. It offers the opportunity for students to take for-credit courses with non-academic practitioners in a variety of fields, and also from upper-level undergraduates who have a chance to design and teach their own courses. Another successful component of the Ex College is EPIIC, a year-long program begun in 1985 to immerse students in a global issue, which culminates in an annual symposium of scholars and experts from the field.

The [[Tufts School of the Museum of Fine Arts]] offers art programs with a major museum, the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.smfa.edu/partnerships | title=Partnerships | publisher= School of the Museum of Fine Arts |year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the key figures in the merger, [[Nancy Bauer (philosopher)|Nancy Bauer]] became the dean of the museum school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://now.tufts.edu/articles/nancy-bauer-named-dean-museum-school | title= Nancy Bauer Named Dean of Museum School | publisher= "Tufts Now" |year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graduate education is offered in eight of the schools. In addition to Arts and Sciences and Engineering Tufts offers graduate degrees in the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, the oldest U.S. school for international relations and foreign affairs, the School of Dental Medicine, the School of Medicine, the Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences, the Friedman School of Nutrition, and the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine. Additionally, the university did provide master's degrees in religion through the Crane Theological School. The school was dissolved in 1968.

In 2006, Dean of Arts and Sciences [[Robert Sternberg]] added experimental criteria to the application process for undergraduates to test "creativity and other non-academic factors", including inviting applicants to submit [[YouTube]] videos to supplement their application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/23/education/23tufts.html | work=The New York Times | title=To Impress, Tufts Prospects Turn to YouTube | first=Tamar | last=Lewin | date=February 22, 2010 | accessdate=May 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calling it the "first major university to try such a departure from the norm", ''[[Inside Higher Ed]]'' also notes that Tufts continues to consider the [[SAT]] and other traditional criteria.&lt;ref&gt;Jaschik, Scott (2006).

[[Tufts Daily]], November 15, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Lee Coffin announced on April 7, 2015 that Tufts would be accepting [[Illegal immigration|illegal immigrant]]&lt;!--Also called "undocumented" for people who wish to not give them stigma - Wikipedia uses "Illegal immigration" and "Illegal immigrant" in that article, so "illegal immigrant" is the most "neutral" word--&gt; students with and without [[Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals|Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)]]. Coffin said that undocumented students would no longer be considered international students, but rather domestic students. This was due to the activism of social justice group United for Immigrant Justice. The first cohort of undocumented students is in the class of 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tuftsdaily.com/news/2015/04/07/tufts-accept-undocumented-students-provide-financial-aid/ | title=Tufts to accept undocumented students, provide financial aid | date=April 7, 2015 | accessdate=December 2, 2015 | author=Kerstein, Arin}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university received 21,501 undergraduate applicants in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ferguson|first1=Laura|title=Record Number of Applications|url=https://now.tufts.edu/articles/record-number-applications|website=Tufts Now|publisher=Tufts University|accessdate=February 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1856, shortly after Tufts opened, its admissions application asked for statements of good character and for students to complete examinations in Greek, history, Latin, and mathematics. As part of these examinations they were asked to study a list of relevant textbooks. By 1905 the admissions requirements became lengthier and the examinations became more complex; the latter required students to write essays and translations. Julia Ryan of ''[[The Atlantic]]'' wrote that because students certified by the [[New England College Entrance Certificate Board]], ones who attended private preparatory schools in New England, were exempt from the examinations, "perhaps only a few students were even taking [the entrance examinations]."&lt;ref name=RyanJuliaHowGetting&gt;{{cite web|author=Ryan, Julia|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2013/11/how-getting-into-college-became-such-a-long-frenzied-competitive-process/281336/|title=How Getting Into College Became Such a Long, Frenzied, Competitive Process|publisher=''[[The Atlantic]]''|date=November 11, 2013|accessdate=August 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1925 Tufts set an admission quota of 650 males; the examinations were of a similar length of the 1905 ones but the entry requirements decreased in size to a level comparable of that of the 1856 ones. Standardized testing, admissions interviews, and other features of current university admissions processes were in place by 1946.&lt;ref name=RyanJuliaHowGetting/&gt;
[[File:Carmichael Hall, Tufts.jpg|300px|left|thumb|Carmichael Hall on the Residence Quad]]

====Graduate admissions====
The graduate schools each hold their own admission process. Students apply directly to the graduate program to which they are seeking acceptance, and so acceptance rates vary dramatically between programs.

Tufts has semester and year long programs with [[Pembroke College, Oxford|Pembroke College]] of the [[University of Oxford]], [[University College London]], [[Royal Holloway University of London]], [[School of Oriental and African Studies]], [[University of Paris]], [[Sciences Po Paris]], [[École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts]], [[University of Tübingen]], [[Zhejiang University]], and [[University of Hong Kong]].&lt;ref name="Tufts Programs"/&gt; Every year more than 500 undergraduate students study abroad, with most doing it during their junior and senior years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://students.tufts.edu/study-abroad/non-tufts-programs | title=Non-Tufts programs| publisher=''Tufts University'' |year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Libraries and museums===

[[File:Biblioteca Ginn.jpg|thumb|150px|Ginn Library at the Fletcher School]]

Completed in 1908, Tufts' first library building, Eaton Memorial Library (now Eaton Hall), was made possible with a donation from [[Andrew Carnegie]]. Carnegie's wife requested that the building be named after a Tufts graduate, Reverend Charles Eaton, who had presided over her wedding. The building received an extension in 1950 with the construction of the War Memorial Library in honor of the Tufts alumni who served in [[World War II]]. By 1965 the collection outgrew the building and was moved to a new library named Wessell Library. Additionally the demand for more square footage prompted the expansion of Wessell. In 1995, with the addition of 80,000 more square feet, the library was renamed [[Tisch Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emerald.tufts.edu/alumni/pdfs/then&amp;now.pdf | title=Tufts Then &amp; Now | publisher=''Tufts University"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the [[Tufts University Libraries|Tufts University Library System]] contains over three million volumes. The main library, Tisch Library, holds about 2.7 million volumes, with other holdings dispersed at subject libraries including the Hirsh Health Sciences Library on the Boston campus, the Edwin Ginn Library at the Fletcher School, and Webster Family Library at the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine on the Grafton campus.&lt;ref name="Tufts University Fact Book 2015/2016"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://provost.tufts.edu/institutionalresearch/files/Fact-Book-2015-16_Final.pdf | publisher = Tufts University | title = Tufts University Fact Book | work = Tufts University Fact Book 2015/2016 | date = &lt;!-- (undated) --&gt; | accessdate = August 24, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Students have access to the academic libraries of institutions in the Boston Consortium.

In addition to the [[Barnum Museum of Natural History]], Tufts had established a permanent art collection which includes a wide range of art from antiquity to the present. The Collection comprises 2,000 works from ancient Mediterranean and pre-Hispanic cultures to modern and contemporary painting, sculpture, and photography. Notable highlights in the permanent collection include works by [[John Singer Sargent]], [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Isamu Noguchi]], [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Andy Warhol]], [[Milton Resnick]], [[Salvador Dali]], and [[Pablo Picasso]] among others.

===Student body===
According to the Princeton Review the undergraduate student body is ethnically and socioeconomically diverse.&lt;ref name="Princetonreview.com"/&gt; ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'' ranks Tufts as one of the top 20 gay-friendly campuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://enews.tufts.edu/stories/233/2006/08/28/TuftsHailedAsGayFriendlyCampus|title=Tufts E-News: Tufts Hailed As Gay-Friendly Campus|publisher=|accessdate=August 3, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724084740/http://enews.tufts.edu/stories/233/2006/08/28/TuftsHailedAsGayFriendlyCampus/#|archive-date=July 24, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of those accepted for admission to the undergraduate Class of 2019, 27 percent are Asian, Hispanic, African-American, or two or more races.

====Student government====

There are three forms of student government at Tufts University: the Tufts Community Union (TCU) Senate, the TCU Judiciary and the CSL (Committee on Student Life). The Senate is chaired by the student body president and led by a six-person executive board consisting of Vice President, Treasurer, Historian, Parliamentarian, and Diversity and Community Affairs Officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tcu.tufts.edu/|title=Tufts Community Union|accessdate=January 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Publications and broadcasting====
The ''[[Tufts Daily]]'' is the daily student newspaper, and the ''[[Tufts Observer]]'', established in 1895, is the school's biweekly magazine and the oldest publication on campus. [[The Zamboni (magazine)|The Zamboni]] is Tufts' monthly humor and satire magazine. ''[[The Princeton Review]]'' has named Tufts' college newspaper as one of the best in the country, currently ranking it No. 10.&lt;ref name="Princetonreview.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings?rankings=best-college-newspaper|title=Best College Newspaper – The Princeton Review|accessdate=March 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tufts has a television station (TUTV) which has produced and broadcast films, news, soap operas, and comedy sketch pieces. TUTV has also gone to release web series such as "Jules and Monty". The station went operational in April 1977, from Curtis Hall and consists of 40 student volunteers. Curtis Hall is also home to Tufts' own radio station [[WMFO]], which streams locally on 91.5 FM. The station first aired in 1970 and is funded by the university.

====Activism====
[[File:Fossil Fuel Divestment Student Protest at Tufts University.jpg|200px|thumb|Student protest for fossil fuel divestment]]

In 1969, Tufts was the center for Civil Rights activism due to the controversy surrounding the construction of Lewis Hall. Students staged a work strike to protest racist hiring policies practiced by the construction company Tufts had commissioned to build the residence hall. In addition to writing letters, students sat in Ballou and East Halls, and collaborated with black workers. These demonstrations eventually attracted support from major metropolitan areas in the Northeast. In 1970, Tufts adopted new hiring policies which were subsequently adopted by other universities. It led to the creation of training programs for minority employees on campus, in addition to the foundation of the Africana Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.tufts.edu/protest1969/|title=Tufts Civil Right Protests|accessdate=June 7, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609213428/http://sites.tufts.edu/protest1969/|archive-date=June 9, 2016|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Greek life====
There are 13 total Greek life organizations at Tufts. About 25% of the student body is involved in Greek life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uss.tufts.edu/studentAffairs/resources/ofsl.asp|title=Tufts University: Student Affairs|publisher=|accessdate=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The six national fraternities with chapters at Tufts are [[Delta Tau Delta]], [[Delta Upsilon]], [[Theta Chi]], [[Theta Delta Chi]], [[Zeta Beta Tau]], and [[Zeta Psi]]. In addition, there are four sororities: [[Alpha Omicron Pi]], [[Alpha Phi]], [[Chi Omega]], and [[Kappa Alpha Theta]]. There is also one co-ed fraternity, ATO of Massachusetts, and a local fraternity, Pi Rho Omega.

===Athletics===
{{Main|Tufts Jumbos}}

Tufts competes in the [[New England Small College Athletic Conference]]—the NESCAC—in [[NCAA Division III]]. Their [[mascot]] is [[Jumbo]], which is one of two college mascots to appear in [[Webster's Dictionary]] with the other being the Billiken of St. Louis University. The mascot comes from [[P. T. Barnum]]'s circus, as Barnum was one of the original trustees of Tufts College. According to legend, Jumbo the Elephant heroically jumped in front of a train, sacrificing himself to save a younger elephant from dying. Jumbo's stuffed skin was donated to the school, and was displayed until a 1975 fire destroyed the body, except for the tail, which had been removed for conservation work. Now, a statue of the elephant is a prominent landmark on the quad, near Barnum Hall, the Biology building.

Recently, Tufts has become one of the top athletic schools in Division III. The school has consistently ranked in the top ten of the Learfield Director's Cup, which ranks the top Division I, II, and III athletic programs in the country by awarding points in a pre-determined number of sports for men and women. In 2015-16, Tufts ranked 4th in the country, and in 2014-15 Tufts ranked 9th. Tufts men's lacrosse team won the school's first ever NCAA team championship in 2010, beating [[Salisbury State University]] in the championship game. They lost in 2011 to Salisbury in the championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Salisbury routs Tufts for title |url=http://articles.boston.com/2011-05-30/sports/29600194_1_salisbury-coach-jim-berkman-matt-cannone-tufts |author=Alex Prewitt |publisher=Boston Globe |date=May 30, 2011 |accessdate=December 14, 2011 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the women's field hockey team won their first national championship, beating [[Montclair State University]] 2–1 in the finals.

Performed at most football games, "Tuftonia's Day", the Tufts fight song, was written in 1912 by Elliot W. Hayes. It can also be heard at Tufts' numerous a capella concerts and at homecoming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://admissions.tufts.edu/about-tufts/tufts-traditions/|title=Tufts Traditions |accessdate=June 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:West Hall - Tufts University - IMG 0973.JPG|thumb|West Hall, an uphill residence hall]]
Seven out of ten undergraduates live on campus. Students can choose from 40 residences from small special interest houses, to traditional dorms, to shared apartments. There are 25 residence halls. Similar to residential colleges, students would frequently organize discussions and bring in guest speakers and plan several activities together. Upperclassmen have the option of living in special interest housing which are 15 houses reflecting a specific cultural or academic interest. Each house offers organizes several activities and events not limited to residents. Shared apartments are usually the most popular in the university with apartments like Sophia Gordon Hall (SoGo) a primary gathering place for juniors and seniors. The high density residential neighborhood around the university provides additional housing for students who opt to live off campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://admissions.tufts.edu/life-at-tufts/housing-and-res-life/|title=Housing Tufts University|accessdate=June 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university has two main dining centers, Dewick-MacPhie serving downhill students, and Carmichael serving uphill students. Each dining hall has a different menu and atmosphere. Both offer a European-style servery with multiple stations.{{clarify|reason=What does 'European-style servery with multiple stations' mean?|date=June 2017}} ''[[The Princeton Review]]'' has listed Tufts in its "Best Campus Food" category since 2005, ranking it as high as second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfood.com/2006/08/26/princetonreview-bowdoin-campus-food/|title=Recipes and Cooking Inspiration – Kitchen Daily|work=Kitchen Daily|accessdate=August 3, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014190449/http://www.slashfood.com/2006/08/26/princetonreview-bowdoin-campus-food/|archive-date=October 14, 2013|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collegeprowler.com/tufts-university/campus-dining/|title=Tufts University – Campus Food|date=May 21, 2015|work=Niche.com|accessdate=August 3, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018043009/http://collegeprowler.com/tufts-university/campus-dining/|archive-date=October 18, 2013|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://njartscouncil.com/top-schools-in-the-northeast-see-the-rankings/67/ Top Schools in the Northeast – See the Rankings : NJ Arts Council&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714184907/http://njartscouncil.com/top-schools-in-the-northeast-see-the-rankings/67/ |date=July 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The menus for these dining halls can be found at [https://tuftsrecipes.com Tufts Recipes].

==Traditions==

[[File:Tufts cannon support Japan.jpg|thumb|[[The Cannon (Tufts University)|The Tufts cannon]], repainted almost nightly during the academic year, is here painted in response to the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|earthquake and tsunami in Japan]]]]

===A Cappella===
Tufts also has a thriving a cappella scene, including the [[Beelzebubs]], known for their performances on [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Sing-Off]]'' and ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'', where the group arranged several of the songs performed by the fictional a cappella group, [[The Warblers]]. Other notable groups include the [[Amalgamates]], known also for their performances all over the United States, and the [[Jackson Jills]], Tufts' oldest female group.

===Naked Quad Run===
Every winter just prior to final exams, students would run naked laps on the Academic Quad as a way to relieve the stress of finals, much akin to similar traditions such as the [[Primal Scream (Harvard)|Primal Scream]] at Harvard. Due to increasing scrutiny from the administration and injuries incurred by slipping on the icy roads, the tradition was banned in 2011 by then-President [[Lawrence S. Bacow|Lawrence Bacow]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tuftsdaily.com/opinion/2011/03/14/nqr-reconsidered/|title=NQR reconsidered - The Tufts Daily|date=March 14, 2011|work=The Tufts Daily|access-date=February 10, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; much to students' dismay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tuftsdaily.com/arts/2014/09/25/tufts-no-longer-a-quirky-paradise/|title=Tufts no longer a quirky paradise? - The Tufts Daily|date=September 25, 2014|work=The Tufts Daily|access-date=February 10, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tuftsdaily.com/news/2011/03/14/bacow-ends-naked-quad-run/|title=Bacow ends Naked Quad Run - The Tufts Daily|date=March 14, 2011|work=The Tufts Daily|access-date=February 10, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tuftsobserver.org/the-end-of-an-era/|title=The End of an Era|date=December 4, 2011|work=Tufts Observer|access-date=February 10, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; A protest run took place the following year, with some students donning nude colored leotards and others taking the opposite tack calling their event the "Excessively Overdressed Quad Stroll".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://patch.com/massachusetts/somerville/tufts-naked-quad-run-becomes-excessively-overdressed-7cd675062b|title=Tufts Naked Quad Run Becomes 'Excessively Overdressed Quad Stroll'|date=December 13, 2011|work=Somerville, MA Patch|access-date=February 10, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 2016, the tradition was revitalized for spring finals week and briefly became an annual tradition once more.

The [[history of painting]] reaches back in time to artifacts from pre-historic artists, and spans all cultures. The oldest known paintings are at the [[Grotte Chauvet]] in France, claimed by some historians to be about 32,000 years old. They are engraved and painted using [[red ochre]] and black pigment and show horses, rhinoceros, lions, buffalo, mammoth, or humans often hunting. There are examples of [[cave painting]]s all over the world—in France, India, Spain, Portugal, China, Australia etc. There are many common themes throughout the different places that the paintings have been found; implying the universality of purpose and similarity of the impulses that might have inspired the artists to create the imagery. Various conjectures have been made as to the meaning these paintings had to the artists who made them. Prehistoric men may have painted animals to "catch" their [[soul]] or [[spirit]] in order to hunt them more easily, or the paintings may represent an [[animism|animistic]] vision and homage to surrounding [[nature]], or they may be the result of a basic need of [[Emotional expression|expression]] that is [[essence|innate]] to human beings, or they may be recordings of the life experiences of the artists and related stories from the members of their circle.

[[Ancient Egypt]], a civilization with strong traditions of architecture and sculpture (both originally painted in bright colors), had many mural paintings in temples and buildings, and painted illustrations on [[papyrus]] [[manuscript]]s.  Egyptian wall painting and decorative painting is often graphic, sometimes more symbolic than realistic. Egyptian painting depicts figures in bold outline and flat [[silhouette]], in which symmetry is a constant characteristic. [[Art of ancient Egypt|Egyptian painting]] has close connection with its written language—called [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]].  Painted symbols are found amongst the first forms of written language. The Egyptians also painted on [[linen]], remnants of which survive today.
Ancient Egyptian paintings survived due to the extremely dry climate. The ancient Egyptians created paintings to make the [[afterlife]] of the deceased a pleasant place. The themes included journey through the afterworld or their protective deities introducing the dead to the gods of the underworld. Some examples of such paintings are paintings of the gods and goddesses [[Ra]], [[Horus]], [[Anubis]], [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]], [[Osiris]] and [[Isis]]. Some tomb paintings show activities that the deceased were involved in when they were alive and wished to carry on doing for eternity. In the [[New Kingdom]] and later, the [[Book of the Dead]] was buried with the entombed person. It was considered important for an introduction to the afterlife.

To the north of [[Egypt]] was the [[Minoan civilization]] on the island of [[Crete]]. The wall paintings found in the palace of [[Knossos]] are similar to those of the [[Egyptians]] but much more free in style.

Around 1100 BC, tribes from the north of Greece conquered Greece and its art took a new direction. The culture of [[ancient Greece]] is noteworthy for its outstanding contributions to the visual arts. Painting on [[pottery of ancient Greece]] and [[ceramic]]s gives a particularly informative glimpse into the way society in ancient Greece functioned. Many fine examples of [[black-figure vase painting]] and [[red-figure vase painting]] still exist. Some famous Greek painters who worked on wood panels and are mentioned in texts are [[Apelles]], [[Zeuxis]] and [[Parrhasius (painter)|Parrhasius]]; however, with the single exception of the [[Pitsa panels]], no examples of ancient Greek panel painting survive, only written descriptions by their contemporaries or later Romans.  Zeuxis lived in the 5th century BC and was said to be the first to use [[sfumato]]. According to [[Pliny the Elder]], the realism of his paintings was such that birds tried to eat the painted grapes.  Apelles is described as the greatest painter of [[classical antiquity|antiquity]], and is noted for perfect technique in drawing, brilliant color, and modeling.

[[Roman art]] was influenced by Greece and can in part be taken as a descendant of ancient Greek painting. However, Roman painting does have important unique characteristics. Surviving Roman paintings include wall paintings and [[fresco]]es, many from villas in [[Campania]], in Southern Italy at sites such as [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]]. Such painting can be grouped into 4 main "styles" or periods&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.art-and-archaeology.com/roman/painting.html |title=Roman Painting |publisher=art-and-archaeology.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may contain the first examples of [[trompe-l'œil]], pseudo-perspective, and pure landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accd.edu/sac/vat/arthistory/arts1303/Rome4.htm |title=Roman Wall Painting |publisher=accd.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319123717/http://www.accd.edu/sac/vat/arthistory/arts1303/Rome4.htm |archivedate=19 March 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost the only painted portraits surviving from the ancient world are a large number of [[Fayum mummy portraits|coffin-portraits]] of bust form found in the [[Late Antique]] cemetery of [[Al-Fayum]]. Although these were neither of the best period nor the highest quality, they are impressive in themselves, and give an idea of the quality that the finest ancient work must have had. A very small number of [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] from Late Antique illustrated books also survive, and a rather larger number of copies of them from the Early Medieval period.

The rise of Christianity imparted a different spirit and aim to painting styles. [[Byzantine art]], once its style was established by the 6th century, placed great emphasis on retaining traditional [[iconography]] and style, and gradually evolved during the thousand years of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the living traditions of Greek and Russian [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] [[icon]]-painting.  Byzantine painting has a hieratic feeling and icons were and still are seen as a representation of divine revelation.  There were many [[fresco]]s, but fewer of these have survived than [[mosaic]]s.
Byzantine art has been compared to contemporary [[abstraction]], in its flatness and highly stylised depictions of figures and landscape.  Some periods of Byzantine art, especially the so-called [[Macedonian art (Byzantine)|Macedonian art]] of around the 10th century, are more flexible in approach. Frescos of the Palaeologian Renaissance of the early 14th century survive in the [[Chora Church]] in Istanbul.
[[File:Giotto di Bondone - No. 18 Scenes from the Life of Christ - 2. Adoration of the Magi - WGA09195.jpg|thumb|[[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]]]]

In post-Antique Catholic Europe the first distinctive artistic style to emerge that included painting was the [[Insular art]] of the British Isles, where the only surviving examples are miniatures in [[Illuminated manuscript]]s such as the [[Book of Kells]].&lt;ref&gt;Putnam A.M., Geo. Haven. Books and Their Makers During The Middle Ages. Vol. 1. New York: Hillary House, 1962. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  These are most famous for their abstract decoration, although figures, and sometimes scenes, were also depicted, especially in [[Evangelist portrait]]s. [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] and [[Ottonian art]] also survives mostly in manuscripts, although some wall-painting remain, and more are documented.  The art of this period combines Insular and "barbarian" influences with a strong Byzantine influence and an aspiration to recover classical monumentality and poise.

Walls of [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic art|Gothic]] churches were decorated with [[fresco]]es as well as sculpture and many of the few remaining [[mural]]s have great intensity, and combine the decorative energy of Insular art with a new monumentality in the treatment of figures. Far more miniatures in [[Illuminated manuscript]]s survive from the period, showing the same characteristics, which continue into the [[Gothic art|Gothic period]].

Panel painting becomes more common during the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] period, under the heavy influence of Byzantine icons.  Towards the middle of the 13th century, [[Medieval art]] and [[Gothic painting]] became more realistic, with the beginnings of interest in the depiction of volume and perspective in Italy with [[Cimabue]] and then his pupil [[Giotto]].  From Giotto on, the treatment of composition by the best painters also became much more free and innovative.  They are considered to be the two great medieval masters of painting in western culture. Cimabue, within the Byzantine tradition, used a more realistic and dramatic approach to his art. His pupil, Giotto, took these innovations to a higher level which in turn set the foundations for the western painting tradition. Both artists were pioneers in the move towards naturalism.

Churches were built with more and more windows and the use of colorful [[stained glass]] become a staple in decoration. One of the most famous examples of this is found in the cathedral of [[Notre Dame de Paris]]. By the 14th century Western societies were both richer and more cultivated and painters found new patrons in the nobility and even the [[bourgeoisie]]. Illuminated manuscripts took on a new character and slim, fashionably dressed court women were shown in their landscapes. This style soon became known as [[International Gothic]] style and was dominant from 1375–1425 with and [[tempera]] panel paintings and altarpieces gaining importance.

The Renaissance (French for 'rebirth'), a cultural movement roughly spanning the 14th through the mid-17th century, was driven by [[Renaissance humanism]] and the study of classical sources. In painting, in the 1420s and 1430s leading painters in Italy and the [[Low Countries]] separately developed new ways of painting which allowed the paintings to appear more realistic than in the works of established painters, whose style is referred to as [[International Gothic]], or in some cases as Proto-Renaissance (mainly in Italy).  This period, lasting until about 1495, became known as the [[Early Renaissance]].  

In the Flanders area of the Low Countries, following developments made in the [[illuminated manuscript|illumination of manuscripts]], especially by the [[Limbourg Brothers]], who died in 1416, artists became fascinated by the tangible in the visible world and began representing objects in an extremely naturalistic way.&lt;ref name="Gardner et al"&gt;Gardner, H., Kleiner, F. S., &amp; Mamiya, C. J. (2006). Gardner's art through the ages: the Western perspective. Belmont, CA, Thomson Wadsworth: 430–437&lt;/ref&gt; The adoption of [[oil painting]] whose first use on [[panel painting]]s was traditionally, but erroneously, credited to [[Jan van Eyck]], made possible a new [[verisimilitude]] in depicting this naturalism. The medium of oil paint was already present in the work of [[Melchior Broederlam]] (who died in 1409), but [[Robert Campin]] (previously known as [[the Master of Flémalle]]) and van Eyck brought its use to new heights and employed it to represent the naturalism for which they were aiming. With this new medium, the painters of this period were capable of creating richer colors with a deep intense tonality. The illusion of glowing light with a porcelain-like finish characterized [[Early Netherlandish painting]] and was a major difference to the matte surface of [[tempera]] paint used in Italy.&lt;ref name="Gardner et al" /&gt; 
[[File:La Anunciación, de Fra Angelico.jpg|thumb|[[Fra Angelico]], 1425–1428]]

Unlike the Italians, whose work drew heavily from the art of ancient Rome, the northerners retained a stylistic residue of the sculpture and [[illuminated manuscripts]] of the Middle Ages (especially its naturalism).  Another important Netherlandish painter of this period was [[Rogier van der Weyden]], a pupil of Campin, whose compositions stressed human emotion and drama, demonstrated for instance in his [[The Descent from the Cross (van der Weyden)|Descent from the Cross]], which ranks among the most famous works of the 15th century and was the most influential Netherlandish painting of Christ's crucifixion. Other important artists were [[Hugo van der Goes]] (whose work was highly influential in Italy), [[Dieric Bouts]] (who was among the first northern painters to demonstrate the use of a single vanishing point),&lt;ref name="Gardner et al" /&gt; [[Petrus Christus]], [[Hans Memling]] and [[Gerard David]].  Collectively, the advances in painting in Europe north of the Alps is known as the [[Northern Renaissance]].    

In [[Italian Renaissance painting]], the art of [[Classical antiquity]] inspired a style of painting that emphasized the ideal. [[Masaccio]] is credited with making advances in linear perspective, the depiction of volume in his figures, and in portraying emotions on the faces of his figures in the 1420s.  Then, artists such as [[Paolo Uccello]], [[Fra Angelico]], [[Piero della Francesca]], [[Andrea Mantegna]], [[Filippo Lippi]], and [[Sandro Botticelli]], in the [[Early Renaissance]] period lasting to about 1495, and then [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo Buonarroti]], and [[Raphael]] during the [[High Renaissance]] from about 1495 to 1520, took painting to a higher level through the use of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], the study of [[human anatomy]] and proportion, and through their development of an unprecedented refinement in drawing and painting techniques. A somewhat more naturalistic High Renaissance style emerged in [[Venice]]. Painters of the [[Venetian school (art)|Venetian school]], such as [[Giovanni Bellini]], [[Giorgione]], [[Titian]], and [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]], were less concerned with precision in their drawing than with the richness of color and unity of effect that could be achieved by a more spontaneous approach to painting.  

Flemish, Dutch and German painters of the [[Northern Renaissance|Northern High Renaissance]] such as [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Lucas Cranach]], [[Matthias Grünewald]], and [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] had a different approach than their Italian counterparts, one that is more realistic and less idealized. Some northern painters, beginning with Dürer in the 1490s, traveled to Italy to see works of the Italian High Renaissance and they incorporated the features of the Italian art into their own to varying degrees.A generation later, the start of [[genre painting]] as a subject for large works began with [[Peter Aertsen]] and [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]]. A later generation of Northern Renaissance painters who traveled to Rome and adopted much of the idealized approach of the Italian Renaissance became known as [[Romanists]].
[[File:Titian Bacchus and Ariadne.jpg|thumb|[[Titian]], 1520–1523]]

Renaissance painting reflects the revolution of ideas and science ([[astronomy]], [[geography]]) that occurred in this period, the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], and the invention of the [[printing press]].  [[Printmaking]] became increasingly important, and practiced by many painters. Dürer, considered one of the greatest of printmakers, states that painters are not mere [[artisan]]s but [[Intellectual|thinkers]] as well. With the development of [[easel painting]] in the Renaissance, painting gained independence from architecture. Easel paintings—movable pictures which could be hung easily on walls—became a popular alternative to paintings fixed to furniture, walls or other structures. Following centuries dominated by religious imagery, secular subject matter slowly returned to Western painting. Artists included visions of the world around them, or the products of their own imaginations in their paintings. Those who could afford the expense could become patrons and commission portraits of themselves or their family.

The [[High Renaissance]] in Italy gave rise to a stylized art known as [[Mannerism]] after 1520, although some painters, such as Titian and [[Paolo Veronese]], continued painting in a High Renaissance style late into the century. In place of the balanced compositions and rational approach to perspective that characterized art at the dawn of the 16th century, the Mannerists sought instability, artifice, and doubt. The calm Virgins of Raphael and serene expressions of Leonardo's subjects are replaced by the troubled expressions of [[Pontormo]] and the emotional intensity of [[El Greco]]. Restless and unstable compositions, often extreme or disjunctive effects of perspective, and stylized poses are characteristic of Italian Mannerists such as [[Tintoretto]], Pontormo, and [[Bronzino]], and appeared later in the work of [[Northern Mannerism|Northern Mannerists]] such as [[Hendrick Goltzius]], [[Bartholomeus Spranger]], and [[Joachim Wtewael]].

Baroque painting is associated with the [[Baroque]] [[cultural movement]], a movement often identified with [[political absolutism|Absolutism]] and the [[Counter Reformation]] or Catholic Revival;&lt;ref name=ebo&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9026564/Counter-Reformation Counter Reformation], from ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]'', latest edition, full-article.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/65/co/CounterR.html Counter Reformation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211173809/http://www.bartleby.com/65/co/CounterR.html |date=11 December 2008 }}, from ''[[The Columbia Encyclopedia]]'', Sixth Edition.  2001–05.&lt;/ref&gt; the existence of important Baroque painting in non-absolutist and Protestant states also, however, underscores its popularity, as the style spread throughout Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Gardner, Fred S. Kleiner, and Christin J. Mamiya, "Gardner's Art Through the Ages" (Belmont, CA: Thomson/Wadsworth, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Baroque painting is characterized by great drama, rich, deep color, and intense light and dark shadows with the purpose of the art being to evoke emotion and passion instead of the calm rationality that had been prized during the Renaissance. The earliest Baroque painters included the Caracci brothers, [[Annibale Caracci|Annibale]] and [[Agostino Caracci|Agostino]], in the last score of the 16th century, and [[Caravaggio]] in the last decade of the century. Caravaggio is recognized as one of the greatest Baroque painters and an heir of the [[Humanism|humanist]] painting of the [[High Renaissance]]. His [[realism (visual arts)|realistic]] approach to the human figure, painted directly from life and dramatically spotlit against a dark background, shocked his contemporaries and opened a new chapter in the history of painting.  Baroque was the dominant style of painting beginning around 1600 and continuing throughout the 17th century. Among the greatest painters of the Baroque are [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Frans Hals]], [[Johannes Vermeer]], [[Le Nain]], [[Jusepe de Ribera]], [[Nicolas Poussin|Poussin]], [[Georges de la Tour|Tour]],  and [[Claude Lorraine]], who focused on landscape painting.  Poussin, Claude and La Tour, all French, adopted a "classical" Baroque style with less focus on emotion and greater attention to the outine of the figures in the painting than on colour.  Most of these painters traveled to Italy as part of their training and would then take the Baroque style back to their homelands, although in some cases they remained in Italy for large portions of their career (Claude and Poussin).  In Italy, the Baroque style is epitomized by religious and mythological paintings in the [[Grand Manner]] by artists such as [[the Carracci]], [[Guido Reni]], and [[Luca Giordano]]. Illusionistic church ceiling frescoes by [[Pietro da Cortona]] seemed to open to the sky.

[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn - Portret van een paar als oudtestamentische figuren, genaamd 'Het Joodse bruidje' - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Rembrandt|Rembrandt van Rijn]], ''The Jewish Bride'', ca.&amp;nbsp;1665–1669]]
A much quieter type of Baroque emerged in the [[Dutch Republic]], where easel paintings of everyday subjects were popular with middle-class collectors, and many painters became specialists in [[genre painting|genre]], others in landscape or seascape or still life. Vermeer, [[Gerard ter Borch]], and [[Pieter de Hooch]] brought great technical refinement to the painting of domestic scenes, as did [[Willem Claesz. Heda]] to still life. In contrast, Rembrandt excelled in painting every type of subject, and developed an individual [[painterliness|painterly]] style in which the chiaroscuro and dark backgrounds derived from Caravaggio and the [[Utrecht Caravaggists]] lose their theatrical quality.  Dutch Baroque painting is often referred to as [[Dutch Golden Age Painting]].

During the 18th century, [[Rococo]] painting followed as a lighter extension of Baroque, often frivolous and erotic and using light pastel colours. Rococo developed first in the decorative arts and interior design in France. [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]]'s succession brought a change in the court artists and general artistic fashion.  The 1730s represented the height of Rococo development in France exemplified by the works of [[Antoine Watteau]] and [[François Boucher]].  Rococo still maintained the Baroque taste for complex forms and intricate patterns, but by this point, it had begun to integrate a variety of diverse characteristics, including a taste for Oriental designs and asymmetric compositions.

The Rococo style spread with French artists and engraved publications.  It was readily received in the Catholic parts of Germany, [[Bohemia]], and [[Austria]], where it was merged with the lively German Baroque traditions.  German Rococo was applied with enthusiasm to churches and palaces, particularly in the south, while [[Frederician Rococo]] developed in the [[Kingdom of Prussia]].

The French masters [[Jean-Antoine Watteau|Watteau]], [[François Boucher|Boucher]] and [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard|Fragonard]] represent the style, as do [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] and [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin]] who was considered by some as the best French painter of the 18th century – the ''Anti-Rococo''. [[Portrait]]ure was an important component of painting in all countries, but especially in England, where the leaders were [[William Hogarth]], in a blunt realist style, and [[Francis Hayman]], [[Angelica Kauffman]] (who was Swiss), [[Thomas Gainsborough]] and [[Joshua Reynolds]] in more flattering styles influenced by [[Anthony van Dyck]]. In France during the Rococo era [[Jean-Baptiste Greuze]] (the favorite painter of [[Denis Diderot]]),&lt;ref&gt;[[Edmond de Goncourt|Edmond]] and [[Jules de Goncourt]], ''French Eighteenth-Century Painters.'' Cornell Paperbacks, 1981, pp. 222–225. {{ISBN|0-8014-9218-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; excelled in portraits and [[history painting]]s, and [[Maurice Quentin de La Tour]] and [[Élisabeth Vigée-Lebrun]] were highly accomplished [[Portrait painting|portrait painters]]. La Tour specialized in [[pastel]] painting, which became a popular medium during this period.

[[William Hogarth]] helped develop a theoretical foundation for Rococo beauty. Though not intentionally referencing the movement, he argued in his ''Analysis of Beauty'' (1753) that the undulating lines and S-curves prominent in Rococo were the basis for grace and beauty in art or nature (unlike the straight line or the circle in [[Classicism]]). The beginning of the end for Rococo came in the early 1760s as figures like [[Voltaire]] and [[Jacques-François Blondel]] began to voice their criticism of the superficiality and degeneracy of the art.  Blondel decried the "ridiculous jumble of shells, dragons, reeds, palm-trees and plants" in contemporary interiors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/sammlung6/allg/buch.xml?docname=blondel1737 Uni-Heidelberg.de]{{dead link|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1785, Rococo had passed out of fashion in France, replaced by the order and seriousness of [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] artists such as [[Jacques-Louis David]], whose imposing history paintings depicting both historical and contemporary events embodied the ideals of the [[French Revolution]].

After [[Rococo]] there arose in the late 18th century, in architecture, and then in painting severe [[neo-classicism]], best represented by such artists as [[Jacques-Louis David|David]] and his heir [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]]. Ingres' work already contains much of the sensuality, but none of the spontaneity, that was to characterize [[Romanticism]].

By the mid-19th century, painters became liberated from the demands of their patronage to only depict scenes from religion, mythology, portraiture or history. Art became more purely a means of personal expression in the work of painters like [[Francisco de Goya]], [[John Constable]], and [[J. M. W. Turner]]. Romantic painters turned [[landscape painting]] into a major genre, considered until then as a minor genre or as a decorative background for figure compositions.
Some of the major painters of this period are [[Eugène Delacroix]], [[Théodore Géricault]], J. M. W. Turner, [[Caspar David Friedrich]] and John Constable. Francisco Goya's late work demonstrates the Romantic interest in the irrational, the work of [[Arnold Böcklin]] evokes mystery, the work of the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] in England combines assiduous devotion to nature with nostalgia for medieval culture, and the paintings of [[Aesthetic movement]] artist [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]] evoke sophistication, [[decadent movement|decadence]], and the philosophy of "art for art's sake". In the United States the Romantic tradition of landscape painting was known as the [[Hudson River School]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0268/is_5_40/ai_82469521 |title=Novack, Barbara '&amp;#39;American Sublime'&amp;#39; Artforum, 2002, retrieved 30 October 2008 |publisher=Findarticles.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; exponents include [[Thomas Cole]], [[Frederic Edwin Church]], [[Albert Bierstadt]], [[Thomas Moran]], and [[John Frederick Kensett]]. [[Luminism (American art style)|Luminism]] was a movement in American landscape painting related to the Hudson River School.
[[File:Johan Barthold Jongkind - Overschie bij maneschijn.jpg|thumb|left|220px|[[Johan Jongkind]], 1871, a prefiguration of impressionism]]
A major force in the turn towards [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] at mid-century was [[Gustave Courbet]], whose unidealized paintings of common people offended viewers accustomed to the conventional subject matter and [[licked finish]] of [[academic art]], but inspired many younger artists. The leading [[Barbizon School]] painter [[Jean-François Millet]] also painted landscapes and scenes of peasant life. Loosely associated with the Barbizon School was [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot|Camille Corot]], who painted in both a romantic and a [[Realism (visual arts)|realistic]] vein; his work prefigures [[Impressionism]], as did the paintings of [[Johan Jongkind]] and [[Eugène Boudin]] (who was one of the first French landscape painters to paint outdoors). Boudin was an important influence on the young [[Claude Monet]], whom in 1857 he introduced to [[plein air]] painting.

In the latter third of the century Impressionists such as [[Édouard Manet]], Claude Monet, [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Camille Pissarro]], [[Alfred Sisley]], [[Berthe Morisot]], [[Mary Cassatt]], and [[Edgar Degas]] worked in a more direct approach than had previously been exhibited publicly. They eschewed allegory and narrative in favor of individualized responses to the modern world, sometimes painted with little or no preparatory study, relying on deftness of drawing and a highly chromatic palette. Monet, Pissarro, and Sisley used the landscape as their primary motif, the transience of light and weather playing a major role in their work. Following a practice that had become increasingly popular by mid-century, they often ventured into the countryside together to paint in the open air, but not for the traditional purpose of making sketches to be developed into carefully finished works in the studio.&lt;ref&gt;Bomford, David, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, Ashok Roy, and Raymond White (1990). ''Impressionism''. London: National Gallery. pp. 21–27. {{ISBN|0-300-05035-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By painting in sunlight directly from nature, and making bold use of the vivid synthetic pigments that had become available since the beginning of the century, they developed a lighter and brighter manner of painting.
[[File:The Scream.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Edvard Munch]], 1893, early example of [[Expressionism]]]]
Manet, Degas, Renoir, Morisot, and Cassatt concentrated primarily on the human subject. Both Manet and Degas reinterpreted classical figurative canons within contemporary situations; in Manet's case the re-imaginings met with hostile public reception. Renoir, Morisot, and Cassatt turned to domestic life for inspiration, with Renoir focusing on the female nude. While Sisley most closely adhered to the original principals of the Impressionist perception of the landscape, Monet sought challenges in increasingly chromatic and changeable conditions, culminating in his series of monumental works of [[Water Lilies]] painted in [[Giverny]].

[[Post-Impressionist]]s such as [[Paul Cézanne]] and the slightly younger [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Paul Gauguin]], and [[Georges-Pierre Seurat]] led art to the edge of [[modernism]]. For Gauguin Impressionism gave way to a personal symbolism. Seurat transformed Impressionism's broken color into a scientific optical study, structured on frieze-like compositions. The painting technique he developed, called [[Divisionism]], attracted many followers such as [[Paul Signac]], and for a few years in the late 1880s Pissarro adopted some of his methods. Van Gogh's turbulent method of paint application, coupled with a sonorous use of color, predicted [[Expressionism]] and [[Fauvism]], and Cézanne, desiring to unite classical composition with a revolutionary abstraction of natural forms, would come to be seen as a precursor of 20th-century art.

The spell of Impressionism was felt throughout the world, including in the United States, where it became integral to the painting of [[American Impressionists]] such as [[Childe Hassam]], [[John Henry Twachtman]], and [[Theodore Robinson]]. It also exerted influence on painters who were not primarily Impressionistic in theory, like the portrait and landscape painter [[John Singer Sargent]]. At the same time in America at the turn of the 20th century there existed a native and nearly insular realism, as richly embodied in the figurative work of [[Thomas Eakins]], the [[Ashcan School]], and the landscapes and seascapes of [[Winslow Homer]], all of whose paintings were deeply invested in the solidity of natural forms.  The visionary landscape, a motive largely dependent on the ambiguity of the nocturne, found its advocates in [[Albert Pinkham Ryder]] and [[Ralph Albert Blakelock]].

In the late 19th century there also were several, rather dissimilar, groups of [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist painters]] whose works resonated with younger artists of the 20th century, especially with the [[Fauvism|Fauvists]] and the [[Surrealism|Surrealists]]. Among them were [[Gustave Moreau]], [[Odilon Redon]], [[Pierre Puvis de Chavannes]], [[Henri Fantin-Latour]], [[Arnold Böcklin]], [[Ferdinand Hodler]], [[Edvard Munch]], [[Félicien Rops]], [[Jan Toorop]], and [[Gustav Klimt]], and the [[Russian Symbolism|Russian Symbolists]] such as [[Mikhail Vrubel]].

Symbolist painters mined [[mythology]] and dream imagery for a visual language of the soul, seeking evocative paintings that brought to mind a static world of silence. The symbols used in Symbolism are not the familiar [[emblems]] of mainstream [[iconography]] but intensely personal, private, obscure and ambiguous references. More a philosophy than an actual style of art, the Symbolist painters influenced the contemporary [[Art Nouveau]] movement and [[Les Nabis]]. In their exploration of dreamlike subjects, symbolist painters are found across centuries and cultures, as they are still today; [[Bernard Delvaille]] has described [[René Magritte]]'s surrealism as "Symbolism plus [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard Delvaille|Delvaille, Bernard]], ''La poésie symboliste: anthologie'', introduction. {{ISBN|2-221-50161-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The heritage of painters like [[Van Gogh]], [[Cézanne]], [[Gauguin]], and [[Seurat]] was essential for the development of modern art. At the beginning of the 20th century [[Henri Matisse]] and several other young artists including the pre-cubist [[Georges Braque]], [[André Derain]], [[Raoul Dufy]] and [[Maurice de Vlaminck]] revolutionized the Paris art world with "wild", multi-colored, expressive landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called [[Fauvism]]. Henri Matisse's second version of ''[[The Dance (painting)|The Dance]]'' signifies a key point in his career and in the development of modern painting.&lt;ref&gt;Russell T. Clement. ''Four French Symbolists''. [[Greenwood Press]], 1996. Page 114.&lt;/ref&gt; It reflects Matisse's incipient fascination with [[primitive art]]: the intense warm colors against the cool blue-green background and the rhythmical succession of dancing nudes convey the feelings of emotional liberation and [[hedonism]]. [[Pablo Picasso]] made his first [[Cubism|cubist]] paintings based on Cézanne's idea that all depiction of nature can be reduced to three solids: [[cube]], [[sphere]] and [[cone (geometry)|cone]]. With the painting ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' (1907),  Picasso created a new and radical picture depicting a brothel scene with five prostitutes, violently painted women, reminiscent of [[African tribal masks]] and his own Cubist inventions. [[Cubism]] was jointly developed from about 1908 through 1912 by Pablo Picasso and [[Georges Braque]], whose ''Violin and Candlestick, Paris'' (1910) is shown here. The first clear manifestation of Cubism was practised by Braque, Picasso, [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], and [[Robert Delaunay]]. [[Juan Gris]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Alexander Archipenko]], [[Joseph Csaky]] and others soon joined.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;displayall=1#skipToContent |title=Christopher Green, 2009, Cubism, MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press |publisher=Moma.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Synthetic cubism]], practiced by Braque and Picasso, is characterized by the introduction of different textures, surfaces, [[collage]] elements, [[papier collé]] and a large variety of merged subject matter.&lt;ref name="Christopher Green" /&gt;

The [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1905 brought notoriety and attention to the works of [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Fauvism]]. The group gained their name after critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]] described their work with the phrase "[[Donatello]] chez les fauves" ("Donatello among the wild beasts"),&lt;ref name="Gil Blas, 17 October 1905"&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7522165g/f5.image Louis Vauxcelles, ''Le Salon d'Automne'', Gil Blas, 17 October 1905.

In the first two decades of the 20th century and after cubism, several other important movements emerged; [[Futurism (art)|Futurism]] ([[Giacomo Balla|Balla]]), [[Abstract art]] ([[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]]) [[Der Blaue Reiter]] (Kandinsky and [[Franz Marc]]), [[Bauhaus]] (Kandinsky and [[Paul Klee|Klee]]), [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]], ([[Robert Delaunay|Delaunay]] and [[František Kupka|Kupka]]), [[Synchromism]] ([[Morgan Russell|Russell]]), [[De Stijl]] ([[Theo van Doesburg|van Doesburg]] and [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]]), [[Suprematism]] ([[Malevich]]), [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] ([[Tatlin]]), [[Dadaism]] ([[Duchamp]], [[Picabia]] and [[Jean Arp|Arp]]), and [[Surrealism]] ([[Giorgio de Chirico|de Chirico]], [[André Breton]], [[Joan Miró|Miró]], [[René Magritte|Magritte]], [[Salvador Dalí|Dalí]] and [[Max Ernst|Ernst]]).  Modern painting influenced all the visual arts, from [[Modernist]] architecture and design, to [[avant-garde]] film, theatre and [[modern dance]] and became an experimental laboratory for the expression of visual experience, from photography and [[concrete poetry]] to [[advertising|advertising art]] and fashion.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[Fauvism]] was a loose grouping of early 20th-century artists whose works emphasized [[painterly]] qualities, and the imaginative use of deep color over the representational values. The leaders of the movement were [[Henri Matisse]] and [[André Derain]] – friendly rivals of a sort, each with his own followers.  Ultimately [[Matisse]] became the ''yang'' to [[Picasso]]'s ''yin'' in the 20th century. Fauvist painters included [[Albert Marquet]], [[Charles Camoin]], [[Maurice de Vlaminck]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Othon Friesz]], the Dutch painter [[Kees van Dongen]], and Picasso's partner in Cubism, [[Georges Braque]] amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;''The "Wild Beasts" Fauvism and its Affinities,'' [[John Elderfield]], Museum of Modern Art 1976, {{ISBN|0-87070-638-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fauvism had no concrete theories, and was short lived, beginning in 1905 and ending in 1907. They had only three exhibitions. Matisse was seen as the leader of the movement, due to his seniority in age and prior self-establishment in the academic art world. His 1905 portrait of Mme. Matisse, ''[[Green Stripe|The Green Stripe]]'', caused a sensation in Paris when it was first exhibited. He said he wanted to create art to delight, and it can be said that his use of bright colors tries to maintain serenity of composition. In 1906 at the suggestion of his dealer [[Ambroise Vollard]], André Derain went to London and produced a series of paintings including ''Charing Cross Bridge, London'' in the [[Fauvism|Fauvist]] style, paraphrasing the famous series by the [[Impressionist]] painter [[Claude Monet]].

By 1907 Fauvism no longer was a shocking new movement, and [[Guillaume Apollinaire|Appolinaire]] said of Matisse in an article published in ''La Falange'', "We are not here in the presence of an extravagant or an extremist undertaking: Matisse's art is eminently reasonable."&lt;ref&gt;''Picasso and Braque pioneering cubism'' [[William Rubin]], published by the [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York, copyright 1989, {{ISBN|0-87070-676-4}} p. 348.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Die Brücke]] was a group of German [[expressionist]] artists formed in [[Dresden]] in 1905. Founding members were [[Fritz Bleyl]], [[Erich Heckel]], [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]] and [[Karl Schmidt-Rottluff]]. Later members included [[Max Pechstein]] and [[Otto Mueller]]. This seminal group had a major impact on the evolution of [[modern art]] in the 20th century and created the style of [[Expressionism]].&lt;ref name=bruckemuseumbrucke&gt;[http://www.bruecke-museum.de/englbleyl.htm "The Artists' Association 'Brücke'"], [[Brücke-Museum (Berlin)|Brücke Museum]]. Retrieved 7 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Der Blaue Reiter]] was a German movement lasting from 1911 to 1914, fundamental to Expressionism. [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Franz Marc]], [[August Macke]], [[Alexej von Jawlensky]], whose psychically expressive painting of the Russian dancer ''Portrait of [[Alexander Sakharoff]]'' (1909) is seen here, [[Marianne von Werefkin]], [[Lyonel Feininger]] and others founded the Der Blaue Reiter group in response to the rejection of Kandinsky's painting ''Last Judgement'' from an exhibition. Der Blaue Reiter lacked a central artistic manifesto, but was centered around Kandinsky and Marc. Artists [[Gabriele Münter]] and [[Paul Klee]] were also involved. The name of the movement comes from a painting by Kandinsky created in 1903. For Kandinsky, ''blue'' is the color of spirituality: the darker the blue, the more it awakens human desire for the eternal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=86 Der Blaue Reiter, Tate Glossary] retrieved 10 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Expressionism]]'' and ''[[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]'' are broad rubrics that involve several related movements in 20th-century painting that dominated much of the [[avant-garde]] art being made in Western, Eastern and Northern Europe. Expressionist works were painted largely between World War I and World War II, mostly in France, Germany, Norway, Russia, Belgium, and Austria. [[Fauvism]], [[Die Brücke]], and [[Der Blaue Reiter]] are three of the best known groups of Expressionist and Symbolist painters. [[Marc Chagall]]'s painting ''[[I and the Village]]'' tells an autobiographical story that examines the relationship between the artist and his origins, with a lexicon of artistic Symbolism. [[Gustav Klimt]], [[Egon Schiele]], [[Edvard Munch]], [[Emil Nolde]], [[Chaim Soutine]], [[James Ensor]], [[Oskar Kokoschka]], [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]], [[Max Beckmann]], [[Franz Marc]], [[Georges Rouault]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]], and some Americans abroad such as [[Marsden Hartley]] and [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]], were considered influential expressionist painters. Although [[Alberto Giacometti]] is primarily thought of as a Surrealist sculptor, he made intense expressionist paintings as well.

American painters during the period between World War I and World War II tended to go to Europe for recognition.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

[[Wassily Kandinsky]] is generally considered one of the first important painters of [[Modern Art|modern]] [[abstract art]]. As an early [[modernist]],  he theorized as did contemporary [[occultists]] and [[theosophists]], that pure visual abstraction had corollary vibrations with sound and music. They posited that pure abstraction could express pure spirituality. His earliest abstractions were generally titled as the example in the ''Composition VII'', making connection to the work of the composers of music. Kandinsky included many of his theories about abstract art in his book ''Concerning the Spiritual in Art''. Other major pioneers of early abstraction include Swedish painter [[Hilma af Klint]], Russian painter [[Kazimir Malevich]], and Swiss painter [[Paul Klee]]. [[Robert Delaunay]] was a French artist who is associated with [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]], (reminiscent of a link between pure abstraction and cubism). His key contributions to abstract painting refer to his bold use of color and his experimentation of both depth and tone.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[Marcel Duchamp]] came to international prominence in the wake of the New York City [[Armory Show]] in 1913 where his ''[[Nude Descending a Staircase]]'' became a cause célèbre. He subsequently created ''[[The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even]], [[Large Glass]]''. The ''Large Glass'' pushed the art of painting to radical new limits being part painting, part collage, part construction. Duchamp (who was soon to renounce artmaking for chess) became closely associated with the [[Dada]] movement that began in neutral [[Zürich, Switzerland]], during World War I and peaked from 1916 to 1920. The movement primarily involved visual arts, literature (poetry, art manifestoes, art theory), theatre, and graphic design to advance its antiwar politic and rejection of the prevailing standards in art through [[anti-art]] cultural works. Other artists associated with the Dada movement include [[Francis Picabia]], [[Man Ray]], [[Kurt Schwitters]], [[Hannah Höch]], [[Tristan Tzara]], [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]], [[Jean Arp]], and [[Sophie Taeuber-Arp]]. Duchamp and several Dadaists are also associated with Surrealism, the movement that dominated European painting in the 1920s and 1930s.

In 1924 [[André Breton]] published the ''[[Surrealist Manifesto]]''. The [[Surrealist]] movement in painting became synonymous with the [[avant-garde]] and featured artists whose works varied from the abstract to the super-realist. With works on paper like ''Machine Turn Quickly'', Francis Picabia continued his involvement in the Dada movement through 1919 in Zürich and Paris, before breaking away from it after developing an interest in Surrealist art. [[Yves Tanguy]], [[René Magritte]] and [[Salvador Dalí]] are particularly known for their realistic depictions of dream imagery and fantastic manifestations of the imagination. During the 1920s [[André Masson]]'s work was decisive in helping the young artist [[Joan Miró]] find his roots in Surrealist painting. Miró's ''[[The Tilled Field]]'' (1923–1924) verges on abstraction while suggesting a complex of objects and figures and arrangements of sexually active characters; it was Miró's first Surrealist [[masterpiece]].&lt;ref&gt;Spector, Nancy. "[http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/artist_work_md_109_7.html The Tilled Field, 1923–1924] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925010715/http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/artist_work_md_109_7.html |date=25 September 2008 }}". [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim]] display caption. Retrieved 30 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Joan Miró, Jean Arp, André Masson, and [[Max Ernst]] were very influential, especially in the United States during the 1940s.

Max Ernst, whose 1920 painting ''Murdering Airplane'' is seen here, studied philosophy and psychology in Bonn and was interested in the alternative realities experienced by the insane. His paintings may have been inspired by the [[psychoanalyst]] [[Sigmund Freud]]'s study of the delusions of a paranoiac, Daniel Paul Schreber. Freud identified Schreber's fantasy of becoming a woman as a ''[[castration complex]].'' The central image of two pairs of legs refers to Schreber's hermaphroditic desires. Ernst's inscription on the back of the painting reads: ''The picture is curious because of its symmetry. The two sexes balance one another.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&amp;workid=4133&amp;searchid=19833&amp;tabview=text |title=From the Tate Modern |publisher=Tate.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1930s, Surrealism continued to become more visible to the public at large. A [[British Surrealist Group|Surrealist group developed in Britain]] and, according to Breton, their 1936 [[London International Surrealist Exhibition]] was a high-water mark of the period and became the model for international exhibitions. Surrealist groups in Japan, and especially in Latin America, the Caribbean and in Mexico produced innovative and original works. Other prominent surrealist artists include [[Giorgio de Chirico]], [[Méret Oppenheim]], [[Toyen]], [[Grégoire Michonze]], [[Roberto Matta]], [[Kay Sage]], [[Leonora Carrington]], [[Dorothea Tanning]], and [[Leonor Fini]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;
During the 1920s and the 1930s and the [[Great Depression]], the European art scene was characterized by Surrealism, late Cubism, the [[Bauhaus]], [[De Stijl]], Dada, [[Neue Sachlichkeit]], and Expressionism; and was occupied by masterful [[modernist]] color painters like [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Pierre Bonnard]].

In Germany [[Neue Sachlichkeit]] ("New Objectivity") emerged as [[Max Beckmann]], [[Otto Dix]], [[George Grosz]] and others politicized their paintings. The work of these artists grew out of expressionism, and was a response to the political tensions of the [[Weimar Republic]], and was often sharply satirical.

During the 1930s radical leftist politics characterized many of the artists connected to Surrealism, including [[Pablo Picasso]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Helena. ''Dada Turns Red''. 1990. [[Edinburgh University Press]]. A history of the uneasy relations between Surrealists and Communists from the 1920s through the 1950s.&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 April 1937, during the [[Spanish Civil War]], the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque]] town of [[Gernika]] was the scene of the "[[Bombing of Gernika]]" by the Condor Legion of Nazi Germany's Luftwaffe. The Germans were attacking to support the efforts of Francisco Franco to overthrow the Basque Government and the Spanish Republican government. Pablo Picasso painted his mural sized ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' to commemorate the horrors of the bombing.
[[File:PicassoGuernica.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pablo Picasso]], 1937, [[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]], protest against Fascism]]
''Guernica'' is an immense black-and-white, 3.5 metre (11&amp;nbsp;ft) tall and 7.8 metre (23&amp;nbsp;ft) wide mural painted in oil. The mural presents a scene of death, violence, brutality, suffering, and helplessness without portraying their immediate causes. The choice to paint in black and white invokes the immediacy of a newspaper photograph.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon, Laura (2012). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=VBHWBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT75 Art and War]''. I.B. Tauris. {{ISBN|0857732811}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
The painting was first exhibited in Paris in 1937, then Scandinavia and London, and in 1939 at Picasso's request the painting was sent to the United States in an extended loan (for safekeeping) at [[MoMA]]. Finally in accord with Picasso's wish to give the painting to the people of Spain as a gift, it was sent to Spain in 1981.

From the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s through the years of World War II, [[Visual art of the United States|American art]] was characterized by [[Social Realism]] and [[American Scene Painting]]. [[Regionalism (art)|Regionalism]] movements that contained both political and social commentary dominated the art world in the USA. Artists such as [[Ben Shahn]], [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]], [[Grant Wood]], [[George Tooker]], [[John Steuart Curry]], [[Reginald Marsh (artist)|Reginald Marsh]], and others became prominent.

''[[American Gothic]]'' is a painting by Grant Wood from 1930. Portraying a pitchfork-holding farmer and a younger woman in front of a house of [[Carpenter Gothic]] style, it is one of the most familiar images in 20th-century American art. Art critics assumed it was satirical in intent; it was thought to be part of the trend towards increasingly critical depictions of rural America exemplified by [[Sherwood Anderson]]'s ''1919 [[Winesburg, Ohio (novel)|Winesburg, Ohio]]'', [[Sinclair Lewis]]' 1920 ''[[Main Street (novel)|Main Street]]'', and [[Carl Van Vechten]]'s ''The Tattooed Countess'' in literature.&lt;ref name=slate&gt;Fineman, Mia, [http://www.slate.com/id/2120494/ The Most Famous Farm Couple in the World: Why American Gothic still fascinates.], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', 8 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  However, with the onset of the [[Great Depression]], the painting came to be seen as a depiction of steadfast American pioneer spirit.

A renaissance of the arts in Latin America included the [[Uruguay]]an painter [[Joaquín Torres García]], the Mexican painter [[Rufino Tamayo]], artists of the Mexican [[Mexican muralism|muralist movement]] such as [[Diego Rivera]], [[David Siqueiros]], [[José Orozco]], [[Pedro Nel Gómez]] and [[Santiago Martinez Delgado]], and the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] painter [[Frida Kahlo]]. The muralists conveyed historic and political messages. Diego Rivera is perhaps best known by the public world for his 1933 mural, "[[Man at the Crossroads]]", in the lobby of the RCA Building at [[Rockefeller Center]]. When his patron [[Nelson Rockefeller]] discovered that the mural included a portrait of [[Lenin]] and other communist imagery, he fired Rivera, and the unfinished work was eventually destroyed by Rockefeller's staff.

Frida Kahlo's works relate to Surrealism and to the [[Magic Realism]] movement in literature. Her works are often characterized by their stark portrayals of pain. Of her 143 paintings 55 are self-portraits, which frequently incorporate symbolic portrayals of her physical and psychological wounds.&lt;ref&gt;Herrera, Hayden. "Frida Kahlo". Oxford Art Online.

The 1940s in New York City heralded the triumph of American [[abstract expressionism]], a movement that combined lessons learned from European Modernists via great teachers in America like [[Hans Hofmann]] and [[John D. Graham]]. American artists benefited from the presence of [[Piet Mondrian]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Max Ernst]] and the [[André Breton]] group, Pierre Matisse's gallery, and [[Peggy Guggenheim]]'s gallery ''[[The Art of This Century]]'', as well as other factors.
 [[File:Newman-Onement 1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Barnett Newman]], ''Onement 1,'' 1948. During the 1940s Barnett Newman wrote several articles about the new American painting.]]
Post-Second World War American painting called Abstract expressionism included artists like [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Mark Rothko]], Hans Hofmann, [[Clyfford Still]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Mark Tobey]], [[James Brooks (painter)|James Brooks]], [[Philip Guston]], [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Conrad Marca-Relli]], [[Jack Tworkov]], [[Esteban Vicente]], [[William Baziotes]], [[Richard Pousette-Dart]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Hedda Sterne]], [[Jimmy Ernst]], [[Bradley Walker Tomlin]], and [[Theodoros Stamos]], among others. American Abstract expressionism got its name in 1946 from the art critic [[Robert Coates (critic)|Robert Coates]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.moma.org/explore/multimedia/interactives/156 Abstract Expressionism, NY, MoMA]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clement Greenberg, ''Art and Culture Critical essays,'' ("American-Type Painting"), Beacon Press, 1961 pp.:208–229, {{ISBN|978-0807066812}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Abstract expressionism, [[Action painting]], and [[Color Field]] painting are synonymous with the [[New York School (art)|New York School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/ppaessay.html|title=Post Painterly Abstraction|author=|date=|website=www.sharecom.ca|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technically Surrealism was an important predecessor for Abstract expressionism with its emphasis on spontaneous, [[Surrealist automatism|automatic]] or subconscious creation. [[Jackson Pollock]]'s dripping paint onto a canvas laid on the floor is a technique that has its roots in the work of [[André Masson]]. Another important ear&lt;nowiki&gt;ly m&lt;/nowiki&gt;anifestation of what came to be abstract expressionism is the work of American Northwest artist [[Mark Tobey]], especially his "white writing" canvases, which, though generally not large in scale, anticipate the "all over" look of Pollock's drip paintings.

Additionally, Abstract expressionism has an image of being rebellious, anarchic, highly idiosyncratic and, some feel, rather nihilistic. In practice, the term is applied to any number of artists working (mostly) in New York who had quite different styles, and even applied to work which is not especially abstract nor expressionist. Pollock's energetic "[[action painting]]s", with their "busy" feel, are different both technically and aesthetically, to the violent and grotesque ''Women'' series of [[Willem de Kooning]]. Woman V is one of a series of six paintings made by de Kooning between 1950 and 1953 that depict a three-quarter-length female figure. He began the first of these paintings, Woman I, in June 1950, repeatedly changing and painting out the image until January or February 1952, when the painting was abandoned unfinished. The art historian [[Meyer Schapiro]] saw the painting in de Kooning's studio and encouraged the artist to persist. De Kooning's response was to begin three other paintings on the same theme; Woman II, [[Woman III]], and Woman IV. During the summer of 1952, spent at [[East Hampton (town), New York|East Hampton]], de Kooning further explored the theme through drawings and pastels. He finished work on Woman I by November 1952, and probably the other three women pictures were concluded at much the same time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov.au/International/Catalogue/Detail.cfm?IRN=47761&amp;BioArtistIRN=25281&amp;MnuID=2&amp;GalID=1 NGA.gov.au], [[National Gallery of Australia]]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Woman series'' are decidedly [[Figurative art|figurative paintings]]. Another important artist is [[Franz Kline]], as demonstrated by his painting ''High Street'' (1950), who was labelled an action painter because of his seemingly spontaneous and intense style, focusing less, or not at all, on figures or imagery, but on the actual brush strokes and use of canvas.

[[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], and the serenely shimmering blocks of color in [[Mark Rothko]]'s work (which is not what would usually be called expressionist and which Rothko denied was abstract), are classified as abstract expressionists, albeit from what [[Clement Greenberg]] termed the [[Color field]] direction of abstract expressionism. Both [[Hans Hofmann]] and [[Robert Motherwell]] can be described as practitioners of [[action painting]] and Color field painting.

During the 1950s ''Color Field painting'' initially referred to a particular type of [[abstract expressionism]], especially the work of Mark Rothko, Clyfford Still, Barnett Newman, [[Robert Motherwell]]  and Adolph Gottlieb. It essentially involved abstract paintings with large, flat expanses of color that expressed the sensual, and visual feelings and properties of large areas of nuanced surface. Art critic Clement Greenberg perceived Color Field painting as related to but different from Action painting. The overall expanse and gestalt of the work of the early color field painters speaks of an almost religious experience, awestruck in the face of an expanding universe of sensuality, color and surface. During the early-to-mid-1960s ''Color Field painting'' came to refer to the styles of artists like [[Jules Olitski]], [[Kenneth Noland]], and [[Helen Frankenthaler]], whose works were related to second-generation abstract expressionism, and to younger artists like [[Larry Zox]], and [[Frank Stella]] – all moving in a new direction.

During the 1930s through the 1960s as abstract painting in America and Europe evolved into movements such as [[abstract expressionism]], Color Field painting, [[Post-painterly Abstraction]], [[Op art]], [[hard-edge painting]], [[Minimal art]], [[shaped canvas]] painting, and [[Lyrical Abstraction]]. Other artists reacted as a response to the tendency toward abstraction allowing imagery to continue through various new contexts like the [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]] in the 1950s and new forms of [[expressionism]] from the 1940s through the 1960s. Throughout the 20th century many painters practiced [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] and used expressive imagery in landscape and figurative painting with contemporary subjects. They include artists as varied as [[Milton Avery]], [[John D. Graham]], [[Fairfield Porter]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Andrew Wyeth]], [[Balthus]], [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], [[Frank Auerbach]], [[Lucian Freud]], [[Leon Kossoff]], [[Philip Pearlstein]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Grace Hartigan]], [[Robert De Niro, Sr.]], and [[Elaine de Kooning]].

In Italy during this time, [[Giorgio Morandi]] was the foremost still-life painter, exploring a wide variety of approaches to depicting everyday bottles and kitchen implements.&lt;ref&gt;David Piper, p. 635&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Arshile Gorky's portrait of Willem de Kooning is an example of the evolution of [[abstract expressionism]] from the context of figure painting, [[cubism]] and [[surrealism]]. Along with his friends de Kooning and [[John D. Graham]] Gorky created bio-morphically shaped and abstracted figurative compositions that by the 1940s evolved into totally abstract paintings. Gorky's work seems to be a careful analysis of memory, emotion and shape, using line and color to express feeling and nature.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, Melissa (2009). "Chronology", in: Michael R. Taylor (ed.), Arshile Gorky: A Retrospective. Philadelphia, Pa.: Philadelphia Museum of Art. {{ISBN|9780876332139}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Rachel (2003). ''Abstract Expressionists''. Chicago: Heinemann Library. {{ISBN|9781588106445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Study after Velázquez's Portrait of Pope Innocent X]]'', 1953 is a painting by the Irish-born artist [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]] and is an example of Post World War II European [[Expressionism]]. The work shows a distorted version of the [[Portrait of Innocent X]] painted by the Spanish artist [[Diego Velázquez]] in 1650. The work is one of a series of variants of the Velázquez painting which Bacon executed throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, over a total of forty-five works.&lt;ref&gt;Schmied, Wieland (1996). ''Francis Bacon: Commitment and Conflict''. (Munich) Prestel. {{ISBN|3-7913-1664-8}}, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; When asked why he was compelled to revisit the subject so often, Bacon replied that he had nothing against the Popes, that he merely "wanted an excuse to use these colours, and you can't give ordinary clothes that purple colour without getting into a sort of false [[Fauvism|fauve]] manner."&lt;ref&gt;Peppiatt, Michael, ''Anatomy of an Enigma''. Westview Press. {{ISBN|0-8133-3520-5}} (1996), p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; The Pope in this version seethes with anger and aggression, and the dark colors give the image a grotesque and nightmarish appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Schmied (1996), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; The pleated curtains of the backdrop are rendered transparent, and seem to fall through the Pope's face.&lt;ref&gt;Peppiatt (1996), p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

The figurative work of Francis Bacon, Frida Kahlo, Edward Hopper, Lucian Freud, Andrew Wyeth and others served as a kind of alternative to abstract expressionism. ''[[Nighthawks]]'' (1942) is a realist painting by Edward Hopper that portrays people sitting in a downtown [[diner]] late at night. It is not only Hopper's most famous painting, but one of the most recognizable in American art. The urban street is empty outside the diner, and inside none of the three patrons is apparently looking or talking to the others but instead is lost in their own thoughts. This portrayal of modern urban life as empty or lonely is a common theme throughout Hopper's work. One of the most well-known images in 20th-century American art is Wyeth's tempera painting, ''[[Christina's World]]'', in the collection of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in [[New York City]]. It depicts a woman lying on the ground in a treeless, mostly tawny field, looking up at and crawling towards a gray house on the horizon; a barn and various other small outbuildings are adjacent to the house.&lt;ref name="moma"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?object_id=78455 ''Christina's World''] in the [[Museum of Modern Art|MoMA]] Online Collection&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II the term [[School of Paris]] often referred to [[Tachisme]], the European equivalent of American Abstract expressionism and those artists are also related to [[COBRA (avant-garde movement)|Cobra]]. Important proponents being [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Pierre Soulages]], [[Nicolas de Staël]], [[Hans Hartung]], [[Serge Poliakoff]], and [[Georges Mathieu]], among several others. During the early 1950s Dubuffet (who was always a figurative artist) and de Staël abandoned abstraction, and returned to imagery via figuration and landscape. De Staël's return to representation (seascapes, footballers, jazz musicians, seagulls) during the early 1950s can be seen as an influential precedent for the American [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]], as many of those abstract painters like [[Richard Diebenkorn]], [[David Park (painter)|David Park]], [[Elmer Bischoff]], [[Wayne Thiebaud]], [[Nathan Oliveira]], [[Joan Brown]] and others made a similar move; returning to imagery during the mid-1950s. Much of de Staël's late work – in particular his abstract landscapes of the mid-1950s – predicts Color Field painting and [[Lyrical Abstraction]] of the 1960s and 1970s. Milton Avery as well through his use of color and his interest in seascape and landscape paintings connected with the Color field aspect of Abstract expressionism as manifested by [[Adolph Gottlieb]] and [[Mark Rothko]] as well as the lessons American painters took from the work of [[Henri Matisse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Glueck |first=Grace |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DEEDA1139F934A35752C0A9639C8B63&amp;ref=miltonavery |title=NY Times, Grace Glueck, Art in Review; '&amp;#39;Milton Avery – Onrushing Waves'&amp;#39; |publisher=New York Times |date=2005-01-07 |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hilton Kramer |url=http://observer.com/2002/05/the-summer-of-57-with-milton-avery-gottlieb-rothko/ |title=Hilton Kramer, NY Observer, '&amp;#39;Summer of 57 with Avery, Gottlieb, Rothko'&amp;#39; |publisher=Observer.com |date=2002-05-13 |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pop art]] in America was to a large degree initially inspired by the works of [[Jasper Johns]], [[Larry Rivers]], and [[Robert Rauschenberg]], although the paintings of [[Gerald Murphy]], [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]] and [[Charles Demuth]] during the 1920s and 1930s foreshadow the style and subject matter of Pop art. 

In New York City during the mid-1950s, Rauschenberg and Johns created works of art that at first seemed to be continuations of [[Abstract expressionist]] painting. Actually their works, and the work of Larry Rivers, were radical departures from abstract expressionism especially in the use of banal and literal imagery and the inclusion of mundane materials into their work. Johns' use of various images and objects like chairs, numbers, targets, beer cans and the [[American Flag]]; Rivers' paintings of subjects drawn from popular culture such as [[George Washington]] crossing the [[Delaware River|Delaware]], and his inclusions of images from advertisements like the camel from [[Camel cigarettes]]; and Rauschenberg's surprising constructions using inclusions of objects and pictures taken from popular culture, hardware stores, junkyards, the city streets, and [[taxidermy]], gave rise to a radical new movement in American art. Eventually by 1963 the movement came to be known worldwide as Pop art.

Pop art is exemplified by the artists [[Andy Warhol]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Wayne Thiebaud]], [[James Rosenquist]], [[Jim Dine]], [[Tom Wesselmann]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]] among others. Lichtenstein used oil and [[Magna paint]] in works such as ''[[Drowning Girl]]'' (1963; [[Museum of Modern Art, New York]]), which was appropriated from the lead story in [[DC Comics]]' ''Secret Hearts'' #83.&lt;ref name="rlf-Hendrickson31"&gt;{{harvnb|Hendrickson| 1988| p= 31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) Thick outlines, bold colors and [[Ben-Day dots]] reproduce the appearance of commercial printing. Lichtenstein would say of his own work: Abstract Expressionists "put things down on the canvas and responded to what they had done, to the color positions and sizes. My style looks completely different, but the nature of putting down lines pretty much is the same; mine just don't come out looking calligraphic, like Pollock's or Kline's."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pop art merges popular and mass culture with fine art, while injecting humor, irony, and recognizable imagery and content into the mix. In October 1962 the [[Sidney Janis]] Gallery mounted ''The New Realists'', the first major Pop art group exhibition in an uptown art gallery in New York City. The show sent shockwaves through the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] and reverberated worldwide. ''[[Campbell's Soup Cans]]'' (sometimes referred to as ''32 Campbell's Soup Cans'') is the title of an [[Andy Warhol]] work of art that was produced in 1962. It consists of thirty-two canvases of equal size, each consisting of a painting of a [[Campbell Soup Company|Campbell's Soup]] can—one of each [[canned soup]] variety the company offered at the time. The individual paintings were produced with a semi-mechanised [[silkscreen]] process, using a non-[[painterly]] style. They helped usher in Pop art as a major art movement that relied on themes from [[popular culture]].

Earlier in England in 1956 the term ''Pop Art'' was used by [[Lawrence Alloway]] for paintings that celebrated consumerism of the post World War II era. This movement rejected Abstract expressionism and its focus on the hermeneutic and psychological interior, in favor of art which depicted material consumer culture, advertising, and iconography of the mass production age.&lt;ref&gt;Topics in American Art since 1945, ''Pop art the words'', pp. 119–122, by [[Lawrence Alloway]], copyright 1975 by [[W. W. Norton and Company]], NYC {{ISBN|0-393-04401-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early works of English artist [[David Hockney]], such as ''[[A Bigger Splash]]'', and the works of [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]], [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]], and [[Eduardo Paolozzi]], are considered seminal examples in the movement.
In New York's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] [[Tenth street galleries|10th Street galleries]] artists were formulating an American version of Pop art. [[Claes Oldenburg]] had his storefront, and the [[Green Gallery]] on 57th Street began to show [[Tom Wesselmann]] and [[James Rosenquist]]. There is a connection between the radical works of Duchamp, and [[Man Ray]], the rebellious Dadaists – with a sense of humor; and Pop Artists like [[Alex Katz]], Claes Oldenburg, Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and the others.

====Art Brut, New Realism, Bay Area Figurative Movement, Neo-Dada, Photorealism====

[[File:'Still Life with Cup', oil on canvas painting by Paul Wonner, 1959, private collection.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Paul Wonner]], 1959, [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]]]] 
During the 1950s and 1960s as abstract painting in America and Europe evolved into movements such as [[Color Field]] painting, [[Post painterly abstraction]], [[Op art]], [[hard-edge painting]], [[Minimal art]], [[shaped canvas]] painting, [[Lyrical Abstraction]], and the continuation of Abstract expressionism. Other artists reacted as a response to the tendency toward abstraction with [[Outsider art|Art brut]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Dubuffet]]: ''L’Art brut préféré aux arts culturels'' [1949] {{en icon}} ''Art brut. Madness and Marginalia'', special issue of ''Art &amp; Text'', No. 27, 1987, pp. 31–33)&lt;/ref&gt; as seen in ''Court les rues,'' 1962, by [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Fluxus]], [[Neo-Dada]], [[New Realism]], [[Photorealism]], allowing imagery to re-emerge through various new contexts like [[Pop art]], the [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]] (a prime example is Diebenkorn's ''Cityscape I,(Landscape No. 1)'' (1963), and later in the 1970s [[Neo-expressionism]]. The [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]] of whom [[David Park (painter)|David Park]], [[Elmer Bischoff]], [[Nathan Oliveira]] and [[Richard Diebenkorn]] whose painting ''Cityscape 1'' (1963) is a typical example, were influential members flourished during the 1950s and 1960s in California. Younger painters practiced the use of imagery in new and radical ways. [[Yves Klein]], [[Arman]], [[Martial Raysse]], [[Christo]], [[Niki de Saint Phalle]], [[David Hockney]], [[Alex Katz]], [[Malcolm Morley]], [[Ralph Goings]], [[Audrey Flack]], [[Richard Estes]], [[Chuck Close]], [[Susan Rothenberg]], [[Eric Fischl]], and [[Vija Celmins]] were a few who became prominent between the 1960s and the 1980s. [[Fairfield Porter]] was largely self-taught, and produced representational work in the midst of the Abstract Expressionist movement. His subjects were primarily landscapes, domestic interiors and portraits of family, friends and fellow artists.

Also during the 1960s and 1970s, there was a reaction against painting. Critics like Douglas Crimp viewed the work of artists like [[Ad Reinhardt]], and declared the "death of painting". Artists began to practice new ways of making art. New movements gained prominence some of which are: [[Fluxus]], [[Happening]], [[Video art]], [[Installation art]] [[Mail art]], the [[situationists]], [[Conceptual art]], [[Postminimalism]], [[Earth art]], [[arte povera]], [[performance art]] and [[body art]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Crimp, ''The End of Painting'', October, Vol. 16, Spring, 1981, pp. 69–86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Crimp, ''On the Museum's Ruins'', Cambridge, Mass., 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-Dada is also a movement that started in the 1950s and 1960s and was related to Abstract expressionism only with imagery. This trend, in which manufactured items are combined with artist materials, is exemplified by the work of [[Jasper Johns]] and [[Robert Rauschenberg]]. Rauschenberg's "combines" in the 1950s were forerunners of Pop Art and [[Installation art]], and made use of the assemblage of large physical objects, including stuffed animals, birds and commercial photography. Rauschenberg, Johns, [[Larry Rivers]], [[John Chamberlain (sculptor)|John Chamberlain]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]], [[Jim Dine]], and [[Edward Kienholz]] among others created new conventions of art-making; they made acceptable in serious contemporary art circles the radical inclusion of unlikely materials as parts of their works of art.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Craft, ''An Audience of Artists: Dada, Neo-Dada, and the Emergence of Abstract Expressionism'', University of Chicago, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Susan Hapgood, ''Neo-Dada: Redefining Art, 1958–62'', Universe Books and American Federation of Arts, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

During the 1960s and 1970s abstract painting continued to develop in America through varied styles. [[Geometric abstraction]], Op art, [[hard-edge painting]], Color Field painting and [[Minimalism|minimal]] painting, were some interrelated directions for advanced abstract painting as well as some other new movements. [[Morris Louis]] was an important pioneer in advanced [[Colorfield painting]], his work can serve as a bridge between [[Abstract expressionism]], Colorfield painting, and [[Minimal Art]].  Two influential teachers, [[Josef Albers]] and [[Hans Hofmann]], introduced a new generation of American artists to their advanced theories of color and space. Albers is best remembered for his work as a [[Geometric abstraction]]ist painter and theorist. Most famous of all are the hundreds of paintings and prints that make up the series ''Homage to the Square''. In this rigorous series, begun in 1949, Albers explored chromatic interactions with flat colored squares arranged concentrically on the canvas.  Albers' theories on art and education were formative for the next generation of artists.  His own paintings form the foundation of both hard-edge painting and Op art.

Josef Albers, Hans Hofmann, [[Ilya Bolotowsky]], [[Burgoyne Diller]], [[Victor Vasarely]], [[Bridget Riley]], [[Richard Anuszkiewicz]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Kenneth Noland]],&lt;ref&gt;Terry Fenton, online essay about [[Kenneth Noland]], and [[acrylic paint]], [http://www.sharecom.ca/noland/materials Sharecom.ca], accessed 30 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[John McLaughlin (artist)|John McLaughlin]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[John Hoyland]], [[Larry Zox]], [[Al Held]], [[Mino Argento]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-01-22/entertainment/ca-25065_1_geometric-shapes | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Cathy | last=Curtis | title=Wilshire Center | date=22 January 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; are artists closely associated with [[Geometric abstraction]], Op art, Color Field painting, and in the case of Hofmann and Newman Abstract expressionism as well. [[Agnes Martin]], [[Robert Mangold]], [[Brice Marden]], [[Jo Baer]], [[Robert Ryman]], [[Richard Tuttle]], Neil Williams, David Novros, Paul Mogenson, are examples of artists associated with Minimalism and (exceptions of Martin, Baer and Marden) the use of the [[shaped canvas]] also during the period beginning in the early 1960s. Many [[Geometric abstract art]]ists, minimalists, and Hard-edge painters elected to use the edges of the image to define the shape of the painting rather than accepting the rectangular format. In fact, the use of the shaped canvas is primarily associated with paintings of the 1960s and 1970s that are coolly abstract, formalistic, geometrical, objective, rationalistic, clean-lined, brashly sharp-edged, or minimalist in character. The [[Bykert Gallery]], and the [[Park Place Gallery]] were important showcases for Minimalism and shaped canvas painting in New York City during the 1960s.

====Shaped canvas, Washington Color School, Abstract Illusionism, Lyrical Abstraction====
&lt;!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: DO NOT ADD YOUR OWN NAME TO THIS LIST! --&gt;


[[File:Gardenofdelight.jpg|thumb|120px|left|[[Ronnie Landfield]], 1971, [[Lyrical Abstraction]]]]
Color Field painting pointed toward a new direction in American painting, away from [[abstract expressionism]]. Related to [[Post-painterly abstraction]], [[Suprematism]], Abstract Expressionism, [[Hard-edge painting]] and [[Lyrical Abstraction]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sbmuseart.org/exhibitions/colorscope.web&lt;/ref&gt; Color Field painting sought to rid art of superfluous rhetoric. Artists like [[Clyfford Still]], [[Mark Rothko]], Hans Hofmann, [[Morris Louis]], [[Jules Olitski]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Larry Zox]], and others painted with a highly articulated and psychological use of color. In general these artists eliminated recognizable imagery. Certain artists made references to past or present art, but in general color field painting presents abstraction as an end in itself. In pursuing this direction of [[modern art]], artists wanted to present each painting as one cohesive, monolithic image. [[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]] along with Kenneth Noland, Morris Louis and several others was a member of the [[Washington Color School]] painters who began to create [[Color Field painting]]s in Washington, D.C. during the 1950s and 1960s, ''Black, Grey, Beat'' is a large vertical stripe painting and typical of Gene Davis's work.
[[Frank Stella]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], Barnett Newman, [[Ronald Davis]], [[Neil Williams (artist)|Neil Williams]], [[Robert Mangold]], [[Charles Hinman]], [[Richard Tuttle]], David Novros, and Al Loving are examples of artists associated with the use of the [[shaped canvas]] during the period beginning in the early 1960s.

From 1960 Frank Stella produced paintings in aluminum and copper paint and his first works using shaped canvases (canvases in a shape other than the traditional rectangle or square), often being in L, N, U or T-shapes. These later developed into more elaborate designs, in the ''Irregular Polygon'' series (1967), for example. Later he began his ''Protractor Series'' (1971) of paintings, in which [[circle|arcs]], sometimes overlapping, within square borders are arranged side-by-side to produce full and half circles painted in rings of concentric color. ''Harran II,'' 1967, is an example of the ''Protractor Series''.

The Andre Emmerich Gallery, the [[Leo Castelli]] Gallery, the Richard Feigen Gallery, and the [[Park Place Gallery]] were important showcases for Color Field painting, shaped canvas painting and [[Lyrical Abstraction]] in New York City during the 1960s. There is a connection with [[post-painterly abstraction]], which reacted against abstract expressionisms' mysticism, hyper-subjectivity, and emphasis on making the act of painting itself dramatically visible – as well as the solemn acceptance of the flat rectangle as an almost ritual prerequisite for serious painting. During the 1960s Color Field painting and [[Minimal art]] were often closely associated with each other. In actuality by the early 1970s both movements became decidedly diverse.

Lyrical Abstraction (the term being coined by Larry Aldrich, the founder of the [[Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum]], Ridgefield Connecticut), encompassed what Aldrich said he saw in the studios of many artists at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich, Larry. Young Lyrical Painters, Art in America, v.57, n6, November–December 1969, pp. 104–113.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also the name of an exhibition that originated in the Aldrich Museum and traveled to the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] and other museums throughout the United States between 1969 and 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Lyrical Abstraction, Exhibition Catalogue, the Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, Ridgefield, Connecticut 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; Lyrical Abstraction is a type of freewheeling abstract painting that emerged in the mid-1960s when abstract painters returned to various forms of painterly, pictorial, expressionism with a predominate focus on process, gestalt and repetitive compositional strategies in general.&lt;ref&gt;The Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, ''Lyrical Abstraction,'' exhibition: 5 April through 7 June 1970&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Lyrical Abstraction'' Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, 25 May – 6 July 1971&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to Action Painting, where emphasis is on brushstrokes and high compositional drama, in Lyrical Abstraction—as exemplified by the 1971 [[Ronnie Landfield]] painting ''Garden of Delight''—there is a sense of compositional randomness, relaxed compositional drama and an emphasis on process, repetition, and an all over sensibility. Lyrical Abstraction in the late 1960s is characterized by the paintings of [[Dan Christensen]], Ronnie Landfield, [[Peter Young (artist)|Peter Young]] and others, and along with the [[Fluxus]] movement and [[Postminimalism]] (a term first coined by Robert Pincus-Witten in the pages of [[Artforum]] in 1969)&lt;ref name="Shakers, New York 2007"&gt;''Movers and Shakers, New York'', "Leaving C&amp;M", by Sarah Douglas, Art and Auction, March 2007, V.XXXNo7.&lt;/ref&gt;  sought to expand the boundaries of abstract painting and Minimalism by focusing on process, new materials and new ways of expression. Postminimalism often incorporating industrial materials, raw materials, fabrications, found objects, installation, serial repetition, and often with references to Dada and Surrealism is best exemplified in the sculptures of [[Eva Hesse]].&lt;ref name="Shakers, New York 2007" /&gt; Lyrical Abstraction, [[Conceptual Art]], Postminimalism, [[Earth Art]], Video, [[Performance art]], [[Installation art]], along with the continuation of Fluxus, Abstract Expressionism, Color Field painting, Hard-edge painting, Minimal Art, Op art, Pop art, [[Photorealism]] and [[New Realism]] extended the boundaries of [[Contemporary Art]] in the mid-1960s through the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Ann Ray, and Howard Junker.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[File:Ring of Ronald Davis.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Ronald Davis]], ''Ring'', 1968, [[Abstract Illusionism]]]]
One of the first artists specifically associated with Minimalism was [[Frank Stella]], whose early "stripe" paintings were highlighted in the 1959 show, "16 Americans", organized by Dorothy Miller at the [[Museum of Modern Art in New York]]. The widths of the stripes in Stella's stripe paintings were not entirely subjective, but were determined by the dimensions of the lumber used to construct the supportive chassis upon which the canvas was stretched. In the show catalog, [[Carl Andre]] noted, "Art excludes the unnecessary. Frank Stella has found it necessary to paint stripes. There is nothing else in his painting." These reductive works were in sharp contrast to the energy-filled and apparently emotionally charged paintings of [[Willem de Kooning]] or [[Franz Kline]] and leaned more toward less gestural coloristic field paintings of [[Barnett Newman]] and [[Mark Rothko]].

Artists such as [[Larry Poons]]—whose work related to Op Art with his emphasis on dots, ovals and after-images bouncing across color fields—[[Kenneth Noland]], Ralph Humphrey, [[Robert Motherwell]] and [[Robert Ryman]] had also begun to explore stripes, [[monochromatic]] and [[Hard-edge]] formats from the late 1950s through the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/384056/minimalism Britannica.com], "Minimalism"&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of a tendency in Minimalism to exclude the pictorial, illusionistic and fictive in favor of the literal—as demonstrated by [[Robert Mangold]], who understood the concept of the shape of the canvas and its relationship to ''objecthood''—there was a movement away from painterly and toward sculptural concerns. [[Donald Judd]] had started as a painter, and ended as a creator of objects. His seminal essay, "Specific Objects" (published in Arts Yearbook 8, 1965), was a touchstone of theory for the formation of Minimalist aesthetics. In this essay, Judd found a starting point for a new territory for American art, and a simultaneous rejection of residual inherited European artistic values.  He pointed to evidence of this development in the works of an array of artists active in New York at the time, including Jasper Johns, Dan Flavin and Lee Bontecou. Of "preliminary" importance for Judd was the work of [[George Earl Ortman]] [http://brooklynrail.org/2006/12/artseen/ortman], who had concretized and distilled painting's forms into blunt, tough, philosophically charged geometries. These Specific Objects inhabited a space not then comfortably classifiable as either painting or sculpture. That the categorical identity of such objects was itself in question, and that they avoided easy association with well-worn and over-familiar conventions, was a part of their value for Judd.

In a much more general sense, one might find European roots of Minimalism in the [[geometric abstraction]]s painters in the [[Bauhaus]], in the works of [[Piet Mondrian]] and other artists associated with the movement DeStijl, in [[Constructivism (art)|Russian Constructivists]] and in the work of the Romanian sculptor [[Constantin Brâncuși]]. American painters such as [[Brice Marden]] and [[Cy Twombly]] show a clear European influence in their ''pure'' abstraction, minimalist painting of the 1960s. Ronald Davis polyurethane works from the late 1960s pay homage to the ''Broken Glass'' of [[Marcel Duchamp]]''.
This movement was heavily criticised by high modernist formalist art critics and historians. Some anxious critics thought Minimalist art represented a misunderstanding of the modern dialectic of painting and sculpture as defined by critic [[Clement Greenberg]], arguably the dominant American critic of painting in the period leading up to the 1960s. The most notable critique of Minimalism was produced by [[Michael Fried (Art Critic)|Michael Fried]], a Greenbergian critic, who objected to the work on the basis of its "theatricality". In ''Art and Objecthood'' (published in Artforum in June 1967) he declared that the Minimalist work of art, particularly Minimalist sculpture, was based on an engagement with the physicality of the spectator. He argued that work like Robert Morris's transformed the act of viewing into a type of [[spectacle]], in which the artifice of the act [[observation]] and the viewer's participation in the work were unveiled. Fried saw this displacement of the viewer's experience from an aesthetic engagement within, to an event outside of the artwork as a failure of Minimal art.

[[Ad Reinhardt]], actually an artist of the [[Abstract Expressionist]] generation, but one whose [[reductionism|reductive]] all-black paintings seemed to anticipate minimalism, had this to say about the value of a reductive approach to art: "The more stuff in it, the busier the work of art, the worse it is. More is less. Less is more. The eye is a menace to clear sight. The laying bare of oneself is obscene. Art begins with the getting rid of nature."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artnews.com/2015/01/24/less-is-more-ad-reinhardts-twelve-rules-for-pure-art/ ''Less Is More: Ad Reinhardt's 12 Rules for Pure Art''], The Editors of ARTnews, 24 January 2015 (based on a paper read at the 45th annual meeting of the College Art Association at the Detroit Institute of Art, 26 January 1957)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s and 1970s artists as powerful and influential as [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Phillip Guston]], [[Lee Krasner]], [[Richard Diebenkorn]], [[Elmer Bischoff]], [[Agnes Martin]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Gene Davis (painter)|Gene Davis]], [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Friedel Dzubas]], and younger artists like [[Sam Gilliam]], [[Sean Scully]], [[Pat Steir]], [[Elizabeth Murray (artist)|Elizabeth Murray]], [[Walter Darby Bannard]], [[Dan Christensen]], Joan Snyder, [[Richard Tuttle]], [[Ross Bleckner]], [[Archie Rand]], [[Susan Crile]], and dozens of others produced vital and influential paintings.

Still other important innovations in abstract painting took place during the 1960s and the 1970s characterized by [[Monochrome painting]] and [[Hard-edge painting]] inspired by [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Milton Resnick]], and Ellsworth Kelly. Artists as diversified as [[Al Held]], [[Larry Zox]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Brice Marden]] and others explored the power of simplification. The convergence of [[Color Field]] painting, Minimal art, Hard-edge painting, Lyrical Abstraction, and Postminimalism blurred the distinction between movements that became more apparent in the 1980s and 1990s. The [[Neo-expressionism]] movement is related to earlier developments in Abstract expressionism, [[Neo-Dada]], Lyrical Abstraction and Postminimal painting.

====Neo-expressionism====
&lt;!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: DO NOT ADD YOUR OWN NAME TO THIS LIST! --&gt;
In the late 1960s the abstract expressionist painter [[Philip Guston]] helped to lead a transition from abstract expressionism to [[Neo-expressionism]] in painting, abandoning the so-called "pure abstraction" of abstract expressionism in favor of more cartoonish renderings of various personal symbols and objects. These works were inspirational to a new generation of painters interested in a revival of expressive imagery.&lt;ref name="Neo-Expressionism, The Art Story"&gt;[http://www.theartstory.org/movement-neo-expressionism.htm Neo-Expressionism, The Art Story]&lt;/ref&gt; His painting ''Painting, Smoking, Eating'' is an example of Guston's return to representation.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was also a return to painting that occurred almost simultaneously in Italy, Germany, France and [[UK|Britain]]. These movements were called [[Transavantguardia]], [[Neue Wilde]], [[Figuration Libre]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=188 |title=Tate online glossary |publisher=Tate.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neo-expressionism]], the school of London, and in the late 80s the [[Stuckists]] respectively. These painting were characterized by large formats, free expressive mark making, figuration, myth and imagination.  All work in this genre came to be labeled [[neo-expressionism]].

Neo-expressionism was a style of [[Modernism|modern]] painting that became popular in the late 1970s and dominated the art market until the mid-1980s. It developed in Europe as a reaction against the conceptual and [[minimalism|minimalistic]] art of the 1960s and 1970s. Neo-expressionists returned to portraying recognizable objects, such as the human body (although sometimes in a virtually abstract manner) in a rough and violently emotional way using vivid colors and banal color harmonies. The veteran painters Philip Guston, [[Frank Auerbach]], [[Leon Kossoff]], [[Gerhard Richter]], [[A. R. Penck]] and [[Georg Baselitz]], along with the slightly younger artists [[Damien Hirst]], [[Anselm Kiefer]], the Americans [[Eric Fischl]], [[Susan Rothenberg]], [[David Salle]], [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]], [[Julian Schnabel]], and [[Keith Haring]], the Italians [[Francesco Clemente]], [[Mimmo Paladino]], [[Sandro Chia]], and [[Enzo Cucchi]], and many others became known for working in this intense expressionist vein of painting. Critical reaction was divided. Some critics regarded it as driven by profit motivations by large commercial galleries.&lt;ref name="Neo-Expressionism, The Art Story"/&gt;

Anselm Kiefer is a leading figure in European Neo-expressionism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theartstory.org/artist-kiefer-anselm.htm The Art Story, Artist Anselm Kiefer]&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1980s, Kiefer's themes widened from a focus on Germany's role in civilization to the fate of art and culture in general. His work became more sculptural and involves not only national identity and [[collective memory]], but also [[occult]] symbolism, [[theology]] and [[mysticism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/anselm-kiefer-1406 Fiefer, Tate]&lt;/ref&gt; The theme of all the work is the trauma experienced by entire societies, and the continual rebirth and renewal in life.
&lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:Rothhorse2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Susan Rothenberg]], 1979, [[Neo-expressionism]]]] --&gt;

Painting still holds a respected position in [[contemporary art]]. Art is an open field no longer divided by the objective versus non-objective dichotomy. Artists can achieve critical success whether their images are representational or abstract. What has currency is content, exploring the boundaries of the medium, and a refusal to recapitulate the works of the past as an end goal.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Esmann, F. Scott Hess, ''21st Century Figurative Art: The Resurrection of Art'', BookBaby Print, Nov 5, 2016, {{ISBN|1483582590}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Hyman, ''The World New Made: Figurative Painting in the Twentieth Century'', Thames &amp; Hudson, 2016, {{ISBN|0500239452}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Paulson, ''Figure and abstraction in contemporary painting'', Rutgers University Press, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''wind farm''' or '''wind park''' is a group of [[wind turbine]]s in the same location used to produce electricity. A large wind farm may consist of several hundred individual wind turbines and cover an extended area of hundreds of square miles, but the land between the turbines may be used for agricultural or other purposes. A wind farm can also be located offshore.

Many of the largest operational onshore wind farms are located in China, India, and the United States. For example, the [[List of onshore wind farms|largest wind farm in the world]], [[Gansu Wind Farm]] in China has a capacity of over 6,000&amp;nbsp;[[megawatt|MW]] as of 2012,&lt;ref name="Guardian-2012.03.19"&gt;Watts, Jonathan &amp; Huang, Cecily.

Retrieved 4 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; with a goal of 20,000&amp;nbsp;MW by 2020. As of September 2018, the 659&amp;nbsp;MW [[Walney Wind Farm]] in the UK is [[List of offshore wind farms#Top 25 operational offshore wind farms|the largest offshore wind farm in the world]].&lt;ref name=guardianworldslargest&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/06/worlds-largest-offshore-windfarm-opens-cumbrian-coast-walney-extension-brexit|title=World's largest offshore wind farm opens off Cumbrian coast|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual wind turbine designs continue to increase in power, resulting in fewer turbines being needed for the same total output. See [[List of most powerful wind turbines|list of most powerful wind turbines]].

== Design and location ==
[[File:United States Wind Resources and Transmission Lines map.jpg|thumb|Map of available wind power over the United States. Color codes indicate wind power density class]]
The location is critical to the success of a wind farm. Conditions contributing to a successful wind farm location include: wind conditions, access to electric transmission, physical access, and local electric prices.

The faster the average windspeed the more electricity the wind turbine will generate, so faster winds are economically better for wind farm developers. The balancing factor is that strong gusts and high turbulence require stronger more expensive turbines, otherwise they risk damage. The ideal wind conditions would be strong steady winds with low turbulence coming from a single direction.

Usually sites are screened on the basis of a [[wind atlas]], and validated with wind measurements. [[Meteorology|Meteorological]] wind data alone is usually not sufficient for accurate siting of a large wind power project. Collection of site specific data for wind speed and direction is crucial to determining site potential&lt;ref name=eweaFact&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=W0dre8-5FAYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=da Wind energy-- the facts: a guide to the technology, economics and future of wind power] page 32 ''[[EWEA]]'' 2009.

The wind blows faster at higher altitudes because of the reduced influence of drag. The increase in velocity with altitude is most dramatic near the surface and is affected by topography, surface roughness, and upwind obstacles such as trees or buildings.

How closely to space the turbines together is a major factor in wind farm design. The closer the turbines are together the more the upwind turbines block wind from their neighbors. However spacing turbines far apart increases the costs of roads and cables, and raises the amount of land needed to install a specific capacity of turbines. As a result of these factors, turbine spacing varies by site. Generally speaking manufacturers require 3.5 times the rotor diameter of the turbine between turbines as a minimum. Closer spacing is possible depending on the turbine model, the conditions at the site, and how the site will be operated.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

[[wikt:onshore|Onshore]] turbine installations in hilly or mountainous regions tend to be on ridges generally three kilometres or more inland from the nearest shoreline. This is done to exploit the [[topographic acceleration]] as the wind accelerates over a ridge. The additional wind speeds gained in this way can increase energy produced because more wind goes through the turbines. The exact position of each turbine matters, because a difference of 30m could potentially double output. This careful placement is referred to as 'micro-siting'.

== Offshore installations ==
[[File:DanishWindTurbines.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Offshore wind turbines near [[Copenhagen]], Denmark.]]

Europe is the leader in offshore wind energy, with [[Vindeby Offshore Wind Farm|the first offshore wind farm (Vindeby)]] being installed in Denmark in 1991. As of 2010, there are 39 offshore wind farms in waters off Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom, with a combined operating capacity of 2,396 MW. More than 100 GW (or 100,000 MW) of offshore projects are proposed or under development in Europe. The [[European Wind Energy Association]] has set a target of 40 GW installed by 2020 and 150 GW by 2030.&lt;ref name=eesi2010&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eesi.org/files/offshore_wind_101310.pdf |title=Offshore Wind Energy |author=Environmental and Energy Study Institute |author-link=Environmental and Energy Study Institute |date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Asof|2017}}, The [[Walney Wind Farm]] in the United Kingdom is the largest offshore wind farm in the world at 659 [[Megawatt|MW]], followed by the [[London Array]] (630 MW) also in the UK.

Offshore wind turbines are less obtrusive than turbines on land, as their apparent size and noise is mitigated by distance. Because water has less surface roughness than land (especially deeper water), the average wind speed is usually considerably higher over open water. [[Capacity factor]]s (utilisation rates) are considerably higher than for onshore locations.&lt;ref name="Garvinel2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Garvine | first1 = Richard | last2 = Kempton | first2 = Willett | title = Assessing the wind field over the continental shelf as a resource for electric power | journal = Journal of Marine Research | year = 2008 | volume = 66 | issue = 6 | pages = 751–773 | issn = 0022-2402 | url = http://www.ceoe.udel.edu/windpower/docs/GarvineKemp-AssessingWind09.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 30 November 2009 | doi = 10.1357/002224008788064540 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110720083622/http://www.ceoe.udel.edu/windpower/docs/GarvineKemp-AssessingWind09.pdf | archivedate = 20 July 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, there were no offshore wind farms in the United States, but projects were under development in wind-rich areas of the East Coast, Great Lakes, and Pacific coast;&lt;ref name=eesi2010/&gt; and in late 2016 the [[Block Island Wind Farm]] was commissioned.

Installation and service / maintenance of off-shore wind farms are a specific challenge for technology and economic operation of a wind farm. {{asof|2015}}, there are 20 [[Jackup rig|jackup vessels]] for lifting components, but few can lift sizes above 5MW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tu.no/industri/skip/2016/01/15/slik-utstyres-de-norske-skipene-for-a-takle-nye-gigant-vindmoller|title=Slik utstyres de norske skipene for å takle nye gigant-vindmøller|author=Jannicke Nilsen|work=Tu.no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Service vessels have to be operated nearly 24/7 (availability higher than 80% of time) to get sufficient amortisation from the wind turbines.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Therefore, special fast service vehicles for installation (like Wind Turbine Shuttle) as well as for maintenance (including heave compensation and heave compensated working platforms to allow the service staff to enter the wind turbine also at difficult weather conditions) are required. So-called inertial and optical based Ship Stabilization and Motion Control systems (iSSMC) are used for that.

== Experimental and proposed wind farms ==
There exist also some wind farms which were mainly built for testing wind turbines. In such wind farms, there is usually from each type to be tested only a single wind turbine. Such farms have usually at least one meteorological tower. An example of an experimental wind farm is [[Østerild Wind Turbine Test Field]].

For some time, airborne wind farms have been discussed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/AWES_Farm_Density.pdf AWES Farm Density] ''Airborne Wind Energy Labs'', March 2014. Retrieved 20 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; An airborne wind farm is a group of airborne wind energy systems near to each other, connected to the grid in the same point.

An important limiting factor of wind power is [[intermittent power source|variable power]] generated by wind farms. In most locations the wind blows only part of the time, which means that there has to be back-up capacity of conventional generating capacity to cover periods that the wind is not blowing. To address this issue it has been proposed to create a "[[European super grid|supergrid]]" to connect national grids together&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/Energy/16595/|title=A Supergrid for Europe|work=MIT Technology Review|accessdate=28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; across [[western Europe]], ranging from Denmark across the southern [[North Sea]] to England and the [[Celtic Sea]] to Ireland, and further south to France and Spain especially in [[Higueruela]] which was for some time the biggest wind farm in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=David Cifuentes |last-author-amp=yes |author2=Víctor M. Rodríguez |url=http://www.sabuco.com/mci/essays01/2b/energy2.pdf |title=Renewable energy |page=11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203093335/http://www.sabuco.com/mci/essays01/2b/energy2.pdf |archive-date=2007-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is that by the time a [[low pressure area]] has moved away from Denmark to the [[Baltic Sea]] the next low appears off the coast of Ireland. Therefore, while it is true that the wind is not blowing everywhere all of the time, it will always be blowing somewhere.

===Pakistan===
[[File:Jhimpir Wind Farm 2012.jpg|thumb|Jhimpir Wind Farm]]
Pakistan has wind corridors in Jhimpir, Gharo and Keti Bundar in Sindh province and is currently developing wind power plants in Jhimpir and Mirpur Sakro (District Thatta). The government of Pakistan decided to develop wind power energy sources due to problems supplying energy to the southern coastal regions of Sindh and Balochistan.
The Zorlu Energy Putin Power Plant is the first wind power plant in Pakistan. The wind farm is being developed in Jhimpir, by Zorlu Energy Pakistan the local subsidiary of a Turkish company. The total cost of project is $136 million.[3] Completed in 2012, it has a total capacity of around 56MW.
Fauji Fertilizer Company Energy Limited, has build a 49.5 MW wind Energy Farm at Jhimpir. Contract of supply of mechanical design was awarded to Nordex and Descon Engineering Limited. Nordex a German wind turbine manufacturer. In the end of 2011 49.6 MW will be completed.Pakistani Govt. also has issued LOI of 100 MW Wind power plant to FFCEL. Pakistani Govt. has plans to achieve electric power up to 2500 MW by the end of 2015 from wind energy to bring down energy shortage.

Currently four wind farms are operational (Fauji Fertilizer 49.5 MW (subsidiary of Fauji Foundation), Three Gorges 49.5 MW, Zorlu Energy Pakistan 56 MW, Sapphire Wind Power Co Ltd 52.6 MW) and six are under construction phase ( Master Wind Energy Ltd 52.6 MW, Sachal Energy Development Ltd 49.5 MW, Yunus Energy Ltd 49.5 MW, Gul Energy 49.5 MW, Metro Energy 49.5 MW, Tapal Energy ) and expected to achieve COD in 2017.

In Gharo wind corridor, two wind farms (Foundation Energy 1 &amp; II each 49.5 MW) are operational while two wind farms Tenaga Generasi Ltd 49.5 MW and HydroChina Dawood Power Pvt Ltd 49.5 are under construction and expected to achieve COD in 2017.

According to a USAID report, Pakistan has the potential of producing 150,000 megawatts of wind energy, of which only the Sindh corridor can produce 40,000 megawatts.

===Philippines===
The Philippines has the first windfarm in Southeast Asia. Located Northern part of the countries' biggest island Luzon, alongside the seashore of [[Bangui, Ilocos Norte|Bangui]], [[Ilocos Norte]].

The wind farm uses 20 units of 70-metre (230&amp;nbsp;ft) high Vestas V82 1.65 MW wind turbines, arranged on a single row stretching along a nine-kilometer shoreline off Bangui Bay, facing the West Philippine Sea.

Phase I of the NorthWind power project in Bangui Bay consists of 15 wind turbines, each capable of producing electricity up to a maximum capacity of 1.65 MW, for a total of 24.75 MW. The 15 on-shore turbines are spaced 326 metres (1,070&amp;nbsp;ft) apart, each 70 metres (230&amp;nbsp;ft) high, with 41 metres (135&amp;nbsp;ft) long blades, with a rotor diameter of 82 metres (269&amp;nbsp;ft) and a wind swept area of 5,281 square metres (56,840 sq ft). Phase II, was completed on August 2008, and added 5 more wind turbines with the same capacity, and brought the total capacity to 33 MW. All 20 turbines describes a graceful arc reflecting the shoreline of Bangui Bay, facing the West Philippine Sea.

Adjacent municipalities of [[Burgos, Ilocos Norte|Burgos]] and [[Pagudpud]] followed with 50 and 27 wind turbines with a capacity of 3 MW each for a Total of 150 MW and 81 MW respectively.

Two other wind farms were built outside of Ilocos Norte, the [[Pililla Wind Farm]] in Rizal and the [[Mindoro Wind Farm]] near [[Puerto Galera]] in [[Oriental Mindoro]].

===Sri Lanka===

Sri Lanka has received funding from the Asian Development Bank amounting to $300 million to invest in renewable energies. From this funding as well as $80 million from the Sri Lankan Government and $60 million from France’s Agence Française de Développement, Sri Lanka is building two 100MW wind farms from 2017 due to be completed by late 2020 in Northern Sri Lanka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.lk/2014/07/16/adb-grants-300-m-to-boost-renewable-energy/|title=ADB grants $ 300 m to boost renewable energy|publisher=|accessdate=28 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518083210/http://www.ft.lk/2014/07/16/adb-grants-300-m-to-boost-renewable-energy/|archive-date=18 May 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the biggest factors inhibiting wind farm construction is human opposition. A study has shown&lt;ref&gt;Groth, Theresa M., and Christine A. Vogt. "Rural wind farm development: Social, environmental and economic features important to local residents." Renewable Energy 63.2014 (2013): 1-8. ScienceDirect. Web. 9 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; "turbine placement close to residents may heighten their uncertainty and concern of the wind turbines and overshadow any positive inclinations towards the development."

Wind farm development is affected by the emphasis being primarily placed on the domain of landscape assessment and environmental impact when seeking farm sites. The viability and efficiency of the wind farm are barely touched upon, instead falling to the developer. For example, Sturge et al.&lt;ref&gt;Sturge, D., A. While, and R. Howell. "Engineering and energy yield: The missing dimension of wind turbine assessment." Energy Policy 65.2014 (2013): 245-50. ScienceDirect. Web. 9 Feb. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; of the University of Sheffield wrote that in many countries where wind energy is becoming popular, engineering aspects, specifically energy yield are not being taken into consideration, either by the public or in the process of planning consent for wind farm development. As energy is the main purpose of wind farms, a lack of attention given to the subject could be detrimental to the general acceptance of wind farms.

The estimated number of bird deaths caused by wind turbines in the United States is between 140,000 and 328,000, whereas deaths caused by domestic cats in the United States are estimated to be between 1.3 and 4.0 billion birds each year and over 100 million birds are killed in the United States each year by impact with windows.&lt;ref name="Novella2016"/&gt;

=== Human health ===
{{See also|Health effects from noise}}
There have been multiple scientific, peer-reviewed studies into wind farm noise, which have concluded that infrasound from wind farms is not a hazard to human health and there is no verifiable evidence for 'Wind Turbine Syndrome' causing [[Vibroacoustic disease]], although some suggest further research might still be useful.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cleanenergycouncil.org.au/dam/cec/technologies/wind/fact-sheets/Wind-farms-and-health-fact-sheet-Jan-2015/Wind%20farms%20and%20health%20fact%20sheet%20-%20Jan%202015.pdf 'Wind Energy - The Facts', p. 1].&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2007 report by the U.S. National Research Council noted that noise produced by wind turbines is generally not a major concern for humans beyond a half-mile or so. Low-frequency vibration and its effects on humans are not well understood and sensitivity to such vibration resulting from wind-turbine noise is highly variable among humans.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} There are opposing views on this subject, and more research needs to be done on the effects of low-frequency noise on humans.&lt;ref name="NRC1"&gt;Committee on Environmental Impacts of Wind Energy Projects, National Research Council (2007). [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11935&amp;page=158 ''Environmental Impacts of Wind-Energy Projects'', p. 158-9].&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2009 report about "Rural Wind Farms", a Standing Committee of the Parliament of New South Wales, Australia, recommended a minimum setback of two kilometres between wind turbines and neighbouring houses (which can be waived by the affected neighbour) as a precautionary approach.&lt;ref name="NSW1"&gt;General Purpose Standing Committee No. 5, Parliament of New South Wales (16 December 2009). [http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/Prod/parlment/committee.nsf/0/ea247659081d31fdca25768e001a2e2a/$FILE/091216%20Report%20-%20Rural%20wind%20farms.pdf "Final Report, Rural Wind Farms"].&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 paper suggests that the 'Wind Turbine Syndrome' is mainly caused by the [[nocebo]] effect and other psychological mechanisms.&lt;ref name="Novella2016"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rubin|first1=GJ|last2=Burns|first2=M|last3=Wessely|first3=S|authorlink3=Simon Wessely|title=Possible psychological mechanisms for "wind turbine syndrome".

=== Effect on power grid ===
{{See also|Wind power#Electricity generation}}

Utility-scale wind farms must have access to transmission lines to transport energy. The wind farm developer may be obliged to install extra equipment or control systems in the wind farm to meet the technical standards set by the operator of a transmission line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BUFFALO GAP WIND FARM, L.L.C., BUFFALO GAP WIND FARM 2, L.L.C., AND BUFFALO GAP WIND FARM 3, L.L.C.'S APPEAL AND COMPLAINT OF ERCOT'S DECISION AND ACTION REGARDING PRR 830 AND MOTION FOR SUSPENSION OF ACTION|url=http://www.ercot.com/content/about/governance/legal/notices/37827_Buffalo_Gap_Wind_Farm_Appeal_Complaint_PRR_830.pdf|website=ERCOT.com|publisher=ERCOT|accessdate=3 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company or person that develops the wind farm can then sell the power on the grid through the transmission lines and ultimately chooses whether to hold on to the rights or sell the farm or parts of it to big business like GE, for example.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

=== Ground radar interference ===
[[File:NOAA windturbine-radar-interference.gif|thumb|Wind farm interference (in yellow circle) on radar map]]

Wind farms can interfere with ground [[radar]] systems used for [[military]], [[Weather radar|weather]] and [[air traffic control]]. The large, rapidly moving blades of the turbines can return signals to the radar that can be mistaken as an aircraft or weather pattern.&lt;ref name="noaaWR"&gt;[http://www.crh.noaa.gov/mkx/?n=windfarm Wind farm interference showing up on Doppler radar] ''[[National Weather Service]]''.

==== Effects ====
The level of interference is a function of the signal processors used within the radar, the speed of the aircraft and the relative orientation of wind turbines/aircraft with respect to the radar. An aircraft flying above the wind farm's turning blades could become impossible to detect because the blade tips can be moving at nearly aircraft velocity. Studies are currently being performed to determine the level of this interference and will be used in future site planning.&lt;ref name="gsnWR"&gt;{{cite web|last=Goodwin|first= Jacob|url= http://www.gsnmagazine.com/node/22124?c=airport_aviation_security |title=DHS asks Raytheon to study impact of wind turbines on radar systems|website=gsnmagazine.com|date= 3 January 2011|accessdate= 9 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Issues include masking (shadowing), clutter (noise), and signal alteration.&lt;ref name="wefWR"&gt;[http://www.wind-energy-the-facts.org/de/environment/chapter-2-environmental-impacts/ship-collisions-radars-and-radio-signals.html Radars and radio signals] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110407155949/http://www.wind-energy-the-facts.org/de/environment/chapter-2-environmental-impacts/ship-collisions-radars-and-radio-signals.html |date=7 April 2011 }} ''Wind Energy Facts''.

==== Mitigation ====
Permanent problem solving include a ''non-initiation window'' to hide the turbines while still tracking aircraft over the wind farm, and a similar method mitigates the false returns.&lt;ref name="stasysWR"&gt;P Jago, N Taylor.

=== Radio reception interference ===

There are also reports of negative effects on radio and television reception in wind farm communities.  Potential solutions include predictive interference modelling as a component of site selection.&lt;ref&gt;

Wind turbines can often cause terrestrial television interference when the direct path between television transmitter and receiver is blocked by terrain. Interference effects become significant when the reflected signal from the turbine blades approaches the strength of the direct unreflected signal. Reflected signals from the turbine blades can cause loss of picture, pixellation and disrupted sound. There is a common misunderstanding that digital TV signals will not be affected by turbines — in practice they are.

=== Agriculture ===
A 2010 study found that in the immediate vicinity of wind farms, the climate is cooler during the day and slightly warmer during the night than the surrounding areas due to the turbulence generated by the blades.&lt;ref name=agriwind1&gt;Roy, Somnath Baidya. [http://www.pnas.org/content/107/42/17899.abstract?sid=47909b69-b82f-49d4-97d9-debb5d1ff65b Impacts of wind farms on surface air temperatures] ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'', 4 October 2010. Retrieved 10 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In another study an analysis carried out on [[corn]] and [[soybean]] crops in the central areas of the United States noted that the microclimate generated by wind turbines improves crops as it prevents the late spring and early autumn frosts, and also reduces the action of pathogenic fungi that grow on the leaves. Even at the height of summer heat, the lowering of 2.5–3 degrees above the crops due to turbulence caused by the blades, can make a difference for the cultivation of corn.&lt;ref name=agriwind2&gt;Takle, Gene and Lundquist, Julie.
