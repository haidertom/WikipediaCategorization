{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Ad hoc'' hypothesis}}
[[File:Leprechaun ill artlibre jnl.png|thumb|200px|If someone wants to believe in [[leprechaun]]s, they can avoid ever being proven wrong by using ''ad hoc'' hypotheses (e.g., by adding "they are invisible", then "their motives are complex", and so on).&lt;ref name=Stanovich2007&gt;Stanovich, Keith E. (2007). How to Think Straight About Psychology. Boston: Pearson Education. Pages 19-33&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In [[science]] and [[philosophy]], an '''''ad hoc'' hypothesis''' is a [[hypothesis]] added to a [[theory]] in order to save it from being [[falsified]]. Often, ''ad hoc'' hypothesizing is employed to compensate for anomalies not anticipated by the theory in its unmodified form.

==In the scientific community==
Scientists are often [[Scientific skepticism|skeptical]] of theories that rely on frequent, unsupported adjustments to sustain them. This is because, if a theorist so chooses, there is no limit to the number of ''ad hoc'' hypotheses that they could add. Thus the theory becomes more and more complex, but is never falsified. This is often at a cost to the theory's [[predictive power]], however.&lt;ref name="Stanovich2007"/&gt; ''Ad hoc'' hypotheses are often characteristic of [[pseudoscientific]] subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, Robert T. "Ad hoc hypothesis." ''The Skeptic's Dictionary''. 22 Jun. 2008 &lt;http://skepdic.com/adhoc.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticisms===
====Embryos of falsifiable hypotheses and theories====
An ''ad hoc'' hypothesis is not necessarily incorrect; in some cases, a minor change to a theory was all that was necessary. For example, [[Albert Einstein]]'s addition of the [[cosmological constant]] to [[general relativity]] in order to allow a [[static universe]] was ''ad hoc''. Although he later referred to it as his "greatest blunder", it may correspond to theories of [[dark energy]].&lt;ref&gt;Texas A&amp;M University. "Einstein's Biggest Blunder? Dark Energy May Be Consistent With Cosmological Constant." ''ScienceDaily'' 28 November 2007. 22 June 2008 &lt;https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/11/071127142128.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mislabelling criticism of methodology as ad hoc====
The assumption that people are prone to make up ad hoc hypotheses to defend their world views is criticized by a number of [[history of science|historians of science]] and [[philosophy of science|philosophers of science]] as it can lead to allegations of any valid criticism being an attempt to justify a specific theory that is not there. Such allegations can stand in the way of important criticism of flawed methodologies, thus causing the flawed methods to remain in continued use, by allegations that anyone who point out flaws in the methods doing it to defend a purported worldview. The allegations are made [[falsifiability|unfalsifiable]] and unable to self-correct by explaining away any criticism of the allegations as [[Rationalization (psychology)|rationalization]] or [[self-deception]]. The problem includes [[false dichotomy|false dichotomies]] that claim that there is a face-off between two world views, missing the point that any number of hypotheses and theories make some predictions that incidentally happen to overlap with predictions made by other hypotheses or theories while also making some unique predictions (e.g. a partial incidental overlap but also key differences of predictions between the obsolete [[luminiferous aether]] theory and the modern [[vacuum energy]] theory that make the evidence that falsify the former fall outside the predictions made by the latter) which is often confused by "ad hoc" allegers with one hypothesis being a "justification" for another hypothesis with different predictions. False dichotomies cause not only allegations against hypotheses and theories but also against general remarks of flawed methodologies that suggest no specific hypotheses or theories that can dismiss remarks of technical errors in the equipment, remarks of statistical [[confirmation bias]]es that are due to institutional [[publication bias]] between "ordinary claims" and "extraordinary claims" rather than individual brains, remarks of biased searching for other explanations in some cases but not others that lead to false appearances of a phenomenon "really" existing in one group but not in another, and other types of methodological errors. By arguing that a diversity of hypotheses and theories until falsification enhances the possibility of one correct one being among them and surviving future falsification attempts, the distinction between "claimant" individuals and "non-claimant" institutions that is implicit in the concept of [[burden of proof (philosophy)|burden of proof]] is criticized for not being evidence-based and that the same empirical data can falsify many hypotheses and theories with overlapping predictions without the expensive separate testing of each hypothesis that is alleged when claiming that "most hypotheses must be ignored to save money".&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Agassi, Abraham Meidan (2016) "Beg to Differ: The Logic of Disputes and Argumentation"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Home (2013) "Science under Scrutiny: The Place of History and Philosophy of Science"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gaps in knowledge and unclear observations===
Naturally, some gaps in knowledge, and even some observations that contradict a theory, must be temporarily tolerated while research continues. To temper ''ad hoc'' hypothesizing in science, common practice includes [[Falsifiability#Falsificationism|falsificationism]] (somewhat in the philosophy of [[Occam's razor]]). Falsificationism means scientists become more likely to reject a theory as it becomes increasingly burdened by ignored contradicting observations, and by ''ad hoc'' hypotheses.

{{Hindu philosophy}}
'''Aikyam ''' ([[Sanskrit]]: ऐक्यम्) means – oneness, unity, harmony, unanimity, identity or sameness or identical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Practical Sanskrit-English dictionary|publisher=The Digital Dictionaries of South Asia|url= http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/search3advanced?dbname=apte&amp;query=aikyam&amp;matchtype=exact&amp;display=utf8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All thoughts of the [[Upanishads]] move around two fundamental ideas – [[Brahman]] and the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]]; as a rule these terms are used synonymously, there is no difference between these two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Philosophy of the Upanishads|author=paul Deussen|publisher=Cosimo Inc|pages=38,39|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k_Bea7AXHY4C&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=aikyam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YqXwU56xL4jIuATppoCwCQ&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBzge#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main theme of Vedantic teaching is identity of the individual and the Total (''jiva isvara aikyam''), that the self (''Atman'') and awareness ('' [[Chaitanya (consciousness)|Chaitanya]] '') are identical (''aikyam''). ''Aikyam'' means oneness or identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Be Free From Me: Vedanta Notes|author=paul Bahder|publisher=Vision Of Vedanta|page=398|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PdGwAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT398&amp;lpg=PT398&amp;dq=aikyam&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QqKexpc0-P&amp;sig=Q3CpsBRhFJbV-zHXno0HTTmhdu8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KqPwU7WyOMPHuASKjYCgDA&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=aikyam&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vedic purport==

The [[Vedas]] are part of oral tradition, therefore they are called '' [[Śruti]] '' (that which is heard), Upanishads, known as the Vedanta, are the destroyer of bondage. The oneness of the Individual Self and the Universal Self (''jīvātma paramātma aikyam'') is ''Śrutisara'', the ultimate purport of the Vedas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Extracting the Essence of the Sruti|author=Totakacarya|page=ix|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=j-eq605vuwUC&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=aikyam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_aPwU7O6JY-GuASqkIKQDA&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=aikyam&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the compound word – ''Brahman atman aikyam'', unity of the Brahman and the Atman, is described the fundamental dogma of the Vedanta system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Upanishads Vol.3|publisher=Sarup and Sons|page=217|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Mgwzp6-HTTIC&amp;pg=PA217&amp;dq=aikyam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YqXwU56xL4jIuATppoCwCQ&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwATge#v=onepage&amp;q=aikyam&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vedic]] [[Rishis]] tell us – सत्त्वानुरूपा सर्वस्य श्रद्धा भवति – that undoubtedly the faith of all men conforms to their mental constitution, they speak about the two Unmanifests – the one which transforms itself and causes other transformations, and the other one that supports the former it had projected with the intention of commencing creation, although there is no real difference between these two. Rishi [[Dirghatamas]] ([[Rig Veda]] I.163.4) prays to [[Agni]] thus:-
: त्रीणि त आहुर्दिवि बन्धनानि त्रीण्यप्सु त्रीण्यन्तः समुद्रे |
: उतेव मे वरुणश्च्छन्त्स्यर्वन्यत्रा त आहुः परमं जनित्रम् ||
: "The place of your origin or birth is the same as that of mine; if you are endowed with strength I too possess the same strength; O the bright one! If you so happen to exist in three states or forms (gross, subtle and causal) so does water (the finest divine aspects) and the earth (the gross supporting aspect) and all objects (the entire transformation of the First Cause) dispersed in space (as existing outside and within) have three forms, O learned one! if your birth and knowledge is divine so is mine. "

This unique awareness of Sameness which is actually the awareness of Oneness is the knowledge of Reality, the true knowledge of existence, gaining which knowledge the true seeker ceases to see difference in this vast world of "variety" which difference is seen only as so many names echoing and re-echoing persistently in one’s mind. Rishi Venobhargavah ([[Rig Veda]] IX.85.9) also speaks about the same knowledge of Oneness when he prays:-
: अधिद्यामस्थाद्वष्भो विचक्षणोऽरूरुचद्वि दिवो रोचना कविः |
: राजा पवित्रमत्येति रोरुवद्दिवः पीयूषं दुहते नृचक्षसः ||
and tells us about the stars and celestial luminaries dotting the sky shining because of the light of the self-effulgent [[Brahman]] shining brightly revealing everything and providing strength and stability (अधिद्यामस्थात्),who is pure and the source of amrita (पीयूषं) desired by the learned people (नृचक्षसः), who is the giver of happiness and who is the deliverer being the only source of immortality.201-203&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Illumination of Knowledge|author=Ravinder Kumar Soni|publisher=GBD Books|pages=201-203|url= https://www.amazon.in/Books-Ravinder-Kumar-Soni/s?ie=UTF8&amp;page=1&amp;rh=n%3A976389031%2Cp_27%3ARavinder%20Kumar%20Soni   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vedanta contention==

[[Vedantasara (of Sadananda)|Vedantasara]] explains that the subject (''visheya'') is the identity of the individual self and Brahman, which is of the nature of Pure Intelligence (wherein all ideas of separation and variety are effaced) and is to be realized – सर्वे वेदा यत् पदमामनन्ति – That goal which all the Vedas declare ([[Katha Upanishad]] I.ii.15), and that the connection (''sambandha'') is the relation between that identity which is to be realized and the evidence of the [[Upanishads]] that establishes it, as between a thing to be known and that which tells of it.p.16&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vedantasara|author=Sadananda|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|page=16|url= http://www.estudantedavedanta.net/Vedantasara-Nikhilananda.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
[[Adi Shankara|sankara]] states that the notion of a multitude of souls is valid only at the level of the empirical world. While the ''Atman'' stays within the limits of the body, emotions and intellect, there cannot be any dissolution, any absolute unity (''sarvarthā- aikyam'') with Brahman; the soul is only the reflection of the higher ''ātman''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Shankara and Indian Philosophy|author=N.V.Isaeva|publisher=SUNY Press|page=223|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=J43SDe9ilOsC&amp;pg=PA223&amp;dq=aikyam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YqXwU56xL4jIuATppoCwCQ&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAzge#v=onepage&amp;q=aikyam&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is only one reality. That about which the cognition does not change is ''sat'' – real and that about which cognition keeps changing or is negated is ''asat'' – unreal; the Atman or Brahman alone being unchangeable and un-negatable is the only ''sat'' or Reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jivesvara Aikyam|publisher=speaking tree.in|url= http://www.speakingtree.in/spiritual-blogs/masters/philosophy/jivesvara-aikyam }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objections==

According to [[Madhavacharya of Sringeri|Madhavacharya]], ''aikyam'' cannot be real at all; if it were, the absolutism would have vanished. The Absolute is the only reality, ''aikyam'' cannot be another reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reign of Realism in Indian Philosophy|author=R.Naga Raja Sarma|publisher=National Press|page=152|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4aZbAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=aikyam&amp;dq=aikyam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1aTwU5-5EJCXuATCvYC4DA&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwBDgK }}&lt;/ref&gt; And, [[Nagarjuna]] explains – if there were to be identity of cause and effect, then there would be oneness of producer and the produce; if there were to be difference between cause and effect, then the cause would be equal to a non-cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nagarjuna: The Philosophy of the Middle Path|publisher=SUNY Press|page=289|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0O6_coQ1odMC&amp;pg=PA289&amp;dq=aikyam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dqbwU9XHBMG-uASUuYGgDA&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwCTg8#v=onepage&amp;q=aikyam&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], some members of the [[United States military]] mutilated dead Japanese service personnel in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theater]] of operations. The mutilation of Japanese service personnel included the taking of body parts as "war souvenirs" and "[[war trophies]]". Teeth and [[human skull|skulls]] were the most commonly taken "trophies", although other body parts were also collected.

The phenomenon of "trophy-taking" was widespread enough that discussion of it featured prominently in magazines and newspapers, and [[Franklin Roosevelt]] himself was reportedly given, by U.S. Representative [[Francis E. Walter]], a gift of a letter-opener made of a Japanese soldier's arm (Roosevelt later ordered that the gift be returned and called for its proper burial).{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|p=65}}{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=825}} The behavior was officially prohibited by the U.S. military, which issued additional guidance as early as 1942 condemning it specifically.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=827}} Nonetheless, the behavior continued throughout the war in the Pacific Theater, and has resulted in continued discoveries of "trophy skulls" of Japanese [[combatants]] in American possession, as well as American and Japanese efforts to [[repatriate]] the remains of the Japanese dead.

==Trophy-taking==
[[File:AWM 072837.jpg|thumb|upright|PT-341, Alexishafen, New Guinea, April 30, 1944]]
A number of firsthand accounts, including those of American servicemen, attest to the taking of "trophies" from the corpses of Imperial Japanese troops in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]] during [[World War II]]. Historians have attributed the phenomenon to a campaign of dehumanization of the Japanese in the U.S. media, to various racist tropes latent in American society, to the depravity of warfare under desperate circumstances, to the inhuman cruelty of Imperial Japanese forces, lust for revenge, or any combination of those factors.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} The taking of so-called "trophies" was widespread enough that, by September 1942, the Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet ordered that "No part of the enemy's body may be used as a souvenir", and any American servicemen violating that principle would face "stern disciplinary action".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Fussell. ''Wartime: Understanding and Behavior in the Second World War''. 1990, page 117&lt;/ref&gt;

Trophy skulls are the most notorious of the souvenirs. Teeth, ears and other such body parts were occasionally modified, for example by writing on them or fashioning them into utilities or other artifacts.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=826}}

[[Eugene Sledge]] relates a few instances of fellow Marines extracting gold teeth from the Japanese, including one from an enemy soldier who was still alive.

&lt;blockquote&gt;But the Japanese wasn't dead. He had been wounded severely in the back and couldn't move his arms; otherwise he would have resisted to his last breath. The Japanese's mouth glowed with huge gold-crowned teeth, and his captor wanted them. He put the point of his [[Ka-Bar|kabar]] on the base of a tooth and hit the handle with the palm of his hand. Because the Japanese was kicking his feet and thrashing about, the knife point glanced off the tooth and sank deeply into the victim's mouth. The Marine cursed him and with a slash cut his cheeks open to each ear. He put his foot on the sufferer's lower jaw and tried again. Blood poured out of the soldier's mouth. He made a gurgling noise and thrashed wildly. I shouted, “Put the man out of his misery.” All I got for an answer was a cussing out. Another Marine ran up, put a bullet in the enemy soldier's brain, and ended his agony. The scavenger grumbled and continued extracting his prizes undisturbed.&lt;ref&gt;(''[[With the Old Breed|With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa]]''. p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[U.S. Marine]] veteran Donald Fall attributed the mutilation of enemy corpses to hatred and desire for vengeance:
&lt;blockquote&gt;On the second day of Guadalcanal we captured a big Jap bivouac with all kinds of beer and supplies&amp;nbsp;... But they also found a lot of pictures of Marines that had been cut up and mutilated [[Battle of Wake Island#War crimes|on Wake Island]]. The next thing you know there are Marines walking around with Jap ears stuck on their belts with safety pins. They issued an order reminding Marines that mutilation was a [[court-martial]] offense&amp;nbsp;... You get into a nasty frame of mind in combat. You see what's been done to you. You'd find a dead Marine that the Japs had booby-trapped. We found dead Japs that were booby-trapped. And they mutilated the dead. We began to get down to their level.{{sfn|Thayer|2004|p=186}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Skull and danger sign on Peleliu.jpg|right|thumb|Front line warning sign using a Japanese soldier's skull on [[Battle of Peleliu|Peleliu]] October 1944]]

Another example of mutilation was related by Ore Marion, a U.S. Marine who suggested,
&lt;blockquote&gt;We learned about savagery from the Japanese&amp;nbsp;... But those sixteen-to-nineteen-year old kids we had on the Canal were fast learners&amp;nbsp;... At daybreak, a couple of our kids, bearded, dirty, skinny from hunger, slightly wounded by bayonets, clothes worn and torn, wack off three Jap heads and jam them on poles facing the 'Jap side' of the river&amp;nbsp;... The colonel sees Jap heads on the poles and says, 'Jesus men, what are you doing? You're acting like animals.' A dirty, stinking young kid says, 'That's right Colonel, we are animals. We live like animals, we eat and are treated like animals–what the fuck do you expect?'{{sfn|Thayer|2004|p=186}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On February 1, 1943, ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine published a photograph taken by [[Ralph Morse]] during the [[Guadalcanal campaign]] showing a severed Japanese head that U.S. Marines had propped up below the gun turret of a tank. ''Life'' received letters of protest from people "in disbelief that American soldiers were capable of such brutality toward the enemy." The editors responded that "war is unpleasant, cruel, and inhuman. And it is more dangerous to forget this than to be shocked by reminders." However, the image of the severed head generated less than half the amount of protest letters that an image of a mistreated cat in the very same issue received.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://greyfalcon.us/restored/War.htm War, Journalism, and Propaganda]"&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, Morse recounted that when his platoon came upon the tank with the head mounted on it, the sergeant warned his men not to approach it as it might have been set up by the Japanese in order to lure them in for a look. He feared that the Japanese might have a mortar tube zeroed in on it. Morse recalled the scene in this way, "'Everybody stay away from there,' the sergeant says, then he turns to me. 'You,' he says, 'go take your picture if you have to, then get out, quick.' So I went over, got my pictures and ran like hell back to where the patrol had stopped."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/3518085/life-behind-the-picture-skull-on-a-tank-guadalcanal-1942/|title=Guadalcanal: Rare and Classic Photos From a Pivotal WWII Campaign|author=Ben Cosgrove|date=Feb 19, 2014|work=TIME.com|accessdate=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1943, the U.S. High Command expressed alarm over recent newspaper articles, for example one where a soldier made a string of beads using Japanese teeth, and another about a soldier with pictures showing the steps in preparing a skull, involving cooking and scraping of the Japanese heads.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=827}}

In 1944, the American poet [[Winfield Townley Scott]] was working as a reporter in [[Rhode Island]] when a sailor displayed his skull trophy in the newspaper office. This led to the poem ''The U.S. sailor with the Japanese skull'', which described one method for preparation of skulls (the head is skinned, towed in a net behind a ship to clean and polish it, and in the end scrubbed with [[caustic soda]]).{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=822}}

[[Charles Lindbergh]] refers in his diary entries to several instances of mutilations. For example, in the entry for August 14, 1944, he notes a conversation he had with a Marine officer, who claimed that he had seen many Japanese corpses with an ear or nose cut off.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=827}} In the case of the skulls however, most were not collected from freshly killed Japanese; most came from already partially or fully skeletonised Japanese bodies.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=827}} Lindbergh also noted in his diary his experiences from an air base in New Guinea, where according to him the troops killed the remaining Japanese stragglers "as a sort of hobby" and often used their leg-bones to carve utilities.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=826}}

[[Moros during World War II|Moro Muslim guerillas on Mindanao fought against Japan in World War II]]. The [[Moro people|Moro Muslim]] [[Datu]] Pino sliced the ears off Japanese soldiers and cashed them in with the American guerilla leader  [[Wendell Fertig|Colonel Fertig]] at the exchange rate of a pair of ears for one bullet and 20 centavos.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iI_WAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=pino+centavos+bullet+japanese+ears Keats 1990], p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=G8p3AAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=pino+centavos+bullet+japanese+ears McClintock 1992], p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=nL5BwIi7TJ0C&amp;pg=PA130&amp;dq=pino+centavos+bullet+japanese+ears Tucci 2009], p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extent of practice===
According to Weingartner it is not possible to determine the percentage of U.S. troops that collected Japanese body parts, "but it is clear that the practice was not uncommon".{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|p=56}} According to Harrison only a minority of U.S. troops collected Japanese body parts as trophies, but "their behaviour reflected attitudes which were very widely shared".{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=827}}{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|p=56}} According to Dower, most U.S. combatants in the Pacific did not engage in "souvenir hunting" for bodyparts.{{sfn|Dower|1986|p=66}} The majority had some knowledge that these practices were occurring, however, and "accepted them as inevitable under the circumstances".{{sfn|Dower|1986|p=66}} The incidence of soldiers collecting Japanese body parts occurred on "a scale large enough to concern the Allied military authorities throughout the conflict and was widely reported and commented on in the American and Japanese wartime press".{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=818}} The degree of acceptance of the practice varied between units. Taking of teeth was generally accepted by [[enlisted men]] and also by officers, while acceptance for taking other body parts varied greatly.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=827}} In the experience of one serviceman turned author, Weinstein, ownership of skulls and teeth were widespread practices.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|pp=822, 823}}

When interviewed by researchers former servicemen have related to the practice of taking gold teeth from the dead – and sometimes also from the living – as having been widespread.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jun/03/humanities.highereducation Film exposes Allies' Pacific war atrocities Horrific footage shot during battle with Japanese shows execution of wounded and bayoneting of corpses.] Jason Burke The Observer, Sunday June 3, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some disagreement between historians over what the more common forms of '[[War trophy|trophy hunting]]' undertaken by U.S. personnel were. [[John W. Dower]] states that ears were the most common form of trophy that was taken, and skulls and bones were less commonly collected. In particular he states that "skulls were not popular trophies" as they were difficult to carry and the process for removing the flesh was offensive.{{sfn|Dower|1986|p=65}} This view is supported by Simon Harrison.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=827}} In contrast, [[Niall Ferguson]] states that "boiling the flesh off enemy [Japanese] skulls to make souvenirs was not an uncommon practice. Ears, bones and teeth were also collected".{{sfn|Ferguson|2007|p=546}}

The collection of Japanese body parts began quite early in the campaign, prompting a September 1942 order for disciplinary action against such souvenir taking.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=827}} Harrison concludes that since this was the first real opportunity to take such items (the [[Battle of Guadalcanal]]), "Clearly, the collection of body parts on a scale large enough to concern the military authorities had started as soon as the first living or dead Japanese bodies were encountered."{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=827}} When Charles Lindbergh passed through customs at Hawaii in 1944, one of the customs declarations he was asked to make was whether or not he was carrying any bones. He was told after expressing some shock at the question that it had become a routine point.{{sfn|Dower|1986|p=71}} This was because of the large number of souvenir bones discovered in customs, also including “green” (uncured) skulls.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=828}}

In 1984, Japanese soldiers' remains were repatriated from the [[Mariana Islands]]. Roughly 60 percent were missing their skulls.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=828}} Likewise it has been reported that many of the Japanese remains on [[Iwo Jima]] are missing their skulls.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=828}} It is possible that the souvenir collection of remains continued also in the immediate post-war period.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=828}}

===Context===
According to Simon Harrison, all of the "trophy skulls" from the World War II era in the forensic record in the U.S., attributable to an ethnicity, are of Japanese origin; none come from Europe{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=826}} (a seemingly rare exception to this rule was the case of a German soldier scalped by an American soldier, falsely attributed to a [[Ho-Chunk|Winnebago]] tribal custom.&lt;ref&gt;"The taking and displaying of human body parts as trophies by Amerindians", Chacon and Dye, page 625 {{ISBN|9780387483030}}&lt;/ref&gt; Films shot by the Special Film Project 186&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ch_Amy0YGI Chasing Hitler] YouTube&lt;/ref&gt; near Prague, Czechoslovakia, on May 8, 1945, display an M4 Sherman with a skull and bones fixed to it&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ushmm.org/online/film/display/detail.php?file_num=4686|title=LIBERATED CZECHOSLOVAKIA; WOUNDED AND DEAD GERMANS; POWS|publisher=Steven Spielberg Film and Video Archive|accessdate=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Skulls from World War II, and also from the [[Vietnam War]], continue turning up in the U.S., sometimes returned by former servicemen or their relatives, or discovered by police. According to Harrison, contrary to the situation in average head-hunting societies, the trophies do not fit in American society. While the taking of the objects was socially accepted at the time, after the war, when the Japanese in time became seen as fully human again, the objects for the most part became seen as unacceptable and unsuitable for display. Therefore, in time they and the practice that had generated them were largely forgotten.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=828}}

Australian soldiers also mutilated Japanese bodies at times, most commonly by taking gold teeth from corpses.{{sfn|Johnston|2000|p=82}} This was officially discouraged by the [[Australian Army]].{{sfn|Johnston|2000|p=82}} Johnston states that "one could argue that greed rather than hatred was the motive" for this behavior, but "utter contempt for the enemy was also present".{{sfn|Johnston|2000|p=82}} Australians are also known to have taken gold teeth from German corpses, "but the practice was obviously more common in the South-West Pacific".{{sfn|Johnston|2000|p=82}} "The vast majority of Australians clearly found such behaviour abhorrent, but "some of the soldiers who engaged in it were not 'hard cases'.{{sfn|Johnston|2000|p=82}} According to Johnston, Australian soldiers' "unusually murderous behavior" towards their Japanese opponents (such as killing prisoners) was caused by racism, a lack of understanding of Japanese military culture and, most significantly, a desire to take revenge against the murder and mutilation of Australian prisoners and native New Guineans during the [[Battle of Milne Bay]] and subsequent battles.{{sfn|Johnston|2000|pp=81–100}}

From the [[Burma Campaign]], there are recorded instances of British troops removing gold teeth and displaying Japanese skulls as trophies.&lt;ref&gt;T. R. Moreman "The jungle, the Japanese and the British Commonwealth armies at war, 1941–45", p. 205&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motives==

===Dehumanization===
[[File:Alaska Death Trap.jpg|thumb|upright|U.S. government propaganda poster from WWII featuring a Japanese soldier depicted as a rat&lt;/small&gt;]]
In the U.S., there was a widely propagated view that the Japanese were subhuman.{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|p=67}}{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|p=54}} There was also popular anger in the U.S. at the Japanese [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|surprise attack on Pearl Harbor]], amplifying pre-war racial prejudices.{{sfn|Ferguson|2007|p=546}} The U.S. media helped propagate this view of the Japanese, for example describing them as "yellow vermin".{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|p=54}} In an official [[U.S. Navy]] film, Japanese troops were described as "living, snarling rats".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weingartner|1992|p=54}} Japanese were alternatively described and depicted as "mad dogs", "yellow vermin", termites, apes, monkeys, insects, reptiles and bats etc.&lt;/ref&gt; The mixture of underlying [[American racism]], which was added to by [[American propaganda during World War II#Anti-Japanese|U.S. wartime propaganda]], hatred caused by the Japanese [[war of aggression]], and both real and also fabricated [[Japanese war crimes|Japanese atrocities]], led to a general loathing of the Japanese.{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|p=54}} Although there were objections to the mutilation from among other military jurists, "to many Americans the Japanese adversary was no more than an animal, and abuse of his remains carried with it no [[Social stigma|moral stigma]].{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|pp=66, 67}}

According to [[Niall Ferguson]]: "To the historian who has specialized in German history, this is one of the most troubling aspects of the Second World War: the fact that Allied troops often regarded the Japanese in the same way that Germans regarded Russians&amp;nbsp;— as ''[[Untermensch]]en''."{{sfn|Ferguson|2007|p=182}} Since the Japanese were regarded as animals, it is not surprising that Japanese remains were treated in the same way as animal remains.{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|p=54}}

Simon Harrison comes to the conclusion in his paper, "Skull trophies of the Pacific War: transgressive objects of remembrance", that the minority of U.S. personnel who collected Japanese skulls did so because they came from a society that placed much value in hunting as a symbol of masculinity, combined with a de-humanization of the enemy.

War correspondent [[Ernie Pyle]], on a trip to Saipan after the [[Battle of Saipan|invasion]], claimed that the men who actually fought the Japanese did not subscribe to the wartime propaganda: "Soldiers and Marines have told me stories by the dozen about how tough the Japs are, yet how dumb they are; how illogical and yet how uncannily smart at times; how easy to rout when disorganized, yet how brave&amp;nbsp;... As far as I can see, our men are no more afraid of the Japs than they are of the Germans. They are afraid of them as a modern soldier is afraid of his foe, but not because they are slippery or rat-like, but simply because they have weapons and fire them like good, tough soldiers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediaschool.indiana.edu/erniepyle/1945/02/26/the-illogical-japs/|title=The Illogical Japs|author=Ernie Pyle|publisher=Rocky Mountain News|date=February 26, 1945|accessdate=17 October 2016|via=Indiana University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brutalization===
Some writers and veterans state that body parts trophy and souvenir taking was a side effect of the brutalizing effects of a harsh campaign.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=823}}

Harrison argues that, while brutalization could explain part of the mutilations, this explanation does not explain servicemen who, even before shipping off for the Pacific, proclaimed their intention to acquire such objects.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=824}} According to Harrison, it also does not explain the many cases of servicemen collecting the objects as gifts for people back home.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=824}} Harrison concludes that there is no evidence that the average serviceman collecting this type of souvenirs was suffering from "[[combat fatigue]]". They were normal men who felt this was what their loved ones wanted them to collect for them.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=825}} Skulls were sometimes also collected as souvenirs by non-combat personnel.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=823}}

A young Marine recruit, who had arrived on [[Battle of Saipan|Saipan]] with his buddy Al in 1944, after the island was secure, provides an eyewitness account. After a brief firefight the night before, he and a small group of other Marines find the body of a straggler who had apparently shot himself:

:"I would have guessed that the dead Japanese was only about fourteen years old and there he lay dead. My thoughts turned to some mother back in Japan who would receive word that her son had been killed in battle. Then one of the Marines, who I found out later had been through other campaigns, reached over and roughly grabbed the Japanese soldier by the belt and ripped his shirt off. Somebody said, 'What are you looking for?' And he said, 'I'm looking for a money belt. Japs always carry money belts.' Well, this Jap didn't. Another Marine veteran of combat saw that the dead soldier had some gold teeth, so he took the butt of his rifle and banged him on the jaw, hoping to extract the gold teeth. Whether he did or not I don't know, because at that point I turned around and walked away. I went over to where I thought no one would see me and sat down. Although my eyes were dry, inside my heart was wrenching, not at seeing the dead soldier, but at seeing the way some of my comrades had treated that dead body. That bothered me a great deal. Pretty soon Al came over and sat down beside me and put his arm around my shoulder. He knew what I was feeling. When I turned to look at Al he had tears running down his face."&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Petty, ''Saipan: Oral Histories of the Pacific War'', McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., 2002, {{ISBN|0-7864-0991-6}}, p 119&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revenge===
[[File:Anti-Japan2.png|thumb|upright|News of the [[Bataan Death March]] sparked outrage in the US, as shown by this propaganda poster]]

Bergerud writes that U.S. troops hostility towards their Japanese opponents largely arose from incidents in which Japanese soldiers committed war crimes against Americans, such as the [[Bataan Death March]] and other incidents conducted by individual soldiers. For instance, Bergerud states that the U.S. Marines on Guadacanal were aware that the Japanese had beheaded some of the Marines captured on [[Wake Island]] prior to the start of the campaign. However this type of knowledge did not necessarily lead to revenge mutilations; one Marine states that they falsely thought the Japanese had not taken any prisoners at Wake Island, and therefore as revenge they killed all Japanese that tried to surrender.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Coleman Jersey "Hell's islands: the untold story of Guadalcanal", p. 169, 170&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[Allied war crimes during World War II#Asia and the Pacific War|Allied war crimes during World War II]])

According to one Marine, the earliest account of U.S. troops wearing ears from Japanese corpses he recounts took place on the second day of the [[Guadalcanal Campaign]] in August 1942 and occurred after photos of the mutilated bodies of Marines on Wake Island were found in Japanese engineers' personal effects. The account of the same Marine also states that Japanese troops booby-trapped some of their own dead as well as some dead Marines, and also mutilated corpses; the effect on Marines being "We began to get down to their level".{{sfn|Thayer|2004|p=186}} According to Bradley A. Thayer, referring to Bergerud and interviews conducted by Bergerud, the behaviors of American and Australian soldiers were affected by "intense fear, coupled with a powerful lust for revenge".{{sfn|Thayer|2004|p=185}}

Weingartner writes however that U.S. Marines were intent on taking [[gold teeth]] and making keepsakes of Japanese ears already while en route to Guadalcanal.{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|p=556}}

===Souvenirs and bartering===
Factors relevant to the collection of body parts were their economic value, the desire both of the "folks back home" for a souvenir and of the servicemen themselves to have a keepsake when they returned home.

Some of the collected souvenir bones were modified, e.g. turned into letter-openers, and may be an extension of [[trench art]].{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=826}}

Pictures showing the "cooking and scraping" of Japanese heads may have formed part of the large set of Guadalcanal photographs sold to sailors which were circulating on the U.S. West-coast.{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|pp=56, 57}} According to Paul Fussel, pictures showing this type of activity, i.e. boiling human heads; "were taken (and preserved for a lifetime) because the Marines were proud of their success".{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=822}}

According to Weingartner, some of the U.S. Marines who were about to take part in the [[Guadalcanal Campaign]] were already while en route looking forward to collecting Japanese gold teeth for necklaces and to preserving Japanese ears as souvenirs.{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|p=56}}

In many cases (and unexplainable by battlefield conditions) the collected body parts were not for the use of the collector but were instead meant to be gifts to family and friends at home,{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=824}} in some cases as the result of specific requests from home.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=824}} Newspapers reported of cases such as a mother requesting permission for her son to send her an ear or a bribed chaplain that was promised by an underage youth "the third pair of ears he collected".{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=824}} A better-known example of those servicemen who left for battle already planning to send home a trophy is the ''Life Magazine'' picture of the week, whose caption begins:
:"When he said goodbye two years ago to Natalie Nickerson, 20, a war worker of Phoenix, Ariz., a big, handsome Navy lieutenant promised her a Jap. Last week Natalie received a human skull, autographed by her lieutenant and 13 friends ..."{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=824}}

Another example of this type of press is ''[[Yank, the Army Weekly|Yank]]'', that in early 1943 published a cartoon showing the parents of a soldier receiving a pair of ears from their son.{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|pp=56, 57}} In 1942 [[Alan Lomax]] recorded a blues song where a black soldier promises to send his child a Japanese skull, and a tooth.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=824}} Harrison also makes note of the Congressman that gave President Roosevelt a letter-opener carved out of bone as examples of the social range of these attitudes.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=825}}
[[File:Pacific war.jpg|thumb|Skull stewing-Pacific War]]
Trade sometimes occurred with the items, such as "members of the Naval Construction Battalions stationed on Guadalcanal selling Japanese skulls to merchant seamen" as reported in an Allied intelligence report from early 1944.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=823}} Sometimes teeth (particularly the less common gold teeth) were also seen as a trade-able commodity.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=823}}

==U.S. reaction==
"Stern disciplinary action" against human remains souvenir taking was ordered by the Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Fleet as early as September 1942.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=827}} In October 1943 General [[George C. Marshall]] radioed General [[Douglas MacArthur]] about "his concern over current reports of atrocities committed by American soldiers".{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|p=57}} In January 1944 the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] issued a directive against the taking of Japanese body parts.{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|p=57}} Simon Harrison writes that directives of this type may have been effective in some areas, "but they seem to have been implemented only partially and unevenly by local commanders".{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=827}}
[[File:LIFE May 1944 Jap Skull.jpg|thumb|upright|May 22, 1944 ''[[Life (magazine)|Life Magazine]]'' Picture of the Week, "Arizona war worker writes her Navy boyfriend a thank-you-note for the Jap skull he sent her"]]

On May 22, 1944, ''[[Life (magazine)|Life Magazine]]'' published a photo&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |date=May 22, 1944 |author1=Inc, Time |title=Picture of the Week |magazine=[[Life (magazine)|Life]] |page=35 |issn=0024-3019 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bk8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA35 |accessdate=August 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; of an American girl with a Japanese skull sent to her by her naval officer boyfriend.&lt;ref&gt;The image depicts a young blond at a desk gazing at a skull. The caption says: "When he said goodbye two years ago to Natalie Nickerson, 20, a war worker of Phoenix, Ariz., a big, handsome Navy lieutenant promised her a Jap. Last week Natalie received a human skull, autographed by her lieutenant and 13 friends, and inscribed: "This is a good Jap&amp;nbsp;– a dead one picked up on the New Guinea beach." Natalie, surprised at the gift, named it [[Hideki Tojo|Tojo]]. The armed forces disapprove strongly of this sort of thing.&lt;/ref&gt; The letters ''Life'' received from its readers in response to this photo were "overwhelmingly condemnatory"{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|p=58}} and the Army directed its Bureau of Public Relations to inform U.S. publishers that "the publication of such stories would be likely to encourage the enemy to take reprisals against American dead and prisoners of war".{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|p=60}} The junior officer who had sent the skull was also traced and officially reprimanded.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=825}} This was done reluctantly however, and the punishment was not severe.{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|pp=65, 66}}

The ''Life'' photo also led to the U.S. Military taking further action against the mutilation of Japanese corpses. In a memorandum dated June 13, 1944, the Army [[Judge Advocate General's Corps|JAG]] asserted that "such atrocious and brutal policies" in addition to being repugnant also were violations of the laws of war, and recommended the distribution to all commanders of a directive pointing out that "the maltreatment of enemy war dead was a blatant violation of the [[Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armies in the Field (1929)|1929 Geneva Convention on the Sick and Wounded]], which provided that: After each engagement, the occupant of the field of battle shall take measures to search for the wounded and dead, and to protect them against pillage and maltreatment." Such practices were in addition also in violation of the unwritten customary rules of land warfare and could lead to the death penalty.{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|p=59}} The Navy JAG mirrored that opinion one week later, and also added that "the atrocious conduct of which some U.S. servicemen were guilty could lead to retaliation by the Japanese which would be justified under international law".{{sfn|Weingartner|1992|p=59}}

On June 13, 1944, the press reported that President Roosevelt had been presented with a letter-opener made out of a Japanese soldier's arm bone by [[Francis E. Walter]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] congressman.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=825}} Supposedly, the president commented, "This is the sort of gift I like to get", and "There'll be plenty more such gifts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1908&amp;dat=19440613&amp;id=WPgoAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6tQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2176,4582411|title=Jones-Clayton Forces Behind Texas Revolt|work=The ''Nevada Daily Mail''|date=Jun 13, 1944|author=Drew Pearson|department=THE WASHINGTON MERRY-GO-ROUND}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several weeks later it was reported that it had been given back with the explanation that the President did not want this type of object and recommended it be buried instead. In doing so, Roosevelt was acting in response to the concerns which had been expressed by the military authorities and some of the civilian population, including church leaders.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=825}}

In October 1944, the Right Rev. [[Henry St. George Tucker (bishop)|Henry St. George Tucker]], the [[List of presiding bishops in the Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America]], issued a statement which deplored "'isolated' acts of desecration with respect to the bodies of slain Japanese soldiers and appealed to American soldiers as a group to discourage such actions on the part of individuals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title=Tucker Deplores Desecration of Foe; Mutilation of Japanese Bodies Contrary to Spirit of Army, He Says of 'Isolated' Cases |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1944/10/14/archives/tucker-deplores-desecration-of-foe-mutilation-of-japanese-bodies.html|work= |publisher=The New York Times |date=October 14, 1944 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title=The Morals of Victory |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,932499,00.html?promoid=googlep |work= |publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=October 23, 1944 |accessdate=May 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Japanese reaction==
News that President Roosevelt had been given a bone letter-opener by a congressman was widely reported in Japan. The Americans were portrayed as "deranged, primitive, racist and inhuman". This reporting was compounded by the previous May 22, 1944, ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine picture of the week publication of a young woman with a skull trophy, which was reprinted in the Japanese media and presented as a symbol of American barbarism, causing national shock and outrage.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=833}}&lt;ref&gt;Dickey, Colin: ''Afterlives of the Saints''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edwin P. Hoyt]] in ''Japan's War: The Great Pacific Conflict'' argues that two U.S. media reports of Japanese skulls and bones being sent home were exploited by Japanese [[propaganda]] very effectively, and this coupled to the [[Shinto]] religion, which places much higher emotional value on the treatment of human remains, contributed to a preference to death over surrender and occupation, shown, for example, in the mass civilian suicides on Saipan and Okinawa after the Allied landings.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=833}}&lt;ref&gt;Hoyt (1987), pp. 357–361&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hoyt, "The thought of a Japanese soldier's skull becoming an American ashtray was as horrifying in Tokyo as the thought of an American prisoner used for bayonet practice was in New York."&lt;ref&gt;Hoyt (1987), pp. 358&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
Some historians argue that a similar pattern of Asian dehumanization persisted in the Korean and Vietnam Wars, even though, like World War II, Asians were on both sides of those wars. In Vietnam, the supposed "[[Mere Gook Rule]]" allowed soldiers to harm or kill South Vietnamese citizens with little fear of punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6q3vpJ3ePH4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=kill+anything+that+moves&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiY64a5-NvQAhUM7GMKHYEgAo4Q6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Kill Anything That Moves: The Real American War in Vietnam|last=Turse|first=Nick|date=2013-01-15|publisher=Macmillan|year=|isbn=9780805086911|location=|pages=50–51, 144, 191, 197, 226|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1971">'''Antinarcissism''' is a specific form of [[Narcissism|narcissistic]] character that, rather than [[Grandiosity|aggrandising]] the ego, restricts its scope without diminishing the amount of self-investment involved.

==Self-limitation==
[[Christopher Bollas]] introduced the concept of antinarcissism to describe a self-limiting kind of narcissist who refuse to develop themselves or use their talents,&lt;ref&gt;Tod Sloan, ''Damaged Life'' (2002) p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; so as to maintain their exaggerated sense of self-importance ''in defeat''.  "This anti-elaborative person 'stews in his own juice' and adamantly refuses to nurture himself".&lt;ref&gt;Bollas, quoted in N. Symington, ''Narcissism'' (2003) p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; The antinarcissist may preserve a hostile, even sadistic, core behind a self-effacing facade of care and consideration for others.&lt;ref&gt;A. Gratch, ''If Men could Talk'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[André Green (psychoanalyst)|André Green]] similarly wrote of antinarcissism as a negative narcissism that seeks self-destructively to abolish the ego.&lt;ref&gt;A. M. Cooper et al ed., ''Psychoanalysis on the Move'' () p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other formulations==
* [[Hélène Cixous]] saw as anti-narcissistic the female internalisation of the [[male gaze]] as an alien standard to live up to, as opposed to developing their own selves.&lt;ref&gt;L. Hart, ''Fatal Women'' (2005) p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Fritz Wittels]] earlier described as antinarcissistic the tendency of two lovers to lose themselves each in the other.&lt;ref&gt;F. WIttels, ''Sigmund Freud'' (2013[1923]) p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Neonazis-schwarzer block.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Autonomous Nationalists adopted [[black block|Black Bloc]] demonstration tactics from extreme-leftist antifascist groups]]
The phenomenon of the Autonome Nationalisten can be traced to "Freie Nationaliste" (Free Nationalists), "Freie Kräfte" (Free Forces) and "Freie Kameradschaften" (Free Comradeships) movements, which developed in the shadow of the Nationaldemokratische Partei Deutschlands (NPD) ([[National Democratic Party of Germany]]) since the late-1980s. The police crackdown on the far-right after re-unification and the wave of banning in the early 1990s ("Deutsche Alternative", "Nationalistische Front", "Freiheitliche Deutsche Arbeiterpartei", among others) forced most of the local extreme far-right militant groups to split into "autonomous nationalist cells" of 5-20 members without a formal membership. Instead of conducting regular meetings, they started to use phones and later Internet for communication and organizing.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Schedler.

The emergence of the Autonome Nationalisten was controversial within the [[Far right in Germany|German far right]] milieu, both because some older activists of the German extreme right objected to their "leftist" image and because the NPD feared they would complicate its efforts to take part in mainstream politics.&lt;ref name="mares"/&gt; Also controversial was that Autonome Nationalisten had occasionally expressed sympathy for [[Islamic extremism]], as well as [[Hezbollah]] and [[Hamas]] for their opposition to [[Zionism]] and what is deemed "[[American imperialism]]".&lt;ref name="doorbraak"&gt;[http://www.doorbraak.eu/gebladerte/11479f95.htm Autonome neo-nazi’s op de linkse toer?], ''Gebladerte Archief'' (Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt; The same controversies arose among the [[Far-right politics in Poland|far right in Poland]].

The Autonomous Nationalists in Europe made themselves visible starting from 2003–2004 and are now considered more violent than other members of the European far right.&lt;ref name="glet" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nicola"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/Special/2008/05/20/Germanys-new-neo-Nazis/UPI-87471211285700/|title=Germany's new neo-Nazis|last=Nicola|first=Stefan|date=20 May 2008|work=[[UPI]]|accessdate=26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as of 2010, according to Miroslav Mareš, their impact in these countries has been limited so far.&lt;ref name="mares"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mareš|first=Miroslav|date=25 March 2010|title=Transnational Activism of Extreme Right Youth in East Central Europe |journal=Paper (first draft) for the International Conference "Far right networks in Northern and  Eastern Europe”, Uppsala University, March 2010| url=|pages=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Message ==

Researchers view the [[Syncretic politics|syncretic political movement]] of the Autonomous Nationalists in Europe as a "strategic concept, organization and subculture – all three terms are possible for the designation of this phenomenon."&lt;ref name="mares" /&gt; They emphasize that, {{quote|autonomous nationalism as a political tendency certainly punches above its weight. It has influenced and sparked debates within the German far right, as well as within fascist youth movements in other European countries. As such it opens up questions over the future of fascist organisation in Europe, at a time when network politics appears to exert stronger mobilising factors than traditional organisational structures.&lt;ref name="New developments and contradictions in the German neo-Nazi movement" /&gt;{{rp|297}}}}

The Autonomous Nationalists were ideologically inspired by [[Strasserism]].&lt;ref name="mares" /&gt; The message of AN shifted to anti-globalist, anti-capitalist, and anti-imperialist ideas. It promotes complete organizational decentralization and autonomy inside the movement.&lt;ref&gt;Sommer, Bernd. Anti-capitalism in the name of ethno-nationalism: ideological shifts on the German extreme right, ''Patterns of Prejudice'', V. 42, No. 3 (2008): 305-316.&lt;/ref&gt;

The adoption of codes and symbols of the [[far left]] "Autonome Antifa"  by the "Autonome Nationalisten" coincided with the persistence of vibrant alternative subcultures of the radical left and rejection of traditional skinhead cultural-political templates of behavior of the extreme right.&lt;ref&gt;Von Rainer Brahms.

The term ''carnography''—a [[portmanteau]] of the words ''carnage'' and ''pornography''&lt;ref name="LaRocque"/&gt;—was used as early as 1972 in [[Time magazine|''Time'' magazine]]'s review of [[David Morrell]]'s book ''[[First Blood (novel)|First Blood]]'', upon which the [[Rambo (film series)|Rambo]] film series is based.&lt;ref name="Winter"&gt;{{cite book | last = Winter | first = Douglas E. | title = Faces of fear: encounters with the creators of modern horror | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=rC7YA9JYSMMC&amp;q=carnography&amp;dq=carnography&amp;pgis=1 | accessdate = 2009-04-15 | year = 1985 | publisher = Berkley Books | isbn = 0-425-07670-9 | page = 82 | quote = When ''First Blood'' was published in 1972, ''Time'' devoted its lead book review to accusing Morrell of inventing a new form of fiction – "carnography," the violent equivalent of pornography.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''chain reaction''' is a sequence of reactions where a reactive product or by-product causes additional reactions to take place. In a chain reaction, [[positive feedback]] leads to a self-amplifying [[chain of events]].

Chain reactions are one way that systems which are not in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] can release energy or increase entropy in order to reach a state of higher entropy. For example, a system may not be able to reach a lower energy state by releasing energy into the environment, because it is hindered or prevented in some way from taking the path that will result in the energy release. If a reaction results in a small energy release making way for more energy releases in an expanding chain, then the system will typically collapse explosively until much or all of the stored energy has been released. 

A macroscopic metaphor for chain reactions is thus a snowball causing a larger snowball until finally an avalanche results ("[[snowball effect]]"). This is a result of stored gravitational potential energy seeking a path of release over friction. Chemically, the equivalent to a snow avalanche is a spark causing a forest fire. In nuclear physics, a single stray neutron can result in a [[prompt critical]] event, which may finally be energetic enough for a nuclear reactor meltdown or (in a bomb) a nuclear explosion.

Numerous chain reactions can be represented by a [[mathematical model]] based on [[Markov chain]]s.

==Chemical chain reactions==
=== History ===
In 1913, the German chemist [[Max Bodenstein]] first put forth the idea of [[chemical]] chain reactions. If two molecules react, not only molecules of the final reaction products are formed, but also some unstable molecules which can further react with the parent molecules with a far larger probability than the initial reactants (In the new reaction, further unstable molecules are formed besides the stable products, and so on ..).

In 1918, [[Walther Nernst]] proposed that the [[photochemistry|photochemical]] reaction between [[hydrogen]] and [[chlorine]] is a chain reaction in order to explain what's known as the ''[[quantum yield]]'' phenomena. This means that one [[photon]] of light is responsible for the formation of as many as 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; molecules of the product [[HCl]]. Nernst suggested that the photon dissociates a Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule into two Cl atoms which each initiate a long chain of reaction steps forming HCl.&lt;ref name=Laidler288&gt;Laidler K.J., ''Chemical Kinetics'' (3rd ed., Harper &amp; Row 1987) p.288-290  {{ISBN|0-06-043862-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, Danish and Dutch scientists [[Christian Christiansen]] and [[Hendrik Anthony Kramers]], in an analysis of the formation of polymers, pointed out that such a chain reaction need not start with a molecule excited by light, but could also start with two molecules colliding violently due to thermal energy as previously proposed for initiation of chemical reactions by [[Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff|van' t Hoff]]. &lt;ref name=Nobel1956/&gt;

Christiansen and Kramers also noted that if, in one link of the reaction chain, two or more unstable [[molecules]] are produced, the reaction chain would branch and grow. The result is in fact an exponential growth, thus giving rise to explosive increases in reaction rates, and indeed to chemical explosions themselves. This was the first proposal for the mechanism of chemical explosions.

A quantitative chain chemical reaction theory was created later on by Soviet physicist [[Nikolay Semyonov]] in 1934. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marka-art.ru/catalogs/StampSeries.jsp?%26id%3D29264%26lang%3Den |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116032126/http://www.marka-art.ru/catalogs/StampSeries.jsp?&amp;id=29264&amp;lang=en |archivedate=2009-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Semyonov shared the Nobel Prize in 1956 with Sir [[Cyril Norman Hinshelwood]], who independently developed many of the same quantitative concepts. &lt;ref name=Nobel1956&gt;http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1956/press.html History of the chemical chain reaction from 1913 to the Nobel work recognized in 1956&lt;/ref&gt;

===Typical steps===
The main types of steps in chain reaction are of the following types.&lt;ref name=Laidler288/&gt;
* [[Chain initiation|Initiation]] (formation of [[Active center (polymer science)|active particles]] or chain carriers, often [[free radical]]s, in either a thermal or a photochemical step)
* [[Chain propagation|Propagation]] (may comprise several elementary steps in a cycle, where the active particle through reaction forms another active particle which continues the reaction chain by entering the next elementary step). In effect the active particle serves as a catalyst for the overall reaction of the propagation cycle. Particular cases are:
:: * chain branching (a propagation step which forms more new active particles than enter the step);
:: * [[chain transfer]] (a propagation step in which the active particle is a growing [[polymer]] chain which reacts to form an inactive polymer whose growth is terminated and an active small particle (such as a radical), which may then react to form a new polymer chain).
* [[Chain termination|Termination]] (elementary step in which the active particle loses its activity; e. g. by [[Recombination (chemistry)|recombination]] of two free radicals).

The ''chain length'' is defined as the average number of times the propagation cycle is repeated, and equals the overall reaction rate divided by the initiation rate.&lt;ref name=Laidler288/&gt;

Some chain reactions have complex [[rate equation]]s with [[Order of reaction#Fractional order|fractional order]] or [[Order of reaction#Mixed order|mixed order]] kinetics.

=== Detailed example: the hydrogen-bromine reaction ===
The reaction H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 HBr proceeds by the following mechanism:&lt;ref name=Laidler291&gt;[[Keith J. Laidler|Laidler K.J.]], ''Chemical Kinetics'' (3rd ed., Harper &amp; Row 1987) p.291-4  {{ISBN|0-06-043862-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Atkins&gt;P. Atkins and J. de Paula ''Physical Chemistry'' (8th ed., W.H. Freeman 2006), p.831  {{ISBN|0-7167-8759-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Initiation 
: Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 Br• (thermal) or Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + hν → 2 Br• (photochemical)
: each Br atom is a free radical, indicated by the symbol « • » representing an unpaired electron.

* Propagation (here a cycle of two steps)
: Br• + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → HBr + H•
: H• + Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → HBr + Br•
: the sum of these two steps corresponds to the overall reaction H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 HBr, with [[catalysis]] by Br• which participates in the first step and is regenerated in the second step.

* Retardation (inhibition)
: H• + HBr → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + Br•
: this step is specific to this example, and corresponds to the first propagation step in reverse.

* Termination 2 Br• → Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
: recombination of two radicals, corresponding in this example to initiation in reverse.

As can be explained using the [[Steady state (chemistry)|steady-state approximation]], the thermal  reaction has an initial rate of [[Order of reaction#Fractional order|fractional order]] (3/2), and a complete rate equation with a two-term denominator ([[Order of reaction#Mixed-order|mixed-order kinetics]]).&lt;ref name=Laidler291/&gt;&lt;ref name=Atkins/&gt;

===Further chemical examples===
*The reaction 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O provides an example of chain branching. The propagation is a sequence of two steps whose net effect is to replace an H atom by another H atom plus two OH radicals. This leads to an explosion under certain conditions of temperature and pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Laidler K.J., ''Chemical Kinetics'' (3rd ed., Harper &amp; Row 1987) p.323-8  {{ISBN|0-06-043862-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**H + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → OH + O
**O + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → OH + H
*In [[chain-growth polymerization]], the propagation step corresponds to the elongation of the growing [[polymer]] chain. Chain transfer corresponds to transfer of the activity from this growing chain, whose growth is terminated, to another molecule which may be a second growing polymer chain. For polymerization, the [[kinetic chain length]] defined above may differ from the [[degree of polymerization]] of the product macromolecule.

==Nuclear chain reactions==
{{main|Nuclear chain reaction}}
A ''nuclear'' chain reaction was proposed by [[Leo Szilard]] in 1933, shortly after the neutron was discovered, yet more than five years before [[nuclear fission]] was first discovered. Szilárd knew of ''chemical'' chain reactions, and he had been reading about an energy-producing [[nuclear reaction]] involving high-energy protons bombarding lithium, demonstrated by [[John Cockcroft]] and [[Ernest Walton]], in 1932. Now, Szilárd proposed to use neutrons theoretically produced from certain nuclear reactions in lighter isotopes, to induce further reactions in light isotopes that produced more neutrons. This would in theory produce a chain reaction at the level of the nucleus. He did not envision fission as one of these neutron-producing reactions, since this reaction was not known at the time. Experiments he proposed using [[beryllium]] and [[indium]] failed.

Later, after fission was discovered in 1938, Szilárd immediately realized the possibility of using neutron-induced fission as the particular nuclear reaction necessary to create a chain-reaction, so long as fission also produced neutrons. In 1939, with Enrico Fermi, Szilárd proved this neutron-multiplying reaction in uranium. In this reaction, a [[neutron]] plus a fissionable [[atom]] causes a fission resulting in a larger number of neutrons than the single one that was consumed in the initial reaction. Thus was born the practical [[nuclear chain reaction]] by the mechanism of neutron-induced nuclear fission.

Specifically, if one or more of the produced neutrons themselves interact with other fissionable nuclei, and these also undergo fission, then there is a possibility that the macroscopic overall fission reaction will not stop, but continue throughout the reaction material. This is then a self-propagating and thus self-sustaining chain reaction. This is the principle for [[nuclear reactor]]s and [[atomic bomb]]s.

Demonstration of a self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction was accomplished by [[Enrico Fermi]] and others, in the successful operation of [[Chicago Pile-1]], the first artificial nuclear reactor, in late 1942.

==Electron avalanche in gases==
An [[electron avalanche]] happens between two unconnected electrodes in a gas when an electric field exceeds a certain threshold. Random thermal collisions of gas atoms may result in a few free electrons and positively charged gas ions, in a process called [[impact ionization]]. Acceleration of these free electrons in a strong [[electric field]] causes them to gain energy, and when they impact other atoms, the energy causes release of new free electrons and ions (ionization), which fuels the same process. If this process happens faster than it is naturally quenched by ions recombining, the new ions multiply in successive cycles until the gas breaks down into a plasma and current flows freely in a discharge.

Electron avalanches are essential to the [[dielectric breakdown]] process within gases. The process can culminate in [[corona discharge]]s, [[Streamer discharge|streamer]]s, [[leader (spark)|leader]]s, or in a [[electric spark|spark]] or continuous [[electric arc]] that completely bridges the gap. The process may extend huge sparks — streamers in [[lightning]] discharges propagate by formation of electron avalanches created in the high potential gradient ahead of the streamers' advancing tips. Once begun, avalanches are often intensified by the creation of [[photoelectron]]s as a result of ultraviolet radiation emitted by the excited medium's atoms in the aft-tip region. The extremely high temperature of the resulting plasma cracks the surrounding gas molecules and the free ions recombine to create new chemical compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Lab Note #106 ''Environmental Impact of Arc Suppression'' | author= | publisher = Arc Suppression Technologies | date = April 2011 | url = http://www.arcsuppressiontechnologies.com/arc-suppression-facts/lab-app-notes/| accessdate = March 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process can also be used to detect radiation that initiates the process, as the passage of a single particles can be amplified to large discharges. This is the mechanism of a [[Geiger counter]] and also the visualization possible with a [[spark chamber]] and other [[wire chamber]]s.

==Avalanche breakdown in semiconductors==
An [[avalanche breakdown]] process can happen in semiconductors, which in some ways conduct electricity analogously to a mildly ionized gas. Semiconductors rely on free electrons knocked out of the crystal by thermal vibration for conduction. Thus, unlike metals, semiconductors become better conductors the higher the temperature. This sets up conditions for the same type of positive feedback—heat from current flow causes temperature to rise, which increases charge carriers, lowering resistance, and causing more current to flow. This can continue to the point of complete breakdown of normal resistance at a semiconductor junction, and failure of the device (this may be temporary or permanent depending on whether there is physical damage to the crystal). Certain devices, such as [[avalanche diode]]s, deliberately make use of the effect.

[[File:Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C. (Leaders of the march posing in front of the statue of Abraham Lincoln... - NARA - 542063.tif|thumb|270px|[[Martin Luther King]] and other [[civil rights movement]] leaders in front of the statue of [[Abraham Lincoln]] during the [[March on Washington]], August 28, 1963]]
'''Civil rights movements ''' are a worldwide series of [[political movement]]s for [[equality before the law]], that peaked in the 1960s.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=May 2015}} In many situations they have been characterized by [[nonviolence|nonviolent protests]], or have taken the form of campaigns of [[civil resistance]] aimed at achieving change through [[nonviolent resistance|nonviolent forms of resistance]]. In some situations, they have been accompanied, or followed, by [[civil unrest]] and armed rebellion. The process has been long and tenuous in many countries, and many of these movements did not, or have yet to, fully achieve their goals, although the efforts of these movements have led to improvements in the legal rights of some previously oppressed groups of people, in some places.

The main aim of the successful [[civil rights movement]] and other social movements for civil rights included ensuring that the rights of all people were and are equally protected by the law. These include but are not limited to the [[Minority rights|rights of minorities]], [[women's rights]], and [[LGBT rights]].

==Movement for civil rights in Northern Ireland==
{{See also|Northern Ireland civil rights movement}}
[[Northern Ireland]] is a part of the [[United Kingdom]] which has witnessed violence over many decades, known as [[the Troubles]], arising from tensions between the British ([[Unionism (Ireland)|Unionist]], Protestant) majority and the Irish ([[Nationalism (Ireland)|Nationalist]], Catholic) minority following the [[Partition of Ireland]] in 1920.

The civil rights struggle in Northern Ireland can be traced to activists in Dungannon, led by [[Austin Currie]], who were fighting for equal access to public housing for the members of the Catholic community. This domestic issue would not have led to a fight for civil rights were it not for the fact that being a registered householder was a qualification for local government [[suffrage|franchise]] in Northern Ireland.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

In January 1964, the [[Campaign for Social Justice]] (CSJ) was launched in Belfast.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irelandseye.com/aarticles/history/events/conflict/bttc4.shtm&lt;/ref&gt; This organisation joined the struggle for better housing and committed itself to ending discrimination in employment. The CSJ promised the Catholic community that their cries would be heard. They challenged the government and promised that they would take their case to the Commission for Human Rights in Strasbourg and to the United Nations.&lt;ref name="Dooley, Brian 1998"&gt;Dooley, Brian. "Second Class citizens", in ''Black and Green: The Fight for Civil Rights in Northern Ireland and Black America''. (London:Pluto Press, 1998), 28–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having started with basic domestic issues, the civil rights struggle in Northern Ireland escalated to a full-scale movement that found its embodiment in the [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association]]. NICRA campaigned in the late sixties and early seventies, consciously modelling itself on the American civil rights movement and using similar methods of [[civil resistance]]. NICRA organised marches and protests to demand equal rights and an end to discrimination.

NICRA originally had five main demands:
* one man, one vote
* an end to discrimination in housing
* an end to discrimination in local government
* an end to the [[gerrymandering]] of district boundaries, which limited the effect of Catholic voting
* the disbandment of the [[Ulster Special Constabulary|B-Specials]], an entirely Protestant police reserve, perceived as sectarian.

All of these specific demands were aimed at an ultimate goal that had been the one of women at the very beginning: the end of discrimination.

Civil rights activists all over Northern Ireland soon launched a campaign of [[civil resistance]]. There was opposition from Loyalists, who were aided by the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC), Northern Ireland's police force.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} At this point, the RUC was over 90% Protestant. Violence escalated, resulting in the rise of the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) from the Catholic community, a group reminiscent of those from the War of Independence and the Civil War that occurred in the 1920s that had launched a campaign of violence to end British rule in Northern Ireland. Loyalist [[paramilitaries]] countered this with a defensive campaign of violence and the [[British government]] responded with a policy of [[internment]] without trial of suspected IRA members. For more than 300 people, the internment lasted several years. The huge majority of those interned by the British forces were Catholic. In 1978, in a case brought by the government of the [[Republic of Ireland]] against the government of the [[United Kingdom]], the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled that the [[Five techniques|interrogation techniques]] approved for use by the British army on internees in 1971 amounted to "inhuman and degrading" treatment.

The IRA encouraged Republicans to join in the movement for civil rights but never controlled NICRA. The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association fought for the end of discrimination toward Catholics and did not take a position on the legitimacy of the state.&lt;ref&gt;Dooley, Brian. "Second Class citizens", in ''Black and Green: The Fight for Civil Rights in Northern Ireland and Black America''. (London:Pluto Press, 1998), 28–48&lt;/ref&gt; Republican leader [[Gerry Adams]] explained subsequently that Catholics saw that it was possible for them to have their demands heard. He wrote that "we were able to see an example of the fact that you didn't just have to take it, you could fight back".&lt;ref name="Dooley, Brian 1998"/&gt; For an account and critique of the movements for civil rights in Northern Ireland, reflecting on the ambiguous link between the causes of civil rights and opposition to the union with the United Kingdom, see the work of Richard English.&lt;ref&gt;Richard English, "The Interplay of Non-violent and Violent Action in Northern Ireland, 1967–72", in [[Adam Roberts (scholar)|Adam Roberts]] and [[Timothy Garton Ash]] (eds.), ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present'', Oxford University Press, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-19-955201-6}}, pp. 75–90. [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&amp;dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most important events in the era of civil rights in Northern Ireland took place in [[Derry]], which escalated the conflict from peaceful civil disobedience to armed conflict. The [[Battle of the Bogside]] started on 12 August when an Apprentice Boys, a Protestant order, parade passed through Waterloo Place, where a large crowd was gathered at the mouth of William Street, on the edge of the Bogside. Different accounts describe the first outbreak of violence, with reports stating that it was either an attack by youth from the [[Bogside]] on the RUC, or fighting broke out between Protestants and Catholics. The violence escalated and barricades were erected. Proclaiming this district to be the [[Free Derry]], Bogsiders carried on fights with the RUC for days using stones and petrol bombs. The government finally withdrew the RUC and replaced it with the army, which disbanded the crowds of Catholics who were barricaded in the Bogside.&lt;ref&gt;O'Dochartaigh, Niall. ''From Civil Rights to Armalites: Derry and the Birth of the Irish Troubles'' (Cork: Cork University Press, 1997), 1–18 and 111–152.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bloody Sunday (1972)|Bloody Sunday]], 30 January 1972, in Derry is seen by some as a turning point in the movement for civil rights. Fourteen unarmed Catholic civil rights marchers protesting against [[internment]] were shot dead by the British army and many were left wounded on the streets.

The peace process has made significant gains in recent years. Through open dialogue from all parties, a state of ceasefire by all major paramilitary groups has lasted. A stronger economy improved Northern Ireland's standard of living. Civil rights issues have become less of a concern for many in Northern Ireland over the past 20 years as laws and policies protecting their rights, and forms of affirmative action, have been implemented for all government offices and many private businesses. Tensions still exist, but the vast majority of citizens are no longer affected by violence.

==Canada's Quiet Revolution==
{{Main|Quiet Revolution|October Crisis}}

The 1960s brought intense political and social change to the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[Quebec]], with the election of Liberal Premier [[Jean Lesage]] after the death of [[Maurice Duplessis]], whose government was widely viewed as corrupt.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wednesday-night.com/Duplessis.asp&lt;/ref&gt; These changes included [[secularization]] of the education and health care systems, which were both heavily controlled by the [[Roman Catholic Church]], whose support for Duplessis and his [[Duplessis Orphans|perceived corruption]] had angered many Québécois. Policies of the Liberal government also sought to give Quebec more economic autonomy, such as the [[nationalization]] of [[Hydro-Québec]] and the creation of public companies for the mining, forestry, iron/steel and petroleum industries of the province. Other changes included the creation of the ''Régie des Rentes du Québec'' (Quebec Pension Plan) and new labour codes that made unionizing easier and gave workers the right to strike.

The social and economic changes of the Quiet Revolution gave life to the [[Quebec sovereignty movement]], as more and more Québécois saw themselves as a distinctly culturally different from the rest of Canada. The segregationist [[Parti Québécois]] was created in 1968 and won the [[Quebec general election, 1976|1976 Quebec general election]]. They enacted [[Bill 101|legislation]] meant to enshrine [[French language|French]] as the language of business in the province, while also controversially restricting the usage of [[English language|English]] on signs and restricting the eligibility of students to be taught in English.

A radical strand of [[French Canadian]] nationalism produced the [[Front de libération du Québec]] (FLQ), which since 1963 has been using [[terrorism]] to make [[Quebec]] a sovereign nation. In October 1970, in response to the arrest of some of its members earlier in the year, the FLQ kidnapped British diplomat [[James Cross]] and Quebec's Minister of Labour [[Pierre Laporte]], whom they later killed. The then Canadian Prime Minister [[Pierre Elliott Trudeau]], himself a French Canadian, invoked the [[War Measures Act]], declared [[martial law]] in Quebec, and arrested the kidnappers by the end of the year.

==Movements for civil rights in the United States==
{{Main|African-American Civil Rights Movement (1865–1896)|African-American Civil Rights Movement (1896–1954)|civil rights movement|Timeline of the civil rights movement}}
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Ac.chicagoriot.jpg|right|300px|thumb|[[Democratic National Convention]], 1968]] --&gt;

Movements for civil rights in the United States include noted legislation and organized efforts to abolish public and private acts of [[racial discrimination]] against [[African American]]s and other disadvantaged groups between 1954 and 1968, particularly in the [[southern United States]]. It is sometimes referred to as the Second Reconstruction era, alluding to the unresolved issues of the [[Reconstruction Era]] (1863–77).

===Ethnicity equity issues===

====Integrationism====
{{See also|Racial integration|Jim Crow laws}}
After 1890, the system of [[Jim Crow]], disenfranchisement, and second class citizenship degraded the citizenship rights of African Americans, especially in the South. It was the [[nadir of American race relations]].  There were three main aspects: [[racial segregation]] – upheld by the [[United States Supreme Court]] decision in ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' in 1896 –, legally mandated by southern governments—voter suppression or [[disfranchisement]] in the southern states, and private acts of violence and [[mass racial violence in the United States|mass racial violence]] aimed at African Americans, unhindered or encouraged by government authorities. Although racial discrimination was present nationwide, the combination of law, public and private acts of discrimination, marginal economic opportunity, and violence directed toward African Americans in the southern states became known as [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]].
[[Image:1963 march on washington.jpg|right|300px|thumb|[[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]]]]
Noted strategies employed prior to 1955 included litigation and lobbying attempts by the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP). These efforts were a hallmark of the early American Civil Rights Movement from 1896 to 1954.
However, by 1955, blacks became frustrated by gradual approaches to implement desegregation by federal and state governments and the "massive resistance" by whites. The black leadership adopted a combined strategy of [[direct action]] with [[nonviolence]], sometimes resulting in [[nonviolence|nonviolent resistance]] and [[civil disobedience]]. Some of the acts of [[nonviolence]] and civil disobedience produced crisis situations between practitioners and government authorities. The authorities of federal, state, and local governments often acted with an immediate response to end the crisis situations – sometimes in the practitioners' favor. Some of the different forms of protests and/or civil disobedience employed included [[boycott]]s, as successfully practiced by the [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]] (1955–1956) in Alabama which gave the movement one of its more famous icons in [[Rosa Parks]]; "[[sit-ins]]", as demonstrated by two influential events, the [[Greensboro Four|Greensboro sit-in]] (1960) in North Carolina and the [[Nashville sit-ins]] in Nashville, Tennessee; the influential [[Birmingham Campaign|1963 Birmingham Children's Crusade]], in which children were set upon by the local authorities with fire hoses and attack dogs, and longer marches, as exhibited by the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] (1965) in Alabama which at first was resisted and attacked by the state and local authorities, and resulted in the [[1965 Voting Rights Act]]. The evidence of changing attitudes could also be seen around the country, where small businesses sprang up supporting the Civil Rights Movement, such as New Jersey's Everybody's Luncheonette.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|title=Everybody’s Luncheonette Camden, New Jersey|url=http://www.freewebs.com/almasykusnyir/everybodys/index.htm|access-date=2009-12-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523072741/http://www.freewebs.com/almasykusnyir/everybodys/index.htm|archive-date=2011-05-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jesse Jackson, half-length portrait of Jackson seated at a table, July 1, 1983 edit.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Jesse Jackson]] fought for civil rights as his life's work.]]
Besides the Children's Crusade and the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]], another illustrious event of the 1960s Civil Rights Movement was the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]] in August, 1963. It is best remembered for the "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech by [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] in which the speech turned into a national text and eclipsed the troubles the organizers had to bring to march forward. It had been a fairly complicated affair to bring together various leaders of civil rights, religious and labor groups. As the name of the march implies, many compromises had to be made in order to unite the followers of so many different causes. The "March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom" emphasized the combined purposes of the march and the goals that each of the leaders aimed at. The 1963 March on Washington organizers and organizational leaders, informally named the [[Big Six (civil rights)|"Big Six"]], were [[A. Philip Randolph]], [[Roy Wilkins]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], [[Whitney Young]], [[James L. Farmer, Jr.|James Farmer]] and [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]]. Although they came from different backgrounds and political interests, these organizers and leaders were intent on the peacefulness of the march, which had its own marshal to ensure that the event would be peaceful and respectful of the law.&lt;ref&gt;Barber, Lucy. "In the Great Tradition: The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, August 28, 1963," in ''Marching on Washington: The Forging of an American Political Tradition.'' (Berkeley: U of California Press, 2002), 141–178.&lt;/ref&gt; The success of the march is still being debated, but one aspect which has been raised was the misrepresentation of women. A lot of feminine civil rights groups had participated in the organization of the march, but when it came to actual activity women were denied the right to speak and were relegated to figurative roles in the back of the stage. As some female participants noticed, the March can be remembered for the "I Have a Dream" speech but for some female activists it was a new awakening, forcing black women not only to fight for civil rights but also to engage in the Feminist movement.&lt;ref&gt;Height,Dorothy. "We wanted the voice of a women to be heard": Black women and the 1963 March on Washington", in ''Sisters in the Struggle: African American Women in the Civil Rights-Black Power Movement''. Eds. Collier. Thomas, Bettye and V.P. Franklin. (New York: NYU press, 2001), 83–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

Noted achievements of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] include the judicial victory in the ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' case that nullified the legal article of "[[separate but equal]]" and made segregation legally impermissible, and the passages of the [[1964 Civil Rights Act]], .&lt;ref&gt;[http://finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21 Civil Rights Act of 1964]&lt;/ref&gt; that banned discrimination in employment practices and public accommodations, passage of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] that restored voting rights, and passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1968]] that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing.

====Black Power movement====
{{Main|Black Power movement}}
{{See also|Black Panther Party|Black nationalism|pan-Africanism}}
By 1967 the emergence of the [[Black Power movement]] (1966–75) began to gradually eclipse the original "[[Racial integration|integrated power]]" aims of the successful Civil Rights Movement that had been espoused by [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] and others. Advocates of Black Power argued for black [[self-determination]], and asserted that the [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] inherent in integration robs [[pan-Africanism|African]]s of their common heritage and dignity. For example, the theorist and activist [[Omali Yeshitela]] argues that Africans have historically fought to protect their lands, cultures, and freedoms from European [[Colonialism|colonialist]]s, and that any integration into the society which has stolen another people and their wealth is an act of [[treason]].

Today, most Black Power advocates have not changed their self-sufficiency argument. [[Racism]] still exists worldwide, and some believe that blacks in the United States, on the whole, did not assimilate into U.S. "mainstream" culture. Blacks arguably became even more oppressed, this time partially by "their own" people in a new black [[Social stratification|stratum]] of the [[middle class]] and the [[ruling class]]. Black Power's advocates generally argue that the reason for this [[stalemate]] and further oppression of the vast majority of U.S. blacks is because Black Power's objectives have not had the opportunity to be fully carried through.

One of the most public manifestations of the Black Power movement took place in the 1968 Olympics, when two African-Americans, [[Tommie Smith]] and [[John Carlos]], stood on the podium doing a Black Power salute. This act is still remembered today as the [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute]].

====Chicano Movement====
{{Main|Chicano Movement}}
{{See also|Chicano nationalism|Brown Berets}}
The Chicano Movement occurred during the civil rights era that sought political empowerment and social inclusion for Mexican-Americans around a generally nationalist argument. The Chicano movement blossomed in the 1960s and was active through the late 1970s in various regions of the U.S. The movement had roots in the civil rights struggles that had preceded it, adding to it the cultural and generational politics of the era.

The early heroes of the movement—[[Rodolfo Gonzales]] in [[Denver]] and [[Reies Tijerina]] in New Mexico—adopted a historical account of the preceding hundred and twenty-five years that had obscured much of Mexican-American history. Gonzales and Tijerina embraced a nationalism that identified the failure of the United States government to live up to its promises in the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]]. In that account, Mexican Americans were a conquered people who simply needed to reclaim their birthright and cultural heritage as part of a new nation, which later became known as [[Aztlán]].

That version of the past did not, but take into account the history of those Mexicans who had immigrated to the United States. It also gave little attention to the rights of undocumented immigrants in the United States in the 1960s— which is not surprising, since immigration did not have the political significance it later acquired. It was a decade later when activists, such as Bert Corona in California, embraced the rights of undocumented workers and helped broaden the movement to include their issues.

When the movement dealt with practical problems in the 1960s, most activists focused on the most immediate issues confronting Mexican Americans; unequal educational and employment opportunities, political disfranchisement, and police brutality. In the heady days of the late 1960s, when the student movement was active around the globe, the Chicano movement brought about more or less spontaneous actions, such as the mass walkouts by high school students in Denver and [[East Los Angeles, California|East Los Angeles]] in 1968 and the [[Chicano Moratorium]] in Los Angeles in 1970.

The movement was particularly strong at the college level, where activists formed MEChA, ''[[Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlán]]'', which promoted Chicano Studies programs and a generalized ethno-nationalist agenda.

====American Indian Movement====
{{Main|American Indian Movement}}
At a time when peaceful [[sit-in]]s were a common protest tactic, the [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM) takeovers in their early days were noticeably violent. Some appeared to be spontaneous outcomes of protest gatherings, but others included armed seizure of public facilities.

The [[Alcatraz Island]] occupation of 1969, although commonly associated with NAM, pre-dated the organization, but was a catalyst for its formation.

In 1970, AIM occupied abandoned property at the [[Naval Air Station]] near [[Minneapolis]]. In July 1971, it assisted in a takeover of the Winter Dam, Lac Courte Oreilles, and [[Wisconsin]]. When activists took over the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] Headquarters in Washington, D.C. in November 1972, they sacked the building and 24 people were arrested. Activists occupied the [[Custer County, South Dakota|Custer County]] Courthouse in 1973, though police routed the occupation after a riot took place.

In 1973 activists and military forces confronted each other in the [[Wounded Knee incident]]. The standoff lasted 71 days, and two men died in the violence.

===Gender equity issues===
{{Main|Feminist movement in the United States (1963–82)}}
If the period associated with [[first-wave feminism]] focused upon absolute rights such as [[Women's suffrage|suffrage]] (which led to women attaining the right to vote in the early part of the 20th century), the period of the [[second-wave feminism]] was concerned with the issues such as changing social attitudes and economic, reproductive, and educational equality (including the ability to have careers in addition to motherhood, or the right to choose not to have children) between the genders and addressed the rights of female minorities. The new feminist movement, which spanned from 1963 to 1982, explored economic equality, political power at all levels, professional equality, reproductive freedoms, issues with the family, educational equality, sexuality, and many other issues.

==LGBT rights and gay liberation==
{{Main|Gay Liberation|LGBT social movements}}
&lt;!--[[Image:Gay liberation.jpg|left|thumb|180px|[[Gay Liberation Front]] poster, [[New York City]], 1970]]--&gt;
Since the mid-19th century in [[Germany]], social reformers have used the language of civil rights to argue against the oppression of same-sex sexuality, same-sex emotional intimacy, and [[gender variance]]. Largely, but not exclusively, these [[LGBT movements]] have characterized gender variant and homosexually oriented people as a [[minority group]](s); this was the approach taken by the [[homophile movement]] of the 1940s, 1950s and early 1960s. With the rise of [[secularism]] in the West, an increasing sexual openness, women's liberation, the 1960s [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]], the AIDS epidemic, and a range of [[new social movements]], the homophile movement underwent a rapid growth and transformation, with a focus on building community and unapologetic activism which came to be known as the [[Gay Liberation]].

The words "Gay Liberation" echoed "Women's Liberation"; the [[Gay Liberation Front]] consciously took its name from the "National Liberation Fronts" of [[National Front for the Liberation of Vietnam|Vietnam]] and [[Algerian National Liberation Front|Algeria]], and the slogan "Gay Power", as a defiant answer to the rights-oriented homophile movement, was inspired by [[Black Power]] and [[Chicano]] Power. The GLF's statement of purpose explained:

{{quote|We are a revolutionary group of men and women formed with the realization that complete sexual liberation for all people cannot come about unless existing social institutions are abolished. We reject society's attempt to impose sexual roles and definitions of our nature.|GLF statement of purpose}}

GLF activist [[Martha Shelley]] wrote,

{{quote|We are women and men who, from the time of our earliest memories, have been in revolt against the sex-role structure and nuclear family structure.|"Gay is Good", [[Martha Shelley]], 1970}}

Gay Liberationists aimed at transforming fundamental concepts and institutions of society, such as [[gender]] and the [[family]]. In order to achieve such [[Liberty|liberation]], [[consciousness raising]] and [[direct action]] were employed. Specifically, the word 'gay' was preferred to previous designations such as homosexual or [[homophile]]; some saw 'gay' as a rejection of the [[false dichotomy]] heterosexual/homosexual. Lesbians and gays were urged to "[[coming out|come out]]" and publicly reveal their sexuality to family, friends and colleagues as a form of activism, and to counter shame with [[gay pride]]. "Gay Lib" groups were formed in Australia, New Zealand, Germany, France, the UK, the US, Italy and elsewhere. The lesbian group [[Lavender Menace]] was also formed in the U.S. in response to both the male domination of other Gay Lib groups and the anti-lesbian sentiment in the Women's Movement. Lesbianism was advocated as a feminist choice for women, and the first currents of [[lesbian separatism]] began to emerge.

By the late 1970s, the radicalism of Gay Liberation was eclipsed by a return to a more formal movement that became known as the [[Gay and Lesbian Rights Movement]].

== Soviet Union ==
{{Main|Human rights movement in the Soviet Union}}In the 1960s, the early years of the [[Era of Stagnation|Brezhnev stagnation]], [[Soviet dissidents|dissidents in the Soviet Union]] increasingly turned their attention civil and eventually human rights concerns. The fight for civil and human rights focused on issues of [[Censorship in the Soviet Union|freedom of expression]], [[Persecution of Christians in the Soviet Union|freedom of conscience]], [[Refusenik|freedom to emigrate]], [[Political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union|punitive psychiatry]], and the plight of [[Political repression in the Soviet Union|political prisoners]]. It was characterized by a new openness of dissent, a concern for legality, the rejection of any 'underground' and violent struggle.&lt;ref name="daniel-istoki"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It played a significant role in providing a common language and goal for many Soviet dissidents, and became a cause for diverse social groups in the dissident millieu, ranging from activists in the youth subculture to academics such as [[Andrei Sakharov|Andrei Sakhrarov]].

Significantly, Soviet dissidents of the 1960s introduced the "legalist" approach of avoiding moral and political commentary in favor of close attention to legal and procedural issues. Following several landmark trials of writers ([[Sinyavsky–Daniel trial|Sinyavsky-Daniel]] trial, the trials of [[Alexander Ginzburg]] and [[Yuri Galanskov]]) and an associated crackdown on dissidents by the [[KGB]], coverage of arrests and trials in [[samizdat]] (unsanctioned press) became more common. This activity eventually led to the founding of the ''[[Chronicle of Current Events]]'' in April 1968. The unofficial newsletter reported violations of civil rights and judicial procedure by the Soviet government and responses to those violations by citizens across the USSR.&lt;ref name="horvath-legacy"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1960s–1980s, dissidents in the civil and human rights movement engaged in a variety of activities: The documentation of political repression and rights violations in [[samizdat]] (unsanctioned press); individual and collective protest letters and petitions; unsanctioned demonstrations; an informal network of mutual aid for prisoners of conscience; and, most prominently, civic watch groups appealing to the international community. All of these activities came at great personal risk and with repercussions ranging from dismissal from work and studies to many years of imprisonment in [[labor camp]]s and being subjected to [[Political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union|punitive psychiatry]].

The rights-based strategy of dissent merged with the idea of human rights. The human rights movement included figures such as [[Valery Chalidze]], [[Yuri Orlov]], and [[Lyudmila Alexeyeva]]. Special groups were founded such as the [[Initiative Group for the Defense of Human Rights in the USSR]] (1969) and the [[Committee on Human Rights in the USSR]] (1970). Though faced with the loss of many members to prisons, labor camps, psychiatric institutions and exile, they documented abuses, wrote appeals to international human rights bodies, collected signatures for petitions, and attended trials.

The signing of the [[Helsinki Accords]] (1975) containing human rights clauses provided civil rights campaigners with a new hope to use international instruments. This led to the creation of dedicated [[Helsinki Watch Group]]s in Moscow ([[Moscow Helsinki Group]]), Kiev ([[Ukrainian Helsinki Group]]), Vilnius ([[Lithuanian Helsinki Group]]), Tbilisi, and Erevan (1976–77).&lt;ref name="thomas-helsinki"&gt;{{Cite book

==Prague Spring==
{{Main|Prague Spring}}
[[Image:August 68.jpg|thumb|Prague Spring memorial plate in [[Košice]], [[Slovakia]]]]
The Prague Spring ([[Czech language|Czech]]: ''Pražské jaro'', [[Slovak language|Slovak]]: ''Pražská jar'', [[Russian language|Russian]]: пражская весна) was a period of political liberalization in [[Czechoslovakia]] starting on January 5, 1968, and running until August 20 of that year, when the [[Soviet Union]] and its [[Warsaw Pact]] allies (except for [[Romania]]) invaded the country.

During [[World War II]], Czechoslovakia fell into the Soviet sphere of influence, the [[Eastern Bloc]]. Since 1948 there were no parties other than the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia|Communist Party]] in the country and it was indirectly managed by the Soviet Union. Unlike other countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the communist take-over in Czechoslovakia in 1948 was, although as brutal as elsewhere, a genuine popular movement. Reform in the country did not lead to the convulsions seen in [[Hungary]].

Towards the end of World War II [[Joseph Stalin]] wanted Czechoslovakia, and signed an agreement with [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] that [[Prague]] would be liberated by the [[Red Army]], despite the fact that the [[United States Army]] under General [[George S. Patton]] could have liberated the city earlier. This was important for the spread of pro-Russian (and pro-communist) [[propaganda]] that came right after the war. People still remembered what they felt as Czechoslovakia's betrayal by the West at the [[Munich Agreement]]. For these reasons, the people voted for communists in the 1948 elections, the last democratic poll to take place there for a long time.

From the middle of the 1960s, Czechs and Slovaks showed increasing signs of rejection of the existing regime. This change was reflected by reformist elements within the communist party by installing [[Alexander Dubček]] as party leader. Dubček's reforms of the political process inside Czechoslovakia, which he referred to as ''[[Socialism with a human face]]'', did not represent a complete overthrow of the old regime, as was the case in [[1956 Hungarian Revolution|Hungary in 1956]]. Dubček's changes had broad support from the society, including the [[working class]], but was seen by the Soviet leadership as a threat to their hegemony over other states of the Eastern Bloc and to the very safety of the Soviet Union. Czechoslovakia was in the middle of the defensive line of the Warsaw Pact and its possible defection to the enemy was unacceptable during the [[Cold War]].

However, a sizeable minority in the ruling party, especially at higher leadership levels, was opposed to any lessening of the party's grip on society and actively plotted with the leadership of the Soviet Union to overthrow the reformers. This group watched in horror as calls for multi-party elections and other reforms began echoing throughout the country.

Between the nights of August 20 and August 21, 1968, Eastern Bloc armies from five Warsaw Pact countries invaded Czechoslovakia. During the invasion, Soviet tanks ranging in numbers from 5,000 to 7,000 occupied the streets. They were followed by a large number of Warsaw Pact troops ranging from 200,000 to 600,000.

The Soviets insisted that they had been invited to invade the country, stating that loyal Czechoslovak Communists had told them that they were in need of "fraternal assistance against the [[counter-revolution]]". A letter which was found in 1989 proved an invitation to invade did indeed exist. During the attack of the Warsaw Pact armies, 72 [[Czechs]] and [[Slovaks]] were killed (19 of those in [[Slovakia]]) and hundreds were wounded (up to September 3, 1968). Alexander Dubček called upon his people not to resist. He was arrested and taken to [[Moscow]], along with several of his colleagues.

Subsequent Australian Government laws and policies denied the indigenous population [[Australian referendum, 1967 (Aboriginals)|citizenship]], [[Voting Rights of Indigenous Australians|voting rights]], and [[Aboriginal Land Rights in Australia|land rights]], and instead sought to create a single, uniform white culture with the [[White Australia Policy]] and forcible removal of Aboriginal children from their families (See articles on the [[Stolen Generations]] and [[the Intervention]]). 
Like other international civil rights movements, the push for progress has involved protests (See [[Freedom Ride (Australia)]] and [[Aboriginal Tent Embassy]]) and seen riots in response to social injustice (See [[2004 Redfern Riots]] and [[2004 Palm Island death in custody]].

'''Cleaner production''' is a preventive, company-specific [[environmental protection]] initiative.  It is intended to [[waste reduction|minimize waste]] and [[Air pollutants|emissions]] and maximize product output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Yacooub |first=Ali |author2=Johannes Fresner |title=Half is Enough - An Introduction to Cleaner Production |year=2006 |publisher=LCPC Press |location=[[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]] |isbn=978-3-9501636-2-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By analysing the flow of materials and [[energy]] in a company, one tries to identify options to minimize waste and emissions out of [[Industry|industrial]] processes through [[source reduction]] strategies.  Improvements of organisation and technology help to reduce or suggest better choices in use of materials and energy,  and to avoid waste, [[waste water]] generation, and gaseous emissions, and also [[waste heat]] and noise. 

The concept was developed during the preparation of the [[Rio Summit]] as a programme of UNEP ([[United Nations Environmental Programme]]) and UNIDO ([[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]])&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060528092455/http://www.unido.org/doc/4460 National Cleaner Production Center Programme]&lt;/ref&gt; under the leadership of Jacqueline Aloisi de Larderel, the former Assistant Executive Director of UNEP. The programme was meant to reduce the environmental impact of industry. It built on ideas used by 3M in its 3P programme (pollution prevention pays). It has found more international support than all other comparable programmes. The programme idea was described "...to assist developing nations in leapfrogging from pollution to less pollution, using available technologies". Starting from the simple idea to produce with less waste Cleaner Production was developed into a concept to increase the [[resource efficiency]] of production in general. UNIDO has been operating [[National Cleaner Production Centers]] and Programmes (NCPCs/NCPPs) with centres in Latin America, Africa, Asia and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051208113414/http://www.unido.org/en/doc/4460 UNIDO NCPC Programme, including lessons learned, and contact to National Cleaner Production Centers]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, the term [[pollution prevention]] is more commonly used for cleaner production.

Examples for cleaner production options are: 

*'''Documentation of consumption''' (as a basic analysis of material and energy flows, e. g. with a [[Sankey diagram]]) 
*'''Use of indicators and controlling''' (to identify losses from poor planning, poor education and training, mistakes)
*'''Substitution of raw materials and auxiliary materials''' (especially [[renewable]] materials and energy) 
*'''Increase of useful life of auxiliary materials and process liquids''' (by avoiding drag in, drag out, contamination) 
*'''Improved control and automatisation''' 
*'''[[Reuse]] of waste''' (internal or external) 
*'''New, low waste processes and technologies'''

One of the first [[Europe]]an initiatives in cleaner production was started in [[Austria]] in 1992 by the BMVIT (Bundesministerium für Verkehr, Innovation und Technologie). This resulted in two initiatives: "Prepare" and [[EcoProfit]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120701221957/http://www.prepare.at/ Prepare]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecoprofit.com ECOPROFIT Plattform]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080109072549/http://www.cpc.at/unternehmen/un_Allgemeines_e.htm Cleaner Production Center Austria] Official ECOPROFIT Trainings &amp; Distribution Center&lt;/ref&gt;

The "PIUS" initiative was founded in Germany in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pius-info.de PIUS: Produktionsintegrierter Umweltschutz]&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1994, the [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]] operates the National Cleaner Production Centre Programme with centres in [[Central America]], [[South America]], [[Africa]], [[Asia]], and Europe.

[[Buddhist]] thought consistently rejects the notion of a [[creator deity]].{{sfn|Taliaferro|2013|p=35}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blackburn|first1=Anne M.|last2=Samuels|first2=Jeffrey|title=Approaching the Dhamma: Buddhist Texts and Practices in South and Southeast Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ktWAQAk7XPkC|year=2003|publisher=Pariyatti|isbn=978-1-928706-19-9|pages=[https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=ktWAQAk7XPkC&amp;pg=PA128dq=god#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 128–146]|chapter=II.

Buddhism posits that mundane deities such as [[Brahmā (Buddhism)|Mahabrahma]] are misconstrued to be a creator.{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=36-8}} Buddhist ontology follows the doctrine of [[Pratītyasamutpāda|Dependent Origination]], whereby all phenomena arise in dependence on other phenomena, hence no primal unmoved mover could be acknowledged or discerned.

== Early Buddhist texts ==
According to [[Buddhology|Buddhologist]] [[Richard Hayes (professor)|Richard Hayes]], the early Buddhist [[Nikaya]] literature treats the question of the existence of a creator god "primarily from either an epistemological point of view or a moral point of view". In these texts the [[Buddha]] is portrayed not as a creator-denying atheist who claims to be able to prove such a God's nonexistence, but rather his focus is other teachers' claims that their teachings lead to the highest good.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, Richard P., [http://www.unm.edu/~rhayes/atheism.pdf "Principled Atheism in the Buddhist Scholastic Tradition"], ''Journal of Indian Philosophy'', 16:1 (1988:Mar) pgs 5-6, 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Citing the ''Devadaha Sutta'' (Majjhima Nikaya 101), Hayes states, "while the reader is left to conclude that it is attachment rather than God, actions in past lives, fate, type of birth or efforts in this life that is responsible for our experiences of sorrow, no systematic argument is given in an attempt to disprove the existence of God."&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, Richard P., "Principled Atheism in the Buddhist Scholastic Tradition", ''Journal of Indian Philosophy'', 16:1 (1988:Mar) pgs 9-10&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issaranimmāṇa ==
In the [https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an03/an03.061.than.html Tittha sutta] (A.N. 3.61), the Buddha while describing the three heretical doctrines, mentions Issaranimmāṇavada (doctrine of the divine creation)  as one of those three: 
{{Quote|text='There are brahmans &amp; contemplatives who hold this teaching, hold this view: 'Whatever a person experiences — pleasant, painful, or neither pleasant nor painful — that is all caused by a supreme being's (Issara) act of creation.'&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an03/an03.061.than.html Tittha Sutta: Sectarians
]&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Buddha further explains this doctrine and refutes it as a false belief:
{{Quote|text=Having approached the brahmans &amp; contemplatives who hold that... 'Whatever a person experiences... is all caused by Issara's (supreme being) act of creation,' I said to them: 'Is it true that you hold that... "Whatever a person experiences... is all caused by Issara's (supreme being) act of creation?"' Thus asked by me, they admitted, 'Yes.' Then I said to them, 'Then, in that case, a person is a killer of living beings because of Issara's (supreme being) act of creation. A person is a thief... unchaste... a liar... a divisive speaker... a harsh speaker... an idle chatterer... greedy... malicious... a holder of wrong views because of Issara's (supreme being) act of creation.' When one falls back on creation by a supreme being as being essential, monks, there is no desire, no effort [at the thought], 'This should be done. This shouldn't be done.'&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an03/an03.061.than.html Tittha Sutta: Sectarians]&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

==Mahabrahma as a false creator==
{{further|Saṃsāra (Buddhism)}}
According to Peter Harvey, Buddhism assumes that the universe has no ultimate beginning to it, and thus sees no need for a creator God. In the early texts of Buddhism, the nearest term to this concept is "Great Brahma" (''MahaBrahma'') such as in ''Digha Nikaya'' 1.18.{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=36-8}} However "[w]hile being kind and compassionate, none of the ''brahmās'' are world-creators."{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=37}}

According to Harvey, "[a]fter a long period, the [[Buddhist_cosmology_of_the_Theravada_school#Brahm.C4.81_Planes|three lowest form heavens]] appear, and a [[Buddhist cosmology of the Theravada school#.C4.80bh.C4.81svara Planes|Streaming Radiance]] god dies and is reborn there as a Great Brahmā."{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=36}} Then "other Streaming Radiance gods die and happen to be reborn, due to their karma, as his ministers and retinue."{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=36-7}} The retinue erroneously believes Mahabrahma created them.{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=36-7}} When one of these ministers "eventually dies and is reborn as a human, he develops the power to remember his previous life, and consequently teaches that Great Brahmā is the eternal creator of all beings."{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=37}}

==Medieval philosophers==
===Vasubandhu===
The 5th-century Buddhist philosopher [[Vasubandhu]] argued that a creator's singular identity is incompatible with creating the world in his [[Abhidharmakosha]].&lt;ref name="unm.edu"&gt;Hayes, Richard P., [http://www.unm.edu/~rhayes/atheism.pdf "Principled Atheism in the Buddhist Scholastic Tradition"], ''Journal of Indian Philosophy'', 16:1 (1988:Mar.) pg 11-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese monk [[Xuanzang]] (fl. c. 602–664) studied Buddhism in India during the seventh century, staying at [[Nalanda]]. There, he studied the [[Yogacara]] teachings passed down from [[Asanga]] and Vasubandhu and taught to him by the abbot [[Śīlabhadra]]. In his work ''[[Cheng Weishi Lun]]'' (Skt. ''Vijñāptimātratāsiddhi śāstra''), Xuanzang refutes a "Great Lord" or Great Brahmā doctrine:&lt;ref&gt;Cook, Francis, Chʿeng Wei Shih Lun (''Three Texts on Consciousness Only''), Numata Center, Berkeley, 1999, {{ISBN|978-1886439047}}, pp. 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|According to one doctrine, there is a great, self-existent deity whose substance is real and who is all-pervading, eternal, and the producer of all phenomena. This doctrine is unreasonable. If something produces something, it is not eternal, the non-eternal is not all-pervading, and what is not all-pervading is not real. If the deity's substance is all-pervading and eternal, it must contain all powers and be able to produce all [[dharma]]s everywhere, at all times, and simultaneously. If he produces dharma when a desire arises, or according to conditions, this contradicts the doctrine of a single cause. Or else, desires and conditions would arise spontaneously since the cause is eternal. Other doctrines claim that there is a great Brahma, a Time, a Space, a Starting Point, a Nature, an Ether, a Self, etc., that is eternal and really exists, is endowed with all powers, and is able to produce all dharmas. We refute all these in the same way we did the concept of the Great Lord.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|author=Numata Center for Buddhist Translation and Research|title=Chʿeng Wei Shih Lun|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qjDYAAAAMAAJ|date=January 1999|publisher=仏教伝道協会|isbn=978-1-886439-04-7|pages=20-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Others===
The 7th-century Buddhist scholar [[Dharmakirti|Dharmakīrti]] advances a number of arguments against the existence of a creator god in his ''Pramāṇavārtika'', following in the footsteps of Vasubandhu.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, Richard P., "Principled Atheism in the Buddhist Scholastic Tradition," ''Journal of Indian Philosophy'', 16:1 (1988:Mar.) pg 12&lt;/ref&gt; Later Mahayana scholars such as Śāntarakṣita  and Kamalaśīla continued this tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, Richard P., "Principled Atheism in the Buddhist Scholastic Tradition," ''Journal of Indian Philosophy'', 16:1 (1988:Mar.) pg 14&lt;/ref&gt;

The 11th-century Buddhist philosopher [[Ratnakīrti]] at the then university at Vikramashila (now Bhagalpur, [[Bihar]]) criticized the arguments for the existence of God-like being called [[Ishvara|Isvara]], that emerged in the [[Nyaya#Nyaya on God and salvation|Navya-Nyaya sub-school of Hinduism]], in his “Refutation of Arguments Establishing Īśvara” (Īśvara-sādhana-dūṣaṇa). These arguments are similar to those used by other sub-schools of Hinduism and Jainism that questioned the Navya-Nyaya theory of dualistic creator.&lt;ref&gt;Parimal G. Patil.

'''Ecopath with Ecosim''' ('''EwE''') is a free [[ecosystem]] modelling [[software suite]], initially started at [[NOAA]] by Jeffrey Polovina, but has since primarily been developed at the [[UBC Fisheries Centre]] of the [[University of British Columbia]]. In 2007, it was named as one of the ten biggest scientific breakthroughs in NOAA's 200-year history. The NOAA citation states that Ecopath "revolutionized scientists' ability worldwide to understand complex marine ecosystems".&lt;ref&gt;NOAA, 2007. ECOPATH Modeling: Precursor to an Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management [WWW Document]. URL http://celebrating200years.noaa.gov/breakthroughs/ecopath/welcome.html (accessed 8.26.12).&lt;/ref&gt; Behind this lie more than two decades of development work in association with [[Villy Christensen]], [[Carl Walters]], [[Daniel Pauly]], and other [[fisheries scientist]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Smikle, S.G., V. Christensen and K.A. Aiken (2010). "A review of caribbean ecosystems and fishery resources using ECOPATH models". Revue Etudes Caribéennes, n°15, https://etudescaribeennes.revues.org/4529&lt;/ref&gt; followed with the provision of user support, training and co-development collaborations. Per January 2012 there are 6000+ registered users in 150+ countries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9489">In [[Freud]]ian [[psychoanalysis]], the '''ego ideal''' ({{lang-de|Ichideal}}) is the inner image of oneself as one wants to become.&lt;ref&gt;[[Salman Akhtar]], ''Comprehensive Dictionary of Psychoanalysis'' (2009) p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, "the [[Freud]]ian notion of a perfect or ideal self housed in the [[superego]],"&lt;ref&gt;Howard Rosenthal, ''Human Services Dictionary'' (2003) p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; consisting of "the individual's conscious and unconscious images of what he would like to be, patterned after certain people whom&amp;nbsp;... he regards as ideal."&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''A Layman's Guide to Psychiatry and Psychoanalysis'' (Penguin 1976) p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

In the French strand of [[psychoanalysis|Freudian psychology]], the ego ideal (or '''ideal ego''', {{lang-de|Ideal-Ich}}) has been defined as "an image of the perfect self towards which the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] should aspire."&lt;ref&gt;Janine Chasseguet-Smirgel, ''The Ego Ideal: A Psychoanalytic Essay on the Malady of the Ideal'', 1st American ed., trans. Paul Barrows, introduction by [[Christopher Lasch]] (1984; New York: W.W. Norton, 1985), originally published as ''Idéal du moi'' ([Paris]: Tchou, 1975). {{ISBN|0-393-01971-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freud and superego==

In Freud's "[[On Narcissism|On Narcissism: an Introduction]]" [1914], among other innovations — "most important of all perhaps — it introduces the concepts of the 'ego ideal' and of the self-observing agency related to it, which were the basis of what was ultimately to be described as the 'super-ego' in ''[[The Ego and the Id]]'' (1923b)."&lt;ref&gt;Angela Richards, "Editor's Note", in Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; Freud considered that the ego ideal was the heir to the [[narcissism]] of childhood: the "ideal ego is now the target of the [[self-love]] which was enjoyed in childhood by the actual ego&amp;nbsp;... is the substitute for the lost narcissism of his childhood."&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

The decade that followed would see the concept playing an ever more important and fruitful part in his thinking. In "Mourning and Melancholia" [1917], Freud stressed how "one part of the ego sets itself over against the other, judges it critically, and, as it were, takes it as its object."&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; A few years later, in ''[[Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego]]'' (1921), he examined further how "some such agency develops in our ego which may cut itself off from the rest of the ego and come into conflict with it. We have called it the 'ego ideal'...&amp;nbsp;heir to the original narcissism in which the childish ego enjoyed self-sufficiency."&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Civilization, Society and Religion'' (PFL 12) p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; Freud reiterated how "in many forms of love-choice&amp;nbsp;... the object serves as a substitute for some unattained ego ideal of our own," and further suggested that in group formation "the group ideal&amp;nbsp;... governs the ego in the place of the ego ideal."&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Civilization'' p. 143 and p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

With "The Ego and the Id" [1923], however, Freud's nomenclature began to change. He still emphasised the importance of "the existence of a grade in the ego, a differentiation in the ego, which may be called the 'ego ideal' or 'super-ego',"&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' p. 367&lt;/ref&gt; but it was the latter term which now came to the forefront of his thinking. "Indeed, after ''The Ego and the Id'' and the two or three shorter works immediately following it, the 'ego ideal' disappears almost completely as a technical term"&lt;ref&gt;Richards, p. 348&lt;/ref&gt; for Freud. When it briefly reappears in the "New Introductory Lectures"[1933], it was as ''part'' of "this super-ego&amp;nbsp;... the vehicle of the ego ideal by which the ego measures itself&amp;nbsp;... precipitate of the old picture of the parents, the expression of admiration for the perfection which the child then attributed to them."&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''New Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis''(PFL 2) p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stekel's ego-ideal===

[[Ernest Jones]] records that "I once asked Freud if he regarded an 'ego-ideal' as a universal attribute, and he replied with a puzzled expression: 'Do you think [[Wilhelm Stekel|Stekel]] has an ego-ideal?'."&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Jones, ''The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud'' (Penguin 1964) p. 403&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further developments==

Freud's followers would continue to exploit the potential tension between the concepts of superego and ego ideal. "[[Hermann Nunberg]] defined the ideal ego as the combination of the ego and the id. This agency is the outcome of omnipotent narcissism and is manifested as pathology."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/ego-ideal-ideal-ego Sophie de Mijolla-Mellor "Ego Ideal/Ideal Ego"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Otto Fenichel]], building on [[Sandor Rado]]'s "differentiation of the 'good' (i.e., protecting) and the 'bad' (i.e., punishing) aspects of the superego"&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 412&lt;/ref&gt; explored attempts to "distinguish ego ideals, the patterns of what one would like to be, from the superego, which is characterized as a threatening, prohibiting, and punishing power":&lt;ref&gt;Fenichel, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; while acknowledging the linkages between the two agencies, he suggested for example that "in humor the overcathected superego is the friendly and protective ego-ideal; in depression, it is the negative, hostile, punishing conscience."&lt;ref&gt;Fenichel, p. 399&lt;/ref&gt;

==In narcissism==

[[Melanie Klein|Kleinians]] like [[Herbert Rosenfeld]] "re-invoked Freud's earlier emphasis on the importance of the ego ideal in narcissism, and conceived of a characteristic internal object — a chimerical montage or monster, one might say — that was constructed of the ego, the ego ideal, and the 'mad omnipotent self'."&lt;ref&gt;James S. Grotstein, "Foreword", Neville Symington, ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (London 1993) p. xiii-xiv&lt;/ref&gt; In their wake, [[Otto Kernberg]] highlighted the destructive qualities of the "infantile, [[Grandiosity|grandiose]] ego ideal" - of "identification with an overidealized self- and object-representation, with the primitive form of ego-ideal."&lt;ref&gt;Otto Kernberg, ''Borderline Conditions and Pathological Narcissism'' (London 1990) p. 239 and p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harold Bloom]] has since explored in a literary context how "in the narcissist, the ego-ideal becomes inflated and destructive, because it is filled with images of 'perfection and omnipotence'."&lt;ref&gt;Harold Bloom, ''Jay Gatsby'' (2004) p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; Escape from such "intense, excessive, and sometimes fatal devotion to the ego-ideal" — "to the narcissist, the only reality is the ego-ideal" — is only possible when one "gives up his corrupt ego-ideal and affirms the innocence of humility."&lt;ref&gt;Harold Bloom, ''Raskolnikov and Svidrigailov'' (2004) p. 120–1 and p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideal ego==

The ideal ego is a concept that has been particularly exploited in French psychoanalysis. Whereas Freud "seemed to use the terms indiscriminately&amp;nbsp;... ideal ego or ego ideal,"&lt;ref&gt;Richards, p. 347&lt;/ref&gt; in the thirties '[[Hermann Nunberg]], following Freud, had introduced a split into this concept, making the ''Ideal-Ich'' genetically prior to the ''surmoi'' (superego).&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Roudinesco, ''Jacques Lacan'' (Oxford 1997) p. 284&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter [[Daniel Lagache]] developed the distinction, asserting with particular reference to adolescence that "the adolescent identifies him- or herself anew with the ideal ego and strives by this means to separate from the superego and the ego ideal."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/ego-ideal-ideal-ego Mijolla-Mellor]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]] for his part explored the concept in terms of the subject's "narcissistic identification&amp;nbsp;... his ideal ego, that point at which he desires to gratify himself in himself."&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis'' (London 1994) p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; For Lacan, "the subject has to regulate the completion of what comes as&amp;nbsp;... ideal ego — which is not the ego ideal — that is to say, to constitute himself in his [[The Imaginary (psychoanalysis)|imaginary]] reality."&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Janine Chasseguet-Smirgel]] (1985) identified various possible outcomes for the ego ideal, perverse as well as creative."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/ego-ideal Mijolla-Mellor]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this power can be legislatively delegated by the state to municipalities, government subdivisions, or even to private persons or corporations, when they are authorized by the legislature to exercise the functions of public character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eminent Domain|url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/eminent+domain|website=The Free Dictionary|publisher=Farlex, Inc.|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Anglo-American historical context, property taken could be used only by the government taking the property in question. The most common uses of property taken by eminent domain have been for roads, government buildings and [[public utility|public utilities]]. However, in the mid-20th century, a new application of eminent domain was pioneered, in which the government could take the property and transfer it to a private third party. This was initially done only to "blighted" property, on the principle that such properties had a negative impact upon surrounding property owners, but was later expanded to allow the taking of any private property when the new 3rd party owner could develop the property in such a way as to bring in increased tax revenues to the government.

Some jurisdictions require that the taker make an offer to purchase the subject property, before resorting to the use of eminent domain. However, once the property is taken and the judgment is final, the condemnor owns it in [[fee simple]], and may put it to uses other than those specified in the eminent domain action.

Takings may be of the subject property in its entirety (total take) or in part (part take), either quantitatively or qualitatively (either partially in fee simple or, commonly, an easement, or any other interest less than the full fee simple title).

==Meaning==
The term "eminent domain" was taken from the legal treatise ''[[De jure belli ac pacis]]'' (On the Law of War and Peace), written by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[jurist]] [[Hugo Grotius]] in 1625,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John E. |last=Nowak |first2=Ronald D. |last2=Rotunda |title=Constitutional Law |publisher=Thomson West |location=St. Paul, MN |year=2004 |page=263 |edition=Seventh |isbn=0-314-14452-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; which used the term ''dominium eminens'' ([[Latin]] for ''supreme lordship'') and described the power as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp; The property of subjects is under the eminent domain of the state, so that the state or those who act for it may use and even alienate and destroy such property, not only in the case of extreme necessity, in which even private persons have a right over the property of others, but for ends of public utility, to which ends those who founded civil society must be supposed to have intended that private ends should give way. But, when this is done, the state is bound to make good the loss to those who lose their property.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The exercise of eminent domain is not limited to real property. Condemnors may also take personal property, even intangible property such as [[contract]] rights, [[patent]]s, [[trade secret]]s, and [[copyright]]s. Even the taking of a [[Professional sports|professional]] [[sports team]]'s franchise has been held by the California Supreme Court to be within the purview of the "public use" constitutional limitation, although eventually, that taking (of the [[Oakland Raiders]]' [[NFL]] franchise) was not permitted because it was deemed to violate the interstate commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C3/32C3d60.htm |title=City of Oakland v. Oakland Raiders (1982) 32 C3d 60 |website=Online.ceb.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A taking of property must be accompanied by payment of "just compensation" to the [former] owner. In theory, this is supposed to put the owner in the same position "pecuniarily" that he would have been in had his property not been taken. But in practice courts have limited compensation to the property's fair market value, considering its highest and best use. But though rarely granted, this is not the exclusive measure of compensation; see [[Kimball Laundry Co. v. United States]] (business losses in temporary takings) and United States v. Pewee Coal Co. (operating losses caused by government operations of a mine seized during World War II). In most takings owners are not compensated for a variety of incidental losses caused by the taking of their property that, though incurred and readily demonstrable in other cases, are deemed by the courts to be noncompensable in eminent domain. The same is true of attorneys' and appraisers fees. But as a matter of legislative grace rather than constitutional requirement some of these losses (e.g., business goodwill) have been made compensable by state legislative enactments, and may be partially covered by provisions of the federal Uniform Relocation Assistance Act.

=== United States ===
{{main|Eminent domain in the United States}}

Most states use the term ''eminent domain'', but some U.S. states use the term ''[[appropriation (economics)|appropriation]]'' (New York) or ''expropriation'' (Louisiana) as synonyms for the exercise of eminent domain powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New York Code, Public Lands, Art. 2, Sec. 27, Appropriations |url=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/PBL/27 |website=NYSenate.gov |publisher=The New York Senate |accessdate=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Louisiana Revised Statutes, Title 19, Expropriation |url=http://www.legis.la.gov/legis/laws_Toc.aspx?folder=75&amp;level=Parent |website=Louisiana State Legislature |accessdate=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''condemnation'' is used to describe the formal act of exercising this power to transfer title or some lesser interest in the subject property.

The constitutionally required "just compensation" in partial takings is usually measured by fair market value of the part taken, plus severance damages (the diminution in value of the property retained by the owner [remainder] when only a part of the subject property is taken). Where a partial taking provides economic benefits specific to the remainder, those must be deducted, typically from severance damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Larson |first1=Aaron |title=Eminent Domain|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/real_estate/eminent_domain.html |website=ExpertLaw.com |publisher=ExpertLaw |accessdate=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former owners of the property rarely receive full market value because some elements of value are deemed noncompensable in eminent domain law.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The practice of condemnation came to the American colonies with the [[common law]]. When it came time to draft the [[United States Constitution]], differing views on eminent domain were voiced. The [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] to the Constitution requires that the taking be for a "public use" and mandates payment of "just compensation" to the owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_12_03_04_benson.pdf |title=The Evolution of Eminent Domain: A Remedy for Market Failure or an Effort to Limit Government Power and Government Failure? |format=PDF |website=Independent.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In federal law, Congress may take private property directly (without recourse to the courts) by passing an Act transferring title of the subject property directly to the government. In such cases, the property owner seeking compensation must sue the United States for compensation in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. The legislature may also delegate the power to private entities like public utilities or railroads, and even to individuals.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite web|title=''Linggi v. Garovotti'', 45 Cal.2d 20, 286 P.2d 15 (1955).|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15917425264572652948|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[U.S. Supreme Court]] has consistently deferred to the right of states to make their own determinations of "public use".

=== Canada ===
In Canada, expropriation is governed by federal or provincial statutes. Under these statutory regimes, public authorities have the right to acquire private property for public purposes, so long as the acquisition is approved by the appropriate government body. Once a property is taken, an owner is entitled to "be made whole" by compensation for: the market value of the expropriated property, injurious affection to the remainder of the property (if any), disturbance damages, business loss, and special difficulty relocating. Owners can advance claims for compensation above that initially provided by the expropriating authority by bringing a claim before the court or an administrative body appointed by the governing legislation.

==Europe==
In many European nations, the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] provides protection from an appropriation of private property by the state. Article 8 of the Convention provides that "Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home, and his correspondence" and prohibits interference with this right by the state, unless the interference is in accordance with law and necessary in the interests of [[national security]], public safety, economic well-being of the country, prevention of disorder or crime, protection of health or morals, or protection of the rights and freedoms of others. This right is expanded by Article 1 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights#toc|First Protocol]] to the Convention, which states that "Every natural person or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions." Again, this is subject to exceptions where state deprivation of private possessions is in the general or [[public interest]], is in accordance with law, and, in particular, to secure payment of [[tax]]es. Settled case-law of ECHR provides that just compensation has to be paid in cases of expropriation.&lt;ref&gt;See James v.the UK, decision of ECHR dated by 21 February 1986, para 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
In [[France]], the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] similarly mandates just and preliminary compensation before expropriation; and a [[Déclaration d'utilité publique]] is commonly required, to demonstrate a public benefit.

Notably, in 1945, by decree of General [[Charles de Gaulle]] based on untried&lt;ref name="shame" /&gt; accusations of collaboration, the [[Renault]] company was expropriated from Louis Renault posthumously and nationalised as ''Régie Nationale des Usines Renault''&lt;ref name="shame"&gt;{{cite news |title=Louis Renault and the shame of a nation |publisher=The Daily Telegraph, Ian Morton |date=14 May 2005 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/2735296/Louis-Renault-and-the-shame-of-a-nation.html |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;—without compensation.&lt;ref name="ogre"&gt;{{cite news |title=Foreign News: Was He Murdered? |publisher=Time Magazine |date=Feb 6, 1956 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,893292,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===England and Wales===
{{main|Compulsory purchase in England and Wales}}
After his victory in 1066, [[William the Conqueror]] seized virtually all land in England. Although he maintained absolute power over the land, he granted fiefs to landholders who served as stewards, paying fees and providing military services. During the [[Hundred Years War]] in the 14th century, [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] used the Crown's right of [[purveyance]] for massive expropriations. Chapter 28 of [[Magna Carta]] required that immediate cash payment be made for expropriations. As the king's power was broken down in the ensuing centuries, tenants were regarded as holding ownership rights rather than merely possessory rights over their land. In 1427, a statute was passed granting commissioners of sewers in [[Lincolnshire]] the power to take land without compensation. After the early 16th century, however, Parliamentary takings of land for roads, bridges, etc. generally did require compensation. The common practice was to pay 10% more than the assessed value. However, as the voting franchise was expanded to include more non-landowners, the bonus was eliminated. In spite of contrary statements found in some American law, in the United Kingdom, compulsory purchase valuation cases were tried to juries well into the 20th century, such as [[Attorney-General v De Keyser’s Royal Hotel Ltd]] (1919).

In [[England and Wales]], and other jurisdictions that follow the principles of [[English law]], the related term '''compulsory purchase''' is used. The landowner is compensated with a price agreed or stipulated by an appropriate person. Where agreement on price cannot be achieved, the value of the taken land is determined by the [[Upper Tribunal]]. The operative law is a patchwork of statutes and case law. The principal Acts are the [[Lands Clauses Consolidation Act 1845]], the [[Land Compensation Act 1961]], the [[Compulsory Purchase Act 1965]], the [[Land Compensation Act 1973]], the Acquisition of Land Act 1981, part IX of the [[Town and Country Planning Act 1990]], the [[Planning and Compensation Act 1991]], and the [[Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004]].

===Germany===
The [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]] states in its Article 14 (3) that "an expropriation is only allowed for the public good"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dejure.org/gesetze/GG/14.html |title=Art. 14 GG |website=Dejure.org |date= |accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and just compensation must be made. It also provides for the right to have the amount of the compensation checked by a court.

===Italy===
[[File:Espropria graffiti in Turin October 2016.jpg|thumb|''Espropria'', "expropiate". Protest graffiti in [[Turin]]]]
''Esproprio'', or more formally ''espropriazione per pubblica utilità'' (literally "expropriation for public utility") in [[Italy]] takes place within the frame of [[Civil law (area)|civil law]], as an expression of the ''potere ablatorio'' (ablative power). The law regulating expropriation is the D.P.R. n.327 of 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.camera.it/parlam/leggi/deleghe/01325dla.htm |title=D.P.R. 327/2001 |website=Camera.it |date= |accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; amended by D.Lgs. n.302 of 2002;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parlamento.it/parlam/leggi/deleghe/02302dl.htm |title=Dlgs 302/2002 |website=Parlamento.it |date= |accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; it supersedes the old expropriation law, the Royal Decree n.2359 of 1865. Also other national and regional laws may apply, not always giving a full compensation to the owner.&lt;ref&gt;In other countries (France, Germany, Great Britain, Germany) is provided fair compensation according to the free market value both for regular expropriations or for absolutely unlawful occupations: {{cite journal |last1=Buonomo |first1=Giampiero |title=Occupazione acquisitiva: nodo irrisolto nonostante le modifiche al Testo unico |journal=Diritto&amp;Giustizia edizione online |date=2003 |url=https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89339045}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expropriation can be total (the whole property is expropriated) or partial; permanent or temporary.

The article 42 of the [[Constitution of Italy|Italian Constitution]] and the article 834 of the [[Law of Italy|Italian Civil Code]] state that a private good can be expropriated for public utility. Furthermore, the article 2 of the Constitution binds Italian citizens to respect their ''mandatory duties of political, economical and social solidarity''.

The implementation of the eminent domain follows two principles:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Manuale pratico dell'espropriazione|last=Assini, N.-Tescaroli, N.|first=|publisher=|year=2003|isbn=|location=Padua|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* legality: a public institution can exporpriate private goods only in the cases law allowes it and respecting its procedures (following the article 23 of the [[Constitution of Italy|Italian Constitution]]);
* compensation: (art. 42/III) the State must provide a certain amount of money as compensation, which is determined by the law. According to the [[Constitutional Court of Italy|Italian Constitutional Court]], this compensation is not required to be equal to the market value of the expropriated good, although this sum must not be merely symbolic.
''Nazionalizzazione'' ("nationalization"), instead, is provided for by article 43 of the Constitution; it transfers to governmental authority and property a whole industrial sector, if it is deemed to be a natural or de facto [[monopoly]], and an essential service of public utility. The most famous nationalization in Italy was the [[Enel|1962 nationalization of the electrical power sector]].

===Spain===
Article 33.3 of the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]] allows forced expropriation ("expropiación forzosa") only where justified on the grounds of public utility or social interest and subject to the payment of appropriate compensation as provided for in law.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.congreso.es/consti/constitucion/indice/titulos/articulos.jsp?ini=33&amp;tipo=2 Constitución Española de 1978 Art 33 part 3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
Expropriation. The right of state or municipality to buy property when it is determined to be of "particular public interest", is regulated in Expropriationslagen (1972:719).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://lagen.nu/1972:719 |title=Expropriationslag (1972:719) (ExprL) |publisher=Lagen.nu |date= |accessdate=2016-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government purchases the property at an estimated market value plus a 25% compensation. The law also states that the property owner shall not suffer economic harm because of the expropriation.

==Australia==
{{Main|Section 51(xxxi) of the Australian Constitution}}

In Australia, section 51(xxxi) of the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]] permits the [[Parliament of Australia|Commonwealth Parliament]] to make laws with respect to "the acquisition of property on just terms from any State or person for any purpose in respect of which the Parliament has power to make laws."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s51.html/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411044012/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s51.html |archivedate=2009-04-11 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been construed as meaning that just compensation may not always include monetary or proprietary recompense, rather it is for the court to determine what is just. It may be necessary to imply a need for compensation in the interests of justice, lest the law be invalidated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1941/20.html/ |title=''Andrews v Howell'' (1941) 65 CLR 255 |website=Austlii.edu.au |accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Property subject to resumption is not restricted to real estate as authority from the [[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court]] has extended the states' power to resume property to any form of physical property.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} For the purposes of section 51(xxxi), money is not property that may be compulsorily acquired.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} (The following is cited by a dead link) A statutory right to sue has been considered "property" under this section.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The Commonwealth must also derive some benefit from the property acquired, that is, the Commonwealth can "only legislate for the acquisition of Property for particular purposes".&lt;ref&gt;Australian Constitutional Commission, ''Final Report of the Constitutionali Commission'' vol 1 (Canberra: Australian Government Publishing Service, 1988): 600. {{ISBN|0-644-06897-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the power does not extend to allow legislation designed merely to seek to extinguish the previous owner's title.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The states and territories' powers of resumption on the other hand are not so limited. The section 43(1) of the Lands Acquisition Act 1998 (NT) grants the Minister the power to acquire land 'for any purpose whatever'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/laa192/s43.html/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423143837/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nt/consol_act/laa192/s43.html |archivedate=2015-04-23 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The High Court of Australia interpreted this provision literally, relieving the Territory government of any public purpose limitation on the power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/2008/20.html/ |title=Griffiths v Minister for Lands, Planning and Environment [2008&amp;#93; HCA 20 (15 May 2008) |website=Austlii.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This finding permitted the Territory government to acquire land subject to Native Title, effectively extinguishing the Native Title interest in the land. Kirby J in dissent, along with a number of commentators, viewed this as a missed opportunity to comment on the exceptional nature of powers of resumption exercised in the absence of a public purpose limitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Reale |first=Andreana |title=Assisted Theft: Compulsory land acquisition for private benefit in Australia and the US |journal=Alternative Law Journal |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=147–51 |publisher=Legal Service Bulletin Co-operative Ltd |location=Melbourne |year=2009 |url=http://www.altlj.org/index.php?option=Articles&amp;task=viewarticle&amp;artid=69#1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''resumption'' is a reflection of the fact that, as a matter of Australian law, all land was originally owned by [[the Crown]] before it was sold, leased or granted&lt;ref&gt;Samantha J. Hepburn, ''Principles of Property Law'', 2nd ed. (Newport, NSW: Cavendish, 2001):45-46. {{ISBN|1-876905-08-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and that, through the act of compulsory acquisition, the Crown is "resuming" possession.

Brazil's expropriation laws are governed by the Presidential Decree No. 3365 of July 21, 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DECRETO-LEI Nº 3.365, DE 21 DE JUNHO DE 1941|url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/decreto-lei/Del3365.htm|publisher=Presidência da República|accessdate=24 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chile===
Art. 19, No. 24, of the [[Chilean Constitution]] says in part, "In no case may anyone be deprived of his property, of the assets affected or any of the essential faculties or powers of ownership, except by virtue of a general or a special law which authorizes expropriation for the public benefit or the national interest, duly qualified by the legislator. The expropriated party may protest the legality of the expropriation action before the ordinary courts of justice and shall, at all times, have the right to indemnification for patrimonial harm actually caused, to be fixed by mutual agreement or by a sentence pronounced by said courts in accordance with the law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://confinder.richmond.edu/admin/docs/Chile.pdf |title=Chile |website=Confinder.richmond.edu |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Constitution originally provided for the [[right to property]] under Articles 19 and 31. Article 19 guaranteed to all citizens the right to 'acquire, hold and dispose of property'. Article 31 provided that "No person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law." It also provided that compensation would be paid to a person whose property had been 'taken possession of or acquired' for public purposes. In addition, both the state government as well as the union (federal) government were empowered to enact laws for the "acquisition or requisition of property" (Schedule VII, Entry 42, List III). It is this provision that has been interpreted as being the source of the state's 'eminent domain' powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://openarchive.in/judis/1119.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721180417/http://openarchive.in/judis/1119.htm |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The provisions relating to the right to property were changed a number of times. The 44th [[Constitution of India#Amendment|amendment]] act of 1978 deleted the right to property from the list of Fundamental Rights.&lt;ref name="44amact"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://indiacode.nic.in/coiweb/amend/amend44.htm |title=The Constitution (Amendment) |website=Indiacode.nic.in |date= |accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new article, Article 300-A, was added to the constitution to provide, "No person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law." Thus, if a legislature makes a law depriving a person of his property, it will not be unconstitutional. The aggrieved person shall have no right to move the court under Article 32. Thus, the right to property is no longer a fundamental right, though it is still a constitutional right. If the government appears to have acted unfairly, the action can be challenged in a court of law by citizens.&lt;ref name="pgA33"&gt;Tayal, B.B. &amp; Jacob, A. (2005), ''Indian History, World Developments and Civics'', p. A-33&lt;/ref&gt;

Land acquisition in India is currently governed by [[The Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013]], which came into force from 1 January 2014.&lt;ref name=LARR2011&gt;{{cite web |title=The Land Acquisition, Rehabilation and Resettlement Bill, 2011 – Full Text of Bill |publisher=Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India |url=http://rural.nic.in/latest/bill_chapter_07092011_E.pdf/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2013, land acquisition in India was governed by [[Land Acquisition Act, 1894|Land Acquisition Act of 1894]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bhattacharyya |first1=Debjani |title=The history of eminent domain in colonial thought and legal practice, Special Section Artic… 9 Pages The history of eminent domain in colonial thought and legal practice |journal=Economic and Political Weekly |date=2015 |volume=50 |issue=50 |url=https://www.academia.edu/17572189/The_history_of_eminent_domain_in_colonial_thought_and_legal_practice_Special_Section_Article_Economic_and_Political_Weekly_Vol._L_No.50_December_2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the new LARR (amendment) ordinance 31 December 2014 diluted many clauses of the original act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prsindia.org/uploads/media/Ordinances/RTFCTLARR%20Ordinance%202014.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement (Amendment) Ordinance |date=2014 |website=Prsindia.irg |accessdate=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The liberalisation of the economy and the Government's initiative to set up special economic zones have led to many protests by farmers and have opened up a debate on the reinstatement of the fundamental right to private property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/India/Should-right-to-property-return/articleshow/4202212.cms |work=The Times Of India |first1=Dhananjay |last1=Mahapatra |title=Should right to property return? |date=28 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pakistan===
Under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, the government has the power to compulsorily acquire private land at the prevailing market rate for public purposes such as roads, highways, railways, dams, airports, etc.

==Other countries==
Many countries recognize eminent domain to a much lesser extent than the English-speaking world or do not recognize it at all. [[Japan]], for instance, has very weak eminent domain powers, as evidenced by the high-profile opposition to the expansion of [[Narita International Airport]], and the disproportionately large amounts of financial inducement given to residents on sites slated for redevelopment in return for their agreement to leave, one well-known recent case being that of [[Roppongi Hills]].

There are other countries such as the [[People's Republic of China]] that practice eminent domain whenever it is convenient to make space for new communities and government structures. [[Singapore]] practices eminent domain under the Land Acquisitions Act, which allows it to carry out its [[Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme]] for urban renewal. The [[Amendments to the Land Titles Act]] allowed property to be purchased for purposes of urban renewal against an owner sharing a collective title if the majority of the other owners wish to sell and the minority did not. Thus, eminent domain often invokes concerns of [[majoritarianism]].

In the Bahamas, the Acquisition of Land Act operates to permit the acquisition of land where it is deemed likely to be required for a public purpose. The land can be acquired by private agreement or compulsory purchase (s7 of the Act). Under section 24 of the Acquisition of Land Act, the purchaser may purchase the interest of the mortgagee of any land acquired under the Act. To do so, the purchaser must pay the principal sum and interest, together with costs and charges plus 6 months’ additional interest.

Since the 1990s, the [[Zimbabwe]]an government under [[Robert Mugabe]] has seized a great deal of land and homes of mainly white farmers in the course of the [[Land reform in Zimbabwe|land reform movement in Zimbabwe]]. The government argued that such land reform was necessary to redistribute the land to Zimbabweans dispossessed of their lands during [[colonialism]] – these farmers were never compensated for this seizure.&lt;ref&gt;Dancaescu, Nick. Note. Land reform in Zimbabwe. 15 Fla. J. Int'l L. 615 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Empirical research''' is [[research]] using [[empirical evidence]]. It is a way of gaining knowledge by means of direct and indirect [[observation]] or [[experience]]. [[Empiricism]] values such research more than other kinds. Empirical evidence (the record of one's direct observations or experiences) can be analyzed [[quantitative research|quantitatively]] or [[qualitative research|qualitatively.]] Quantifying the evidence or making sense of it in qualitative form, a researcher can answer empirical questions, which should be clearly defined and answerable with the evidence collected (usually called [[data]]). Research design varies by field and by the question being investigated. Many researchers combine qualitative and quantitative forms of analysis to better answer questions which cannot be studied in laboratory settings, particularly in the social sciences and in education.

In some fields, quantitative research may begin with a research question (e.g., "Does listening to vocal music during the learning of a word list have an effect on later memory for these words?") which is tested through experimentation. Usually, a researcher has a certain [[theory]] regarding the topic under investigation. Based on this theory, statements or [[hypotheses]] will be proposed (e.g., "Listening to vocal voice has a negative effect on learning a word list."). From these hypotheses, predictions about specific events are derived (e.g., "People who study a word list while listening to vocal music will remember fewer words on a later memory test than people who study a word list in silence."). These predictions can then be tested with a suitable [[experiment]]. Depending on the outcomes of the experiment, the theory on which the hypotheses and predictions were based will be supported or not,&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin, C. J. (2005). ''Research in Psychology: Methods and Design.'' USA: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; or may need to be modified and then subjected to further testing.

==Terminology==
The term [[empirical]] was originally used to refer to certain [[ancient Greek]] practitioners of medicine who rejected adherence to the [[dogma]]tic doctrines of the day, preferring instead to rely on the observation of [[Phenomenon|phenomena]] as perceived in experience. Later [[empiricism]] referred to a theory of [[knowledge]] in philosophy which adheres to the principle that knowledge arises from experience and evidence gathered specifically using the senses. In scientific use, the term empirical refers to the gathering of data using only evidence that is observable by the senses or in some cases using calibrated scientific instruments. What early philosophers described as empiricist and empirical research have in common is the dependence on observable data to formulate and test theories and come to conclusions.

==Usage==
The researcher attempts to describe accurately the interaction between the instrument (or the [[Sense|human senses]]) and the entity being observed. If instrumentation is involved, the researcher is expected to [[calibrate]] his/her instrument by applying it to known standard objects and documenting the results before applying it to unknown objects. In other words, it describes the research that has not taken place before and their results.

In practice, the accumulation of evidence for or against any particular theory involves planned [[research design]]s for the collection of [[Empirical evidence|empirical data]], and academic rigor plays a large part of judging the merits of [[research design]]. Several typologies for such designs have been suggested, one of the most popular of which comes from Campbell and Stanley.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, D. &amp; Stanley, J. (1963). ''Experimental and quasi-experimental designs for research''. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company.&lt;/ref&gt; They are responsible for popularizing the widely cited distinction among [[Pre-experimental Science|pre-experimental]], [[experimental design|experimental]], and [[quasi-experimental design|quasi-experimental]] designs and are staunch advocates of the central role of randomized experiments in [[educational research]].

=== Scientific research ===
Accurate analysis of data using standardized statistical methods in [[Scientific method|scientific]] studies is critical to determining the validity of empirical research. [[statistics|Statistical]] formulas such as regression, [[uncertainty coefficient]], t-test, [[chi square]], and various types of [[Analysis of variance|ANOVA]] (analyses of variance) are fundamental to forming logical, valid conclusions. If empirical data reach significance under the appropriate statistical formula, the research [[hypothesis]] is supported. If not, the null hypothesis is supported (or, more accurately, not rejected), meaning no effect of the [[Dependent and independent variables|independent variable]](s) was observed on the [[Dependent and independent variables|dependent variable]](s).

The outcome of empirical research using statistical hypothesis testing is never ''proof''. It can only ''support'' a hypothesis, ''reject'' it, or do neither. These methods yield only probabilities.

Among scientific researchers, empirical ''evidence'' (as distinct from empirical ''research'') refers to objective evidence that appears the same regardless of the observer. For example, a thermometer will not display different temperatures for each individual who observes it. Temperature, as measured by an accurate, well [[Calibration|calibrated]] [[thermometer]], is empirical evidence. By contrast, non-empirical evidence is subjective, depending on the observer. Following the previous example, observer A might truthfully report that a room is warm, while observer B might truthfully report that the same room is cool, though both observe the same reading on the thermometer. The use of empirical evidence negates this effect of personal (i.e., subjective) experience or time.

The varying perception of empiricism and rationalism shows concern with the limit to which there is dependency on experience of sense as an effort of gaining knowledge. According to rationalism, there are a number of different ways in which sense experience is gained independently for the knowledge and concepts. According to empiricism, sense experience is considered as the main source of every piece of knowledge and the concepts. In reference with a specific piece of knowledge, this paper will focus on differentiating between rationalism and empiricism or rational views and empirical views. 
In general, rationalists are known for the development of their own views following two different way. First, the key argument can be placed that there are cases in which the content of knowledge or concepts end up outstripping the information. This outstripped information is provided by the sense experience (Hjørland, 2010, 2). Second, there is construction of accounts as to how reasoning helps in the provision of addition knowledge about a specific or broader scope. Empiricists are known to be presenting complementary senses related to thought. First there is development of accounts of how there is provision of information by experience that is cited by rationalists. This is insofar for having it in the initial place. At times, empiricists tend to be opting skepticism as an option of rationalism. If experience is not helpful in the provision of knowledge or concept cited by rationalists, then they do not exist (Pearce, 2010, 35). Second, empiricists hold the tendency of attacking the accounts of rationalists while considering reasoning to be an important source of knowledge or concepts. The overall disagreement between empiricists and rationalists show primary concerns in how there is gaining of knowledge with respect to the sources of knowledge and concept. In some of the cases, disagreement at the point of gaining knowledge results in the provision of conflicting responses to other aspects as well. There might be a disagreement in the overall feature of warrant, while limiting the knowledge and thought. Empiricists are known for sharing the view that there is no existence of innate knowledge and rather that is derivation of knowledge out of experience. These experiences are either reasoned using the mind or sensed through the five senses human possess (Bernard, 2011, 5). On the other hand, rationalists are known to be sharing the view that there is existence of innate knowledge and this is different for the objects of innate knowledge being chosen. In order to follow rationalism, there must be adoption of one of the three claims related to the theory that are Deduction or Intuition, Innate Knowledge, and Innate Concept. The more there is removal of concept from mental operations and experience, there can be performance over experience with increased plausibility in being innate. Further ahead, empiricism in context with a specific subject provides a rejection of corresponding version related to innate knowledge and deduction or intuition (Weiskopf, 2008, 16). Insofar as there is acknowledgement of concepts and knowledge within the area of subject, the knowledge has major dependence on experience through human senses.

== Etymology ==
The English word ''faith'' is thought to date from 1200–1250, from the Middle English ''feith'', via Anglo-French ''fed'', Old French ''feid'', ''feit'' from Latin ''fidem'', accusative of ''fidēs'' (trust), akin to ''fīdere'' (to trust).&lt;ref name=dict&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/faith |title=Faith – Define Faith |work=Dictionary.com |accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stages of faith development ==
{{Main|James W. Fowler#Stages of Faith}}

[[James W. Fowler]] (1940–2015) proposes a series of stages of faith-development (or [[spiritual development]]) across the human life-span. His stages relate closely to the work of [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]], Erikson, and [[Lawrence Kohlberg|Kohlberg]] regarding aspects of psychological development in children and adults. Fowler defines faith as an activity of trusting, committing, and relating to the world based on a set of assumptions of how one is related to others and the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Nancy|last1=Evans |first2=Deanna |last2=Forney |first3=Florence |last3=Guido |first4=Lori |last4=Patton |first5=Kristen |last5=Renn |title=Student Development in College: Theory, Research, and Practice |edition=Second |publisher=Jossey-Bass |location=|year=2010 |isbn=978-0787978099}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stages of faith ===
# Intuitive-Projective: a stage of confusion and of high impressionability through stories and [[ritual]]s (pre-school period).
# Mythic-Literal: a stage where provided information is accepted in order to conform with [[social norm]]s (school-going period).
# Synthetic-Conventional: in this stage the faith acquired is concreted in the [[belief system]] with the forgoing of personification and replacement with [[authority]] in individuals or groups that represent one's beliefs (early-late adolescence).
# Individuative-Reflective: in this stage the individual critically analyzes adopted and accepted faith with existing systems of faith. Disillusion or strengthening of faith happens in this stage. Based on needs, experiences and paradoxes (early adulthood).
# Conjunctive faith: in this stage people realize the limits of [[logic]] and, facing the paradoxes or [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]] of [[personal life|life]], accept the "mystery of life" and often return to the sacred stories and symbols of the pre-acquired or re-adopted faith system. This stage is called negotiated settling in life (mid-life).
# Universalizing faith: this is the "enlightenment" stage where the individual comes out of all the existing systems of faith and lives life with universal principles of compassion and love and in service to others for upliftment, without worries and [[doubt]] (middle-late adulthood (45–65 years old and plus).&lt;ref&gt;Works of [[Daniel Levinson|Daniel J. Levinson]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{full|date=May 2018}}

No hard-and-fast rule requires individuals pursuing faith to go through all six stages. There is a high probability for individuals to be content and fixed in a particular stage for a lifetime; stages from 2-5 are such stages. Stage 6 is the summit of faith development. This state is often{{quantify|date=December 2015}} considered as "not fully" attainable.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, J.W.; Stages of Faith – The Psychology of Human Development and the Quest for Meaning&lt;/ref&gt;

Faith in Buddhism (''{{lang-pi|saddhā}}'', ''{{lang-sa|śraddhā}}'') refers to a serene commitment in the practice of the Buddha's teaching and trust in enlightened or highly developed beings, such as [[Buddha (title)|Buddhas]] or ''[[bodhisattvas]]'' (those aiming to become a Buddha).&lt;ref name="Gomez 2004"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gómez|first1=Luis O.|editor1-last=Buswell|editor1-first=Robert E.|editor1-link=Robert Buswell Jr.|title=Faith|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Buddhism|date=2004|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA, [[Thomson Gale]]|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=0-02-865720-9|url=http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/Encyclopedia%20of%20Buddhism_2%20Vols_%20Buswell.pdf|pages=277–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Jayatilleke|1963|pp=388–9}} Buddhists usually recognize multiple objects of faith, but many are especially devoted to one particular object of faith, such as one particular Buddha.&lt;ref name="Gomez 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kinnard|first1=Jacob N.|author-link=Jacob N.

In [[early Buddhism]], faith was focused on the [[Triple Gem]], that is, [[Gautama Buddha]], his teaching (the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dhamma]]), and the community of spiritually developed followers, or the monastic community seeking enlightenment (the [[Sangha]]). Although offerings to the monastic community were valued highest, early Buddhism did not morally condemn peaceful offerings to [[deva (Buddhism)|deities]].{{sfn|Lamotte|1988|pp=74–5, 81}} A faithful devotee was called [[upasaka and Upasika|''upāsaka'' or ''upāsika'']], for which no formal declaration was required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Tremblay|first1=Xavier|editor1-last=Heirman|editor1-first=Ann|editor2-last=Bumbacher|editor2-first=Stephan Peter|encyclopedia=The spread of Buddhism|title=The spread of Buddhism in Serindia|date=2007|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|location=Leiden|isbn=9789004158306|edition=online|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early Buddhism, personal verification was valued highest in attaining the truth, and sacred scriptures, reason or faith in a teacher were considered less valuable sources of authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fuller|first1=Paul|title=The notion of diṭṭhi in Theravāda Buddhism : the point of view|date=2004|publisher=[[RoutledgeCurzon]]|location=London|isbn=0-203-01043-4|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/31392862/The_notion_of_Ditthi.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1507847029&amp;Signature=ZGrJoGZcaUjL%2FEaIJ55xwsailIU%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DThe_notion_of_Ditthi.pdf|page=36}}{{dead link|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As important as faith was, it was a mere initial step to the path to [[Paññā|wisdom]] and [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]], and was obsolete or redefined at the final stage of that path.{{sfn|Lamotte|1988|pp=49–50}}{{sfn|Jayatilleke|1963|pp=384, 396–7}}

While [[faith in Buddhism]] does not imply "blind faith", Buddhist practice nevertheless requires a degree of trust, primarily in the spiritual attainment of [[Gautama Buddha]]. Faith in [[Buddhism]] centers on the understanding that the Buddha is an Awakened being, on his superior role as teacher, in the truth of his [[Dharma]] (spiritual teachings), and in his [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]] (community of spiritually developed followers). Faith in Buddhism can be summarised as faith in the [[Three Jewels]]: the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha. It is intended to lead to the goal of enlightenment, or [[bodhi]], and [[Nirvana]]. Volitionally, faith implies a resolute and courageous act of will. It combines the steadfast resolution that one will do a thing with the self-confidence that one can do it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Way of Wisdom The Five Spiritual Faculties|first= Edward |last=Conze|authorlink=Edward Conze|year=1993|url= http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/conze/wheel065.html|website=www.accesstoinsight.org|publisher=[[Buddhist Publication Society]]|isbn=978-9552401107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the role of faith increased throughout Buddhist history. However, from the nineteenth century onward, [[Buddhist modernism]] in countries like Sri Lanka and Japan, and also in the West, has downplayed and criticized the role of faith in Buddhism.

{{Main|Faith in Christianity}}
The word translated as "faith" in the New Testament is the Greek word ''πίστις'' (''pístis'') which can also be translated "belief", "faithfulness", and "trust".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/greek/4102.htm|title=Strong's Greek: 4102. πίστις (pistis) -- faith, faithfulness|work=biblehub.com|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are various views in Christianity regarding the nature of faith. Some see faith as being persuaded or convinced that something is true.&lt;ref name= Wilkin2012&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Ten Most Misunderstood Words in the Bible |year=2012 |author=Wilkin, Robert N. |page=221 |publisher=GES |location=Corinth, TX}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, a person believes something when they are presented with adequate evidence that it is true. Theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]] did not hold that faith is mere opinion: on the contrary, he held that it is a mean (understood in the Platonic sense) between excessive reliance on science (i.e. demonstration) and excessive reliance on opinion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3001.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Then there are numerous views regarding the results of faith. Some believe that true faith results in good works, while others believe that while faith in [[Jesus]] brings eternal life, it does not necessarily result in good works.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://redeeminggod.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/Faith-and-Good-Works-JD-Myers.pdf (PDF) Jeremy Myers, The Gospel Under Siege: 3 Views on the Relationship Between Faith and Good Works]"&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of which approach to faith a Christian takes, all agree that the Christian faith is aligned with the ideals and the example of the life of Jesus. The Christian sees the mystery of [[God]] and his [[Divine grace|grace]] and seeks to know and become obedient to God. To a Christian, faith is not static but causes one to learn more of God and to grow; Christian faith has its origin in God.&lt;ref name= Wuerl2004&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IzqDiPALzKEC&amp;pg=PA238&amp;dq=a#PPA237,M1 |title=The Teaching of Christ: A Catholic Catechism for Adults, Edition: 5, revised |year=2004 |author=Wuerl, By Donald W. |page=238 |isbn=1-59276-094-5 |accessdate=21 April 2009|publisher=Our Sunday Visitor Pub. Division |location=Huntingdon, IN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of faith given by the apostle Paul at Hebrews 11:1 carries particular weight with Christians that respect the Bible as the source of divine truth. There the apostle writes:

"Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen." — King James Version

"Now faith is the assurance that what we hope for will come about and the certainty that what we cannot see exists." — International Standard Version

“The naive or inexperienced person[is easily misled and believes every word he hears, but the prudent man is discreet and astute.” (Proverbs 14:15, Amplified Bible) The Christian apostle Paul wrote: “Test everything that is said to be sure it is true, and if it is, then accept it.” (1 Thessalonians 5:21, Living Bible)

In Christianity, faith causes change as it seeks a greater understanding of God. Faith is not only [[fideism]] or simple obedience to a set of rules or statements.&lt;ref&gt;Migliore, Daniel L. 2004. ''Faith seeking understanding: an introduction to Christian theology''. Grand Rapids, Mich: W.B. Eerdmans. pp. 3-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Before Christians have faith, they must understand in whom and in what they have faith. Without understanding, there cannot be true faith, and that understanding is built on the foundation of the community of believers, the scriptures and traditions and on the personal experiences of the [[belief|believer]].&lt;ref&gt;Inbody, Tyron. 2005. The faith of the Christian church: an introduction to theology. Grand Rapids, Mich: William B. Eerdmans Pub. pp. 1-10&lt;/ref&gt; In English translations of the New Testament, the word "faith" generally corresponds to the Greek noun πίστις (''pistis'') or to the Greek verb πιστεύω (''pisteuo''), meaning "to trust, to have confidence, faithfulness, to be reliable, to assure".&lt;ref name=Thomas1981&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Thomas |first1=Robert L. |last2=Editor |first2=General |year = 1981 |title= New American standard exhaustive concordance of the Bible: |pages= 1674–75 |isbn= 0-87981-197-8 |publisher= A.J.

==== Christian apologetic views ====
In contrast to noted atheist [[Richard Dawkins]]' view of faith as "blind trust, in the absence of evidence, even in the teeth of evidence",&lt;ref&gt;Richard Dawkins, The Selfish Gene. 2nd edn. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1989, 198.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alister McGrath]] quotes the Oxford Anglican theologian W. H. Griffith-Thomas (1861–1924), who states that faith is "not blind, but intelligent" and that it "commences with the conviction of the mind based on adequate evidence...", which McGrath sees as "a good and reliable definition, synthesizing the core elements of the characteristic Christian understanding of faith".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McGrath|first=Alister E.|title= The Order of Things: Explorations in Scientific Theology|year= 2008|publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn= 1-4051-2556-X|page= 33|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=WrRZBOxJzDcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American biblical scholar [[Archibald Thomas Robertson]] stated that the Greek word ''pistis'' used for faith in the New Testament (over two hundred forty times), and rendered "assurance" in Acts 17:31 (KJV), is "an old verb meaning "to furnish", used regularly by Demosthenes for bringing forward evidence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Robertson|first= Archibald Thomas|title= WORD PICTURES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT|pages= Chapter 17|url= http://www.ccel.org/ccel/robertson_at/wp_acts.xviii.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Price (Oxford Centre for Christian Apologetics) affirms that when the New Testament talks about faith positively it only uses words derived from the Greek root [pistis] which means "to be persuaded".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Price|first= Thomas|title= Faith is about 'just trusting' God isn't It?|url= http://www.bethinking.org/bible-jesus/introductory/faith-is-about-just-trusting-god-isnt-it.htm|accessdate= 23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British Christian apologist [[John Lennox]] argues that "faith conceived as belief that lacks warrant is very different from faith conceived as belief that has warrant". He states that "the use of the adjective 'blind' to describe 'faith' indicates that faith is not necessarily, or always, or indeed normally, blind". "The validity, or warrant, of faith or belief depends on the strength of the evidence on which the belief is based." "We all know how to distinguish between blind faith and evidence-based faith. We are well aware that faith is only justified if there is evidence to back it up." "Evidence-based faith is the normal concept on which we base our everyday lives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Lennox|first= John|title= Gunning for God: Why the New Atheists Are Missing the Target|year=2011|publisher=Lion|location=United kingdom|isbn= 0-7459-5322-0|page= 55|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=kxBRhMYsadwC&amp;dq=faith+defined+as+warranted+based+on+evidence&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter S Williams&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peterswilliams.com|title=Peter S. Williams|work=peterswilliams.com|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; holds that "the classic Christian tradition has always valued rationality, and does not hold that faith involves the complete abandonment of reason while believing in the teeth of evidence."{{page needed|date=February 2015}} Quoting Moreland, faith is defined as "a trust in and commitment to what we have reason to believe is true."

Regarding [[doubting Thomas]] in John 20:24-31, Williams points out that "Thomas wasn't asked to believe without evidence". He was asked to believe on the basis of the other disciples' testimony. Thomas initially lacked the first-hand experience of the evidence that had convinced them... Moreover, the reason John gives for recounting these events is that what he saw is evidence... Jesus did many other miraculous signs in the presence of his disciples...But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the son of God, and that believing ye might have life in his name. John 20:30,31.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Williams|first=  Peter S|title= A Faithful Guide to Philosophy: A Christian Introduction to the Love of Wisdom|year= 2013|publisher= Authentic Media|isbn= 1-84227-811-8|pages= Chapter 1.4 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=DCEVL-8d-J4C&amp;dq=A+Faithful+Guide+To+Philosophy:+A+Christian+Introduction+To+The+Love+Of+Wisdom&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning [[doubting Thomas]], Michael R. Allen wrote, "Thomas's definition of faith implies adherence to conceptual propositions for the sake of personal knowledge, knowledge of and about a person ''qua'' person".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allen|first1=Michael|title=The Christ's Faith: A Dogmatic Account|date=2009|publisher=T&amp;T Clark Studies in Systematic Theology|location=London|isbn=978-0-567-03399-4|page=80}}&lt;!--|accessdate=26 January 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenneth Boa and Robert M. Bowman Jr. describe a classic understanding of faith that is referred to {{by whom|date=February 2015}}as ''[[evidentialism]]'', and which is part of a larger epistemological tradition called ''classical [[foundationalism]]'', which is accompanied by ''[[deontologism]]'', which holds that humans have an obligation to regulate their beliefs in accordance with evidentialist structures.

They show how this can go too far,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Boa|first= Kenneth|author2= Robert M.Bowman|title= Faith Has Its Reasons: Integrative Approaches to Defending the Christian Faith|date= March 1, 2006|publisher= IVP Books|location= USA|isbn= 978-0-8308-5648-0|pages= 253|url= https://www.amazon.com/Faith-Has-Its-Reasons-Integrative/dp/083085648X#reader_083085648X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alvin Plantinga]] deals with it. While Plantinga upholds that faith may be the result of evidence testifying to the reliability of the source (of the truth claims), yet he sees having faith as being the result of hearing the truth of the gospel with the internal persuasion by the Holy Spirit moving and enabling him to believe. "Christian belief is produced in the believer by the internal instigation of the Holy Spirit, endorsing the teachings of Scripture, which is itself divinely inspired by the Holy Spirit. The result of the work of the Holy Spirit is faith."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Plantinga|first= Alvin|title= Warranted Christian Belief|year= 2000|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= USA|isbn= 0-19-513192-4|pages= 250, 291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Catholicism ====

The four-part ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' (CCC) gives Part One to "The Profession of Faith".  This section describes the content of faith.  It elaborates and expands particularly upon the [[Apostles' Creed]].  CCC 144 initiates a section on the "Obedience of Faith".

In the [[theology]] of [[Pope John Paul II]], faith is understood in personal terms as a trusting commitment of person to person and thus involves Christian commitment to the divine person of [[Jesus Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;

==== The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ====

Some alternative, yet impactful, ideas regarding the nature of faith were presented in a collection of sermons now presented as {{cite book|url=https://rsc.byu.edu/archived/lectures-faith-historical-perspective/lectures-faith-1990-edited-version/lecture-1|title=Lectures on Faith|}}

=== Hinduism ===
{{Main|Hinduism}}
[[Ahimsa]], also referred to as [[nonviolence]], is the fundamental tenet of Hinduism which advocates harmonious and peaceful co-existence and evolutionary growth in grace and wisdom for all humankind unconditionally.

In Hinduism, most of the Vedic prayers begins with the chants of Om. Om is the Sanskrit symbol that amazingly resonates the peacefulness ensconced within one's higher self. Om is considered to have a profound effect on the body and mind of the one who chants and also creates a calmness, serenity, healing, strength of its own to prevail within and also in the surrounding environment.

=== Islam ===
{{Main|Iman (concept)}}
In Islam, a believer's faith in the metaphysical aspects of [[Islam]] is called "Iman" ({{lang-ar|{{large|الإيمان}}}}), which is complete submission to the will of God, not unquestionable or blind belief.&lt;ref&gt;Farāhī, Majmū‘ah Tafāsīr, 2nd ed. (Faran Foundation, 1998), 347.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frederick M.

[[Muhammad]] referred to the six articles of faith in the [[Hadith of Gabriel]]: "Iman is that you believe in God and His Angels and His Books and His Messengers and the Hereafter and the good and evil fate [ordained by your God]."&lt;ref&gt;Muslim, Al-Jami‘ al-sahih, 22, (no. 93).&lt;/ref&gt; The first five are mentioned together in the Qur'an&lt;ref&gt;{{quran-usc|2|285|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Quran states that faith can grow with remembrance of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{quran-usc|8|2|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Qur'an also states that nothing in this world should be dearer to a true believer than faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{quran-usc|9|24|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Judaism ===
{{Main|Jewish principles of faith}}
Faith itself is not a religious concept in [[Judaism]]. The ''faith in God'' is mentioned in the [[Book of Genesis]] Chapter 15 verse 6 and in the [[Book of Exodus]] Chapter 4 verse 31 and in the [[Book of Isaiah]], Chapter 43 verse 10, in the 24 books of the [[Jewish Bible]]. The word translated as "faith" here is the Hebrew word אָמַן which can also be translated "believe", "reliable", and "trustworthy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/hebrew/539.htm|title=Strong's Hebrew: 539. אָמַן (aman) -- believe, reliable|work=biblehub.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Book of Isaiah]], Chapter 43 verse 10, the commandment to know [[God in Judaism|God]] is followed by the commandments to believe and to understand, thus denoting descending importance.&lt;ref name=beliefInGod&gt;{{cite web|last=Mizrachi|first=Yosef|title=Who God Is|url=http://www.divineinformation.com/who-hashem-is/|work=Audios English 5min:40sec-9min:02sec|publisher=DivineInformation.com|accessdate=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Judaism does recognize the positive value of ''Emunah''&lt;ref name="chabad"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1398519/jewish/Emunah.htm |title=What Is Emunah – Beyond Belief – Essentials |work=chabad.org |accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (generally translated as faith, trust in God) and the negative status of the ''[[Epikoros|Apikorus]]'' (heretic), but faith is not as stressed or as central as it is in other religions, especially compared with [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]. It could be a necessary means for being a practicing religious Jew, but the emphasis is placed on true [[knowledge]], true [[Prophecy#Judaism|prophecy]] and practice rather than on faith itself. Very rarely does it relate to any teaching that must be believed.&lt;ref name=beliefInGod /&gt;&lt;ref name=Brueggemann2002 /&gt; Judaism does not require one to explicitly identify God (a key tenet of [[Christian faith]], which is called [[Avodah Zarah]] in Judaism, a minor form of [[idolatry|idol worship]], a big sin and strictly forbidden to Jews). Rather, in Judaism, one is to honour a (personal) idea of God, supported by the many principles quoted in the Talmud to define Judaism, mostly by what it is not. Thus there is no established formulation of [[Jewish principles of faith]] which are mandatory for all (observant) [[Jews]].

In the Jewish scriptures trust in God – ''Emunah'' – refers to how God acts toward his people and how they are to respond to him; it is rooted in the everlasting covenant established in the [[Torah]], notably&lt;ref name=Brueggemann2002&gt;{{Cite book |last=Brueggemann |first=Walter |year=2002 |title=Reverberations of faith: a theological handbook of Old Testament themes |pages=76–78 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=dBJQ71RIpdMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=faith+in+the+old+testament |isbn=0-664-22231-5 |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |location=Louisville, Ky.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deuteronomy 7:9:

{{Quote|text= Know, therefore, that the Lord, your God He is God, the faithful God, Who keeps the covenant and loving kindness with those who love Him and keep His commandments to a thousand generations.&lt;ref&gt;(The [[Torah]] – A Modern Commentary; Union of American Hebrew Congregations, NY 1981 by W. G. Plaut)&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=[[Tanakh]]|source={{Bibleref|Deuteronomy|7:9|JPR}}}}

The specific tenets that compose required belief and their application to the times have been disputed throughout Jewish history. Today many, but not all, [[Orthodox Jew]]s have accepted [[Maimonides]]' Thirteen Principles of Belief.&lt;ref&gt;[http://studentorgs.utexas.edu/cjso/Chabad/moshiach/techiya-masim.html The 13 Principles and the Resurrection of the Dead] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060208182008/http://studentorgs.utexas.edu/cjso/Chabad/moshiach/techiya-masim.html |date=2006-02-08 }} from ''The Wolf Shall Lie With the Lamb'', Rabbi Shmuel Boteach (Oxford University)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a wide history of this dispute see: Shapiro, Marc: ''The Limits of Orthodox Theology: Maimonides' Thirteen Principles Reappraised'' (Littman Library of Jewish Civilization (Series).)&lt;/ref&gt;

A traditional example of ''Emunah'' as seen in the Jewish annals is found in the person of [[Abraham]]. On a number of occasions, Abraham both accepts statements from God that seem impossible and offers obedient actions in response to direction from God to do things that seem implausible (see [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 12-15).
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The [[Talmud]] describes how a thief also believes in G‑d: On the brink of his forced entry, as he is about to risk his life—and the life of his victim—he cries out with all sincerity, 'G‑d help me!' The thief has faith that there is a G‑d who hears his cries, yet it escapes him that this G‑d may be able to provide for him without requiring that he abrogate G‑d’s will by stealing from others. For ''emunah'' to affect him in this way he needs study and contemplation."&lt;ref name="chabad" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Sikhism ===
{{Main|Sikhism|Five Ks}}
Faith itself is not a religious concept in Sikhism. However, the five Sikh symbols, known as Kakaars or [[Five Ks]] (in Punjabi known as pañj kakkē or pañj kakār), are sometimes referred to as the ''Five articles of Faith''. The articles include ''[[Kesh (Sikhism)|kēs]]'' (uncut hair), ''[[Kanga (Sikhism)|kaṅghā]]'' (small wooden comb), ''[[Kara (Sikhism)|kaṛā]]'' (circular steel or iron bracelet), ''[[kirpan|kirpān]]'' (sword/dagger), and ''[[kaccha|kacchera]]'' (special undergarment). Baptised [[Sikhs]] are bound to wear those five articles of faith, at all times, to save them from bad company and keep them close to God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realsikhism.com/index.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1193703788&amp;ucat=5|title=Sikhism: Five Articles of Faith|work=realsikhism.com|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epistemological validity ==
There is a wide spectrum of opinion with respect to the [[epistemological]] validity of faith&lt;ref name="isbn0-06-065292-6"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[C.S. Lewis|Lewis, C.S.]] |title=[[Mere Christianity]]: a revised and amplified edition, with a new introduction, of the three books, Broadcast talks, Christian behaviour, and Beyond personality |publisher=HarperSanFrancisco |location=[[San Francisco]] |year=2001 |isbn=0-06-065292-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; - that is, whether it is a reliable way to acquire true beliefs.

=== Fideism ===
{{Main|Fideism}}
Fideism is an [[epistemology|epistemological theory]] which maintains that faith is independent of [[reason]], or that reason and faith are hostile to each other and faith is superior at arriving at particular [[truth]]s (see [[natural theology]]). Fideism is not a synonym for religious belief, but describes a particular philosophical proposition in regard to the relationship between faith's appropriate jurisdiction at arriving at truths, contrasted against reason. It states that faith is needed to determine some philosophical and religious truths, and it questions the ability of reason to arrive at all truth. The word and concept had its origin in the mid- to late-19th century by way of [[Catholic]] thought, in a movement called [[Traditionalism (Catholicism)|Traditionalism]]. The Roman Catholic [[Magisterium]] has, however, repeatedly condemned [[fideism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fideism/|title=Fideism|work=stanford.edu|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Support ===
[[Religious epistemology|Religious epistemologists]] have formulated and defended reasons for the rationality of accepting belief in God without the support of an argument.&lt;ref name=InternetReligious&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/relig-ep/ |title=Religious Epistemology |author=Clark, Kelly James |date=2 October 2004 |work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=23 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some religious epistemologists hold that belief in God is more analogous to belief in a person than belief in a scientific hypothesis. Human relations demand trust and commitment. If belief in God is more like belief in other persons, then the trust that is appropriate to persons will be appropriate to God. American [[psychologist]] and [[philosopher]] [[William James]] offers a similar argument in his lecture ''[[The Will to Believe]].''&lt;ref name=InternetReligious /&gt;&lt;ref name=WillToBelieve&gt;{{cite journal |last=James |first=William |title=1896 |journal=New World |volume=5 |pages=327–347 |url=http://educ.jmu.edu//~omearawm/ph101willtobelieve.html |accessdate=23 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Foundationalism]] is a view about the structure of justification or [[knowledge]].&lt;ref name="InternetFoundational"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/found-ep/ |title=Foundationalism |author=Poston, Ted |date=10 June 2010 |work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=23 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="InternetFoundational" /&gt; Foundationalism holds that all knowledge and [[Theory of justification|justified belief]] are ultimately based upon what are called [[Basic belief|properly basic beliefs]]. This position is intended to resolve the [[Regress argument|infinite regress]] problem in [[epistemology]]. According to foundationalism, a belief is epistemically justified only if it is justified by properly basic beliefs. One of the significant developments in foundationalism is the rise of [[reformed epistemology]].&lt;ref name=InternetFoundational /&gt;

Reformed epistemology is a view about the epistemology of religious belief, which holds that belief in God can be properly basic. [[Analytic philosophy|Analytic]] philosophers [[Alvin Plantinga]] and [[Nicholas Wolterstorff]] develop this view.&lt;ref name=Plantinga1983&gt;{{cite book |title=Faith and Rationality: Reason and Belief in God |last=Plantinga |first=Alvin |authorlink=Alvin Plantinga |author2=Nicholas Wolterstorff |year=1983 |publisher=University of Notre Dame Press |location=Notre Dame, IN |isbn=0-268-00964-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga holds that an individual may rationally believe in God even though the individual does not possess sufficient evidence to convince an agnostic. One difference between reformed epistemology and [[fideism]] is that the former requires defence against known objections, whereas the latter might dismiss such objections as irrelevant.&lt;ref name=StanfordReligious&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/religion-epistemology/ |title=The Epistemology of Religion |author=Forrest, Peter |date=11 March 2009 |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=23 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga has developed reformed epistemology in ''Warranted Christian Belief'' as a form of [[externalism]] that holds that the [[Theory of justification|justification]] conferring factors for a belief may include external factors.&lt;ref name=Plantinga2000&gt;{{cite book |title=Warranted Christian Belief |last=Plantinga |first=Alvin |authorlink=Alvin Plantinga |year=2000 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-19-513192-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Theism|theistic]] philosophers have defended theism by granting [[evidentialism]] but supporting theism through deductive arguments whose premises are considered justifiable. Some of these arguments are probabilistic, either in the sense of having weight but being inconclusive, or in the sense of having a [[probability|mathematical probability]] assigned to them.&lt;ref name=InternetReligious /&gt; Notable in this regard are the cumulative arguments presented by [[United Kingdom|British]] philosopher [[Basil Mitchell (academic)|Basil Mitchell]] and [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] philosopher [[Richard Swinburne]], whose arguments are based on [[Bayesian probability]].&lt;ref name=Mitchell1973&gt;{{cite book |title=The Justification of Religious Belief |last=Basic |first=Mitchell |authorlink=Basil Mitchell (academic) |publisher=Macmillan |location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Swinburne1979&gt;{{cite book |title=The Existence of God |last=Swinburne |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Swinburne |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a notable exposition of his arguments, Swinburne appeals to an inference for the best explanation.&lt;ref name=Forrest1996&gt;{{cite book |title=God without the Supernatural |last=Forrest |first=Peter | authorlink=Peter Forrest (philosopher) |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Swinburne1997&gt;{{cite book |title=Is there a God? |last=Swinburne |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Swinburne |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Professor of Mathematics]] and [[philosopher of science]] at [[University of Oxford]] [[John Lennox]] has stated, "Faith is not a leap in the dark; it’s the exact opposite. It’s a commitment based on [[evidence]]… It is irrational to reduce all faith to blind faith and then subject it to ridicule. That provides a very anti-intellectual and convenient way of avoiding intelligent discussion.” He criticises [[Richard Dawkins]] as a famous proponent of asserting that faith equates to holding a belief without evidence, thus that it is possible to hold belief without evidence, for failing to provide evidence for this assertion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lennox|first=John|title=God's Undertaker: Has Science Buried God?|publisher=Lion UK|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{huh|date=May 2018}}

=== Criticism ===
[[Bertrand Russell]] wrote:&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand. [http://www.skeptic.ca/Russell_Religious_Faith.htm "Will Religious Faith Cure Our Troubles?"]. ''Human Society in Ethics and Politics''. Ch 7. Pt 2. Retrieved 16 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Christians hold that their faith does good, but other faiths do harm. At any rate, they hold this about the communist faith. What I wish to maintain is that all faiths do harm. We may define “faith” as a firm belief in something for which there is no evidence. Where there is evidence, no one speaks of “faith.” We do not speak of faith that two and two are four or that the earth is round. We only speak of faith when we wish to substitute emotion for evidence. The substitution of emotion for evidence is apt to lead to strife, since different groups substitute different emotions. Christians have faith in the Resurrection; communists have faith in [[Labor theory of value|Marx’s Theory of Value]]. Neither faith can be defended rationally, and each therefore is defended by propaganda and, if necessary, by war.| Will Religious Faith Cure Our Troubles?}}

[[Evolutionary biology|Evolutionary biologist]] [[Richard Dawkins]] criticizes all faith by generalizing from specific faith in propositions that conflict directly with scientific evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|title=The God Delusion|publisher=Bantam Books|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He describes faith as belief without evidence; a process of active non-thinking. He states that it is a practice that only degrades our understanding of the natural world by allowing anyone to make a claim about nature that is based solely on their personal thoughts, and possibly distorted perceptions, that does not require testing against nature, has no ability to make reliable and consistent predictions, and is not subject to peer review.&lt;ref name="Is Science a Religion?"&gt;{{cite web|author=Dawkins, Richard |date=January–February 1997 |url=http://www.thehumanist.org/humanist/articles/dawkins.html |title=Is Science a Religion? |accessdate=15 March 2008 |publisher=American Humanist Association |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030144700/http://www.thehumanist.org/humanist/articles/dawkins.html |archivedate=30 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophy professor Peter Boghossian argues that reason and evidence are the only way to determine which "claims about the world are likely true". Different religious traditions make different religious claims, and Boghossian asserts that faith alone cannot resolve conflicts between these without evidence. He gives as an example of the belief held by that Muslims that [[Muhammad]] (who died in the year 632) was the last prophet, and the contradictory belief held by Mormons that [[Joseph Smith]] (born in 1805) was a prophet. Boghossian asserts that faith has no "built-in corrective mechanism". For factual claims, he gives the example of the belief that the Earth is 4,000 years old. With only faith and no reason or evidence, he argues, there is no way to correct this claim if it is inaccurate. Boghossian advocates thinking of faith either as "belief without evidence" or "pretending to know things you don't know".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Manual for Creating Atheists |author=Peter Boghossian |year=2013 |publisher=Pitchstone Publishing |isbn=978-1-939578-09-9 |page=31}} &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2150">To '''fillet''' in the sense of [[literary editor|literary editing]] is a form of [[censorship]] or [[redaction]] effected by "cutting out" central letters of a word or name, as if the skeleton of a fish, and replacing them with [[dash]]es, to prevent full disclosure (e.g. ''{{nowrap|W——m P——t}}'' for "[[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]]"). It was frequently practiced in publications of the 18th century in England. Its purpose was to inform interested readers in an obfuscated manner whilst at the same time avoiding the risk of being sued for illegal publication or [[defamation]] or [[libel]] by the overt naming of persons as having committed certain acts or spoken certain words. It was used for example in [[Hansard|parliamentary reports]] published in ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'' from 1738 onwards under the title of the "Debates in the Senate of [[Lilliput and Blefuscu|Magna Lilliputia]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Graham |first=Harry |title=The Mother of Parliaments |location=[[Boston, Mass.]] |date=1911 |pages=279–80 |url=https://archive.org/stream/motherofparliame00grah/motherofparliame00grah_djvu.txt |via=[[Internet Archive]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which in order to circumvent the prohibition of the publication of parliamentary debates of the English Parliament the real names of the various orators were filleted or replaced by [[pseudonym]]s or [[anagram]]s;&lt;ref&gt;For example ''Sholmlng'' for [[Marquess of Cholmondeley|Cholmondeley]] and  ''Ptit'' for [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|Pitt]]&lt;/ref&gt; for example, Sir [[Robert Walpole]] was thinly disguised as ''{{nowrap|Sr. R——t W——le}}''.&lt;ref name="Trewin"&gt;{{cite book |last=Trewin |first=J.C |title=Printer to the House: The Story of Hansard |year=1952 |publisher=The Chapel River Press |location=[[Andover, Hampshire]] |page=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was often performed not to avoid legal action but merely to show deference to the privacy of some great personage, or not to offend his imputed sense of modesty by naming him as the author of some great or worthy deed or act.

{{Buddhism}}
The '''four stages of enlightenment''' in [[Theravada]] [[Buddhism]] are the four progressive stages culminating in full [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] as an [[Arhat|Arahant]].

These four stages are [[Sotāpanna|Sotāpanna]], [[Sakadagami|Sakadāgāmi]], [[Anāgāmi]], and Arahant. The Buddha referred to people who are at one of these four stages as noble people (''ariya-puggala'') and the community of such persons as the noble sangha (''ariya-sangha'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ajaan Lee Dhammadharo|title=What is the Triple Gem?|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/thai/lee/triplegem.html|accessdate=August 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sangha|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/sangha.html|accessdate=August 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= A Path to Freedom: A Self-guided Tour of the Buddha's Teachings|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/|accessdate=August 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The teaching of the four stages of enlightenment is a central element of the [[early Buddhist schools]], including the [[Theravada]] school of Buddhism, which still survives.

==Origins==
In the [[Sutta Pitaka]] several types of Buddhist practitioners are described, according to their level of attainment. The standard is four, but there are also longer descriptions with more types. The four are the Stream-enterer, Once-returner, Non-returner and the Arahant.

In the [[Visuddhimagga]] the four stages are the culmination of the seven purifications. The descriptions are elaborated and harmonized, giving the same sequence of purifications before attaining each of the four paths and fruits.

The Visuddhimagga stresses the importance of [[Wisdom in Buddhism|prajna]], insight into [[anatta]] and the Buddhist teachings, as the main means to liberation. [[Vipassana]] has a central role in this. Insight is emphasized by the contemporary [[Vipassana movement]].

==Path and Fruit==
A '''[[Stream-enterer]]''' ([[Sotapanna]]) is free from:
*1. Identity view
*2. Attachment to rites and rituals
*3. Doubt about the teachings

A '''[[Once-returner]]''' ([[Sakadagami]]) has greatly attenuated:
*4. Sensual desire
*5. Ill will

A '''[[Non-returner]]''' ([[Anāgāmi]]) is free from:
*4. Sensual desire
*5. Ill will

An '''[[Arahant]]''' is free from all of the five lower fetters and the five higher fetters, which are:
*6. Attachment to the four meditative absorptions having form (rupa jhana)
*7.  Attachment to the four formless absorptions (ārupa jhana)
*8. Conceit
*9. Restlessness
*10. Ignorance

The [[Sutta Pitaka]] classifies the four levels according to the levels' attainments. In the [[Sthavira nikāya|Sthaviravada]] and Theravada traditions, which teach that progress in understanding comes all at once, and that 'insight' (''abhisamaya'') does not come 'gradually' (successively - ''anapurva''),"{{sfn|Warder|2000|p=284}} this classification is further elaborated, with each of the four levels described as a path to be attained suddenly, followed by the realisation of the fruit of the path.

The process of becoming an Arahat is therefore characterized by four distinct and sudden changes, although in the sutras it says that the path has a gradual development, with gnosis only after a long stretch, just as the ocean has a gradual shelf, a gradual inclination with a sudden drop only after a long stretch. The Mahasanghika had the doctrine of ''ekaksana-citt'', "according to which a Buddha knows everything in a single thought-instant" (Gomez 1991, p.&amp;nbsp;69). The same stance is taken in [[Chan Buddhism]], although the Chán school harmonized this point of view with the need for gradual training after the initial insight.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} This "gradual training" is expressed in teachings as [[Five Ranks|the Five ranks of enlightenment]], [[Ten Bulls|Ten Ox-Herding Pictures]] which detail the steps on the Path, [[Linji Yixuan#Expressing the inexpressible|The Three mysterious Gates]] of Linji, and the [[Hakuin#Four ways of knowing|Four Ways of Knowing]] of [[Hakuin]]. The same stance is taken in the contemporary [[Vipassana movement]], especially the so-called [[U Nārada|"New Burmese Method"]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Armstrong|first=Steve|title=The Practical Dharma of Mahasi Sayadaw|url=http://www.buddhistgeeks.com/2010/04/the-practical-dharma-of-mahasi-sayadaw/|publisher=[[Buddhist Geeks]]|accessdate=August 13, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503164438/http://www.buddhistgeeks.com/2010/04/the-practical-dharma-of-mahasi-sayadaw/|archivedate=May 3, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ordinary person==
An ordinary person or ''puthujjana'' ([[Pali]]; [[Sanskrit]]: {{IAST|pṛthagjana}}i.e. pritha : without, and jnana : knowledge) is trapped in the endless cycling of [[Samsara|{{IAST|samsara}}]]. One is reborn, lives, and dies in endless rebirths, either as a [[Deva (Buddhism)|deva]], human, animal, male, female, neuter, ghost, asura, hell being, or various other entities on different categories of existence.

An ordinary entity has never seen and experienced the ultimate truth of [[Dharma]] and therefore has no way of finding an end to the predicament. It is only when suffering becomes acute, or seemingly unending, that an entity looks for a "solution" to and, if fortunate, finds the Dharma.

==The four stages of attainment==
{{StagesFettersRebirths|notes=1}}
The Sangha of the Tathagata's disciples (Ariya Sangha) can be described as including four or eight kinds of individuals. There are four [groups of noble disciples] when path and fruit are taken as pairs, and eight groups of individuals, when each path and fruit are taken separately:
# (1) the path to stream-entry; (2) the fruition of stream-entry;
# (3) the path to once-returning; (4) the fruition of once-returning;
# (5) the path to non-returning; (6) the fruition of non-returning;
# (7) the path to arahantship; (8) the fruition of arahantship.

===Stream-enterer===
{{main|Sotāpanna}}
The first stage is that of [[Sotāpanna]] ([[Pali]]; [[Sanskrit]]: {{IAST|Srotāpanna}}), literally meaning "one who enters ({{IAST|āpadyate}}) the stream (sotas)," with the stream being the supermundane [[Noble Eightfold Path]] regarded as the highest Dharma. The stream-enterer is also said to have "opened the eye of the Dharma" (dhammacakkhu, Sanskrit: {{IAST|dharmacakṣus}}).

A stream-enterer reaches arahantship within seven rebirths upon opening the eye of the Dharma.

Because the stream-enterer has attained an intuitive grasp of Buddhist doctrine ({{IAST|samyagdṛṣṭi}} or {{IAST|sammādiṭṭhi}}, "right view") and has complete confidence or [[Saddha]] in the [[Three Jewels]]: [[Buddhahood|Buddha]], [[Dharma]], and [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]], and has removed the sankharas that force rebirth in lower planes, that individual will not be reborn in any plane lower than the human (animal, [[preta]], or in [[Naraka (Buddhism)|hell]]).

===Once-returner===
{{main|Sakadagami}}
The second stage is that of the {{IAST|Sakadāgāmī}} (Sanskrit: {{IAST|Sakṛdāgāmin}}), literally meaning "one who once ({{IAST|sakṛt}}) comes ({{IAST|āgacchati}})". The once-returner will at most return to the realm of the senses (the lowest being human and the highest being the devas wielding power over the creations of others) one more time. Both the stream-enterer and the once-returner have abandoned the first three fetters. The stream-enterer and once-returner are distinguished by the fact that the once-returner has weakened lust, hate, and delusion to a greater degree. The once-returner therefore has fewer than seven rebirths. Once-returners do not have only one more rebirth, as the name suggests, for that may not even be said with certainty about the non-returner who can take multiple rebirths in the five "Pure Abodes". They do, however, only have one more rebirth in the realm of the senses, excluding, of course, the planes of hell, animals and hungry ghosts.

===Non-returner===
{{main|Anāgāmi}}

The third stage is that of the {{IAST|Anāgāmī}} (Sanskrit: {{IAST|Anāgāmin}}), literally meaning "one who does not (an-) come ({{IAST|'''āgacchati'''}})". The non-returner, having overcome sensuality, does not return to the human world, or any unfortunate world lower than that, after death. Instead, non-returners are [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|reborn]] in one of the five special worlds in [[Buddhist cosmology#Form Realm (Rūpadhātu)|Rūpadhātu]] called the [[Buddhist cosmology#Pure Abodes|{{IAST|Śuddhāvāsa}} worlds]], or "Pure Abodes", and there attain [[Nirvana|{{IAST|Nirvāṇa}}]]; Pāli: Nibbana; some of them are reborn a second time in a higher world of the Pure Abodes.

An {{IAST|Anāgāmī}} has abandoned the five lower fetters, out of ten total fetters, that bind beings to the [[Samsara (Buddhism)|cycle of rebirth]]. An {{IAST|Anāgāmī}} is well-advanced.

===Arahant===
{{Main|Arahant}}
The fourth stage is that of [[Arahant]] (Sanskrit: ''Arhat''), a fully awakened person. They have abandoned all ten fetters and, upon death (Sanskrit: [[Parinirvana|{{IAST|Parinirvāṇa}}]], Pāli: {{IAST|Parinibbāna}}) will never be reborn in any plane or world, having wholly escaped [[Samsara (Buddhism)|{{IAST|saṃsāra}}]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/sangha.html Sangha]&lt;/ref&gt; An Arahant has attained awakening by following the path given by the Buddha. In [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]] the term ''Buddha'' is reserved for ones who "self-enlighten" such as Siddhartha Gautama Buddha, who discovered the path by himself.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16482">There are two fundamental [[theorems]] of [[welfare economics]]. The First Theorem states that a [[Market (economics)|market]] will tend toward a [[competitive equilibrium]] that is weakly [[Pareto optimal]] when the market maintains the following three attributes:&lt;ref&gt;http://web.stanford.edu/~hammond/effMktFail.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

1. [[Complete market]]s as no [[transaction costs]] and because of this each actor also has [[perfect information]].

2. [[Price-taking]] behavior as no monopolists and easy entry and exit from a market.

Furthermore, the First Theorem states that the equilibrium will be fully Pareto optimal with the additional condition of:

3. [[local nonsatiation|Local nonsatiation of preferences]] as for any original bundle of goods there is another bundle of goods arbitrarily close to the original bundle, but that is preferred.

The Second Theorem states that out of all possible Pareto optimal outcomes one can achieve any particular one by enacting a [[lump-sum]] wealth redistribution and then letting the market take over.

== Implications of the First Theorem ==

The First Theorem is often taken to be an analytical confirmation of [[Adam Smith]]'s "[[invisible hand]]" hypothesis, namely that ''competitive markets tend toward an efficient allocation of resources''. The theorem supports a case for non-intervention in ideal conditions: let the markets do the work and the outcome will be Pareto efficient.  However, Pareto efficiency is not necessarily the same thing as desirability; it merely indicates that no one can be made better off without someone being made worse off.  There can be many possible Pareto efficient allocations of resources and not all of them may be equally desirable by society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author-link=Joseph E. Stiglitz|first=Joseph E.|last=Stiglitz|title=Whither Socialism?|date=1994|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0-262-69182-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This appears to make the case that intervention has a legitimate place in policy &amp;ndash; redistributions can allow us to select from all efficient outcomes for one that has other desired features, such as distributional equity. The shortcoming is that for the theorem to hold, the transfers have to be lump-sum and the government needs to have perfect information on individual consumers' tastes as well as the production possibilities of firms. An additional mathematical condition is that preferences and production technologies have to be [[convex preferences|convex]].&lt;ref name="AndreuMas95"&gt;{{citation|author-link=Andreu Mas-Colell|last1=Mas-Colell|first1=Andreu| first2=Michael D.|last2=Whinston|first3=Jerry R.|last3=Green|year=1995|title=Microeconomic Theory|chapter=Chapter 16: Equilibrium and its Basic Welfare Properties|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn= 0-19-510268-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Proof of the First Theorem ===

The first fundamental theorem was first demonstrated graphically by economist [[Abba Lerner]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} and mathematically by economists [[Harold Hotelling]], [[Oskar Lange]], [[Maurice Allais]], [[Lionel W. McKenzie|Lionel McKenzie]], [[Kenneth Arrow]] and [[Gérard Debreu]]. The theorem holds under general conditions.&lt;ref name="AndreuMas95"/&gt;

The formal statement of the theorem is as follows: ''If preferences are locally nonsatiated, and if &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{X^*},\mathbf{Y^*}, \mathbf{p})&lt;/math&gt; is a price equilibrium with transfers, then the allocation &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{X^*},\mathbf{Y^*})&lt;/math&gt;is Pareto optimal.''  An equilibrium in this sense either relates to an exchange economy only or presupposes that firms are allocatively and productively efficient, which can be shown to follow from perfectly competitive factor and production markets.&lt;ref name="AndreuMas95"/&gt;

Given a set &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; of types of goods we work in the real vector space over &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{G}&lt;/math&gt; and use boldface for vector valued variables.  For instance, if &lt;math&gt;G=\lbrace \text{butter}, \text{cookies}, \text{milk} \rbrace&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{G}&lt;/math&gt; would be a three dimensional vector space and the vector &lt;math&gt;\langle 1, 2, 3 \rangle&lt;/math&gt; would represent the bundle of goods containing one unit of butter, 2 units of cookies and 3 units of milk.

Suppose that consumer ''i'' has wealth &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_i w_i = \mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{e} + \Sigma _j \mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{y^*_j}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{e} &lt;/math&gt; is the aggregate endowment of goods (i.e. the sum of all consumer and producer endowments) and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y^*_j}&lt;/math&gt; is the production of firm ''j''.

Preference maximization (from the definition of price equilibrium with transfers) implies (using &lt;math&gt; &gt;_i&lt;/math&gt; to denote the preference relation for consumer ''i''):

::if &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x_i} &gt;_i \mathbf{x^*_i}&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{x_i} &gt; \mathbf{w_i}&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, if a bundle of goods is strictly preferred to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x^*_i}&lt;/math&gt; it must be unaffordable at price &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt;.  Local nonsatiation additionally implies:

::if &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x_i} \geq _i \mathbf{x^*_i}&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{x_i} \geq \mathbf{w_i}&lt;/math&gt;

To see why, imagine that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x_i} \geq _i \mathbf{x^*_i}&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{x_i} &lt; w_i&lt;/math&gt;.  Then by local nonsatiation we could find &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x'_i}&lt;/math&gt; arbitrarily close to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x_i}&lt;/math&gt; (and so still affordable) but which is strictly preferred to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x^*_i}&lt;/math&gt;.  But &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x^*_i}&lt;/math&gt; is the result of preference maximization, so this is a contradiction.

An allocation is a pair &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{X},\mathbf{Y})&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X} \in \Pi_{i \in I} \mathbb{R}^{G} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Y} \in \Pi_{j \in J} \mathbb{R}^{G} &lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}&lt;/math&gt; is the 'matrix' (allowing potentially infinite rows/columns) whose ''i''th column is the bundle of goods allocated to consumer ''i'' and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Y}&lt;/math&gt; is the 'matrix' whose ''j''th column is the production of firm ''j''.  We restrict our attention to feasible allocations which are those allocations in which no consumer sells or producer consumes goods which they lack, i.e.,for every good and every consumer that consumers initial endowment plus their net demand must be positive similarly for producers.

Now consider an allocation &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{X},\mathbf{Y})&lt;/math&gt; that Pareto dominates &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{X^*}, Y^*)&lt;/math&gt;.  This means that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x_i} \geq _i \mathbf{x^*_i}&lt;/math&gt; for all ''i'' and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x_i} &gt;_i \mathbf{x^*_i}&lt;/math&gt; for some ''i''.  By the above, we know &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{x_i} \geq w_i&lt;/math&gt; for all ''i'' and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{x_i} &gt; w_i&lt;/math&gt; for some ''i''.  Summing, we find:

::&lt;math&gt;\Sigma _i \mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{x_i} &gt; \Sigma _i w_i =  \Sigma _j \mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{y^*_j}&lt;/math&gt;.

Because &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{Y^*}&lt;/math&gt; is profit maximizing, we know &lt;math&gt; \Sigma _j \mathbf{p} \cdot y^*_j \geq \Sigma _j p \cdot y_j &lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;\Sigma _i \mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{x_i} &gt;  \Sigma _j \mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{y_j}&lt;/math&gt;.  But goods must be conserved so &lt;math&gt;\Sigma _i \mathbf{x_i} &gt;  \Sigma _j \mathbf{y_j}&lt;/math&gt;.  Hence, &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{X},\mathbf{Y})&lt;/math&gt; is not feasible.  Since all Pareto-dominating allocations are not feasible, &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{X^*},\mathbf{Y^*})&lt;/math&gt; must itself be Pareto optimal.&lt;ref name="AndreuMas95" /&gt;

Note that while the fact that &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{Y^*}&lt;/math&gt; is profit maximizing is simply assumed in the statement of the theorem the result is only useful/interesting to the extent such a profit maximizing allocation of production is possible.  Fortunately, for any restriction of the production allocation &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{Y^*}&lt;/math&gt; and price to a closed subset on which the marginal price is bounded away from 0, e.g., any reasonable choice of continuous functions to parameterize possible productions, such a maximum exists.  This follows from the fact that the minimal marginal price and finite wealth limits the maximum feasible production (0 limits the minimum) and [[Tychonoff's theorem]] ensures the product of these compacts spaces is compact ensuring us a maximum of whatever continuous function we desire exists.

== Proof of the second fundamental theorem ==

The Second Theorem formally states that, under the assumptions that every production set &lt;math&gt;Y_j&lt;/math&gt; is [[convex set|convex]] and every preference relation &lt;math&gt;\geq _i&lt;/math&gt; is convex and [[local nonsatiation|locally nonsatiated]], any desired Pareto-efficient allocation can be supported as a price ''quasi''-equilibrium with transfers.&lt;ref name="AndreuMas95" /&gt; Further assumptions are needed to prove this statement for price equilibria with transfers.

The proof proceeds in two steps: first, we prove that any Pareto-efficient allocation can be supported as a price quasi-equilibrium with transfers; then, we give conditions under which a price quasi-equilibrium is also a price equilibrium.

Let us define a price quasi-equilibrium with transfers as an allocation &lt;math&gt;(x^*,y^*)&lt;/math&gt;, a price vector ''p'', and a vector of wealth levels ''w'' (achieved by lump-sum transfers) with &lt;math&gt;\Sigma _i w_i = p \cdot \omega + \Sigma _j p \cdot y^*_j&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt; \omega &lt;/math&gt; is the aggregate endowment of goods and &lt;math&gt;y^*_j&lt;/math&gt; is the production of firm ''j'') such that:

::i. &lt;math&gt;p \cdot y_j \leq p \cdot y_j^*&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;y_j \in Y_j&lt;/math&gt; (firms maximize profit by producing &lt;math&gt;y_j^*&lt;/math&gt;)
::ii. For all ''i'', if &lt;math&gt;x_i &gt;_i x_i^*&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;p \cdot x_i \geq w_i&lt;/math&gt; (if &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; is strictly preferred to &lt;math&gt;x_i^*&lt;/math&gt; then it cannot cost less than &lt;math&gt;x_i^*&lt;/math&gt;)
::iii. &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_i x_i^* = \omega + \Sigma _j y_j^*&lt;/math&gt; (budget constraint satisfied)

The only difference between this definition and the standard definition of a price equilibrium with transfers is in statement (''ii''). The inequality is weak here (&lt;math&gt;p \cdot x_i \geq w_i&lt;/math&gt;) making it a price quasi-equilibrium. Later we will strengthen this to make a price equilibrium.&lt;ref name="AndreuMas95" /&gt;
Define &lt;math&gt;V_i&lt;/math&gt; to be the set of all consumption bundles strictly preferred to &lt;math&gt;x_i^*&lt;/math&gt; by consumer ''i'', and let ''V'' be the sum of all &lt;math&gt;V_i&lt;/math&gt;.  &lt;math&gt;V_i&lt;/math&gt; is convex due to the convexity of the preference relation &lt;math&gt;\geq _i&lt;/math&gt;.  ''V'' is convex because every &lt;math&gt;V_i&lt;/math&gt; is convex. Similarly &lt;math&gt;Y + \{\omega\}&lt;/math&gt;, the union of all production sets &lt;math&gt;Y_i&lt;/math&gt; plus the aggregate endowment, is convex because every &lt;math&gt;Y_i&lt;/math&gt; is convex. We also know that the intersection of ''V'' and &lt;math&gt;Y + \{\omega\}&lt;/math&gt; must be empty, because if it were not it would imply there existed a bundle that is strictly preferred to &lt;math&gt;(x^*,y^*)&lt;/math&gt; by everyone and is also affordable. This is ruled out by the Pareto-optimality of &lt;math&gt;(x^*,y^*)&lt;/math&gt;.

These two convex, non-intersecting sets allow us to apply the [[separating hyperplane theorem]]. This theorem states that there exists a price vector &lt;math&gt;p \neq 0&lt;/math&gt; and a number ''r'' such that &lt;math&gt;p \cdot z \geq r&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;z \in V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p \cdot z \leq r&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;z \in Y + \{\omega\}&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, there exists a price vector that defines a hyperplane that perfectly separates the two convex sets.

Next we argue that if &lt;math&gt;x_i \geq _i x_i^*&lt;/math&gt; for all ''i'' then &lt;math&gt;p \cdot (\Sigma _i x_i) \geq r&lt;/math&gt;. This is due to local nonsatiation: there must be a bundle &lt;math&gt;x'_i&lt;/math&gt; arbitrarily close to &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; that is strictly preferred to &lt;math&gt;x_i^*&lt;/math&gt; and hence part of &lt;math&gt;V_i&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;p \cdot (\Sigma _i x'_i) \geq r&lt;/math&gt;. Taking the limit as &lt;math&gt;x'_i \rightarrow x_i&lt;/math&gt; does not change the weak inequality, so &lt;math&gt;p \cdot (\Sigma _i x_i) \geq r&lt;/math&gt; as well. In other words, &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; is in the [[closure (mathematics)|closure]] of ''V''.

Using this relation we see that for &lt;math&gt;x_i^*&lt;/math&gt; itself &lt;math&gt;p \cdot (\Sigma _i x_i^*) \geq r&lt;/math&gt;. We also know that &lt;math&gt;\Sigma _i x_i^* \in Y + \{\omega\}&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;p \cdot (\Sigma _i x_i^*) \leq r&lt;/math&gt; as well. Combining these we find that &lt;math&gt;p \cdot (\Sigma _i x_i^*) = r&lt;/math&gt;. We can use this equation to show that &lt;math&gt;(x^*,y^*,p)&lt;/math&gt; fits the definition of a price quasi-equilibrium with transfers.

Because &lt;math&gt;p \cdot (\Sigma _i x_i^*) = r&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Sigma _i x_i^* = \omega + \Sigma _j y_j^*&lt;/math&gt; we know that for any firm j:

::&lt;math&gt;p \cdot (\omega + y_j + \Sigma_h y_h^*) \leq r = p \cdot (\omega + y_j^* + \Sigma_h y_h^*)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;h \neq j&lt;/math&gt;

which implies &lt;math&gt;p \cdot y_j \leq p \cdot y_j^*&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly we know:

::&lt;math&gt;p \cdot (x_i + \Sigma_k x_k^*) \geq r = p \cdot (x_i^* + \Sigma_k x_k^*)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;k \neq i&lt;/math&gt;

which implies &lt;math&gt;p \cdot x_i \geq p \cdot x_i^*&lt;/math&gt;. These two statements, along with the feasibility of the allocation at the Pareto optimum, satisfy the three conditions for a price quasi-equilibrium with transfers supported by wealth levels &lt;math&gt;w_i = p \cdot x_i^*&lt;/math&gt; for all ''i''.

We now turn to conditions under which a price quasi-equilibrium is also a price equilibrium, in other words, conditions under which the statement "if &lt;math&gt;x_i &gt;_i x_i^*&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;p \cdot x_i \geq w_i&lt;/math&gt;" imples "if &lt;math&gt;x_i &gt;_i x_i^*&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;p \cdot x_i &gt; w_i&lt;/math&gt;". For this to be true we need now to assume that the consumption set &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; is convex and the preference relation &lt;math&gt;\geq _i&lt;/math&gt; is [[continuous function|continuous]]. Then, if there exists a consumption vector &lt;math&gt;x'_i&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x'_i \in X_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p \cdot x'_i &lt; w_i&lt;/math&gt;, a price quasi-equilibrium is a price equilibrium.

To see why, assume to the contrary &lt;math&gt;x_i &gt;_i x_i^*&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p \cdot x_i = w_i&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; exists. Then by the convexity of &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; we have a bundle &lt;math&gt;x''_i = \alpha x_i + (1 - \alpha)x'_i \in X_i&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;p \cdot x''_i &lt; w_i&lt;/math&gt;. By the continuity of &lt;math&gt;\geq _i&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; close to 1 we have &lt;math&gt;\alpha x_i + (1 - \alpha)x'_i &gt;_i x_i^*&lt;/math&gt;. This is a contradiction, because this bundle is preferred to &lt;math&gt;x_i^*&lt;/math&gt; and costs less than &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt;.

Hence, for price quasi-equilibria to be price equilibria it is sufficient that the consumption set be convex, the preference relation to be continuous, and for there always to exist a "cheaper" consumption bundle &lt;math&gt;x'_i&lt;/math&gt;. One way to ensure the existence of such a bundle is to require wealth levels &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt; to be strictly positive for all consumers ''i''.&lt;ref name="AndreuMas95" /&gt;

== Related theorems ==

Because of welfare economics' close ties to [[social choice theory]], [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]] is sometimes listed as a third fundamental theorem.&lt;ref&gt;* {{citation|last=Feldman|first=Allan M.|year=2008|title=Welfare Economics|work=The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics|volume=4|pp=889–95|edition=online|url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_W000050|accessdate=9 June 2014|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideal conditions of the theorems, however are an abstraction. The [[Joseph Stiglitz#Information asymmetry|Greenwald-Stiglitz theorem]], for example, states that in the presence of either [[perfect information|imperfect information]], or incomplete markets, markets are not Pareto efficient. Thus, in real world economies, the degree of these variations from ideal conditions must factor into policy choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author-link=Joseph E. Stiglitz|first=Joseph E.|last=Stiglitz|doi=10.3386/w3641 |title=The Invisible Hand and Modern Welfare Economics |work=NBER Working Paper No. W3641 |date=March 1991 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Further, even if these ideal conditions hold, the First Welfare Theorem fails in an [[overlapping generations model]].

'''Grand Comoro day gecko''' ('''''Phelsuma v-nigra comoraegrandensis''''' &lt;small&gt;[[Harald Meier|Meier]], 1986&lt;/small&gt;) is a small [[diurnal animal|diurnal]] [[subspecies]] of [[gecko]]s. It lives in the [[Comoros]] and typically inhabits trees and bushes. The Grand Comoro day gecko feeds on insects and nectar.

== Description ==
This lizard belongs to the smallest day geckos. It can reach a maximum length of approximately 10&amp;nbsp;cm. The body colour is bright green, which may have a blue hue. There is a red v-shaped stripe on the snout and two red bars between the eyes. On the back there often are a large number of small red-brick coloured dots which may form a faint mid dorsal stripe. The flanks are grey. There is a v-shaped marking on the throat. The ventral side is yellowish white. This lizard also does not have eyelids like all day geckos.

== Distribution ==
This species only inhabits the island Grand Comoro in the Comoros.

== Habitat ==
''Phelsuma v-nigra comoraegrandensis'' inhabits moist forests, palm trees and human dwellings.

== Diet ==
These day geckos feed on various insects and other invertebrates. They also like to lick soft, sweet fruit, pollen, and nectar.

== Reproduction ==
At a temperature of 28&amp;nbsp;°C, the young will hatch after approximately 45 days. The juveniles measure 35&amp;nbsp;mm.

== Care and maintenance in captivity ==
These animals should be housed in pairs and need a medium-sized, well planted terrarium. The daytime temperature should be between 28 and 30&amp;nbsp;°C and 24 and 26&amp;nbsp;°C at night. The humidity should be around 75&amp;ndash;90%. In captivity, these animals can be fed with crickets, wax moth larvae, fruit flies, mealworms, and houseflies.

The '''Gwangmu Reform''' (광무개혁,光武改革, ''Gwangmu Gaehyeok'') was a chain of events that was aimed at modernizing and westernizing the [[Korean Empire]] as a late starter in the [[industrial revolution]]. The reform that took place during the Gwangmu Era from 1897 to 1907 showed, in the long term, Korean potential for starting and continuing modernisation, even in the face of adversity. This sort of development was unseen until the [[Chang Myon|Myon Chang]]-era of the 1960s and 70s. The Gwangmu reform of [[Gojong of the Korean Empire|Emperor Gojong]] later staged the fundamental background for future Korean development by building infrastructure, reforming the economy and creating the nucleus of the modern [[bureaucracy]] and military.

==Reforms==

===Abolition of the status system===
Following the collapse of the [[Enlightenment Party|Gabo government]] proclaiming the abolition of the status system, the loyalists’ cabinet was formed in 1896. The new cabinet, which became the Gwangmu government after the establishment of the Korean Empire, introduced systematic measures for abolishing the traditional class system. One of these was the new household registration system, reflecting the goals of formal [[social equality]], which was implemented by the loyalists’ cabinet. Whereas the old registration system signified household members according to their hierarchical social status, the new system called for an occupation.&lt;ref name="proper"&gt;Hwang, Kyung Moon (2004), University of Southern California. ''Citizenship, Social Equality and Government Reform: Changes in the Household Registration System in Korea, 1894-1910''&lt;/ref&gt;

Although most Koreans by that time had surnames and even [[bongwan]], a substantial number of [[cheonmin]], which mostly consisted of [[serfs]] and slaves, and [[Baekjeong|untouchables]] still did not. According to the new system, they were then required to fill in the blanks for surname in order to be registered as constituting separate households. Instead of creating their own family name, some cheonmins appropriated their masters’ surnames, while others simply took the most common surname and its bongwan in the local area. Along with this example, activists within and outside the Korean government had based their visions of a new relationship between the government and people through the concept of citizenship, employing the term ''Inmin''(people) and later, ''Kungmin''(citizen).&lt;ref name="proper"/&gt;
[[Image:Koreansoldiers1898.jpg|thumb|170px|right|The modernised army of the Korean Empire.]]

===Lifestyle===
During the Gwangmu period, Western-style official [[uniform]]s were introduced in Korea. At the start, the Korean Emperor had begun to wear [[Prussian]]-style royal attire along with Korean diplomats, who wore Western suits. In 1900, Western attire became the official uniform for the Korean civil officials. Several years later, all Korean soldiers and policemen were required to wear Western style uniforms.

===Military===

In the military sphere, the Korean army as it existed in the early 1890s consisted of about 5,000 soldiers and was increased to an immense amount of 28,000 right before the [[Russo-Japanese War]]. Training by Russian officers beginning in 1896 led to the organization of a 1,000-strong royal bodyguard armed with [[Berdan rifle]]s that served as the core of an improved army. From this core unit, soldiers were sometimes transferred to other units, which included five regiments of about 900 men each.{{sfn|Keltie|1900|p=791}}

===Finance===
[[File:Office of Crown Property.jpg|thumb|160px|left|The building of Office of Crown Property under Imperial Household Ministry of the Korean Empire.]]
In 1897, the [[cadastral]] survey project was launched by the Gwangmu government, aiming at modernizing the [[landownership]] system. In order to apply Western surveying methods, U.S. surveyors were hired. After the survey, a property title “Jigye”, showing the exact dimension of the land, were supposed to be issued by the authorities concerned. That reform was closely involved to the reform of land tax system, which was conducted under the leadership of Yi Yong-ik, who also carried out the monetary reforms in Korea. The project was interrupted due to the [[Russo-Japanese war]] of 1904 and 1905, after having finished about two-thirds of the whole land.

===Infrastructures===
[[Image:Chongno1905.jpg|thumb|190px|right|Seoul, capital city of the Korean Empire in 1905, showing contrast between tradition and modernity.]]
[[File:Streetcar1903.jpg|thumb|160px|left|A streetcar in Seoul, 1903.]]
In that time, modern urban [[infrastructures]] were built by the Gwangmu government. In 1898, Gwangmu Emperor authorized the creation of a [[joint venture]] with American businessmen. In consequence, [[Hanseong Electric Company]], operating a public electrical lightning network and an electric [[streetcar]] system was founded. And Seoul Fresh Spring Water Company had an American connection as well. In 1902, six years after the first introduction of telephone in Korea, the first long-distance public phone was installed.

===Industries===

During the Gwangmu period, the industrial promotion policy was also conducted by the Korean government. It gave support to found technical and industrial schools. In that time, along with modernized weaving factories which were established to meet demand for [[textiles]] on the domestic market, technological innovations in the field of weaving industry occurred in Korea. For instance, spinning and weaving machines were made for producing [[silk]], so as to be substituted for high-cost machines from abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Jae-gon Cho ''The Industrial Promotion Policy and Commercial Structure of the Taehan Empire.'' Seoul: Jimoondang Publishing Company (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===

[[File:Severance Hospital in 1904.jpg|thumb|170px|right|The building of Jejungwon (Severance) Hospital in 1904.]]
After [[Gojong of the Korean Empire|Gojong]] proclaimed a new education law, elementary schools were established by the government. Along with these modern [[state school|public schools]], a number of Western-style schools, consisting of elementary and/or [[secondary education]] section(s), were established by Western missionaries.

During the Gwangmu period, modern secondary schools were opened by the Korean government as well, along with private secondary schools established by rich Korean civilians or Korean modern intellectuals. And several years later, modern [[higher education]] was first introduced to Korea: In 1904, the [[Jejungwon]](Severance Hospital) in Seoul, added Severance Hospital Medical School and the attached School of Nursing. In 1905, [[Korea University#Bosung College|Bosung College]] was established under [[Yi Yong-ik]], Chief of the Imperial Treasury: the Commerce Department and the Law Department were the first two departments of the college. The Soongsil Academy, started at Pyongyang in 1897, had opened a college section in 1905 and was authorized as the [[Soongsil University]] by the Korean government in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;Abe, Hiroshi (1971), ''Higher Learning in Korea under Japanese Rule'' The Developing Economies, 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Education Ordinance of 1911 issued by Japanese [[Governor-General of Korea]], however, these institutions lost college status.
During the period of 1885-1910, a total of 796 schools, from elementary to college levels, were established and maintained by the Western missionaries. This is a significant number in that it comprises about thirty-five percent of the entire number of formal schools (2,250) in the Korean Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Insoo Sohn, ''History of Korean Education'', 2 vols. (Seoul Muneumsa,1987)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[:ja:矢橋賢吉Yabashi Kenkichi]] is correct.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Health care system===

The modern [[health care system]] in Korea had been formed for about 30 years since opening the country in 1876. Most of the system had been achieved during the Gwangmu Reform period directed by the Emperor and his followers.&lt;ref&gt;D.W. Shin, S.I. Hwang (1996). ''The Historical Interpretation on the Formation of the Modern Health Care System in Late Choson.''&lt;/ref&gt; The new system consisted of three sectors: public health, medical care, and monitoring of private practitioners and drug-sellers. The Sanitary Board was set to provide systematic public health care such as [[vaccination]], [[sanitation]] and [[quarantine]] and the police were created to enforce many sanitary affairs. Hospitals for Western medicine were established in the medical care sector. Licensing for herbal doctors and pharmacists was taken in order to control the quality of private practitioners.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2308">'''Hold come what may''' is a phrase popularized by logician [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]. [[Belief]]s that are "held come what may" are beliefs one is unwilling to give up, regardless of any evidence with which one might be presented.&lt;ref name="Ney"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alyssa Ney|title=Metaphysics: An Introduction|date=13 August 2014|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-67633-1|page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quine held (on a perhaps simplistic construal) that there are no beliefs that one ought to hold come what may—in other words, that all beliefs are [[rationality|rationally]] revisable ("no statement is immune to revision"), and compared this to the simplification of quantum mechanics.&lt;ref name="Ney"/&gt;

Many philosophers argue to the contrary, believing that, for example, the [[laws of thought]] cannot be revised and may be "held come what may". Quine believed that all beliefs are linked by a [[web of beliefs]], in which a belief is linked to another belief by supporting relations, but if one belief is found untrue, there is ground to find the linked beliefs also untrue.&lt;ref name="Ney"/&gt;

A closely related concept is '''hold more stubbornly at least''', also popularized by Quine. Some beliefs may be more useful than others, or may be implied by a large number of beliefs.  Examples might be laws of [[logic]], or the belief in an external world of physical objects.  Altering such central portions of the web of beliefs would have immense, ramifying consequences, and affect many other beliefs.  It is better to alter auxiliary beliefs around the edges of the web of beliefs (considered to be sense beliefs, rather than main beliefs) in the face of new evidence unfriendly to one's central principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Willard Van Orman |last=Quine |chapter=Two Dogmas of Empiricism |title=From a Logical Point of View |edition=2nd revised |location=Cambridge |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1980 |isbn=0674323513 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, while one might agree that there is no belief one can hold come what may, there are some for which there is ample practical ground to "hold more stubbornly at least".

'''''Hollow Earth Expedition''''' is a [[Pulp magazine|pulp fiction]] [[role-playing game]] set in the fictitious Hollow Earth (see [[Hollow Earth theory]]), published by [[Exile Game Studio]]. The game has been nominated for several [[Origins Award|Origins]] and [[ENnie]] awards since its release in 2006. The main rule book is ''Hollow Earth Expedition''.

==System==
''Hollow Earth Expedition'' uses the Ubiquity rules, which were also created by Exile Game Studio. The main feature of the system is its use of binary dice pool rolls to determine success. Under the default rules, each even number rolled counts as a success, while odd numbers count as nothing. Odd 'nothings' do not cancel out even 'successes', making dice rolling quick and simple. This binary system has also led to the development of special Ubiquity Dice, which are not detailed below.

==Game setting==

===The surface world===
Hollow Earth Expedition is set in the 1930s. On the surface, everything appears as it does in our real world history books, but if you dig a little deeper you encounter secret societies and villainous organizations, many of whom have a vested interest in the Hollow Earth.

Two organizations are detailed in the main rulebook: the Terra Arcana and the [[Thule Society]]. Further organizations are listed in the first expansion, '''Secrets of the Surface World'''.

The '''Terra Arcanum''' is an [[Western esotericism|esoteric]] society dedicated to keeping the Hollow Earth a secret. They have their foundations deep in the mists of time, and only a few of their current members realize their true origins.

The '''[[Thule Society]]''' are based on an actual organization associated with the [[Nazi Party]] during [[World War II]]. In HEX they have a deep interest in getting into the Hollow Earth and the powerful ancient weapons they believe are kept there.

===The Hollow Earth===
The Hollow Earth boasts a wide selection of beasts and humans. [[Dinosaur]]s and other extinct creatures still live and hunt and are hunted by the various human groups who have become stranded in the Hollow Earth over the centuries. Not a great deal of detail is provided about the Hollow Earth in the main book, allowing Game Masters to customize the terrain to suit their campaign.

'''Mysteries of the Hollow Earth''' expands a great deal on the denizens of Hollow Earth, including rules for beastmen of various sorts, and provides details such as a map and gazetteer for those GMs who want a more fleshed-out world, rather than the more nebulous "land of mysteries" from the core book.

===Mars===

'''Revelations of [[Mars]]''' expands the setting to include the dying and dangerous Red Planet.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Explore a desolate world filled with strange aliens, bizarre creatures, and ancient artifacts buried beneath its shifting sands. Discover xenophobic nomads roaming the wastelands, [[Air pirate|sky pirates]] prowling the air in their great flying vessels, and power-hungry warlords fighting over dwindling resources. Take shelter within one of the great walled city-states, and rub shoulders with haughty nobles, devout priests, and greedy merchants who plot and scheme therein.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Italic title|reason=[[:Category:Japanese words and phrases]]}}
'''''Iki''''' (いき, English: roughly "chic, stylish") is a concept in aesthetics, the basis of which is thought to have formed among urbane commoners ([[chōnin]]) in [[Edo]] in the [[Edo period|Tokugawa period]].&lt;ref name="nussbaum379"&gt;Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "''Iki''{{-"}} in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|''Japan Encyclopedia'', p. 379|page=379}}; n.b., Louis-Frédéric is pseudonym of Louis-Frédéric Nussbaum, ''see'' [http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=4.1/PPN?PPN=128842709 Deutsche Nationalbibliothek Authority File] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120524174828/http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=4.1/PPN?PPN=128842709 |date=2012-05-24 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Iki'' is sometimes misunderstood as simply "[[Cool Japan|anything Japanese]]" overseas, but it is actually a specific aesthetic ideal, distinct from more ethereal notions of transcendence or poverty. As such, [[samurai]], for example, would typically, as a class, be considered devoid of ''iki'' (see ''[[yabo]]''). At the same time, individual warriors are often depicted in contemporary popular imagination as embodying the ''iki'' ideals of a clear, stylish manner and blunt, unwavering directness. The term became widespread in modern intellectual circles through the book ''[[The Structure of Iki]]'' (1930) by [[Kuki Shūzō]].

==Interpretation==
''Iki'', having emerged from the worldly [[Japanese merchant class]], may appear in some ways a more contemporary expression of Japanese aesthetics than concepts such as ''[[wabi-sabi]]''. The term is commonly used in conversation and writing, but is not necessarily exclusive of other categories of beauty.

''Iki'' is an expression of simplicity, sophistication, spontaneity, and originality. It is ephemeral, romantic, straightforward, measured, audacious, smart, and lacking in detrimental self-consciousness.

''Iki'' is not overly refined, pretentious, complicated, showy, slick, coquettish, or, generally, [[Kawaii|cute]]. At the same time, ''iki'' may exhibit any of those traits in a smart, direct, and unabashed manner.

''Iki'' may signify a personal trait, or artificial phenomena exhibiting human will or consciousness. ''Iki'' is not used to describe natural phenomena, but may be expressed in human appreciation of natural beauty, or in the nature of human beings. [[Murakami Haruki]] (b. 1949), who writes in a clear, unflinching style—at turns sentimental, fantastic, and surreal—is described as embodying ''iki''. In contrast, [[Kawabata Yasunari]] (1899-1972) writes in a more poetic vein, with a closer focus on the interior "complex" of his characters, while situations and surroundings exhibit a kind of ''[[wabi-sabi]]''. That said, stylistic differences may tend to distract from a similar emotional subjectivity. Indeed, ''iki'' is strongly tied to stylistic tendencies.

==''Tsū''==
The indefinite ideal of '''tsū''' (通) can be said to reference a highly cultivated but not necessarily solemn sensibility. The ''iki''/''tsu'' sensibility resists being construed within the context of overly specific rules about what could be considered as vulgar or uncouth.&lt;ref&gt;Gallaher, John. ''Geisha: A Unique World of Tradition, Elegance, and Art.'' p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Iki'' and ''tsu'' are considered synonymous in some situations, but ''tsu'' exclusively refers to persons, while ''iki'' can also refer to situations/objects. In both ideals, the property of refinement is not academic in nature. ''Tsu'' sometimes involves excessive obsession and cultural (but not academic) pedantry, and in this case, it differs from ''iki'', which will not be obsessive. ''Tsu'' is used, for example, for knowing how to properly appreciate (eat) Japanese cuisines ([[sushi]], [[tempura]], [[soba]] etc.). ''Tsu'' (and some ''iki''-style) can be transferred from person to person in form of "tips." As ''tsu'' is more focused in knowledge, it may be considered superficial from ''iki'' point of view, since ''iki'' cannot be easily attained by learning.

==''Yabo''==
{{main|Yabo}}

''[[Yabo]]'' (野暮) is the antonym of ''iki''. ''Busui'' (無粋), literally "non-''iki''," is synonymous to ''yabo''.

==''Sui''==
In the [[Kamigata]] or [[Kansai]] area, the ideal of ''sui'' is prevalent. ''Sui'' is also represented by the [[kanji]] "粋". The sense of ''sui'' is similar to ''iki'' but not identical, reflecting various regional differences.&lt;ref name="nussbaum379"/&gt; The contexts of their usages are also different.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21557">'''Imagined interactions'''  (IIs) are a type of social [[cognition]] and [[mental imagery]] grounded in [[symbolic interactionism]] in which individuals imagine conversations with significant others for a variety of purposes (Honeycutt, 2003; 2015).   The research program was founded and created by [[James M. Honeycutt]] in 1987, who was designated an LSU Distinguished Professor in 2012.  He provided a keynote address at the American Association for the Study of Mental Imagery at Yale University in 1987 discussing the functions of imagined interactions and mental imagery.  In 2006, Honeycutt's book, "Imagined Interactions: Daydreaming about Communication" (2003), was awarded Distinguished Book of the Year by the National Communication Association for developing the original formulations and the II construct which has provided a beneficial mechanism for operationalizing the study of intrapersonal communication, social cognition, daydreaming, and mental imagery.  Furthermore, imagined interactions can be used in sports imagery as athletes "imagine" positive outcomes of their executions on specific plays or formations (Keaton, Gearhart, &amp; Honeycutt, 2014).

==Theoretical Foundation of Imagined Interactions==
In the early research, IIs were suggested as a means to operationalize the study of daydreaming as it works to shape communication interpersonally, emotions, and personality.  They have been examined cross-culturally (McCann, Honeycutt, &amp; Keaton, 2010).

Scripts are activated mindlessly and created through imagined interactions, as people envision contingency plans for actions. In contrast to mindless processing, engaging in imagined interaction requires conscious cognitive processing.  Imagined interactions are a type of daydreaming that have definitive attributes  and serve a number of functions including rehearsal, self-understanding, relational maintenance, managing conflict, catharsis, and compensation.  Retroactive imagined interactions often occur in television shows in terms of “flashbacks” as characters relive prior conversations in their mind.

Honeycutt et al. (1989) discuss how IIs have their theoretical foundation in the work of symbolic interactionists and phenemonologists, including Mead (1934), Dewey (1922) and Schutz (1962). As individuals engage in imagined interactions, cognitive scripts are activated as people imagine how they might react in an upcoming conversation. Imagined interactions help people prepare for encounters. They also help people to relive previous conversations and foster good or bad memories.

==Attributes of Imagined Interactions==

Within imagined interaction theory, Honeycutt (2003) defines eight attributes or characteristics of IIs that can be measured as personality traits or contextually in various situations or with specific individuals.  For example, while a person may have a lot of IIs in their daily life, they may have IIs while doing their job or a particular task.  Having IIs while playing tennis would interfere with serving and returning the ball.

Specifically, the eight attributes include the following:

1. Frequency—How often a person has IIs ranging from rarely to quite frequently.  For example, lonely people have fewer IIs because they have fewer interaction scenes to access compared to nonlonely people (Honeycutt, 2003).

2. Proactivity—Proactivity refers to those IIs which are engaged in prior to actual interaction, and research has shown that such IIs tend to occur prior to actual interactions.  For example, a worker may desire a raise, so she decides to approach her boss concerning the matter.  Using an II proactively, she may visualize herself going into her boss’s office and may even devise a plan for what she will say. This is an example of a proactive II.

3. Retroactivity— Retroactivity refers to reviewing an interaction after it has taken place. Proactive and retroactive IIs can simultaneously occur so that conversations are linked together and themes of interpersonal relationships emerge (Honeycutt, 2014).  For example, in order to characterize a relationship as competitive or hostile with another person, the person recalls more conversations in which disagreements were communicated as opposed to pleasant, cooperative transactions (Honeycutt, 2010).

4. Variety—Variety refers to the diversity of topics and partners within IIs.   IIs which involve various topics are related to the imaginer’s internal locus of control which lends credence to the idea that chronically lonely individuals lack variety in their IIs.  However, a person may have IIs with a variety of partners on few topics (e.g., Football plays and strategies are more likely to be the focus of discussion among a team's coaches while in practice in order not be distracted).

5. Discrepancy— Discrepancy refers to the incongruity between IIs and the actual interaction they address; in other words, how similar or different an II is from the relevant interaction.  Studies suggest that individuals who are chronically lonely have highly discrepant IIs due to their limited prior interactions upon which to base them.  Researchers suspect the high discrepancy of IIs that occurs  prior to a new interaction perpetuates and reinforces the state of loneliness (Honeycutt, 2003).  

6. Self-Dominance—This attribute addresses who is more prominent in the II: self, both, or other.   Research shows that self dominance is in part determined by the scenario of the II.  For instance, in IIs involving matters of conflict, the person engaging in the II tends to be more dominant than their II partner.  Self dominance is also influenced by culture and tends to characterize [[collectivistic]] cultures including Japan compared to [[individualistic]] cultures such as America.

7. Valence—Valence reflects how positive or negative [[emotions]] are experienced while imagining the conversation. High valence reflects positive emotional affect while low valence reflects negative emotional affect.  Honeycutt (2003) reviews research indicating that females report having more pleasant IIs.  Level of pleasantness and valence is inversely related to self dominance.

8. Specificity—The final attribute is specificity reflecting the degree of verbal and visual imagery used in the II.  This attribute reflects the level of detail and distinction of images contained within IIs.  Honeycutt (1998–99) found that those individuals reporting a secure attachment style experience high levels of detailed visual and verbal imagery, suggesting high levels of specificity.

==Functions of Imagined Interactions==

Imagined interactions function in the following ways: (1) they keep a relationship alive; (2) they can maintain or resolve conflict; (3) they are used to rehearse messages for future interaction; (4) they aid people in self-understanding through clarifying thoughts and feelings; (5) they provide emotional catharsis by relieving tension; and (6) they compensate for lack of real interaction (Honeycutt, 2003; 2008).

1. Relational Maintenance:  People often imagine talking with others that are important in their lives. Additionally, increased uses of proactive and retroactive IIs aided the ability of imagined interactions to predict relational quality.  Additionally, relational satisfaction was simultaneously predicted by extraversion and being a judger based on the Myers-Brigg personality inventory in which judging reflect placing a premium on organized environments, competence, performance and independence.

2. Conflict Linkage:  For some people, they are obsessed with grudges while others think about how to improve areas of disagreement.  Conflict linkage is also referred to as conflict management.  However, as noted in some of the theorems of imagined interaction conflict-linkage theory which are highlighted below (e.g., theorem four explains rage).  Honeycutt (2004; 2011) explains how conflict linkage is associated with rumination in which people dwell on conflicts and obsessively think about them which is related to depression.  
The second function of conflict linkage has received a great deal of research attention as it explains how individuals often remember arguments that are many years old and it is difficult for them to "let go." As a result, they harbor old grudges. A series of three axioms (e.g., "The communication is the relationship") and nine theorems are discussed explaining how daily conflict is managed or destructively dealt with (see Honeycutt, 2003-2004 for a review). The table below contains an outline of the axioms behind managing conflict in personal relationships and resulting theorems have been empirically tested in social scientific studies.

3. Rehearsal:  People plan their messages and what they are going to say as well as anticipating what others will say to them and how the self will respond.  Rehearsal often helps people in quickly developing contingencies when plans do not go as expected.

4. Self-Understanding: People have IIs in order to understand their beliefs about values, attitudes, or the opinions they have.  IIs allow people to clarify their own thoughts and promote understanding of their own views.

5. Catharsis:  People use IIs to relieve tension and anxiety which further reduces uncertainty.  IIs provide a mechanism to internally get “things off of one’s chest” and release emotions.

6. Compensation:  IIs are used to substitute for real conversations.  If you do not have access to another person, you compensate for the lack communication by imagining conversations with the persons.  The compensation function is rampant during electrical outages or when cell phone towers are blown down during tornadoes, hurricanes, or other environmental diasasters (Honeycutt and Mapp 2011).

==Association with [[Big Five Personality Traits]]==

Honeycutt, Pence, and Gearhart (2013) examined the associations between II attributes and the [[Big Five personality traits]].  In terms of personality, IIs have trait characteristics to the extent they are enduring and stable across similar conditions.  Conversely, they can also be measured in terms of state attributes in which their usage would be higher or lower depending on the particular context.  The Big Five Personality Traits include neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. Honeycutt and his associates found that the frequency and proactivity attributes of imagined interactions are  associated with lack of neuroticism and openness to new ideas.  Neuroticism increases egocentrism, depression, and anxiety (Hamilton, Buck, Chory, Beatty, &amp; Patrylak, 2009)).  Highly anxious people have fewer IIs available to them to “predict” their perceived (or believed) unstable environment.  They also found the occurrence of pleasant, non-discrepant IIs in which the self talks more to be moderately associated with the personality dimensions of extraversion and conscientiousness.  Extraverts interact with more individuals than do introverts, so extraverts would therefore imagine themselves having these interactions more often than those who are not extraverted.  Likewise, they discovered that extraverts have more pleasant IIs, which may be  explained through another relationship between extraversion and narcissism.  Extraverts think highly of themselves, and most likely portray themselves in a pleasant manner in their imagined interactions.

'''Correspondence between II Attributes and Functions'''

Although II theory has been a productive concept for research on communication and social cognition, there is an underlying and yet untested assumption within II theory that the eight attributes are related to all six functions and that II functions can be compared and contrasted in terms of II attributes.  Bodie, Honeycutt, and Vickery (2013) conducted two studies exploring the multidimensional nature of functions and attributes.  Their first study revealed both corroborative and contradictory evidence for II theory.  In line with the internal structure of II theory, it was found that conflict linkage and catharsis IIs are more negatively valenced than those used for compensation and relational maintenance.  Rehearsal IIs are more likely to be discrepant than all functions except relational maintenance and are the most proactive.  When compared to all other functions, compensatory IIs contain references to more people and were more frequent.  It also appears that compensatory and relational maintenance functions are similar insofar as each is equally directed toward others and highly specific, providing support for the role of each in close interpersonal relationships (Honeycutt 2003).  Relational maintenance and conflict IIs were used just as frequently as those for catharsis, and relational maintenance IIs were directed toward others in an equivalent manner as those used for conflict.

==Axioms and Theorems of II Conflict-Linkage Theory==

# Interpersonal relationships exist through intrapersonal communication as imagined interactions involving the relational partner outside of actual interaction.
# An interpersonal relationship is maintained and developed through thinking and dwelling on a relational partner.
# A major theme of interpersonal relationships is [[conflict management]] (e.g., cooperation-competition). Managing conflict begins at the intrapersonal level of communication in terms of IIs.

'''Theorems of Conflict'''
# Recurring conflict is maintained through retro- and proactive IIs.
# The current mood of individuals is associated with whether or not their IIs are positive or negative. The better a person's mood, the more positive their IIs will be as well as the inverse.
# When an individual attempts to purposely create positive IIs (e.g., as therapy for a poor marriage), negative intrusive IIs will frequently occur, in many cases with effects that undermine the therapy or positive intent.
# Suppressed rage is a result of the lack of opportunity or inability to articulate arguments with the target of conflict.
# Thinking about conflict may be prompted by exposure to contextual cues including music, substance abuse, and media (TV shows and movies).
# Recurring conflict is reflected in physiological arousal, including physical manifestations of anxiety, such as "fight or flight" response of the sympathetic nervous system.
# In order to enhance constructive conflict, individuals need to imagine positive interactions and outcomes.
# Conflict-linkage has the potential of distorting reality because conflict is kept alive in a person's mind and facilitates anticipating a conversation that most likely will be discrepant from reality since the actual interaction will not occur as planned.
# People use IIs as a mechanism for escape from societal norms. For example, a person may be expected to talk a certain way with their boss in real life, but in their IIs, the persons can be considerably more bold or liberated.

==Imagined Interactions and Political Partisanship==
Madison, Rold, and Honeycutt (2014) examined partisan voting in light of imagined interactions. The researchers asked how respondents  who claim to vote for candidates from certain political parties differ from those who do not in terms of the functions of their IIs. They collected data on voting intentions as well as the functions of the IIs of the survey respondents. Both Republicans and Democrats tend to have fewer self-understanding and rehearsal IIs than those who indicated preference for independent candidates, which suggests that voting along party lines may be a heuristic, or “mindless” behavior. This particular study provided the first pathway between IIs into political psychology.

'''Kenneth J. Gergen''' (born 1935) is an [[United States|American]] [[psychologist]] and [[emeritus]] [[professor]] at [[Swarthmore College]]. He obtained his [[Bachelor of Arts]] from [[Yale University]] (1957) and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] from [[Duke University]] (1962).

==Biography==

The son of [[John Jay Gergen]], the Chair of the Mathematics Department at [[Duke University]], and Aubigne Munger (née Lermond), Gergen grew up in Durham, North Carolina. He had three brothers, one of whom is [[David Gergen]], the prominent political analyst. After completing public schooling, he attended [[Yale University]]. Graduating in 1957, he subsequently became an officer in the U.S. Navy. He then returned to graduate school at Duke University, where he received his PhD in psychology in 1963. His dissertation advisor was [[Edward E. Jones]]. Gergen went on to become an Assistant Professor in the Department of Social Relations at [[Harvard University]], where he also became the Chairman of the Board of Tutors and Advisors for the department and representative to the university's Council on Educational Policy.

In 1967, Gergen took a position as Chair of the Department of Psychology at [[Swarthmore College]], a position he held for ten years. At various intervals, he served as visiting professor at the [[University of Heidelberg]], the [[University of Marburg]], the [[Sorbonne]], the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]], [[Kyoto University]], and [[Adolfo Ibanez University]]. At Swarthmore, he spearheaded the development of the academic concentration in interpretation theory. In an attempt to link his academic work to societal practices, he collaborated with colleagues to create the [[Taos Institute]] in 1996. He is currently Gil and Frank Mustin Professor Emeritus of Psychology and Senior Research Professor at Swarthmore, the Chairman of the Board of the Taos Institute, and an adjunct professor at [[Tilburg University]].

Gergen is married to Mary M. Gergen, Professor Emeritus at [[Penn State University]], and a major contributor to [[feminist psychology]] and performance inquiry. She is the author of over 50 articles and is the co-author (with Ken Gergen) of "Social Construction". They publish the Positive Aging Newsletter with a readership of around 20,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kenneth J. Gergen, Ph.D.|url=https://www.taosinstitute.net/kenneth-j-gergen|website=The Taos Institute|publisher=The Taos Institute|accessdate=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions==

Gergen's earliest studies challenged the presumption of a unified or coherent self.{{Clarify|reason=What studies, and in what way did they challenge this assumption?|date=June 2017}} He then raised questions about the value of [[altruism]], by exploring the ways in which helping others leads to the recipient's resentment and alienation. 

A major point in Gergen's career was his 1973 article "Social Psychology as History". In the article, he argues that the laws and principles of social interaction are variable over time, and that the scientific knowledge generated by [[Social psychology|social psychologists]] actually influences the phenomena it is meant to passively describe. For example, studying obedience to authority may reduce the likelihood of obedience. He argued therefore that social psychology was not fundamentally a cumulative science, but was effectively engaged in the recording and transformation of cultural life. The article proved contentious, receiving criticism, such as from [[Barry R. Schlenker]]. The developing dispute became known as the "Gergen-Schlenker debate" and touched topics around the metatheory of social psychology.&lt;ref name="Thorngate76"&gt;Warren Thorngate (1976) ''"In General" vs. "It depends": Some Comments of the Gergen-Schlenker Debate'';  Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin 2, S. 404-410.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl E. Weick]] later took Warren Thorngate's contribution to that dispute to formulate [[Thorngate's postulate of commensurate complexity]], a theorem revolving around research methodology in social sciences.

Also contributing to what was called "the crisis in social psychology"&lt;ref&gt;Kim, U. (1999), "After the 'Crisis' in Social Psychology: The Development of the Transactional Model of Science". ''[[Asian Journal of Social Psychology]]'', 2: 1–19. doi: 10.1111/1467-839X.00023&lt;/ref&gt; was Gergen's subsequent publication on generative theory. Here he proposed that, because theoretical suppositions were not so much recordings of social life as creators, theories should not be judged by their accuracy so much as their potential to open new spaces of action.

Combining these ideas with developments in literary and critical theory, along with the history of science, Gergen went on to develop a radical view of [[Social constructionism|socially constructed]] knowledge. This view was proposed as a successor project to what Gergen considered an inherently flawed [[Empiricism|empiricist]] conception of knowledge.  From Gergen's perspective, all human intelligibility (including claims to knowledge) is generated within relationships. It is from relationships that humans derive their conceptions of what is real, rational, and good. From this perspective, scientific theories, like all other reality posits, should not be assessed in terms of truth, but in terms of pragmatic outcomes. Such assessments are inevitably wedded to values, and thus all science is morally and politically weighted in implication. As he saw it, this same form of assessment also applies to social constructionist theory. The question is not its accuracy, but its potentials for humankind.

This latter conclusion informed most of Gergen's subsequent work, in areas including therapy and counseling, education, organizational change, technology, conflict reduction, civil society, and qualitative inquiry. In one form or another, this work is concerned with transforming social life. For the most part, his preferred direction of change is toward more collaborative and participatory relationships. Additionally, he has been concerned with fostering a "[[relational psychoanalysis|relational]]" view of the self, where the "traditional emphasis on the individual mind is replaced by a concern with the relational processes from which rationality and morality emerge."{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} He is also known for his comment "I am linked therefore I am" as an answer to [[René Descartes|Descartes]]' proposition "[[Cogito ergo sum|I think, therefore I am]]".&lt;ref&gt;Relational Being. New York: Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 400.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these developments are summarized in ''Relational Being, Beyond the Individual and Community,'' which attempts to demonstrate that what are considered mental processes are not so much "in the head" as in relationships. It also attempts to answer charges of [[moral relativism]] with a non-foundational morality of collaborative practice, and to outline a way to bring science together with concerns for the sacred.

Gergen's work is associated with [[social constructionism]]. Other major interests in his diverse works include analyzing the effects of technology on social life, examining connections between social construction and [[theology]], and promoting a more optimistic model of aging.

==Notable concepts==
Concepts that Gergen has written about include:
*''Enlightenment effects''. The moral and political effects on cultural behavior of disseminating scientific knowledge. ("Social psychology as history")
*''Generative theory'': Theory that unsettles common assumptions, and opens up possibilities or new forms of action. ("Toward generative theory")
*''Deficit discourse'': By constructing the world, and particularly individuals, in terms of problems, there is an objectification of deficit and a suppression of positive possibilities. (''Realities and Relationships'')
*''Cycle of progressive infirmity'': With the dissemination of information about [[Classification of mental disorders#Categorical schemes|categories of mental illness]], people come to see themselves in these terms. As a result, they seek help from the [[Mental health professional|mental health professions]], which are in turn, expanded in numbers. With the expansion of the mental health industry, new diagnostic categories are developed and disseminated. The society becomes progressively infirmed. (''Realities and Relationships'')
*''Multiphrenia'': The condition, largely attributed to technologies that increase social contact, of being simultaneously drawn in multiple and conflicting directions. (''The Saturated Self'')
*''Pregression''. To unsettle the modernist value placed on progress, the proposal that for every change that is effected in societal life, the repercussions will unsettle multiple conditions that people define as positive. (''The Saturated Self'')
*''Positive aging'': As an alternative to the pervasive view of aging as decline (deficit discourse), it is possible to discover and construct myriad ways of creating later life as a period of unparalleled growth and enrichment.
*''First and second order morality'': All collaborative relationships will be about some understanding of the good. With multiple groups proclaiming their own good, the stage is set for interminable conflict. Second order morality is achieved through practices that bring otherwise embattled groups into a condition of positive collaboration. (''Relational Being'')
*''Transformative dialogue'': Forms of dialogic practice that dissolve the barriers of meaning separating otherwise conflicted parties. (''Relational Being'')
*''Co-action''. One's actions have no meaning in themselves, but come into meaning through another's collaborative action. At the same time, another's potentially collaborative actions only become so as they are supplemented. All human intelligibility emerges not from individual actors but through co-action. (''Relational Being'')
*''Multi-being''. What is commonly viewed as the individual subject is the common intersection of multiple relationships. (''Relational Being'')

==Awards==
Gergen has received research grants from the [[National Science Foundation]], the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]], and the Barra Foundation. His work has merited awards from the [[American Psychological Association]], the [[National Communication Association]], the Constructivist Psychology Network, the [[University of Buenos Aires]], and [[Adolfo Ibanez University]] in Santiago. He has received fellowships from the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]], the [[Fulbright Foundation]], and the Alexander Humboldt foundation. He also holds honorary degrees from [[Tilburg University]],  [[Saybrook Graduate School]], and the [[University of Athens]].

'''Leibniz's gap''' is a [[philosophy of mind]] term that is used to refer to the problem that thoughts cannot be observed or perceived solely by examining [[brain]] properties, events, and processes. Here the word 'gap' is a [[metaphor]] of a subquestion regarding the [[mind–body problem]] that allegedly must be answered in order to reach more profound understanding of [[consciousness]] and [[emergence]]. A [[theory]] that could correlate brain phenomena with [[Psychology|psychological]] phenomena would "bridge the gap." The term is named after [[Gottfried Leibniz]] who first presented the problem in his work ''[[The Monadology]]'' in 1714. Leibniz's passage describing the gap goes as follows:

{{cquote|It must be confessed, moreover, that perception, and that which depends on it, are inexplicable by mechanical causes, that is, by figures and motions, And, supposing that there were a mechanism so constructed as to think, feel and have perception, we might enter it as into a mill. And this granted, we should only find on visiting it, pieces which push one against another, but never anything by which to explain a perception. This must be sought, therefore, in the simple substance, and not in the composite or in the machine.|author=Gottfried Leibniz|source=[http://people.uvawise.edu/philosophy/phil206/Leibniz.html ''Monadology'']}}

Leibniz himself sought to bridge the gap by introducing monads to explain the existence of immaterial, eternal souls. Leibniz's gap, however, applies to [[materialism]] and [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]] alike. This brought late 19th century scientists to conclude that psychology must build on [[introspection]]; thus [[introspectionism]] was born. [[Computationalism]] seeks to answer the problem proposed by Leibniz's gap through functional analysis of the brain and its processes. Today the term Leibniz's gap is still in wide use in scientific debate as the mind body problem remains unsolved.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17251">'''Mildred Grossman''' (1916-1988) was a New York City public school teacher, civil rights activist, unionist, and an award-winning photographer associated with the [[Photo League]]. She led 32 other teachers in a civil case against the New York City Public Schools and the state's McCarthy-era Feinberg ‘loyalty’ Law.

==Education and membership of the Teachers Union==
Mildred Grossman was born in [[Brooklyn]], NY, in 1916 eldest daughter of Lewis J. and Maybella Grossman, and sister of Mitchell, Henrietta and Leonard.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ancestry.com/1940-census/usa/New-York/Mildred-M-Grossman_9jwpv Mildred M Grossman in the 1940 Census]&lt;/ref&gt; She studied Business Administration and in 1937 earned a bachelor's degree with a Teaching Certificate from the College of Business and Accounting of the [[Baruch College|City College of New York]]. There, as President of the Girls Club in 1935, she was notable for her campaign to secure readmission of women banned from studying at the College,&lt;ref&gt;[https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1016&amp;context=bb_arch_ticker 'Girls' Re-entry Form Called for Thursday: Addresses by Prominent Figures to Feature 5S Rally.

''The Ticker'', School of Business and Civic Administration, College of the City of New York, Monday, November 4, 1935.]&lt;/ref&gt; the formation of a student union and defence of academic freedom,&lt;ref&gt;[https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1026&amp;context=bb_arch_ticker 'College Delegates Voice Their Sentiments on Forming of American Student Union', ''The Ticker'', School of Business and Civic Administration, College of the City of New York, Monday, January 6, 1936]&lt;/ref&gt; and a youth allowance for needy students.&lt;ref&gt;[https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1035&amp;context=bb_arch_ticker 'AYA Passage Urged by 450 Delegates at Senate Hearing'. ''The Ticker'', School of Business and Civic Administration, College of the City of New York, Monday March 23, 1936]&lt;/ref&gt;  While studying she worked at [[Coty, Inc.|Coty Cosmetics]] in [[Manhattan]]. In 1939 she attended NYS Communist Party summer school before beginning teaching in business accounting at [[Norman Thomas High School|Central Commercial High School]] in Manhattan. She became active in the Teachers Union of NY and a member of the [[American Labor Party]].

== Photographer ==
In the late 1940s she joined the Photo League of NY, taking classes in [[Documentary photography|documentary]] and [[street photography]], subsequently being given work as staff photographer for ''Teacher News'', the publication of the Teachers' Union. She photographed the annual Teachers Union Educational Conferences at the [[Waldorf Astoria New York|Waldorf-Astoria]] and the Academic Freedom rallies. Her subjects included speakers playwright [[Arthur Miller]] and [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisted]] screenwriter [[Dalton Trumbo]], and she recorded educator/activist, [[W. E. B. Du Bois|Dr. W.E.B. Du Bois]] and actor/activist [[Paul Robeson]] receiving the TU's Award for Distinguished Service in the Cause of Education for Peace and Freedom.

When teachers demonstrated in [[Albany, New York|Albany]] over poor salaries, Grossman was present, and she recorded rallies in Washington for allied unions, and protests in NYC against unfair labor practices that included the Timone Resolution, which threatened both the TU and individual teachers who expressed their personal political beliefs.

== Red Scare and activism ==
The union actions Grossman documented were a response to the 1940 'Little [[Red Scare]]', which saw twenty-one states impose ‘loyalty oaths’ on teachers before, by 1946, fifteen more states had joined them. The [[House Un-American Activities Committee]], supported at times by military authorities, inspected public school and college textbooks and curricula to ensure that the authors, even those long deceased, had 'disclaimed Communism'. New York's  State Senator [[Frederic René Coudert Jr.|Frederic Coudert]] in 1940 scoured schools for "subversives", leading to the dismissal of professors without regard for their value and record as teachers.

Post-war, the purge instituted in New York in the state's 1949 Feinberg Law (Named after its sponsor, state senator [[Benjamin F. Feinberg|Benjamin Feinberg]]) requiring school districts to report on the loyalty of every teacher, annually, targeted left-wing leaders of the city's Teachers Union.&lt;ref&gt;The Feinberg Law. (1949). The New Republic, 121(24), 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heins, Marjorie. “The Board of Education and the Feinberg Law.” Priests of Our Democracy: The Supreme Court, Academic Freedom, and the Anti-Communist Purge, NYU Press, 2013, pp. 69–86. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qfmg6.7.&lt;/ref&gt; A teacher's membership in ‘subversive’ organisations, including “writing of articles, the distribution of pamphlets, endorsement of speeches made or articles written or acts performed by others”, would be designated ‘disloyal’  by the state commissioner of education. By 1950, leaders of the New York City Teachers Union were being dismissed through these proceedings, provoking fear of ramping job losses that affected membership; Teachers Union numbers fell from 7,000 in 1946 to 2,000 by the end of the 1950 school year, enabling the New York City Board of Education to withdraw recognition.&lt;ref&gt;Schultz, Bud; Schultz, Ruth (2001), The price of dissent : testimonies to political repression in America, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0-520-22402-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mildred Grossman was subject to investigation and in 1953 was named as a former Communist at HUAC assistant corporation counsel Saul Moskoff's  interrogation conducted in an old warehouse without legal representation.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Mildred Grossman (2001)  Imposing Cold War Orthodoxy: A Teachers Union Under Attack. In {{Citation | author1=Schultz, Bud | author2=Schultz, Ruth | title=The price of dissent : testimonies to political repression in America | publication-date=2001 | publisher=University of California Press | isbn=978-0-520-22402-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Grossman fought back by directing the Talmudic admonitions of the ‘moser’ (informer) as ammunition against  Saul Moskoff,  a practicing Jew and  first vice president of Congregation Agudas Israel,  sending a letter to the members of his congregation citing a resolution against the "Informer Resolution" adopted by the New York Board of Rabbis.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Dr. Jansen from Saul Moskoff and Memorandum Re: New York  Board of Rabbis, 26 April 1955; and Letter from Leonard Boudin (Mildred  Grossman's attorney) to Saul Moskoff, 28 April 1955, cited in Back, A. (2001). Blacks, Jews and the Struggle to Integrate Brooklyn's Junior High School 258: A Cold War Story. Journal of American Ethnic History, 20(2), 38-69.&lt;/ref&gt; Moskoff, however, recruited his own rabbis to offer their interpretation, though Rabbi Sharfman warned Moskoff his opponents could most certainly produce Talmudic interpretation from another rabbi to the contrary. &lt;ref&gt;Letter from Rabbi Benajmin Sharfman to Saul Moskoff, 17 August 1953 and Letter from Saul Moskoff to Rabbi Theodore Adams, President, Rabbinical 
Council of America, 22 October 1953, cited in Back, A. (2001). Blacks, Jews and the Struggle to Integrate Brooklyn's Junior High School 258: A Cold War Story. Journal of American Ethnic History, 20(2), 38-69.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, when she refused to answer part of the Superintendent's question concerning past and present membership in the CP, she was first suspended from her teaching position, and after twelve years as a teacher, was dismissed, with 38 other NYC teachers, in April 1954 for “insubordination and conduct unbecoming” and the Board of Education's determination, in accordance with New York State's Feinberg Law, that she had not satisfactorily severed her ties to the Communist Party. 283 others resigned or retired to escape the ordeal, with one elementary teacher, recently bereaved of her husband, committing suicide.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Grossman's 1955 appeal against her dismissal was denied by the State Commissioner of Education.

==Recognition for photography==
In the same year, two of Grossman's photographs appeared in the world-touring [[Museum of Modern Art]] exhibition ''[[The Family of Man]]'' selected by Edward Steichen and seen by 9 million visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author1=Steichen, Edward | author2=Norman, Dorothy |editor=Mason, Jerry | others=Sandburg, Carl, (writer of foreword), Lionni, Leo, (book designer), Stoller, Ezra, (photographer) | location=New York, N.Y. | title=The family of man : the photographic exhibition | publication-date=1955 | publisher=Museum of Modern Art / Maco Magazine Corporation | url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/10809600 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One shows an elderly couple promenading on a city street, their identical poses representing habituation in a long-term marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Bernhardt, Debra E | author2=Bernstein, Rachel Amelia, 1953- | author3=Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives | title=Ordinary people, extraordinary lives : a pictorial history of working people in New York City | publication-date=2000 | publisher=New York University Press | isbn=978-0-8147-9866-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The subject of her other photograph, taken in Germany, is a grandmother's gleefully reciprocated pride in her grandchild. Steichen also included Grossman's works in the 1957 MoMA show ''Seventy photographers look at New York''.&lt;ref&gt;Museum of Modern Art (New York, N.Y.), &amp; Steichen, E. (1957). Seventy photographers look at New York. New York: Museum of Modern Art.&lt;/ref&gt;

Barred from teaching but buoyed by this recognition, Grossman switched careers to begin freelancing as a photographer, working for the New York Hotel Trades Council,  and for the Hotel Workers Local #5 in NYC,  photographing their members on the job, as they participated in union elections, on the strike line, and at the Union hall. Her now historic pictures appeared in Union publications and displayed in her art exhibit ''Portrait of a Union''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://hotelworkers.org/about/history/mildred-grossman    Mildred Grossman, NYC Teachers' Union Member, Photographer for the New York Hotel Trades Council: Online exhibition at The New York Hotel and Motel Trades Council, AFL-CIO, (Hotel Trades Council) site]&lt;/ref&gt;

She met [[Martin Luther King Jr.|Dr Martin Luther King]] in the union offices in 1957 and in support of [[Civil rights movement|civil rights]] she produced reportage on the [[Little Rock Nine]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; the first African-American students to attend an integrated school, [[Little Rock Central High School|Little Rock Central High]], in [[Arkansas]] in September, 1957, as part of the initiative to [[Desegregation|desegregate]] Southern schools. Subjected to discrimination, harassment, and violence by their white classmates, they became iconic of African-Americans’ struggle for equality. Grossman photographed them in the summer of 1958, when they met with union leaders, diplomats, and elected officials honouring their courage and achievements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://contentdm.ad.umbc.edu/cdm/landingpage/collection/p16629coll3 Mildred Grossman Collection online at the Albin O. Kuhn Library &amp; Gallery of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC)]&lt;/ref&gt; The New York Hotel Workers’ Union flew the Little Rock Nine students to New York and presented them with the Better Race Relations Award.

One member of the group, Carlotta Walls LaNier recalls in interview with Lisa Frazier Page in ''A mighty long way: my journey to justice at Little Rock Central High School,'' that;

{{quote| We were even accompanied by the union's photographer, Mildred Grossman, a tiny lady who didn't seem at all weighed down by the ton of photo equipment she lugged around. She seemed different from the other professional photographers we had encountered. She tried not to be intrusive, though she snapped photos at every turn. In later years, when l learned her history, I would understand why she seemed so empathetic toward us. She knew what it was like to be singled out unjustly.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=LaNier, Carlotta Walls | author2=Page, Lisa Frazier | title=A mighty long way : my journey to justice at Little Rock Central High School | publication-date=2009 | publisher=One World Ballantine Books | edition=1st | isbn=978-0-345-51100-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

==Later career==
Grossman continued her work as a union activist, photographer, and teacher until her death from cancer in 1988. In 1958 Grossman married Motel "Mark" Berkowitz, a [[Sh'erit ha-Pletah|Holocaust survivor]] with whom, in 1965, she traveled to [[Poland]], his homeland. The next year she won a Polish competition with her image ''Strike Rally''. She had previously, in 1960, won 'America's Many Faces', sponsored by the [[National Urban League]]. She photographed for the [[Poor People's Campaign]] in 1968 and contributed photos to ''The New Movement: Power for the Powerless''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Power for the Powerless, inc | author2=Kerpen, Karen, (ed.) | title=The new movement : power for the powerless | publication-date=1968 | publisher=New York | edition=[1st ed.] | url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/21070246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967 the Feinberg Law was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court and Grossman led a group of teachers to seek reinstatement, but it was not until 1972 that they successfully sued to regain their jobs. In the meantime, during 1971 Grossman worked between [[Freelancer|freelance]] photography, social work and teaching photography, before finally, at age 58, returning after 21 years to her secondary teaching post at [[Norman Thomas High School|Central Commercial High School]] in 1974-75, her hard-won campaign against laws obstructing academic freedom vindicated. Even in her sixties, she fought for others as head of the [[Tenants' Union|tenant union]] in her building.&lt;ref&gt;[https://library.umbc.edu/speccoll/findingaids/coll006 Mildred Grossman papers at the Albin O. Kuhn Library &amp; Gallery of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Grossman was represented in ''Fields of Vision: Women in Photography'' (1995)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Albin O. Kuhn Library &amp; Gallery.

{{Theosophy}}
'''Morya''' is one of the "[[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]]" within modern [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical]] beliefs.  He is one of the [[Mahatmas]] who inspired the founding of the [[Theosophical Society]] and was engaged in a correspondence with two English [[Theosophist]]s living in India, [[A. P. Sinnett]] and [[A. O. Hume]].  The correspondence was published in 1923 by A. Trevor Barker, in the book [[The Mahatma Letters to A. P. Sinnett]].

==History==
[[File:Moryaportrait.jpg|thumb|right|A portrait of Master Morya]]
[[H. P. Blavatsky]], originally described the existence of a spiritual master whom she considered her guru, and who went by, among other names, Morya.  Blavatsky said that Morya and another master, [[Koot Hoomi]], were her primary guides in establishing the [[Theosophical Society]].  Blavatsky also wrote that Masters Morya and Koot Hoomi belonged to a group of highly developed humans known to some as the [[Great White Brotherhood]] or the White Lodge (though this is not how they described themselves).  Master Morya's personality has been depicted in some detail by various theosophical authors. A man "living on the earth, but possessed of developed senses that laughed at time and space." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030272/1892-09-26/ed-1/seq-5/|title=The sun.

All was written straight out of hand. And yet it is full of references to books in the British Museum and other great libraries, and every reference is correct. Either, then, we have, as to that book [referring to Isis Unveiled], a woman who was capable of storing in her memory a mass of facts, dates, numbers, titles, and subjects such as no other human being ever was capable of, or her claim to help from unseen beings is just." 

After Blavatsky's death, theosophists and others continued claiming to have met Morya or to have received communications from him.  [[William Quan Judge]], the leader of the American Section of the Theosophical Society, stated privately that he had received letters from Morya and other Adepts.  [[Annie Besant]], head of the European Section and co-head of the Esoteric Section with Judge, made public statements supporting the genuineness of those letters; but she later accused Judge of falsifying them, asserting that her suspicions of him were confirmed by the visitation of a Mahatma, presumably Master Morya, to whom she was linked.&lt;ref&gt;Annie Besant, ''The Case Against W. Q. Judge'' (1895), p. 13.  About Besant’s closeness to Morya, in a letter of 27 March 1891 to Judge, Blavatsky writes: “She is not psychic nor spiritual in the least—all intellect—and yet she hears the Master's voice when alone, sees His Light, and recognises His Voice from that of D____.”&lt;/ref&gt;  The ensuing controversy led to the break-up of the Society in 1895, but leaders in the increasingly fragmented movement continued making claims about having received communications and visitations from the Masters connected with the cause.  Theosophical writings offered vivid descriptions of Morya, his role in the Brotherhood, and his past lives.&lt;ref&gt;''Letters of the Masters of the Wisdom: Second Series'' Nos. 69 and 70; ''First Series'' No. 19; Wachtmeister, op. cit., Chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incarnations==
Morya's earliest notable claimed incarnation is recorded by [[Annie Besant]] and [[C.W. Leadbeater]] (from, the source states, their research into the "[[akashic records]]" at the [[Theosophical Society Adyar|Theosophical Society headquarters]] in [[Adyar (Tamil Nadu)]], [[India]] conducted in the  summer of 1910) as having been the [[Emperor]] of [[Root race#The civilization of Atlantis|Atlantis]] in 220,000 BC, ruling from his palace in the capital city, the ''City of the Golden Gates''.&lt;ref&gt;Besant, Annie and Leadbeater, C.W. ''Man: How, Whence, and Whither?''  Adyar, India:1913 Theosophical Publishing House Page 122 Note: On page xii of the introduction it is explained that the name ''Mars'' is used to refer to the reincarnating [[soul]] entity now known to Theosophists as Morya in his various incarnations.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Ascended Masters teachings, some of the later incarnations that Morya is said to have had include:&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Mark L. and Elizabeth Clare  ''Lords of the Seven Rays'' Livingston, Montana, U.S.A.:1986 - Summit University Press - "Morya - Master of the First Ray" pages 21 - 78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Pages 87-92 El Morya&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ascension==
Students of [[Ascended Master Teachings|Ascended Master Activities]] believe that Morya ascended in 1898, becoming an [[Ascended master|Ascended Master]] and Chohan of the First Ray, and that his spiritual retreat is located at [[Darjeeling]], India.&lt;ref&gt;Luk, A.D.K..

Recent studies have shown that MAP present in [[milk]] can survive [[pasteurization]], which has raised human health concerns due to the widespread nature of MAP in modern dairy herds. MAP survival during [[pasteurization]] is dependent on the D&lt;sub&gt;72C&lt;/sub&gt;-value of the strains present and their concentration in milk.&lt;ref&gt;Mullan, W.M.A. (2015). HTST pasteurization. Is it time to raise statutory time / temperature conditions to destroy Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP)?. [On-line]. Available from: https://www.dairyscience.info/index.php/food-model/277-htst-pasteurization.html . Accessed: 30 July, 2018. Updated October, 2017; April 2018. [https://www.dairyscience.info/index.php/food-model/277-htst-pasteurization.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is heat resistant and is capable of sequestering itself inside white blood cells, which may contribute to its persistence in milk. It has also been reported to survive [[Water chlorination|chlorination]] in municipal water supplies.

MAP is a slow growing organism and is difficult to culture. Bacterial cultures were regarded as Gold standards for detection of MAP. Detection is very limited in fresh tissues, food, and water. Recently, John Aitken and Otakaro Pathways have discovered a method to culture MAP from human blood. Testing is ongoing. Professor John Hermon-Taylor of Kings College London is developing a new vector type anti MAP vaccine which he claims is both curative and preventative. Stage 1 human trials began in January 2017. He is also developing a companion MAP blood test.

It is not susceptible to antituberculosis drugs (which can generally kill ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]''). MAP is susceptible to [[antibiotics]] used to treat Mycobacterium avium disease, such as [[rifabutin]] and [[clarithromycin]], however the capacity of these antibiotics to eradicate MAP infection in vivo has not been established.

===Crohn's disease===
MAP is recognized as a multi-host mycobacterial pathogen with a proven specific ability to initiate and maintain systemic infection and chronic inflammation of the intestine of a range of histopathological types in many animal species, including primates.&lt;ref name="Johnes"&gt;{{cite web |title=Johne's Information Center |url=http://www.johnes.org/ |accessdate=2008-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wikiquote}}
'''Naivety''' (or '''naïvety''' or '''naïveté''') is the state of being naïve, that is to say, having or showing a lack of [[experience]], [[understanding]] or sophistication, often in a context where one neglects [[pragmatism]] in favor of [[Deontological Ethics|moral idealism]]. One who is "naïve" may be called a ''naïf''.

== Etymology ==
In early use, the word ''naive'' meant "natural or innocent", and did not connote ineptitude. As a French [[adjective]], it is spelled ''naïve'' or ''naïf''. French adjectives have [[grammatical gender]]; ''naïf'' is used with masculine nouns and ''naïve'' with feminine nouns. The French noun is ''naïveté''.

The dots above the ''i'' are a [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] (see also [[Ï]]). As an unitalicized English word, "naive" is now the more usual spelling,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', "naïve" and "naïf" and quotes.&lt;/ref&gt; although "naïve" is unidiomatic rather than incorrect; "naïf" often represents the French masculine, but has a secondary meaning as an artistic style. “Naive” is now normally pronounced as two syllables, with the stress on the second, in the French manner.

The noun form can be written as naivety, naïvety, naïveté, naïvete, or naiveté.

==Culture==
The naif appears as a cultural type in two main forms. On the one hand, there is 'the satirical naïf, such as [[Candide]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Perrino, ''The Poetics of Mockery'' (1995), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Northrop Frye]] suggested we might call it "the ''ingénu'' form, after [[Voltaire]]'s dialogue of that name. "Here an outsider... grants none of the premises which make the absurdities of society look logical to those accustomed to them",&lt;ref&gt;Northrop Frye, ''Anatomy of Criticism'' (Princeton 1973) p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; and serves essentially as a prism to carry the satirical message. [[Baudrillard]] indeed, drawing on his [[Situationist International|Situationist]] roots, sought to position himself as ingénu in everyday life: "I play the role of the Danube peasant: someone who knows nothing but suspects something is wrong... I like being in the position of the primitive... ''playing naïve''".&lt;ref&gt;Jean Baudrillard, ''The Conspiracy of Art'' (2005), p. 66-67.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, there is the artistic "naïf - all responsiveness and seeming availability".&lt;ref&gt;Martin Green, ''Children of the Sun'' (London 1977), p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; Here 'the naïf offers himself as being in process of formation, in search of values and models...always about to adopt some traditional "mature" temperament'&lt;ref&gt;Green, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; - in a perpetual adolescent [[James Marcia#Moratorium|moratorium]]. Such instances of "the naïf as a cultural image... offered themselves as essentially responsive to others and open to every invitation... established their identity in indeterminacy".&lt;ref&gt;Green, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s, "the naifs turned toward mysticism and Eastern religions",&lt;ref&gt;Leora Lev, ''Enter at Your Own Risk'' (2006), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; feeding into the [[hippie]] movement. "Hippie culture, bastard of the beat generation out of pop, was much like a folk culture - oral, naive, communal, its aphorisms ("Make love, not war", "turn on, tune in, drop out") intuited, not rationalized".&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Willis, "Dylan" in Craig McGregor ed., ''Bob Dylan: A Retrospective'' (1975), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[physics]], the '''Navier–Stokes equations''' ({{IPAc-en|n|æ|v|ˈ|j|eː|_|s|t|əʊ|k|s}}), named after [[Claude-Louis Navier]] and [[Sir George Stokes, 1st Baronet|George Gabriel Stokes]], describe the motion of [[viscous fluid]] substances.

These balance equations arise from applying [[Newton's second law|Isaac Newton's second law]] to [[Fluid dynamics|fluid motion]], together with the assumption that the [[stress (mechanics)|stress]] in the fluid is the sum of a [[diffusion|diffusing]] [[viscosity|viscous]] term (proportional to the [[gradient]] of velocity) and a [[pressure]] term—hence describing ''viscous flow''. The main difference between them and the simpler [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]] for [[inviscid flow]] is that Navier–Stokes equations also factor in the [[Froude number|Froude limit]] (no external field) and are not [[conservation law|conservation equations]], but rather a [[dissipative system]], in the sense that they cannot be put into the quasilinear [[Homogeneous polynomial|homogeneous]] form:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf y_t + \mathbf A(\mathbf y) \mathbf y_x = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Navier–Stokes equations are useful because they describe the physics of many phenomena of [[scientific]] and [[engineering]] interest. They may be used to [[model (abstract)|model]] the weather, [[ocean current]]s, water [[flow conditioning|flow in a pipe]] and air flow around a [[airfoil|wing]]. The Navier–Stokes equations, in their full and simplified forms, help with the design of aircraft and cars, the study of blood flow, the design of power stations, the analysis of pollution, and many other things. Coupled with [[Maxwell's equations]], they can be used to model and study [[magnetohydrodynamics]].

The Navier–Stokes equations are also of great interest in a purely mathematical sense. Despite their wide range of practical uses, it has not yet been proven whether solutions always [[Existence theorem|exist]] in three dimensions and, if they do exist, whether they are [[Smoothness|smooth]] – i.e. they are infinitely differentiable at all points in the [[Domain (mathematical analysis)|domain]]. These are called the [[Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness]] problems. The [[Clay Mathematics Institute]] has called this one of the [[Millennium Prize Problems|seven most important open problems in mathematics]] and has offered a [[US$]]1&amp;nbsp;million prize for a solution or a counterexample.&lt;ref&gt;

==Flow velocity==
The solution of the Navier–Stokes equations is a [[flow velocity]]. It is a field, since it is defined at every point in a region of space and an interval of time. Once the velocity field is calculated other quantities of interest, such as [[pressure]] or [[temperature]], may be found using additional equations and relations. This is different from what one normally sees in [[classical mechanics]], where solutions are typically trajectories of position of a [[particle]] or deflection of a [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]]. Studying velocity instead of position makes more sense for a fluid; however for visualization purposes one can compute various [[Streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines|trajectories]].

==General continuum equations==
{{Main|Derivation of the Navier–Stokes equations}}
{{see also|Cauchy momentum equation#Conservation form}}

The Navier–Stokes momentum equation can be derived as a particular form of the [[Cauchy momentum equation]], whose general convective form is
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{D \mathbf{u}}{D t} = \frac 1 \rho \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} + \mathbf{g}&lt;/math&gt;
By setting the [[Cauchy stress tensor]] &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\sigma&lt;/math&gt; to be the sum of a viscosity term &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\tau&lt;/math&gt; (the [[Cauchy stress tensor#Stress deviator tensor|deviatoric stress]]) and a pressure term &lt;math&gt;-p\mathbf{I}&lt;/math&gt; (volumetric stress) we arrive at

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title='''Cauchy momentum equation''' ''(convective form)''
|equation=&lt;math&gt;
\rho\frac{D\mathbf{u}}{Dt} = - \nabla p + \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol \tau + \rho\,\mathbf{g}
&lt;/math&gt;

}}

where
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{D}{Dt}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[convective derivative]],
* &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the density,
* {{math|'''u'''}} is the flow velocity,
* &lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot&lt;/math&gt; is the [[divergence]],
* {{math|''p''}} is the [[pressure]],
* {{math|''t''}} is [[time]],
* &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\tau&lt;/math&gt; is the deviatoric stress tensor, which has order two,
* {{math|'''g'''}} represents [[body force|body acceleration]]s acting on the continuum, for example [[gravity]], [[Fictitious force|inertial accelerations]], [[Coulomb's law|electrostatic accelerations]], and so on,

In this form, it is apparent that in the assumption of an inviscid fluid -no deviatoric stress- Cauchy equations reduce to the [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]].

Assuming [[conservation of mass]] we can use the [[Continuity equation#Differential form|continuity equation]], &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho\,\mathbf{u}) = 0&lt;/math&gt; to arrive to the conservation form of the equations of motion. This is often written:&lt;ref&gt;Batchelor (1967) pp. 137 &amp; 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title='''Cauchy momentum equation''' ''(conservation form)''
|equation=&lt;math&gt;
\frac {\partial}{\partial t} (\rho\,\mathbf{u})
   + \nabla \cdot (\rho\,\mathbf{u} \otimes \mathbf{u})
 = - \nabla p + \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol \tau + \rho\,\mathbf{g}
&lt;/math&gt;

}}

where {{math|⊗}} is the [[outer product]]:
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u \otimes \mathbf v = \mathbf u \mathbf v^{\mathrm T}.&lt;/math&gt;

The left side of the equation describes acceleration, and may be composed of time-dependent and convective components (also the effects of non-inertial coordinates if present). The right side of the equation is in effect a summation of hydrostatic effects, the divergence of deviatoric stress and body forces (such as gravity).

All non-relativistic balance equations, such as the Navier–Stokes equations, can be derived by beginning with the Cauchy equations and specifying the stress tensor through a [[constitutive relation]]. By expressing the deviatoric (shear) stress tensor in terms of [[viscosity]] and the fluid [[Shear velocity|velocity]] gradient, and assuming constant viscosity, the above Cauchy equations will lead to the Navier–Stokes equations below.

===Convective acceleration===
{{see also|Cauchy momentum equation#Convective acceleration}}
[[Image:ConvectiveAcceleration vectorized.svg|thumb|An example of convection. Though the flow may be steady (time-independent), the fluid decelerates as it moves down the diverging duct (assuming incompressible or subsonic compressible flow), hence there is an acceleration happening over position.]]

A significant feature of the Cauchy equation and consequently all other continuum equations (including Euler and Navier–Stokes) is the presence of convective acceleration: the effect of acceleration of a flow with respect to space. While individual fluid particles indeed experience time-dependent acceleration, the convective acceleration of the flow field is a spatial effect, one example being fluid speeding up in a nozzle.

==Compressible flow==
Remark: here, the Cauchy stress tensor is denoted &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\sigma&lt;/math&gt; (instead of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\tau&lt;/math&gt; as it was in the [[#General_continuum_equations|general continuum equations]] and in the [[#Incompressible_flow|incompressible flow section]]).

The compressible momentum Navier–Stokes equation results from the following assumptions on the Cauchy stress tensor:&lt;ref name="Batchelor_142_148"/&gt;

*the stress is '''[[Galilean invariance|Galileian invariant]]''': it does not depend directly on the flow velocity, but only on spatial derivatives of the flow velocity. So the stress variable is the tensor gradient {{math|∇'''u'''.}}
*the stress is '''linear''' in this variable: {{math|'''σ'''(∇'''u''') {{=}} '''C''' : (∇'''u'''),}} where {{math|'''C'''}} is the fourth-order tensor representing the constant of proportionality, called the viscosity or [[elasticity tensor]], and : is the [[Dyadics#Double-dot product|double-dot product]].
*the fluid is assumed to be [[isotropic]], as with gases and simple liquids, and consequently {{math|'''V'''}} is an isotropic tensor; furthermore, since the stress tensor is symmetric, by [[Helmholtz decomposition]] it can be expressed in terms of two scalar [[Lamé parameters]], the [[bulk viscosity]] {{mvar|λ}} and the [[dynamic viscosity]] {{mvar|μ}}, as it is usual in [[linear elasticity]]:

{{Equation box 1
|indent=::
|title='''Linear stress [[constitutive equation]]''' ''(expression used for elastic solid)''
|equation=:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol \sigma = \lambda (\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}) \mathbf I + 2 \mu \boldsymbol \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;

}}

: where {{math|'''I'''}} is the identity tensor, {{math|'''ε'''(∇'''u''') ≡ {{sfrac|2}}∇'''u''' + {{sfrac|2}}(∇'''u''')&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the rate-of-[[strain tensor]] and {{math|∇ · '''u'''}} is the rate of expansion of the flow. So this decomposition can be explicited as:

:: &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol \sigma = \lambda (\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}) \mathbf I + \mu \left(\nabla\mathbf{u} + ( \nabla\mathbf{u} )^\mathrm{T}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Since the [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]] of the rate-of-strain tensor in three dimensions is:

: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{tr} (\boldsymbol \varepsilon) = \nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}.&lt;/math&gt;

The trace of the stress tensor in three dimensions becomes:

: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{tr} (\boldsymbol \sigma) = (3 \lambda + 2 \mu )\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}.&lt;/math&gt;

So by alternatively decomposing the stress tensor into '''isotropic''' and '''deviatoric''' parts, as usual in fluid dynamics:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chorin |first1=Alexandre E. |last2=Marsden |first2=Jerrold E. |date=1993 |title=A Mathematical Introduction to Fluid Mechanics |page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol \sigma = \left(\lambda + \tfrac23 \mu\right) \left(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}\right)\mathbf I + \mu \left(\nabla\mathbf{u} + \left( \nabla\mathbf{u} \right)^\mathrm{T} - \tfrac23 \left(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}\right)\mathbf I\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Introducing the [[volume viscosity|second viscosity]] {{mvar|ζ}},

: &lt;math&gt; \zeta \equiv \lambda + \tfrac23 \mu ,&lt;/math&gt;

we arrive to the linear [[constitutive equation]] in the form usually employed in [[thermal hydraulics]]:&lt;ref name=Batchelor_142_148/&gt;

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title='''Linear stress constitutive equation''' ''(expression used for fluids)''
|equation=:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol \sigma = \zeta (\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}) \mathbf I + \mu \left(\nabla\mathbf{u} + ( \nabla\mathbf{u} )^\mathrm{T} - \tfrac23 (\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u})\mathbf I\right)&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding

Both second viscosity {{mvar|ζ}} and dynamic viscosity {{mvar|μ}} need not be constant – in general, they depend on density, on each other (the viscosity is expressed in pressure), and in compressible flows also on temperature. Any equation expliciting one of these [[transport coefficient]] in the [[conservation variable]]s is called an [[equation of state]].&lt;ref name="Batchelor 1967 p. 165"/&gt;

By computing the divergence of the stress tensor, since the divergence of tensor {{math|∇'''u''' }} is {{math|∇&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'''u''' }} and the divergence of tensor {{math|(∇'''u''')&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;}} is {{math| ∇(∇ · '''u''')}}, one finally arrives to the compressible (most general) Navier–Stokes momentum equation:&lt;ref&gt;Batchelor (1967) pp. 147 &amp; 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;D/Dt&lt;/math&gt; is the [[material derivative]].
Bulk viscosity is assumed to be constant, otherwise it should not be taken out of the last derivative. The effect of the volume viscosity {{mvar|ζ}} is that the mechanical pressure is not equivalent to the thermodynamic [[pressure]]:&lt;ref&gt;Landau &amp; Lifshitz (1987) pp. 44–45, 196&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \bar{p} \equiv p - \zeta \, \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} ,&lt;/math&gt;

This difference is usually neglected, sometimes by explicitly assuming {{math|''ζ'' {{=}} 0}}, but it could have an impact in sound absorption and attenuation and shock waves.&lt;ref&gt;White (2006) p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; The convective acceleration term can also be written as

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf u\cdot\nabla\mathbf u = (\nabla\times\mathbf u)\times\mathbf u + \frac{1}{2}\nabla\mathbf u^2&lt;/math&gt;,

where the vector &lt;math&gt;(\nabla\times\mathbf u)\times\mathbf u&lt;/math&gt; is known as the [[Lamb vector]].

For the special case of an [[incompressible flow]], the pressure constrains the flow so that the volume of [[fluid element]]s is constant: [[isochoric process|isochoric flow]] resulting in a [[Solenoidal vector field|solenoidal]] velocity field with {{math|∇ · '''u''' {{=}} 0.}}&lt;ref&gt;Batchelor (1967) p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incompressible flow==
The incompressible momentum Navier–Stokes equation results from the following assumptions on the Cauchy stress tensor:&lt;ref name=Batchelor_142_148&gt;Batchelor (1967) pp. 142–148.&lt;/ref&gt;

*the stress is '''[[Galilean invariance|Galilean invariant]]''': it does not depend directly on the flow velocity, but only on spatial derivatives of the flow velocity. So the stress variable is the tensor gradient {{math|∇'''u'''}}.
*the fluid is assumed to be [[isotropic]], as with gases and simple liquids, and consequently {{math|'''τ'''}} is an isotropic tensor; furthermore, since the deviatoric stress tensor can be expressed in terms of the [[dynamic viscosity]] {{mvar|μ}}:

{{Equation box 1

:where

::&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \mathbf{\nabla u} + \mathbf{\nabla u}^\mathrm{T} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:is the rate-of-[[strain tensor]]. So this decomposition can be explicited as:&lt;ref name=Batchelor_142_148/&gt;

{{Equation box 1

Dynamic viscosity {{mvar|μ}} need not be constant – in incompressible flows it can depend on density and on pressure. Any equation expliciting one of these [[transport coefficient]] in the [[conservative variable]]s is called an [[equation of state]].&lt;ref name="Batchelor 1967 p. 165"&gt;Batchelor (1967) p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

The divergence of the deviatoric stress is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol \tau = 2 \mu \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol \varepsilon = \mu \nabla \cdot \left( \nabla\mathbf{u} + \nabla\mathbf{u} ^\mathrm{T} \right) = \mu \, \nabla^2 \mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt;

because &lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot \mathbf{u}=0&lt;/math&gt; for an incompressible fluid.
Incompressibility rules out density and pressure waves like sound or [[shock wave]]s, so this simplification is not useful if these phenomena are of interest. The incompressible flow assumption typically holds well with all fluids at low [[Mach number]]s (say up to about Mach 0.3), such as for modelling air winds at normal temperatures.&lt;ref name="Ach"&gt;See Acheson (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; For incompressible (uniform density ρ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) flows the following identity holds:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac 1 {\rho_0} \nabla p = \nabla \left(\frac p {\rho_0} \right) \equiv \nabla w&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|w}} is the specific (with the sense of ''per unit mass'') [[thermodynamic work]], the internal source term. Then the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations are best visualised by dividing for the density:

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title='''[[Incompressible flow|Incompressible]] Navier–Stokes equations''' (''convective form'')
|equation=&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{u} - \nu \,\nabla^2 \mathbf{u} = - \nabla w + \mathbf{g}.&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''ν'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''μ''|''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}}} is called the [[kinematic viscosity]].
{{hidden
| A laminar flow example |
Velocity profile (laminar flow):

:&lt;math&gt;u(x) = 0, \quad u(y) = u, \quad u(z) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

for the {{mvar|y}}-direction, simplify the Navier–Stokes equation:

:&lt;math&gt;0 = -\frac{dP}{dx} + \mu\left(\frac{d^2u}{dy^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Integrate twice to find the velocity profile with boundary conditions {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''h''}}, {{math|''u'' {{=}} 0}}, {{math|''y'' {{=}} −''h''}}, {{math|''u'' {{=}} 0}}:

:&lt;math&gt;u = \frac{1}{2\mu}\frac{dP}{dx} y^2 + Ay + B&lt;/math&gt;

From this equation, substitute in the two boundary conditions to get two equations:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} 0 &amp;= \frac{1}{2 \mu}\frac{dP}{dx} h^2 + Ah + B \\ 0 &amp;= \frac{1}{2 \mu}\frac{dP}{dx} h^2 - Ah + B \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Add and solve for {{mvar|B}}:

:&lt;math&gt;B = -\frac{1}{2 \mu}\frac{dP}{dx} h^2&lt;/math&gt;

Substitute and solve for {{mvar|A}}:

:&lt;math&gt;A = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Finally this gives the velocity profile:

:&lt;math&gt;u = \frac{1}{2 \mu}\frac{dP}{dx} (y^2 - h^2)&lt;/math&gt;
}}

It is well worth observing the meaning of each term (compare to the [[Cauchy momentum equation]]):

:&lt;math&gt;
 \overbrace{
 \underbrace{\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t}}_{
 \begin{smallmatrix}
 \text{Variation}
 \end{smallmatrix}} +
 \underbrace{(\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{u}}_{
 \begin{smallmatrix}
 \text{Convection}
 \end{smallmatrix}}}^{\text{Inertia (per volume)}}
 \overbrace{-\underbrace{\nu \, \nabla^2 \mathbf{u}}_{\text{Diffusion}}=
 \underbrace{-\nabla w}_{
 \begin{smallmatrix}
 \text{Internal} \\
 \text{source}
 \end{smallmatrix}}}^{\text{Divergence of stress}} +
 \underbrace{\mathbf{g}}_{
 \begin{smallmatrix}
 \text{External} \\
 \text{source}
 \end{smallmatrix}}
 .
&lt;/math&gt;

The higher-order term, namely the [[shear stress]] divergence {{math|∇ · ''τ''}}, has simply reduced to the [[vector laplacian]] term {{math|''μ''∇&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'''u'''}}.&lt;ref&gt;Batchelor (1967) pp. 21 &amp; 147.&lt;/ref&gt; This laplacian term can be interpreted as the difference between the velocity at a point and the mean velocity in a small surrounding volume. This implies that – for a Newtonian fluid – viscosity operates as a ''diffusion of momentum'', in much the same way as the [[heat conduction]]. In fact neglecting the convection term, incompressible Navier–Stokes equations lead to a vector [[diffusion equation]] (namely [[Stokes flow|Stokes equations]]), but in general the convection term is present, so incompressible Navier–Stokes equations belong to the class of [[convection-diffusion equation]]s.

In the usual case of an external field being a [[conservative field]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf g = - \nabla \phi &lt;/math&gt;

by defining the [[hydraulic head]]:

:&lt;math&gt;h \equiv w + \phi &lt;/math&gt;

one can finally condense the whole source in one term, arriving to the incompressible Navier–Stokes equation with conservative external field:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{u} - \nu \, \nabla^2 \mathbf{u} = - \nabla h.&lt;/math&gt;

The incompressible Navier–Stokes equations with conservative external field is the '''fundamental equation of [[hydraulics]]'''. The domain for these equations is commonly a 3 or less [[Euclidean space]], for which an [[orthogonal coordinate]] reference frame is usually set to explicit the system of scalar partial differential equations to be solved. In 3D orthogonal coordinate systems are 3: [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]], [[Cylindrical coordinate system|cylindrical]], and [[Spherical coordinate system|spherical]]. Expressing the Navier–Stokes vector equation in Cartesian coordinates is quite straightforward and not much influenced by the number of dimensions of the euclidean space employed, and this is the case also for the first-order terms (like the variation and convection ones) also in non-cartesian orthogonal coordinate systems. But for the higher order terms (the two coming from the divergence of the deviatoric stress that distinguish Navier–Stokes equations from Euler equations) some [[tensor calculus]] is required for deducing an expression in non-cartesian orthogonal coordinate systems.

The incompressible Navier–Stokes equation is composite, the sum of two orthogonal equations,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{\partial\mathbf{u}}{\partial t} &amp;= \Pi^S\left(-(\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{u} + \nu\,\nabla^2\mathbf{u}\right) + \mathbf{f}^S \\
\rho^{-1}\,\nabla p &amp;= \Pi^I\left(-(\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{u} + \nu\,\nabla^2\mathbf{u}\right) + \mathbf{f}^I
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|Π&lt;sup&gt;''S''&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|Π&lt;sup&gt;''I''&lt;/sup&gt;}} are solenoidal and irrotational projection operators satisfying {{math|Π&lt;sup&gt;''S''&lt;/sup&gt; + Π&lt;sup&gt;''I''&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 1}} and {{math|'''f'''&lt;sup&gt;''S''&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|'''f'''&lt;sup&gt;''I''&lt;/sup&gt;}} are the non-conservative and conservative parts of the body force. This result follows from the [[Helmholtz decomposition|Helmholtz Theorem]] (also known as the fundamental theorem of vector calculus). The first equation is a pressureless governing equation for the velocity, while the second equation for the pressure is a functional of the velocity and is related to the pressure Poisson equation.

The explicit functional form of the projection operator in 3D is found from the Helmholtz Theorem:

:&lt;math&gt;\Pi^S\,\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{1}{4\pi}\nabla\times\int \frac{\nabla^\prime\times\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}')}{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|} d V', \quad \Pi^I = 1-\Pi^S&lt;/math&gt;

with a similar structure in 2D. Thus the governing equation is an [[integro-differential equation]] similar to [[Coulomb law|Coulomb]] and [[Biot-Savart law]], not convenient for numerical computation.

for divergence-free test functions {{math|'''w'''}} satisfying appropriate boundary conditions. Here, the projections are accomplished by the orthogonality of the solenoidal and irrotational function spaces. The discrete form of this is eminently suited to finite element computation of divergence-free flow, as we shall see in the next section. There one will be able to address the question "How does one specify pressure-driven (Poiseuille) problems with a pressureless governing equation?".

The absence of pressure forces from the governing velocity equation demonstrates that the equation is not a dynamic one, but rather a kinematic equation where the divergence-free condition serves the role of a conservation equation. This all would seem to refute the frequent statements that the incompressible pressure enforces the divergence-free condition.

===Discrete velocity===
With partitioning of the problem domain and defining [[basis function]]s on the partitioned domain, the discrete form of the governing equation is,
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\mathbf{w}_i, \frac{\partial\mathbf{u}_j}{\partial t}\right) = -\left(\mathbf{w}_i, (\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{u}_j\right) - \nu(\nabla\mathbf{w}_i: \nabla\mathbf{u}_j) + \left(\mathbf{w}_i, \mathbf{f}^S\right).&lt;/math&gt;

It is desirable to choose basis functions which reflect the essential feature of incompressible flow – the elements must be divergence-free. While the velocity is the variable of interest, the existence of the stream function or vector potential is necessary by the Helmholtz Theorem. Further, to determine fluid flow in the absence of a pressure gradient, one can specify the difference of stream function values across a 2D channel, or the line integral of the tangential component of the vector potential around the channel in 3D, the flow being given by [[Stokes' Theorem]]. Discussion will be restricted to 2D in the following.

We further restrict discussion to continuous Hermite finite elements which have at least first-derivative degrees-of-freedom. With this, one can draw a large number of candidate triangular and rectangular elements from the [[Bending of plates|plate-bending]] literature. These elements have derivatives as components of the gradient. In 2D, the gradient and curl of a scalar are clearly orthogonal, given by the expressions,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\nabla\phi &amp;= \left(\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x},\,\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial y}\right)^\mathrm{T}, \\
\nabla\times\phi &amp;= \left(\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial y},\,-\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}\right)^\mathrm{T}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Adopting continuous plate-bending elements, interchanging the derivative degrees-of-freedom and changing the sign of the appropriate one gives many families of stream function elements.

Taking the curl of the scalar stream function elements gives divergence-free velocity elements.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The requirement that the stream function elements be continuous assures that the normal component of the velocity is continuous across element interfaces, all that is necessary for vanishing divergence on these interfaces.

Boundary conditions are simple to apply. The stream function is constant on no-flow surfaces, with no-slip velocity conditions on surfaces.
Stream function differences across open channels determine the flow. No boundary conditions are necessary on open boundaries, though consistent values may be used with some problems. These are all Dirichlet conditions.

The algebraic equations to be solved are simple to set up, but of course are [[#Nonlinearity|non-linear]], requiring iteration of the linearized equations.

Similar considerations apply to three-dimensions, but extension from 2D is not immediate because of the vector nature of the potential, and there exists no simple relation between the gradient and the curl as was the case in 2D.

===Pressure recovery===
Recovering pressure from the velocity field is easy. The discrete weak equation for the pressure gradient is,
:&lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{g}_i, \nabla p) = -\left(\mathbf{g}_i, \left(\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla\right)\mathbf{u}_j\right) - \nu\left(\nabla\mathbf{g}_i: \nabla\mathbf{u}_j\right) + \left(\mathbf{g}_i, \mathbf{f}^I\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where the test/weight functions are irrotational. Any conforming scalar finite element may be used. However, the pressure gradient field may also be of interest. In this case one can use scalar Hermite elements for the pressure. For the test/weight functions {{math|'''g'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} one would choose the irrotational vector elements obtained from the gradient of the pressure element.

==Non-inertial frame of reference==

The rotating frame of reference introduces some interesting pseudo-forces into the equations through the [[material derivative]] term. Consider a stationary inertial frame of reference K, and a non-inertial frame of reference K', which is translating with velocity &lt;math&gt;\mathbf U(t)&lt;/math&gt; and rotating with angular velocity &lt;math&gt;\mathbf\Omega(t)&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the stationary frame. The Navier–Stokes equation observed from the non-inertial frame then becomes

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title='''Navier–Stokes momentum equation in non-inertial frame''' 
|equation=&lt;math&gt; \rho \frac{D \mathbf{u}}{D t}  = - \nabla \bar{p} + \mu \, \nabla^2 \mathbf u + \tfrac13 \mu \, \nabla (\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}) + \rho\mathbf{g}  - \rho \left(2\mathbf\Omega\times\mathbf u + \mathbf\Omega\times\mathbf\Omega\times\mathbf x+ \frac{d\mathbf U}{dt} + \frac{d\mathbf \Omega}{dt}\times\mathbf x\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;\mathbf x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf u&lt;/math&gt; are measured in the non-inertial frame. The first term in the parenthesis represents [[Coriolis acceleration]], the second term is due to [[centripetal force|centripetal acceleration]], the third is due to the linear acceleration of K' with respect to K and the fourth term is due to the angular acceleration of K' with respect to K.

==Other equations==
The Navier–Stokes equations are strictly a statement of the balance of momentum. To fully describe fluid flow, more information is needed, how much depending on the assumptions made. This additional information may include boundary data ([[no-slip condition|no-slip]], [[capillary surface]], etc.), conservation of mass, balance of energy, and/or an [[equation of state]].

===Continuity equation for incompressible fluid===
{{main|Continuity equation}}

Regardless of the flow assumptions, a statement of the [[conservation of mass]] is generally necessary. This is achieved through the mass [[continuity equation]], given in its most general form as:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{u}) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

or, using the [[substantive derivative]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{D\rho}{Dt} + \rho (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u}) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

In the example below we can assume to have a [[Newtonian fluid]] as well as having {{mvar|ρ}} and {{mvar|μ}} both be constant.

Recall that mass continuity is simply the summation of the rate of mass in and the rate of mass out.
: rate of mass accumulated = rate of mass in − rate of mass out

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\Delta x \, \Delta \, y \Delta z \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} &amp;= \Delta y \, \Delta z \left (\rho U_x|_x - \rho U_x|_{x + \Delta x} \right) + \Delta x \Delta z \left(\rho U_y|_y - \rho U_y|_{y + \Delta y} \right) + \Delta \, x\Delta y \left (\rho U_z|_z - \rho U_z|_{z + \Delta z} \right ) \\[8pt]
\Rightarrow \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} &amp;= \frac{\rho U_x|_x - \rho U_x|_{x + \Delta x}}{\Delta x} + \frac{\rho U_y|_y- \rho U_y|_{y + \Delta y}}{\Delta y} + \frac{\rho U_z|_z - \rho U_z|_{z + \Delta z}}{\Delta z} \\[6pt]
&amp;= \rho \left (\frac{U_x|_x - U_x|_{x + \Delta x}}{\Delta x} + \frac{U_y|_y - U_y|_{y + \Delta y}}{\Delta y} + \frac{U_z|_z - U_z|_{z + \Delta z}}{\Delta z} \right ) \\[6pt]
&amp;= -\rho \left (\frac{\partial U_x}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial U_y}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial U_z}{\partial z} \right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Since there is no change in density {{mvar|ρ}} over time, {{math|{{sfrac|∂''ρ''|∂''t''}} {{=}} 0}}, we have:

:&lt;math&gt; 0 = -\rho \left (\frac{\partial U_x}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial U_y}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial U_z}{\partial z} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Recall that {{mvar|ρ}} is a constant thus proving the divergence theorem above.

==Stream function for 2D equations==
Taking the [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] of the Navier–Stokes equation results in the elimination of pressure. This is especially easy to see if 2D Cartesian flow is assumed (like in the degenerate 3D case with {{math|''u&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} 0}} and no dependence of anything on {{mvar|z}}), where the equations reduce to:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \rho \left(\frac{\partial u_x}{\partial t} + u_x \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial x} + u_y \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial y}\right)
 &amp;= -\frac{\partial p}{\partial x} + \mu \left(\frac{\partial^2 u_x}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u_x}{\partial y^2}\right) + \rho g_x \\
 \rho \left(\frac{\partial u_y}{\partial t} + u_x \frac{\partial u_y}{\partial x} + u_y \frac{\partial u_y}{\partial y}\right)
 &amp;= -\frac{\partial p}{\partial y} + \mu \left(\frac{\partial^2 u_y}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u_y}{\partial y^2}\right) + \rho g_y.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Differentiating the first with respect to {{mvar|y}}, the second with respect to {{mvar|x}} and subtracting the resulting equations will eliminate pressure and any [[conservative force]]. Defining the [[stream function]] {{mvar|ψ}} through

:&lt;math&gt;u_x = \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial y}; \quad u_y = -\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x}&lt;/math&gt;

results in mass continuity being unconditionally satisfied (given the stream function is continuous), and then incompressible Newtonian 2D momentum and mass conservation condense into one equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\nabla^2 \psi\right) + \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial y} \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\nabla^2 \psi\right) - \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x} \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(\nabla^2 \psi\right) = \nu \nabla^4 \psi&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|∇&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the 2D [[biharmonic operator]] and {{mvar|ν}} is the [[kinematic viscosity]], {{math|''ν'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''μ''|''ρ''}}}}. We can also express this compactly using the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian determinant]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\nabla^2 \psi\right) + \frac{\partial\left(\psi, \nabla^2\psi \right)}{\partial(y,x)} = \nu \nabla^4 \psi.&lt;/math&gt;

This single equation together with appropriate boundary conditions describes 2D fluid flow, taking only kinematic viscosity as a parameter. Note that the equation for [[creeping flow]] results when the left side is assumed zero.

In [[axisymmetric]] flow another stream function formulation, called the [[Stokes stream function]], can be used to describe the velocity components of an incompressible flow with one [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] function.

The incompressible Navier–Stokes equation is a [[differential algebraic equation]], having the inconvenient feature that there is no explicit mechanism for advancing the pressure in time. Consequently, much effort has been expended to eliminate the pressure from all or part of the computational process. The stream function formulation eliminates the pressure but only in two dimensions and at the expense of introducing higher derivatives and elimination of the velocity, which is the primary variable of interest.

==Properties==
===Nonlinearity===

The Navier–Stokes equations are [[nonlinear]] [[partial differential equations]] in the general case and so remain in almost every real situation.&lt;ref&gt;Fluid Mechanics (Schaum's Series), M. Potter, D.C. Wiggert, Schaum's Outlines, McGraw-Hill (USA), 2008, {{isbn|978-0-07-148781-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vectors, Tensors, and the basic Equations of Fluid Mechanics, R. Aris, Dover Publications, 1989, {{isbn|0-486-66110-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, such as one-dimensional flow and [[Stokes flow]] (or creeping flow), the equations can be simplified to linear equations. The nonlinearity makes most problems difficult or impossible to solve and is the main contributor to the [[turbulence]] that the equations model.

The nonlinearity is due to [[convective]] acceleration, which is an acceleration associated with the change in velocity over position. Hence, any convective flow, whether turbulent or not, will involve nonlinearity. An example of convective but [[laminar flow|laminar]] (nonturbulent) flow would be the passage of a viscous fluid (for example, oil) through a small converging [[nozzle]]. Such flows, whether exactly solvable or not, can often be thoroughly studied and understood.&lt;ref&gt;McGraw Hill Encyclopaedia of Physics (2nd Edition), C.B. Parker, 1994, {{isbn|0-07-051400-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turbulence===

[[Turbulence]] is the time-dependent [[Chaos theory|chaotic]] behavior seen in many fluid flows. It is generally believed that it is due to the [[inertia]] of the fluid as a whole: the culmination of time-dependent and convective acceleration; hence flows where inertial effects are small tend to be laminar (the [[Reynolds number]] quantifies how much the flow is affected by inertia). It is believed, though not known with certainty, that the Navier–Stokes equations describe turbulence properly.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedia of Physics (2nd Edition), R.G. Lerner, G.L. Trigg, VHC publishers, 1991, ISBN (Verlagsgesellschaft) 3-527-26954-1, ISBN (VHC Inc.) 0-89573-752-3&lt;/ref&gt;

The numerical solution of the Navier–Stokes equations for turbulent flow is extremely difficult, and due to the significantly different mixing-length scales that are involved in turbulent flow, the stable solution of this requires such a fine mesh resolution that the computational time becomes significantly infeasible for calculation or [[direct numerical simulation]]. Attempts to solve turbulent flow using a laminar solver typically result in a time-unsteady solution, which fails to converge appropriately. To counter this, time-averaged equations such as the [[Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations]] (RANS), supplemented with turbulence models, are used in practical [[computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD) applications when modeling turbulent flows. Some models include the [[Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model|Spalart–Allmaras]], [[k-omega turbulence model|{{mvar|k}}–{{mvar|ω}}]], [[turbulence kinetic energy|{{mvar|k}}–{{mvar|ε}}]], and SST models, which add a variety of additional equations to bring closure to the RANS equations. [[Large eddy simulation]] (LES) can also be used to solve these equations numerically. This approach is computationally more expensive—in time and in computer memory—than RANS, but produces better results because it explicitly resolves the larger turbulent scales.

===Applicability===
{{further|Discretization of Navier–Stokes equations}}
Together with supplemental equations (for example, conservation of mass) and well formulated boundary conditions, the Navier–Stokes equations seem to model fluid motion accurately; even turbulent flows seem (on average) to agree with real world observations.

The Navier–Stokes equations assume that the fluid being studied is a [[Continuum mechanics|continuum]] (it is infinitely divisible and not composed of particles such as atoms or molecules), and is not moving at [[Special relativity#Relativistic mechanics|relativistic velocities]]. At very small scales or under extreme conditions, real fluids made out of discrete molecules will produce results different from the continuous fluids modeled by the Navier–Stokes equations. For example, [[capillarity]] of internal layers in fluids appears for flow with high gradients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Another limitation is simply the complicated nature of the equations. Time-tested formulations exist for common fluid families, but the application of the Navier–Stokes equations to less common families tends to result in very complicated formulations and often to open research problems. For this reason, these equations are usually rewritten for [[Newtonian fluid]]s where the viscosity model is [[linear]]; truly general models for the flow of other kinds of fluids (such as blood) do not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Application to specific problems==
The Navier–Stokes equations, even when written explicitly for specific fluids, are rather generic in nature and their proper application to specific problems can be very diverse. This is partly because there is an enormous variety of problems that may be modeled, ranging from as simple as the distribution of static pressure to as complicated as [[multiphase flow]] driven by [[surface tension]].

Generally, application to specific problems begins with some flow assumptions and initial/boundary condition formulation, this may be followed by [[Scale analysis (mathematics)|scale analysis]] to further simplify the problem.

[[Image:NSConvection vectorial.svg|thumb|400px|Visualization of '''(a)''' parallel flow and '''(b)''' radial flow.]]

===Parallel flow===
Assume steady, parallel, one dimensional, non-convective pressure-driven flow between parallel plates, the resulting scaled (dimensionless) [[boundary value problem]] is:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2 u}{d y^2} = -1; \quad u(0) = u(1) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The boundary condition is the [[no slip condition]]. This problem is easily solved for the flow field:
:&lt;math&gt;u(y) = \frac{y - y^2}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

From this point onward more quantities of interest can be easily obtained, such as viscous drag force or net flow rate.

===Radial flow===
Difficulties may arise when the problem becomes slightly more complicated. A seemingly modest twist on the parallel flow above would be the ''radial'' flow between parallel plates; this involves convection and thus non-linearity. The velocity field may be represented by a function {{math|''f''(''z'')}} that must satisfy:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2 f}{d z^2} + R f^2 = -1; \quad f(-1) = f(1) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

This [[ordinary differential equation]] is what is obtained when the Navier–Stokes equations are written and the flow assumptions applied (additionally, the pressure gradient is solved for). The [[nonlinear]] term makes this a very difficult problem to solve analytically (a lengthy [[Implicit function|implicit]] solution may be found which involves [[elliptic integrals]] and [[Cubic formula|roots of cubic polynomials]]). Issues with the actual existence of solutions arise for {{math|''R'' &gt; 1.41}} (approximately; this is not [[square root of 2|{{sqrt|2}}]]), the parameter R being the Reynolds number with appropriately chosen scales.&lt;ref name="TM Shah"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shah |first=Tasneem Mohammad|title=Analysis of the multigrid method|journal=Nasa Sti/recon Technical Report N|volume=91|pages=23418|bibcode=1989STIN...9123418S|year=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an example of flow assumptions losing their applicability, and an example of the difficulty in "high" Reynolds number flows.&lt;ref name="TM Shah"/&gt;

===Convection===
A type of natural convection which can be described by the Navier–Stokes equation is the [[Rayleigh–Bénard convection]]. It is one of the most commonly studied convection phenomena because of its analytical and experimental accessibility.

==Exact solutions of the Navier–Stokes equations==
Some exact solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations exist. Examples of degenerate cases — with the non-linear terms in the Navier–Stokes equations equal to zero — are [[Hagen-Poiseuille equation|Poiseuille flow]], [[Couette flow]] and the oscillatory [[Stokes boundary layer]]. But also more interesting examples, solutions to the full non-linear equations, exist such as [[Jeffery–Hamel flow]], [[Von Kármán swirling flow]], [[Stagnation point flow]], [[Landau–Squire jet]], [[Taylor–Green vortex]].&lt;ref&gt;

Note that the existence of these exact solutions does not imply they are stable: turbulence may develop at higher Reynolds numbers.

Under additional assumptions, the component parts can be separated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.claudino.webs.com/Navier%20Stokes%20Equations.pps]&lt;/ref&gt;

(Note this is not a solution to the Clay Millennium problem because that refers to incompressible fluids where {{mvar|ρ}} is a constant, neither does it deal with the uniqueness of the Navier–Stokes equations with respect to any [[turbulence]] properties.) It is also worth pointing out that the components of the velocity vector are exactly those from the [[Pythagorean quadruple]] parametrization. Other choices of density and pressure are possible with the same velocity field:

{{hidden
|Other choices of density and pressure
|Another choice of pressure and density with the same velocity vector above is one where the pressure and density fall to zero at the origin and are highest in the central loop at {{math|''z'' {{=}} 0}}, {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}:

==Wyld diagrams==&lt;!-- [[Wyld diagrams]] redirects here--&gt;
'''Wyld diagrams''' are bookkeeping [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphs]] that correspond to the Navier–Stokes equations via a [[perturbation theory|perturbation expansion]] of the fundamental [[continuum mechanics]]. Similar to the [[Feynman diagram]]s in [[quantum field theory]], these diagrams are an extension of [[Mstislav Keldysh|Keldysh]]'s technique for nonequilibrium processes in fluid dynamics. In other words, these diagrams assign [[graph theory|graphs]] to the (often) [[turbulence|turbulent]] phenomena in turbulent fluids by allowing [[correlation function|correlated]] and interacting fluid particles to obey [[stochastic processes]] associated to [[pseudo-random]] [[function (mathematics)|functions]] in [[probability distribution]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Renormalization methods: A guide for beginners | first=W.

|From the general form of the Navier–Stokes, with the velocity vector expanded as {{math|'''u''' {{=}} (''u&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'',''u&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'',''u&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'')}}, sometimes respectively named {{mvar|u}}, {{mvar|v}}, {{mvar|w}}, we may write the vector equation explicitly,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 x&amp;:\ &amp;\rho \left(\frac{\partial u_x}{\partial t} + u_x \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial x} + u_y \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial y} + u_z \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial z}\right) &amp;= -\frac{\partial p}{\partial x} + \mu \left(\frac{\partial^2 u_x}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u_x}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u_x}{\partial z^2}\right) + \frac{1}{3} \mu \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial u_y}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial u_z}{\partial z} \right) + \rho g_x \\
 y&amp;:\ &amp;\rho \left(\frac{\partial u_y}{\partial t} + u_x \frac{\partial u_y}{\partial x} + u_y \frac{\partial u_y}{\partial y}+ u_z \frac{\partial u_y}{\partial z}\right) &amp;= -\frac{\partial p}{\partial y} + \mu \left(\frac{\partial^2 u_y}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u_y}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u_y}{\partial z^2}\right) + \frac{1}{3} \mu \frac{\partial}{\partial y} \left( \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial u_y}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial u_z}{\partial z} \right) + \rho g_y \\
 z&amp;:\ &amp;\rho \left(\frac{\partial u_z}{\partial t} + u_x \frac{\partial u_z}{\partial x} + u_y \frac{\partial u_z}{\partial y}+ u_z \frac{\partial u_z}{\partial z}\right) &amp;= -\frac{\partial p}{\partial z} + \mu \left(\frac{\partial^2 u_z}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u_z}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u_z}{\partial z^2}\right) + \frac{1}{3} \mu \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \left( \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial u_y}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial u_z}{\partial z} \right) + \rho g_z.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that gravity has been accounted for as a body force, and the values of {{mvar|g&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{mvar|g&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{mvar|g&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;}} will depend on the orientation of gravity with respect to the chosen set of coordinates.

The continuity equation reads:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial \left(\rho u_x \right) }{ \partial x} + \frac{\partial \left(\rho u_y\right) }{ \partial y} + \frac{\partial \left(\rho u_z\right) }{ \partial z} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

When the flow is incompressible, {{mvar|ρ}} does not change for any fluid particle, and its [[material derivative]] vanishes: {{math|{{sfrac|''Dρ''|''Dt''}} {{=}} 0}}. The continuity equation is reduced to:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial u_x }{ \partial x} + \frac{\partial u_y }{ \partial y} + \frac{\partial u_z }{ \partial z} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, for the incompressible version of the Navier–Stokes equation the second part of the viscous terms fall away (see [[Incompressible flow]]).

This system of four equations comprises the most commonly used and studied form. Though comparatively more compact than other representations, this is still a [[nonlinear]] system of [[partial differential equations]] for which solutions are difficult to obtain.

\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The gravity components will generally not be constants, however for most applications either the coordinates are chosen so that the gravity components are constant or else it is assumed that gravity is counteracted by a pressure field (for example, flow in horizontal pipe is treated normally without gravity and without a vertical pressure gradient). The continuity equation is:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(\rho r u_r\right) + \frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial \left(\rho u_\phi\right)}{\partial \phi} + \frac{\partial \left(\rho u_z\right)}{\partial z} = 0.
&lt;/math&gt;

This cylindrical representation of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations is the second most commonly seen (the first being Cartesian above). Cylindrical coordinates are chosen to take advantage of symmetry, so that a velocity component can disappear. A very common case is axisymmetric flow with the assumption of no tangential velocity ({{math|''u&lt;sub&gt;φ&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} 0}}), and the remaining quantities are independent of {{mvar|φ}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \rho \left(\frac{\partial u_r}{\partial t} + u_r \frac{\partial u_r}{\partial r} + u_z \frac{\partial u_r}{\partial z}\right)

Mass continuity will read:

These equations could be (slightly) compacted by, for example, factoring {{math|{{sfrac|1|''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}}} from the viscous terms. However, doing so would undesirably alter the structure of the Laplacian and other quantities.

==Navier–Stokes equations use in games==
The Navier–Stokes equations are used extensively in [[video games]] in order to model a wide variety of natural phenomena. Simulations of small-scale gaseous fluids, such as fire and smoke, are often based on the seminal paper "Real-Time Fluid Dynamics for Games"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

| year=2003
| title=Real-Time Fluid Dynamics for Games

}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Jos Stam]], which elaborates one of the methods proposed in Stam's earlier, more famous paper "Stable Fluids"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

| year=1999

}}&lt;/ref&gt; from 1999. Stam proposes stable fluid simulation using a Navier–Stokes solution method from 1968, coupled with an unconditionally stable semi-Lagrangian [[advection]] scheme, as first proposed in 1992.

More recent implementations based upon this work run on the game systems [[graphics processing unit]] (GPU) as opposed to the [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and achieve a much higher degree of performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Many improvements have been proposed to Stam's original work, which suffers inherently from high numerical dissipation in both velocity and mass.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6544">The '''need for affiliation''' ('''N-Affil''') is a term that was popularized by [[David McClelland]] and describes a person's [[need]] to feel a sense of involvement and "belonging" within a [[social group]]; McClellend's thinking was strongly influenced by the pioneering work of [[Henry Murray]] who first identified underlying psychological human needs and [[motivation]]al processes (1938). It was Murray who set out a taxonomy of needs, including achievement, [[Power (sociology)|power]] and affiliation—and placed these in the context of an integrated motivational model. People with a high need for affiliation require warm [[interpersonal relationship]]s and approval from those with whom they have regular contact. Having a strong bond with others make a person feel as if they are a part of something important that creates a powerful impact. People who place high emphasis on affiliation tend to be supportive team members, but may be less effective in [[leadership position]]s. A person who takes part in a group, whether it be a movement or project, create a push towards a sense of achievement and satisfaction for the individual and the whole. 

==Definition==
Affiliation is a positive, sometimes intimate, personal relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Zimbardo, P. &amp; Formica, R. (1963). Emotional Comparison and Self-Esteem as Determinants of Affiliation. Journal of Personality, 31(2), 142 -162.&lt;/ref&gt; Affiliation can include "concern over establishing, maintaining, or restoring a positive affective relationship with another person or persons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Byrne|first=D.|author2=U. Texas|title=Anxiety and the Experimental Arousal of Affiliation Need|journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology|date=1 November 1961|volume=63|series=3|page=660|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?sid=7a793d9a-cc25-4da7-91a5-72cebe7aceb5%40sessionmgr104&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=122&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=pdh&amp;AN=1963-01329-001|doi=10.1037/h0047251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Situations==
There are many situations in which people feel a need for affiliation. For example, in a business setting, when creating a new product there can be many different ideas on how to market the product. A recently hired employee might feel a need for affiliation to have their idea heard because they feel this is the best course of action. If that person's idea is a success then that individual will feel a sense of achievement. Thus, being new the employee, he decides to involve himself so he feels a sense of belonging to the rest of the employees. One situation that causes a greater need for affiliation is during a stressful situation. An example where there was an increase in the need for affiliation among individuals was right after the [[September 11 terrorist attack]] on the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]]. This event led to Americans' putting their differences aside and coming together. The increase in an individual's need for affiliation allowed individuals responding to the same [[stressor]] to come together and find security in one another. Situations that include [[fear]] often lead people to want to be together and trigger a need for affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;Kassin, S., Fein, S., &amp; Markus, H. (2008). Social Psychology Seventh Edition. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Research done by Schachter (1959) shows that fear that comes from anxiety increases the need for the person to affiliate with others who are going through the same situation or that could help them through the stressful event.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, C.R. (1979). Defining and measuring Affiliation Motivation. European Journal of Social Psychology, 9, 97-99.&lt;/ref&gt; The strength of this need changes from one person to the next, there are moments that people just want to be together.

The need for affiliation for an individual can vary over short amounts of time; there are times when individuals wish to be with others and other times to be alone. In one study, completed by Shawn O'Connor and Lorne Rosenblood, [[pager|beeper]]s were distributed to the students. The students were then asked to record, when their beepers went off, whether or not they wanted to be alone or if they wanted to be with others at that particular moment. This study was done to observe how frequently college students were in the presence of others and how frequently they were alone. The next step in this study asked for the students to record whether, at the time their beeper went off, they wanted to be alone or in the company of others. This response that they gave usually reflected which of the two situations they were experiencing the next time their beepers went off. The information retained from this study helped to show the strength of an individual's need for affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;O’Connor, S. C., &amp; Rosenblood, L.K. (1996). Affiliation motivation in everyday experience: A theoretical comparison. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 70, 513-522.&lt;/ref&gt; By showing how frequently they obtained the presence of others when they felt that it was what they wanted at that moment it showed how strong their need for affiliation was at that particular moment. 

Depending on the specific circumstances, an individual's level of need for affiliation can become increased or decreased. Yacov Rofe suggested that the need for affiliation depended on whether being with others would be useful for the situation or not. When the presence of other people was seen as being helpful in relieving an individual from some of the negative aspects of the stressor, an individual's desire to affiliate increases. However, if being with others may increase the negative aspects such as adding the possibility of embarrassment to the already present stressor, the individual's desire to affiliate with others decreases.&lt;ref&gt;Rofe, Y. (1984). Stress and affiliation: A utility theory. Psychological Review, 91, 235-250.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals are motivated to find and create a specific amount of social interactions. Each individual desires a different amount of a need for affiliation and they desire an optimal balance of time to their self and time spent with others.&lt;ref&gt;Kassin, S., Fein, S., &amp; Markus, H. (2008). Social Psychology Seventh Edition. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21333">The '''norm of reciprocity''' requires that we repay in kind what another has done for us.&lt;ref&gt;Whatley, M, A., Rhodes, A., Smith, R. H., Webster, J. M. (1999) ''The Effect of a Favor on Public and Private Compliance: How Internalized is the Norm of Reciprocity?''. Basic and Applied Social Psychology, 21(3), 251–259&lt;/ref&gt; It can be understood as the expectation that people will respond favorably to each other by returning benefits for benefits, and responding with either indifference or hostility to harms. The [[social norm]] of reciprocity often takes different forms in different areas of social life, or in different societies.  All of them, however, are distinct from related ideas such as [[gratitude]], the [[Golden Rule]], or mutual goodwill. See [[reciprocity (social and political philosophy)]] for an analysis of the concepts involved. The norm of reciprocity mirrors the concept of [[reciprocal altruism]] in [[evolutionary biology]]. However, [[evolutionary theory]] and therefore [[sociobiology]] was not well received by mainstream psychologists. This led to the revitalisation of reciprocal altruism underneath the new social psychological concept, norm of reciprocity. Reciprocal altruism has been applied to various species, including humans, while mainstream psychologists use the norm of reciprocity to only explain humans.

An underlying norm of reciprocity is by itself a powerful engine for motivating, creating, sustaining, and regulating the cooperative behavior required for self-sustaining social organizations, controlling the damage done by the unscrupulous, and contributing to social system stability.&lt;ref&gt;Alvin W. Gouldner. (1960) "The Norm of Reciprocity: A Preliminary Statement"&lt;/ref&gt; See the discussions in [[tit for tat]] and [[reciprocity (social psychology)]]. The power and ubiquity of the norm of reciprocity can be used against the unwary, however, and is the basis for the success of many malicious [[confidence games]]. Minor, usually less malicious examples are techniques used in [[advertising]] and other [[propaganda]] whereby a small gift of some kind is proffered with the expectation of producing a desire on the part of the recipient to reciprocate in some way, for example by purchasing a product, making a donation, or becoming more receptive to a line of argument. These minor examples include gifts of stickers and pens distributed by charities and flowers handed out by members of the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] group.

==Positive and negative==
Two key elements of the norm of reciprocity are positive and negative aspects to the term.

A positive norm of reciprocity is "the embedded obligations created by exchanges of benefits or favours among individuals. The recipient feels indebted to the favour or benefit giver until he/she repays" (Chen, 2009). The positive reciprocity norm is a common social expectation where a person who helps another person can expect positive feedback whether it's in the form of a gift, a compliment, a loan, a job reference, etc. In social psychology, positive reciprocity refers to responding to a positive action with another positive action (rewarding kind actions). This norm is so powerful, it allows the initial giver to ask for something in return for what was given rather than having to wait for a voluntary reciprocal act. In some cases, a person does not have to ask for the other person to return a favour because it's already implied. Reciprocity also works at the level of liking; We like people who help us, and dislike those who ask for help but never return it. Disapproval is often enough to make people comply with norm of reciprocity.

"A negative norm of reciprocity represents the means by which individuals act against unfavourable treatments, and functions to keep balance in social systems" (Chen, 2009). In contrast to the positive reciprocity norm', the negative reciprocity norm emphasizes the return of unfavourable treatment as an appropriate response to a misdeed. The principle of this norm serves as a powerful deterrent for violent or symbolic mistreatment in society. Harming others invites anger and revenge, therefore people receiving negative treatment are likely to retaliate in an angry manner. Studies have shown, that individuals with a propensity towards anger might more strongly endorse the negative reciprocity norm as a justification for consummating their hostility by punishing the instigator of mistreatment (Eisenberger, Lynch, Aselage and Rohdiek 2004).[1] Carlsmith, Darley, and Robinson (2002)[2] found that most college students believe that criminal punishment should be determined by the seriousness of the crime rather than by punishment's effectiveness in preventing similar crimes.

There are also contrasting ideas when it comes to the differentiation of negative and positive norms of reciprocity. "In contrast to a positive norm of reciprocity Gouldner (1960) also suggested a negative norm of reciprocity or sentiments of retaliation where the emphasis is placed not on the return of benefits but on the return of injuries" (Chen, 2009). So there is a slight grey line between what could be considered a positive norm and a negative norm. But both of these reciprocity norms are mechanisms adapted by humans in order to keep a balance among man kind. "Accordingly, both positive and negative norms or reciprocity serve as starting mechanisms as well as stabilizing functions in theta they help initiate and maintain equitable interpersonal exchanges in human evolution" (Chen, 2009).

==Private and public==
* Private reciprocation
The norm of reciprocity is usually internalised.&lt;ref&gt;Kelman, H. C. (1958). "Compliance, identification and internalisation: Three processes of attitude change." Journal of Conflict Resolution, 2, 51--60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thibaut, J. J.,&amp; Kelley, H. H. (1959). "The social psychology of groups." New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; All major ethical and religious traditions include reciprocity as a primary rule of moral behaviour – from Jesus (“As you would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.” to Confucius (“What you do not want done to yourself, do not do to others.”).&lt;ref&gt;Singer, P. (1981). "The expanding circle: Ethics and sociobiology." New York: Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux.&lt;/ref&gt; The moral character of the norm may encourage the sense that following it is an imperative rather than a choice, and failing to reciprocate should create feelings of self-reproach and guilt.&lt;ref&gt;Cialdini, R. B. (1993). "Influence: Science and practice (3rd ed.). Glenview, IL: Scott Foresman."&lt;/ref&gt;

* Public reciprocation
Another way to understand how the norm or reciprocity works is to understand that the initial favour and the following repayment always unfolds in a public way.&lt;ref&gt;Cialdini, R. B. (1993). "Influence: Science and practice (3rd ed.). Glenview, IL: Scott Foresman."&lt;/ref&gt; The social rewards of sticking to the norm and the costs of breaching it are profound.&lt;ref&gt;Asch, S. E. (1956). "Opinions and social pressure. Scientific American, 193, 31-35."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thibaut, J. J.,&amp; Kelley, H. H. (1959). "The social psychology of groups." New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; People deny continued group membership to others who conveniently breach the norm.&lt;ref&gt;Cialdini, R. B. (1993). "Influence: Science and practice (3rd ed.). Glenview, IL: Scott Foresman."&lt;/ref&gt;

The norm of reciprocity stipulates that the amount of the return to a favour is “roughly the same” as what had been received.&lt;ref&gt;Alvin W. Gouldner. (1960) "The Norm of Reciprocity: A Preliminary Statement"&lt;/ref&gt; Such idea of equivalence takes two forms;
# Heteromorphic reciprocity: Things exchanged can be totally different, but they are equal in value, as defined by the stakeholders in the situation.
# Homeomorphic reciprocity: Exchanges are identical in form, either with regard to the things exchanged or to the situations under which they are exchanged. Historically, the most significant expression of homeomorphic reciprocity is in the negative reciprocity norms; in retaliation, the focus is not on the return of benefits, but on the return of injuries.

However, Mark A. Whatley and colleagues (1999) found that people will give more favors, like a higher donation, if it is a public condition.&lt;ref&gt;Whatley, M, A., Rhodes, A., Smith, R. H., Webster, J. M. (1999) ''The Effect of a Favor on Public and Private Compliance: How Internalized is the Norm of Reciprocity?''. Basic and Applied Social Psychology, 21(3), 251–259&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance to social system stability==
Favours given are not immediately repaid and returning of favours may take a long time.&lt;ref&gt;Malinowski, B. (1922). "Argonauts of the Western Pacific: An Account of Native Enterprise and Adventure in the Archipelagos of Melanesian New Guinea." London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul.&lt;/ref&gt; Such intervening time period is governed by the norm of reciprocity in two manners. First, the stakeholder is assembling, mobilizing, liquidating resources or assets so as to make a suitable repayment. Second, it is a time period that the relevant party should not do harm to people who have given them benefits; people are morally constrained to demonstrate gratitude towards or maintain peace with their benefactors. As such, outstanding obligations can thus contribute to the stabilising of social systems by encouraging mutually beneficial exchange and cooperative behaviours.&lt;ref&gt;Alvin W. Gouldner. (1960) "The Norm of Reciprocity: A Preliminary Statement"&lt;/ref&gt;

The only "rough equivalence" of repayment aforementioned then suggests an important system-stabilising functions.&lt;ref&gt;Z. E. Eglar, Vartan B. (1958). "Institutionalized Reciprocity in a Changing Punjab Village", Ph.D. thesis, Columbia University&lt;/ref&gt; It introduces an element of ambiguity as to whether the indebtedness has been repaid fully, thus creating uncertainty on who the indebted parties are. The comparative indeterminancy then serves as a type of all-purpose moral cement; it keeps us mindful of our behaviours and induces cooperative action.

The norm of reciprocity also contributes to social stability even when there is a well-developed system of specific status duties; status duties shape behavior as the status occupant believe them binding in their own right; they are expected to faithfully fulfill their responsibilities. Nonetheless, the general norm of reciprocity offers another source of motivation and moral sanction for conforming with specific status obligations; if other people have been fulfilling their status responsibilities to you, you then have a second-order obligation to fulfill your status responsibilities to them as well. The feeling of gratitude reinforces that of rectitude and contributes to conformity, thus social stability.&lt;ref&gt;Whyte, W. F. (1945) "Street Corner Society", Chicago: University of Chicago Press, p.256&lt;/ref&gt;

==In organizational research==
[[Perceived organizational support]] (POS) and [[perceived psychological contract violation]] (PPCV) are the two most common measures of the reciprocity norm in [[organizational research]]. POS is the degree to which employees’ believe that their organization values their contributions and cares about their well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberger, R., Huntington, R., Huntington, S., &amp; Sowa, D. 1986. "Perceived organizational support". ''Journal of Applied Psychology'', 71: 500 –507.&lt;/ref&gt; POS is generally thought to be the organization’s contribution to a positive reciprocity dynamic with employees, as employees tend to perform better to pay back POS.&lt;ref&gt;Rhoades, L., &amp; Eisenberger, R. 2002. "Perceived organizational support: A review of the literature". ''Journal of Applied Psychology'', 87: 698–714.&lt;/ref&gt;  PPCV is a construct that regards employees’ feelings of disappointment (ranging from minor frustration to betrayal) arising from their belief that their organization has broken its work-related promises, is generally thought to be the organization’s contribution to a negative reciprocity dynamic, as employees tend to perform more poorly to pay back PPCV.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, S. L. 1996. "Trust and breach of the psychological contract". ''Administrative Science Quarterly'', 41: 574 –599.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, S. L., Kraatz, M., &amp; Rousseau, D. M. 1994. "Changing obligations and the psychological contract: A longitudinal study". ''Academy of Management Journal'', 37: 137–152.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David R. Hekman]] and colleagues found that professional employees, such as doctors and lawyers, are most likely to repay POS with better performance when they have high levels of [[organizational identification]] combined with low levels of [[professional identification]]. Professional employees are most forgiving of PPCV when they have high levels of [[organizational identification]] combined with low levels of [[professional identification]].&lt;ref&gt;Hekman, D.R., Steensma, H.K., Bigley, G.A., Hereford, J.F., (2009) “[http://journals.aomonline.org/inpress/main.asp?action=preview&amp;art_id=473&amp;p_id=1&amp;p_short=AMJ Combined Effects of Organizational and Professional Identification on the Reciprocity Dynamic for Professional Employees] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104021342/http://journals.aomonline.org/InPress/main.asp?action=preview&amp;art_id=473&amp;p_id=1&amp;p_short=AMJ |date=2009-01-04 }}.”  ''Academy of Management Journal''.  Vol. 52, No. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The norms of reciprocity in interactions among employees underlie [[Adam Grant]]'s distinction between [[Organizational culture#Adam Grant|"giver cultures" and "taker cultures"]] as two end-points of a scale, with "matcher cultures" in between.

==In evolutionary psychology==

[[Evolutionary psychologist]]s have used the norm of reciprocity to explain altruism by emphasizing our expectations that “helping others will increase the likelihood that they will help us in the future.” The underlying justification lies in the human desire to reciprocate kindness and cooperate for survival value has enabled our continued existence in a hostile world. Thus, the norm of reciprocity ultimately has survival value.&lt;ref&gt;Aronson, W. A. (2007). Social Psychology 6th Edition. New Jersey: Pearson Education, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, being as this sentiment is intrinsic to our evolutionary history and existence, adherence to the norm would constitute “natural” behavior whose neglect might necessarily cause a degree of dissonance in an individual who, among many other self-concepts, consciously labels himself a human being, perhaps leading to a reduction in self-esteem. The norm of reciprocity is [[reciprocal altruism]], a concept coined by the evolutionary biologist [[Robert Trivers]]. However, the rise of [[sociobiology]] was not well received by mainstream psychologists. It is therefore not surprising that the stigma of the evolutionary theory led reciprocal altruism to be revitalised underneath the name "norm of reciprocity". The norm of reciprocity is arguably less scientifically advanced than reciprocal altruism, due to the degree of research underneath the name "reciprocal altruism" as opposed to the name "norm of reciprocity".

==In developmental psychology==

[[Developmental psychologist]]s have studied the norm of reciprocity and the development of this norm in children. Psychologists have found that children begin to show the reciprocal behavior around the age of two, when they observe the behavior of others and begin to have their own relationships with peers. One way that psychologists have been able to study the norm of reciprocity in children is by observing and experimenting on their toy sharing behaviour. Kristina R. Olson and Elizabeth S. Spelke (2007) conducted an experiment is which they used dolls to represent family members and friends and gave the child various items to distribute to the dolls after a series of situations were explained to the child. These situations represented private and public reciprocity and gave the child the choice of which dolls to share the items with. An example of a situation involves one of the dolls sharing with the rest of them. Olson and Spelke found that children will give to family and friends more than strangers, repay those who shared with them, and reward those who share with others, even if they do not receive the item.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, K.R., Spelke, E.S. (2007). "Foundations of Cooperation in Young Children". Science Direct Cognition 108, 222-231&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologists Ken J. Rotenberg and Luanne Mann have also explored the development of the reciprocity norm of self-disclosure and its functions in children’s attraction to peers. The findings have indicated that the norm of the reciprocity is involved in attraction to peers only by six-grade; children of this year group showed such effect by reporting greater affection towards others who reciprocated the same amount of intimacy than those whose intimacy level deviated from the initiator’s.&lt;ref&gt;Rotenberg, K. J., Mann, L. (1986) "The Development of the Norm of the reciprocity of Self-Disclosure and Its Function in Children's attraction to Peers."&lt;/ref&gt; According to Youniss's (1980) theory of social development, children's friendship during the early part of middle childhood (5–8 years) is based upon the reciprocity of behaviour that suggests a "tit-for-tat" rule of exchange and interaction. During the later part of middle childhood (9–11 years) and beyond, children's friendship is based on the reciprocity of behaviour that suggests a mutually cooperative principle of exchange as well as an appreciation of reciprocity.&lt;ref&gt;Youniss, J. (1980) "Parents and peers in social development." Chicago: University of chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies==
A study was done in 2000 that consisted of 116 MBA students enrolled in a part-time MBA program at a business school, in the north east of the United States (Chen, 2009). The study consisted of two parts, the first part was to complete a series of self perception questions, which included the measure of the relational-self orientation (Chen, 2009). The second part was to complete a work relationship exercise during a class session 6 weeks later than the first task. "In the exercise, participants
read a vignette in which they were asked to imagine that they were the focal person in a reward allocation scenario at work" (Chen, 2009). They were then told that they worked hard on the project together with a colleague, and made the same sort of effort and contribution to the project. Their supervisor then agreed to give $1000 reward. They were then given the following options on how to divide the money: 
(A) Your colleague will make a proposal as to how the money should be divided.
(B) If you accept the proposal, then you will get what the colleague proposed to you. However, if you reject it, then the
money will return to the company for future reward considerations. 
Measures were calculated on how many people would reject the proposal or accept the proposal. And the results were positively and negatively skewed. If the two persons were close friends or colleagues the acceptance rate was 62% if the offer was 20% of the 1000 dollars, and 100% if the offer was 80% of the money (Chen, 2009). If the colleagues were distant then the rates were 20% for 20% of the money and 77% for 80% of the money (Chen, 2009).

'''Nylon-eating bacteria''' are a strain of ''[[Flavobacterium]]'' that are capable of digesting certain [[by-product]]s of [[nylon 6]] manufacture. This strain of ''Flavobacterium'' sp. K172, became popularly known as nylon-eating bacteria, and the enzymes used to digest the man-made molecules became popularly known&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn16834-five-classic-examples-of-gene-evolution/ |author=Michael Le Page |title=Five classic examples of gene evolution |date=March 2009 |website=New Scientist |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as '''nylonase'''.

==Discovery==
[[File:6-Aminocaproic acid.png|thumb|Chemical structure of [[Aminocaproic acid|6-aminohexanoic acid]]]]
In 1975, a team of Japanese scientists discovered a strain of ''[[Flavobacterium]]'', living in ponds containing [[Wastewater|waste water]] from a [[nylon]] factory, that was capable of digesting certain byproducts of [[nylon 6]] manufacture, such as the linear dimer of [[Aminocaproic acid|6-aminohexanoate]]. These substances are not known to have existed before the invention of [[nylon]] in 1935.

Further study{{Clarify|post-text=(In the same paper, as implied by the position of the reference note?)|date=March 2015}} revealed that the three [[enzyme]]s the [[bacteria]] were using to digest the byproducts were significantly different from any other enzymes produced by other ''Flavobacterium'' strains (or, for that matter, any other bacteria), and not effective on any material other than the manmade nylon byproducts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kinoshita, S. |author2=Kageyama, S. |author3=Iba, K. |author4=Yamada, Y. |author5=Okada, H. |title=Utilization of a cyclic dimer and linear oligomers of e-aminocaproic acid by Achromobacter guttatus |journal=Agricultural and Biological Chemistry |volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=1219–23 |year=1975 |issn=0002-1369 |doi=10.1271/bbb1961.39.1219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later research==
This discovery led geneticist [[Susumu Ohno]] in a paper published in April 1984 to speculate that the gene for one of the enzymes, 6-aminohexanoic acid hydrolase, had come about from the combination of a [[gene duplication]] event with a [[frameshift mutation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ohno S |title=Birth of a unique enzyme from an alternative reading frame of the preexisted, internally repetitious coding sequence |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=81 |issue=8 |pages=2421–5 |date=April 1984 |pmid=6585807 |pmc=345072 |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=6585807 |doi=10.1073/pnas.81.8.2421|bibcode=1984PNAS...81.2421O }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ohno suggested that many unique new genes have evolved this way.

A 2007 paper that described a series of studies by a team led by [[Seiji Negoro]] of the [[University of Hyogo]], Japan, suggested that in fact no frameshift mutation was involved in the evolution of the 6-aminohexanoic acid hydrolase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Negoro S, Ohki T, Shibata N, etal |title=Nylon-oligomer degrading enzyme/substrate complex: catalytic mechanism of 6-aminohexanoate-dimer hydrolase |journal=J. Mol. Biol. |volume=370 |issue=1 |pages=142–56 |date=June 2007 |pmid=17512009 |doi=10.1016/j.jmb.2007.04.043 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many other genes have been discovered which did evolve by gene duplication followed by a frameshift mutation affecting at least part of the gene.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}

A 1995 paper showed that scientists have also been able to induce another species of bacterium, ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'', to evolve the capability to break down the same nylon byproducts in a laboratory by forcing them to live in an environment with no other source of nutrients.  The ''P. aeruginosa'' strain did not seem to use the same enzymes that had been utilized by the original ''[[Flavobacterium]]'' strain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Prijambada ID, Negoro S, Yomo T, Urabe I |title=Emergence of nylon oligomer degradation enzymes in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO through experimental evolution |journal=Appl. Environ. Microbiol. |volume=61 |issue=5 |pages=2020–2 |date=May 1995 |pmid=7646041 |pmc=167468 |url=http://aem.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=7646041}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As described in a 1983 publication, other scientists were able to get the ability to generate the enzymes to transfer from the ''Flavobacterium'' strain to a strain of ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' bacteria via a [[plasmid]] transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Negoro S, Taniguchi T, Kanaoka M, Kimura H, Okada H |title=Plasmid-determined enzymatic degradation of nylon oligomers |journal=J. Bacteriol. |volume=155 |issue=1 |pages=22–31 |date=July 1983 |pmid=6305910 |pmc=217646 |url=http://jb.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=6305910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in evolution teaching==
{{main|Nylon-eating bacteria and creationism}}
There is scientific consensus that the capacity to synthesize nylonase most probably developed as a single-step mutation that survived because it improved the fitness of the bacteria possessing the mutation. More importantly, the enzyme involved was produced by a mutation completely randomizing the original gene. Despite this, the new gene still had a novel, albeit weak, catalytic capacity. This is seen as a good example of how mutations easily can provide the raw material for [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thwaites WM |title=New Proteins Without God's Help |journal=Creation Evolution Journal |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=1–3 |date=Summer 1985 |url=http://ncse.com/cej/5/2/new-proteins-without-gods-help}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmsr.org/nylon.htm Evolution and Information: The Nylon Bug]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9452500/page/2/ Why scientists dismiss 'intelligent design'], Ker Than, [[MSNBC]],  Sept. 23, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Kenneth R.

The multiplier "shows that if the percentage of men and women in the room who make questionable remarks to the other sex is equal and the percentage of women in the room is lower than the percentage of men, then the average woman experiences far more sexist comments than the average man."&lt;ref name="petrie"/&gt;

==Mathematical formulation==

Gent defined the multiplier in the following terms:&lt;ref name="gent"/&gt;

{{quote|With 20% women the gender ratio is 1:4.  So there are 4 times as many men to make sexist remarks, so 4 times as many sexist remarks are made to women as to men. But there are 4 times fewer women to receive sexist remarks, so each individual woman is four times as likely to receive a given remark than an individual man is.  These effects multiply, so in this example the mean number of sexist remarks per woman is 16 times the number per man.  This holds in general, so with a gender ratio of {{math|1:''r''}}, women will receive {{math|''r''²}} times as many sexist remarks as men.}}

The Petrie multiplier corresponds to [[Lanchester's square law]] in [[battle]] and [[predator–prey dynamics]].

==Criticism==

The model assumes that men and women are equally sexist. Further, each sexist remark made by a man is assumed to randomly target one of the women and vice versa.&lt;ref name="eliazar"&gt;{{cite journal
|first=Iddo|last=Eliazar
|title=Sociophysics of sexism: normal and anomalous petrie multipliers

|date=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more complex analysis published in the [[Journal of Physics A]] modeled heterogeneous levels of sexism by assuming each person to make sexist remarks according to an independent [[Poisson process]], maintaining the assumption that each sexist remarks is directed to an individual of the opposite sex. Under these conditions the Petrie multiplier takes the form {{math|''cr''&lt;sup&gt;1 + ϵ&lt;/sup&gt;, 0 ≤ ''ϵ'' ≤  1}}.&lt;ref name="eliazar"/&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
However, one commentator used a [[Monte Carlo simulation]] to eliminate the assumption that people have a fixed number of sexist remarks to make, and found that women suffer from overwhelmingly more sexism in an environment where both genders are equally sexist.&lt;ref name="chart"&gt;{{cite web

In [[psychoanalysis]], the '''primal scene''' ({{lang-de|Urszene}}) is the initial witnessing by a child of a [[Human sexual behavior|sex act]], usually between the parents, that [[Psychological trauma|traumatizes]] the [[psychosexual development]] of that child. The scene witnessed may also occur between animals, and be [[Displacement (psychology)|displaced]] onto humans.

The expression "primal scene" refers to the sight of sexual relations between the parents, as observed, constructed, or fantasized by the child and interpreted by the child as a scene of violence. The scene is not understood by the child, remaining enigmatic but at the same time provoking sexual excitement.

==Freud's views==

===Evolution===
The term appeared for the first time in Freud's published work apropos of the "[[Sergei Pankejeff|Wolf Man]]" case (1918b [1914]), but the notion of a sexual memory experienced too early to have been translated into verbal images, and thus liable to return in the form of conversion symptoms or obsessions, was part of his thinking as early as 1896 [as witnessed in his letter of May 30 of that year to [[Wilhelm Fliess]], where he evokes a "surplus of sexuality" that "impedes translation" (1950a, pp.&amp;nbsp;229–230)]. Here Freud is already close to the model of the trauma and its "[[Afterwardsness|deferred]]" effect. The following year, in his letter to Fliess of May 2, Freud uses the actual term ''Urszene'' for the first time;&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Case Studies II'' (PFL 9) p. 270n&lt;/ref&gt; and gives the approximate age when in his estimation children were liable to "hear things" that they would understand only "subsequently" as six or seven months (SE 1, p.&amp;nbsp;247). The subject of the child's witnessing parental coitus came up as well, albeit in an older child, with the case of "Katharina," in the ''[[Studies on Hysteria]]'' (1895d), and Freud evoked it yet again in ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'', with the fantasy of the young man who dreamed of watching his parents copulating during his life in the womb (1900a [addition of 1909], pp.&amp;nbsp;399–400).

===Fantasy or reality?===
Freud persistently strove to decide whether the primal scene was a fantasy or something actually witnessed; above all, he placed increasing emphasis on the child's own fantasy interpretation of the scene as violence visited upon the mother by the father. He went so far, in "On the Sexual Theories of Children" (1908c, p.&amp;nbsp;221), as to find a measure of justification for what he called the "sadistic concept of coitus",&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Sexuality'' (PFL 7) p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that, though the child may exaggerate, the perception of a real repugnance towards sexual intercourse on the part of a mother fearful of another pregnancy may be quite accurate. In the case of "[[Little Hans]]," however, the violence was explained in terms of a prohibition: Hans deemed it analogous to "smashing a window-pane or forcing a way into an enclosed space" (1909b, p.&amp;nbsp;41).

The case history of the Wolf Man gave Freud the opportunity not only to pursue the issue of the reality of the primal scene, but also to propose the idea that it lay at the root of childhood (and later adult) neurosis: the sexual development of the child was "positively splintered up by it" (1918b [1914), pp.&amp;nbsp;43–44).  In his ''[[Introduction to Psychoanalysis|Introductory Lectures]]'', however, he argued for the universality of the fantasy of the primal scene (like the sexual theories of children): it may be encountered in all neurotics, if not in every human being (Freud, 1915f), and it belongs in the category of "primal" fantasies. It appears, however, not to have the same force for all individuals.  Freud would later assign a central place to the primal scene in his analysis of [[Marie Bonaparte]], although in her case the scene took place between her nanny and a groom (Bonaparte, 1950–53).

Looked upon as an actual event rather than as a pure fantasy reconstructed in a retrospective way (as with [[Carl Jung]]'s ''zurückphantasieren''), the primal scene had a much more marked traumatic impact, and this led Freud to insist on the "reality" of such scenes, thus returning to the debate over event-driven (or "historical") reality versus psychic reality. Beyond the issue of the scene itself, however, it was the whole subject of fantasy that was thus raised (in chapter five of the Wolf Man case-history [1918b, pp.&amp;nbsp;48–60]), discussed in terms that would be picked up by Freud again later in ''Constructions in Analysis'' (1937d).

It was not merely, in Freud's view, that the technique of psychoanalysis demanded that fantasies be treated as realities so as to give their evocation all the force they needed, but also that many "real" scenes were not accessible by way of recollection, but solely by way of dreams. Whether a scene was constructed out of elements observed elsewhere and in a different context (for example, animal coitus transposed to the parents); reconstituted on the basis of clues (such as bloodstained sheets); or indeed observed directly, but at an age when the child still had not the corresponding verbal images at its disposal; did not fundamentally alter the basic facts of the matter: "I intend on this occasion," wrote Freud, "to close the discussion of the reality of the primal scene with a non liquet" (1918b, p.&amp;nbsp;60).

==Kleinian interpretations==

[[Melanie Klein]]'s view of the primal scene differed from Freud's, for where Freud saw an enigmatic perception of violence, she saw the child's projective fantasies. Klein considered that a child's curiosity was first provoked by the primal scene, and that typically the child felt both excited and excluded by the primal scene.&lt;ref&gt;David Mann, ''Psychotherapy, an Erotic Relationship'' (1997) p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; The sexual relationship between the parents, fantasized as continuous, is also the basis of the "combined-parent figure",&lt;ref&gt;David Mann, ''Psychotherapy, an Erotic Relationship'' (1997) p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; mother and father seen as locked in mutual (but excluding) gratification.

Where Klein laid emphasis on the way the infant projected hostile and destructive tendencies onto the primal scene, with the mother pictured therein as just as dangerous for the father as the father is for her, later Kleinians like [[John Steiner (psychoanalyst)|John Steiner]] have stressed the creative aspect of the primal scene; and the necessity in analysis of overcoming a [[Splitting (psychology)|splitting]] of its image between a loving couple on the one hand, and a combined parent figure locked in hate.&lt;ref&gt;David Mann, ''Psychotherapy, an Erotic Relationship'' (1997) p. 141 and p. 196&lt;/ref&gt;

==General characteristics==

The primal scene is inseparable from the sexual theories of childhood that it serves to create. This disturbing representation, which at once acknowledges and denies the familiar quality of the parents, excludes the child even as it concerns them, as witness the libidinal excitement the child feels in response. [[Otto Fenichel]] has stressed the traumatic nature of the excess excitement felt by the child, which they are unable to process — what he called the "overwhelming unknown".&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 214-5 and p. 483&lt;/ref&gt;

The particularity of the primal scene lies in the fact that the subject experiences in a simultaneous and contradictory way the emergence of the unknown within a familiar world, to which they are bound by vital needs, by expectations of pleasure, and by the self-image that it reflects back to them. The lack of common measure between the child's emotional and psychosexual experience and the words that could give an account of the primal scene creates a gulf that the sexual theories of childhood attempt to bridge. A sadistic reading of the scene combines the child's curiosity about both the origin and the end of life in a representation in which death and life are indeed fused.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

==Intertextual readings==
Ned Lukacher has proposed using the term in literary criticism to refer to a kind of intertextuality in which the ability to interpret one text depends on the meaning of another text. It is "the interpretive impasse that arises when a reader has good reason to believe that the meaning of one text is historically dependent on the meaning of another text or on a previously unnoticed set of criteria, even though there is no conclusive evidential or archival means of establishing the case beyond a reasonable doubt."&lt;ref&gt;Ned Lukacher, ''Primal Scenes'' (Cornell University Press, 1986), p. 24 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Spkk4Rlmo7cC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=intitle:primal+intitle:scenes&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES#PPA24,M1 online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural examples==

In [[mathematics]], a property is any characteristic that applies to a given set.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mathsisfun.com/sets/sets-introduction.html Retrieved October 15 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Rigorously, a property ''p'' defined for all elements of a set ''X'' is usually defined as a function ''p'': ''X'' →  {true, false}, that is true whenever the property holds; or equivalently, as the subset of ''X'' for which ''p'' holds; i.e. the set {''x''&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;''p''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;true}; ''p'' is its [[indicator function]]. However, it may be objected that the rigorous definition defines merely the [[extension (semantics)|extension]] of a property, and says nothing about what causes the property to hold for exactly those values.

Examples of properties include the [[commutative property]] of [[real number|real]] and [[complex number]]s and the [[distributive property]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25631">In [[mathematics]], particularly in [[abstract algebra]], a '''semigroup with involution''' or a '''*-semigroup''' is a [[semigroup]] equipped with an [[Involution (mathematics)|involutive]] [[anti-automorphism]], which&amp;mdash;roughly speaking&amp;mdash;brings it closer to a [[group (mathematics)|group]] because this involution, considered as [[unary operator]], exhibits certain fundamental properties of the operation of taking the inverse in a group: uniqueness, double application "cancelling itself out", and the same interaction law with the binary operation as in the case of the group inverse. It is thus not a surprise that any group is a semigroup with involution. However, there are significant natural examples of semigroups with involution that are not groups.

An example from [[linear algebra]] is the [[Matrix multiplication|multiplicative]] [[monoid]] of [[Real number|real]] square [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] of order&amp;nbsp;''n'' (called the [[full linear monoid]]). The [[Map (mathematics)|map]] which sends a matrix to its [[transpose]] is an involution because the transpose is well defined for any matrix and obeys the law {{nowrap|1=(''AB'')&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; = ''B''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;''A''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;}}, which has the same form of interaction with multiplication as taking inverses has in the [[general linear group]] (which is a subgroup of the full linear monoid). However, for an arbitrary matrix ''AA''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; does not equal the identity element (namely the [[diagonal matrix]]). Another example, coming from [[formal language]] theory, is the [[free semigroup]] generated by a [[nonempty set]] (an [[Alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]]), with string [[concatenation]] as the binary operation, and the involution being the map which [[String (computer science)#Reversal|reverse]]s the [[linear order]] of the letters in a string. A third example, from basic [[set theory]], is the set of all [[binary relation]]s between a set and itself, with the involution being the [[converse relation]], and the multiplication given by the usual [[composition of relations]].

Semigroups with involution appeared explicitly named in a 1953 paper of [[Viktor Wagner]] (in Russian) as result of his attempt to bridge the theory of semigroups with that of [[semiheap]]s.&lt;ref name="Hollings2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Hollings|title=Mathematics across the Iron Curtain: A History of the Algebraic Theory of Semigroups|year=2014|publisher=American Mathematical Society|isbn=978-1-4704-1493-1|page=265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formal definition==
Let ''S'' be a [[semigroup]] with its binary operation written multiplicatively. An involution in ''S'' is a [[unary operation]] * on ''S'' (or, a transformation * : ''S'' → ''S'',  ''x'' ↦ ''x''*) satisfying the following conditions:
# For all ''x'' in ''S'', (''x''*)* = ''x''.
# For all ''x'', ''y'' in ''S'' we have (''xy'')* = ''y''*''x''*.

The semigroup ''S'' with the involution * is called a semigroup with involution.

Semigroups that satisfy only the first of these axioms belong to the larger class of [[U-semigroup]]s.

In some applications, the second of these axioms has been called [[antidistributive]].&lt;ref name="BrinkKahl1997"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Chris Brink|author2=Wolfram Kahl|author3=Gunther Schmidt|title=Relational Methods in Computer Science|date=1997|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-211-82971-4|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the natural philosophy of this axiom, [[Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter|H.S.M. Coxeter]] remarked that it "becomes clear when we think of [x] and [y] as the operations of putting on our socks and shoes, respectively."&lt;ref&gt;H.S.M. Coxeter, ''Introduction to Geometry'', p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
# If ''S'' is a [[commutative]] semigroup then the [[identity function|identity map]] of S is an involution.
# If ''S'' is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] then the inversion map * : ''S'' → ''S''  defined by ''x''* = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;  is an involution. Furthermore, on an [[abelian group]] both this map and the one from the previous example are involutions satisfying the axioms of semigroup with involution.&lt;ref name="BergChristensen2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=C. van den Berg|author2=J. P. R. Christensen|author3=P. Ressel|title=Harmonic Analysis on Semigroups: Theory of Positive Definite and Related Functions|year=2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4612-1128-0|pages=87–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# If ''S'' is an [[inverse semigroup]] then the inversion map is an involution which leaves the [[idempotent]]s [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariant]]. As noted in the previous example, the inversion map is not necessarily the only map with this property in an inverse semigroup. There may well be other involutions that leave all idempotents invariant; for example the identity map on a commutative regular, hence inverse, semigroup, in particular, an abelian group. A [[regular semigroup]] is an [[inverse semigroup]] if and only if it admits an involution under which each idempotent is an invariant.&lt;ref&gt;Munn, Lemma 1&lt;/ref&gt;
# Underlying every [[C*-algebra]] is a *-semigroup. An important [[C*-algebra#Finite-dimensional C*-algebras|instance]] is the algebra ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;('''C''') of ''n''-by-''n'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] over '''[[Complex number|C]]''', with the [[conjugate transpose]] as involution.
# {{anchor|ex5}} If ''X'' is a set, the set of all [[binary relation]]s on ''X'' is a *-semigroup with the * given by the [[converse relation]], and the multiplication given by the usual [[composition of relations]]. This is an example of a *-semigroup which is not a regular semigroup.
# {{anchor|ex6}} If X is a set, then the set of all finite sequences (or  [[String (computer science)|strings]]) of members of X forms a [[free monoid]] under the operation of concatenation of sequences, with sequence reversal as an involution.
# {{anchor|ex7}} A [[rectangular band]] on a Cartesian product of a set ''A'' with itself, i.e. with elements from ''A'' × ''A'', with the semigroup product defined as (''a'', ''b'')(''c'', ''d'') = (''a'', ''d''), with the involution being the order reversal of the elements of a pair (''a'', ''b'')* = (''b'', ''a''). This semigroup is also a [[regular semigroup]], as all bands are.&lt;ref name="Nordahl and Scheiblich"&gt;Nordahl and Scheiblich&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic concepts and properties==
An element ''x'' of a semigroup with involution is sometimes called ''hermitian'' (by analogy with a [[Hermitian matrix]]) when it is left invariant by the involution, meaning ''x''* = ''x''. Elements of the form ''xx''* or ''x''*''x'' are always hermitian, and so are all powers of a hermitian element. As noted in the examples section,  a semigroup ''S'' is an [[inverse semigroup]] if and only if ''S'' is a [[regular semigroup]] and admits an involution such that every idempotent is hermitian.&lt;ref&gt;Easdown, David, and W. D. Munn. "On semigroups with involution." Bulletin of the Australian Mathematical Society 48.01 (1993): 93-100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain basic concepts may be defined on *-semigroups in a way that parallels the notions stemming from a [[Regular semigroup|regular element in a semigroup]]. A ''partial isometry'' is an element ''s''  such that ''ss''*''s'' = ''s''; the set of partial isometries of a semigroup ''S'' is usually abbreviated PI(''S'').&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; A ''projection'' is an idempotent element ''e'' that is also hermitian, meaning that ''ee'' = ''e'' and ''e''* = ''e''. Every projection is a partial isometry, and for every partial isometry ''s'', ''s''*''s'' and ''ss''* are projections. If ''e'' and ''f'' are projections, then ''e'' = ''ef'' if and only if ''e'' = ''fe''.&lt;ref name="L117"&gt;Lawson, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

Partial isometries can be [[partial order|partially ordered]] by ''s'' ≤ ''t'' defined as holding whenever ''s'' = ''ss''*''t'' and ''ss''* = ''ss''*''tt''*.&lt;ref name="L117"/&gt; Equivalently, ''s'' ≤ ''t'' if and only if  ''s'' = ''et'' and ''e'' = ''ett''* for some projection ''e''.&lt;ref name="L117"/&gt; In a *-semigroup, PI(''S'') is an [[ordered groupoid]] with the [[Partial groupoid|partial product]] given by ''s''&amp;sdot;''t'' = ''st'' if ''s''*''s'' = ''tt''*.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples ===
In terms of examples for these notions, in the *-semigroup of binary relations on a set, the partial isometries are the relations that are [[difunctional]]. The projections in this *-semigroup are the [[partial equivalence relation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson p.122 and p.35&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[partial isometry|partial isometries]] in a C*-algebra are exactly those defined in this section. In the case of ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;('''C''') more can be said. If ''E'' and ''F'' are projections, then ''E'' ≤ ''F'' if and only if [[Image (mathematics)|im]]''E'' ⊆ im''F''. For any two projection, if ''E'' ∩ ''F'' = ''V'', then the unique projection ''J'' with image ''V'' and kernel the [[orthogonal complement]] of ''V'' is the meet of ''E'' and ''F''. Since projections form a meet-[[semilattice]], the partial isometries on ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;('''C''') form an inverse semigroup with the product &lt;math&gt;A(A^*A\wedge BB^*)B&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson p.120&lt;/ref&gt;

Another simple example of these notions appears in the next section.

== Notions of regularity ==
There two related, but not identical notions of regularity in *-semigroups. They were introduced nearly simultaneously by Nordahl &amp; Scheiblich (1978) and respectively Drazin (1979).&lt;ref&gt;Crvenkovic and Dolinka&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regular *-semigroups (Nordahl &amp; Scheiblich) ===
As mentioned in the [[#Examples|previous examples]], [[inverse semigroup]]s are a subclass of *-semigroups. It is also textbook knowledge that an inverse semigroup can be characterized as a regular semigroup in which any two idempotents commute. In 1963, [[Boris M. Schein]] has published the following two axioms providing an analogous characterization of inverse semigroups as a [[Variety (universal algebra)|subvariety]] of *-semigroups:

* ''x'' = ''xx''*''x''
* (''xx''*)(''x''*''x'') = (''x''*''x'')(''xx''*)

The first of these looks like the definition of a regular element, but is actually in terms of the involution. Likewise, the second axiom appears to be describing the commutation of two idempotents. It is known however that regular semigroups do not form a variety because their class does not contain [[free object]]s (a result established by [[D. B. McAlister]] in 1968). This line of reasoning motivated Nordahl and Scheiblich to begin in 1977 the study of the (variety of) *-semigroups that satisfy only the first these two axioms; because of the similarity in form with the property defining regular semigroups, they named this variety regular *-semigroups.

It is a simple calculation to establish that a regular *-semigroup is also a regular semigroup because ''x''* turns out to be an inverse of ''x''. The rectangular band from [[#ex7|example 7]] is a regular *-semigroup that is not an inverse semigroup.&lt;ref name="Nordahl and Scheiblich"/&gt; It is also easy to verify that in a regular *-semigroup the product of any two projections is an idempotent.&lt;ref&gt;Nordahl and Scheiblich, Theorem 2.5&lt;/ref&gt; In the aforementioned rectangular band example, the projections are elements of the form (''x'', ''x'') and [like all elements of a band] are idempotent. However, two different projections in this band need not commute, nor is their product necessarily a projection since (''a'', ''a'')(''b'', ''b'') = (''a'', ''b'').

Semigroups that satisfy only ''x''** = ''x'' = ''xx''*''x'' (but not necessarily the antidistributivity of * over multiplication) have also been studied under the name of [[I-semigroup]]s.

====P-systems====
The problem of characterizing when a regular semigroup is a regular *-semigroup (in the sense of Nordahl &amp; Scheiblich) was addressed by M. Yamada (1982). He defined a '''P-system''' F(S) as subset of the idempotents of S, denoted as usual by E(S). Using the usual notation V(''a'') for the inverses of ''a'', F(S) needs to satisfy the following axioms:

# For any ''a'' in S, there exists a unique a° in V(''a'') such that ''aa''° and ''a''°''a'' are in F(S)
# For any ''a'' in S, and b in F(S), ''a°ba'' is in F(S), where ° is the well-defined operation from the previous axiom
# For any ''a'', ''b'' in F(S), ''ab'' is in E(S); note: not necessarily in F(S)

A regular semigroup S is a *-regular semigroup, as defined by Nordahl &amp; Scheiblich, if and only if it has a p-system F(S). In this case F(S) is the set of projections of S with respect to the operation ° defined by F(S). In an [[inverse semigroup]] the entire semilattice of idempotents is a p-system. Also, if a regular semigroup S has a p-system that is multiplicatively closed (i.e. subsemigroup), then S is an inverse semigroup. Thus, a p-system may be regarded as a generalization of the semilattice of idempotents of an inverse semigroup.

===*-regular semigroups (Drazin)===
{{anchor|Drazin}}
{{expand section|clarify motivation for studying these|date=April 2015}}
A semigroup ''S'' with an involution * is called a '''*-regular semigroup''' (in the sense of Drazin) if for every ''x'' in ''S'', ''x''* is ''H''-equivalent to some inverse of ''x'', where ''H'' is the [[Green's relations|Green’s relation]] ''H''. This defining property can be formulated in several equivalent ways. Another is to say that every [[Green's relations#The L.2C R.2C and J relations|''L''-class]] contains a projection. An axiomatic definition is the condition that for every ''x'' in ''S'' there exists an  element ''x''′ such that {{nowrap|1=''x''′''xx′'' = ''x''′}}, {{nowrap|1=''xx''′''x'' = ''x''}}, {{nowrap|1=(''xx''′)* = ''xx''′}}, {{nowrap|1=(''x''′''x'')* = ''x''′''x''}}. [[Michael P. Drazin]] first proved that given ''x'', the element ''x′'' satisfying these axioms is unique. It is called the Moore&amp;ndash;Penrose inverse of ''x''. This agrees with the classical definition of the [[Moore–Penrose inverse]] of a square matrix.
In the [[Matrix multiplication|multiplicative]] semigroup ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''C'') of square matrices of order ''n'', the map which assigns a matrix ''A'' to its [[Hermitian conjugate]] ''A''* is an involution. The semigroup ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''C'') is a *-regular semigroup with this involution. The Moore–Penrose inverse of A in this *-regular semigroup is the classical Moore–Penrose inverse of ''A''.

==Free semigroup with involution ==
As with all varieties, the [[category theory|category]] of semigroups with involution admits [[free object]]s. The construction of a free semigroup (or monoid) with involution is based on that of a [[free semigroup]] (and respectively that of a free monoid). Moreover, the construction of a [[free group]] can easily be derived by refining the construction of a free monoid with involution.&lt;ref name="L51"&gt;Lawson p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Generator (mathematics)|generators]] of a free semigroup with involution are the elements of the union of two ([[equinumerous]]) [[disjoint sets]] in [[Bijection|bijective correspondence]]: &lt;math&gt;Y=X\sqcup X^\dagger&lt;/math&gt;. (Here the notation &lt;math&gt;\sqcup\,&lt;/math&gt; emphasized that the union is actually a [[disjoint union]].) In the case were the two sets are finite, their union ''Y'' is sometimes called an ''[[Alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]] with involution''&lt;ref name="EhrenfeuchtHarju1999"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrzej Ehrenfeucht|author2=T. Harju|author3=Grzegorz Rozenberg|title=The Theory of 2-structures: A Framework for Decomposition and Transformation of Graphs|year=1999|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-981-02-4042-4|pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a ''symmetric alphabet''.&lt;ref name="Sakarovitch"&gt;{{cite book|title=Elements of Automata Theory|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=305–306|author=Jacques Sakarovitch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Let &lt;math&gt;\theta:X\rightarrow X^\dagger&lt;/math&gt; be a bijection; &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is naturally [[Function (mathematics)#Restrictions and extensions|extended]] to a bijection &lt;math&gt;{ }\dagger: Y \to Y&lt;/math&gt; essentially by taking the disjoint union of &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; (as a set) with its [[inverse function|inverse]], or in [[piecewise]] notation:&lt;ref name="Lipscomb1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen Lipscomb|title=Symmetric Inverse Semigroups|year=1996|publisher=American Mathematical Soc.|isbn=978-0-8218-0627-2|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;y^\dagger = 
\begin{cases}
  \theta(y) &amp; \text{if } y \in X \\
  \theta^{-1}(y) &amp; \text{if } y \in X^\dagger
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

Now construct &lt;math&gt;Y^+\,&lt;/math&gt; as the [[free semigroup]] on &lt;math&gt;Y\,&lt;/math&gt; in the usual way with the binary (semigroup) operation on &lt;math&gt;Y^+\,&lt;/math&gt; being [[concatenation]]:

: &lt;math&gt;w = w_1w_2 \cdots w_k \in Y^+&lt;/math&gt; for some letters &lt;math&gt;w_i\in Y.&lt;/math&gt;

The bijection &lt;math&gt;\dagger&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is then extended as a bijection &lt;math&gt;{ }^\dagger:Y^+\rightarrow Y^+&lt;/math&gt; defined as the string reversal of the elements of &lt;math&gt;Y^+\,&lt;/math&gt; that consist of more than one letter:&lt;ref name="EhrenfeuchtHarju1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lipscomb1996"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;w^\dagger=w_k^\dagger w_{k-1}^\dagger \cdots w_{2}^\dagger w_{1}^\dagger.&lt;/math&gt;

This map is an [[#Formal definition|involution]] on the semigroup &lt;math&gt;Y^+\,&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the semigroup &lt;math&gt;(X\sqcup X^\dagger)^+&lt;/math&gt; with the map &lt;math&gt;{ }^\dagger\,&lt;/math&gt; is a semigroup with involution, called a '''free semigroup with involution''' on ''X''.&lt;ref name="L172"&gt;Lawson p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; (The irrelevance of the concrete identity of &lt;math&gt;X^\dagger&lt;/math&gt; and of the bijection &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; in this choice of terminology is explained below in terms of the universal property of the construction.) Note that unlike in [[#ex6|example 6]], the involution ''of every letter'' is a distinct element in an alphabet with involution, and consequently the same observation extends to a free semigroup with involution.

If in the above construction instead of &lt;math&gt;Y^+\,&lt;/math&gt; we use the [[free monoid]]  &lt;math&gt;Y^*=Y^+\cup\{\varepsilon\}&lt;/math&gt;, which is just the free semigroup extended with the [[empty word]] &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon\,&lt;/math&gt; (which is the [[identity element]] of the [[monoid]] &lt;math&gt;Y^*\,&lt;/math&gt;), and suitably extend the involution with &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon^\dagger = \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;,
we obtain a '''free monoid with involution'''.&lt;ref name="Lipscomb1996"/&gt;

The construction above is actually the only way to extend a given map &lt;math&gt;\theta\,&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;X\,&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;X^\dagger\,&lt;/math&gt;, to an involution on &lt;math&gt;Y^+\,&lt;/math&gt; (and likewise on &lt;math&gt;Y^*\,&lt;/math&gt;). The qualifier "free" for these constructions is justified in the usual sense that they are [[universal algebra|universal construction]]s. In the case of the free semigroup with involution, given an arbitrary semigroup with involution &lt;math&gt;S\,&lt;/math&gt; and a map &lt;math&gt;\Phi:X\rightarrow S&lt;/math&gt;, then a [[semigroup homomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;\overline\Phi:(X\sqcup X^\dagger)^+\rightarrow S&lt;/math&gt; exists such that &lt;math&gt;\Phi = \iota \circ \overline\Phi&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\iota : X \rightarrow (X\sqcup X^\dagger)^+&lt;/math&gt; is the [[inclusion map]] and [[composition of functions]] is taken in [[Function composition#Alternative notations|diagram order]].&lt;ref name="L172"/&gt; The construction of &lt;math&gt;(X\sqcup X^\dagger)^+&lt;/math&gt; as a semigroup with involution is unique up to [[isomorphism]]. An analogous argument holds for the free monoid with involution in terms of [[monoid homomorphism]]s and the uniqueness up to isomorphism of the construction of &lt;math&gt;(X\sqcup X^\dagger)^*&lt;/math&gt; as a monoid with involution.

The construction of a [[free group]] is not very far off from that of a free monoid with involution. The additional ingredient needed is to define a notion of [[reduced word]] and a [[rewriting]] rule for producing such words simply by deleting any adjacent pairs of letter of the form &lt;math&gt;xx^\dagger&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;x^\dagger x&lt;/math&gt;. It can be shown than the order of rewriting (deleting) such pairs does not matter, i.e. any order of deletions produces the same result.&lt;ref name="L51"/&gt; (Otherwise put it, these rules define a [[Confluence (abstract rewriting)|confluent]] rewriting system.) Equivalently, a free group is constructed from a free monoid with involution by taking the [[Quotient algebra|quotient]] of the latter by the [[Congruence relation|congruence]] &lt;math&gt;\{ (yy^\dagger, \varepsilon) : y\in Y\}&lt;/math&gt;, which is sometimes called the '''Dyck congruence'''&amp;mdash;in a certain sense it generalizes [[Dyck language]] to multiple kinds of "parentheses", however simplification in the Dyck congruence takes place regardless of order, e.g. if ")" is the inverse of "(", then &lt;math&gt;()=)(=\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;; the one-sided congruence that appears in the Dyck language proper &lt;math&gt;\{ (xx^\dagger, \varepsilon) : x\in X\}&lt;/math&gt;, which instantiates only to &lt;math&gt;()=\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is (perhaps confusingly) called the '''Shamir congruence'''. The quotient of a free monoid with involution by the Shamir congruence is not a group, but a monoid &lt;!--with involution?--&gt;; nevertheless it has been called the '''free half group''' by its first discoverer&amp;mdash;[[Eli Shamir]]&amp;mdash; although more recently it has been called the '''involutive monoid''' generated by ''X''.&lt;ref name="Sakarovitch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DrosteKuich2009"&gt;{{cite book|editors=Manfred Droste, Werner Kuich, Heiko Vogler|title=Handbook of Weighted Automata|year=2009|publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-642-01492-5|page=271|authors=Ion Petre and [[Arto Salomaa]]|chapter=Algebraic Systems and Pushdown Automata}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This latter choice of terminology conflicts however with the use of "involutive" to denote any semigroup with involution&amp;mdash; a practice also encountered in the literature.&lt;ref name="Neeb2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Karl-Hermann Neeb|title=Holomorphy and Convexity in Lie Theory|year=2000|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-015669-0|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BeltramettiCassinelli2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Enrico G.

== Baer *-semigroups ==
{{expand section|date=April 2015}}
A Baer *-semigroup is a *-semigroup with (two-sided) zero in which the right annihilator of every element coincides with the [[semigroup ideal|right ideal]] of some projection; this property is expressed formally as: for all ''x'' ∈ ''S'' there exists a projection ''e'' such that
: { ''y'' ∈ ''S'' | ''xy'' = 0 } = ''eS''.&lt;ref name="BeltramettiCassinelli2010"/&gt;

The projection ''e'' is in fact uniquely determined by ''x''.&lt;ref name="BeltramettiCassinelli2010"/&gt;

More recently, Baer *-semigroups have been also called '''Foulis semigroups''', after [[David James Foulis]] who studied them in depth.&lt;ref name="Blyth2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harding, John. “Daggers, Kernels, Baer *-Semigroups, and Orthomodularity.” ''Journal of Philosophical Logic''. April 6, 2013. {{doi|10.1007/s10992-013-9275-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples and applications ===
The set of all binary relations on a set (from [[#ex5|example 5]]) is a Baer *-semigroup.&lt;ref name="Foulis63"&gt;Foulis, D. J. Relative inverses in Baer *-semigroups. Michigan Math. J. 10 (1963), no. 1, 65--84. {{doi|10.1307/mmj/1028998825}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Baer *-semigroups are also encountered in [[quantum mechanics]],&lt;ref name="BeltramettiCassinelli2010"/&gt; in particular as the multiplicative semigroups of [[Baer *-ring]]s.

If ''H'' is a [[Hilbert space]], then the multiplicative semigroup of all [[bounded operator]]s on ''H'' is a Baer *-semigroup. The involution in this case maps an operator to its [[adjoint operator|adjoint]].&lt;ref name="Foulis63"/&gt;

Baer *-semigroup allow the [[coordinatization]] of [[orthomodular lattice]]s.&lt;ref name="Blyth2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=T.S. Blyth|title=Lattices and Ordered Algebraic Structures|year=2006|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-84628-127-3|pages=101–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Surya Majapahit''' (The Sun of Majapahit) is the emblem commonly found in ruins dated from the [[Majapahit]] era. The emblem commonly took the form of an eight-pointed [[sun]] ray with the rounded part in the center depicting [[Hindu]] deities. The emblem might have taken the form of a [[cosmology|cosmological]] diagram haloed by typical "Surya Majapahit" sun rays,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Bullough Nigel,| title= Historic East Java, Remains in Stone, 50th Anniversary of Indonesia Commemorative Edition | publisher = ADLine Communications | year= 1995| location =Jakarta| page =109 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or a simple circle with typical sun rays. Because of the popularity of this sun emblem during the Majapahit era, it is suggested that the sun emblem served as the imperial symbol or [[emblem]] of the Majapahit empire.

==Hindu deities==
The most common depiction of Surya Majapahit consists of the images of nine deities and eight sun rays.
The round center of the sun depicting nine Hindu gods called ''[[Guardians of the directions|Dewata Nawa Sanga]]''. The major gods in the center is arranged in eight cardinal points around one god in the center. The arrangements are:
*Center: [[Shiva]]
*East: [[Isvara]]
*West: [[Shiva|Mahadeva]]
*North: [[Vishnu]]
*South: [[Brahma]]
*Northeast: [[Shiva|Sambhu]]
*Northwest: [[Shiva|Sangkara]]
*Southeast: [[Maheshvara|Mahesora]]
*Southwest: [[Rudra]]

The minor deities located at the outer rim of the sun, symbolized by eight shining sun rays:
*East: [[Indra]]
*West: [[Varuna]]
*North: [[Kubera]]
*South: [[Yama]]
*Northeast: [[Ishana|Isana]]
*Northwest: [[Vayu]]
*Southeast: [[Agni]]
*Southwest: [[Nirṛti]]

[[File:Surya Majapahit.jpg|thumb|right|Another render of Surya Majapahit, taken from Majapahit temple ruins, National Museum Jakarta]]

The emblem is rendered in many forms; sometimes it took the form of the circle of deities and sun rays, or just a simple eight-pointed sun ray such as the emblematic Surya Majapahit set into the ceiling of [[Candi Penataran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Bullough Nigel,| title= Historic East Java, Remains in Stone, 50th Anniversary of Indonesia Commemorative Edition | publisher = ADLine Communications | year= 1995| location =Jakarta| page =91 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The deities in the sun arranged as cosmological diagram in the form of a [[mandala]]. Another variation of Surya Majapahit is the eight pointed sun rays with the god of sun [[Surya]] in the center riding celestial horse or chariot.
The carving of Surya Majapahit usually can be found on the center ceiling of the [[Garbhagriha]] (inner sanctum) of the temple such as Bangkal, Sawentar, and [[Candi Jawi|Jawi]] temple. Surya Majapahit also can be found on the Stella, carving of [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]] or [[Aura (paranormal)|aura]] at the back of the statue's head. The carving of Surya Majapahit also commonly found in gravestone dating from Majapahit era, such as the Troloyo cemetery in [[Trowulan]].

{{Platonism}}

The &lt;!-- "theory" lowercase as in all other theories--&gt;'''theory of Forms''' or '''theory of Ideas'''&lt;ref&gt;Modern English textbooks and translations prefer "theory of Form" to "theory of Ideas", but the latter has a long and respect tradition starting with Cicero and continuing in German philosophy until present, and some English philosophers prefer this in English too.  See W. D. Ross, Plato's ''Theory of Ideas'' (1951).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!-- This quote has to be checked including the erroneous volume no. (there are only 2), the missing page number, and the uppercase "theory"--&gt; The name of this aspect of Plato's thought is not modern and has not been extracted from certain dialogues by modern scholars. However, it is attributed to Plato without any direct textual evidence that Plato himself holds the views of the speakers of the dialogues. The term was used at least as early as [[Diogenes Laertius]], who called it (Plato's) "Theory of Ideas:" {{lang|grc|Πλάτων ἐν τῇ περὶ τῶν ἰδεῶν ὑπολήψει}}..., {{cite encyclopedia | title=Plato | encyclopedia=Lives of Eminent Philosophers | volume=Book III | page=Paragraph 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plato uses many different words for what is traditionally called ''form'' in English translations and ''idea'' in German and Latin translations (Cicero). These include ''idéa'', ''morphē'', ''eîdos'', and ''parádeigma'', but also ''génos'', ''phýsis'', and ''[[Ousia|ousía]]''. He also uses expressions such as ''to x auto'', "the x itself" or ''kath' auto'' "in itself". See Christian Schäfer: ''Idee/Form/Gestalt/Wesen'', in ''Platon-Lexikon'', Darmstadt 2007, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; is a viewpoint attributed to [[Plato]], which holds that non-physical (but [[Ousia|substantial]]) forms (or ideas)&lt;!--not uppercase here because normal English words modified by the descriptive "abstract"--&gt; represent the most accurate reality.&lt;ref&gt;''Forms (usually given a capital F) were properties or essences of things, treated as non-material abstract, but substantial, entities. They were eternal, changeless, supremely real, and independent of ordinary objects that had their being and properties by 'participating' in them.''&lt;/ref&gt; When used in this sense, the word ''form''&lt;!-- but not the article--&gt; or ''idea'' is often capitalized.&lt;ref&gt;"Chapter 28: Form" of ''The Great Ideas: A Synopticon of Great Books of the Western World'' (Vol. II). Encyclopædia Britannica (1952), p. 526–542. This source states that ''Form'' or ''Idea'' get capitalized according to this convention when they refer "to that which is separate from the characteristics of material things and from the ideas in our mind."&lt;/ref&gt; Plato speaks of these entities only through the characters (primarily [[Socrates]]) of his dialogues who sometimes suggest that these Forms are the only objects of study that can provide knowledge. The theory itself is contested from within Plato's dialogues, and it is a general point of controversy in philosophy. Even whether the theory represents Plato's own views is held in doubt by modern scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first=Stephen | last=Watt | contribution=Introduction: The Theory of Forms (Books 5-7) | title=Plato: Republic | year=1997 | pages=xiv–xvi | place=London | publisher=Wordsworth Editions | isbn=1-85326-483-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the theory is considered [[Platonic realism|a classical solution]] to the [[problem of universals]].

The early Greek concept of form precedes attested philosophical usage and is represented by a number of words mainly having to do with vision, sight, and appearance. 

==Forms&lt;!--linked from 'Third man argument'--&gt;==
The meaning of the term {{lang|grc|εἶδος}} (''eidos''), "visible form", and related terms μορφή (''morphē''), "shape",&lt;ref&gt;Possibly cognate with Sanskrit ''bráhman''. See Thieme (1952): ''Bráhman'', ZDMG, vol. 102, p. 128.{{cite web | title=ZDMG online | url=http://menadoc.bibliothek.uni-halle.de/dmg/periodical/titleinfo/93820}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and φαινόμενα (''phainomena''), "appearances", from φαίνω (''phainō''), "shine", [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] ''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/bʰeh₂-|''*bʰeh₂-'']]'' or ''*bhā-''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=*bhā- | work=American Heritage Dictionary: Fourth Edition: Appendix I | year=2000 | url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE36.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; remained stable over the centuries until the beginning of philosophy, when they became equivocal, acquiring additional specialized philosophic meanings. The [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic philosophers]], starting with [[Thales]], noted that appearances change, and began to ask what the thing that changes "really" is. The answer was [[Substance theory|substance]], which stands under the changes and is the actually existing thing being seen. The status of appearances now came into question. What is the form really and how is that related to substance?

Thus, the theory of matter and form (today's [[hylomorphism]]) was born. Starting with at least Plato and possibly germinal in some of the presocratics the forms were considered as being "in" something else, which Plato called nature (''physis''). The latter seemed as carved "wood",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=H.G. |last=Liddell |first2=R. |last2=Scott |first3=J.M. |last3=Whiton |year=1891 |title=A Lexicon Abridged From Liddell &amp; Scott's Greek-English Lexicon |publisher=Harper |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nxoyBcpUuEsC&amp;pg=PA725 |page=725}}&lt;/ref&gt; ὕλη (''hyle'') in [[Greek language|Greek]], corresponding to ''materia'' in [[Latin]], from which the English word "[[Matter (philosophy)|matter]]" is derived,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=matter | work=American Heritage Dictionary: Fourth Edition | year=2000 | url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/51/M0155100.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; shaped by receiving (or exchanging) forms.

The Forms are expounded upon in Plato's dialogues and general speech, in that every object or quality in reality has a form: dogs, human beings, mountains, colors, courage, love, and goodness. Form answers the question, "What is that?" Plato was going a step further and asking what Form itself is. He supposed that the object was essentially or "really" the Form and that the phenomena were mere shadows mimicking the Form; that is, momentary portrayals of the Form under different circumstances. [[The problem of universals]] – how can one thing in general be many things in particular – was solved by presuming that Form was a distinct singular thing but caused plural representations of itself in particular objects. For example, [[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]] states, "Nor, again, if a person were to show that all is one by partaking of one, and at the same time many by partaking of many, would that be very astonishing. But if he were to show me that the absolute one was many, or the absolute many one, I should be truly amazed."&lt;ref name="Parmenides"&gt;{{cite book | title=[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p129}} Matter is considered particular in itself. For Plato, forms, such as beauty, are more real than any objects that imitate them. Though the forms are timeless and unchanging, physical things are in a constant change of existence. Where forms are unqualified perfection, physical things are qualified and conditioned.&lt;ref&gt;Kidder, D. S. and Oppenheim, N. D. (2006), The Intellectual Devotional, p27, Borders Group, Inc, Ann Arbor, {{ISBN|978-1-60961-205-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

These Forms are the essences of various objects: they are that without which a thing would not be the kind of thing it is. For example, there are countless tables in the world but the Form of tableness is at the core; it is the essence of all of them.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' 389: "For neither does every smith, although he may be making the same instrument for the same purpose, make them all of the same iron. The form must be the same, but the material may vary ...."&lt;/ref&gt; Plato's Socrates held that the world of Forms is transcendent to our own world (the world of substances) and also is the essential basis of reality. Super-ordinate to matter, Forms are the most pure of all things. Furthermore, he believed that true knowledge/intelligence is the ability to grasp the world of Forms with one's mind.&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'' 185d–e: "...the mind in itself is its own instrument for contemplating the common terms that apply to everything." "Common terms" here refers to ''existence, non-existence, likeness, unlikeness, sameness, difference, unity'' and ''number''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Form is ''aspatial'' (transcendent to space) and ''atemporal'' (transcendent to time). Atemporal means that it does not exist within any time period, rather it provides the formal basis for time.  It therefore formally grounds beginning, persisting and ending. It is neither eternal in the sense of existing forever, nor mortal, of limited duration. It exists transcendent to time altogether.&lt;ref&gt;The creation of the universe is the creation of time: "For there were no days and nights and months and years ... but when he (God) constructed the heaven he created them also." — ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', paragraph 37. For the creation God used "the pattern of the unchangeable," which is "that which is eternal." — paragraph 29. Therefore "eternal" – ''to aïdion'', "the everlasting" – as applied to Form means atemporal.&lt;/ref&gt; Forms are aspatial in that they have no spatial dimensions, and thus no orientation in space, nor do they even (like the point) have a location.&lt;ref&gt;Space answers to matter, the place-holder of form: "... and there is a third nature (besides Form and form), which is space (chōros), and is eternal (aei "always", certainly not atemporal), and admits not of destruction and provides a home for all created things ... we say of all existence that it must of necessity be in some place and occupy space ...." — ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', paragraph 52. Some readers will have long since remembered that in Aristotle time and space are accidental forms. Plato does not make this distinction and concerns himself mainly with essential form. In Plato, if time and space were admitted to be form, time would be atemporal and space aspatial.&lt;/ref&gt; They are non-physical, but they are not in the mind. Forms are extra-mental (i.e. real in the strictest sense of the word).&lt;ref&gt;These terms produced with the English prefix a- are not ancient. For the usage refer to {{cite web | title=a- (2) | work=Online Etymology Dictionary | url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=a- }} They are however customary terms of modern metaphysics; for example, see {{cite book | first=Martha C. | last=Beck | title=Plato's Self-Corrective Development of the Concepts of Soul, Form and Immortality in Three Arguments of the Phaedo | publisher=Edwin Mellon Press | year=1999 | isbn=0-7734-7950-3 | page=148 }} and see {{cite book | first=Dr. Katherine | last=Hawley | title=How Things Persist | year=2001 | publisher=Clarendon Press | location=Oxford | isbn=0-19-924913-X | nopp=true | page=Chapter 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Form is an objective "blueprint" of perfection.&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' 28: "The work of the creator, whenever he looks to the unchangeable and fashions the form and nature of his work after an unchangeable pattern, must necessarily be made fair and perfect ...."&lt;/ref&gt;  The Forms are perfect themselves because they are unchanging.  For example, say we have a triangle drawn on a blackboard.  A triangle is a polygon with 3 sides.  The triangle as it is on the blackboard is far from perfect.  However, it is only the intelligibility of the Form "triangle" that allows us to know the drawing on the chalkboard is a triangle, and the Form "triangle" is perfect and unchanging. It is exactly the same whenever anyone chooses to consider it; however, the time is that of the observer and not of the triangle.

=== Etymology ===
The words, εἶδος (''eidos'') and ἰδέα (''idea'') come from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] root [[Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/weyd-|''*weyd-'']] or ''*weid-'' "see" (cognate with [[Sanskrit]] ''vétti''). ''Eidos'' (though not ''idea'') is already attested in texts of the [[Homer|Homeric]] era, the earliest Greek literature. This transliteration and the translation tradition of German and Latin lead to the expression "theory of Ideas." The word is however not the English "idea," which is a mental concept only.

===Terminology===
[[File:Allegory of the Cave blank.png|thumb|In the [[Allegory of the Cave]], the objects that are seen are not real, according to Plato, but literally mimic the real Forms.]]
The English word "form" may be used to translate two distinct concepts that concerned Plato—the outward "form" or appearance of something, and "Form" in a new, technical nature, that never&lt;blockquote&gt;...assumes a form  like that of any of the things which enter into her; ... But the forms which enter into and go out of her are the likenesses  of real existences modelled after their patterns in a wonderful and inexplicable manner....&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=aLnWAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA470 Plato's ''Republic'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The objects that are seen, according to [[Plato]], are not real, but literally ''mimic'' the real Forms. In the [[Allegory of the Cave]] expressed in ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', the things that are ordinarily perceived in the world are characterized as shadows of the real things, which are not perceived directly. That which the observer understands when he views the world mimics the [[archetype]]s of the many [[type (metaphysics)|types]] and [[property (metaphysics)|properties]] (that is, of [[universal (metaphysics)|universals]]) of things observed.

===Intelligible realm and separation of the Forms===
Plato often invokes, particularly in his dialogues ''[[Phaedo]]'', ''Republic'' and ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'', poetic language to illustrate the mode in which the Forms are said to exist. Near the end of the ''Phaedo'', for example, Plato describes the world of Forms as a pristine region of the physical universe located above the surface of the Earth (''Phd.'' 109a-111c). In the ''Phaedrus'' the Forms are in a "place beyond heaven" (''huperouranios topos'') (''Phdr.'' 247c ff); and in the ''Republic'' the sensible world is contrasted with the intelligible realm (''noēton topon'') in the famous Allegory of the Cave.

It would be a mistake to take Plato's imagery as positing the intelligible world as a literal physical space apart from this one.&lt;ref&gt;"No sensible man would insist that these things are as I have described them..." (''Phd.'' 114d).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"there is no Platonic 'elsewhere', similar to the Christian 'elsewhere'." ([[Iris Murdoch]], "Metaphysics as a Guide to Morals" (London, Chatto &amp; Windus 1992)  399).&lt;/ref&gt;  Plato emphasizes that the Forms are not beings that extend in space (or time), but subsist apart from any physical space whatsoever.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato-metaphysics/#3 Plato's Middle Period Metaphysics and Epistemology]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus we read in the ''Symposium'' of the Form of Beauty: "It is not anywhere in another thing, as in an animal, or in earth, or in heaven, or in anything else, but itself by itself with itself," (211b). And in the ''Timaeus'' Plato writes: "Since these things are so, we must agree that that which keeps its own form unchangingly, which has not been brought into being and is not destroyed, which neither receives into itself anything else from anywhere else, ''nor itself enters into anything anywhere'', is one thing," (52a, emphasis added).

===Ideal state===
{{original research|date=February 2016}}
According to Plato, Socrates postulated a world of ideal Forms, which he admitted were impossible to know. Nevertheless, he formulated a very specific description of that world, which did not match his metaphysical principles. Corresponding to the world of Forms is our world, that of the shadows, an imitation of the real one.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. the Analogy of the Cave, Rep. 514a–520a.&lt;/ref&gt; Just as shadows exist only because of the light of a fire, our world exists as, "the offspring of the good".&lt;ref&gt;Republic, 508b trans. Grube&lt;/ref&gt; Our world is modeled after the patterns of the Forms. The function of humans in our world is therefore to imitate the ideal world as much as possible which, importantly, includes imitating the good, i.e. acting morally.

Plato lays out much of this theory in the "Republic" where, in an  attempt to define Justice, he considers many topics including the constitution of the ideal state. While this state, and the Forms, do not exist on earth, because their imitations do, Plato says we are able to form certain well-founded opinions about them, through a theory called recollection.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Phaedo, Meno, Phaedrus&lt;/ref&gt;

The republic is a greater imitation of Justice:&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph 420.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Our aim in founding the state was not the disproportional happiness of any one class,&lt;ref&gt;The word is ''ethnos'', "people". For the full range of meanings consult the [[American Heritage Dictionary]] online under [http://www.bartleby.com/61/88/E0228800.html ethnic].&lt;/ref&gt; but the greatest happiness of the whole; we thought that in a state ordered with a view to the good of the whole we should be most likely to find justice.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The key to not know how such a state might come into existence is the word "founding" (''oikidzomen''), which is used of colonization.{{clarify|date=October 2012}} It was customary in such instances to receive a constitution from an elected or appointed lawgiver; however in Athens, lawgivers were appointed to reform the constitution from time to time (for example, [[Draco (lawgiver)|Draco]], [[Solon]]). In speaking of reform, Socrates uses the word "purge" (''diakathairountes'')&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph 399e line 5.&lt;/ref&gt; in the same sense that Forms exist purged of matter.

The purged society is a regulated one presided over by philosophers educated by the state, who maintain three non-hereditary classes&lt;ref&gt;"Types" (''genē'') rather than the English economic classes or the favored populations of the real Greek cities.&lt;/ref&gt; as required: the tradesmen (including merchants and professionals), the guardians (militia and police) and the philosophers (legislators, administrators and the philosopher-king). Class is assigned at the end of education, when the state institutes individuals in their occupation. Socrates expects class to be hereditary but he allows for mobility according to natural ability. The criteria for selection by the academics is ability to perceive forms (the analog of English "intelligence") and martial spirit as well as predisposition or aptitude.

The views of Socrates on the proper order of society are certainly contrary to Athenian values of the time and must have produced a shock effect, intentional or not, accounting for the animosity against him. For example, reproduction is much too important to be left in the hands of untrained individuals: "... the possession of women and the procreation of children ... will ... follow the general principle that friends have all things in common, ...."&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph 424.&lt;/ref&gt; The family is therefore to be abolished and the children – whatever their parentage – to be raised by the appointed mentors of the state.

Their genetic fitness is to be monitored by the physicians: "... he ([[Asclepius]], a culture hero) did not want to lengthen out good-for-nothing lives, or have weak fathers begetting weaker sons – if a man was not able to live in the ordinary way he had no business to cure him ...."&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph 407.&lt;/ref&gt; Physicians minister to the healthy rather than cure the sick: "... (Physicians) will minister to better natures, giving health both of soul and of body; but those who are diseased in their bodies they will leave to die, and the corrupt and incurable souls they will put an end to themselves."&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph 410.&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing at all in Greek medicine so far as can be known supports the airy (in the Athenian view) propositions of Socrates. Yet it is hard to be sure of Socrates' real views considering that there are no works written by Socrates himself. There are two common ideas pertaining to the beliefs and character of Socrates: the first being the Mouthpiece Theory where writers use Socrates in dialogue as a mouthpiece to get their own views across. However, since most of what we know about Socrates comes from plays, most of the Platonic plays are accepted as the more accurate Socrates since Plato was a direct student of Socrates.

Perhaps the most important principle is that just as the Good must be supreme so must its image, the state, take precedence over individuals in everything. For example, guardians "... will have to be watched at every age in order that we may see whether they preserve their resolution and never, under the influence either of force or enchantment, forget or cast off their sense of duty to the state."&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph 412.&lt;/ref&gt; This concept of requiring guardians of guardians perhaps suffers from the Third Man weakness (see below): guardians require guardians require guardians, ad infinitum. The ultimate trusty guardian is missing. Socrates does not hesitate to face governmental issues many later governors have found formidable: "Then if anyone at all is to have the privilege of lying, the rulers of the state should be the persons, and they ... may be allowed to lie for the public good."&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph 389.&lt;/ref&gt;

Plato's conception of Forms actually differs from dialogue to dialogue, and in certain respects it is never fully explained, so many aspects of the theory are open to interpretation. Forms are first introduced in the Phaedo, but in that dialogue the concept is simply referred to as something the participants are already familiar with, and the theory itself is not developed. Similarly, in the Republic, Plato relies on the concept of Forms as the basis of many of his arguments but feels no need to argue for the validity of the theory itself or to explain precisely what Forms are. Commentators have been left with the task of explaining what Forms are and how visible objects participate in them, and there has been no shortage of disagreement. Some scholars advance the view that Forms are paradigms, perfect examples on which the imperfect world is modeled. Others interpret Forms as universals, so that the Form of Beauty, for example, is that quality that all beautiful things share. Yet others interpret Forms as "stuffs," the conglomeration of all instances of a quality in the visible world. Under this interpretation, we could say there is a little beauty in one person, a little beauty in another—all the beauty in the world put together is the Form of Beauty. Plato himself was aware of the ambiguities and inconsistencies in his Theory of Forms, as is evident from the incisive criticism he makes of his own theory in the Parmenides.

==Evidence of Forms==
Plato's main evidence for the existence of Forms is [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]] only and is as follows.

===Human perception===
We call both the sky and blue jeans by the same color, blue. However, clearly a pair of jeans and the sky are not the same color; moreover, the wavelengths of light reflected by the sky at every location and all the millions of blue jeans in every state of fading constantly change, and yet we somehow have a consensus of the basic form Blueness as it applies to them. Says Plato:&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'', paragraph 440.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]] in ''Metaphysics'' Α987a.29–b.14 and Μ1078b9–32 says that Plato devised the Forms to answer a weakness in the doctrine of [[Heraclitus]], who held that nothing exists, but everything is in a state of flow. If nothing exists then nothing can be known. It is possible that Plato took the Socratic search for definitions and extrapolated it into a distinct metaphysical theory. Little is known of the historical Socrates' own views, but the theory of Forms is likely a Platonic innovation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;But if the very nature of knowledge changes, at the time when the change occurs there will be no knowledge, and, according to this view, there will be no one to know and nothing to be known: but if that which knows and that which is known exist ever, and the beautiful and the good and every other thing also exist, then I do not think that they can resemble a process of flux, as we were just now supposing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Plato believed that long before our bodies ever existed, our souls existed and inhabited heaven, where they became directly acquainted with the forms themselves. Real knowledge, to him, was knowledge of the forms. But knowledge of the forms cannot be gained through sensory experience because the forms are not in the physical world. Therefore, our real knowledge of the forms must be the memory of our initial acquaintance with the forms in heaven. Therefore, what we seem to learn is in fact just remembering.&lt;ref&gt;Kidder, D. S. and Oppenheim, N. D, (2006), The Intellectual Devotional, p27, Borders Group, Inc, Ann Arbor. {{ISBN|978-1-60961-205-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perfection===
No one has ever seen a [[Perfection|perfect]] circle, nor a perfectly straight line, yet everyone knows what a circle and a straight line are. Plato utilizes the tool-maker's blueprint as evidence that Forms are real:&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'', paragraph 389.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;... when a man has discovered the instrument which is naturally adapted to each work, he must express this natural form, and not others which he fancies, in the material ....&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Perceived circles or lines are not exactly circular or straight, and true circles and lines could never be detected since by definition they are sets of infinitely small points. But if the perfect ones were not real, how could they direct the manufacturer?

==Criticisms of Platonic Forms==
===Self-criticism===
Plato was well aware of the limitations of the theory, as he offered  his own criticisms of it in his dialogue [[Parmenides (dialogue)|''Parmenides'']].  There Socrates is portrayed as a young philosopher acting as junior counterfoil to aged Parmenides. To a certain extent it is tongue-in-cheek as the older Socrates will have solutions to some of the problems  that are made to puzzle the younger.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

The dialogue does present a very real difficulty with the Theory of Forms, which Plato most likely only viewed as problems for later thought. These criticisms were later emphasized by [[Aristotle]] in rejecting an independently existing world of Forms. It is worth noting that Aristotle was a pupil and then a junior colleague of Plato; it is entirely possible that the presentation of ''Parmenides'' "sets up" for Aristotle; that is, they agreed to disagree.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

One difficulty lies in the conceptualization of the "participation" of an object in a form (or Form). The young Socrates conceives of his solution to the problem of the universals in another metaphor, which though wonderfully apt, remains to be elucidated:&lt;ref&gt;''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]]'' 131.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Nay, but the idea may be like the day which is one and the same in many places at once, and yet continuous with itself; in this way each idea may be one and the same in all at the same time.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But exactly how is a Form like the day in being everywhere at once? The solution calls for a distinct form, in which the particular instances, which are not identical to the form, participate; i.e., the form is shared out somehow like the day to many places. The concept of "participate", represented in Greek by more than one word, is as obscure in Greek as it is in English. Plato hypothesized that distinctness meant existence as an independent being, thus opening himself to the famous [[third man argument]] of Parmenides,&lt;ref&gt;The name is from [[Aristotle]], who says in ''Metaphysics'' A.IX.990b.15: "(The argument) they call the third man." A summary of the argument and the quote from Aristotle can be found in the venerable {{Cite journal | first=George | last=Grote | author-link=George Grote | contribution=App I Aristotle's Objections to Plato's Theory  | title=Aristotle: Second Edition with Additions | year=1880 | pages=559–60 note b | place=London | publisher=John Murray }} (downloadable Google Books). Grote points out that Aristotle lifted this argument from the ''Parmenides'' of Plato; certainly, his words indicate the argument was already well-known under that name.&lt;/ref&gt; which proves that forms cannot independently exist and be participated.&lt;ref&gt;Analysis of the argument has been going on for quite a number of centuries now and some analyses are complex, technical and perhaps tedious for the general reader. Those who are interested in the more technical analyses can find more of a presentation in {{cite journal | last=Hales | first=Steven D. |  title=The Recurring Problem of the Third Man | journal=Auslegung | volume=17 | issue=1 | pages=67–80 | year=1991 | url=http://www.bloomu.edu/departments/philosophy/pages/content/hales/articlepdf/thirdman.pdf }} and {{cite journal | last=Durham | first=Michael | title=Two Men and the Third Man | journal=The Dualist: Undergraduate Journal of Philosophy (Stanford University) | volume=4 | year=1997 | url=http://philosophy.stanford.edu/apps/stanfordphilosophy/files/wysiwyg_images/durham.pdf | format= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If universal and particulars – say man or greatness – all exist and are the same then the Form is not one but is multiple. If they are only like each other then they contain a form that is the same and others that are different. Thus if we presume that the Form and a particular are alike then there must be another, or third Form, man or greatness by possession of which they are alike. An [[infinite regress]]ion would then result; that is, an endless series of third men. The ultimate participant, greatness, rendering the entire series great, is missing. Moreover, any Form is not unitary but is composed of infinite parts, none of which is the proper Form.

The young Socrates (some may say the young Plato) did not give up the Theory of Forms over the Third Man but took another tack, that the particulars do not exist as such. Whatever they are, they "mime" the Forms, appearing to be particulars. This is a clear dip into [[Representative realism|representationalism]], that we cannot observe the objects as they are in themselves but only their representations. That view has the weakness that if only the mimes can be observed then the real Forms cannot be known at all and the observer can have no idea of what the representations are supposed to represent or that they are representations.

Socrates' later answer would be that men already know the Forms because they were in the world of Forms before birth. The mimes only recall these Forms to memory.&lt;ref&gt;Plato to a large extent identifies what today is called [[insight]] with recollection: "whenever on seeing one thing you conceived another whether like or unlike, there must surely have been an act of recollection?" — ''[[Phaedo]]'', paragraph 229. Thus geometric reasoning on the part of persons who know no geometry is not insight but is  recollection. He does recognize insight: "... with a sudden flash there shines forth understanding about every problem ..." (with regard to "the course of scrutiny") — ''[[The Seventh Letter]]'' 344b. Unfortunately the hidden world can in no way be verified in this world and its otherworldness can only be a matter of speculation. Plato was aware of the problem: "How real existence is to be studied or discovered is, I suspect, beyond you and me." — ''[[Cratylus]]'', paragraph 439.&lt;/ref&gt;  The comedian [[Aristophanes]] wrote a play, ''[[The Clouds]]'', poking fun of Socrates with his head in the clouds.

===Aristotelian criticism===
[[Image:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|180 px|The central image from Raphael's ''[[The School of Athens]]'' (1509-1511), depicting Plato (left) and Aristotle (right).  Plato is depicted pointing upwards, in reference to his belief in the higher Forms, while Aristotle disagrees and points downwards to the here-and-now, in reference to his belief in [[empiricism]].]]
The topic of Aristotle's criticism of Plato's Theory of Forms is a large one and continues to expand. Rather than quote Plato, Aristotle often summarized. Classical commentaries thus recommended Aristotle as an introduction to Plato. As a historian of prior thought, Aristotle was invaluable, however this was secondary to his own dialectic and in some cases he treats purported implications as if Plato had actually mentioned them, or even defended them. In examining Aristotle's criticism of The Forms, it is helpful to understand Aristotle's own [[hylomorphism|hylomorphic forms]], by which he intends to salvage much of Plato's theory.

In the summary passage quoted above&lt;ref name=summ&gt;Paragraph 50 a–c, Jowett translation.&lt;/ref&gt; Plato distinguishes between real and non-real "existing things", where the latter term is used of substance. The figures that the artificer places in the gold are not substance, but gold is. Aristotle stated that, for Plato, all things studied by the sciences have Form and asserted that Plato considered only substance to have Form. Uncharitably, this leads him to something like a contradiction: Forms existing as the objects of science, but not-existing as non-substance. Scottish philosopher [[W.D. Ross]] objects to this as a mischaracterization of Plato.&lt;ref name=rossXI&gt;Ross, Chapter XI, initial.&lt;/ref&gt;

Plato did not claim to know where the line between Form and non-Form is to be drawn. As Cornford points out,&lt;ref&gt;Pages 82–83.&lt;/ref&gt; those things about which the young Socrates (and Plato) asserted "I have often been puzzled about these things"&lt;ref&gt;''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]]'', paragraph 130c.&lt;/ref&gt; (in reference to Man, Fire and Water), appear as Forms in later works. However, others do not, such as Hair, Mud, Dirt. Of these, Socrates is made to assert, "it would be too absurd to suppose that they have a Form."

Ross&lt;ref name=rossXI/&gt; also objects to Aristotle's criticism that Form Otherness accounts for the differences between Forms and purportedly leads to contradictory forms: the Not-tall, the Not-beautiful, etc. That particulars participate in a Form is for Aristotle much too vague to permit analysis. By one way in which he unpacks the concept, the Forms would cease to be of one essence due to any multiple participation. As Ross indicates, Plato didn't make that leap from "A is not B" to "A is Not-B." Otherness would only apply to its own particulars and not to those of other Forms. For example, there is no Form Not-Greek, only ''particulars'' of Form Otherness that somehow ''suppress'' Form Greek.

Regardless of whether Socrates meant the particulars of Otherness yield Not-Greek, Not-tall, Not-beautiful, etc., the particulars would operate specifically rather than generally, each somehow yielding only one exclusion.

Plato had postulated that we know Forms through a remembrance of the soul's [[metempsychosis|past lives]] and Aristotle's arguments against this treatment of [[epistemology]] are compelling. For Plato, particulars somehow do not exist, and, on the face of it, "that which is non-existent cannot be known".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Posterior Analytics]]'' 71b.25.&lt;/ref&gt; See ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' III 3–4.&lt;ref&gt;Book III Chapters 3–4, paragraphs 999a ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Motorofficer.jpg|thumb|A motor officer writes a traffic ticket for a motorist accused of [[speeding]].]]

A '''traffic ticket''' is a notice issued by a [[law enforcement]] official to a [[motorist]] or other road user, indicating that the user has violated [[Traffic|traffic laws]]. Traffic tickets generally come in two forms, citing a [[moving violation]], such as exceeding the [[speed limit]], or a non-moving violation, such as a [[parking violation]], with the ticket also being referred to as a '''parking citation''', '''notice of illegal parking''' or '''parking ticket'''.

In some jurisdictions, a traffic ticket constitutes a notice that a penalty, such as a [[fine (penalty)|fine]] or deduction of [[point system (driving)|points]], has been or will be assessed against the driver or owner of a vehicle; failure to pay generally leads to [[prosecution]] or to civil recovery proceedings for the fine. In others, the ticket constitutes only a citation and [[summons]] to appear at [[traffic court]], with a determination of guilt to be made only in court.

==Australia==
In [[Australia]], traffic laws are made at the state level, usually in their own consolidated Acts of Parliament which have been based upon the [[Australian Road Rules]].

===New South Wales===
Traffic tickets are known as Traffic infringement notices (TIN's) in NSW. The [[Roads and Maritime Services]] (formerly [[Roads and Traffic Authority]]) of NSW maintains a database of all registered holders of a driver's licence in NSW, including the driver's traffic history and registered motor vehicles.
* Owner issued infringements
The [[Roads and Maritime Services]] maintain a number of fixed, and mobile, [[speed cameras]] and [[red light camera]]s across the State. The State Debt Recovery Office (SDRO) manages the processing and issuing of traffic tickets detected and issued by these devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fixed speed cameras|url=http://www.rms.nsw.gov.au/business-industry/heavy-vehicles/safety-compliance/speeding-camera-enforcement/fixed-cameras.html|website=Roads and Maritime Services|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tickets are deemed to be 'owner onus' tickets with the vehicles registered owner deemed liable unless they nominate another driver via statutory declaration.
* Driver issued infringements
These are generally issued 'on the spot' by a police officer although there are other authorised officers that can issue traffic infringemnts such as [[Roads and Maritime Services]] heavy vehicle inspectors and Traffic Commanders. The infringement notice is written on three carbonised pieces of printed paper, known as Part A, B and C. Part A is the original and is sent to the State Debt Recovery Office (SDRO) by the issuing officer when they return to the station, Part B stays in the infringement book for accountability and Part C is given to the accused person at the scene or via post. Infringement notices issued by Council's or Commercial Clients by way of electronic handheld devices still have as associated application for details provided on a copy of the Part A, to be made available for perusal if required.

In NSW all Traffic infringement notices (TIN's) and Parking Infringement Notices (PIN's) are part of the Self-Enforcing Infringement Notice Scheme (SEINS). This scheme aims to minimize Court time for people who wish to plead guilty. The accused person can either elect to pay/part pay the infringement by way of a number of online means or through [[Australia Post]], this can be found on the ticket. If the Accused person pays the infringement, they are deemed to have plead guilty and any demerit points will be deducted from their driver's licence. Matters only go to Court if the accused person elects to have the matter heard at Court.

If the accused person wishes to plead not guilty, they fill the reverse side of Part C out and mail it to the State Debt Recovery Office (SDRO). Once this is done, a Court date is set for hearing before a Magistrate and the officer is notified. The officer creates a brief of evidence and provides this to the Court and the accused person, this contains a copy of Part A, which includes the facts of the matter i.e. observations and contemporaneous notes, including description of vehicle, and whether or not any photographs of an offending vehicle have been taken. Quite often, an officer will indicate that they have taken only (1) photograph of a vehicle then, when a matter is defended in court and the prosecution provide a brief of evidence with anything up to 4-5 extra photographs this can lead to some of the photographs being excluded as evidence because there is no indication to show on the Part A that they were taken at the time of the offence.

Upon being issued a traffic infringement, or parking infringement notice, (in person or to a vehicle) an accused person will generally receive a penalty reminder notice in the mail approximately 28 days later, if the fine remains unpaid.

Under the Fines Act of 1996 (NSW) Time for service of penalty reminder notices by post, is (7) days unless it is established that it was not served within (7) days. A due date for payment of Penalty Reminder notices under this Act is (21) days after it is served. Generally from the date of an offence approximately (28) days is given, after which time of the due date they will then have approximately an additional 21 days in which to take action, and finalise the matter. This includes (7) to allow for service, and (14) days for action to be taken.

If the fine is not actioned by the due date on the penalty reminder notice, an enforcement order will be issued and additional costs apply. If the enforcement order remains unpaid further enforcement action can follow, which may include suspension of the persons driver licence and/or vehicle registration, restrictions on conducting business with Roads and Maritime Services (RMS), garnisheeing of wages, property seizure order or a community service order and additional fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Enforcement Action|url=http://www.revenue.nsw.gov.au/fines/ea|website=Revenue NSW|publisher=New South Wales Government|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outline of traffic offences===
&lt;!--section currently has Ontario-centric POV--&gt;

In [[Canada]], most traffic laws are made at the provincial level. However, some serious violations are criminal offences, contrary to the federal [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]]. Both levels of government may deal with different aspects of the same misconduct. For example, [[Drunk driving (Canada)|drinking and driving]] may be a criminal offence of driving while impaired, or driving with a blood alcohol level greater than .08.  At the same time, most provinces have laws specifying administrative penalties for driving with a blood alcohol level which does not exceed the criminal blood alcohol level of .08, in particular for newly licensed drivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alberta's approach to impaired driving|url=http://www.transportation.alberta.ca/impaireddriving.htm|website=Alberta Transportation|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each province maintains a database of motorists, including their convicted traffic violations. Upon being ticketed, a motorist has a chance to plead guilty or not guilty with an explanation. The motorist or their representative must attend the court for the town or city in which the violation took place to do so.

If the motorist pleads not guilty, a trial date is set and both the motorist, or a lawyer/paralegal representing the motorist, and the ticketing officer, are required to attend. If the officer fails to attend, the court judge will often find in favour of the motorist and dismiss the charge, although sometimes the trial date is moved to give the officer another chance to attend. In some provinces, officers are now paid time and a half to attend traffic proceedings. The court will also make provisions for the officer or the prosecutor to achieve a deal with the motorist, often in the form of a [[plea bargain]].  If no agreement is reached, both motorist and officer, or their respective representatives, formally attempt to prove their case before the judge or Justice of Peace, who then decides the matter.

If the motorist pleads guilty, the outcome is equivalent to conviction after trial. Upon conviction, the motorist is generally fined a monetary amount and, for moving violations, is additionally given demerit points, under each province's [[point system (driving)|point system]]. Jail time is sometimes sought in more serious cases such as racing or stunt driving.

=== The Demerit Point System in Ontario ===
{{anchor|Demerit Point System for Driving Offences in Ontario}}

In the province of Ontario, drivers who are convicted of certain driving related offences result in demerit points recorded onto their driving records. It is commonly misconceived that drivers actually "lose" points due to convictions for certain traffic offences. In fact, a driver begins with zero demerit points and accumulates demerit points for convictions. Demerit points stay on a driver's record for two years from the original offence date. If a driver accumulates enough points, a suspension/loss of licence can occur.

For a fully licensed driver in Ontario, the accumulation of six demerit points results in a “warning” letter.  At nine points, the driver is scheduled a mandatory interview to discuss their record and give specific reasonings as to why the licence should not be suspended.  If a driver fails to attend this meeting, their licence may be automatically suspended.  At 15 or more points, a driver’s licence will be suspended for 30 days.  Surrendering a licence to the Ministry of Transportation is mandatory at this stage; failure to surrender the licence may result in a suspension/loss for up to two years.

==India==
Traffic violations in India are listed out in the Motor Vehicle Act of 1988. The state government has the rights to decide on the officials who are to do traffic rule enforcement and how traffic citations are issued. Generally the Regional Transport Authority (RTA) and Traffic Police (which is part of the general law and order police force) are allowed to book traffic violations. Officers of and above the rank of Asst. Motor Vehicle Inspector (A.MVI) and [[Sub-Inspector]] in charge of the Traffic Police wing have the right to levy on-the-spot fines from the violators. This is known as ''compounding'' an offence. Fines would be paid on the spot and a ''[[Challan]]'' (receipt) would be given to the driver. Off late officers on Highway Police duty are also authorised to levy spot fines...

Other officers issue a ''Vehicle Check report'' which lists out the violations noticed on the driver or on the vehicle. The notice would contain the relevant sections in which the driver is charged and also a date to appear in court. The accused can plead guilty by sending a Postal Money order (MO) to the court indicating that he is pleading guilty. Otherwise he/she can appear in person in the court and contest the case. The police officers who prepared the check report and charge sheet would be in the court. The court which handles these cases are the Judicial First Class Magistrate Courts and the trial is a ''summary trial'' (which means if a person is found guilty, he/she cannot appeal to higher courts).

For drivers who drive under the influence of liquor or other narcotic substance, on-the-spot fine cannot be levied. The driver would be taken to a hospital and a medical report made out. The accused should appear in court. A driver can also insist that he/she would not be paying the fine at the spot and the case have to be heard in the magistrate's court. In such a case the Police officer should issue a notice for appearance in the court.

In the city of [[Kolkata]], certain traffic violations such as breaking a red light results in traffic police sending a ticket to the driver's home address. The ticket has to be paid to a state or central bank.

Indian Police forces do not have mobile credit card readers, so the fine is generally paid in cash.

==Ireland==
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], a traffic ticket (which is mailed out to the driver) is in the form of a notice alleging that some crime — traffic offences are all [[criminal offence]]s — has been committed, but stating that if a payment of a certain amount is made to the [[Garda Síochána]] within 28&amp;nbsp;days, or the amount increased by 50% is paid within 56&amp;nbsp;days, the driver will not be [[prosecution|prosecuted]] for the alleged offence. Some tickets carry [[point system (driving)|penalty points]] as well as the fine.

==Scandinavia==
Most of [[Scandinavia]] determines some traffic fines based on income. For example, Finland’s system for calculating fines starts with an estimate of the amount of spending money a Finn has for one day, and then divides that by two. The resulting number is considered a "reasonable" amount of spending money to deprive the offender of. Then, based on the severity of the crime, the system has rules for how many days the offender must go without that money. For example, driving about 15&amp;nbsp;mph over the speed limit results in a multiplier of 12 days. Most reckless drivers pay between $30 and $50 per day, for a total of about $400 or $500.  In 2002, a [[Nokia]] executive was fined the equivalent of $103,000 for driving at 75&amp;nbsp;km/h (47&amp;nbsp;mph) in a 50&amp;nbsp;km/h (31&amp;nbsp;mph) zone on his motorcycle.&lt;ref&gt;Pinsker, Joe (March 2015). [https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/03/finland-home-of-the-103000-speeding-ticket/387484/ Finland, Home of the $103,000 Speeding Ticket].

==United States==

[[File:Parking ticket - Washington DC - 2011-08-25.jpg|thumb|A parking ticket issued in Washington, D.C. in 2011.]]
[[File:Seattle parking checker, 1960.gif|thumb|right|Checker giving a parking ticket, Seattle Washington, 1960.]]

In the [[United States]], most traffic laws are codified in a variety of state, county and municipal laws or ordinances, with most minor violations classified as [[infraction]]s, [[Civil penalty|civil charges]] or [[criminal charges]]. The classification of the charge depends on the violation itself as well as the jurisdiction, with infractions, civil charges and criminal charges relating to different standards of proof, trial rules and punishments.

===Traffic violations===
What constitutes a "minor violation" or infraction varies, examples include non-moving violations, defective or improper vehicle equipment, seat belt and child-restraint safety violations, and insufficient proof of license, insurance or registration. A trend in the late 1970s and early 1980s also saw an increased tendency for jurisdictions to re-classify certain speeding violations as civil infractions.&lt;ref name="Ruschmann000"&gt;{{cite book| title     = An Analysis of the Potential Legal Constraints on the Use of Speed Measuring Devices.|first= P.A.| last = Ruschmann| publisher = University of Michigan, Highway Safety Research Institute| year= 1979| id = Original from the University of Michigan Digitized November 23, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, for more "serious" violations, traffic violators may be held criminally liable, accused of a [[misdemeanor]] or even a [[felony]]. Serious violations tend to involve multiple prior offenses, willful disregard of public safety, death or serious bodily injury, or damage to property.&lt;ref name="Ruschmann000" /&gt; A frequently used penalty is a [[fine (penalty)|fine]], and this is ordinarily a fixed amount of money, instead of being an amount of money determined based on the facts of each individual case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|ssrn=1967184|last=Bray |first=Samuel L.|year=2012 |title=Announcing Remedies |journal=Cornell Law Review |volume=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contesting a ticket===
If the motorist wishes to contest a traffic infraction, a hearing can be set by the court upon proper request.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite web|title=Traffic &amp; Ticket Basics|url=http://www.courts.ca.gov/8452.htm|website=California Courts|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hearings are before a magistrate or judge depending on the state or city. Hearing dates may potentially be adjourned, and witnesses or police officers may be subpoenaed to appear in court.

At any point after the issuance of a ticket, a motorists may retain an attorney to represent them in a traffic infraction.&lt;ref name="exfight"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Should You Fight Your Traffic Ticket?|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/traffic_tickets/fighting_tickets.html|website=ExpertLaw.com|publisher=ExpertLaw|accessdate=7 September 2017|date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Retaining or consulting an attorney may be beneficial to the motorist because an attorney would better understand how to contest an infraction in any given state or municipality. Attorneys may offer full representation in court, taking a case from inception to disposal and potentially appeals, although it may be possible for a defendant to retain a lawyer to discuss legal options, identify important defenses, and determine a defense strategy without hiring the lawyer to provide in-court representation.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite web|title=Limited-Scope Representation|url=http://www.courts.ca.gov/1085.htm|website=California Courts|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The motorist may be given the opportunity to schedule a hearing for a time at which the subpoenaed ticketing officer is unable to attend. If the officer or representative fails to attend the trial for a civil infraction, the trial court may adjourn the hearing to a date upon which the officer is able to appear or, particularly if good cause is not shown for the officer's absence, the court judge may dismiss the charge.&lt;ref name="exfight"/&gt;

Although each judge, state, county or municipality handle contested hearings a little differently, the court may make provisions for the prosecutor to achieve a deal with the motorist, often in the form of a [[plea bargain]] that may reduce the impact from that which would be incurred from pleading guilty without attending court.&lt;ref name="exfight"/&gt; If no agreement is reached, and the prosecutor feels it is worth his time to charge the motorist, both motorist and officer, or their respective representatives, formally attempt to prove their case before the judge, who then decides the matter.

In some states and for criminal traffic violations, the judge may also order a [[jury trial]], in which case a [[jury]] will hear arguments from both sides, and then consider the facts in the case and render a [[verdict]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What To Expect in Traffic Court|url=https://www.ohiobar.org/forpublic/resources/lawyoucanuse/pages/lawyoucanuse-245.aspx|website=Ohio State Bar Association|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motorist may, for example, put forward a reason their alleged violation was justified, such as to "get out of the way of an ambulance or avoid a collision with another motorist", and call into doubt the level to which the officer recalls the specific details of the situation among the many tickets they have issued.

In Washington state, there is a local option for courts to permit a decision on written statements, without the officer's live appearance in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courts.wa.gov/court_rules/?fa=court_rules.display&amp;group=clj&amp;set=IRLJ&amp;ruleid=cljirlj3.5|title=Washington State Courts  - Court Rules|author=|date=|website=www.courts.wa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; California offers a procedure in which both the officer and the ticketed driver may appear in writing, through a Trial by Written Declaration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trial by Written Declaration|url=http://www.courts.ca.gov/34713.htm|website=California Courts|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some states permit challenging a traffic infraction through a written statement instead of appearing in court.  For example, California's Vehicle Code Section 40902 permits individuals to obtain a trial by written declaration instead of making an in-court appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=California Vehicle Code, Sec. 40902, Evidence|url=https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=VEH&amp;sectionNum=40902.|website=California Legislative Information|publisher=State of California|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Driving records===
Each state's [[Department of Motor Vehicles]] or Bureau of Motor Vehicles maintains a database of motorists, including their convicted traffic violations.  Upon being ticketed, a motorist is given the option to mail into the local court or the court for the jurisdiction in which the violation is alleged—a plea of guilty, not guilty or [[nolo contendere]] within a certain time frame (usually ten to fifteen days, although courts generally provide leniency in this regard). Additionally, the motorist can request a mitigation hearing, which acknowledges that the driver is guilty of a moving violation, but is requesting a hearing with a judge to reduce the fines associated with the ticket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Infractions (Tickets)|url=http://www.cob.org/government/court/infractions.aspx#mitigating|publisher=[[Bellingham, Washington|Bellingham Municipal Court]]|accessdate=15 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116102429/http://www.cob.org/government/court/infractions.aspx#mitigating|archivedate=16 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the motorist pleads guilty, the outcome is equivalent to a conviction after the hearing.  Upon conviction, the motorist is generally fined a monetary amount and, for moving violations, is additionally assessed a penalty under each state's [[point system (driving)|point system]].  If a motorist is convicted of a violation in a state other than the state in which the motorist is registered, information about the ticket is relayed in accord with state policy and agreements between the two states, including the [[Non-Resident Violator Compact]].  If the ticket information is not abstracted to the state in which the motorist is licensed, then the record of the conviction remains local to the state where the violation took place.

===Ticket fixing===
The practice of [[ticket fixing]] by police officers is a recurring source of controversy in the United States. Police officers in many jurisdictions surreptitiously cancel tickets as a "professional courtesy" to the friends and family of other police officers. This practice is not legal in most jurisdictions, but enforcement is often lax, leading to periodic scandals.&lt;ref&gt;Ticket-fixing probe rocks Georgia. ''Henderdson Times-News''. September 17, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2004-07-27/bay-area/17436305_1_house-arrest-arrest-sentence-william-danser | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Kelly | last=St. John | title=San Jose / Disbarred judge told to swear off alcohol | date=2004-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/28/nyregion/16-officers-ordered-to-surrender-in-ticket-fixing.html | work=The New York Times | first1=William K. | last1=Rashbaum | first2=Al | last2=Baker | title=In Ticket-Fixing Scandal, 16 Officers to Be Charged | date=2011-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ticket superlatives==
There are many competing claims as to '''the first''' speeding ticket ever issued depending whether the claim goes by the first traffic violation or the first ''paper ticket'' ever issued. [[Great Britain]] may have the earliest claim with the first person to be convicted of speeding, Walter Arnold of [[East Peckham]], Kent, who on 28 January 1896 was fined for speeding at {{convert|8|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in a {{convert|2|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} zone. He was fined 1 shilling plus costs.&lt;ref name="NatMotMuseum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalmotormuseum.org.uk/motoring_firsts|publisher=National Motoring Museum|title=Motoring firsts}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC R4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00cmb4q|work=BBC Radio 4|title=The Eureka Years|author=Adam Hart Davis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4rRyTOnpfpUC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;dq=worlds+first+speeding+ticket&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=SKAnTMiAK8P_lgfj7MjjDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=speeding&amp;f=false|author=John Townsend|title=Crime Scenes|pages=45|publisher=Heinemann-Raintree|date=September 2005|isbn=978-1-4109-1171-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A New York City cab driver named Jacob German was arrested for speeding on May 20, 1899 for driving 12 miles per hour on Lexington Avenue in Manhattan. In [[Dayton, Ohio]], police issued a ''paper ticket'' to Harry Myers for going twelve miles per hour on West Third Street in 1904.&lt;ref name="Ohio History"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=2599 |title=Ohio History Central |accessdate=2008-08-27|work=Ohio History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another '''early''' speeding ticket was issued in 1910 to Lady Laurier, the wife of [[Wilfrid Laurier]], Prime Minister of Canada, in [[Ottawa, Ontario]], Canada, for exceeding the 10 miles per hour speed limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data2.collectionscanada.gc.ca/ap/c/c140936.jpg|title=data2.collectionscanada.gc.ca|author=|date=|website=collectionscanada.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fastest convicted speeder in the UK was Daniel Nicks, convicted of {{convert|175|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} on a [[Honda Fireblade]] motorcycle in 2000.  He received six weeks in jail and was banned from driving for two full years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/topstories/tm_headline=biker-beats-cops-at-170mph&amp;method=full&amp;objectid=19075670&amp;siteid=89520-name_page.html |title=Biker beats cops at 170mph  |publisher=mirror.co.uk }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fastest UK speeder in a car was Timothy Brady, caught driving a 3.6-litre [[Porsche 911 Turbo]] at {{convert|172|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} on the A420 in Oxfordshire in January 2007 and jailed for 10&amp;nbsp;weeks and banned from driving for 3&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/oxfordshire/7009923.stm | work=BBC News | title=Jail for 172mph Porsche motorist | date=2007-09-24 | accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''most expensive''' speeding ticket ever given is believed to be the one given to Jussi Salonoja in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]], in 2003. Salonoja, the 27-year-old heir to a company in the meat-industry, was fined 170,000 euros for driving 80&amp;nbsp;km/h in a 40&amp;nbsp;km/h zone. The uncommonly large fine was due to Finnish speeding tickets (when excess speed is considerable) being relative to the offender's last known income. Salonoja's speeding ticket was not the first ticket given in Finland reaching six figures.&lt;ref name=bbcrecordpeedingticket&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3477285.stm BBC world], Finn's speed fine is a bit rich.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Women's liberation movement}}
The '''[[women's liberation movement]] in Asia''' was a [[Radical feminism|feminist]] movement that started in the late 1960s and through the 1970s. Women's liberation movements in [[Asia]] sought to  redefine women's relationships to the family and the way that women expressed their [[Human sexuality|sexuality]]. Women's liberation in Asia also dealt with particular challenges that made the liberation movement unique in different countries.

Several countries were influenced by [[Western world|Western]] women's liberation movements, and in the case of [[China]], ideas from the [[Cultural Revolution]] actually helped shape women's liberation in the West. Many Asian feminists had to straddle the line between being feminist or being "Asian." In [[India]], the [[Caste|caste system]] affected the way that women's liberation was approached in that gender and class could rarely be separated. Similarly in [[Israel]], the plight of [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] women became important in molding the views of oppression. In [[Japan]], the movement focused on sexuality rather than equality, in an attempt to gain recognition for women's autonomy and freedom to choose their own social roles. In [[Singapore]], [[South Korea]] and [[Taiwan]], the liberationist movement was inspired by the world-wide movement for women's liberation and typically combined the fight against sexism with the struggle against colonialism and economic exploitation. [[Turkey]] came to the women's liberation movement later than other countries and was influenced by feminists from other countries and also by [[Islam]]ic women. Turkey's struggle for women's liberation was centered around the issue of [[domestic violence]].

== China ==
Women's status in [[China]] during the twentieth century were tied closely to the [[Communist revolution|Communist Revolution]] there and women's social status rose quickly.{{sfn|Jones|1996|p=152}} Initially, Chinese people believed that the Communist Revolution would end [[patriarchy]].{{sfn|Li|2000|p=39}} During the [[Cultural Revolution]], women were celebrated through slogans like "Women Hold Up Half the Sky", while simultaneously they were discouraged from discussing gender issues, which was seen as "[[reactionary]]".{{sfn|Jones|1996|p=152}} In the 1970s, new institutions that benefited and were staffed by women were created, including cafeterias, [[kindergarten]]s, and nurseries.{{sfn|Li|2000|p=32}} Women's rights were managed by the state itself{{sfn|Hathaway|2018}} and there was no independent [[Feminism in China|feminist movement]] during the period.{{sfn|Zhou|2003|pp=71–74}} However, many of the ideas created during the revolution went on to influence women's movements in the [[Western world|West]], as radical feminists often were politically aligned on the left. In the polarized camps of the [[Cold War]] period, socialists turned from emulating [[USSR|Soviet]] communism in the wake of [[Stalinist purges]] and invasions. [[Feminist movement|Western feminists]] after 1960 based key ideals on [[Maoism|Maoist]] theory. Slogans such as "workers of the world unite" turned into "women of the world unite" and key features like [[consciousness-raising]] and [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian consensus-based policies]] "were inspired by similar techniques used in China".{{sfn|Hathaway|2018}}

== India ==
Politics in India became radicalized in the late 1960s with numerous special interests groups forming to address corruption and the economic crisis brought about by destructive development. By the 1970s, [[Famine in India#1972 Maharashtra drought|drought in the Maharashtra state]] worsened conditions for many. Peaking in 1974 with encouragement from the [[Navnirman Movement]], women in diverse classes began to engage in direct actions to challenge leadership.{{sfn|Patel|1985|pp=2–3}} The idea of "women's liberation" became a "respectable topic" in [[India]] starting in the 1970s.{{sfn|Omvedt|1975|p=40}} Women began to see that legal protections were doing very little to change the reality of their lives.{{sfn|Jones|1996|p=151}} [[Rural area|Rural]] women who lived in [[poverty]] began to see themselves as doubly disadvantaged: both economically and through their lower social status.{{sfn|Omvedt|1975|p=44}} Women in lower [[Caste system in India|castes]], such as [[Dalit]]s, realized that they had to fight a class battle, as well as a battle against sexism.{{sfn|Omvedt|1975|p=44}} However, most women participating in the women's liberation movement in the 1970s were [[middle class]] or part of the [[Forward caste|upper caste]], and were [[Urban area|urban]] and educated.{{sfn|Sowjanya|2011|p=52}}

The Women's Federation of [[Kerala]] had grown to 100,000 members by 1970 and the [[Ganatantrik Mahila Samiti]] (Democratic Women's Organization) held a state conference in April 1973 in [[West Bengal]] that drew 121,632 members from nearly every district.{{sfn|Omvedt|1975|p=41}} In 1974, organizations such as the Women's Anti-Price-Rise movement in [[Maharashtra]], the [[Progressive Organization of Women]] (POW) of [[Hyderabad]], and the [[Stree Mukti Sanghatana]] of [[Mumbai|Bombay]] formed, with women joining these leftist organizations in greater numbers.{{sfn|Patel|1985|p=3}}{{sfn|Omvedt|1975|p=41}} The first Democratic Women's Union conference was held in [[Tamil Nadu]] in December 1974.{{sfn|Omvedt|1975|p=40-41}} Student unrest and protest in [[Delhi]] sparked women to create their own human rights movement.{{sfn|Patel|1985|p=3}}

Creating small groups in such places as [[Banglore]], Bombay, Delhi, Hyderabad, [[Madras]], and [[Pune]], the women's groups that formed in the period were averse to authoritarian structure and utilized a collective approach to decision-making. To challenge patriarchal power in personal and political spheres, they published and reproduced articles from other countries on Women's Liberation developments throughout the world. These loosely affiliated groups networked by circulating their publications in English, as well as regional languages. In Maharashtra, differing from other areas, meetings crossed caste and class divides, including students, laborers, blue collar workers, and white collar employees.{{sfn|Patel|1985|p=7}} Focusing on direct action, women in these groups protested official policy in various ways. For example, an influential street performance ''Om Swaha'' enacted by ''Stree Mukti Sanghatana'' members became iconic, galvanizing women to work against [[dowry deaths]].{{sfn|Menon|2011|p=xix}}

Publication of the report ''Towards Equality'' in 1974 and 1975 as part of the [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women|United Nations survey on the Status of Women]], revealed that women's participation in economic and political life had declined in post-Independent India.{{sfn|Menon|2011|pp=xx, 110–111}} Unlike the western counterparts of the WLM, [[sexuality]] was a [[taboo]] topic in the era, though [[sexual violence]] became a focus. As such, [[lesbian]]s were part of the movement, but sexual orientation was largely a private matter.{{sfn|Menon|2011|p=24}} In like manner, liberationists were characterized as disruptive to class-based activists who firmly believed that elimination of class differences would solve women's problems.{{sfn|Menon|2011|pp=93–94}} In 1981, a group ''[[Sachetana]]'' was formed by activists in Calcutta{{sfn|Ray|2002|p=95}} with the goal of raising the consciousness of its members and other women.{{sfn|Ray|2002|p=77}} Their initial public protest was production of a play, ''Meye Dile Shajiye'', written by member [[Malini Bhattacharya]] to protest selling brides.{{sfn|Ray|2002|p=95}} Unaffiliated with any political party, the group became a safe space for women of varying beliefs and political ties to openly express and discuss issues criticizing government policy and patriarchy.{{sfn|Ray|2002|pp=61, 101}}

After [[The Emergency (India)|The Emergency]] ended in 1977 in India, membership in the women's movement swelled, which predominantly consisted up to that time of the organized, disciplined, hierarchically-structured, party-affiliated groups or the leaderless, inclusive and chaotic, but autonomous groups loosely affiliated with the political left.{{sfn|Menon|2011|pp=176–177}} The [[Forum against Oppression of Women|1980 Forum Against Rape]], held in Bombay at Cama Hall, marked a point where activists realized that multi-dimensional struggle focusing on both legal reform and raising awareness was necessary to combat systemic issues{{sfn|Menon|2011|p=179}} and different factions of [[Feminism in India|feminists]] began to come together to solve issues.{{sfn|Menon|2011|p=201}}

==Israel==
The women's liberation movement in Israel was initiated in the early 1970s by two American immigrants at the [[University of Haifa]], [[Marcia Freedman]]{{sfn|Becker|2015}} and [[Marylin Safir]] who had both been involved in feminist activities in the United States. Seminars they held in [[Haifa]] on how women suffered from a male-dominated society quickly inspired radical activities in [[Tel-Aviv]] and [[Jerusalem]].{{sfn|Ram|2012|p=150}} The first liberationist group formed in 1972,{{sfn|Herzog|2009}} spawning formation of consciousnesses-raising groups which used direct actions as a means of addressing women's issues.{{sfn|Ram|2012|p=150}} [[Women's studies]] emerged which highlighted the historical contributions of Israeli women.{{sfn|Marteu|2012}} Freedman commented: "It really wasn't that difficult translating American feminism to Israel, with many of the same issues: the ability of women to work outside the house, abortion and issues of women controlling their bodies, although on Israel a very common response was that no women's movement was needed because Israeli women were already 'liberated'."{{sfn|Becker|2015}}{{sfn|Ram|2012|p=150}}

In 1972, the radical ''Nilahem'' movement (based on an acronym meaning Women for a Renewed Society) was formed, attracting interest throughout the country with stands against legal inequality and the suffering of the Palestinians.{{sfn|Becker|2015}} During the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]], women found themselves excluded from the civilian administration, and both the military and war production efforts, being relegated to treating the wounded and supporting families. Though short in duration, the conflict brought into focus an awareness of the segregated roles of women and men in society.{{sfn|Herzog|2009}} That same year, Freedman became the first openly feminist member of the [[Knesset]], supporting the Civil Rights Movement.{{sfn|Ram|2012|p=151}} Jerusalem liberationists saw in the movement a way to fight against all oppression, including that of the poor and Palestinians. They led actions over poor wages, women working at night, and violence against women, as well as the right to control decisions over reproduction, as did activists in Haifa and Tel Aviv.{{sfn|Frankfort-Nachmias|Shadmi|2005|p=43}}

Women's centers sprang up in metropolitan areas and by 1975, translated anthologies of US and European texts were appearing regularly in Israel.{{sfn|Ram|2012|p=151}} Various feminist publications appeared in the mid-1970s including ''Women as Human Beings'' by [[Shulamit Aloni]]. The feminist periodical ''Nogah'' began publication in 1980.{{sfn|Becker|2015}} In 1976, WLM members, led by Freeman, made headlines when they invaded a gynecological conference at the [[Hilton Tel Aviv]] to protest the position on abortion and were evicted by police.{{sfn|Frankfort-Nachmias|Shadmi|2005|p=43}} In 1977, the first women's shelter in Israel was founded in Haifa and the first rape crisis center was opened in Tel Aviv. That same year, a feminist publishing group ''The Second Sex'' was created and the lesbian liberationist group ''Aleph'' was founded,{{sfn|Ram|2012|p=151}} which led to the hosting of the first lesbian feminist conference the following year in [[Beersheba]].{{sfn|Frankfort-Nachmias|Shadmi|2005|p=44}} By the end of the 1970s, the movement was fracturing in Israel and Aleph disbanded in 1980.{{sfn|Frankfort-Nachmias|Shadmi|2005|pp=43–44}}

== Japan ==
In [[Japan]], the woman's liberation movement was known as ''ũman ribu'', marking a new social and political direction for women in Japan.{{sfn|Shigematsu|2012|pp=ix, 3}} The name ''ũman ribu'' was itself a transliteration of English for "women's lib" and was meant to show "both the activists' solidarity with other women's liberation movements around the world and their specificity as a new Japanese women's movement".{{sfn|Shigematsu|2015|p=175}} ''Ūman ribu'' differed from Western women's liberation movements in that the goals were not about [[Women's rights|equal rights]], but more focused on women's roles in Japan and "called for liberation from their sex," which is known as ''sei no kaihō''.{{sfn|Shigematsu|2015|p=174}}{{sfn|Ito|2015}}

Women in the movement felt that dealing with [[sexual desire]] (''seiyoku'') was important and defining for the movement itself.{{sfn|Shigematsu|2012|p=11}} Women such as Iwatsuki Sumie (also known as Asatori Sumie), wrote about [[Menstrual taboo|menstruation taboos]].{{sfn|Shigematsu|2012|p=57}} She was also instrumental in creating women's spaces and was known for her advocacy of [[lesbian]] relationships.{{sfn|Shigematsu|2015|p=178}} Activist, [[Yonezu Tomoko]], started ''Thought Group SEX'', which also explored [[disability]] and sexual liberation.{{sfn|Shigematsu|2012|p=66}} Sexual liberation for Tomoko and Tanaka didn't mean "free sex" (''furii sekkusu''), but instead focused on a liberation of women's sexuality.{{sfn|Shigematsu|2015|p=176}} In addition, the sense of autonomy over their own bodies meant that ''ũman ribu'' activist opposed efforts to restrict [[abortion]] and which emphasized creating a society where women "want to give birth".{{sfn|Shigematsu|2015|p=180}}

Women in Japan were considered "second-class citizens in society in general, within social movements [...], and in the family".{{sfn|Yamaguchi|2006|p=3}} Women involved in the movement were critical both of the literal modern family system and also of political movement that attempted to frame women's roles in politics in familial terminology.{{sfn|Shigematsu|2012|p=3}} Within the movement, Japanese women also attempted to rehabilitate the word, ''onna,'' for woman, which had become a derogatory way to refer to women, but one that did not have familial connotations.{{sfn|Shigematsu|2012|p=4}} Women involved in this women's liberation movement felt that they were different from people who were [[Feminism in Japan|''feminisuto'']] (feminist) which they felt only applied to academics involved in [[women's studies]].{{sfn|Lunsing|2016|p=260}} Many of the women involved in the ''ũman ribu'' movement were young and had been involved in [[New Left in Japan|New Left]] groups in the 1960s.{{sfn|Molony|2018}}

Groups began to appear in cities throughout Japan in April 1970.{{sfn|Shigematsu|2015|p=175}} These groups were not hierarchical and had no central leadership.{{sfn|Shigematsu|2015|p=175}} Starting in late 1970, an organization called ''Gurũpu tatakau onna'' (Group of Fighting Women) began to work towards women's liberation throughout Japan.{{sfn|Lenz|2014|p=217}}  Women met to discuss [[Mitsu Tanaka|Tanaka Mitsu's]] work, ''Liberation from the Toilet'' and also to advocate for a change in laws.{{sfn|Lenz|2014|p=217}} Tanaka chose to use the word "toilet" because women could be described as "little more than repositories of men's bodily fluids," or metaphorically speaking, as a convenience to men.{{sfn|Ito|2015}} Another ''ũman ribu'' publication was ''Onna erosu'', which started in the 1970s and had a diverse perspective on social movements.{{sfn|Muta|2000|pp=132–133}} The ''ũman ribu'' anthology for women in Japan came out in 1972 and was called ''Onna's Thought''.{{sfn|Shigematsu|2012|p=60}} The first public rally for ''ũman ribu'' took place on [[International Anti-War Day]], October 21, 1970.{{sfn|Shigematsu|2015|p=175}} In 1973, [[Tokyo]] activists created a public demonstration against [[Mother's Day]].{{sfn|Shigematsu|2015|p=178-179}} The activists had a banner that read "Mother's Day, what a laugh!" and critiqued the value of mothers, wives and children in Japanese society.{{sfn|Shigematsu|2015|p=179}}

Communes were started by ''ũman ribu'' activists in the early 1970s throughout Japan, including the best-known commune of [[Ribu Shinjuku Centre]] in Tokyo.{{sfn|Shigematsu|2015|p=179}} Various groups, including the ''Gurũpu tatakau onna,'' Thought Group SEX, Tokyo Komu-unu, Alliance of Fighting Women and Scarlet Letter helped establish the Ribu Shinjuku Centre.{{sfn|Shigematsu|2015|p=179}} The Centre was not only a central location for organizing and communicating, but also served as [[women's shelter]].{{sfn|Shigematsu|2015|p=179}} The women's liberation movement in Japan continued past the 1970s, but not with using the same terminology and methods.{{sfn|Lunsing|2016|p=292}}

== Singapore ==
[[Nalla Tan]] called for a council of women to be formed to advocate for women's rights in Singapore in 1972.{{sfn|Women's Action|n.d.}} The women's liberation movement in Singapore was energized in 1975, during the observance of the [[International Women's Year]].{{sfn|Lyons|2014}} That same year the [[Singapore Council of Women's Organisations|National Council of Women]] (NCW) was formed in order to coordinate the activities of women's groups in the country and to help end discrimination against women.{{sfn|Lyons|2014}} In 1983, the "[[Population planning in Singapore|Great Marriage Debate]]" began a conversation about [[eugenics]], motherhood and the need for [[feminism]] in Singapore.{{sfn|Lyons|2014}} Young people were encouraged to marry and have children by the government which was worried about the falling [[Total fertility rate|fertility rate]] in the country.{{sfn|Women's Action|n.d.}} The [[National University of Singapore]] Society held a forum in November 1984 that responded to the issues raised in the "Great Marriage Debate."{{sfn|Women's Action|n.d.}} [[Zaibun Siraj]] and [[Vivienne Wee]] organized the forum called "Women's Choices, Women's Lives" and brought speakers such as [[Kanwaljit Soin]], [[Hedwig Anuar]] and [[Margaret Thomas (editor)|Margaret Thomas]].{{sfn|Women's Action|n.d.}}

The first feminist organization in Singapore, the [[Association of Women for Action and Research]] (AWARE) was created in 1985 in response to the issues raised at the "Women's Choices, Women's Lives" forum.{{sfn|Women's Action|n.d.}}{{sfn|Lyons|2014}}{{sfn|Lyons|2000|p=3}} Members of AWARE were concerned about not being associated with negative [[stereotype]]s of feminism and balanced their feminism with "Asian values."{{sfn|Lyons|2000|p=7-8}} AWARE publicly focused on issues they called "women's rights" and "[[gender inequality]]".{{sfn|Lyons|2000|p=11}} They did not explicitly or publicly blame women's roles in society on men, but rather as "product of history and tradition," and that gender inequality affected both men and women in society.{{sfn|Lyons|2000|p=12}} Privately and in unpublished reports, members thought of themselves as feminists.{{sfn|Lyons|2000|p=13}}

== South Korea ==
The first women's organizations in South Korea arose from worker's struggles under the dictatorship of [[Park Chung-hee]] and were focused on poor working conditions and exploitation of women in the family under a system which required women to work to pay for their brothers' educations and support their families.{{sfn|Ching|Louie|2000|p=122}} In 1975, [[Yi Hyo-jae]] ({{lang-ko|李効再}}), a professor at [[Ewha Womans University]] (EWU) began to criticize existing women's organizations in Korea as being too focused on legal change for women rather than liberation of women from societal ideas of what women should be. As western literature, like ''[[The Second Sex]]'' by [[Simone de Beauvoir]] and then ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'' by [[Betty Friedan]] and ''[[Sexual Politics]]'' by [[Kate Millett]] were translated into Korean in 1973, followed by ''[[Woman's Estate]]'' by [[Juliet Mitchell]], Korean intellectuals had become aware of the ideas of [[radical feminists]].{{sfn|Kim|2000|pp=220–221}} By 1977, a [[women's studies]] department was established at EWU.{{sfn|Jung|2014|p=23}} The development of the course utilized students' input and also requested material relating to the courses from 150 universities in the United States with women's studies classes.{{sfn|Jung|2014|p=23}} The women's studies department was criticized for relying too heavily on Western ideas, but there was a "strong interest" from students in the classes.{{sfn|Jung|2014|p=24}} The [[Feminism in South Korea|feminist movement]], known as Minjung feminism, which developed in South Korea in the 1980s merged worker concerns with liberationist ideas within the broader fight against dictatorship.{{sfn|Ching|Louie|2000|pp=123–125}}

== Taiwan ==
One of [[Taiwan|Taiwan's]] feminists, [[Annette Lu|Hsiu-lien Annette Lu]], was inspired by the [[Women's liberation movement in North America|women's liberation movement]] in the [[United States]].{{sfn|Chang|2009a|p=93}} In 1974, Lu published ''New Feminism'' which advocated for women to come together to end "the dominant patriarchal paradigm".{{sfn|Lu|2009|p=48}} Yang Mei-hui translated [[Margaret Mead|Margaret Mead's]] ''Sex and Temperament in Three Primitive Societies'' (1935), which introduced the concept of [[gender role]] formation to Chinese-speaking women in Taiwan.{{sfn|Chang|2009|p=51}} This translation was also an influence on Lu,{{sfn|Chang|2009|p=52}} whose followers established the [[Awakening Foundation]] and began publishing the ''Awakening Magazine'' in 1982.{{sfn|Chiang|Liu|2011|p=559}} Lu also wove [[Confucianism|Confucian philosophy]] into her feminist discourse to promote a cultural basis for addressing double-standards for men and women. By utilizing maxims such as "Do not impose on others what you yourself do not desire", she developed the theme of mutual respect for women.{{sfn|Chang|2009a|p=94}}

== Turkey ==
Student movements focusing on [[anti-imperialism]] began to appear in [[Turkey]] in the 1960s and leftist movements began to form in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://struggle.ws/turkey/may5/feminism_may00.html|title=Feminism in Turkey|last=Ege|first=Mine|date=May 2000|website=Struggle|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807152711/http://struggle.ws/turkey/may5/feminism_may00.html|archive-date=7 August 2016|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, women's concerns were not dealt with by many of these groups and women were actively discouraged from discussing them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The [[women's liberation movement]] really began to flourish in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://middleeastreviewsonline.com/membr_review/women-and-civil-society-in-turkey-womens-movements-in-a-muslim-society/|title=Women and Civil Society in Turkey: Women's Movements in a Muslim Society - Review|last=Gokcek|first=Mustafa|date=2017|work=Middle East Media and Book Reviews|access-date=2018-05-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women who had been involved in these leftist groups started to talk about feminism and created consciousness-raising groups where they shared their own experiences as women with one another.{{sfn|Ergun|2017|p=43}} Many of the early feminists in Turkey were educated, often professional, middle class and who had links to feminists in other countries.{{sfn|Arat|1998|p=119}} Because of women's very marginalized position in Turkey, the movement went unnoticed until "a substantial, organized feminist movement grew out of these small groups."{{sfn|Ergun|2017|p=43}} One of the significant groups was called ''Kadin Çevresi'' (Women's Circle).{{sfn|Ergun|2017|p=43}} ''Kadin Çevresi'' translated and published books by significant feminist writers.{{sfn|Ergun|2017|p=44}} Translations were also published on the feminist page of ''Somut'', a weekly magazine, which began in 1983.{{sfn|Ergun|2017|p=44}}&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4Uyypm6T7ZsC&amp;lpg=PA790&amp;dq=somut%20periodical&amp;pg=PA790#v=onepage&amp;q=somut%20periodical&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of Women and Islamic Cultures: Family, Law and Politics|last=Çaha|first=Ōmer|publisher=Brill|year=2005|isbn=978-9004128187|editor-last=Joseph|editor-first=Suad|location=Leiden|pages=790–791|language=en|chapter=Turkey}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the books become translated, women would form book clubs and hold book discussions.{{sfn|Ergun|2017|p=44}} In addition to translating, women were also bringing new words into the Turkish language to describe issues they dealt with, such as "male domination" (''erkek egemenliği''), creating a feminist language that could help the movement grow.{{sfn|Ergun|2017|p=45}} Women in the movement criticized the [[Kemalism|Kemalist]] model of modernity in Turkey and focused on how women are forced to play roles within this modern world.{{sfn|Arat|1997|p=104}} [[Muslim]] women were also involved in the movement, encouraging women of the [[Islam]] faith to speak out about their experiences.{{sfn|Arat|1998|p=124-125}} Secular feminists and Islamic women in Turkey had an influence on each other during this time.{{sfn|Arat|1998|p=128}} Some, like {{Interlanguage link|Sibel Eraslan|tr|Sibel Eraslan|WD=}} described herself as "a feminist with faith."{{sfn|Arat|1998|p=128}} Secular feminists who were involved in the journal, ''Pazartesi'', were supportive of Muslim women "who wanted to redefine their identities as women."{{sfn|Arat|1998|p=128}}

By the mid 1980s, women were holding WLM protests in [[Istanbul]] and [[Ankara]].{{sfn|Arat|1998|p=119}} These feminists were united around the issue of [[domestic violence]] instead of [[abortion]], since abortion was already legal in Turkey.{{sfn|Arat|1998|p=119}} Activists kept track of court proceedings that "gave explicit legitimacy to domestic violence" and protested either by sending letters to the judge or by setting up rallies.{{sfn|Arat|1998|p=120}} There was "enthusiastic turnout" for a protest organized in May 1987 against domestic violence and the government's lack of action towards the issue.{{sfn|Arat|1998|p=120}} A following event, a "1 day festival in October of the same year" helped boost women's confidence in their actions.{{sfn|Arat|1998|p=120}}

The women's movement of the 1980s allowed feminist policies and groups to continue to grow in the 1990s and 2000s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The [[Women's Library and Information Centre Foundation|Women's Library and Information Center]] and the Purple Roof Women's Shelter Foundation were both founded in 1990.{{sfn|Arat|1997|p=106}} Purple Roof worked hard to maintain autonomous control and rejected attempts of the state to "subvert the feminist meaning of their endeavor."{{sfn|Arat|1998|p=120}} One of the major contributors and founders of Purple Roof is [[Canan Arin]].{{sfn|Arat|1998|p=122}}
