      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4436">'''Aesopian language''' is communications that convey an innocent meaning to outsiders but hold a concealed meaning to informed members of a conspiracy or underground movement. For instance, if Person X is known for exposing secrets in an organization, the organization leaders announce that "any members who have dirty talking habits will be dealt with" to warn Person X. It refers to the ancient Greek fabulist [[Aesop]].

The term "Aesopian language" was first used by the nineteenth-century Russian writer [[Mikhail Saltykov-Schedrin]] to describe the writing technique he began using late in his career, which he compared to [[Aesop's Fables]]. His purpose was to satirize the social ills of the time but evade the harsh [[censorship]] of the late [[Russian Empire]] of which he was a particular target.&lt;ref&gt;Prozorov, V.V. (1990). [http://az.lib.ru/s/saltykow_m_e/text_0540.shtml "М.Е.Saltykov-Shchedrin"]. Russian Writers. Biobibliographical Dictionary. Vol 2. Ed. P.A.Nikolayev. Moscow, "Prosveshcheniye" Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviet-era writer [[Lev Loseff]] noted that the use of Aesopian language remained a favorite technique of writers (including himself) under Soviet censorship.&lt;ref&gt;Lev Loseff, ''On the Beneficence of Censorship: Aesopian Language in Modern Russian Literature'', Munich: Otto Sagner, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; Maliheh Tyrell defines the term in the Soviet context and observes that the use of Aesopian language extended to other national literatures under Soviet rule: 
:"In short, this form of literature, like Aesop's animal fables, veils itself in allegorical suggestions, hints, and euphemisms so as to elude political censorship. 'Aesopian language' or literature is a technical term used by Sovietologists to define allegorical language used by Russian or nationality [that is: non-Russian] nonconformist publicists to conceal antiregime sentiments. Under Soviet rule, this 'Aesopian' literature intended to confuse the Soviet authorities, yet illuminate the truth for native readers."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.pl/books?id=h4N_dneMybQC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=literature+intended+to+confuse+the+Soviet+authorities,+yet+illuminate+the+truth+for+native+readers.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=d8VHTCRPO9&amp;sig=9l5K0mKy1wMkHiMWTaxyCfWc8SQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwif0omBq_zSAhXlZpoKHSw_Ah4Q6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=literature%20intended%20to%20confuse%20the%20Soviet%20authorities,%20yet%20illuminate%20the%20truth%20for%20native%20readers.&amp;f=false|title=Aesopian Literary Dimensions of Azerbaijani Literature of the Soviet Period, 1920-1990|last=Tyrrell|first=Maliheh S.|date=2000-01-01|publisher=Lexington Books|year=|isbn=9780739101698|location=|pages=3–4|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to one critic, "Censorship... had a positive, formative impact upon the Aesopian writers' style by obliging them to sharpen their thoughts."&lt;ref&gt;Harry B. Weber, ed., ''The Modern Encyclopedia of Russian and Soviet Literature'', Gulf Breeze, FL: Academic International Press, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

The German-American philosopher [[Herbert Marcuse]] uses the term in his book ''[[One-Dimensional Man]]'' somewhat interchangeably with [[Orwellian]] language.&lt;ref&gt;see H. Marcuse, "One-Dimensional Man". Beacon Press, Boston. 1991 (1964) p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; In that context, "Aesopian Language" refers to the idea that certain usages of language work to 'suppress certain concepts or keep them out of the general discourse within society'.&lt;ref&gt;H. Marcuse, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; An example of such a technique is the use of abbreviations to possibly prevent undesirable questions from arising: "[[AFL-CIO]] entombs the radical political differences which once separated the two organizations."&lt;ref&gt;H. Marcuse, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the context of politics, a term with a very similar meaning is called [[dog-whistle politics]], which describes the use of coded language to address voters' interests. Certain sections of the electorate will react strongly to controversial content if spoken of overtly but may not be so attuned that they notice statements that appear neutral to outsiders.

[[File:Belisaire demandant l'aumone Jacques-Louis David.jpg|thumb|Giving [[alms]] to the poor is often considered an altruistic action.]]
'''Altruism''' is the [[moral principle|principle]] and [[moral courage|moral practice]] of concern for [[happiness]] of other [[human kind|human beings]] and/or animals, resulting in a [[quality of life]] both [[material]] and [[spirituality|spiritual]]. It is a traditional [[virtue]] in many cultures and a core aspect of various religious traditions and secular worldviews, though the concept of "others" toward whom concern should be directed can vary among cultures and religions. In Hindu / Sanathana Dharma (whose philosophy is "inclusive", i.e includes, and welcomes everybody), where the dictum "Vasudaiva Kutumbakam" (the world is ONE FAMILY) is in force, always, "others" means "EVERYONE", unconditionally.

In an extreme case, altruism may become a synonym of selflessness which is the opposite of [[selfishness]].

In a common way of living, it doesn't deny the singular nature of the subject, but realizes the traits of the individual [[personality]] in relation to the others, with a true, direct and personal [[interaction]] with each of them. It is focusing both on a single person and the whole [[community]]. In a (not only) Christian practice, it is the law of love direct to the ego and his neighbour.

The word "altruism" was coined by the French philosopher [[Auguste Comte]] in French, as ''altruisme'', for an [[antonym]] of [[egoism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=altruism (n .)|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=altruism|work=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=Douglas Harper|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Teske|first1=Nathan|title=Political Activists in America: The Identity Construction Model of Political Participation|date=2009|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press|location=University Park, Pa.|isbn=9780271035468|page=101|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7B38I2UEPa0C&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt; He derived it from the Italian ''altrui'', which in turn was derived from Latin ''alteri'', meaning "[[alterity|other people]]" or "somebody else".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ciciloni|first1=Ferdinando|title=A Grammar of the Italian Language|date=1825|publisher=John Murray|location=London|page=64|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=neAGAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Altruism in biological observations in field populations of the day organisms is an individual performing an action which is at a cost to themselves (e.g., pleasure and quality of life, time, probability of survival or reproduction), but benefits, either directly or indirectly, another third-party individual, without the expectation of reciprocity or compensation for that action. Steinberg suggests a definition for altruism in the clinical setting, that is "intentional and voluntary actions that aim to enhance the welfare of another person in the absence of any quid pro quo external rewards".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Altruism in medicine: its definition, nature, and dilemmas|last = Steinberg|first = David|date = 2010|journal = Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=249–57|doi = 10.1017/s0963180109990521|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Altruism can be distinguished from feelings of [[loyalty]], in that whilst the latter is predicated upon social relationships, altruism does not consider relationships. Much debate exists as to whether ''"true"'' altruism is possible in human psychology. The theory of [[psychological egoism]] suggests that no act of sharing, helping or sacrificing can be described as truly altruistic, as the actor may receive an intrinsic reward in the form of personal [[gratification]]. The validity of this argument depends on whether [[Motivation#Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation|intrinsic rewards]] qualify as "benefits".

The term ''[[altruism (ethics)|altruism]]'' may also refer to an ethical doctrine that claims that individuals are morally obliged to benefit others. Used in this sense, it is usually contrasted with [[ethical egoism|egoism]], which claims individuals are morally obligated to serve themselves first.

==The notion of altruism==
The concept has a long history in [[Philosophy|philosophical]] and [[Ethics|ethical]] thought. The term was originally coined in the 19th century by the founding [[sociologist]] and [[philosopher of science]], [[Auguste Comte]], and has become a major topic for [[psychologists]] (especially [[evolutionary psychology]] researchers), [[evolutionary biologists]], and [[ethology|ethologists]]. Whilst ideas about altruism from one field can affect the other fields, the different methods and focuses of these fields always lead to different perspectives on altruism. In simple terms, altruism is caring about the welfare of other people and acting to help them.

==Scientific viewpoints&lt;!--linked from 'Evolution of morality'--&gt;==
===Anthropology===
[[Marcel Mauss]]'s book ''The Gift'' contains a passage called "Note on alms". This note describes the evolution of the notion of alms (and by extension of altruism) from the notion of sacrifice. In it, he writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Alms are the fruits of a moral notion of the gift and of fortune on the one hand, and of a notion of sacrifice, on the other. Generosity is an obligation, because Nemesis avenges the poor and the gods for the superabundance of happiness and wealth of certain people who should rid themselves of it. This is the ancient morality of the gift, which has become a principle of justice. The gods and the spirits accept that the share of wealth and happiness that has been offered to them and had been hitherto destroyed in useless sacrifices should serve the poor and children.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* Compare [[altruism (ethics)|Altruism (ethics) – perception of altruism as self-sacrifice]].
* Compare [[alms|explanation of alms in various scriptures]].

===Evolutionary explanations===

[[File:Manner of Francis Wheatley, Giving alms to beggar children.jpg|thumb|upright|Giving alms to beggar children]]
In the science of [[ethology]] (the study of animal behaviour), and more generally in the study of [[social evolution]], altruism refers to behaviour by an individual that increases the [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor.&lt;ref name="Bell2008"&gt;{{cite book| last = Bell| first = Graham| title = Selection: the mechanism of evolution| year = 2008| publisher = Oxford University Press| location = Oxford| isbn = 0-19-856972-6| pages = 367–368 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[evolutionary psychology]] this may be applied to a wide range of human behaviors such as charity, emergency aid, help to coalition partners, [[Tip (gratuity)|tipping]], courtship gifts, production of [[public good]]s, and [[environmentalism]].&lt;ref name="AEP1"&gt;Pat Barcaly. The evolution of charitable behaviour and the power of reputation. In {{Cite journal | last1 = Roberts | first1 = S. C. | editor1-last = Roberts | doi = 10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199586073.001.0001 | editor1-first = S. Craig | title = Applied Evolutionary Psychology | year = 2011 | publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 9780199586073 | pmid = | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theories of apparently altruistic behavior were accelerated by the need to produce theories compatible with evolutionary origins. Two related strands of research on altruism have emerged from traditional evolutionary analyses and from [[evolutionary game theory]] a mathematical model and analysis of behavioural strategies.

Some of the proposed mechanisms are:
* [[Kin selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biological Altruism|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/altruism-biological/#2|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Okasha|first=Samir|accessdate=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; That animals and humans are more altruistic towards close kin than to distant kin and non-kin has been confirmed in numerous studies across many different cultures. Even subtle cues indicating kinship may unconsciously increase altruistic behavior. One kinship cue is facial resemblance. One study found that slightly altering photographs so that they more closely resembled the faces of study participants increased the trust the participants expressed regarding depicted persons. Another cue is having the same family name, especially if rare, and this has been found to increase helpful behavior. Another study found more cooperative behavior the greater the number of perceived kin in a group. Using kinship terms in political speeches increased audience agreement with the speaker in one study. This effect was especially strong for firstborns, who are typically close to their families.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;
* Vested interests. People are likely to suffer if their friends, allies, and similar social [[ingroup]]s suffer or even disappear. Helping such group members may therefore eventually benefit the altruist. Making ingroup membership more noticeable increases cooperativeness. Extreme self-sacrifice towards the ingroup may be adaptive if a hostile [[Ingroups and outgroups|outgroup]] threatens to kill the entire ingroup.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;
* [[Reciprocal altruism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1086/406755|last1=Trivers|first1=R.L.|year=1971|title=The evolution of reciprocal altruism|journal=Quarterly Review of Biology|volume=46|pages=35–57|url=https://www.academia.edu/1591793}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Reciprocity (evolution)]].
** Direct [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.7466396 |author=R Axelrod and WD Hamilton |title=The evolution of cooperation |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=211 |issue=4489 |date=27 March 1981 |pages=1390–1396 |pmid=7466396 |bibcode = 1981Sci...211.1390A|citeseerx=10.1.1.147.9644 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that it can be beneficial to help others if there is a chance that they can and will reciprocate the help. The effective [[tit for tat]] strategy is one [[game theory|game theoretic]] example. Many people seem to be following a similar strategy by cooperating if and only if others cooperate in return.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;
**:One consequence is that people are more cooperative if it is more likely that individuals will interact again in the future. People tend to be less cooperative if they perceive that the frequency of helpers in the population is lower. They tend to help less if they see non-cooperativeness by others and this effect tend to be stronger than the opposite effect of seeing cooperative behaviors. Simply changing the cooperative framing of a proposal may increase cooperativeness such as calling it a "Community Game" instead of a "Wall Street Game."&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;
**:A tendency towards reciprocity implies that people will feel obligated to respond if someone helps them. This has been used by charities that give small gifts to potential donors hoping thereby to induce reciprocity. Another method is to announce publicly that someone has given a large donation. The tendency to reciprocate can even generalize so people become more helpful toward others in general after being helped. On the other hand, people will avoid or even retaliate against those perceived not to be cooperating. People sometimes mistakenly fail to help when they intended to, or their helping may not be noticed, which may cause unintended conflicts. As such, it may be an optimal strategy to be slightly forgiving of and have a slightly generous interpretation of non-cooperation.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;
**:People are more likely to cooperate on a task if they can communicate with one another first. This may be due to better assessments of cooperativeness or due to exchange of promises. They are more cooperative if they can gradually build trust, instead of being asked to give extensive help immediately. Direct reciprocity and cooperation in a group can be increased by changing the focus and incentives from intra-group competition to larger scale competitions such as between groups or against the general population. Thus, giving grades and promotions based only on an individual's performance relative to a small local group, as is common, may reduce cooperative behaviors in the group.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;
** Indirect reciprocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/nature04131|author=Martin Nowak &amp; Karl Sigmund|title=Evolution of indirect reciprocity|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume=437|issue=27|date=October 2005|pages=1291–1298|pmid=16251955|bibcode = 2005Natur.437.1291N |url=https://www.academia.edu/17949833}}&lt;/ref&gt; The avoidance of poor reciprocators and cheaters causes a person's [[reputation]] to become very important. A person with a good reputation for reciprocity have a higher chance of receiving help even from persons they have had no direct interactions with previously.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;
** [[Strong reciprocity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gintis |first=Herbert |author-link=Herbert Gintis|title=Strong Reciprocity and Human Sociality|journal=[[Journal of Theoretical Biology]]|volume=206|issue=2|date=September 2000|pmid=10966755|pages=169–179|doi=10.1006/jtbi.2000.2111|hdl=10419/105717|hdl-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; A form of reciprocity where some individuals seem to spend more resources on cooperating and punishing than would be most beneficial as predicted by several established theories of altruism. A number of theories have been proposed as explanations as well as criticisms regarding its existence.
** Pseudo-reciprocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2003|title=Genetic and Cultural Evolution of Cooperation, Chapter 11|isbn=0-262-08326-4|publisher=Dahlem Workshop Reports|location=Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt; An organism behaves altruistically and the recipient does not reciprocate but has an increased chance of acting in a way that is selfish but also as a byproduct benefits the altruist.
* [[Signalling theory|Costly signaling]] and the [[handicap principle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.2307/3677205|last1=Zahavi|first1=A.|year=1995|title=Altruism as a handicap – The limitations of kin selection and reciprocity|jstor=3677205|journal=Avian Biol|volume=26|issue=1|pages=1–3|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245271476}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since altruism takes away resources from the altruist it can be an "honest signal" of resource availability and the abilities needed to gather resources. This may signal to others that the altruist is a valuable potential partner. It may also be a signal of interactive and cooperative intentions since those not interacting further in the future gain nothing from the costly signaling. It is unclear if costly signaling can indicate a long-term cooperative personality but people have increased trust for those who help. Costly signaling is pointless if everyone has the same traits, resources, and cooperative intentions but become a potentially more important signal if the population increasingly varies on these characteristics.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;

:Hunters widely sharing the meat has been seen as a costly signal of ability and research has found that good hunters have higher reproductive success and more adulterous relations even if they themselves receive no more of the hunted meat than anyone else. Similarly, holding large feasts and giving large donations has been seen as ways of demonstrating one's resources. Heroic risk-taking has also been interpreted as a costly signal of ability.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;

:Both indirect reciprocity and costly signaling depend on the value of reputation and tend to make similar predictions. One is that people will be more helping when they know that their helping behavior will be communicated to people they will interact with later, is publicly announced, is discussed, or is simply being observed by someone else. This have been documented in many studies. The effect is sensitive to subtle cues such as people being more helpful when there were stylized eyespots instead of a logo on a computer screen. Weak reputational cues such as eyespots may become unimportant if there are stronger cues present and may lose their effect with continued exposure unless reinforced with real reputational effects.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt; Public displays such as public weeping for dead celebrities and participation in demonstrations may be influenced by a desire to be seen as altruistic. People who know that they are publicly monitored sometimes even wastefully donate money they know are not needed by recipient which may be because of reputational concerns.&lt;ref name="AEP2"&gt;Wendy Iredal and Mark van Vugt.

:Women have been found to find altruistic men to be attractive partners. When looking for a long-term partner, altruism may be a preferred trait as it may indicate that he is also willing to share resources with her and her children. It has been shown that men perform altruistic acts in the early stages of a romantic relationship or simply when in the presence of an attractive woman. While both sexes state that kindness is the most preferable trait in a partner there is some evidence that men place less value on this than women and that women may not be more altruistic in presence of an attractive man. Men may even avoid altruistic women in short-term relationships which may be because they expect less success.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;&lt;ref name=AEP2/&gt;

:People may compete over getting the benefits of a high reputation which may cause [[competitive altruism]]. On the other hand, in some experiments a proportion of people do not seem to care about reputation and they do not help more even if this is conspicuous. This may possibly be due to reasons such as [[psychopathy]] or that they are so attractive that they need not be seen to be altruistic. The reputational benefits of altruism occur in the future as compared to the immediate costs of altruism in the present. While humans and other organisms generally place less value on future costs/benefits as compared to those in the present, some have shorter time horizons than others and these people tend to be less cooperative.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;

:Explicit [[extrinsic]] rewards and punishments have been found to sometimes actually have the opposite effect on behaviors compared to intrinsic rewards. This may be because such extrinsic, top-down incentives may replace (partially or in whole) intrinsic and reputational incentives, motivating the person to focus on obtaining the extrinsic rewards, which overall may make the behaviors less desirable. Another effect is that people would like altruism to be due to a personality characteristic rather than due to overt reputational concerns and simply pointing out that there are reputational benefits of an action may actually reduce them. This may possibly be used as derogatory tactic against altruists, especially by those who are non-cooperators. A counterargument is that doing good due to reputational concerns is better than doing no good at all.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;
* [[Group selection]]. It has controversially been argued by some evolutionary scientists such as [[David Sloan Wilson]] that natural selection can act at the level of non-kin groups to produce adaptations that benefit a non-kin group even if these adaptions are detrimental at the individual level. Thus, while altruistic persons may under some circumstances be outcompeted by less altruistic persons at the individual level, according to group selection theory the opposite may occur at the group level where groups consisting of the more altruistic persons may outcompete groups consisting of the less altruistic persons. Such altruism may only extend to ingroup members while there may instead prejudice and antagonism against outgroup members (See also [[in-group favoritism]]). Group selection theory has been criticized by many other evolutionary scientists.&lt;ref&gt;Leon Neyfakh

[[File:Helping the homeless (cropped).jpg|right|thumb|Helping the [[Homelessness|homeless]] in New York City]]
Such explanations do not imply that humans are always consciously calculating how to increase their [[inclusive fitness]] when they are doing altruistic acts. Instead, evolution has shaped psychological mechanisms, such as emotions, that promote altruistic behaviors.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;

Every single instance of altruistic behavior need not always increase inclusive fitness; altruistic behaviors would have been selected for if such behaviors on average increased inclusive fitness in the ancestral environment. This need not imply that on average 50% or more of altruistic acts were beneficial for the altruist in the ancestral environment; if the benefits from helping the right person were very high it would be beneficial to err on the side of caution and usually be altruistic even if in most cases there were no benefits.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;

The benefits for the altruist may be increased and the costs reduced by being more altruistic towards certain groups. Research has found that people are more altruistic to kin than to no-kin, to friends than to strangers, to those attractive than to those unattractive, to non-competitors than to competitors, and to members ingroups than to members of outgroup.&lt;ref name=AEP1/&gt;

The study of altruism was the initial impetus behind [[George R. Price]]'s development of the [[Price equation]], which is a mathematical equation used to study genetic evolution. An interesting example of altruism is found in the cellular [[slime mould]]s, such as ''[[Dictyostelid|Dictyostelium]] mucoroides.'' These protists live as individual [[amoeba]]e until starved, at which point they aggregate and form a multicellular fruiting body in which some cells sacrifice themselves to promote the survival of other cells in the fruiting body.

Selective investment theory proposes that close social bonds, and associated emotional, cognitive, and neurohormonal mechanisms, evolved in order to facilitate long-term, high-cost altruism between those closely depending on one another for survival and reproductive success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1207/s15327965pli1701_01 |last1=Brown |first1=S.L. |last2=Brown |first2=R.M. |year=2006 |title=Selective investment theory: Recasting the functional significance of close relationships |url=http://icos.groups.si.umich.edu/Brown-Stephanie.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714230521/http://icos.groups.si.umich.edu/Brown-Stephanie.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-07-14 |format=PDF |journal=Psychological Inquiry |volume=17 |pages=1–29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icts.res.in/media/uploads/Talk/Document/StLouis2011TelmoFIN.pdf{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such cooperative behaviors have sometimes been seen as arguments for left-wing politics such by the Russian zoologist and anarchist [[Peter Kropotkin]] in his 1902 book ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]'' and [[Peter Singer]] in his book ''[[A Darwinian Left]].''

===Neurobiology===
Jorge Moll and Jordan Grafman, neuroscientists at the [[National Institutes of Health]] and LABS-D'Or Hospital Network (J.M.) provided the first evidence for the neural bases of altruistic giving in normal healthy volunteers, using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]]. In their research, published in the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] USA in October 2006,&lt;ref&gt;Human fronto–mesolimbic networks guide decisions about charitable donation, PNAS 2006:103(42);15623–15628&lt;/ref&gt; they showed that both pure monetary rewards and charitable donations activated the [[Mesolimbic pathway|mesolimbic]] reward pathway, a primitive part of the brain that usually responds to food and sex. However, when volunteers generously placed the interests of others before their own by making charitable donations, another brain circuit was selectively activated: the subgenual cortex/[[septal region]]. These structures are intimately related to social attachment and bonding in other species. Altruism, the experiment suggested, was not a superior moral faculty that suppresses basic selfish urges but rather was basic to the brain, hard-wired and pleasurable.&lt;ref name="brain"&gt;{{cite news

In fact, in an experiment published in March 2007 at the [[University of Southern California]] neuroscientist [[Antonio R. Damasio]] and his colleagues showed that subjects with damage to the [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]] lack the ability to empathically feel their way to moral answers, and that When confronted with moral dilemmas, these brain-damaged patients coldly came up with "end-justifies-the-means" answers, leading Damasio to conclude that the point was not that they reached immoral conclusions, but that when they were confronted by a difficult issue - in this case as whether to shoot down a passenger plane hijacked by terrorists before it hits a major city - these patients appear to reach decisions without the anguish that afflicts those with normally functioning brains. According to [[Adrian Raine]], a clinical neuroscientist also at the University of Southern California, one of this study's implications is that society may have to rethink how it judges immoral people: "Psychopaths often feel no empathy or remorse. Without that awareness, people relying exclusively on reasoning seem to find it harder to sort their way through moral thickets. Does that mean they should be held to different standards of accountability?"&lt;ref name="brain"/&gt;

In another study, in the 1990s, Dr. Bill Harbaugh, a [[University of Oregon]] economist, concluded people are motivated to give for reasons of personal prestige and in a similar fMRI scanner test in 2007 with his psychologist colleague Dr. Ulrich Mayr, reached the same conclusions of Jorge Moll and Jordan Grafman about giving to charity, although they were able to divide the study group into two groups: "egoists" and "altruists". One of their discoveries was that, though rarely, even some of the considered "egoists" sometimes gave more than expected because that would help others, leading to the conclusion that there are other factors in cause in charity, such as a person's environment and values.&lt;ref name="neurons"/&gt;

===Psychology===
The International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences defines ''psychological altruism'' as "a motivational state with the goal of increasing another’s welfare." Psychological altruism is contrasted with ''psychological egoism,'' which refers to the motivation to increase one's own welfare.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"&gt;["Altruism." International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences. Ed. William A. Darity, Jr. 2nd ed. Vol. 1. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA, 2008. 87-88. Gale Virtual Reference Library. Web. 10 April 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been some debate on whether or not humans are truly capable of psychological altruism.&lt;ref name="batson3"&gt;[Batson, C. (2011). Altruism in humans. New York, NY US: Oxford University Press.]&lt;/ref&gt; Some definitions specify a self-sacrificial nature to altruism and a lack of external rewards for altruistic behaviors.&lt;ref name="prosocial"&gt;[Batson, C. (2012). A history of prosocial behavior research. In A. W. Kruglanski, [[Wolfgang Stroebe|W. Stroebe]], A. W. Kruglanski, (Eds.), Handbook of the history of social psychology (pp. 243–264). New York, NY US: Psychology Press.]&lt;/ref&gt; However, because altruism ultimately benefits the self in many cases, the selflessness of altruistic acts is brought to question. The [[social exchange theory]] postulates that altruism only exists when benefits to the self outweigh costs to the self.&lt;ref name="noaltruism"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maner | first1 = J.

He identified four major motives for altruism: altruism to ultimately benefit the self (egoism), to ultimately benefit the other person (altruism), to benefit a group (collectivism), or to uphold a moral principle ([[principlism]]). Altruism that ultimately serves selfish gains is thus differentiated from selfless altruism, but the general conclusion has been that empathy-induced altruism can be genuinely selfless.&lt;ref name=" baston2"&gt;[Batson, C., Ahmad, N., &amp; Stocks, E. L. (2011). Four forms of prosocial motivation: Egoism, altruism, collectivism, and principlism. In D. Dunning, D. Dunning (Eds.), Social motivation (pp. 103–126). New York, NY US: Psychology Press.]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[empathy-altruism]] hypothesis'' basically states that psychological altruism does exist and is evoked by the empathic desire to help someone who is suffering. Feelings of empathic concern are contrasted with feelings of personal distress, which compel people to reduce their own unpleasant emotions. People with empathic concern help others in distress even when exposure to the situation could be easily avoided, whereas those lacking in empathic concern avoid helping unless it is difficult or impossible to avoid exposure to another's suffering.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt; Helping behavior is seen in humans at about two years old, when a toddler is capable of understanding subtle emotional cues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Svetlova|first1=M.|last2=Nichols|first2=S.

In psychological research on altruism, studies often observe altruism as demonstrated through prosocial behaviors such as helping, comforting, sharing, cooperation, philanthropy, and community service.&lt;ref name="prosocial"/&gt; Research has found that people are most likely to help if they recognize that a person is in need and feel personal responsibility for reducing the person's distress. Research also suggests that the number of bystanders witnessing distress or suffering affects the likelihood of helping (the ''[[Bystander effect]]''). Greater numbers of bystanders decrease individual feelings of responsibility.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hudson | first1 = James M. | last2 = Bruckman | first2 = Amy S. | year = 2004 | title = The Bystander Effect: A Lens for Understanding Patterns of Participation | url = | journal = Journal of the Learning Sciences | volume = 13 | issue = 2| pages = 165–195 | doi = 10.1207/s15327809jls1302_2 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.72.4881 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a witness with a high level of empathic concern is likely to assume personal responsibility entirely regardless of the number of bystanders.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt;

Many studies have observed the effects of [[volunteering|volunteerism]] (as a form of altruism) on happiness and health and have consistently found a strong connection between volunteerism and current and future health and well-being.&lt;ref name="volunteer1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Musick|first1=M.

Studies have also been careful to note that feeling over-taxed by the needs of others has conversely negative effects on health and happiness.&lt;ref name="volunteer5"/&gt; For example, one study on volunteerism found that feeling overwhelmed by others' demands had an even stronger negative effect on mental health than helping had a positive one (although positive effects were still significant).&lt;ref name="overwhelmed"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schwartz|first1=C.|last2=Meisenhelder|first2=J.|last3=Ma|first3=Y.|last4=Reed|first4=G.|year=2003|title=Altruistic Social Interest Behaviors Are Associated With Better Mental Health|journal=Psychosomatic Medicine|volume=65|issue=5|pages=778–785|doi=10.1097/01.PSY.0000079378.39062.D4|pmid=14508020|citeseerx=10.1.1.529.7780}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, while generous acts make people feel good about themselves, it is also important for people to appreciate the kindness they receive from others. Studies suggest that gratitude goes hand-in-hand with kindness and is also very important for our well-being. A study on the relationship happiness to various character strengths showed that "a conscious focus on gratitude led to reductions in negative affect and increases in optimistic appraisals, positive affect, offering emotional support, sleep quality, and well-being.".&lt;ref name="gratitude"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shimai|first1=S.|last2=Otake|first2=K.|last3=Park|first3=N.|last4=Peterson|first4=C.|last5=Seligman|first5=M.

===Sociology===
"Sociologists have long been concerned with how to build the good society" ("Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity". American Sociological Association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asanet.org/sections/altruism.cfm American Sociological Association: Altruism, Morality and Social Solidarity&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503051933/http://asanet.org/sections/altruism.cfm |date=3 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). The structure of our societies and how individuals come to exhibit charitable, philanthropic, and other pro-social, altruistic actions for the common good is a largely researched topic within the field. The American Sociology Association (ASA) acknowledges [[Public sociology]] saying, "The intrinsic scientific, policy, and public relevance of this field of investigation in helping to construct 'good societies' is unquestionable" ("Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity" ASA). This type of sociology seeks contributions that aid grassroots and theoretical understandings of what motivates altruism and how it is organized, and promotes an altruistic focus in order to benefit the world and people it studies. How altruism is framed, organized, carried out, and what motivates it at the group level is an area of focus that sociologists seek to investigate in order to contribute back to the groups it studies and "build the good society". The motivation of altruism is also the focus of study; some publications link the occurrence of moral outrage to the punishment of perpetrators and compensation of victims.&lt;ref&gt;Thulin EW, Bicchieri C. I’m so angry I could help you: Moral outrage as a driver of victim compensation. Social Philosophy &amp; Policy, 2016, 32: 146-160&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pathological altruism===
[[Pathology|Pathological]] altruism is when altruism is taken to an unhealthy extreme, and either harms the altruistic person, or well-intentioned actions cause more harm than good.

The term "pathological altruism" was popularised by the book ''[[Pathological Altruism]]''.

Examples include depression and burnout seen in healthcare professionals, an unhealthy focus on others to the detriment of one's own needs, hoarding of animals, and ineffective philanthropic and social programs that ultimately worsen the situations they are meant to aid.&lt;ref&gt;http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199738571.do&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious viewpoints==
{{See also|Evolutionary origin of religions}}
Most, if not all, of the world's religions promote altruism as a very important moral value. [[Buddhism]], [[Christianity]], [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]], [[Jainism]], [[Judaism]], and [[Sikhism]], etc., place particular emphasis on altruistic morality.

===Buddhism===
[[File:Monks collecting alms - Bun Vat Phu.JPG|thumb|Monks collecting alms]]
Altruism figures prominently in Buddhism. Love and compassion are components of all forms of Buddhism, and are focused on all beings equally: love is the wish that all beings be happy, and compassion is the wish that all beings be free from suffering. "Many illnesses can be cured by the one medicine of love and compassion. These qualities are the ultimate source of human happiness, and the need for them lies at the very core of our being" ([[Dalai Lama]]).&lt;ref name="Speech by the Dalai Lama"&gt;[http://www.dalailama.com/page.65.htm Speech by the Dalai Lama] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003223717/http://www.dalailama.com/page.65.htm |date=3 October 2009 }}&lt;br&gt;The phrase "core of our being" is [[Freudian]]; see {{Cite journal | author = Bettina Bock von Wülfingen | year = 2013 | title = Freud's 'Core of our Being' Between Cytology and Psychoanalysis | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bewi.201301604/pdf | journal = Berichte zur Wissenschaftsgeschichte | volume = 36 | pages = 226–244 | doi = 10.1002/bewi.201301604 | issue = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, the notion of altruism is modified in such a world-view, since the belief is that such a practice promotes our own happiness: "The more we care for the happiness of others, the greater our own sense of well-being becomes" (Dalai Lama&lt;ref name="Speech by the Dalai Lama"/&gt;).

In the context of larger ethical discussions on moral action and judgment, Buddhism is characterized by the belief that negative (unhappy) consequences of our actions derive not from punishment or correction based on moral judgment, but from the law of karma, which functions like a natural law of cause and effect. A simple illustration of such cause and effect is the case of experiencing the effects of what one causes: if one causes suffering, then as a natural consequence one would experience suffering; if one causes happiness, then as a natural consequence one would experience happiness.

===Jainism===
{{see also|Ahimsa in Jainism}}
[[File:Ahinsa.jpg|thumb|Sculpture depicting the Jain concept of ''ahimsa'' (non-injury)]]
The fundamental principles of [[Jainism]] revolve around the concept of altruism, not only for humans but for all sentient beings. Jainism preaches the view of ''[[Ahimsa]]'' – to live and let live, thereby not harming sentient beings, i.e. uncompromising reverence for all life. It also considers all living things to be equal. The first [[Tirthankara]], [[Rishabhdev]], introduced the concept of altruism for all living beings, from extending knowledge and experience to others to donation, giving oneself up for others, non-violence and compassion for all living things.

Jainism prescribes a path of non-violence to progress the soul to this ultimate goal. A major characteristic of Jain belief is the emphasis on the consequences of not only physical but also mental behaviors. One's unconquered mind with anger, pride (ego), deceit, greed and uncontrolled sense organs are the powerful enemies of humans. Anger spoils good relations, pride destroys humility, deceit destroys peace and greed destroys everything. Jainism recommends conquering anger by forgiveness, pride by humility, deceit by straightforwardness and greed by contentment.

Jains believe that to attain enlightenment and ultimately liberation, one must practice the following ethical principles (major vows) in thought, speech and action. The degree to which these principles are practiced is different for householders and monks. They are:
# Non-violence (Ahimsa);
# Truthfulness (Satya);
# Non-stealing (Asteya);
# Celibacy ([[Brahmacharya]]);
# [[Non-possession]] or non-materialism (Aparigraha);
The "great vows" ([[Mahavrata]]) are prescribed for monks and "limited vows" ([[Anuvrata]]) are prescribed for householders. The house-holders are encouraged to practice the above-mentioned five vows. The monks have to observe them very strictly. With consistent practice, it will be possible to overcome the limitations gradually, accelerating the spiritual progress.

The principle of non-violence seeks to minimize karmas which limit the capabilities of the soul. Jainism views every [[Soul (Jainism)|soul]] as worthy of respect because it has the potential to become ''Siddha'' ([[God in Jainism]]). Because all living beings possess a soul, great care and awareness is essential in one's actions. Jainism emphasizes the equality of all life, advocating harmlessness towards all, whether the creatures are great or small. This policy extends even to microscopic organisms. Jainism acknowledges that every person has different capabilities and capacities to practice and therefore accepts different levels of compliance for ascetics and householders.

===Christianity===
[[File:StThomasMount Theresa.JPG|thumb|Statue of [[Mother Teresa]] in India]]
Altruism is central to the teachings of Jesus found in the [[Gospel]], especially in the [[Sermon on the Mount]] and the [[Sermon on the Plain]]. From biblical to medieval [[Christian traditions]], tensions between self-affirmation and other-regard were sometimes discussed under the heading of "disinterested love", as in the [[Paul the Apostle|Pauline]] phrase "love seeks not its own interests." In his book ''Indoctrination and Self-deception,'' Roderick Hindery tries to shed light on these tensions by contrasting them with impostors of authentic self-affirmation and altruism, by analysis of other-regard within creative individuation of the self, and by contrasting love for the few with love for the many. Love confirms others in their freedom, shuns propaganda and masks, assures others of its presence, and is ultimately confirmed not by mere declarations from others, but by each person's experience and practice from within. As in practical arts, the presence and meaning of love becomes validated and grasped not by words and reflections alone, but in the making of the connection.

[[St Thomas Aquinas]] interprets 'You should love your neighbour as yourself'&lt;ref&gt;[[Leviticus]] 19 and Matthew 22&lt;/ref&gt; as meaning that love for ourselves is the exemplar of love for others.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Summa Theologica]]'', II:II Quaestio 25, Article 4&lt;/ref&gt; Considering that "the love with which a man loves himself is the form and root of friendship" and quotes Aristotle that "the origin of friendly relations with others lies in our relations to ourselves,"&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicomachean Ethics]] IX.4 1166a1&lt;/ref&gt; he concluded that though we are not bound to love others more than ourselves, we naturally seek the common good, the good of the whole, more than any private good, the good of a part. However, he thinks we should love God more than ourselves and our neighbours, and more than our bodily life—since the ultimate purpose of loving our neighbour is to share in eternal beatitude: a more desirable thing than bodily well being. In coining the word Altruism, as stated above, [[Auguste Comte|Comte]] was probably opposing this Thomistic doctrine, which is present in some theological schools within Catholicism.

Many biblical authors draw a strong connection between love of others and love of God. 1 John 4 states that for one to love God one must love his fellowman, and that hatred of one's fellowman is the same as hatred of God. [[Thomas Jay Oord]] has argued in several books that altruism is but one possible form of love. An altruistic action is not always a loving action. Oord defines altruism as acting for the other's good, and he agrees with feminists who note that sometimes love requires acting for one's own good when the other's demands undermine overall well-being.

German philosopher [[Max Scheler]] distinguishes two ways in which the strong can help the weak. One way is a sincere expression of Christian love, "motivated by a powerful feeling of security, strength, and inner salvation, of the invincible fullness of one’s own life and existence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scheler|first=Max|title=Ressentiment|year=1961|pages=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another way is merely "one of the many modern substitutes for love, ... nothing but the urge to turn away from oneself and to lose oneself in other people’s business."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scheler|first=Max|title=Ressentiment|year=1961|pages=95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its worst, Scheler says, "love for the small, the poor, the weak, and the oppressed is really disguised hatred, repressed envy, an impulse to detract, etc., directed against the opposite phenomena: wealth, strength, power, largesse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scheler|first=Max|title=Ressentiment|year=1961|pages=96–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
In [[Islam]], the concept 'ithaar' (إيثار) (altruism) is the notion of 'preferring others to oneself'. For Sufis, this means devotion to others through complete forgetfulness of one's own concerns, where concern for others is rooted to be a demand made by ALLAH on the human body, considered to be property of ALLAH alone. The importance lies in sacrifice for the sake of the greater good; [[Islam]] considers those practicing Eyaar as abiding by the highest degree of nobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = M| title = Key Concepts in the Practice of Sufism: Emerald Hills of the Heart| year = 2004| publisher = Fountain| location = Rutherford, N.J.| isbn = 1-932099-75-1| pages = 10–11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This is similar to the notion of chivalry, but unlike that European concept, in i'thar attention is focused on everything in existence. A constant concern for [[ALLAH]] (i.e. God) results in a careful attitude towards people, animals, and other things in this world.&lt;ref name="Neusner2005"&gt;{{cite book| last = Neusner| first = Jacob Eds| title = Altruism in World Religions| year = 2005| publisher = Georgetown Univ. Press| location = Washington, D.C.| isbn = 1-58901-065-5| pages = 79–80 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This concept was emphasized by Sufis of Islam like [[Rabia al-Adawiyya]] who paid attention to the difference between dedication to [[ALLAH]] (i.e. God) and dedication to people. Thirteenth-century Turkish Sufi poet [[Yunus Emre]] explained this philosophy as "Yaratılanı severiz, Yaratandan ötürü" or ''We love the creature, because of The Creator.'' For many Muslims, i'thar must be practiced as a religious obligation during specific Islamic holidays. However, i'thar is also still an Islamic ideal to which all Muslims should strive to adhere at all times.

===Judaism===
Judaism defines altruism as the desired goal of creation. The famous Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]] stated that love is the most important attribute in humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author2=Ben Zion Bokser |last1=Kook |first1=Abraham Isaac| title = Abraham Isaac Kook: The lights of penitence, The moral principles, Lights of holiness, essays, letters, and poems| year = 1978| publisher = Paulist Press| isbn = 978-0-8091-2159-5| pages = 135–136}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is defined as [[Tzedakah|bestowal]], or giving, which is the intention of altruism. This can be altruism towards humanity that leads to altruism towards the creator or God. [[Kabbalah]] defines God as the force of giving in [[existence]]. Rabbi [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]] in particular focused on the 'purpose of creation' and how the will of God was to bring creation into perfection and adhesion with this upper force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Luzzatto| first = Moshe Ḥayyim| title = The way of God| year = 1997| publisher = Feldheim Publishers| isbn = 978-0-87306-769-0| pages = 37–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Kabbalah developed by Rabbi [[Yehuda Ashlag]], in his writings about the future generation, focuses on how society could achieve an altruistic social framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Ashlag| first = Yehuda| title = Building the Future Society| url = http://www.kabbalah.info/eng/content/view/frame/3811?/eng/content/view/full/3811&amp;main| year = 2006| publisher = Laitman Kabbalah Publishers| location = Thornhill, Canada| isbn = 965-7065-34-8| pages = 120–130 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashlag proposed that such a framework is the purpose of creation, and everything that happens is to raise humanity to the level of altruism, love for one another. Ashlag focused on society and its relation to [[divinity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Ashlag| first = Yehuda| title = Building the Future Society| url = http://www.kabbalah.info/eng/content/view/frame/3811?/eng/content/view/full/3811&amp;main| year = 2006| publisher = Laitman Kabbalah Publishers| location = Thornhill, Canada| isbn = 965-7065-34-8| pages = 175–180 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sikhism===
Altruism is essential to the Sikh religion. The central faith in Sikhism is that the greatest deed any one can do is to imbibe and live the godly qualities like love, affection, sacrifice, patience, harmony, truthfulness. The concept of [[selfless service|"seva]]," or selfless service to the community for its own sake is an important concept in Sihkism. &lt;ref name=DictofSikhism&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/APopularDictionaryOfSikhism/page/n38 |title=A Popular Dictionary of Sikhism |publisher=''Curzon Press''|author=Cole, W. Owen and Sambhi, Piara Singh |pages=38-39, 84 |date=1990|accessdate=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The fifth Nanak, Guru Arjun Dev, sacrificed his life to uphold 22 carats of pure truth, the greatest gift to humanity, the Guru Granth. The ninth Guru, Tegh Bahadur, sacrificed his head to protect weak and defenseless people against atrocity. In the late seventeenth century, [[Guru Gobind Singh]] Ji (the tenth [[guru]] in Sikhism), was in war with the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] rulers to protect the people of different faiths when a fellow Sikh, [[Bhai Kanhaiya]], attended the troops of the enemy.&lt;ref name=GobindSingh&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofthesikh025030mbp/page/n7 |title=A History Of The Sikhs |publisher=''Oxford University Press''|author= Joseph Davey Cunningham |date=1918 |page=ix |accessdate=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gave water to both friends and foes who were wounded on the battlefield. Some of the enemy began to fight again and some Sikh warriors were annoyed by Bhai Kanhaiya as he was helping their enemy. Sikh soldiers brought Bhai Kanhaiya before Guru Gobind Singh Ji, and complained of his action that they considered counter-productive to their struggle on the battlefield."What were you doing, and why?" asked the Guru. "I was giving water to the wounded because I saw your face in all of them," replied Bhai Kanhaiya. The Guru responded, "Then you should also give them ointment to heal their wounds. You were practicing what you were coached in the house of the Guru."

It was under the tutelage of the Guru that Bhai Kanhaiya subsequently founded a volunteer corps for altruism. This volunteer corps still to date is engaged in doing good to others and trains new volunteering recruits for doing the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = O. P. Ralhan| title = The great gurus of the Sikhs| year = 1997| publisher = Anmol Publications Pvt Ltd.| location = New Delhi| isbn = 81-7488-479-3| page = 253 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===
In Hinduism Selflessness (Atmatyag), Love (Prema), Kindness (Daya) and Forgiveness (Kshama) are considered as the highest acts of humanity or "Manushyattva". Giving alms to the beggers or poor people is considered as a divine act or "Punya" and Hindus believe it will free their souls from guilt or "Paapa" and will led them to heaven or "Swarga" in afterlife. Altruism is also the central act of various Hindu mythology and religious poems and songs.

[[Swami Vivekananda]], the legendary Hindu monk, has said -"Jive prem kare jeijon, Seijon sebiche Iswar" (Whoever loves any living being, is serving god.). Mass donation of clothes to poor people (Vastraseva), or blood donation camp or mass food donation (Annaseva) for poor people is common in various Hindu religious ceremonies.

[[Swami Sivananda]], an [[Advaita]] scholar, reiterates the views in his commentary synthesising Vedanta views on the [[Brahma Sutras]], a Vedantic text. In his commentary on Chapter 3 of the Brahma Sutras, Sivananda notes that karma is insentient and short-lived, and ceases to exist as soon as a deed is executed. Hence, karma cannot bestow the fruits of actions at a future date according to one's merit. Furthermore, one cannot argue that karma generates [[apurva]] or [[Merit (Buddhism)|punya]], which gives fruit. Since apurva is non-sentient, it cannot act unless moved by an intelligent being such as a god. It cannot independently bestow reward or punishment.

However the very well known and popular text, the [[Bhagavad Gita]] supports the doctrine of karma yoga (achieving oneness with God through action) &amp; "nishkaama karma" or action without expectation / desire for personal gain which can be said to encompass altruism. Altruistic acts are generally celebrated and very well received in Hindu literature and is central to Hindu morality.&lt;ref&gt;Sivananda, Swami. ''Phaladhikaranam, Topic 8'', Sutras 38–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
{{main|Altruism (ethics)}}

There exists a wide range of philosophical views on humans' obligations or motivations to act altruistically. Proponents of [[Altruism (ethics)|ethical altruism]] maintain that individuals are morally obligated to act altruistically. The opposing view is [[ethical egoism]], which maintains that moral agents should always act in their own self-interest. Both ethical altruism and ethical egoism contrast with [[utilitarianism]], which maintains that each agent should act in order to maximise the efficacy of their function and the benefit to both themselves and their co-inhabitants.

A related concept in [[descriptive ethics]] is [[psychological egoism]], the thesis that humans always act in their own self-interest and that true altruism is impossible. [[Rational egoism]] is the view that [[rationality]] consists in acting in one's self-interest (without specifying how this affects one's moral obligations).

==Genetics==
The genes [[OXTR]], [[CD38]], [[COMT]], [[DRD4]], [[DRD5]], [[IGF2]], [[GABRB2]] have been found to be candidate genes for altruism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=3871336 | pmid=24132092 | doi=10.1098/rsbl.2013.0395 | volume=9 | title=Genes underlying altruism | year=2013 | journal=Biol Lett | page=20130395 | last1 = Thompson | first1 = GJ | last2 = Hurd | first2 = PL | last3 = Crespi | first3 = BJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11123">In mathematics, the '''Banach–Caccioppoli [[fixed-point theorem]]''' (also known as the '''contraction mapping theorem''' or '''contraction mapping principle''') is an important tool in the theory of [[metric space]]s; it guarantees the existence and uniqueness of [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed points]] of certain self-maps of metric spaces, and provides a constructive method to find those fixed points.  The theorem is named after [[Stefan Banach]] (1892–1945) and [[Renato Caccioppoli]] (1904–1959), and was first stated by Banach in 1922. Caccioppoli independently proved the theorem in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emis.de/journals/BJMA/tex_v1_n1_a1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statement==
''Definition.'' Let &lt;math&gt;(X,d)&lt;/math&gt; be a [[metric space]]. Then a map &lt;math&gt;T\colon X \to X&lt;/math&gt; is called a [[contraction mapping]] on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; if there exists &lt;math&gt;q\in [0, 1)&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;d(T(x),T(y)) \le q d(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;
for all &lt;math&gt;x, y&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Banach Fixed Point Theorem.''' Let &lt;math&gt;(X,d)&lt;/math&gt; be a non-empty [[complete metric space]] with a contraction mapping &lt;math&gt;T\colon X \to X&lt;/math&gt;. Then ''T'' admits a unique [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed-point]] ''x*'' in ''X'' (i.e. ''T''(''x*'') = ''x*''). Furthermore, ''x*'' can be found as follows: start with an arbitrary element ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in ''X'' and define a sequence {''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''} by ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''T''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt;), then {{nowrap|''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' → ''x*''}}.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Remark 1.'' The following inequalities are equivalent and describe the [[Rate of convergence|speed of convergence]]:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
d(x^*, x_n) &amp; \leq \frac{q^n}{1-q} d(x_1,x_0), \\
d(x^*, x_{n+1}) &amp; \leq \frac{q}{1-q} d(x_{n+1},x_n), \\
d(x^*, x_{n+1}) &amp; \leq q d(x^*,x_n).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Any such value of ''q'' is called a ''[[Lipschitz constant]]'' for ''T'', and the smallest one is sometimes called "the best Lipschitz constant" of ''T''.

''Remark 2.'' ''d''(''T''(''x''),&amp;nbsp;''T''(''y''))&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''d''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') for all ''x'' ≠ ''y'' is in general not enough to ensure the existence of a fixed point, as is shown by the map ''T'' : [1, ∞) → [1, ∞), ''T''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1/''x'', which lacks a fixed point. However, if ''X'' is [[Compact space|compact]], then this weaker assumption does imply the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point, that can be easily found as a minimizer of ''d''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''T''(''x'')), indeed, a minimizer exists by compactness, and has to be a fixed point of ''T''. It then easily follows that the fixed point is the limit of any sequence of iterations of ''T''.

''Remark 3.'' When using the theorem in practice, the most difficult part is typically to define ''X'' properly so that ''T''(''X'') ⊆ ''X''.

==Proof==

Let ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''X'' be arbitrary and define a sequence {''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''} by setting ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''T''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt;). We first note that for all ''n'' ∈ '''N''', we have the inequality

:&lt;math&gt;d(x_{n+1}, x_n) \le q^n d(x_1, x_0).&lt;/math&gt;

This follows by [[principle of mathematical induction|induction]] on ''n'', using the fact that ''T'' is a contraction mapping. Then we can show that {''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''} is a [[Cauchy sequence]]. In particular, let ''m'', ''n'' ∈ '''N''' such that ''m'' &gt; ''n'':

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
d(x_m, x_n) &amp; \leq d(x_m, x_{m-1}) + d(x_{m-1}, x_{m-2}) + \cdots + d(x_{n+1}, x_n) \\
&amp; \leq q^{m-1}d(x_1, x_0) + q^{m-2}d(x_1, x_0) + \cdots + q^nd(x_1, x_0) \\
&amp; = q^n d(x_1, x_0) \sum_{k=0}^{m-n-1} q^k \\
&amp; \leq q^n d(x_1, x_0) \sum_{k=0}^\infty q^k \\
&amp; = q^n d(x_1, x_0) \left ( \frac{1}{1-q} \right ).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Let ε &gt; 0 be arbitrary, since ''q'' ∈ [0, 1), we can find a large ''N'' ∈ '''N''' so that

:&lt;math&gt;q^N &lt; \frac{\varepsilon(1-q)}{d(x_1, x_0)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, by choosing ''m'' and ''n'' greater than ''N'' we may write:

:&lt;math&gt;d(x_m, x_n)  \leq q^n d(x_1, x_0) \left ( \frac{1}{1-q} \right ) &lt; \left (\frac{\varepsilon(1-q)}{d(x_1, x_0)} \right ) d(x_1, x_0) \left ( \frac{1}{1-q} \right ) = \varepsilon.&lt;/math&gt;

This proves that the sequence {''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''} is Cauchy. By completeness of (''X'',''d''), the sequence has a limit ''x*'' ∈ ''X''. Furthermore, ''x*'' must be a [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] of ''T'':

:&lt;math&gt; x^*=\lim_{n\to\infty} x_n = \lim_{n\to\infty} T(x_{n-1}) = T\left(\lim_{n\to\infty} x_{n-1} \right) = T(x^*). &lt;/math&gt;

As a contraction mapping, ''T'' is continuous, so bringing the limit inside ''T'' was justified. Lastly, ''T'' cannot have more than one fixed point in (''X'',''d''), since any pair of distinct fixed points ''p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' would contradict the contraction of ''T'':

:&lt;math&gt;0 &lt; d(T(p_1),T(p_2)) = d(p_1,p_2) &gt; q d(p_1, p_2).&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications==
*A standard application is the proof of the [[Picard–Lindelöf theorem]] about the existence and uniqueness of solutions to certain [[ordinary differential equation]]s. The sought solution of the differential equation is expressed as a fixed point of a suitable integral operator which transforms continuous functions into continuous functions. The Banach fixed-point theorem is then used to show that this integral operator has a unique fixed point.
*One consequence of the Banach fixed-point theorem is that small Lipschitz perturbations of the identity are [[Lipschitz continuity#Definitions|bi-lipschitz]] homeomorphisms. Let Ω be an open set of a Banach space ''E''; let ''I'' : Ω → ''E'' denote the identity (inclusion) map and let ''g'' : Ω → ''E'' be a Lipschitz map of constant ''k'' &lt; 1. Then 
#Ω′ := (''I''+''g'')(Ω) is an open subset of ''E'': precisely, for any ''x'' in Ω such that ''B''(''x'', ''r'') ⊂ Ω one has ''B''((''I''+''g'')(''x''), ''r''(1−''k'')) ⊂ Ω′; 
#''I''+''g'' : Ω → Ω′ is a bi-lipschitz homeomorphism; 
:precisely, (''I''+''g'')&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; is still of the form ''I'' + ''h'' : Ω → Ω′ with ''h'' a Lipschitz map of constant ''k''/(1−''k''). A direct consequence  of this result yields the proof of the [[inverse function theorem]].
*It can be used to give sufficient conditions under which Newton's method of successive approximations is guaranteed to work, and similarly for Chebyshev's third order method
*It can be used to prove existence and uniqueness of solutions to integral equations

==Converses==
Several converses of the Banach contraction principle exist. The following is due to [[Czesław Bessaga]], from 1959:

Let ''f'' : ''X'' → ''X'' be a map of an abstract [[set (mathematics)|set]] such that each [[iterated function|iterate]] ''f&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' has a unique fixed point. Let ''q'' ∈ (0, 1), then there exists a complete metric on ''X'' such that ''f'' is contractive, and ''q'' is the contraction constant.

Indeed, very weak assumptions suffice to obtain such a kind of converse. For example if ''f'' : ''X'' → ''X'' is a map on a [[T1 space|''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; topological space]] with a unique [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] ''a'', such that for each ''x'' in ''X'' we have ''f&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''(''x'') → ''a'', then there already exists a metric on ''X'' with respect to which ''f'' satisfies the conditions of the Banach contraction principle with contraction constant 1/2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Pascal |last=Hitzler |first2=Anthony K. |last2=Seda |title=A ‘Converse’ of the Banach Contraction Mapping Theorem |journal=Journal of Electrical Engineering |volume=52 |issue=10/s |year=2001 |pages=3–6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case the metric is in fact an [[ultrametric]].

==Generalizations==
There are a number of generalizations (some of which are immediate corollaries).&lt;ref name=Latif2014&gt;{{cite book |first=Abdul |last=Latif |title=Topics in Fixed Point Theory |chapter=Banach Contraction Principle and its Generalizations |chapter-url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-01586-6_2 |publisher=Springer |year=2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Let ''T'' : ''X'' → ''X'' be a map on a complete non-empty metric space. Then, for example, some generalizations of the Banach fixed-point theorem are:
*Assume that some iterate ''T&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' of ''T'' is a contraction. Then ''T'' has a unique fixed point.
*Assume that for each ''n'', there exist ''c&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' such that ''d(T&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;(x), T&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;(y)) ≤ c&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;d(x, y)'' for all ''x'' and ''y'', and that
::&lt;math&gt;\sum\nolimits_n c_n &lt;\infty.&lt;/math&gt;
:Then ''T'' has a unique fixed point.
In applications, the existence and unicity of a fixed point often can be shown directly with the standard Banach fixed point theorem, by a suitable choice of the metric that makes the map ''T'' a contraction. Indeed, the above result by Bessaga strongly suggests to look for such a metric. See also the article on [[fixed point theorems in infinite-dimensional spaces]] for generalizations.

A different class of generalizations arise from suitable generalizations of the notion of [[metric space]], e.g. by weakening the defining axioms for the notion of metric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Pascal |last=Hitzler |first2=Anthony |last2=Seda |title=Mathematical Aspects of Logic Programming Semantics |location= |publisher=Chapman and Hall/CRC |year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these have applications, e.g., in the theory of programming semantics in theoretical computer science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Anthony K. |last=Seda |first2=Pascal |last2=Hitzler |title=Generalized Distance Functions in the Theory of Computation |journal=The Computer Journal |volume=53 |issue=4 |pages=443–464 |year=2010 |doi=10.1093/comjnl/bxm108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Beijing World Park''' ({{zh|s=北京世界公园|t=北京世界公園|p=Běijīng Shìjiè Gōngyuán}}) is a [[theme park]] that attempts to give visitors the chance to see the world without having to leave [[Beijing]]. The park covers 46.7 [[hectares]] and is located in the southwestern [[Fengtai District]] of [[Beijing]]. It is about 17&amp;nbsp;km from [[Tiananmen]], the City center, and 40&amp;nbsp;km from the [[Beijing Capital International Airport|Capital International Airport]]. The park opened in 1993 and is estimated to receive 1.5 million visitors annually.&lt;ref name="china.org.cn"&gt;http://www.china.org.cn/english/travel/126712.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:世界公园4.JPG|thumbnail]]
==The park==
The entrance to the park is made up of a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] castle, Roman corridor, and granite relief sculptures. Immediately inside the gate is an Italian-style terrace garden with grand staircases, fountains, and sculptures inspired by originals from the [[European Renaissance]]. More lawns and gardens are scattered throughout the park. On these lawns are miniature models of around 100 of the world’s most famous statues including the American [[Statue of Liberty]], Copenhagen’s [[The Little Mermaid (statue)|Little Mermaid]], [[David (Michelangelo)|Michelangelo’s David]], and the [[Venus de Milo]].&lt;ref name="china.org.cn" /&gt; Once inside the gates, Beijing World Park consists of two main parts: the scenic portion and the shopping, dining, and entertainment area.

===Scenic area===
The scenic area of the park models itself after the naturalistic layout of the globe, representing the four major oceans, and focusing on five continents: Asia, Africa, Europe, North America, and South America. The park contains about a hundred (109) scaled-down replicas of famous landmarks from nearly 40 countries and regions around the world, including the [[Tower Bridge]] in London, the [[Eiffel Tower]] in Paris, and the [[Giza Necropolis|Great Pyramids in Egypt]]. There is even a miniature [[Manhattan]], complete with twin towers of the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]]. Each landmark represents its country or region of origin and is situated in the park according to its location on the map.

Close attention to detail was paid in modeling these landmarks after their originals. For example, detailed carvings and ornamentations are included. Even the materials used are modeled after their originals to create the most authentic look possible. For example, the replica of the [[Great Pyramids]] was constructed of 200,000 white marble bricks, each as large as a bar of soap. [[Red Square]] in Russia, is replicated by paving the smaller model in World Park with over 5 million red bricks smaller than [[mahjong tiles]].&lt;ref name="en.beijing2008.cn"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.beijing2008.cn/spectators/beijing/tourism/list/n214068433.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012084519/http://en.beijing2008.cn/spectators/beijing/tourism/list/n214068433.shtml |archivedate=2008-10-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the locale-specific areas focused on the five continents also include live entertainment or some kind of an immersive cultural experience such as a dance performance or parade based on customs from their culture of origin.  There is a special garden area in the scenic portion of the park that consists of China's Qingyingjing Park, Japan's [[Katsura Imperial Villa]], and an American-style garden villa. This allows visitors to see global styles of gardening.&lt;ref name="en.beijing2008.cn" /&gt; To get around the park, visitors can travel the four “oceans” by speedboat tour. They can also take a monorail that circumvents the five continents to give tourists a glimpse of the whole “world”. Or they can take a tour of the park in battery-operated cars.

===Shopping, dining, and entertainment area===
The other portion of the park includes the shopping and dining area. This area is modeled after Euro-American architecture. The various establishments allow visitors to purchase souvenirs and sample cuisine from the countries and regions represented in the scenic portion of the park. This second part of the park also includes the entertainment area where grand spectacles and cinema features take place in large theatres to showcase global cultural costume, movement, and customs. Some of these cultural activities include the daily opening ceremonies, which consist of a parade of large-scale floats. There are also culture-specific folklore dances that take place indoors or in open-air arenas. These dances may be performed by Beijing World Park dancers, or they may be performed by troupes representing their local cultures. In 2005 the Park even hosted a Thai elephant that performed four times a day from May to October.&lt;ref name="china.org.cn" /&gt;

==The 2008 Summer Olympics==
During the [[2008 Summer Olympics]], it was selected as one of the three [[Free speech zone|protest zones]].

==''The World''==
''[[The World (film)|The World]]'' is a 2004 film directed by [[Jia Zhangke]], which was made at Beijing World Park and focused on the lives of some fictional park employees.

==Nearby attractions==
The [[Beijing Dabaotai Western Han Dynasty Mausoleum]] is located {{convert|0.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} southeast from the south entrance of the World Park.  The mausoleum hosts the 2,000-year-old tombs of a [[Western Han dynasty]] prince and his wife.

'''Biomimetics''' or '''biomimicry''' is the imitation of the models, systems, and elements of nature for the purpose of solving complex [[human]] problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Vincent|first1=Julian F. V.|title=Biomimetics: its practice and theory|journal=Journal of the Royal Society Interface|volume=3|issue=9|pages=471–482|url=http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/3/9/471|accessdate=7 April 2015|doi=10.1098/rsif.2006.0127|pmid=16849244|pmc=1664643|date=22 August 2006|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms "biomimetics" and "biomimicry" derive from {{lang-grc|βίος}} (''bios''), life, and μίμησις (''[[mimesis|mīmēsis]]''), imitation, from μιμεῖσθαι (''mīmeisthai''), to imitate, from μῖμος (''mimos''), actor. A closely related field is '''[[bionics]]'''.&lt;ref name=McCarty/&gt;

Living organisms have [[evolution|evolved]] [[adaptation (biology)|well-adapted]] structures and materials over geological time through [[natural selection]]. Biomimetics has given rise to new technologies inspired by [[biological]] solutions at macro and nanoscales. Humans have looked at nature for answers to problems throughout our existence. Nature has solved engineering problems such as self-healing abilities, environmental exposure tolerance and resistance, [[hydrophobicity]], self-assembly, and harnessing solar energy.

== History ==

One of the early examples of would-be biomimicry was the study of [[birds]] to enable [[human flight]]. Although never successful in creating a "flying machine", [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452–1519) was a keen observer of the anatomy and flight of birds, and made numerous notes and sketches on his observations as well as sketches of "flying machines".&lt;ref name="Romei 2008 56"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Romei | first=Francesca | title=Leonardo Da Vinci | publisher=The Oliver Press  | year=2008 | location=| page=56 | isbn=978-1-934545-00-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Wright Brothers]], who succeeded in flying the first heavier-than-air aircraft in 1903, allegedly derived inspiration from observations of pigeons in flight.&lt;ref&gt;Compare: {{Cite book | last=Howard | first=Fred | title=Wilbur and Orville: A Biography of the Wright Brothers | publisher=Dober Publications | year=1998 | location=| page=33 | isbn=978-0-486-40297-0 | quote = According to Wilbur, he and his brother discovered the birds' method of lateral control one day while observing a flight of pigeons.

In 1960 [[Jack E. Steele]] coined a similar term, ''[[bionics]]'', at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, where Otto Schmitt also worked. Steele defined bionics as "the science of systems which have some function copied from nature, or which represent characteristics of natural systems or their analogues".&lt;ref name="McCarty"&gt;Mary McCarty.

{{quote|Let us consider what bionics has come to mean operationally and what it or some word like it (I prefer biomimetics) ought to mean in order to make good use of the technical skills of scientists specializing, or rather, I should say, despecializing into this area of research|Otto Herbert Schmitt|In Appreciation, A Lifetime of Connections: Otto Herbert Schmitt, 1913 - 1998}}

In 1969 Schmitt used the term “biomimetic“ in the title one of his papers,&lt;ref&gt;Schmitt O. Third Int. Biophysics Congress. 1969. Some interesting and useful biomimetic transforms. p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1974 it had found its way into [[Webster's Dictionary]], bionics entered the same dictionary earlier in 1960 as "a science concerned with the application of data about the functioning of biological systems to the solution of engineering problems". Bionic took on a different connotation when [[Martin Caidin]] referenced Jack Steele and his work in the novel ''Cyborg'' which later resulted in the 1974 television series ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'' and its spin-offs. The term bionic then became associated with "the use of electronically operated artificial body parts" and "having ordinary human powers increased by or as if by the aid of such devices".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Compact Oxford English Dictionary |year=2008 |publisher= |location= |isbn=978-0-19-953296-4|last1=Soanes |first1=Catherine |last2=Hawker |first2=Sara }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the term ''bionic'' took on the implication of supernatural strength, the scientific community in [[english language|English]] speaking countries largely abandoned it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last =Vincent | first =JFV | title =Biomimetics — a review | journal =Proc.

The term ''biomimicry'' appeared as early as 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Merrill | first=Connie Lange | title=Biomimicry of the Dioxygen Active Site in the Copper Proteins Hemocyanin and Cytochrome Oxidase  | location=Rice University  | year=1982  | accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biomimicry was popularized by scientist and author [[Janine Benyus]] in her 1997 book ''Biomimicry: Innovation Inspired by Nature''. Biomimicry is defined in the book as a "new science that studies nature's models and then imitates or takes inspiration from these designs and processes to solve human problems". Benyus suggests looking to Nature as a "Model, Measure, and Mentor" and emphasizes sustainability as an objective of biomimicry.&lt;ref name="Benyus 1997"&gt;{{cite book |last=Benyus |first=Janine |title=Biomimicry: Innovation Inspired by Nature |year=1997 |publisher=[[William Morrow &amp; Company]] |location=New York, USA |isbn=978-0-688-16099-9 |ref=Benyus97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Structural materials ===
There is a great need for new structural materials that are light weight but offer exceptional combinations of [[stiffness]], strength and [[toughness]].  

Such materials would need to be manufactured into bulk materials with complex shapes at high volume and low cost and would serve a variety of fields such as construction, transportation, energy storage and conversion. In a classic design problem, strength and toughness are more likely to be mutually exclusive i.e., strong materials are brittle and tough materials are weak. However, natural materials with complex and hierarchical material gradients that span from [[Nanoscopic scale|nano]]- to macro-scales are both strong and tough. Generally, most natural materials utilize limited chemical components but complex material architectures that give rise to exceptional mechanical properties. Understanding the highly diverse and multi functional biological materials and discovering approaches to replicate such structures will lead to advanced and more efficient technologies. [[Bone]], [[nacre]] (abalone shell), teeth, the dactyl clubs of stomatopod shrimps and bamboo are great examples of damage tolerant materials.&lt;ref name="materials"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wegst|first=Ulrike G.

In general in biological systems, [[Self-healing|self healing]] occurs via chemical signals released at the site of fracture which initiate a systemic response that transport repairing agents to the fracture site thereby promoting autonomic healing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Youngblood|first=Jeffrey P.|last2=Sottos|first2=Nancy R.|date=August 2008|title=Bioinspired Materials for Self-Cleaning and Self-Healing|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/mrs-bulletin/article/bioinspired-materials-for-selfcleaning-and-selfhealing/29F8CA92E947B59A75AC90BDC783DF60|journal=MRS Bulletin|language=en|volume=33|issue=8|pages=732–741|doi=10.1557/mrs2008.158|issn=1938-1425}}&lt;/ref&gt; To demonstrate the use of micro-vascular networks for autonomic healing, researchers developed a microvascular coating–substrate architecture that mimics human skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Toohey|first=Kathleen S.|last2=Sottos|first2=Nancy R.|last3=Lewis|first3=Jennifer A.|last4=Moore|first4=Jeffrey S.|last5=White|first5=Scott R.|date=2007-06-10|title=Self-healing materials with microvascular networks|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nmat1934|journal=Nature Materials|language=En|volume=6|issue=8|pages=581–585|doi=10.1038/nmat1934|pmid=17558429|issn=1476-1122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bio-inspired self-healing structural color hydrogels that maintain the stability of an inverse opal structure and its resultant structural colors were developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fu|first=Fanfan|last2=Chen|first2=Zhuoyue|last3=Zhao|first3=Ze|last4=Wang|first4=Huan|last5=Shang|first5=Luoran|last6=Gu|first6=Zhongze|last7=Zhao|first7=Yuanjin|date=2017-06-06|title=Bio-inspired self-healing structural color hydrogel|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/114/23/5900|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=114|issue=23|pages=5900–5905|doi=10.1073/pnas.1703616114|issn=0027-8424|pmid=28533368|pmc=5468601}}&lt;/ref&gt; A self-repairing membrane for inspired by rapid self-sealing processes in plants was developed for inflatable light weight structures such as rubber boats or Tensairity® constructions.

=== Adhesion ===

==== Wet adhesion ====
Some amphibians, such as tree and [[Torrent frog|torrent frogs]] and arboreal [[Salamander|salamanders]], are able to attach to and move over wet or even flooded environments without falling. This kind of organisms have toe pads which are permanently wetted by mucus secreted from glands that open into the channels between epidermal cells. They attach to mating surfaces by wet adhesion and they are capable of climbing on wet rocks even when water is flowing over the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bhushan|first=Bharat|date=2009-04-28|title=Biomimetics: lessons from nature–an overview|url=http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/367/1893/1445|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|language=en|volume=367|issue=1893|pages=1445–1486|doi=10.1098/rsta.2009.0011|issn=1364-503X|pmid=19324719}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tire]] treads have also been inspired by the toe pads of [[Tree frog|tree frogs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://iopscience.iop.org/0953-8984/19/37/376110 Tire treads inspired by tree frogs]&lt;/ref&gt;

Marine [[Mussel|mussels]] can stick easily and efficiently to surfaces underwater under the harsh conditions of the ocean. Mussels use strong filaments to adhere to rocks in the inter-tidal zones of wave-swept beaches, preventing them from being swept away in strong sea currents. Mussel foot proteins attach the filaments to rocks, boats and practically any surface in nature including other mussels. These proteins contain a mix of [[amino acid]] residues which has been adapted specifically for [[adhesive]] purposes. Researchers from the University of California Santa Barbara borrowed and simplified chemistries that the mussel foot uses to overcome this engineering challenge of wet adhesion to create copolyampholytes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seo|first=Sungbaek|last2=Das|first2=Saurabh|last3=Zalicki|first3=Piotr J.|last4=Mirshafian|first4=Razieh|last5=Eisenbach|first5=Claus D.|last6=Israelachvili|first6=Jacob N.|last7=Waite|first7=J.

Other research has proposed adhesive glue from [[Mussel|mussels]].

==== Dry adhesion ====
Leg attachment pads of several animals, including many insects (e.g. [[Beetle|beetles]] and [[Fly|flies]]), [[Spider|spiders]] and [[Lizard|lizards]] (e.g. [[Gecko|geckos]]), are capable of attaching to a variety of surfaces and are used for locomotion, even on vertical walls or across ceilings. Attachment systems in these organisms have similar structures at their terminal elements of contact, known as [[Seta|setae]]. Such biological examples have offered inspiration in order to produce climbing robots,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newscientisttech.com/channel/tech/mg19025526.500.html Gecko-like robot scampers up the wall – tech – 23 May 2006 – New Scientist Tech]&lt;/ref&gt; boots and tape&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/mota/education/Physics%2087N%20Final%20Projects/Group%20Gamma/gecko.htm|title=Gecko Tape|publisher=[[Stanford University]]|accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; . [[Synthetic setae]] have also been developed for the production of dry adhesives.

=== Optics ===
{{Further|Structural coloration|Patterns in nature|Bio-inspired photonics}}

[[Biomimetic material]]s are gaining increasing attention in the field of [[optics]] and [[photonics]]. There are still little known [[Bio-inspired photonics|bioinspired or biomimetic products]] involving the photonic properties of plants or animals. However, understanding how nature designed such optical materials from biological resources is worth pursuing and might lead to future commercial products.

==== Inspiration from fruits and plants ====
For instance, the chiral [[self-assembly]] of cellulose inspired by the [[Pollia condensata|''Pollia condensata'']] berry has been exploited to make optically active films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vignolini|first=Silvia|last2=Rudall|first2=Paula J.|last3=Rowland|first3=Alice V.|last4=Reed|first4=Alison|last5=Moyroud|first5=Edwige|last6=Faden|first6=Robert B.|last7=Baumberg|first7=Jeremy J.|last8=Glover|first8=Beverley J.|last9=Steiner|first9=Ullrich|date=2012-09-25|title=Pointillist structural color in Pollia fruit|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/109/39/15712|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=109|issue=39|pages=15712–15715|doi=10.1073/pnas.1210105109|issn=0027-8424|pmc=3465391|pmid=23019355}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dumanli|first1=A.

Most [[virus]]es have an outer capsule 20 to 300&amp;nbsp;nm in diameter. Virus capsules are remarkably robust and capable of withstanding temperatures as high as 60&amp;nbsp;°C; they are stable across the [[pH]] range 2-10.&lt;ref name="Tong" /&gt; Viral capsules can be used to create nano device components such as nanowires, nanotubes, and quantum dots. Tubular virus particles such as the [[tobacco mosaic virus]] (TMV) can be used as templates to create nanofibers and nanotubes, since both the inner and outer layers of the virus are charged surfaces which can induce nucleation of crystal growth.

"Advanced Materials" 1999. 11:253.&lt;/ref&gt;  A spherical plant virus called [[cowpea chlorotic mottle virus]] (CCMV) has interesting expanding properties when exposed to environments of pH higher than 6.5.  Above this pH, 60 independent pores with diameters about 2&amp;nbsp;nm begin to exchange substance with the environment.  The structural transition of the viral capsid can be utilized in [[Biomineralization|Biomorphic mineralization]] for selective uptake and deposition of minerals by controlling the solution pH.  Possible applications include using the viral cage to produce uniformly shaped and sized quantum dot [[semiconductor]] nanoparticles through a series of pH washes.  This is an alternative to the [[Ferritin|apoferritin]] cage technique currently used to synthesize uniform CdSe nanoparticles.&lt;ref&gt;Ischiro Yamashita, Junko Hayashi, Mashahiko Hara. "Bio-template Synthesis of Uniform CdSe Nanoparticles Using Cage-shaped Protein, Apoferritin." Chemistry Letters (2004). Volume: 33, Issue: 9. 1158–1159.&lt;/ref&gt; Such materials could also be used for targeted drug delivery since particles release contents upon exposure to specific pH levels.

[[File:Brawling, 喧嘩, PA160113aaa.jpg|thumb|280px|right|The [[yakuza]]'s fight by festival of Japan]]

'''Brawling''' (probably connected with German language ''brüllen'', to roar, shout), in law, was the offence of quarrelling, or creating a disturbance in a [[church (building)|church]] or churchyard. Brawling was covered in [[Ecclesiastical court|ecclesiastic courts]] until 1860. It has rarely been prosecuted since then.

==History==
During the early stages of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in England religious controversy too often became converted into actual disturbance, and the ritual lawlessness of the [[Wikt:parochial|parochial]] [[clergy]] very frequently provoked popular violence. To repress these disturbances the [[Brawling Act 1551]] was passed in 1551, by which it was enacted: "that if any person shall, by words only, quarrel, chide or brawl in any church or churchyard, it shall be lawful for the ordinary of the place where the same shall be done and proved by two lawful witnesses, to suspend any person so offending, if he be a layman, from the entrance of the church, and if he be a clerk, from the ministration of his office, for so long as the said ordinary shall think meet, according to the fault."&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Brawling |volume=4 |page=437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Act of 1553 added the punishment of imprisonment until the party should repent. The Brawling Act 1551 was partly repealed in 1828 and wholly repealed as regards laymen by the [[Ecclesiastical Courts Jurisdiction Act 1860]]. Under that Act, which applies to [[Ireland]] as well as to England, persons guilty of riotous, violent or indecent behaviour, in churches and chapels of the Church of England or Ireland, or in any chapel of any religious denomination, or in England in any place of religious worship duly certified, or in churchyards or burial-grounds, were liable on conviction before two justices to a penalty of not more than £5, or imprisonment for any term not exceeding two months. This enactment applied to clergy as well as to laity, and a clergyman of the Church of England convicted under it could also be dealt with under the [[Clergy Discipline Act 1892]] (''Girt v. Fillingham'', 1901, L.R. Prob. 176).&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

When Mr [[John Kensit|J. Kensit]] during an ordination service in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] "objected" to one of the candidates for ordination, on grounds which did not constitute an impediment or notable crime within the meaning of the ordination service, he was held to have unlawfully disturbed the [[bishop]] of [[London]] in the conduct of the service, and to be liable to conviction under the Act of 1860 (''Kensit'' v. ''Dean and Chapter of St Paul's'', 1905, L.R. 2 K.B. 249). The public worship of [[Protestant]] Dissenters, [[Roman Catholic]]s and [[Jews]] in England had before 1860 been protected by a series of statutes beginning with the [[Act of Toleration 1689|Toleration Act]] of 1689, and ending with the [[Liberty of Religious Worship Act 1855]]. These enactments, though not repealed, were for practical purposes superseded by the summary remedy given by the Act of 1860. In Scotland disturbance of public worship is punishable as a [[breach of the peace]] (''Dougall'' v. ''Dykes'', 1861, 4 Irvine 101).&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

===In the British Empire===
In British possessions abroad, interference with religious worship was usually dealt with by legislation, and not as a common-law offence. In [[India]] it was an offence voluntarily to cause disturbance to any assembly lawfully engaged in the performance of religious worship or religious ceremonies (Penal Code, s. 296). Under the [[Queensland Criminal Code]] of 1899 (s. 207) penalties were imposed on persons who wilfully and without lawful justification or excuse (the proof of which lies on them) disquiet or disturb any meeting of persons lawfully assembled for religious worship, or assault any forces lawfully officiating at such meeting, or any of the persons there assembled.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

===In the United States===
In the United States disturbance of religious worship is treated as an offence under the [[common law]], which is in many states supplemented by legislation (see Bishop, ''Amer. Crim. Law,'' 8th ed. 1892, vol. i. s. 542, vol. ii. ss. 303-305; California Penal Code, s. 302; ''Revised Laws of Massachusetts'', 1902, chap. 212, s. 30.).&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

==Modern case==
In 1998, [[Peter Tatchell]] of [[OutRage!]] was prosecuted for interrupting the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]'s Easter sermon with a short gay rights speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.petertatchell.net/religion/easter%20sunday.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924202506/http://www.petertatchell.net/religion/easter%20sunday.htm |archivedate=2009-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1860 legislation (which transferred jurisdiction away from the ecclesiastic courts) was used to try him; his defense focused on the [[Human Rights Act 1998]]. He was convicted and fined £18.60 (referring to the 1860 legislation) plus court costs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15129">'''Climate Change Education''' (CCE) is learning geared toward helping people address and develop effective responses to [[climate change]]. It helps learners understand the causes and consequences of climate change, prepares them to live with the impacts of climate change and empowers learners to take appropriate actions to adopt more sustainable lifestyles.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002330/233083e.pdf|title=Not Just Hot Air: Putting Climate Change Education into Practice|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100101-7|location=|pages=6, 8, 10, 32, 40, 44, 46, 48, 58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CCE helps policy-makers understand the urgency and importance of putting mechanisms into place to combat climate change on a national and global scale. Communities learn about how climate change will affect them, what they can do to protect themselves from negative consequences, and how they can reduce their own [[climate footprint]]. In particular, CCE helps increase the resilience of already vulnerable communities who are the most likely to be adversely affected by climate change.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

CCE is rooted in [[Education for sustainable development|Education for Sustainable Development]] (ESD).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== UNESCO Climate Change Education for Sustainable Development programme ==
Established in 2010, the [[UNESCO]] Climate Change Education for Sustainable Development programme (CCESD) aims to help people understand climate change by expanding CCE activities in [[Nonformal learning|nonformal education]] through the media, networking and partnerships. It is grounded in the holistic approach of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) which incorporates key sustainable development issues such as climate change, [[disaster risk reduction]] and others into education, in a way that addresses the interdependence of environmental sustainability, economic viability and social justice. It promotes participatory teaching and learning methods that motivate and empower learners to change their behaviour and take action for sustainable development. The programme seeks to help people understand the impact of global warming today and increase ‘climate literacy’, especially among young people, and aims to make education a more central part of the international response to climate change. UNESCO works with national governments to integrate CCE into national [[Curriculum|curricula]] and to develop innovative teaching and learning approaches for doing so.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Selected country profiles regarding CCE and ESD ==

=== Australia ===
Australia has been at the forefront of [[Education for sustainable development|education for sustainability]], adopting in 2000 a national plan entitled Environmental Education for a Sustainable Future. A number of initiatives and bodies were created to implement the national plan, including the Australian Sustainable Schools Initiative and [[Australian Research Institute for Environment and Sustainability]]. These provided a strong foundation for Australia’s strategy, launched in 2006, to respond to the [[Education for sustainable development#United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development .28DESD.29|UN Decade of Education for Sustainable Development]]. The strategy set out the goal to mainstream sustainability through a holistic approach that engages the community through education and [[lifelong learning]]. Whereas climate change was referred to as one of a number of environmental concerns in the first national plan, a new plan launched in 2009, entitled Living Sustainably: the Australian Government’s National Action Plan for Education for Sustainability, had a greater focus on climate change and its impacts on other natural resources within a wider global context. The new plan incorporated climate change within education for sustainability, rather than establishing a new and potentially competing field of Climate Change Education. Australia introduced its first-ever national curriculum in 2014, including sustainability as one of three cross-curriculum subjects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Since 2009, Climate Change Education has been most evident in the [[TVET (Technical and Vocational Education and Training)|VET sector]]. [[Council of Australian Governments|COAG]] endorsed the Green Skills Agreement in 2009, and the Ministerial Council for Vocational and Technical Education published the National VET Sector Sustainability Policy and Action Plan (2009-2012). These initiatives aimed to provide workers with the skills needed to transition to a low-carbon economy and VET teachers with suitable training packages to promote education for sustainability.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== China ===
China introduced [[environmental education]] in the late 1970s as a result of increased attention to sustainable development and the need to protect the environment. Following the [[Earth Summit|United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] (Rio de Janeiro, 1992), environmental education moved towards environment, population and development, and finally education for sustainable development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Chinese government has produced a number of policy documents identifying environmental education and ESD as key to quality education. In 2003, the Ministry of Education issued the first guiding policy - the Guidelines for Implementing Environmental Education in Elementary and Secondary School - on environmental education in China. ESD was formally incorporated into the national education policy in 2010 in The National Education Outline 2010-2020, and further integrated in some local education policies. National climate change policies and plans in China refer to education but do not specifically address CCE. This has resulted in limited institutional support to date. There is no national ESD or CCE action plan or official policy to inform its implementation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In China, ESD mainly refers to providing individuals with the scientific knowledge, learning capacity, values and lifestyle choices to meet the country’s sustainable development objectives. CCE is most commonly implemented as a component of ESD. A number of educational approaches have been adopted to facilitate the implementation of ESD. These include integrating ESD values into school philosophy, [[curriculum development]], capacity-building of teachers and educators, ESD pedagogical approaches and ESD and CCE thematic activities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

ESD is a component of compulsory education, but is limited in higher education, VET and adult education. The Ministry of Education has recently issued a guidance document that identified the VET sector in particular as needing to be reformed to meet the sustainable development objectives of the Chinese economy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Denmark ===
Denmark and its neighbouring countries began working together in the 1990s to formulate a policy for ESD. While Denmark signed the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]] (UNECE) declaration on ESD in 2005, it did not adopt a strategy until 2009, just before the half-way point of the DESD. The Ministry of Education, which was made responsible for the DESD, organised a consultation process on how to promote ESD before adopting its strategy in 2009.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The UN Climate Summit (COP15) held in Denmark in December 2009 provided the impetus to develop of a number of national ESD policy initiatives. A national strategy on ESD was developed with a substantial climate change component. The aim of the strategy is to make citizens more responsible for their actions by improving their scientific knowledge. The ESD strategy notes that climate change should not be the sole focus of ESD, though the concrete initiatives that are part of the strategy mostly support the CCE projects and activities that were part of COP15 preparations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A new national school curriculum adopted in 2009 included elements of ESD and CCE. The concept of sustainability was embedded in the goals describing the interrelationships between nature and society. CCE is mostly approached as teaching climate science, but it was also included in subjects such as geography and social studies, where the interrelationships between human behaviour, consumption and climate are examined.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There has been no explicit policy change in the TVET sector to upgrade skills to respond to climate change and environmental issues. However, it is important to note that the Danish TVET sector had previously reflected skills related to ecological modernisation in areas such as energy generation, [[waste management]] and agriculture. While the new government identified the economic and environmental climate change crises as important, education is only referred to in relation to the economic crisis. There is no mention of climate change or sustainability with regard to education, and the platform documentation on ‘green transition’ does not mention education. Overall, no policy strategy has been set to promote ESD, CCE, or the ‘greening’ of TVET as part of the government’s sustainable development and climate change policies. Government initiatives support NGO-led projects to raise community awareness of climate change. A national network on ESD was established with funding through to 2013.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Dominican Republic ===
The Dominican Republic has taken a lead role in promoting ESD. Environmental education was made mandatory for all schools in 1998 and this has since evolved into ESD. In 2000, the General Law of Environment and Natural Resources changed the way environmental education was taught, moving from a subject matter to a cross-cutting and interdisciplinary theme. Risk management is also an important aspect of MINERD’s strategic plan, and has been integrated into the school curriculum as a cross-cutting subject. In 2004, the Environmental Education Strategy for Sustainable Development was adopted, which fosters formal and non-formal ESD. It is based on constructivism and uses a variety of pedagogical techniques that promote participatory learning.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Ten-year 2008-2018 Education Plan (PDE) addresses the issue of quality education, including sustainable development and a culture of peace. It also established a process for periodic review of the curriculum. Climate change is also being introduced into the curriculum. The National Teacher Training Institute (INAFOCAM) and the Salomé Ureña Higher Institute for Teacher Training (ISFODOSU) provide support for environmental education through teacher training and curriculum support. The Ten-year 2008-2018 Higher Education Plan (PDES) includes environmental issues in the curricula and establishes a research programme to promote sustainable development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Dominican Republic has been involved in a number of ESD and CCE initiatives that have helped build local capacity, including:
* formal, non-formal and informal projects on ESD led by governmental agencies, civil society organizations, young leaders and local communities;
* UN: CC Learn Project, which supports the design and implementation of results-oriented and sustainable learning to address climate change (see the detailed case study in this Report);
* National Strategy to Strengthen Human Resource Capacities to Advance Green, Low Emission and Climate Resilient Development (ENDVBERC);
* teacher training supported by the UN: CC Learn-UNITAR, and the UNESCO-CCESD pilot programme.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== England ===
Environmental and development education have been present in England since the 1970s, when civil society organizations took the lead. From the late 1990s, the UK government promoted sustainable development and ESD at the local, regional and national levels. However, while a number of strategic government reports addressed CCE, government policy has focused less on ESD since 2010.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The 2008 report Brighter Futures – Greener Lives: Sustainable Development Action Plan 2008-2010 outlined a number of specific initiatives related to Climate Change Education using an ESD approach. This included empowering youth with the skills, knowledge and freedom to voice their opinions and make a difference. The same year, CCE was introduced into the Key Stage Three (11 to 14 year-olds) geography curriculum.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The report Education for Sustainable Development in the UK 2010 noted that there were signs of substantial progress in embedding ESD-related policies and developing practices in the UK across a wide range of sectors in 2008 and 2009. For example, documents in 2009 highlighted the ‘Sustainable Schools’ project that aims to empower youth to cope with the future challenges facing the planet. The aim is for all schools to be ‘Sustainable Schools’ by 2020.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Republic of Korea ===
The Republic of Korea has a number of policies and initiatives supporting environmental education. In 2008, the Environmental Education Promotion Act encouraged the development of environmental education. It aimed to raise national environmental awareness, to encourage people to develop research and inquiry skills, and to put what they learn into action.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Ministry of Environment, in its 2011-2015 Environmental Education Master Plan, proposed a policy agenda for environmental education to be implemented through formal education, social environmental education and educational infrastructure approaches. The various approaches in the formal education area include:
* ‘Environment and Green Growth’ as an elective subject in middle and high school curricula, and classes in elementary school designed to integrate environmental education; 
* the establishment of the Natural Environmental Studies Institute that o ers interactive youth programmes for environmental studies;
* Environment Model Schools, designed to demonstrate best-practice;
* ‘Low Carbon Challenge’ involving ten universities;
* in-service training for teachers to upskill, specializing in environmental education.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [[punch line]] of a [[joke]] is an analogy for the climax of a fictional narrative, though the absence of any [[falling action]] is an essential difference, which may reflect the nature of [[humor]] as opposed to the nature of [[drama]].

In non-fictional narrative [[genre]]s, even though the author does not have the same freedom to control the action and "plot" as in works of fiction, the selection of subject matter, degree of detail, and emphasis permit an author to create similar structures, i.e., to construct a dramatization.

In the play ''[[Hippolytus (play)|Hippolytus]]'', by the famous Greek playwright, [[Euripides]], the climax arrives when Phaedra hears Hippolytus react badly because of her love for him. That is the moment that [[Aphrodite]]'s curse is finally fulfilled, and it is the turning point of the play.

== {{anchor|Anti-climax}} Anticlimax ==
An anticlimax is a situation in a plot in which something which would appear to be difficult to solve is solved through something trivial. For example, destroying a heavily guarded facility would require advanced technology, teamwork, and weaponry for a climax, but for an anticlimax, it may just require pushing a red button which reads, "Emergency Self-Destruct", or simply filling out an eviction notice and destroying the building. A famous example is the ending of ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'', where amidst the chaos of the extraterrestrial takeover of planet [[Earth]], the aliens are defeated by the most unexpected organism: the common cold virus. Another example could involve the protagonist faced with insurmountable odds and ultimately being killed without accomplishing his goal, despite what appears to be a turning point for the character.

In the [[mathematical]] fields of [[geometry]] and [[topology]], a '''coarse structure''' on a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''X'' is a collection of [[subset]]s of the [[cartesian product]] ''X'' × ''X'' with certain properties which allow the ''large-scale structure'' of [[metric space]]s and [[topological space]]s to be defined.

The concern of traditional geometry and topology is with the small-scale structure of the space: properties such as the [[continuous function|continuity]] of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] depend on whether the [[image (mathematics)|inverse image]]s of small [[open set]]s, or [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighborhoods]], are themselves open. Large-scale properties of a space&amp;mdash;such as [[bounded set|boundedness]], or the [[degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]] of the space&amp;mdash;do not depend on such features. ''Coarse geometry'' and ''coarse topology'' provide tools for measuring the large-scale properties of a space, and just as a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] or a [[topology]] contains information on the small-scale structure of a space, a coarse structure contains information on its large-scale properties.

Properly, a coarse structure is not the large-scale analog of a topological structure, but of a [[Uniform space|uniform structure]].

==Definition==

A '''coarse structure''' on a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''X'' is a collection '''E''' of [[subset]]s of ''X'' × ''X'' (therefore falling under the more general categorization of [[binary relation]]s on ''X'') called ''controlled sets'', and so that '''E''' possesses the [[identity relation]], is closed under taking subsets, inverses, and finite unions, and is closed under [[composition of relations]]. Explicitly:

;1. Identity/diagonal: The [[diagonal]] Δ = {(''x'', ''x'') : ''x'' in ''X''} is a member of '''E'''&amp;mdash;the identity relation.
;2. Closed under taking subsets: If ''E'' is a member of '''E''' and ''F'' is a subset of ''E'', then ''F'' is a member of '''E'''.
;3. Closed under taking inverses: If ''E'' is a member of '''E''' then the '''inverse''' (or '''transpose''') ''E'' &lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; = {(''y'', ''x'') : (''x'', ''y'') in ''E''} is a member of '''E'''&amp;mdash;the inverse relation.
;4. Closed under taking unions: If ''E'' and ''F'' are members of '''E''' then the '''[[union (set theory)|union]]''' of ''E'' and ''F'' is a member of '''E'''.
;5. Closed under composition: If ''E'' and ''F'' are members of '''E''' then the '''product''' ''E'' &lt;/small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; ''F'' = {(''x'', ''y'') : there is a ''z'' in ''X'' such that (''x'', ''z'') is in ''E'', (''z'', ''y'') is in ''F''} is a member of '''E'''&amp;mdash;the composition of relations.

A set ''X'' endowed with a coarse structure '''E''' is a ''coarse space''.

The set ''E''[''K''] is defined as {''x'' in ''X'' : there is a ''y'' in ''K'' such that (''x'', ''y'') is in ''E''}. We define the ''section'' of ''E'' by ''x'' to be the set ''E''[{''x''}], also denoted ''E'' &lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;. The symbol ''E''&lt;sup&gt;''y''&lt;/sup&gt; denotes the set ''E'' &lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;[{''y''}]. These are forms of [[Projection (relational algebra)|projections]].

== Intuition ==
The controlled sets are "small" sets, or "[[negligible set]]s": a set ''A'' such that ''A'' &amp;times; ''A'' is controlled is negligible, while a function ''f'' : ''X'' → ''X'' such that its graph is controlled is "close" to the identity. In the bounded coarse structure, these sets are the bounded sets, and the functions are the ones that are a finite distance from the identity in the [[uniform metric]].

==Examples==

* The ''bounded coarse structure'' on a [[metric space]] (''X'', ''d'') is the collection '''E''' of all [[subsets]] ''E'' of ''X'' × ''X'' such that sup{''d''(''x'', ''y'') : (''x'', ''y'') is in ''E''} is [[finite set|finite]].
*:With this structure, the [[integer lattice]] '''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is coarsely equivalent to ''n''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]].
* A space ''X'' where ''X'' &amp;times; ''X'' is controlled is called a '''bounded space.''' Such a space is coarsely equivalent to a point. A metric space with the bounded coarse structure is bounded (as a coarse space) if and only if it is bounded (as a metric space).
* The trivial coarse structure only consists of the diagonal and its subsets.
*:In this structure, a map is a coarse equivalence if and only if it is a bijection (of sets).
* The ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ''coarse structure'' on a metric space ''X'' is the collection of all subsets ''E'' of ''X'' × ''X'' such that for all ε &gt; 0 there is a [[compact space|compact]] set ''K'' of ''X'' such that ''d''(''x'', ''y'') &lt; ε for all (''x'', ''y'') in ''E'' &amp;minus; ''K'' × ''K''. Alternatively, the collection of all subsets ''E'' of ''X'' × ''X'' such that {(''x'', ''y'') in ''E'' : ''d''(''x'', ''y'') ≥ ε} is compact.
* The ''discrete coarse structure'' on a set ''X'' consists of the [[diagonal]] together with subsets ''E'' of ''X'' × ''X'' which contain only a finite number of points (''x'', ''y'') off the diagonal.
* If ''X'' is a [[topological space]] then the ''indiscrete coarse structure'' on ''X'' consists of all ''proper'' subsets of ''X'' × ''X'', meaning all subsets ''E'' such that ''E'' [''K''] and ''E'' &lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;[''K''] are [[relatively compact subspace|relatively compact]] whenever ''K'' is relatively compact.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2781">In [[electronics]], ''' The common mode rejection ratio''' ('''CMRR''') of a [[differential amplifier]] (or other device) is a [[wiktionary:metric#Noun|metric]] used to quantify the ability of the device to reject common-mode signals, i.e., those that appear simultaneously and in-phase on both inputs. An ideal differential amplifier would have infinite CMRR, however this is not achievable in practice. A high CMRR is required when a differential signal must be amplified in the presence of a possibly large common-mode input, such as strong [[electromagnetic interference]] (EMI). An example is audio transmission over [[balanced line]] in [[sound reinforcement]] or [[sound recording|recording]].

== Theory ==

Ideally, a differential amplifier takes the voltages, &lt;math&gt;V_+&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_-&lt;/math&gt; on its two inputs and produces an output voltage &lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{o}=A_\mathrm{d}(V_+ - V_-)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;A_\mathrm{d}&lt;/math&gt; is the differential gain. However, the output of a real differential amplifier is better described as
:&lt;math&gt;V_{\mathrm{o}} = A_\mathrm{d} (V_+ - V_-) + \tfrac{1}{2} A_\mathrm{cm} (V_+ + V_-)&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;A_\mathrm{cm}&lt;/math&gt; is the common-"mode gain", which is typically much smaller than the [[differential gain]].

The CMRR is defined as the ratio of the [[Power (physics)|powers]] of the differential gain over the common-mode gain, measured in positive [[decibel]]s (thus using the [[20 log rule]]):
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{CMRR} = \left (\frac{A_\mathrm{d}}{|A_\mathrm{cm}|} \right) = 10\log_{10} \left (\frac{A_\mathrm{d}}{A_\mathrm{cm}} \right)^2 \text{dB} = 20\log_{10} \left (\frac{A_\mathrm{d}}{|A_\mathrm{cm}|} \right) \text{dB}&lt;/math&gt;

As differential gain should exceed common-mode gain, this will be a positive number, and the higher the better.

The CMRR is a very important specification, as it indicates how much of the [[common-mode signal]] will appear in your measurement. The value of the CMRR often depends on signal [[frequency]] as well, and must be specified as a [[function (mathematics)|function]] thereof.

It is often important in reducing noise on transmission lines.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} For example, when measuring the resistance of a [[thermocouple]] in a noisy environment, the [[signal noise|noise]] from the environment appears as an offset on both input leads, making it a common-mode [[voltage]] signal. The CMRR of the measurement instrument determines the [[attenuation]] applied to the offset or noise.

'''Community reinforcement approach and family training''' ('''CRAFT''') is a [[behavior therapy]] approach for treating [[addiction]]. The original '''community reinforcement approach''' ('''CRA'''), developed by Nate Azrin in the 1970s, uses [[operant conditioning]] to help people learn to reduce the power of their addictions and enjoy healthy living. CRAFT combines CRA with family training, which equips families and friends with supportive techniques to encourage their loved ones to begin and continue treatment, and provides defenses against addiction's damaging effects on loved ones.

The ''community reinforcement approach'' (CRA) was "originally developed for individuals with alcohol use disorders, [but] has been successfully employed to treat a variety of [[substance use disorders]] for more than 35 years. Based on [[operant conditioning]] [a type of learning], CRA helps people rearrange their lifestyles so that healthy, drug-free living becomes rewarding and thereby competes with alcohol and drug use."&lt;ref name="MeyersRoozenSmith2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Meyers |first=Robert J. |last2=Roozen |first2=Hendrik G. |last3=Smith |first3=Jane Ellen |year=2011 |title=The Community Reinforcement Approach: An Update of the Evidence |url=http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh334/toc33_4.htm |journal=Alcohol Research &amp; Health |publisher=National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism |volume=33 |issue=4 |accessdate=January 20, 2014}}p. 380&lt;/ref&gt;

''Community reinforcement and family training'' (CRAFT) is CRA that "works through family members."&lt;ref name="MeyersRoozenSmith2011" /&gt; It "is designed to increase the odds of the substance user who is refusing treatment to enter treatment, as well as improve the lives of the concerned family members.&lt;ref name="MeyersRoozenSmith2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CRAANDCRAFTJBAHSFM" /&gt; CRAFT "teaches the use of healthy rewards to encourage positive behaviors.

''[[Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach]]'' (A-CRA) is CRA that "targets adolescents with substance use problems and their caregivers."&lt;ref name="MeyersRoozenSmith2011" /&gt;

== Description ==

CRAFT is a [[motivation]]al model of [[family therapy]].&lt;ref name="FooteManuel2009"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Foote |first=Jeff |last2=Manuel |first2=Jennifer K. |year=2009 |title=Adapting the CRAFT approach for use in group therapy |journal=Journal of Behavior Analysis in Health, Sports, Fitness and Medicine |volume=2 |issue=1 |doi=10.1037/h0100378|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is reward-based&lt;ref name="FooteManuel2009" /&gt;—that is, based on positive reinforcement. CRAFT is aimed at the families and friends of treatment-refusing individuals who have a substance abuse problem.&lt;ref name="FooteManuel2009" /&gt; "CRAFT works to [[wiktionary:affect#Verb|affect]] [influence] the substance users’ behavior by changing the way the family interacts with them."&lt;ref name="FooteManuel2009" /&gt;

In the model, the following terms are used:

* ''Identified Patient'' (IP)&amp;nbsp;– the individual with the substance abuse problem who is refusing treatment, and
* ''Concerned Significant Others'' (CSOs)&amp;nbsp;– the relevant family members and friends of the IP.&lt;ref name="FooteManuel2009" /&gt;

"CRAFT grew out of the understanding that although individuals who truly need help with substance use problems often are strongly opposed to treatment. On the other hand, the concerned significant others (CSOs) of the substance abuser are commonly highly motivated to get help for them."&lt;ref name="CRAANDCRAFTJBAHSFM" /&gt;

=== Three goals ===

When a loved one is abusing substances and refusing to get help, CRAFT is designed to help families learn practical and effective ways to accomplish these three goals:

# Move their loved one toward treatment,
# Reduce their loved one’s alcohol and drug use, and
# Simultaneously improve their own lives.&lt;ref name="FooteManuel2009" /&gt;

=== Comparisons ===

One experiment compared CRAFT with Al-Anon and Nar-Anon facilitation therapies for their impacts on addicts to enter treatment. The finding was that concerned significant others who participated in Al-Anon and Nar-Anon facilitation therapy engaged 29.0% of addicts into treatment, whereas those who went through CRAFT engaged 67.2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Meyers | first=Robert J. | last2=Miller | first2=William R. | last3=Smith | first3=Jane Ellen | last4=Tonigan | first4=J.

The study found that all of these approaches were associated with similar improvements in the functioning of concerned significant others and improvements in their relationship quality with the addicts. However, the CRAFT approach was more effective in engaging initially unmotivated problem drinkers in treatment (64%) as compared with the Al-Anon (13%) and Johnson interventions (30%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Miller | first=William R. | last2=Meyers | first2=Robert J. | last3=Tonigan | first3=J.

=== Family influence ===

Robert J. Meyers, PhD wrote about the influence that concerned family members have in treatment of the substance user, and the benefits for themselves:
{{ quote
|The Community Reinforcement Approach and Family Training (CRAFT) intervention ... method was developed with the belief that since family members can, and do make important contribution[s] in other areas of addiction treatment (i.e. family and couples therapy), that the CSO can play a powerful role in helping to engage the substance user who is in denial to submit to treatment. In addition, it is often the substance user who reports that family pressure or influence is the reason [they] sought treatment. Also, CSOs who attend the CRAFT program also benefit by becoming more independent and reducing their depression, anxiety and anger symptoms even if their loved one does not enter treatment.&lt;ref name="MeyersWebCRAFT"&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.robertjmeyersphd.com/craft.html | title = CRAFT | publisher = Robert J.

Studies in the 1960s clearly demonstrated that even chronically dependent drinkers with access to alcohol could regulate their drinking given sufficient incentives to do so, at least under controlled laboratory conditions (Heather &amp; Robertson, 1983).&lt;ref name="MINT_Miller98" /&gt;

|Interviewer: "So, if you can, explain [to] us a little bit about how the CRAFT technique works. What's it all about?"

Dr. Bob Meyers: "Well, the CRAFT technique is a process. We bring in a family member, and what we do is we teach them how to interact differently with the drinker or the drug user. Instead of yelling and screaming when they're using drugs, we tell them to kind of just stay away from them, leave that person alone. But, then when they're sober—when they're not using drugs—we talk to them ... to tell them how much you love them, how much you care about them, how important they are to the family, and we try to help them pick their spots: when do you talk to them, when do you stay away from them.

"So, it takes a little bit of time, but we've been very successful here, being funded by the [[National Institutes of Health]] through the [[University of New Mexico]] to run a couple of scientific studies, where we've actually proven that my CRAFT intervention is much more powerful than anything that is used out there currently."&lt;ref name="KRQE120"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Dr. Bob Meyers, PhD: "CRAFT Technique" Creator&lt;!-- and unknown interviewer--&gt; |year=2007 |title=Craft Video Clip |medium=video |url=http://www.robertjmeyersphd.com/videos/krqe.wmv |accessdate=January 23, 2014 |format=wmv (Windows Media Video) |location=[[Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]] |publisher=KRQE News |website=krqe.com}} Time: 1:20 to 2:09&lt;/ref&gt;

With CRAFT, families/friends (CSOs) are trained in various strategies, including positive reinforcement, various communication skills, and natural consequences.

# Accept Partial Responsibility&amp;nbsp;– This step "is really designed to decrease defensiveness on the part of your loved one. ...

# Offer to Help

|Dr. Nicole Kosanke: "Of course, all of us get to the point of frustration, ... it's pretty hard not to if you're dealing with a situation like this with your child. So, at times, yes, you're going to be frustrated and put your hands up. But, as a general rule, staying engaged and managing your feelings, asking people for help, asking people to give feedback directly to [your child]—all of that communicates a sense of engagement, rather than detaching. And, it also communicates a sense of love and caring for your child, which ultimately&amp;nbsp;— even when you're detaching&amp;nbsp;— that's what you have inside, and that's a real ingredient for helping impact someone [to] change."

Dr. Josh King: "I would say this [engagement] is almost the opposite of detaching. ... [Detachment] is either you can give them the feedback or not [as if] the best thing you can do is step away, which I don't agree with. I think when you step away, you have no impact on the ability to make change."

Dr. Nicole Kosanke: "In [the example] situation, you're also inviting the community to have an impact on your child. CRAFT stands for '''Community'' Reinforcement and Family Training.'

Al-Anon does not currently adopt, hold, or promote the view that concerned significant others (CSOs) can, with any certainty, make a positive, direct, and active contribution to arrest compulsive drinking. However, Al-Anon says that by CSOs improving their own attitudes, and offering support and encouragement to the user, the "family situation is bound to improve." On the other hand, the premise of CRAFT is that deliberate, positive interactions can increase willingness and decrease resistance of users to treatment.  Al-Anon recognizes that while increased willingness and decreased resistance may be a happy by-product of detaching from the adverse behaviors of alcoholics, there are no guarantees that this will occur.  [[Al-Anon/Alateen|Al-Anon]] is a fellowship with a focus on helping families and friends, themselves, without promoting a direct intervention process for alcoholics ''(see [[Al-Anon/Alateen]])''. Because "no one ever graduates" from [[Al-Anon/Alateen|Al-Anon]],&lt;ref name="PCFGrad"&gt;{{cite news|last=Broughton |first=June B. |title=Alanon: Help, But 'No One Graduates' |url=http://news.nnyln.net/potsdam-courier-freeman/potsdam-courier-freeman-1977-september-1978-july/potsdam-courier-freeman-1977-september-1978-july%20-%200565.pdf |format=pdf |department= |newspaper=Potsdam Courier and Freeman |location=Potsdam, N.Y., Lawrence, N.Y. |publisher=Northern New York Historical Newspapers |publication-date=July 1978 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203104740/http://news.nnyln.net/potsdam-courier-freeman/potsdam-courier-freeman-1977-september-1978-july/potsdam-courier-freeman-1977-september-1978-july%20-%200565.pdf |archivedate=February 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Anon can be viewed as an open-ended program, not time-limited, whereas CRAFT is more specific.

=== Al-Anon view ===

Regarding the CSO's relationship to [[alcoholism]] and sobriety, the view from the [[Al-Anon/Alateen|Al-Anon]] organization can be summarized:

# ''Powerlessness''. [[Al-Anon/Alateen|Al-Anon]]'s First Step promotes a powerless view for families and friends, "We admitted we were powerless over [[alcohol]]—that our lives had become unmanageable."&lt;ref name="HIW45"&gt;{{cite book | title = How Al-Anon Works for Families and Friends of Alcoholics | year = 1995 | publisher = Al-Anon Family Group Headquarters, Inc. | location = [[Virginia Beach, Virginia|Virginia Beach]], [[Virginia]] | isbn = 0-910034-26-5 | oclc = 32951492 | page = 45}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''[[Disease]]''. [[Al-Anon/Alateen|Al-Anon]] writes, "As the [[American Medical Association]] will attest, [[alcoholism]] is a [[disease]]."&lt;ref name="HIW17" /&gt; [[Al-Anon/Alateen|Al-Anon]] also states, "Although it can be arrested, [[alcoholism]] has no known cure."&lt;ref name="HIW17"&gt;{{cite book | title = How Al-Anon Works for Families and Friends of Alcoholics | year = 1995 | publisher = Al-Anon Family Group Headquarters, Inc. | location = [[Virginia Beach, Virginia|Virginia Beach]], [[Virginia]] | isbn = 0-910034-26-5 | oclc = 32951492 | page = 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
One member writes, "I have been affected by a terrible disease,"&lt;ref name="HIW158" /&gt; which embraces the "disease model" of [[alcoholism]]. As an [[Al-Anon/Alateen|Al-Anon]] reflects on that step, "By ourselves, we can do nothing to overcome the effects of this disease. In fact, our attempts to exert power over alcohol have made our lives unmanageable."&lt;ref name="HIW4546" /&gt; These statements are based on the First Step of [[Al-Anon/Alateen]], which is, "We admitted we were powerless over alcohol—that our lives had become unmanageable."&lt;ref name="HIW4546"&gt;{{cite book | title = How Al-Anon Works for Families and Friends of Alcoholics | year = 1995 | publisher = Al-Anon Family Group Headquarters, Inc. | location = [[Virginia Beach, Virginia|Virginia Beach]], [[Virginia]] | isbn = 0-910034-26-5 | oclc = 32951492 | pages = 45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;
--&gt;
# ''Three C's''. [[Al-Anon/Alateen|Al-Anon]] has a dictum called "the Three C's—I didn't cause [[alcoholism]]; I can't control it; and I can't cure it."&lt;ref name="HIW158"&gt;{{cite book | title = How Al-Anon Works for Families and Friends of Alcoholics | year = 1995 | publisher = Al-Anon Family Group Headquarters, Inc. | location = [[Virginia Beach, Virginia|Virginia Beach]], [[Virginia]] | isbn = 0-910034-26-5 | oclc = 32951492 | page = 158}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Detach with Love.'' [[Al-Anon/Alateen|Al-Anon]] "advocates 'loving detachment' from the substance abuser" (see sidebar: Engaging v. Detaching).
# ''Family illness''. [[Al-Anon/Alateen|Al-Anon]] writes, "[[Alcoholism]] is a family [[disease]],"&lt;ref name="Detachment_S19"&gt;{{cite web | author = Al-Anon Family Group Headquarters, Inc. | url = http://www.al-anon.org/members/pdf/S19.pdf | title = Detachment | publisher = Al-Anon Family Group Headquarters, Inc. | location = [[Virginia Beach, Virginia|Virginia Beach]], [[Virginia]] | accessdate = January 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "we believe [[alcoholism]] is a family illness and that changed attitudes can aid recovery."&lt;ref name="Al-Anon_Preamble"&gt;{{cite web | last = Al-Anon Family Groups | url = http://www.al-anon.alateen.org/the-twelve-steps | title = Suggested Al-Anon Preamble to the Twelve Steps | publisher = Al-Anon Family Group Headquarters, Inc. | location = [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]] | work = www.al-anon.alateen.org | accessdate = January 18, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--This family-illness view may appear contradictory to the individual-disease view, except that [[Al-Anon/Alateen|Al-Anon]]'s focus is to help the family members and friends of [[alcoholics]].--&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt;

Regarding [[alcoholics]], the [[Al-Anon/Alateen|Al-Anon]]-recommended approach for CSOs (families/friends) is "detachment with love"

==== No direct impact ====
As far as the CSOs having a direct and positive impact on another's sobriety, [[Al-Anon/Alateen|Al-Anon]] asks and answers itself:
{{quote
|"But surely," we argue, "sobriety is desirable, and there must be something we can do to help! There has to be something we can say that will make a difference, or some sort of help or support or information we can provide that will convince our [[alcoholic]] loved ones to get the help they need or to make sure they continue on the path to recovery!"&lt;ref name="HIW17"&gt;{{cite book | title = How Al-Anon Works for Families and Friends of Alcoholics | year = 1995 | publisher = Al-Anon Family Group Headquarters, Inc. | location = [[Virginia Beach, Virginia|Virginia Beach]], [[Virginia]] | isbn = 0-910034-26-5 | oclc = 32951492 | page = 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alcoholism]] is a disease. Would the right word stop the spread of [[cancer]] or make [[chemotherapy]] more effective? Would our help, good looks, higher income, or cleaner house overcome the progression of [[Alzheimer's Disease]]? Our compassion and support might make a loved one's struggle with illness easier to bear, but it is simply not within our power to cure someone else's [[disease]]. We are powerless over another's [[alcoholism]].&lt;ref name="HIW17" /&gt;|sign=|source=}}This answer has these three characteristics:&lt;!--, except they "believe that [[alcoholism]] is a family illness and that changed attitudes can aid recovery."&lt;ref name="Al-Anon_Preamble" /&gt; Aside from the ''[[wiktionary:non sequitur|non sequitur]]'' that [[alcoholism]] is a disease—therefore we do not have the power to cure others and we are powerless over another's alcoholism, esp. as it relates to the CRA and CRAFT premise that CSOs can have a positive impact--&gt;

# ''Absolute outcomes''. Regarding ''help'', Al-Anon's answer tends toward complete and total outcomes, such as the ability for someone to ''convince'', ''cure'' or ''overcome'' someone else's [[alcoholism]], or that they could guarantee ''(make sure)'' that someone continues on the path to recovery. Although this answer may help dispel the notion that someone has permanent, guaranteed power over another's sobriety, it does not answer the question that someone could provide ''any'' measure of direct help or support toward someone else's sobriety or treatment of someone else's addiction, which is the basis of CRAFT.
# ''Incomplete analogies''. Al-Anon wrote that ''the right word'' can neither make [[chemotherapy]]—a [[bio-chemical]] process—more effective ''nor stop'' [[cancer]]. However, the answer does not address the ''help'' or ''support'' or ''information'' that could make [[cancer treatment]] more effective or that could have a positive impact against [[cancer]]. &lt;!-- removed, probabaly unnecessary: In a CRAFT analogy, ''words'' and behavior could have a direct and positive impact on someone partaking in [[cancer treatment]], with a successful outcome.--&gt;
# ''Medical opinion''. Modern contrary assessments exist that [[alcoholism|alcohol]] (and [[drug addiction|drug]]) [[addiction]] are ''not'' (progressive, incurable) [[diseases]], coming from Dr. Gene Heyman&lt;ref name="HEYMAN"&gt;{{cite book |last=Heyman |first=Gene M. |year= 2010 |title= Addiction: A Disorder of Choice |url= http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674057272|format= paperback|location= [[Cambridge, MA|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts|MA]] |publisher= [[Harvard University Press]] |publication-date= October 2010|isbn= 978-0-674-05727-2|accessdate= January 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others ''(see [[disease theory of alcoholism]])''. In 1960, [[Bill W.|Bill Wilson]]—the co-founder of [[Alcoholics Anonymous|A.A.]] (his wife [[Lois W.|Lois]] was co-founder of [[Al-Anon/Alateen|Al-Anon]])—called [[alcoholism]] a ''malady or illness'' and did not view it as a [[disease]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nccatoday.org/conversation.htm NCCAtoday.org]&lt;/ref&gt; ''(see [[Alcoholics Anonymous#Disease concept of alcoholism|Alcoholics Anonymous § Disease concept of alcoholism]])''. The diagnostic assessment of [[alcoholism]] in someone can include an assessment of [[co-morbidity]], [[mental illness]], and [[domestic violence]]. &lt;!-- unnecessary, and could be harmful to Al-Anon:; and [[Al-Anon/Alateen|Al-Anon]] does not claim to be a medical or therapy organization.--&gt;
&lt;!--Perhaps germane, [[Al-Anon/Alateen|Al-Anon]] has this disclaimer in their suggested meeting materials: "Take what you like and leave the rest."&lt;ref name="Meeting_On_Wheels_Closing"&gt;{{ cite web | last = Al-Anon Family Groups | url = http://www.al-anon.alateen.org/members/pdf/guidelines/G22.pdf | title = Al-Anon Guideline: A Meeting on Wheels, G-22 | publisher = Al-Anon Family Group Headquarters, Inc. | location = [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]] | work = www.al-anon.alateen.org | accessdate = January 22, 2014 | pages = 2}}, "Al-Anon/Alateen Closing"&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;
&lt;!--
[[Al-Anon/Alateen|Al-Anon]] is a fellowship founded on [[twelve steps]]. It is not a medical, therapy, or direct [[Intervention (counseling)|intervention]] society ''(see [[Al-Anon/Alateen]])''.
--&gt;
&lt;!-- Omitted, may confuse the issue:
As far as positive effect, a premise they hold is that "the family situation is bound to improve as we apply the Al-Anon ideas. Without such spiritual help, living with an alcoholic is too much for most of us."&lt;ref name="Meeting_On_Wheels"&gt;{{ cite web | last = Al-Anon Family Groups | url = http://www.al-anon.alateen.org/members/pdf/guidelines/G22.pdf | title = Al-Anon Guideline: A Meeting on Wheels, G-22 | publisher = Al-Anon Family Group Headquarters, Inc. | location = [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]] | work = www.al-anon.alateen.org | accessdate = April 26, 2010 | pages = 1}}, "Suggested Al-Anon/Alateen Welcome"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al-Anon/Alateen|Al-Anon]] does not practice or teach active, direct [[interventions]].

Their focus is on the families and friends. ''(See [[Al-Anon/Alateen]])''.
--&gt;

=== CRAFT view ===

''From [[SMART Recovery#Family &amp; Friends|SMART Recovery, section: Family &amp; Friends]]:''

{{ quote
|The work of Robert Meyers' CRAFT Community Reinforcement Approach and Family Training program ... differs significantly from [[Al-Anon/Alateen|Al-Anon]] in that it is a behavioral program which advocates that the CSO ''[Concerned Significant Other]'' can have a positive impact on the substance abuser. The CRAFT program has been demonstrated in Meyers' research to be more effective than the [[Vernon Johnson]] type [[Intervention (counseling)|intervention]] or [[Al-Anon/Alateen|Al-Anon]], with less negative side-effects and better outcomes, whether or not the substance abuser enters treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, J.E. &amp; Meyers, R.J. (2004) Motivating Substance Abusers to Enter Treatment: Working with Family Members; Guilford Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, RJ &amp; Wolfe, B. (2004) Get Your Loved One Sober: Alternative to Nagging, Pleading and Threatening by Meyers, Hazelden Press&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

The CRAFT program uses a variety of interventions based on functional assessment including a module to prevent [[domestic violence]].

== Intervention ==

"There are questions about the long-term effectiveness of interventions for those addicted to drugs or alcohol.  A study examining addicts who had undergone a standard intervention (called the Johnson Intervention) found that they had a higher relapse rate than any other method of referral to outpatient Alcohol and Other Drug treatment"&lt;ref&gt;"The Johnson intervention and relapse during outpatient treatment".  American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse 22.n3 (August 1996): pp36&lt;/ref&gt;''(see [[Intervention (counseling)#Controversy|Intervention, section: Controversy]])''.

Smith, Campos-Melady and Meyers describe the Johnson Institute [[Intervention (counseling)|intervention]] as a "surprise party" that is uncomfortable for many CSOs (families/friends):

{{quote
|The [[Al-Anon/Alateen|Al-Anon]] approach’s emphasis upon detaching from the substance abuser is unappealing to many CSOs. On the other end of the spectrum is the Johnson Institute [[Intervention (counseling)|Intervention]]: a “surprise party” in which the IP is confronted by family members and a therapist with the objective of getting the IP to enter treatment. When the [[Intervention (counseling)|intervention]] is actually carried out, it often results in a high rate of engagement in treatment, and yet only a small number of CSOs who begin the program ever follow through with the [[Intervention (counseling)|intervention]] (Liepman, Nirenberg, &amp; Begin, 1989; Miller et al., 1999), and many report feeling uncomfortable with its confrontational nature (Barber &amp; Gilbertson, 1997).&lt;ref name="CRAANDCRAFTJBAHSFM" /&gt;{{rp|22}}

Research suggests that CRAFT has had significantly greater success than the Johnson [[Intervention (counseling)|Intervention]] method or [[Al-Anon/Alateen]], as far as engaging loved ones in treatment.

|70% of people who use CRAFT are likely to get their loved into treatment as opposed to 30% of people using an intervention ... . And then, for Al-Anon, you've got like 12% of people getting their loved one into treatment. Now, that's sort of not a fair comparison because Al-Anon is not designed to get someone else to do something. Al-Anon is specifically designed to help the family member feel better, and that it does quite well, but in terms of influencing change in the loved one [—the substance user], not so well. And, the only reason to make those comparisons ... is simply because there are no other options in our society. So, if you go to a therapist or a clergyman or something and say "my kid is smoking too much pot, and I don't know what to do about it," they are going to send you to Al-Anon or a therapist, or talk to you about getting an intervention [not CRAFT]. So, those are the options [to CRAFT] we have in the world.

"The Community Reinforcement Approach has been found to be extremely effective in outpatient settings as well. In one study, clients treated with CRA and the [[disulfiram]] compliance component were abstinent an average of 97% of the days during the last month of the 6-month followup, whereas clients treated with a combination of a [[12-step]] program and the CRA [[disulfiram]] compliance training were
abstinent an average of 74% of the days. For those clients who received a [[12-step]] program and a prescription for [[disulfiram]], an average of only 45% of the comparable days were abstinent (Azrin, Sisson, Meyers, &amp; Godley, 1982)."&lt;ref name="CRAANDCRAFTJBAHSFM" /&gt;{{rp|5}}

From an article on the American Psychology Association (APA) website about the success of CRAFT in substance abuse treatment and intervention,&lt;ref name="APACRAFT" /&gt; these are the success outcomes for engaging drinkers into treatment:

# 64%&amp;nbsp;– CRAFT
# 23%&amp;nbsp;– Johnson [[Intervention (counseling)|Intervention]]
# 13%&amp;nbsp;– [[Al-Anon/Alateen|Al-Anon]]

From the article:

{{ quote
|Sisson and Azrin (1986) recruited 12 adult women with an [[alcoholic]] husband, brother, or father and randomly assigned them either to an early version of CRAFT or to a traditional [[Intervention (counseling)|intervention]]. Results indicated that CRAFT was considerably more successful in getting the persons with substance abuse into treatment and reducing their alcohol consumption in comparison to the [[Al-Anon/Alateen|Al-Anon]] group. Miller et al. (1999) conducted a controlled comparison of CRAFT, the Johnson Intervention, and [[Al-Anon/Alateen|Al-Anon]] facilitation (TSF) that randomized 130 caregivers of problem drinkers to receive 12 hours of contact in one of the three conditions. CRAFT and TSF had better retention than the Johnson Intervention. Consistent with previous studies, participants tended to drop out of the latter intervention in order to avoid the family confrontation with the drinker. The CRAFT intervention also engaged substantially more drinkers into treatment (64% vs 23% Johnson and 13% TSF).&lt;ref name="APACRAFT"&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.apa.org/pi/about/publications/caregivers/practice-settings/intervention/community-reinforcement.aspx | title = CRAFT | publisher = American Psychology Association | accessdate = 20 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Drug abusers intervention ====

From the same article on the American Psychology Association (APA) website about the success of CRAFT in substance abuse treatment and intervention,&lt;ref name="APACRAFT" /&gt; these are the success outcomes for persons abusing drugs to enter treatment (the success outcomes were nearly the same as the [[alcoholism|alcohol abuse]] outcomes):

# 64%&amp;nbsp;– CRAFT
# 17%&amp;nbsp;– Caregivers' [[Twelve-step]] Self-help Group (TSG)

From the article:

{{ quote
|Kirby et al. (1999) randomly assigned 32 caregivers of drug users to CRAFT or a [[twelve-step|12-step]] self-help group (TSG). Caregivers who were assigned to CRAFT attended more sessions than those in TSG and were more likely to complete a full course of counseling during which the persons abusing drugs were far more likely to enter treatment (64% vs 17%). Reductions in drug use occurred during the study, but there was no group x time interaction. Meyers et al. (2002) replicated and extended those findings with drug users with similar positive effects on engagement of the drug abusing family members in treatment.&lt;ref name="APACRAFT" /&gt;
}}

Note: When the articles states "there was no group x time interaction," it simply means the CRAFT outcome (64%) and the TSF outcome (17%) remained the same over time, even though there was a reduction in drug use during the study.

CRA was designed by Nate Azrin in the early 1970s:

{{ quote
|The most influential behaviorist of all times, [[B. F. Skinner]], largely considered [[Punishment (psychology)|punishment]] to be an ineffective method for modifying human behavior ([[B. F. Skinner|Skinner]] 1974). Thus it was no surprise that, many years later, research discovered that [[substance use disorder]] treatments based on confrontation were largely ineffective in decreasing the use of alcohol and other substances (Miller and Wilbourne 2002, Miller et al. 1998). Nate Azrin already was convinced of this back in the early 1970s, when he designed an innovative treatment for [[alcoholism|alcohol problems]]: the Community Reinforcement Approach (CRA). Azrin believed that it was necessary to alter the environment in which people with [[alcoholism|alcohol problems]] live so that they received strong reinforcement for sober behavior from their community, including family, work, and friends. As part of this strategy, the program emphasizes helping clients discover new, enjoyable activities that do not revolve around alcohol, and teaching them the skills necessary for participating in those activities.&lt;ref name="MeyersRoozenSmith2011" /&gt;
}}

The origin of CRAFT:

{{ quote
|Drs. Robert J. Meyers and Jane Ellen Smith of the [[University of New Mexico]] developed the CRAFT program to teach families how to impact their loved one while avoiding both detachment and confrontation, the respective strategies of [[Al-Anon/Alateen|Al-Anon]] (a [[12-Step]] based approach), and traditional (Johnson Institute-style) interventions in which the substance user is confronted by family members and friends during a surprise meeting. While all three approaches have been found to improve family members' functioning and relationship satisfaction, CRAFT has proven to be significantly more effective in engaging loved ones in comparison to the Johnson Institute Intervention or [[Al-Anon/Alateen|Al-Anon]]/[[Nar-Anon]] facilitation therapy.&lt;ref name="CMCWISCRAFT"&gt;{{cite web |title= What Is CRAFT|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |publisher= The Center for Motivation and Change (CMC)|url=http://www.motivationandchange.com/family-services/what-is-craft|website=www.motivationandchange.com|accessdate=January 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16104">{{short description|Will of the people as source of political legitimacy}}
In [[political philosophy]], the phrase '''consent of the governed''' refers to the idea that a [[government]]'s [[political legitimacy|legitimacy]] and [[natural and legal rights|moral right]] to use state power is only justified and lawful when consented to by the people  or [[society]] over which that [[political power]] is exercised. This theory of [[consent]] is historically contrasted to the [[divine right of kings]] and had often been invoked against the legitimacy of [[colonialism]]. Article 21 of the United Nation's 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] states that "The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government".

==History==
In his 1937 book ''[[A History of Political Theory]]'', [[George Sabine]] collected the views of many political theorists on consent of the governed. He notes the idea mentioned in 1433 by [[Nicholas of Cusa]] in ''De Concordantia Catholica''. In 1579 [[Theodore Beza]] wrote ''Vindiciae contra Tyrannos'' which Sabine paraphrases: "The people lay down the conditions which the king is bound to fulfill. Hence they are bound to obedience only conditionally, namely, upon receiving the protection of just and lawful government…the power of the ruler is delegated by the people and continues only with their consent."&lt;ref name=Sabine&gt;George Sabine (1937) A History of Political Theory, [[Holt, Rinehart and Winston]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|381}} In England, the [[Levellers]] also held to this principle of government.

[[John Milton]] wrote
{{quote|The power of kings and magistrates is nothing else, but what is only derivative, transferred and committed to them in trust from the people, to the common good of them all, in whom the power yet remains fundamentally, and cannot be taken from them, without a violation of their natural birthright.&lt;ref name=Sabine/&gt;{{rp|510}}&lt;ref&gt;John Milton ''Works'' V: 10&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Similarly, Sabine notes the position of [[John Locke]] in ''Essay concerning Human Understanding'': 
{{quote|[Civic power] can have no right except as this is derived from the individual right of each man to protect himself and his property. The legislative and executive power used by government to protect property is nothing except the natural power of each man resigned into the hands  of the community…and it is justified merely because it is a better way of protecting natural right than the self-help to which each man is naturally entitled.&lt;ref name=Sabine/&gt;{{rp|532}} }}

However, with [[David Hume]] a contrary voice is heard. Sabine interprets Hume's [[skepticism]] by noting
{{quote|The political world over, absolute governments which do not even do lip-service to the fiction of consent are more common than free governments, and their subjects rarely question their right except when tyranny becomes too oppressive.&lt;ref name=Sabine/&gt;{{rp|603}}}}

Sabine revived the concept from its status as a [[political myth]] after Hume, by referring to [[Thomas Hill Green]]. Green wrote that government required "will not force" for administration.  As put by Sabine,&lt;ref name=Sabine/&gt;{{rp|731}}
{{quote|Even the most powerful and the most despotic government cannot hold a society together by sheer force; to that extent there was a limited truth to the old belief that governments are produced by consent.}}

Consent of the governed, within the [[social liberalism]] of T. H. Green, was also described by [[Paul Harris (public servant)|Paul Harris]]:
{{quote|The conditions for the existence of a political society have less to do with force and fear of coercion than with the members' mutual recognition of a good common to themselves and others, although it may not be consciously expressed as such. Thus for the conditions for any civil combination to disappear through resistance to a despotic government or disobedience to law would require such a disastrous upheaval as to be unlikely in all but the most extreme circumstances in which we might agree with Green that the price would be too high to pay, yet sufficiently rare to allow us to acknowledge that there would ordinarily be a moral duty to act to overthrow any state that did not pursue the common good.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Harris (1982) "Green’s theory of political obligation and disobedience", pp 127 to 142 in ''The Philosophy of T. H. Green'', Andrew Vincent editor, [[Gower Publishing]], {{ISBN|0-566-05104-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==In the United States==
"Consent of the governed" is a phrase found in the [[United States Declaration of Independence]].

Using thinking similar to that of [[John Locke]], the founders of the [[United States]] believed in a state built upon the consent of "free and equal" citizens; a state otherwise conceived would lack [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] and [[Rational-legal authority]]. This was expressed, among other places, in the 2nd paragraph of the Declaration of Independence (emphasis added):&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ushistory.org/declaration/document/index.htm{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that [[all men are created equal]], that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are [[Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness]].--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the {{em|consent of the governed}}, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And in the earlier [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]], especially Section 6, quoted below, founding father [[George Mason]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;That elections of members to serve as representatives of the people, in assembly, ought to be free; and that all men, having sufficient evidence of permanent common interest with, the attachment to, the community, have the right of suffrage, and cannot be taxed or deprived of their property for public uses without their own consent, or that of their representatives so elected, nor bound by any law to which they have not, in like manner, assented, for the [[public interest|public good]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Virginia Declaration of Rights|Virginia Declaration of Rights]]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although the [[Continental Congress]] at the outset of the [[American Revolution]] had no explicit legal authority to govern,&lt;ref&gt;Bancroft, Ch. 34, p.353 [http://www.hti.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=moa;cc=moa;rgn=full%20text;idno=AAN2921.0007.001;didno=AAN2921.0007.001;view=image;seq=00000363 (online)]&lt;/ref&gt; it was delegated by the states with all the functions of a national government, such as appointing ambassadors, signing treaties, raising armies, appointing generals, obtaining loans from Europe, issuing paper money (called "Continentals"), and disbursing funds. The Congress had no authority to levy taxes, and was required to request money, supplies, and troops from the states to support the war effort. Individual states frequently ignored these requests. According to the ''Cyclopædia of Political Science''. New York: Maynard, Merrill, and Co., 1899, commenting on the source of the Congress' power:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The appointment of the delegates to both these congresses was generally by popular conventions, though in some instances by state assemblies. But in neither case can the appointing body be considered the original depositary of the power by which the delegates acted; for the conventions were either self-appointed "committees of safety" or hastily assembled popular gatherings, including but a small fraction of the population to be represented, and the state assemblies had no right to surrender to another body one atom of the power which had been granted to them, or to create a new power which should govern the people without their will. The source of the powers of congress is to be sought solely in the acquiescence of the people, without which every congressional resolution, with or without the benediction of popular conventions or state legislatures, would have been a mere ''brutum fulmen''; and, as the congress unquestionably exercised national powers, operating over the whole country, the conclusion is inevitable that the will of the whole people is the source of national government in the United States, even from its first imperfect appearance in the second continental congress...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Types of consent==

===Unanimous consent===
A key question is whether the [[unanimous consent]] of the governed is required; if so, this would imply the [[right of secession]] for those who do not want to be governed by a particular collective. All democratic governments today allow decisions to be made even over the dissent of a minority of voters, which in some theorists' view, calls into question whether said governments can rightfully claim, in all circumstances, to act with the consent of the governed.&lt;ref name=Cassinelli/&gt;

===Hypothetical consent===
The theory of hypothetical consent of the governed holds that one's obligation to obey government depends on whether the government is such that one ''ought'' to consent to it, or whether the people, if placed in a [[state of nature]] without government, would agree to said government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Hanna |last1=Pitkin |year=1966 |title=Obligation and Consent—II |journal=The American Political Science Review |volume=60 |issue=1 |pages=39–52 |jstor=1953805 |doi=10.2307/1953805}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory has been rejected by some scholars{{Who|date=May 2015}}, who argue that since government itself can commit aggression, creating a government to safeguard the people from aggression would be similar to the people, if given the choice of what animals to be attacked by, trading "[[weasel|polecats]] and foxes for a lion", a trade that they would not make.&lt;ref name=Bookman/&gt;

===Overt versus tacit consent===

Another division that is sometimes made is between [[overt consent]] and [[tacit consent]]. Overt consent, to be valid, would require [[voluntariness]], a specific act on the part of the consenters, a particular act consented to, and specific agents who perform this action. [[Immigrating]] into a particular jurisdiction is sometimes regarded as an overt act indicating consent to be ruled by that jurisdiction's government. Not all who are ruled by a particular government have immigrated to that jurisdiction, however; some were born there; however others argue that the power to emigrate from (i.e. leave) a jurisdiction ''implies'' such consent omission.

It has been pointed out that in jurisdictions where [[proportional representation]] is not used, but candidates are instead elected by [[plurality vote]], a candidate can be elected despite the overt dissent of a majority of the people. Not every voter has necessarily had an opportunity to vote on the constitutional provisions specifying that plurality voting should be used; according to some theorists, this calls into question whether said voters have consented to be governed by the candidates who obtain plurality support. A counterargument is that, by failing to act through the process of [[constitutional amendment]] to change such provisions, the people have consented to them. A rebuttal to this is that in some jurisdictions, the means of amending the constitution are not completely in the hands of the electorate; the same issues arise, in claiming that the constitution left in place by the decisions of the people's elected representatives is consented to by the people, as arise in claiming that any other actions taken by said representatives are consented to by the people. Some proponents of the "overt consent" theory hold that the act of voting implies consent, while others question the connection between voting and consenting to a particular scheme of representative, since some voters may oppose the system as a whole but desire to influence decisions on particular issues or candidates.&lt;ref name=Cassinelli&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/106591295901200202 |title=The 'Consent' of the Governed |year=1959 |last1=Cassinelli |first1=C. W. |journal=Political Research Quarterly |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=391–409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of tacit consent of the governed holds that if the people live in a country that is not undergoing a rebellion, they have consented to the rule of that country's government.&lt;ref name=Bookman&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1536-7150.1984.tb01750.x |title=Locke's Contract: Would People consent to It? |year=1984 |last1=Bookman |first1=John T. |journal=American Journal of Economics and Sociology |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=357–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this likewise meets with the criticism that tacit consent is incompatible with ''express'' opposition: i.e. the People cannot consent if they have no ''right'' to refuse.

===Engineered consent===
In 1988, [[Edward S. Herman]] and [[Noam Chomsky]] described a [[propaganda model]] of [[news media in the United States]]&lt;ref&gt;Edward S. Herman &amp; Noam Chomsky (1988) [[Manufacturing Consent]]&lt;/ref&gt; in which coverage of [[current events]] was skewed by [[corporations]] and the [[state (polity)|state]] in order to manufacture the consent of the governed. According to the propagandist [[Edward L. Bernays]], the public may be manipulated by its subconscious desires to render votes to a political candidate. The [[public relations]] techniques were described in his essay and book ''[[The Engineering of Consent]]'' (1955). Consent thus obtained undermines the legitimacy of government: "The basic principle involved is simple but important: If the opinions of the public are to control the government, these opinions must not be controlled by the government."&lt;ref&gt;John C. Livingston &amp; Robert G. Thompson (1966) ''The Consent of the Governed'', 2nd edition, page 457, [[Collier Macmillan]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literal consent===
The theory of literal consent holds the logical position that valid consent must denote final authority belonging to the people, rather than elected officials, therefore this implies that the people have the absolute sovereign power to overrule their government at any time via popular vote (or as stated in the Declaration of Independence, "the right of the People to alter or abolish" their government). Without this unfettered power, theorists hold that true consent cannot exist and that any government is therefore despotism via governing the people by force without their actual consent.

'''''DragonQuest''''' is a [[fantasy]] [[role-playing game]] originally published by [[Simulations Publications]] (SPI) in 1980.  Where first generation fantasy role-playing games such as ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' restricted players to particular [[character class]]es, ''DragonQuest'' was one of the first games to utilize a system that emphasized [[skill (role-playing games)|skill]]s, allowing more individual customization and a wider range of options.

== System ==

=== Character generation ===

Character generation is much more involved than ''D&amp;D'', with the player using 10 sided die to determine everything from the character's race to handedness to the number of points they have to distribute amongst the primary characteristics (Strength, Agility, Manual Dexterity, Magical Aptitude, Endurance, and Willpower) which determine the character's strengths and weaknesses.  Being able to control the value of these attributes allows for greater flexibility in character generation.  For example, players seeking a powerful magic user can divert points to Magical Aptitude and possibly Willpower.  Those seeking pure fighters can invest their points in Strength, Agility and Manual Dexterity.  By carefully balancing these numbers, fighter/mages, thief/assassins, and other combinations can be devised.

=== Magic ===

The magic system in ''DragonQuest'' features distinct Magical Colleges, each with its own group of spells and rituals.  Player characters who enter magical study are assumed to have apprenticed with a mage of their particular Magic College, and have learned all the basic spells and a ritual or two from their former Master. Player characters cannot change Magic Colleges in the context of game play, and so are all essentially specialists in a college of magic.  Some of the Magic Colleges include: Earth Magic, Air Magic, Fire Magic, Water Magic, Illusions, Ensorcelments, Greater &amp; Lesser Summoning, and Necromantic Conjurations.  The revised second edition and third edition (released by TSR) added some colleges and removed others.

Players expend fatigue points to cast spells, and must roll percentile dice to succeed.  Many of the more powerful spells have a very low chance of success, and may ''backfire'' with random results (many quite unpleasant).  By expending experience points, a mage may improve their ability to cast specific spells by gaining rank in them.  There are also advanced spells which can be obtained from more powerful mages in one's Magic College.  This advanced knowledge may require a substantial cash payment or some kind of quest to obtain, however.  Certain spells require expensive or rare elements to work properly, while the majority are merely spoken.

Specific rules exist for player Adepts to invest objects to create magic items (such as rings, amulets, weapons, etc.) for later use by themselves or other party members.  Such items are also found on occasion during an expedition or exploration.

=== Skills ===

Any player character may choose to learn various skills in ''DragonQuest''.  Vocations such as Ranger, Thief, Assassin, Merchant, Courtesan, Navigator, Healer, Military Scientist, Mechanician, Beastmaster, Troubador may be acquired by expending the necessary experience points.  Certain other skills, such as Stealth, Horseback Riding, reading and/or writing a Language can also be practiced and improved.  Characters are not limited to any particular set of skills, and a Halfling Assassin who speaks perfect Elvish is technically possible.

Weapons are learned in much the same manner as Vocations.  The limitation is that weapons have various maximum ranks (levels) which can be achieved, while other skills usually top out at rank 10.  Magic spells gain improved chances of success and better strength when rank is gained in them also, and this is done on a spell-by-spell basis (e.g. character is a fire mage and has improved his skill to rank 6 in Fireball, but rank 0 in many other spells of his magic college which he considers less important).

Characters are required to spend many weeks training ''after'' an experience-generating adventure in order to increase skill levels.  Weapons training typically requires the aid of a person of greater skill than the player, and hiring a weapon-master can be expensive as well.  Often, a group will return to town laden with gold, only to realize that between the several months spent training (room &amp; board) and the cost of experts to assist them with training, most of the money is already spent!  It is also possible that a character may actually ''be'' the expert in his/her local area, and thus might have to travel some distance to receive instruction from a person of greater ability.

=== Combat ===

''DQ'' uses a hex grid and miniatures for combat.  Unlike other systems, where the miniatures are merely placeholders, ''DQ'' requires that characters know their facing, as attacks from the flanks and rear are more effective than frontal assaults.  Combat takes place in 5-second "pulses" and characters may only move short distances while actively engaged in a meleè.

Each character has a strike chance % based on (mostly) their manual dexterity and the base chance of the weapon used to attack.  Additional factors, such as running into an attack or achieving surprise—as in an ambush—modify this base chance.  The defender's defensive % is subtracted from this number, and percentile dice rolled to see if a hit is achieved.  When a hit is delivered, the attacker rolls a d10, adds the weapon's attack bonus, and subtracts the target's armor rating.  In some cases, such as a target with plate armor, few weapons can do much damage directly.  Only certain special hits can damage the target severely.  But with time, even the most heavily armored Knight can usually be worn-down.

Unlike other systems, which use "hit points" to tally damage, ''DQ'' has a two-tiered system of fatigue and endurance.  Normally a weapon does fatigue damage only, but an especially lucky hit may immediately cause ''endurance'' damage or even a ''grievous injury'', which allows the attacker to roll again on a table of nasty hits to the eyes, guts, etc.  Once a character has lost all of his fatigue, he begins taking endurance damage instead.  This is bad, since endurance damage requires magical intervention or extended bed rest to be recovered.  Fatigue can be recovered by simply relaxing and getting a hot meal and a good night's sleep.   Endurance damage may also increase susceptibility to infection, at the discretion of the referee.

Another ''DQ'' feature is a three-tiered combat range system:  Ranged, Melee, and Close Combat.  Ranged Combat typically involves bows, slings, and thrown knives, while Melee is swords, spears, maces and most other weapons.  Close Combat in ''DQ'' is wrestling on the ground with knives, fists, rocks, etc.  ''DQ'' allows a party of adventurers to be surrounded and ultimately overwhelmed by large numbers of peasants, who rather than attacking singly and being cut to ribbons, will instead seek to surround and leap into Close Combat to subdue and pin down Player Characters.  Some weapons, such as daggers, can be used at all ranges, but most cannot and are useless when the character is being shot with bows or engaged in Close Combat.

DragonQuest combat falls midway in complexity between ''D&amp;D'' and systems such as ''[[Runequest]]'' or ''[[HârnMaster]]''.  It can take several hours to resolve battles.  Tactics, choice of weapon, and use of spells are keys to victory.  The uniqueness to ''DQ'' is that novice characters and mighty adventurers have nearly the same ability to absorb damage—i.e. they can both be killed fairly easily (unlike ''D&amp;D'' in which high-level characters can take remarkable amounts of damage without dying).  This requires parties to have a balance of fighting and magic skills, since a party cannot be centered on a single nigh-invulnerable figure (a "Conan the Barbarian" type).

=== Experience ===

An experience points system is utilized that enables characters to increase their skill levels in spells and vocations, making their characters more formidable.  Experience is used to 'purchase' new and improved abilities, rather than conferring a blanket increase in character skills as in ''D&amp;D''.

As characters grow in skills and proficiency, the cost to raise to higher skill levels increases greatly, but the amount of base experience points awarded at the successful completion of an adventure increases as well.  In addition, the Dungeon Master may award characters bonus experience points for valiant, clever or outstanding performance during gameplay.

== History ==

''DragonQuest'' appeared in three editions: a first edition published in 1980, a second edition published by SPI in conjunction with [[Bantam Books]] in 1982, and a third edition published by [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]] in 1989 after they acquired SPI. As of 2016, the game belongs to [[Wizards of the Coast]], a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Hasbro]], through acquisition of TSR.

The original working title for ''DragonQuest'' was "''Dragonslayer''" ([[Ares (magazine)|Ares Magazine]] #2), but this had to be changed to avoid a conflict with [[Walt Disney Pictures]]' movie, ''[[Dragonslayer (1981 film)|Dragonslayer]]''. SPI later (in 1981) published a board game titled ''[[Dragonslayer (game)|Dragonslayer]]'', a tie-in with the movie.

The ''DragonQuest'' [[trademark]] prevented the ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' video game series from being published in North America under that title; the video game was retitled ''Dragon Warrior'' when it debuted in that market in 1990, and subsequent sequels also used this name until 2003. In 2003, [[Square Enix]] registered the ''Dragon Quest'' trademark in the [[United States|US]]. This [[trademark abandonment]] by Wizards of the Coast indicates that they have no interest in future ''DragonQuest'' publications.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

The first SPI edition came in a cardboard box containing three separate, softcover books, "Character Generation," "Magic" and a "Monster/Skills" manual.  The second edition came as an all-in-one softcover version published by SPI.  The third edition published by TSR came in yet another all-in-one softcover version with different cover graphics.

The differences between editions lies mainly in the addition and subtraction of some magical colleges as well as some modifications to combat mechanics.

There were supplemental materials released during the game's publication.  There are several pre-written gaming adventures made for the DragonQuest system.  A rolling [[Gamemaster's screen|screen]] for game masters was offered at one point, bearing helpful charts and tables necessary during gameplay.  A large map of the fictional Kingdom of Alusia was released as well, which provided game masters a variety of habitats, environments and islands on which to place the action.

Despite the game's relative obscurity and continued neglect by its copyright holders, the game continues to be played by DragonQuest devotees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Review of DragonQuest|url=http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/12/12828.phtml/|newspaper=RPG.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, DQ groups throughout the world have devised and playtested additional secondary skills (such as swimming and hunting), magic colleges, races (rules for half-elves, half-orcs, etc.), and monsters for the game since it ceased being actively published.  An unofficial player's association exists online.

==Reception==
Forrest Johnson reviewed ''DragonQuest'' in ''[[The Space Gamer]]'' No. 31.&lt;ref name="SG"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Forrest |date=September 1980 |title=Featured Review: DragonQuest|journal=[[The Space Gamer]]|publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]]|issue=31|pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson commented that "Despite its faults, it still presents a pleasing contrast to the sloppiness of [[The Fantasy Trip|TFT]], the illogic of [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons|D&amp;D]], the incoherence of [[Chivalry &amp; Sorcery|C&amp;S]]. It borrows good ideas liberally from the older systems, and offers noteworthy innovations of its own. [...] At [the price], ''DragonQuest'' is a terrific buy."&lt;ref name="SG"/&gt;

''DragonQuest'' was awarded the H.G. Wells Award for "Best Roleplaying Rules of 1980".&lt;ref name="originsawards"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.gama.org/OriginsAwards/OriginsAwardsWinnersThe1980s/The1980OriginsAwards/tabid/3223/Default.aspx| title = The 1980 Origins Awards| publisher = [[Game Manufacturers Association|The Game Manufacturers Association]]| accessdate = 2014-07-04| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121216052355/http://www.gama.org/OriginsAwards/OriginsAwardsWinnersThe1980s/The1980OriginsAwards/tabid/3223/Default.aspx| deadurl = yes| archivedate = 2012-12-16| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11628">'''Environmental full-cost accounting''' ('''EFCA''') is a &lt;!--conventional--&gt; method of [[cost accounting]] that traces [[direct costs]] and allocates [[indirect costs]]&lt;ref&gt; Schaltegger, S. &amp; Burritt, R. (2000), ''Contemporary Environmental Accounting: Issues, Concepts and Practice'', Sheffield: Greenleaf Publishing, p.&amp;nbsp;111.&lt;/ref&gt; by collecting and presenting information about the possible environmental, social and economical [[Cost-benefit analysis|costs and benefits]] or advantages{{spaced ndash}}in short, about the "[[triple bottom line]]"{{spaced ndash}}for each proposed alternative. It is also known as '''true-cost accounting''' ('''TCA'''), but, as definitions for "true" and "full" are inherently subjective, experts consider both terms problematical.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;See [[Green economics]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Since costs and advantages are usually considered in terms of [[Natural environment|environmental]], [[economic]] and [[social]] impacts, full or true cost efforts are collectively called the "triple bottom line".  A large number of standards now exist in this area including [[Ecological Footprint]], [[eco-label]]s, and the [[United Nations]] [[ICLEI|International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives]] approach to triple bottom line using the ecoBudget metric.  The [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) has several accredited standards useful in FCA or TCA including for [[greenhouse gas]]es, the [[ISO 26000]] series for [[corporate social responsibility]] coming in 2010, and the [[ISO 19011]] standard for [[audit]]s including all these.

Because of this evolution of terminology in the [[public sector]] use especially, the term full-cost accounting is now more commonly used in [[management accounting]], e.g. infrastructure management and finance.  Use of the terms FCA or TCA usually indicate relatively conservative extensions of current management practices, and incremental improvements to [[Generally accepted accounting principles|GAAP]] to deal with waste output or resource input.

These have the advantage of avoiding the more contentious questions of social cost.

== Concepts ==
Full-cost accounting embodies several key concepts that distinguish it from standard [[accounting]] techniques. The following list highlights the basic tenets of FCA.

Accounting for:
# [[Cost]]s rather than outlays (see explanation below);
# Hidden costs and externalities;
# Overhead and indirect costs;
# Past and future outlays;
# Costs according to lifecycle of the product.

===1. Costs rather than outlays===
Expenditure of cash to acquire or use a resource. A cost is the cash value of the resource as it is used. For example, an outlay is made when a vehicle is purchased, but the cost of the vehicle is incurred over its active life (e.g., 10 years). The cost of the vehicle must be allocated over a period of time because every year of its use contributes to the [[depreciation]] of the vehicle's value.

===2. Hidden costs===
The value of goods and services is reflected as a cost even if no cash outlay is involved. One community might receive a grant from a state, for example, to purchase equipment. This equipment has value, even though the community did not pay for it in cash. The equipment, therefore, should be valued in an FCA analysis.

Government subsidies in the [[energy production|energy]] and [[food production]] industries keep true costs low through artificially cheap product [[pricing]]. This [[price manipulation]] encourages unsustainable practices and further hides negative externalities endemic to [[fossil fuel]] production and modern [[mechanized agriculture]].

===3. Overhead and indirect costs===
FCA accounts for all overhead and indirect costs, including those that are shared with other public agencies. Overhead and indirect costs might include [[legal service]]s, administrative support, [[data processing]], [[Electronic billing|billing]], and purchasing. Environmental costs as indirect costs include the full range of costs throughout the life-cycle of a product ([[Life cycle assessment]]), some of which even do not show up in the firm's bottom line. &lt;ref&gt;Schaltegger, S. &amp; Burritt, R. (2000): Contemporary Environmental Accounting. Issues, Concepts and Practice. Sheffield: Greenleaf Publ., p.112&lt;/ref&gt; It also contains fixed overhead, fixed administration expense etc.

===4. Past and future outlays===
Past and future cash outlays often do not appear on annual budgets under cash accounting systems. Past (or upfront) costs are initial investments necessary to implement services such as the acquisition of vehicles, equipment, or facilities. Future (or back-end) outlays are costs incurred to complete  operations such as facility closure and postclosure care, equipment retirement, and post-employment health and retirement benefits.

== Examples ==

===Waste management===
For example, the State of Florida uses the term full-cost accounting for its solid waste management. In this instance, FCA is a systematic approach for identifying, summing, and reporting the actual costs of [[solid waste management]]. It takes into account past and future outlays, overhead (oversight and support services) costs, and operating costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dep.state.fl.us/waste/categories/fca/default.htm Solid Waste Full Cost Accounting], ''www.dep.state.fl.us'', Department of Environmental Protection, Florida, Accessed 24.11.06&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/muncpl/fullcost/index.htm Full Cost Accounting on Municipal Solid Waste Management at US-EPA], ''www.epa.gov'', US Environmental Protection Agency, Accessed 24.11.06&lt;/ref&gt;

Integrated solid waste management systems consist of a variety of [[municipal solid waste]] (MSW) activities and paths. Activities are the building blocks of the system, which may include [[waste collection]], operation of [[transfer station (waste management)|transfer station]]s, transport to [[list of solid waste treatment technologies|waste management facilities]], waste processing and disposal, and sale of byproducts. Paths are the directions that MSW follows in the course of integrated solid waste management (i.e., the point of generation through processing and ultimate disposition) and include [[recycling]], [[composting]], [[waste-to-energy]], and [[landfill]] disposal. The cost of some activities is shared between paths. Understanding the costs of MSW activities is often necessary for compiling the costs of the entire solid waste system, and helps municipalities evaluate whether to provide a service itself or contract out for it. However, in considering changes that affect how much MSW ends up being recycled, composted, converted to energy, or landfilled, the analyst should focus the costs of the different paths. Understanding the full costs of each MSW path is an essential first step in discussing whether to shift the flows of MSW one way another.

====Benefits====
; Identify the costs of MSW management : When municipalities handle MSW services through general [[tax fund]]s, the costs of MSW management can get lost among other expenditures. With FCA, managers can have more control over MSW costs because they know what the costs are.

; See through the peaks and valleys in MSW cash expenditures : Using techniques such as depreciation and [[amortization]], FCA produces a more accurate picture of the costs of MSW programs, without the distortions that can result from focusing solely on a given year's cash expenditures.

; Explain MSW costs to citizens more clearly : FCA helps you collect and compile the information needed to explain to citizens what solid waste management actually costs. Although some people might think that solid waste management is free (because they are not billed specifically for MSW services), others might overestimate its cost. FCA can result in "bottom line" numbers that speak directly to residents. In addition, public officials can use FCA results to respond to specific public concerns.

; Adopt a business-like approach to MSW management : By focusing attention on costs, FCA fosters a more businesslike approach to MSW management. Consumers of goods and services increasingly expect value, which means an appropriate balance between quality and cost of service. FCA can help identify opportunities for streamlining services, eliminating inefficiencies, and facilitating [[cost-saving]] efforts through informed planning and decision-making.

; Develop a stronger position in negotiating with vendors : When considering privatization of MSW services, solid waste managers can use FCA to learn what it costs (or would cost) to do the work. As a result, FCA better positions public agencies for negotiations and decision-making. FCA also can help communities with publicly run operations determine whether their costs are competitive with the private sector.

; Evaluate the appropriate mix of MSW services : FCA gives managers the ability to evaluate the cost of each element of their solid waste system, such as recycling, composting, waste-to-energy, and landfilling. FCA can help managers avoid common mistakes in thinking about solid waste management, notably the error of treating avoided costs as revenues.

; Fine-tune MSW programs : As more communities use FCA and report the results, managers might be able to "benchmark" their operations to similar communities or norms. This comparison can suggest options for "re-engineering" current operations. Furthermore, when cities, counties, and towns know what it costs to manage MSW independently, they can better identify any savings that might come from working together.

== Motives for adoption ==

Various motives for adoption of FCA/TCA have been identified.  The most significant of which tend to involve anticipating market or regulatory problems associated with ignoring the [[comprehensive outcome]] of the whole process or event accounted for.  ''In [[green economics]], this is the major concern and basis for critiques of such measures as [[GDP]].''  The [[public sector]] has tended to move more towards longer term measures to avoid accusations of political favoritism towards specific solutions that seem to make financial or economic sense in the short term, but not longer term.

Corporate decision makers sometimes call on FCA/TCA measures to decide whether to initiate [[Product recall|recalls]], practice voluntary [[product stewardship]] (a form of recall at the end of a product's useful life).  This can be motivated as a [[Hedge (finance)|hedge]] against future liabilities arising from those who are negatively affected by the waste a product becomes.  Advanced theories of FCA, such as [[Natural Step]], focus firmly on these.  According to [[Ray Anderson (entrepreneur)|Ray Anderson]], who instituted a form of FCA/TCA at Interface Carpet, used it to rule out decisions that increase [[Ecological Footprint]] and focus the company more clearly on a sustainable marketing strategy.

The [[urban ecology]] and [[industrial ecology]] approaches inherently advocate FCA&amp;nbsp;— treating the [[built environment]] as a sort of ecosystem to minimize its own wastes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41883">'''Failure mode and effects analysis''' ('''FMEA''')—also "'''failure modes'''", plural, in many  publications—was one of the first ''highly structured, systematic'' techniques for [[failure analysis]]. It was developed by [[Reliability engineering|reliability engineers]] in the late 1950s to study problems that might arise from malfunctions of military systems. An FMEA is often the first step of a system reliability study. It involves reviewing as many components, assemblies, and subsystems as possible to identify failure modes, and their causes and effects. For each component, the failure modes and their resulting effects on the rest of the system are recorded in a specific FMEA worksheet. There are numerous variations of such worksheets. An FMEA can be a qualitative analysis,&lt;ref&gt;System Reliability Theory: Models, Statistical Methods, and Applications, Marvin Rausand &amp; Arnljot Hoylan, Wiley Series in probability and statistics—second edition 2004, page 88&lt;/ref&gt; but may be put on a quantitative basis when mathematical [[failure rate]] models&lt;ref name="KMTay2"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Tay K. M.|author2=Lim C.P. | title=n On the use of fuzzy inference techniques in assessment models: part II: industrial applications |journal=Fuzzy Optimization and Decision Making  |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10700-008-9037-y |doi=10.1007/s10700-008-9037-y |volume=7 |pages=283–302}}&lt;/ref&gt; are combined with a statistical failure mode ratio database.

A few different types of FMEA analyses exist, such as:
* Functional
* Design
* Process

Sometimes FMEA is extended to [[FMECA]] (failure mode, effects, and criticality analysis) to indicate that criticality analysis is performed too.

FMEA is an [[inductive reasoning]] (forward logic) single point of failure analysis and is a core task in [[reliability engineering]], [[safety engineering]] and [[quality engineering]].

A successful FMEA activity helps identify potential failure modes based on experience with similar products and processes—or based on common physics of failure logic. It is widely used in development and manufacturing industries in various phases of the product life cycle. ''Effects analysis'' refers to studying the consequences of those failures on different system levels.

Functional analyses are needed as an input to determine correct failure modes, at all system levels, both for functional FMEA or Piece-Part (hardware) FMEA. An FMEA is used to structure Mitigation for Risk reduction based on either failure (mode) effect severity reduction or based on lowering the probability of failure or both. The FMEA is in principle a full inductive (forward logic) analysis, however the failure probability can only be estimated or reduced by understanding the ''failure mechanism''. Hence, FMEA may include information on causes of failure (deductive analysis) to reduce the possibility of occurrence by eliminating identified [[Root cause|''(root) causes'']].

== Introduction ==
The FME(C)A is a design tool used to systematically analyze postulated component failures and identify the resultant effects on system operations. The analysis is sometimes characterized as consisting of two sub-analyses, the first being the failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA), and the second, the criticality analysis (CA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

FMEAs can be performed at the system, subsystem, assembly, subassembly or part level. The [[FMECA]] should be a living document during development of a hardware design. It should be scheduled and completed concurrently with the design. If completed in a timely manner, the FMECA can help guide design decisions. The usefulness of the FMECA as a design tool and in the decision-making process is dependent on the effectiveness and timeliness with which design problems are identified. Timeliness is probably the most important consideration. In the extreme case, the FMECA would be of little value to the design decision process if the analysis is performed after the hardware is built. While the FMECA identifies all part failure modes, its primary benefit is the early identification of all critical and catastrophic subsystem or system failure modes so they can be eliminated or minimized through design modification at the earliest point in the development effort; therefore, the FMECA should be performed at the system level as soon as preliminary design information is available and extended to the lower levels as the detail design progresses.

Remark: For more complete scenario modelling another type of Reliability analysis may be considered, for example [[fault tree analysis]] (FTA); a ''deductive'' (backward logic) failure analysis that may handle multiple failures within the item and/or external to the item including maintenance and logistics. It starts at higher functional / system level. A FTA may use the basic failure mode FMEA records or an effect summary as one of its inputs (the basic events). Interface hazard analysis, Human error analysis and others may be added for completion in scenario modelling.

=== Functional Failure mode and effects analysis ===
The analysis may be performed at the functional level until the design has matured sufficiently to identify specific hardware that will perform the functions; then the analysis should be extended to the hardware level. When performing the hardware level FMECA, interfacing hardware is considered to be operating within specification. In addition, each part failure postulated is considered to be the only failure in the system (i.e., it is a single failure analysis). In addition to the FMEAs done on systems to evaluate the impact lower level failures have on system operation, several other FMEAs are done. Special attention is paid to interfaces between systems and in fact at all functional interfaces. The purpose of these FMEAs is to assure that irreversible physical and/or functional damage is not propagated across the interface as a result of failures in one of the interfacing units. These analyses are done to the piece part level for the circuits that directly interface with the other units. The FMEA can be accomplished without a CA, but a CA requires that the FMEA has previously identified system level critical failures. When both steps are done, the total process is called a FMECA.

=== Ground rules ===
The ground rules of each FMEA include a set of project selected procedures; the assumptions on which the analysis is based; the hardware that has been included and excluded from the analysis and the rationale for the exclusions. The ground rules also describe the indenture level of the analysis, the basic hardware status, and the criteria for system and mission success. Every effort should be made to define all ground rules before the FMEA begins; however, the ground rules may be expanded and clarified as the analysis proceeds. A typical set of ground rules (assumptions) follows:&lt;ref&gt;

# Only one failure mode exists at a time.
# All inputs (including software commands) to the item being analyzed are present and at nominal values.
# All consumables are present in sufficient quantities.
# Nominal power is available

=== Benefits ===
Major benefits derived from a properly implemented FMECA effort are as follows:

# It provides a documented method for selecting a design with a high probability of successful operation and safety.
# A documented uniform method of assessing potential failure mechanisms, failure modes and their impact on system operation, resulting in a list of failure modes ranked according to the seriousness of their system impact and likelihood of occurrence.
# Early identification of single failure points (SFPS) and system interface problems, which may be critical to mission success and/or safety. They also provide a method of verifying that switching between redundant elements is not jeopardized by postulated single failures.
# An effective method for evaluating the effect of proposed changes to the design and/or operational procedures on mission success and safety.
# A basis for in-flight troubleshooting procedures and for locating performance monitoring and fault-detection devices.
# Criteria for early planning of tests.

From the above list, early identifications of SFPS, input to the troubleshooting procedure and locating of performance monitoring / fault detection devices are probably the most important benefits of the FMECA. In addition, the FMECA procedures are straightforward and allow orderly evaluation of the design.

During the 1970s, use of FMEA and related techniques spread to other industries.

The automotive industry began to use FMEA by the mid 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Matsumoto|first=K.|year=1975|title=Reliability Analysis of Catalytic Converter as an Automotive Emission Control System|url=http://papers.sae.org/750178|journal=SAE Technical Paper 750178|doi=10.4271/750178|author2=T.

Goto|accessdate=2012-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ford Motor Company]] introduced FMEA to the automotive industry for safety and regulatory consideration after the [[Ford Pinto#Design flaws and ensuing lawsuits|Pinto affair]]. Ford applied the same approach to processes (PFMEA) to consider potential process induced failures prior to launching production. In 1993 the [[Automotive Industry Action Group]] (AIAG) first published an FMEA standard for the automotive industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Potential Failure Mode and Effect Analysis|last=AIAG|publisher=Automotive Industry Action Group|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now in its fourth edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.aiag.org/source/Orders/index.cfm?search=FMEA-4|title=Potential Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA), 4th Edition|last=AIAG|publisher=Automotive Industry Action Group|year=2008|isbn=9781605341361}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SAE first published related standard J1739 in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://standards.sae.org/j1739_199407/|title=Potential Failure Mode and Effects Analysis in Design (Design FMEA), Potential Failure Mode and Effects Analysis in Manufacturing and Assembly Processes (Process FMEA), and Potential Failure Mode and Effects Analysis for Machinery (Machinery FMEA)|last=SAE|publisher=SAE International|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; This standard is also now in its fourth edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://standards.sae.org/j1739_200208/|title=Potential Failure Mode and Effects Analysis in Design (Design FMEA) and Potential Failure Mode and Effects Analysis in Manufacturing and Assembly Processes (Process FMEA) and Effects Analysis for Machinery (Machinery FMEA)|last=SAE|publisher=SAE International|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although initially developed by the military, FMEA methodology is now extensively used in a variety of industries including semiconductor processing, food service, plastics, software, and healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=December 31, 2007|title=Performing Failure Mode and Effect Analysis|url=http://www.embeddedtechmag.com/component/content/article/6134|journal=Embedded Technology|first1=Erik|last1=Fadlovich|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117172649/http://www.embeddedtechmag.com/component/content/article/6134|archivedate=2011-11-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Toyota]] has taken this one step further with its [[Design Review Based on Failure Mode]] (DRBFM) approach. The method is now supported by the [[American Society for Quality]] which provides detailed guides on applying the method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asq.org/learn-about-quality/process-analysis-tools/overview/fmea.html|title=Failure Mode Effects Analysis (FMEA)|publisher=ASQ|accessdate=2012-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and Failure Modes, Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA)
procedures identify the product failure mechanisms, but may not model them without specialized software. This limits their applicability to provide a meaningful input to critical procedures such as virtual qualification, root cause analysis, accelerated test programs, and to remaining life assessment. To overcome the shortcomings of FMEA and FMECA a Failure Modes, Mechanisms and Effect Analysis (FMMEA) has often been used.

== Basic terms ==
The following covers some basic FMEA terminology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Langford |first1=J. W. |title=Logistics: Principles and Applications |publisher=McGraw Hill |year=1995 |page=488}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Failure
: The loss of a function under stated conditions.
;Failure mode
:The specific manner or way by which a failure occurs in terms of failure of the item (being a part or (sub) system) ''function'' under investigation; it may generally describe the way the failure occurs. It shall at least clearly describe a (end) failure state of the item (or function in case of a Functional FMEA) under consideration. It is the result of the failure mechanism (cause of the failure mode). ''For example; a fully fractured axle, a deformed axle or a fully open or fully closed electrical contact are each a separate failure mode of a DFMEA, they would not be failure modes of a PFMEA. Here you examine your process, so process step x - insert drill bit, the failure mode would be insert wrong drill bit, the effect of this is too big a hole or too small a hole.''
;Failure cause and/or mechanism
:Defects in requirements, design, process, quality control, handling or part application, which are the underlying cause or sequence of causes that initiate a process (mechanism) that leads to a failure mode over a certain time. A failure mode may have more causes. ''For example; "fatigue or corrosion of a structural beam" or "fretting corrosion in an electrical contact" is a failure mechanism and in itself (likely) not a failure mode. The related failure mode (end state) is a "full fracture of structural beam" or "an open electrical contact". The initial cause might have been "Improper application of corrosion protection layer (paint)" and /or "(abnormal) vibration input from another (possibly failed) system".
;Failure effect
:Immediate consequences of a failure on operation, function or functionality, or status of some item.
;Indenture levels (bill of material or functional breakdown)
:An identifier for system level and thereby item complexity. Complexity increases as levels are closer to one.
;Local effect
:The failure effect as it applies to the item under analysis.
;Next higher level effect
:The failure effect as it applies at the next higher indenture level.
;End effect
:The failure effect at the highest indenture level or total system.
;Detection
:The means of detection of the failure mode by maintainer, operator or built in detection system, including estimated dormancy period (if applicable) 
;Probability
:The likelihood of the failure occurring.
; Risk Priority Number (RPN)
:Severity (of the event) * Probability (of the event occurring) * Detection (Probability that the event would not be detected before the user was aware of it) 
;Severity
:The consequences of a failure mode. Severity considers the worst potential consequence of a failure, determined by the degree of injury, property damage, system damage and/or time lost to repair the failure.
;Remarks / mitigation / actions
:Additional info, including the proposed mitigation or actions used to lower a risk or justify a risk level or scenario.

=== Probability (P) ===
It is necessary to look at the cause of a failure mode and the likelihood of occurrence. This can be done by analysis, calculations / FEM, looking at similar items or processes and the failure modes that have been documented for them in the past. A failure cause is looked upon as a design weakness. All the potential causes for a failure mode should be identified and documented. This should be in technical terms. Examples of causes are: Human errors in handling, Manufacturing induced faults, Fatigue, Creep, Abrasive wear, erroneous algorithms, excessive voltage or improper operating conditions or use (depending on the used ground rules).
A failure mode is given a ''Probability Ranking''.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Rating
!Meaning
|-
| A
| Extremely Unlikely (Virtually impossible or No known occurrences on similar products or processes, with many running hours)
|-
| B
| Remote (relatively few failures)
|-
| C
| Occasional (occasional failures)
|-
| D
| Reasonably Possible (repeated failures)
|-
| E
| Frequent (failure is almost inevitable)
|}

=== Severity (S) ===
Determine the Severity for the worst-case scenario adverse end effect (state). It is convenient to write these effects down in terms of what the user might see or experience in terms of functional failures. Examples of these end effects are: full loss of function x, degraded performance, functions in reversed mode, too late functioning, erratic functioning, etc. Each end effect is given a Severity number (S) from, say, I (no effect) to V (catastrophic), based on cost and/or loss of life or quality of life. These numbers prioritize the failure modes (together with probability and detectability). Below a typical classification is given. Other classifications are possible. See also [[hazard analysis]].

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Rating
!Meaning
|-
| I
| No relevant effect on reliability or safety
|-
| II
| Very minor, no damage, no injuries, only results in a maintenance action (only noticed by discriminating customers)
|-
| III
| Minor, low damage, light injuries (affects very little of the system, noticed by average customer)

| Critical (causes a loss of primary function; Loss of all safety Margins, 1 failure away from a catastrophe, severe damage, severe injuries, max 1 possible death )
|-
| V
| Catastrophic (product becomes inoperative; the failure may result in complete unsafe operation and possible multiple deaths)
|}

=== Detection (D) ===
The means or method by which a failure is detected, isolated by operator and/or maintainer and the time it may take. This is important for maintainability control (availability of the system) and it is especially important for multiple failure scenarios. This may involve dormant failure ''modes'' (e.g. No direct system effect, while a redundant system / item automatically takes over or when the failure only is problematic during specific mission or system states) or latent failures (e.g. deterioration failure ''mechanisms'', like a metal growing crack, but not a critical length). It should be made clear how the failure mode or cause can be discovered by an operator under normal system operation or if it can be discovered by the maintenance crew by some diagnostic action or automatic built in system test. A dormancy and/or latency period may be entered.

=== Dormancy or Latency Period ===
The average time that a failure mode may be undetected may be entered if known. For example:

* Seconds, auto detected by maintenance computer
* 8 hours, detected by turn-around inspection
* 2 months, detected by scheduled maintenance block X
* 2 years, detected by overhaul task x

=== Indication ===
If the undetected failure allows the system to remain in a ''safe'' / working state, a second failure situation should be explored to determine whether or not an indication will be evident to all ''operators'' and what corrective action they may or should take.

Indications to the operator should be described as follows:

* Normal. An indication that is evident to an operator when the system or equipment is operating normally.
* Abnormal. An indication that is evident to an operator when the system has malfunctioned or failed.
* Incorrect. An erroneous indication to an operator due to the malfunction or failure of an indicator (i.e., instruments, sensing devices, visual or audible warning devices, etc.).

PERFORM DETECTION COVERAGE ANALYSIS FOR TEST PROCESSES AND MONITORING (From ARP4761 Standard):

This type of analysis is useful to determine how effective various test processes are at the detection of latent and dormant faults. The method used to accomplish this involves an examination of the applicable failure modes to determine whether or not their effects are detected, and to determine the percentage of failure rate applicable to the failure modes which are detected. The possibility that the detection means may itself fail latently should be accounted for in the coverage analysis as a limiting factor (i.e., coverage cannot be more reliable than the detection means availability). Inclusion of the detection coverage in the FMEA can lead to each individual failure that would have been one effect category now being a separate effect category due to the detection coverage possibilities. Another way to include detection coverage is for the FTA to conservatively assume that no holes in coverage due to latent failure in the detection method affect detection of all failures assigned to the failure effect category of concern. The FMEA can be revised if
necessary for those cases where this conservative assumption does not allow the top event probability requirements to be met.

After these three basic steps the Risk level may be provided.

=== Risk level (P*S) and (D) ===
'''Risk is the combination of End Effect Probability And Severity''' where probability and severity includes the effect on non-detectability ('''dormancy time'''). This may influence the end effect probability of failure or the worst case effect Severity. The exact calculation may not be easy in all cases, such as those where multiple scenarios (with multiple events) are possible and detectability / dormancy plays a crucial role (as for redundant systems). In that case Fault Tree Analysis and/or Event Trees may be needed to determine exact probability and risk levels.

Preliminary Risk levels can be selected based on a Risk Matrix like shown below, based on Mil. Std. 882.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.everyspec.com/MIL-STD/MIL-STD-0800-0899/MIL-STD-882E_41682/|title=MIL-STD-882 E SYSTEM SAFETY|website=www.everyspec.com|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The higher the Risk level, the more justification and mitigation is needed to provide evidence and lower the risk to an acceptable level. High risk should be indicated to higher level management, who are responsible for final decision-making.

* After this step the FMEA has become like a [[FMECA]].

== Timing ==
The FMEA should be updated whenever:
* A new cycle begins (new product/process)
* Changes are made to the operating conditions
* A change is made in the design
* New regulations are instituted
* Customer feedback indicates a problem

== Uses ==
* Development of system requirements that minimize the likelihood of failures.
* Development of designs and test systems to ensure that the failures have been eliminated or the risk is reduced to acceptable level.
* Development and evaluation of diagnostic systems
* To help with design choices (trade-off analysis).

== Advantages ==
{{Prose|section|date=January 2017}}
* Catalyst for teamwork and idea exchange between functions
* Collect information to reduce future failures, capture engineering knowledge
* Early identification and elimination of potential failure modes
* Emphasize problem prevention
* Improve company image and competitiveness
* Improve production yield
* Improve the quality, reliability, and safety of a product/process
* Increase user satisfaction
* Maximize profit
* Minimize late changes and associated cost
* Reduce impact on company profit margin
* Reduce system development time and cost
* Reduce the possibility of same kind of failure in future
* Reduce the potential for warranty concerns

== Limitations ==
While FMEA identifies important hazards in a system, its results may not be comprehensive and the approach has limitations.&lt;ref name="potts2014"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Potts H.W.W. |author2=Anderson J.E. |author3=Colligan L. |author4=Leach P. |author5=Davis S. |author6=Berman J. | title=Assessing the validity of prospective hazard analysis methods: A comparison of two techniques |journal=BMC Health Services Research |volume=14 |year=2014 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6963/14/41 |doi=10.1186/1472-6963-14-41 |pmid= |page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Franklin BD, Shebl NA, Barber N: "Failure mode and effects analysis: too little for too much?" BMJ Qual Saf 2012, 21: 607–611&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shebl NA, Franklin BD, Barber N: "Is failure mode and effect analysis reliable?" J Patient Saf 2009, 5: 86–94&lt;/ref&gt; In the healthcare context, FMEA and other risk assessment methods, including SWIFT ([[Structured What If Technique]]) and retrospective approaches, have been found to have limited validity when used in isolation. Challenges around scoping and organisational boundaries appear to be a major factor in this lack of validity.&lt;ref name="potts2014" /&gt;

If used as a [[Top-down and bottom-up design|top-down]] tool, FMEA may only identify major failure modes in a system. [[Fault tree analysis|Fault tree analysis (FTA)]] is better suited for "top-down" analysis. When used as a "bottom-up" tool FMEA can augment or complement FTA and identify many more causes and failure modes resulting in top-level symptoms. It is not able to discover complex failure modes involving multiple failures within a subsystem, or to report expected failure intervals of particular failure modes up to the upper level subsystem or system.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

Additionally, the multiplication of the severity, occurrence and detection rankings may result in rank reversals, where a less serious failure mode receives a higher RPN than a more serious failure mode.&lt;ref name='Kmenta2004-11'&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1115/1.1799614 |title=Scenario-Based Failure Modes and Effects Analysis Using Expected Cost |year=2004 |last1=Kmenta |first1=Steven |last2=Ishii |first2=Koshuke |journal=Journal of Mechanical Design |volume=126 |issue=6 |page=1027}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this is that the rankings are [[ordinal scale]] numbers, and multiplication is not defined for ordinal numbers. The ordinal rankings only say that one ranking is better or worse than another, but not by how much. For instance, a ranking of "2" may not be twice as severe as a ranking of "1," or an "8" may not be twice as severe as a "4," but multiplication treats them as though they are. See [[Level of measurement]] for further discussion. Various solutions to this problems have been proposed, e.g., the use of [[fuzzy logic]] as an alternative to classic RPN model.&lt;ref name="KMTay"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jee T.L. |author2=Tay K.

Process FMEA can be challenging for participants who have not completed many PFMEAS, often confusing FAILURE MODES with EFFECTS and CAUSES.  To clarify, a Process FMEA shows how the process can go wrong.  Using a detailed Process Map will aid the person filling in the worksheet to correctly list the steps of the process being reviewed.  The FAILURE MODE is then simply how that step can go wrong.  Example, Process Step 1. Pick Up right handed part.  Can they pick up the wrong part? (some manufacturing centers have left and right handed parts etc.)  FAILURE MODE put left hand part in, EFFECT could be wrecked CNC machine and scrapped part, or hole drilled in wrong location.  The cause, keeping inventory of similar parts at the job.  Why is it important to do a PFMEA with regard to the process?  When a process is examined or if we ask what can go wrong with the process unknown issues are uncovered, solving problems before they occur and tackling root cause issues or at least 2 Y's deep on a 5 Y.  Here the manufacturing engineer could possibly poke yoke the tooling to prevent a left handed part in the fixture when running the right handed parts or program a touch off probe in the CNC programming - all before ever making the mistake the first time.  If a PFMEA is set up where the FAILURE MODE relates to the feature on the print, example FAILURE MODE drilled hole too big - no further understanding of what caused the problem is gained.  Numerous PFMEA's have been examined and show that little to no value is gained when reviewing features off of a print as FAILURE MODES - little understanding of the cause is gained.  New PFMEA practitioners often try to relate the PFMEA FAILURE MODE to the FEATURE, numerous authors list this as trying to inspect in quality rather than listing the process step determining how it can go wrong and building in quality through root cause evaluation.

Besides, two shortcomings are
# complexity of the FMEA worksheet;
# intricacy of its use. Entries in an FMEA worksheet are voluminous.

The FMEA worksheet is hard to produce, hard to understand and read, as well as hard to maintain. The use of neural network techniques to cluster and visualise failure modes were suggested, recently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Tay K.M. |author2=Jong C.H. |author3=Lim C.P. | title=A clustering-based failure mode and effect analysis model and its application to the edible bird nest industry |journal=Neural Computing and Applications |volume=26|year=2015|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00521-014-1647-4|doi=10.1007/s00521-014-1647-4 |pages=  551–560}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chang|first1=Wui Lee  |last2=Tay|first2=Kai Meng |last3=Lim |first3=Chee Peng|date=Nov 2015|title=Clustering and visualization of failure modes using an evolving tree|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417415002729|journal=Expert Systems with Applications|volume=42 |pages=7235–7244 |doi=10.1016/j.eswa.2015.04.036}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chang|first1=Wui Lee  |last2=Pang|first2=Lie Meng |last3=Tay |first3=Kai Meng|date=March 2017|title=Application of Self-Organizing Map to Failure Modes and Effects Analysis Methodology|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231217305702|journal=Neurocomputing|volume=PP|pages=PP |doi=10.1016/j.neucom.2016.04.073}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
*'''Functional''': before design solutions are provided (or only on high level) functions can be evaluated on potential functional failure effects. General Mitigations ("design to" requirements) can be proposed to limit consequence of functional failures or limit the probability of occurrence in this early development. It is based on a functional breakdown of a system. This type may also be used for Software evaluation.
*'''Concept Design / Hardware''': analysis of systems or subsystems in the early design concept stages to analyse the failure mechanisms and lower level functional failures, specially to different concept solutions in more detail. It may be used in trade-off studies.
*'''Detailed Design / Hardware''': analysis of products prior to production. These are the most detailed (in mil 1629 called Piece-Part or Hardware FMEA) FMEAs and used to identify any possible hardware (or other) failure mode up to the lowest part level. It should be based on hardware breakdown (e.g. the BoM = Bill of Material). Any Failure effect Severity, failure Prevention (Mitigation), Failure Detection and Diagnostics may be fully analyzed in this FMEA.
*'''Process''': analysis of manufacturing and assembly processes. Both quality and reliability may be affected from process faults. The input for this FMEA is amongst others a work process / task Breakdown.

{{Refimprove|Strong claims like 'must come from' should be referenced and qualified.|date=May 2010}}

A '''fair trade certification''' is a [[product certification]] within the market-based [[social movement|movement]] [[fair trade]]. The most widely used fair trade certification is [[FLO International]]'s, the [[International Fairtrade Certification Mark]], used in [[Europe]], [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]. [[Fair Trade Certified Mark]] is the North American equivalent of the International Fairtrade Certification Mark.  As of January 2011, there were over 1000 companies certified to the FLO International's certification and a further 1000 or so certified to other ethical and fairtrade certification schemes around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekobai.org/search/profiles/1522/list-of-companies-with-fairtrade] List of Companies certified to FLO International's fairtrade certification&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fairtrade International certification system covers a wide range of products, including banana, coffee, cocoa, cotton, cane sugar, flowers and plants, honey, dried fruit, fruit juices, herbs, spices, tea, nuts and vegetables.&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, K. (2012). ''Is my Fair Trade coffee really fair? Trends and Challenges in Fair Trade certification. Center for Global Development, Policy Paper, pp.17.''&lt;/ref&gt; These commodities have different locations of production and number of farmers and workers covered for production and distribution.

==How it works==
Fair trade is a strategy for poverty alleviation and sustainable development, aiming at creating greater equity in the international trading system. Through trading partnerships with marginalised farmers and craftspeople in developing countries, social and economic opportunities are created for these producers in a way that more customers are accessible to their products and a better deal is issued.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtradefederation.org, (2014). ''Fair Trade Federation : What is Fair Trade?.'' [online] Available at: https://www.fairtradefederation.org/what-is-fair-trade/ [Accessed 19 Oct. 2014].&lt;/ref&gt; In return, the producers have to comply with all the standards laid down by [[Fairtrade International]].

In reality, packers in developed countries pay a fee to the Fairtrade organisation for the right to use the Fairtrade certification logo. Importers of fairtrade certified products are required to pay exporters a price higher than the market price of non-fairtrade certified products, so as to cover the additional costs used by Fairtrade certified firms in marketing and inspection. Any surplus after paying these costs must be used for local social, environmental and economic projects &lt;ref&gt;Info.fairtrade.net, (2014). ''Fairtrade Info / Home / What is Fairtrade? / How Fairtrade Works.'' [online] Available at: http://info.fairtrade.net/info-how-fairtrade-works.0.html [Accessed 24 Oct. 2014].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fairtrade Standards==
[[File:FairtradeCertifiedCottonTShirt.jpg|thumb|275px|right|A T-shirt made from Fairtrade certified cotton.]]
Fairtrade Standards are designed to aid the sustainable development of some smaller producers and agricultural workers in [[third world countries]]. In order to become certified Fairtrade producers, the cooperatives and their fellow farmers have to strictly comply with the standards laid down by Fairtrade International.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade.net, (2014). ''Fairtrade International / Standards / Aims of Fairtrade standards.'' [online] Available at: http://www.fairtrade.net/aims-of-fairtrade-standards.html [Accessed 25 Oct. 2014].)&lt;/ref&gt; FLO-CERT, the for-profit side, is responsible for inspecting and certifying producer organizations in more than 70 countries in Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin America.

The general standards set for different stakeholders are listed as follows:

===Small Producer Organizations===
* The majority of the members of the organization must be small-scale producers who do not highly depend on hired workers, but run their farm mainly by their own effort.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade Standard for Small Producer Organizations. (2005). Bonn, Germany: Fairtrade International, pp.7.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Any profits earned must be equally distributed among the producers. 
* Every member in the organisation should have the right to vote in the decision-making process.

===Hired Labour===
* Workers possess the right to join an independent union to [[collective bargaining|collectively bargain]] their working conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Strong Producers, Strong Future. (2014). Bonn, Germany: Fairtrade International, pp.8.&lt;/ref&gt;
* No forced or child labour 
* Working conditions have to be equitable for all workers. Salaries must be at least equal or higher than the [[minimum wage]] in effect. 
* Safety and health measures must be implemented properly so as to avoid unwanted injuries at work.

===Trade Standards===
* Pay a price higher than the Fairtrade Minimum Price in order to cover the costs of sustainable production.
* Pay an additional amount of money that allows producers to invest in development : the Fairtrade Premium.
* Sign contracts that assist long-term planning and sustainable production practices.

==Fairtrade Pricing==
The Fairtrade system mainly consists of two types of pricing, which are the Minimum Price and the Premium. These are paid to the exporters according to the proportion of output companies are able to sell with the brand ‘Fairtrade Certified’, typically ranging from 17% to up to 60% of their turnover in some cases.

* The '''Fairtrade Minimum Price''' is a guaranteed price, as well as the minimum price, that must be paid by buyers to Fairtrade Certified producers. It is a floor price that covers producers’ average cost of production, aiming at protecting producers from selling their products underpriced.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade.net, (2014). ''Fairtrade International / About / What is Fairtrade?.'' [online] Available at: http://www.fairtrade.net/what-is-fairtrade.html [Accessed 26 Oct. 2014].&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''Fairtrade Premium''' is a sum of money which is paid on top of the payment for the products. Its use is restricted to investment in the producers’ business, livelihood, and the socio-economic development of the workers. The producers have the largest power deciding how these funds are to be spent.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade Minimum Price And Fairtrade Premium Table. (2014). Bonn, Germany: Fairtrade International, pp.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==How fairtrade measures its impact==
The Fairtrade system has committed to a programme of Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (MEL), which aims at generating recommendations and analysis in support of greater effectiveness and impact. Ongoing market progress is monitored by market-facing organizations present in countries where Fairtrade certified products are sold; market data is consolidated by Fairtrade International on an annual basis. These data are gathered to form a core basis for the understanding of the dynamics of how certification is developing, and how the impacts of Fairtrade are being distributed between producer organizations, geographies and products.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade.org.uk, (2014). ''How Fairtrade monitors and measures impact''. [online] Available at: http://www.fairtrade.org.uk/en/what-is-fairtrade/the-impact-of-our-work/how-fairtrade-monitors-and-measures-impact [Accessed 24 Oct. 2014].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade.org.uk, (2014). ''How Fairtrade monitors and measures impact.'' [online] Available at: http://www.fairtrade.org.uk/en/what-is-fairtrade/the-impact-of-our-work/how-fairtrade-monitors-and-measures-impact [Accessed 25 Oct. 2014].&lt;/ref&gt;

Fairtrade’s governance bodies also review key results and evaluate regularly in order to improve strategy and decision-making. These results are publicised within staff throughout the Fairtrade system and relevant stakeholders for further discussion of findings and recommendations.

==Criticisms==

===Little money reaches the farmers===
[[The Fairtrade Foundation]] does not monitor how much of the extra amount of money paid to exporters reaches the farmers. As the cooperatives incur relatively heavy fees on inspection, certification and marketing, only a small amount of money is retained for the farmers.&lt;ref&gt;The Globe and Mail, (2014). ''Fairtrade coffee fails to help the poor, British report finds.'' [online] Available at: https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/international-business/fairtrade-coffee-fails-to-help-the-poor-british-report-finds/article18852585/ [Accessed 27 Oct. 2014].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marsden, R. (2014). ''Fairtrade 'fails to help poor farmers', says damning investigation.'' [online] Mail Online. Available at: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2639135/Fairtrade-fails-help-poor-farmers-Damning-investigation-says-profits-sent-help-Uganda-Ethiopia-not-reach-workforce.html [Accessed 25 Oct. 2014].&lt;/ref&gt; In general, Fairtrade producers are only able to sell 18% to 37% of their output as Fairtrade certified over years, while the rest are sold as uncertified at the market prices.

===Fairtrade helps the rich to a larger extent===
Fair Trade is profitable for traders in rich countries rather than that in poor countries. In order to qualify as Fairtrade producers, cooperatives must meet the strict standards set by Fairtrade International, implying that their fellow farmers must be quite skilful and educated. However, it is criticised that these farmers are predominantly from poorest countries, thus lacking the power to bargain with the cooperatives. Corruption even occurs in some cases.&lt;ref&gt;Sylla, N. (2014). ''Fairtrade is an unjust movement that serves the rich | Ndongo Samba Sylla. [online] the Guardian. Available at: https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/sep/05/fairtrade-unjust-movement-serves-rich [Accessed 26 Oct. 2014].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inefficient marketing system===
There have been complaints that Fairtrade certified products should not be sold through a [[monopsonist]] cooperative because it may be inefficient and corruption easily takes place. Fairtrade farmers should have the right to choose the buyer who offers the best price, or switch when their cooperatives are going bankrupt &lt;ref&gt;Mendoza, R., &amp; J. Bastiaensen, J. (2003). ''Fair Trade and the Coffee Crisis in the Nicaraguan Segovias. Small Enterprise Development, 14(2), pp. 42)''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other certification and product labelings==
* The [[Fair Trade Federation]] does not certify individual products, but instead evaluates an entire business.
* The FTO Mark, launched in 2004 by [[World Fair Trade Organization]], and identifies registered fair trade organizations.
* [[UTZ Certified|UTZ CERTIFIED]] is a coffee certification program that has sometimes been dubbed "[[Fairtrade]] lite" &lt;ref name="Conroy, Michael 2007 pp.252"&gt;Conroy, Michael (2007). Branded! p252&lt;/ref&gt;
* [http://www.counterculturecoffee.com/ Counter Culture Direct Trade Certification] is a [[direct trade]] alternative to the [[Fairtrade certification]].
* [[Whole Trade Guarantee#Whole Trade Guarantee|Whole Trade Guarantee]], a purchasing initiative launched in 2007 by [[Whole Foods Market]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2007/04/02/fairs-fair-at-whole-foods.aspx Fair's Fair at Whole Foods] The Motley Fool, April 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a [[Hausdorff space]] ''X'' is called a '''fixed-point space''' if every [[continuous function]]  &lt;math&gt;f:X\rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; has a [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]].

For example, any closed interval [a,b] in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; is a fixed point space, and it can be proved from the intermediate value property of real continuous function. The [[open interval]] (''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''), however, is not a fixed point space. To see it, consider the function 
&lt;math&gt;f(x) = a + \frac{1}{b-a}\cdot(x-a)^2&lt;/math&gt;, for example. 

Any [[linearly ordered]] space that is connected and has a top and a bottom element is a fixed point space. 

Note that, in the definition, we could easily have disposed of the condition that the space is Hausdorff.

'''Graphic violence''' is the depiction of especially vivid, brutal and realistic acts of [[violence in the media|violence]] in visual media such as [[literature]], [[film]], [[television]], and [[video game]]s. It may be real, simulated [[live action]], or [[animated]].

The "graphic" in graphic violence is a synonym for "explicit", referring to the clear and unabashed nature of the violence portrayed; this is what differentiates true graphic violence from lesser forms of violence in media productions, including "real" violence, "cartoon" violence and "fantasy" violence.

==Media==
Graphic violence generally consists of any clear and uncensored depiction of various violent acts. Commonly included depictions include murder, assault with a deadly weapon, accidents which result in death or severe injury, suicide, and torture. In all cases, it is the explicitness of the violence and the injury inflicted which results in it being labeled "graphic". In fictional depictions, appropriately realistic plot elements are usually included to heighten the sense of realism (i.e. [[Blood squirt|blood effects]], [[Troy weapon|prop weapon]]s, [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]]). In order to qualify for the "graphic" designation, the violence depicted must generally be of a particularly unmitigated and unshielded nature; an example would be a video of a man being shot by me, bleeding from the wound, and crumpling to the ground calling for his mother.

Graphic violence arouses strong emotions, ranging from titillation and excitement to utter revulsion and even terror, depending on the mindset of the viewer and the method in which it is presented. A certain degree of graphic violence has become ''de rigueur'' in adult "action" genre, and it is presented in an amount and manner carefully deliberated to excite the emotions of the target demographic without inducing disgust or revulsion. Even more extreme and grotesque acts of graphic violence (generally revolving around mutilation) are often used in the horror genre in order to inspire even stronger emotions of fear and shock (which the viewing demographic would presumably be seeking).

It is a highly controversial topic. Many believe that exposure to graphic violence leads to [[desensitization (psychology)|desensitization]] to committing acts of violence in person. It has led to [[censorship]] in extreme cases, and regulation in others. One notable case was the creation of the US [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]] in 1994. Many nations now require varying degrees of approval from television, movie, and software rating boards before a work can be released to the public.

On the other hand, some critics claim that watching violent media content can be cathartic, providings "acceptable outlets for anti-social impulses."&lt;ref name="bruder"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gradnet.de/papers/pomo2.archives/pomo98.papers/mtbruder98.htm |title= Aestheticizing Violence, or How To Do Things with Style |accessdate=2007-06-08 |last= Bruder |first= Margaret Ervin |year= 1998 |publisher= Film Studies, Indiana University, Bloomington IN |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20040908094032/http://www.gradnet.de/papers/pomo2.archives/pomo98.papers/mtbruder98.htm |archivedate= 2004-09-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
Graphic violence is used frequently in [[horror film|horror]], [[action film|action]], and [[crime film]]s. Several of these films were banned from certain countries for their violence. The [[snuff film]] takes horror to its furthest extreme as [[torture]] and murder are not simulated.

Violence in films is not an old topic, recently a study presented in an annual American Academy of Pediatrics conference showed that the "good guys" in superhero movies were on average more violent than the villains, potentially sending a strongly negative message to young viewers.[https://www.thenewstribe.com/2018/11/03/good-guys-more-violent-than-bad-ones-in-superhero-films-study/] 

==News media==
[[News media]] on television and online video frequently cover violent acts. The coverage may be preceded with a warning, stating that the footage may be disturbing to some viewers.

Sometimes graphic images are censored, by blurring or blocking a portion of the image, cutting the violent portions out of an image sequence or by removing certain portions of film footage from viewing. However, more and more throughout the years, it has been a ploy for media companies to attract more and more viewers by trivializing various events like the ones mentioned above for shock appeal.

==Music videos==
Graphic and gory violence has started appearing in [[music video]]s in recent times, an example being the controversial music video for the song "[[Rock DJ]]" by British rock vocalist [[Robbie Williams]], which features self-mutilation. Another example of a music video containing strong violence is the music video for the song "[[Hurricane (Thirty Seconds to Mars song)|Hurricane]]" by American rock band [[Thirty Seconds to Mars]] and "[[Happiness in Slavery]]" by American industrial rock group [[Nine Inch Nails]]. The music video for "[[Monolith of Inhumanity|Forced Gender Reassignment]]" by American [[deathgrind]] band [[Cattle Decapitation]] displays such intense graphic violence that it is not hosted by many popular video hosting sites like [[YouTube]] and [[Dailymotion]] and is only hosted by [[Bloody Disgusting]].

==Video games==
Violent content has been a central part of [[video game controversy]]. Because violence in video games is interactive and not passive, critics such as [[Dave Grossman (author)|Dave Grossman]] and [[Jack Thompson (attorney)|Jack Thompson]] argue that violence in games hardens children to unethical acts, calling [[first-person shooter]] games "murder simulators", although no conclusive evidence has supported this belief.

An example is the display of "[[Gib (video gaming)|gibs]]" (short for giblets&lt;ref&gt;Mahood, Andy, [http://uk.pc.gamespy.com/pc/half-life-2/682881p1.html Modify - Issue 12: Half-Life 2 on Steroids (PC)] ''GameSpy'', Jan. 26, 2006, Retrieved on Feb 27 2008&lt;/ref&gt;), little bits or giant chunks of [[internal organ]]s, [[flesh]], and [[bone]], when a character is killed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.pc.ign.com/mail/1999-07-28.html Reply to Letter to the Editor], ''IGN'', Jul 28, 1999, Retrieved Feb 27 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internet==
On the internet, several sites dedicated to recordings of real graphic violence, referred to as "gore", exist, such as [[Bestgore.com]] and [[Goregrish.com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://globalnews.ca/news/1617578/luka-magnottas-gore-video-why-is-the-court-seeing-it/ |title=Luka Magnotta’s gore video: Why is the court seeing it? |last1=Minsky |first1=Amy|date=16 October 2014 |website= |publisher= |access-date=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/luka-magnotta-trial-jury-watches-infamous-video-1.2800822 |title=Luka Magnotta trial: Jury watches 'infamous' video |last1=Shivji|first1=Salimah |date=16 October 2014 |website= |publisher= |access-date=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, many content-aggregator sites such as [[Reddit]] or [[imageboard]]s and [[4chan]] have their own subsites which are dedicated to or allow that kind of content. Some of those sites also require that gore material to be marked as it, often by the [[internet slang]] "[[Not safe for life|NSFL]]" ([[shorthand]] for "not safe for life"). This kind of media might depict reality footage of war, car crashes and other accidents, decapitations, suicide, terrorism, murder, or executions. &lt;!-- [[LiveLeak]] --&gt;

'''Harlan Lane''' (born 19 August 1936) is an American psychologist. Lane is the Matthews Distinguished University Professor of [[Psychology]] at [[Northeastern University (Boston, Massachusetts)|Northeastern University]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], in the [[United States]], and founder of the Center for Research in Hearing, Speech, and Language {{citation needed|date=April 2018}}. His research is focused on speech, [[Deaf culture]], and [[sign language]]. 

Lane was born in Brooklyn, New York.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, Harlan, Ben Bahan, and Bob Hoffmeister. 1996. ''A Journey into the Deaf-World''. San Diego, C.A.: DawnSignPress, 1996. {{ISBN|0915035634}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Remaining in New York City for college, he obtained both a B.S. and an M.S. in Psychology from Columbia University in 1958. He subsequently received a PhD. in Psychology from Harvard (1960) and a ''Doc. des Lettres'' from the [[Sorbonne]] (1973).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harlan Lane, Psychologist and Linguist|url=https://www.macfound.org/fellows/438/|website=MacArthur Fellows Program|publisher=MacArthur Foundation|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, Lane received a [[MacArthur Foundation Fellowship]].&lt;ref name="northeastern"&gt;Lane, Harlan.

Lane, a hearing man, has become an often controversial spokesman for the [[Deaf community]] and critic of [[cochlear implants]]. He has written extensively on the [[social construction of disability]] and states that "Unless Deaf people challenge the culturally determined meanings of ''deaf'' and ''disability'' with at least as much vigor as the technologies of normalization seek to institutionalize those meanings, the day will continue to recede in which Deaf children and adults live the fullest lives and make the fullest contribution to our diverse society."&lt;ref&gt;Lane, Harlan. 2008.

'''''Heart Beacon''''' is an outdoor 2013 sculpture by American artists Blessing Hancock and Joe O'Connell, installed at the Bureau of Emergency Management's Emergency Coordination Center in [[Portland, Oregon]], United States. 

==Description==
''Heart Beacon'', installed at the Emergency Coordination Center (3732 Southeast 99th Avenue or 9911 Southeast Bush Street) in Portland's [[Powellhurst-Gilbert, Portland, Oregon|Powellhurst-Gilbert]] neighborhood, has been described as a "pulsing blue egg"; the artists have called it an "interactive enclosure of light, color and sound that senses and artistically displays the heartbeat of visitors".&lt;ref name=RACC&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Art Search: Heart Beacon|url=http://racc.org/public-art/search/?recid=3266.26|publisher=[[Regional Arts &amp; Culture Council]]|accessdate=September 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WW&gt;{{cite news|title=Murmurs: News That Doesn't Know When to Quit.|url=http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-21137-murmurs_news_that_doesnt_know_when_to_quit.html|accessdate=September 4, 2015|work=[[Willamette Week]]|date=September 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is made of [[stainless steel]], acrylic panels, and electrical components, and measures 18' 1 7/8" x 10' 5". The sculpture cost $220,333 and was funded by the city's Percent for Art program.&lt;ref name=RACC/&gt;&lt;ref name=WW/&gt; According to the [[Regional Arts &amp; Culture Council]], which administers the work, ''Heart Beacon'' "takes the literal and metamorphic 'pulse'" of Portland's community and serves as a "symbol of hope and a potent reminder of the resilience of the individual taking inspiration from the life-saving mission" of the center. &lt;ref name=RACC/&gt;

Stars tend to fall only into certain regions of the diagram.

In the lower-left is where [[white dwarf]]s are found, and above the main sequence are the [[subgiant]]s, [[giant stars|giant]]s and [[supergiant]]s.

The '''Hertzsprung–Russell diagram''', abbreviated as '''H–R diagram''', '''HR diagram''' or '''HRD''', is a [[scatter plot]] of [[star]]s showing the relationship between the stars' [[absolute magnitude]]s or [[luminosity|luminosities]] versus their [[stellar classification]]s or [[effective temperature]]s. More simply, it plots each star on a graph plotting the star's brightness against its temperature (color).

The diagram was created circa 1910 by [[Ejnar Hertzsprung]] and [[Henry Norris Russell]] and represents a major step towards an understanding of [[stellar evolution]].

The related '''colour–magnitude diagram''' (CMD) plots the [[apparent magnitude]]s of stars against their colour, usually for a cluster so that the stars are all at the same distance.

==Historical background==
In the nineteenth-century large-scale photographic spectroscopic surveys of stars were performed at [[Harvard College Observatory]], producing spectral classifications for tens of thousands of stars, culminating ultimately in the [[Henry Draper Catalogue]].  In one segment of this work [[Antonia Maury]] included divisions of the stars by the width of their [[spectral line]]s.&lt;ref name=HCAn28&gt;{{cite journal | author1=A.C. Maury | author2=E.C. Pickering | journal=Annals of Harvard College Observatory | volume=28 | pages=1–128 | date=1897 | title=Spectra of bright stars photographed with the 11-inch Draper Telescope as part of the Henry Draper Memorial |bibcode = 1897AnHar..28....1M }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hertzsprung noted that stars described with narrow lines tended to have smaller [[proper motion]]s than the others of the same spectral classification.  He took this as an indication of greater luminosity for the narrow-line stars, and computed [[Stellar parallax#Other baselines|secular parallaxes]] for several groups of these, allowing him to estimate their absolute magnitude.&lt;ref name=Hertzsprung1909&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hertzprung | first=Ejnar | journal=Astronomische Nachrichten | volume=179 | issue=24 | pages=373–380 | date=1908 | title=Über die Sterne der Unterabteilung ''c'' und ''ac'' nach der Spektralklassifikation von Antonia C. Maury | bibcode=1909AN....179..373H | doi=10.1002/asna.19081792402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910 Hans Rosenberg published a diagram plotting the apparent magnitude of stars in the Pleiades cluster against the strengths of the [[calcium K line]] and two [[hydrogen]] [[Balmer line]]s.&lt;ref name=rosenberg/&gt;  These spectral lines serve as a proxy for the temperature of the star, an early form of spectral classification.  The apparent magnitude of stars in the same cluster is equivalent to their absolute magnitude and so this early diagram was effectively a plot of luminosity against temperature.  The same type of diagram is still used today as a means of showing the stars in clusters without having to initially know their distance and luminosity.&lt;ref name=cluster&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1088/0004-637X/775/2/134| title = The Ages of 95 Globular Clusters as Determined Using an Improved &lt;math&gt;\Delta V^{HB}_{TO}&lt;/math&gt; Method Along with Color-Magnitude Diagram Constraints, and Their Implications for Broader Issues| journal = The Astrophysical Journal| volume = 775| issue = 2| pages = 134| year = 2013| last1 = Vandenberg | first1 = D.

This was also the form of the diagram using apparent magnitudes of a cluster of stars all at the same distance.&lt;ref name=hertzsprung&gt;Hertzsprung, E., 1911, Uber die Verwendung Photographischer Eﬀektiver Wellenlaengen zur Bestimmung von Farbenaequivalenten, Publikationen des Astrophysikalischen Observatoriums zu Potsdam, 22.

Russell's early (1913) versions of the diagram included Maury's giant stars identified by Hertzsprung, those nearby stars with parallaxes measured at the time, stars from the [[Hyades (star cluster)|Hyades]] (a nearby [[open cluster]]), and several [[moving groups]], for which the [[moving cluster method]] could be used to derive distances and thereby obtain absolute magnitudes for those stars.&lt;ref name=Russ1914PA&gt;{{cite journal | last=Russell | first=Henry Norris | journal=Popular Astronomy | volume=22 | pages=275–294 | date=1914 | title=Relations Between the Spectra and Other Characteristics of the Stars | bibcode=1914PA.....22..275R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forms of diagram==
There are several forms of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, and the [[nomenclature]] is not very well defined.  All forms share the same general layout: stars of greater luminosity are toward the top of the diagram, and stars with higher surface temperature are toward the left side of the diagram.

The original diagram displayed the spectral type of stars on the horizontal axis and the [[absolute magnitude|absolute visual magnitude]] on the vertical axis.  The spectral type is not a numerical quantity, but the sequence of spectral types is a [[monotonic function|monotonic series]] that reflects the stellar surface temperature.  Modern observational versions of the chart replace spectral type by a [[color index]] (in diagrams made in the middle of the 20th Century, most often the [[B-V color]]) of the stars.  This type of diagram is what is often called an observational Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, or specifically a color–magnitude diagram (CMD), and it is often used by observers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.e-education.psu.edu/astro801/content/l4_p6.html |title=The Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram |last=Palma |first=Dr. Christopher |date=2016 |website=ASTRO 801: Planets, Stars, Galaxies, and the Universe |publisher=John A. Dutton e-Education Institute: College of Earth and Mineral Sciences: The Pennsylvania State University |access-date=2017-01-29 |quote=The quantities that are easiest to measure... are color and magnitude, so most observers ... refer to the diagram as a 'Color–Magnitude diagram' or 'CMD' rather than an HR diagram. }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In cases where the stars are known to be at identical distances such as within a star cluster, a color–magnitude diagram is often used to describe the stars of the cluster with a plot in which the vertical axis is the [[apparent magnitude]] of the stars. For cluster members, by assumption there is a single additive constant difference between their apparent and absolute magnitudes, called the [[distance modulus]], for all of that cluster of stars.  Early studies of nearby open clusters (like the Hyades and [[Pleiades]]) by Hertzsprung and Rosenberg produced the first CMDs, antedating by a few years Russell's influential synthesis of the diagram collecting data for all stars for which absolute magnitudes could be determined.&lt;ref name=rosenberg&gt;{{cite journal | last=Rosenberg | first=Hans | journal=Astronomische Nachrichten | volume=186 | issue=5 | pages=71–78 | date=1910| title=Über den Zusammenhang von Helligkeit und Spektraltypus in den Plejaden | bibcode=1910AN....186...71R |doi = 10.1002/asna.19101860503 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hertzsprung/&gt;

Another form of the diagram plots the [[effective temperature|effective surface temperature]] of the star on one axis and the luminosity of the star on the other, almost invariably in a [[log-log plot]].  Theoretical calculations of [[stellar structure]] and the [[Stellar evolution#Models|evolution of stars]] produce plots that match those from observations. This type of diagram could be called ''temperature-luminosity diagram'', but this term is hardly ever used; when the distinction is made, this form is called the ''theoretical Hertzsprung–Russell diagram'' instead.  A peculiar characteristic of this form of the H–R diagram is that the temperatures are plotted from high temperature to low temperature, which aids in comparing this form of the H–R diagram with the observational form.

Although the two types of diagrams are similar, astronomers make a sharp distinction between the two.  The reason for this distinction is that the exact transformation from one to the other is not trivial.  To go between effective temperature and color requires a [[Color temperature#Color temperature in astronomy|color–temperature relation]], and constructing that is difficult; it is known to be a function of [[stellar chemistry|stellar composition]] and can be affected by other factors like [[stellar rotation]].  When converting luminosity or absolute [[bolometric magnitude]] to apparent or absolute visual magnitude, one requires a [[bolometric correction]], which may or may not come from the same source as the color–temperature relation.  One also needs to know the distance to the observed objects (''i.e.'', the distance modulus) and the effects of [[Extinction (astronomy)|interstellar obscuration]], both in the color (reddening) and in the apparent magnitude (where the effect is called "extinction").  Color distortion (including reddening) and extinction (obscuration) are also apparent in stars having significant [[circumstellar dust]].  The ideal of direct comparison of theoretical predictions of stellar evolution to observations thus has additional uncertainties incurred in the conversions between theoretical quantities and observations.

==Interpretation==
[[File:HR-diag-instability-strip.svg|thumb|An HR diagram with the [[instability strip]] and its components highlighted.]]
Most of the stars occupy the region in the diagram along the line called the [[main sequence]]. During the stage of their lives in which stars are found on the main sequence line, they are [[Proton–proton chain reaction|fusing hydrogen]] in their cores. The next concentration of stars is on the [[horizontal branch]] ([[helium fusion]] in the core and hydrogen burning in a shell surrounding the core). Another prominent feature is the [[Hertzsprung gap]] located in the region between A5 and G0 spectral type and between +1 and −3 absolute magnitudes (''i.e.'' between the top of the main sequence and the giants in the [[horizontal branch]]). [[RR Lyrae variable]] stars can be found in the left of this gap on a section of the diagram called the [[instability strip]]. [[Cepheid variable]]s also fall on the instability strip, at higher luminosities.

The H-R diagram can be used by scientists to roughly measure how far away a [[star cluster]] or [[galaxy]] is from Earth. This can be done by comparing the apparent magnitudes of the stars in the cluster to the absolute magnitudes of stars with known distances (or of model stars). The observed group is then shifted in the vertical direction, until the two main sequences overlap. The difference in magnitude that was bridged in order to match the two groups is called the [[distance modulus]] and is a direct measure for the distance (ignoring [[extinction (astronomy)|extinction]]). This technique is known as [[main sequence fitting]] and is a type of [[spectroscopic parallax]]. Not only the turn-off in the main sequence can be used, but also the tip of the red giant branch stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Da Costa |first1=G. S. |last2=Armandroff |first2=T.

==Diagram's role in the development of stellar physics==
{{See also|stellar nucleosynthesis}}
[[File:Open cluster HR diagram ages.gif|thumb|upright=1.5|HR diagrams for two [[open cluster]]s, [[Open Cluster M67|M67]] and [[NGC 188]], showing the [[main sequence|main-sequence]] turn-off at different ages.]]
Contemplation of the diagram led astronomers to speculate that it might demonstrate [[stellar evolution]], the main suggestion being that stars collapsed from red giants to dwarf stars, then moving down along the line of the main sequence in the course of their lifetimes. Stars were thought therefore to radiate energy by converting gravitational energy into radiation through the [[Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism]]. This mechanism resulted in an age for the Sun of only tens of millions of years, creating a conflict over the age of the Solar System between astronomers, and biologists and geologists who had evidence that the Earth was far older than that. This conflict was only resolved in the 1930s when nuclear fusion was identified as the source of stellar energy.

Following Russell's presentation of the diagram to a meeting of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]] in 1912, [[Arthur Eddington]] was inspired to use it as a basis for developing ideas on [[stellar physics]]. In 1926, in his book ''The Internal Constitution of the Stars'' he explained the physics of how stars fit on the diagram.&lt;ref name=eddington&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Internal Constitution of the Stars |first=A. S. |last=Eddington |journal=The Scientific Monthly |volume=11 |issue=4 |date=Oct 1920 |pages=297–303 |jstor=6491|bibcode=1920SciMo..11..297E }}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper anticipated the later discovery of [[nuclear fusion]] and correctly proposed that the star's source of power was the combination of hydrogen into helium, liberating enormous energy. This was a particularly remarkable jump of insight, since at that time the source of a star's energy was still unsolved, [[Nuclear fusion|thermonuclear energy]] had not been proven to exist, and even that stars are largely composed of [[hydrogen]] (see [[metallicity]]), had not yet been discovered. Eddington managed to sidestep this problem by concentrating on the [[thermodynamics]] of [[thermal radiation|radiative transport]] of energy in stellar interiors.&lt;ref name=eddington2&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1916MNRAS..77...16E |title=On the radiative equilibrium of the stars |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=77|pages=16–35 |author1=Eddington |first1=A. S. |year=1916 |doi=10.1093/mnras/77.1.16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eddington predicted that dwarf stars remain in an essentially static position on the main sequence for most of their lives. In the 1930s and 1940s, with an understanding of hydrogen fusion, came an evidence-backed theory of evolution to red giants following which were speculated cases of explosion and implosion of the remnants to white dwarfs. The term [[supernova nucleosynthesis]] is used to describe the creation of elements during the evolution and explosion of a pre-supernova star, a concept put forth by [[Fred Hoyle]] in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=F. |last=Hoyle |title=On Nuclear Reactions Occurring in Very Hot Stars.

==Academic research==

Human Dynamics as a branch of statistical physics: Its main goal is to understand human behavior using methods originally developed in statistical physics. Research in this area started to gain momentum in 2005 after the publication of A.-L. Barabási's seminal paper ''The origin of bursts and heavy tails in human dynamics.''&lt;ref name="Barabasi05-1"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=A.-L. Barabási |year=2005|title=The origin of bursts and heavy tails in human dynamics.|journal=Nature|volume= 435|pages=207–211|pmid=15889093|issue=7039|doi=10.1038/nature03459|arxiv = cond-mat/0505371 |bibcode = 2005Natur.435..207B }}&lt;/ref&gt; that introduced a queuing model that was alleged to be capable of explaining the long tailed distribution of inter event times that naturally occur in human activity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27140">An '''imaging cycler microscope (ICM)''' is a fully automated (epi)[[fluorescence microscope]] which overcomes the spectral resolution limit resulting in parameter- and dimension-unlimited fluorescence imaging.  The principle and robotic device was described by Walter Schubert in 1997 &lt;ref name=ref1&gt;Schubert W (1997) Automated device and method for measuring and identifying molecules or fragments thereof. European patent EP 0810428 B1 [see also Schubert W. US patent 6,150,173 (2000); Japanese patent 3739528 (1998)].&lt;/ref&gt; and ever since has been further developed with his co-workers within the human [[toponome]] project.&lt;ref name=ref2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cottingham|first=Katie|title=Human Toponome Project {{!}} Human Proteinpedia is open for (free) business|journal=Journal of Proteome Research|date=May 2008|volume=7|issue=5|pages=1806|doi=10.1021/pr083701k}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ref3&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schubert|first=Walter|author2=Bonnekoh, Bernd |author3=Pommer, Ansgar J |author4=Philipsen, Lars |author5=Böckelmann, Raik |author6=Malykh, Yanina |author7=Gollnick, Harald |author8=Friedenberger, Manuela |author9=Bode, Marcus |author10= Dress, Andreas W M |title=Analyzing proteome topology and function by automated multidimensional fluorescence microscopy|journal=Nature Biotechnology|date=1 October 2006|volume=24|issue=10|pages=1270–1278|doi=10.1038/nbt1250 |pmid=17013374}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ref4&gt;{{cite journal|last=Friedenberger|first=Manuela|author2=Bode, Marcus |author3=Krusche, Andreas |author4= Schubert, Walter |title=Fluorescence detection of protein clusters in individual cells and tissue sections by using toponome imaging system: sample preparation and measuring procedures|journal=Nature Protocols|date=September 2007|volume=2|issue=9|pages=2285–2294|doi=10.1038/nprot.2007.320|pmid=17853885}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ref5&gt;{{cite web|last=Schubert|first=W|title=Direct, spatial imaging of randomly large supermolecules by using parameter unlimited TIS imaging cycler microscopy.|url=http://www.toposnomos.com/doku/MC2013.pdf|publisher=International Microscopy Conference 2013|accessdate=2013-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ICM runs robotically controlled repetitive incubation-imaging-bleaching cycles  with dye-conjugated probe libraries recognizing target structures in situ (biomolecules in fixed cells or tissue sections). This results in the transmission of a randomly large number of distinct biological informations by re-using the same fluorescence channel after bleaching for the transmission of another biological information using the same dye which is conjugated to another specific probe, a.s.o. Thereby noise-reduced quasi-multi channel fluorescence images with reproducible physical, geometrical, and biophyscial stabilities are generated. The resulting power of combinatorial molecular discrimination (PCMD) per data point is given by 65,536&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;, where 65,536  is the number of grey value levels (output of a 16-bit CCD camera) and ''k'' is the number of co-mapped biomolecules and/or subdomains per biomolecule(s). High PCMD has been shown for ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;100,&lt;ref name=ref3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ref5 /&gt; and in principle can be expanded for much higher numbers of&amp;nbsp;''k''.  In contrast to traditional multi-channel-few parameter fluorescence microscopy  (Fig 1a) high PCMDs in an ICM lead to high functional and spatial resolution (Fig 1b). Systematic ICM analysis of biological systems reveals the supramolecular segregation law that describes the principle of order of large, hierarchically organized biomolecular networks in situ (toponome).&lt;ref name=ref6&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schubert|first=W|title=Systematic, spatial imaging of large multimolecular assemblies and the emerging principles of supramolecular order in biological systems.|journal=Journal of Molecular Recognition|year=2014|volume=27|issue=1|pages=3–18|doi=10.1002/jmr.2326|pmid=24375580|pmc=4283051}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ICM is the core technology for the systematic mapping of the complete protein network code in tissues (human toponome project).&lt;ref name=ref2 /&gt; The original ICM method &lt;ref name=ref1 /&gt; includes any modification of the bleaching step.

A launch period refers to the days that the rocket can launch to reach its intended orbit. A mission could have a period of 365 days in a year, a few weeks each month,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) Launch Press Kit|url=https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/582116main_GRAIL_launch_press_kit.pdf|publisher=NASA JPL|accessdate=3 May 2018|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a few weeks every 26 months (e.g. Mars launch periods),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA Targets May 2018 Launch of Mars InSight Mission|url=https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-targets-may-2018-launch-of-mars-insight-mission|publisher=NASA|accessdate=3 May 2018|date=March 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a short period time that won't be repeated.

A launch window indicates the time frame on a given day in the launch period that the rocket can launch to reach its intended orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Launch Schedule 101|url=https://www.nasa.gov/missions/highlights/schedule101.html|website=Missions|publisher=NASA|accessdate=3 May 2018|date=March 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aiming for an Open Window|url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/launchingrockets/launchwindows.html|website=Kennedy Space Center|publisher=NASA|accessdate=3 May 2018|date=February 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be as short as a second (referred to as an instantaneous window) or even the entire day. For operational reasons, the window almost always is limited to no more than a few hours. The launch window can stretch over two calendar days (ex: start at 11:46 p.m. and end at 12:14 a.m.). Launch windows are rarely the exact same times each day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dawn Launch Mission to Vesta and Ceres Press Kit|url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/press_kits/dawn-launch.pdf|publisher=NASA JPL|accessdate=3 May 2018|date=September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Launch windows and launch periods are often used interchangeably in the public sphere, even within the same organization. However, these definitions are the ones used by NASA (and other space agency) launch directors and trajectory analysts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Launch Vehicle Facts|url=https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/mission/launch-vehicle/|website=Mars InSight Press Kit|publisher=NASA JPL|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Launch Time and Window, H-IIA F37 (with upgraded function) Encapsulating SHIKISAI and TSUBAME|url=http://global.jaxa.jp/press/2017/12/20171221_h2af37.html|website=JAXA Press Releases|publisher=Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA)|accessdate=3 May 2018|date=December 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Launch Period==

To go to another planet using the simple low-energy [[Hohmann transfer orbit]], if [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of orbits is not a factor, launch periods are periodic according to the [[synodic period]]; for example, in the case of Mars, the period is 2.135 years, (780 days). In more complex cases, including the use of [[gravitational slingshot]]s, launch windows are irregular. Sometimes rare opportunities arise, such as when ''[[Voyager 2]]'' took advantage of a 175-year planetary alignment (launch window) to visit [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], and [[Neptune]].  When such an opportunity is missed, another target may be selected. For example, the [[European Space Agency|ESA]]'s ''[[Rosetta (spacecraft)|Rosetta]]'' mission was originally intended for comet [[46P/Wirtanen]], but a launcher problem delayed it and a new target had to be selected (comet [[67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko]]).

Launch periods are often calculated from [[porkchop plot]]s, which  show the [[delta-v]] needed to achieve the mission plotted against the launch time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Porkchop" is the First Menu Item on a Trip to Mars|url=https://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/spotlight/porkchopAll.html|website=NASA's Mars Exploration Program|publisher=NASA JPL|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Launch Window==
The launch window is defined by the first launch point and ending launch point. It may be continuous (i.e. able to launch every second in the launch window) or may be a collection of discrete instantaneous points between the open and close&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Detailed Launch Window|url=https://marsmobile.jpl.nasa.gov/mer/mission/timeline/launch/launch-window/|website=Mars Exploration Rovers Press Kit|publisher=NASA JPL|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Launch windows and days are usually calculated in UTC and then converted to the local time of where the rocket and spacecraft operators are located (frequently multiple time zones for USA launches).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Launch Windows|url=https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/mission/timeline/launch/launch-windows/|website=Mars InSight Press Kit|publisher=NASA JPL|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For trips into largely arbitrary [[Earth orbit]]s, no specific launch time is required. But if the spacecraft intends to [[space rendezvous|rendezvous]] with an object already in orbit, the launch must be carefully timed to occur around the times that the target vehicle's [[orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]] intersects the launch site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GETTING READY FOR LAUNCH|url=https://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Getting_ready_for_launch/(print)|publisher=European Space Agency|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Earth observation satellite]]s are often launched into [[sun-synchronous orbit]]s which are [[Polar orbit|near-polar]]. For these orbits, the launch window occurs at the time of day when the launch site location is aligned with the plane of the required orbit. To launch at another time would require an orbital plane change [[Orbital maneuver|maneuver]] which would require a large amount of propellant.

For launches above [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO), the actual launch time can be somewhat flexible if a [[parking orbit]] is used, because the inclination and time the spacecraft initially spends in the parking orbit can be varied. See the launch window used by the ''[[Mars Global Surveyor]]'' spacecraft to the planet [[Mars]] at [http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mgs/overvu/delta/window/window.html].

==Specific issues==
[[Space Shuttle]] missions to the [[International Space Station]] were restricted by [[beta angle]] cutout. Beta angle (&lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;) is defined as the angle between the orbit plane and the vector from the Sun.&lt;ref name="knk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tak2000.com/data/planets/earth.htm|title=  Earth's Thermal Environment|last=K&amp;K Associates|year=2008|work=Thermal Environments JPL D-8160|publisher=K&amp;K Associates|accessdate=June 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the relationship between an orbiting object's beta angle (in this case, the ISS) and the percent of its orbit that is spent in sunlight, solar power generation and thermal control are affected by that beta angle.&lt;ref name="mcc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/feedback/expert/answer/mcc/sts-113/11_23_20_01_179.html|title=MCC Answers|author=Derek Hassman, NASA Flight Director|date=December 1, 2002|publisher=NASA|accessdate=June 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shuttle launches to the ISS were normally attempted only when the ISS was in an orbit with a beta angle of less than 60 degrees.&lt;ref name="mcc"/&gt;

{{Political anthropology}}
{{Anthropology |social/cultural}}

'''Legal anthropology''', also known as the '''anthropology of laws''', is a sub-discipline of [[anthropology]] which specializes in "the cross-cultural study of social ordering".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Greenhouse, Carol J. |title=Praying for Justice: Faith, Order, and Community in an American Town |location=Ithaca |publisher=Cornell UP |year=1986 |pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The questions that Legal Anthropologists seek to answer concern how is [[law]] present in cultures? How does it manifest? How may anthropologists contribute to understandings of law?

Earlier legal anthropological research focused more narrowly on conflict management, crime, sanctions, or formal regulation.  [[Bronisław Malinowski]]'s 1926 work, ''Crime and Custom in Savage Society'', explored law, order, crime, and punishment among the [[Trobriand Islanders]].&lt;ref&gt;Malinowski, Bronislaw 1985[1926] Crime and Custom in Savage Society. Totowa, New Jersey:  Rowman &amp; Allanheld.&lt;/ref&gt;  The English lawyer Sir [[Henry Maine]] is often credited with founding the study of Legal Anthropology through his book ''[[Ancient Law]]'' (1861), and although his evolutionary stance has been widely discredited within the discipline, his questions raised have shaped the subsequent discourse of the study. This ethno-centric evolutionary perspective was pre-eminent in early Anthropological discourse on law, evident through terms applied such as ‘pre-law’ or ‘proto-law’ and applied by so-called armchair anthropologists. However, a turning point was presented in the 1926 publication of ''Crime and Custom in Savage Society'' by [[Bronisław Malinowski|Malinowski]] based upon his time with the Trobriand Islanders. Through emphasizing the order present in acephelous societies, Malinowski proposed the cross-cultural examining of law through its established functions as opposed to a discrete entity. This has led to multiple researchers and ethnographies examining such aspects as order, dispute, conflict management, crime, sanctions, or formal regulation, in addition (and often antagonistically) to law-centred studies, with small-societal studies leading to insightful self-reflections and better understanding of the founding concept of law.

Legal anthropology remains a lively discipline with modern and recent applications including issues such as [[human rights]], [[legal pluralism]], [[Islamophobia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowen |first=John R. |title=A New Anthropology of Islam |year=2012 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Political theologies: public religions in a post-secular world |year=2006 |publisher=Fordham University Press |location=New York |editor=Hent de Vries and Lawrence E. Sullivan}}&lt;/ref&gt; and political uprisings.

==What is law?==
{{see also|Philosophy of law}}
Legal Anthropology provides a definition of law which differs from that found within modern legal systems. Hoebel (1954) offered the following definition of law: ''“A social norm is legal if its neglect or infraction is regularly met, in threat or in fact, by the application of physical force by an individual or group possessing the socially recognized privilege of so acting”''

Maine argued that human societies passing through three basic stages of legal development, from a group presided over by a senior agnate, through stages of territorial development and culminating in an elite forming normative laws of society, stating that ''“what the juristical oligarchy now claims is to monopolize the knowledge of the laws, to have the exclusive possession of the principles by which quarrels are decided”''

This [[evolutionary approach]], as has been stated, was subsequently replaced within the anthropological discourse by the need to examine the manifestations of law’s societal function. As according to [[Hoebel]], law has four functions:

1)	to identify socially acceptable lines of behaviour for inclusion in the culture. 
2)	To allocate authority and who may legitimately apply force.
3)	To settle trouble cases.
4)	To redefine relationships as the concepts of life change.

Legal theorist H. L. A. Hart, however, stated that law is a body of rules, and is a union of two sets of rules: 
# rules on conduct ("primary rules") &lt;ref&gt;H. L. A. Hart, "Law as the Union of Primary and Secondary Rules," The Concept of Law.&lt;/ref&gt;
# rules about recognizing, changing, applying, and adjudicating on rules on conduct ("secondary rules") &lt;ref&gt;H. L. A. Hart, "Law as the Union of Primary and Secondary Rules," The Concept of Law.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within modern English Theory, law is a discrete and specialized topic. Predominantly positivist in character, it is closely linked to notions of a rule-making body, the judiciary and enforcement agencies. The centralized state organisation and isolates are essentials to the attributes of rules, courts and sanctions. To learn more on this view, see Hobbes. 1651 Leviathan, part 2, chapter 26  or Salmond, J. 1902 Jurisprudence.

However, this view of law is not applicable everywhere. There are many acephelous societies around the world where the above control mechanisms are absent. There are no conceptualized and isolated set of normative rules – these are instead embodied in everyday life. Even when there may be a discrete set of legal norms, these are not treated similarly to the English Legal System’s unequivocal power and unchallenged pre-eminence. Shamans, fighting and supernatural means are all mechanisms of superimposing rules within other societies. For example, within [[Rasmussen]]’s work of Across Arctic America (1927) he recounts [[Eskimo]] nith-songs being used as a public reprimand by expressing the wrongdoing of someone guilty.

Thus, instead of focusing upon the explicit manifestations of law, legal anthropologists have taken to examining the functions of law and how it is expressed. A view expressed by Leopold Pospisil&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Pospisil, Leopold |title=The Anthropology of Laws: A Comparative Theory  |year=1974|pages=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; and encapsulated by Bronislaw Malinowski:

''“In such primitive communities I personally believe that law ought to be defined by function and not by form, that is we ought to see what are the arrangements, the sociological realities, the cultural mechanisms which act for the enforcement of law”''&lt;ref&gt;(1934: Introduction to Hogbin, Law and Order in Polynesia).&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, law has been studied in ways that may be categorized by as:

1) prescriptive rules
2) observable regularities
3) Instances of dispute.

==Processual paradigm: order and conflict==

Order and regulatory behaviour are required if social life is to be maintained. The scale and shade of this behaviour depends on the values and beliefs held by a society deriving from implicit understandings of the norm developed through socialization. There are socially constructed norms with varying degrees of explicitness and levels of order. Conflict may not be interpreted as an extreme pathological event but as a regulatory acting force.

This processual understanding of conflict and dispute became apparent and subsequently heavily theorized upon by the anthropological discipline within the latter half of the nineteenth century as a gateway to the law and order of a society. Disputes have become to be recognised as necessary and constructive over pathological whilst the stated rules of law only explain some aspects of control and compliance. The context and interactions of a dispute are more informative about a culture than the rules.

Classic studies deriving theories of order from disputes include Evans-Pritchard work Witchcraft, Oracles and Magic among the Azande which focused upon functional disputes surrounding sorcery and witchcraft practices, or Comaroff and Roberts (1981) work among the Tswana which examine the hierarchy of disputes, the patterns of contact and the effect norms affect the course of dispute as norms important to dispute are rarely ''“especially organised for jural purpose”'' &lt;ref&gt;(Bohannan, 1957:58).&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples include:

[[Edmund Leach|Leach]], 1954. Political Systems of Highland Burma.
[[Fredrik Barth|Barth]], 1959. Political Leadership among Swat Pathans.

==Case study approach==

Within the history of Legal Anthropology there have been various methods of data gathering adopted; ranging from literature review of traveller/missionary accounts, consulting informants and lengthy participant observation.

Furthermore, when evaluating any research it is appropriate to have a robust methodology capable of scientifically analysing the topic at hand.

The broad method of study by legal anthropologists prevails upon the Case Study Approach first developed by Llewellyn and Hoebel in The Cheyenne Way (1941) not as ''“a philosophy but a technology”'' &lt;ref&gt;(Pospisil, 1973: 541).&lt;/ref&gt;

This methodology is applied to situations of cross-cultural conflict and the correlating resolution, which can have sets of legal notions and jural regularities extracted from them &lt;ref&gt;(Bohannan, 1965: pp. 41; Pospisil, 1973).&lt;/ref&gt;

This method may be safe-guarded against accusations of imposing western ideological structures as it is often an emic sentiment: for example,

''“The Tiv drove me to the case method…what they were interested in. They put a lot of time and effort into cases”''
&lt;ref&gt;(Bohannan, 1989: vii).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues of terminology and ethnology==

Regarding law, in Anthropology’s characteristically self-conscious manner, the comparative analysis inherent to Legal Anthropology has been speculated upon and most famously debated by [[Paul Bohannan]] and [[Max Gluckman]]. The discourse highlights one of the primary differences between British and American Anthropology regarding fieldwork approaches and concerns the imposition of Western terminology as ethnological categories of differing societies.&lt;ref&gt;(Bohannan, 1956).&lt;/ref&gt;

Each author’s uses the Case Study Approach, however, the data’s presentation in terms of achieving comparativeness is a point of contention between them.

Paul Bohannan promotes the use of native terminology presented with ethnographic meaning as opposed to any Universal categories, which act as barriers to understanding the true nature of a culture’s legal system.

Advocating that it is better to appreciate native terms in their own medium, Bohannan critiques Gluckman’s work for its inherent [[bias]].

Gluckman has argued that Bohannan’s excessive use of native terminology creates barriers when attempting to achieve comparative analysis. He in turn has suggested that in order to further the cross-cultural comparative study of law, we should use English terms and concepts of law which will aid in the refinement of dispute facts and interrelations &lt;ref&gt;(Gluckman, 1965: 26).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, all native terms should be described and translated into an Anglo-American conceptual equivalent for the purpose of comparison.

==Processes==

As disputes and order began to be recognised as categories worthy of study, interest in the inherent aspects of conflicts emerged within legal anthropology. The processes and actors involved within the events became an object of study for ethnographers as they embraced conflict as a data-rich source.

One example of such an interest is expressed by [[Philip Gulliver]], 1963, Social Control in an African Society in which the intimate relations between disputes are postulated as being important. He examines the patterns of alliance between actors of a dispute and the strategies that develop as a result, the roles of mediators and the typologies for intervention.

==Key questions in legal anthropology==

*'''Issues of Legal Pluralism'''.
See ''[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=15129292 Lyon, 2002] Local arbitration and conflict deferment in Punjab, Pakistan'' or ''Engel, D. 1980. Legal pluralism in an American community: perspectives on a civil trial court.''

*'''The legitimacy of Universal Human Rights'''.
Political anthropologists have had much to say about the UDHR(Universal Declaration of Human Rights). Original critiques, most notably by the AAA(American Anthropological Association), argued that cultural ideas of rights and entitlement differ between societies. They warned that any attempt to endorse one set of values above all others amounted to a new western imperialism, and would be counter to ideas of cultural relativism. Most anthropologists now agree that universal human rights have a useful place in today's world. Zechenter (1997) argues there are practices, such as Indian 'sati' (the burning of a widow on her husband's funeral pyre) that can be said to be wrong, despite justifications of tradition. This is because such practices are about much more than a culturally established world view, and frequently develop or revive as a result of socio-economic conditions and the balance of power within a community. As culture is not bounded and unchanging, there are multiple discourses and moral viewpoints within any community and among the various actors in such events (Merry 2003). Cultural relativists risk supporting the most powerfully asserted position at the expense of those who are subjugated under it.

More recent contributions to the question of universal human rights include analysis of their use in practice, and how global discourses are translated into local contexts (Merry 2003). Anthropologists such as Merry (2006) note how the legal framework of the UNDHR is not static but is actively used by communities around the globe to construct meaning. As much as the document is a product of western Enlightenment thinking, communities have the capacity to shape its meaning to suit their own agendas, incorporating its principles in ways that empower them to tackle their own local and national discontents.

Female genital cutting (FGC), also known as female circumcision or female genital mutilation remains a hotly debated, controversial issue contested particularly among legal anthropologists and human rights activists. Through her ethnography (1989) on the practice of pharonic circumcision among the Hofriyat of Sudan (1989) Boddy maintains that understanding local cultural norms is of crucial importance when considering intervention to prevent the practice. Human rights activists attempting to eradicate FGC using the legal framework of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UNDHR) as their justification, run the risk of imposing a set of ideological principles, alien to the culture attempting to be helped, potentially facing hostile reactions. Moreover, the UNDHR as a legal document, is contested by some as being restrictive in its prescription of what is and is not deemed a violation of a human right (Ross 2003) and  overlooks local customary justifications which operate outside of an international legalistic framework (Ross 2003). Increasingly (FGC) is becoming a global issue due to increased mobility. What was once deemed a largely African practice has seen a steady increase in European countries such as Britain. Although made illegal in 1985 there have as yet been no convictions and girls as old as nine continue to have the procedure. Legislation has now also been passed in Sweden, the United States and France where there have been convictions. Black, J. A. and Debelle, G. D. (1995) "Female Genital Mutilation in Britain" ''British Medical Journal''.

==Further information==
There are a number of useful introductions to the field of legal anthropology,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example Moore, Sally Falk, ''Law and Anthropology: A Reader'', (edited), Blackwell, 2004, pp. 20-25, {{ISBN|1-4051-0228-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sally Falk Moore]], a leading legal anthropologist, held both a law degree and a PhD in anthropology. An increasing number of legal anthropologists hold both [[juris doctor|JD]]s and advanced degrees in anthropology, and some teach in [[law school]]s while maintaining scholarly connections within the field of legal anthropology; examples include Rebecca French, John Conley, [[Elizabeth Mertz]], and [[Annelise Riles]]. Such combined expertise has also been turned to more [[applied anthropology|applied anthropological]] pursuits such as tribal advocacy and [[forensic anthropology|forensic ethnography]] by practitioners. There is a growing interest in the intersection of legal and [[linguistic anthropology]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7321">In differential geometry, a '''Lie algebra-valued form''' is a [[vector-valued differential form|differential form with values in a Lie algebra]]. Such forms have important applications in the theory of [[connection (principal bundle)|connections]] on a [[principal bundle]] as well as in the theory of [[Cartan connection]]s.

== Formal Definition ==

A Lie algebra-valued differential ''k''-form on a manifold, &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, is a smooth [[section (fiber bundle)|section]] of the [[fibre bundle|bundle]] &lt;math&gt; (\mathfrak{g} \times M) \otimes \Lambda^k T^*M&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Lie algebra]], &lt;math&gt;T^*M&lt;/math&gt; is the [[cotangent bundle]] of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; denotes the ''k''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; [[Exterior algebra|exterior power]].

== Wedge product ==

Since every Lie algebra has a bilinear Lie bracket operation, the wedge product of two Lie algebra-valued forms can be composed with the bracket operation to obtain another Lie algebra-valued form. This operation, denoted by &lt;math&gt;[\omega\wedge\eta]&lt;/math&gt;, is given by: for &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;-valued ''p''-form &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;-valued ''q''-form &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[\omega\wedge\eta](v_1, \cdots, v_{p+q}) = {1 \over (p + q)!}\sum_{\sigma} \operatorname{sgn}(\sigma) [\omega(v_{\sigma(1)}, \cdots, v_{\sigma(p)}), \eta(v_{\sigma(p+1)}, \cdots, v_{\sigma(p+q)})]&lt;/math&gt;
where ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;'s are tangent vectors. The notation is meant to indicate both operations involved. For example, if &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; are Lie algebra-valued one forms, then one has
:&lt;math&gt;[\omega\wedge\eta](v_1,v_2) = {1 \over 2} ([\omega(v_1),\eta(v_2)] - [\omega(v_2),\eta(v_1)]).&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!-- With this operation the set of all Lie algebra-valued forms on a manifold ''M'' becomes a [[graded Lie superalgebra]].--&gt;

The operation &lt;math&gt;[\omega\wedge\eta]&lt;/math&gt; can also be defined as the bilinear operation on &lt;math&gt;\Omega(M, \mathfrak{g})&lt;/math&gt; satisfying
:&lt;math&gt;[(g \otimes \alpha) \wedge (h \otimes \beta)] = [g, h] \otimes (\alpha \wedge \beta)&lt;/math&gt;
for all &lt;math&gt;g, h \in \mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha, \beta \in \Omega(M, \mathbb R)&lt;/math&gt;.

Some authors have used the notation &lt;math&gt;[\omega, \eta]&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;[\omega\wedge\eta]&lt;/math&gt;. The notation &lt;math&gt;[\omega, \eta]&lt;/math&gt;, which resembles a [[Commutator#Ring theory|commutator]], is justified by the fact that if the Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt; is a matrix algebra then &lt;math&gt;[\omega\wedge\eta]&lt;/math&gt; is nothing but the [[graded commutator]] of &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt;, i. e. if &lt;math&gt;\omega \in \Omega^p(M, \mathfrak g)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\eta \in \Omega^q(M, \mathfrak g)&lt;/math&gt; then
:&lt;math&gt;[\omega\wedge\eta] = \omega\wedge\eta - (-1)^{pq}\eta\wedge\omega,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\omega \wedge \eta,\ \eta \wedge \omega \in \Omega^{p+q}(M, \mathfrak g)&lt;/math&gt; are wedge products formed using the matrix multiplication on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt;.

== Operations ==
Let &lt;math&gt;f: \mathfrak{g} \to \mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt; be a [[Lie algebra homomorphism]]. If φ is a &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;-valued form on a manifold, then ''f''(φ) is an &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt;-valued form on the same manifold obtained by applying ''f'' to the values of φ: &lt;math&gt;f(\varphi)(v_1, \dots, v_k) = f(\varphi(v_1, \dots, v_k))&lt;/math&gt;.

Similarly, if ''f'' is a multilinear functional on &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \prod_1^k \mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;, then one puts&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kobayashi–Nomizu|loc=Ch. XII, § 1.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f(\varphi_1, \dots, \varphi_k)(v_1, \dots, v_q) = {1 \over q!} \sum_{\sigma} \operatorname{sgn}(\sigma) f(\varphi_1(v_{\sigma(1)}, \dots, v_{\sigma(q_1)}), \dots, \varphi_k(v_{\sigma(q - q_k + 1)}, \dots, v_{\sigma(q)}))&lt;/math&gt;
where ''q'' = ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + … + ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; and φ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;-valued ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;-forms. Moreover, given a vector space ''V'', the same formula can be used to define the ''V''-valued form &lt;math&gt;f(\varphi, \eta)&lt;/math&gt; when
:&lt;math&gt;f: \mathfrak{g} \times V \to V&lt;/math&gt;
is a multilinear map, φ is a &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;-valued form and η is a ''V''-valued form. Note that, when
:(*) ''f''([''x'', ''y''], ''z'') = ''f''(''x'', ''f''(''y'', ''z'')) - ''f''(''y'', ''f''(''x'', ''z'')),
giving ''f'' amounts to giving an action of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; on ''V''; i.e., ''f'' determines the representation
:&lt;math&gt;\rho: \mathfrak{g} \to V, \rho(x)y = f(x, y)&lt;/math&gt;
and, conversely, any representation ρ determines ''f'' with the condition (*). For example, if &lt;math&gt;f(x, y) = [x, y]&lt;/math&gt; (the bracket of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;), then we recover the definition of &lt;math&gt;[\cdot \wedge \cdot]&lt;/math&gt; given above, with ρ = ad, the [[adjoint representation of a Lie algebra|adjoint representation]]. (Note the relation between ''f'' and ρ above is thus like the relation between a bracket and ad.) 

In general, if ''α'' is a &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{gl}(V)&lt;/math&gt;-valued ''p''-form and φ is a ''V''-valued ''q''-form, then one more commonly writes α⋅φ = ''f''(α, φ) when {{nowrap|''f''(''T'', ''x'') &lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; ''T''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;''x''.}} Explicitly,
:&lt;math&gt;(\alpha \cdot \phi)(v_1, \dots, v_{p+q}) = {1 \over (p+q)!} \sum_{\sigma} \operatorname{sgn}(\sigma) \alpha(v_{\sigma(1)}, \dots, v_{\sigma(p)}) \phi(v_{\sigma(p+1)}, \dots, v_{\sigma(p+q)}).&lt;/math&gt;
With this notation, one has for example:
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ad}(\alpha) \cdot \phi = [\alpha \wedge \phi]&lt;/math&gt;.

Example: If ω is a &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;-valued one-form (for example, a [[connection form]]), ρ a representation of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; on a vector space ''V'' and φ a ''V''-valued zero-form, then
:&lt;math&gt;\rho([\omega \wedge \omega]) \cdot \varphi = 2 \rho(\omega) \cdot (\rho(\omega) \cdot \varphi).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Since &lt;math&gt;\rho([\omega \wedge \omega])(v, w) = \rho([\omega \wedge \omega](v, w)) = \rho([\omega(v), \omega(w)]) = \rho(\omega(v))\rho(\omega(w)) - \rho(\omega(w))\rho(\omega(v))&lt;/math&gt;, we have that
:&lt;math&gt;(\rho([\omega \wedge \omega]) \cdot \phi)(v, w) = {1 \over 2} (\rho([\omega \wedge \omega])(v, w) \phi - \rho([\omega \wedge \omega])(w, v) \phi)&lt;/math&gt;
is &lt;math&gt;\rho(\omega(v))\rho(\omega(w))\phi - \rho(\omega(w))\rho(\omega(v))\phi = 2(\rho(\omega) \cdot (\rho(\omega) \cdot \phi))(v, w).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Forms with values in an adjoint bundle ==
{{see also|adjoint bundle}}
Let ''P'' be a smooth principal bundle with structure group ''G'' and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g} = \operatorname{Lie}(G)&lt;/math&gt;. ''G'' acts on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; via [[adjoint representation]] and so one can form the associated bundle:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}_P = P \times_{\operatorname{Ad}} \mathfrak{g}.&lt;/math&gt;
Any &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}_P&lt;/math&gt;-valued forms on the base space of ''P'' are in a natural one-to-one correspondence with any [[tensorial form]]s on ''P'' of adjoint type.

'''Mimesis''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɪ|ˈ|m|iː|s|ɪ|s|,_|m|ə|-|,_|m|aɪ|-|,_|-|ə|s}};&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Wells|first=John C.|year=2008|title=Longman Pronunciation Dictionary|edition=3rd|publisher=Longman|isbn=9781405881180}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-grc|μίμησις}} ''mīmēsis'', from μιμεῖσθαι ''mīmeisthai'', "to imitate", from [[Wikt:μῖμος|μῖμος]] ''mimos'', "imitator, actor") is a [[Literary criticism|critical]] and philosophical term that carries a wide range of meanings, which include [[imitation]], [[representation (arts)|representation]], [[mimicry]], ''imitatio'', receptivity, nonsensuous similarity, the act of resembling, the act of expression, and the [[impression management|presentation of the self]].&lt;ref&gt;Gebauer and Wulf (1992, 1).&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ancient Greece]], mimesis was an idea that governed the creation of works of art, in particular, with correspondence to the physical world understood as a model for beauty, [[truth]], and the good. [[Plato]] contrasted mimesis, or [[imitation]], with [[diegesis]], or narrative. After Plato, the meaning of mimesis eventually shifted toward a specifically literary function in ancient Greek society, and its use has changed and been reinterpreted many times since.

One of the best-known modern studies of mimesis, understood as a form of [[realism (literature)|realism]] in literature, is [[Erich Auerbach]]'s ''[[Mimesis: The Representation of Reality in Western Literature]]'', which opens with a famous comparison between the way the world is represented in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' and the way it appears in the ''Bible''. From these two seminal Western texts, Auerbach builds the foundation for a unified theory of representation that spans the entire history of Western literature, including the Modernist novels being written at the time Auerbach began his study. In [[art history]], "mimesis", "realism" and "naturalism" are used, often interchangeably, as terms for the accurate, even "illusionistic", [[Realism (arts)#Illusionistic realism|representation of the visual appearance of things]].

Mimesis has been theorised by thinkers as diverse as [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Philip Sidney]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Gabriel Tarde]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Theodor Adorno]], [[Erich Auerbach]], [[Paul Ricœur]], [[Luce Irigaray]], [[Jacques Derrida]], [[René Girard]], [[Nikolas Kompridis]], [[Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe]], [[Michael Taussig]], [[Merlin Donald]], and [[Homi K. Bhabha|Homi Bhabha]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}
&lt;!--Irrelevant paragraph: During the nineteenth century, the racial politics of imitation towards African Americans influenced the term mimesis and its evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=Kirt|title=The Racial Politics of Imitation in the Nineteenth Century|journal=Quarterly Journal of Speech|date=2003|doi=10.1080/00335630308178}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

==Classical definitions==

===Plato===
Both [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] saw in mimesis the [[representation (arts)|representation]] of [[nature]], including human nature, as reflected in the dramas of the period. Plato wrote about mimesis in both ''[[Ion (dialogue)|Ion]]'' and ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' (Books&amp;nbsp;II, III, and X). In ''Ion'', he states that poetry is the art of divine madness, or inspiration. Because the poet is subject to this divine madness, instead of possessing "art" or "knowledge" – ''[[techne]]'' – of the subject (532c), the poet does not speak truth (as characterized by Plato's [[Theory of forms|account of the Forms]]). As Plato has it, truth is only the concern of the philosopher. As culture in those days did not consist in the solitary reading of books, but in the listening to performances, the recitals of orators (and poets), or the acting out by classical actors of tragedy, Plato maintained in his critique that theatre was not sufficient in conveying the truth (540c). He was concerned that actors or orators were thus able to persuade an audience by rhetoric rather than by telling the truth (535b).

In Book&amp;nbsp;II of ''The Republic'', Plato describes [[Socrates]]' dialogue with his pupils. Socrates warns we should not seriously regard poetry as being capable of attaining the truth and that we who listen to poetry should be on our guard against its seductions, since the poet has no place in our idea of God.&lt;ref&gt;''The Republic'', 377.&lt;/ref&gt;

In developing this in Book&amp;nbsp;X, Plato told of Socrates' metaphor of the three beds: one bed exists as an idea made by God (the [[Platonic ideal|Platonic ideal, or form]]); one is made by the [[carpenter]], in imitation of God's idea; one is made by the artist in imitation of the carpenter's.&lt;ref&gt;''The Republic'', 596–599.&lt;/ref&gt;

So the artist's bed is twice removed from the truth. Those who copy only touch on a small part of things as they really are, where a bed may appear differently from various points of view, looked at obliquely or directly, or differently again in a mirror. So painters or poets, though they may paint or describe a carpenter, or any other maker of things, know nothing of the carpenter's (the craftsman's) art,&lt;ref name=Republic&gt;{{cite book | last = Plato | title = Book X | work = The Republic | url =  http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/republic.11.x.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and though the better painters or poets they are, the more faithfully their works of art will resemble the reality of the carpenter making a bed, nonetheless the imitators will still not attain the truth (of God's creation).&lt;ref name=Republic /&gt;

The poets, beginning with Homer, far from improving and educating humanity, do not possess the knowledge of craftsmen and are mere imitators who copy again and again images of virtue and rhapsodise about them, but never reach the truth in the way the superior philosophers do.

===Aristotle===
Similar to Plato's writings about mimesis, Aristotle also defined mimesis as the perfection, and imitation of nature. Art is not only imitation but also the use of mathematical ideas and symmetry in the search for the perfect, the timeless, and contrasting being with becoming. Nature is full of change, decay, and cycles, but art can also search for what is everlasting and the first causes of natural phenomena. Aristotle wrote about the idea of [[four causes]] in nature. The first, the [[formal cause]], is like a blueprint, or an immortal idea. The second cause is the material cause, or what a thing is made out of. The third cause is the efficient cause, that is, the process and the agent by which the thing is made. The fourth, the final cause, is the good, or the purpose and end of a thing, known as ''[[telos (philosophy)|telos]]''.

Aristotle's ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' is often referred to as the counterpart to this Platonic conception of poetry. ''Poetics'' is his treatise on the subject of mimesis. Aristotle was not against literature as such; he stated that human beings are mimetic beings, feeling an urge to create texts (art) that reflect and represent reality.

Aristotle considered it important that there be a certain distance between the work of art on the one hand and life on the other; we draw knowledge and consolation from tragedies only because they do not happen to us. Without this distance, tragedy could not give rise to [[catharsis]]. However, it is equally important that the text causes the audience to identify with the characters and the events in the text, and unless this identification occurs, it does not touch us as an audience. Aristotle holds that it is through "simulated representation", mimesis, that we respond to the acting on the stage which is conveying to us what the characters feel, so that we may [[empathy|empathise]] with them in this way through the mimetic form of dramatic roleplay. It is the task of the dramatist to produce the tragic enactment in order to accomplish this empathy by means of what is taking place on stage.

In short, catharsis can only be achieved if we see something that is both recognisable and distant. Aristotle argued that literature is more interesting as a means of learning than history, because history deals with specific facts that have happened, and which are contingent, whereas literature, although sometimes based on history, deals with events that could have taken place or ought to have taken place.

Aristotle thought of drama as being "an imitation of an action" and of [[tragedy]] as "falling from a higher to a lower [[Estates of the realm|estate]]" and so being removed to a less ideal situation in more ''tragic'' circumstances than before. He posited the [[fictional character|characters]] in tragedy as being better than the average human being, and those of comedy as being worse.

Michael Davis, a translator and commentator of Aristotle writes:
{{cquote|At first glance, mimesis seems to be a stylizing of reality in which the ordinary features of our world are brought into focus by a certain exaggeration, the relationship of the imitation to the object it imitates being something like the relationship of dancing to walking. Imitation always involves selecting something from the continuum of experience, thus giving boundaries to what really has no beginning or end. ''Mimêsis'' involves a framing of reality that announces that what is contained within the frame is not simply real. Thus the more "real" the imitation the more fraudulent it becomes.&lt;ref&gt;Davis (1993, 3).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Contrast to diegesis====
It was also Plato and Aristotle who contrasted mimesis with [[diegesis]] (Greek διήγησις). Mimesis ''shows'', rather than ''tells'', by means of directly represented action that is enacted. Diegesis, however, is the ''telling'' of the [[narrative|story]] by a narrator; the author narrates action indirectly and describes what is in the characters' minds and emotions. The narrator may speak as a particular character or may be the "invisible narrator" or even the "all-knowing narrator" who speaks from above in the form of commenting on the action or the characters.

In Book&amp;nbsp;III of his ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' (c.&amp;nbsp;373 BCE), [[Plato]] examines the style of poetry (the term includes comedy, [[tragedy]], [[epic poetry|epic]] and [[lyric poetry]]):&lt;ref&gt;An [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext98/repub11.txt etext of Plato's ''Republic''] is available from [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/150 Project Gutenberg]. The most relevant section is the following: "You are aware, I suppose, that all mythology and poetry is a narration of events, either past, present, or to come? / Certainly, he replied. / And narration may be either simple narration, or imitation, or a union of the two? / [...] / And this assimilation of himself to another, either by the use of voice or gesture, is the imitation of the person whose character he assumes? / Of course. / Then in this case the narrative of the poet may be said to proceed by way of imitation? / Very true. / Or, if the poet everywhere appears and never conceals himself, then again the imitation is dropped, and his poetry becomes simple narration." (Plato, Republic, Book&amp;nbsp;III.)&lt;/ref&gt; All types narrate events, he argues, but by differing means. He distinguishes between narration or report (diegesis) and imitation or representation (mimesis). Tragedy and comedy, he goes on to explain, are wholly imitative types; the [[dithyramb]] is wholly narrative; and their combination is found in [[epic poetry]]. When reporting or narrating, "the poet is speaking in his own person; he never leads us to suppose that he is any one else"; when imitating, the poet produces an "assimilation of himself to another, either by the use of voice or gesture".&lt;ref&gt;Plato, [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext98/repub11.txt ''Republic''], Book&amp;nbsp;III.&lt;/ref&gt; In dramatic texts, the poet never speaks directly; in narrative texts, the poet speaks as himself or herself.&lt;ref&gt;See also Pfister (1977, 2–3) and Elam: "classical narrative is always oriented towards an explicit ''there and then'', towards an imaginary 'elsewhere' set in the past and which has to be evoked for the reader through predication and description. Dramatic worlds, on the other hand, are presented to the spectator as 'hypothetically actual' constructs, since they are 'seen' in progress 'here and now' without narratorial mediation. [...] This is not merely a technical distinction but constitutes, rather, one of the cardinal principles of a poetics of the drama as opposed to one of narrative fiction. The distinction is, indeed, implicit in [[Aristotle]]'s differentiation of representational modes, namely ''[[Mimesis#Mimesis in contrast to diegesis|diegesis]]'' (narrative description) versus ''mimesis'' (direct imitation)" (1980, 110–1).&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', Aristotle argues that kinds of poetry (the term includes drama, flute music, and [[lyre]] music for Aristotle) may be differentiated in three ways: according to their ''medium'', according to their ''objects'', and according to their ''mode'' or ''manner'' (section&amp;nbsp;I); "For the medium being the same, and the objects the same, the poet may imitate by narration—in which case he can either take another personality, as Homer does, or speak in his own person, unchanged—or he may present all his characters as living and moving before us" (section&amp;nbsp;III).

Though they conceive of mimesis in quite different ways, its relation with diegesis is identical in Plato's and Aristotle's formulations.

In [[ludology]], mimesis is sometimes used to refer to the self-consistency of a represented world, and the availability of in-game rationalisations for elements of the gameplay. In this context, mimesis has an associated grade: highly self-consistent worlds that provide explanations for their puzzles and game mechanics are said to display a higher degree of mimesis. This usage can be traced back to the essay "Crimes Against Mimesis".&lt;ref name=crimes&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/aetus_kane/writing/cam.html |title=Crimes Against Mimesis |accessdate=2006-12-17 |last=Giner-Sorolla |first=Roger |date=April 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050619081931/http://www.geocities.com/aetus_kane/writing/cam.html |archivedate=19 June 2005}} This is a reformatted version of a set of articles originally posted to Usenet:

===Dionysian ''imitatio''===
{{main article|Dionysian imitatio}}
'''Dionysian imitatio''' is the influential [[literary method]] of imitation as formulated by Greek author [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] in the 1st century BCE, which conceived it as technique of [[rhetoric]]: emulating, adaptating, reworking and enriching a source text by an earlier author.&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"&gt;Ruthven (1979) pp. 103–4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jansen"&gt;Jansen (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Dionysius' concept marked a significant depart from the concept of ''mimesis'' formulated by [[Aristotle]]'s in the 4th century BCE, which was only concerned with "imitation of nature" instead of the "imitation of other authors".&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"/&gt; Latin orators and rhetoricians adopted the literary method of Dionysius' ''imitatio'' and discarded Aristotle's ''mimesis''.&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"/&gt;

==Samuel Taylor Coleridge==
Mimesis, or imitation, as he referred to it, was a crucial concept for [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s theory of the [[imagination]]. Coleridge begins his thoughts on imitation and poetry from Plato, Aristotle, and [[Philip Sidney]], adopting their concept of imitation of nature instead of other writers. His middling{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} departure from the earlier thinkers lies in his arguing that art does not reveal a unity of essence through its ability to achieve sameness with nature. Coleridge claims:
{{quote|[T]he composition of a poem is among the imitative arts; and that imitation, as opposed to copying, consists either in the interfusion of the SAME throughout the radically DIFFERENT, or the different throughout a base radically the same.&lt;ref&gt;Coleridge, S.T. (1983) ''Biographia Literaria.'' v.1 eds. James Engell and W. Jackson Bate. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press. p. 72. {{ISBN|0-691-09874-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Here, Coleridge opposes imitation to copying, the latter referring to [[William Wordsworth]]'s notion that poetry should duplicate nature by capturing actual speech. Coleridge instead argues that the unity of essence is revealed precisely through different materialities and media. Imitation, therefore, reveals the sameness of processes in nature.

==Luce Irigaray==
The Belgian feminist [[Luce Irigaray]] used the term to describe a form of resistance where women imperfectly imitate stereotypes about themselves so as to show up these stereotypes and undermine them.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.iep.utm.edu/i/irigaray.htm#SH4a].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Michael Taussig==
{{Further|Cultural appropriation|Appropriation (sociology)}}
In ''Mimesis and Alterity'' (1993), the [[anthropologist]] [[Michael Taussig]] examines the way that people from one culture adopt another's nature and culture (the process of mimesis) at the same time as distancing themselves from it (the process of [[alterity]]). He describes how a legendary tribe, the "white Indians", or [[Kuna (people)|Cuna]], have adopted in various representations figures and images reminiscent of the white people they encountered in the past (without acknowledging doing so).

Taussig, however, criticises anthropology for reducing yet another culture, that of the Cuna, for having been so impressed by the exotic technologies of the whites that they raised them to the status of gods. To Taussig this [[reductionism]] is suspect, and he argues this from both sides in his ''Mimesis and Alterity'' to see values in the [[anthropologist]]s' perspective while simultaneously defending the independence of a lived culture from the perspective of anthropological reductionism.&lt;ref&gt;Taussig, 1993:47, 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

==René Girard==
In ''Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World'' (1978), [[René Girard#Mimetic desire|René Girard]] posits that human behavior is based upon mimesis, and that imitation can engender pointless conflict. Girard notes the productive potential of competition: "It is because of this unprecedented capacity to promote competition within limits that always remain socially, if not individually, acceptable that we have all the amazing achievements of the modern world," but states that competition stifles progress once it becomes an end in itself: "rivals are more apt to forget about whatever objects are the cause of the rivalry and instead become more fascinated with one another."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=René|last=Girard|title=Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World|publisher=Stanford University Press|date=1987|pages=7, 26, 307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Pareto Efficient Frontier for the Markowitz Portfolio selection problem..png|thumb|right|200px|Plot of two criteria when maximizing return and minimizing risk in [[Portfolio (finance)|financial portfolios]] (Pareto-optimal points in red)]]
'''Multiple-criteria decision-making''' ('''MCDM''') or '''multiple-criteria decision analysis''' ('''MCDA''') is a sub-discipline of [[operations research]] that explicitly evaluates multiple conflicting [[wikt:criterion|criteria]] in [[decision making]] (both in daily life and in settings such as business, government and medicine).  Conflicting criteria are typical in evaluating options: [[cost]] or price is usually one of the main criteria, and some measure of quality is typically another criterion, easily in conflict with the cost.  In purchasing a car, cost, comfort, safety, and fuel economy may be some of the main criteria we consider – it is unusual that the cheapest car is the most comfortable and the safest one.  In [[Investment management|portfolio management]], we are interested in getting high returns but at the same time reducing our risks, but the stocks that have the potential of bringing high returns typically also carry high risks of losing money.  In a service industry, customer satisfaction and the cost of providing service are fundamental conflicting criteria.&lt;ref&gt;Madurika, HKGM, &amp; Hemakumara, GPTS. (2015). Gis Based Analysis For Suitability Location Finding In The Residential Development Areas Of Greater Matara Region. International Journal of Scientific &amp; Technology Research, 4(8), 96-105.&lt;/ref&gt;

In our daily lives, we usually weigh multiple criteria implicitly and we may be comfortable with the consequences of such decisions that are made based on only [[Intuition (psychology)|intuition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Rew, L.| year=1988| title=Intuition in Decision‐making| journal=Journal of Nursing Scholarship| volume=20| number=3| pp=150-154| doi=10.1111/j.1547-5069.1988.tb00056.x| subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, when stakes are high, it is important to properly structure the problem and explicitly evaluate multiple criteria.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} In making the decision of whether to build a nuclear power plant or not, and where to build it, there are not only very complex issues involving multiple criteria, but there are also multiple parties who are deeply affected by the consequences.

Structuring complex problems well and considering multiple criteria explicitly leads to more informed and better decisions.  There have been important advances in this field since the start of the modern multiple-criteria decision-making discipline in the early 1960s.

==Foundations, concepts, definitions==

MCDM or MCDA are well-known acronyms for ''multiple-criteria decision-making'' and ''multiple-criteria decision analysis''; Stanley Zionts helped popularizing the acronym with his 1979 article "MCDM – If not a Roman Numeral, then What?", intended for an entrepreneurial audience. 

MCDM is concerned with structuring and solving decision and planning problems involving multiple criteria. The purpose is to support decision-makers facing such problems. Typically, there does not exist a unique [[optimum|optimal]] solution for such problems and it is necessary to use decision-maker's preferences to differentiate between solutions.

"Solving" can be interpreted in different ways. It could correspond to choosing the "best" alternative from a set of available alternatives (where "best" can be interpreted as "the most preferred alternative" of a decision-maker).  Another interpretation of "solving" could be choosing a small set of good alternatives, or grouping alternatives into different preference sets. An extreme interpretation could be to find all "efficient" or "[[nondominated]]" alternatives (which we will define shortly).
	
The difficulty of the problem originates from the presence of more than one criterion. There is no longer a unique optimal solution to an MCDM problem that can be obtained without incorporating preference information. The concept of an optimal solution is often replaced by the set of nondominated solutions. A nondominated solution has the property that it is not possible to move away from it to any other solution without sacrificing in at least one criterion.  Therefore, it makes sense for the decision-maker to choose a solution from the nondominated set. Otherwise, she/he could do better in terms of some or all of the criteria, and not do worse in any of them. Generally, however, the set of nondominated solutions is too large to be presented to the decision-maker for the final choice. Hence we need tools that help the decision-maker focus on the preferred solutions (or alternatives). Normally one has to "tradeoff" certain criteria for others.

MCDM has been an active area of research since the 1970s. There are several MCDM-related organizations including the International Society on Multi-criteria Decision Making,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcdmsociety.org/|title=Multiple Criteria Decision Making - International Society on MCDM|author=|date=|website=www.mcdmsociety.org|accessdate=26 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171003052248/http://www.mcdmsociety.org/|archivedate=3 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Euro Working Group on MCDA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.put.poznan.pl/ewgmcda/|title=Welcome to EWG-MCDA website|author=|date=|website=www.cs.put.poznan.pl|accessdate=26 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007035425/http://www.cs.put.poznan.pl/ewgmcda/|archivedate=7 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and INFORMS Section on MCDM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.informs.org/Community/MCDM/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811111549/http://www.informs.org/Community/MCDM |archivedate=11 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For a history see: Köksalan, Wallenius and Zionts (2011).&lt;ref name="Multiple Criteria Decision Making: From Early History to the 21st Century"&gt;{{cite book|last=Köksalan, M., Wallenius, J., and Zionts, S.|title=Multiple Criteria Decision Making: From Early History to the 21st Century|year=2011|publisher=World Scientific|location=Singapore}}&lt;/ref&gt;
MCDM draws upon knowledge in many fields including:

* [[Mathematics]]
* [[Decision analysis]]
* [[Economics]]
* [[Computer technology]]
* [[Software engineering]]
* [[Information systems]]

===A typology===

There are different classifications of MCDM problems and methods.  A major distinction between MCDM problems is based on whether the solutions are explicitly or implicitly defined.

* ''Multiple-criteria evaluation problems'': These problems consist of a finite number of alternatives, explicitly known in the beginning of the solution process.  Each alternative is represented by its performance in multiple criteria.  The problem may be defined as finding the best alternative for a decision-maker (DM), or finding a set of good alternatives.  One may also be interested in "sorting" or "classifying" alternatives.  Sorting refers to placing alternatives in a set of preference-ordered classes (such as assigning credit-ratings to countries), and classifying refers to assigning alternatives to non-ordered sets (such as diagnosing patients based on their symptoms). Some of the MCDM methods in this category have been studied in a comparative manner in the book by Triantaphyllou on this subject, 2000.&lt;ref name='MCDMbook'&gt;{{cite book | last = Triantaphyllou | first = E. | title = Multi-Criteria Decision Making:  A Comparative Study | publisher = Kluwer Academic Publishers (now Springer) | year = 2000 | location = Dordrecht, The Netherlands | page = 320 | url = http://www.csc.lsu.edu/trianta/Books/DecisionMaking1/Book1.htm | doi =  | id =  | isbn = 0-7923-6607-7 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100624022632/http://csc.lsu.edu/trianta/Books/DecisionMaking1/Book1.htm | archivedate = 24 June 2010 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Multiple-criteria design problems (multiple objective mathematical programming problems)'':  In these problems, the alternatives are not explicitly known. An alternative (solution) can be found by solving a mathematical model.  The number of alternatives is either infinite and not countable (when some variables are continuous) or typically very large if countable (when all variables are discrete).

Whether it is an evaluation problem or a design problem, preference information of DMs is required in order to differentiate between solutions.  The solution methods for MCDM problems are commonly classified based on the timing of preference information obtained from the DM.

There are methods that require the DM's preference information at the start of the process, transforming the problem into essentially a single criterion problem.  These methods are said to operate by "prior articulation of preferences".  Methods based on estimating a value function or using the concept of "outranking relations", analytical hierarchy process, and some decision rule-based methods try to solve multiple criteria evaluation problems utilizing prior articulation of preferences.  Similarly, there are methods developed to solve multiple-criteria design problems using prior articulation of preferences by constructing a value function.  Perhaps the most well-known of these methods is goal programming.  Once the value function is constructed, the resulting single objective mathematical program is solved to obtain a preferred solution.

Some methods require preference information from the DM throughout the solution process.  These are referred to as interactive methods or methods that require "progressive articulation of preferences". These methods have been well-developed for both the multiple criteria evaluation (see for example Geoffrion, Dyer and Feinberg, 1972,&lt;ref&gt;An Interactive Approach for Multi-Criterion Optimization, with an Application to the Operation of an Academic Department,
A. M. Geoffrion, J. S. Dyer and A. Feinberg,
Management Science,
Vol. 19, No. 4, Application Series, Part 1 (Dec., 1972), pp. 357-368
Published by: INFORMS&lt;/ref&gt; and Köksalan and Sagala, 1995&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Köksalan, M.M. and Sagala, P.N.S.|title=Interactive Approaches for Discrete Alternative Multiple Criteria Decision Making with Monotone Utility Functions|journal=Management Science|year=1995|volume=41|pages=1158–1171|doi=10.1287/mnsc.41.7.1158|first1=M. M.|last2=Sagala|first2=P. N. S.|issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; ) and design problems (see Steuer, 1986&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steuer, R.E.|title=Multiple Criteria Optimization: Theory, Computation and Application|year=1986|publisher=John Wiley|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Multiple-criteria design problems typically require the solution of a series of mathematical programming models in order to reveal implicitly defined solutions.  For these problems, a representation or approximation of "efficient solutions" may also be of interest.  This category is referred to as "posterior articulation of preferences", implying that the DM's involvement starts posterior to the explicit revelation of "interesting" solutions (see for example Karasakal and Köksalan, 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Karasakal, E. K. and Köksalan, M.|title=Generating a Representative Subset of the Efficient Frontier in Multiple Criteria Decision Making|journal=Operations Research|year=2009|volume=57|pages=187–199|doi=10.1287/opre.1080.0581|first1=E.|last2=Koksalan|first2=M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

When the mathematical programming models contain integer variables, the design problems become harder to solve.  Multiobjective Combinatorial Optimization (MOCO) constitutes a special category of such problems posing substantial computational difficulty (see Ehrgott and Gandibleux,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Ehrgott, M.  |author2=Gandibleux, X. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Multiobjective Combinatorial Optimization|year=2002|series=Multiple Criteria Optimization, State of the Art Annotated Bibliographic Surveys|pages=369–444}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2002, for a review).

===Representations and definitions===

The MCDM problem can be represented in the criterion space or the decision space.  Alternatively, if different criteria are combined by a weighted linear function, it is also possible to represent the problem in the weight space.  Below are the demonstrations of the criterion and weight spaces as well as some formal definitions.

====Criterion space representation====

Let us assume that we evaluate solutions in a specific problem situation using several criteria.  Let us further assume that more is better in each criterion.  Then, among all possible solutions, we are ideally interested in those solutions that perform well in all considered criteria.  However, it is unlikely to have a single solution that performs well in all considered criteria.  Typically, some solutions perform well in some criteria and some perform well in others.  Finding a way of trading off between criteria is one of the main endeavors in the MCDM literature.

Mathematically, the MCDM problem corresponding to the above arguments can be represented as

::{{math|"max" &lt;var&gt;'''q'''&lt;/var&gt;}}

:: subject to

:::{{math|'''q''' ∈ '''Q'''}}

where {{math|'''q'''}} is the vector of ''k'' criterion functions (objective functions) and {{math|'''Q'''}} is the feasible set, {{math|'''Q''' ⊆ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

If {{math|'''Q'''}} is defined explicitly (by a set of alternatives), the resulting problem is called a multiple-criteria evaluation problem.

If {{math|'''Q'''}} is defined implicitly (by a set of constraints), the resulting problem is called a multiple-criteria design problem.

The quotation marks are used to indicate that the maximization of a vector is not a well-defined mathematical operation.  This corresponds to the argument that we will have to find a way to resolve the trade-off between criteria (typically based on the preferences of a decision maker) when a solution that performs well in all criteria does not exist.

====Decision space representation====

The decision space corresponds to the set of possible decisions that are available to us.  The criteria values will be consequences of the decisions we make.  Hence, we can define a corresponding problem in the decision space.  For example, in designing a product, we decide on the design parameters (decision variables) each of which affects the performance measures (criteria) with which we evaluate our product.

Mathematically, a multiple-criteria design problem can be represented in the decision space as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\max q &amp; = f(x) = f(x_1,\ldots,x_n) \\
\text{subject to} \\
q\in Q &amp; = \{f(x) : x\in X,\, X\subseteq \mathbb R^n\}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|&lt;var&gt;'''X'''&lt;/var&gt;}} is the feasible set and {{math|&lt;var&gt;'''x'''&lt;/var&gt;}} is the decision variable vector of size n.

A well-developed special case is obtained when {{math|&lt;var&gt;'''X'''&lt;/var&gt;}} is a polyhedron defined by linear inequalities and equalities. If all the objective functions are linear in terms of the decision variables, this variation leads to multiple objective linear programming (MOLP), an important subclass of MCDM problems.

There are several definitions that are central in MCDM.  Two closely related definitions are those of nondominance (defined based on the criterion space representation) and efficiency (defined based on the decision variable representation).

''Definition 1.''  {{math|'''q*''' ∈ '''Q'''}} is nondominated if there does not exist another {{math|'''q''' ∈ '''Q'''}} such that {{math|'''q''' ≥ '''q*'''}} and {{math|'''q''' ≠ '''q*'''}}.

Roughly speaking, a solution is nondominated so long as it is not inferior to any other available solution in all the considered criteria.

''Definition 2.''  {{math|'''x*''' ∈ '''X'''}} is efficient if there does not exist another {{math|'''x''' ∈ '''X'''}} such that {{math|'''f'''('''x''') ≥ '''f'''('''x'''*)}} and {{math|'''f'''('''x''') ≠ '''f'''('''x'''*)}}.

If an MCDM problem represents a decision situation well, then the most preferred solution of a DM has to be an efficient solution in the decision space, and its image is a nondominated point in the criterion space.  Following definitions are also important.

''Definition 3.''  {{math|'''q*''' ∈ '''Q'''}} is weakly nondominated if there does not exist another {{math|'''q''' ∈ '''Q'''}} such that {{math|'''q''' &gt; '''q*'''}}.

''Definition 4.''  {{math|'''x*''' ∈ '''X'''}} is weakly efficient if there does not exist another {{math|'''x''' ∈ '''X'''}} such that {{math|&lt;var&gt;'''f'''('''x''') &gt; '''f'''('''x'''*)}}.

Weakly nondominated points include all nondominated points and some special dominated points.  The importance of these special dominated points comes from the fact that they commonly appear in practice and special care is necessary to distinguish them from nondominated points.  If, for example, we maximize a single objective, we may end up with a weakly nondominated point that is dominated. The dominated points of the weakly nondominated set are located either on vertical or horizontal planes (hyperplanes) in the criterion space.

''Ideal point'': (in criterion space) represents the best (the maximum for maximization problems and the minimum for minimization problems) of each objective function and typically corresponds to an infeasible solution.

''Nadir point'': (in criterion space) represents the worst  (the minimum for maximization problems and the maximum for minimization problems) of each objective function among the points in the nondominated set and is typically a dominated point.

The ideal point and the nadir point are useful to the DM to get the "feel" of the range of solutions (although it is not straightforward to find the nadir point for design problems having more than two criteria).

====Illustrations of the decision and criterion spaces====

The following two-variable MOLP problem in the decision variable space will help demonstrate some of the key concepts graphically.

[[File:MCDMFigure1.png|thumb|Figure 1. Demonstration of the decision space
]]

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\max f_1(\mathbf{x}) &amp; = -x_1 + 2x_2 \\
\max f_2(\mathbf{x}) &amp; = 2x_1 - x_2 \\
\text{subject to} \\
x_1 &amp; \le 4 \\
x_2 &amp; \le 4 \\
x_1+x_2 &amp; \le 7 \\
-x_1+x_2 &amp; \le 3 \\
x_1 - x_2 &amp; \le 3 \\
x_1, x_2 &amp; \ge 0
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
	
In Figure 1, the extreme points "e" and "b" maximize the first and second objectives, respectively. The red boundary between those two extreme points represents the efficient set. It can be seen from the figure that, for any feasible solution outside the efficient set, it is possible to improve both objectives by some points on the efficient set. Conversely, for any point on the efficient set, it is not possible to improve both objectives by moving to any other feasible solution.  At these solutions, one has to sacrifice from one of the objectives in order to improve the other objective.

Due to its simplicity, the above problem can be represented in criterion space by replacing the {{math| &lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;'s}} with the {{math| &lt;var&gt;f&lt;/var&gt; 's}} as follows:

[[File:MCDMFigure2.png|thumb|Figure 2. Demonstration of the solutions in the criterion space]]

::{{math|Max &lt;var&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;}}

::{{math|Max &lt;var&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;}}

:: subject to

:::{{math| &lt;var&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + 2f&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ &lt;/var&gt; 12}}

:::{{math| &lt;var&gt;2f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + f&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ &lt;/var&gt; 12}}

:::{{math| &lt;var&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + f&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ &lt;/var&gt; 7}}

:::{{math| &lt;var&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; – f&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ &lt;/var&gt; 9}}

:::{{math| &lt;var&gt;-f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + f&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ &lt;/var&gt; 9}}

:::{{math| &lt;var&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + 2f&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ &lt;/var&gt; 0}}

:::{{math| &lt;var&gt;2f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + f&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ &lt;/var&gt; 0}}

We present the criterion space graphically in Figure 2.  It is easier to detect the nondominated points (corresponding to efficient solutions in the decision space) in the criterion space. The north-east region of the feasible space constitutes the set of nondominated points (for maximization problems).

===Generating nondominated solutions===

There are several ways to generate nondominated solutions.  We will discuss two of these.  The first approach can generate a special class of nondominated solutions whereas the second approach can generate any nondominated solution.

* ''Weighted sums'' (Gass &amp; Saaty, 1955&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gass|first=S.|author2=Saaty, T.|title=Parametric Objective Function Part II|journal=Operations Research|year=1955|volume=3|pages=316–319|doi=10.1287/opre.2.3.316 }}&lt;/ref&gt;)

If we combine the multiple criteria into a single criterion by multiplying each criterion with a positive weight and summing up the weighted criteria, then the solution to the resulting single criterion problem is a special efficient solution.  These special efficient solutions appear at  corner points of the set of available solutions.  Efficient solutions that are not at corner points have special characteristics and this method is not capable of finding such points.  Mathematically, we can represent this situation as

::{{math|max &lt;var&gt; '''w'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;.'''q'''&lt;/var&gt;}} = {{math|&lt;var&gt; '''w'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;.'''f(x)''', '''w'''&gt; &lt;/var&gt;0}}

:: subject to

:::{{math|&lt;var&gt;'''x''' ∈ '''X'''&lt;/var&gt;}}

By varying the weights, weighted sums can be used for generating efficient extreme point solutions for design problems, and supported (convex nondominated) points for evaluation problems.

* ''Achievement scalarizing function'' (Wierzbicki, 1980&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wierzbicki|first=A.|title=The Use of Reference Objectives in Multiobjective Optimization|journal=Lecture Notes in Economics and Mathematical Systems|year=1980|volume=177|series=Springer, Berlin|pages=468–486|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-48782-8_32}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

[[File:MCDMFigure3.png|thumb|Figure 3. Projecting points onto the nondominated set with an Achievement Scalarizing Function]]

Achievement scalarizing functions also combine multiple criteria into a single criterion by weighting them in a very special way.  They create rectangular contours going away from a reference point towards the available efficient solutions.  This special structure empower achievement scalarizing functions to reach any efficient solution.  This is a powerful property that makes these functions very useful for MCDM problems.

Mathematically, we can represent the corresponding problem as

::{{math|Min &lt;var&gt;s('''g, q, w,''' ρ)&lt;/var&gt;}} =  {{math|Min  {max&lt;var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; [(g&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; – q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;)/w&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; ] + ρ ∑&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; (g&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;- q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/var&gt;}}},	

::subject to

:::{{math|&lt;var&gt;'''q''' ∈ '''Q'''&lt;/var&gt;}}

The achievement scalarizing function can be used to project any point (feasible or infeasible) on the efficient frontier. Any point (supported or not) can be reached. The second term in the objective function is required to avoid generating inefficient solutions. Figure 3 demonstrates how a feasible point, {{math|&lt;var&gt;'''g'''&lt;sub&gt;'''1'''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;}}, and an infeasible point, {{math|&lt;var&gt;'''g'''&lt;sub&gt;'''2'''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;}}, are projected onto the nondominated points, {{math|&lt;var&gt;'''q'''&lt;sub&gt;'''1'''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;}} and {{math|&lt;var&gt;'''q'''&lt;sub&gt;'''2'''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/var&gt;}}, respectively, along the direction {{math|&lt;var&gt;'''w'''&lt;/var&gt;}} using an achievement scalarizing function.  The dashed and solid contours correspond to the objective function contours with and without the second term of the objective function, respectively.

===Solving MCDM problems===

Different schools of thought have developed for solving MCDM problems (both of the design and evaluation type). For a bibliometric study showing their development over time, see Bragge, Korhonen, H. Wallenius and J. Wallenius [2010].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bragge|first=J. |author2=Korhonen, P. |author3=Wallenius, H. |author4=Wallenius, J.|title=Bibliometric Analysis of Multiple Criteria Decision Making/Multiattribute Utility Theory|journal=IXX International MCDM Conference Proceedings, (Eds.)

'''''Multiple objective mathematical programming school'''''

(1) ''Vector maximization'': The purpose of vector maximization is to approximate the nondominated set; originally developed for Multiple Objective Linear Programming problems (Evans and Steuer, 1973;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Evans|first=J.|author2=Steuer, R.|title=A Revised Simplex Method for Linear Multiple Objective Programs|journal=Mathematical Programming|year=1973|volume=5|pages=54–72|doi=10.1007/BF01580111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yu and Zeleny, 1975&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yu|first=P.L.|author2=Zeleny, M.|title=The Set of All Non-Dominated Solutions in Linear Cases and a Multicriteria Simplex Method|journal=Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications|year=1975|volume=49|pages=430–468|doi=10.1016/0022-247X(75)90189-4|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

No explicit knowledge of the DM's value function is assumed.

'''''[[Goal programming|Goal programming school]]'''''

The purpose is to set apriori target values for goals, and to minimize weighted deviations from these goals. Both importance weights as well as lexicographic pre-emptive weights have been used (Charnes and Cooper, 1961&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Charnes, A. and [[William W. Cooper|Cooper, W.W.]]|title=Management Models and Industrial Applications of Linear Programming|year=1961|publisher=Wiley|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

'''''Fuzzy-set theorists'''''

Fuzzy sets were introduced by Zadeh (1965)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zadeh|first=L.|title=Fuzzy Sets|journal=Information and Control|year=1965|volume=8|pages=338–353|doi=10.1016/S0019-9958(65)90241-X|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an extension of the classical notion of sets. This idea is used in many MCDM algorithms to model and solve fuzzy problems.

'''''Multi-attribute utility theorists'''''

[[Multi-attribute utility]] or value functions are elicited and used to identify the most preferred alternative or to rank order the alternatives. Elaborate interview techniques, which exist for eliciting linear additive utility functions and multiplicative nonlinear utility functions, are used (Keeney and Raiffa, 1976&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Keeney, R.  |author2=Raiffa, H. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Decisions with Multiple Objectives: Preferences and Value Tradeoffs|year=1976|publisher=Wiley|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

'''''French school'''''

The French school focuses on decision aiding, in particular the [[ELECTRE]] family of outranking methods that originated in France during the mid-1960s. The method was first proposed by Bernard Roy (Roy, 1968&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roy|first=B.|title=La méthode ELECTRE|journal=Revue d'Informatique et de Recherche Opérationelle (RIRO)|year=1968|volume=8|pages=57–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

'''''Evolutionary multiobjective optimization school (EMO)'''''

EMO algorithms start with an initial population, and update it by using processes designed to mimic natural survival-of-the-fittest principles and genetic variation operators to improve the average population from one generation to the next. The goal is to converge to a population of solutions which represent the nondominated set (Schaffer, 1984;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shaffer|first=J.D.|title=Some Experiments in Machine Learning Using Vector Evaluated Genetic Algorithms, PhD thesis|year=1984|publisher=Vanderbilt University|location=Nashville}}&lt;/ref&gt; Srinivas and Deb, 1994&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Srinivas|first=N.|author2=Deb, K.|title=Multiobjective Optimization Using Nondominated Sorting in Genetic Algorithms|journal=Evolutionary Computation|year=1994|volume=2|pages=221–248|doi=10.1162/evco.1994.2.3.221|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  More recently, there are efforts to incorporate preference information into the solution process of EMO algorithms (see Deb and Köksalan, 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deb|first=K.|author2=Köksalan, M.|title=Guest Editorial Special Issue on Preference-Based Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithms|journal=IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation|year=2010|volume=14|pages=669–670|doi=10.1109/TEVC.2010.2070371|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

'''''[[Analytic hierarchy process|Analytic hierarchy process (AHP)]]'''''

The AHP first decomposes the decision problem into a hierarchy of subproblems. Then the decision-maker evaluates the relative importance of its various elements by pairwise comparisons. The AHP converts these evaluations to numerical values (weights or priorities), which are used to calculate a score for each alternative (Saaty, 1980&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Saaty|first=T.L.|title=The Analytic Hierarchy Process: Planning, Priority Setting, Resource Allocation|year=1980|publisher=McGraw-Hill,|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;). A consistency index measures the extent to which the decision-maker has been consistent in her responses. AHP is one of the more controversial techniques listed here, with some researchers in the MCDA community believing it to be flawed. The underlying mathematics is also more complicated, though it has gained some popularity as a result of commercially available software.

Several papers reviewed the application of MCDM techniques in various disciplines such as fuzzy MCDM,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mardani|first=Abbas|last2=Jusoh|first2=Ahmad|last3=Zavadskas|first3=Edmundas Kazimieras|date=2015-05-15|title=Fuzzy multiple criteria decision-making techniques and applications – Two decades review from 1994 to 2014|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417415000081|journal=Expert Systems with Applications|volume=42|issue=8|pages=4126–4148|doi=10.1016/j.eswa.2015.01.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Naxi language]] of southwestern [[China]] may be written in the syllabic [[geba syllabary|''geba'' script]]. There is also a Naxi tradition of pictographic symbols called [[Dongba symbols|''dongba'']]; this may sometimes be [[Interlinear gloss|gloss]]ed with ''geba'' for clarification, since a ''dongba'' text may be intelligible only to its author. 

A [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]] was developed for Naxi in the 20th century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3001">In [[mathematics]], a '''near-semiring''' (also ''seminearring'') is an [[abstract algebra|algebraic]] [[algebraic structure|structure]] more general than a [[near-ring]] or a [[semiring]]. Near-semirings arise naturally from [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] on [[monoid]]s.

== Definition ==
A near-semiring is a set ''S'' with two binary operations "+" and "·", and a constant 0 such that (''S''; +; 0) is a [[monoid]] (not necessarily commutative), (''S''; ·) is a semigroup, these structures are related by one (right or left) [[distributive law]], and accordingly the 0 is one (right or left, respectively) side [[absorbing element]].

Formally, an algebraic structure (''S''; +, ·, 0) is said to be a near-semiring if it satisfies the following axioms:

# (''S''; +, 0) is a monoid,
# (''S''; ·) is a semigroup,
# (''a'' + ''b'') · ''c'' = ''a'' · ''c'' + ''b'' · ''c'', for all ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' in ''S'', and
# 0 · ''a'' = 0 for all ''a'' in ''S''. 

Near-semirings are a common abstraction of semirings and near-rings [Golan, 1999; Pilz, 1983]. The standard examples of near-semirings are typically of the form ''M''(Г), the set of all mappings on a monoid (Г; +, 0), equipped with composition of mappings, pointwise addition of mappings, and the constantly 0 function. Subsets of ''M''(Г) closed under the operations provide further examples of near-semirings. Another example is the ordinals under the usual operations of [[ordinal arithmetic]] (here Clause 3 should be replaced with its symmetric form ''c'' · (''a'' + ''b'')  =  ''c'' · ''a'' + ''c'' · ''b''. Strictly speaking, the [[Class (set theory)|class]] of all ordinals is not a set, so the above example should be more appropriately called a ''class near-semiring''. We get a near-semiring in the standard sense if we restrict to those ordinals strictly less than some [[Additively indecomposable ordinal|multiplicatively indecomposable ordinal]].

The comma is omitted on the authority of section 14(3)(a) of the [[Interpretation Act 2005]].&lt;/ref&gt; is an Act of the [[Oireachtas]] which virtually codified the criminal law on [[offences against the person]] in the [[Republic of Ireland]]. The Act replaced the greater part of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]], scrapping such concepts as [[actual bodily harm]] and [[grievous bodily harm]], and recognised the use of modern technology as a weapon:

:'''"force" includes...application of heat, light, electric current, noise or any other form of energy''' -Section 2.2(a)

The Act also made it an offence to use a syringe as a weapon, particularly where it is used to make the victim "...believe that he or she may become infected with disease".

In [[mathematical logic]], and more specifically in [[model theory]], an infinite [[structure (mathematical logic)|structure]] (''M'',&amp;lt;,...) which is [[Total order|totally ordered]] by &lt; is called an '''o-minimal structure''' if and only if every [[definable set|definable]] subset ''X''&amp;nbsp;⊂&amp;nbsp;''M'' (with parameters taken from ''M'') is a finite [[union (set theory)|union]] of [[interval (mathematics)|interval]]s and points.

O-minimality can be regarded as a weak form of [[quantifier elimination]]. A structure ''M'' is o-minimal if and only if every formula with one free variable and parameters in ''M'' is equivalent to a quantifier-free formula involving only the ordering, also with parameters in ''M''. This is analogous to the [[strongly minimal theory|minimal]] structures, which are exactly the analogous property down to equality.

A [[Theory (mathematical logic)|theory]] ''T'' is an '''o-minimal theory''' if every [[Model theory|model]] of ''T'' is o-minimal. It is known that the complete theory ''T'' of an o-minimal structure is an o-minimal theory.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Pillay and Steinhorn (1986), Pillay and Steinhorn (1988).&lt;/ref&gt; This result is remarkable because, in contrast, the [[complete theory]] of a minimal structure need not be a [[strongly minimal theory]], that is, there may be an elementarily equivalent structure which is not minimal.

==Set-theoretic definition==

O-minimal structures can be defined without recourse to model theory.  Here we define a structure on a nonempty set ''M'' in a set-theoretic manner, as a sequence ''S''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0,1,2,... such that
# ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|boolean algebra]] of subsets of ''M''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;
# if ''A''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; then ''M''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''A'' and ''A''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;''M'' are in ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;
# the set {(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''M''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;} is in ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;
# if ''A''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''π''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''M''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''M''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is the projection map on the first ''n'' coordinates, then ''π''(''A'')&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

If ''M'' has a dense linear order without endpoints on it, say &lt;, then a structure ''S'' on ''M'' is called o-minimal if it satisfies the extra axioms

&lt;ol start="5"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the set {(''x'',''y'')&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''M''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''y''} is in ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the sets in ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; are precisely the finite unions of intervals and points.
&lt;/ol&gt;

The "o" stands for "order", since any o-minimal structure requires an ordering on the underlying set.

==Model theoretic definition==

O-minimal structures originated in model theory and so have a simpler &amp;mdash; but equivalent &amp;mdash; definition using the language of model theory.&lt;ref&gt;Marker (2002) p.81&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically if ''L'' is a language including a binary relation &lt;, and (''M'',&lt;,...) is an ''L''-structure where &lt; is interpreted to satisfy the axioms of a dense linear order,&lt;ref&gt;The condition that the interpretation of &lt; be dense is not strictly necessary, but it is known that discrete orders lead to essentially trivial o-minimal structures, see, for example, {{MR|0899083}} and {{MR|0943306}}.&lt;/ref&gt; then (''M'',&lt;,...) is called an o-minimal structure if for any definable set ''X''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''M'' there are finitely many open intervals ''I''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,..., ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; with endpoints in ''M''&amp;nbsp;∪&amp;nbsp;{±∞} and a finite set ''X''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;X=X_0\cup I_1\cup\ldots\cup I_r.&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==

Examples of o-minimal theories are:
* The complete theory of dense linear orders in the language with just the ordering.
* RCF, the [[theory]] of [[real closed field]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Marker (2002) p.99&lt;/ref&gt;
* The complete theory of the [[real number|real field]] with restricted [[analytic function]]s added (i.e. analytic functions on a neighborhood of [0,1]&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, restricted to [0,1]&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;; note that the unrestricted sine function has infinitely many roots, and so cannot be definable in an o-minimal structure.)
* The complete theory of the real field with a symbol for the [[exponential function]] by [[Wilkie's theorem]]. More generally, the complete theory of the real numbers with [[Pfaffian function]]s added.
* The last two examples can be combined: given any o-minimal expansion of the real field (such as the real field with restricted analytic functions), one can define its Pfaffian closure, which is again an o-minimal structure.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Speisseger, ''Pfaffian sets and o-minimality,'' in: Lecture notes on o-minimal structures and real analytic geometry, C. Miller, J.-P. Rolin, and P. Speissegger (eds.), Fields Institute Communications vol. 62, 2012, pp.&amp;nbsp;179–218. {{doi|10.1007/978-1-4614-4042-0_5}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The Pfaffian closure of a structure is, in particular, closed under Pfaffian chains where arbitrary definable functions are used in place of polynomials.)

In the case of RCF, the definable sets are the [[semialgebraic set]]s. Thus the study of o-minimal structures and theories generalises [[real algebraic geometry]]. A major line of current research is based on discovering expansions of the real ordered field that are o-minimal. Despite the generality of application, one can show a great deal about the geometry of set definable in o-minimal structures. There is a cell decomposition theorem,&lt;ref&gt;Marker (2002) p.103&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hassler Whitney|Whitney]] and [[Jean-Louis Verdier|Verdier]] [[Stratification (mathematics)|stratification]] theorems and a good notion of dimension and Euler characteristic.

'''''On the Waterfront''''' is a 1954 American [[crime drama]] film directed by [[Elia Kazan]], and written by [[Budd Schulberg]]. It stars [[Marlon Brando]], and features [[Karl Malden]], [[Lee J. Cobb]], [[Rod Steiger]], Pat Henning and [[Eva Marie Saint]] in her film debut. The soundtrack score was composed by [[Leonard Bernstein]]. The film was suggested by "Crime on the Waterfront" by [[Malcolm Johnson (journalist)|Malcolm Johnson]], a series of articles published in November–December 1948 in the ''[[The New York Sun (historical)|New York Sun]]'' which won the 1949 [[Pulitzer Prize for Local Reporting]], but the screenplay by [[Budd Schulberg]] is directly based on his own original story.&lt;ref name=afi&gt;{{AFI film|51286}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film focuses on [[union violence]] and corruption amongst [[Stevedore|longshoremen]], while detailing widespread [[Political corruption|corruption]], [[extortion]], and [[Racket (crime)|racketeering]] on the waterfronts of [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]], [[New Jersey]].

''On the Waterfront'' was a critical and commercial success, and received twelve [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, winning eight, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Brando, [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Saint, and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Kazan. In 1997, it was ranked by the [[American Film Institute]] as [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies|the eighth-greatest American movie of all time]], and in AFI's 2007 list, it was ranked 19th. It is Bernstein's only original film score not adapted from a stage production with songs.

In 1989, ''On the Waterfront'' was deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" by the [[Library of Congress]], and selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]].

==Plot==
[[American Mafia|Mob]]-connected union boss Johnny Friendly ([[Lee J. Cobb]]) gloats about his iron-fisted control of the waterfront. The police and the [[Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor|Waterfront Crime Commission]] know that Friendly is behind a number of murders, but witnesses play "D and D" ("deaf and dumb"), accepting their subservient position, rather than risking the danger and shame of informing.

Terry Malloy ([[Marlon Brando]]) is a dockworker whose brother Charley "the Gent" ([[Rod Steiger]]) is Friendly's right-hand man. Some years earlier, Terry had been a promising boxer, until Friendly had Charley instruct him to deliberately lose a fight that he could have won, so that Friendly could win money betting against him. Terry is used to coax Joey Doyle (Ben Wagner), a popular dockworker, into an ambush, preventing Joey from testifying against Friendly before the Crime Commission. Terry assumed that Friendly's enforcers were only going to "lean" on Joey to pressure him into silence, and is surprised when Joey is killed.

Joey's sister Edie ([[Eva Marie Saint]]), angry about her brother's death, shames "waterfront priest" Father Barry ([[Karl Malden]]) into fomenting action against the mob-controlled union. Friendly sends Terry to attend and inform on a dockworkers' meeting Father Barry holds in the church, which is broken up by Friendly's men. Terry helps Edie escape the violence, and is smitten with her. Another dockworker, Timothy J. "Kayo" Dugan (Pat Henning), who agrees to testify after Father Barry promises unwavering support, ends up dead after Friendly arranges for him to be crushed by a load of whiskey in a staged accident.

Although Terry resents being used as a tool in Joey's death, and despite Father Barry's impassioned "sermon on the docks" reminding the longshoremen that Christ walks among them and that every murder is a [[Calvary]], Terry is at first willing to remain "D and D", even when [[subpoena]]ed to testify. However, when Edie, unaware of Terry's role in her brother's death, begins to return Terry's feelings, Terry is tormented by his awakening conscience and confesses the circumstances of Joey's death to Father Barry and Edie. Horrified, Edie breaks up with him.

As Terry increasingly leans toward testifying, Friendly decides that Terry must be killed unless Charley can coerce him into keeping quiet. Charley tries bribing Terry with a good job and finally threatens Terry by holding a gun against him, but recognizes that he has failed to sway Terry, who blames his own downward spiral on his well-off brother. In what has become an iconic scene, Terry reminds Charley that had it not been for the fixed fight, Terry's prizefighting career would have bloomed. "I coulda' been somebody. I coulda' been a contender", laments Terry to his brother, "Instead of a bum, which is what I am – let's face it." Charley gives Terry the gun, and advises him to run. Terry flees to Edie's apartment, where she first refuses to let him in, but finally admits her love for him. Friendly, having had Charley watched, has Charley murdered and his body hung in an alley as bait to lure Terry out to his death, but Terry and Edie both escape the attempt on Terry's life.

After finding Charley's body, Terry sets out to shoot Friendly, but Father Barry prevents it by blocking Terry's line of fire and convincing Terry to fight Friendly by testifying instead. Terry proceeds to give damaging testimony implicating Friendly in Joey's murder and other illegal activities, causing Friendly's mob boss to cut him off and Friendly to face [[indictment]].

After the testimony, Friendly announces that Terry will not find employment anywhere on the waterfront. Terry is shunned by his former friends and by a neighborhood boy who had previously looked up to him. Refusing Edie's suggestion that they move away from the waterfront together, Terry shows up during recruitment at the docks. When he is the only man not hired, Terry openly confronts Friendly, calling him out and proclaiming that he is proud of what he did. The confrontation develops into a vicious brawl, with Terry getting the upper hand until Friendly's thugs gang up on Terry and nearly beat him to death. The dockworkers, who witness the confrontation, show their support for Terry by refusing to work, unless Terry is working, too, and pushing Friendly into the river. Encouraged by Father Barry and Edie, the badly injured Terry forces himself to his feet and enters the dock, followed by the other workers. A soaking wet and face-scarred Friendly, now left with nothing, swears revenge on them all, but his threats fall on deaf ears as they enter the garage, and the door closes behind them.

==Production==
===Screenplay and political context===
The film is widely considered to be [[Elia Kazan]]'s answer to those who criticized him for identifying eight (former) Communists in the film industry before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee|House Committee on Un-American Activities]] (HUAC) in 1952. One of Kazan's critics was his friend and collaborator, the noted playwright [[Arthur Miller]], who had earlier written the first version of the script, originally entitled ''The Hook''. Kazan had agreed to direct it, and in 1951 they met with [[Harry Cohn]] at [[Columbia Pictures]] about making the picture. Cohn agreed in principle to make ''The Hook'', but there were concerns about the portrayal of corrupt union officials.{{cn|date=January 2018}} When Cohn asked the antagonists be changed to Communists, Miller refused. Cohn sent a letter telling Miller it was interesting he had resisted Columbia's desire to make the movie "pro-American". Kazan asked Miller to rewrite the script; Miller declined due to his disenchantment with Kazan's friendly testimony before the HUAC. Kazan then replaced Miller with [[Budd Schulberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Geneveive | last=Haas | title=Dartmouth acquires Budd Schulberg '36 papers | date=November 21, 2006 | url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~news/releases/2006/11/21a.html | work=Dartmouth News | accessdate=January 6, 2007 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206144751/http://www.dartmouth.edu/~news/releases/2006/11/21a.html | archivedate=February 6, 2007 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After rewriting the script, Schulberg and Kazan approached [[Darryl F. Zanuck]], who eventually told them he did not like a single thing about the script, asking, "Who's going to care about a bunch of sweaty longshoremen?" This led Kazan and Schulberg to meet with independent producer [[Sam Spiegel]], who set up a deal with Columbia. Spiegel was insistent on Schulberg delivering a perfect screenplay, and barraged the writer with changes and suggestions, to the frustration of Schulberg.

Schulberg's script nonetheless went through a number of changes before reaching the screen. In an early draft, the Terry Malloy character was not an ex-pug dockworker, but a cynical investigative reporter, as well as an older, divorced man.

===Real-life basis for characters===

Terry Malloy's fight against corruption was in part modeled after whistle-blowing longshoreman Anthony DeVincenzo, who testified before a real-life [[Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor|Waterfront Commission]] about activities on the Hoboken Docks and suffered a degree of ostracism for his deed. DeVincenzo sued and settled, many years after, with [[Columbia Pictures]] over the appropriation of what he considered his story. DeVincenzo claimed to have recounted his story to screenwriter [[Budd Schulberg]] during a month-long session of waterfront barroom meetings. Schulberg attended DeVincenzo's waterfront commission testimony every day during the hearing.

The character of Father Barry was based on the real-life "waterfront priest" [[John M. Corridan|Father John M. Corridan]], a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priest and graduate of [[Regis High School (New York City)|Regis High School]] who operated a Roman Catholic labor school on the [[West Side (Manhattan)|west side of Manhattan]]. Father Corridan was interviewed extensively by Schulberg, who also wrote the foreword to a biography of Father Corridan, ''Waterfront Priest'' by Allen Raymond.

The character of Johnny Friendly was partially based on [[International Longshoremen's Association]] boss [[Michael Clemente]]. Friendly also had aspects of former [[Murder, Inc.]] head [[Albert Anastasia]], who was a top enforcer for the crime family that ran the Hoboken docks, the Luciano{{spnd}}later Genovese{{spnd}}family. In 1979, Clemente and other members of the Genovese family were indicted for corruption and racketeering on the New York waterfront.

===Casting===
According to [[Richard Schickel]] in his biography of Kazan, Marlon Brando initially refused the role of Terry Malloy, and [[Frank Sinatra]] (a native of [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]], where the film was being made) then had "a handshake deal"{{spnd}}but no formally signed contract{{spnd}}to play the part, even attending an initial costume fitting. But Kazan still favored Brando for the role, partly because casting Brando would assure a larger budget for the picture. While Brando's agent, Jay Kanter, attempted to persuade Brando to change his mind, Kazan enlisted actor Karl Malden, whom Kazan considered more suited to a career as a director than as an actor, to direct and film a screen test of a "more Brando-like" actor as Terry Malloy, in an effort to persuade Spiegel that "an actor like Marlon Brando" could perform the role more forcefully than Sinatra. To that end, Malden filmed a screen test of [[Actors Studio]] members [[Paul Newman]] and [[Joanne Woodward]] performing the love scene between Terry and Edie. Persuaded by the Newman/Woodward screen test, Spiegel agreed to reconsider Brando for the role, and shortly afterwards, Kanter convinced Brando to reconsider his refusal. Within a week, Brando signed a contract to perform in the film. At that point, a furious Sinatra demanded to be cast in the role of Father Barry, the waterfront priest. It was left to Spiegel to break the news to Sinatra that Malden had already been signed for that role.

The part of Edie Doyle was offered to [[Grace Kelly]], who turned it down, preferring to make ''[[Rear Window]]'' instead. Kazan said in his autobiography ''A Life'' that the choice of an actress to play Edie Doyle was narrowed down to [[Elizabeth Montgomery]] and [[Eva Marie Saint]]. There was something well-bred about Montgomery that Kazan thought would not be becoming for Edie,{{cn|date=January 2018}} who was raised on the waterfront in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]]. He gave the part to Saint.

The role of Terry's older brother Charley was originally offered to [[Lawrence Tierney]], who asked for too much money, so the role went to [[Rod Steiger]]. Despite playing Terry's older brother, Steiger was one year younger than Brando.

Several of the labor boss' men in the film, including [[Abe Simon]] as Barney, [[Tony Galento]] as Truck, and Tami Mauriello as Tillio, were former professional [[heavyweight]] boxers in real life.

===Filming locations===
''On the Waterfront'' was filmed over 36 days on location in various places in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]], including the docks, workers' slum dwellings, bars, littered alleys, and rooftops. The church used for exterior scenes in the film was the historic [[Church of Our Lady of Grace (Hoboken, New Jersey)|Our Lady of Grace]], built in 1874, while the interiors were shot at the Church of St. Peter and St. Paul at 400 Hudson Street.&lt;ref name=movielove&gt;{{cite movielove}}, p. 10-11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Upon its release, the film received positive reviews from critics, and was a commercial success, earning an estimated $4.2 million at the North American box office in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;'The Top Box-Office Hits of 1954', ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' (January 5, 1955)&lt;/ref&gt; In his July 29, 1954, review, ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' critic A. H. Weiler called the film "an uncommonly powerful, exciting, and imaginative use of the screen by gifted professionals".&lt;ref&gt;Weiler, A. H. [https://www.nytimes.com/1954/07/29/movies/19540729waterfront.html?_r=0 "Movie Review: On the Waterfront"] ''[[New York Times]]'' (July 29, 1954)&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a critical score of 98% with an average rating of 9.2/10 and a critical consensus of "With his electrifying performance in Elia Kazan's thought-provoking, expertly constructed melodrama, Marlon Brando redefined the possibilities of acting for film and helped permanently alter the cinematic landscape".&lt;ref name="RT"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/on_the_waterfront/ |title=On the Waterfront |publisher= [[Flixster]] | work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate= August 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Legacy'''

In 1989, the film was deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" by the [[Library of Congress]], and selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]]. It is also on the [[Vatican's list of films|Vatican's list of 45 greatest films]], compiled in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.usccb.org/movies/vaticanfilms.shtml |title=Vatican Best Films List |publisher=USCCB |accessdate=March 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home media==
{{Anchor|Video|DVD|DVD release}} The first home video release of the film was by [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment|Columbia Pictures Home Entertainment]] in 1982, on VHS and Beta. RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video later re-released it in 1984, 1986, and 1990, respectively, the latter being a part of the [[Columbia Classics]] line-up. Columbia TriStar later reissued the film on VHS in 1995 as part of the line-up's "Studio Heritage Collection", and the first DVD version was released in 2001. Among the special features is the featurette "Contender: Mastering the Method", a video photo gallery, an interview with Elia Kazan, an audio commentary, filmographies, production notes, and theatrical trailers. The film has been added to the [[Criterion Collection]]. 

The 2013 Criterion Collection release presents the film in three aspect ratios: 1.66:1, 1.85:1, and 1.33:1. The accompanying booklet explains the reasoning behind this choice: "In 1953, Columbia Pictures was transitioning to the new widescreen format and declared that all its upcoming films, including ''On The Waterfront'', would be suitable for projection in any aspect ratio from the full frame of 1.33:1 to the then widest standard of 1.85:1. The customary frame of European cinematographer Boris Kaufman (''Twelve Angry Men'', ''Baby Doll'') split the difference at 1.66:1, so that all that was required was for him to leave extra room at the top and bottom of the frame and make sure that nothing essential would be lost in the widescreen presentation. At its premiere in 1954, ''On The Waterfront'' was projected at 1.85:1. Over subsequent decades, millions of television viewers became accustomed to seeing the film with the open-matte 1.33:1 framing, a presentation that has carried over into the home video era. Here, for the first time, Criterion is presenting the film in all three aspect ratios so that viewers can compare and choose the version they prefer."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7153">'''Predictive intake modelling''' uses [[mathematical model]]ling strategies to estimate intake of food, [[personal care]] products, and their [[Formulations#Other examples of product formulations|formulations]].

== Definition ==

Predictive intake modelling seeks to estimate intake of products and/or their constituents which may enter the body through various routes such as ingestion, [[inhalation]] and [[Absorption (skin)|absorption]].

Predictive intake modelling can be applied to determine trends in food consumption and product use for the purpose of [[extrapolation]].

== Applications ==

A predictive intake modelling approach is used to estimate voluntary food intake (VFI) by animals where their eating habits cannot be exactly measured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hackmann T. J. |author2=Spain J. N. | year = 2010 | title = A mechanistic model for predicting intake of forage diets by ruminants | url = | journal = Journal of Animal Science | volume = 88 | issue = 3| pages = 1108–24 | doi=10.2527/jas.2008-1378}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Yoosuk S. |author2=Ong H.

G. Schutz, 1982 "Prediction of nutritional status from food consumption and consumer attitude data.," ''The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition'' vol. 35, no. 5 Suppl, pp. 1310–8&lt;/ref&gt; pesticides,&lt;ref&gt;P.

Predictive intake modelling has applications in [[public health]], [[Risk assessment#Risk assessment and human health|risk assessment]] and [[exposure assessment]], where estimating intake or exposure to different substances can influence the decision making process.

== Predictive intake modelling strategies ==

=== Regression approach ===

The [[regression analysis]] approach is based on estimations through extrapolation or interpolation where there is a cause-and-effect relationship found by data fitting.  These trends tend to be [[phenomenological model|phenomenological]].

=== Mechanistic modelling approach ===

A mechanistic modelling approach is one where a model is derived from basic theory. Examples of these include compartmental models which can be used to describe the circulation and concentration of airborne particles in a room or household for estimating intake of inhalants.&lt;ref&gt;M. Singal, "RIFM 2-Box Indoor Air Dispersion Model Is An Alternative Method To Calculate Inhalation Exposure To Fragrance," Research Institute for Fragrance Materials, 2012. [Online]. Available: http://www.rifm.org/press-detail.php?id=68. [Accessed: 28-Nov-2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Population-based approach ===

A population-based approach tracks consumer intake from individual members of a sample population over time. Mathematical models are used to combine these habits and practices databases with separate databases on product or food formulation to estimate intake or exposure for the sample population. Moreover, [[Sampling (statistics)#Survey weights|survey weights]] may be applied to each subject in the study based on their age, demographic and location allowing the sample of subjects to correctly represent an entire population, and thus estimate intake for that population.

=== Probabilistic modelling approach ===
Probabilistic models are based on the [[Monte Carlo methods|Monte Carlo]] method where distributions of data from various sources are randomly sampled from to calculate percentile statistics. Such probabilistic techniques typically utilise product or consumption survey data from a sample population combined with distributions of substances that may be found within those foods or products. For example, [[The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or USFDA)|The Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) suggest that the estimation of intake of substances in food can be probabilistically conducted through food consumption surveys ([[NHANES]]/[http://www.ars.usda.gov/Services/docs.htm?docid=7764 CSFII]) from sample populations combined with distributions of substance concentration data to calculate the Estimated Daily Intake.&lt;ref&gt;FDA, "Guidance for Industry: Estimating Dietary Intake of Substances in Food," 2006. [Online]. Available: http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/IngredientsAdditivesGRASPackaging/ucm074725.htm#mode. [Accessed: 24-Feb-2014].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA) funded the Monte Carlo Risk Assessment (MCRA) tool to estimate usual intake exposure distributions based on statistical models which utilise the EFSA Comprehensive Database, which contains detailed food consumption survey data.&lt;ref&gt;J.

Wapperoma, and H. van der Voet, "A European tool for usual intake distribution estimation in relation to data collection by EFSA," Bilthoven, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; EFSA also funded Creme Global to develop a model and databases of European food consumption on which statistical models can be run to assess intake and exposure on a pan-European basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Vilone G. |author2=Comiskey D |author3=Heraud F |author4=O'Mahony C | year = 2014 | title = Statistical method to assess usual dietary intakes in the European population | url = | journal = Food Addit Contam Part A Chem Anal Control Expo Risk Assess | volume = 31 | issue = 10| pages = 1639–51 | doi = 10.1080/19440049.2014.955886 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23147">In [[physics]], '''quasiparticles''' and '''collective excitations''' (which are closely related) are [[emergent phenomena]] that occur when a microscopically complicated system such as a [[solid]] behaves as if it contained different weakly interacting [[particle]]s in [[free space]]. For example, as an [[electron]] travels through a [[semiconductor]], its motion is disturbed in a complex way by its interactions with all of the other electrons and [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]]; however it approximately behaves like an electron with a different mass ([[effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]]) traveling unperturbed through [[free space]]. This "electron with a different mass" is called an "electron quasiparticle".&lt;ref name=Kaxiras/&gt; In another example, the aggregate motion of electrons in the [[valence band]] of a [[semiconductor]] or a hole band in a metal&lt;ref name="ashcroftandmermin"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ashcroft and Mermin|title=Solid State Physics|date=1976|publisher=Holt, Reinhart, and Winston|isbn=978-0030839931|pages=299–302|edition=1st|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the same as if the material instead contained positively charged quasiparticles called [[electron hole]]s. Other quasiparticles or collective excitations include [[phonon]]s (particles derived from the vibrations of atoms in a solid), [[plasmon]]s (particles derived from [[plasma oscillation]]s), and many others.

These particles are typically called "quasiparticles" if they are related to [[fermion]]s, and called "collective excitations" if they are related to [[boson]]s,&lt;ref name=Kaxiras/&gt; although the precise distinction is not universally agreed upon.&lt;ref name=Mattuck&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pe-v8zfxE68C&amp;pg=PA10 	''A guide to Feynman diagrams in the many-body problem'', by Richard D. Mattuck, p10]. "As we have seen, the quasiparticle consists of the original real, individual particle, plus a cloud of disturbed neighbors. It behaves very much like an individual particle, except that it has an effective mass and a lifetime. But there also exist other kinds of fictitious particles in many-body systems, i.e. 'collective excitations'. These do not center around individual particles, but instead involve collective, wavelike motion of ''all'' the particles in the system simultaneously."&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, electrons and [[electron hole]]s are typically called "quasiparticles", while phonons and plasmons are typically called "collective excitations".

The quasiparticle concept is most important in [[condensed matter physics]] since it is one of the few known ways of simplifying the [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] [[many-body problem]].

==Overview==

===General introduction===
[[Solid]]s are made of only three kinds of [[particle physics|particles]]: [[electron]]s, [[proton]]s, and [[neutron]]s. Quasiparticles are none of these; instead, each of them is an ''[[emergent phenomenon]]'' that occurs inside the solid. Therefore, while it is quite possible to have a single particle (electron or proton or neutron) floating in space, a quasiparticle can only exist inside interacting many-particle systems (primarily solids).

Motion in a solid is extremely complicated: Each electron and proton is pushed and pulled (by [[Coulomb's law]]) by all the other electrons and protons in the solid (which may themselves be in motion). It is these strong interactions that make it very difficult to predict and understand the behavior of solids (see [[many-body problem]]). On the other hand, the motion of a ''non-interacting'' classical particle is relatively simple; it would move in a straight line at constant velocity. This is the motivation for the concept of quasiparticles: The complicated motion of the ''real'' particles in a solid can be mathematically transformed into the much simpler motion of imagined quasiparticles, which behave more like non-interacting particles.

In summary, quasiparticles are a mathematical tool for simplifying the description of solids.

===Relation to many-body quantum mechanics===
[[Image:Energy levels.svg|thumb|right|Any system, no matter how complicated, has a [[ground state]] along with an infinite series of higher-energy [[excited state]]s.]]
The principal motivation for quasiparticles is that it is almost impossible to ''directly'' describe every particle in a macroscopic system. For example, a barely-visible (0.1mm) grain of sand contains around 10&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; nuclei and 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; electrons. Each of these attracts or repels every other by [[Coulomb's law]]. In principle, the [[Schrödinger equation]] predicts exactly how this system will behave. But the Schrödinger equation in this case is a [[partial differential equation]] (PDE) on a 3×10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;-dimensional vector space—one dimension for each coordinate (x,y,z) of each particle. Directly and straightforwardly trying to solve such a PDE is impossible in practice. Indeed, solving a PDE on a 2-dimensional space is typically much harder than solving a PDE on a 1-dimensional space (whether analytically or numerically); solving a PDE on a 3-dimensional space is significantly harder still; and thus solving a PDE on a 3×10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;-dimensional space is quite impossible by straightforward methods.

One simplifying factor is that the system as a whole, like any quantum system, has a [[ground state]] and various [[excited state]]s with higher and higher energy above the ground state. In many contexts, only the "low-lying" excited states, with energy reasonably close to the ground state, are relevant. This occurs because of the [[Boltzmann distribution]], which implies that very-high-energy [[thermal fluctuations]] are unlikely to occur at any given temperature.

Quasiparticles and collective excitations are a type of low-lying excited state. For example, a crystal at [[absolute zero]] is in the [[ground state]], but if one [[phonon]] is added to the crystal (in other words, if the crystal is made to vibrate slightly at a particular frequency) then the crystal is now in a low-lying excited state. The single phonon is called an ''elementary excitation''. More generally, low-lying excited states may contain any number of elementary excitations (for example, many phonons, along with other quasiparticles and collective excitations).&lt;ref&gt;''Principles of Nanophotonics'' by Motoichi Ohtsu, p205 [https://books.google.com/books?id=3za2u8FnCgUC&amp;pg=PA205 google books link]&lt;/ref&gt;

When the material is characterized as having "several elementary excitations", this statement presupposes that the different excitations can be combined together. In other words, it presupposes that the excitations can coexist simultaneously and independently. This is never ''exactly'' true. For example, a solid with two identical phonons does not have exactly twice the excitation energy of a solid with just one phonon, because the crystal vibration is slightly [[anharmonic]]. However, in many materials, the elementary excitations are very ''close'' to being independent. Therefore, as a ''starting point'', they are treated as free, independent entities, and then corrections are included via interactions between the elementary excitations, such as "phonon-phonon [[scattering]]".

Therefore, using quasiparticles / collective excitations, instead of analyzing 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; particles, one needs to deal with only a handful of somewhat-independent elementary excitations. It is, therefore, a very effective approach to simplify the [[many-body problem]] in quantum mechanics. This approach is not useful for ''all'' systems, however: In [[strongly correlated material]]s, the elementary excitations are so far from being independent that it is not even useful as a starting point to treat them as independent.

===Distinction between quasiparticles and collective excitations===
Usually, an elementary excitation is called a "quasiparticle" if it is a [[fermion]] and a "collective excitation" if it is a [[boson]].&lt;ref name="Kaxiras" /&gt; However, the precise distinction is not universally agreed upon.&lt;ref name="Mattuck" /&gt;

There is a difference in the way that quasiparticles and collective excitations are intuitively envisioned.&lt;ref name=Mattuck/&gt; A quasiparticle is usually thought of as being like a [[dressed particle]]: It is built around a real particle at its "core", but the behavior of the particle is affected by the environment. A standard example is the "electron quasiparticle": A real electron particle, in a crystal, behaves as if it had a [[Effective mass (solid-state physics)|different mass]]. On the other hand, a collective excitation is usually imagined to be a reflection of the aggregate behavior of the system, with no single real particle at its "core". A standard example is the [[phonon]], which characterizes the vibrational motion of every atom in the crystal.

However, these two visualizations leave some ambiguity. For example, a [[magnon]] in a [[ferromagnet]] can be considered in one of two perfectly equivalent ways: (a) as a mobile defect (a misdirected spin) in a perfect alignment of magnetic moments or (b) as a quantum of a collective [[spin wave]] that involves the precession of many spins. In the first case, the magnon is envisioned as a quasiparticle, in the second case, as a collective excitation. However, both (a) and (b) are equivalent and correct descriptions. As this example shows, the intuitive distinction between a quasiparticle and a collective excitation is not particularly important or fundamental.

The problems arising from the collective nature of quasiparticles have also been discussed within the philosophy of science, notably in relation to the identity conditions of quasiparticles and whether they should be considered "real" by the standards of, for example, [[entity realism]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Gelfert, 'Manipulative Success and the Unreal', ''International Studies in the Philosophy of Science'' Vol. 17, 2003, 245–263&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. Falkenburg, ''Particle Metaphysics'' (The Frontiers Collection), Berlin: Springer 2007, esp. pp. 243–46&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect on bulk properties===

By investigating the properties of individual quasiparticles, it is possible to obtain a great deal of information about low-energy systems, including the [[quantum fluid|flow properties]] and [[heat capacity]].

In the heat capacity example, a crystal can store energy by forming [[phonon]]s, and/or forming [[exciton]]s, and/or forming [[plasmon]]s, etc. Each of these is a separate contribution to the overall heat capacity.

===History===

The idea of quasiparticles originated in [[Lev Davidovich Landau|Lev Landau's]] theory of [[Fermi liquid]]s, which was originally invented for studying liquid [[helium-3]]. For these systems a strong similarity exists between the notion of quasiparticle and [[dressed particle]]s in [[quantum field theory]]. The dynamics of Landau's theory is defined by a [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic equation]] of the [[Mean field theory|mean-field type]]. A similar equation, the [[Vlasov equation]], is valid for a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] in the so-called [[plasma approximation]]. In the plasma approximation, charged particles are considered to be moving in the electromagnetic field collectively generated by all other particles, and hard [[collision]]s between the charged particles are neglected. When a kinetic equation of the mean-field type is a valid first-order description of a system, second-order corrections determine the [[entropy]] production, and generally take the form of a [[Boltzmann equation|Boltzmann]]-type collision term, in which figure only "far collisions" between virtual particles. In other words, every type of mean-field kinetic equation, and in fact every [[mean-field theory]], involves a quasiparticle concept.

==Examples of quasiparticles and collective excitations==
This section contains examples of quasiparticles and collective excitations. The first subsection below contains common ones that occur in a wide variety of materials under ordinary conditions; the second subsection contains examples that arise only in special contexts.

===More common examples===
{{see also|List of quasiparticles}}
*In solids, an '''electron quasiparticle''' is an [[electron]] as affected by the other forces and interactions in the solid. The electron quasiparticle has the same [[electric charge|charge]] and [[spin (physics)|spin]] as a "normal" ([[elementary particle]]) electron, and like a normal electron, it is a [[fermion]]. However, its mass can differ substantially from that of a normal electron; see the article [[effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]].&lt;ref name="Kaxiras"&gt;E. Kaxiras, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ULXZwEJeElYC ''Atomic and Electronic Structure of Solids''], {{ISBN|0-521-52339-7}}, pages 65–69.&lt;/ref&gt; Its electric field is also modified, as a result of [[electric field screening]]. In many other respects, especially in metals under ordinary conditions, these so-called Landau quasiparticles{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} closely resemble familiar electrons; as [[Michael F. Crommie|Crommie's]] "[[quantum corral]]" showed, an [[Scanning tunneling microscope|STM]] can clearly image their [[interference (wave propagation)|interference]] upon scattering.
*A '''[[electron hole|hole]]''' is a quasiparticle consisting of the lack of an electron in a state; it is most commonly used in the context of empty states in the [[valence band]] of a [[semiconductor]].&lt;ref name="Kaxiras"/&gt; A hole has the opposite charge of an electron.
*A '''[[phonon]]''' is a collective excitation associated with the vibration of atoms in a rigid [[crystal structure]]. It is a [[quantum]] of a [[sound wave]].
*A '''[[magnon]]''' is a collective excitation&lt;ref name=Kaxiras/&gt; associated with the electrons' spin structure in a crystal lattice. It is a quantum of a [[spin wave]].
*In materials, a '''photon''' quasiparticle is a [[photon]] as affected by its interactions with the material. In particular, the photon quasiparticle has a modified relation between wavelength and energy ([[dispersion relation]]), as described by the material's [[index of refraction]]. It may also be termed a '''[[polariton]]''', especially near a resonance of the material. For example, an '''exciton-polariton''' is a superposition of an exciton and a photon; a '''phonon-polariton''' is a superposition of a phonon and a photon.
*A '''[[plasmon]]''' is a collective excitation, which is the quantum of [[plasma oscillation]]s (wherein all the electrons simultaneously oscillate with respect to all the ions).
*A '''[[polaron]]''' is a quasiparticle which comes about when an electron interacts with the [[polarization density|polarization]] of its surrounding ions.
*An '''[[exciton]]''' is an electron and hole bound together.
*A '''plasmariton''' is a coupled optical phonon and dressed photon consisting of a plasmon and photon.

===More specialized examples===
*A '''[[roton]]''' is a collective excitation associated with the rotation of a fluid (often a [[superfluid]]). It is a quantum of a [[vortex]].
*'''[[Composite fermion]]s''' arise in a two-dimensional system subject to a large magnetic field, most famously those systems that exhibit the [[fractional quantum Hall effect]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ptonline.aip.org/getpdf/servlet/GetPDFServlet?filetype=pdf&amp;id=PHTOAD000053000004000039000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;bypassSSO=1 Physics Today Article]&lt;/ref&gt; These quasiparticles are quite unlike normal particles in two ways. First, their charge can be less than the [[elementary charge|electron charge]] ''e''. In fact, they have been observed with charges of e/3, e/4, e/5, and e/7.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/news/2038/curious-quasiparticles-have-a-quarter-charge-electron Cosmos magazine June 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609005023/http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/news/2038/curious-quasiparticles-have-a-quarter-charge-electron |date=9 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, they can be [[anyon]]s, an exotic type of particle that is neither a [[fermion]] nor [[boson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nphys681 | title = Fractional quantum Hall effect: A game of five halves  | journal = Nature Physics | volume = 3 | issue = 8 | page = 517| bibcode = 2007NatPh...3..517G| last1 = Goldman  | first1 = Vladimir J  | year = 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Stoner excitation]]s''' in ferromagnetic metals
*'''[[Bogoliubov quasiparticle]]s''' in superconductors. [[Superconductivity]] is carried by [[Cooper pairs]]—usually described as pairs of electrons—that move through the crystal lattice without resistance. A broken Cooper pair is called a Bogoliubov quasiparticle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.llnl.gov/str/Labov.html|title=Josephson Junctions|website=Science and Technology Review|publisher=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory}}&lt;/ref&gt; It differs from the conventional quasiparticle in metal because it combines the properties of a negatively charged electron and a positively charged hole (an electron void). Physical objects like impurity atoms, from which quasiparticles scatter in an ordinary metal, only weakly affect the energy of a Cooper pair in a conventional superconductor. In conventional superconductors, interference between Bogoliubov quasiparticles is tough for an STM to see. Because of their complex global electronic structures, however, high-Tc cuprate superconductors are another matter. Thus Davis and his colleagues were able to resolve distinctive patterns of quasiparticle interference in Bi-2212.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=J. E.

*'''[[Magnetic monopole]]s''' arise in condensed matter systems such as [[spin ice]] and carry an effective magnetic charge as well as being endowed with other typical quasiparticle properties such as an effective mass.

'''Raewyn Connell''' (born 3 January 1944) (also known as '''R.W. Connell''', formerly '''Robert''' before her [[Transgender|transition]])  is an Australian [[sociologist]]. She gained prominence as an intellectual of the Australian [[New Left]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams-Brooks, Llewellyn (2016). "Radical Theories of Capitalism in Australia: Towards a Historiography of the Australian New Left", Honours Thesis, University of Sydney, viewed 20 April 2017, https://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/handle/2123/16655&lt;/ref&gt; She is currently{{When|date=December 2017}} Professor Emerita at the [[University of Sydney]] and known for the concept of [[hegemonic masculinity]] and her book, ''Southern Theory''.

==Life and career==
Connell was born Robert William Connell on 3 January 1944 in [[Sydney]], Australia. Her father, William Fraser (Bill) Connell ([[Order of the British Empire|OBE]]), was a Professor of Education at the University of Sydney for many years, where he focused on educational research and teaching. Her mother, Margaret Lloyd Connell (nee Peck) was a high school science teacher. Connell has two sisters, [[Patricia Margaret Selkirk]] and Helen Connell.&lt;ref name="AWAP"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.womenaustralia.info/leaders/biogs/WLE0734b.htm | title=Connell, Raewyn (1944 - ) | publisher=Australian Women's Archives Project 2014 | accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USydney"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sydney.edu.au/arms/archives/history/HonConnell.shtml | title=Honorary awards - Emeritus Professor William Fraser Connell OBE | publisher=University of Sydney | accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cunningham"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cunningham.acer.edu.au/inted/onlinedocs/Connell_WFC_%20in_date_order.pdf | title=William Fraser Connell | publisher=Cunningham Library - Australian Council for Educational Research | accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SLNSW"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://archival.sl.nsw.gov.au/Details/archive/110363071 | title=William Fraser Connell papers, 1891-2010 | publisher=State Library of New South Wales | accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Connell was educated at Manly and North Sydney High Schools, and has degrees from the [[University of Melbourne]] and [[University of Sydney]]. She has held academic positions at universities in Australia, including being the founding professor of sociology at [[Macquarie University]] 1976–1991. 

In the United States Connell was visiting professor of Australian studies at [[Harvard University]] 1991–1992, and professor of sociology at [[University of California Santa Cruz]] 1992–1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raewynconnell.net/p/about-raewyn_20.html "About Raewyn"]. raewynconnell.net. Retrieved on 30 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; She was a rank-and-file member of the [[Australian Labor Party]] (before the party shifted to the right in the early 1980s&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, R. (2005) [http://www.anu.edu.au/polsci/marx/interventions/clan.pdf "History of class analysis in Australia"]&lt;/ref&gt;), and a trade unionist, currently in the [[National Tertiary Education Union]].

Connell's sociology emphasises the historical nature of social reality and the transformative character of social practice.  Her writing tries to combine empirical detail, structural analysis, critique, and relevance to practice.  Much of her empirical work uses biographical (life-history) interviewing, in education, family life and workplaces. She has written or co-written twenty-one books and more than 150 research papers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raewynconnell.net/2011/01/research-publications-complete-list-or.html "Research publications (complete list)."] raewynconnell.net. Retrieved on 30 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Her work is translated into 16 languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raewynconnell.net/2011/08/raewyn-in-translation.html "Raewyn in translation"] raewynconnell.net. Retrieved on 30 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Connell serves on the editorial board or advisory board of numerous academic journals, including ''[[Signs (journal)|Signs]]'', ''[[Sexualities (journal)|Sexualities]]'', ''[[British Journal of Sociology|The British Journal of Sociology]]'', ''[[Theory &amp; Society|Theory and Society]]'', and ''The International Journal of Inclusive Education''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://signsjournal.org/about-signs/masthead/|title=Masthead|date=2012-08-22|work=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|access-date=2017-08-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sydney.edu.au/education_social_work/about/staff/profiles/raewyn.connell.php|title=Professor Raewyn Connell, Academic Staff Profile|last=|first=|date=|website=The University of Sydney|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Connell is a [[trans woman]], who completed her [[gender transition]] late in life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raewynconnell.net/p/about-raewyn_20.html "About Raewyn"] www.raewynconnell.net. Retrieved on 30 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all her earlier work was published under the gender-neutral name "R. W. Connell", up to the second edition of  "Masculinities" in 2005. A few publications are under the names Bob or Robert. Since 2006 all her work has appeared under the name Raewyn Connell. Connell has also written about [[transsexualism]].&lt;ref&gt;Connell, Raewyn. 2012. [http://www.mulabi.org/articulos_para_la_pagina/ts%20women%20and%20fist%20thought.pdf "Transsexual women and feminist thought: toward new understanding and new politics"].

(2010), [http://sexualities.sagepub.com/content/13/1/3.short "Two cans of paint: A transsexual life story, with reflections on gender change and history"], Sexualities, 13(1): 3–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major contributions==
===Class and education===
Connell first became known for research on large-scale class dynamics ("Ruling Class, Ruling Culture", 1977 and "[[Class Structure in Australian History]]", 1980), and the ways class and gender hierarchies are re-made in the everyday life of schools ("Making the Difference", 1982).

===Gender===

In the late 1980s she developed a social theory of gender relations ("Gender and Power", 1987), which emphasised that gender is a large-scale social structure not just a matter of personal identity. In applied fields she has worked on poverty and education ("Schools and Social Justice", 1993), sexuality and AIDS prevention, and labour movement strategy ("Socialism &amp; Labor", 1978).

===Masculinity===
Connell is best known outside Australia for studies of the social construction of [[masculinity]].  She was one of the founders of this research field,&lt;ref&gt;[http://fdp.edsw.usyd.edu.au/users/raewyn "Faculty of Education and Social Work – Professor Raewyn Connell"]. University of Sydney. Retrieved on 2 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and her book "Masculinities" (1995, 2005) is the most-cited in the field.  The concept of [[hegemonic masculinity]] has been particularly influential and has attracted much debate. She has been an advisor to [[UNESCO]] and UNO initiatives relating men, boys and masculinities to gender equality and peacemaking.

===Southern theory===
Connell has developed a sociology of intellectuals that emphasises the collective character of intellectual labour, and the importance of its social context.  Her 2007 book ''Southern Theory'' extended this to the global dynamics of knowledge production, critiquing the "Northern" bias of mainstream social science which is predominately produced in "metropolitan" universities. In doing so, she argues, metropolitan social theory fails to adequately explain social phenomena in the Southern experience.

She analysed examples of theoretical work deriving from the global South: including the work of [[Paulin Hountondji]], [[Ali Shariati]], [[Veena Das]], [[Ashis Nandy]] and [[Raúl Prebisch]]. Connell has also examined Southern theories of [[neoliberalism]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raewynconnell.net/2012/05/research-project-market-society-on.html "Research Project- Market Society on a World Scale"] raewynconnell.net. Retrieved 30 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and gender.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gender.stanford.edu/events/roses-south-re-thinking-gender-analysis-world-perspective "Roses from the South- Re-Thinking Gender Analysis from a World Perspective"] Clayman Institute for Gender Research, Stanford University.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4105">'''Reactive devaluation''' is a [[cognitive bias]] that occurs when a proposal is devalued if it appears to originate from an antagonist. The bias was proposed by [[Lee Ross]] and Constance Stillinger (1988).&lt;ref name=RossStillinger1988/&gt;

Reactive devaluation could be caused by [[loss aversion]] or [[attitude polarization]],&lt;ref name=Ross1995/&gt; or [[naïve realism (psychology)|naïve realism]].&lt;ref name=RossWard1996/&gt;

==Studies==
In an initial experiment, Stillinger and co-authors asked pedestrians in the US whether they would support a drastic bilateral [[nuclear arms]] reduction program. If they were told the proposal came from President [[Ronald Reagan]], 90 percent said it would be favorable or even-handed to the United States; if they were told the proposal came from a group of unspecified policy analysts, 80 percent thought it was favorable or even; but, if respondents were told it came from [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] only 44 percent thought it was favorable or neutral to the United States.&lt;ref name="rs"/&gt;

In another experiment, a contemporaneous controversy at [[Stanford University]] led to the university divesting of [[South Africa]]n assets because of the [[apartheid]] regime. Students at Stanford were asked to evaluate the university's divestment plan ''before'' it was announced publicly and ''after'' such. Proposals including the actual eventual proposal were valued more highly when they were hypothetical.&lt;ref name="rs"/&gt;

In another study, experimenters showed [[Israel]]i participants a peace proposal which had been actually proposed by Israel. If participants were told the proposal came from a Palestinian source they rated it lower than if they were told (correctly) the identical proposal came from the Israeli government. If participants identified as "hawkish" were told it came from "dovish" Israeli government they believed it was relatively bad for their people and good for the other side, but not if participants identified as "doves".&lt;ref name="Maoz2002"/&gt;

'''Ritual servitude(trokosi system)
''' is a practice in [[Ghana]], [[Togo]], and [[Benin]] where traditional religious shrines (popularly called [[fetish shrines]] in Ghana) take human beings, usually young virgin girls, in payment for services, or in religious atonement for alleged misdeeds of a family member. In Ghana and in Togo it is practiced by the [[Ewe people|Ewe tribe]] in the Volta region; in Benin it is practiced by the [[Fon people|Fon]].&lt;ref&gt;FAQ About the Form of Slavery Called Trokosi, ECM Publications, 2002, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

These shrine slaves serve the priests, elders, and owners of a traditional religious shrine without remuneration and without their consent, although the consent of the family or clan may be involved.  Those who practice ritual servitude usually feel that the girl is serving the god or gods of the shrine and is married to the gods of the shrine.&lt;ref&gt;''Field Findings on the System of Slavery Commonly Known as Trokosi'', L W Rouster, M.R.E., ECMAfrica Publications, 2005, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

If a girl runs away or dies, she must be replaced by another girl from the family. Some girls in ritual servitude are the third or fourth girl in their family suffering for the same crime, sometimes for something as minor as the loss of trivial property.

It is still practiced in the Volta region in Ghana, in spite of being outlawed in 1998, and despite carrying a minimum three-year prison sentence for conviction. Among the Ewes who practice the ritual in Ghana, variations of the practice are also called ''trokosi'', ''fiashidi'', and ''woryokwe'', with "trokosi" being the most common of those terms.&lt;ref&gt;"The Revealed Myths about Trokosi Slavery/Human Rights Violations" by Stephen Awudi Gadri, Authorhouse, UK, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In Togo and Benin it is called ''voodoosi'' or ''vudusi''.&lt;ref&gt;"Field Findings on the System of Slavery Commonly Known as Trokosi", L W Rouster, M.R.E., ECMAfrica Publications, 2005, p.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Victims are commonly known in Ghana as fetish slaves because the gods of African Traditional Religion are popularly referred to as fetishes and the priests who serve them as fetish priests.

==Other names==
''Trokosi'': the general name by which it is called in Ghana by both proponents and opponents of the practice

''Ritual'' or ''customary servitude'': designations by which it is called in Ghana law forbidding the practice

''Fiashidi'': another name used by some districts in Ghana

''Woryokwe'': another name used by some districts in Ghana

''Vudusi'' (also voodoosi, voudousi, vaudounsi, voudounsi, etc.): the general name by which it is called in French-speaking countries such as Togo and Benin

''Shrine slavery'': a designation often used by NGOs to describe the practice&lt;ref&gt;Rouster, ''Wives of the gods--An Analysis of West African Ritual Servitude'', L W Rouster, M.R.E., ECMAfrica Publications, 2008, PO Box 810, Hebron, IN 46341,'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fetish slavery'': a popular designation used in Ghana, where "fetish" refers to the deity of the shrine

''Hierodulic slavery'': a designation used by anti-slavery groups meaning sacred or religious slavery&lt;ref&gt;"Hierodulic Slavery" www.anti-slaverysociety.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of the terms "servitude", "slave" and "slavery"==
Human rights organizations and other NGO's commonly use the words "servitude", "slaves", and "slavery" as non-technical, popularly understood terms that describe the reality of this practice.  They point out that the practice meets all the commonly accepted definitions of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;''Rouster, Wives of the gods'', p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
Shrine slaves perform services which are not voluntary and are not paid.  Their lives are totally controlled by the shrines, who in a sense become their owners.

Proponents of the system  of ritual servitude by any of its names object to this term, but except for the technical terms "trokosi", "vudusi", "fiashidi", "woryokoe", the problem is coming up with a suitable alternative.  Sometimes they have compared the trokosi to traditional queen mothers, implying a sense of respect for them, but one representative of an NGO who claims to have interviewed hundreds of participants reports that the participants themselves are offended at being called queens and insist they are/were simply slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Rouster, ''Wives of the gods'' p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Juliana Dogbadzi, who served 17 years as a trokosi, says she was "slave to a fetish priest".&lt;ref&gt;Juliana Dogbadzi, PARADE magazine, "One Voice," September 24, 2000, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Cudjoe Adzumah made a study of the practice in the Tongu Districts of Ghana and defined "trokosi" as "slaves of the gods".&lt;ref&gt;Cudjoe Adzumah, "The Trokosi Practice in N Tongu: Its Impact on the Rights of Women and Children, BA Thesis, Sociology Department, University of Ghana, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Emmanuel Kwaku Akeampong, a native Ghanaian of Harvard University, says that "tro" means a "god" and "kosi" is used at different times to mean either "slave", "virgin", or "wife".&lt;ref&gt;Emmanuel Kwaku Akeampong, ''Between the Sea and the Lagoon, an Eco-Social History of the Anlo of Southeastern Ghana c. 1850 to Recent Times,'' Ohio University Press, Athens, OH, James Currey, Oxford, 2001, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; Anita Ababio, a Ghanaian lawyer who has extensively researched the issue, explains that the Adangbe and Ga word, "woryokwe" comes from "won" meaning cult, and "yokwe", meaning "slave".  Thus, she claims, a "woryokwe" is a "slave of a cult".&lt;ref&gt;Anita Mamusina Heymann Ababio, "Trokosi, Woryokwe, Cultural and Individual Rights: A Case Study of Women's Empowerment and Community Rights in Ghana, St. Mary's University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, August 22, 2000, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Kwame Amen in ''Ghana Studies'' also refers to trokosi as an institution of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;
Robert Kwame Amen, ''Trokosi (Child Slavery) in Ghana, a Policy Approach'', Ghana Studies I, 1998, p. 35-62.&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, Stephen Awudi Gadri, President of the Trokosi Abolition Fellowship of Ghana, and also himself from a shrine family, claims that trokosi are "slaves of the deities of the shrines".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Awudi Gadri, ''History of the Trokosi System in Ghana'', Vol. 1, Paper presented to the First National Congress on the Trokosi System, June 29, 2000, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;   "Though euphemistically, they are called the 'deity's wives', yet they serve the priests and elders of the shrine and do all the hard chores, as well as becoming sexual partners of the priest," Gadri says.&lt;ref&gt;Gadri, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also says, "the trokosi works for the priest without any form of remuneration whatsoever", and "it is a form of slavery".&lt;ref&gt;Gadri, p. 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt;
Ababio claims, "The servile status of the trokosi is seen in the duties they perform in the shrines, for which no payment is made...unfortunately for most trokosi, when they are freed they are still bound by rituals which keep them connected or attached to a shrine for life. Practically it means that these victims of ritual servitude always have the rights of ownership exercised over them."&lt;ref&gt;Ababio, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; She then goes on to quote Article 7 of ''The Convention on Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery'', which defines a slave as "a person over whom any or all powers attaching to the rights of ownership are exercised".  Angela Dwamena-Aboagye, a Ghanaian lawyer, says ritual servitude is "slavery, pure and simple.  It violates every human right."&lt;ref&gt;Ababio, quoting ''The Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery'', 1956, ECOSOC, Res. 608, XXI, 1956.  This convention has been ratified and acceded to by Ghana.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the traditional priests also admit the trokosi are slaves.  For example, Togbe Adzimashi Adukpo, a shrine priest, admitted in an interview with BBC in February 2001, "Yes, the girls are my slaves.  They are the property of my shrine."&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey Hawaley, "Ghana's Trapped Slaves", BBC News, February 8, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the question of whether trokosi is a form of slavery and whether sexual abuse is involved the answers are polarized into two camps.  Some traditionalists defend the system saying that it is simply a cultural practice of certain shrines and as such should be protected.  These defenders claim that while instances of sexual abuse may occur, there is no evidence that sexual or physical abuse is an ingrained or systematic part of the practice.  According to them, the practice explicitly forbids a Trokosi to engage in sexual activity or contact.  The other camp is represented by NGOs working with the trokosi and by former trokosi who have been liberated.  These opponents of the practice have recorded testimony of hundreds of former (now liberated) trokosi who say that sexual abuse was a regular part of their time at the shrine, claiming the number of children born to them by the priest and shrine elders is a witness.&lt;ref&gt;Rouster, Field Findings, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although virtually everyone recognizes that the victims themselves have no choice or say in their lot, Stephen Awudi Gadri says that "both the parents (of the victims) and the girls (that is, the victims) have no choice".&lt;ref&gt;The Revealed Myths about Trokosi Slavery", p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious connections==
Simon Abaxe has researched the practice in Ghana.  He says that ritual servitude is part of African Traditional Religion in some places, but not a universal practice of that religion.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Abaxer, "Trokosi Situation on the Ground in Volta Region", ECMAfrica Publications, 2007, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;  A form of it is also practiced in India and Nepal as part of Hindu religion, and various forms of it were part of ancient religious traditions of devotion to various gods and goddesses.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}  It is distinguished from the Christian monastic tradition at a basic level since ritual servitude is involuntary on the part of the participant, in contrast to Christian monasticism, which is voluntary.&lt;ref&gt;Rouster, ''Field Findings'' p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons==
There are two major reasons for the practice of ritual servitude.  Most common is the concept of atonement.  A girl is given to the shrine or to the gods as a kind of "living sacrifice" to atone for the real or alleged crimes of a family member or ancestor, as discerned by the priest of the shrine.  During a process of divination he calls on the gods of the shrine to reveal this information.  Girls given to atone for such crimes in a sense are considered a kind of savior, for as long as she remains in the shrine or under its control, the anger of the god is believed to be averted from the rest of the family.&lt;ref name="Rouster, Field Findings p. 5"&gt;Rouster, ''Field Findings'' p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second most frequent reason for the practice of ritual servitude is that the girl is given for the continuous repayment of the gods for services believed to have been obtained or favors believed to have been rendered from the shrine.  Thus a girl may be given into ritual servitude when someone believes a child has been conceived or a person has been healed, for example, through the intervention of the shrine.&lt;ref name="Rouster, Field Findings p. 5"/&gt;

Proponents of the practice claim that some participants choose a life of ritual servitude of their own volition, but human rights organizations claim that while this may be theoretically possible, they haven't found one yet.&lt;ref&gt;Rouster, ''Field Findings'' p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, the traditions of the shrines were veiled in secrecy, and people dared not discuss them, fearing the wrath of the gods if they dared to do so.  For this reason, the practice was neither widely known nor well understood.  In more recent times, since the 1990s at least, abolitionists and human rights advocates have penetrated the veil of secrecy.  The issue has been widely discussed, for instance, in the newspapers and on the radio in Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;Every Child Ministries, ''The Three Pillars of Trokosi'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and history==

===In the Dahomey Empire===
The giving of virgin girls to the gods was part of many ancient religions.  In West Africa, the practice has gone on for at least several hundred years.  Similar practices using similar terminology were found in the royal court of the Kingdom of Dahomey (in what is now Benin) in the 18th and 19th centuries.  Wives, slaves, and in fact all persons connected with the royal palace of Dahomey were called "ahosi", from "aho" meaning "king", and "si" meaning "dependent" or "subordinate."&lt;ref&gt;Wives of the Leopard-- Gender, Politics &amp; Culture in the Kingdom of Dahomey, Edna G. Bay, University of Virginia Press, 1998, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;   By one estimate there were 5,000 to 7,000 ahosi living in the palace at Abomey,&lt;ref&gt;Warrior Women, The Amazons of Dahomey &amp; the Nature of War", Robert B. Edgerton, University of California at Los Angeles, Westview Press, 2000, p. 15 &amp; 52.&lt;/ref&gt; and no men lived there except for a few hundred eunuchs were charged with controlling the women.  After sunset no men at all were allowed in the palace except the king, and he was guarded by women guards called Amazons.  The king controlled every aspect of the lives and even the deaths of the ahosi.  Visitors to old Abomey today are shown a mass grave and told that the king's wives "volunteered," on his death, to be buried alive with him in order to accompany him and serve him in the world to come.  One researcher pointed out, "Of course, one should not make the mistake of ascribing modern democratic meaning to the word "volunteered" as if the wives wanted to die or had any choice in the matter.&lt;ref&gt;"Lorella Rouster, Report on Visit to the Ancient Kingdom of Dahomey, May 2006, ECM Publications, p.2.&lt;/ref&gt; Ahosi who became too powerful or too independently minded were simply sacrificed (literally and physically) in the annual office ceremony lasting several days in which the power of the king was renewed by hundreds of human sacrifices, usually performed by public beheadings.&lt;ref&gt;Edgerton, Warrior Women, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice was documented by [[A. B. Ellis]] who was an eyewitness of the practice in the Dahomey Empire (now Benin) in 1879. According to Ellis, one god called "Khebioso" had 1500 wives in Dahomey alone, the women being called "kosio".  He said they cared for the shrines of the gods, but their main business was religious prostitution.  According to Ellis, most of the gods of the Ewe-speaking people at that time had such women who were similarly consecrated to their service and were commonly considered "wives" of the gods.&lt;ref&gt;A. B. Ellis, Major, First Battalion West India Regiment, ''The Ewe-Speaking Peoples of the Slave Coast of West Africa'', Bahamas, 1890, republished by Benin Press, Chicago, 1965, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

One might argue that those ahosi were wives of the king and lived in the palace, not wives of the gods living in the shrines.  But that distinction is not as clearcut as it might first seem, for the palace was the center of Dahomean religious life, and the place where sacrifices were made and rituals to the ancestors were performed.  Over time, then, it was an easy jump from being ahosi living lives totally controlled by the king in the palace where sacrifices were offered and rituals were performed, to being trokosi living lives totally controlled by a priest in a shrine where sacrifices were offered and rituals were performed.  It was a very easy transition indeed.  Even in the time of the Kingdom of Dahomey, one reads of the vodun or gods successfully demanding that someone become a devotee or vodunsi (wife or follower of the god).&lt;ref&gt;Wives of the Leopard, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Ghana===
As people migrated within West Africa, the practice spread.  Sandra Greene has noted that in Ghana, the practice dates to at least the late 18th century.  At the time the Amlade clan Sui became very powerful, and began to demand female slaves from those who sought its services.  The practice called "replacement" also began in Ghana at that time.  Under this practice, if a shrine slave died or ran away, the family was required to replace her with another girl.&lt;ref&gt;Sandra E. Greene, Gender, Ethnicity and Social Change on the Upper Slave Coast: A History of the Anlo-Ewe, Portsmouth, 1996, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of the 19th century, Nyigbla became the chief Anlo deity, and its shrines also began to demand slaves for its services.  Involuntary slavery, however, was not at that time and in that place common, since Nyigbla also instituted a practice called foasi, whereby two servants were recruited annually on a more-or-less voluntary basis.  At that time, the slaves were often married to members of powerful priestly families.&lt;ref&gt;Akeampong,p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of opposition to the practice==

===In colonial times===
It is reported by traditionalists that since the mid-18th century the Bremen missionaries decried the practice and purchased freedom for individual trokosi, which were then called "new made slaves", converting them to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mypage.bluewin.ch/yehwehpyramid/trokosi.html Pyramid of Yahweh, about trokosi, p. 4]&lt;/ref&gt;

When Ghana (then [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]]) was under colonial rule, a few citizens complained about the practice, but the colonial masters turned their heads.  They derided him{{who|date=July 2012}} as "the blind man who wants to help others see".  The colonial government did investigate the practice at Atigo shrine near Battor from 1919 to 1924.  The investigating District Commissioner, W. Price Jones, called it "a pernicious habit of handing girls over to the fetish", but for economic reasons, decided not to interfere.  As a result of that inquiry, shrine slaves held at the Atigo shrine were told they could return home if they wished.&lt;ref&gt;National Archives of Ghana, Accra, ADM 11/1/768 Acting District Commissioner of Ada, W. Price Jones to Commissioner for the Eastern Province (CEP), 10 March 1920.&lt;/ref&gt;  Soon after, the colonial government ignored another complaint that the shrine was still keeping trokosi.&lt;ref&gt;National Archives of Ghana, CEP, to Secretary of Native Affairs, Koforidua, 10 September 1924.&lt;/ref&gt; After that, the practice slid back into secrecy and was not brought to the public consciousness again until 1980.

===In the 1980s===
The practice was drawn into the national spotlight at that time when [[Mark Wisdom]], a Baptist pastor, responded to what he claims was a vision from God, and challenged the system in the national media. Wisdom claimed that as he prayed, he saw a vision of women in bonds, crying out for help.  Wisdom claimed to have later discovered these same women on one of his evangelistic missions, held in bondage in a shrine just across the Volta River from his home, but previously unknown to him.  He began publicly denouncing the practice, so much so that headlines in Ghana screamed that he was not afraid of the shrine priests.  Wisdom wrote a book on the subject, founded FESLIM (Fetish Slaves Liberation Movement), and was instrumental in some of the earliest liberations, but it was his bold public statements reported in the news that pricked the national consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Mark Wisdom granted to the VR staff of Every Child Ministries, June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the 1990s===
In the early 1990s, Ghanaian journalist Vincent Azumah found courage to write publicly about the practice and sparked a nationwide debate.  Then the International Federation of Women Laywyers in Ghana (FIDA) organized an investigation into shrine practices and issued a report in 1992.  These events took place while [[Jerry Rawlings]] still held the presidency of Ghana with an iron fist.  Rawlings and his administration were defenders of African Traditional Religion, calling it the "African Heritage" and a cause for national pride.  One example of this was his granting of free air time to the founder of the Afrikania movement, Okomfo Damuah, at a time when Christian churches were virtually denied access to both radio and TV.  Azumah and FIDA's actions were very bold in the light of the political climate of the day.&lt;ref name="Ababio, p. 21"&gt;Ababio, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ghana National Commission on Children brought attention to the issue during the celebration of the Organization of African Unity Day of the African Child on June 16, 1993. In 1994 and 1995 Ghanaian lawyer Anita Heymann Ababio researched the practice in the light of Ghanaian law, and recommendations from this research later became a Law Reform Commission report to the Ghana government in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Heymann, Ababio A., ''The Impact of the Constitutional Provisions on the Customary Disabilities of Women in Ghana'', Report on the Abolition of Ritual Slavery, Forced Labour and Other Related Practices, Institute of Advanced Legal Studies, University of London, April 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Emmanuel Kweku Akeampong, a Ghanaian professor of history at Harvard University, the practice of trokosi was much in the national attention in 1996 and 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Akeampong, p. 221-226.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outlawed in Ghana 1998===
In 1998 the Law Reform Commission, drawing on the recommendations of Ababio and others, drafted a law specifying "ritual or customary servitude" as a crime.  The law passed, requiring a mandatory three-year prison term for those found guilty.&lt;ref name="Ababio, p. 21"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The Criminal Code of Ghana, Act. 1998 Act. 554.&lt;/ref&gt;

===International award 1999===
In 1999 Juliana Dogbadzi, a former trokosi, won the Reebok Human Rights Award for her efforts in speaking up on behalf of her fellow trokosi.&lt;ref&gt;James Aidoo, "Ghana, Liberating the Trokosi" p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===NGOs oppose the practice===
Although the practice was outlawed in Ghana in 1998, it continued, due to fear and the reluctance of the government to interfere with traditional practices.  Some NGOs had already worked to liberate shrines, but after the law did not solve the problem, NGOs began to get even more seriously involved in advocating against the practice and in working for agreements to reduce the practice by liberating individual shrines.
Some of the organizations that have joined the effort are UNICEF, International Needs Network Ghana, the Swiss "Sentry Movement", Trokosi Abolition Fellowship, the Anti-Slavery Society, and Every Child Ministries.  Survivors for Change is a group of former trokosi who have banded together to speak up against the practice.  Organizations that have been most active in liberating ritual slaves are FESLIM (Fetish Slaves Liberation Movement), founded by Mark Wisdom, International Needs, and Every Child Ministries.  Christian NGOs and human rights organizations have been fighting it—working to end the practice and to win liberation for the shrine slaves.  They have carried out their activities with strong support from CHRAJ—The Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice—and the Ministry of Women's and Children's Affairs.  A Court of Women was organized in Accra in 2003 to continue the fight against the practice.

==Meaning of "Trokosi" and "Vudusi"==
The word '''''trokosi''''' comes from the [[Ewe language|Ewe]] words "tro", meaning deity or fetish, and "kosi", meaning female slave.&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary of Trokosi Terms, www.trokosi.com&lt;/ref&gt; The "tro" deity is not, according to African traditional religion, the Creator or what might be called the "High" or Ultimate God.  "Tro" refers to what African Traditional Religion calls the "small gods" or "lesser deities"—spirits of nature, etc. which are venerated in traditional religion.  The term '''''trokosi''''' is commonly used in English in Ghana, as a [[loanword]].

===Categories of ''Tro'' adherents===

#Those who join the ''Tro'' of their own volition (extremely rare) and those who were born to women associated with the ''Tro'' and initiated as children (''Trovivo'');
#Those thought to have been born through the intervention of the ''Tro'' (''Dorflevivo'') and thus incur a lifetime obligation of servitude to the tro;
#Those allegedly called by the tro to serve as priest and priestesses of the shrine (''Tronua'');
#Those who were forced to become ''Trokosi'' to repay the ''Tro'' because their family supposedly benefited from it.
#Those ''Trokosi'' who are sent by families, often against the will of the girl involved, out of fear that if they do not do so, further calamities may afflict them through the anger of the shrine deities. This last group consists of those vestal virgins who are sent into servitude at the shrines of the ''Troxovi'' due to crimes allegedly committed by their senior or elder family members, almost always males like fathers, grandfathers, and uncles.  The trokosi is sort of a "living sacrifice," who by her suffering is thought to save the family from trouble.

Opponents of the practice claim that all except those who joined of their own volition are virtually slaves in every normal sense of the word.

NGO's point out that practices in traditional shrines vary, but trokosi are usually denied education, suffer a life of hardship, and are a lonely lot, stigmatized by society.&lt;ref&gt;Rouster, Field Findings, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

The period of servitude varies from a few months to life.  In some cases it involves payment of a heavy fine to the shrine, which can require many years of hard labor or even a lifetime of service to pay.  In shrines where the period of servitude is limited, after a ritual and sometimes after months or years in the shrine, the Trokosi returns to her family, but her life is still controlled by the shrine for the rest of her life. Supporters of the practice claim that in the vast majority of cases, there is no particular stigma attached to one's status as a former Trokosi shrine participant. NGOs working to rehabilitate former trokosi say that the social stigma is immense and that it is the most enduring and difficult aspect of the practice.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Lorella Rouster, International Director of Every Child Ministries, June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main variations in the practice==
Ritual slavery shows a high degree of cohesiveness, but there are many significant differences as it is practiced in various shrines and in various areas.  Every Child Ministries, a Christian NGO that has done much research on the topic, lists these as variations that they have observed in their work:&lt;ref name="Interview with Rouster, ECM, 2006"&gt;Interview with Rouster, ECM, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Entry age of the participants===
Most frequently those in ritual servitude are young virgin girls at the time of entry into the shrine.  Of course, the girls grow up, so where their servitude is long or lifetime, the participants are of all ages.

===Length of service===
There are two basic lengths of service—perpetual or lifetime service and limited service.  One traditional priest expressed the view that once a crime had been committed, it had to be atoned for until the end of time.  This is the view of lifetime or perpetual service.  Shrine slaves serving for a lifetime have no hope of ever getting free unless outsiders intervene on their behalf.  In some shrines, in some areas, and for some alleged crimes, the service is limited to a specific number of years.  In other cases, a substantial fee is exacted from the shrine slave or her family.  The girls work to try to earn that fee, but in reality the fee is so high and their means of paying it so low that there is virtually no hope of ever paying off the debt that has been laid on them.
Some shrines have taken so many slaves that they cannot contain them all.  Some slaves become unattractive or unuseful to the priest.  In these cases trokosia may be given what is called "temporary" release.  This is actually a misnomer, since it is a permanent condition.  The temporary part only gives the slave permission to live outside the shrine temporarily.  All the important decisions of her life are still controlled by the shrine, she is still at the beck and call of the priest, and she has to serve at the annual festival of the god every year, for which she is required to bring gifts that may take her all year to accumulate.
One child of a trokosi on "temporary release" said, "whenever my mother goes fishing or does any work, she must divide it into three, with two parts going to the priest."&lt;ref&gt;"Revealed Myths about Trokosi Slavery", p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

===Practice of replacement===
Where perpetual or lifetime servitude is practiced, the shrines often, but not always, practice what they call "replacement."  when a trokosi or vudusi dies or runs away, she has to be replaced by another virgin from the same family or clan.  Some human rights interviewers report that they have interviewed numerous girls who were the third or fourth replacements for their families for a crime that was allegedly committed long ago.&lt;ref name="Interview with Rouster, ECM, 2006"/&gt;

===Practice of rape by the priest and elders of the shrine===
In most shrines it is considered a duty of the shrine slaves to have obligatory sex with the priest and sometimes the elders.  The priest's genital organs have been dedicated to the gods of the shrine, so having sex with him is considered a sacred act - in a sense, copulating with the gods.  This is the origin and meaning of the term "wives of the gods."  Many trokosi and vudusi have described beatings and other severe punishments imposed on them for refusing sex with the priest.  In Ghana, human rights organizations monitoring the practice of "trokosi" claim that shrine slaves often end up with an average of four children while in servitude, many of them by the priest or elders of the shrines.  Proponents of ritual servitude deny that this is a part of the practice.  There seem to be wide differences between practices in different districts, but Rouster claims that the problem of forced sex in many of the shrines is too well documented to be disputed.&lt;ref name="Interview with Rouster, ECM, 2006"/&gt;
Stephen Awudi Gadri, founder of Trokosi Abolition Fellowship, speaks of "ritual violation after menarche" (first menses) as the beginning of a life of coerced sex.&lt;ref&gt;"The Revealed Myths about Trokosi Slavery", p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; He refers to the trokosi as "vestal virgins." &lt;ref&gt;Revealed Myths about Trokosi Slavery, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatment of shrine slaves===
Treatment of girls in the shrine varies as to feeding practices, reasons for and severity of punishments, sleeping and living conditions.  Severe and widespread problems have been documented in all these areas by human rights organizations.  Many of the shrine slaves are required to do heavy physical labor like cultivating fields with a hand hoe.  Other common duties are weaving mats, making and selling firewood (with all profits going to the priest or the shrine), fetching wood and water, sweeping the compound and attending the images of the gods.

==Liberation of shrine slaves==
[[NGO]]'s and other [[human rights]] organizations are fighting the practice.  Since the 1990s, these groups have actively sought to liberate girls held in ritual servitude.  Liberation has been done on a shrine-by-shrine basis, with NGO's seeking to reach community-wide agreements that all the slaves of a particular shrine will be liberated and the practice of slavery or ritual servitude will be permanently ended in that place.  When such an agreement is reached, a public ceremony is held for the signing of the documents and often, liberation certificates for the former slaves.  The shrine is compensated for its loss and the former trokosi begin a process of rehabilitation which usually includes learning vocational skills.

The most active groups in liberating shrine slaves through negotiated community agreements have been FESLIM, Fetish Slaves Liberation Movement, International Needs Network, and Every Child Ministries.

The first liberation ceremonies were held at Lomo and Me shrines in Volo in October 1996, at three shrines in Dorfor in December 1996, and at Atigo shrine in Battor in January 1997.[54] International Needs Network liberated 400 trokosi from a group of small shrines in November 2000, and 126 at Adidome in November 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Nirit Ben-Ari, "Liberating Girls from Trokosi" from Africa Recovery, Vol 15, #4, Dec. 2001, p. 26.
&lt;/ref&gt; Every Child Ministries cooperated with International Needs Network to liberate 465 trokosi from three shrines of the Agave area in January 2003 and with Fetish Slaves Liberation Movement to liberate 94 shrine slaves from Aklidokpo shrine near Adidome in January 2004.  They continued the effort, liberating 120 from Sovigbenor shrine in Aflao in December 2005, and 52 "yevesi" or servants of the thunder god from the Kadza Yevesi Shrine at Aflao in March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;"African Jewels",a 2nd Quarter 2010, Every Child Ministries&lt;/ref&gt; Shrines of the Anlo clan in Ghana also hold trokosi, but have resisted liberation and defended the practice, defending their practice of trokosi as being more humane than the practices of other districts. Human rights organizations insist that the practice must be totally eradicated.

'''Sexual tension''' is a social phenomenon that occurs when two individuals interact and one or both feel [[sexual desire]], but the [[consummation]] is postponed or never happens. A common scenario is where the two individuals function in close proximity, such as co-workers or in a group of friends, but do not have sex to avoid awkwardness or for other reasons. Sexual tension doesn't have anything to do with the actual act of sex but is everything that leads up to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Palmquist|2012|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual tension can also occur when two individuals have previously had [[human sexual activity|sexual relations]] and still feel an attraction towards each other, but do not wish to have sex again for fear of its effect on their current social situation (such as maintaining a relationship with a different partner). It can also be felt in situations when two individuals have a relationship devoid of physical contact, as in a long-distance relationship.

Sexual tension often occurs between individuals when the relationship is close and often flirtatious, yet the two people involved adamantly deny their feelings for each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://expertdaconquista.com/aprenda-criar-tensao-sexual/|title=Aprenda A Criar Tensão Sexual - Expert da Conquista|date=2016-03-18|language=pt-BR|access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, it can appear extremely obvious to other friends or co-workers that such tension is present between the two individuals. When people give in to sexual tension, the relationship can become complicated and awkward if no new relationship level is established, as the relationship that existed before is no longer valid.

== In fiction ==
Sexual tension is a common feature in works of [[fiction]]. This longing is often suggested by incidents of [[intimacy]]; for example, when two characters are alone and in close proximity (or actually touching), yet desire is never explicitly expressed. Another common theme is for characters to develop an interest in each other over the course of the story, and if this is expertly done, the audience can become aware of the growing attraction.

Sexual tension intensifies the audience's involvement with all characters involved. However, as several television series have discovered to their sorrow, tension dissipates when characters come together in sexual harmony. It is not like violence, which establishes the villain's credibility and makes the next round of jeopardy even more powerful. Instead, sexual fulfillment has the same effect on sexual tension that the death of the victim has on jeopardy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Card|2010|pp=93–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social peer-to-peer processes''' are interactions with a [[peer-to-peer]] dynamic. These peers can be humans or computers. Peer-to-peer (P2P) is a term that originated from the popular concept of the P2P distributed computer application architecture which partitions tasks or workloads between peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What does Peer-to-Peer Architecture (P2P Architecture) mean?|url=https://www.techopedia.com/definition/454/peer-to-peer-architecture-p2p-architecture|publisher=Techopedia Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=September 2018}} This application structure was popularized by [[file sharing]] systems like [[Napster]], the first of its kind in the late 1990s.

The concept has inspired new structures and philosophies in many areas of human interaction. P2P human dynamic affords a critical look at current [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] and [[centralization|centralized]] social structures. Peer-to-peer is also a political and social program for those who believe that in many cases, peer-to-peer modes are a preferable option.

== Definition ==
P2P is a specific form of relational dynamic, based on the assumed [[equipotent|equipotency]] of its participants, organized through the free cooperation of equals in view of the performance of a common task, for the creation of a common good, with forms of decision making and autonomy that are widely distributed throughout the network.

There are several fundamental aspects of social P2P processes:
* [[peer production]] - the collaborative production of use value is open to participation and use to the widest possible number (as defined by [[Yochai Benkler]], in his essay Coase's Penguin);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.yale.edu/yalelj/112/BenklerWEB.pdf | title = Coase's Penguin, or, Linux and The Nature of the Firm | first = Yochai | last = Benkler | publisher = The Yale Law Journal | format = PDF | date =  | accessdate = 2010-04-15 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101010152105/http://www.yale.edu/yalelj/112/BenklerWEB.pdf | archivedate = 2010-10-10 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* peer governance - production or project is governed by the community of producers themselves, not by market allocation or corporate hierarchy;
* peer property - the use-value of property is freely accessible on a universal basis; peer services and products are distributed through new modes of property, which are not exclusive, though recognize individual authorship (i.e. the [[GNU General Public License]] or the [[Creative Commons]] licenses).

Peer production does not produce commodities for exchange value, and does not use the [[price mechanism]] or [[corporate]] [[hierarchy]] to determine the allocation of resources. It must therefore be distinguished from both the [[capitalist]] [[Market (economics)|market]] (though it can be linked and embedded in the broader market) and from production through state and corporate planning; as a mode of [[governance]] it differs from traditional [[linear]] hierarchies; and as a mode of property it differs from both traditional private property and state-based collective [[public property]]; it is rather the common property of its producers and users and the whole of humankind. Unlike [[private property]], peer property is inclusive rather than exclusive — its nature is to share ownership as widely, rather than as narrowly, as possible.

== Characteristics ==
P2P processes are not structureless, but are characterized by dynamic and changing structures which adapt themselves to phase changes. Its rules are not derived from an external authority, as in hierarchical systems, but are generated from within. It does not deny ‘authority’, but only fixed forced hierarchy, and therefore accepts authority based on expertise, initiation of the project, etc. P2P may be the first true [[meritocracy]]{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}. P2P eliminates most, if not all, barriers to entry. The threshold for participation is kept as low as possible. Equipotency means that there is no prior formal filtering for participation, but rather that it is the immediate practice of cooperation which determines the expertise and level of participation. Communication is not top-down and based on strictly defined reporting rules, but feedback is systemic, integrated in the protocol of the cooperative system. Techniques of 'participation capture' and other social accounting make automatic cooperation the default scheme of the project. Personal identity becomes partly generated by the contribution to the common project. P2P characterists have been studied by [[Howard Rheingold]] ''et al.'''s Cooperation Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rheingold.com/cooperation/CooperationProject_3_30_05.pdf |title=The Cooperation Project: Objectives, Accomplishments, Proposals |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

P2P is a network, not a linear or 'pyramidal' hierarchy (though it may have elements of it); it is 'distributed', though it may have elements of [[centralization]] and 'decentralisation'; intelligence is not located at any center, but everywhere within the system. Assumed equipotency means that P2P systems start from the premise that ‘it doesn’t know where the needed resource will be located’, it assumes that ‘everybody’ can cooperate, and does not use formal rules in advance to determine its participating members. Participants are expected to self-select the module that corresponds best to their expertise. Equipotency, i.e. the capacity to cooperate, is verified in the process of cooperation itself. [[Data validation|Validation]] of knowledge, acceptance of processes, are determined by the collective through the use of digital rules which are embedded in the project's basic protocol. Cooperation must be free, not forced, and not based on neutrality (i.e. the buying of cooperation in a monetary system). It exists to produce something. It enables the widest possible participation. These are a number of characteristics that we can use to describe P2P systems ‘in general’, and in particular as it emerges in the human lifeworld. Whereas participants in hierarchical systems are subject to the panoptism of the select few who control the vast majority, in P2P systems, participants have access to holoptism, the ability for any participant to see the whole.

== Infrastructure ==
The first requirement to facilitate the emergence of peer-to-peer processes is the existence of a technological infrastructure that enables distributed access to fixed capital. Individual computers that enable a universal machine capable of executing any logical task are a form of distributed fixed capital, available at low cost to many producers. The internet, as a point to point network, was specifically designed for participation by the edges (computer users) without the use of obligatory hubs. Although it is not fully in the hands of its participants, the internet is controlled through distributed governance, and outside the complete hegemony of particular private or state actors. The Internet's hierarchical elements, such as the stacked [[IP protocol]]s and [[Domain Name System]], do not deter participation. Viral communicators, or meshworks, are a logical extension of the internet. With this methodology, devices create their own networks through the use of excess capacity, bypassing the need for a pre-existing infrastructure. [[Wireless community network]]s, Open Spectrum advocacy, file-serving television, and alternative meshwork-based telecommunication infrastructures are exemplary of this trend.&lt;ref name="Ctheory"&gt;{{cite news  |url=http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=499
  |title=The Political Economy of Peer Production
  |date=2005-01-12
  |author=
  |publisher=CTheory
  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second requirement is alternative information and communication systems which allow for [[autonomous]] communication between cooperating agents. The web (in particular the Writeable Web and the [[Web 2.0]] that is in the process of being established) allows for the universal autonomous production, dissemination, and 'consumption' of written material while the associated [[podcasting]] and [[webcasting]] developments create an 'alternative information and communication infrastructure' for audio and audiovisual creation. The existence of such an infrastructure enables autonomous content production that may be distributed without the intermediary of the classic publishing and broadcasting media (though new forms of mediation may arise).&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt;

The third requirement is the existence of a 'software' infrastructure for autonomous global cooperation. A growing number of collaborative tools, such as blogs and wikis, embedded in [[social networking]] software facilitate the creation of trust and [[social capital]], making it possible to create global groups that can create [[use-value]] without the intermediary of manufacturing or distribution by for-profit [[Business|enterprises]].&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt;

The fourth requirement is a legal infrastructure that enables the creation of use-value and protects it from private [[appropriation (economics)|appropriation]]. The [[General Public License]] (which prohibits the appropriation of software code), the related [[Open Source Initiative]], and certain versions of the [[Creative Commons]] license fulfill this role. They enable the protection of common use-value and use viral characteristics to spread. [[GPL]] and related material can only be used in projects that in turn put their adapted source code in the [[public domain]].&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt;

The fifth requirement is cultural. The diffusion of mass intellectuality, (i.e. the distribution of human intelligence) and associated changes in ways of feeling and being ([[ontology]]), ways of knowing ([[epistemology]]) and value constellations ([[axiology]]) have been instrumental in creating the type of cooperative individualism needed to sustain an [[ethos]] which can enable P2P projects.&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt;

== In the economy ==

=== Capitalism ===
There are two important aspects to the emergence of P2P in the economic sphere. On the one hand, as format for peer production processes, it is emerging as a 'third mode of production' based on the cooperation of autonomous agents. Indeed, if the first mode of production was [[laissez-faire]] based [[capitalism]], and the second mode was the model of a [[Central planning|centrally-planned]] economy, then the third mode is defined neither by the motor of profit, nor by central planning: to allocate resources and make decisions, it does not use market and pricing mechanisms, or managerial commands, but instead uses [[social relations]]. Peer production is a significant part of the [[mainstream]] economy, even if it is not much advertised as such in mainstream economic literature.&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt;

Despite significant differences, P2P and the capitalist market are highly interconnected. P2P is dependent on the market and the market is dependent on P2P. Peer production produces [[use-value]] through mostly [[Intellectual capital|immaterial]] production, without directly providing an income for its producers. Participants cannot live from peer production, though they derive meaning and value from it.&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt;

The market and capitalism are also dependent on P2P. Capitalism has become a system relying on distributed networks, in particular on the P2P infrastructure in computing and communication. Productivity is highly reliant on cooperative [[teamwork]], most often organized in ways that are derivative of peer production's governance. The support given by major IT companies to [[open-source software development|open-source development]] is a testimony to the use derived from even the new common property regimes. The general [[business model]] seems to be that businesses use the P2P [[infrastructure]], and create a surplus value through services, which can be packaged for [[exchange value]]. For-profit enterprises mostly use partial implementations of P2P. [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] built itself around user reviews,{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} [[eBay]] lives on a platform of worldwide distributed auctions, and [[Google]] is constituted by [[user-generated]] content. Value creation today is no longer confined to the enterprise, but beholden to the mass intellectuality of [[knowledge worker]]s, who through their lifelong learning/experiencing and systemic connectivity, constantly innovate within and without the enterprise.&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt; Yet more recently, in the last decade, peer-to-peer exchanges have become even more prevalent in the so-called "[[sharing economy]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The rise of the sharing economy|url=https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21573104-internet-everything-hire-rise-sharing-economy|publisher=The Economist|accessdate=5 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; also termed an "access economy" or a "peer exchange economy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Popularity of Peer-to-Peer Exchanges in the Last Decade|url=http://www.gearpeers.com/blog/the-popularity-of-peer-to-peer-exchanges-in-the-last-decade/|publisher=Gear Peers|accessdate=5 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, businesses such as [[Uber]], [[Lyft]], and [[Airbnb]] are all based on peer-to-peer physical exchanges. This sharing economy is projected by some analysts to encompass $335 billion by 2025.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Car Sharing Economy|url=http://www.drivemycar.com.au/Long-term-rental-in-the-car-sharing-economy|publisher=DriveMyCar|accessdate=5 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zhuo|first1=TX|title=Airbnb and Uber Are Just the Beginning. What's Next for the Sharing Economy.|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/244192|publisher=Entrepreneur|accessdate=5 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peer-to-peer systems contribute to more specific forms of distributed capitalism. The massive use of [[open source software]] in business, enthusiastically supported by [[venture capital]] and large IT companies such as [[IBM]], is creating a distributed software platform that will drastically undercut the [[monopolistic]] rents enjoyed by companies such as [[Microsoft]] and [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], while [[Skype]] and [[VoIP]] will drastically redistribute the [[Telecommunications service provider|telecom]] infrastructure. In addition, it also points to a new business model that is 'beyond' products, focusing instead on services associated with the nominally free FS/OS software model. Industries are gradually transforming themselves to incorporate user-generated innovation, and a new intermediation may occur around user-generated media. Many knowledge workers are choosing non-corporate paths and becoming mini-entrepreneurs, relying on an increasingly sophisticated participatory infrastructure, a kind of digital corporate commons.&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt;

=== Market economy ===
Social P2P systems are different from [[market economy]]:&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt; neither market pricing nor managerial command are required for P2P processes to make decisions regarding the allocation of [[resources]]. There are further differences:

* Market economy is similar to insect-like [[swarm intelligence]]. There are autonomous agents in a distributed environment, but each individual only sees his own immediate benefit.&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt;
* Markets are based on 'neutral' cooperation, and not on [[synergistic]] cooperation: no [[Norm of reciprocity|reciprocity]] is created.&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt;
* Markets operate on the production and exchange of value to generate [[Profit (economics)|profit]], not [[production for use]].
* Whereas P2P aims at full participation, markets only fulfill the needs of those with [[purchasing power]].

Markets do not function well for common needs that do not involve direct payment&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt; ([[national security|national defense]], general policing, [[education]] and [[public health]]). In addition, they fail to take into account [[negative externalities]]&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt; (the environment, social costs, future generations).

=== P2P economic system ===
In ''The Political Economy of Peer Production'' Bauwens regards P2P phenomena as an emerging alternative to capitalist society. P2P economy may be seen as extending or already existing outside the sphere of free/open source software production and other non-rival immaterial goods. Peer production effectively enables the free cooperation of producers, who have access to their own means of [[Production (economics)|production]], and the resulting use-value of the projects supersedes for-profit alternatives.&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt;

Historically, though forces of higher [[productivity]] may be temporarily embedded in the old productive system, they ultimately lead to deep upheavals and reconstitutions of the [[political economy]]. The emergence of capitalist modes within the [[feudal system]] is a case in point. This is particularly significant because leading sectors of the for-profit economy are deliberately slowing down productive growth (through patents and [[Monopoly|monopolization]]) and trying to outlaw P2P production and sharing practices.&lt;ref name="Ctheory"/&gt;

== In politics ==

=== Governance ===
[[Government]]s of countries are composed of a specialized and privileged body of individuals, who [[monopolize]] political decision-making. Their function is to enforce existing laws, [[legislate]] new ones, and arbitrate conflicts via their monopoly on violence. Legislation can be open to the general [[citizenry]] through [[open source governance]], allowing policy development to benefit from the collected wisdom of the people as a whole.

[[Michel Bauwens]] has stated, that society is not a peer group with an [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]] [[consensus]], but rather a [[decentralized]] structure of competing groups and [[representative democracy]] cannot be replaced entirely by peer governance.&lt;ref name="Re-public"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peer projects which evolve beyond a certain scale and start facing issues of decisions about scarce [[resources]], will probably adapt some representational mechanisms. Representative and [[bureaucratic]] [[decision-making]] can and will in some places be replaced by global governance networks which may be self-governed to a large extent, but in any case, it will and should incorporate more and more [[Multistakeholder Model]]s (i.e. [[collaborative e-democracy]]), which strives to include all groups that could be affected. This group-based partnership model is different, but related in spirit, to the individual-based peer governance, because they share an [[ethos]] of participation.&lt;ref name="Re-public"/&gt;

=== Open source movements ===
Many new movements are taking on P2P organizational formats, such as the [[alter-globalization]] movement and the [["Occupy" protests|"Occupy"]] movement (i.e. [[Occupy Wall Street]]). The movements see itself as a network of networks that combines players from a wide variety of fields and opinion, who, despite the fact that they do not see eye to eye in all things, manage to unite around a common [[Computing platform|platform]] of action around certain key events.

They are able to mobilize vast numbers of people from every [[continent]], without having at their disposal any of the traditional [[news media]], such as television, radio or newspapers. Rather, they rely almost exclusively on the P2P technologies described above. Thus, Internet media are used for communication and learning on a continuous basis, prior to the mobilizations, and also during the mobilizations.

Independent Internet media platforms such as [[Indymedia]], as well as the skillful use of mobile phones, are used for real-time response management, undertaken by small groups that use buddy-list technologies, and sometimes open source programs that have been explicitly designed for political activism such as TextMob.

Many reports have appeared, including those described in Howard Rheingold's [[Smart Mob]]s, about the political significance of [[SMS]] in organizing successful protests and ‘democratic revolutions’. The network model allows for a more fluid organization that does not fix any group in a permanent adversarial position. Various temporary coalitions are created on an [[ad hoc]] basis depending on the issues.

People who report such experiences are known as sonochromats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ar.neuro.fchampalimaud.org/speaker/neil-harbisson "Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323224518/http://ar.neuro.fchampalimaud.org/speaker/neil-harbisson |date=2014-03-23 }}, ''[[Champalimaud Foundation]] Magazine'', 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by Neil Harbisson to differentiate his experience of colour from people with chromesthesia or colour-to-sound synesthesia.&lt;ref&gt;Acheson, Clare. [http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/clare-acheson/technological-body-modification_b_2772212.html "Technological Body Modification: In Pursuit of Singularity"], ''[[Huffington Post]]'', 27 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Difference between chromesthesia and sonochromatism==

The main difference between [[chromesthesia]] and sonochromatism is that sonochromatism is not the union between two existing senses, instead, it is the creation of a new sense.&lt;ref&gt;Editor, [http://www.firstpost.com/topic/place/barcelona-the-sonochromatism-of-neil-harbisson-the-cyborg-artist-b-a-video-8c4kKySDUBk-1142-35.html "The Sonochromatism of Neil Harbisson"], [[First Post (India)]], 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Sonochromats do not necessarily sense colour as a visual experience and are able to perceive colours outside the limits of human vision such as infrareds and ultraviolets. Their experience of colour is not involuntary, instead, it is caused by voluntary action such as a colour-to-sound chip implant or constant use of an [[eyeborg]]. The sounds perceived for each colour are not subjective, they are objective and they are related to the light frequencies of colour.&lt;ref&gt;Cáceres, Marta. [http://www.rtve.es/mediateca/videos/20091021/repor---yo-robot/609619.shtml?s1=programas&amp;s2=informativos&amp;s3=repor&amp;s4= "Yo Robot"], Report ''[[Televisión Española]]'', 21 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Harbisson's Sonochromatic Scales==

Implantable colour-to-sound chips, software, mobile apps and [[cyborg antenna]]s use Harbisson's Sonochromatic Scales as a standard transposition of colour frequencies to sound frequencies.

The '''Sonochromatic Music Scale''' is a microtonal and [[logarithm]]ic scale with 360 notes in an octave. Each note corresponds to a specific degree of the [[color wheel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/27743/june-2008-table-of-contents/] ''Modern Painters, The International Contemporary Art Magazine'' pp 70–73 ([[New York City]], June 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Harbisson's '''Pure Sonochromatic Scale''' is a non-logarithmic scale based on the [[:wikt:transpose|transposition]] of light frequencies to sound frequencies. The scale includes infrareds and ultraviolets, discards colour as being part of a colour wheel and ignores musical/logarithmic perception so it can overstep the limits of human perception.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/27743/june-2008-table-of-contents/] ''Modern Painters, The International Contemporary Art Magazine'' pp 70–73 ([[New York City]], June 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Structured criticality''' is a property of [[complex systems]] in which small events may trigger larger events due to subtle interdependencies between elements. This often gives rise to a form of stratified [[chaos theory|chaos]] where the general behavior of the system can be modeled on one scale while smaller- and larger-scale behaviors remain unpredictable.

'''For example:'''

Consider a pile of sand. If you drop one grain of sand on top of this pile every second, the pile will continue to grow in the shape of a cone. The general shape, size, and growth of this cone is fairly easy to model as a function of the rate at which new sand grains are added, the size and shape of the grains, and the number of grains in the pile.

The pile retains its shape because occasionally a new grain of sand will trigger an avalanche which causes some number of grains to slide down the side of the cone into new positions. 

These avalanches are chaotic. It is nearly impossible to predict if the next grain of sand will cause an avalanche, where that avalanche will occur on the pile, how many grains of sand will be involved in the event, and so on. 

However, the aggregate behavior of avalanches can be modeled statistically with some accuracy. For example, you can reasonably predict the frequency of avalanche events of different sizes.

The avalanches are caused when the impact of a new grain of sand is sufficient to dislodge some group of sand grains. If that group is dislodged then its motion may be sufficient to cause a [[cascading failure|cascade failure]] in some neighboring groups, while other groups that are nearby may be strong enough to absorb the energy of the event without being disturbed.

Each group of sand grains can be thought of as a sub-system with its own state, and each sub-system can be made up of other sub-systems, and so on. In this way you can imagine the sand pile as a complex system made up of sub-systems ultimately made up of individual grains of sand (yet another sub-system). Each of these sub-systems are more or less likely to suffer a cascade failure. Those that are likely to fail and reorganize can be said to be in a '''critical''' state.

Put another way, the likelihood that any particular sub-system will fail (or experience a particular event) can be called its '''criticality'''. (See: [[Self-organized criticality]])

So then, the pile of sand can be viewed as a network of interconnected systems, each with its own criticality. The relationships between these groups impose a structure on this network which has a profound effect on the probability and scope of a cascade failure in response to some other event. In other words - '''structured criticality'''.

Structured criticality is found just about everywhere. Some other examples are:

* Landslides.
* Lightning strikes.
* Earthquakes.
* The knots that appear on a twisted rubber band in a model airplane as the propeller is wound up.
* Rouge Waves

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5523">'''Toni Dove''' is a [[New York City|New York]]-based artist working primarily in electronic and interactive media.  

==Career==
Dove is considered one of the pioneers of [[interactive cinema]]&lt;ref name=zkm/&gt; and has shown work at [[ZKM]], the [[Banff Centre]] for the Arts, the Brooklyn  Anchorage, and the [[Whitney Museum]] of American Art.  She has been affiliated with [[Creative Time]] and [[Harvestworks]], and a DVD version of scenes from her pieces has been distributed by [[Cycling '74]]. She is the granddaughter of American abstract painter [[Arthur Dove]].

Dove has been working with interactive narrative since 1990.&lt;ref name=cg/&gt; Her work blends cinematic tropes typical of [[Studio system|studio-age]] [[film noir]] with contemporary narrative trends in [[science fiction]], [[cybernetics]], and [[new media]], often offering a feminist take on popular genres.&lt;ref name=century/&gt; Dove refers to her work as "cyber-theatre" because it relies on virtual performers (avatars) rather than human actors and because she gives her audience partial control over the performance through the use of interactive technologies.&lt;ref name=century/&gt;&lt;ref name=carver/&gt; In these hybrids of [[film]], [[installation art]], and [[experimental theater]], the participants interact with an unfolding narrative movie, often using minimally invasive [[user interface|interface]] technologies such as [[speech recognition]] and [[computer vision]] to control or 'perform' their on-screen [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]]s.&lt;ref name=bennet/&gt;

Dove's 1994 piece entitled ''Casual Workers, Hallucinations and Appropriate Ghosts'' has been interpreted as belonging to the larger domain of radio because of its "aural evocation of high-tech street erotics".&lt;ref name=weiss/&gt;

In 2001 Toni Dove received funding from the [[Daniel Langlois Foundation]] to produce ''Spectropia: A Ghost Story on the Infinite Deferral of Desire'', the second part in a "trilogy of narrative, interactive installations begun in 1998".&lt;ref name=trilogy/&gt; The first installment, ''Artificial Changelings'', dealt with "the emergence of compulsive consumerism in the 19th century" through a plotline centered on a heist. For this piece, Dove used floor mats as the basis for viewer interaction with the piece: moving around shifted the visitor's point of view among three options (first, second, and third person). Gestures made by visitors further affected how the piece was experienced.&lt;ref name=vv/&gt; In the second installment, Dove continued her inquiry "into the subconscious at work in the capitalist society of the early 20th century".&lt;ref name=century/&gt;

In [[astrobiology]], the '''Uniformity of Motive''' theory suggests that any civilization in the [[universe]] would go through similar technological steps in their development. This theory supports the idea that at some point in their history, advanced alien civilizations would use the [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] medium for communications, and thus would emit radio waves that could be detected by projects such as [[SETI]].

The fact that no artificial EM band communications have ever been detected supports the [[Fermi Principle]], which in conjunction with the Uniformity of Motive theory, and [[Occam's razor]] suggests that a civilization that uses this medium is a unique occurrence in Earth's region of the Milky Way Galaxy and perhaps the universe.

'''Vithal Mahadeo Tarkunde''' (3 July 1909 in [[Saswad]] – 22 March 2004 in [[Delhi]]), was a prominent Indian lawyer, civil rights activist, and humanist leader and has been referred to as the "Father of the Civil Liberties movement" in India and a former judge of the Bombay High Court&lt;ref name="Outlook"&gt;[http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?223371 Outlook MAR 24, 2004 TRIBUTE – Father Of Civil Liberties In India]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;PUCL Bulletin Special Issue Justice Tarkunde: Vol. XXVII, No. 3 {{ISSN|0970-8693}} MARCH 2007 ("''This is a special number of the PUCL Bulletin dedicated to the memory of V M Tarkunde, the doyen of the Civil Liberties Movement in India''")&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court of India also praised him as "undoubtedly the most distinguished judge of the post-[[M. C. Chagla|Chagla]] 1957 period" in the [[Bombay High Court]].&lt;ref name="court"&gt;Full Court Reference in memory of Late Shri V M Tarkunde,Senior Advocate, on Wednesday, 7 April 2004 in the Supreme Court of India Address by Soli J Sorabjee Attorney General for India&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==

Vithal Mahadeo Tarkunde was born in [[Saswad]], [[Pune District]], Maharashtra on 3 July 1909. He was the 2nd of the five children of Mahadeo Rajaram Tarkunde, a popular lawyer and social reformer at [[Saswad]],then headquarters of [[Purandar taluka]] adjoining Pune. His father, a [[Brahmin]] by caste, had fought against the practice of [[untouchability]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;A Restless Crusader for Human Rights – M A Rane, PUCL Bulletin Special Issue Justice Tarkunde: Vol. XXVII, No. 3 {{ISSN|0970-8693}} MARCH 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920 he migrated from Saswad to Pune and joined the New English School, Pune. In the Matriculation examination of 1925 held by the [[Bombay University]], he stood first in the erstwhile [[Bombay Presidency]]. He also secured the prestigious Jagannath Shankersheth Scholarship for Sanskrit. He then joined the [[Fergusson College]] for BA which he completed in 1929, subsequently moving to London, where he attended the Lincoln's Inn and qualified as a [[Barrister-at-Law]] in 1931. He also attended lectures in economics, political science and social anthropology at the [[London School of Economics]](LSE) as an external student. He returned to India the next year in December and commenced his legal practice in Pune.&lt;ref name="court"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Author Overview – Voice of A Great Sentinel: Selected Writings of V.M. Tarkunde – 1 January 2004 , 1st ed. – Renaissance Publishers Pvt. Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="inmemoriam"&gt;[http://www.pucl.org/Topics/PUCL/2004/tarkunde-condolence4.htm  In Memoriam, Justice V.M. Tarkunde (1909–2004)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal career==

Tarkunde started practice at Pune soon after he returned to India in 1933. He continued there till 1942 when he gave up his practice to become a full-time member of the [[Radical Democratic Party (India)|Radical Democratic Party]]. He resumed his legal practice in the [[Bombay High Court]] in 1948 after [[Independence of India|Independence]] and was elevated to the bench as a Judge of the [[Bombay High Court]] in September 1957. He stepped down voluntarily as Judge of the Bombay High Court in 1969 and set up practice in the [[Supreme Court of India]] where he continued till his resignation in 1977 at the age of 68. He was chiefly concerned with [[Public Interest Litigation]]s and constitutional cases, most of which he conducted with little or no fees.&lt;ref name="inmemoriam"/&gt;

==Activism==
In 1933, he joined the [[Congress Socialist Party]](CSP) and the [[Indian National Congress]] but later left the CSP disillusioned with their vote against [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] in the January 1939 Tripuri session of Congress. He then joined the League of Radical Congressmen led by his mentor [[M. N. Roy]] in April 1939.&lt;ref&gt;"Why I left the Congress", Through Humanist Eyes Vithal Mahadev Tarkunde.1st ed. New Delhi, Ajanta Publications,1997&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, Roy and Tarkunde, along with several others, left the Congress after dissenting on the question of participation in the [[Second World War]]. Roy advocated participation in the war against the [[Axis powers]], while simultaneously striving for Indian independence, and founded the [[Radical Democratic Party (India)|Radical Democratic Party]] to further this cause.In 1942, Tarkunde gave up his legal practice to become a full-time member of the [[Radical Democratic Party (India)|Radical Democratic Party]] and was elected General Secretary of the RDP in 1944, thereby migrating to Delhi. By 1946 Roy formulated the philosophy of New Humanism. By 1948 he and Roy decided that political parties were an inadequate instrument for promoting freedom of the people and so dissolved the RDP in December 1948. He returned to legal practice the same year.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

==Radical Humanism==

In 1969, Tarkunde founded the Indian Radical Humanist Association as an organisation for radical humanists. He also began editing the ''Radical Humanist'' (founded in 1937 by Roy as ''Independent India'') in April 1970, supporting it initially with his own income. In 1973 he was one of the signers of the [[Humanist Manifesto II|Humanist Manifesto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_II | title=Humanist Manifesto II | publisher=American Humanist Association | accessdate=24 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emergency==

During the [[Indian Emergency|emergency]], he worked closely with [[Jayaprakash Narayan]], providing leadership to the NGOs Citizens for Democracy and [[People's Union for Civil Liberties]], of which he was the founding president. He also worked on the [[Citizen's Justice Committee]] and played a principal part in resisting and investigating the excesses of the period, including the [[1984 Anti-Sikh riots]],&lt;ref&gt;Judge V.M. Tarkunde, et al., Oppression in Punjab: Report to the Nation, New Delhi: Citizens for Democracy, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; and human rights violations in the Punjab, Kashmir, and the North-East.&lt;ref name="Outlook"/&gt; His refusal to consider kashmiri pandits who had fled valley in 1990 as human right victims caused much controversy and led to his dubbing as " Terrorists' defender in chief" as he regularly attacked Indian army for fake encounters and extra judicial killings.In 1995, he departed from his earlier stand of considering firing by police as human rights violation and defended UP government in Muzaffarnagar police firing and rape on Uttarakhand state demand activists on 2 October 1994 in Supreme Court.His volte face was noted by honourable bench with humour and he won the case with court ruling that there was not adequate evidence of wilful human rights violation by State government.But it led to his breaking ranks with radical humanists.

Tarkunde was a board member for the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]]([[IHEU]]), the world union of Humanist organisations for over 40 years.&lt;ref name="iheu"&gt;[http://www.iheu.org/glossary/term/372?Array IHEU Glossary VM Tarkunde]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honours==

At the 1978 London Congress of the [[IHEU]], VM Tarkunde received the International Humanist Award 1978.&lt;ref name="iheu"/&gt; The Government of India awarded him the civilian honour of the [[Padma Bhushan]] in 1998.&lt;ref name="Padma Awards"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/LST-PDAWD-2013.pdf | title=Padma Awards | publisher=Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India | date=2015 | accessdate=July 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2934">'''"Visiting Friends and Relatives"''' (VFR tourism / VFR travel) is a substantial form of travel worldwide.  Scholarly interest into VFR travel developed in the mid 1990s after Jackson’s (1990) &lt;ref&gt;Jackson, R. (1990). VFR Tourism: Is It Underestimated? ''The Journal of Tourism Studies'', 1(2), 10-17.&lt;/ref&gt; seminal article suggested that this type of tourism was much larger than official estimates suggested.&lt;ref&gt;Backer, E. (2009). "Opportunities for Commercial accommodation in VFR travel." ''International Journal of Travel Research''&lt;/ref&gt;  Most official data collections differentiate travel as being for either leisure, business, or VFR purposes.  In many destinations, VFR is the largest or second-largest form of travel by size.  Definitions have been traditionally lacking due to the complexities involved in understanding VFR travel. VFR travellers can state a VFR purpose of visit but that does not necessarily mean that they are staying with those friends / relatives.  Similarly, they may be accommodated by friends / relatives although have a different purpose of visit.&lt;ref&gt;Backer, E. (2009). "Opportunities for Commercial accommodation in VFR travel." ''International Journal of Travel Research''&lt;/ref&gt; 

One definition put forward has been "VFR travel is a form of travel involving a visit whereby either (or both) the purpose of the trip or the type of accommodation involves visiting friends and / or relatives" &lt;ref&gt;Backer, E. (2007). "VFR Travel - an examination of the expenditures of VFR travellers and their hosts." ''Current Issues in Tourism'', 10 (4), p.369&lt;/ref&gt;  This has subsequently been developed into a VFR definitional model to describe it visually.&lt;ref&gt;Backer, E. (2009). "Opportunities for Commercial accommodation in VFR travel." ''International Journal of Travel Research''.&lt;/ref&gt;

VFR expenditures tend to be quite broad; spread widely throughout the community rather than confined to the narrow tourism sector (McKercher, 1995).&lt;ref&gt;McKercher, B. (1995). An examination of host involvement in VFR travel. ''Proceedings from the National Tourism and Hospitality Conference 1995''. Council for Australian University Tourism and Hospitality Education, 246-255.&lt;/ref&gt; In some expenditure categories, VFR travellers have been shown to outspend non-VFR travellers (Seaton &amp; Palmer, 1997;&lt;ref&gt;Seaton, A. &amp; Palmer, C. (1997). Understanding VFR Tourism behaviour: the first five years of the United Kingdom tourism survey. ''Tourism Management'', 18(6), 345-355.&lt;/ref&gt; Morrison, Verginis et al., 2000) &lt;ref&gt;Morrison, A., Verginis, C., &amp; O’Leary, J. (2000).

[[File:Wish list.jpg|thumb|A child's Christmas wish list from 1990]]
A '''wish list''' or '''want list''' is an itemization of goods or services that a person or organization desires. The author may distribute copies of their list to family, friends, and other [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s who are likely to purchase gifts for the would-be recipient, or to offer some of the listed items for sale. The goal of a wish list is to facilitate communication between the gift receiver and the gift giver. Wish lists often contain items that a gift purchaser can obtain from a variety of retailers.  Some wish lists are specialized for particular purposes or concentrated at individual retailers, such as [[gift registry|gift registries]] (e.g., [[bridal registry|bridal registries]]).

==Occasions==
In some cultures, people often exchange wish lists before major holidays that include gift giving, such as [[Christmas]] and [[birthday]]s. Other common occasions for issuing wish lists include [[baby shower]]s, [[housewarming party|housewarming]]s, [[wedding]]s, and [[drive (charity)|charity drives]].

== Types ==

* A [[gift registry]] is a type of wish list that contains only items that can be purchased at the store which manages the registry.
* An online wish list is a type of wish list that is hosted on the Internet. Online wish lists can be associated with a retailer or universal. 
* A product wish list is similar to a list of functional [[requirement]]s. The difference is mainly the importance of the requested functionality. Items that might be on the wish list at one time may be expected to be requirements later.
* A software user wishlist is a type of wish list that is created by the software manufacturer (such as the software development company or the website owner) or by user groups.
* A "bucket list" is a type of personal wish list consisting of things a person wishes to do before they die (e.g., "[[kick the bucket]]") or before they reach a life stage milestone (e.g., the end of childhood; the end of high school, etc.)

==Online==
An online wish list typically allows a registered user to create a wish list, add wishes to it and then spread a link to the wish list via email or social media like [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]]. Visitors to the published wish list can in most cases comment wishes and reserve them. This adds a collaborative perspective among the viewers that would be much harder to achieve for analog wish lists. Online wish lists on retailer websites allow you to save items you prefer from that retailer's site for future reference. Universal online wish lists allow you to add items from multiple retailers and even non-retail ideas &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Online Wish List Best Practices |url=https://www.dreamlist.com/best/ |website=DreamList.com |accessdate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Software users==
Software user wish lists are a compilation of user suggestions for requested features. Many enterprise websites and software packages offer users the option to add a "wish" - a suggestion for improvement or change - and to vote on the importance of suggestions supplied by the publisher or author of the website or software, and they attempt to give a quick response to the suggestions.  For example, [[Microsoft Visual Studio]] has a "community" menu, and [[Facebook]] has a "suggestions" section.

In many cases, when a company fails to supply such a framework, users create their own lists, in [[Internet forum]]s or in [[blog]]s. When such a list becomes popular, the company must respond to the common requests.

Having software user wish lists has become popular since 2007 when a football gaming community FIFPlay started collecting fans wishlist for [[Electronic Arts]] for pre-development of [[FIFA (video game series)]] and it has collected over 10,000 ideas and suggestions for [[FIFA 08]].

'''Working memory training''' is intended to improve a person's [[working memory]]. Working memory is a central intellectual faculty, linked to [[IQ]], [[ageing]], and mental health. It has been claimed that working memory training programs are effective means, not only for [[Treatment of ADHD through working memory training|treating attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder]] ([[ADHD]]) and other cognitive disorders, but to improve intelligence and to enhance cognitive functioning in typically developing children and healthy adults. 23 studies with 30 group comparisons, show that clinical memory training programs produce reliable short-term improvements in working memory skills in children and adults with ADHD. Yet, the study results differ with regard to conclusive evidence that such effects can be maintained long-term without additional follow-up training. There is also no convincing evidence of the effect of working memory training to other skills such as nonverbal and verbal ability, inhibitory processes in attention, word decoding, and arithmetic. While most studies show clinical relevance of working memory training programs for ADHD population, they cast doubt that these program should be considered as methods of enhancing cognitive functioning in children and adults without working memory deficiencies.&lt;ref name=Melby-Lervag(2012)&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Melby-Lervåg M, Hulme C |title=Is Working Memory Training Effective? A Meta-Analytic Review |journal=Dev Psychol |volume= 49|issue= 2|pages= 270–91|date=May 2012 |pmid=22612437 |doi=10.1037/a0028228 |url=|citeseerx=10.1.1.281.7759 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Working memory==
{{Main|Working memory}}

Working memory (WM) is the system which holds multiple pieces of transitory information in the mind – information that is needed for different tasks right now. WM is usually assessed by determining the number of pieces of information a person can hold in mind. For example, a person might be asked to listen to a series of digits and letters, sort them into order in mind, and then recall the sorted list aloud. The longest set of characters that can reliably be manipulated and recalled is the working memory capacity.

The capacity of working memory differs between people: a person able to recall 8 instructions has a greater working memory capacity than someone who can only recall a series of five. Numerous scientific studies have linked working memory capacity with strength in other fundamental cognitive abilities, including attention and intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Barkley RA |title=Behavioral inhibition, sustained attention, and executive functions: constructing a unifying theory of ADHD |journal=Psychol Bull |volume=121 |issue=1 |pages=65–94 |date=January 1997 |pmid=9000892 |doi= 10.1037/0033-2909.121.1.65|url=http://www.calstatela.edu/faculty/meisen/ADHD.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Conway AR, Kane MJ, Engle RW |title=Working memory capacity and its relation to general intelligence |journal=Trends Cogn.

Conversely, poor working memory is assumed to be one of the core deficits in [[ADHD]] as well as a number of learning disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Castellanos FX, Tannock R |title=Neuroscience of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: the search for endophenotypes |journal=Nat.

If the individual does poorer on one trial, the difficulty will decrease. Similarly, if the individual excels on the next few trials, the difficulty will increase. Two ways of altering the difficulty are adjusting the number of stimuli to be remembered and adding visual distractions.&lt;ref name= "KFW"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Klingberg, T., Forssberg, H., &amp; Westerberg, H.|title=Training of Working Memory in Children with ADHD|journal=Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology|year=2002|volume=24|issue=6|pages=781–791|doi=10.1076/jcen.24.6.781.8395|pmid=12424652|citeseerx=10.1.1.326.5165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategies==
Common strategies used in working memory training include repetition of the tasks, giving feedback such as tips to improve one's performance to both the parents and the individual, positive reinforcement from those conducting the study as well as parents through praise and rewarding,&lt;ref name="Beck et al" /&gt; and the gradual adjustment of the task difficulty from trial to trial. More explicitly used strategies by the individual include [[rehearsal]] of material, [[Chunking (psychology)|chunking]], pairing mental images with the material, [[mnemonic]]s, and other meta-cognitive strategies. The latter strategies have been learned and there is a conscious awareness of their use.

==Training setup and evaluation==
Before training commences participants complete pre-training verbal and visuo-spatial tasks, which are additionally completed in the study's follow-up as post-training tasks. Pre-training and post-training tasks vary, some studies use verbal and visuo-spatial tasks along with slightly different tasks; referred to as "nontrained tasks." Klingberg et al.&lt;ref name="KFW" /&gt; used visuo-spatial tasks, a Span board, the [[Stroop task]], Raven's coloured progressive matrices, and a choice reaction time task, during pre-training and post-training. Holmes et al.&lt;ref name="Holmes et al" /&gt; used a [[nonword]] recall task, mazes memory task, listening [[Recall (memory)|recall]], and the "odd one-out" task. By using tasks that differ from ones in the study, laboratory results can demonstrate transfer effects if high scores are achieved, since these were not learned during training.

The training itself is set up in studies so that participants attend a set number of sessions over a given period of time that widely varies between studies. This can vary anywhere from two weeks to a span of eight weeks. The time spent in sessions also ranges, with some studies being as short as fifteen minutes to other studies lasting forty minutes. Studies can take place in the lab, or even at home with researchers keeping in touch through weekly phone calls.&lt;ref name="Beck et al" /&gt; There is no universal way to set up the training schedule, since all schedules tended to vary to at least to some degree. The effects are tested immediately after training is completed and again a few months after, or even up to a year later, to see if the training outcomes are still in place. Testing and evaluation can be based on the measures of academic efficiency, ratings of the individual's symptoms from teachers and parents, comparing the experimental to the [[control groups]] of the study, and self-report measures.

==Transfer effects==
There are many possible transfer effects from working memory training. An increase in working memory capacity could make individuals more likely to take on tasks that have a higher working memory load, such as math and other challenging academics.&lt;ref name="Sam 11"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Klingberg, T., Fernell, E., Olesen, P. J., Johnson, M., Gustafsson, P., Dahlstrom, K., Gillberg, C. G., Forssberg, H., &amp; Westerberg, H.|title=Computerized training of working memory in children with ADHD- a randomized, controlled trial|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry|year=2005|volume=44|issue=2|pages=177–186|pmid=15689731|doi=10.1097/00004583-200502000-00010|citeseerx=10.1.1.397.4817}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holmes et al.&lt;ref name=HGD&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Holmes, J., Gathercole, S. E., &amp; Dunning, D. L.|title=Adaptive training leads to sustained enhancement of poor working memory in children|journal=Developmental Science|volume=12|issue=4|pages=F9–F15|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7687.2009.00848.x|pmid=19635074|date=July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported an improvement in mathematical reasoning, even six months after training was completed. Furthermore, there has been parent reported decreases of inattentive behaviours, hyperactivity, and impulsivity in children with ADHD,&lt;ref name="Sam 11" /&gt; in addition to a decrease in motor activity.&lt;ref name="KFW" /&gt; However the majority of transfer effects are seen in lab-based nontrained tasks that are completed during follow-up and immediately after training is over. Findings from these results vary according to which nontrained tasks the researcher chooses to use. The main general finding in these studies confirms that experimental groups improve on trained tasks in comparison to control groups, and that effects will need retraining to maintain.&lt;ref name="Sam 11" /&gt;

==History==
The concept of working memory became widely accepted and its importance better understood across the 1970s. At this time, a number of attempts to improve working memory were also initiated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Butterfield EC, Wambold C |title=On the theory and practice of improving short-term memory |journal=Am J Ment Defic |volume=77 |issue=5 |pages=654–9 |date=March 1973 |pmid=4703996 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in one case, a college student practiced repeating numbers that were read to him aloud for an hour each day.
&lt;ref name="Ericcson"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ericcson KA, Chase WG, Faloon S |title=Acquisition of a memory skill |journal=Science |volume=208 |issue=4448 |pages=1181–2 |date=June 1980 |pmid=7375930 |format=pdf|doi= 10.1126/science.7375930|url=http://www.psy.cmu.edu/chasepapers/Acquisition%20of%20a%20Memory%20Skill.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
He did this three to five times a week for 20 months until he could repeat as many as 79 digits. While his capacity on this trained task had improved, his working memory: the ability to store information, as described above had not. This was most clearly demonstrated when, asked to repeat letters instead of numbers, this same student with over 320 hrs of practice at recalling digits could recall only six letters at a time: a normal to below average performance. The effect of the training was not to improve the working memory system but to change the information being stored: the student had learned multiple methods of grouping numbers and relating them to similar figures already in his [[long-term memory]]. In reality, his working memory capacity had not increased. This study and others like it contributed to the prevailing assumption in the scientific community that working memory is a set characteristic that cannot be improved.

==ADHD controversy==
Many clinical studies published in 1990s and 2000s claim that working memory training is an efficient strategy for mitigating effects of ADHD and other cognitive disorders.&lt;ref name="Klingberg, 2009"&gt;{{cite book |author=Klingberg, Torkel |title=The overflowing brain: information overload and the limits of working memory |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=2009 |chapter=8. The plasticity of the brain|pages= |isbn=978-0-19-537288-5 |oclc=218190606 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many studies also demonstrated that working memory training enhances episodic memory and could lead to better performance and improvements in fluid intelligence and processing speed tasks in the elderly.&lt;ref name="Borella, 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Erika |last1=Borella |first2=Barbara |last2=Carretti |first3=Francesco |last3=Riboldi |first4=Rossana |last4=De Beni |url=https://www.gwern.net/docs/dnb/2010-borella.pdf |title=Working memory training in older adults: evidence of transfer and maintenance  |format=pdf |year=2010 |journal=Psychology and Aging |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=767–778 |doi=10.1037/a0020683|pmid=20973604 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heinzel, 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Stephan |last1=Heinzel |first2=Stefanie |last2=Schulte |first3=Johanna |last3=Onken |first4=Quynh-Lam |last4=Duong |first5=Thomas G. |last5=Riemer |first6=Andreas |last6=Heinz |first7=Norbert |last7=Kathmann |first8=Michael A. |last8=Rapp |url=https://www.gwern.net/docs/dnb/2013-heinzel.pdf |title=Working memory training improvements and gains in non-trained cognitive tasks in young and older adults |format=pdf |journal= Aging, Neuropsychology, and Cognition |year=2013 |doi=10.1080/13825585.2013.790338 |pmid=23639070 |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=146–173}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Xin, 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Xin |first1=Zhao |last2=Lai |first2=Zhou-Ren |last3=Li |first3=Fu |last4=Maes |first4=Joseph H.R. |title=Near- and Far-Transfer Effects of Working Memory Updating Training in Elderly Adults |journal= Applied Cognitive Psychology |date=May 2014 |doi=10.1002/acp.3011 |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=403–408}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
[[Georgia Institute of Technology]] researchers who reviewed 17 studies on WMT concluded that "the results are inconsistent" due to the fact that many studies had "inadequate controls" as well as "ineffective measurement of the cognitive abilities of interest."&lt;ref name="Shipstead, 2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://englelab.gatech.edu/2010/shipsteadredickengle.pdf |title=Does working memory training generalize? |format=pdf |vauthors=Shipstead Z, Redick TS, Engle RW |work=Psychologica Belgica |year=2010 |volume=50 |issue=3&amp;4 |pages=245–276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, a systematic meta-analytic review was undertaken.&lt;ref name=Melby-Lervag(2012)/&gt; Stringent criteria for inclusion ensured that all studies were either [[randomized controlled trials]] or [[quasi-experiments]]. All studies had to have a treatment and a treated or untreated control group. By this time, some twenty-three studies met these criteria, including both clinical samples of typically developing children and adults. The results closely replicated the original finding by Ericcson et al. (1980):&lt;ref name="Ericcson"/&gt; There were short-term improvements in practiced skills. While the results were conclusive for ADHD population, there was no convincing evidence for transfer or generalization effects (indicating improved capacity) in typically developing children and healthy adults."&lt;ref name=Melby-Lervag(2012)/&gt;

Other researchers have studied the effects of training on children with attention issues. Among them are [[NYU]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first1=Christopher |last1=Lucas |first2=Howard |last2=Abikoff |first3=Eva |last3=Petkova |first4=Weijin |last4=Gan |first5=Solomon |last5=Sved |first6=Lindsey |last6=Bruett |first7=Brittany |last7=Eldridge |title=NR6-052: A Randomized Controlled Trial of Two Forms of Computerized Working Memory Training in ADHD (poster) |url=http://www.cdzjesenik.cz/APA_Poster_Lucas_May_2008.pdf |conference=American Psychiatric Association |date=2008 |format=pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline |date=October 2016}} and the [[University of York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Holmes J, Gathercole SE, Dunning DL |title=Adaptive training leads to sustained enhancement of poor working memory in children |journal=Dev Sci |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=F9–15 |date=July 2009 |pmid=19635074 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-7687.2009.00848.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, many researchers are now exploring the use of working memory training for various new applications, with studies having been completed or launched on normal and aging adults,&lt;ref&gt;Westerberg, H, Brehmer, Y, D'Hondt, N, Söderlund, D, Bäckman, L (2007) Computerized training of working memory – A new method for improving cognition in aging.

In the February 2009 edition of ''Science'', Klingberg and colleagues, led by F McNab, claimed that adaptive [[memory span|span]] training had led to changes in [[dopamine]] D1 and D2 receptors.&lt;ref name="mcnab2009"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McNab F, Varrone A, Farde L, Jucaite A, Bystritsky P, Forssberg H, Klingberg T | year = 2009 | title = Changes in cortical dopamine D1 receptor binding associated with cognitive training | url = | journal = Science | volume = 323 | issue = 5915| pages = 800–802 | doi=10.1126/science.1166102 | pmid=19197069}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same study, tests of "far transfer" – whether or not the skills in one test applied to very different intelligence-related skills – were made. The results were not reported.&lt;ref name="Shipstead, 2010"/&gt; (see supporting online materials). Moreoever, research at the Wallenberg Neuroscience Center in Sweden indicates that working memory training may '''decrease''' hippocampal [[neurogenesis]]. When experimental medical scientists trained adult male rats in a working memory task for 4 or 14 days, rats trained for two weeks had fewer newborn hippocampal neurons than those that were only trained for 4 days. The report suggests that increased [[stress (psychological)|stress]], caused by an intense training of working memory, can reduce the production of hippocampal neurons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mohapel|first=P.|author2=K.
