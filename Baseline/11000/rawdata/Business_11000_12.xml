'''Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești''' ({{IPA-ro|alekˈsandru boɡˈdan piˈteʃtʲ}}; born '''Alexandru Bogdan''', also known as '''Ion Doican''', '''Ion Duican''' and '''Al. Dodan'''; June 13, 1870 &amp;ndash; May 12, 1922) was a [[Romania]]n [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] poet, essayist, and art and literary critic, who was also known as a journalist and [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] political agitator. A wealthy landowner, he invested his fortune in patronage and art collecting, becoming one of the main local promoters of [[modern art]], and a sponsor of the [[Symbolist movement in Romania|Romanian Symbolist movement]]. Together with other [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionist]] and Symbolist cultural figures, Bogdan-Pitești established ''Societatea Ileana'', which was one of the first Romanian associations dedicated to promoting the [[avant-garde]] and independent art. He was also noted for his friendship with the writers [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]], [[Alexandru Macedonski]], [[Tudor Arghezi]] and [[Mateiu Caragiale]], as well as for sponsoring, among others, the painters [[Ștefan Luchian]], [[Constantin Artachino]] and [[Nicolae Vermont]]. In addition to his literary and political activities, Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești was himself a painter and graphic artist.

Much of Bogdan-Pitești's controversial political career, inaugurated by his support for [[anarchism]], was dedicated to activism and support for revolution. He also had an interest in the [[occult]], and maintained close contacts with [[Joséphin Péladan|Joséphin "Sâr" Péladan]]—sponsoring Péladan's journey to [[Bucharest]] (1898). He was detained by the authorities at various intervals, including an arrest for [[sedition]] during the [[Romanian general election, 1899|1899 election]], and was later found guilty of having [[blackmail]]ed the banker [[Aristide Blank]]. Late in his life, he led ''[[Seara (newspaper)|Seara]]'', a [[Germanophile]] daily, as well as a literary and political circle which came to oppose Romania's entry into [[World War I]] on the [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]]' side. He was arrested one final time upon the end of the war, by which time he had become the object of public hatred. The enduring mysteries and contradictions of Bogdan-Pitești's career have since drawn interest from several generations of art and literary historians.

==Biography==

===Early life and anarchism===
A native of [[Pitești]], Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești was the son of a landowner from [[Olt County|Olt]],&lt;ref name="Tudor Vianu, p.370"&gt;Tudor Vianu, p.370&lt;/ref&gt; and, on his father's side, the descendant of immigrants from the [[Epirus (region)|Epirote]] area of [[Ioannina]], whose ethnicity was either [[Aromanians|Aromanian]]&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.42"&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.42&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="coroiu"&gt;{{ro icon}} Constantin Coroiu, [http://www.evenimentul.ro/articol/pluta-de-naufragiu-2.html "Pluta de naufragiu (2)"], in ''[[Evenimentul]]'', December 30, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Albanians|Albanian]].&lt;ref name="zamba"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Krikor Zambaccian]], Chapter VIII: "Al. Bogdan-Pitești", in [http://editura.liternet.ro/carte/80/Krikor-H.-Zambaccian/Insemnarile-unui-amator-de-arta.html ''Însemnările unui amator de artă''], published and hosted by LiterNet. Retrieved July 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; His father became a local leader of the [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880–1918)|Conservative Party]].&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.42"/&gt; His mother was a [[boyar]]ess,&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.42"/&gt; and, as art collector and memoirist [[Krikor Zambaccian]] recounted, may have been a descendant of the Balotescu boyar clan.&lt;ref name="zamba"/&gt; Bogdan-Pitești also had a sister, Elena Constanța Bogdan; both she and her mother reportedly survived his death.&lt;ref name="vmprint"&gt;Veronica Marinescu, "Un «prinț al artelor» uitat de vreme. Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești și Vlaiciul primelor tabere de creație", in ''[[Curierul Național]]'', July 22, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; As one of his eccentricities, Bogdan-Pitești encouraged the—unsustainable—rumor that he was a direct descendant of an ancient [[Wallachia]]n [[List of rulers of Wallachia|ruling house]], the [[House of Basarab|Basarab Princes]].&lt;ref name="zamba"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchievici, p.346, 347-348&lt;/ref&gt;

According to at least one account, Bogdan-Pitești was educated in [[Geneva]], at a local [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] institution.&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.42"/&gt; Raised in the [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]] faith, he converted to Catholicism in his twenties,&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.189; Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.17, 42; Mitchievici, p.341, 344; Teacă, p.52&lt;/ref&gt; but was no longer a practicing Catholic by the time of his death.&lt;ref name="zamba"/&gt; He supposedly attended medical school at the [[University of Montpellier]], without ever graduating, and afterwards left to join the [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] milieu of Paris.&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.42"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zamba"/&gt; He may have enrolled at the [[University of Paris]], studying Law and Letters, but probably withdrew after a short while.&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.42"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zamba"/&gt; Art historian Sanda Miller recounts that Bogdan-Pitești attended the ''[[École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts|École des Beaux-Arts]]'' in the French capital, but that he was ultimately expelled.&lt;ref name="sandamiller"&gt;Sanda Miller, "Paciurea's Chimeras", in ''[[Apollo (magazine)|Apollo]]'', October 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources express doubt that the Romanian aristocrat was ever affiliated with any university or college, in either France or [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;Teacă, p.52&lt;/ref&gt;

According to literary historian [[Tudor Vianu]], at that stage, the young man began associating with the criminal underworld.&lt;ref name="Tudor Vianu, p.370"/&gt; He soon established a connection with the [[Anarchism in France|French anarchist]] circles, while also associating with a branch of the growing [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.42; Mitchievici, p.337, 344; Teacă, p.52-54&lt;/ref&gt; Like others in his generation, he may have been driven by a desire for shocking and morbid experiences. According to art historian [[Theodor Enescu]], these ranged from erotic experimentation to the "boisterous shivers of anarchism", and from criminal enterprise to [[Decadent movement|decadent poetry]].&lt;ref&gt;Teacă, p.53&lt;/ref&gt; Bogdan-Pitești was a presence in the anarchist group of [[Auguste Vaillant]] (later guillotined for plotting a terrorist coup),&lt;ref name="Tudor Vianu, p.370"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zamba"/&gt; and was possibly acquainted with some of the more prestigious anarchist intellectuals: [[Élisée Reclus]],&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.42"/&gt; [[Laurent Tailhade]] and (especially influential on him) [[Félix Fénéon]].&lt;ref name="Teacă, p.52-53"&gt;Teacă, p.52-53&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports exist that Bogdan-Pitești's politics were already a merger of opposite or hardly compatible doctrines. He respected Catholicism and [[Judaism]] as the most elevated religious cultures, rejected Orthodoxy, [[atheism]] and [[communism]] as ideologies for the mediocre, and depicted himself as a [[Christian anarchism|Catholic anarchist]].&lt;ref&gt;Mitchievici, p.344, 357&lt;/ref&gt; He believed in [[craniometry]], and took [[scientific racism]] at face value.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchievici, p.346-349&lt;/ref&gt; At some stage during the late 1880s, Bogdan-Pitești became a supporter of [[Georges Ernest Boulanger|General Boulanger]], who attempted to gain power in France with support from the [[Orléanist]], [[Bonapartism|Bonapartist]] and [[Socialism|socialist]] camps; he reputedly befriended the prominent Boulangist and [[Romantic nationalist]] thinker [[Maurice Barrès]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.42. See also Mitchievici, p.327-328, 337&lt;/ref&gt;

In parallel, he himself became a representative of literary and artistic Symbolism, and supposedly maintained contacts with authors such as [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]], [[Maurice Maeterlinck]], [[Octave Mirbeau]], [[Jean Moréas]], and [[Paul Verlaine]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.42. See also Mitchievici, p.337; Teacă, p.52&lt;/ref&gt; Another influence on him was the [[occult]]ist and novelist [[Joséphin Péladan]], whose [[Salon de la Rose + Croix|Rosicrucian salon]] he attended several times.&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.42"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zamba"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sandamiller"/&gt;

Bogdan-Pitești debuted as a writer and political essayist. It was later reported, but not confirmed, that he published his pieces in newspapers and magazines of diverse backgrounds—''[[Le Figaro]]'', ''[[Le Gaulois]]'', ''[[Gil Blas (periodical)|Gil Blas]]'', ''[[L'Intransigeant]]'' and ''[[La Libre Parole]]'' among them.&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.42"/&gt; A lover and protector of actresses in both France and [[Switzerland]], he also claimed to have played a part in staging the first Genevan showing of [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Die Walküre]]''.&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.42"/&gt;

Placed under surveillance due to his involvement in revolutionary politics by 1894,&lt;ref name="Boia, p.189"&gt;Boia, p.189&lt;/ref&gt; Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești was eventually expelled from France, despite Huysmans' intervention in his favor.&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.42"/&gt; Reputedly, the deportation document identified him as a "threat to public order".&lt;ref name="Ionescu, ''Mișcarea...'', p.234"&gt;Ionescu, ''Mișcarea...'', p.234&lt;/ref&gt; One urban legend recounts that Bogdan-Pitești was present at Vaillant's public execution and leaned over to kiss Vaillant's mangled body, which both disgusted and alarmed the judicial establishment.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchievici, p.127, 350, 389&lt;/ref&gt; Zambaccian suggests that the decision to deport the Romanian provocateur was not politically motivated. He writes that Bogdan-Pitești had exhausted the patience of French authorities by trafficking in stolen bicycles.&lt;ref name="zamba"/&gt;

From France, Bogdan-Pitești had contemplated the idea of revolutionizing [[Art of Romania|Romanian art]], and, upon his arrival to Bucharest, began organizing artists' reunions at the [[Kübler Coffeehouse|Kübler]] and Fialkowski coffeehouses.&lt;ref name="gr79"&gt;Rus, p.79&lt;/ref&gt; In 1896, with [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionist]] artists [[Constantin Artachino]], [[Ștefan Luchian]] and [[Nicolae Vermont]], he founded ''Salonul Independenților'', the Romanian replica of the French ''[[Société des Artistes Indépendants]]''.&lt;ref name="zamba"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jianu &amp; Comarnescu, p.34-36; Lassaigne &amp; Enescu, p.49-51, 104.

The exhibits featured some of Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești's own drawings, which he intended to use as illustrations for his book of [[French language|French-language]] poems, ''Sensations internes'' ("Internal Sensations").&lt;ref name="zamba"/&gt; He planned for his art movement to reach outside Romania, and, also in 1896, financed an international exhibition of independent and [[avant-garde]] artists.&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.42"/&gt; ''Salonul'' was known for its public protest against [[academic art]]: located just outside the [[Romanian Athenaeum]] building (a main venue for local [[Neoclassicism]]), it put up Petrescu Găină's huge caricature of academic artist [[C. I. Stăncescu]], and flew a [[red flag (politics)|red flag]] next to it.&lt;ref name="Jianu &amp; Comarnescu, p.35"/&gt; This call to socialist rebellion attracted public attention, and the flag was urgently taken down by agents of the [[Romanian Police]].&lt;ref name="Jianu &amp; Comarnescu, p.35"/&gt; The subsequent exhibitions were viewed with sympathy by a section of the press, including the leftist newspaper ''[[Adevărul]]''. It republished pieces ridiculing Stăncescu in his role of official curator, and made favorable comments on all of the ''Salonul Independenților'' artists.&lt;ref&gt;Ionescu, ''Mișcarea...'', p.229-234&lt;/ref&gt; Noting the leader's own anarchist past, ''Adevărul'' art columnist Gal wrote: "Bogdan has all the qualities and flaws of a sincere French revolutionary, but one who is not entirely clear and scientific. He has an extraordinary love for all things independent and hates to the point of excess all sectarian people, and all schools."&lt;ref name="Ionescu, ''Mișcarea...'', p.234"/&gt; In June 1896, the group of "secessionists" was commissioned to decorate Bragadiru Garden, where Romania's press held its annual fair. The show, attended by Bogdan-Pitești, prominently featured Stăncescu's caricature at the entrance.&lt;ref name="Ionescu, ''Mișcarea...'', p.234"/&gt;

Despite rhetoric, the new art club was not entirely opposed to tradition, and occasionally appealed to it as a basis for cultural reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;Ionescu, ''Mișcarea...'', p.227-235; {{ro icon}} [[Amelia Pavel]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Pictura-evreilor-din-Romania-interferente-culturale*articleID_5142-articles_details.html "Pictura evreilor din România: interferențe culturale"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 29, September 2000&lt;/ref&gt; ''Salonul'' boasted among its honorary members the lionized oil painter [[Nicolae Grigorescu]], who had trained with the [[Barbizon school]].&lt;ref name="Lassaigne &amp; Enescu, p.51"&gt;Lassaigne &amp; Enescu, p.51&lt;/ref&gt; Bogdan-Pitești was especially fond of Luchian's work, and, in an 1896 article for the cultural magazine ''Revista Orientală'', spoke of him as "an admirable colorist", a "free spirit", and a purveyor of "revolutionary ideas".&lt;ref&gt;Lassaigne &amp; Enescu, p.104. See also Rus, p.78-79, 80&lt;/ref&gt; He boosted Luchian's self-confidence, urging him to apply his talents to illustrating "an idea",&lt;ref name="gr79"/&gt; and was entirely adverse to Grigorescu's traditionalist manner. Luchian still used Grigorescu as a source of inspiration in his own work, prompting scholars to argue that Grigorescu's ''Salonul Independenților'' reception was Bogdan-Pitești's unwilling concession to his star protégé.&lt;ref&gt;Jianu &amp; Comarnescu, p.40&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Literatorul'', ''Bronzes'', ''Ileana''===
Bogdan-Pitești was by then an inspiration for the blooming [[Symbolist movement in Romania|Romanian Symbolist movement]]. In effect, he was the first Romanian expert on the work of Symbolist celebrities like [[Odilon Redon]], [[Gustave Moreau]], and (his favorite) [[Alexandre Séon]].&lt;ref&gt;Mitchievici, p.337-338&lt;/ref&gt; He soon became a contributor to ''[[Literatorul]]'', a Symbolist magazine,&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.42"/&gt;&lt;ref name="coroiu"/&gt; and was close friends with its founder, [[Alexandru Macedonski]]. In 1897, he was chosen by the latter to edit and promote his book of French-language poems, ''Bronzes''.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.42; Tudor Vianu, p.369-371&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, Bogdan-Pitești provided the funds needed for ''Bronzes'' to be published in Paris.&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.42"/&gt; It came out with an introductory note, in which Bogdan-Pitești favorably compared Macedonski with arch-rival [[Mihai Eminescu]].&lt;ref name="coroiu"/&gt; In more general terms, the preface showed Bogdan-Pitești as an unyielding [[Francophile]], who reported with alarm that Romania risked being seduced and then engulfed by [[German culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.190-191&lt;/ref&gt; Himself a disciple of Macedonski, T. Vianu comments that Bogdan-Pitești was probably unsuited for the task of introducing ''Bronzes'', and that, despite expectations, the volume failed to impress the French public.&lt;ref&gt;Tudor Vianu, p.369, 371&lt;/ref&gt; He notes the virtually complete lack of press reviews—with the notable exception of a May 1898 article in ''[[Mercure de France]]'', written by the Symbolist-anarchist [[Pierre Quillard]].&lt;ref&gt;Tudor Vianu, p.371&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 1898, back in Romania, Bogdan-Pitești and the other ''Salonul Independenților'' initiators joined up with author [[Ioan Bacalbașa]] and architect [[Ștefan Ciocâlteu]].&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.42"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zamba"/&gt; This diverse group established ''Societatea Ileana'', an association dedicated to supporting innovative artists.&lt;ref name="zamba"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sandamiller"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ionescuartach"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jianu &amp; Comarnescu, p.40; Vianu, p.370. See also Ionescu, ''Mișcarea...'', p.240-248; Rus, p.79-80&lt;/ref&gt; Its steering committee was later joined by the intellectual and political figures [[Constantin Rădulescu-Motru]], [[Nicolae Xenopol]], and [[Nicolae Filipescu]], as well as by the painter [[Jean Alexandru Steriadi]].&lt;ref name="Lassaigne &amp; Enescu, p.51"/&gt; The society took up the effort to uproot against academic salons, organizing a large and provocative exhibit in 1898, and, at the height of its popularity, enlisted in its ranks some 300 people.&lt;ref&gt;Ionescu, ''Mișcarea...'', p.240-242&lt;/ref&gt; Despite such consolidation, various ''Ileana'' affiliates were not entirely committed to the cause, and never severed their links with Stănescu's official section.&lt;ref&gt;Ionescu, ''Mișcarea...'', p.240-248&lt;/ref&gt;

The new circle held meetings in a Brezoianu Street studio which was also its patron's home.&lt;ref name="Teacă, p.54"&gt;Teacă, p.54&lt;/ref&gt; Its feminine name ''[[Ileana]]'' was probably a borrowing from [[Romanian folklore]], and may reference the [[fairy tale]] character [[Ileana Cosânzeana]].&lt;ref name="sandamiller"/&gt; The group's press organ, also known as ''Ileana'', was edited by Bacalbașa&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.42"/&gt; and illustrated by Luchian.&lt;ref name="zamba"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ionescuartach"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ionescu, ''Mișcarea...'', p.242; Lassaigne &amp; Enescu, p.52-53, 105; Mitchievici, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; Described by Vianu as a "refined art magazine",&lt;ref name="Tudor Vianu, p.370"/&gt; it is also considered the first one of its kind in Romania.&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.43"&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.43&lt;/ref&gt;

In parallel, Bogdan-Pitești began frequenting the country's first socialist pressure group, the  [[Romanian Social Democratic Workers' Party]] (PSDMR), and attending meetings between Bucharest workers. The PSDMR denounced him as an ''[[agent provocateur]]'' of the Conservative Party, and he stood accused of breaking the party into tolerant and [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] halves.&lt;ref&gt;Ion C. Atanasiu, ''Pagini din istoria contimporană a României: 1881-1916. Vol. I: Mișcarea socialistă: 1881-1900'', [[Adevărul|Editura Adevĕrul]], Bucharest [n.y.], p.331-334&lt;/ref&gt;

===Péladan's visit===
[[File:Bogdan-Pitesti and Peladan.jpg|thumb|Photograph of Bogdan-Pitești (left) and [[Joséphin Péladan]], during the latter's visit to [[Bucharest]]]]

As head of ''Ileana'', Bogdan-Pitești organized [[Joséphin Péladan]]'s 1898 visit to Bucharest.&lt;ref name="sandamiller"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.42, 407; Mitchievici, p.71, 321, 327-337; Teacă, p.52; Tudor Vianu, p.370&lt;/ref&gt; It was a much-publicized event, which attracted the attention of high society and received ample coverage in the press; Bogdan-Pitești accompanied Péladan on visits to various Bucharest landmarks, including the Athenaeum, the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Chamber of Deputies]], the Orthodox [[Romanian Patriarchal Cathedral|Metropolitan]] and [[Domnița Bălașa Church|Domnița Bălașa]] churches, as well as the [[Roman Catholicism in Romania|Roman Catholic]] [[Catedrala Sfântul Iosif|Saint Joseph Cathedral]].&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.42-43"&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.42-43&lt;/ref&gt; Among the politicians who attended the ceremonies were Nicolae Filipescu, [[Constantin Dissescu]], [[Take Ionescu]], [[Ioan Lahovary]], and [[Constantin C. Arion]]; prominent intellectuals ([[Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea]], Rădulescu-Motru etc.) were in the audience.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.42-43; Mitchievici, p.331-334&lt;/ref&gt;

Péladan agreed to lecture in front of ''Societatea Ileana'' at the Atheneum, and his subject of choice was ''The Genius of the [[Italic peoples|Latin Race]]''.&lt;ref name="sandamiller"/&gt; His mystical doctrine was received with much skepticism and amusement by the Romanian literary chroniclers.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchievici, p.328-329, 331, 333-337&lt;/ref&gt; The visit then turned to scandal: Péladan issued a call for all Romanians to embrace Catholicism, and left the country on pain of being deported.&lt;ref&gt;"Cronologia della vita di Joséphin Péladan", in Marisa Verna, ''L'opera teatrale di Joséphin Péladan: esoterismo e magia nel dramma simbolista'', Vita e Pensiero, Milan, 2000, p.18.  {{ISBN|88-343-0063-7}}. See also Mitchievici, p.334-336&lt;/ref&gt;

Various commentators are entirely dismissive of the visit and its importance. Th. Enescu describes its impact as "amazing", since Péladan was merely an "unusual [''funambulesc'' in the original] representative of [[Culture of France|French culture]]".&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.42-43"/&gt; He also proposes that the reception, with its "noisy" and "exacerbated" fanfare, shows the "complexes of a provincial culture, confronted with the promiscuous exorbitance of a great culture".&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.43"/&gt; This assessment is quoted by literary historian [[Paul Cernat]], who also notes Péladan's "rather modest value" should not have allowed such reactions.&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.42"/&gt; Cernat concedes that the Péladan visit was important for promoting new cultural trends, specifically the notions of [[art for art's sake]] and decadence, even though this was done "through the means ''of politics'' [italics in the original]".&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.43"/&gt;

Cultural historian [[Angelo Mitchievici]] proposes that, modelling himself on Péladan, Bogdan-Pitești was becoming the "[[Wiktionary:spinmeister|spinmeister]]" of oriental Symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchievici, p.337&lt;/ref&gt; As ''Ion Doican'' (or ''Duican''), he contributed to ''Ileana'' essays praising various contemporary painters: [[Arthur Verona]], [[George Demetrescu Mirea]],&lt;ref name="zamba"/&gt; and, most of all, Luchian.&lt;ref&gt;Rus, p.79-80&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ileana'' only published a few issues before closing down in 1901.&lt;ref name="zamba"/&gt; Bogdan-Pitești's collaborator Bacalbașa, known by then as a dramatist, also attended, but drifted away from the group in 1900, giving up his position as editor of ''Ileana''.&lt;ref name="Lassaigne &amp; Enescu, p.110"&gt;Lassaigne &amp; Enescu, p.110&lt;/ref&gt; A similar split occurred between Luchian and his patron, sparked when Bogdan-Pitești made some favorable comments on Stăncescu's work, and probably took several years to mend.&lt;ref&gt;Jianu &amp; Comarnescu, p.44-46; Rus, p.80&lt;/ref&gt; Over that decade, Bogdan-Pitești had also become one of ''[[Literatorul]]''{{'}}s main financial backers.&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.41"&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.41&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in 1910, at a time when Romanian art came to be me more familiar with new artistic trends (including [[Cubism]] and [[Fauvism]], both advocated locally by art critic [[Theodor Cornel]]),&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.45-46&lt;/ref&gt; Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești adapted his discourse to the new trends. The art patron, who probably exercised considerable influence over Cornel,&lt;ref&gt;Teacă, p.51&lt;/ref&gt; publicly complained that, instead of keeping up with the times, his fellow Romanian intellectuals still regarded [[Impressionism]] as the ultimate novelty.&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.46"&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.46&lt;/ref&gt; On the occasion, he hailed the Post-Impressionist French artists [[Paul Gauguin]] and [[Paul Cézanne]] as the models to follow.&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.46"/&gt; He was actively seeking to mend his split with Luchian, and, although he called the painter "inconsistent", again stated that he found him to be Romania's best young artist.&lt;ref&gt;Jianu &amp; Comarnescu, p.243; Rus, p.80&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slatina revolt and Vlaici colony===
[[File:Nicolae Vermont - Vara la conac.jpg|thumb|360px|[[Nicolae Vermont]]'s ''Vara la conac'' ("Summer at the Manor"), a 1912 depiction of Bogdan-Pitești's estate]]

After his return to Romania, Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești was still noted for his political activities, although these shifted to the background during his ''Ileana'' years. According to some reports, he spent some of his free time touring the countryside, rallying up peasants, inciting them to rebel, and mapping out a radical [[Land reform in Romania|land reform]].&lt;ref name="coroiu"/&gt; During the [[Romanian general election, 1899|general election of 1899]], he ran for a deputy seat in both [[Olt County|Olt]] and [[Ilfov County|Ilfov]], without registering success.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p. 43; Jianu &amp; Comarnescu, p. 46; Lassaigne &amp; Enescu, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; There was confusion as to Bogdan-Pitești's political affiliation. He was known as "the peasants' candidate", but both sides of the Romanian [[two-party system]], the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]] and the Conservative group, accused the other of secretly supporting his bid.&lt;ref name="ojale2"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/tribunapoporului/1899/BCUCLUJ_FP_P2514_1899_003_0114.pdf "O jale in România"], in ''Tribuna Poporului'', Nr. 114/1899, p. 2 (digitized by the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt;

During such campaigns, he is said to have misled his voters into believing that he was a son of the deposed ''[[Domnitor]]'' [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]], and therefore a natural champion of land reform.&lt;ref name="coroiu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p. 43; Mitchievici, p. 125, 338, 357&lt;/ref&gt; His activity in Olt is credited with having sparked some violent incidents: in at least one account, he instigated the peasants of [[Slatina, Romania|Slatina]] area to riot, and their revolt was only suppressed with use of force.&lt;ref&gt;Lassaigne &amp; Enescu, p.110; Mitchievici, p.338, 348&lt;/ref&gt; Others however claim that the [[Romanian Land Forces]] randomly shot at, then charged upon, the peaceful mass of demonstrators, killing at least 35 of them.&lt;ref name="ojale2"/&gt;

The Slatina crisis reverberated in the capital and posed problems for the Conservative cabinet of [[Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino]]. Reportedly, both the [[Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (Romania)|Minister of Agriculture]] [[Nicolae Fleva]] and the [[Ministry of Justice (Romania)|Minister of Justice]] Dissescu were ready to hand in their resignations.&lt;ref name="ojale2"/&gt; Bogdan-Pitești himself was arrested for [[sedition]], but soon after checked himself into Filantropia Hospital.&lt;ref name="ojale2"/&gt; He averted sentencing when the prosecutors were unable to conclusively prove this involvement.&lt;ref&gt;Jianu &amp; Comarnescu, p.46; Mitchievici, p.338&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, Bogdan-Pitești claimed to have been held in judicial custody for some forty separate incidents, stressing that all these convictions were owed to [[political crime]]s—while reporting this statement, T. Vianu noted that at least some should in fact be considered punishments for various [[misdemeanor]]s.&lt;ref name="Tudor Vianu, p.370"/&gt; In time, the anarchist boyar had also come to be known as an inveterate criminal and jailbird, which attracted him the disparaging moniker ''Bogdan-Văcărești'' (after [[Văcărești prison]] in Bucharest).&lt;ref name="coroiu"/&gt; Others twisted his birth name into the parodic ''Bogdan-Ciupești'' (from ''a ciupi'', "to gyp").&lt;ref name="coroiu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="svalintari"&gt;{{ro icon}} Simona Vasilache, [http://www.romlit.ro/alintri "Alintări"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 26/2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/romanul/1914/BCUCLUJ_FP_P2581_1914_004_0098.pdf "Mangra la București"], in ''Românul (Arad)'', Nr. 98/1914, p.5 (digitized by the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt;

Bogdan-Pitești consolidated his own estate when he inherited a manor in Vlaici village (part of [[Colonești, Olt|Colonești]]). It was, beginning in 1908, the center of his activities and home to his sizable art collection, as well as one of the first locations in Romania acting as a summer camp for painters and sculptors.&lt;ref name="vmprint"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.190; Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vmvlaici"&gt;Veronica Marinescu, "Conacul de la Vlaici al colecționarului Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești, într-o stare jalnică", in ''[[Curierul Național]]'', August 12, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The events he planned were attended by the ''Ileana'' regulars, and, in time, attracted virtually all other major ''[[en plein air]]'' painters of the day: [[Nicolae Dărăscu]], [[Ștefan Dimitrescu]], [[Iosif Iser]], [[M. H. Maxy]], [[Theodor Pallady]], [[Camil Ressu]].&lt;ref name="vmprint"/&gt;

In his recollections from that period, writer [[Victor Eftimiu]] suggested that the relationship was not entirely harmonious: "Camil Ressu, like other young unknown painters, found a lot of support and encouragement with Bogdan-Pitești. Truth be told, the maecenate was rather thrifty, it profited from the needs of the debuting and impoverished artist. But without it things would've been much worse, since others did not even offer as much". He also argued that, contrary to speculation about his wealth, Bogdan-Pitești "maybe paid up so little because that is all he had to spare".&lt;ref name="Teacă, p.57"&gt;Teacă, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; Reputedly, the ''Ileana'' boss was losing a fortune on maintaining the Vlaici manor, surrounded as it was by barren land.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchievici, p. 343&lt;/ref&gt;

===Știrbey-Vodă circle===
Circa 1908, the Bogdan-Pitești villa on Bucharest's Știrbey-Vodă Street (near the [[Cișmigiu Gardens]]) began hosting regular gatherings of intellectuals.&lt;ref name="zamba"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.43"/&gt; Among those who attended in successive stages were the writers Macedonski, Eftimiu, [[Tudor Arghezi]], [[Mateiu Caragiale]], [[Benjamin Fondane]], [[Gala Galaction]], [[George Bacovia]], [[Ion Minulescu]], [[Claudia Millian]], [[N. D. Cocea]], [[Ion Vinea]], [[F. Brunea-Fox]], [[Eugeniu Ștefănescu-Est]], [[A. de Herz]], [[Ion Călugăru]], and [[Adrian Maniu]].&lt;ref name="zamba"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.34, 39, 44. See also Boia, p.189-190; Mitchievici, p.339-357&lt;/ref&gt; It also hosted the artists Luchian, Artachino, Verona, Maxy, Iser, Steriadi, Dimitrescu, Pallady, Ressu, Dărăscu, [[Nina Arbore]], [[Constantin Brâncuși]], [[Constantin Medrea]], [[Dimitrie Paciurea]], [[Maria Ciurdea Steurer]], [[Oscar Han]], [[Nicolae Tonitza]], [[Ion Theodorescu-Sion]], [[Friedrich Storck]] and [[Cecilia Cuțescu-Storck]], as well as [[Abgar Baltazar]], [[Alexandru Brătășanu]], [[Alexandru Poitevin-Skeletti]], [[George Demetrescu Mirea]], [[Rodica Maniu]], and [[Marcel Janco]].&lt;ref name="zamba"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.39, 44. See also Mitchievici, p.339, 354-357; Teacă, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1908, following Iser's proposal, Bogdan-Pitești sponsored a Bucharest exhibit showcasing works by the renowned European painters [[Demetrios Galanis]], [[Jean-Louis Forain]] and [[André Derain]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.407&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1910, his patronage took on new forms. Literary critic [[Șerban Cioculescu]] notes that, at least initially, his relationship with Mateiu Caragiale included a financial aspect, since Bogdan-Pitești inviting the destitute poet to dinner and provided him with funds.&lt;ref&gt;Ș. Cioculescu, p.369&lt;/ref&gt; He was also granting lodging and material to various disadvantaged painters, as reported by his close friend Arghezi,&lt;ref name="zamba"/&gt; and took a special interest in promoting the poetry of [[Ștefan Petică]] (as well as that of Arghezi himself).&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.41"/&gt; Arghezi claimed that such influence and moral support were also "decisive" in at least one other case, that of Luchian.&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.41"/&gt; In his memoir of the period, linguist [[Alexandru Rosetti]] mentioned that, on a daily basis, Bogdan-Pitești invited "over a dozen artists" for supper at his home.&lt;ref name="rosettiargh"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Alexandru Rosetti]], [http://www.cronicaromana.ro/tudor-arghezi.html "Tudor Arghezi"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719124924/http://www.cronicaromana.ro/tudor-arghezi.html |date=2011-07-19 }}, in ''[[Cronica Română]]'', April 8, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Bogdan-Pitești's renewed his attacks on the Orthodox Church. [[Paul Cernat]] sees them as efforts to fabricate a religious alternative to the Orthodox mainstream, included in the larger phenomenon that was Symbolist [[cosmopolitanism]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.17&lt;/ref&gt; However, Galaction, who was to end his life as an Orthodox priest, recorded that the Știrbey-Vodă circle accommodated people of very diverse backgrounds. At one time, they included, alongside Galaction himself, the Roman Catholic priest Carol Auner, the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] sculptor Storck, and the anarchist activist [[Panait Mușoiu]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.189; Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.44&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cernat, Bogdan-Pitești's bohemian society also grouped people believed associated with the illegal activities, and was noted for its "[[libertine]]" atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.39, 43&lt;/ref&gt; Galaction backed such interpretations, writing that the salon was also home to "a dozen con artists and prostitutes."&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.190; Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.44&lt;/ref&gt; The atmosphere was colloquial and free-spirited, to the point of being demeaning: story goes that the artists and writers were sometimes told licentious jokes, or had to endure grotesque farces.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchievici, p.341, 344, 345, 349, 351, 354; Teacă, p.54&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[dandy]], Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești himself led a life of luxury, marked by excess, and had by then become a [[Drug addiction|drug addict]].&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.41"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aonarco5"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Andrei Oișteanu]], [http://www.revista22.ro/scriitorii-romani-si-narcoticele-5-prima-jumatate-a-secolului-xx-4580.html "Scriitorii români și narcoticele (5).

Herself a libertine, Domnica was described by researchers as an [[Androgyny|androgynous]] or [[cross-dressing]] presence.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.44; Mitchievici, p.341, 346-347; Teacă, p.55&lt;/ref&gt; To other members of the Știrbey-Vodă circle, painter-designer Alexandru Brătășanu was introduced as Bogdan-Pitești's male lover. Theirs was a "degenerate" affair, according to Oscar Han; Han also quotes Bogdan-Pitești's admiration for the male body, including male genitalia, as the only physical beauties which could withstand time.&lt;ref&gt;Teacă, p.55-56, 58&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cantacuzino Conservative and ''Seara''===
[[File:Seara 1914.JPG|320px|thumb|Title page of ''[[Seara (newspaper)|Seara]]'', with portraits of candidates in the [[Romanian general election, 1914|1914 election]]; [[Grigore Gheorghe Cantacuzino]]'s is first on the left]]

Around 1912, Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești's political influence was on the rise. He had begun associating with an inner faction of the Conservative Party, which had as its leader [[Grigore Gheorghe Cantacuzino]], the [[List of mayors of Bucharest|Mayor of Bucharest]].&lt;ref&gt;Ș. Cioculescu, p.378; Rusu Abrudeanu, p.109&lt;/ref&gt; Afterward, Bogdan-Pitești became the publisher of ''[[Seara (newspaper)|Seara]]'', but was reportedly a front for Cantacuzino, who used him to test the impact of his agenda on the Romanian public.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.94, 191; Mitchievici, p.340-341; Reneti, p.36; Rusu Abrudeanu, p.109-110&lt;/ref&gt; ''Seara''{{'}}s main negative campaign at the time focused on [[Take Ionescu]] and his [[Conservative-Democratic Party|Conservative-Democrats]], who, to Cantacuzino's displeasure, had been co-opted in government by the other mainstream Conservatives.&lt;ref name="bcseful"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Barbu Cioculescu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/din_viaa_lui_mateiu_i._caragiale_eful_de_cabinet "Din viața lui Mateiu I. Caragiale: Șeful de cabinet"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804111040/http://www.romlit.ro/din_viaa_lui_mateiu_i._caragiale_eful_de_cabinet |date=2012-08-04 }}, in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 14/2001&lt;/ref&gt; The paper published gossip columns and lampoons having Ionescu, [[Alexandru Bădărău]] and [[Nicolae Titulescu]] for their main targets.&lt;ref name="bcseful"/&gt;

By then, like many "[[Germanophile]]" Conservatives, Bogdan-Pitești had come to support the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian Kingdom]]'s alliance with the [[German Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]]. This view was popularized by means of his literary club, and support for the [[Central Powers]] was also voiced by Arghezi at ''Seara''.&lt;ref name="zamba"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.94, 147, 191-194; Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.39, 41&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1914, a German consortium purchased the paper (together with Cantacuzino's other gazette, ''Minerva''), and Bogdan-Pitești was kept on as a simple columnist.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.94, 191, 194. See also Reneti, p.36, 38; Rusu Abrudeanu, p.109-110, 487-488&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the interval, Bogdan-Pitești was himself an outspoken Germanophile. His circle, which was already hostile to the National Liberal cabinet of [[Ion I. C. Brătianu]], welcomed the diverse groups who were alarmed by Romania's probable entry into the war: the pro-German Conservatives, the supporters of [[proletarian internationalism]], and the committed [[Pacifism|pacifists]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.39-40&lt;/ref&gt; The artistic clientele was also represented in the Germanophile group at large, but, Cernat's writes, did so for sheer dependency rather than actual convictions.&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.40"&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.40&lt;/ref&gt;

Suspicions soon arose that Bogdan-Pitești had become a veritable [[agent of influence]]. According to Zambaccian, it was Bogdan-Pitești who actually dropped a hint that his support for Germany was a lucrative employment.&lt;ref name="zamba"/&gt; Through various notes in scattered diaries, most of which have been lost, Caragiale reputedly accused Bogdan-Pitești taking Germany's money to promote her interests in Romania, and to assist her foreign [[propaganda]] effort.&lt;ref name="zamba"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.194; Mitchievici, p.340-342; Ș. Cioculescu, p.376&lt;/ref&gt; Such assessments, like Caragiale's allegation that Bogdan-Pitești was not knowledgeable in art, reflected conflicts between the two figures, and their overall reliability remains doubtful.&lt;ref name="cernatbarbu"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Paul Cernat]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/De-la-Barbu-Cioculescu-citire*articleID_15323-articles_details.html "De la Barbu Cioculescu citire"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 319, May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchievici, p.340-343&lt;/ref&gt; It is however possible that Caragiale himself borrowed, and never returned, some 10,000 [[Romanian leu|lei]], siphoned out of the German propaganda funds by Bogdan-Pitești.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.203&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Libertatea'' and propaganda wars===
Between October 1915 and June 1916, Bogdan-Pitești managed another press venue, ''Libertatea'' ("Freedom"). Its political director was retired statesman [[Nicolae Fleva]], later replaced by Arghezi.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.94, 147, 194. See also Rusu Abrudeanu, p.113-114, 485&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1916, Galaction and Arghezi launched ''Cronica'', another review with a pro-German agenda, and which may itself have been published with discreet assistance from Bogdan-Pitești.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.194; Mitchievici, p.339; {{ro icon}} C. Popescu-Cadem, [https://web.archive.org/web/20160306130205/http://www.bibmet.ro/Uploads//3_2011/144350.pdf "Document în replică"], Mihail Sadoveanu City Library, Bucharest, 2007, p.217.  {{ISBN|978-973-8369-21-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Bogdan-Pitești, Domnica and Caragiale paid a mysterious visit to [[Berlin]] in early 1916, they were never listed as foreign spies by [[Siguranța Statului]] [[counter-intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.193, 203&lt;/ref&gt; Bogdan-Pitești's name then surfaced in a February 1916 conversation between German statesman [[Matthias Erzberger]] and [[Raymund Netzhammer]], the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bucharest|Catholic Archbishop of Bucharest]]. Erzberger asked if the Vlaici landowner could ever help advance the Germanophile cause; the Archbishop, a loyal German subject, replied that Bogdan-Pitești was unreliable.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.193&lt;/ref&gt; Allegations later surfaced that Bogdan-Pitești was one of the men receiving payoffs from the German spy Albert E. Günther, manager of ''[[Steaua Română]]'' company. The dossier attesting this was lost, but secondary sources have it that Bogdan-Pitești alone received 840,000 lei from Günther's hands.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.193-194. See also Rusu Abrudeanu, p.485-486&lt;/ref&gt;

The contributors to ''Seara'' and ''Libertatea'' were, in general, outspoken social and cultural critics, with diverse grievances against the establishment. Historian [[Lucian Boia]] argues that, even though Bogdan-Pitești was on the German payroll, his switch from the Francophiles could have been a genuine form of conservatism.&lt;ref name="Boia, p.191-192"&gt;Boia, p.191-192&lt;/ref&gt; Boia thus notes that ''Seara'' was supportive of the Central Powers from the [[Causes of World War I|1914 build-up to the war]], that is even before Cantacuzino had come to decide which side he liked best.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.192&lt;/ref&gt; The core group of ''Seara'' men included socialists of various hues: Arghezi, who claimed that [[Serbian nationalism]] was the spark of the war; [[Felix Aderca]], who depicted the German Empire as the more [[Progressivism|progressive]] belligerent; and [[Avram Steuerman-Rodion|Rodion]], who rendered the complains of Germanophile intellectuals from [[Moldavia]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.120, 134-135, 148-149, 318&lt;/ref&gt; Others were left-wing refugees from the [[Russian Empire]], who wanted Romania to join the Central Powers and help liberate [[Bessarabia]]: [[Alexis Nour]], from the [[Poporanism|Poporanist]] faction, and the old anarchist [[Zamfir Arbore]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.145, 259&lt;/ref&gt; ''Seara'' was also a platform for some disgruntled Romanians from [[Transylvania]] region, a Romanian [[Irredentism|irredenta]] under Austro-Hungarian rule. They included a mainstream Conservative commentator, [[Ilie Bărbulescu (Slavist)|Ilie Bărbulescu]], who advised Romanians to not to focus on Transylvania, and prioritized action against the Russians.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.94-95&lt;/ref&gt; Two distinct voices were those of poet [[Dumitru Karnabatt]], who identified the [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]] with [[Pan-Slavism]] or [[British Empire|British imperialism]]; and [[Ion Gorun]], the Transylvanian writer and [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg loyalist]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.229-230, 240-241&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond politics, ''Seara'' came out with news on culture, selected for publishing by Ion Vinea and poet [[Jacques G. Costin]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.34, 188&lt;/ref&gt;

The left-wing preoccupations were also an important feature of ''Libertatea''. Its opening manifesto called for a large-scale social reform, which it claimed was more important to Romanians than any National Liberal project to recover Transylvania from its Austro-Hungarian overlord.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.94&lt;/ref&gt; It enlisted contributions, generally less political than those at ''Seara'', from literary figures such as Vinea, [[Demostene Botez]], [[I. Dragoslav]], [[Adrian Maniu]] and [[I. C. Vissarion]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.103&lt;/ref&gt;

Bogdan-Pitești regularly published his own articles in the two newspapers he directed, signing them with the pseudonym ''Al. Dodan''. The early texts express his [[Russophobia]] and commiseration over France's alliance with [[Tsarist autocracy]], the world's "most savage, most ignorant and bloodiest oligarchy".&lt;ref name="Boia, p.191-192"/&gt; By 1915, assessing that Romania's national interest rested with the Habsburgs and the Germans, and arguing that Romanian peasants were worse off than their counterparts in Transylvania, he was urging his countrymen to ponder the benefits of Bessarabia's annexation to Romania.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.192-193&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wartime, disgrace and death===
The neutrality years also rekindled controversy over Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești's daily affairs. A scandal erupted in 1913, after banker [[Aristide Blank]] brought Bogdan-Pitești to court on charges of [[blackmail]]. The plaintiff enlisted the services of lawyer [[Take Ionescu]], and the defendant, represented by Fleva,&lt;ref name="abrud114"&gt;Rusu Abrudeanu, p.114&lt;/ref&gt; was ultimately sentenced to a jail term. Throughout the scandal, ''Seara'' hosted articles by Arghezi, professing Bogdan-Pitești's innocence.&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.41"/&gt; In 1916, just before Romania entered the war as an Entente country, Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești was again involved in a legal dispute with the Francophiles Take Ionescu and [[Barbu Ștefănescu-Delavrancea]], with [[Constantin Dissescu]] as his lawyer.&lt;ref name="goga"&gt;[[Octavian Goga]], "1916. Din zilele războiului nostru", in ''[[Magazin Istoric]]'', September 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ententist bid resulted in major initial defeats, and a [[Romania in World War I|Romanian theater of war]] was opened. The country suffered heavily, and Bucharest was taken by the Central Powers. Reputedly, the occupation forces picked up Bogdan-Pitești from his cell at Văcărești, where he was still serving time.&lt;ref name="abrud114"/&gt; Like Arghezi, Macedonski, Galaction and Mateiu Caragiale, he remained in German-occupied territory. Despite his apparent triumph over the Ententist lobby, he kept a low profile: according to popular but unverifiable rumors, he was even arrested once the occupation authorities angrily discovered his uselessness for the cause.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.194-195. See also Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.45&lt;/ref&gt; He was however a free man as of April 12, 1917, the date of his marriage to Domnica Colanoski.&lt;ref name="Teacă, p.58"/&gt; One account has it that Bogdan-Pitești proceeded to denounce his ''Ileana'' colleague, Petrescu Găină, who had published a set of anti-German cartoons. As a result, the Romanian draftsman spent the war years in German captivity.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchievici, p.348-349&lt;/ref&gt;

Once Romania recovered possession over its southern areas, Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești was reportedly prosecuted for treason and was again sent to Văcărești.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.39&lt;/ref&gt; Others however note that this last sentence, passed in 1919, was not in fact related to his wartime dealings, but merely to his fraudulent activities, and that only by coincidence did Bogdan-Pitești share a prison with the convicted [[Collaborationism|collaborationist]] journalists (Arghezi, Karnabatt, [[Ioan Slavici]]).&lt;ref name="Boia, p.342"&gt;Boia, p.342&lt;/ref&gt;

T. Vianu notes that Bogdan-Pitești spent his last years "in ignominy",&lt;ref name="Tudor Vianu, p.370"/&gt; while Cernat describes his definitive fall to the status of "a pariah".&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.41"/&gt; The art promoter died four years after the war ended, at his house in Bucharest, having suffered a [[myocardial infarction]].&lt;ref name="zamba"/&gt; According to Cernat, his "grotesque" death was sudden, catching him in the middle of a telephone conversation.&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.41"/&gt; Reportedly, Bogdan-Pitești's last wish had been for his collection to pass into state property and be kept as a museum.&lt;ref name="zamba"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vmprint"/&gt;

==Legacy==

===Role and influence===
Bogdan-Pitești was the subject of fascination in the literary and artistic community. [[Lucian Boia]] writes about his seductive "legend", which fused an "imaginative and generous intellectual" with a "con artist" who "lived life as he saw fit".&lt;ref name="Boia, p.189"/&gt; Art historian Corina Teacă notes that, like [[Félix Fénéon]], Bogdan-Pitești was in fact fabricating his own myth: "every part of his public image was a removable mask."&lt;ref name="Teacă, p.52-53"/&gt; The art institutions he helped establish were, nevertheless, reputable. According to Paul Cernat, his influential circle was "an excellent medium of transmission for the modern spirit, an informal institution and one of the first coagulant factors for [Romania's] first post-symbolist [[modernism]]."&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.44"&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.44&lt;/ref&gt; Writing earlier, [[Theodor Enescu]] proposed that, like own group, the Știrbey-Vodă Street salon and Macedonski's circle were the only trend-setters active between the decline of ''[[Junimea]]'' society (ca. 1900) and the establishment of the [[modernist literature]] magazine ''[[Sburătorul]]'' (1919).&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.40"/&gt; Cernat additionally notes that, while the writer Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești was "neglectful and improvident" when it came to preserving his own works, those essays and [[Prose poetry|prose poems]] that survived have a genuine value.&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.40"/&gt; Such judgments were also passed on his topical art essays. Art historian [[Petru Comarnescu]] writes that Bogdan-Pitești's "critical intuitions" were superior to those of fellow collectors Zambaccian and [[Ioan Kalinderu]];&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.45"&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.45&lt;/ref&gt; critic Nicolae Oprescu also assesses that, without Bogdan-Pitești, [[Ștefan Luchian]] would be lost to Romanian art.&lt;ref name="gr79"/&gt;

The Romanian art environment cherished, then despised, its anarchist patron. In his moments of glory, he received homages from many of his writer friends, as notebooks and albums compiled especially for him.&lt;ref name="Teacă, p.58"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cuiubirip"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Cornel Ungureanu]], [http://www.revistaorizont.ro/arhiva/mai2007.pdf "Ion Vinea și iubirile paralele ale poeților"], in ''[[Orizont]]'', Nr. 5/2007, p.2&lt;/ref&gt; At a later date, all sides of the dispute were united in expressing criticism for at least some of Bogdan-Pitești's deeds. According to Galaction, he was a "[[hajduk]]", who "robbed away and gave away."&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.190&lt;/ref&gt; Zambaccian portrayed him as one "created from a mold in which the evil and the good genius were present in equal measure. [...] Cynical and suave, generous on one side, a con artist on the other, Al. Bogdan-Pitești relished the abjection that he served with cynicism".&lt;ref name="zamba"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Teacă, p.57"/&gt; As Teacă notes, both Zambaccian and sculptor [[Oscar Han]] were among those forever "seduced" by Bogdan-Pitești's duplicity.&lt;ref name="Teacă, p.54"/&gt; In 1970, Han wrote: "we cannot judge [him] under common law. He remains an absurdity."&lt;ref name="Teacă, p.57"/&gt; While nationalist journalist [[Pamfil Șeicaru]] dismissed him as "a scoundrel", Macedonski argued that Bogdan-Pitești was "a wonderful prose writer and an admirable poet".&lt;ref name="coroiu"/&gt; [[Benjamin Fondane]], the modernist poet-philosopher, praised Bogdan-Pitești as a man of exquisite taste, concluding that: "He was made of the greatest of joys, in the most purulent of bodies. How many generations of ancient boyars had come to pass, like unworthy dung, for this singular earth to be generated?"&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.44; Mitchievici, p.356&lt;/ref&gt;

Writer and critic [[Eugen Lovinescu]], also a modernist, was bitterly opposed to the views of Bogdan-Pitești and most other intellectuals who sided with Germany: in 1922, he published the article ''Revizuiri morale'' ("Moral Revisions"), which reminded the public about the controversy surrounding the art collector and his associates (Arghezi, [[N. D. Cocea]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.39; Mitchievici, p.356&lt;/ref&gt; A socialist acquaintance and an oral historian, [[Constantin Bacalbașa]] was convinced that Bogdan-Pitești was the prototype "inferior degenerate" and, in his political life, a manipulator of "the uncultured minds."&lt;ref&gt;Mitchievici, p.338&lt;/ref&gt; Retrospective criticism of Bogdan-Pitești was also voiced by Comarnescu and co-author [[Ionel Jianu]]. Although they pay homage to Bogdan-Pitești's artistic qualities, the two speak of his "reproachable faults" and "con artist coups", finding in him "an exhibitionist determined to trick and scandalize", or an "''[[L'enfant terrible|enfant terrible]]''".&lt;ref&gt;Jianu &amp; Comarnescu, p.34-35&lt;/ref&gt;

Commentators have been tempted to compare Bogdan-Pitești with some controversial characters in world history, most often the prototype of self-seekers, [[Alcibiades]].&lt;ref name="zamba"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.44; Mitchievici, p.355; Teacă, p.54&lt;/ref&gt; Others likened Bogdan-Pitești to the [[Renaissance]] writer and notorious blackmailer [[Pietro Aretino]] (Zambaccian stresses that, unlike Aretino, Bogdan-Pitești never duped his artists).&lt;ref name="zamba"/&gt; Comarnescu proposed that Bogdan-Pitești and the equally controversial Arghezi were better understood through the logic of [[Hinduism]] ("the ancient Indian ethics"): "good and evil are not opposed, but collocated, combined, in a state of confusion".&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.44"/&gt; Taking in view Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești's preference for [[orality]], his shady political connections, and his mostly informal channels of influence, Cernat concluded that, "the necessary changes having been made", one could compare Bogdan-Pitești with [[Nae Ionescu]], a philosopher and [[far right]] activist whose career spanned the [[interwar period]], and who had also debuted as a Symbolist.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.40-41&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anecdotes===
[[File:NSPetrescuGaina - Alexandru Bogdan-Pitesti.jpg|thumb|230px|Caricature of Bogdan-Pitești looking over nudes, dressed in [[cassock]] ([[Nicolae Petrescu-Găină]], 1913)]]
Several anecdotes concerning Bogdan-Pitești's morals and extravagant lifestyle were in circulation from his lifetime. In 1912, Macedonski published an autobiographical Christmas story. It tells how, inspired by Macedonski's desire to feed his family a traditional turkey feast, Bogdan-Pitești sent him the bird stuffed with 50 gold [[Romanian leu|lei]].&lt;ref name="Tudor Vianu, p.370"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zamba"/&gt; As T. Vianu writes, such "attitudes of a grand feudal lord" made Bogdan-Pitești into an "indisputably picturesque" person.&lt;ref name="Tudor Vianu, p.370"/&gt; The account was partly confirmed by Constantin Beldie, who also noted that, during those years, Alexandru Macedonski was "starving" and had to provide for "a house full of children".&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.45"/&gt; Zambaccian however cites a contrasting story once told by actor [[Ion Iancovescu]]. It suggests that, during the wartime famine, Macedonski asked Bogdan-Pitești to pay him 1&amp;nbsp;million lei for one of the few surviving copies of ''Bronzes''; Bogdan-Pitești bluntly offered him 5 lei—Macedonski gave in, commenting that "he is capable of changing his mind, that con artist!"&lt;ref name="zamba"/&gt; Bogdan-Pitești's mood swings were also discussed by memoirist [[Radu D. Rosetti]]. He writes that the boyar scarcely minded when his fortune was being siphoned away by some members of his retinue, but that he publicly humiliated Galaction, and even Domnica, over random expenses.&lt;ref name="svalintari"/&gt;

The relationship between Mateiu Caragiale and his one-time patron has attracted special interest from period historians. Early on, the aspiring poet wrote a special piece in honor of his senior friend—called ''Dregătorul'' ("The Mandarin"), it is included in one of Bogdan-Pitești's albums.&lt;ref name="Teacă, p.58"/&gt; That accord degenerated during the late 1910s, to the point where Caragiale, whose diary spoke of Bogdan-Pitești's homosexuality in dismissive terms (calling him "a blusterer of the anti-natural vice"), laid out a plan to loot the Știrbey-Vodă Street villa.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchievici, p.340, 341-342; {{ro icon}} [[Ion Vianu]], [http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?art=2636&amp;nr=2006-04-11 "O plimbare pe Strada Matei Caragiale"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070921184807/http://www.revista22.ro/html/index.php?art=2636&amp;nr=2006-04-11 |date=2007-09-21 }}, in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 840, April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; According to the same author, Bogdan-Pitești turned to passive homosexuality because he was impotent.&lt;ref&gt;Teacă, p.55, 58&lt;/ref&gt; Caragiale's diary also sketched a portrait of Domnica Bogdan, questioning her morality in harsh terms.&lt;ref name="aonarco5"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.198, 203; Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.44; Mitchievici, p.340, 341&lt;/ref&gt;

Bogdan-Pitești's other relationships with his other protégés could also fluctuate between extremes. According to an anecdote of the time, he advanced Luchian a large sum of money, which the painter used for a trip to [[Sinaia]]. Luchian then upset Bogdan-Pitești by not inviting him over, and was punished with a telegram addressed "To the ugliest tourist in Sinaia" (a pun on Luchian's proverbial bad looks).&lt;ref&gt;Ș. Cioculescu, p.114-115&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1910s, Luchian had been incapacitated by [[multiple sclerosis]]. Bogdan-Pitești was one of the last to visit him before his death in June 1916, recording for posterity Luchian's resigned remark: "I'm going away".&lt;ref&gt;Lassaigne &amp; Enescu, p.90&lt;/ref&gt;

The main first-hand account of Bogdan-Pitești's 1919 imprisonment comes from [[Ioan Slavici]]'s ''Închisorile mele'' ("My Prisons"). According to Slavici, the art patron had a luxury cell with a view over Bucharest.&lt;ref name="Boia, p.342"/&gt; [[Alexandru Rosetti]], citing Arghezi, records one of Bogdan-Pitești's witticisms on the issue of prison life. When a [[Jandarmeria Română|Gendarme]] wrongly attempted to push him into Arghezi's line of suspected traitors, Bogdan-Pitești snapped: ''Pardon, eu sunt escroc!'' ("Pardon me, [but] I'm a con artist!").&lt;ref name="rosettiargh"/&gt; Zambaccian writes that, during the first of his legal battles with [[Take Ionescu]], Bogdan-Pitești commented on Ionescu's deposition: "He sure is talented, that crook!"&lt;ref name="zamba"/&gt; The pro-Entente nationalist [[Octavian Goga]] was especially upset by Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești's stances, and, in his record of 1916 events (including the Ionescu trial), wrote him off as a "bandit" fed with "German money".&lt;ref name="goga"/&gt;

===Fictional character===
After the World War, according to Beldie, actor Iancovescu introduced impressions of Bogdan-Pitești to his cabaret routine. It showed the convicted Garmanophile and an unnamed German official, who looked into the mislanding of propaganda funds on supporting petty "henchmen". To this charge, the fictional Bogdan-Pitești replies: "I have consumed your money, this much is true, but I did not pull one on you! For how is it that you could imagine me, a traitor of my country, not also being a con artist?"&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.45"/&gt; According to Beldie, the account has a grain of truth: instead of using money to revive the Germanophile cause, Bogdan-Pitești directed them into his art collection.&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.45"/&gt; A somewhat similar version of this urban legend is included in the memoirs of a National Liberal adversary, [[I. G. Duca]], who sees Bogdan-Pitești's retort as a paradoxical sign of injured [[patriotism]]: "Did you perhaps think that you might buy off some of Romania's honest people? You would be dead wrong, in this land one can only buy off the con artists, only con artists such as myself."&lt;ref name="Boia, p.195"&gt;Boia, p.195&lt;/ref&gt; Duca concludes: "this reply, with its admirable and atavistic national dignity, tempts me to forget, though not to forgive, the utter turpitude that we call Bogdan-Pitești's life."&lt;ref name="Boia, p.195"/&gt;

Despite their relationship having declined from friendship to hatred, Bogdan-Pitești's style and his mundane interests are occasionally seen as sources of inspiration for Caragiale's only novel, ''[[Craii de Curtea-Veche]]'' (completed in 1928).&lt;ref name="cernatbarbu"/&gt; Some have noted that Bogdan-Pitești has a lot in common with at least one of the three protagonists.&lt;ref name="aonarco5"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchievici, p.341&lt;/ref&gt; He and his wife were both characters in [[Ion Vinea]]'s novels ''Venin de mai'' ("May Venom") and ''Lunatecii'' ("The Lunatics")—Alexandru as Adam Gună, Domnica as wife Iada Gună.&lt;ref name="aonarco5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cuiubirip"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.41, 43; Mitchievici, p.339, 343, 344-351, 354&lt;/ref&gt; Both novels portray the Bogdans' cultural circle, allude to their influence in making young people reject all conventionalism, and show them promoting vice as virtue.&lt;ref name="cuiubirip"/&gt; This lifestyle has taken its toll on Adam Gună, who is a physical ruin and slowly loses his hold on reality.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchievici, p.345-348&lt;/ref&gt; Vinea's books repeat claims that Bogdan-Pitești was abusing drugs,&lt;ref name="aonarco5"/&gt; and that Domnica was originally a prostitute.&lt;ref name="cuiubirip"/&gt;

More fiction work dealing with the Bogdan-Pitești circle was published from a casual contributor to ''Seara'', [[Lucrezzia Karnabatt]]. In her 1922 novel, ''Demoniaca'', she portrays her employer as "Basile Dan", a sinister traitor of his country and a cynical pornographer.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchievici, p.340-341, 351-354, 355, 497&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ion Călugăru]] used Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești as the inspiration for "[[Alexandru Lăpușneanu]]", the boyar character in his novel ''Don Juan Cocoșatul'' ("[[Don Juan]] the Hunchback").&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.41; Mitchievici, p.339, 343-344, 354&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="calinescu"&gt;[[George Călinescu]], ''Istoria literaturii române de la origini până în prezent'', [[Editura Minerva]], Bucharest, 1986, p.796&lt;/ref&gt; Literary historian [[George Călinescu]] notes that this fictional portrait shows: "The dignity in gossip, the boyar carriage, the refinement that the apparent vulgarity cannot bring to ruin, the blasé and cynical lechery [...]."&lt;ref name="calinescu"/&gt; In one episode in the book, Lăpușneanu simulates agony and receives a Catholic [[Confession (religion)|confession]] that (he insists) must be read in Latin instead of French; elsewhere, Lăpușneanu's eccentric and adulterous wife Fetița ("Little Girl") shows up on a battlefield, wearing nothing more than a [[swimsuit]].&lt;ref name="calinescu"/&gt;

Tudor Arghezi dedicated Bogdan-Pitești some of his first poetry writings.&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.41"/&gt; As art critics, Arghezi and [[Theodor Cornel]] published a comprehensive biographical study on their patron (part of their ''Figuri contimporane din România'' dictionary, 1909).&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p.189. See also Teacă, p.51, 52, 56&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to Corina Teacă, the encomium-like and conveniently imprecise entry may have been sent in, or at least approved of, by Bogdan-Pitești.&lt;ref&gt;Teacă, p.51-52&lt;/ref&gt; Arghezi also made his sponsor the hero of a small eponymous poem, wherein he is called ''Lombard bastard cu ochi de rouă'' ("bastard [[Lombards|Lombard]] with the eyes of dew").&lt;ref name="zamba"/&gt;

===Collection and estate===
[[File:Stefan Luchian - Lautul.jpg|thumb|[[Ștefan Luchian]]'s ''Lăutul'' ("Washing the Hair"), one of the best known paintings in Bogdan-Pitești's collection]]

By the 1910s, Bogdan-Pitești's art interests gave birth to a collection of as few as 967&lt;ref name="sandamiller"/&gt; or as many as 1,500 individual works,&lt;ref name="vmvlaici"/&gt; most of them hosted by his estate in [[Colonești, Olt|Colonești]]. They comprised objects created by prominent Romanian visual artists, including, alongside his early associates, [[Nina Arbore]], [[Constantin Brâncuși]], [[Oscar Han]], [[Aurel Jiquidi]], [[Maria Ciurdea Steurer]], [[Constantin Medrea]], [[Ary Murnu]], [[Dimitrie Paciurea]], [[Nicolae Petrescu-Găină]], [[Alexandru Satmari]], [[Francisc Șirato]], [[Cecilia Cuțescu-Storck]], [[Jean Alexandru Steriadi]], [[Friedrich Storck]], [[Ion Theodorescu-Sion]], and [[Nicolae Tonitza]].&lt;ref name="zamba"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vmprint"/&gt; Of the total, around 900 works were of Romanian provenance.&lt;ref name="vmprint"/&gt; Among the foreign artists whose work was featured in the collection were [[Georges Rochegrosse]] and [[Frank Brangwyn]].&lt;ref name="zamba"/&gt; The section dedicated to newer works of art was designed and opened as the first the [[modern art]] museum in Romania.&lt;ref name="vmprint"/&gt;

The Bogdan-Pitești trust included many samples of Luchian's art. Two of his famous paintings featured there were ''Lăutul'' ("Washing the Hair")—which Bogdan-Pitești is said to have likened to the luminous oil paintings of [[Paolo Veronese]],&lt;ref name="zamba"/&gt; and ''Safta Florăreasa'' ("Safta the Flower Girl")—originally part of the Luchian family collection.&lt;ref name="Lassaigne &amp; Enescu, p.110"/&gt; Also included was the 1907 oil portrait of Luchian's cousin, ''Alecu Literatu'' ("Alecu the Literary Man").&lt;ref name="Lassaigne &amp; Enescu, p.112"&gt;Lassaigne &amp; Enescu, p.112&lt;/ref&gt; They were accompanied by the 1906 [[pastel]] ''Durerea'' ("Pain"), which had been reproduced in a 1914 issue of ''[[Seara (newspaper)|Seara]]'', and by the paintings ''De Nămezi'' ("Lunchtime") and ''Lica, fetița cu portocala'' ("Lica, the Girl with the Orange").&lt;ref&gt;Lassaigne &amp; Enescu, p.112, 115&lt;/ref&gt; Among the works in the series were two portraits of Bogdan-Pitești: an ink drawing, copies of which were circulated with Bogdan-Pitești's election manifesto of 1899, and a since-lost oil painting.&lt;ref&gt;Lassaigne &amp; Enescu, p.28, 110&lt;/ref&gt;

Bogdan-Pitești was the subject of several anonymous sketches, including two 1896 vignettes, published in ''[[Adevărul]]'', and a 1917 drawing signed ''[[Correggio]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ionescu, ''Mișcarea...'', p.226, 231, 233&lt;/ref&gt; He is also depicted in an affectionate cartoon published in 1914 by Petrescu Găină.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Rezeanu, "Caricaturistul N.S. Petrescu-Găină", in ''[[Magazin Istoric]]'', August 2008, p.62&lt;/ref&gt; Domnica Bogdan herself sat as a model for various artists, and was notably depicted in works by Camil Ressu, Pallady and the Bulgarian-born painter [[Pascin]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.44; Mitchievici, p.356-357&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, Bogdan-Pitești commissioned Paciurea to complete a [[Bust (sculpture)|portrait bust]] of Domnica.&lt;ref name="sandamiller"/&gt; The same year, Dimitrescu painted her an oil-on-cardboard portrait in dominant shades of brown (with touches of red and gray).&lt;ref&gt;Claudiu Paradaiser, ''Ștefan Dimitrescu, monografie'', [[Editura Meridiane]], Bucharest, 1978, p.15, 37, 42. {{OCLC|4807364}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists who illustrated works by Bogdan-Pitești include, in addition to himself, [[George Demetrescu Mirea]], [[Ion Georgescu]] and Satmari.&lt;ref name="Jianu &amp; Comarnescu, p.35"/&gt;

The Colonești manor and its art fund fell victim to neglect. According to T. Vianu, the collection was "blown over by the wind of devastation" even during the interwar years.&lt;ref name="Tudor Vianu, p.370"/&gt; In 1924, in defiance of its owner's final request, it was subject to a hasty [[public auction]].&lt;ref name="vmprint"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jianu &amp; Comarnescu, p.88; Lassaigne &amp; Enescu, p.110; Teacă, p.57&lt;/ref&gt; This drew protests from literary figures such as [[Cezar Petrescu]],&lt;ref name="vmprint"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jianu &amp; Comarnescu, p.88"&gt;Jianu &amp; Comarnescu, p.88&lt;/ref&gt; [[Perpessicius]] and [[Victor Eftimiu]].&lt;ref name="vmprint"/&gt; As a result of the auction, many works passed into the collections of Zambaccian, [[Alexandru G. Florescu]], [[Iosif Dona]] and several others.&lt;ref name="vmprint"/&gt; Of them, Zambaccian attributed the incident to the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal]] government's unwillingness to accept donations from "a compromised person".&lt;ref name="zamba"/&gt; He and several other commentators place responsibility for the sales on [[Ministry of Public Finance (Romania)|Finance Minister]] [[Ion Lapedatu]], who is believed to have either hesitated in assessing the collection&lt;ref name="zamba"/&gt; or to have plotted with businessmen who wanted it sold cheaply.&lt;ref name="Jianu &amp; Comarnescu, p.88"/&gt; Zambaccian was to be the eventual owner of ''Lăutul''. It became a feature of his own [[Zambaccian Museum|Bucharest museum]], and appears with Zambaccian in an oil portrait by Pallady.&lt;ref&gt;Lassaigne &amp; Enescu, p.115&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]], the Vlaici building was transformed into a branch for the state-owned producer of agricultural machinery, and, in 2004, belonged to its successor, [[Agromec]] (although still largely unused).&lt;ref name="vmvlaici"/&gt; Beldie recounts that, under communism, the destitute Domnica Bogdan worked as a hygienist at Bucharest Central Hospital.&lt;ref name="Cernat, p.43"/&gt;

[[File:Aston Science Park.jpg|thumb|right|Aston Science Park]]

'''Birmingham Science Park Aston''',&lt;ref name="bsp-a.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsp-a.com/ |title=Birmingham Science Park Aston |work=bsp-a.com |accessdate=15 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150617213219/http://www.bsp-a.com/ |archivedate=17 June 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; formerly known as '''Aston Science Park''', is a [[science park]] located in [[Birmingham City Centre]], [[United Kingdom]]. It is located adjacent to [[Aston University]] and the [[Eastside, Birmingham|Eastside]] area.

==Description==
[[Birmingham]] [[Science Park]] [[Aston]] (BSPA) was founded in 1982 and as such is the UK’s third oldest [[science park]]. Located in its urban setting within central [[Birmingham]], it offers 250,000 [[sq ft]] of accommodation over 14 [[acres]].

==Two campuses==
BSPA is wholly owned by [[Birmingham City Council]]. To give the Park a new dimension, provide clarity and pave the way for a £35 million development zone, it is now presented as two campuses; the Science &amp; Technology Campus and the Innovation Birmingham Campus.&lt;ref name="innovationbham.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.innovationbham.com/|title=Innovation Birmingham Campus, Innovation Birmingham, Birmingham Science Park Aston|work=innovationbham.com|accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Science &amp; Technology Campus===
The Science &amp; Technology Campus encompasses a range of multi-occupied and headquarters style single occupancy buildings owned by [[Birmingham City Council]] and serviced by the Innovation Birmingham team. The Innovation Birmingham Campus&lt;ref name="innovationbham.com"/&gt; is working in partnership with a wide range of stakeholders to help shape the [[Smart Cities]] agenda and drive innovation-led regeneration across [[West Midlands conurbation|Greater Birmingham]]. Faraday Wharf &lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Birmingham+Science+Park+Aston+Faraday+Wharf,+Aston+University,+Holt+St,+Birmingham,+West+Midlands+B7+4BB/@52.488656,-1.8872211,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x4870bc9c7454707d:0x832b70a6b2e2f9ff|title=Birmingham Science Park Aston Faraday Wharf, Aston University, Holt St, Birmingham, West Midlands B7 4BB - Google Maps|work=google.co.uk|accessdate=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; - the [[flagship]] building on the campus - incorporates 70 office suites specifically designed for growing technology businesses.

===The Innovation Birmingham Campus===
The Innovation Birmingham team&lt;ref name="innovationbham.com"/&gt; is actively looking to work with and bring together the [[public sector]] and [[private sector]], creating interfaces for people with ideas, people with technologies, people with expertise and experience, and people with money. It is a one-stop-shop for [[innovators]], [[entrepreneurs]] and [[investors]] looking to develop or fund tech start-ups &lt;ref name="e4f.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://e4f.co.uk/startups/|title=e4f.Incubator – entrepreneurs for the future -   Startups - Birmingham’s leading technology start-up location|work=e4f.co.uk|accessdate=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with high growth potential.

====The Innovation Birmingham strategy====
The Innovation Birmingham&lt;ref name="innovationbham.com"/&gt; strategy is focused on a service offering for founders of new technology ventures, as well as more established tech businesses. The campus facilities include the Entrepreneurs for the Future (e4f)&lt;ref name="e4f.co.uk1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://e4f.co.uk/|title=e4f.Incubator – entrepreneurs for the future|work=e4f.co.uk|accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; multi-occupancy start-up centre with [[hot-desking]] facilities and a wide range of flexible office units (115-4,000 sq ft) within the rest of Faraday Wharf.&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt; However, the campus is far from just bricks and mortar; the team actively nurtures an interactive and supportive community within the place. 
The Campus strategy is about encouraging people to visit, engage with the businesses based there, and attract new tenants to join the thriving tech community. By creating a wide range of valuable opportunities, the missing aspects of a successful business puzzle can be resolved, helping [[innovators]] and tech [[entrepreneurs]] gain invaluable exposure and to succeed.

====Innovation Birmingham Campus Membership====
For technology companies that are a little more established, or not suitable for a structured support programme, Innovation Birmingham also offers Membership packages. Members instantly become part of the community and gain access to a range of additional services and opportunities designed to accelerate the development of their business. There are a variety of different packages to suit the flexible requirements and budget of a growing tech company.

===Entrepreneurs for the Future centre (e4f)===
This ERDF supported incubation centre is specifically focused on creating new innovative technology ventures. It provides a flexible, highly connected and collaborative environment to [[wikt:fast track|fast-track]] the development and growth of tech start-ups. As the companies grow, they are then able to graduate into larger premises within Faraday Wharf, or elsewhere on the [[Science Park]]. Since establishing in November 2009, e4f has supported the creation of over 100 new technology companies.

The objective of the e4f&lt;ref name="e4f.co.uk1"/&gt; programme is to diversify the region’s economy through the incubation of innovative tech start-ups, creating new high-value jobs and so retaining more of the city’s talented graduate population. Start-ups in the e4f incubator benefit from an initial nine months free access to a dynamic co-working centre, with full [[Information and communication technologies|ICT]] support and meeting facilities. This includes free access to the Ideas and Communications Suite, which houses state-of-the-art [[Cisco]] [[video conferencing]] equipment, together with other interactive technology.

In addition to free use of the facilities, e4f provides [[mentoring]] and support services - specific to tech start-ups - based on regional, national and international networks. Entrepreneurs in Residence provide personalised support to each start-up &lt;ref name="e4f.co.uk"/&gt; and direct access to the most appropriate expertise and experience to drive development of the fledgling businesses. ‘Visiting expert’ sessions also help to ensure that the entrepreneurs have all they need to launch, develop and grow.

Within the first nine months of being enrolled onto e4f, the Innovation Birmingham &lt;ref name="innovationbham.com"/&gt; team and mentor base works with the new business founders to create a value proposition, assisting with the process of becoming revenue generating and/or securing investment funding. Start-ups in e4f can take advantage of well-established links with funds such as Finance Birmingham’s Tech Fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.financebirmingham.com/blog/2015/02/12/finance-birmingham-partners-with-expert-tech-fund-to-boost-local-firms-growth/|title=Finance Birmingham partners with expert tech fund to boost local firms’ growth|work=financebirmingham.com|accessdate=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==West Midlands Regional Innovation Centre==
A new regional hub funded by Climate-KIC &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.innovationbham.com/climate-kic/ |title=Climate KIC - West Midlands Regional Innovation Centre (RIC) - Innovation Birmingham |work=innovationbham.com |accessdate=April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416160916/http://www.innovationbham.com/climate-kic/ |archivedate=2015-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; – Europe’s largest public-private partnership focused on tackling [[climate change]] – was launched by Innovation Birmingham &lt;ref name="innovationbham.com"/&gt; in 2014. The West Midlands Regional Innovation Centre receives in excess of €2 million of funding per annum, spread across a number of local initiatives. Innovation Birmingham has created 10 new jobs to run the Centre.

The Centre’s main initiatives are; Pioneers into Practice – a grant-funded European exchange programme for low carbon specialists; the Low Carbon Accelerator Programme for [[startup company|start-up]] businesses; and a range of grant-funded education programmes aimed at students, professionals and organisations.

==Cisco’s National Virtual Incubator==
Innovation Birmingham is a founding node in this pioneering network, which connects business incubation centres and research institutions around the UK via state-of-the-art [[Cisco]] [[video conferencing]] technology.

Mentoring sessions and multi-location live events are being delivered across the NVI network, enabling initial introductions and follow up meetings to take place irrespective of geography. The [[high-definition video|high-definition]] quality available through Cisco’s video conferencing equipment ensures valuable ‘[[face time]]’ can be orchestrated without the need for costly and time-sapping travel.

== LAUNCH ==

Over 20 gaming companies have already been nurtured in the e4f centre,&lt;ref name="e4f.co.uk1"/&gt; with many more established studios relocating to the Innovation Birmingham Campus&lt;ref name="innovationbham.com"/&gt; over recent years.

The Innovation Birmingham team run a year-round programme of events for those working in the gaming or mobile app industries. The events are also targeted at students, graduates and anyone looking to launch a career in gaming.

There are at least seven LAUNCH&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.innovationbham.com/event/launch-presents-marmalade-hosted-by-bluegfx-2/|title=LAUNCH Presents: Marmalade hosted by bluegfx |publisher= Innovation Birmingham| accessdate=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; events per year, with speakers drawn from gaming companies, such as [[Codemasters]], [[Microsoft]], [[Playground Games]], [[Rebellion Developments]] and [[Vodafone Games]].

Innovation Birmingham has invested in [[infrastructure]] to increase its broadband connectivity to 30[[Gbit]]/s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} This ensures each tenant can have a dedicated, resilient broadband connection of up to 100[[Mbit]]/s. The super-fast broadband service is powered by WarwickNet;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warwicknet.com/|title=WarwickNet|work=WarwickNet|accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a specialist business and [science park] [Internet Service Provider]. WarwickNet has installed three lines separately routed from [[London]] and [[Manchester]].

==£35 million development zone==
The £35 million development zone will enable significant expansion of the Innovation Birmingham Campus.&lt;ref name="innovationbham.com"/&gt; The two [[acre]] plot is situated next to Faraday Wharf, at the gateway to the Eastside knowledge quarter. It is accessed off Holt Street and [[A38(M) motorway|A38 Aston Expressway]]. The site is one of 26 covered by [[West Midlands conurbation|Greater Birmingham]] and [[Solihull]] LEP’s [[Enterprise Zone]]. The collection of buildings will be among the first within the Enterprise Zone to get underway, enabling future occupiers to benefit from Business Rates relief.

Innovation Birmingham is developing the new buildings in partnership with [[Stourport-on-Severn]] headquartered Thomas Vale Construction Ltd,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thomasvale.com/|title=Home Page - Thomas Vale|work=thomasvale.com|accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is part of one of the world’s leading construction groups, Bouygues Construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bouygues-construction.com/en|title=Bouygues Construction|work=Bouygues Construction|accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Three to five buildings are proposed in total, delivering 11,500 [[Square metre|sq m]] (120,000 [[sq ft]]) of new space for [[Birmingham]]’s tech community.

==iCentrumTM==
The first phase of the development zone will be the delivery of the £8 million iCentrumTM &lt;ref name="innovationbham1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.innovationbham.com/office-space/icentrum-development/ |title=Office developments in Birmingham, Digital Plaza - Innovation Birmingham |work=innovationbham.com |accessdate=April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416221649/http://www.innovationbham.com/office-space/icentrum-development/ |archivedate=2015-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; building. It will encompass 3,874 [[Square metre|sq m]] (41,700 [[sq ft]]) of open work space promoting mobile working, a new Serendip incubator offering, [[self-contained]] offices, tech demonstration and event facilities and a café. The building is being developed speculatively and will be available for occupation in March 2016.

In addition to flexible office space, a wider membership offering will be provided at iCentrumTM, promoting a cross-sector innovation exchange to generate new products and services across [[West Midlands conurbation|Greater Birmingham]]’s enterprise community.  
iCentrumTM will bring together agile and smart working environments with the business incubator culture, creating a statement facility that will enable [[Birmingham]] to reach out to the world.

===Serendip incubator ===
A new tech incubator concept will be delivered within the iCentrumTM building, called "Serendip".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.innovationbham.com/event/get-the-inside-track-on-innovation-birminghams-icentrum-development/|title=Get the inside track on Innovation Birmingham’s iCentrum development - Innovation Birmingham|work=innovationbham.com|accessdate=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It will promote unique collaborations across sectors, supported by corporate mentors from: [[Built Environment]]; [[Internet of Things]]; Intelligent Mobility;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://connect.innovateuk.org/web/intelligent-mobility|title=Intelligent Mobility - innovateuk|work=innovateuk.org|accessdate=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [Digital Health].

This new concept in incubation will ensure iCentrumTM &lt;ref name="innovationbham1"/&gt; is a lighthouse, promoting and driving [[Birmingham]]’s [[Smart City]] agenda. The Serendip space will strike a balance between order and chaos, with proactive and energetic management used to catalyse interaction between start-ups,&lt;ref name="e4f.co.uk"/&gt; [[Subject-matter expert|SMEs]], public sector organisations and large corporates to drive delivery of innovative new products and services.

==History==
Birmingham Science Park Aston&lt;ref name="bsp-a.com"/&gt; is owned by Birmingham Technology Ltd., which was jointly owned by Lloyds TSB,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lloydsbank.com/&lt;/ref&gt; Birmingham City Council&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/|title=Birmingham City Council|work=birmingham.gov.uk|accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Aston University,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aston.ac.uk/|title=Aston University - The UK's leading university for business and employability.|work=aston.ac.uk|accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; until 2008. During 2008 there was restructuring, and the science park is now wholly owned by Birmingham City Council. Aston University continue to sit on the board and provide services such as management support and [[equity (finance)|equity]] capital to firms at the [[science park]]. The science park was opened in 1983 and was designed to overcome the reluctance of London-based firms to invest outside of [[South East England]].

The first building to be opened was the Business and Innovation Centre, in 1983 by [[Prince Philip]], [[Duke of Edinburgh]]. The building was refurbished in 1994. Within one year, there were fifteen companies on site and ten years later, there were 80 companies on site. By 2001, there were 1,400 employees and 110 companies on site. Visitors to the site included then-[[Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] in 1985, [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent]] in the same year, [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] in 1988, [[European Commissioner]] [[Bruce Milan]] in 1989, [[Jeremy Morse]] in 1990, Chairman of the TSB Group Plc. [[Nicholas Goodison]] in 1992, [[Patricia Hewitt]] in 2001, [[Digby Jones]], [[Frederick Crawford (professor)|Frederick Crawford]] and former [[Polish Prime Minister]] [[Jerzy Buzek]].

==Access==

The Science Park is near the end of the [[A38(M) motorway]] - which takes traffic from the [[M6 motorway|M6]] into [[Birmingham City Centre]]. It is located alongside the [[A4540 road]], on a site adjacent to the [[Aston University]] campus and the [[Eastside, Birmingham|Eastside]] area. The [[Digbeth Branch Canal]] runs through it.

'''Bulgari''' S.p.A ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ʊ|l|g|ər|i}}, {{IPA-it|ˈbulɡari|lang}}; [[stylized]] as '''BVLGARI''') is an Italian luxury brand known for its [[jewelry]], [[Watch|watches]], [[Aroma compound|fragrances]], [[Fashion accessory|accessories]] and [[Leather|leather goods]]. 

While the majority of design, production and marketing is overseen and executed by Bvlgari, the company does, at times, partner with other entities. For example, Bvlgari eyewear is produced through a [[License|licensing agreement]] with [[Luxottica]], and, in 2001, the brand formed a [[joint venture]] with Group [[Marriott International]] to launch its hotel brand, Bvlgari Hotels &amp; Resorts, a collection of properties and resort destinations around the world. 

Currently part of the [[LVMH|LVMH Group]], Bvlgari was founded in Rome in 1884 by the [[silversmith]] Sotirios Voulgaris (Italian: Sotirio Bulgari) as a single jewellery shop that has, over the years, become an international brand. The company has evolved into a player in the luxury market, with an established and growing network of stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2001/02/13/europe/bulgari/|title=Head of Italian luxury goods firm says new hotel venture will boost profits|last=|first=|date=February 13, 2011|website=CNN|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The [[trademark]] is usually written BVLGARI in the classical [[Latin alphabet]], and is derived from the [[surname]] of the company's founder Sotirios Voulgaris (1857-1932, {{lang-el|Σωτήριος Βούλγαρης}}, {{IPA-el|soˈtirʝos ˈvulɣaris|pron}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bulgari|url=http://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/brands/bulgari/}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The root of the surname [[Voulgaris]] is [[:wikt:Βούλγαρος|Βούλγαρ]] (''Voulgar''), which in [[Greek language|Greek]] translates as "Bulgarian".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bulgari|url=http://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/brands/bulgari/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy he changed it to Bulgari, which although different, further emphasizes the same meaning and translates as  "Bulgarians" or people of Bulgarian descent in [[Italian language|Italian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bulgari|url=http://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/brands/bulgari/}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==The Bvlgari logo==
The BVLGARI logo was used for the first time in 1934, when its gilded brass letters graced the central doorway of the [[Via Condotti]] flagship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.museodelmarchioitaliano.com/route1/bulgari.php|title=The Bulgari logo|last=|first=|date=|website=Museo Del Marchio Italiano|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reference to [[ancient Rome]], the “U” was replaced with the letter “V”, and a logo was born. Since then, the [[trademark]] is written BVLGARI in the classical [[Latin alphabet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bulgari|url=http://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/brands/bulgari/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=BVLGARI|last=Amanda Triossi and Daniela Mascetti|first=|publisher=Electa|year=2009|isbn=9788837064921|location=Milan|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

=== From its origins through the 1940s ===
The Voulgaris were a silversmithing family from the [[Epirus]] region of [[Ottoman Greece]]. Whether or not the [[Voulgaris]] family of [[Corfu]] and the Voulgaris family of the Italian jewelers Bulgari from [[Epirus]] share the same paternal line is unclear, but the count Stefanos Voulgaris denied that the Bulgari family of the Italian jewelers family is genealogically related to the Voulgaris family of [[Corfu]].&lt;ref name=trud/&gt; According to chronicles of the [[Voulgaris]] family written in [[Venice|Venetian]] [[Corfu]], the "Voulgaris family of [[Saint Spyridon]] of [[Corfu]]" descend from the royal figures of [[barbarian]] peoples from the [[Volga]] river, who "finally settled in [[Moesia]] near the [[Balkan mountains|Haemus mountains]]", so the founding father of this family was described as the "[[Triballi]]an" (de facto [[Serbia]]n) Prince [[Stefan Lazarevic]] in the 16th century testemant of the family, becoming such by taking refugee in the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] island [[Corfu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stefanos Konstantinos |first1=Voulgaris |title=Ek Voulgareōn : hena oikogeneiako chroniko : plērophories gia tē mesaiōnikē Valkanikē |publisher=Vivliopōleion tēs "Hestias", I.D.

The founder of the Bulgari brand is Sotirios Bulgari ({{lang-el|Σωτήριος Βούλγαρης}}, {{IPA-el|soˈtirʝos ˈvulɣaris|pron}}) who was born in March 1857 in the [[Aromanians|Aromanian]] village [[Kalarites]], [[Ottoman Empire]] and was one of eleven children of his father Georgios Voulgaris(1823-1889) and his [[Aromanians|Aromanian]] mother Eleni Stronggaris.&lt;ref name="reporter"/&gt; In 1881, Sotirios Bulgari moved to Rome and, in 1884, opened his first store on via Sistina 85. In 1888, he married [[Aromanians|Aromanian]] Eleni Basio with whom he had six children: Constantine-Georgios(1889-1973), Leonidas-Georgios(1890-1966), Maria-Athena(1891-1976), Sofia(1893-1908), Alexandra(1895-1984) and Spyridon(1897-1932), so Leonidas-Georgios is the father of the current chairman of the company [[Paolo Bulgari]].&lt;ref name="reporter"&gt;{{cite web |title=Βούλγαρης Γ. Σωτήριος «Ο κοσμηματοπώλης των βασιλέων» |url=https://www.reporter.gr/Apopseis/Istories/235596-Boylgarhs-G-Swthrios-«O-kosmhmatopwlhs-twn-basilewn»?m=1 |language=el-gr}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1905, he unveiled the [[Via Condotti]] shop that would become the company’s flagship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=BVLGARI|last=Amanda Triossi and Daniela Mascetti|first=|publisher=Electa|year=2009|isbn=9788837064921|location=Milan|pages=9-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its early years, Bvlgari was known for [[silver]] pieces that borrowed elements from [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Islamic art]], combining them with floral motifs. At the time, Paris was the apex of fashion and creativity, and its trends influenced Sotirio’s designs for decades: jewels of the early 20s were characterised by [[platinum]] [[Art Deco]] settings while those of the 30s featured geometric diamond motifs—sometimes set in combination with coloured [[Gemstone|gemstones]]. Convertible jewels were also popular during the time, and one of Bvlgari’s major piece was the ''Trombino'', a small trumpet-shaped ring.

In 1932, Sotirio passed away, leaving the business to his two sons, [[Giorgio Bulgari|Giorgio]] (1890–1966) and Costantino (1889–1973), who each had a keen interest in precious stones and jewels. During the [[World War II|Second World War]], most new jewellery was crafted out of gold, as gems were scarce, and designs became more natural feeling. As the 40s came to a close, Bvlgari introduced ''Serpenti'' bracelet-watches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bulgari.com/en-us/from_the_origins|title=From the origins|last=|first=|date=|website=Bvlgari Official website|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The 50s and the 60s: Colour revolution and Dolce Vita ===
In the 50s, some of Bvlgari best-known clients included [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Anna Magnani]], [[Ingrid Bergman]] and [[Gina Lollobrigida]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Roma passion jewels|last=Meylan|first=Vincent|publisher=Electa|year=2015|isbn=9788891804549|location=Milan|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as Rome earned a reputation as "[[Hollywood on the Tiber]]" with the [[Cinecittà|Cinecittà studios]].

At the same time, Bvlgari went to a new style. The [[Post–World War II economic expansion|post-war boom]] saw a return to precious materials, particularly white metals covered in diamonds. In the 50s, Bvlgari launched its first floral brooches—called ''en tremblant'' because of their trembling diamond corollas. At the end of the 50s, Bvlgari began to establish its motifs, introducing structured, symmetrical shapes in yellow gold set with brilliant gems—chosen for their colour rather than intrinsic value. Among these multi-hued jewels, [[cabochon]] cuts were another innovation. These new pieces were a significant departure from classical Parisian design.[[File:Intersection of Aziz Aliyev Street &amp; Neftchilar Avenue, Baku.jpg|thumb|A Bulgari shop in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]]]]
After Giorgio's death in 1966, his son [[Gianni Bulgari|Gianni]] led the company as co-chief executive with his cousin Marina.&lt;ref name="theage"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/people/bulgari-the-man-the-enigma/2007/01/07/1168104862949.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1|title=Bulgari: the man, the enigma|date=8 January 2007|newspaper=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== The 70s: Eclectic creativity and global expansion ===
During the 1970s, Bvlgari stores opened in [[New York City|New York]], [[Geneva]], [[Monte Carlo]] and [[Paris]]. This era marks the beginning of the Group’s international expansion, with [[Gianni Bulgari|Gianni]] as chairman and CEO. A number of new motifs made their debut as well—jewels became recognisable for their angular forms, strong colours, oval elements with [[Cabochon|cabochons]], chains and maxi sautoirs, whilst the predominant use of yellow gold made precious pieces feel all the more wearable, and became known as a Bvlgari trademark.{{cn|date=August 2018}} In 1977, Bvlgari entered the world of horlogerie with the launch of the ''BVLGARI BVLGARI'' watch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bulgari.com/en-us/70_eclectic_creativity|title=70 eclectic creativity|last=|first=|date=|website=Bvlgari Official website|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;''' '''At the time, Gianni led a complete overhaul of the company, focusing on product design.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enigma.info/enigma/gianni-bulgari|title=Gianni Bulgari|publisher=Enigma|accessdate=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130111223841/http://www.enigma.info/enigma/gianni-bulgari/#|archive-date=11 January 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== The 80s: Prêt-à-porter jewellery ===
In the early 80s, to oversee all production of Bvlgari watches, Bvlgari Time was founded in [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.swisstime.ch/en-BVLGARI-m382.html|title=THE HISTORY OF BVLGARI|last=|first=|date=|website=Swisstime|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, [[Paolo Bulgari|Paolo]] and [[Nicola Bulgari]], Giorgio’s sons, became Chairman and Vice-Chairman, respectively&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=International Directory of Company Histories|year=2010|volume=106|chapter=Bulgari S.p.A.|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, while their nephew, [[Francesco Trapani]], became Chief Executive Officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=BVLGARI|last=Amanda Triossi and Daniela Mascetti|first=|publisher=Electa|year=2009|isbn=9788837064921|location=Milan|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, Gianni resigned as [[CEO]] and in 1987, he left the family business after selling his one-third stake in the company to his brothers Nicola and Paolo.

=== From the 90s to the new millennium ===
Bvlgari diversified its brand in 1993 with the launch of its first [[Aroma compound|fragrance]], ''Eau Parfumée au'' ''The Vert'' and the founding of Bvlgari Parfums in [[Switzerland]] to oversee the creation and production of all perfumes. In 1995, Bvlgari pushed ahead with an aggressive programme for growth, becoming listed on the [[Borsa Italiana|Milan Stock Exchange]] for the first time. In 1996, the brand launched its first accessories collection, beginning with [[silk]] scarves before developing a range of [[leather]] accessories and [[eyewear]]. In 1999, the brand launched the B.zero1 ring.{{what|date=August 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=BVLGARI|last=Amanda Triossi and Daniela Mascetti|first=|publisher=Electa|year=2009|isbn=9788837064921|location=Milan|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company has seen 150% revenue growth between 1997 and 2003.

=== The 21st century ===
The year 2000 was the beginning of an increasingly aggressive period of [[verticalization]] for Bvlgari, with the acquisition of the luxury [[Watchmaker|watchmaking]] brands Daniel Roth and [[Gérald Genta]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fhs.swiss/eng/2000-07-05_44.html|title=Bulgari To Acquire Gerald Genta And Daniel Roth|last=|first=|date=July 5, 2000|website=Federation of the Swiss watch industry|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, followed by the takeover of the jewellery firm Crova and of other companies that specialised in leather goods and watchmaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.diamonds.net/News/NewsItem.aspx?ArticleID=11068&amp;ArticleTitle=Bulgari+Acquires+100%25+Of+Crova|title=Bulgari Acquires 100% Of Crova|last=|first=|date=January 3, 2005|website=Diamonds|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opening of the first Bvlgari Hotel in [[Milan]] in 2004 further confirmed the expansion strategy of the brand, and was the result of a joint venture with Luxury Group, a division of [[Marriott International|Marriot International]]. In 2009, Bvlgari celebrated its 125th anniversary with a retrospective of the brand’s history, held in Rome at [[Palazzo delle Esposizioni]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.palazzoesposizioni.it/mostra/bulgari-tra-eternita-e-storia-125-anni-di-gioielli-italiani|title=BULGARI.

In 2011, Bvlgari signed a strategic alliance with [[LVMH|LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA]], the world’s leading luxury group. The agreement was based on a stock transfer of the Bulgari family's shares in Bvlgari S.p.A. to LVMH, an all-share deal for €4.3&amp;nbsp;billion ($6.01&amp;nbsp;billion), higher than LVMH had offered for any other company.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Roberts and Tara Lachapelle (7 March 2011), [http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-03-07/bulgari-takeover-82-costlier-than-hermes-for-lvmh-real-m-a.html Bulgari Takeover 82% Costlier Than Hermes for LVMH: Real M&amp;A] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110310165200/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-03-07/bulgari-takeover-82-costlier-than-hermes-for-lvmh-real-m-a.html|date=10 March 2011}} ''Business Week''.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the deal, the Bulgari family sold their 50.4 per cent controlling stake in exchange for 3 per cent of [[LVMH]], thereby becoming the second-biggest family shareholder behind the [[Bernard Arnault|Arnaults in LVMH]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Betts (7 March 2011), [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9f3fdab0-48e8-11e0-af8c-00144feab49a.html#ixzz1FzqOyxCi Bulgari is new jewel in LVMH crown] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150101081603/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9f3fdab0-48e8-11e0-af8c-00144feab49a.html#ixzz1FzqOyxCi|date=1 January 2015}} ''Financial Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; The takeover doubled the size of LVMH’s watches and jewellery unit, which at the time of the acquisition included [[Tag Heuer]] timepieces and [[De Beers]] diamond necklaces.

'''Charles Chi''' is an entrepreneur, venture investor, and current [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] of [[Carleton University]].

==Biography==
Chi has had a diverse career in engineering, marketing, sales, and executive leadership. Most recently, he has been an investor in early-stage technology start-up companies. Since graduating from [[Carleton University]] with a Bachelor of Systems and Computer Engineering in 1988, Chi has worked with [[Bell Canada]] and [[Unitel Communications Incorporated|Unitel]] in engineering, later moving to marketing.

Moving to [[California]]'s [[Silicon Valley]] in 1995, Chi joined [[Stratacom]], subsequently [[Cisco]], after Cisco's acquisition of the company. Chi then co-founded [[Lightera Networks]]. When Lightera was acquired by [[Ciena]], Chi became Ciena's vice-president of marketing.

In 2000, Chi joined [[Greylock Partners]], one of the original venture capital firms in the [[United States]]. As a partner and board member, Chi invested in early-stage technology startups engaged in hardware and software business throughout the world. These startups include companies located in the U.S., [[Israel]], and [[Canada]] that have since been acquired by [[Microsoft]], [[Broadcom]], [[Microchip]], and [[Brocade Communications Systems#Acquisition of McData|McData]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.carleton.ca/about/university-executive/the-chancellor/ The Chancellor - University Executive - About Carleton]&lt;/ref&gt;

While at Greylock Partners, Chi seeded Lytro, a [[Mountain View, California]] company specializing in a [[light field]] digital camera for consumer use. The Lytro camera captures the direction of light, producing images with multi-dimensional space, allowing photographs to be refocused and perspective to be shifted after they have been taken.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/29/a-review-of-the-lytro-camera/ A Review of the Lytro Camera - Gagetwise]&lt;/ref&gt; At Lytro, Chi served as Executive Chairman from May 2010 to July 2012 and interim CEO from July 2012 to April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.linkedin.com/pub/charles-chi/0/747/813&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://allthingsd.com/20120629/exclusive-lytro-ceo-ren-ng-to-step-aside-become-executive-chairman/&lt;/ref&gt;

Chi was appointed as Carleton University's 11th chancellor in August 2011, being formally installed in June 2012. President [[Roseann Runte]] noted that Chi will "inspire students to pursue their dreams through his example of hard work, dedication and strategic thinking. He epitomizes the global Canadian, at home around the world."&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsroom.carleton.ca/2011/08/29/charles-chi-named-next-carleton-university-chancellor/ Charles Chi Named Next Carleton University Chancellor - Carleton Newsroom]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Commonwealth Oil Refineries''' (COR) was an [[Australia]]n oil company that operated between 1920 and 1952 as a joint venture of the Australian government and the [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]].

==Early history==

The partnership was established in 1920 on the initiative of [[Australian Prime Minister|prime minister]] [[Billy Hughes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Australian Dictionary of Biography|last=Fitzhardinge  |first=L.

In 1924 it opened Australia's first oil refinery near [[Laverton, Victoria]], north of the [[Port Fairy railway line|Melbourne - Geelong railway]], adjacent to Kororoit Creek Road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A History of Altona and Laverton: Industrial Development|url=http://www.alhs.com.au/altona-laverton-history/a-history-of-altona/industrial-development.html|publisher=Altona and Laverton Historical Society|accessdate=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Commonwealth Oil Refineries (Australia) | title=The romance of the C.O.R. : a great national institution | publication-date=1938 | publisher=C.O.R | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/18541936 | accessdate=20 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The refinery received its first shipment of crude oil on 12 March 1924, with product coming "on-stream" on 17 May 1924. The refinery had an annual processing capacity of 100,000 tons of crude oil. The refinery was shut down on 6 August 1955, eclipsed by much larger refineries being built around the country.

In the 1930s the company was involved in oil search ventures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Amos, D. J.

==BP==
In 1952, the [[Robert Menzies|Menzies]] [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] government sold the Australian government's interest in COR to the [[Anglo-Iranian Oil Company]], which became the [[British Petroleum|British Petroleum Company]] (BP) in 1954.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1662">In [[legal theory]], a '''default rule''' is a rule of law that can be overridden by a contract, trust, will, or other legally effective agreement.  Contract law, for example, can be divided into two kinds of rules: ''default rules'' and ''mandatory rules.''  Whereas the ''default rules'' can be modified by agreement of the parties, ''mandatory rules'' will be enforced, even if the parties to a contract attempt to override or modify them.  One of the most important debates in contract theory concerns the proper role or purpose of default rules.

The idea of a default rule in contract law is sometimes connected to the notion of a [[complete contract]].  In [[contract theory]], a complete contract fully specifies the rights and duties of the parties to the contract for all possible future states of the world.  An incomplete contract, therefore, contains gaps.  Most contract theorists find that default rules fill in the gaps in what would otherwise be incomplete contracts. This is often stated pragmatically as whether a court will imply terms so as to save a contract from uncertainty.

Simpson]] and [[Donald Trump Jr]] in the summer of 2016, [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|during the U.S. presidential campaign]] of the latter's father, then-nominee [[Donald Trump]].

==Background==
Katsyv is the son of Pyotr Katsyv, a former vice governor and transportation minister of the Moscow region. He was educated and took advantage of business opportunities as Russia began to privatize. 

The son became a shareholder of Cyprus-based Prevezon Holdings Ltd. shortly after it received mysterious cash payments in 2008 from [[Moldova]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.occrp.org/en/investigations/1972-the-wall-street-connection|title=The Wall Street Connection|last=OCCRP|website=www.occrp.org|language=en|access-date=2017-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In May 2017, Prezevon settled a case brought by the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S Department of Justice]] for $5.9 million in fines. It was related to Russian tax fraud and money laundering originally uncovered by the late Russian lawyer and auditor [[Sergei Magnitsky]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6137">'''Doubling''' is a [[textile]] industry term synonymous with combining. It can be used for various processes during [[spinning (textiles)|spinning]]. During the carding stage, several sources of [[roving]]  are doubled together and drawn, to remove variations in thickness. After spinning, yarn is doubled for many reasons. Yarn may be doubled to produce warp for weaving, to make cotton for lace, crochet and knitting. {{sfn|Naismith|1896|p=557}} It is used for embroidery threads and [[sewing thread]]s, for example: sewing thread is usually 6-cable thread. Two threads of spun [[cotton count|60s cotton]] are twisted together, and three of these double threads are twisted into a cable, of what is now 5s yarn. This is [[mercerised cotton|mercerised]], [[Gassing (textile process)|gassed]] (AKA flamed) and [[wound]] onto a bobbin. {{sfn|Naismith|1896|p=567}}

==Processing of cotton==
{{Cotton processing flowchart}}
===Doubling in the carding process===

In a wider sense carding can refer to the four processes of [[willowing]], lapping, [[carding]] and drawing.  During willowing the fibres are loosened; in lapping the dust is removed to create a flat sheet or lap of fibres. Carding combs the tangled lap into a thick rope or sliver of 1/2 inch in diameter, and removes the shorter fibres creating a stronger yarn.

During the carding process the staples are separated and then assembled into a loose strand (sliver or tow).
The carders line up the staples to prepare them for spinning. The carding machine consists mainly of one big roller with smaller ones surrounding it. All of the rollers are covered in small teeth, and as the cotton progresses further on the teeth get finer (i.e. closer together). The cotton leaves the carding machine in the form of a sliver; a large rope of fibres.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Collier |1970|pp=66,67}}&lt;/ref&gt;''

In drawing,  4 slivers are combined into one. Repeated drawing decreases the quality of the sliver drastically, disabling finer counts from being spun.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Collier |1970|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each sliver will have thin and thick spots. By combining, or doubling several slivers together a more consistent size can be reached. The slivers are separated into rovings. These rovings (or slubbings) are then what are used in the spinning process. &lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Collier |1970|pp=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For machine processing, a roving is about the width of a pencil. The rovings are collected in a drum and proceed to the '''slubbing frame''' which adds twist, and winds onto bobbins. '''Intermediate Frames''' are used to repeat the slubbing process to produce a finer yarn, and then the '''roving frames''' reduces it to a finer thread, gives more twist, makes more regular and even in thickness, and winds onto a smaller tube.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hills|1993|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Masson Mills WTM 20 Derby Doubler 1902 Platts 5907.JPG|thumb|left|Derby Doubler:Masson Mills]]
Over time the processes were refined. At [[Masson Mill]] and at [[Helmshore Mills Textile Museum|Helmshore]], there are Derby Doublers. The Masson machine, built by Platts of Oldham in 1902, doubled rovings from the breaker cards into card lap. This was then passed through the finisher card to produce the rovings &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.massonmills.co.uk/Museum/M/form.html.php?linknam=Derby_Doubler Masson Mill Derby Doubler]&lt;/ref&gt; This process was known as double carding. The Derby Doubler was patented by [[Evan Leigh]] of Ashton-under-Lyne (21 December 1810 - 2 February 1876) and, though superseded, still continued in service in condensing coarse counts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oneguyfrombarlick.co.uk/viewtopic.php?f=359&amp;t=7270 One guy from Barlick: Evan Leigh and the Derby Doubler] Stanley Graham&lt;/ref&gt;

===The doubling process===
Doubling of yarn where two or more stands or ends of yarn are twisted together. There are many purposes where doubled yarn is used. Sometimes thread is doubled to make warp, and it is invariably used for the manufacture of knitting yarn, crochet yarn and sewing yarn. All these yarns must be smooth and free from knots. In a sewing thread, the treads are doubled in two phases. Two or three strands are twisted together then three of these threads are twisted together, to form a six or nine cord.{{sfn|Naismith|1896|pp=58}}
The spun yarn is wound onto a bobbin using a ''doubling winding machine'', and two or more of these bobbins are placed on doubling frame (doubling winding machine). The ends pass through a series of rollers and twisted together onto one bobbin using a spindle and flyer. The process here is similar to that found in one of Arkwrights [[Water frame]]s, though the size of the ring, spindle and traveller are predictably larger. Alternatively a 'twiner' is used: this is a modified spinning mule and is mainly consigned to the doubling of warp thread {{sfn|Naismith|1896|p=564}}
High quality doubling depended on keeping the tension correct and feeding the produced thread evenly and tightly on a bobbin or flangeless paper tubes

== History ==

Originally known as Hospitality Valuation Services, the company was founded by Steve Rushmore in 1980 in a one-room office in [[Garden City, New York]]. Rushmore, a graduate of the [[Cornell University School of Hotel Administration]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hotelschool.cornell.edu/about/pubs/news/newsdetails.html?id=609 (11-11-2009) Fourth Paragraph. Retrieved 2010-11-16.&lt;/ref&gt; drew upon his experience as head of the hospitality consulting division of [[Helmsley-Spear]], a position he took on in 1971. At that time, there were valuation companies specializing in appraising real estate (but not hotel operations) and accounting firms knowledgeable in hotel operations (but not real estate). Recognizing the need for an appraisal company that specialized in the hospitality arena, Rushmore pursued membership in the [[Appraisal Institute]] (then known as the American Institute of Real Estate Appraisers).&lt;ref name="EarlyAI" /&gt; When he received the MAI&lt;ref name="MAI"&gt;Member of the Appraisal Institute; http://www.appraisalinstitute.org/findappraiser/show_Member_Profile.asp?p=RbAKPVd4JnqhrEZbNM3zuaTKNFlFbOj3tG4ORb(1976) Retrieved 2010-11-04.&lt;/ref&gt; [[professional certification|designation]] from the Institute in 1976, Rushmore enjoyed the distinction of being the Institute's only member with a degree in hotel administration.&lt;ref&gt;"The House that Steve Built" (2002-10). Cover story, fourth paragraph. ''Lodging'' magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;

Combining his Appraisal Institute membership with his hotel school degree from Cornell, Rushmore then wrote an appraisal [[textbook]] for the hospitality industry, ''The Valuation of Hotels and Motels'',&lt;ref name="EarlyAI"&gt;http://www.appraisalinstitute.org/about/history.aspx First paragraph. Retrieved 2010-11-16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1stBook"&gt;Rushmore, Stephen (1978). {{ISBN|0-911780-44-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which the Institute published in 1978. The text has been updated four times, and the most recent publication is ''Hotels &amp; Motels: Valuations and Market Studies''.&lt;ref&gt;Rushmore, Stephen, and Erich Baum (2001). Appraisal Institute. {{ISBN|0-922154-70-8}}. http://www.appraisalinstitute.org/store/p-19-hotels-and-motels-valuations-and-market-studies.aspx Retrieved 2010-11-23.&lt;/ref&gt; This publication has been described as "the seminal text on the art and science of hotel appraisals".&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, Ed (2010-05-06). "HVS Marks 30th Anniversary". Second paragraph. ''Lodging Hospitality''. http://lhonline.com/consulting/HVS_consulting_appraisal_transactions_0506/index.html Retrieved 2010-10-28.&lt;/ref&gt; This, and other publications by Rushmore, established the methodology for appraising hotels that is today considered an [[Technical standard|industry standard]].&lt;ref name="HansonQuote"&gt;Watkins, Ed (2010-05-06). "HVS Marks 30th Anniversary". Third Paragraph. ''Lodging Hospitality''.	 http://lhonline.com/consulting/HVS_consulting_appraisal_transactions_0506/index.html Retrieved 2010-10-28. Quotation from Bjorn Hanson, Divisional Dean and Clinical Professor of Hospitality and Tourism Management, NYU Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism, and Sports Management.&lt;/ref&gt;

Capitalizing on its singular status as the only consulting and valuation company dedicated solely to the hospitality industry, HVS expanded, opening a West Coast office in San Francisco five years later, followed by offices in London, Colorado, and Florida. Today, the company has a presence in nearly thirty-five cities on five continents.

==Operations==

The organizational structure and operations of HVS are modeled on that of other consulting firms, such as [[McKinsey &amp; Company]], particularly with regards to the company's recruitment of hospitality students from prestigious universities and its compensation structure.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, Ed (2010-05-06). "HVS Marks 30th Anniversary". Seventh paragraph. ''Lodging Hospitality''. http://lhonline.com/consulting/HVS_consulting_appraisal_transactions_0506/index.html Retrieved 2010-10-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the learning curve is steep, those who thrive in the company's [[entrepreneur]]ial environment have the opportunity to transfer to other offices in a different part of the globe. In a May 2010 cover story about HVS, ''Lodging Hospitality'' magazine opined, "The list of alumni reads like a who's who of the most highly regarded consultants, development executives and financial experts in the worldwide lodging industry."&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, Ed (2010-05-06). "HVS Marks 30th Anniversary". First paragraph.	 http://lhonline.com/consulting/HVS_consulting_appraisal_transactions_0506/index.html Retrieved 2010-11-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

To help market its hotel consulting and valuation services, HVS began disseminating a broad spectrum of complimentary information to the lodging industry. HVS encouraged its associates to publish articles on informative, timely, and interesting topics for the lodging industry, and the research and writings of HVS associates are published and cited in a number of [[academic journal]]s.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

HVS conducts seminars on hotel valuation for the Appraisal Institute and other organizations around the world and has trained more than 20,000 appraisers and industry professionals. HVS research and data-gathering about historical and projected hotel value trends, sales transaction data, compensation programs, franchise fees, hotel franchise development costs, and hotel renovation costs provides data to industry participants.&lt;ref&gt;Turkel, Stan (2010-06-19) http://www.bluemaumau.org/welldeserved_compliment_steve_rushmore Second paragraph. Retrieved 2010-11-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and conference sponsorship==

Consistent with the academic background of the company's founder, HVS supports several institutions of higher learning that specialize in hospitality. To foster academic research in the field, HVS endows [[professorial chair]]s at both [[New York University]]'s [[Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism, and Sports Management]] and [[Cornell University]]'s hotel school.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scps.nyu.edu/export/sites/scps/areas-of-study/tisch/hospitality-conference/special-message-from-jonathan-tisch.pdf Dr. Lalia Rach, HVS Professor.

Henri was born to step in his father's shoes. At the age of 19, he follows a refrigeration course in [[Mittweida]], [[Germany]] with the latest developments in that field.

==Career==
In 1894, At the age of 30, Grasso took over the business from his father.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gearefrigeration.com/en-uk/About-Us/History/History-UK/Pages/Grasso-history-1858-1900.aspx  History GEA Refrigeration Technologies: 1858 - 1900]&lt;/ref&gt;  Under Henri Grasso’s lead, the company grew fast. In 1896, he moved the factory of butter/margarine machines from 's-Hertogenbosch to much larger premises at [[Vught, The Netherlands]].  In 1918 Grasso produced the first [[ammonia]] [[refrigeration]] [[gas compressor|compressor]].&lt;ref name="foodproductiondaily.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mobile.foodproductiondaily.com/Markets/GEA-Grasso-piston-compressors-factory-renovation#.VNVlPC5RK1A|title=GEA Grasso piston compressors factory renovation|work=FoodProductionDaily.com|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927, Grasso celebrated his 50 years anniversary as manager. At this time, 260 employees are employed at the Grasso factory with a turnover of more than 0.5 million [[Euro]]. Only a few years before he was the manager, there were 18 people working for Grasso. Due to the [[economic crisis]], the number of employees falls back to 50 people. In 1944, Henri Grasso died at the age of 80. In the same year, the factory is almost completely destroyed during [[World War II]] so that business comes to a standstill. After the war, the Grasso factory was rebuilt. " After the war Grasso stopped the obsolete production of dairy and [[margarine]] machines and went then focus on the worldwide export of [[refrigeration]] equipment.  The 100th anniversary of Grasso in 1958 and was celebrated for his achievements and interest in the Dutch industry, the company received the designation 'Royal'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bossche-encyclopedie.nl/panden/parallelweg%2025-27.htm|title=Bossche Encyclopedie - Grasso (1912)|work=bossche-encyclopedie.nl|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947 the first welded compressor was introduced by his company.&lt;ref name="foodproductiondaily.com"/&gt;

'''IRI''' is a [[market research]] company headquartered in the U.S. which provides clients with consumer, shopper, and retail market intelligence and analysis focused on the [[consumer packaged goods]] (CPG) industry.  

==History==
Information Resources, Incorporated (IRI) was formed in [[Chicago]] in 1979 by market researcher John Malec and Gerald Eskin, a [[University of Iowa]] marketing professor.&lt;ref name=crain&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20160220/ISSUE01/302209994/iri-uses-big-data-to-predict-purchases-of-consumer-packaged-goods|title=IRI's new purpose in consumer research|author=Brigid Sweeney|publisher=[[Crain's Chicago Business]]|date =February 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two purchased scanners for supermarkets to gather point-of-sale data based on bar codes in grocery stores that could be sold to CPG companies to track what customers purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =https://sync-magazine.com/2017/iri-andrewappel/|title=IRI and the Hub of the Data Ecosystem|author=Adam Kivel|publisher=Sync Magazine|date =September 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; IRI became a [[public company]] in 
1983.&lt;ref name="Honomichl Top 50 Report, 2012"&gt;{{cite web| url =https://www.ama.org/Documents/2012-Hono-Top-50.pdf|title=Honomichl Top 50 Report|publisher=[[American Marketing Association]]|date =January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1993 [[Fortune Magazine]] named IRI a "company to watch" for expanding into two of its biggest markets: analyzing nationwide scanner data on consumer products and producing computer software.  At that time slightly more than half IRI's revenues came from Infoscan, its marketing data service.&lt;ref name="Fortune"&gt;{{cite web| url =https://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1993/12/27/78787/index.htm|title=COMPANIES TO WATCH|author=JOHN LABATE |publisher=[[CNNMoney]]|date =December 27, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2003, IRI was acquired by a joint-venture cooperation between enterprise software provider [[Symphony Technology Group]] and investment capital firm Tennenbaum Capital Partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://adage.com/article/news/iri-sold-108-4-million/37856/|title=IRI TO BE SOLD FOR $108.4 MILLION|author=Jack Neff |publisher=[[Adage]]|date =June 30, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2013, SymphonyIRI Group, Inc. announced that it was rebranding as IRI.&lt;ref name=supermarket&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.supermarketnews.com/center-store/symphonyiri-rebrands-iri|title=SymphonyIRI Rebrands to IRI|publisher=Supermarket News|date=April 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2011, New York-based private equity firm [[New Mountain Capital]] bought SymphonyIRI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newmountaincapital.com/media/46278/20151001.pdf|title=IRI: Crafting A Crystal Ball With Consumer Spending Data |publisher=[[New Mountain Capital]]|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company announced that it was changing its name back to Information Resources Inc., or IRI.&lt;ref name=supermarket/&gt; 

In September 2013, IRI acquired Aztec, a provider of market measurement and related services for consumer packaged goods (CPG), liquor and pharmaceutical manufacturers and retailers in Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, New Zealand, South Africa, Sweden and the United Kingdom. This was the largest acquisition in IRI’s history and significantly expanded IRI’s geographic presence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =https://www.drugstorenews.com/news/iri-acquires-aztec-aegis-media/|title=IRI acquires Aztec from Aegis Media|author=Michael Johnsen

==Management==
In February 2004, IRI named former [[DXC Technology|Electronic Data Systems Corp]] executive Scott Klein as its president and CEO, succeeding Joe Durrett.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://adage.com/article/people-players/iri-names-president-ceo/39352/|title=IRI NAMES NEW PRESIDENT-CEO|author=Jack Neff |publisher=[[Adage]]|date =February 3, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klein served as CEO until October 2007, when he moved to IRI's parent company, Symphony Technology Group, and was succeeded by former [[Salesforce.com]] executive John Freeland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://adage.com/article/people-players/freeland-takes-ceo-post-iri/120864/|title=FREELAND TAKES CEO POST AT IRI|author=Jack Neff |publisher=[[Adage]]|date =October 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, SymphonyIRI Group, Inc. appointed former [[Aon (company)|Aon]] COO and [[McKinsey &amp; Company]] senior partner, Andrew Appel, as president and CEO to succeed John G. Freeland, who moved to an interim role as executive vice chairman.&lt;ref name=crain/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =https://www.supermarketnews.com/latest-news/symphonyiri-names-appel-president-ceo|title=SymphonyIRI Names Appel President, CEO|publisher=Supermarket News|date=June 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Catsimatidis was the runner-up to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nomination for [[mayor of New York City]] in the [[New York City mayoral election, 2013|2013 election]].

==Early life==
John Catsimatidis was born on the Greek island of [[Nisyros]] on September 7, 1948.&lt;ref name="Elkies"/&gt; He came to the United States with his parents when he was six months old.&lt;ref name="Elkies"/&gt;

The family moved to [[Harlem|West Harlem]], where Catsimatidis grew up.&lt;ref name="Levin"&gt;Robert Levin, [https://web.archive.org/web/20091216152512/http://www.nyreport.com/832 John of All Trades - An Interview with John Catsimatidis] (April 1, 2009). ''New York Enterprise Report''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Catsimatidis' father had been a [[lighthouse]] operator in Greece but worked as a [[busboy]] in New York.&lt;ref name="Levin"/&gt; Catsimatidis graduated from [[Brooklyn Technical High School]] in 1966.&lt;ref name="Levin"/&gt;  He received a congressional nomination to [[United States Military Academy|West Point]], but chose to study [[electrical engineering]] at [[New York University]] instead.&lt;ref name="Levin"/&gt;

While in college, Catsimatidis worked for the uncle of a friend, Tony, in a small supermarket on 137th Street which Tony and his uncle owned.&lt;ref name="Levin"/&gt; While Catsimatidis was still in college, Tony sold his half of the store to Catsimatidis.&lt;ref name="Levin"/&gt; Catsimatidis completed four years of college, but dropped out eight credits short of graduating.&lt;ref name="Elkies"/&gt;

==Business career==
In 1971, Catsimatidis opened his first store, at [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] and 99th Street.&lt;ref name="Levin"/&gt; Shortly thereafter, he purchased another grocery store on 87th street just west of Broadway, naming it Red Apple. Among his business innovations were staying open late seven days a week, offering free delivery, and cashing checks for customers.&lt;ref name="Levin"/&gt; Catsimatidis has stated that by the time he was 24 years old, "I built up ten stores and the business was doing $25 million a year, and I was personally earning a million dollars a year."&lt;ref name="Levin"/&gt;

A donor to Bill Clinton during the Clinton years, Catsimatidis, while still enrolled as a Democrat, considered becoming a candidate in the [[New York City mayoral election, 2009|2009 mayoral election]] as a Republican.&lt;ref name="Again"&gt;Michael M.

In 2008, Catsimatidis was widely viewed as a potential mayoral candidate, along with City Council Speaker [[Christine Quinn]], Representative [[Anthony Weiner]], businessman Richard Parsons, Police Commissioner [[Raymond Kelly]], City Comptroller [[Bill Thompson (New York politician)|Bill Thompson]] (the eventual Democratic nominee), and state Senator [[Martin Golden]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Kiefer, [http://www.nysun.com/new-york/bloomberg-could-clash-with-lauder/74596/ Bloomberg Could Clash With Lauder] (April 14, 2008), ''New York Sun''.&lt;/ref&gt; By July 2008, Catsimatidis formed an exploratory committee of advisors and operatives, including Robert Ryan, Alan Bernikow, Lawrence Mandelker, and Jose Ithier.&lt;ref name="Rauh"&gt;Grace Rauh, [http://www.nysun.com/new-york/catsimatidis-readies-for-2009-mayoral-run/82960/ Catsimatidis Readies For 2009 Mayoral Run] (July 31, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; McLaughlin &amp; Associates was the committee's polling firm.&lt;ref name="Rauh"/&gt;

==2013 mayoral campaign==
During the spring of 2012, Catsimatidis described his dismay over the quality of the announced as well as the presumed candidates.

Jeuck''' (October 17, 1916 - December 18, 2009) was an American professor of [[business]] and dean (1952-1955) of the [[University of Chicago Booth School of Business]]. He was best known for his work on business history and [[corporate strategy]], especially his profile of [[Sears]] in his 1950 book ''Catalogues and Counters: A History of Sears, Roebuck and Company'' with Boris Emmet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Catalogues_and_Counters.html?id=E3-wAAAAIAAJ | title = Catalogues and Counters: A History of Sears, Roebuck and Company | author1 = Emmet | first1 = Boris | last2 = Jeuck | first2 = John E | year = 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book received the national award of the [[American Marketing Association]] in 1951.

Jeuck spent most of his career at the [[University of Chicago]], receiving his Bachelor of Arts in 1937, MBA in 1938, and PhD in 1949. A veteran of the [[United States Navy]], he joined the University faculty three years before he received his PhD. As dean, he changed the school's curriculum and helped establish a downtown campus for part-time MBA students. Jeuck also increased faculty retention by eliminating a requirement that professors give their consulting fees to the school.&lt;ref name="articles.chicagotribune"&gt;Hopkins, Jared, "John E.

He received the [[McKinsey Award for Excellence in Teaching]] in 1979 and retired from teaching in 1988.&lt;ref name="news.uchicago" /&gt; During his career, he served as a [[consultant]] to over a dozen companies, including [[Sears]], [[IBM]], and [[Coca-Cola]].

{{Nihongo|'''Kenichi Ohmae'''|大前 研一|Ōmae Ken'ichi|extra= born February 21, 1943}} is a Japanese [[organizational theorist]], [[management consultant]], Former Professor and Dean of [[UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs]], and author, known for developing the [[3C's Model]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.easy-strategy.com/kenichi-ohmae.html Kenichi Ohmae: He is known as Mr. Strategy and has developed the 3C's Model]" on ''easy-strategy.com'', retrieved on 12 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Born in 1943 in [[Kitakyūshū]], Ohmae earned a BS in [[chemistry]] in 1966 from [[Waseda University]], an MS in nuclear physics in 1968 from the [[Tokyo Institute of Technology]], and a doctorate in nuclear engineering from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[[Witzel, Morgen]]. ''Fifty key figures in management''. Routledge, 2004. p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduation, Ohmae subsequently worked as a senior design engineer for [[Hitachi]] from 1970 to 1972. From 1972 to 1995 he worked for [[McKinsey &amp; Company]].  As a senior partner he ran the company's [[Japan]] operations for a number of years.  He co-founded its strategic management practice, and served companies in a wide spectrum of industries, including industrial and consumer electronics, finance, telecommunications, food and chemicals.  In 1995 he ran for [[Governor of Tokyo]], but lost to [[Yukio Aoshima]].

In 1997 he went to the United States, where he was appointed Dean and Professor of [[UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs]].  In 1997 to 1998, he became a Guest professor of Stanford Graduate School of Business, MBA Program.

In 2011, he became a Project director for Team "H2O", and coordinated in preparing the report "What should we learn from the severe accident at the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant?" and submitted it to [[Goshi Hosono]], the Minister of Environment &amp; Minister for the Restoration of Nuclear Accident.  In 2012, he became a member of The "Nuclear Reform Monitoring Committee" of [[Tokyo Electric Power Company]] (TEPCO).

== Work ==
Ohmae introduced the Japanese management methods to a broad Western audience, a specifically the Toyota practice of [[Just in time (business)|just-in-time production]].  He also outlined the differences between Japanese and Western companies, in particular:
* the long strategic planning horizon of Japanese companies 
* the short planning horizon based on [[shareholder value]] thinking of Western companies

Through his numerous publications, he coined many terms that are still in use today.  In the 1980s, he predicted and described globalization as prominent phenomenon in the world economy.

== Publications ==
Ohmae has written a number of books, including 
* ''The Mind of the Strategist''
* ''The End of the Nation State'' 
* ''The Borderless World''
* ''Triad Power''

The '''Kolbe–Schmitt reaction''' or '''Kolbe process''' (named after [[Hermann Kolbe]] and [[Rudolf Schmitt]]) is a [[carboxyl]]ation [[chemical reaction]] that proceeds by heating sodium phenoxide (the [[sodium]] salt of [[phenol]]) with [[carbon dioxide]] under pressure (100 [[atmospheric pressure|atm]], 125&amp;nbsp;°C), then treating the product with [[sulfuric acid]]. The final product is an [[aromatic]] hydroxy [[acid]] which is also known as [[salicylic acid]] (the precursor to [[aspirin]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

By using [[potassium hydroxide]], [[4-hydroxybenzoic acid]] is accessible, an important precursor for the versatile [[paraben]] class of [[biocides]] used e.g. in personal care products.

The methodology is also used in the industrial synthesis of [[3-Hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid|3-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid]].  The regiochemistry of the carboxylation in this case is sensitive to temperature.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Gerald Booth|title=Naphthalene Derivatives|encyclopedia=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|year=2005|publisher=Wiley-VCH|place=Weinheim|doi=10.1002/14356007.a17_009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction mechanism==
The Kolbe–Schmitt reaction proceeds via the nucleophile addition of a phenoxide, classically [[sodium phenoxide]] (NaOC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;), to carbon dioxide to give the salicylate.
The final step is reaction of the salicylate with acid to form the desired salicylic acid.

The '''language industry''' is the sector of activity dedicated to facilitating multilingual communication, both oral and written. According to the European Commission's Directorate-General of Translation, the language industry comprises the activities of translation, interpreting, subtitling and dubbing, software and website globalisation, language technology tools development, international conference organisation, language teaching and linguistic consultancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Language industry web platform|url=http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/translation/programmes/languageindustry/platform/index_en.htm|publisher=EC DG Translation|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Canadian Language Industry Association, this sector comprises translation (with interpreting, subtitling and localisation), language training and language technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our industry|url=http://www.ailia.ca/Our+Industry|publisher=Language Industry Association|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Language Industry Association limits the sector to translation, localisation, internationalisation and globalisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ELIA membership application|url=http://www.elia-association.org/index.php?id=101&amp;no_cache=1|publisher=European Language Industry Association|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An older, perhaps outdated view confines the language industry to computerised [[language processing]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.btb.gc.ca/btb.php?lang=eng&amp;cont=700#l|title=Glossary - Translation Bureau|publisher=[[Public Works and Government Services Canada]]|accessdate=2009-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and places it within the [[information technology industry]]. An emerging view expands this sector to include [[Editing#Editing_services|editing]] for authors who write in a second language—especially English—for international communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Supporting research writing: roles and challenges in multilingual settings|year=2013|publisher=Chandos|location=Oxford|pages=257–268|last=Matarese|first=Valerie. Supporting research writing in non-anglophone Europe: reflections and recurring themes|editor=Matarese Valerie}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Services ==
The scope of services in the industry includes:
*[[Translation]]
*[[Editing]] for authors: [[author editing]]
*[[Editing]] for publishers, e.g. [[copy editing]], [[proofreading]] (including [[Computer-assisted reviewing|CAR]]), [[developmental editing]]
*[[Language interpretation]]
*[[Language education]]
*[[Computer-assisted translation]] tools development
*[[Terminology extraction]]
*[[Language localisation]]
*[[Software localisation]]
*[[Machine translation]]

The persons who facilitate multilingual communication by offering individualized services—translation, interpreting, editing or language teaching—are called [[language professional]]s.

== Evolution ==
Translation as an activity exists at least since mankind started developing [[trade]] millennia ago; so, if we include [[interpreting]], it is no exaggeration to say that the origins of language industry are older than those of [[written language]].

Modern language industry has developed rapidly following availability of the [[internet]]. Achievements of the industry include the ability to quickly translate long texts into many languages. This has created new challenges as compared with the traditional activity of translators, such as that of [[quality assurance]]. There are various [[Translation-quality standards|quality standards]] such as the  [[International Organization for Standardization]]'s ISO 17100,  [[EN 15038]] in Europe, the CAN CGSB 131.10 in Canada and ASTM F2575-06 in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bsi-global.com/en/Shop/Publication-Detail/?pid=000000000030122045/|title=BS EN 15038:2006  Translation services.

A study commissioned by the EC's Directorate-General for Translation estimated the language industry in European member states to be worth 8.4 billion euro in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The size of the language industry in the EU|year=2009|publisher=European Commission DG Translation|isbn=978-92-79-14181-2|url=http://bookshop.europa.eu/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/WFS/EU-Bookshop-Site/en_GB/-/EUR/ViewPublication-Start?PublicationKey=HC8009985}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The largest portion, 5.7 billion euro, was ascribed to the activities of translation, interpreting, software localisation and website globalisation. Editing was not taken into consideration. The study projected an annual growth rate of 10% for the language industry. At the time the study was published, in 2009, the language industry was less affected by the economic crisis than other industry sectors. 

One field of research in the industry includes the possibility of [[machine translation]] fully replacing human translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Proceedings of TMI|last=Paul |first=Michael |author2=Andrew Finch |author3=Eiichiro Sumita  |title=Reducing human assessment of machine translation quality to binary classifiers|year=2007|pages=154–162|url=http://www.mt-archive.info/TMI-2007-Paul.pdf|accessdate=2009-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
Rates for translation services have become a big discussion topic nowadays{{when?|date=January 2014}},&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; as several translation outsourcers allegedly go in search of cheap labor. Professional associations like [[IAPTI]] try to put a stop to this development.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.translatorscafe.com/cafe/MegaBBS/forumthread14854.htm A new T&amp;I association is born]
&lt;/ref&gt; Currency fluctuation is yet another important factor.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.globalwatchtower.com/2007/11/14/translation-pricing/ Rates for translation services to go up?]&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from this, phenomena such as [[crowdsourcing]] appear in large-scale translations.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Louis [[De Geer]]''' (17 November 1587, in [[Liège]] &amp;ndash; 19 June 1652, in [[Amsterdam]]) was a [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] [[entrepreneur]] and [[industrialist]] of [[Walloons|Walloon]] origin. An early pioneer of outward [[foreign direct investment]] in the [[early modern period]], he is considered by many as the father of Swedish industry for introducing Walloon [[blast furnace]]s in Sweden. He produced [[cannon]]s for the German  [[Protestantism|Protestant]] movement, the Dutch navy and the [[Dutch East India Company]] and the [[Dutch West India Company]].&lt;ref name=Nordisk&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Louis De Geer |encyclopedia=[[Nordisk familjebok]]|year=1907|publisher=[[Project Runeberg]] |location=Stockholm|volume=6|pages=2–4|url=http://runeberg.org/nfbf/0017.html|language=Swedish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
De Geer was the son of the iron industrialist and merchant Louis de Geer de Gaillarmont (1535-1602), and Jeanne de Neille (1557-1641). His father had previously (1563) been married to Maria de Jalhéa (died 1578). In 1592, one of De Geer's half-sisters, Marie de Geer (1574-1609) married {{Interlanguage link multi|Elias Trip|nl}} (1569-1636), a Dutch merchant and a director of the [[Dutch East India Company]] who lived in [[Dordrecht]]. Presumably due to ongoing turmoil in the [[Prince-Bishopric of Liège]] as well as his conversion to Protestantism, De Geer's father sold his properties in Liège in 1595 and followed his daughter to Dordrecht, where since 1589 a neighborhood had existed populated by merchants from Liège. In 1603, his daughter Margaretha de Geer (1583–1672) married Jacob Trip (1575–1661), brother and partner of Elias, further cementing the merchant families' relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Breedvelt-Van Veen|first= Froukje|date= 1935 |title= Louis de Geer: 1587-1652|url= https://books.google.com/books/about/Louis_de_Geer.html?id=QtNWAAAAMAAJ|publisher= H.J. Paris|language= Dutch |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=romein&gt;{{cite book |last1= Romein|first1= Jan|last2= Romein-Verschoor|first2= Annie|date= 1977|title= Erflaters van onze beschaving: Nederlandse Gestalten Uit Zes Eeuwen|chapter= Louis de Geer|url= http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/rome002erfl01_01/rome002erfl01_01_0013.php |language= Dutch|publisher=Querido|location=Amsterdam|isbn= 9789021420288|page= 285-305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johannes Polyander]] appears to have been an important teacher of Louis Jr. in Dordrecht. From 1605 to 1608, De Geer trained as coppersmith in [[Roanne]] in France, after which he started his first business in [[La Rochelle]].&lt;ref name=romein/&gt; Returning to Dordrecht in 1611 he associated himself with his brothers-in-law. In 1612, he married Adrienne Gérard (ca 1590–1634), also originally from Liège, with whom he had 16 children.&lt;ref name=romein/&gt; Having earned a fortune as a banker and industrialist he moved his family to Amsterdam in 1615. Owing to his extensive travels he received a good education in business.&lt;ref name=Ekinge&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ekinge|first1=Robert|title=Louis De Geer|url=http://www.ekinge.nu/orterna/godegard/main.htm|website=www.ekinge.nu|publisher=Robert Ekinge|accessdate=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the outbreak of the [[Thirty Years' War]] the demand for weapons increased enormously. In 1618, De Geer delivered weapons to [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]], the Swedish king. Impressed by his business instincts the [[Government of Sweden|Swedish government]] allowed him to lease estates near [[Finspång]], [[Östergötland]] in eastern Sweden proper. Before long, De Geer had established a formidable workshop industry there. In 1623 he was active in a Swedish trading company.&lt;ref name=Nordisk /&gt;

The Swedish government continued to support him and De Geer received the monopoly on the [[copper]] and [[iron]] trade. De Geer, who adopted Sweden as his second home country, immigrated to Sweden in 1627. He hoped to evade paying [[tariff|toll]] in [[Øresund|de Sont]]. In 1634, he bought "Het Huis met de Hoofden" on the [[Keizersgracht]] in Amsterdam. His wife died after the birth of their sixteenth child.&lt;ref name=SBL&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Louis De Geer |encyclopedia=[[Svenskt biografiskt lexikon]]|year=1931 |publisher=[[National Archives of Sweden]] |location=Stockholm|volume=10|page=457|url=http://sok.riksarkivet.se/SBL/Presentation.aspx?id=17354|language=Swedish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1640, De Geer travelled again to Sweden and was ennobled. In his new status he was able to buy 3/4 of the leased farmlands. {{As of|2011}} his estate in [[Stockholm]] houses the Dutch embassy in Sweden.&lt;ref name=SBL /&gt;

Working for Axel Oxenstierna he went to Amsterdam to support the war against Denmark. In 1644, at the start of the [[Torstenson War]] against [[Denmark]], he singlehandedly equipped an armada of ships to sail against Denmark. This fleet contained a complete marine, 32 ships with sailors, weaponry and officers. The Swedes were able to conquer [[Fehmarn]] in Denmark, thanks to his aid.  De Geer is also considered responsible for the [[Swedish Africa Company]]. When he founded the company a riot started in Amsterdam in 1649. His family also provided shelter to pacifist and humanist [[Comenius]] in his home in Amsterdam.  He died in 1652 after falling ill during another voyage to Sweden. He returned to Amsterdam and died there. He was buried in the family grave in the {{Interlanguage link multi|Augustijnenkerk|nl|3=Augustijnenkerk (Dordrecht)}} in Dordrecht.&lt;ref name=Ekinge /&gt;&lt;ref name=romein/&gt;

'''Maximilian Leopold Löblich''' (born 16 November 1901 in [[Vienna]]; died 1 March 1984) was an [[Austria]]n entrepreneur, [[coppersmith]], engineer and president of [[Löblich &amp; Co.]], the oldest heating manufacturer in Austria.

== Life ==

Max Loeblich, son of the director of the Vienna Local Railway Company (''[[Wiener Lokalbahnen]]''), went to boarding-school in [[Horn, Austria|Horn]], [[Lower Austria]], then finished the poly-technicum in Vienna and became a coppersmith master there. From 1924 to 1927 he worked as a technical designer in a German manufacturing company, before becoming responsible for product design and engineering at Loeblich &amp; Co.

In 1935 he took over the management of the Leopold Loeblich Metal Works from his uncle Leopold Löblich, together with his brother, the engineer Franz Loeblich. The Federal Union of Coppersmiths became under [[Nazi]] rule  (1938–1945) part of a German craftsmanship representation, in which Loeblich (despite not being a member of the [[Nazi Party]]), was elected chairman, representing the coppersmiths. After the death of his brother in the last days of World War II, he continued the business on his own.

As engineer and designer of new types of heating boilers (Rohleder-system welded smoke-pipe boilers with atmospheric burners (Polidoro, Italy), and Brahma-system electro-mechanical gas valves) he managed to expand the business among the leading producers in Europe and was the leader in Austria's market for gas heaters in the 1950s. In due course, gas became the most popular form of energy for household heating in Austria and many countries in Europe.

Among Loeblich's customers were Austria's federal presidents [[Adolf Schärf]], [[Franz Jonas]], [[Kurt Waldheim]], and [[Thomas Klestil]], and Hungarian president [[János Kádár]], prime minister [[Bruno Kreisky]], and vice-chancellor [[Alois Mock]]. Loeblich obtained many public awards during this period.

A few years before his death in 1984 he passed over the management of the company to his son Max Wolfgang Loeblich (b. 1931) and his nephew, engineer Adolf Loeblich (b. 1938), who continued the business and started many international cooperations, distribution and service agreements in the fields of heating and catering systems.

== Family==

Married to Elisabeth Goetz (1899–1987), Loeblich was the father of three children: Maria, Konstanze, and Max. Loeblich died in 1984 and is buried in Weidling near Vienna in the family grave, the first work of architect Robert Oerley.

'''Sir Michael Edwardes''' (born 11 October 1930)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sir Michael Edwardes|url=http://www.debretts.com/people/biographies/browse/e/16007/Michael%20Owen+EDWARDES.aspx|work=Debretts|accessdate=17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is a British-South African business executive.

==Biography==
Edwardes matriculated from [[St. Andrew's College (Grahamstown, South Africa)|St. Andrew's College]] in 1947 before graduating from [[Rhodes University]]. He began his career in 1951 with the [[Chloride Group]]. He went on in 1966 to serve as the general manager of Alkaline Batteries, one of the groups operating companies at Redditch, Worcestershire UK. He later joined the Chloride main board and became Chief Executive in 1971 and remained in that position until 1977  

He was appointed to the UK's [[National Enterprise Board]], a [[QUANGO]] whose role was to provide financing to large UK state-owned enterprises (or nationalized industries), including the country's ailing motor giant, [[British Leyland]], when it was established in 1975.  

In 1977 he was appointed as chief executive of [[British Leyland]], and within two weeks he became chairman as the company's board was 'pruned' from 13 to 7 members.&lt;ref name=Motor197711&gt;{{cite magazine| authorlink=Roger Bell (Ed)|title=MotorWeek: Surgery for survival|magazine=[[The Motor (magazine)|Motor]]|volume=152: nbr 3919|page=2|date=26 November 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979 he was knighted in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours]].&lt;ref name=Motor1979&gt;{{cite magazine|authorlink=Unsigned|title=Newsflashes|magazine=[[The Motor (magazine)|Motor]]|volume=155 nbr 4002|page=4|date=23 June 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The next year, in 1980 he attracted criticism for a speech to the CBI Conference in which he said, "If the Cabinet do not have the wit and imagination to reconcile our industrial needs with the fact of [[North Sea oil]], they would do better to leave the bloody stuff in the ground."{{sfn|Edwardes|1983}}

His tenure with British Leyland lasted until 1982, when he was replaced by [[Harold Musgrove]].

In 1982, on his retirement from British Leyland as CEO, Sir Michael Edwardes was presented with a British Racing Green Jaguar XJS.  He later had this car shipped to South Africa, where he used it for board meetings at General Motors South Africa in 1988.

In 1984, he became Chairman of [[International Computers Limited|ICL]], but resigned six months later when the company was acquired by [[Standard Telephones and Cables|STC]].

Edwardes wrote ''Back from the Brink'', a book which discusses his experiences at [[British Leyland]].

He donated over [[South African Rand|R]]500,000 to [[St. Andrew's College (Grahamstown, South Africa)|St. Andrew's College]] in 2005. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13424">The '''National Association for Community College Entrepreneurship''' ('''NACCE''') is a [[non-profit organization]] founded in 2002 to serve the mission of accelerating [[entrepreneurship]] at [[Community college|community]] and [[technical college]]s in the [[United States]]. The organization serves two audiences: 1) community college administrators who are manage entrepreneurship education programs and entrepreneurship centers and 2) faculty members who teach entrepreneurship. NACCE's vision is creating economic vitality through entrepreneurship; members believe community colleges are in an ideal position to accomplish this based on their accessibility and local ties to their communities. NACCE helps community colleges nationwide link their traditional role of workforce development with entrepreneurial development. Through annual conference, symposiums, a web site, an e-newsletter, webinars, a quarterly journal, member blogs, podcasts, a listserv and other services, NACCE helps is members share information about  entrepreneurship education. 

The field of entrepreneurship education first emerged in the 1970s, with the first courses at community colleges starting in the early ‘70s. According to a [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] 2007 survey of the 1,193 community colleges in the U.S., 66% offer a least one course in Entrepreneurship, 14% offer an associate degree in Entrepreneurship, 19% offer a certificate in Entrepreneurship, 55% offer Entrepreneurship as continuing education, 26% offer a program in Entrepreneurship, and 20% host a small business development center.  Entrepreneurship education programs at community colleges have two target markets: students enrolled in credit and noncredit classes, and potential or existing small business owners. 

In 2001, [[Springfield Technical Community College]] and the Entrepreneurial Institute at the Springfield Enterprise Center at STCC in Massachusetts began to research and investigate entrepreneurship education practices at community colleges across the country. At that time, only about 10% of 1,200-plus community colleges had any type of entrepreneurship education as part of their curriculum.

At the same time, both the American Association for Community Colleges (AACC) and the National Commission on Entrepreneurship recognized that community colleges were ideally positioned to be catalysts for fostering economic vitality through entrepreneurship education at the community college level. 

In response to these findings, NACCE was created to establish entrepreneurship education as a core offering to foster economic development through community colleges. An inaugural conference was set in motion with a $100,000 grant from S. Prestley Blake, the co-founder of [[Friendly Ice Cream]] Corporation. NACCE went on to receive a $50,000 grant from the [[Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation]] of Kansas City and a $20,000 grant from the Coleman Foundation in Chicago. 

In 2003, NACCE held its Inaugural Conference in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], with 150 attendees.  Annual conferences have been held every year since, with attendance now averaging around 400 - 500 attendees. 

NACCE now has over 300 community colleges as members and over 2000 active participants.

In the fall of 2011, NACCE launched the Presidents for Entrepreneurship Pledge (PFEP), which encourages all community college presidents to endorse five commitments that will ensure that community colleges are involved in the national discuss about how to increase entrepreneurship which is being led by the Obama White House through its launch of Startup America. Through the PFEP, community college presidents commit to 1) Develop transparency of community college and community assets; 2) Create internal and external teams dedicated to entrepreneurship; 3) Increase entrepreneurs' engagement in community college; 4) Engage in industry cluster development; and 5) Create buzz and broad exposure for their college's commitment to entrepreneurship.

In 2015, a quantitative research study that included responses from over 900 individuals, validated the effectiveness of the PFEP pledge with statistically significant relationships for the first four out of five commitments. Efforts are underway to increase and to expand the participation of community colleges with the PFEP beginning in 2015.

'''Paperboard''' is a  thick [[paper]]-based material.  While there is no rigid differentiation between paper and paperboard, paperboard is generally thicker (usually over 0.30&amp;nbsp;mm, 0.012 in, or 12 points) than [[paper]] and has certain superior attributes such as foldability and rigidity. According to [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standards, paperboard is a paper with a [[grammage]] above 250 g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, but there are exceptions.&lt;ref name="Robertson"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Robertson|first= Gordon L.|title=Food Packaging - Principle and Practice (2nd Ed.)|year=2005|isbn=978-0-8493-3775-8 |page=111|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paperboard can be single- or multi-ply.  

Paperboard can be easily cut and formed, is lightweight, and because it is strong, is used in [[packaging]].  Another end-use is high quality graphic printing, such as book and magazine covers or postcards.  Paperboard is also used in [[fine art]]s for creating sculptures.

Sometimes it is referred to as ''[[Cardboard (paper product)|cardboard]]'', which is a generic, lay term used to refer to any heavy [[pulp (paper)|paper pulp]]–based board, however this usage is deprecated in the paper, printing and packaging industries as it does not adequately describe each product type.

==History==
In 1817, the first paperboard carton was produced in [[England]]. [[Folding carton]]s first emerged around the 1860s and were shipped flat to save space, ready to be set up by customers when they were required. 1879 saw the development of mechanical die cutting and creasing of blanks. In 1911 the first [[kraft process|kraft sulphate mill]] was built in [[Florida]]. In 1915 the [[carton#Gable top|gable top]] milk carton was patented and in 1935 the first [[dairy#Industrial processing|dairy plant]] was observed using them. Ovenable paperboard was introduced in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paperboard Packaging Alliance |title=Paperboard Packaging |accessdate=2009-07-18 |url=http://www.paperboardpackaging.org/student_design_challenge/syllabus/1-%20History%20of%20Paperboard.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121092805/http://www.paperboardpackaging.org/student_design_challenge/syllabus/1-%20History%20of%20Paperboard.pdf |archivedate=November 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology and classification==
[[File:Pakje sigaretten.JPG |thumb| Crush-proof [[Cigarette pack]] made of folding boxboard.]]
Terminology and classifications of paperboard are not always uniform.  Differences occur  depending on specific industry,  locale, and personal choice.   In general, the following are often used:&lt;ref&gt;[[ASTM]] D996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

** [[Binder's board]]: a paperboard used in bookbinding for making hardcovers.

==Production==
{{See also|Paper machine}}
Fibrous material is turned into pulp (paper)/pulp and bleaching of wood [[Pulp (paper)|bleached]], to create one or more layers of board, which can be optionally coated for a better surface and/or improved visual appearance. pulp board are produced on pulping machines that can handle higher grammage and several plies.

===Raw materials===
The above-mentioned fibrous material can either come from fresh (virgin) sources (e.g. wood) or from [[Paper recycling|recycled waste paper]]. Around 90% of virgin paper is made from [[timber|wood]] pulp.&lt;ref name="ind"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Today paperboard packaging in general, and especially products from [[ecolabel|certified]] [[sustainability|sustainable]] sources, are receiving new attention, as manufacturers dealing with environmental, health, and regulatory issues look to [[renewable resources]] to meet increasing demand. It is now mandatory in many countries for paper-based packaging to be manufactured wholly or partially from [[recycling|recycled]] material.
 
Raw materials include:

* '''[[Hardwood]]:''' C. {{convert|0.05|in|mm}} in length e.g. [[Birch]] which has short fibres. It is generally more difficult to work with; however, it does provide higher tensile strength, but lower tear and other strength properties. Although its fibres are not as long and strong as those in softwood, they make for a stiffer product defined by some stifness tests.  Hardwood fibres fill the sheet better and therefore make a smoother paper that is more opaque and better for printing.  Hardwood makes an excellent corrugating medium.
*'''[[Softwood]]:''' C.  {{convert|0.13|in|mm}} in length e.g. [[Pine]] and [[spruce]] which have typically long fibres and make superior paperboard in services where strength is important.  Softwood makes excellent linerboard.
* '''[[Deinked pulp|Recycled]]:''' Used paper is collected and sorted and usually mixed with virgin fibres in order to make new material. This is necessary as the recycled fibre often loses strength when reused; the added virgin fibres enhance strength. Mixed waste paper is not usually [[Deinking|deinked]] (skipping the deinking stage) for paperboard manufacture and hence the [[pulping|pulp]] may contain traces of inks, adhesives, and other residues which together give it a grey colour. Products made of recycled board usually have a less predictable composition and poorer functional properties than virgin fibre-based boards.&lt;ref name="igg"&gt;{{Cite journal

* '''[[Tree-free paper|Others]]''': It is also possible to use the fibres of [[Bagasse|Sugarcane Bagasse]], [[Straw]], [[Hemp]], [[Cotton]], [[Flax]], [[Kenaf]], [[Abaca]] and other plant products

===Pulping===
{{Main article|Pulp (paper)}}
Two principal methods for extracting fibres from their sources are:

* '''[[Chemical pulp]]ing''' uses chemical solutions to convert wood into pulp, yielding around 30% less than mechanical pulping; however, pulp made by the kraft process has superior strength
* '''[[Thermo mechanical pulp]]''' is a two-stage process which results in a very high yield of wood fibres at the expense of strength.

====Bleaching====
{{Main article|Bleaching of wood pulp}}
Pulp used in the manufacture of paperboard can be [[bleaching of wood pulp|bleached]] to decrease colour and increase purity. Virgin fibre pulp is naturally brown in colour, because of the presence of [[lignin]]. Recycled paperboard may contain traces of [[ink]]s, [[Adhesive|bonding agents]] and other residue which colors it grey.
Although [[bleaching of wood pulp|bleaching]] is not necessary for all end-uses, it is vital for many graphical and packaging purposes. There are various methods of [[bleaching of wood pulp|bleaching]], which are used according to a number of factors for example, the degree of colour change required, chemicals chosen and method of treatment. There are three categories of [[bleaching of wood pulp|bleaching methods]]:

* Bleaching by '''delignification''' using [[chlorine gas]], which is a method that has been largely replaced by procedures which are gentler to the environment such as the use of oxygen as a replacement for the chlorine gas.	
* Bleaching by '''[[oxidation]]''' using chemicals such as [[chlorine dioxide]], [[hydrogen peroxide]] or [[sodium hypochlorite]].
* Bleaching by '''[[redox|reduction]]''' using chemicals such as [[sodium bisulphite]].&lt;ref name="igg"/&gt;

===Plies===
[[Image:Single vs multiply.svg|thumb|100px|(1)&amp;nbsp;single-ply vs. (2)&amp;nbsp;multi-ply]]Multi-ply paperboard generally has higher creasing and folding performance than single-ply as a result of layering different types of pulp into a single product. In cases where the same kind of pulp is being used in several layers, each separate layer is treated and shaped individually in order to create the highest possible quality.&lt;ref name="igg"/&gt;

===Coating===
In order to improve whiteness, smoothness and gloss of paperboard, one or more layers of [[Coating and printing processes|coating]] is applied. [[Coated paper]] is usually made up of:

* a [[pigment]], which could be [[china clay]], [[calcium carbonate]] or [[titanium dioxide]], usually a combination of two
* an adhesive or binder as [[styrene-butadiene]] emulsions or [[starch]]es and [[water]].

Additional components could be OBA ([[optical brightener|optical brightening agent]]s).&lt;ref name="kir"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grades==
The [[Deutsches Institut für Normung|DIN]] Standard 19303 "Paperboard - Terms and grades" (Publication date : 2005-09) defines different grades of paperboard based on the surface treatment (first letter), the main furnish (second letter) and the colour (non-D grade) or bulk (D grade only) (numbering).

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! First letter&lt;br&gt;(surface treatment)

! Number
|-
|
* A = cast-coated
* G = pigment coated
* U = uncoated
| 
* Z = bleached virgin chemical pulp
* C = virgin mechanical pulp
* N = unbleached virgin chemical pulp
* T = recycled/secondary fibre with white, cream or brown reverse
* D = recycled/secondary fibre with grey back
| 
All except D grades:
# white reverse side
# cream reverse side
# brown  reverse side

D grades only:
# bulk ≥ 1.45&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/g
# 1.3&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/g&amp;nbsp;&lt; bulk &lt;&amp;nbsp;1.45&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/g
# bulk ≤ 1.3&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/g
|}

'''Example: '''  GC1 would be a "pigment coated", "virgin mechanical pulp" board with a "white reverse side". Often the used paperboard type would be FBB, which was coated on both sides.

==Common terms==
'''Basis Weight (US):''' Is the weight in {{convert|1000|sqft|m2}} of paperboard.

'''Brightness:''' Brightness is a technical term that is defined as the amount of blue-white light that a paper reflects.&lt;ref name="twe"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This property is very subjective and individual to each buyer and end use, as skin colour and food are better reproduced on ‘warm’ (yellow) whites and not blue whites.

'''Grammage:''' The [[grammage]] of the paperboard is assessed in accordance ISO 536.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  |author=ISO: International Organisation for Standardisation
  |year=1995
  |title=Paper and board -- Determination of grammage
  |accessdate=2009-07-18
  |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=20674}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Grammage expresses mass per unit area and is measured in g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="twe"/&gt;

'''PH:''' Surface [[pH]] is measured on a water extract and is on a scale of 0–14. 0 is [[acidic]], 7 is neutral and 14 is [[alkaline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Iggesund Paperboard |year=2008 |title=Product Catalogue: General Technical Information |accessdate=2009-07-18 |url=http://www.iggesund.com/Main.aspx?ID=d3f6ae98-6286-435d-bf6d-99a7ca881cab |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713004736/http://www.iggesund.com/Main.aspx?ID=d3f6ae98-6286-435d-bf6d-99a7ca881cab |archivedate=July 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stiffness:''' Stiffness is one of the most important properties of paperboard as it affects the ability of cartons to run smoothly through the machine that erects, fills and closes them. Stiffness also gives strength and reduces the propensity of a carton to bulge under the weight of settling flowable contents such as cereals.

Although most paper strength properties increase with increasing sheet density, stiffness does not.  A rule of thumb is that stiffness is proportional to the 1.6 power of sheet caliper.

The species of fiber used has an effect on stiffness, other things being equal.  Northern softwood species impart superior stiffness compared to southern softwoods.

Other factors which affect board stiffness include coatings and moisture content.&lt;ref name="twe"/&gt;

'''Smoothness:''' Smoothness is particularly important when being used for printing, the smoother the paperboard, the better the image quality,  because of better ink coverage. Smoothness is measured using air leak methods – the greater the rate of air leakage, at a specific air pressure, from under a cylindrical knife placed on the surface, the rougher the surface.&lt;ref name="twe"/&gt;

'''Caliper/Thickness:''' In the [[United States]] caliper is usually expressed in thousandths of an inch (0.001”) or points, where a sheet of paperboard with a thickness of 0.024” would be 24 points. In [[Europe]] it is often sold in g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, however the thickness of the board is measured in [[micron]] (μm).

Paperboard also tends to be referred to with thickness rather than weight.&lt;ref name="kir"/&gt;

'''Whiteness:''' It refers ideally to the equal presence of all colours, because a truly white sheet will reflect all [[wavelengths]] of visible light equally.&lt;ref name="twe"/&gt;

==Paperboard industry==

The paperboard sector is mainly looked at in conjunction with the paper industry. The Paper &amp; Paperboard market size (2007) had a value of 630.9 billion USD and a volume of 320.3 million metric tons.&lt;ref name="ind"/&gt; Of that market 40.1% is European. About 50% of all produced paper is used for packaging, followed by printing and writing.&lt;ref name="ind"/&gt; According to ProCarton, the consumption of paper and paperboard seem to correlate with economic trends (GDP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dr. Peter Ince |year=1999–2000 |title=Paper, Paperboard and Woodpulp – Production, Consumption and Trade ECE/FAO Forest Products Annual Market Review |accessdate=2009-07-18 |url=http://www.unece.org/timber/docs/rev-00/12.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605234531/http://www.unece.org/timber/docs/rev-00/12.pdf |archivedate=June 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Over 1,100 printers produce 5.4 million tonnes of cartonboard yearly. Cartons make up one third of paper and board packaging and 15% of all packaging. A bit more than half (54%) of the European carton is produced using recovered fibre or waste paper.
The paper and paperboard industry is quite energy and capital intensive. Just a coated board machine itself can cost around 90 - 120 million Euros&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

(about 125 - 166 million USD in 11/2011). Economies of scale apply, because of which a few large players often dominate the market place. E.g. in North America the top 5 producers have a market share of 85%.

  | title = About PLM
  | publisher = CIMdata
  | url = http://www.cimdata.com/plm.html
}}&lt;/ref&gt; software for managing product data. The software was engineered for the [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[UNIX]] operating systems. Along with core applications, it includes localized and web-based services. ProductCenter is suited for managing various types of [[CAx]] data, but it can be used for many forms of data management and product management.

==History==
ProductCenter is owned, supported and maintained by [[SofTech Group Inc.]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.softechgroupinc.com SofTech Group Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1990s ProductCenter was one of the earliest PDM/PLM engineering software programs known as CMS.  CMS was developed by Workgroup Technology Corporation (WTC) and was the first independent PDM/PLM solution to integrate with Pro/ENGINEER and Myriad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Workgroup+Technology+Announces+CMS+Integrator+for+Myriad-a020767937  Workgroup Technology Announces CMS Integrator for Myriad]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996 WTC's CMS software program was renamed to what is currently known as ProductCenter.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23719">[[File:Spartakiade.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Poster of the 2nd International Spartakiad of the Sportintern, held in Berlin in the Summer of 1931.]]
The '''International Association of Red Sports and Gymnastics Associations''', commonly known as '''Red Sport International (RSI)''' or '''Sportintern''' was a [[Comintern]]-supported international sports organization established in July 1921. The RSI was established in an effort to form a rival organization to already existing [[bourgeoisie|"bourgeois"]] and [[social democracy|social democratic]] international sporting groups. The RSI was part of a [[physical culture]] movement in [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet Russia]] linked to the physical training of young people prior to their enlistment in the military. The RSI held 3 summer games and 1 winter games called "[[Spartakiad]]" in competition with the [[Olympic games]] of the [[International Olympic Committee]] before being dissolved in 1937.

==Organizational history==

===Background===

The notion of a separate [[working class]] national athletic federation emerged first in Germany during the decade of the 1890s, when a [[Workers Gymnastics Association]] was established by activists in the [[socialism|socialist]] movement in opposition to the [[nationalism|nationalist]] [[German Gymnastics Society]] ''(Turnen).''&lt;ref name=RK107&gt;James Riordan and Arnd Krüger, ''The International Politics of Sport in the Twentieth Century.'' London: Routledge, 1999; pg. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; Other "proletarian" sports organizations emerged soon thereafter in that country, including the Solidarity Worker Cycling Club, the Friends of Nature Rambling Association, the Worker Swimming Association, the Free Sailing Association, and the [[Worker Track and Field Athletics Association]], among others.&lt;ref name=RK107 /&gt; By the time of [[World War I]], the German proletarian sports movement included more than 350,000 participants.&lt;ref name=RK107 /&gt;

Following the bloodbath of World War I, the German workers' sports movement began to reemerge, with a new competitive orientation beginning to take the place of individualistic club activities.&lt;ref name=RK107 /&gt; The international [[social democracy|social democratic]] movement also experienced a rebirth after its connections had been severed by war. In 1920 the social democrats established an International Association for Sports and Physical Culture, echoing its efforts in the pre-war period.&lt;ref name=RK107 /&gt; This organization was rechristened as the [[Socialist Workers' Sport International]] (SWSI) in 1925.&lt;ref name=RK107 /&gt;

In the aftermath of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] the international socialist movement divided into two antagonistic camps, socialist and [[communism|communist]] — a division exacerbated with the establishment of the [[Communist International]] (Comintern) in 1919. Parallel political organizations sprung up in every country and a state of bitter enmity prevailed.

===Establishment===
[[File:Podvoisky 1903.jpg|thumb|right|Nikolai Podvoisky, first head of the Red Sports International, as he appeared as a young man.]]
The idea of a rival Red Sport International (RSI) was the inspiration of [[Nikolai Podvoisky]], who at the [[2nd World Congress of the Comintern]] in the summer of 1920 discussed with a number of delegates from around the world the idea of establishing an organization to coordinate the physical training of youth.&lt;ref name=Carr8-957&gt;E.H. Carr, ''A History of Soviet Russia: Socialism in One Country, 1924-1926: Volume 3, Part 2.'' London: Macmillan, 1964; pg. 957.&lt;/ref&gt; Podvoisky, a military specialist in charge of Soviet Russia's military training organization, believed systematic physical training to be beneficial for the needs of the [[Red Army]] for healthy and fit youth in its ranks.&lt;ref name=Carr8-957 /&gt; An international sports organization was also seen as a potential ideological counterweight to the [[Olympic games]] of the "[[bourgeois]]" [[International Olympic Committee]] as well as the activities of the rival International Association for Sports and Physical Culture of the socialists.&lt;ref name=Carr8-958&gt;Carr, ''Socialism in One Country, 1924-1926,'' vol. 3, pt. 2, pg. 958.&lt;/ref&gt;

Podvoisky gathered interested delegates who were already in Moscow for the Comintern Congress and the group constituted itself a founding conference for an international sports organization.&lt;ref name=Carr8-957 /&gt; It is worthy of emphasis that the Comintern did not itself directly found the Red Sport International, the group being established through independent initiative and the Comintern being preoccupied with other affairs.&lt;ref&gt;André Gounot, [http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JSH/JSH2001/JSH2801/JSH2801d.pdf "Sport or Political Organization? Structures and Characteristics of the Red Sport International, 1921-1937,"] ''Journal of Sport History,'' vol. 28, no. 1 (Spring 2001), pg. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; The group issued a public manifesto declaring the establishment of a Red Sport International and elected a governing Executive Committee, consisting of representatives from Soviet Russia, Germany, [[Czechoslovakia]], France, Sweden, Italy, and [[Alsace-Lorraine]].&lt;ref name=Carr8-957 /&gt; Podvoisky was elected President of the new organization.&lt;ref name=Carr8-957 /&gt;

The establishment of an international sports organization in Soviet Russia in 1921 was not without its utopian elements, since no official Soviet sport organizations existed in famine stricken post-civil war Soviet Russia at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, ''Socialism in One Country, 1924-1926,'' vol. 3, pt. 2, pp. 957-958.&lt;/ref&gt; Germany, on the other hand, had a well-developed workers' sport movement at this time.&lt;ref name=Carr8-958 /&gt; Consequently, Sportintern from its outset maintained a strong German flavor and it was there in the city of [[Berlin]] that the 2nd Conference of the organization was held in July 1922.&lt;ref name=Carr8-958 /&gt; The only national "proletarian" sports organization to join the German group at that early date was the [[Czechoslovak Federation of Workers' Gymnastic Leagues]], said to represent 100,000 athletes.&lt;ref name=Carr8-958 /&gt;

The Comintern moved closer to the fledgling Sportintern in November 1922 when, in conjunction with the [[4th World Congress of the Comintern|4th World Congress]], the governing [[Executive Committee of the Communist International]] decided to name a representative to the "independent" proletarian sport organization.&lt;ref name=Carr8-958 /&gt; The [[Communist International of Youth]] (KIM) did not take action until the meeting of its governing Bureau in Moscow in July 1923, when it issued a general recommendation of support for the Sportintern and the national sports organizations affiliated to it as a useful "proletarian class instrument."&lt;ref name=Carr8-960&gt;Carr, ''Socialism in One Country, 1924-1926,'' vol. 3, pt. 2, pg. 960.&lt;/ref&gt; It did not, however, delve into the contentious issue of in what manner and to what extent these two international bodies should be related.&lt;ref name=Carr8-960 /&gt;

The governing Executive Committee of Sportintern met in Moscow in February 1923 and decided to establish a satellite bureau of the organization in Berlin, with a view to increasing participation among Western European workers' sports organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, ''Socialism in One Country, 1924-1926,'' vol. 3, pt. 2, pp. 960-961.&lt;/ref&gt; The maneuver proved successful in helping to build the organization, triggering a split of the French Workers Sports Federation later that year and the affiliation of 80% of its membership with the Red Sport International.&lt;ref name=Carr8-961&gt;Carr, ''Socialism in One Country, 1924-1926,'' vol. 3, pt. 2, pg. 961.&lt;/ref&gt; The RSI's increased place in the public eye motivated the governing body of the rival international socialist sports authority, meeting in [[Zurich]] in August 1923, to discuss issuing an invitation to Sportintern to help organize a joint "Workers' Olympiad" — a proposal which was narrowly defeated, despite indications that a majority of individual members of the socialist organization favored joint participation.&lt;ref name=Carr8-961 /&gt;

===End of autonomy===

In October 1924 the Red Sport International held its 3rd Congress in Moscow.&lt;ref name=Carr8-963&gt;Carr, ''Socialism in One Country, 1924-1926,'' vol. 3, pt. 2, pg. 963.&lt;/ref&gt; At this time the organization decided to enlarge its governing Executive Committee to include four members of the Executive Committee of the Communist International of Youth — an organization which saw the national affiliates of Sportintern as comprised overwhelmingly of young workers and sought to insert its influence in the organization.&lt;ref name=Carr8-963 /&gt; As the membership of Sportintern was formally "open to all proletarian elements which recognize the class struggle" it was not an explicitly communist organization, a situation which the KIM saw as a significant shortcoming.&lt;ref name=Carr8-963 /&gt;

The RSI was a large and growing organization in this interval, with some 2 million affiliated members in the Soviet Union, joined by others sections in Germany, Czechoslovakia, France, Norway, Italy, Finland, Switzerland, the United States, [[Estonia]], Bulgaria, and [[Uruguay]].&lt;ref&gt;Carr, ''Socialism in One Country, 1924-1926,'' vol. 3, pt. 2, pp. 963-964.&lt;/ref&gt; As the size of the organization grew, so, too, did pressure to bring the organization's [[ideology|ideological]] character under tighter centralized Communist Party control.

Nikolai Podvoisky was himself a voice for such an insertion of such ideological hegemony, declaring in a lengthy speech to the [[5th Enlarged Plenum of the Comintern]], held in the spring of 1925, that Sportintern should henceforth adopt as its motto:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Convert sport and gymnastics into a weapon of the class revolutionary struggle, concentrate the attention of workers and peasants on sport and gymnastics as one of the best instruments, methods, and weapons for their class organization and struggle."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Carr, Carr, ''Socialism in One Country, 1924-1926,'' vol. 3, pt. 2, pg. 963.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the same time the international communist movement moved to further politicize the RSI, efforts were made to make political hay over the refusal of the Socialist Workers' Sport International to conduct joint activities, such as its decision to bar the Red Sport International from participation at the July 1925 "Workers' Olympiad" held in Frankfurt under its auspices.&lt;ref name=Carr8-965&gt;Carr, ''Socialism in One Country, 1924-1926,'' vol. 3, pt. 2, pg. 965.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in this period, 1924 to 1925, that the Red Sport International effectively became an auxiliary of the Communist International.&lt;ref&gt;Gounot, "Sport or Political Organization?" pg. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; This control was effected by the subordinate youth section of the Comintern, the Communist International of Youth, although the Comintern reserved for itself ultimate authority to decide issues of great importance.&lt;ref name=Gounot27&gt;Gounot, "Sport or Political Organization?" pg. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; As the Comintern was itself in the process of being absorbed as an instrument of Soviet foreign policy in this interval, the RSI likewise gradually lost its ability to function independently as an international entity.&lt;ref name=Gounot27 /&gt;

In the words of French sports historian André Gounot:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"...The RSI's dependence on the Comintern was accompanied, almost inevitably, by the Soviet section's dominance within the RSI. The interests of the Soviet Union and Soviet sport were decisive factors in the RSI's decisions and actions — even if, as was frequently the case, they were incompatible with those of European worker sport."&lt;ref name=Gounot27 /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The last International Congress of the Red Sport International came in 1928 and was marked by no serious discussion of contemporary sporting issues.&lt;ref name=Gounot28&gt;Gounot, "Sport or Political Organization?" pg. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead the 1928 gathering consisted of a mechanical attempt to apply the Comintern's ultra-radical [[Third Period]] slogan of "Class versus Class" and its corollary theory of [[social fascism]] to world sport — splitting the fissure between the two camps of the European workers' sport movement wider than ever.&lt;ref name=Gounot28 /&gt;

===Social composition===

Membership of the various national sections of the Red Sport International was by no means monolithic. According to the RSI's own study of the issue, members of the organizations were predominantly male, but hailed from a variety of communist, socialist, [[syndicalism|syndicalist]], and [[anarchism|anarchist]] tendencies, including many of whom who were members of no party.&lt;ref name=IAS&gt;''Internationaler Arbeitersport: Zeitschrift für Fragen der internationalen revolutionären Arbeitersportbewegung.'' Aug. 1931, pg. 303. Quoted in Gounot, "Sport or Political Organization?" pg. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Although many of these were of the working class, also included were white collar employees, students, and government workers.&lt;ref name=IAS /&gt; Membership records of the French section, for example, indicate that approximately 80% of participants were from the working class, with the remaining 20% members of other social groups.&lt;ref&gt;Gounot, "Sport or Political Organization?" pg. 38, fn. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

No details exist for the exact Communist Party membership of any national section of the RSI, although in the considered opinion of a leading historian on the topic, "it is safe to assume that this group represented a minority of the whole membership of each section."&lt;ref name=Gounot29&gt;Gounot, "Sport or Political Organization?" pg. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The Czechoslovakian federation, thought to include the largest Communist Party contingent from outside the USSR, is believed to have included something in the range of 20 to 30% who were members of the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref name=Gounot29 /&gt;

The fact that members of other parties or no parties participated in the national sections of the Red Sport International is testimony to the limited impact that RSI programmatic rhetoric had upon grassroots participants.&lt;ref name=Gounot29 /&gt; It was rather the fun and excitement of training and competition that bound together local groups and their national units more than ideological proclivities.&lt;ref name=Gounot29 /&gt; The difference in perception of the organization between its rank-and-file participants and the Moscow dominated leadership of the organization has led one scholar to conclude that the RSI was a "split organization, living in two universes," bureaucratic in political discourse but remaining well within the less intense social democratic workers' sports tradition at the individual club level.&lt;ref name=Gounot35&gt;Gounot, "Sport or Political Organization?" pg. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; In this view politics was merely a piece of a broader participatory sports movement.&lt;ref name=Gounot35 /&gt;

===International competitions===

The international workers' sports organizations of the socialist and communist movements did not necessarily object to some of the most noble goals of the International Olympic Committee (IOC),&lt;ref name=RK109&gt;Riordan and Krüger, ''The International Politics of Sport in the Twentieth Century,'' pg. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; but they did each share fundamental reservations about the modern Olympic games that were the inspiration of [[Pierre de Coubertin|Baron Pierre de Coubertin]], a hereditary French nobleman.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher R. Hill, ''Olympic Politics: Athens to Atlanta, 1896-1996.'' Manchester, England: Manchester University Press, 1996; pg. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; First and foremost, the Olympics of the IOC stressed competition between nations — regarded by the radicals as a manifestation of national [[chauvinism]].&lt;ref name=RK109 /&gt; Rather than the accentuation of national rivalry and patriotic feeling, international competition should focus on the actual athletic effort in a setting designed to build the ethic of [[internationalism (politics)|internationalism]], both the socialists and communists agreed.&lt;ref name=RK109 /&gt;

The IOC games also were based upon rigid entrance standards, while the international festivals of the worker athletic movement instead attempted to build mass participation through pageantry, artistic and cultural activities, and unifying political presentations.&lt;ref name=RK109 /&gt; Moreover, the sort of athletes dominating the IOC games were objectionable to the radicals on the basis of [[social class]], dominated as they were by the privileged children of the rural aristocracy and the bourgeoisie.&lt;ref name=RK109 /&gt; Such international competitions should be open to the participation of less privileged national and social groups, without distinction to race or creed, in the view of the radical sports organizations.&lt;ref name=RK109 /&gt;

Therefore, the Red Sport International and its socialist rival, the organization emerging as the Socialist Workers' Sport International, conducted a series of their own workers' sports festivals in distinction to and competition with the Olympiads of the IOC. Four such events (called Spartakiads in honor of the heroic slave leader, [[Spartacus]]) were sponsored by the RSI. Two of these were held in 1928,  and one each in 1931 and 1937.

While a major national workers' sport festival had already been held in Czechoslovakia in 1921, it was the socialist organization in 1925 that conducted the first pair of Workers' Olympics events — Summer Games in Frankfurt attracting 150,000 spectators and competitors from 19 country, and Winter Games in Schreiberhau (today's [[Szklarska Poręba]], Poland), attended by athletes from 12 countries.&lt;ref name=RK110&gt;Riordan and Krüger, ''The International Politics of Sport in the Twentieth Century,'' pg. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; No national flags or anthems graced the closing or opening ceremonies, replaced instead by universal use of the [[red flag (politics)|red flag]] and singing of "[[The Internationale]]."&lt;ref name=RK110 /&gt; "Soviet and other communist athletes were excluded from these games, however, and there was therefore little actual unity of the workers' sports movement for all the universalist pageantry employed.

From the middle 1930s the political line of the world communist movement changed. The so-called [[Popular Front]] against the threat of [[fascism]] rendered cooperation with socialists and others through unified workers' athletic festivals not only a possibility but the tactical order of the day. Plans were laid for a so-called 3rd Workers' Olympiad to be held in [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], Spain in June 1936, under joint auspices of the RSI and the SWSI. The time and place proved inauspicious, however, coinciding with outbreak of hostilities in the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref name=RK113&gt;Riordan and Krüger, ''The International Politics of Sport in the Twentieth Century,'' pg. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; This forced postponement of the event, which was rescheduled for the next summer in [[Antwerp]], Belgium.&lt;ref name=RK113 /&gt;

The 3rd Workers' Olympiad proved to be less successful than previous endeavors, but it still managed to attract 27,000 participating athletes, and put 50,000 people in the stadium for the final day of competition.&lt;ref name=RK113 /&gt; An estimated 200,000 people turned out for the traditional closing parade through the city.&lt;ref name=RK113 /&gt;

===Dissolution===

With the Soviet Union becoming immersed in the first months of 1937 in a massive and [[xenophobia|xenophobic]] secret police campaign against perceived underground [[espionage|espionage networks]] remembered as the [[Great Purge|Great Terror]], the Red Sport International was summarily dissolved by the Comintern in April of that year.

== Career ==
Mahboob founded the Afghan Citadel Software Company (ACSC) in 2010 along with two Herat University classmates and an investment of $20,000.&lt;ref name=DailyBeast /&gt; The aim was to create jobs for recent university graduates—especially women—in Afghanistan's growing tech market.&lt;ref name=RFERLRoya&gt;{{cite news|last=Bezhan|first=Frud|title=In Male-Dominated World, Afghan Businesswoman Breaks Boundaries, Taboos|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/afghan-businesswoman-hopes-to-inspire-change/24787576.html|accessdate=7 December 2012|newspaper=Radio Free Europe Radio Liberty}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company employs at least 20 programmers, more than half of which are women.&lt;ref name=RFERLRoya /&gt;

ACSC develops software according to specific requirements that are defined by clients, which are government ministries, universities, and international organizations in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=RFERLRoya /&gt; It also creates proprietary stand-alone or integrated applications for computers and mobile phones, based on market needs and identified opportunities. Past projects include helping a Herat hospital to shift from paper to digital records&lt;ref name=DailyBeast /&gt; as well as helping to bring reliable internet to Herat University as part of [[NATO]]'s Silk Afghanistan project.&lt;ref name=NATOopposition /&gt;&lt;ref name=NATOsilk&gt;{{cite news|title=Internet access is changing teaching methods in Afghanistan|url=http://www.nato.int/cps/en/SID-4DAF6EE4-DAE176D6/natolive/news_75175.htm?|accessdate=27 September 2012|newspaper=NATO's News|date=8 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Citadel of New York was founded to develop and promote Examer, an Interactive and Educational Social Networking platform with a Micro Scholarship Payment System, which Mahboob helped to develop.&lt;ref name=Examer&gt;{{cite web|title=Examer Software by Citadel of New York|url=http://capitalpartners.filmannex.com/examer-software/|work=Film Annex Capital Partners|publisher=Film Annex Capital Partners|accessdate=25 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121007053515/http://capitalpartners.filmannex.com/examer-software|archivedate=7 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another project resulting from this partnership, Women's Annex, also provides financing for video content on social media and gives Afghan women a chance to begin careers as filmmakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Op-Ed: Billions of Women on This Planet Have Stories to Tell—So Listen Up|url=http://www.takepart.com/article/2013/02/04/op-ed-empowering-women-through-filmmaking-and-online-film-distribution|publisher=Take Part|accessdate=5 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130207124341/http://www.takepart.com/article/2013/02/04/op-ed-empowering-women-through-filmmaking-and-online-film-distribution|archivedate=7 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citadel of New York acquired a ten percent equity position in Afghanistan’s Esteqlal Football Club in October 2012.&lt;ref name=FAFootball&gt;{{cite web|title=Film Annex Acquires Equity Position in Afghanistan’s Esteqlal Football Club|url=http://www.filmannex.com/posts/blog_show_post/film-annex-acquires-equity-position-in-afghanistans-esteqlal-football-club/57090|work=Film Annex Blog|publisher=www.filmannex.com|accessdate=7 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130102204122/http://www.filmannex.com/posts/blog_show_post/film-annex-acquires-equity-position-in-afghanistans-esteqlal-football-club/57090|archivedate=2 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Mahboob joined the [http://www.globalthinkersforum.org/board-of-advisors/ Advisory Board] of the international think tank [http://www.globalthinkersforum.org Global Thinkers Forum].

==Notability==
Mahboob has received recognition for being a female CEO in a country where women largely do not work outside the home. She has received threats for starting and running a business, staffing her company primarily with women, doing business with foreigners, even driving a car.&lt;ref name=NATOopposition /&gt;&lt;ref name=FastCompany&gt;{{cite news|last=Lemmon|first=Gayle Tzemach|title=In The Heart Of Afghanistan, Entrepreneurs Innovate For Peace|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/3001733/heart-afghanistan-entrepreneurs-innovate-peace|accessdate=15 October 2012|newspaper=Fast Company|date=15 Oct 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roya's reaction to this has been, "You have to show everybody that men and women are equal.

Mahboob has also partnered with [[Film Annex]], an online film distribution platform and Web Television Network, to launch the Afghan Development Project in 2012.

On 18 November 2013, Senator John Kerry wrote an essay for Politico, detailing his experience meeting Roya Mahboob, CEO of the software development firm Citadel as well as the current changes being led by Afghan women in a variety of social areas.  Kerry’s essay discusses how Afghani women, and Roya Mahboob in particular, are changing not only Afghanistan but also the global community. Senator Kerry details specifically how Mahboob’s contributions to Afghani society and the global community are having far reaching impacts. While on the global landscape, Afghanistan still has much work to do, Senator Kerry indicates Mahboob’s success as one key female figure is a great step toward bringing about lasting peace and prosperity. "Afghan women aren’t stopping. They’re marching forward, and we all need to march with them."

The essay was written as part of a series, and is a collaboration between Politico, Google &amp; the Tory Burch Foundation, titled Women Rule.&lt;ref name="Women Rule: Afghan Women on the March"&gt;{{cite web|title=Women Rule: Afghan Women on the March|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2013/11/john-kerry-afghan-women-roya-mahboob-99969.html|publisher=Politico|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shōzō Makino.jpg|thumb|Shōzō Makino sometime in the 1920s.]]
'''Shōzō Makino''' (マキノ省三, ''Makino Shōzō'', September 22, 1878, [[Kyoto]] – July 25, 1929) was a [[Japan]]ese [[film director]], [[film producer]] and businessman who is regarded as a pioneering director of [[Cinema of Japan|Japanese film]].{{cn|date=January 2013}} In addition, all four of his sons, including [[Masahiro Makino]] and [[Sadatsugu Matsuda]], went into the film business as either directors or producers, and his grandchildren include the actors [[Masahiko Tsugawa]] and [[Hiroyuki Nagato]]. Actress [[Yoko Minamida]] is a granddaughter-in-law.

==Career==
Makino was born in [[Kyoto]] on September 22, 1878.  His mother ran a theater{{Clarify|date=March 2013}}, and his association with movies began when the motion picture producer [[Einosuke Yokota]] of [[Yokota Shōkai]] asked for his help in filming [[jidaigeki|period films]]. Shozo discovered actor [[Matsunosuke Onoe]] working in an itinerant [[kabuki]] troupe and enlisted him into becoming Japan's first film star. He directed over 60 Matsunosuke films a year in the early 1910s, most if not all short films. 

In addition to creating the unique genre of the Japanese period film,{{Clarify|date=March 2013}} Makino also incorporated trick camera techniques and a myriad of other cinematic methods of expression into his films.{{cn|date=January 2013}} In 1919, he founded the [[Mikado Company]] and began to produce educational films. He later founded an independent production company, [[Makino Film Productions]], and from 1923, continued as a director and as producer. Makino Film Productions turned out many successful movies also made by several other directors and actors.{{cn|date=January 2013}}{{Clarify|date=March 2013}} 

In 1928, he directed the epic, ''[[Jitsuroku Chushingura]]'' (''True Record of the Forty-Seven Ronin''), which coincided with his 50th birthday. He died on July 25, 1929.

==Family==

He had a total of five children. Two of his sons, [[Sadatsugu Matsuda]] (1906–2003) and [[Masahiro Makino]] (1908–1993) were also film directors. Another, [[Mitsuo Makino]], was a film producer, and another [[Shinzō Makino]], also worked as a director (his wife was the actress [[Chikako Miyagi]]). Masahiro married the actress [[Yukiko Todoroki]] and their son, [[Masayuki Makino]], is the head of the [[Okinawa Actor's School]]. Shōzō's daughter, [[Tomoko Makino]], married the actor [[Kunitarō Sawamura]], and is the mother to actors [[Masahiko Tsugawa]] and [[Hiroyuki Nagato]], both of whom married famous actresses, [[Yukiji Asaoka]] and [[Yōko Minamida]] respectively. Kunitarō's brother and sister are the actors [[Daisuke Katō]] and [[Sadako Sawamura]].

'''Supercapitalism''' was a concept that developed in [[Italian Fascism]].&lt;ref&gt;Mussolini, Benito. ''Four speeches on the corporate state: with an appendix including the labour charter, the text of laws on syndical and corporate organisations and explanatory notes''. Laboremus, 1935. Pp. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Italy's Fascist leader, [[Benito Mussolini]], claimed that at the stage of supercapitalism, "a capitalist enterprise, when difficulties arise, throws itself like a dead weight into the state's arms. It is then that state intervention begins and becomes more necessary. It is then that those who once ignored the state now seek it out anxiously."&lt;ref&gt;Mussolini, Benito; Schnapp, Jeffery Thompson (ed.); Sears, Olivia E. (ed.); Stampino, Maria G. (ed.). "Address to the National Corporative Council (14 November 1933) and Senate Speech on the Bill Establishing the Corporations (abridged; 13 January 1934)". ''A Primer of Italian Fascism''. University of Nebraska Press, 2000. p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; To Mussolini, the [[capitalism]] of his time had degenerated from original capitalism, which he called dynamic or [[heroic capitalism]] (1830–1870) to static capitalism (1870–1914) and then finally to [[Decadence|decadent]] capitalism or supercapitalism, which began in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Falasca-Zamponi. Pp. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, [[Benito Mussolini]] declared Italian Fascism's opposition to supercapitalism. 

Mussolini thought of the Marxist socialist system in terms of State Supercapitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Mussolini, Benito. ''Four speeches on the corporate state: with an appendix including the labour charter, the text of laws on syndicalist and corporate organizations and explanatory notes''. Laboremus, 1935.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mussolini there were four types of state intervention, the first one was the one of the liberal states, this is the most used in supercapitalism, in most cases being a disorganized and sporadic intervention. The second one was the one used by communists in its State Supercapitalism. And the third one was the one used in the US which he considered as a combination of the first two State Intervention systems. 

Mussolini argued that although Italian Fascism did not support dynamic and heroic capitalism, he appreciated it for its contribution to [[industrialism]] and technical developments but claimed that he did not support or appreciate supercapitalism, which he claimed was incompatible with Italy's agricultural sector.&lt;ref&gt;Falasca-Zamponi. 2000. Pp. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini strongly criticized this stage of supercapitalism, saying:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
At this stage, supercapitalism finds its inspiration and its justification in a utopia: the utopia of unlimited consumption. Supercapitalism's ideal is the standardization of the human race from the cradle to the grave. Supercapitalism wants all babies to be born exactly the same length so that the cradles can be standardized and all children persuaded to like the same toys. It wants all men to don the very same uniform, to read the same book, to have the same tastes in films, and to desire the same so-called labor-saving devices. This is not the result of caprice. It inheres in the logic of events, for only thus can supercapitalism make its plans.&lt;ref&gt;Mussolini, Benito; Schnapp, Jeffery Thompson (ed.); Sears, Olivia E. (ed.); Stampino, Maria G. (ed.). "Address to the National Corporative Council (14 November 1933) and Senate Speech on the Bill Establishing the Corporations (abridged; 13 January 1934)". ''A Primer of Italian Fascism''. University of Nebraska Press, 2000. Pp. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''TI-HI''', '''Ti-High''', '''Tie-High''', or '''Ti by Hi''' is a term often used in the [[logistics]] industry.

It refers to the number of [[box]]es/cartons stored on a layer, or tier, (the TI) and the number of layers high that these will be stacked on the [[pallet]] (the HI).&lt;ref&gt;[http://toolboxes.flexiblelearning.net.au/demosites/series2/213/content_sections/a13/unpack/ti_hi.htm http://toolboxes.flexiblelearning.net.au/demosites/series2/213/content_sections/a13/unpack/ti_hi.htm] ''Virtual Warehose''&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be used in reference to the stacking pattern used to load a pallet in order to generate a relatively stable stack.

These measurements will usually be asked for following the Cube (cubic feet) of a Master Carton.

Some manufacturers design and stack boxes/cartons on pallets in non-standard Ti-Hi patterns. This stacking pattern does not compute logically to TI-HI applications. Pallets with non-standard Ti-Hi are unconventional.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2718">A '''Teardrop turn''' is a method of reversing the course of an [[aircraft]] or vessel so that it returns on its original path, travelling in the opposite direction, and passes through a specified point on the original path.&lt;ref name=AIM&gt;{{cite book|last=Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)|title=Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM)|year=2012|publisher=Aviation Supplies &amp; Academics, Inc.|location=US|isbn=978-1560279273|page=5-4-9-a-4|url=http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim/aim0504.html#aim0504.html.28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Concept ==
The teardrop turn has been described as a difficult maneuver which provides little margin for error.&lt;ref name="Flying teardrop"&gt;{{cite news|last=Garrison|first=Peter|title=Teardrop Turn|url=http://www.flyingmag.com/safety/accident-investigations/teardrop-turn?page=0,1|work=[[Flying (magazine)|Flying Magazine]]|publisher=|date=1 September 2008|accessdate=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The name comes from the overhead view of the track, which resembles an idealized teardrop. [[Ship]]s and power [[boat]]s generally use one of two types of teardrop turn to recover a [[man overboard]]: the [[Man overboard rescue turn#Williamson turn|Williamson turn]] &lt;ref name=Sail-World&gt;{{cite web|last=Jamieson|first=John|title=Short-Handed Man-Overboard Maneuver - the 'Williamson Turn'|url=http://www.sail-world.com/index.cfm?nid=94234|work=Sail-World.com|publisher=TetraMedia Pty.

[[Brigadier]] '''Toby Austin Richard William Low, 1st Baron Aldington''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100|sep=,|KCMG|CBE|DSO|TD|PC|DL}} (25 May 1914 – 7 December 2000), known as '''Austin Richard William Low''' until he added 'Toby' as a forename by [[deed poll]] on 10 July 1957,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=41128 |page=4265 |date=16 July 1957 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was a British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] politician and businessman.

He was however best known for his alleged role in [[Operation Keelhaul]], the forced repatriation of Russian, Ukrainian and other prisoners of war to the Soviet Union where many were executed. After he was accused of [[war crime]]s, he successfully sued his accusers for libel.&lt;ref name=TelegraphObit/&gt;

==Life==
He was the son of Colonel Stuart Low, who died in action in 1942, and Lucy Atkin, daughter of the [[James Atkin, Baron Atkin|Lord Atkin]]. He was educated at [[Winchester College]]&lt;ref name=TelegraphObit&gt;{{cite web|title=Lord Aldington (obituary)|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1377426/Lord-Aldington.html|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=16 January 2015|date=8 December 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; (where he later became Warden, i.e. chairman of the governing body), and at [[New College, Oxford]] where he studied law. He qualified as a [[barrister]] in 1939.&lt;ref name=TelegraphObit/&gt;

He had joined the Rangers ([[King's Royal Rifle Corps]]), a famous London Territorial Infantry Regiment, in 1934 and served in [[World War II]] in Greece, [[Crete]], [[Egypt]], [[Libya]], [[Tunisia]], Italy and [[Austria]], becoming the youngest [[Brigadier]] in the British Army in 1944. He was appointed to the [[Distinguished Service Order]] in 1941, made a Commander of the [[Legion of Merit]] (US) and awarded the [[Croix de guerre 1939–1945|Croix de Guerre]].&lt;ref name=TelegraphObit/&gt;

Low stood for Parliament as a Conservative in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 general election]], and won the seat of [[Blackpool North (UK Parliament constituency)|Blackpool North]].&lt;ref name=TelegraphObit/&gt; He served as [[Parliamentary Secretary]] at the [[Ministry of Supply]] 1951–54 and [[Minister of State]] at the [[Board of Trade]] from 1954, becoming a [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Counsellor]].&lt;ref name=TelegraphObit/&gt;

In 1957, he was knighted and became chair of the [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|Select Committee]] on nationalised industry. In 1959, he became deputy Conservative Party chairman. In 1962 he was created '''Baron Aldington''', of Bispham in the County Borough of Blackpool, and increased his business interests, serving as the chairman of several companies. He had been a director of the Grindlay family banking company, [[Grindlays Bank]], in 1946, following his father and grandfather.

In 1964, Lord Aldington became Chairman of the bank as well as of [[General Electric Company plc|GEC]].&lt;ref name=TelegraphObit/&gt; In 1971, he joined the [[BBC]] general advisory council,&lt;!--not in Telegraph Obit--&gt; and became chairman of [[Royal &amp; SunAlliance|Sun-Alliance]] and the [[Port of London Authority]].&lt;ref name=TelegraphObit/&gt; In 1972, he became co-chairman, with [[Jack Jones (trade union leader)|Jack Jones]], of the joint special committee on the ports industry. He became chairman of [[Westland Helicopters|Westland]] in 1977.

Lord Aldington was considered a [[One Nation Conservative]] and supported British involvement in the [[European Union]]. He continued political activities in the [[House of Lords]], including as chairman of the Lords' [[Select Committee on Overseas Trade|select committee on overseas trade]]. He was also a Deputy Lieutenant of [[Kent]].

In 1999, when hereditary peers were excluded from the House of Lords by the [[House of Lords Act 1999]], as a hereditary peer of first creation he was granted a [[life peerage]] as '''Baron Low''', of Bispham in the County of Lancashire, so that he could remain.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=55672 |page=12349 |date=19 November 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Aldington married (Felicité Ann) Araminta MacMichael (d.2012) (a daughter of [[Harold MacMichael|Sir Harold MacMichael]]) on 10 April 1947. They had two daughters, [[Jane Roberts, Lady Roberts|Priscilla Jane Stephanie, Lady Roberts]], Lucy Ann Anthea, and a son, [[Charles Low, 2nd Baron Aldington]].&lt;ref name=TelegraphObit/&gt;

Lady Aldington was Patron of the [[Jacob sheep|Jacob Sheep Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lady Aldington |url=http://www.jacobsheepsociety.co.uk/lady_aldington.htm |publisher=Jacob Sheep Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Libel case==
In 1989 Lord Aldington initiated and won a record £1.5 million (plus £500,000 costs) in a [[libel]] case against [[Nikolai Tolstoy]] and Nigel Watts, who had accused him of [[war crimes]] in Austria during his involvement in the [[Betrayal of the Cossacks]] at [[Lienz]], part of [[Operation Keelhaul]] at the end of the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref name=TelegraphObit/&gt; Tolstoy had written several books (''[[Victims of Yalta]]'' in 1977, ''Stalin's Secret War'' in 1981, ''[[The Minister and the Massacres]]'' in 1986) about the alleged complicity of British politicians and officers with [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s forces in the murder of White Russian exiles from Soviet Rule, [[Cossack]]s, Croatian paramilitaries and collaborationist fugitives from Tito, as well as 11,000 Slovenian anticommunist fighters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ithaca.edu/hs/depts/history/docs/histjourndocs/spring04/slovene.pdf|title=The Story of forced repatriation of Slovenes After World War II|work=ithaca.edu|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402213015/http://www.ithaca.edu/hs/depts/history/docs/histjourndocs/spring04/slovene.pdf|archivedate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nigel Watts, who was in a business dispute with one of Lord Aldington's former companies, used this information to further his own cause, printing 10,000 leaflets about Aldington's role in the matter and circulating them to politicians and other figures.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/dec/09/guardianobituaries.obituaries|work=The Guardian|location=London|title=Lord Aldington|date=9 December 2000|accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tolstoy avoided paying the damages by declaring himself bankrupt,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; although after Aldington's death he paid £57,000 in costs to Aldington's estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Alleyne|first=Richard|title=Tolstoy pays £57,000 to Aldington's estate|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1377581/Tolstoy-pays-57000-to-Aldingtons-estate.html|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=9 December 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The damages awarded were criticised by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in July 1995 as excessive and ''"not necessary in a democratic society"'', although this did not overturn the ruling itself or affect the amount to be paid out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zMs6T2csv-AC&amp;pg=PA335&amp;lpg=PA335&amp;dq=Lord+Aldington+e+European+Court+of+Human+Rights.&amp;source=web&amp;ots=GYPdUbHZFK&amp;sig=IWLqyis4J2sVQcPoHHzepXckVmc&amp;hl=en|title=Modern Tort Law 6/e|work=google.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, allegations were made that Aldington had been materially assisted by friends at the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]], who had suppressed crucial documentation, but Tolstoy and Watts were not granted leave to appeal on the basis of those findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guttenplan|first=David|title=The Holocaust on Trial: History, Justice and the David Irving Libel Case|date=2002|publisher=Granta|location=London|isbn=1-86207-486-0|pages=269–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nigel Watts was jailed for 18 months in April 1995, after repeating the libel that Aldington was a [[war criminal]] in a pamphlet.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In 1996 the Court of Appeal upheld an order Aldington had obtained that made lawyers acting for Tolstoy [[pro bono]] parties to the case, and thereby jointly liable with Tolstoy for any costs or damages awarded to Aldington. This order was combined with a requirement that Tolstoy underwrite the cost of Aldington's defence to obtain leave to appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hrothgar.co.uk/YAWS/frmreps/floods.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020128011146/http://www.hrothgar.co.uk/YAWS/frmreps/floods.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=28 January 2002|title=Floods of Queensferry Ltd v Shand Construction Ltd (YAWS version 34.1)|date=21 February 2004|work=hrothgar.co.uk|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Competition law}}
'''Tying''' (informally, '''product tying''') is the practice of selling one product or service as a mandatory addition to the purchase of a different product or service. In legal terms, a ''tying sale'' makes the sale of one [[Good (economics)|good]] (the ''tying good'') to the [[de facto]] customer (or [[de jure]] customer) conditional on the purchase of a second distinctive good (the ''tied good''). Tying is often illegal when the products are not naturally related. It is related to but distinct from [[freebie marketing]], a common (and legal) method of giving away (or selling at a substantial discount) one item to ensure a continual flow of sales of another related item.

Some kinds of tying, especially by [[contract]], have historically been regarded as [[anti-competitive practices]]. The basic idea is that consumers are harmed by being forced to buy an undesired good (the tied good) in order to purchase a good they actually want (the tying good), and so would prefer that the goods be sold separately. The company doing this [[product bundling|bundling]] may have a significantly large market share so that it may impose the tie on consumers, despite the forces of market competition. The tie may also harm other companies in the market for the tied good, or who sell only single components.

One effect of tying can be that low quality products achieve a higher market share than would otherwise be the case.

Tying may also be a form of [[price discrimination]]: people who use more razor blades, for example, pay more than those who just need a one-time shave. Though this may improve overall welfare, by giving more consumers access to the market, such price discrimination can also transfer consumer surpluses to the producer. Tying may also be used with or in place of [[patent]]s or [[copyright]]s to help protect entry into a market, discouraging innovation.

Tying is often used when the supplier makes one product that is critical to many customers. By threatening to withhold that key product unless others are also purchased, the supplier can increase sales of less necessary products.

In the [[United States]], most [[U.S. state|states]] have laws against tying, which are enforced by state governments. In addition, the [[U.S.&amp;nbsp;Department of Justice]] enforces federal laws against tying through its [[United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division|Antitrust Division]].

==Types==
'''Horizontal tying''' is the practice of requiring consumers to pay for an unrelated product or service together with the desired one.&lt;ref name=horizvert&gt;{{cite web|title=Tying|url=http://www.whitecollarfirm.com/CM/Custom/Tying-Antitrust-Defense-Attorneys.asp|publisher=The Blanch Law Firm|accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A hypothetical example would be for [[Société Bic|Bic]] to sell its pens only with Bic lighters. (However, a company may offer a limited free item with another purchase as a promotion.)

'''Vertical tying''' is the practice of requiring customers to purchase related products or services together, from the same company.&lt;ref name=horizvert /&gt; For example, a company might mandate that its automobiles could only be serviced by its own dealers. In an effort to curb this, many jurisdictions require that warranties not be voided by outside servicing; for example, see the [[Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act]] in the United States.

==In United States law==
Certain tying arrangements are illegal in the [[United States]] under both the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]],&lt;ref&gt;''See'' ''N. Pac. Ry Co. v. United States'', 356 U.S. 1 (1958); ''[[International Salt Co. v. United States]]'', [[Case citation|332 U.S. 392]] (1947)&lt;/ref&gt; and Section 3 of the [[Clayton Act]].&lt;ref&gt;15 U.S.C. s. 14&lt;/ref&gt; A tying arrangement is defined as "an agreement by a party to sell one product but only on the condition that the buyer also purchases a different (or tied) product, or at least agrees he will not purchase the product from any other supplier."&lt;ref&gt;''N. Pac. Ry. Co. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 5-6 (1958)''&lt;/ref&gt; Tying may be the action of several companies as well as the work of just one firm. Success on a tying claim typically requires proof of four elements: (1) two separate products or services are involved; (2) the purchase of the tying product is conditioned on the additional purchase of the tied product; (3) the seller has sufficient market power in the market for the tying product; (4) a not insubstantial amount of interstate commerce in the tied product market is affected.&lt;ref&gt;''Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Servs., Inc.'', 504 U.S. 451, 461–62 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

For at least three decades, the Supreme Court defined the required "economic power" to include just about any departure from [[perfect competition]], going so far as to hold that possession of a copyright or even the existence of a tie itself gave rise to a presumption of economic power.&lt;ref&gt;''See Fornter Enterprises v. United States Steel'', 394 U.S. 495 (1969); ''United States v. Loew's, Inc''. 372 U.S. 38 (1962)&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court has since held that a plaintiff must establish the sort of market power necessary for other antitrust violations in order to prove sufficient "economic power" necessary to establish a per se tie.&lt;ref&gt;''See Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2 v. Hyde'', 466 U.S. 2 (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently, the Court has eliminated any presumption of market power based solely on the fact that the tying product is patented or copyrighted.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Illinois Tool Works v. Independent Ink'', 547 U.S. 28 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, changing business practices surrounding new technologies have put the legality of tying arrangements to the test. Although the Supreme Court still considers some tying arrangements as ''per se'' illegal, the Court actually uses a rule-of-reason analysis, requiring an analysis of foreclosure effects and an affirmative defense of efficiency justifications.&lt;ref&gt;J. Gregory Sidak, ''Do Free Mobile Apps Harm Consumers?'', 52 SAN DIEGO L. REV. (forthcoming Aug. 2015), https://www.criterioneconomics.com/docs/do-free-mobile-apps-harm-consumers.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apple products===
{{Main|History of iPhone#Exclusivity tying of iPhone to AT&amp;T}}
The tying of [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] products is an example of commercial tying that has caused recent controversy.  When Apple initially released the [[iPhone]] on June 29, 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.macworld.com/article/54769/2007/01/iphone.html |title=Apple unveils iPhone |date=January 9, 2007 |accessdate=March 14, 2011 |author=Honan, Mathew |work=[[Macworld]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was [[History of iPhone#Exclusivity tying of iPhone to AT&amp;T|sold exclusively with AT&amp;T]] (formerly [[Cingular]]) contracts in the United States.&lt;ref name="CNN secrets"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2007/01/10/commentary/lewis_fortune_iphone.fortune/index.htm|title=How Apple kept its iPhone secrets|last=Lewis|first=Peter|date=January 12, 2007|publisher=[[CNN|CNN Money]]|accessdate=January 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; To enforce this exclusivity, Apple employed a type of [[ Phone unlocking|software lock]] that ensured the phone would not work on any network besides AT&amp;T's.&lt;ref name=softwareLocking&gt;{{ cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/29/technology/29iphone.html?_r=1 | title=Altered iPhones Freeze Up | author=Hafner, Katie | date=September 29, 2007 | accessdate=March 15, 2011 | work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Related to the concept of [[bricking]], any user who tried to unlock or otherwise tamper with the locking software ran the risk of rendering their iPhone permanently inoperable.&lt;ref name=softwareLocking /&gt;
This caused complaints among many consumers, as they were forced to pay an additional early termination fee of $175 if they wanted to unlock the device safely for use on a different carrier.&lt;ref name="Democracts criticize"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-9742441-7.html|title=Democrats criticize AT&amp;T's exclusive iPhone deal|last=Broache|first=Anne|date=July 11, 2007|publisher=[[CNET News]]|accessdate=March 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other companies such as [[Google]] complained that tying encourages a more closed-access-based wireless service.&lt;ref name="Democracts criticize"/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=July 2015}} Many questioned the legality of  the arrangement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.recong2.com/journal/does_apples_tightly_controlled_ecosystem_strategy_constitute_an_illegal_tying_arrangement | title=Does Apple's Tightly Controlled Ecosystem Strategy Constitute and Illegal Tying Arrangement? |date=July 6, 2007 |accessdate=March 15, 2011 | author=Gonsowski, Laurie}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in October 2007 a [[Class action lawsuit|class-action lawsuit]] was filed against Apple, claiming that its exclusive agreement with AT&amp;T violates California [[antitrust law]].&lt;ref name=classActionLawsuit&gt;{{ cite news | url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2007/10/california-man-seeks-class-action-lawsuit-over-iphone-bricking-lock-in.ars | title=California man seeks class action lawsuit over iPhone bricking, lock-in | date=October 7, 2007 | accessdate=March 15, 2011 | author=Chartier, David | work=[[ars technica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suit was filed by the Law Office of Damian R. Fernandez on behalf of California resident Timothy P. Smith,&lt;ref name=classActionLawsuit /&gt; and ultimately sought to have an injunction issued against Apple to prevent it from selling iPhones with any kind of software lock.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://www.informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2007/10/california_resi.html | title=Apple Class-Action Suit Filed by California Man Over iPhone Bricking | date=October 5, 2007 | accessdate=March 15, 2011 | author = Wolfe, Alexander | work=[[InformationWeek]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2010, federal regulators clarified the issue when they determined it was lawful to unlock (or in other terms, "jail break") the iPhone, declaring that there was no basis for copyright law to assist Apple in protecting its restrictive business model.&lt;ref name=Jailbreaking&gt;{{ cite news | url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/07/feds-ok-iphone-jailbreaking/ | title = U.S. Declares iPhone Jailbreaking Legal, Over Apple's Objections| author = Kravets, David | date=July 26, 2010 | accessdate=March 15, 2011 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[IOS jailbreaking|Jail breaking]] is removing [[operating system]] or hardware restrictions imposed on an iPhone (or other device). If done successfully, this allows one to run any application on the phone they choose, including applications not authorized by Apple.&lt;ref name=Jailbreaking /&gt; Apple told regulators that modifying the iPhone operating system leads to the creation of an infringing [[derivative work]] that is protected by copyright law. This means that the license on the operating system forbids software modification.&lt;ref name=Jailbreaking /&gt; However, regulators agreed that modifying an iPhone's firmware/operating system to enable it to run an application that Apple has not approved fits comfortably within the four corners of [[fair use]].&lt;ref name=Jailbreaking /&gt;

===Microsoft products===
Another prominent case involving a tying claim was ''[[United States v. Microsoft]]''.&lt;ref name="See 2001"&gt;''See [[United States v. Microsoft]], 253 F.3d 34 (D.C. Cir. 2001).''&lt;/ref&gt; By some accounts, [[Microsoft]] ties together [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Internet Explorer]], [[Windows Media Player]], [[Outlook Express]] and [[Microsoft Office]]. The United States claimed that the bundling of Internet Explorer (IE) to sales of [[Windows 98]], making IE difficult to remove from Windows 98 (e.g., not putting it on the "Remove Programs" list), and designing Windows 98 to work "unpleasantly" with Netscape Navigator constituted an illegal tying of Windows 98 and IE.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 64-67, 84-86.&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft's counterargument was that a [[web browser]] and a mail reader are simply part of an [[operating system]], included with other [[personal computer]] operating systems, and the integration of the products was technologically justified. Just as the definition of a [[car]] has changed to include things that used to be separate products, such as [[speedometer]]s and radios, Microsoft claimed the definition of an operating system has changed to include their formerly separate products. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] rejected Microsoft's claim that Internet Explorer was simply one facet of its operating system, but the court held that the tie between Windows and Internet Explorer should be analyzed deferentially under the [[Rule of Reason]].&lt;ref name="See 2001"/&gt;  The U.S. government claim settled before reaching final resolution.

As to the tying of Office, parallel cases against Microsoft brought by [[State Attorney General|State Attorneys General]] included a claim for harm in the market for office productivity applications.&lt;ref&gt;See Complaint filed in New York v. Microsoft Corp. PP 88-95, 98, 117-19, No. 98-1233 (D.D.C. filed May 18, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; The Attorneys General abandoned this claim when filing an amended complaint. The claim was revived by [[Novell]] where they alleged that manufacterers of computers ("[[OEM]]s") were charged less for their Windows bulk purchases if they agreed to bundle Office with every PC sold than if they gave computer purchasers the choice whether or not to buy Office along with their machines — making their computer prices less competitive in the market. The Novell litigation is still ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Civil No. JFM-05-1087.&lt;/ref&gt;

Microsoft has also tied its software to the third-party [[Android OS|Android]] mobile operating system, by requiring manufacturers that license [[patent]]s it claims covers the OS and [[smartphone]]s to ship [[Microsoft Office Mobile]] and [[Skype]] applications on the devices.&lt;ref name="supersite-androidpatents"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trent|first1=Rod|title=Microsoft Inside: 20 New Android Device Manufacturers Sign-on to Pre-Install Office and Skype|url=http://winsupersite.com/mobile/microsoft-inside-20-new-android-device-manufacturers-sign-pre-install-office-and-skype|website=SuperSite for Windows|publisher=Penton|accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="verge-xiaomims"&gt;{{cite web|title=Xiaomi will bundle Microsoft’s Office and Skype apps on its Android devices|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/1/11827268/microsoft-xiaomi-skype-office-android-apps-patent-deal|website=The Verge|accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-tying provision of the Bank Holding Company Act==
In 1970, Congress enacted section 106 of the [[Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970]] (BHCA), the anti-tying provision, which is codified at 12 U.S.C. § 1972. The statute was designed to prevent banks, whether large or small, state or federal, from imposing anticompetitive conditions on their customers. Tying is an antitrust violation, but the Sherman and Clayton Acts did not adequately protect borrowers from being required to accept conditions to loans issued by banks, and section 106 was specifically designed to apply to and remedy such bank misconduct.

Banks are allowed to take measures to protect their loans and to safeguard the value of their investments, such as requiring security or guaranties from borrowers. The statute exempts so-called “traditional banking practices” from its ''per se'' illegality, and thus its purpose is not so much to limit banks' lending practices, as it is to ensure that the practices used are fair and competitive. A majority of claims brought under the BHCA are denied. Banks still have quite a bit of leeway in fashioning loan agreements, but when a bank clearly steps over the bounds of propriety, the plaintiff is compensated with treble damages.

At least four regulatory agencies including the [[Federal Reserve Board]] oversee the activities of banks, their holding companies, and other related depository institutions. While each type of depository institution has a “primary regulator”, the nation’s “dual banking” system allows concurrent jurisdiction among the different regulatory agencies. With respect to the anti-tying provision, the Fed takes the preeminent role in relation to the other financial institution regulatory agencies, which reflects that it was considered the least biased (in favor of banks) of the regulatory agencies when section 106 was enacted.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Timothy D. Naegele, The Bank Holding Company Act's Anti-Tying Provision: 35 Years Later, 122 Banking Law Journal 195 (2005); http://www.naegele.com/whats_new.html#articles.&lt;/ref&gt;
