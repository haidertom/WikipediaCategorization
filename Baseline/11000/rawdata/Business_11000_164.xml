'''Lt. Colonel Allan (Allen) Bell''' (14 February 1870 – 15 October 1936) was a New Zealand Member of Parliament for the [[Bay of Islands]] in [[Northland Region|Northland]].

== Early life ==
Bell was born at [[Southbridge, New Zealand]] on 14 February 1870. He was the son of Allen and Mary, farmers in the area.&lt;ref name="DNZB Bell" /&gt; He worked as a bushman and a farmer. In 1895, Bell travelled to southern Africa and served with the British armed forces that in 1896 [[Second Matabele War|suppressed a rising]] by the Matabele ([[Northern Ndebele people|Ndebele]]) people.&lt;ref name="DNZB Bell" /&gt;

He then saw active service with the [[Rhodesia Regiment]] during the [[Second Boer War|South African (Boer) War]]. Bell was discharged on 31 January 1900 and returned to [[Taranaki]]. On 29 January 1902 he married James Helen Shaw Lambie at [[Pihama]]. They bought land at [[Te Rapa]], north of Hamilton. Their daughter Elaline was born there on 6 July 1904.&lt;ref name="DNZB Bell" /&gt;

==Hamilton and the Waikato==

Bell was a member of the [[Waipa District|Waipa]] County Council and the [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] Borough Council. He was the founder of the Waikato Agricultural and Pastoral (A &amp; P) Association and the first director of the [[Waikato]] Dairy Company in 1912.{{sfn|Scholefield|1940|p=56}}

As a conservative, Bell stood for the {{NZ electorate link|Waikato}} electorate at the [[New Zealand general election, 1908|1908 general election]] for the [[Opposition (parliamentary)|opposition]], but lost to the incumbent from the [[New Zealand Liberal Party|Liberal Party]], [[Henry Greenslade]].&lt;ref name="DNZB Bell" /&gt;{{sfn|AtoJs 1908 election|1909|p=6}} At the [[New Zealand general election, 1911|1911 general election]] Bell stood as an unofficial [[New Zealand Reform Party|Reform Party]] candidate in the newly formed [[Raglan (New Zealand electorate)|Raglan]] electorate; the official Reform Party candidate was [[Richard Bollard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Next Thursday's Poll|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=NZH19111204.2.30|accessdate=26 April 2015|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|volume=XLVIII|issue=14854|date=4 December 1911|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bell came into conflict with the party's executive over liquor licensing issues, as "it was used not for the purpose of raising the status of politics, but in the interest of the liquor party."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Elections|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=WT19111206.2.12|accessdate=26 April 2015|work=[[Waikato Times]]|issue=12149|date=6 December 1911|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the campaign Bell created controversy when he advocated the abolition of the [[Monarchy of New Zealand|monarchy]], and the creation of a [[Republicanism in New Zealand|New Zealand republic]].&lt;ref name="povertybay"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=PBH19111118.2.28 |title=A "Reform" Candidate Favors&lt;!-- sic --&gt; A Republic |date=18 November 1911 |work=[[Poverty Bay Herald]] |agency=Press Association |accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also argued for the abolition of [[New Zealand Legislative Council|New Zealand's upper house]] and Britain's [[House of Lords]].&lt;ref name="povertybay" /&gt; As a result of his comments, the Reform Party disendorsed Bell as their candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=NA19111202.2.20.7.4 |title=Not authorised |work=[[The Northern Advocate]] |date=2 December 1911 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The armed forces considered that Bell had broken his [[Oath of Allegiance (New Zealand)|Oath of Allegiance]] as an Officer (Lieutenant Colonel). Under pressure, he reluctantly resigned his commission in January 1912.&lt;ref name="DNZB Bell"&gt;{{DNZB|Crawford|J. A. B.|3B24|Bell, Allen|8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legion of Frontiersmen==

In 1911, Bell joined the New Zealand Command of the [[Legion of Frontiersmen]] and after his discharge from the army went on to devote much of his time and energy into the promoting and expanding the Legion. Bell was appointed as the Legion's Commandant for Auckland with the rank of Colonel. He retained and used this Legion of Frontiersmen rank for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://frontiersmen.homestead.com/famous.html|title=The Famous and the Infamous members of the Legion of frontiersmen|publisher=Legion of Frontiersmen New Zealand Command|accessdate=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1912, Bell journeyed to [[Dargaville]] and met with local men Dick Long, Andy Knudson and one other met in the Central Hotel in [[Dargaville]] one winter's night and formed the Northern Wairoa (Mounted Rifles) Squadron of the Legion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dargaville.co.nz/Feature.cfm?WPID=101 |title=Dargaville – History |accessdate=8 August 2011 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110724192505/http://www.dargaville.co.nz/Feature.cfm?WPID=101| archivedate= 24 July 2011 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913, as Commandant of the Auckland District Bell convened and chaired a meeting of the Legion in the "Hall of Commerce" for the purpose of considering the viability of setting up a Dominion Executive of the Legion, the election of a Commandant for the North Island and other matters. A ballot was taken by A Squadron's secretary, Frontiersman Thomas E. Whitton, which showed a large majority in favour of a Dominion Executive, a five shilling annual levy for its support, and election of Colonel Bell as the North Island Commandant of the Legion. Captain Forbes-Eadie LOF moved that the current Auckland Executive be disbanded and that Colonel Bell's new executive take over. This was unanimously approved. At the conclusion of the meeting Colonel Bell referred to the great loss sustained by the Defence Forces by the very recent death of Mrs Brewis (of Hamilton), who was the first woman in New Zealand to assist in organising the universal military training movement.

==Northland==
In 1914, three Bell brothers (Allen, Leonard and Walter) bought land in what is today [[Kaitaia]]. He was an enthusiastic promoter of the area north of Auckland, and did much lobbying for making the area accessible via roads and bridges. He acted as a land agent and was a newspaper editor, first writing for the ''Northern Age'' and then founding the ''Northlander''. Bell was a supporter of the government's scheme of draining land in the Kaitaia area, and as an owner of swampy land and a land agent, he personally benefited from the initiative.&lt;ref name="DNZB Bell" /&gt;

He is a member of the famous industrialist [[Agnelli family]]. He is also a board member of [[FIAT]] and [[Exor (company)|Exor]].

==Early life==
Agnelli is the son of late Juventus F.C. chairman and [[Italian Senate|senator]] of the [[Italian Republic]] [[Umberto Agnelli]], [[chief executive officer|CEO]] of [[Fiat]] from 1970–1976, and Donna Allegra [[Caracciolo]] di Castagneto, first cousin of [[Marella Agnelli]], born Donna Marella Caracciolo di Castagneto and daughter of Filippo Caracciolo, 8th Prince di Castagneto, 3rd Duke di Melito, and a hereditary [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|Patrician]] of Naples (1903-1965). Marella, widow of Agnelli's uncle [[Gianni Agnelli|Gianni]], and Allegra and, therefore, Andrea, are both members of and old [[Naples|Neapolitan]] [[Nobility|noble]] family that hold the titles of Prince of Castagneto and Duke of Melito, among others.

Andrea was the last male member of the family to carry the [[Agnelli]] surname until the birth of his son Giacomo. He studied at [[St Clare's, Oxford|St Clare's]] in [[Oxford]], England and then at [[Bocconi University]] in [[Milan]].

==Career==
After university, Agnelli started his career in the business world  in England and France at companies including [[Iveco]] and [[Auchan|Auchan Hypermarché]]. He also spent several years in [[Switzerland]] working in [[marketing]] and development for [[Ferrari]] Idea S.A. and [[Lausanne]]-based [[Philip Morris International]].

===Juventus F.C.===
In May 2010 he was appointed Chairman of the board of directors of [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] by his first cousin [[John Elkann]], becoming the fourth member of the [[Agnelli family]] to run the football club after his father, his uncle and his grandfather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lastampa.it/sport/cmsSezioni/quijuve/201004articoli/26580girata.asp |title=Juve, John Elkann disegna il futuro "Andrea Agnelli sarà il presidente" |language=Italian |trans-title=Juve, John Elkann marks the future: "Andrea Agnelli will be the chairman" |publisher=[[La Stampa]] |date=28 April 2010 |accessdate=1 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130065347/http://www.lastampa.it/sport/cmsSezioni/quijuve/201004articoli/26580girata.asp |archivedate=30 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Elkann had come under criticism from Juventus fans for the club's poor results during the [[2009–10 Serie A|2009–10 season]] and many [[Juventus Ultras|ultras]] saw Agnelli as the "rightful" heir due to his family's long-time association with the club. Despite entering the job during a period when the club was still dealing with the aftermath of the infamous ''[[Calciopoli]]'' scandal, he is credited with overseeing the club's transition into the [[Juventus Stadium|new stadium]] and balancing their finances in wake of the [[Late-2000s recession in Europe#Italy|ongoing recession]] ravaging Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stadio, Vinovo, marchio e rosa: la Juve vale di più|url=http://www.tuttosport.com/calcio/serie_a/juventus/2011/10/10-148539/Stadio,+Vinovo,+marchio+e+rosa%3A+la+Juve+vale+di+pi%C3%B9|publisher=[[Tuttosport]]|date=10 October 2011|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=La Juventus e il nuovo stadio, "29" scudetti nello spogliatoio|url=http://www.repubblica.it/rubriche/spycalcio/2011/10/05/news/la_juventus_e_il_nuovo_stadio-22724162/|publisher=[[La Repubblica]]|date=5 October 2011|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his first acts as new chairman was to appoint [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]] duo [[Giuseppe Marotta]] as Director of Sport and [[Luigi Delneri]] as new coach.

On 22 May 2011, Agnelli appointed former captain and fan favourite [[Antonio Conte]] as the new manager of Juventus, replacing Delneri. The same season Juventus won the first ''[[scudetto]]'' undefeated under Agnelli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Conte replaces Del Neri at Juventus|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/924796/antonio-conte-to-replace-lugi-del-neri-at-juventus?cc=5901|publisher=ESPN Soccernet|date=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Juventus won seven ''scudetti'' in a row as of [[2017–18 Serie A|2017–18]], a record in [[Serie A]], including four [[Coppa Italia]] titles in a row since [[2014–15 Coppa Italia|2014–15]].

On 8 September 2015, Agnelli was re-elected as a member of the [[European Club Association]](ECA) Executive Board, a position he has held since 2012. He was also appointed by the ECA Executive Board to join the [[UEFA#UEFA Executive Committee|UEFA Executive Committee]] on behalf of ECA, where he will represent the 220 ECA member clubs alongside re-elected ECA chairman [[Karl-Heinz Rummenigge]] for the next two years 2015-17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecaeurope.com/news/eca-member-clubs-elect-new-executive-board/|title=ECA Member Clubs elect new Executive Board|publisher=ecaeurope.com|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juventus.com/en/news/news/2015/rummenigge-and-agnelli-enter-uefa-executive-committee-.php|title=Rummenigge and Agnelli enter UEFA Executive Committee|publisher=juventus.com|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal troubles===
In 2014, some of Juventus' senior management, including Agnelli, were investigated by the [[Public prosecutor's office]] of Turin on the management of [[tickets (admission)|tickets]] at the Juventus Stadium,&lt;ref name="ANSA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/sport/calcio/2017/03/07/procura-figc-contatto-tra-agnelli-e-boss-per-gestione-biglietti_be0314bd-f4f5-4923-baaf-5c1b4a6a13fd.html|title=Procura Figc, contatto tra Agnelli e boss per gestione biglietti Juventus|date=7 March 2017|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; about the alleged infiltration of the [['Ndrangheta]] in the commercial management of the company's tickets;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Massimiliano Peggio|url=http://www.lastampa.it/2017/05/15/cronaca/agnelli-in-tribunale-mai-ricevuto-pressioni-sui-biglietti-dalla-criminalit-organizzata-87YcYnyroPPts26kiLeBZJ/pagina.html|title=Agnelli in tribunale: "Mai ricevuto pressioni sui biglietti dalla criminalità organizzata"|date=15 May 2017|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; the public ministers of Turin did not formalize criminal charges against Juventus or its members,&lt;ref name="ANSA"/&gt; closing the investigation three years later with a filing request as there were no links between the Juventus management and the groups and/or individual people involved in [[organized crime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Marco Bellinazzo|url=http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/notizie/2017-03-07/rapporti-la-cosca-bellocco-pesce-che-cosa-rischia-juve-170230.shtml|title=Pecoraro smentisce: irresponsabile attribuirmi frasi su Juve e cosche|date=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 March 2017, following the opening of a lawsuit by a prosecutor from the Turin Public Prosecutor's Office, Agnelli was referred by the [[FIGC]]'s Attorney General along with three other club executives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.figc.it/it/204/2536768/2017/03/News.shtml|title=Deferiti la Juventus, il Presidente Andrea Agnelli e altri 3 dirigenti bianconeri|date=18 March 2017|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following 15 September, the FIGC reformulated its allegations, excluding a presumed Mafia association from the members of the incriminated club after the prosecutor Giuseppe Pecoraro's intervention to the [[Antimafia Commission]] in April;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Commissione parlamentare antimafia|url=http://www.radioradicale.it/scheda/505027/commissione-parlamentare-di-inchiesta-sul-fenomeno-delle-mafie-e-sulle-altre|title=Commissione parlamentare di inchiesta sul fenomeno delle mafie e sulle altre associazioni criminali, anche straniere|publisher=Radio Radicale|date=5 April 2017|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; the prosecutor asked for sanctions for the meetings of Agnelli with ultra groups and the sale of the tickets by the rest of the offenders beyond the limit allowed per person (thus favouring [[ticket resale|ticket scalping]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.figc.it/it/204/2539131/2017/09/News.shtml|title=Deferimento Juventus: le richieste della Procura Federale|date=15 September 2017|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 September, Agnelli was banned for one year and fined €20,000, while Juventus were fined €300,000 for selling tickets to ultras, however alleged connections to organized crime were not present in the ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.football-italia.net/110402/official-agnelli-banned-year|title=Official: Agnelli banned for a year|publisher=Football Italia|date=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 December, Agnelli's ban was lifted, however he was required to pay a €100,000 fine, while the fine against Juventus doubled to €600,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.football-italia.net/114485/official-agnelli-ban-revoked|title=Official: Agnelli ban revoked, but...|publisher=Football Italia|date=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
On 27 August 2005 he married Emma Winter in a Roman Catholic ceremony in [[Villar Perosa]] ([[Piedmont]], [[Italy]]) at the church of San Pietro in Vincoli.

'''Anton Freiherr von Lehár''' (born '''Antal Lehár'''; 21 February 1876 – 12 November 1962; known sometimes as ''Baron Antal Lehár'') was an Hungarian [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]], who reached the pinnacle of his service after [[World War I]] when he supported the former Emperor [[Charles I of Austria's attempts to retake the throne of Hungary]]. His brother was composer [[Franz Lehár]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wien.gv.at/rk/historisch/1948/oktober.html|title=Wien 1948 – Berichte vom Oktober 1948: Bürgermeister Körner zum Tode Franz Lehars|author=Stadt Wien|date=26 October 1948|accessdate=4 January 2009|language =German}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Freiherr von Lehár (1918) – Gerd Hruška.png|thumb|upright|Lehár's arms as a baron, 1918.]]
==Early life==
Lehár was born in [[Sopron]], [[Austria-Hungary]], as the younger son of a [[conducting|bandmaster]] in the [[Regiment|Infantry Regiment]] No. 50 of the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]]. He attended schools in Pressburg (Pozsony, today's [[Bratislava]]), [[Prague]] and Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | language =German}}&lt;/ref&gt; He entered cadet school in Vienna to become a professional officer, finishing in 1893 top of his class. Following a posting to his father's regiment, he was promoted [[Second Lieutenant|Leutnant]] in 1894 and [[Oberleutnant]] in 1898. Between 1897 and 1899 Lehár attended the ''"[[Kriegsschule (Austria)|Kriegsschule]]'' (war college) in Vienna, after which he was attached to the general staff and served in a number of training positions until [[World War I]].

==World War I==
Following the outbreak of World War I, Lehár, now with the rank of [[Major]], was put in command of the 2nd [[battalion]] of the [[Military of Hungary|Honvéd]]-[[Landsturm]] Infantry Regiment No. 13, which he led in September 1914 during battles at [[Chodel]] south of [[Lublin]]. His battalion was part of the Army group "Kummer" and served next to the unit of [[Viktor Dankl von Krasnik|General Viktor Dankl]].&lt;ref name="lehar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Anton Lehar 1973 12"&gt;{{cite book

After leaving hospital he was reassigned to the War ministry in Vienna and in September 1915 he served in the Tyrolean Defence Command.&lt;ref name="lehar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Anton Lehar 1973 12" /&gt; Following promotion to [[Lieutenant Colonel|Oberstleutnant]] in September 1915, Lehár returned to fighting, this time on the Italian front. There he commanded the'' Heeresgruppe "Lehar"'' in the Etschtal-Rovereto sector of the Italian front, which consisted of Tyrolese ''[[Standschützen]]'' and [[Bosniaks]].&lt;ref name="lehar" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In August 1918 Lehár was decorated with the Knight's Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa in recognition of his services during the battles at Chodel south of Lublin in September 1914. In accordance with the statutes of this order, Lehár became a [[baron]] in his country's nobility and was since styled "[[Freiherr]] von Lehár", while his brother [[Franz Lehár|Franz]] remained a commoner.

At the conclusion of hostilities of World War I, Lehár was able to move his regiment, without any casualties or desertion, back to [[Szombathely]].

==Hungary==
After the dissolution of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], Oberst Anton Freiherr von Lehár decided to remain in Hungary and to fight again for the monarchy, in several roles and at various theatres of war. He played an important role in the counterrevolution in Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Life as a businessman==
When the political turmoil had calmed down, Anton's brother Franz Lehár organized for the former general a job as director of the ''Society of Authors, Composers and Music Publishers'' in Berlin in 1926. With the rise of the [[Nazi Party|National Socialist Party]], Freiherr von Lehár was, as a dedicated Austrian-Hungarian monarchist, soon considered suspect. When the National Socialists assumed power in 1933 (''[[Machtergreifung]]''), he had to leave Berlin.&lt;ref name="lehar" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Back in Vienna, Lehár founded the ''Chodel Music Publishing Company'', but after it did not prosper, he decided to hand over the business to his brother in 1935. He then moved to the countryside, becoming a farmer in [[Theresienfeld]] near [[Wiener Neustadt]] in [[Lower Austria]]. When Germany occupied Austria in March 1938 (''[[Anschluss]]''), Lehár was ordered to move to Vienna, where the [[Gestapo]] could keep a closer eye on him and his wife for much of [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="lehar" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

After Franz Lehár's death in October 1948, the former general became the administrator of his estate and spent the rest of his life guarding the rights and promoting the popularity of his brother's music.

Anton Freiherr von Lehár died in Vienna in 1962, aged 86.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8364">The '''Apcar family''' is an [[Armenians|Armenian]] family originally from [[New Julfa]] in [[Isfahan]], Persia. After moving to [[India]] they became prominent in commerce and industry. Later members were involved in the practice of law and the legislature.

==Senior branch==
{{For|the ship|SS Arratoon Apcar}}
Aratoon Apcar was born in 1779 at [[New Julfa]] in [[Isfahan]], Persia. 
He was the second son of Apcar, the ancestor of the family.
He came to [[Bombay]] when he was sixteen and found employment with an Armenian merchant there, trading with [[China]] and [[Manila]].
After his patron died, he continued in this trade in his own right. 
He founded Apcar &amp; Co in 1809 and was Senior Member of this firm until his death in 1863.
In 1830 he moved to [[Calcutta]].{{sfn|Seth|1937|p=126}}
He gave generous endowments to the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] of St Mary at New Julfa, and in 1843 established the Armenian Patriotic School there. 
Aratoon Apcar died at Calcutta on 16 May 1863 at the age of 85.{{sfn|Seth|1937|p=127}}

Aratoon Apcar married Catherine Thomas (1800–1849) in 1813.
They had four sons and one daughter name Sandookth  who died aged 8 months (1814–1815), Apcar (1816–1862), Seth (1819-188?), Thomas (1821–1875) and Alexander (1824–1895).{{sfn|Emin|Apcar|1918|p=528}}
Seth Apcar (born Mumbai 12 May 1819 died [[London]] March 1885) was the first Armenian [[Sheriff of Kolkata]]. He was awarded the [[Order of the Lion and the Sun]] by the [[Shah of Iran]], which was presented to him by the [[Governor-General]] of India. As a London resident in the 1870s, he was Honorary President of an Armenian committee set up to increase British awareness of the plight of Armenians during the decline of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Alexander Apcar (born Mumbai 4 November 1824 died Kolkata 12 November 1895) was the Consul for Siam (Thailand) in Kolkata until his death. Alexander’s son was Apcar Alexander Apcar (see below).

==Junior branch==

Arratoon Apcar's younger brother Gregory Apcar (born [[New Julfa]] 1795 died Mumbai 23 June 1847) came to India in 1808.{{sfn|Seth|1937|p=128}}
He was noted for his charitable work, particularly to the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] and [[Armenian College (Kolkata)|Armenian College]]. On 6 January 1827 he married Catchkathoon Sarkies in Mumbai. Their son Aratoon Gregory Apcar was born 4 November 1827 and died on 1 February 1916. His son, John Gregory Apcar (born 1849 died London, 28 October 1923), known as "Father John", was elected a member of the [[Bengal Legislative Council]] at the 1912–13 [[Bengal]] [[general election]] as one of two representatives for the [[Kolkata Municipal Corporation|Calcutta Corporation]]. He was also Clerk of the Crown and a municipal commissioner. He was admitted to the [[Inner Temple]] in 1871. He was educated at [[Harrow School]], as was another son Gregory Apcar (born London 1848? died London, 17 May 1935). Both were benefactors of that school. Described in 1936 by Harrow's Governors as "an endowment which has never been equaled in the School's history" and "a shining example of love and care for Harrow",{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Gregory Apcar left the School an estate valued at around £320,000, which increased the value of the School's property and Trusts by almost two-thirds.

==Apcar &amp; Co and the Apcar Line==
{{main article|Apcar and Company}}
Apcar &amp; Co acted as general business agents and insurance brokers and controlled the Apcar Line. 
The Apcar Line ran a fleet of vessels from Kolkata carrying Chinese [[coolies]] and  cargo, largely to and from [[Singapore]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Amoy]] (Xiamen), with connections to [[Japan]].  [[Pirates]] were active, and well into the twentieth century, the ships had to be armed and sandbagged against attacks.

Apcar &amp; Co also entered the [[coal]] business. In 1862 coal seams were discovered near [[Raniganj]] and [[Asansol]]. Apcar &amp; Co purchased an extensive stretch of land and started a mine at [[Lachipur]] (4 miles from Asansol). They also opened coal mines at [[Charanpur]], [[Faridpur, India|Faridpur]] and [[Borachuck]]. A large number of Armenians either owned collieries or worked in various capacities in the coalfields. Seeing the rapid development of the coalfields, European firms purchased large areas from Apcar &amp; Co on a royalty basis and started to mine the coal. As a result, Asansol became a large and developed mining district.

On 27 February 1912 Apcar &amp; Co, ships, workshops and mines, were sold to the [[British India Steam Navigation Company]] for Rs 800,000 and absorbed by BISN. Sailings from Kolkata to Japan were still advertised as being conducted by the Apcar Line into the 1950s. The coal mines were managed by Mackinnon, Mackenzie &amp; Co until 1951.

== Apcar Alexander Apcar==
{{main article|Apcar Alexander Apcar}}
Apcar Alexander Apcar was the second son of Apcar Arathoon Apcar.{{sfn|Late Sir A. A. Apcar: Straits Times}}
He was born in Kolkata on 3 October 1850. After going to [[Harrow School]], he returned to Calcutta in the early 1870s, never again visiting Europe. He was a keen cricketer, and rackets player. He was president of the [[Calcutta Turf Club]]. He kept a fine stud, recruited from a breeding farm he owned in Australia. His stud was "summered" at Bangalore, where he spent a good part of the hot weather season.{{sfn|Obituary Sir A.A. Apcar: The Times}}

Sir Alexander took a prominent part in the work of the [[Bengal Chamber of Commerce]], of which he was vice-president in 1903 and president from 1904–1907. He represented the Chamber on the [[Bengal Legislative Council]], and on the Supreme Legislature from 1900–1909, and for many years he was one of its representatives on the Kolkata Port Trust. 
Sir Alexander was the Consul for Siam in Calcutta for many years. 
He became head of Apcar &amp; Co. 
He was created a CSI in 1903, and was advanced to knighthood of the Order on the occasion of the Coronation [[Durbar (court)|Durbar]] at Delhi later that year.  
Sir Apcar Alexander Apcar, [[Order of the Star of India|KCSI]] died at [[Bangalore]] on 17 April 1913.
He was unmarried. The Times Obituary stated that the death of Sir Alexander, "removes one of the best known and most popular of the merchant princes of Calcutta."{{sfn|Obituary Sir A.A. Apcar: The Times}}

[[Calcium]] and [[magnesium]] are added to a molten lead-bismuth bath. The resulting bismuth compounds have higher [[melting point]]s and lower densities than the lead, and can be removed as dross. The compounds are treated with [[chlorine]] to free up the bismuth. Temperature used in the process is about 380–500&amp;nbsp;°C(572–932&amp;nbsp;°F) . The other major processes for separating the two metals are by [[Fractional crystallization (chemistry)|fractional crystallization]] and by the [[Betts electrolytic process]].&lt;ref name="samans"&gt;Samans, Carl H.

When they were in office both Solchaga and his predecessor Miguel Boyer implemented economic policies based the orthodox liberal ideas, and the social outcomes of these policies were largely neglected.&lt;ref name=gil1992&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gillespie|first=Richard|title=Factionalism in the Spanish Socialist Party|journal=Working Papers Barcelona|year=1992|issue=59|url=http://ddd.uab.cat/pub/worpap/1992/hdl_2072_1423/ICPS59.pdf|accessdate=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solchaga continued Boyer's moderation and [[Orthodox economics|orthodox economy approach]].&lt;ref name=wson1994&gt;{{cite book|author=John Williamson|title=The Political Economy of Policy Reform|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cm-3mnvjEl8C&amp;pg=PA198|accessdate=8 July 2013|date=January 1994|publisher=Peterson Institute|isbn=978-0-88132-195-1|page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was partly because they did not fit into the socialist mould the government projected.&lt;ref name=gil1994&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Gillespie|title=Mediterranean Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UpC4QJP66HUC&amp;pg=PA173|accessdate=8 July 2013|year=1994|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press|isbn=978-0-8386-3609-1|page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their priority was to reduce inflation using steps to control the money supply, which reinforced the high levels of interest and a strong currency.&lt;ref name=gil1994/&gt; In addition, like Boyer he objected the approach and views of [[Alfonso Guerra]], then deputy prime minister.&lt;ref name=holman2012&gt;{{cite book|author=Otto Holman|title=Integrating Southern Europe: EC Expansion and the Transnationalization of Spain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F8KUPvmJvVMC&amp;pg=PA1994-IA35|accessdate=18 July 2013|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-80356-9|page=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christine Loh Kung-wai''', [[Silver Bauhinia Star|SBS]], [[Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire|OBE]], [[Justice of the Peace#Hong Kong|JP]] (born 1 February 1956), is a former [[Hong Kong]] Legislative Councillor, founder and CEO of [[Civic Exchange]], founder of the [[Citizens Party (Hong Kong)|Citizens Party]], and founder of [[Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor]]. From 2012 to 2017, she was Under Secretary for the [[Secretary for the Environment|Environment]] in the government of [[CY Leung]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enb.gov.hk/en/about_us/organisation/index.html|title=Organisation|accessdate=2012-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=2017book&gt;[https://www.hongkongfp.com/2017/09/17/ex-environment-deputy-christine-loh-update-revise-book-communist-party-hong-kong/ Ex-environment deputy Christine Loh to update and revise book on Communist Party in Hong Kong], HKFP, by Kris Cheng, 17 Sept 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Until her appointment as Undersecretary for the Environment, Loh was CEO of Civic Exchange, the Hong Kong [[think tank]] that she co-founded in 2000. She was named "Woman of the Year for 2006" by ''Hong Kong Business''.&lt;ref name="HKDF-profile"/&gt; She has worked in many areas, including law, business, politics, media and the [[non-profit sector]], but is best known as a leading voice in public policy in Hong Kong, particularly in promoting democracy and environmental protection. She has long been associated with the campaign to save Hong Kong's Harbour from excessive land reclamation and overdevelopment.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

In 2017, following the end of her official role, she is an adjunct professor in the Division of [[Sustainability and environmental management|Environment and Sustainability]] at the [[Hong Kong University of Science and Technology]], and is said to be revising her book ''Underground Front: The Chinese Communist Party in Hong Kong'', first published in 2010.&lt;ref name=2017book/&gt;

==Education and professional career==
Loh attended [[St. Paul's Convent School]] in Causeway Bay, and later [[Island School]] in Mid-levels, Hong Kong. She then went to [[Bedford High School (Bedfordshire)|Bedford High School]] in the UK. She later attended the [[University of Hull]], [[City University of Hong Kong]] (Masters of Law in Chinese &amp; Comparative Law) and the [[University of Hull]] (Doctor of Law, honoris causa) and was trained as a lawyer but she worked for 12 years as a commodities trader (1980–1991), rising to become managing director and later director of business development. Loh spent fourteen years in the commercial world, holding top regional posts in commodities trading at Philipp Brothers and [[Phibro]] Energy – the physical commodities trading arms of US multinational Salomon, Inc. (now Citicorp) — before joining a Hong Kong company (CIM Co.), where she headed the special projects division between 1992 and 1994. In April 2006, she was elected by shareholders of the [[Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing]] (HKEx) to be a director of the company.&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hkbookcity.com/showbook2.php?serial_no=44699 At the Epicentre: Hong Kong and the SARS Outbreak – 中文書店: 香港書城網上書店 Hong Kong Book City]&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;&lt;ref name="HKDF-profile"/&gt;

== Political career ==
Loh was appointed to the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] (LegCo) in 1992. In 1995 and 1998 she ran in two direct elections and won by large margins.&lt;ref name=HKDF-newsletter/&gt; She co-founded, in 1995, the [[Society for Protection of the Harbour]] and was responsible for creating and sponsoring the historic [[Protection of the Harbour Ordinance]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdeclips.com/en/hongkong/fullstory.html?id=75707 New talents to boost govt] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130118205228/http://www.cdeclips.com/en/hongkong/fullstory.html?id=75707 |date=18 January 2013 }}, China Daily, 13 Sept 2012&lt;/ref&gt; While part of the democratic camp in LegCo, she took a less confrontational approach than some, preferring to keep open lines of communication with the so-called pro-China camp. {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

In 2000, she and Lisa Hopkinson co-founded a Hong Kong-based non-profit [[think tank]], [[Civic Exchange]], and once again entered the political spotlight, but outside of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|LegCo]]. She resigned as its chief executive on 11 September 2012 upon her appointment as Undersecretary for the Environment in the [[First term of CY Leung as Chief Executive of Hong Kong|administration of CY Leung]], taking up her new post the following day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestandard.com.hk/breaking_news_detail.asp?id=24901&amp;icid=3&amp;d_str=20120719 "Former lawmaker Loh receives govt appointment"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130107171138/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/breaking_news_detail.asp?id=24901&amp;icid=3&amp;d_str=20120719 |date=7 January 2013 }}. ''The Standard'', 11 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, she resigned from all her positions in other non-profit organisations, academic affiliations, and non-executive directorships in commercial firms.

She left the government at the end of [[CY Leung]]'s term, in July 2017.&lt;ref name=2017book/&gt;

'''Continuous accounting''' is an approach to managing the accounting cycle that can be the key to achieving a more strategic finance and accounting function in a corporation. It is designed to be a practical approach that addresses the tactical issues that prevent finance departments from being more strategic. Continuous accounting embraces three main principles:&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.ventanaresearch.com/2015/10/30/continuous-accounting-enables-a-strategic-finance-department&lt;/ref&gt;

*The first is the need to automate mechanical, repetitive accounting processes in a continuous, end-to-end fashion. Managing processes in a controlled, end-to-end fashion improves efficiency and it ensures [[data integrity]]. Ensuring data integrity is crucial because the absence of data integrity is the root cause of a lot of time consuming work that departments perform that adds little value to the rest of the company.

*The second is optimizing the [[Accounting|accounting calendar]] by distributing workloads continuously and evenly over the accounting period&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.blackline.com/blog/continuous-accounting/what-is-continuous-accounting/|title=What Is Continuous Accounting? {{!}} BlackLine Magazine|date=2016-07-20|work=BlackLine Magazine|access-date=2017-05-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the month, quarter or year) to [http://www.digitalistmag.com/finance/2017/02/17/what-is-continuous-accounting-04917410 eliminate bottlenecks and optimize when and in which order accounting tasks are performed].

*The third is establishing a culture of [[continuous improvement]] in managing the accounting cycle. A continuous improvement culture sets increasingly rigorous objectives, reviews performance to those objectives frequently and makes addressing performance shortcomings a departmental priority.

Continuous accounting requires the effective use of information (data) and technology (software) to automate accounting and finance processes in an end-to-end fashion. This doesn’t mean that every step is entirely hands-off but processes are designed to automate the execution of as many steps as is practical. It also involves automating all the hand-offs that take place between people in performing the process as well as any managing all administrative and approval steps that must take place. End-to-end automation has two objectives. One is to cut down on the time employees spend doing work that computers can do faster and more consistently. The second is to improve the quality of the data in a company’s financial records to ensure greater accuracy, consistency and control of financial data. In this respect, continuous accounting supports the [[Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission|COSO Framework]].

Automation improves data quality because eliminating human intervention in the handling of data substantially reduces the potential for errors in a well-controlled IT environment. Consequently, by design, end-to-end financial process automation strengthens financial controls and facilitates auditing. Spreadsheets and manual calculations create the need for time consuming reconciliations and checks to spot errors and identify their source.  
 
An important design objective for end-to-end automation is to ensure that there is a single authoritative source for the data that’s used in accounting processes. Technology exists to ensures that even with multiple accounting and financial management systems and data stores, there’s no duplication of data that requires checks and reconciliations.

To second component of continuous accounting focuses on optimizing workloads. Increasingly, financial software gives companies greater flexibility. The classic accounting calendar with its monthly, quarterly and annual cycles developed over centuries as a practical approach to dealing with the limitations of the paper based systems and manual calculations. Their frequency represents a trade-off aimed at balancing efficiency and control: waiting until there are enough entries to justify performing the work, but not waiting too long to identify fraud, procedural issues and accounting errors. The monthly accounting close developed for many accounting tasks because a weekly cadence proved to be too short a period to be efficient while quarterly was too long to wait. Other accounting processes are typically handled on a quarterly or semi-annual basis because this longer frequency reflects a more appropriate trade-off of efficiency and control.

Even when computers were first used to automate bookkeeping and accounting, the old accounting calendars persisted. The limitations of early business computing technology forced system designers to use [[batch processing]]. From an accounting process standpoint, batch systems don’t offer much of an improvement over paper-based ones in changing the timing of finance and accounting processes. They impose the same need to balance efficiency and control in taking computing systems off-line to handle computations and summarizations in a way that doesn’t interfere with transactions processing. Only within the past decade has information technology reached a performance threshold that eliminates the need for such batch processing.  Corporations that use batch-less accounting systems have greater freedom to schedule their accounting cycle.  
 
The third principle of continuous accounting is continuous (or continual) improvement. Decades ago, continuous improvement revolutionized manufacturing worldwide and culture of manufacturing departments. Continuous improvement can be used as a management approach to overcome organizational inertia. This is particularly difficult in accounting departments because accounting is a discipline that requires consistency, which is necessary for the faithful presentation of a company’s financial performance and health. But performing accounting processes the same way may not be the best way.

Continuous improvement requires ongoing assessments to identify issues and how to address them, as well as a mindset that accepts that these sorts of changes will be made.

'''DataOps''' is an automated, process-oriented methodology, used by analytic and data teams, to improve the quality and reduce the cycle time of [[Data analysis|data analytics]]. While DataOps began as a set of best practices, it has now matured to become a new and independent approach to data analytics.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/dataops-it-s-a-secret|title=DataOps – It’s a Secret|website=www.datasciencecentral.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; DataOps applies to the entire data lifecycle&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://searchdatamanagement.techtarget.com/definition/DataOps|title=What is DataOps (data operations)? - Definition from WhatIs.com|work=SearchDataManagement|access-date=2017-04-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; from data preparation to reporting, and recognizes the interconnected nature of the data analytics team and information technology operations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; From a process and methodology perspective, DataOps applies [[Agile software development]], [[DevOps]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and the [[statistical process control]] used in [[lean manufacturing]], to data analytics.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tamr.com/dataops-ecosystem-emerges/|title=The DataOps Ecosystem Emerges - Tamr Inc.|date=2017-05-04|work=Tamr Inc.|access-date=2017-08-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In DataOps, development of new analytics is streamlined using [[Agile software development]], an iterative project management methodology that replaces the traditional [[Waterfall model|Waterfall sequential methodology]]. Studies show that software development projects complete significantly faster and with far fewer defects when Agile Development is used. The Agile methodology is particularly effective in environments where requirements are quickly evolving — a situation well known to data analytics professionals.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/data-ops/how-software-teams-accelerated-average-release-frequency-from-12-months-to-three-weeks-5cb86c2b551e|title=How Software Teams Accelerated Average Release Frequency from 12 Months to Three Weeks|last=DataKitchen|date=2017-02-21|website=Medium|access-date=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[DevOps]] focuses on continuous delivery by leveraging on-demand IT resources and by automating test and deployment of analytics. This merging of software ''development'' and IT ''operations'' has improved velocity, quality, predictability and scale of software engineering and deployment. Borrowing methods from DevOps, DataOps seeks to bring these same improvements to data analytics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Like [[lean manufacturing]], DataOps utilizes [[statistical process control]] (SPC) to monitor and control the data analytics pipeline. With SPC in place, the data flowing through an operational system is constantly monitored and verified to be working. If an anomaly occurs, the data analytics team can be notified through an automated alert.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/data-ops/lean-manufacturing-secrets-that-you-can-apply-to-data-analytics-31d1a319cbf0|title=Lean Manufacturing Secrets that You Can Apply to Data Analytics|last=DataKitchen|date=2017-03-07|website=Medium|access-date=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DataOps is not tied to a particular technology, architecture, tool, language or framework. Tools that support DataOps promote collaboration, orchestration&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;, agility&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;, quality, security, access and ease of use.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nexla.com/define-dataops/|title=What is DataOps? {{!}} Nexla: Scalable Data Operations Platform for the Machine Learning Age|website=www.nexla.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

DataOps was first introduced by Lenny Liebmann, Contributing Editor, InformationWeek, in a blog post on the IBM Big Data &amp; Analytics Hub titled "3 reasons why DataOps is essential for big data success" on June 19, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ibmbigdatahub.com/blog/3-reasons-why-dataops-essential-big-data-success|title=3 reasons why DataOps is essential for big data success|work=IBM Big Data &amp; Analytics Hub|access-date=2018-08-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term DataOps was later popularized by Andy Palmer at Tamr.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tamr.com/from-devops-to-dataops-by-andy-palmer/|title=From DevOps to DataOps, By Andy Palmer - Tamr Inc.|date=2015-05-07|work=Tamr Inc.|access-date=2017-03-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; DataOps is a moniker for "Data Operations."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; 2017 was a significant year for DataOps with significant ecosystem development, analyst coverage, increased keyword searches, surveys, publications, and open source projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/data-ops/2017-the-year-of-dataops-b2023c17d2af|title=2017: The Year of DataOps|last=DataKitchen|date=2017-12-19|website=data-ops|access-date=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Dataops.gif|thumb|DataOps heritage from DevOps, Agile, and manufacturing]]

== Goals and Philosophy ==

The volume of data is forecast to grow at a rate of 32% CAGR to 180 Zettabytes by the year 2025 (Source: IDC).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; DataOps seeks to provide the tools, processes, and organizational structures to cope with this significant increase in data.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Automation streamlines the daily demands of managing large integrated databases, freeing the data team to develop new analytics in a more efficient and effective way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ciodive.com/news/5-trends-driving-big-data-in-2017/445239/|title=5 trends driving Big Data in 2017|work=CIO Dive|access-date=2017-09-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

DataOps embraces the need to manage many sources of data, numerous data pipelines and a wide variety of transformations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; DataOps seeks to increase velocity, reliability, and quality of data analytics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dbta.com/Editorial/News-Flashes/Unravel-Data-Advances-Application-Performance-Management-for-Big-Data-116893.aspx|title=Unravel Data Advances Application Performance Management for Big Data|date=2017-03-10|work=Database Trends and Applications|access-date=2017-09-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It emphasizes communication, collaboration, integration, automation, measurement and cooperation between [[data scientists]], analysts, data/ETL[[Extract, transform, load|(extract, transform, load]]) engineers, [[Information technology|information technology (IT)]], and quality assurance/governance.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/data-ops/how-to-become-a-rising-star-with-data-analytics-6e4f611e85dd|title=How to Become a Rising Star with Data Analytics|last=DataKitchen|date=2017-03-15|website=data-ops|access-date=2017-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to help organizations rapidly produce insight, turn that insight into operational tools, and continuously improve analytic operations and performance.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Implementation ==
Toph Whitmore at Blue Hill Research, offers these DataOps leadership principles for the [[information technology]] department:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* ''“Establish progress and performance measurements at every stage of the data flow. Where possible, benchmark data-flow cycle times.''
* ''Define rules for an abstracted semantic layer. Ensure everyone is “speaking the same language” and agrees upon what the data (and metadata) is and is not.''
* ''Validate with the “eyeball test”: Include continuous-improvement -oriented human feedback loops. Consumers must be able to trust the data, and that can only come with incremental validation.''
* Automate as many stages of the data flow as possible including BI, data science, and analytics.
* ''Using benchmarked performance information, identify bottlenecks and then optimize for them. This may require investment in commodity hardware, or automation of a formerly-human-delivered data-science step in the process.''
* ''Establish governance discipline, with a particular focus on two-way data control, data ownership, transparency, and comprehensive data-lineage tracking through the entire workflow.''
* ''Design process for growth and extensibility. The data flow model must be designed to accommodate volume and variety of data. Ensure enabling technologies are priced affordably to scale with that enterprise data growth.”''

== DataOps Manifesto ==

Individuals and organizations supporting DataOps have produced a [http://dataopsmanifesto.org DataOps manifesto], consisting of 18 DataOps principles, which summarize the mission, values, philosophies, goals and best practices of DataOps practitioners.

== The Role of DataOps Engineer ==

The DataOps Engineer orchestrates and automates the data analytics pipeline, promotes features to production and automates quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/data-ops/building-a-dataops-team-abc375e0a6bc|title=Building a DataOps Team|last=DataKitchen|date=2017-07-19|website=data-ops|access-date=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many organizations, the DataOps engineer is a separate role. In others, it is a shared function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/data-ops/dataops-engineer-will-be-the-sexiest-job-in-analytics-9c38bf444e5a|title=DataOps Engineer Will Be the Sexiest Job in Analytics|last=DataKitchen|date=2017-05-16|website=Medium|access-date=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2010">'''Doorstep''' is a Norwegian company.

It was established in 2000, and was meant to develop a [[web portal]] for [[online trade]]. It was a cooperation between telecommunications company [[Telenor]] and [[Den norske Bank]]. Chairman was Petter Jansen, and among the board members were [[Gunn Wærsted]], [[Jon Fredrik Baksaas]] and [[Ingvild Myhre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hånd i hånd om e-handel|last=Egede-Nissen|first=Heidi|date=31 October 2000|work=Dagens Næringsliv|page=11|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Åpner for banktopper|last=Egede-Nissen|first=Heidi|date=18 January 2001|work=Dagens Næringsliv|page=7|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal was to create the largest market place of its kind in Norway. However the chief executive officer Knut Oppegaard quit in March 2001 and was replaced by Ann-Kristin Hageløkken. The portal had not yet been opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Reduserte ambisjoner|last=|first=|date=8 March 2001|work=Dagens Næringsliv|page=28|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plans were then significantly altered in April 2001, as the plans for online trading were cut. It shared its fate with several [[dot-com company|dot-com companies]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DnB/Telenor-nettbutikk skrinlagt|last=|first=|date=3 April 2001|work=Aftenposten|page=44|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the company would use the [[.no]] [[top-level domain]] instead of [[.com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vital på nett med skadeforsikring|last=|first=|date=8 December 2000|work=Bergens Tidende|page=17|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company still exists, with the purpose of "business development". Jon Fredrik Baksaas is a member of the board, which is now chaired by [[Rune Bjerke]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doorstep.no/Velkommen.html Official site] {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6109">{{About|the professor from MIT|others named|Douglas Macgregor (disambiguation)}}
'''Douglas Murray McGregor''' (1906 – 1 October 1964) was a [[management]] professor at the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]] and president of [[Antioch College]] from 1948 to 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://antiochiana.antioch.edu/PresidentsList.htm| title=Presidents of Antioch| accessdate=4 September 2011| publisher=Antioch University| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001132949/http://antiochiana.antioch.edu/PresidentsList.htm| archivedate=1 October 2011| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also taught at the [[Indian Institute of Management Calcutta]]. His 1960 book ''The Human Side of Enterprise'' had a profound influence on education practices.

Douglas McGregor is a contemporary of Abraham Maslow. Likewise, he also contributed much to the development of the management and motivational theory.   He is best known for his [[Theory X and Theory Y]] as presented in his book ‘The Human Side of Enterprise’ (1960), which proposed that manager’s individual assumptions about human nature and behaviour determined how individual manages their employees.&lt;ref name="Ibrahim, 2012"&gt;Jeong Chun Hai @Ibrahim, &amp; Nor Fadzlina Nawi. (2012). Principles of Public Administration: Malaysian Perspectives. Kuala Lumpur: Pearson Publishers. {{ISBN|978-967-349-233-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
McGregor was born in [[Detroit]].  He earned a [[Bachelor of Engineering|B.E. (Mechanical)]] from Rangoon Institute of Technology, an [[B. A.]] from [[Wayne State University]] in 1932, then earned an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] and [[Ph.D.]] in psychology from [[Harvard University]] in 1933 and 1935 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://antiochiana.antioch.edu/McGregor%20cv.htm |title=Douglas McGregor |publisher=Antioch University |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023063315/http://antiochiana.antioch.edu/McGregor%20CV.htm |archivedate=October 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Human Side of Enterprise''==

In the book ''The Human Side of Enterprise'', McGregor identified an approach of creating an environment within which employees are motivated via authoritative direction and control or integration and self-control, which he called [[theory X and theory Y]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/specials/mit150/mitlist/?page=full|title=The MIT 150: 150 Ideas, Inventions, and Innovators that Helped Shape Our World|publisher=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=May 15, 2011|accessdate=August 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively. Theory Y is the practical application of Dr. [[Abraham Maslow]]'s Humanistic School of Psychology, or Third Force psychology, applied to scientific management.

He is commonly thought of as being a ''proponent'' of Theory Y, but, as [[Edgar Schein]] tells in his introduction to McGregor's subsequent, posthumous (1967), book ''The Professional Manager'' : "In my own contacts with Doug, I often found him to be discouraged by the degree to which theory Y had become as monolithic a set of principles as those of Theory X, the over-generalization which Doug was fighting....Yet few readers were willing to acknowledge that the content of Doug's book made such a neutral point or that Doug's own presentation of his point of view was that coldly scientific".

[[Graham Cleverley]] in ''Managers &amp; Magic'' (Longman's, 1971) comments: "...he coined the two terms [[Theory X and theory Y]] and used them to label two sets of beliefs a manager might hold about the origins of human behaviour. He pointed out that the manager's own behaviour would be largely determined by the particular beliefs that he subscribed to....McGregor hoped that his book would lead managers to investigate the two sets of beliefs, invent others, test out the assumptions underlying them, and develop managerial strategies that made sense in terms of those tested views of reality.
"But that isn't what happened. Instead McGregor was interpreted as advocating Theory Y as a new and superior ethic - a set of moral values that ''ought'' to replace the values managers usually accept."

''The Human Side of Enterprise'' was voted the fourth most influential management book of the 20th century in a poll of the Fellows of the [[Academy of Management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Bedeian |first1= Arthur G. |last2= Wren |first2= Daniel A. |author-link1= Arthur G.

==Legacy==
McGregor died, age 58, in [[Massachusetts]].  In 1964, the School of Adult and Experiential Learning at Antioch College was renamed the "McGregor School" in his honor. It was later renamed "Antioch University McGregor" and then "[[Antioch University Midwest]]."

Murrow]] Center Senior Fellow at The [[Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy]], and writes opinion pieces for ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', ''Inc. Magazine'', and other outlets.

==Early life and education==
Shihabi was born in [[Amman, Jordan]] in 1970. He is both an American and Jordanian citizen. He earned his BSc in Management from the [[University of Jordan]] in 1993. He then went on to earn his MBA from the University of Jordan in 1996 before earning his MSc in Leadership and Strategy from [[Georgetown University]] in 2006.&lt;ref name="Financial Times"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Steel|first1=Emily|title=Ehab Al Shihabi, Al Jazeera’s quiet American|website=Financial Times|accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Career==
Ehab Al Shihabi started his career as a management consultant at [[Arthur_Andersen#Andersen_Consulting_and_Accenture|Andersen Consulting]] in 1997. He later worked for [[KPGM]] and [[Deloitte]].&lt;ref name="Financial Times" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AlJazeera bio" /&gt;

Shihabi was hired by [[Al Jazeera Media Network]] in 2009 to be the Deputy Managing Director at [[Al Jazeera English]].&lt;ref name="NYT oust"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Koblin|first1=John|title=Al Jazeera America Chief Is Ousted After Turmoil|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/07/business/media/al-jazeera-america-chief-is-ousted-after-turmoil.html?_r=0|website=NYT|publisher=NYT|accessdate=9 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 he was named the Executive Director of international operations Al Jazeera Media Network. He was one of the principal people involved in the process of buying [[Current TV]] for $500 million and setting up [[Al Jazeera America]] (reaching 60 million homes), as well as [[Al Jazeera Türk]] and [[Al Jazeera Balkans]].&lt;ref name="AlJazeera bio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Financial Times" /&gt; Shihabi stated in regards to the launch of Al Jazeera America: "It's going to be run by American talent and staff for the American audience", adding there would be "less opinion, less yelling and fewer celebrity sightings".&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chicago Sunday Times"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rackl |first1=Lori |title=Al Jazeera adding Chicago reporters in push to expand U.S. audience |url=http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/television/19799118-421/al-jazeera-adding-chicago-reporters-in-push-to-expand-us-audience.html |website=Chicago Sunday Times |publisher=Chicago Sunday Times |accessdate=2 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130802133217/http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/television/19799118-421/al-jazeera-adding-chicago-reporters-in-push-to-expand-us-audience.html |archivedate=August 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He defined the channel as providing "accurate, in-depth, unbiased news stories".&lt;ref name=Capitalnewyork /&gt; [[Bob Meyers (journalist)|Bob Meyers]], president of the [[National Press Foundation]], titled that Jazeera's launch as "transformative".&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;

Shihabi had been largely involved in the business aspects of Al Jazeera America such as the budget for the channel and helping in securing carriage agreements with television carriers and making the channel available on different platforms such as carrier TV Everywhere platforms, in other words continuing its [[brand management|branding]] and awareness campaigns, while expanding its cable distribution and online presence.&lt;ref name=Capitalnewyork&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weprin|first1=Alex|title=Al Jazeera America C.E.O. previews ‘year two’ in staff memo|url=http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/media/2014/08/8550325/al-jazeera-america-ceo-previews-year-two-staff-memo|website=Capitalnewyork|publisher=Capitalnewyork|accessdate=9 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since January 2013, 900 people were hired for the new venture, a great part from other networks such as CNN and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], including [[John Seigenthaler]] and [[Kate O'Brian]].&lt;ref name=announcement&gt;{{cite web|title=Al Jazeera America announces launch date|url=https://en-maktoob.news.yahoo.com/al-jazeera-america-announces-launch-date-233606479.html|website=YahooNews|publisher=AlJazeera|accessdate=9 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jezebel /&gt;&lt;ref name="Deadline2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Al Jazeera America Taps Ehab Al Shihabi To Be Interim CEO|url=http://deadline.com/2013/07/al-jazeera-america-names-ehab-shihabi-ceo-546620/|website=Deadline|publisher=Deadline|accessdate=9 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16971">'''Eight dimensions of product quality management''' can be used at a [[Strategic management|strategic level]] to analyze [[Quality (business)|quality]] characteristics. The concept was defined by David A. Garvin, formerly C. Roland Christensen Professor of Business Administration at [[Harvard Business School]] (died 30 April 2017).&lt;ref&gt;Harvard Business School, [https://www.hbs.edu/news/releases/Pages/david-garvin-dies-at-64.aspx Harvard Business School Professor David A. Garvin Dies at 64], 5 May 2017, accessed 3 January 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the dimensions are mutually reinforcing, whereas others are not—improvement in one may be at the expense of others. Understanding the [[trade-off]]s desired by customers among these dimensions can help build a competitive advantage.

Garvin's eight dimensions can be summarized as follows:

#'''Performance''': Performance refers to a product's primary operating characteristics. This dimension of quality involves measurable attributes; brands can usually be ranked objectively on individual aspects of performance.
#'''Features''': Features are additional characteristics that enhance the appeal of the product or service to the user.
#'''Reliability''': Reliability is the likelihood that a product will not fail within a specific time period. This is a key element for users who need the product to work without fail.
#'''Conformance''': Conformance is the precision with which the product or service meets the specified standards.
#'''Durability''': Durability measures the length of a product’s life. When the product can be repaired, estimating durability is more complicated. The item will be used until it is no longer economical to operate it. This happens when the repair rate and the associated costs increase significantly.
#'''Serviceability''': Serviceability is the speed with which the product can be put into service when it breaks down, as well as the competence and the behavior of the service person.
#'''Aesthetics''': Aesthetics is the subjective dimension indicating the kind of response a user has to a product. It represents the individual’s personal preference.
#'''Perceived Quality''': Perceived Quality is the quality attributed to a good or service based on indirect measures.

==Performance==
Performance refers to a product's primary operating characteristics. This dimension of quality involves measurable attributes, so brands can usually be ranked objectively on individual aspects of performance. Overall performance rankings, however, are more difficult to develop, especially when they involve benefits that not every consumer needs. Performance is often a source of contention between customers and suppliers, particularly when deliverables are not adequately defined within specifications. The performance of a product often influences the profitability or reputation of the end-user. As such, many contracts or specifications include damages related to inadequate performance. The question of whether performance differences are quality differences may depend on circumstantial preferences-but preferences based on functional requirements, not taste.

Some performance standards are based on subjective preferences, but the preferences are so universal that they have the force of an objective standard.&lt;ref name="Competing on the eight dimensions of quality"/&gt;

==Features==
Features are additional characteristics that enhance the appeal of the product or service to the [[Consumer|user]].

Similar thinking can be applied to features, a second dimensions of quality that is often a secondary aspects of performance. Features are the "bells and whistles" of products and services, those characteristics that supplement their basic functioning. Examples include free drinks on a plane, permanent-press cycles on a washing machine, and automatic tuners on a color television set. The line separating primary performance characteristics from secondary features is often difficult to draw.&lt;ref name="Competing on the eight dimensions of quality"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://hbr.org/1987/11/competing-on-the-eight-dimensions-of-quality/ar/1 |title=Competing on the eight dimensions of quality |first= |last= |work=David A. Garvin, Harvard Business review |year=1987 |accessdate=December 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reliability==
Reliability is the likelihood that a product will not fail within a specific time period. This is a key element for users who need the product to work without fail.

This dimension reflects the probability of a product malfunctioning or failing within a specified time period. Among the most common measures of reliability are the mean time to first failure, the mean time between failures, and the failure rate per unit time. Because these measures require a product to be in use for a specified period, they are more relevant to durable goods than to products and services that are consumed instantly.

Reliability normally becomes more important to consumers as downtime and maintenance become more expensive. Farmers, for example, are especially sensitive to downtime during the short harvest season. Reliable equipment can mean the difference between a good year and spoiled crops. But consumers on other markets are more attuned than ever to product reliability too. Computers and copying machines certainly compare on this basis.

Reliability may be closely related to performance. For instance, a product specification may define parameters for up-time, or acceptable failure rates.

Reliability is a major contributor to brand or company image, and is considered a fundamental dimension of quality by most end-users. For example, recent market research shows that, especially for women, reliability has become an automobile's most desired attribute.&lt;ref name="Competing on the eight dimensions of quality"/&gt;

==Conformance==
[[File:Two approaches to conformance.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=|The outcome of two example processes to show the meaning of the two approaches to conformance]]
The dimension of conformance depicts to what extent a product’s design and operating characteristics meet established standards. This dimension owes the most to the traditional approaches to quality pioneered by experts like Juran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= |title=Quality handbook |first= |last= |work=Joseph M. Juran |year=1998 |accessdate=December 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All products and services involve specifications of some sort. When products are developed, these specifications are set and a target is set, for instance the materials used or the dimension of the product. Not only the target but also the tolerance (the range of permitted deviation from the target) is defined. One problem with this approach is that there is little interest in whether the specifications have been met exactly as long as the tolerance limits are met.

On the one hand, this can lead to the so-called “tolerance stack-up”. When two or more parts are to be fit together, the size of their tolerances often determine how well they will match. Should one part fall at a lower limit of its specification and a matching part at its upper limit, a tight fit is unlikely. The link is likely to wear more quickly than one made from parts whose dimensions have been centered more exactly.&lt;ref name="Competing on the eight dimensions of quality"/&gt;

This problem can be addressed by taking a different approach to measuring quality. Instead of measuring a simple conformance to specifications, the degree to which parts or products diverge from the ideal target is measured. Using this approach, process 1 (see picture) is better even though some items fall beyond specification limits. The traditional approach would have favoured process 2 because it produces more items within the specification limit. It was demonstrated that the problem of “tolerance stack-up” is worse when the dimensions of parts are more distant from the target than when they cluster around it, even if some parts fall outside the tolerance. This approach requires a fresh look at the common process quality factor of 'defect rate', to take into account the fact that two parts may each pass the 'tolerance test' separately but be unusable when the attempt is made to join them together.

In service businesses, measures of conformance normally focus on accuracy and timeliness and include counts of processing errors, unanticipated delays and other frequent mistakes.&lt;ref name="Competing on the eight dimensions of quality"/&gt;

==Durability==
[[Durable good|Durability]] measures the length of a product’s life. When the product can be repaired, estimating durability is more complicated. The item will be used until it is no longer economical to operate it. This happens when the repair rate and the associated costs increase significantly. Technically, durability can be defined as the amount of use one gets from a product before it deteriorates. After so many hours of use, the filament of a light bulb burns up and the bulb must be replaced. Repair is impossible. Economists call such products "one-hoss shays"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.legallanguage.com/resources/poems/onehossshay/ |title=The Wonderful One-Hoss Shay |first= |last= |work=LEGAL LANGUAGE SERVICES |year=1836 |accessdate=December 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Oliver Wendel Holmes]] poem).

In other cases, consumers must weigh the expected cost, in both dollars and personal inconvenience, of future repairs against the investment and operating expenses of a newer, more reliable model. Durability, then, may be defined as the amount of use one gets from a product before it breaks down and replacement is preferable to continued repair.

This approach to durability has two important implications. First, it suggests that durability and reliability are closely linked. A product that often fails is likely to be scrapped earlier than one that is more reliable; repair costs will be correspondingly higher and the purchase of a competitive brand will look that much more desirable. Second, this approach implies that durability figures should be interpreted with care. An increase in product life may not be the result of technical improvements or the use of longer-lived materials. Rather, the underlying economic environment simply may have changed.

==Serviceability==
Serviceability involves the consumer's ease of obtaining repair service (example: access to service centers and/or ease of self-service), the responsiveness of service personnel(example: ease of getting an appointment, willingness of repair personnel to listen to the customer), and the reliability of service (example: whether the service is performed right the first time).
Competence and ease of repair is the speed with which the product can be put into service when it breaks down, as well as the competence and the behavior of the [[Service (economics)|service]] personnel.

Consumers are concerned not only about a product breaking down but also about the time before service is restored, the timeliness with which service appointment are kept, the nature of dealings with service personnel, and the frequency with which service calls or repairs fail to correct outstanding problems. In those cases where problems are not immediately resolved and complaints are filed, a company's complaint handling procedures are also likely to affect customer's ultimate evaluation of product and service quality.

Some of these variables reflect differing personal standards of acceptable service, while others can be measured quite objectively.
Customers may remain dissatisfied even after completion of repairs. How these complaints are handled is important to a company's reputation for quality and service. Eventually, profitability is likely to be affected as well.
Companies differ widely in their approaches to complaint handling and in the importance they attach to this element of serviceability. Some do their best to resolve complaints; others use legal gimmicks, the [[silent treatment]] and similar ploys to rebuff dissatisfied customers.

For example, recently,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ntis.gov/ |title=Consumer Complaint Handling in America |first= |last= |work=Report |year=1979 |accessdate=December 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; General Electric, Procter &amp; Gamble and other companies have sought to preempt consumer dissatisfaction by installing toll-free telephone hot lines to their customer relations departments.

Important attributes for the serviceability dimension are service warranty, parts warranty, parts availability, distance to dealer service centers, distance to service parts center-dealer, distance to service parts center individual, length of wait for service appointment, schedule of preventive maintenance, employees listen to customers, information regarding repairs, courteous service centers, repaired correctly first time, service time relative to other dealers, warranty claims handled without argument, average repair cost/year, extended warranty, underestimation of service cost and provision of loan car.

==Aesthetics or Style==
The aesthetic properties of a product contribute to the identity of a company or a brand. Faults or defects in a product that diminish its aesthetic properties, even those that do not reduce or alter other dimensions of quality, are often cause for rejection.

Aesthetics refers to how the product looks, feels, sounds, tastes, or smells. It is clearly a matter of personal judgement and a reflection of individual preference. Nevertheless, there appear to be some patterns in consumers' rankings of products on the basis of taste.

A recent study of quality in 33 food categories, for example, found that high quality was most often associated with attributes such as "rich and full flavor, tastes natural, tastes fresh, good aroma, appetizing looks".{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} Aesthetics also refers to the "outside" feel of the product.

The aesthetics dimension differs from subjective criteria pertaining to "performance" in that aesthetic choices are not nearly universal. Not all people prefer "rich and full" flavor or even agree on what that means. Companies therefore have to search for a niche. On this dimension of quality, it is impossible to please everyone.&lt;ref name="Competing on the eight dimensions of quality"/&gt;

===Quality in Japanese culture===
In Japanese culture, there are two types of quality: ''atarimae hinshitsu'' and ''miryokuteki hinshitsu''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2006-02-14/delivering-two-kinds-of-quality |publisher=Bloomberg |title=Delivering Two Kinds of Quality |author=Keith R McFarland |date=15 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''atarimae hinshitsu''　– The idea that things will work as they are supposed to (e.g. a pen will write). The functional requirement actually. For example, a wall or flooring in a house have functional parts in the house as a product; when the functionality is met, the "atarimae" quality requirement is met.
* ''miryokuteki hinshitsu'' （魅力的品質）– The idea that things should have an aesthetic quality which is different from "atarimae hinshitsu" (e.g. a pen will write in a way that is pleasing to the writer, and leave behind ink that is pleasing to the reader). The floor and wall example can be expanded to include the color, texture, shine, polish, etc., which are the "miryokuteki" aspects. Such aspects comprise a very important part of the quality, and add value to the product.

In the design of goods or services, ''atarimae hinshitsu'' and ''miryokuteki hinshitsu'' together ensure that a creation will both work to customers' expectations and also be desirable to have.

==Perceived Quality==
Perception is not always reality.

Consumers do not always have complete information about a product's or service's attributes; indirect measures may be their only basis for comparing brands.

A product's durability for example, can seldom be observed directly; it usually must be inferred from various tangible and intangible aspects of the product. In such circumstances, images, advertising and brand names -inferences about quality rather than the reality itself- can be critical. For this reason, both Honda -which makes cars in Marysville, Ohio- and Sony -which builds color televisions in San Diego- have been reluctant to publicize that their products are "made in America".

Reputation is the primary stuff of perceived quality. Its power comes from an unstated analogy: that the quality of products today is similar to the quality of products of yesterday, or the quality of goods in a new product line is similar to the quality of a company's established products.&lt;ref name="Competing on the eight dimensions of quality"/&gt;

She holds a master's degree in English literature from [[King Abdul Aziz University]].

== Jeddah Chamber of Commerce and Industry ==
In 1998 she was appointed to establish the first women’s division in the Jeddah Chamber of Commerce and Industry&lt;ref name=destination&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destinationjeddah.com/portal/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1056:jeddahs-whos-who-fatin-bundagji-a-lady-with-a-message&amp;catid=143:business&amp;Itemid=531 |title=Jeddah’s Who’s Who Fatin Bundagji: A Lady With A Message }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; a position that is the first of its kind for Saudi women in all the Chambers of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

During her tenure at the Jeddah Chamber she founded and headed six departments that aimed to develop and promote women in management and in business. Her determination, will and vision allowed her to pave the way for the inclusion of women in the years to come. She was secretary general to the first business committee that led to the establishment of Sayidah Khadija Center at the Jeddah Chamber.

Bundagji established several departments for the advancement of women through business and employment - all of which consequently lead to the establishment of Sayidah Khadija BintKhuwailid Center for Business Women, a milestone in activating the role of business women is Jeddah, under the leadership and patronage of her Royal Highness Princess Adela Bint Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz.

Additionally, she was actively involved in several internal committees for the institutional advancement of the Chamber. She was an active member of the HR Mercer Team and won the highest number of votes from among her male colleagues during the chamber’s historic election for its Labor Union in 2003.

Her areas of expertise and passion are in organizational development, corporate citizenship, youth and women’s advancement through social entrepreneurship activities, community development and civic engagement - all of which are evident in her op-ed columns in ''[[Arab News|Arab News Daily]]''.

== Civil activities ==
On the civic level Bundagji was a key player in bringing about the desire of women to run for municipal council elections. In 2004, she was the first woman in the Western Region to announce her desire to run for elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabnews.com/node/255893|title=3 Women Nominate Themselves for Municipal Elections}}&lt;/ref&gt; And in 2009 she co-founded the Balady Initiative that advocates for the right of women to leadership positions in public office. She is a co-founder of MUWATANA a group that advocates for city development by focusing on man, place and the rule of law.&lt;ref name=destination/&gt;  The Group works actively with youths and was instrumental in catalyzing the emergency relief efforts of the [[2009 Jeddah floods|Jeddah floods]] of 2009 and 2011.

'''''Food Fight: The Inside Story of the Food Industry, America's Obesity Crisis, &amp; What We Can Do About It''''', published on September 16, 2004 by [[McGraw-Hill]], was written by [[Kelly D. Brownell]], Director of the [[Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/07/AR2009080702488.html|title=Can We Fight Obesity by Slapping a Heavy Tax on Soda?|last= Huget|first=Jennifer|date=11 August 2009|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book looks at the causes of the [[obesity]] epidemic in [[United States|America]] and why the crisis is spreading overseas. The book claims to reveal both the roots of the problem and what might be done, exploring the convergence of human nature, public indifference, and capitalistic spirit that has transformed the American waistline and jeopardized the nation’s health.

The authors critique the current culture of America, one that fosters a "[[toxic food environment]]" and promotes poor eating habits. The book also proposes public policy solutions for reversing the obesity trend and enabling individuals, families, and communities to adopt healthier diets.

== Two sides of the food fight ==
The book analyzes the two passionately divided sides of the current debate, or “food fight.”  One side argues that obesity, like smoking, is a public health crisis that demands governmental involvement in order to achieve a solution.  Advocates of this viewpoint suggest that government use its legislative power to subsidize production of healthier foods, to [[regulation|regulate]] [[food industry]] practices, and to minimize the extent of [[junk food]] advertising to children.  Brownell and Horgen support this side of the debate throughout their book.

The other side argues that weight is a matter of personal responsibility, and food choice should not be regulated by government in any capacity. Proponents of this viewpoint support prohibiting lawsuits against food companies and restaurants for their culpability in the obesity epidemic.  Advocates of this viewpoint include lobbyists for the food industry.{{Cn|date=April 2018}}

The '''Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977''' ('''FCPA''') ({{UnitedStatesCode|15|78dd-1}}, ''et seq.'') is a [[United States federal law]] known primarily for two of its main provisions: one that addresses accounting transparency requirements under the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934]] and another concerning [[bribery]] of [[foreign official]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=T.

== Provisions and scope ==
The core aim of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) is to prohibit companies and their individual officers from influencing foreign officials with any personal payments or rewards.&lt;ref name="McGraw-Hill Education"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Luthans|first1=Fred|last2=Doh|first2=Jonathan|title=International Management Culture, Strategy, and Behavior|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-07-786244-2|edition=9th}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2015}} The FCPA applies to any person who has a certain degree of connection to the United States and engages in corrupt practices abroad, as well as to U.S. businesses, foreign corporations trading securities in the U.S., American nationals, citizens, and residents acting in furtherance of a foreign corrupt practice, whether or not they are physically present in the U.S. This is considered the [[nationality principle]] of the Act. Any individuals involved in these activities may face prison time.&lt;ref name="McGraw-Hill Education"/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2015}} 

In the case of foreign [[natural person|natural]] and [[juridical person|legal person]]s, the Act covers their deeds if they are in the U.S. at the time of the corrupt conduct. This is considered the [[protective principle]] of the Act.&lt;ref name="McGraw-Hill Education" /&gt; Moreover, the FCPA governs not only direct payments to foreign officials, candidates, and parties, but payments made to any other recipient in furtherance of influencing a foreign official, candidate, or party. These payments are not restricted to monetary forms and may include anything of value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Combating Corruption Under International Law |work=School of Law, Duke University |format=pdf |first=Alejandro |last=Posadas

The FCPA is subject to ongoing scholarly and congressional debate regarding its effects on international commerce. Scholars have found that its enforcement discourages U.S. firms from investing in foreign markets, particularly those where graft, bribery, and other forms of corruption are endemic.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://muse.union.edu/lamacroworkshop2015/files/2015/01/11-Graham-and-Stroup-2015-AEL-forthcoming.pdf|title = Does Anti-bribery Enforcement Deter Foreign Investment?|last = Graham, Bradley|first = Stroup, Caleb|date = 2016|journal = Applied Economics Letters|doi = 10.1080/13504851.2015.1049333|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This coincides with the well established observation that companies engaging in [[mergers and acquisitions]] in emerging markets face a uniquely increased level of regulatory and corruption risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.transactionadvisors.com/insights/tackling-corruption-and-regulatory-risk-ma-transactions|title=Tackling Corruption and Regulatory Risk in M&amp;A Transactions|last1=Brooks|first1=Robin|last2=Stacey|first2=Oliver|publisher=Transaction Advisors|last3=Jarman|first3=Daniel|ISSN=2329-9134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Investigations by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] in the mid-1970s revealed that over 400 U.S. companies admitted making questionable or illegal payments in excess of $300 million to foreign government officials, politicians, and political parties.&lt;ref name=house&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. Rep. 95-640 REPORT together with MINORITY VIEWS To accompany H.R.3815|author=House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce|url=http://www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa/history/1977/houseprt-95-640.pdf|date=September 28, 1977|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The abuses ran the gamut from [[bribery]] of high foreign officials to secure some type of favorable action by a foreign government, to so-called [[facilitating payment]]s that were made to ensure that government functionaries discharged certain ministerial or clerical duties.&lt;ref name=house /&gt; If the official has no choice but to bribe, and bribery is legal in the country, bribing is seen as necessary for "greasing the wheels", i.e. facilitating the conduct of business. Among the major examples of such practices weres the [[Lockheed bribery scandals]], in which officials of [[aerospace]] company [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] paid foreign officials in several countries to favor their company's products,&lt;ref&gt;Rich, Ben R. and Janos, Leo. ''Skunk Works: A Personal Memoir of My Years at Lockheed''. New York: Little Brown &amp; Co., 1994,  {{ISBN|0-7515-1503-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10}} and the [[Bananagate]] scandal, in which [[Chiquita Brands]] bribed the President of [[Honduras]] for more favorable government policies. 

In response to these high profile revelations, [[United States Congress|Congress]] enacted the FCPA to bring a halt to the bribery of foreign officials and to restore public confidence in the integrity of the American business system. The Act was signed into law by President [[Jimmy Carter]] on December 19, 1977. The first criminal enforcement action under the Act was against [[Finbar Kenny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United States of America v. Kenny International Corp., et al.|url=http://fcpa.stanford.edu/enforcement-action.html?id=435|website=Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Clearinghouse|publisher=[[Stanford Law School]]|accessdate=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kenny had advanced [[Albert Henry (politician)|Sir Albert Henry]], Prime Minister of the Cook Islands, $337,000 from postage stamp revenue for Henry's re-election campaign.&lt;ref name=McBride&gt;{{cite news|last1=McBride|first1=Stewart|title=The case of the airmailed voter and other tales of the Cook Is|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/1982/0304/030461.html|accessdate=27 April 2018|work=[[Christian Science Monitor]]|date=4 March 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, Kenny became the first American to plead guilty of violating the FCPA, and was fined $50,000.&lt;ref name=McBride /&gt;

The Act was first amended by the [[Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act]] of 1988, where Title V is known as the 'Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Amendments of 1988'. It introduced a "knowing" standard in order to find violations of the Act, encompassing "conscious disregard" and "willful blindness." Other amendments were for "bona fide", "reasonable" and lawful gifts under the laws of the foreign country.&lt;ref name=fas&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41466.pdf|title=Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, Congressional Interest and Executive Enforcement|author=Michael V. Seitzinger|publisher=Congressional Research Service|work=CRS Report to U.S. Congress|date=February 7, 2012|pages=11|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second amendment was the [[International Anti-Bribery Act of 1998]] which was designed to implement the [[OECD Anti-Bribery Convention]]—i.e., to include certain foreign persons and extending the scope beyond U.S. borders.

The FCPA dominated international [[anti-corruption]] enforcement from its introduction until around 2010 when other countries began introducing broader and more robust legislation, notably the United Kingdom [[Bribery Act 2010]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nortonrosefulbright.com/knowledge/publications/52195/differences-between-the-uk-bribery-act-and-the-us-foreign-corrupt-practices-act|title=Differences between the UK Bribery Act and the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Breslin|first=Brigid|author2=Doron Ezickson|author3=John Kocoras|year=2010|title=The Bribery Act 2010: raising the bar above the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act|journal=Company Lawyer|publisher=Sweet &amp; Maxwell|volume=31|issue=11|issn=0144-1027|page=362}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Organization for Standardization introduced an international anti-bribery management system standard in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://knowledge.freshfields.com/m/Global/r/1698/new_global_framework_for_anti-bribery_and_corruption|title=New global framework for anti-bribery and corruption compliance programs Freshfields knowledge|website=knowledge.freshfields.com|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, cooperation in enforcement action between countries has increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.freshfields.com/globalassets/services-page/global-investigations/publication-pdfs/gi-abc-guide-2017.pdf|title=Anti-bribery and corruption: global enforcement and legislative developments 2017|last=|first=|date=January 2017|website=|publisher=Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer|access-date=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] are ''both'' responsible for enforcing the FCPA. This is because the FCPA both amends an SEC Act and the criminal code. The SEC enforces the Act for companies it regulates and the Department of Justice enforces the bill regarding all other domestic companies. This split was criticized even before the act was passed.&lt;ref name=house/&gt;{{rp|10–11}}
In 2010 the SEC created a specialized unit for FCPA enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SEC Names New Specialized Unit Chiefs and Head of New Office of Market Intelligence|url=https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2010/2010-5.htm|publisher=SEC|accessdate=23 February 2015|format=Press release|date=January 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2012, the SEC and the DOJ issued their first joint guide to the FCPA.&lt;ref name=resource&gt;{{cite web|author1=Criminal Division of the U.S. Department of Justice and the Enforcement Division of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|title=A Resource Guide to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act|url=https://www.sec.gov/spotlight/fcpa/fcpa-resource-guide.pdf|accessdate=23 February 2015|pages=130|date=November 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, Attorney General [[Jeff Sessions]] traveled to an ethics lawyers conference to assure them that he would continue prosecutions under the FCPA, regardless of new SEC Chairman [[Jay Clayton (attorney)|Jay Clayton]]'s expressed skepticism and of President [[Donald Trump]]'s comments that it is a "horrible law" and "the world is laughing at us".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=[[Charlie Savage]]|title=Sessions Vows to Enforce an Anti-Bribery Law Trump Ridiculed|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/24/us/politics/jeff-sessions-anti-bribery.html|accessdate=13 May 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=25 April 2017|page=A14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Attorney General Jeff Sessions Delivers Remarks at the Ethics and Compliance Initiative's Conference|url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?427358-1/attorney-general-jeff-sessions-delivers-remarks-ethics-compliance-initiatives-confernece|accessdate=13 May 2017|work=C-SPAN.org|date=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requirements==
The anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA make it unlawful for a U.S. person, and certain foreign issuers of [[securities]], to make a payment to a [[foreign official]] for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business for or with, or directing business to, any person. Since the 1998 Amendment of FCPA they also apply to foreign firms and persons who take any act in furtherance of such a corrupt payment while in the U.S. The meaning of foreign official is broad. For example, an owner of a bank who is also the minister of finance would count as a foreign official according to the U.S. government. Doctors at government-owned or managed hospitals are also considered to be foreign officials under the FCPA, as is anyone working for a government-owned or managed institution or enterprise. Employees of international organizations such as the United Nations are also considered to be foreign officials under the FCPA. A 2014 federal appellate court decision has provided guidance on how the term "foreign official" is defined under FCPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Michael V. Seitzinger|title=Eleventh Circuit Provides Guidance for the Definition of "Foreign Official" under the FCPA|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/fcpa.pdf|website=Legal Sidebar via Congressional Research Service|publisher=Federation of American Scientists|accessdate=23 February 2015|date=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the Act concerns the intent of the bribery rather than the amount, there is no requirement of [[materiality (law)|materiality]]. Offering anything of value as a bribe, whether cash or non-cash items, is prohibited.

The FCPA also requires companies whose securities are listed in the U.S. to meet its accounting provisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|15|78m}}&lt;/ref&gt; These accounting provisions operate in tandem with the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA, and require respective corporations to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the corporation and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. An increasing number of corporations are taking additional steps to protect their reputation and reduce their exposure by employing the services of [[due diligence]] companies tasked with vetting third party intermediaries and identifying easily overlooked government officials embedded in otherwise privately held foreign firms. This strategy is one element of an effective FCPA Compliance Program, as it shows a sincere attempt to avoid business situations where high risk (prior history or proximity to unethical behavior) individuals are concerned.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Regarding payments to foreign officials, the act draws a distinction between bribery and facilitation or "grease payments", which may be permissible under the FCPA, but may still violate local laws. The primary distinction is that grease payments or facilitation payments are made to an official to expedite his performance of the routine duties he is already bound to perform. The exception focuses on the purpose of the payment rather than on its value.Payments to foreign officials may be legal under the FCPA if the payments are permitted under the written laws of the host country. Certain payments or reimbursements relating to product promotion may also be permitted under the FCPA.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

A U.S. company acquiring a foreign firm could face successor liability for FCPA violations committed by the foreign firm prior to being acquired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lawler|first1=William|last2=Phillips|first2=Anthony | title=Avoiding the Threat of FCPA Successor Liability|url=https://www.transactionadvisors.com/insights/avoiding-threat-fcpa-successor-liability|publisher=Transaction Advisors |ISSN=2329-9134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, acquiring companies may be liable as a successor for pre-existing FCPA violations committed by an acquired company where those violations were subject to the FCPA's jurisdiction when committed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sprinzen |first1=Nicole |last2=Hildebrand |first2=Jennifer |title=DOJ Clarifies Successor Liability for Foreign Acquisitions |url=https://www.transactionadvisors.com/insights/doj-clarifies-successor-liability-foreign-acquisitions |publisher=Transaction Advisors |ISSN=2329-9134}}&lt;/ref&gt; This position was further confirmed by the DOJ in a 2014 opinion stating that pre-acquisition conduct by a foreign target company without a jurisdictional nexus to the U.S. would not be subject to FCPA enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fisher|first1=Alice|last2=Greenburg|first2=Douglas|last3=Sabin|first3=Barry|last4=Seltzer|first4=Nathan|last5=Su|first5=Jonathan|last6=Volkman|first6=Eric|last7=Chandler|first7=Kari|last8=Brown Jones|first8=Erin|title=DOJ Guidance Underscores Importance of Anti-corruption Due Diligence in International M&amp;A |url=https://www.transactionadvisors.com/insights/doj-guidance-underscores-importance-anti-corruption-due-diligence-international-ma|publisher=Transaction Advisors|ISSN=2329-9134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-bribery/anti-corruption (ABAC) solutions===

Businesses increasingly focus on their [[Core competency|core competencies]], and as a result engage more third parties to provide critical business functions. Companies do not have direct control over their third-party providers, which expose them to regulatory and reputational risk of FCPA violations by those third parties.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.economist.com/media/globalexecutive/outsourcing_revolution_e_02.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Under the FCPA, businesses are accountabile for activities involving both their internal and external relationships. Companies that operate internationally, or that engage third parties in countries with a high [[Corruption Perceptions Index]], are especially at risk.  Many companies have now adopted "anti-bribery/anti-corruption" (ABAC) solutions to combat this risk and help protect themselves from fines and reputational damage.

ABAC compliance solutions are a subset of [[third party management]].  These systems can automatically manage [[Third party management#Third parties|third party]] information and monitor their ongoing activities in compliance with FCPA regulation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hiperos.com/anti-bribery-corruption.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==
The FCPA provides the DoJ and the SEC discretion to pursue international bribery. While several companies and individuals have been prosecuted for violating the FCPA, the most prominent industries or sectors are pharmaceuticals, medical device, chemicals, energy and construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Which Industries Are Subject To The FCPA? |url=https://whistleblowerjustice.net/whistleblower-info/faqs/which-industries-are-subject-to-the-fcpa/ |website=Whistleblower Justice Network |accessdate=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stronger DOJ and SEC enforcement has increased the prominence of the FCPA from 2010 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perkinscoie.com/files/upload/11_01_03_FunkArticle.pdf T. Markus Funk, "Another Landmark Year: 2010 FCPA Enforcement Year-in-Review and Trends for 2011," Bloomberg Law Reports (January 3, 2010)].&lt;/ref&gt; The SEC website shows a complete list of enforcement cases since 1978.&lt;ref name=fcpacases&gt;{{cite web|title=SEC Enforcement Actions: FCPA Cases|url=https://www.sec.gov/spotlight/fcpa/fcpa-cases.shtml|publisher=SEC|accessdate=23 February 2015|date=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable select cases of the application of FCPA since 2008 are with ALCOA, Biomet, Bizjet, Hewlett Packard Company, KBR, Marubeni Corporation, News Corporation, Siemens, Smith &amp; Nephew and Walmart de Mexico as follows:

In 2008, [[Siemens AG]] paid a $450 million fine for [[Siemens Greek bribery scandal|violating the FCPA]].

In 2012, Japanese firm [[Marubeni Corporation]] paid a criminal penalty of US$54.6 million for FCPA violations when acting as an agent of the TKSJ joint venture, which comprised [[Technip]], [[Snamprogetti]] Netherlands B.V., [[KBR (company)|Kellogg Brown &amp; Root Inc.]], and [[JGC Corporation]]. Between 1995 and 2004, the joint venture won four contracts in Nigeria worth more than US$6 billion, as a direct result of having paid US$51 million to Marubeni to be used to bribe Nigerian government officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2012/January/12-crm-060.html|title=Marubeni Corporation Resolves Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Investigation and Agrees to Pay a $54.6 Million Criminal Penalty|author=US Department of Justice|date=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 [[Smith &amp; Nephew]] paid US$22.2 million to the DOJ and SEC, and [[Bizjet]] International Sales and Support Inc. paid US$11.8 million to the DOJ for bribery of foreign government officials.

[[Fundamental analysis]] software automates analysis that supports fundamental analysts in their review of a company's financial statements and valuation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fundamental Analysis: Introduction|url=http://www.investopedia.com/university/fundamentalanalysis/|publisher=Investopedia.com|accessdate=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==

The following are the most common features of fundamental analysis applications.

===Backtesting===

Enables traders to test fundamental analysis strategies or algorithms to see what kind of return they would have achieved if they had invested based on that strategy or algorithm in the past. Backtest results will typically display total and annualized returns compared to a benchmark such as the [[S&amp;P 500]]. In addition to returns, backtest results will also display [[Volatility (finance)|volatility]] statistics such as average beta or maximum drawdown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Backtesting: Interpreting The Past|url=http://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/05/030205.asp|publisher=Investopedia.com|accessdate=9 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scanner===

Stock scanning, or screening, is the most common feature of fundamental analysis software. Scanners enable users to 'scan' the market, be it stocks, options, currencies etc., to identify investment opportunities that meet a user's specific investment criteria. Using a fundamental analysis scanner, a user could, for example, scan the market to identify stocks with below industry average PE Ratios and above industry average sales growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stock Screener|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockscreener.asp|publisher=Investopedia.com|accessdate=9 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alerts===

Alerts are a common feature of fundamental analysis software. Alerts will typically notify the investor to buy or sell a stock, or notify an investor when a stock enters or exits his/her saved strategy. When alert conditions are met, a notification is typically communicated via an on screen pop up or sent as an email.

===Data Feed===

Fundamental analysis software is typically used with end of day (EOD), delayed or real time data feeds. EOD data feeds provide the end of day close, open, high, and low price for the given equity and is typically updated once a day at market close. Delayed data is typically delayed 15 to 30 minutes depending on the exchange and is the most commonly used data feed type. Real time data feeds provide tick by tick 'real time' data.

===Built in Strategies===

Most fundamental analysis software includes built in strategies that have been validated with [[backtesting]] to give positive returns on average. Some examples of built in strategies include: Stock Investor Pro's IBD Stable 70 or Equities Lab's Dividend Champions. Users will typically find a built in strategy that aligns with their interests and investment style then follow the strategy to keep up with stocks that pass the strategy.

===Broker Interface===

Some fundamental analysis software can be integrated with brokerage platforms to enable traders to place trades, or to update the users portfolio with what is actually held in the brokerage account.

== Innovations ==
The company has innovated the UPrep column&lt;ref&gt;Campa, Michael (2007). UPrep Universal Spin Filter Column. Retrieved March 19, 2008 from [http://www.biocompare.com/review/672/UPrep-Universal-Spin-Filter-Column-From-Genesee-Scientific.htmlBiocompare Biocompare]&lt;/ref&gt; used in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) purification. The idea behind the UPrep column, is that most, if not all, nucleic acid purification or clean-up kits come equipped with 10-15% more reagent volume than is actually needed for the number of columns the kit contains. This means that for a kit with 100 columns, you end up with enough reagent for another 10 to 15 preps after you run out of columns. Normally, this excess reagent is tossed out. UPrep columns allow you to use this extra reagent for additional preps.

Genesee Scientific has also been responsible for developing Blue Devil autoradiography film&lt;ref&gt;Dell, Emily A., Bowman, Daniel, Rufty,Thomas, Shi, Wei. "Intensive Management Affects Composition of Betaproteobacterial Ammonia Oxidizers in Turfgrass Systems." ''Microbial Ecology.'' October 14, 2007. Accessed on April 21, 2008 from [http://www.springerlink.com/content/rt7602j473802621 SpringerLink]&lt;/ref&gt; which produces exceptional clarity and sharpness with extremely low backgrounds. Blue Devil Film is used for blotting, sequencing, chemiluminescent autoradiography (ecl) and gel shift analysis. It is designed for use with 14C, 35S, 32P, and 125I.

=== ''Drosophila'' Research ===
Genesee Scientific is the world leader in innovation for and supply to the ''[[Drosophila]]'' (fruit fly) research community. ''[[Drosophila]]'' are widely used as a model organism in the field of genetics.

Genesee Scientific has been awarded three patents by the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] for its revolutionary ''[[Drosophila]]'' vial racking system (patent numbers D673,296 S; 8,136,679 B2; and 8,430,251 B2). This ''[[Drosophila]]'' vial racking system significantly decreases time spent racking vials and is more environmentally friendly compared to traditional vial packaging configurations.

Genesee Scientific has also developed the first atlas of ''[[Drosophila]]'' phenotypic markers available on mobile devices. Genesee the ''[[Drosophila]]'' App is a free tool providing researchers with a quick reference to various ''[[Drosophila]]'' [[phenotypes]] and is a valuable teaching tool for new ''[[Drosophila]]'' researchers.

==Ancient law==
{{quote box|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|width=22em|align=right|salign=right|quote= "If a man fails to fulfill an agreed contract - unless he had contracted to do [[Ex turpi causa non oritur actio|something forbidden]] by law or decree, or gave his consent under [[Duress#In contract law|some iniquitous pressure]], or was involuntarily prevented from fulfilling his contract because of [[Frustration of purpose|some unlooked-for accident]] - an action for such an unfulfilled agreement should be brought in the tribal courts, if the parties have not previously been able to reconcile their differences before arbitrators (their neighbors, that is)."|source= [[Plato]], ''[[The Laws]]'', Book 11, §23, Contracts.}}
English contract law's history was heavily influenced by Ancient Greek and Roman thought. In ''[[The Laws]]'', [[Plato]] devoted little attention to forms of agreement, but recognized the same basic categories for cancelling agreements as exist today. [[Roman law]] identified discrete categories of contractual transaction, each with its own requirements, which needed to be fulfilled in order for promises to be enforced. The general kind, ''[[stipulatio]]'', required various words to be used to generate an obligation, or in a ''[[contractus litteris]]'' it could be written down. There were four categories of consensual agreement,&lt;ref&gt;(''[[emptio venditio]]''), hire (''[[locatio conductio]]''), partnership (''[[societas]]'') and mandate (''[[mandatum]]'')&lt;/ref&gt; and four kinds of [[Real contracts in Roman law|contract creating property rights]], such as a pledge (''[[pignus]]'') or a secured loan (''[[mutuum]]''). More than appeared from the general rules in Ancient Greece, Roman law represented an early division between specific kinds of contract, depending on the transaction's nature.&lt;ref&gt;See further B Nicholas, ''An Introduction to Roman Law'' (Clarendon 1963) 165-193&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval law==

===England in the Middle Ages===
{{main article|History of English contract law}}
During the [[middle ages]], the English court system was minimal and so a number of methods for restricting access to judicial hearings. In the local and manorial courts, according to the first treatise by [[Ranulf de Glanville]], ''[[Treatise on the laws and customs of the English Kingdom]]'' in 1188, if people disputed the payment of a debt they, and witnesses, would attend court and swear oaths (called a [[wager of law]]).&lt;ref&gt;R. de Glanville, ''[[Tractatus de legibus et consuetudinibus regni Angliae]]'' (1188) [https://archive.org/stream/translationofgla00glanuoft#page/216/mode/2up 216 ff]&lt;/ref&gt; They risked perjury if they lost the case, and so this was strong encouragement to resolve disputes elsewhere. The royal courts accepted claims, without a wager of law, if "[[trespass on the case]]" was alleged. A jury would be called, but to access the royal courts, which were fixed by the [[Magna Carta 1215]] to meet in London, some breach of the King's peace had to be alleged. But gradually, the courts allowed claims where there had been no such trouble, no [[tort]] ''[[vi et armis]]'', even though it was still necessary to inventively plead this. For instance, in 1317 one Simon de Rattlesdene alleged he was sold a [[tun (unit)|tun]] of wine that was contaminated with salt water, "with force and arms, namely with swords and bows and arrows".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Rattlesdene v Grunestone]]'' (1317) Year Books 10 Edw II, Selden Society vol 54&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Court of Chancery]] and the [[Court of King's Bench (England)|King's Bench]] started to allow claims without the fictitious allegation of force and arms from around 1350. Otherwise, a breach of ''[[covenant (law)|covenant]]'' required production of proof of an agreement from a [[seal (contract law)|seal]]. However, in  ''[[The Humber Ferryman’s case]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bukton v Tounesende]]'' (1348) Baker &amp; Milsom 358&lt;/ref&gt; a claim was allowed, without any documentary evidence, against a ferryman who dropped a horse overboard that he was contracted to carry across the [[River Humber]]. Despite this liberalisation, in the 1200s a threshold of 40 shillings for dispute value had been created. Though its importance tapered away with gradual inflation, it foreclosed court access to most people.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Statute of Gloucester 1278]]&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, freedom to contract was firmly suppressed among the peasantry. After the [[Black Death]], the [[Statute of Labourers 1351]] prevented any increase in workers' wages, fuelling among other things the [[Peasants' Revolt of 1381]].

With the courts' hostility to restraints on trade, the doctrine of consideration was forming, that to enforce any obligation something of value needed to be conveyed.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''[[Dyer’s case]]'' (1414) 2 Hen. V, fol. 5, pl. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Some courts remained sceptical that damages might be awarded purely for a broken agreement (that was not a [[Seal (contract law)|sealed]] [[covenant (law)|covenant]]).&lt;ref&gt;Watkins’ or Wykes’ case (1425) Baker &amp; Milsom 380, 383, where a man had promised to build a mill, but had failed, per Martin, J., 383, ‘if this action should be maintained… then a man would have an action of trespass for every broken covenant in the world.’&lt;/ref&gt; Other disputes allowed a remedy, notably in ''[[Shepton v Dogge]]''&lt;ref&gt;(1442) Baker &amp; Milsom 390&lt;/ref&gt; where a defendant had agreed in London, where the City courts' custom was to allow claims without covenants under seal, to sell 28 acres of land in [[Hoxton]]. Although the house itself was outside London at the time, in [[Middlesex]], a remedy was awarded for [[deceit]], but essentially based on a failure to convey the land. The resolution of these restrictions came shortly after 1585, when a new [[Court of Exchequer Chamber]] was established to hear common law appeals. In 1602, in ''[[Slade v Morley]]'',&lt;ref&gt;(1602) 76 ER 1074&lt;/ref&gt; a grain merchant named Slade claimed that Morley had agreed to buy wheat and rye for £16, but had backed out. Actions for debt were in the jurisdiction of the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]], but it had required that there needed to be both (1) proof of a debt, and (2) a subsequent promise to repay the debt, so that a finding of [[deceit]] (for non-payment) could be made against a defendant.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. D. Ibbetson, 'Sixteenth Century Contract Law: Slade's Case in Context' (1984) 4(3) Oxford Journal of Legal Studies 295, 296&lt;/ref&gt; But if a claimant wanted to simply demand payment of the contractual debt (rather than a subsequent promise to pay) he could have to risk a [[wager of law]]. The judges of the [[Court of the King's Bench]] was prepared to allow "[[assumpsit]]" actions (for obligations being assumed) simply from proof of the original agreement.&lt;ref&gt;See further, [[A. W. B. Simpson]], ''A History of the Common Law of Contract: the Rise of the Action of Assumpsit'' (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; With a majority in the Exchquer Chamber, after six years [[John Popham (judge)|Lord Popham CJ]] held that "every contract importeth in itself an Assumpsit".&lt;ref&gt;See further, J. H. Baker, ‘New Light on Slade's Case’ (1971) 29 Cambridge Law Journal 51&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time the Common Pleas indicated a different limit for contract enforcement in ''[[Bret v JS]]'',&lt;ref&gt;(1600) Cro Eliz 756&lt;/ref&gt; that "natural affection of itself is not a sufficient [[Consideration in English law|consideration]] to ground an assumpsit" and there had to be some "express ''[[quid pro quo]]''".&lt;ref&gt;In the popular consciousness, see [[Christopher Marlowe]], ''[[The Tragicall History of the Life and Death of Doctor Faustus]]'' (1604)&lt;/ref&gt; Now that wager of law, and sealed covenants were essentially unnecessary, the [[Statute of Frauds 1677]] codified the contract types that were thought should require some form.

===European trade===
[[File:Carta Marina.jpeg|thumb|left|300px|Merchants trading within the [[Hanseatic League]] conducted their affairs according to the ''[[lex mercatoria]]'', whose principles were received into the English law of contract.]]
Increasingly, English contract law was affected by its trading relations with northern Europe, particularly since the [[Magna Carta 1215]] guaranteed merchants "safe and secure" exit and entry to England "for buying and selling by the ancient rights and customs, quit from all evil tolls".&lt;ref&gt;[[Magna Carta 1215]] [[s:Source Problems in English History/Appendix/Magna Carta. 1215|§41]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1266 [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]] had granted the [[Hanseatic League]] a charter to trade in England. The "Easterlings" who came to trade brought goods and money that the English came to call "[[Pound sterling|Sterling]]",&lt;ref&gt;HS Barker, 'The Rise of the Lex Mercatoria and Its Absorption by the Common Law of England' (1916–1917) [http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/kentlj5&amp;div=38&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals#189 5 Kentucky Law Journal 20, 24]&lt;/ref&gt; and standard rules for commerce that formed a ''[[Lex Mercatoria]]'', the laws of the merchants. Merchant custom was most influential in the coastal trading ports like [[London]], [[Boston, Lincolnshire|Boston]], [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] and [[King's Lynn]].

In the 1500s, litigation sharply increased, although the causes are unclear and it may have been due to a centralization of lawsuits in the King's Bench and Common Pleas.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Structure of Judicial Administration and the Development of Contract Law in Seventeenth-Century England|jstor = 1122128|journal = Columbia Law Review|date = 1983-01-01|pages = 35–137|volume = 83|issue = 1|doi = 10.2307/1122128|first = Clinton W.|last = Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chief Justices received a large portion of their income from fees paid by litigants, mostly in civil disputes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Industrial revolution==

===Continental Europe===
*[[Code Napoleon]] 1810
*[[German Civil Code]] 1900

===United Kingdom===
Over the industrial revolution, English courts became more and more wedded to the concept of "[[freedom of contract]]". It was partly a sign of progress, as the vestiges of feudal and mercantile restrictions on workers and businesses were lifted, a move of people from "status to contract".&lt;ref&gt;HJS Maine, ''Ancient Law'' (1861) ch 6&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, a preference for ''[[laissez faire]]'' thought concealed the [[inequality of bargaining power]] in contracts of employment, consumer, and tenancy. At the centre, captured in nursery rhymes like [[Robert Browning]]'s ''[[Pied Piper of Hamelin]]'' in 1842 was the fabled notion that if people had promised something "let us keep our promise".&lt;ref&gt;R Browning, ''[[Pied Piper of Hamelin]]'' (1842) [[s:The Pied Piper of Hamelin (Browning)|XV]]&lt;/ref&gt; But then, as if everybody had the same degree of free will, a generalised law of contract purported to cover every form of agreement was expounded. Courts were suspicious of interfering in agreements, whoever the parties were, so that in ''[[Printing and Numerical Registering Co v Sampson]]'' [[Sir George Jessel MR]] proclaimed that "contracts when entered into freely and voluntarily shall be held sacred and shall be enforced by Courts of justice."&lt;ref&gt;(1875) 19 Eq 462, 465&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Judicature Act 1875]] merged the [[Courts of Chancery]] and common law, with equitable principles (such as [[estoppel]], [[undue influence]], [[Rescission (contract law)|rescission]] for misrepresentation and [[fiduciary duties]] or disclosure requirements in some transactions) always taking precedence. But the essential principles of English contract law remained stable and familiar, as an offer for certain terms, mirrored by an acceptance, supported by consideration, and free from duress, undue influence or misrepresentation, would generally be enforceable. The rules were exported across the [[British Empire]], as for example in the [[Indian Contract Act 1872]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Indian Contract Act 1872]] ([http://www.commonlii.org/in/legis/num_act/ica1872152/ c 9] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522115110/http://www.commonlii.org/in/legis/num_act/ica1872152/ |date=2011-05-22 }})&lt;/ref&gt; Further requirements of fairness in exchanges between unequal parties, or general obligations of good faith and disclosure were unwarranted because was said that liabilities "are not to be forced upon people behind their backs".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Falcke v Scottish Imperial Insurance Co]]'' (1886) 34 Ch 234&lt;/ref&gt; Parliament's statutes, outside general codifications of commercial law like the [[Sale of Goods Act 1893]], left people to the harsh "[[freedom of contract]]" of the [[Market (economics)|market]] until the property qualifications for Parliament were reduced, and the electoral vote finally became democratic.&lt;ref&gt;This took place from the [[Second Reform Act 1867]], the [[Representation of the People Act 1883]], male suffrage with the [[RPA 1918]], equal ages for men and women to vote from [[RPA 1928]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Twentieth century==
[[File:ViaPanisp.jpg|thumb|right|[[Unidroit]], based in [[Rome]] and established in 1926 under the [[League of Nations]] to unify [[private law]], maintains the influential [[Principles of International Commercial Contracts]] of [https://web.archive.org/web/20100705003751/http://www.unidroit.org/english/principles/contracts/principles2004/blackletter2004-english.pdf 2004]. A similar effort is the [[Principles of European Contract Law]] of [http://www.jus.uio.no/lm/eu.contract.principles.parts.1.to.3.2002/ 2002].]]
Over the 20th century, legislation and changes' in court attitudes effected a wide-ranging reform of 19th century contract law.&lt;ref&gt;See generally [[PS Atiyah]], ''[[The Rise and Fall of Freedom of Contract]]'' (Oxford 1979), MJ Horwitz, 'The historical foundations of modern contract law' (1974) [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1340045 87(5) Harvard Law Review 917] and AWB Simpson, 'The Horwitz Thesis and the History of Contracts' (1979) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1599448 46(3) The University of Chicago Law Review 533]&lt;/ref&gt; First, specific types of non-commercial contract were given special protection where "freedom of contract" appeared far more on the side of large businesses. Consumer contracts came to be regarded as "contracts of adhesion" where there was no real negotiation and most people were given "take it or leave it" terms.&lt;ref&gt;F Kessler, 'Contracts of Adhesion—Some Thoughts About Freedom of Contract (1943) 43(5) Columbia Law Review 629&lt;/ref&gt; 

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, the courts began by requiring entirely clear information before onerous clauses could be enforced,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''[[Olley v Marlborough Court]]'' [1949] 1 KB 532&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Misrepresentation Act 1967]] switched the burden of proof onto business to show misleading statements were not negligent, and the [[Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977]] created the jurisdiction to scrap contract terms that were "unreasonable" considering the bargaining power of the parties. Collective bargaining and growing number of employment rights carried the employment contract into an autonomous field of [[UK labour law|labour law]] where workers had rights, like a minimum wage,&lt;ref&gt;[[Trade Boards Act 1909]] and the [[National Minimum Wage Act 1998]]&lt;/ref&gt; fairness in dismissal,&lt;ref&gt;[[Industrial Relations Act 1971]] and [[Employment Rights Act 1996]]&lt;/ref&gt; the right to join a union and take collective action,&lt;ref&gt;[[Trade Disputes Act 1906]] and the [[Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992]]&lt;/ref&gt; and these could not be given up in a contract with an employer. Private housing was subject to basic terms, such as the right to repairs, and restrictions on unfair rent increases, though many protection was abolished during the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Landlord and Tenant Act 1985]]&lt;/ref&gt; This reduced the scope of the general law of contract, and meant that most contracts individual people made in their ordinary lives were shielded from the power of corporations to impose whatever terms they chose in selling goods and services, at work, and in people's home.&lt;ref&gt;cf ''[[George Mitchell (Chesterhall) Ltd v Finney Lock Seeds Ltd]]'' [1983] QB 284&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, classical contract law remained at the foundation of specific contracts, unless particular rights were given by the courts or Parliament.

==Globalisation==
Internationally, the UK had joined the [[European Union]], which aimed to harmonise significant parts of consumer and employment law across member states. Moreover, with increasing openness of markets commercial contracts were receiving ideas from abroad. Both the [[Principles of European Contract Law]], the [[UNIDROIT]] [[Principles of International Commercial Contracts]], and the practice of international commercial arbitration was reshaping thinking about English contract principles with the rest of the globalising economy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4751">'''Jeffrey Peter Galmond''' is a [[Denmark|Danish]] Supreme Court [[lawyer]] and [[businessman]]. He is the owner of the law firm '''J. P. Galmond &amp; Co'''. He owned large portions of the [[holding company|holding companies]] that owned the Russian mobile [[telecommunications]] operator [[Megafon]]. One of these portions was contested. Galmond had been accused of not being the true owner of the Russian assets, but of acting as a front to Russian minister of telecommunications [[Leonid Reiman]]. These claims were vigorously denied by Galmond.

Galmond's disputed share in Megafon was held by Alfa Group, the company fronted by [[Russian oligarch]] Mikhail Fridman. Alfa Group was at the centre of many disputes involving disputed ownership of telecommunitions operations. These companies included Telenor, Teliasonera, Turkcell and others. IPOC even launched a RICO suit in the United States against Alfa Group and its associates.

In February 2007, Galmond was accused by the [[Bermuda]] Minister of Finance, [[Paula Cox]] of minor infringements of local business requirements.  She asked the supreme court to wind up [[IPOC International Growth Fund]], a company owned by Galmond, along with several other companies associated with Galmond. Galmond and IPOC worked to solve the issue. One step taken was for IPOC to fund a report by KPMG into its operations. KPMG’s report, which cost its client(s) US$13 million, found no evidence that JPG was not the beneficial owner of the MegaFon stake, or Alfa’s claim that money going into IPOC funds was the proceeds of money laundering.

Author Eamon Javers in his book "Broker, Trader, Lawyer, Spy", describes the infiltration by Alfa Group's agents into the KPMG investigation and the attempt to influence and manipulate the result of the investigation.

In April 2007 Finance Minister Paula Cox instructed the Registrar of Companies to file the petition to wind-up IPOC and eight related companies. The move was aimed at protecting Bermuda's reputation as a jurisdiction.   Bermuda also received around $22.5 million as its share of $45 million confiscated from IPOC in a criminal prosecution in the British Virgin Islands, where three IPOC-owned companies were domiciled.

Galmond has also worked as a lawyer for companies associated with the Icelandic conglomerate [[Baugur Group]].

In April 2012 the Prosecutor in the German city of Frankfurt withdrew charges against Galmond and four former employees of Commerzbank AG of money laundering. The investigations of the German prosecutor had lasted for 7 years [2].

Danish tabloid newspaper BT, on its front page of 24 December 2012, claimed that Galmond had committed tax evasion and fraud with the IPOC shares.

As a result of a libel case instigated by Galmond against the tabloid BT, on 15 January 2014, publicly withdrew the accusations. As a result of a plea-bargain, BT paid compensation to Galmond and the cost of the libel case.&lt;ref&gt;http://mediemarked.borsen.dk/medier/artikel/1/274769/bt_taber_sag_til_topadvokat.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Galmond today lives in Switzerland. He had sold all of the assets in IPOC International Growth Fund after its liquidation in 2008.

'''Mihail Melas''' ({{lang-el|Μιχαήλ Μελάς}}, 1833–1897) was a [[Greece|Greek]] politician and merchant, who served as [[Mayor of Athens]] in 1891–1894.

==Biography==
He was born in [[Syros]], the son of Georgios Melas, a member of the ''[[Filiki Eteria]]'' and the scion of a distinguished [[Epirote]] family.  He studied law in [[Paris]] and became involved with commerce at an early age, importing Russian wheat to [[London]] and [[Marseilles]]. From these activities he amassed a large fortune.

In 1874, Melas settled permanently in [[Athens]], where he soon achieved a distinguished place among Athenian high society. He played a crucial role in the foundation of the Athens Club in 1875, the Greek capital's oldest and most exclusive [[gentlemen's club]], and served as its president in 1882–1886 and 1888–1897. In 1890, he was elected to the [[Greek Parliament]] for [[Attica]]. He became mayor of Athens in 1891, holding the office until 1894, after an unsuccessful first attempt in 1883, when he lost to [[Dimitrios Soutsos]]. Melas also served in the founding board of the [[Hellenic Red Cross]], and as chairman of the ''[[Ethniki Etaireia]]'', a secret nationalist society, which played a major role in the outbreak of the disastrous [[Greco-Turkish War of 1897]]. Melas is also notable as one of the first Athenians to build a house in [[Kifissia]], then a suburban summer resort for the capital's wealthy families. He was also an avid art collector, and during his stay in Marseilles, he chaired the local French Cultural Club for several years. In 1886–88 he served as president of the ''[[Filekpaideftiki Etaireia]]'' ("Learned Society", a charitable educational society founded in 1836).

== Family ==
He was married with Eleni Voutsina and had seven children: Maria, wife of Ektoras Romanos, chamberlain of [[Prince Nicholas of Greece]]; [[Anna Mela-Papadopoulou|Anna]], wife of the landowner Apostolos Papadopoulos; Georgios (1866–1931) a judge and private secretary of King [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine I]]; [[Pavlos Melas|Pavlos]] (1870–1904), an [[Hellenic Army|Army]] officer and hero of the [[Macedonian Struggle]]; [[Leon M. Melas|Leon]] (1872–1905), a lawyer and politician; [[Konstantinos Melas]] (1874–1953), a [[Hellenic Navy|Navy]] officer and politician; and [[Vassileios M. Melas|Vassilios]] (1879–1956), a General and also president of the Athens Club.

'''Newtown Pery''' is an area of central [[Limerick]], [[Ireland]], and forms the main [[city centre]] (or [[Central Business District|CBD]]) of the city. The district is known for its [[Georgian architecture|Georgian architectural]] heritage and is the core area of Limerick's Georgian Quarter. It is one of the three towns that make up modern-day Limerick City Centre, the other two being the older ''[[King's Island, Limerick|Englishtown]] &amp; [[Irishtown, Limerick|Irishtown]]'' which date from the medieval period. Newtown Pery houses the largest collection of Georgian townhouses in Ireland outside of [[Georgian Dublin|Dublin]]. In 1837, [[Samuel Lewis (publisher)|Samuel Lewis]] in his ''Topographical Dictionary of Ireland'' described Newtown Pery as ‘one of the handsomest towns in Ireland’.&lt;ref name="libraryireland.com"&gt;http://www.libraryireland.com/topog/L/Limerick-City-Topography.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Limerick - O'Connell Street looking north east - geograph.org.uk - 331730.jpg|225px|thumb|Limerick - O'Connell Street looking north east. The majority of this section of Newtown Pery was rebuilt in the mid to late 20th Century]]
Prior to the development of Newtown Pery, the historical City of Limerick was situated just north of the present day city centre, stretching from [[King John's Castle (Limerick)|King John's Castle]] towards where [[St John's Cathedral (Limerick)|St. John's Cathedral]] is today. The city was made up of two distinct towns; [[King's Island, Limerick|Englishtown]] (populated by [[Old English (Ireland)|Old English]] settlers) located on the historical island city and [[Irishtown, Limerick|Irishtown]] (populated by natives) located on the southern bank of the Abbey River.&lt;ref name="limerickcity.ie"&gt;http://www.limerickcity.ie/media/limerick%20history%2005.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The two towns were connected by one bridge ''Baal's Bridge'' over the Abbey River, while ''Thomond Bridge'' beside [[King John's Castle (Limerick)|King John's Castle]] was a major crossing point of the [[River Shannon]] from ''Englishtown'' into modern-day [[County Clare]]. As with most cities of this time, Limerick was heavily fortified and walled and the streets were characteristically narrow, winding &amp; cramped.&lt;ref name="libraryireland.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="limerickcity.ie"/&gt; Prior to the construction of Newtown Pery, Limerick was also beginning to exhibit some early Georgian styles within the old city. Examples surviving today include; the ''Old Bishop's Palace'' at ''Castle Street'' &amp; at ''John's Square'' (Limerick's first example of fashionable architecture and civic spaces). Early photographs of the old city areas also show the old (pre-Georgian) continental &amp; [[Dutch gable]]d styled townhouses as being altered somewhat to appear more Georgian. Very few of these survive today.  Originally the land south of the medieval city that was to become Newtown Pery was owned by the [[Franciscans]] and known as ''South Priors Land''. Following the [[dissolution of the monasteries]] by [[Henry VIII]] this land was granted to Edmund Sexton of whom [[Edmund Sexton Pery]] was a descendant and on whom much of Georgian Limerick is credited.&lt;ref name="limerickcity.ie"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://limerickslife.com/rediscovering-limericke-3/&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the turbulent years of the 17th century, Limerick began to prosper in the 18th century and was completely transformed into the city it is today.&lt;ref name="georgianquarter.com"&gt;http://georgianquarter.com/264-2/&lt;/ref&gt; Easy access from most parts of Ireland facilitated by the [[River Shannon]] &amp; the opening of [[canals]] enabled Limerick to become the main port city on the western side of Ireland, which in turn brought much prosperity to the city and to its merchants and landowners with trade between Britain and America.&lt;ref name="georgianquarter.com"/&gt;

The boundaries of the city of Limerick, where the [[municipal corporation]] had authority, were smaller than the [[county of the city]] of Limerick, where the city [[grand jury]] had parallel authority.  The area within the county of the city but outside the city proper was termed the city liberties. The development of Newtown Pery can be attributed to the work of [[Edmund Sexton Pery, 1st Viscount Pery|Edmund Sexton Pery]] (created [[Viscount Pery]] in 1785) and his plan for the development of a [[new town]] on lands he owned in the south liberties of the city. In 1769, he commissioned the Irish engineer [[Christopher Colles]] to design a town plan on his estate which has since become known as ''Newtown Pery''. Colles devised an impressive plan for the Pery Estate which divided the estate into a [[grid plan]] of equal rectangular plots &amp; length and of a distinctive architectural unity which still defines the city centre to this day.&lt;ref name="limerickcity.ie"/&gt; The town was built in stages as Pery sold off leases to builders and developers who built 4 and 5 story townhouses in the Georgian fashion with long wide and elegant streets in [[grid plan]] design with [[O'Connell Street, Limerick|O'Connell Street]] (originally known as George's Street) as its centre, which was mostly in accordance with Colles' plan.&lt;ref name="garrymiley.com"&gt;http://www.garrymiley.com/2007/05/05/TheConservationOfGeorgianLimerick1.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest houses are located along Bank Place, Rutland Street, Patrick Street which were built by the Arthur family - a prominent Limerick family during the 18th century. Some of the finest examples of [[Georgian Architecture]] can be seen at the [[The Crescent (Limerick)|Crescent]] area and [[Pery Square]].&lt;ref name="limerickcity.ie"/&gt; The Custom's House ([[Hunt Museum]]), designed by Italian architect [[Davis Ducart]], is also one of the city's finest examples of Georgian Architecture.

By the turn of the 19th Century, Newtown Pery was rapidly growing as most fashionable area of the city. In 1807 its leading residents secured a [[private act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK parliament]] to establish a body of [[improvement commissioners]] as municipal authority for the [[Civil parishes in Ireland|civil parish]] of St Michael's, within which Newtown Pery was located.&lt;ref name="michaelsparishArchives"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.limerick.ie/historicalresources/limerickarchives/archivecollections/digitalarchives/limerickcitycouncilandlocalgovernmentcollections/commissionersfortheimprovementofst.michaelsparish1810-1851|title=Commissioners for the Improvement of St. Michael's Parish, 1810-1851|work=Archives|publisher=Limerick City and County Council|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commissioners were abolished in 1853 when the area was absorbed into Limerick city.&lt;ref name="michaelsparishArchives" /&gt; One brake on the town's development was that the only crossing point on the Shannon remained at Thomond Bridge in the old and now less fashionable Englishtown district.&lt;ref name="LovettWellesley"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lovett|first=Phil|title=The Wellesley Bridge|journal=The Old Limerick Journal|issue=9|pages=28–31|url=http://www.limerickcity.ie/media/Media,3987,en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1835, a new bridge was built over the Shannon connecting the west directly with Newtown Pery.&lt;ref name="LovettWellesley" /&gt; It was originally called Wellesley Bridge after [[Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley]], the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] when the act to pay for it was passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ó Maidín|first=Pádraig|title=The Building of the Sarsfield Bridge|journal=Old Limerick Journal|issue=6|pages=5–6|url=http://www.limerickcity.ie/media/Media,3941,en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It cemented Newtown Pery's position as Limerick's premier urban district as connections to the area improved.&lt;ref name="LovettWellesley" /&gt; The five-arch bridge was designed by [[Alexander Nimmo]] based on the [[Pont de Neuilly]] in [[Paris]]. In 1882 it was replaced with the current [[Sarsfield Bridge]].&lt;ref name="LovettWellesley" /&gt;

==Details==
[[File:Limerick4.JPG|thumb|Tait Memorial Clock Tower &amp; Dominican Church, Baker Place]]
From its development Newtown Pery has served as Limerick's [[Central Business District|CBD]]. It is also the city's main retail district which is centered on [[O'Connell Street, Limerick|O'Connell Street]], [[William Street, Limerick|William Street]] and the adjoining streets. In addition to the quality of the Georgian heritage in the district, another striking feature of the development is the [[grid plan]] layout of the streets in the area running north/south and east/west in similar fashion and design as found in [[New York City]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Glasgow]], [[Bristol]] &amp; [[Berlin]] albeit on a smaller scale.&lt;ref name="garrymiley.com"/&gt; This distinguishes Limerick's Georgian stock to the other major Irish Georgian development in Dublin, as Limerick's terraces are more uniform. This is due to the fact that the Pery owned all the land that was developed and it enabled a single development plan.

Limerick continued to expand following the [[Acts of Union 1800|Act of Union]] and into the early 19th Century, however, Pery's plan for the city was never fully realised. It was intended that the city would continue further southwards however a crippling economic decline in Ireland caused by the [[Great Irish Famine]] put an end to the development. The terrace at [[Pery Square]] was the last development of the great Georgian expansion of Limerick. The terrace itself was intended to be part of a Georgian square enclosing the People's Park, similar to [[Fitzwilliam Square]] or [[Mountjoy Square]] in [[Dublin]] however the plans were never realised as the development coincided with the beginning of the Famine. Another distinguishing feature of Georgian Limerick to Georgian Dublin is, Newtown Pery was a completely new ''greenfield'' development. Limerick's medieval city was left completely intact and remains to this day. Unfortunately, most of the built infrastructure of medieval Limerick did not survive past the mid 20th Century following the clearance of slum living in the city. Some examples survive and the street outlines remain in ''Nicholas Street'', ''Mary Street'', ''Broad Street'', ''John Street'' &amp; ''Mungret Street''. Much of Georgian Dublin in contrast however was undertaken by the [[Wide Streets Commission]] which almost completely rebuilt Dublin over the older medieval city.

==Decline==
[[File:George Street, Limerick (5691906290).jpg|thumb|O'Connell Street in the early 20th century featuring the imposing facade of Cannock's Department Store &amp; its landmark clocktower. It was rebuilt in the early 1960s, losing its Georgian character]]
Although housing an important collection of Georgian architecture and acting as Limerick's city centre, unfortunately Newtown Pery's position as the one time fashionable area of the city is long over. In addition to this, its Georgian heritage has been severely compromised, in particular around the retail core of ''[[O'Connell Street, Limerick|O'Connell Street]]'' &amp; ''[[William Street, Limerick|William street]]''. Economic decline &amp; stagnation plagued Limerick during the 20th Century which saw some townhouses converted to tenements such as at ''Arthur's Quay &amp; Bank Place''. During this time very little investment was seen in Newtown Pery, only the exodus of families &amp; industries to new suburban districts around the city due to modern requirements. By the mid 20th century dereliction had taken its toll as the townhouses at ''Arthur's Quay'', ''Francis Street'' &amp; ''Bank Place'' were completely lost. Lax development controls enabled the almost complete rebuilding of the northern end of O'Connell Street and replacing what were some iconic and illustrious buildings with more [[modernist]] (&amp; perhaps less attractive) sixties style architecture. The loss of ''Todd's Department Store'' to a fire which gutted the building, the rebuilding of ''Cannock's Department Store, Royal George Hotel, AIB Bank'' amongst many more, completely altered the look of city and ultimately resulted in a loss of the districts heritage and character. Nevertheless, much of the districts Georgian townhouses remained intact, however many were converted to offices or flats while others remained unoccupied or neglected. However, despite the architectural losses &amp; economic conditions; Newtown Pery remained the premier retail &amp; services district for Limerick and the greater [[Mid-West Region, Ireland|Mid-West Region]] well up into the late 20th and early 21st Century.

Economic stagnation in Limerick, was only broken by the [[Celtic Tiger]] in the late 20th Century. Unfortunately, Newtown Pery, still lagged behind with regards to investment &amp; planning with exception to the riverfront of the [[River Shannon|Shannon]]. Suburban areas of Limerick have seen massive investments particularly in retail, which has seen the one time retail core of ''[[O'Connell Street, Limerick|O' Connell Street]] &amp; [[William Street, Limerick|William street]]'' been eclipsed by massive retail developments in the suburbs. Poor planning &amp; lack of investment has resulted in high vacancy rates &amp; further dereliction which plagues some parts. Amongst the casualties of this poor planning has been the ''[[Patrick Street, Limerick|Patrick Street]], [[Rutland Street, Limerick|Rutland Street]] &amp; Ellen Street'' areas which were all part of the ill fated [[Opera Centre]] development. These streets are now almost completely derelict &amp; vacant. [[Urban decay|Urban depression]] in Limerick unfortunately is not confined to these areas alone as much of central Limerick is now exhibiting the effects, mainly of heavy suburbanisation but also the effects of economic recession. The area is now a shadow of its former self as more and more businesses &amp; retail facilities leave the city centre for the convenience of the new shopping centres.

==Future==
In order to arrest the decline of Limerick's CBD and Newtown Pery in general, both [[Limerick City Council]] and national government have introduced schemes to counteract the heavy suburbanisation of the city. Amongst the most eloborate plans is the €250 million ''Limerick 2030'' plan which will see a complete redevelopment of the ''Arthur's Quay'' area into a new and modern retailing complex.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;http://www.limerickcity.ie/Planning/EconomicDevelopment/Limerick2030AnEconomicandSpatialPlanforLimerick/&lt;/ref&gt; It will also see the development of a higher education campus to include facilities from [[Limerick Institute of Technology|LIT]], [[University of Limerick|UL]], and [[Mary Immaculate College|MIC]] and a refurbishment of the city's main streets.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Another plan is the ''Living City Initiative'' which provides tax relief for residents who refurbish Georgian houses in designated areas. It also provides tax relief to retailers who carry out works to upgrade or re-fit their shops in the designated Georgian area.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.limerick.ie/business/whatsnew/2013-02-18limerickcityandcountycouncilswelcomelivingcityinitiative.html&lt;/ref&gt; Newtown Pery is a testament to Limerick's rich &amp; eventful past and remains one of the most important remnants of Ireland's [[Georgian Era]]. It remains to be seen if the above schemes can stop the decline of the city's historic &amp; elegant stock of buildings.

==Early and personal life==
Casey was born in [[Derry]] on 9 October 1957. He is the third of nine children (five boys and four girls). His mother Patsy Casey was deputy headmistress at Nazareth House Primary School and his father Leo was the bursar at the local grammar school, [[St Columb's College]]. Casey attended both schools before studying business administration, politics and economics at [[Aston University]] in [[Birmingham]]. He lived in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], with his second wife, Helen and their five children. In 2016 Casey sold his mansion in Georgia and now lives in a house in [[Greencastle, County Donegal]].&lt;ref name="Independent2018-10-15"&gt;{{cite news |title=Presidential candidate Peter Casey downsizes from €1.7m mansion to Donegal house with sea view |url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/presidential-election-2018/presidential-candidate-peter-casey-downsizes-from-1-7m-mansion-to-donegal-house-with-sea-view-37419360.html |accessdate=22 October 2018 |work=independent.ie |date=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business career==
Casey joined Rank Xerox UK as a sales representative in 1979, and went on to win a national award for sales in his first year. He moved to [[Sydney]], Australia in 1981, and was ranked in the top 5% of sales executives nationally. He became the youngest district manager in [[Rank Xerox]] and won Three Oceans Cup as top Sales Manager in [[Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishabroad.com/IrishWorld/IrishAmericaMag/decjan07-old/features/Business100ProfilesandBostonHonorees.asp|title=Profiles|work=Irish Abroad}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, Casey joined Océ Reprographics as state manager for [[New South Wales]]. He then rejoined Rank Xerox in 1984 as a branch manager in Sydney, before making the decision to set up his first company, The Trinity Group, in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=7715175&amp;privcapId=7715151|title=Executive Profile|work=Bloomberg Businessweek}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Trinity Group, a search and IT contracting firm based in Sydney, was one of five firms awarded the NSW Government tender to supply temporary staff to the New South Wales Government, the largest contract ever awarded in staffing at the time. Casey sold this business in 1992, and moved back to Ireland for six months before setting out for Atlanta, Georgia where he founded Network Resources which later became Claddagh Resources in 1996. Claddagh Resources place high-level executives across the globe for many Fortune 500 companies including Coca-Cola, SAP, Tata Consultancy Services, Oracle, IBM, and Ernst &amp; Young. In 2000, the company established its European headquarters in [[Donegal]] which has recently expanded operations to a new [[Dublin]] office. ''Irish America Magazine'' named him as one of 2007's leading [[Irish Americans|Irish American]] businessmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/tv/dragonsden/profile_petercasey.html|title=Profile:Peter Casey|publisher=[[RTÉ Television]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television==
Ireland's version of the business-related TV programme ''[[Dragons' Den]]'' selected Casey to appear as an investor for the show's fifth and sixth series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.allaboutbusiness.ie/denlive/dragons/Peter_Casey |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308061837/http://www.allaboutbusiness.ie/denlive/dragons/Peter_Casey |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-03-08 |title=ALL ABOUT PETER |work=[[Bank of Ireland]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=irishexaminer_14042013&gt;{{cite news|first=Hillary|last=Fennel|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/features/interviews/this-much-i-know-peter-casey-227974.html|title=This much I know: Peter Casey|work=[[Irish Examiner]]|date=14 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of the series he made several investments.

==Politics==
In January 2015, Casey said he would consider running as a candidate at the [[Irish general election, 2016|next Irish general election]], though he expressed uncertainty about which constituency he might choose. When pressed to name a constituency he thought he might select [[Donegal (Dáil constituency)|Donegal]], where he had recently purchased a home, or somewhere in Dublin, where he intended to set up his latest business. "Realistically I'm going to be spending a lot of time in Dublin", Casey said at the time.&lt;ref name=irishcentral_13012015&gt;{{cite news|first=Jane|last=Walsh|url=http://www.irishcentral.com/news/politics/US-based-Irish-businessman-to-run-for-office-as-Independent-candidate.html|title=US-based Irish businessman to run for office as Independent candidate|date=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Casey gave his opinion on the [[Fine Gael]]−[[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour]] coalition to ''[[The Irish Times]]''. "In fairness to the current Government I think they have performed fairly well", he said. "Some things they have done badly but overall I'd probably give them a B [grade]."&lt;ref name=irishcentral_13012015/&gt; He attempted to be elected to [[Seanad Éireann]] as part of the [[Industrial and Commercial Panel]] in 2016. At his Seanad campaign launch he said he intended to support foreign direct investment, indigenous business development and job creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/so-who-is-presidential-hopeful-peter-casey-1.3612426|title=So who is presidential hopeful Peter Casey?|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2018-08-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the count, Casey received 14 votes; 113 were required to secure a seat.

===2018 presidential campaign===
{{main|Irish presidential election, 2018}}
On 30 August 2018, Casey announced his intention to seek a nomination for that year's [[Irish presidential election, 2018|Irish presidential election]]. He became the third 'dragon' from the Irish version of ''[[Dragons' Den (Irish TV series)|Dragons' Den]]'' to seek a nomination after [[Gavin Duffy]] and [[Seán Gallagher]].&lt;ref name=RTE2018-08-30a&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/politics/2018/0830/988454-presidential-election/|title=Businessman Peter Casey seeks presidential nomination|date=30 August 2018|work=RTÉ News|access-date=30 August 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Casey uploaded a promotional video entitled "Platform for President of Ireland" to YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGzEvuTowSc&amp;feature=youtu.be|title=Peter Casey for President of Ireland 2018|first=|last=Peter Casey|date=30 August 2018|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; He secured the nominations of four local authorities; [[Kerry County Council]], [[Clare County Council]], [[Limerick City and County Council]] and [[Tipperary County Council]].&lt;ref name="RTE2018-09-19"&gt;{{cite news |title=Peter Casey secures nomination to contest presidency |url=https://www.rte.ie/news/politics/2018/0918/994505-presidential-election/ |access-date=17 October 2018 |work=RTÉ News |date=19 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He criticised incumbent President [[Michael D. Higgins]] for "extolling the virtues" of [[Fidel Castro]] and [[Hugo Chávez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/politics/higgins-kept-seat-warm-while-being-paid-vast-amounts-of-money-millionaire-presidential-hopeful-slams-bonkers-pay-37265835.html|title='Higgins kept seat warm while being paid vast amounts of money'|work=Irish Independent|access-date=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 October, Casey attracted a mixture of criticism and praise when he made comments on the ''[[Irish Independent]]'''s ''Floating Voter'' podcast regarding social housing that was offered to, and refused by, [[Irish Travellers]] in [[Thurles]], [[County Tipperary]]. Casey described Irish Travellers as "basically people camping in someone else’s land" who are "not paying their fair share of taxes in society". There were calls for Casey to withdraw from the race, including from Traveller activist group [[Pavee Point]]. Other candidates condemned Casey's comments.&lt;ref name="Journal2018-10-17"&gt;{{cite news |title='Appalling' and 'abhorrent': All five presidential rivals round on Casey over Traveller comments |url=http://www.thejournal.ie/peter-casey-travellers-4290715-Oct2018/ |access-date=17 October 2018 |work=TheJournal.ie |date=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/presidential-election-2018/protests-planned-as-presidential-hopeful-peter-casey-to-visit-traveller-homes-site-37433080.html |title =Protests planned as presidential hopeful Peter Casey to visit Traveller homes site|date=18 October 2018|work=Irish Independent|access-date=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Dáil Éireann|Dáil]], [[Tánaiste]] [[Simon Coveney]] referred to Casey's comments as the "lowest common denominator politics" and defended the Government's decision to recognise Irish Travellers as an [[ethnic group|ethnic minority]] in 2017, in contrast to Casey’s belief that Irish Travellers share their ethnicity with the general Irish population. &lt;ref name="Independent2018-10-18"&gt;{{cite news |title='Lowest common denominator politics' - Simon Coveney criticises Peter Casey's comments on Travelling Community |url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/presidential-election-2018/lowest-common-denominator-politics-simon-coveney-criticises-peter-caseys-comments-on-travelling-community-37434289.html |access-date=18 October 2018 |work=Irish Independent|date=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Casey visited the Thurles housing development for himself on 18 October, under [[Garda Síochána|Garda]] protection, and faced demonstrations by Traveller activist groups.&lt;ref name="RTE2018-10-18"&gt;{{cite news |title=Protests as Casey visits housing estate for Travellers after controversial remarks |url=https://www.rte.ie/news/presidential-election/2018/1018/1005086-presidential-election/ |access-date=18 October 2018 |work=RTÉ News |date=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 October, Casey released a statement announcing he was "taking the weekend off from the campaign to think carefully about whether to continue in the race", adding that "I do not want the people of Ireland to elect me as President of Ireland just based on one statement I made".&lt;ref name="Independent2018-10-19"&gt;{{cite news |title=Peter Casey suspends campaign for presidency following controversial Traveller comments |url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/presidential-election-2018/peter-casey-suspends-campaign-for-presidency-following-controversial-traveller-comments-37437133.html |access-date=19 October 2018 |work=Irish Independent|date=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He announced that he was staying in the presidential election.&lt;ref name=RTE_20181021&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/2018/1021/1005647-peter-casey-presidential-election/|title=Peter Casey to remain in the race for Áras an Uachtaráin|work=RTÉ News|date=21 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said that in his opinion that Ireland is a "welfare-dependent state" which has led to a "sense of entitlement that's become unaffordable".&lt;ref name=RTE_20181021/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/live-blog-presidential-debate-4301713-Oct2018/ |title =As it happened: Presidential Debate 23 October 2018|date=23 October 2018|work=Journal|accessdate=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fianna Fáil TD [[Niall Collins]] later stated on ''[[The Week in Politics]]'' that the Fianna Fáil ticket for the constituency was full, saying that Casey should "realise that you can’t just rock up to political parties and think that you can get your way".&lt;ref name="Journal2018-10-28"&gt;{{cite news |title='We're okay thanks': Fianna Fáil TDs pour cold water on Casey's plan to join party |url=https://www.thejournal.ie/peter-casey-fianna-fail-4310452-Oct2018/ |accessdate=28 October 2018 |work=TheJournal.ie |date=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Casey responded by saying "I'm 100% serious.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1915">The '''San Leandro Tech Campus''' is a [[business park]] being constructed in downtown [[San Leandro, California]], near the [[San Leandro (BART station)|San Leandro BART station]]. Construction of Phase 1 of the project began in 2014, and was completed in 2016. The primary tenant of the first phase of construction is [[OSIsoft]], a software company based in San Leandro.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/johnson/article/Boom-times-come-to-downtown-San-Leandro-6840782.php]&lt;/ref&gt; Phase 2 of the project is expected to be completed in 2019 with [[Ghirardelli Chocolate Company]] as the lead tenant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bisnow.com/san-francisco/news/office/ghirardelli-chocolate-signs-lease-at-san-leandro-tech-campus-90882|title=Ghirardelli Chocolate Signs Lease At San Leandro Tech Campus|last=|first=|date=July 23, 2018|website=Bisnow|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site is the permanent location for the sculpture, ''[[Truth is Beauty]]'', by [[Marco Cochrane]]. The sculpture generated some controversy, as it is a large 55' nude outdoor sculpture, albeit on private property.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sanleandro.org/depts/cd/projects/downtown_technology_campus.asp]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/San-Leandro-Truth-is-Beauty-sculpture-nude-9145455.php]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://abc7news.com/technology/naked-sculpture-in-san-leandro-stirs-mixed-emotions/868145/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://kron4.com/2016/10/01/truth-is-beauty-sculpture-revealed-in-san-leandro/]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The 4-Hour Workweek: Escape 9-5, Live Anywhere, and Join the New Rich''''' (2007) is a [[self-help]] book by [[Timothy Ferriss]], an American writer, educational activist, and [[entrepreneur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ferriss |first=Timothy |title=The 4-Hour Workweek: Escape 9-5, Live Anywhere, and Join the New Rich |publisher=Crown Publishing Group |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-307-35313-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   The book has spent more than four years on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller List]], has been translated into 35 languages and has sold more than 1,350,000 copies worldwide.&lt;ref name="publishersmarketplace"&gt;[http://www.publishersmarketplace.com/members/swhanselma/ Best-Known Projects]. ''Publishers Marketplace''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newyorktimesbestsellerlist"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/01/books/bestseller/hardcover-business-best-sellers.html Hardcover Business Best Sellers].

''FourHourWorkWeek.com/Blog''.&lt;/ref&gt; It deals with what Ferriss refers to as "lifestyle design" and repudiates the traditional "deferred" life plan in which people work grueling hours and take few vacations for decades and save money in order to relax after [[retirement]].

==Background==
Ferriss developed the ideas present in ''The 4-Hour Workweek'' (4HWW) while working 14-hour days at his [[sports nutrition]] supplement company, BrainQUICKEN.&lt;ref name=abcnews&gt;Maney, Kevin; Chapula, Andrea. [http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=3753402&amp;page=1#.UCUrG0SIqOU Tim Ferriss Wants You to Get A Life]. ''ABC News''. October 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Frustrated by the overwork and lack of free time, Ferriss took a 3-week sabbatical to [[Europe]]. During that time and continued travels throughout Europe, Asia, and South America, Ferriss developed a streamlined system of checking [[email]] once per day and [[outsourcing]] small daily tasks to [[Virtual assistant (occupation)|virtual assistant]]s.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes&gt;Rosenbloom, Stephanie. [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/27/fashion/27Ferris.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=1 The World According to Tim Ferriss]. ''The New York Times''. March 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; His personal escape from a [[workaholic]] lifestyle was the genesis of the book.&lt;ref name=fastcompany&gt;Ohannessian, Kevin. [http://www.fastcompany.com/1718921/leadership-hall-fame-tim-ferriss-author-4-hour-workweek Leadership Hall of Fame: Tim Ferriss, Author of "The 4-Hour Workweek"]. ''Fast Company''. January 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The format of ''The 4-Hour Workweek'' took shape during a series of lectures Ferriss delivered on high-tech entrepreneurship at [[Princeton University]], his [[alma mater]].&lt;ref name=thedailyprincetonian&gt;Hall, Cornelia. [http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/2007/05/09/18434/ Ferriss '00 takes the day off]. ''The Daily Princetonian''. May 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The lectures (and book) described Ferriss' own experiences in company automation and lifestyle development.&lt;ref name=thedailyprincetonian/&gt;

The book explains the Improvement Kata and Coaching Kata, which are a means for making the [[Continual improvement process]] as observed at the [[Toyota Production System]] teachable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cis.tennessee.edu/consulting/Pages/KATA.aspx|title=Centre for Industrial services|publisher=University of Tennessee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
''Toyota Kata'' defines ''management'' as, “the systematic pursuit of desired conditions by utilizing human capabilities in a concerted way.”&lt;ref name="Rother2009.1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mike Rother|title=Toyota Kata: Managing People for Improvement, Adaptiveness and Superior Results|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rFDq1DYprzYC|date=4 September 2009|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|page=15|isbn=978-0-07-163985-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rother proposes that it is not solutions themselves that provide sustained competitive advantage and long-term survival, but the degree to which an organization has mastered an effective routine for developing fitting solutions again and again, along unpredictable paths. This requires teaching the skills behind the solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asq.org/training/toyota-kata-improving-and-coaching-your-way-to-success_TKWS.html|title=Toyota Kata course|publisher=ASQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this management approach a primary job of leaders and managers is to develop people so that desired results can be achieved. They do this by having the organization members (leaders and managers included) deliberately practice a routine, or [[kata]], that develops and channels their creative abilities. ''Kata'' are patterns that are practiced so they become second nature, and were originally movement sequences in martial arts.&lt;ref name="Rother2009.1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theleanthinker.com/2010/06/28/toyota-kata-the-how-of-engaged-leadership/|title=Toyota Kata Engaged leadership|publisher=The Lean Thinker Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Improvement Kata==
The improvement kata is a routine for moving from the current situation to a new situation in a creative, directed, meaningful way. It is based on a four-part model:
# In consideration of a vision or direction...
# Grasp the current condition.
# Define the next target condition.
# Move toward that target condition iteratively, which uncovers obstacles that need to be worked on.

In contrast to approaches that attempt to predict the path and focus on implementation, the improvement kata builds on discovery that occurs along the way. Teams using the improvement kata learn as they strive to reach a target condition, and adapt based on what they are learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.systems2win.com/LK/lean/kata.htm|title=Kata Habits|publisher=Systems2win}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Toyota Kata'' submits that the improvement-kata pattern of thinking and behavior is universal; applicable not only in business but in education, politics, daily living, etc.. The book's underlying message is that when people practice and learn a kata for how to proceed through unclear territory, they don't need to fear the obstacles, changes and unknowns they encounter. Rather than trying to hold on to a sense of certainty based on one's perspective, people can derive confidence from a kata for working through uncertainty.&lt;ref name="Rother2009.2"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mike Rother|title=Toyota Kata: Managing People for Improvement, Adaptiveness and Superior Results|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rFDq1DYprzYC|date=4 September 2009|page=18|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|isbn=978-0-07-163985-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Coaching Kata==
The coaching kata is a routine used to teach the improvement kata and requires prior experience with practicing the improvement kata.&lt;ref name="Rother2009.3"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mike Rother|title=Toyota Kata: Managing People for Improvement, Adaptiveness and Superior Results|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rFDq1DYprzYC|date=4 September 2009|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|page=171|isbn=978-0-07-163985-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vicente Soriano Serra''' (born 1953 in [[Puçol]], [[Valencian Community]], [[Spain]]) is a Valencian businessman who became the president and majority shareholder of [[Valencia CF]] in 2008, after reaching an agreement with [[Juan Bautista Soler]] to take over the presidency of the club and purchase Soler's shares to the value of 70.7 million euros. After an ill-fated attempt to resolve the club's debts, he was finally succeeded by [[Manuel Llorente]].

==Biography==
Having started out in the orange export business, in the 1990s he got involved in construction as a real estate broker, and subsequently as a property developer and representative of large investor groups.

He entered the world of soccer in 2004 when forming part of [[Francisco Roig Alfonso|Paco Roig]]'s "Cor i Força", the team that was running against then ousted president [[Jaume Ortí]]. [[Juan Bautista Soler]] won the election and Soriano accepted the role offered of vice-president.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noticias.info/Archivo/2004/200410/20041006/20041006_35232.shtm Juan Bautista Soler, nuevo presidente del Valencia CF] (Juan Bautista Soler, new president of Valencia CF {{es icon}}), Valencia CF official website, October 6, 2004, (reposted on noticias.info, accessdate June 08, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Soriano was charged with the selection of plans for the new stadium (see [[Nou Mestalla]]). Finally Soler rejected said projects. As a result, his relations with the then-president deteriorated. He was relieved of the vice-presidency in January 2006, although never he sold his allocation of shares. He resigned from the board in June 2007. He threatened to return to the club accompanied by [[Juan Villalonga]] to get a hold of Soler's stock, a situation that did not bear fruit. Villalonga briefly took over the running of the club in 2008, but when he proposed to buy the 37% held by Soler, Soriano reconciled with the majority shareholder and reached an agreement for the buying and selling of the Soler family shares in an amount set at 70.7 million euros, which was overturned after Soriano failed to sell the old Mestalla ground by the end of the year, finally resigning on 4 June 2009 because he had still failed to sell it. An attempt to raise capital by improving income from television rights also failed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2008/12/31/valencia/1230710021.html Las 'teles', el otro plan de Soriano] (Tellies, Soriano's other plan {{es icon}}), El Mundo, December 31, 2008 (accessdate June 08, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, following an absence of just one month, during which time [[Manuel Llorente]] took over, Soriano returned in July, having gained 51% of the shares and linked up with a mysterious company called [[Inversiones Dalport]], an investment company supposedly from [[Uruguay]] but with an office in [[Madrid]]. Soriano announced that none of the star players such as [[David Villa]], [[Juan Manuel Mata]] or [[David Silva]] would now need to be sold, as all the debts would be wiped clean.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetimes.co.za/Sport/Article.aspx?id=1030046 Valencia refuse to sell players], The Times, June 07, 2009 (accessdate June 08, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, failure to find any information on Dalport on the Internet prior to the announcement prompted an outcry at the press conference. The media's suspicions were further heightened when fans noticed that the [[logo]] of an [[eagle]] used by Dalport had in fact been copied from a children's colouring-in book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lavanguardia.es/deportes/noticias/20090706/53739362453/el-misterio-de-inversiones-dalport.html El misterio de Inversiones Dalport] (The mystery of Inversiones Dalport {{es icon}}), La Vanguardia, July 06, 2009 (accessdate July 09, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Prematurely ousted president Llorente echoed the fans' suspicions &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marca.com/2009/07/08/futbol/equipos/valencia/1247054723.html Llorente: "Si Soriano trae garantías bancarias, le hacemos 'pasillo'"] (If Soriano brings bank statements [ as proof ], we will hold our arms up into a tunnel for him to pass underneath {{es icon}}), Marca, July 08, 2009 (accessdate July 08, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Like 70% of fans, Llorente does not believe that Soriano will deliver, and warned that Valencia is opening themselves up to a potential investment scam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://valenciacf.lasprovincias.es/noticias/2009-07-08/internautas-cree-soriano-20090708.html El 70% de los internautas no cree a Soriano] (70% of web users does not believe in Soriano {{es icon}}), Las Provincias, July 8, 2009 (accessdate July 8, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

When, as predicted, Dalport failed to deliver, on August 21, 2009 [[Fundació VCF]] took over, becoming the main shareholder with 72.5% of shares, using a loan from [[Bancaixa]] and guaranteed by the local government. The Fundació is not allowed to end up with less than 51%, thereby ensuring stability within Valencia CF and cementing [[Manuel Llorente]] as the bona fide president.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.superdeporte.es/valencia/2009/08/24/fundacio-nueva-duena-vcf/69979.html La Fundació es la nueva dueña del VCF] (The Fundació are the new owners of VCF {{es icon}}), Superdeporte, August 22, 2009 (accessdate August 26, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Soler hired a [[hitman]] from Eastern Europe to [[kidnap]] Soriano. However, the hitman turned out to be working for the police, so Soler was arrested. While he is waiting to find out whether he will go to prison, he is not allowed to leave the country or go within 15 metres of Vicente Soriano.&lt;ref&gt;[http://prosoccertalk.nbcsports.com/2014/04/09/former-valencia-president-arrested-for-plotting-to-kidnap-successor/ Former Valencia president arrested for plotting to kidnap successor], NBC Sports, April 9, 2014 (accessdate April 10, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; This will not be easy, as his home is 20 metres from the door of Soriano's office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://futbol.as.com/futbol/2014/04/09/primera/1397041817_098671.html Juan Soler, imputado por tentativa de secuestro] (Juan Soler, charged with attempting kidnapping {{es icon}}), AS, April 9, 2014 (accessdate April 10, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Vigor Brown''' (18 June 1854 – 2 September 1942), known as '''Vigor Brown''',&lt;ref name=NCC&gt;{{cite web|title=History |url=http://www.napier.govt.nz/index.php?pid=841 |publisher=Napier City Council |accessdate=1 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a New Zealand [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Napier (New Zealand electorate)|Napier]], in the [[North Island]]. He was [[Mayor of Napier, New Zealand|Mayor of Napier]] for a total of 18 years. He was a well-known figure in his adopted city, a successful businessman, and involved in many clubs and organisations.

==Early life==
Brown was born in [[London]] in 1854. For his parents, Jessie Gilmour and John Brown, it was their third boy and last child.&lt;ref name="Marriage"&gt;{{cite news|title=Marriage |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=HBH18801203.2.8 |accessdate=10 December 2010 |newspaper=Hawke's Bay Herald |volume=XXI |issue=5845 |date=3 December 1880 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both parents had Scottish ancestry. His father worked for a bank, and was later a commercial traveller. The family briefly lived in France before emigrating to [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]]. John Vigor Brown, his brothers and their mother arrived in [[Melbourne]] on 22 January 1862 on the ''Water Nymph''. It is assumed that his father was already there. They made their home in [[South Yarra, Victoria|South Yarra]]. He was educated at [[Melbourne Grammar School|Melbourne Church of England Grammar School]].&lt;ref name="DNZB Brown"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/3b53/1 | title= Brown, John Vigor - Biography | last= Axford | first= C.

==Professional career==
Brown learned the trade of a wholesale merchant (clothing) at the firm Sargood, King and Sargood in Melbourne. He came to [[Wellington]] in 1875.{{sfn|Hamer|1988|p=361}} For two years, he worked for the Wellington firm of A. P. Stewart and Company as a travelling sales person.&lt;ref name="obituary"&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituary|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=EP19420903.2.20 |accessdate=10 December 2010 |newspaper=[[The Evening Post (New Zealand)|The Evening Post]] |volume=CXXXIV |issue=56 |date=3 September 1942 |page=II}}&lt;/ref&gt; His next employment brought him to Napier, where he remained for the rest of his life. He became branch manager for [[Archibald Clark (politician)|Archibald Clark and Sons]], an importing company.&lt;ref name="DNZB Brown" /&gt; He resigned from that position in May 1898&lt;ref name="NZETC Brown"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cyclopedia of New Zealand [Taranaki, Hawke’s Bay &amp; Wellington Provincial Districts |year=1908 |publisher=Cyclopedia Company Limited |url=http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-Cyc06Cycl-t1-body1-d2-d8-d2.html|author=Cyclopedia Company Limited |accessdate=10 December 2010 |page=316|chapter=Mr. J.

The [[Napier (New Zealand electorate)|Napier]] electorate had been held since the [[New Zealand general election, 1899|1899 election]] by [[Alfred Fraser]]. Fraser stood again in the [[New Zealand general election, 1908|1908 election]], but although he was with the [[New Zealand Liberal Party|Liberal Party]], Brown also contested the electorate as a Liberal.&lt;ref name="1908 nomination"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hawkes Bay|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=EP19081102.2.6.2 |accessdate=10 December 2010 |newspaper=[[The Evening Post (New Zealand)|The Evening Post]] |volume=LXXVI |issue=107 |date=2 November 1908 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown won the contest with a majority of 1035 votes (3803 votes to 2768).&lt;ref name="1908 final result"&gt;{{cite news|title=Napier Seat |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=EP19081123.2.65 |accessdate=10 December 2010 |newspaper=[[The Evening Post (New Zealand)|The Evening Post]] |volume=LXXVI |issue=123 |date=23 November 1908 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1911 results" /&gt;

In the [[New Zealand general election, 1911|1911 election]], Brown was challenged by [[Henry Hill (educationalist)|Henry Hill]]. Both men were supporters of the current Liberal government. Brown and Hill received 3858 and 2825 votes, respectively.&lt;ref name="1911 results"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hawke's Bay Province |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=OSWCC19111212.2.58.13 |accessdate=11 December 2010 |newspaper=Otautau Standard and Wallace County Chronicle |volume=VII |issue=344 |date=12 December 1911 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Election Campaign |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=EP19111121.2.22 |accessdate=11 December 2010 |newspaper=[[The Evening Post (New Zealand)|The Evening Post]] |volume=LXXXII |issue=123 |date=21 November 1911 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown successfully contested the {{NZ election link|1919}} for the Liberal Party,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Napier Seat|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=WDT19191122.2.31.3|accessdate=18 December 2014|work=[[Wairarapa Daily Times]]|volume=45|issue=13985|date=22 November 1919|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the party's leader, [[Joseph Ward]], failed to win re-election in the {{NZ electorate link|Awarua}} electorate. When [[Thomas Wilford]] became leader later in 1920, Brown objected&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Leader of the Liberals|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=NZH19201008.2.92|accessdate=18 December 2014|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|volume=LVII|issue=17596|date=8 October 1920|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and transferred his allegiance to the [[New Zealand Reform Party|Reform Party]].&lt;ref name="1922 Reform"&gt;{{cite news|title=General Elections|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=NZH19221017.2.32|accessdate=18 December 2014|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|volume=LIX|issue=18223|date=17 October 1922|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prime Minister [[William Massey]] had given Brown the official party endorsement, despite the local Reform committee having already chosen [[John Mason (New Zealand politician)|John Mason]] as their candidate. Neither was victorious and the seat was won by [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour's]] [[Lewis McIlvride]].{{sfn|Campbell|1975|p=110}}

In {{NZ election link year|1925}}, Brown failed to receive Reform nomination with new party organizer [[Albert Davy]] ensuring it went to Mason.&lt;ref name="Gardner"&gt;{{cite journal | last= Gardner | first= W.J. | date= September 1961 | title= W.F. Massey in Power | journal= Political Science | volume= 13 | issue= 2 | page= 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later stood unsuccessfully as an independent in {{NZ election link year|1931}}.

==Family==
Brown married Caroline Balaclava Cook, daughter of the late John Cook of [[Auckland]], on 27 November 1880 at St John's Church in Napier.&lt;ref name=Marriage /&gt; They had four daughters and two sons before Caroline died from [[peritonitis]] on 6 September 1891 at the young age of 36. He remarried on 19 September 1894 to Violet McConechie Bogle. There were no further children from this second marriage.&lt;ref name="DNZB Brown" /&gt;

In 1910, Brown had a 31' launch built for the family, named ''Water Nymph'' after the ship used for his emigration to Victoria during his childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parade of Classic &amp; Wooden Boats  Lake Rotoiti  North Island, New Zealand|url=http://www.woodenboatparade.co.nz/pre1920.htm |publisher=Lake Rotoiti Classic and Wooden Boat Association|accessdate=10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His second wife predeceased him on 23 February 1924. Brown died on 2 September 1942 in Napier, where he had lived since 1877. After his death, his family took on the surname Vigor-Brown.&lt;ref name="DNZB Brown" /&gt;

==Domestic career==
Owing to his early career as an agricultural cadet, which involved considerable travel around the country, Whineray played for six first-class teams, including [[Wairarapa Bush Rugby Football Union|Wairarapa]], [[Mid Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Mid Canterbury]], [[Manawatu Rugby Union|Manawatu]], [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]], [[Waikato Rugby Union|Waikato]], and finally his hometown team, [[Auckland Rugby Football Union|Auckland]], for whom he made 61 appearances between 1959 and 1966. He also played for the [[North vs South rugby union match|South Island]], [[North vs South rugby union match|North Island]], and New Zealand Universities sides.

==International career==
He first played for the All Blacks in 1957. The following year he became captain for the 1958 series against Australia at the young age of 23. He went on to play 77 matches for the All Blacks between 1957 and 1965, 67 of them as captain. These included 32 [[Test match (rugby union)|test match]]es, all but two of them as captain.&lt;ref name=halloffame/&gt; He played mostly in the position of [[Prop (rugby union)|prop]].&lt;ref name=allblacks_profile/&gt; Whineray was named New Zealand Sportsperson of the Year in 1965.&lt;ref name="UoA_Alumni_Profile"/&gt;

==Later life==
After retiring from rugby, he gained a [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] from [[Harvard University]], where he was a member of the [[Harvard Business School RFC]]. He returned to New Zealand in 1969 and started work at Alex Harvey Industries, which became [[Carter Holt Harvey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Over achiever on and off the paddock |first1=Colin |last1=Meads |first2=Andrew |last2=Stone |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/rugby/news/article.cfm?c_id=80&amp;objectid=10677508 |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |date=2 October 2010 |accessdate=21 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He rose to become deputy managing director, then chairman of the board of Carter Holt Harvey, by then a major New Zealand company, and retired from the board in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businesshalloffame.co.nz/whineray-wilson-james/ |title=Whineray, Wilson James |work=The Fairfax Media New Zealand Business Hall of Fame |accessdate=21 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the managing director of NZ Wool Marketing Corporation in 1973–74, chairman of the [[National Bank of New Zealand]], and a director of [[Auckland Airport|Auckland International Airport]] and [[APN News &amp; Media]].&lt;ref name=halloffame/&gt;

'''''World Business''''' was a weekly half hour features programme on [[CNBC]] presented by [[Raya Abirached]]. The show covered recent trends in global business, technology, luxury markets and the business of sport. The programme aired in Europe on Friday nights and in Asia on Saturday mornings.&lt;ref name="politico"&gt;{{cite news |title=CNBC drops 'World Business' |url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/onmedia/0811/CNBC_drops_World_Business.html |publisher=[[Politico]] |date=3 August 2011 |accessdate=3 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''World Business'' was cancelled after it was revealed that the show's production company was doubling as a [[public relations]] firm for Malaysian politicians, including [[Sarawak]] Chief Minister [[Abdul Taib Mahmud]].&lt;ref name="politico"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=CNBC Cancels Show Following Reports Political Leaders Paid For Good Coverage |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/cnbc-cancels-world-business-2011-8#ixzz1U1KFOr6o |work=[[Business Insider]] |date=3 August 2011 |first=Glynnis |last=MacNicol |accessdate=3 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Sarawak Report]]'', a blog run by [[Clare Rewcastle Brown]], reported that FBC Media had been receiving payments from Malaysian politicians in return for positive coverage, including carrying puff pieces on the programme to improve Taib's international image.&lt;ref name="politico"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=CNBC drops flagship show over paid Malaysian interviews |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/cnbc-drops-flagship-show-over-paid-malaysian-interviews/ |work=[[The Malaysian Insider]] |date=3 August 2011 |first=Debra |last=Chong |accessdate=3 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
