      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4095">{{About|the military euphemism}}

An '''acceptable loss''', also known as '''acceptable damage''', is a military [[euphemism]] used to indicate casualties or destruction inflicted by the enemy that is considered minor or tolerable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spears|first=Richard|title=McGraw-Hill's Dictionary of American Idoms and Phrasal Verbs|year=2006|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|isbn=0071486852|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[combat]] situations, leaders have to often choose between options where no one solution is perfect and all choices will lead to casualties or other costs to their own troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shambach|first=Stephen A.|title=Strategic Leadership Primer|year=2004|publisher=Department of Command, Leadership and Management, United States Army War College|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A small scale practical example might be when the advancement of troops is halted by a [[minefield]]. In many [[military operations]], the speed of advancement is more important than the safety of troops. Thus, the minefield must be "breached" even if this means some casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ghaffari |title=Mines and human casualties, a robotics approach toward mine clearing|journal=Proc. SPIE 5608, Intelligent Robots and Computer Vision XXII: Algorithms, Techniques, and Active Vision|volume=5608|date=October 2004|issue=306|pages=306|doi=10.1117/12.571260|series=Intelligent Robots and Computer Vision XXII: Algorithms, Techniques, and Active Vision|first1=Masoud|last2=Manthena|first2=Dinesh|last3=Ghaffari|first3=Alireza|last4=Hall|first4=Ernest L.|bibcode=2004SPIE.5608..306G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a larger [[Military strategy|strategic]] level, there is a limit to how many casualties a nation's military or the public are willing to withstand when they go to war. For example, there is an ongoing debate on how the conceptions of acceptable losses affect how the [[United States]] conducts its military operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lacquement |first=Richard A. Jr. |title=The Casualty-Aversion Myth |journal=Naval War College Review |date=March 2004 |url=https://www.usnwc.edu/getattachment/82192134-8122-404a-a139-2fcc2de2fe38/Casualty-Aversion-Myth,-The---Lacquement,-Richard-.aspx |accessdate=20 April 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161105133639/https://www.usnwc.edu/getattachment/82192134-8122-404a-a139-2fcc2de2fe38/Casualty-Aversion-Myth%2C-The---Lacquement%2C-Richard-.aspx |archivedate=5 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of acceptable losses has also been adopted to business use, meaning taking necessary risks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McManus |first=Gerard |title=Military Precision |url=http://www.aim.com.au/DisplayStory.asp?ID=875 |publisher=Australian Institute of Management |accessdate=21 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130711222335/http://www.aim.com.au/DisplayStory.asp?ID=875 |archivedate=11 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the general costs of doing business, also covered with terms such as ''waste'' or [[Shrinkage (accounting)|''shrinkage'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greenstone |first=Richard J. |title=Acceptable Losses |journal=The Licensing Journal |date=August 2001 |url=http://www.rjg.com/acceptablelosses.html |accessdate=21 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111023741/http://www.rjg.com/acceptablelosses.html |archivedate=11 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The euphemism is related to the concept of [[Risk assessment|''acceptable risk'']], which is used in many areas such as [[medicine]] and [[politics]], to describe a situation where the a course of action is taken because the expected benefits outweigh the potential hazards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Last|first=John M.|title=A Dictionary of Public Health|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195160901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alexis 'Lexi' Brasseur''' (26 December 1860 – 3 November 1924) was a [[Luxembourg]]eois playwright, composer, and metallurgist.

Born in [[Luxembourg City]] as the oldest son of [[Dominique Brasseur]], Brasseur attended the [[Athénée de Luxembourg]].  He followed this by studying law at the [[University of Bonn]], where he met [[Batty Weber]].&lt;ref name="Mersch 95"&gt;Mersch (1959), p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;  Brasseur received his doctorate in Luxembourg in 1886, and was [[call to the bar|called to the bar]], but showed little interest in working in the law.  He turned to [[metallurgy]], like his father and uncle [[Pierre Brasseur (Luxembourg)|Pierre]].&lt;ref name="Mersch 95" /&gt;

In 1894, he had written a [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]] with Batty Weber called ''De Monoonk Phëlpp''.&lt;ref&gt;Mersch (1959), p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1907, he moved to Paris, staying there for four years.&lt;ref&gt;Mersch (1959), pp. 95–6&lt;/ref&gt;  Brasseur died in Luxembourg City on 3 November 1924.&lt;ref name="Mersch 99"&gt;Mersch (1959), p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexis Brasseur was a member of the prominent [[Brasseur family]].  His father, [[Dominique Brasseur|Dominique]], was a [[deputy (legislator)|deputy]] (1866 – 99) and [[mayor of Luxembourg City]] (1891 – 94).  His brother, [[Robert Brasseur|Robert]], was a deputy and founded the [[Liberal League (Luxembourg)|Liberal League]].&lt;ref&gt;Mersch (1959), p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;  Alexis Brasseur married Jeanne Bian (1869–1960), sister of the liberal deputy [[Félix Bian]] and industrialist [[Émile Bian]].&lt;ref name="Mersch 99" /&gt;  They had three children.&lt;ref&gt;Mersch (1959), p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15246">'''Anti-sweatshop movement''' refers to campaigns to improve the conditions of workers in [[sweatshop]]s, i.e. manufacturing places characterized by low wages, poor working conditions and often [[child labor]]. It started in the 19th century in industrialized countries such as the [[United States]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and the [[United Kingdom]] to improve the conditions of workers in those countries.&lt;ref name=Blackburn&gt;Sheila Blackburn (1991) ''The Historical Journal'' '''34''' (1) 43-64 "Ideology and Social Policy: The Origins of the Trade Boards Act"&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Some of the earliest sweatshop critics were found in the 19th-century [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]] movement that had originally coalesced in opposition to chattel [[slavery]], and many abolitionists saw similarities between slavery and sweatshop work. As slavery was successively outlawed in industrial countries between 1794 (in France) and 1865 (in the United States), some abolitionists sought to broaden the anti-slavery consensus to include other forms of harsh labor, including sweatshops. As it happened, the first significant law to address sweatshops (the [[Factory Act|Factory Act of 1833]]) was passed in the United Kingdom at the same time that the slave trade (1807) and ownership of slaves (1833) were made illegal.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Miers, Suzanne (2003). ''Slavery in the Twentieth Century: The Evolution of a Global Problem''. Alta Mira Press, Walnut Creek, California.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, the abolitionist movement split apart. Some advocates focused on working conditions and found common cause with trade unions and [[Marxists]] and socialist political groups, or [[progressive movement]] and the [[muckraker]]s. Others focused on the continued slave trade and [[involuntary servitude]] in the colonial world. For those groups that remained focused on slavery, sweatshops became one of the primary objects of controversy. Workplaces across multiple sectors of the economy were categorized as sweatshops. However, there were fundamental philosophical disagreements about what constituted slavery. Unable to agree on the status of sweatshops, the abolitionists working with the [[League of Nations]] and the United Nations ultimately backed away from efforts to define slavery, and focused instead on a common precursor of slavery – [[human trafficking]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Those focused on working conditions included [[Friedrich Engels]], whose book ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'' would inspire the Marxist movement named for his collaborator, [[Karl Marx]]. In the United Kingdom the Factory Act was revised six further times between 1844 and 1878 to help improve the condition of workers by limiting work hours and the use of child labor. The formation of the [[International Labour Organization]] in 1919 under the League of Nations and then the United Nations sought to address the plight of workers the world over. Concern over working conditions as described by muckraker journalists during the [[Progressive Era]] in the United States saw the passage of new workers rights laws and ultimately resulted in the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] of 1938, passed during the [[New Deal]].&lt;ref&gt;"Fair Labor Standards Act - FLSA - 29 U.S. Code Chapter 8". ''finduslaw.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 20th century, with the advent of [[globalization]], movements were formed to protest the [[exploitation of labour|exploitation of workers]] in poorer countries by companies based in wealthy countries. [[Noam Chomsky]] said in ''[[The Nation]]'' that the anti-sweatshop movement is in some ways, he said, "like the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]], except that in this case it's striking at the core of the relations of exploitation. It's another example of how different constituencies are working together."&lt;ref name="Chomsky"&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/doc/20000424/chomsky/2 "Talking 'Anarchy' With Chomsky", ''The Nation'', April 5, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;  On February 4, 1997 Mayor Ed Boyle of North Olmsted, Ohio introduced the first piece of legislation actually prohibiting the government of purchasing, renting, or taking on consignment any and all goods made under sweatshop conditions and including in the definition those goods made by political prisoners. This legislation was copied by other American cities such as Detroit, New York, and San Francisco. Later Mayor Boyle introduced the legislation to the Mayors and Managers Association where it was immediately passed and he was invited by President Clinton to address a panel studying the subject in Washington, DC.

=== Contemporary anti-sweatshop movement ===
With the rise of [[globalization]] and [[transnational corporations]] (TNCs) such as [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] or [[Gap Inc.|Gap]], many sweatshop laborers have lost autonomy and corporations have gained in their invincibility to anti-sweatshop laws within a particular country, as it is incredibly easy for them to simply move to another country if the laws become too restricting.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Armbruster-Sandoval, Ralph. "Workers of the world unite? The contemporary anti-sweatshop movement and the struggle for social justice in the Americas." ''Work and Occupations'' 32.4 (2005): 464-485.&lt;/ref&gt;  As corporations globalize, many sweatshop movements have begun to see "worker internationalization" as one of the only viable solution; however, this requires strong labor movements, sufficient resources, and a commitment to mobilizing all workers, including women, which can be difficult to do at an international scale, as has been the case in the Americas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Criticisms of sweatshops ==
The criticisms of sweatshops, and thus the reason for an anti-sweatshop movement, deal largely with the lack of safety regulations in sweatshops and their exploitive nature.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Zwolinski, Matt. “Sweatshops, Choice, and Exploitation”. ''Business Ethics Quarterly'' 17.4 (2007): 689–727. Web...&lt;/ref&gt;  Matt Zwolinski argues that though technically sweatshop laborers "choose" to work in sweatshops, this decision is not "fully voluntary" and that though sweatshops may provide opportunities that would not otherwise exist, when a worker "consents" to work in a sweatshop, they are also consenting to labor practices that overall cause more harm than good to the laborer.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Yet another criticism of sweatshops is the prevalence of child labor working heavy machinery for very low wages, often requiring that they be taken out of school, and thus disrupt their education, and exposing them to very dangerous working conditions that can endanger their health.&lt;ref&gt;Hartman, Laura Pincus, and Denis Gordon Arnold. "Worker rights and low wage industrialization: How to avoid sweatshops." ''Human Rights Quarterly''28.3 (2006): 676-700.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects ==
A study published in 2011 found that while in most cases anti-sweatshop movements did not affect sales for companies using sweatshops, they did correspond with a decrease in the sales of well-known, more specialized brands and more intense movements caused more significant reduction in the sales.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Bartley, Tim, and Curtis Child. “Movements, Markets and Fields: The Effects of Anti-sweatshop Campaigns on U.S. Firms, 1993-2000”. ''Social Forces'' 90.2 (2011): 425–451. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;  The same study also found that anti-sweatshop events also seemed to correspond with lower stock prices for the companies that were the target of these events, though some major anti-sweatshop events such the ''Kaksy'' lawsuit against Nike, did not result in any discernible change in stock price of the targeted company.  The study found that 64.1% of the companies targeted by anti-sweatshop movements saw drops in stock price in the five days following the anti-sweatshop event, and 56.4% saw drops in the two days following the event.  Though the study did find these slight negative economic effects, it did not find that, when taking into account companies of all reputations, anti-sweatshop movements or events damaged the reputation of the companies they targeted to a statistically significant degree; however, there does seem to be a slight undercutting of the reputations of companies with positive reputations when they are faced with anti-sweatshop campaigns, particularly intense ones.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Criticisms ==

=== Sweatshops offer opportunities that might otherwise not exist ===
Some people such as Pulitzer Prize winning journalist [[Nicholas Kristof]]f argue that the anti-sweatshop movement "risks harming the very people it is aiming to help"&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web
| url = https://www.nytimes.com/library/magazine/home/20000924mag-sweatshops.html
| title = Two Cheers for Sweatshops
| website = www.nytimes.com
| access-date = 2016-02-26
}}&lt;/ref&gt; because sweatshops signify the start of an industrial revolution in Asia and offer people a path towards making money and escaping poverty that would otherwise not be available to them.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The anti-sweatshop movement, in this view, can harm the impoverished workers by increasing labor costs for factories which, in turn, can incentivize turning to technology instead of people for labor and thus reduce the number of employees needed.  Additionally, if anti-sweatshop movements succeed and manage to get stricter guidelines passed, companies may move to countries with less strict laws governing sweatshops, thus removing a source of jobs and money for impoverished countries.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Increasing regulations or wages would increase unemployment ===
Even if a company does not move to another country to find somewhere with more relaxed labor laws, economic demand theory says that the more a good costs, the less the demand for it is.  Because of this, it is possible to argue, as some economists have, that even though the labor is "exploitative," it should be permitted, as trying to put regulations on sweatshop labor would only result in sweatshops needing fewer workers, thus reducing opportunities for individuals to make a living.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, Benjamin, and Matt Zwolinski. "The ethical and economic case against sweatshop labor: A critical assessment." ''Journal of business ethics''107.4 (2012): 449-472.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Not all economists support sweatshops ===
Most economists say that sweatshops can be a benefit to Third World workers and the anti-sweatshop movement could reduce Third World employment and investment. The economic ways to think about this issue, employers and employees can both get benefits when they voluntarily sign the contract, no matter how low the wages are from the external’s point of view. An economist pointed out “as simple as this: ‘Either you believe labor demand curves are downward sloping, or you don’t,’ as a neoclassical colleague said to me. Of course, not to believe that demand curves are negatively sloped would be tantamount to declaring yourself an economic illiterate”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=John|title=Why Economists Are Wrong About Sweatshops and the Antisweatshop Movement|date=2003|pages=93–122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A professional appointed by the bankruptcy court to investigate and oversee certain aspects of the debtor or the proceedings.  By way of comparison, the role of the trustee is to operate the business of the debtor whereas the role of the examiner is to investigate and report to the court.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bankruptcydata.com/Glossary.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In bankruptcy cases, an examiner refers to an officer appointed by a bankruptcy for the purpose of reviewing certain aspects of the operation of a Chapter 11 debtor. Although his/her main function is investigation, an examiner is usually called as mediators to assist the court in resolving bankruptcy disputes. An Examiner can be appointed in complicated Chapter 11 case involving a utility with instructions to investigate fraud and other irregularities, and to mediate and assist in breaking a deadlock in plan negotiations.

{{Nihongo|'''Bukichi Miki'''|三木 武吉|Miki Bukichi|15 August 1884 – 4 July 1956}} was a Japanese politician. He was a close friend and ally of [[Ichiro Hatoyama]], and was the key figure in carrying out the "conservative merger" that resulted in the formation of the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]].

Despite being a powerful [[conservative]] politician in the [[Taishō period|Taishō]] and [[Shōwa period|Shōwa]] eras, Miki remarkably never held any cabinet post. He still has a high reputation as the archetype of a behind-the-scenes power broker, and at the zenith of their power there were times when both [[Kanemaru Shin]] and [[Hiromu Nonaka]] were openly complimented by Prime Minister [[Yasuhiro Nakasone]] for having "surpassed Bukichi Miki".

Miki's nicknames included "the heckling general", "the wily schemer", and "the great [[tanuki]] of Japanese politics".

== Life before politics ==
He was born in [[Takamatsu, Kagawa|Takamatsu]], then in [[Ehime Prefecture]] but now in [[Kagawa Prefecture]], as the first son of Komon Miki, an antiques dealer. His family was not related to that of [[Takeo Miki]].

In his second year at Takamatsu Secondary, now Kagawa Prefectural Takamatsu High School, he walked out on his bill at an [[udon]] restaurant and encouraged others to do the same, and thus was expelled from school. He transferred to Doshisha Secondary in Kyoto, now Doshisha Junior and Senior High School, but was expelled again for getting into a fight. He went to Tokyo with the help of the politician Tooru Hoshi but on 21 June 1901, the day on which Miki would go to work as a live-in student at his law office, Hoshi was assassinated.

Miki was admitted into Tokyo Vocational School, called [[Waseda University]] from 1902 and on, where he counted among his classmates future politicians [[Ryūtarō Nagai|Ryutaro Nagai]] and [[Ikuo Oyama]] and baseball player Shin Hashido. While spending much of his time chasing women in [[Shinjuku]], he earnestly studied law and practiced baseball. Although he even joined the Waseda Baseball Club at its inception, it was said that he exhibited little talent.&lt;ref&gt;Shogaku Yudate, スポーツ人国記 (Tokyo: Popura Shobo, 1934), 117-118.&lt;/ref&gt; However, his name does not appear in Bushi, the official records of the club, and he was also not a member of the Tomon Club, composed of the Waseda Baseball Club's alumni. This was also the time of his budding romance with Kaneko Amano, a woman known as "the beauty of Waseda" who was popular among the students and would go on to become Miki's wife. He graduated in 1904.

Miki worked for a brief time as a scribe at Waseda University Library.&lt;ref&gt;Hideyuki Fujiwara, "[http://www.wul.waseda.ac.jp/Libraries/fumi/78/fumi78.pdf 知られざる図書館員 三木武吉]," Waseda Daigaku Toshokan Ho, March 15, 2010, 30-31.&lt;/ref&gt; The next year in 1905 he went to work with the [[Bank of Japan]] attached to their [[Moji-ku, Kitakyūshū|Moji]] branch. However he participated in an open-house anti-government meeting in opposition to the [[Treaty of Portsmouth]] and after giving a speech demanding the resignation of Prime Minister [[Taro Katsura]] he was charged with violating the code of conduct for civil servants and was discharged. In 1907 he passed the Higher Civil Service Examination for the judiciary and was appointed as an assistant judicial officer in the [[Tokyo District Court]], but life as a civil servant did not suit his personality and after seven months he instead became a lawyer. The same year he married Kaneko Amano.

== In pre-war politics ==
In 1913 Miki was elected to the [[Ushigome]] ward assembly. Soon after he ran for a seat in the [[House of Representatives (Japan)|House of Representatives]] but was defeated. In 1916 he joined the [[Kenseikai]] and in 1917 won a seat in that year's general elections to the House.

Miki distinguished himself in his new role as a member of the House. Above all he more than earned his nickname, "the heckling general", through his trenchant criticisms of the government. He also caught the eye of [[Osachi Hamaguchi]] following his spirited debate with [[Home Ministry (Japan)|Home Minister]] [[Takejirō Tokonami|Takejiro Tokonami]] in defense of [[universal suffrage]]. After that Hamaguchi became his political mentor.

In 1920 Miki toured Siberia for one month as a member of a committee of inquiry of the [[National Diet|Imperial Diet]] concerning the [[Japan during the Siberian Intervention|Siberian expedition]]. The tour led Miki to the conclusion that the expedition was interference in the internal affairs of another nation inspired by the militaristic ambitions of the [[Imperial Japanese Army|army]] who were steeped in the traditions of the [[Meiji oligarchy]]. Therefore, he wrote up an open letter and a speech for [[Interpellation (politics)|question period]] which held the militarists, oligarchs, and bureaucrats accountable for the war and sought to link the neutralization of these forces to the establishment of true parliamentary democracy. With a view of also using it to force the resignation of incumbent Prime Minister [[Takashi Hara]], Miki handed in the completed manuscript to [[Takaaki Kato]], president of the Kenseikai, through Hamaguchi. However Miki was disheartened when the manuscript was rejected by Kato and Hamaguchi who advised him to focus on internal matters for fear his revelations about the origins of the war would damage Japan's international reputation. Even so, they were both deeply impressed by the depth and detail of his work.&lt;ref&gt;[[Isamu Togawa]], 小説三木武吉 (Tokyo: Kadokawa Shoten, 1983), 71-75.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1922 Miki was also elected to the Tokyo City Council. He formed the Shisei Kakushin Domei which emphasized cleaning up city politics and clashed with the [[Rikken Seiyukai]]-aligned Shinkokai. At that time one of his political foes in Tokyo City politics was Shinkokai member Ichiro Hatoyama, who would later become a close friend.

In January 1924, at the young age of 39 after having served only two terms in the House, Miki was promoted to the post of Kenseikai Secretary General and led the party in the [[Japanese general election, 1924|general election of May 1924]]. The Kenseikai won a plurality of the seats, and Takaaki Kato set up his first cabinet with the support of the so-called "three groups protecting the constitution", the Kenseikai, the Rikken Seiyukai, and the Kakushin Club.

When Hamaguchi Osachi, who Miki had looked up to for a long time, took office as [[Minister of Finance (Japan)|Finance Minister]], Miki was appointed the Ministry's parliamentary councillor under Hamaguchi's tutelage. In 1927 he joined the [[Rikken Minseito]] under Hamaguchi's leadership, and at the same time went on a tour of Europe. Thus, Miki had reached the pinnacle of his pre-war political career when a disaster befell him. In 1928 he was implicated in a case of bribery by Keisei Railway of the Tokyo municipal government, was convicted in court, and, for the time being, ended up leaving politics.

== Political comeback up to the purge ==
In 1939 he became president of the newspaper firm Hochi Shimbun. He returned to politics in 1942, winning election as an independent candidate in that year's [[Japanese general election, 1942|general election]]. In the election, Ichiro Hatoyama also won office as an unaligned candidate. Before the war Miki and Hatoyama had been leading members of rivals parties, the Rikken Minseito and the Rikken Seiyukai. However, in wartime they were both defenders of liberalism who together resisted the military authorities, even if in the end they were both compelled to affiliate with the [[Imperial Rule Assistance Political Association]]. At that time, Hatoyama and Miki made a pact to form a government one day with Hatoyama as prime minister and Miki as Speaker of the House of Representatives. In August 1942 Hochi Shimbun was bought out by [[Yomiuri Shimbun]].

After the war, he took part in planning the establishment of the [[Liberal Party (Japan, 1945)|Liberal Party]]. In the [[Japanese general election, 1946|elections of April 1946]] the Liberal Party won a plurality and it seemed like a real possibility that Hatoyama would become prime minister, but the formation of the cabinet fell through at the last minute when Hatoyama was [[Purge (During Occupation of Japan)|purged]] by the US occupation authorities. [[Shigeru Yoshida]] become President of the Liberal Party in Hatoyama's stead.

Because Yoshida still disliked the pre-war politicians for having been deferent to the military, he selected his cabinet in private consultation with his close advisor Joji Hayashi without discussing the matter with senior members of the Liberal Party including Miki, who was Chairman of the Executive Council, and Secretary General Ichiro Kono. The party leadership was furious, some even demanding Yoshida's removal from the party presidency, but Miki managed to calm them down by pointing out that if they withdrew their support from Yoshida then power would likely pass to the [[Japan Socialist Party|Socialist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Isamu Togawa, 小説三木武吉 (Tokyo: Kadokawa Shoten, 1983), 209-219.&lt;/ref&gt;

Then, on 24 May 1946, two days after the formation of Yoshida's first cabinet, Miki was also purged.

== The fall of Yoshida and ascension of Hatoyama ==
On 24 June 1951, when the ban on holding office was lifted for those purged, Miki began seeking to have Prime Minister Yoshida removed in cooperation with Ichiro Kono and Hatoyama. The three were reinstated in the Liberal Party, but by now the party was completely controlled by the "Yoshida school" directly allied with the Prime Minister, and a promise Yoshida had made to hand back power to Hatoyama after his return had been effectively annulled.

Miki, Hatoyama, and Kono thus moved towards founding a new political party. However, Hatoyama suffered a stroke and the plan fell through. Miki changed course in favor of undermining Yoshida from within the Liberal Party. Operating behind the scenes, Miki devoted himself to all manner of schemes and became leader of the anti-Yoshida movement. To combat this, Yoshida took the advice of his political adviser Tsuruhei Matsuno and jolted the pro-Hatoyama faction by calling [[Japanese general election, 1952|a snap election]] in August 1952. On the recommendation of Kozen Hirokawa, Yoshida also expelled both Ichiro Kono and [[Tanzan Ishibashi]] from the Liberal Party on the basis of their opposition to his leadership. The fact that Miki Bukichi, the central dissident, was not expelled was said to be due to the debt of gratitude Yoshida felt to him for saving his first cabinet in 1946.

The Liberal Party won a majority government in the elections and Yoshida formed his fourth cabinet. The remainder of the pro-Hatoyama faction constituted the "Democratization League", essentially an opposition party operating within the ruling party. The Democratization League absented itself from the [[National Diet|Diet]] when a motion of censure was tabled by the opposition parties against [[Ministry of International Trade and Industry|Minister of International Trade and Industry]] [[Hayato Ikeda]] for his gaffe, "The bankruptcy and suicide of one or two small businessmen can't be avoided." The motion passed and Ikeda resigned.

In December 1952 the Democratization League ratcheted up the pressure on Yoshida against the backdrop of the passage of the revised draft budget. Next year, at the same time as the League arranged for Kono and Ishibashi to re-join the party, it forced the resignation of Secretary General Joji Hayashi and Chairman of the Executive Council Shuji Masutani, who were key allies of Prime Minister Yoshida. Miki was appointed Masutani's successor in the party's Executive Council. Seeking to throw the Liberal Party establishment into disarray, Miki drove a wedge between Yoshida and his ally Kozen Hirokawa by putting the idea into his head that Yoshida intended to make [[Taketora Ogata]] his successor. Then Miki slyly proposed to the Yoshida camp that Hirokawa be elevated to the position of Secretary General, presenting Yoshida with a no-win scenario in which he could either accede to the request and allow Miki to manipulate the party through Hirokawa, or refuse the request and further alienate him.&lt;ref&gt;Isamu Togawa, 小説吉田学校 (Tokyo: Ryudo Shuppan, 1971), 255-257.&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, Hirokawa was not made Secretary General and his behind-the-scenes split with Yoshida became definitive.

On 28 February 1953 Yoshida responded to a question from the rightist socialist representative Eiichi Nishimura by calling him a "stupid fool" in the Diet. Miki discussed the matter behind closed doors with the leader of the [[Rightist Socialist Party of Japan|Rightist Socialist Party]], [[Inejiro Asanuma]]. Asanuma was considering a motion of no-confidence against the government but Miki changed his mind and Asanuma agreed instead to table a disciplinary action against the Prime Minister himself. Miki also brought [[Takeo Miki]] together with Tadao Oasa and Kenzo Matsumura, who were veteran politicians from before the war, and reached an understanding with them, and even arranged for Hirokawa's 30-man faction to abstain from the vote. Thus, the disciplinary action was approved.

Miki then talked reluctant opposition parties into tabling a motion of no-confidence against the government and entered talks with Yoshida while using the motion as a bargaining chip to urge the beleaguered Prime Minister to resign. Yoshida nevertheless turned Miki down and the Democratization League's 22 members separated from the Liberal Party. With their backing, on 14 March 1953, the House of Representatives passed the motion of no-confidence 229 votes in favor versus 218 against. Hirokawa and 16 of his followers then also split with the Liberal Party to form the Separatist Liberal Party.

Yoshida immediately dissolved the House and in [[Japanese general election, 1953|the elections]] his Liberals won 199 seats, a loss of 23, but held onto their status as first party. The separatists attained only 35 seats. In November, half a year from the election, Yoshida and Hatoyama met one another and most of the separatists who were loyal to Hatoyama re-joined the Liberal Party. Only eight men refused to return, Bukichi Miki, Ichiro Kono, Takechiyo Matsuda, To Matsunaga, Umekichi Nakamura, Shinjiro Yamamura, Masanosuke Ikeda, and Kaku Ando, who together called themselves the Japan Liberal Party. Others called them "The Eight Samurai," in reference to the new movie [[The Seven Samurai]].

In January 1954 con-man Masutomi Ito was exposed for perpetrating mass investment fraud, a scheme which eventually led investigators to a ring of shipbuilders who were bribing politicians in exchange for subsidies. Liberal Party Secretary General [[Eisaku Sato]] and Political Affairs Research Committee head Hayato Ikeda were suspected of involvement. A few days earlier Yoshida's Liberals had met with the Reform Party and the Separatist Liberal Party and held negotiations with representatives of each party in the hopes of unifying the three [[Right-wing politics|right]]-leaning parties. When the talks fell through, Miki saw his chance and linked up with Hatoyama and [[Nobusuke Kishi]] of the Liberal Party as well as Reform Party members Takeo Miki and Tadao Oasa to seek the establishment of a new anti-Yoshida political party. In November 1954 the [[Japan Democratic Party (1954)|Democratic Party]] was constituted with Hatoyama as president, Kishi as Secretary General, and Miki as Chairman of the Executive Council.

Next month Yoshida's cabinet finally resigned en masse and Hatoyama became prime minister. Half of Miki's long-held ambition for a government with Hatoyama as prime minister and himself as Speaker of the House of Representatives had been achieved. However, when the House elected its speaker immediately following the [[Japanese general election, 1955|general elections]], all the parties except Miki's Democratic Party banded together and put forward Liberal Party member Shuji Masutani as their joint candidate. Because of this, Miki, the candidate of the governing party who was expected to get elected as a matter of course, ended up being defeated and his dream came to nothing.

== The "conservative merger" ==
[[File:Bukichi Miki.jpg|thumb|right|Bukichi Miki from his days as an [[Member of Parliament|MP]]]]On 13 April 1955 Miki called upon the right-wing political parties to rally together and announced that should rivalries with the Hatoyama cabinet become an obstacle to the merger, the government was prepared to resign en masse.&lt;ref&gt;Mayumi Itoh, The Hatoyama Dynasty: Japanese Political Leadership Through the Generations (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2003), 127.&lt;/ref&gt; At this point Miki had been fretting over the unification of the [[Leftist Socialist Party of Japan|Leftist Socialist Party]] with its rivals the Rightist Socialists and what's more had been told by his doctor that he had contracted cancer and would live no more than three years.

At the same time as Miki was striving to reach consensus in the Democratic Party he engaged in manoeuvres within the Liberal Party. On 15 May 1955 he met with Banboku Ono, the Chairman of the Executive Council in the Liberal Party. Ono had once been a close aide to Hatoyama but was superseded by Miki even though Miki had previously been Hatoyama's political enemy, and for that Ono despised Miki more than anyone else. Even so, Miki pleaded with Ono, cleverly appealing to his strong sense of patriotism, and won his support. Then a meeting was held between Miki and Kishi and their Liberal Party counterparts Banboku Ono and Kojiro Ishii and they officially began the process of merging their parties. On the other hand, Reform Party leaders Takeo Miki and Kenzo Matsumura fired back with their argument that conservatives should be represented by two parties rather than only one. As the debate was coming to nothing, Hatoyama blurted out while weeping that his cabinet would have to resign, and panicking at the prospect, they ended up backing the merger.

However, the final controversy over who should be selected for the presidency of the new party was no easier. As a result, they put the presidency on the back burner and set up an interim presidential committee, agreeing to choose the president through an election after the party had been formed. Thus, the difficulty-fraught conservative merger was completed, and Japan's first unified right-wing party, the Liberal Democratic Party, was born. Miki, Hatoyama, Ono, and Taketora Ogata shared the interim presidential committee, and five months later Hatoyama was inaugurated as president of the Liberal Democratic Party. On the future of the Liberal Democratic Party, which had gotten off the ground leaving the most vexatious conflicts unresolved, Miki is well known for his assessment that the party "would be lucky to last two or three years".&lt;ref&gt;Kent E. Calder, Crisis and Compensation: Public Policy and Political Stability in Japan, 1949-1986 (Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1988), 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
Miki was bedridden from April 1956, and his condition gradually worsened. On 4 July he died at his home in [[Meguro, Tokyo]]. The cause of death was stomach cancer. He was 71 years old.

A bronze statue of Miki was constructed near [[Ritsurin Garden]] in his hometown of Takamatsu.

== Famous statements and retorts ==
During the 1917 general elections, in which Miki would be elected for the first time, the Rikken Seiyukai candidate Zenshiro Tsuboya said of Miki in a speech, "I'm not going to name names, but there is a certain candidate who has two years worth of unpaid rent. He even owes more than one year's worth of debt to the rice merchant. Can such a man really discuss state affairs at the podium of parliament as a representative of our nation? I believe that such a candidate in these circumstances should gracefully decline to run for office." At the next town hall meeting Miki hit back, saying "I've heard that a certain candidate has been going around attacking as disgraceful the fact that a man with debts is running for office. That debt-ridden candidate is I, the humble Bukichi Miki. Because I am poor, I am in debt. Though he was just called a rice merchant, that man is the rice merchant Mr. Yamashita from Yamabuki. It was said that I owe him more than one year's worth of debt, but that's not correct. Actually, I owe him more than two years' worth of debt. I also owe rent, but not two years' worth. To be more precise, the situation is that my landlord has been waiting for payment for more than three years. I want to correct this misinformation about me right now!" The room burst into laughter and applause and one person shouted "Nice one, debt king!" Miki's landlord and the rice merchant Tatsujiro Yamashita were also present at the meeting and after that they both stood up at Miki's urging. Yamashita said, "I am the rice merchant Yamashita. How about it everyone, will you please support Mr. Miki?" That was the last time the stunned Zenshiro Tsuboya would bring up Miki's debts.&lt;ref&gt;Isamu Togawa, 小説三木武吉 (Tokyo: Kadokawa Shoten, 1983), 7-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 43rd session of the Imperial Diet which began on 29 June 1920, [[Korekiyo Takahashi]], the [[Ministry of Finance (Japan)|Finance Minister]] in [[Takashi Hara]]'s cabinet who went by the nickname "Daruma", was in the process of explaining the naval budget. When Takahashi said "We will make this into a long-term plan of ten years for the army and eight years for the navy", Miki shouted out "Nine years for Daruma!" This was a very witty statement using the story of the Buddhist monk [[Bodhidharma|Daruma Daishi]] who faced a wall in China's Shaolin Monastery and after doing zen meditation for nine years, achieved enlightenment. The assemblymen burst into laughter and Takahashi also stopped speaking, looked back at Prime Minister Hara in the ministers' gallery, and smiled wryly. Even Takaaki Kato and Osachi Hamaguchi, up to then well known for their stoic seriousness, famously cracked up in their seats.&lt;ref&gt;Isamu Togawa, 小説三木武吉 (Tokyo: Kadokawa Shoten, 1983), 63-64.&lt;/ref&gt; Also during the time when Hara was serving as prime minister, a cabinet minister was explaining the aims of a proposed piece of legislation in a somber and monotone voice as if reading a sutra. When the session adjourned Miki jeered "Next we may burn the incense", and the assembly burst out laughing.

At a meeting of MPs from the [[Imperial Rule Assistance Political Association]] for deciding party policy towards the [[Hideki Tojo|Tojo]] cabinet's Corporate Restructuring Bill, [[Seigo Nakano]] pointed at the senior members of the IRAPA and remarked "Swarming around the center of power, I see only sycophants. This will in the end lead to the destruction of our country. The people who are leading Japan astray are all the bootlickers in the IRAPA." When the mainstream IRAPA members booed Nakano, Miki abruptly stood up and famously shouted "Shut up, all you bootlickers!", and the hecklers immediately fell silent.&lt;ref&gt;Isamu Togawa, 小説三木武吉 (Tokyo: Kadokawa Shoten, 1983), 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

At a speaking event Miki attended during the general elections of 1952, a rival office-seeker, Toshichi Fuke, said of Miki "After the war, we achieved [[Women's suffrage#Japan|equal rights for men and women]], but even so one big-shot candidate keeps four mistresses! Is such an immoral man qualified to be involved in national politics?" Miki. however, was the next one up to the podium, and he replied "The person that the impotent candidate who stands before me calls a 'big-shot candidate' is the humble Bukichi Miki. What Bukichi Miki is thinking is, would you all prefer to give your one precious vote to this pitifully weak candidate, or to a big-shot like me? What's more, because I must strive for accuracy, I will go ahead and correct the mathematical errors of the aforementioned weak candidate right now. It was said that I have four mistresses, but actually I have five. Confusing four with five ought to be considered shameful even for a first grader. It seems like he failed to count one. However, all these women have now become old maids and aren't of use to me anymore. Even so, Bukichi Miki could never do something so inhumane as abandon them! Even today I care for them all." The crowd roared with laughter and approval.&lt;ref&gt;Isamu Togawa, 小説三木武吉 (Tokyo: Kadokawa Shoten, 1983), 257-259.&lt;/ref&gt; Miki kept his five mistresses up to his death, who lived with him and cared for his wife Kaneko. However, he was also a loving husband who had stated, "The one for whom I have never stopped feeling true affection is definitely my wife Kaneko. It's just that I happened to fall in love with other women."&lt;ref&gt;Isamu Togawa, 小説三木武吉 (Tokyo: Kadokawa Shoten, 1983), 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Miki was serving as Chairman of the Executive Council of the Democratic Party, the [[Shiun Maru disaster]] occurred, a deadly collision between two [[Japanese National Railways]] ferries, resulting in the resignation of JNR President Sonosuke Nagasaki. Miki proposed [[Shinji Sogo]], who had a long career as a bureaucrat in the pre-war [[Japanese Government Railways]], to fill his shoes and met him personally to persuade him. At the meeting Miki aggressively approached the wavering Sogo and said "Our railway department, which has always been like a home to you, is probably on the verge of collapse due to these scandals. Are you so disloyal that you won't even try to stand and fight for your homeland when called upon?" This led Sogo to answer "I will never be a traitor!" and convinced him to take up the post.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifsa.jp/index.php?Gsogoshinji article on Shinji Sogo - Kogaku Shimbun International Foreign Students Association]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''chief operating officer''' ('''COO'''), also called the '''chief operations officer''', is one of the highest-ranking executive positions in an organization, comprising part of the "[[C-Suite]]". The COO is responsible for the daily operation of the [[company]],&lt;ref name=investopedia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coo.asp|title=Chief Operating Officer – COO|accessdate=2011-02-08|publisher=Investopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and routinely reports to the highest-ranking executive, usually the [[chief executive officer]] (CEO).&lt;ref name=Levinson1993&gt;{{Citation|title=Between CEO and COO|jstor=4165123|year=1993|author=Levinson, Harry|journal=Academy of Management Executive|pages=71–83|volume=7|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The COO is usually the [[second in command]] at the firm, especially if the highest-ranking executive is the [[Chairman]] and [[chief executive officer|CEO]].

Unlike other [[C-Suite]] positions, which tend to be defined according to commonly designated responsibilities across most companies, the COO job tends to be defined in relation to the specific CEO with whom they work, given the close working relationship of these two individuals.&lt;ref name=hbr2006&gt;{{Citation|title=Second in Command: The Misunderstood Role of the Chief Operating Officer|url=http://hbr.org/2006/05/second-in-command-the-misunderstood-role-of-the-chief-operating-officer/ar/1|year=2006|journal=Harvard Business Review|pages=70–79|volume=84|issue=5|last1="Miles"|first1=Stephen A.|last2="Bennett"|first2=Nathan|accessdate=2011-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many ways, the selection of a COO is similar to the selection of a [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] or [[White House Chief of Staff|Chief of Staff]] of the United States: power and responsibility structures vary in government and private regimes depending on the style and needs of the President or CEO. Thus, the COO role meets individual expectations and changes as leadership teams adjust.&lt;ref name=hbr2006 /&gt;

===President===
In a similar vein to the COO, the title of corporate President as a separate position (as opposed to being combined with a "[[C-Suite]]" designation, such as "President and CEO" or "President and COO") is also loosely defined. The President is usually the legally recognized highest rank of corporate officer, ranking above the various Vice Presidents (including Senior Vice President and Executive Vice President), but on its own generally considered subordinate, in practice, to the CEO.

In 2007, the investment banking firms of [[Bear Stearns]] and [[Morgan Stanley]] each had two presidents (Warren Spector and Alan Schwartz at Bear, Robert Scully and Zoe Cruz at Morgan) reporting to one CEO (who was also chairman of the board); each president was essentially a co-COO (despite the lack of title) overseeing half of the firm's business divisions. Schwartz became sole president of Bear after Spector was ousted, and several months later assumed the position of CEO as well when [[James Cayne]] was forced to resign (Cayne remained chairman).

[[Tom Anselmi]] of [[Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment]] was Chief Operating Officer from 2004 until September 6, 2013. Between the departure of [[Richard Peddie]] and the hiring of [[Tim Leiweke]] for the posts of President and CEO, Anselmi added the title of President from September 4, 2012 to June 30, 2013, however he remained COO and did not receive the title of CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cox|first=Damien|title=Maple Leafs: New era of MLSE intrigue unfolding: Cox|url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/leafs/article/1252698--a-new-era-of-mlse-intrigue-unfolding|accessdate=September 8, 2012|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=September 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Fuld]], the chairman and CEO of [[Lehman Brothers]], had a succession of "number twos" under him, usually titled as President and Chief Operating Officer. Chris Pettit was Fuld's second-in-command for two decades until November 26, 1996, when he resigned as President and board member. Pettit lost a power struggle with his deputies (Steve Lessing, Tom Tucker, and Joseph M. Gregory) on March 15 that year that caused him to relinquish its COO title, likely brought about after the three men found about Pettit's extramarital affairs, which violated Fuld's unwritten rules on marriage and social etiquette. Bradley Jack and Joseph M. Gregory were appointed co-COOs in 2002, but Jack was demoted to the Office of the Chairman in May 2004 and departed in June 2005 with a severance package of $80&amp;nbsp;million, making Gregory the sole COO. While Fuld was considered the "face" of Lehman brothers, Gregory was in charge of day-to-day operations and he influenced culture to drive the bottom line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nymag.com/print/?/news/business/52603/|title=Print Page|website=nymag.com|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory was demoted on June 12, 2008 and replaced as President and COO by [[Bart McDade]], who had been serving as head of Equities, and McDade would see Lehman through bankruptcy.&lt;ref name=Ward2010/&gt;&lt;ref name="truell"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/27/business/pettit-resigns-as-president-of-lehman-brothers-firm.html?pagewanted=print| work=The New York Times| publisher=NYTimes.com| first=Peter| last=Truell| title=Pettit Resigns as President Of Lehman Brothers Firm| date=November 27, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Ovitz]] was President from 1995 to 1997, being hired by Eisner and then dismissed not long afterwards. [[Bob Iger]] was President and COO from 2000 to 2005, when he succeeded Eisner as CEO. [[Thomas O. Staggs]] was COO from 2015 to 2016, during that time the senior executive team had a dual reporting structure to both Staggs and Iger; Staggs resigned after the board did not give him assurances that he would succeed as CEO.

[[Manulife]] has used the President and COO titles for separate roles. From June 5 until September 30, 2017, Rocco "Roy" Gori served as President where he oversaw Manulife's global operating businesses, with his subordinates being the general managers of the Canadian, U.S., and Asia Divisions, and the Chief Investment Officer. Gori reported to Chief Executive Officer Donald Guloien before additionally assuming the title of CEO on October 1, 2017 upon Guloien's retirement. Linda Mantia, the Chief Operating Officer, reported to the President on Corporate Strategy while continuing to report to the CEO on all other matters including Corporate Development, Analytics, Technology, Marketing, Innovation, Human Resources, Regulatory and Public Affairs, Global Resourcing and Procurement, and the Global Program Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/manulife-appoints-roy-gori-as-president-617424583.html|title=Manulife appoints Roy Gori as President|author=|date=|website=www.newswire.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current situation===
Some modern companies operate without a COO.  For example,  in 2007 almost 58% of [[Fortune 500]] companies did not have a COO.&lt;ref name=Gerut2010&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these instances the CEO either takes on more roles and responsibilities, or the roles traditionally assigned to the COO are carried out by sub [[C-Suite]] executives. Although the number of COOs has been in decline for the past 10 years, there are reasons to anticipate an increased utilization of the position in the future, including:
* Companies are becoming larger and more complex, making it more difficult for one person alone to have total oversight over the whole organization.&lt;ref name=hbr2006 /&gt;
* Companies are finding a strong relationship between firm performance and the presence of a COO.&lt;ref name=Marcel2009&gt;{{Citation

==Roles and functions==

The role of the COO differs from industry to industry and from organization to organization. Some organizations function without a COO. Others may have two COOs, each assigned to oversee several business lines or divisions, such as [[Lehman Brothers]] from 2002 to 2004 when Bradley Jack and Joseph M. Gregory were the co-COOs.&lt;ref name=Ward2010&gt;{{Citation

In the [[manufacturing sector]], the primary role of the COO is routinely one of [[operations management]], meaning that the COO is responsible for the development, design, operation, and improvement of the systems that create and deliver the firm's [[product (business)|products]]. The COO is responsible for ensuring that [[business operations]] are efficient and effective and that the proper [[Resource management|management of resources]], [[supply chain management|distribution of goods and services to customers]] and analysis of queue systems is conducted.

Despite the functional diversity associated with the role of COO, there are some common functions the COOs usually perform:
* At the direction of the CEO and Board of Directors, marshaling limited resources to the most productive uses with the aim of creating maximum value for the company's stakeholders
* Developing and cascading the organization's strategy/mission statement to the lower-ranking staff, and implementing appropriate rewards/recognition and coaching/corrective practices to align personnel with company goals
* Planning by prioritizing customer, employee, and organizational requirements
* Maintaining and monitoring staffing, levels, Knowledge-Skills-Attributes (KSA), expectations and motivation to fulfill organizational requirements
* Driving performance measures for the operation (including a consideration of efficiency versus effectiveness), often in the form of dashboards convenient for review of high level key indicators

===COO as successor===
Routinely in large organizations the COO will be the [[heir apparent]] to the CEO.&lt;ref name=Galbraith2009&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; COOs transitioning into the CEO role often face similar challenges including:
* '''Not being automatically granted the luxury of a "diagnostic period."''' Given that they know the company, COOs turned CEOs are often expected to hit the ground running when in actuality they too need to enter diagnostic mode to fully understand their new role and to see the company from a new perspective.
* '''Finding time to manage a new key stakeholder: The board.''' Many COOs turned CEOs are often surprised how time-intensive managing the Board of Directors can be and must learn to incorporate this important responsibility into an already packed schedule.
* '''Being in the spotlight.''' COOs are used to having the luxury of working "behind the scenes." As CEO, many are surprised to find they have become a "public" figure both inside and outside the organization and must learn how to manage this additional obligation.
* '''Recalibrating their image.''' Often COOs struggle not with the strategy portion of the job itself, but overcoming the perception of other stakeholders that they are an "execution" executive versus a "strategy" executive.&lt;ref name=Miles2010 /&gt;

According to researchers Miles and Bennett, just knowing these common pitfalls can help a COO "heir" better prepare for the transition, thereby avoiding them in totality or ensuring that at least they do not evolve into full derailers once they are in the CEO seat.&lt;ref name=Miles2010 /&gt;

==Relationship with CEO==

Because the COO is often responsible for serving as an information conduit to the CEO, it is essential that the relationship between COO and CEO be a positive one.&lt;ref name=Bennett2008&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Trust is the most important ingredient necessary for a CEO-COO relationship to thrive. The CEO must have full confidence that the COO is not making direct passes for their job, can get the work done, and shares their vision (rather than using their trusted spot and access to information to undermine the CEO's strategy or implement his/her own vision). When a relationship built upon trust is created between the CEO and COO, firm performance is improved and shareholder results are strengthened. Seven strategies that are key to building trust in the CEO-COO relationship include:&lt;ref name=hbr2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Miles2006&gt;{{Citation

# Communication—The CEO has to be comfortable sharing information with the COO and regularly communicating the strategy and any changes to it. Similarly, the COO has to be comfortable regularly providing status updates to the CEO. When communication breaks down, mistrust or misunderstanding is likely to mess up.
# Clear Decision Rights—The COO role appears to work the best when the roles and responsibilities of the COO have been clearly delineated ahead of time and the COO is allowed to make the final decision within pre-agreed upon scope.
# Lock on the Backdoor—The CEO must not undermine the COO's credibility by continually reversing decisions. When employees learn that they can get a different answer by going directly to the CEO as opposed to the COO, the COO role quickly becomes impotent.
# Sharing the Spotlight—In effective CEO-COO relationships, both parties are comfortable with how much "credit" they receive for their work internally, externally, from the Board of Directors, and from each other.
# Fit between CEO &amp; COO—The two individuals must respect each other and effectively partner together. This is not a partnership that can be forced.
# Fit Between the COO &amp; the Position—The selected COO must have the right credentials to carry out the purpose for which the COO role was created (which can include everything from operations expertise to change expertise to having a complementary skill set to the CEO).
# Transparency of Succession Expectations and Timeline—Both parties must understand whether the COO desires the CEO job, whether the COO is in consideration for the top job, and what the timing might be for such a transition.

==Relationship with board of directors==
In addition to having a strong and trusting relationship with the CEO, the COO should also have an effective relationship with the board.&lt;ref name=Miles2007&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A good relationship between COO and the board allows the board to better understand and independently judge a potential successor. A strong relationship between the board and the COO also offers the board an additional expert opinion on the health of the company, and status of key initiatives. It benefits the CEO to allow such a relationship to form because it reflects confidence and fosters transparency. It also reinforces that the CEO is capable of developing talent, and helps the CEO to retain the COO by further empowering the individual. A strong relationship benefits the COOs in that they are able to expand their experience as well as their professional network. Additionally, if they are looking to be the next CEO, it allows them to develop credibility with the board. Researchers advise the COO to go beyond simply presenting at board meetings, to ensure they are developing strong one-on-one relationships with each board director.&lt;ref name=Miles2007 /&gt;  Researchers{{Who|date=May 2014}} also urge the COO to develop his or her own voice, independent of the CEO.

==Failure in the COO role==
Any breakdown in trust between the CEO and COO can lead to failure. Additionally, the COO typically has to be a high-level leader who is comfortable being fully in charge. Many executives with the leadership skills necessary to be a top-level COO would prefer to be running their own organization as opposed to taking orders from a CEO.  For COOs who are expecting to serve their time and be promoted to the top spot, their timelines for such a move can often be out of sync with the CEOs, causing a breakdown in the relationship. COOs can also find themselves trapped into being labeled an "operations" person or a "Number 2" as opposed to being seen as a strategic and top-level leader by the Board of Directors, which causes some executives to steer clear of the position.&lt;ref name=hbr2006 /&gt; Harry Levinson, Ph.D., effectively summarized the challenges of the COO position: "The relationship between the chief executive officer and the chief operating officer in any organization is fraught with many psychological complexities. Perhaps it is the most difficult of all organizational working relationships because more than others, it is a balancing act on the threshold of power."&lt;ref name=Levinson1993 /&gt;

==Experts and research==
Nathan Bennett and [[Stephen A. Miles]] have published extensively on the subject of the COO. In addition to writing a book dedicated to analyzing this hard-to-understand position,&lt;ref name=shotgun&gt;{{cite book|author1=Miles, Stephen A.|author2=Nathan Bennett|title=Riding shotgun: the role of the COO|publisher=Stanford Business Books|location=Stanford, Calif|year=2006|pages=|isbn=0-8047-5166-8|oclc=|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; their research has been published in the ''Harvard Business Review'', ''MIT Management Review'' and Chief Executive.net.&lt;ref name=hbr2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Miles2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Miles2007 /&gt; Their work focuses on identifying different types of COOs, when the role works to deliver additional value, and when the role fails to produce the desired results. Their research includes interviews with more than a hundred CEOs and COOs on the topic.

'''Clotilde Marie Brigitte Armand''' (born  28 June 1973) is a [[France|French]]-[[Romania]]n businesswoman and politician currently serving as [[councillor]] in [[Bucharest]]'s [[Sector 1]]. In the [[Romanian local elections, 2016]], she ran for Mayor of Bucharest's Sector 1 from [[Save Bucharest Union]] (SBU), losing to the Social Democratic candidate.

In 2002, she worked for [[Airbus]] in France and Germany, managing part of the [[Airbus A380|A380]]&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; project management team, being the head of 25 people.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 2005, she became the head of the Bucharest branch of gas distribution company [[GDF Suez]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Since September 2013, Armand has been heading the Romanian and Bulgarian branches of French engineering company [[Egis Group|Egis]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Armand was accused that she profited from the contract between the Romanian state and [[Bechtel Corporation]]; she responded that she became the director of the company only after the contract with Bechtel ended (in March 2013) and that Egis only verified the quality of the works of Bechtel, therefore, she argued, the company defended the interests of Romania.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.digi24.ro/Stiri/Digi24/Actualitate/Stiri/Clotilde+Armand+regreta+contractul+cu+Bechtel|title=Clotilde Armand regretă contractul cu Bechtel|website=[[Digi24]]|access-date=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also accused the Bechtel Corporation of treating Romania like a [[vassal]], the contract being "effectively a [[tribute]] paid in the virtue of a treaty of vassalage".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.evz.ro/clotilde-armand-arunca-bomba-contractul-bechtel-a-fost-un-fel-de-tribut-platit-in-virtutea-unui-tratat-de-vasalitate.html|title=CLOTILDE ARMAND aruncă BOMBA:|website=[[Evenimentul Zilei]]|language=ro-RO|access-date=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political activity ==
=== 2016 local elections ===
[[Nicușor Dan]], a political activist was a friend of Armand's husband, founded a new party called Save Bucharest Union.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Armand was chosen by the party to be their mayoral candidate for Bucharest's Sector 1 and began organizing her campaign only six weeks before the deadline.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Her campaign was based on anti-corruption and against politics as usual, arguing that "the political class has been separated from the true will of the people".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

She promised better management of public services,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/french-expat-eyes-mayor-s-post-in-bucharest-s-district-05-05-2016|title=Frenchwoman Runs for Mayor in Bucharest District :: Balkan Insight|website=[[Balkan Insight]]|access-date=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the [[urban design]] model of Paris (replacing the car-centered model with a [[public transport]] model) and building an [[esplanade]] surrounding the lakes in the northern part of the sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rfi.ro/politica-85956-clotilde-armand-candidata-franceza-care-vrea-sa-fie-primar-atuul-bucurestiului-sunt|title=Clotilde Armand, candidata franceză care vrea să fie primar: Atuul Bucureştiului sunt oamenii care vor să schimbe ceva|date=2016-04-01|website=RFI România|access-date=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although exit polls and early results indicated she was the winner, the final results showed that she lost to [[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|Social Democratic Party]]'s [[Dan Tudorache]], who received 23,220 votes (31,07%), while Armand received only 21,504 votes (28,77%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mediafax.ro/politic/rezultate-finale-alegeri-locale-2016-gabriela-firea-a-castigat-bucurestiul-cu-246-553-de-voturi-nicusor-dan-a-primit-175-119-voturi-15468301|title=REZULTATE FINALE ALEGERI LOCALE 2016: Gabriela Firea a câştigat Bucureştiul cu 246.553 de voturi.

Nicușor Dan, the president of SBU noted some statistical discrepancies: in the precincts where the party had observers, Armand won by a slim margin, whereas in the precincts where it did not have observers, Armand lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agerpres.ro/politica/2016/06/06/usb-depune-o-cerere-pentru-renumararea-voturilor-in-cinci-zece-sectii-din-sectorul-1-22-33-24|title=USB depune o cerere pentru renumărarea voturilor în cinci-zece secții din Sectorul 1 – AGERPRES|website=[[Agerpres]]|access-date=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the number of canceled votes was substantially higher in those precincts and there were discrepancies between the number of ballots given to each precinct and returned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.digi24.ro/Stiri/Digi24/Actualitate/Alegeri+locale+2016/Clotilde+Armand+publica+pe+Facebook+discrepantele+din+listele+pu|title=Clotilde Armand publică pe Facebook discrepanțele din listele publicate de BEC, semnalate de un susținător USB|website=[[Digi24]]|access-date=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; A member of the Electoral Bureau told the press that the reason of the discrepancies was that electoral precinct presidents were "idiots" who filled in wrongly the forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gandul.info/politica/bec-s-a-incurcat-in-excel-cum-s-au-ratacit-250-000-de-buletine-de-vot-sunt-tampiti-15453267|title=BEC s-a încurcat în Excel.

While not accusing anyone of vote fraud, Armand asked for a recount in 18 precincts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.digi24.ro/Stiri/Digi24/Actualitate/Politica/Clotilde+Armand+explica+de+ce+a+cerut+renumararea+voturilor+Din+|title=Clotilde Armand explică de ce a cerut renumărarea voturilor: Din respect pentru alegători|website=[[Digi24]]|access-date=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sector 1 Electoral Constituency Bureau refused the recount, arguing that the "lack of diligence" of her party (for not being represented in all precincts) was not the fault of the Electoral Bureau.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.digi24.ro/Stiri/Digi24/Actualitate/Alegeri+locale+2016/DOCUMENT+Motivele+pentru+care+a+fost+respinsa+cererea+USB+de+ren|title=DOCUMENT. Motivele pentru care a fost respinsă cererea USB de renumărare a voturilor|website=[[Digi24]]|access-date=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 500 supporters of Armand organized a protest in [[University Square, Bucharest|University Square]], demanding a recount.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mediafax.ro/politic/reportaj-protest-pentru-clotilde-armand-suntem-aici-pentru-democratie-pentru-transparenta-este-o-lupta-pe-care-o-avem-in-comun-gabriel-liiceanu-ideea-ca-se-aleg-ei-intre-ei-folosindu-ne-intolerabila-15471564|title=REPORTAJ - Protest pentru Clotilde Armand: Suntem aici pentru democraţie, pentru transparenţă.

Armand had also sent an objection of unconstitutionality, arguing that the [[plurality voting system]] is flawed because in her the mayor was elected by only 10% of the constituents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.digi24.ro/Stiri/Digi24/Actualitate/Politica/Clotilde+Armand+a+depus+o+contestatie+la+Biroul+Electoral+al+Sec|title=Clotilde Armand a depus o contestație la Biroul Electoral al Sectorului 1|website=[[Digi24]]|access-date=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The objection has been accepted and forwarded to the [[Constitutional Court of Romania|Constitutional Court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-politic-21080702-contestatia-lui-clotilde-armand-privind-alegerea-primarilor-intr-tur-ajunge-ccr.htm|title=Contestatia lui Clotilde Armand privind alegerea primarilor intr-un tur va ajunge la CCR|website=[[HotNews]]|access-date=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was on both the Save Bucharest Union's lists for the Bucharest and Sector 1 councillors and, after the elections, she chose to be a Sector 1 councillor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.digi24.ro/Stiri/Digi24/Actualitate/Politica/Clotilde+Armand+a+ales+sa+fie+consilier+in+Sectorul+1+in+detrime|title=Clotilde Armand a ales să fie consilier în Sectorul 1 în detrimentul Consiliului General|website=[[Digi24]]|access-date=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political positions ==
Clotilde Armand argues that Romania needs a change of the political class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gandul.info/eu-primar/clotilde-armand-ce-ma-deranjeaza-la-romani-e-resemnarea-trebuie-sa-se-implice-sa-schimbe-lucrurile-15330781|title=Clotilde Armand: „Ce mă deranjează la români e resemnarea. Trebuie să se implice, să schimbe lucrurile”|website=[[Gândul]]|language=ro-RO|access-date=2016-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote an [[open letter]] to President [[Klaus Iohannis]] in which she asked the two main parties of Romania (the Social Democratic Party and the [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal Party]], both of which have roots in the [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|National Salvation Front]]) to apologize for their involvement in the [[June 1990 Mineriad]] and to remove former president [[Ion Iliescu]] and former Prime Minister [[Petre Roman]] from public life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://adevarul.ro/news/politica/clotilde-armand-scrisoare-deschisa-iohannis-cereti-public-pnl-psd-sa-si-ceara-scuze-mineriada-sa-i-scoata-viata-publica-iliescu-roman-1_5761078c5ab6550cb8f7040e/index.html|title=Clotilde Armand, scrisoare deschisă către Iohannis: Cereţi public PNL şi PSD să-şi ceară scuze pentru Mineriadă. Să-i scoată din viaţa publică pe Iliescu şi Roman|website=[[Adevărul]]|access-date=2016-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Armand says she does not believe in the [[left–right politics]] paradigm, arguing that, in Romania, the money wasted due to corruption is far higher than the differences between standard left and right policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-politic-21073961-cine-este-cum-gandeste-ambitii-politice-are-clotilde-armand-dupa-candidatura-primarie-vad-lider-partid-nu-stiu-obiectivul-meu-este-pun-dispozitia-romanilor-competentele-mele.htm|title=VIDEO Cine este, cum gandeste si ce ambitii politice are Clotilde Armand dupa candidatura la primarie: Da, ma vad lider de partid, nu stiu/ Obiectivul meu este sa pun la dispozitia romanilor competentele mele|website=[[HotNews]]|access-date=2016-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, she considers herself, within the French political context, a person that is naturally right-wing, but that Romania currently has many people who need the help of the state and that these people, who did not adapt to the changes and are no longer useful to society, should be re-integrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-alegeri_locale_2016_bucuresti-20960118-video-interviu-armand-clotilde-candidat-usb-primaria-sector-1-sunt-dreapta-dar-este-realitate-romania-sunt-oameni-care-nevoie-ajutorul-statului-politica-dam-locuinta-sociala.htm|title=VIDEO-INTERVIU Armand Clotilde, candidat USB la Primaria sector 1: Sunt de dreapta, dar este o realitate ca in Romania sunt oameni care au nevoie de ajutorul statului.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2360">A '''custom online panel''' or Internet '''access panel''' is a group of pre-screened respondents who have expressed a willingness to participate in [[Paid survey|survey]]s and/or [[customer feedback]] sessions. The custom online panel is also known as a customer advisory panel, proprietary panel or an online research panel. Respondents become "panelists" by completing a [[Demographic profile|profiling]] [[questionnaire]]. The data collected includes [[demographics]], [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] characteristics and media habits, which provides a basis for future survey participation.

== Form and process ==
A panel can range in size from 100 to 100,000 or more people. Larger panels can enable surveys of smaller target groups. Panel quality is not determined solely by size, however, and how panel members have been sourced is also important.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=26 Questions to Help Research Buyers of Online Samples|url=http://www.esomar.org/uploads/public/knowledge-and-standards/codes-and-guidelines/ESOMAR_26-Questions-To-Help-Research-Buyers-Of-Online-Samples.pdf|publisher=ESOMAR|accessdate=19 September 2013|page=2|format=PDF|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Panels can provide a dedicated group that market researchers can engage with and learn from over time. At a moment’s notice researchers can investigate the [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], [[behaviour]] and [[opinion]]s of existing or potential customers using interactive surveys, discussion forums and 3D retail environments. Plus, results are available instantly and responses can be tracked over time.

Panels are a growing phenomenon in the [[market research]] industry. They bridge the gap between a population that is reluctant to cooperate with telephone surveys and the organizations that need to know their perceptions and attitudes more than ever before.

A specialized form of online panels typically known as [[Expert network|Expert Networks]] are used by investment funds and consulting firms to collect information as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5246">'''Denver Technological Center''', better known as '''The Denver Tech Center''' or '''DTC''', is a [[business]] and economic trading center located in [[Colorado]] in the southeastern portion of the [[Denver Metropolitan Area]], within portions of the cities of [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] and [[Greenwood Village, Colorado|Greenwood Village]]. It is home to several major businesses and corporations. The DTC roughly corresponds to the area surrounding the [[Interstate 25 (Colorado)|I-25]] corridor between [[Interstate 225 (Colorado)|I-225]] and [[SH 88 (CO)|SH 88]] (Arapahoe Road).

==History==
[[File:DenverTechCenter.jpg|thumb|upright=2.4|alt=DTC skyline from the north at sunset|Skyline of the Denver Tech Center.]]
The DTC was established in the early 1970s.  Cable companies United Cablevision, United Artists Cable, and later [[AT&amp;T Broadband]], all had their start in - and still have major infrastructure around - the Denver Tech Center. In the Colorado area, [[Bill Daniels]] and [[John C. Malone]] were early adopters who shepherded many standards in cable technology still used today.

The Denver Tech Center was designed by architect/planner Carl A. Worthington.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl A. Worthington and Associates]], http://www.carlworthingtonassociates.com&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early 1970s, investors asked Worthington to complete a conceptual master plan along a new fiber optic line south of [[downtown Denver]].  The master plan started with forty acres, with potential for an additional 800 acres.  The plan has since grown to 850 acres, and over 25 million square feet of buildings have been completed.
The area's progress was a major reason for [[Denver Regional Council of Governments]]'s hi [[Colorado T-REX Project (TRansportation EXpansion)|T-REX expansion]] into the Denver Tech Center, which built new [[light rail]] lines connecting the Denver Tech Center to downtown Denver.&lt;ref&gt;Transportation Expansion (T-REX) Multi-Modal Transportation Project- [[Federal Highway Administration]]-T-REX, http://www.environment.fhwa.dot.gov/strmlng/casestudies/co.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute was listed as one of the leading executive education programs by [[Chief Executive (magazine)|Chief Executive Magazine]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://chiefexecutive.net/2013-leading-executive-education-programs/|title=2013 Leading Executive Education Programs|work=ChiefExecutive.net|access-date=2017-12-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also ranked as one of the top five programs for [[Organization development|Organizational Development]] by [[HR.com]]'s Leadership Excellence And Development (LEAD) in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.leadershipexcellenceanddevelopment.com/content/lead2016-leadership-excellence-award-winners|title=LEAD2016 Leadership Excellence Award Winners|last=design|date=2015-12-22|work=Leadership Excellence and Development Conference|access-date=2017-12-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Jim Liautaud co-founded the Institute in 2006.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Working with [[Neuroscientist|neuroscientists]], [[Psychologist|psychologists]], [[Chief executive officer|CEOs]] and researchers, Liautaud and his colleagues created a training program to quickly build successful intra-company teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.liblog.net/single-post/2016/05/12/Benefits-of-ISO-and-Standardization-in-Training|title=Emotional Intelligence and Leadership Blog|website=Emotional Intelligence and Leadership Blog|access-date=2017-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the Institute started to catalog the best social habits from high-performing managers. They broke down each practice into a sequence of steps and standardized them so that they could be certified, similar to the way the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) certifies the quality of goods and services.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Approach==
The EI Leadership Institute uses an approach called PDT (process-designed teams), applying the principles of [[Nobel Prize]]-winning economist [[Elinor Ostrom|Dr. Elinor Ostrom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/3607915/should-teams-manage-themselves/|title=Should Teams Manage Themselves?|website=Time|access-date=2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their leadership forum program has shown a 23% increase in [[Emotional intelligence]] for participating executives over a two-year period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.inc.com/raman-chadha/emotional-intelligence-critical-for-leaders-to-make-impact.html|title=Emotional Intelligence Is Critical for Leaders to Make an Impact|last=|first=|date=2013-10-04|work=Inc.com|access-date=2017-12-28|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.inc.com/chuck-blakeman/the-rugged-individualist-is-dead-it-s-about-time.html|title=The Rugged Individualist Is Dead|last=|first=|date=2015-03-03|work=Inc.com|access-date=2017-12-28|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
The Institute was ranked as one of the top five programs for Organizational Development by [[HR.com]]'s Leadership Excellence And Development (LEAD) in 2016.

The '''Economic History Association''' ('''EHA''') was founded in 1940 to "encourage and promote teaching, research, and publication on every phase of [[economic history]] and to help preserve and administer materials for research in economic history". It publishes ''[[The Journal of Economic History]]'' with  the [[Cambridge University Press]], holds an annual meeting that usually takes place in September, and awards prizes and grants.&lt;ref name="jstor"&gt;{{cite web|title=Publisher Description: Economic History Association|url=https://www.jstor.org/publisher/eha|website=[[JSTOR]]|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also the home to the ''EH.Net Encyclopedia of Economic and Business History''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Encyclopedia |url=http://eh.net/encyclopedia-2/ |work=EH.Net Encyclopedia of Economic and Business History |access-date=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Membership ==
There are more than 1,000 EHA members worldwide,&lt;ref name="jstor"/&gt; and composed of faculty and graduate students from universities around the world, as well as economists in the private sector and in government.

Michael Haupert of the [[University of Wisconsin-La Crosse]] is the Executive Director, and [[Cormac Ó Gráda]] is the President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Economic History Association|url=https://eh.net/eha/about/|website=Economic History Association|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous EHA Presidents include Oxford's [[Robert C. Allen]], Vanderbilt's [[Jeremy Atack]], UC Berkeley's [[Barry Eichengreen]], Yale's [[Naomi Lamoreaux]], as well as [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Economics Nobel Laureates]] [[Robert Fogel]] and [[Douglass North]].

== Prizes and grants ==
The Economic History Association supports research through [[Arthur H. Cole]] grants-in-aid and awards prizes for publications, dissertations, and teaching, as well as fellowships and grants for students of economic history.

It awards several prizes for publications:&lt;ref name="prizes"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prizes|url=http://eh.net/eha/prizes/|website=Economic History Association|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The society also provides grants to support the early stages of dissertation work in economic history and fellowships to support students finishing their dissertations on the topic. Two [[Kenneth Sokoloff]] fellowships are awarded by the EHA each year to students finishing their dissertations in economic history.

== Annual conferences ==
For many years EHA has partnered with the [[American Economic Association]] to arrange sessions at the annual [[Allied Social Sciences Association|ASSA]] conference.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eh.net/content/call-papers-eha-sessions-2014-assa Call for papers for EHA sessions at 2014 ASSA]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2018 annual EHA meeting will take place in [[Montreal]], [[Canada]], in September 2018; its theme is "‘From Plague, Famine, and War, Save us, O Lord’ Shocks and Disasters in Economic History".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date = 25 October 2017 |title=Economic History Association 2018 Annual Meeting|url=http://eh.net/eha/economic-history-association-2018-annual-meeting/|website=Economic History Association|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6651">'''Covalence EthicalQuote'''  also called '''EthicalQuote''' or simply '''CEQ''' is a market [[index (economics)|index]] tracking reputation of the world’s largest companies on Environmental, Social, Governance (ESG), [[Corporate social responsibility|Corporate]]  dimensions of firms’ ethical performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Baringhorst | first = Sigrid |author2=Veronica Kneip | title = Politik mit dem Einkaufswagen: Unternehmen und Konsumenten als Bürger in der globalen Mediengesellschaft | publisher = Die Deutsche Bibliothek | year = 2007 | location = Rockenhaus, Bielfeld | page = 297 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=OoWkk0chmYMC&amp;pg=PA297&amp;lpg=PA297&amp;dq=antoine+mach+ethical+quote#v=onepage&amp;q=antoine%20mach%20ethical%20quote&amp;f=false| isbn = 3899426487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and Present==

In 2001, Covalence SA was founded by six shareholders including Ngenda Kigaraba, Antoine Mach, Marc Rochat, Jean-Felix Savary and Steven Street. Covalence is a private, for profit company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Covalence|first=SA|title=Covalence History 2001-2007|url= http://www.ethicalquote.com/docs/CovalenceHistory.pdf |publisher=[[Covalence SA]]|date=2007|format=PDF|accessdate=March 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Covalence “Best EthicalQuote Score” established the amount of published positive minus negative news since 2002. The methodology for calculating its EthicalQuote score and rankings was revised in 2009 making comparison to previous years’ data not possible. This illustrates one of the challenges facing the assessment of social responsibility: how the concept of CSR is operationalised and measured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=TCs-domq3GAC&amp;pg=PA80&amp;lpg=PA80&amp;dq=covalence+index|title=Case Studies in Organizational Communication: Ethical Perspectives and Practices|last=May|first=Steve|date=2012-01-20|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=1483332756|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Covalence publishes regularly in Le Temps&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.letemps.ch/economie/2016/09/19/objectifs-developpement-durables-une-chance-entreprises-suisses|title=Les Objectifs de développement durables sont une chance pour les entreprises suisses|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a monthly comment on the BBGI-EthicalQuote Swiss Equities Indices in l’Agefi.[http://www.agefi.fr/]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agefi.fr/|title=Actualité financière et économique - Information finance avec l'AGEFI|website=L'AGEFI|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Covalence EthicalQuote is one of the founding members of [[Swiss Sustainable Finance]] (SFF), a partnership with the [[Federal Department of Economic Affairs, Education and Research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.sustainablefinance.ch/upload/cms/user/Swiss_Sustainable_Finance_Press_Release_2014_07_01_final.pdf | title=The new platform "Swiss Sustainable Finance" promotes sustainability in the Swiss financial centre (press release)|publisher=Swiss Sustainable Finance|date=July 1, 2014|accessdate=July 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and Assessment==

CEQ accounts for cultural diversity, political pluralism and scientific uncertainty. It aggregates thousands of documents extracted from diverse sources and classified according to 50 sustainability criteria inspired by the Global Reporting Initiative. The extra-financial ratings are used by indexes of sustainable Swiss equities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bendell | first = Jem |author2=Ian Doyle | title = Healing Capitalism: Five years in the life of Business, Finance and Corporate Responsibility| publisher = Greenleaf Publishing | year = March 2014 | location = Sheffield S3 8GG, UK | page = 297 | url = http://www.greenleaf-publishing.com/add_getquantity.kmod?productid=3799| isbn = 9783899426489}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 Covalence partnered with [[Thomson Reuters]] and [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] distributing EthicalQuote through their platforms.

Research sponsored by the [[Journal of Business Ethics]] states there is an equity valuation effect of press releases of upgrades or downgrades reflected in the CEQ . The research encompasses a joint test of the value relevance of the index and the impact of ethical reputation on a firm’s value. A significant causal relationship is identified between stock market reactions and the changes in the CEQ. Particularly, disclosures of positive and negative changes in firm ethical performance cause increases or decreases in firm value.

A desire to look at industries that have "a heavy impact on culture and the way people think” inspired a collaboration in reporting by Covalence SA, [[Ethical Investment Research Services|Ethical Investment Research Service]] (EIRIS) and the WWF. The initiave is not to " criticise these companies but to make a general point: responsible business practices can be a value driver, but they need to be systematically embedded in the DNA of a company, .... Comparison can be a powerful motivation to change.” said Mr Kleanthous (a senior policy adviser at WWF).&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ed3ab118-9e1e-11dc-9f68-0000779fd2ac.html#axzz3izKQzqsT=1 Luxury brands fail to make ethical grade]", ''[[Financial Times]]'', Retrieved November 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''frost line''' is a term used in [[plastic]] [[film]] manufacturing by [[extrusion]]. It refers to the point beyond the [[die (manufacturing)|die]] where the temperature of the molten plastic falls below the softening point and the diameter of the extruded plastic bubble stabilizes. The term was borrowed from the notion of "[[frost line]]" in [[soil science]] and refers to the frosted appearance of the plastic film above the "frost line".

The distance from the die is called the height of the frost line. It depends on various factors, including the melt temperature, the speed of cooling, the extrusion speed, and the diameter of the bubble. The notion is important, since the higher the frost line, the more difficult to control the uniformity of the film thickness.

For example, a higher frost line due to higher melt temperature and/or lower cooling rate means a longer time to solidify, and a more smooth and transparent film is produced.

'''Gaël Duval''' (born 1973) is a French entrepreneur. In July 1998, he created Mandrake Linux (now [[Mandriva Linux]]), a [[Linux distribution]] originally based on [[Red Hat Linux]] and [[KDE]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=CUcbyVTztecC&amp;pg=PA309&amp;dq=isbn:0738206709+mandrake&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiK1uDe2LrSAhXDuRoKHTfBCr0Q6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=isbn:0738206709%20mandrake&amp;f=false|title=Rebel Code: Linux and the Open Source Revolution|last=Moody|first=Glyn|date=2002-01-01|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=0738206709|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a co-founder of MandrakeSoft (now merged in [[Mandriva]]) with Jacques Le Marois and Frédéric Bastok.

Gaël Duval was responsible for communication in the Mandriva management team until he was laid off by the company in March 2006, in a round of cost-cutting. Duval suspected part of the reason for his dismissal was disagreement with management over the company's future strategy, resulting in a lawsuit against the company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indidea.org/gael/en/fired-message.php La page perso de Gaël Duval, créateur de Mandrake Linux/Mandriva Linux, co-fondateur de Mandrakesoft/Mandriva - FAQ Mandriva&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222034630/http://www.indidea.org/gael/en/fired-message.php |date=2007-12-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://club.mandriva.com/xwiki/bin/Main/interview-fbancilhon-2006-03 Interview of François Bancilhon, CEO of Mandriva&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071220045625/http://club.mandriva.com/xwiki/bin/Main/interview-fbancilhon-2006-03 |date=2007-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2006}}, Duval is Chairman and Chief Technology Officer at [[Ulteo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com/8301-10784_3-9832336-7.html?tag=newsmap Ulteo brings OpenOffice to Web browser | Tech news blog - CNET News.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The company is bought by AZNetwork group in 2015.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Since 2011, Center for Government Competitiveness (CGC) at [[Seoul National University]] has developed the Government Competitiveness (GC) index which evaluates government achievements in the various fields and furthermore provides policy recommendations to increase competitiveness of government in the future.

== Description ==
'''Government competitiveness''' ('''GC''') is often confounded with similar [[concepts]]. One of the prominent examples is national competitiveness. A variety of institutions have developed indices measuring the level of national competitiveness. Two indices, the World Competitiveness Scoreboard (WCS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imd.org/wcc/wcy-world-competitiveness-yearbook/|title=World Competitiveness Scoreboard|date= 2014|accessdate=March 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed by the [[International Institute for Management Development]] (IMD)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imd.org/|title=International Institute for Management Development|date= 2014|accessdate=March 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Global Competitiveness Report|the Global Competitiveness Index]] (GCI)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reports.weforum.org/global-competitiveness-report-2014-2015/|title=Global Competitiveness Report 2014 and 2015|date= 2014|accessdate=March 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  built by the [[World Economic Forum]] (WEF)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weforum.org/|title=World Economic Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt;  have come to dominate the field of competitiveness studies.

The [[International Institute for Management Development]] [[International Institute for Management Development#MD World Competitiveness Center (WCC)|WCS]] and the [[World Economic Forum]] [[Global Competitiveness Index|the Global Competitiveness Index]] view national competitiveness akin to how business-friendly a nation is, and focus upon economic and market indicators. As such, if a nation is a good place for foreign firms to do business and make money, it will, as a result, be viewed as competitive. Following this logic, the role played by a government then, is mainly restricted to constructing an environment that is attractive to businesses.&lt;ref&gt;For the general assessment on the two indices, see Ochel, W &amp; Rohn, O. (2006). Ranking of countries – the WEF, IMD, Fraser and Heritage Indices. CESifo DICE Report Vol. 4 no. 2. pp. 48-60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stressing the broader fields of government activities, several institutions have started to develop indicators emphasizing the role of government in driving development and national competitiveness. Prominent examples include [[Worldwide Governance Indicators|The World Bank’s Worldwide Governance Indicators]] (WGI)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/index.aspx#home|title=World Bank's Worldwide Governance Indicator}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Quality of Government Institute|the Quality of Government Institute’s]] (QGI) (the University of Gothenburg) Quality of Government indicators(QoG).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qog.pol.gu.se/|title=Quality of Government indicators}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While these two indices constitute important steps toward improving our understanding of how government contributes toward competitiveness, they have also revealed numerous theoretical and methodological shortcomings related to the study of governments’ role in fostering national competitiveness.&lt;ref&gt;(2007){{cite web|url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/wbk/wbrwps/4149.htm/|title=The Worldwide Governance Indicators Project: Answering the Critics. World Bank Policy Research Working Paper 4149}} For the critics on the WGI and its responses, see Kaufmann, D, Kraay, A, &amp; Mastruzzi, M.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2011, Center for Government Competitiveness (director: [[Tobin Im]]) has developed the GC index mainly focusing on government capacities and roles in national development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gccenter.net|title=Government Competitiveness Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After investigating the limited capabilities of existing competitiveness indicators to define and measure the level of GC, the CGC has tried to develop a novel approach to conceptualizing and measuring GC.&lt;ref&gt;Im, T. (2014). Government Competitiveness 2013. Seoul: CM Press (in Korean); Im, T., Kim, S., Ko, G., &amp; Jo, W. (2014). Government Competitiveness: Theory and Evaluation Index. Seoul: Bakyoungsa (In Korean).&lt;/ref&gt;   According to Ho and Im (2012), the concept of GC can be defined as “the power of government to, in light of various constraints, take resources from in and outside of the country and improve social, economic and cultural conditions of the nation in order to sustainably enhance citizens’ quality of life.”  Moreover, the concepts of ‘constraints’ and ‘quality of life’&lt;ref&gt;Ho, A., &amp; Im, T. (2012). Defining a new concept of government competitiveness. The Korean Journal of Public Administration, 50 (3), p. 13 (In Korean).&lt;/ref&gt; can be interpreted in various ways, depending on a nation's unique environments.

By considering different experiences and policy practices between developed countries and developing countries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arp.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/09/16/0275074013501856.full.pdf+html|title=Ho, A. &amp; Im, T. (2013). Challenges in Building Effective and Competitive Government in Developing Countries: An Institutional Logics Perspective, The American Review of Public Administration, first published online.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the CGC measures the level of government competitiveness by applying different criteria to OECD and non-OECD countries. The seven fields of government activities both OECD and non-OECD countries have in common are followings: economy, education, health and welfare, agriculture and food, ICT, energy and environment, and governance. For OECD countries, three more fields are added: research and development, culture and tourism, and disaster management. Meanwhile, non-OECD countries have nine fields of government activities in total including infrastructure and safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gccenter.net|title=Government Competitiveness Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CGC builds the GC index based on David Easton's system theory as a theoretical framework.&lt;ref&gt;Easton, D. (1953). The Political System: An Inquiry into the State of Political Science. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, the GC Index first analyzes competitiveness through each of the four levels- input, throughput (public management capacity), output, and outcome. The index then aggregates results from each level to produce an overall competitiveness score. This approach generates a variety of policy implications at each systemic level. The following are some sub-categories for each stage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gccenter.net/data/ranking/Government%20Competitiveness%20Report_2016pdf.pdf|title= Center for Government Competitiveness.

At first, Kanai was a general stamp collector&lt;ref name="classic mauritius"/&gt; but after World War II he specialised in the philately of [[Postage stamps and postal history of Japan|Japan]], [[Postage stamps and postal history of Finland|Finland]] and the British colonies.&lt;ref name="classic mauritius"/&gt;&lt;ref name="paul fraser"&gt;{{cite web |last=Fraser |first=Paul |title=The Collections of Hiroyuki Kanai |publisher=Paul Fraser Collectables |date=24 March 2010 |url=https://www.justcollecting.com/miscellania/the-collections-of-hiroyuki-kanai-1000506668 |accessdate=1 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through philatelic contacts he became aware of and eventually owned a unique collection of the [[Mauritius "Post Office" stamps|Red and Blue Mauritius "Post Office" stamps]], when he procured a total of six pieces of 27 known copies of this valuable stamps, which was the largest ever owned by one person. In 1971, he bought the ''Bordeaux Letter,'' a [[Cover (philately)|cover]] with both the one penny red and two penny blue stamps addressed to Bordeaux, for 120 million yen. At that time this was about 1&amp;nbsp;million US dollars, which would possibly equal about 6&amp;nbsp;million US dollars today.

The '''Hungarian Industrial and Commercial Bank''' (Hungarian: '''Magyar Ipar-és Kereskedelmi Bank''') was an important Hungarian bank in the late 19th and early 20th century.

It was a mediocre bank until the appointment of [[István Tisza]] - a prominent businessman and politician - as its president. Under his direction, it became the largest bank of Hungary within a decade.

The phrase '''innovation game''' refers to a form of [[primary research|primary market research]] developed by Luke Hohmann where customers play a set of directed games as a means of generating feedback about a product or service.  The research is primary because the data collected is gathered directly from customers or prospects and is intended to answer a specific research question.  ([[Secondary research]] is data collected previously by others, usually through primary research, that may or may not address a specific research question.)  “Customers” who play innovation games are commonly direct recipients or consumers of a specific product or service.  In some cases, though, game players may be any person or system who is or would be affected by a product or service.

Innovation games are directed by a facilitator whose responsibilities include:
* explaining the game(s) to be played;
* controlling the pacing and tempo of each game;
* monitoring participation levels; and,
* managing time of the overall game-play event.

The successful operation of an innovation game relies on collaborative play among the participants and a set of observers drawn from disparate functional groups within an organization.  For example, a typical game setting for a word processing software might include participants drawn from two or three corporate customers along with observers comprising the product’s quality assurance manager, technical architect, product manager, developer, sales executive, or any one else on the product team.  Arguably, the most important observer is the product manager because that person is responsible for acting on the data generated by the game.  However, a single observer cannot possible capture all of the nonverbal and nuanced communication that players exhibit, so all observers play a significant and irreplaceable role in the effective utility of the game.

==A description==
There are at least 12 unique innovation games (and any number of new games derived by combining elements of these 12 games).&lt;ref name=IG&gt;See [http://www.innovationgames.com/ Luke Hohmann, ''Innovation Games: Creating Breakthrough Products through Collaborative Play'' (Boston: Addison-Wesley, 2007), 47-124.]&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''20/20 Vision''': Several potential product features appear on a shuffled set of note cards, one feature per card.  The facilitator tapes the first card face-out onto the wall and displays each of the remaining cards one at a time to the participants, asking if the feature on the card is more or less important than the feature on the wall.  No two features are allowed to be of equal importance.
* '''Buy a Feature''': Participants see a list of proposed product features and a cost (expressed as development effort or street-level pricing) associated with each.  Each participant "buys" a desirable feature; participants may also pool resources to buy features too expensive to be purchased with individual funds.
* '''Give Them a Hot Tub''': Several potential product features appear on a shuffled set of note cards, one feature per card.  Some of the proposed features are completely outrageous, such as a [[Will It Blend?|"crush rocks" setting for a new food blender]].  Observers note what happens when a customer uncovers one of these outrageous features.
* '''Me and My Shadow''': Observers carefully record a participant using a product or service.  Observers sit next to the participant to watch for and listen to actions, expressions, comments, and suggestions.  Observers ask questions of the participant, such as "Why are you doing that," or "what are you thinking at this moment".
* '''Product Box''': Participants imagine that they're selling a vendor's product at a tradeshow, retail outlet, or public market.  Participants use plain cardboard boxes, glue, paint, crayons, and other scraps and knickknacks to design a product box that they would buy.
* '''Prune the Product Tree''':  A very large tree (representing a system or product) is drawn on a whiteboard.  Thick limbs represent major areas of functionality within the system.  The edge of the tree—its outermost branches—represent the features available in the current release of the product.  Participants write new features on several index cards that are shaped like leaves, and then they place these feature-leaves onto the tree, revealing which branches (product features) are important to customers for future improvements.
* '''Remember the Future''': Participants imagine a time in the future when they will have been using the product almost continuously between now and then.  ("Future" may be expressed in months, years, or some other time frame.)  Participants then write down exactly what the product will have done to make them happy, successful, rich, safe, secure, etc.
* '''Show and Tell''': Participants bring in examples of artifacts created or modified by the product or service.  Participants explain why these artifacts are important, and how and when they are used.
* '''Speed Boat''': A drawing of a boat appears on a white board or sheet of butcher paper.  Anchors "attached" to the boat prevent it from moving quickly through the water.  The boat represents a product or system, and the anchors are features that the participants don't like.  The lower the anchor, the more debilitating the feature.
* '''Spider Web''': A product name appears at the center of a circle drawn in the middle of a whiteboard.  Participants draw other products and services, explaining how, when, and why they are used.  Participants then draw lines that link these additional services to each other and to the product's circle.
* '''Start Your Day''': Participants describe their daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly events related to their use of a product.  Descriptions are written on pre-printed, poster-sized calendars or timelines taped to the walls.  Participants include events with time frames that match the product's expected lifecycle or release cycle.  Participants may also include one-time events (particularly horrible days where everything goes wrong) and describe how the product helps or hinders as the event unfolds.
* '''The Apprentice''': An engineer or product developer uses the product as an end-user.  For example, if the system is used for data entry, the developer enters data for a couple of days.  Observers record the engineer's actions, expressions, comments, and suggestions.

==Selecting an appropriate game==
While any number or variety of innovation games may be invented, combined, or adapted from other game environments, all such games have strengths and weaknesses that constrain their applicability to specific kinds of problems.  These strengths and weaknesses are expressed as six separate dimensions:
# the degree of '''open-ended exploration''': how much or how little the participants are constrained in their interactions
# the degree of '''scalability''': the number of customers who can play the game at any one time
# the degree of '''physical preparation''': what kinds of supplies or materials are necessary to play the game
# the degree of '''market preparation''': how much background effort is necessary to provide data or content for the game
# the degree of '''customer preparation''': what pre-game activities, if any, to require of the participants before entering the game environment
# the '''time frame of action''': how long after the game completes before the participant expects a product’s improvement to reflect the game’s results

The '''International Association of Insurance Supervisors''' ('''IAIS''') is a voluntary membership-driven [[standards organization|standards-setting]] organization of insurance supervisors and regulators from over 190 jurisdictions in more than 140 countries. Founded in 1994, it seeks to "supervise the insurance industry in order to develop and maintain fair, safe, and stable insurance markets".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Association Of Insurance Supervisors|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/profiles/companies/0850031D:SW-international-association-of-insurance-supervisors|website=Bloomberg|accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to its members, approximately 135 observers representing international institutions, professional associations and insurance and reinsurance companies, as well as consultants and other professionals participate in IAIS activities. 

==Structure==
The IAIS is a nonprofit organisation formed under Article 60 of the Swiss Civil Code, domiciled in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]]. Its activities are supported by its secretariat and headed by a secretary general. The IAIS is hosted by the [[Bank for International Settlements]] (BIS).

===Committees===
Under the direction of its Members, the IAIS conducts activities through a Committee system designed to achieve its mandate and objectives.
The IAIS Committee system is led by an Executive Committee whose members come from different regions of the world. It is supported by five Committees established by the By-Laws – the Audit, Budget, Financial Stability, Implementation, and Technical Committees – as well as by the Supervisory Forum. Committees may establish subcommittees or working parties to help carry out their duties.

==Activities==
Activities undertaken in furtherance of its mission can be divided into three categories:
# '''Standard setting:''' The IAIS develops supervisory material (principles, standards and guidance) for effective supervision of insurance-related activities. The IAIS also prepares supporting papers that provide background on specific areas of interest to insurance supervisors.
# '''Implementation:''' The IAIS actively promotes the implementation of its supervisory material. Working closely with international organisations, regional groups and supervisors, it supports training seminars and conferences and addresses financial inclusion. In addition, the IAIS conducts assessments and peer reviews of observance of supervisory material, consistent with the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) conducted by the IMF and the World Bank.
# '''Financial stability:''' The IAIS plays a central role in financial stability issues, including developing a methodology for the identification of any global [[Systemically important financial institution|systemically important insurers]] (G-SIIs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gary Hirst|year=2013|title=The International Association of Insurance Supervisors and Insurers that are Too Big to Fail|publisher=The Gary Hirst Insurance Blog|url=http://garyhirst.com/by-gary-hirst-the-international-association-of-insurance-supervisors-and-insurers-that-are-too-big-to-fail/|accessdate=2013-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It assists its Members in developing enhanced macroprudential surveillance tools.

===Global coordination===
The IAIS coordinates its work with other international financial policymakers and associations of supervisors or regulators, and assists in shaping financial systems globally. In particular, the IAIS is a:
* Member of the [[Financial Stability Board]] (FSB)
* Founding member and co-parent of the [[Joint Forum]], along with the [[Basel Committee on Banking Supervision]] (BCBS) and the [[International Organization of Securities Commissions]] (IOSCO)
* Member of the Standards Advisory Council of the [[International Accounting Standards Board]] (IASB)
* Partner in the Access to Insurance Initiative (A2ii)

The IAIS also participates as an observer or partner with numerous other organisations, including the Arab Forum of Insurance Regulatory Commissions (AFIRC), Asian Forum of Insurance Regulators (AFIR), Association of Latin American Insurance Supervisors (ASSAL), Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP), European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), Financial Action Task Force (FATF), International Actuarial Association (IAA), International Organisation of Pension Supervisors (IOPS), Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB), National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), Offshore Group of Insurance Supervisors (OGIS), Insurance and Private Pensions Committee (IPPC), [[OECD]], [[IMF]], and the World Bank.

===Global involvement===
The IAIS holds Committee meetings four times a year, as well as Working Party meetings as needed, throughout the world. At its June meetings, the IAIS hosts a Global Seminar affording insurance supervisors and industry representatives a unique opportunity to discuss current and globally significant matters impacting the insurance sector, as well as to learn about new international standards.

To further encourage multilateral discussions on topical issues for insurance supervisors and other insurance professionals, the IAIS holds an Annual Conference. In conjunction with this conference, it convenes an Annual General Meeting of Members where it conducts official business. 

==Publications==

The Global Insurance Market Report (GIMAR) collects and reports data reflecting the performance of primary insurers and reinsurers as well as key developments in the global insurance market. It builds on the previously issued Global Reinsurance Market Report, which has been incorporated as an integral part of the GIMAR. Publication of the GIMAR by the IAIS Secretariat began in October 2012. The GIMAR is based on publicly available data as well as confidential data submitted to the IAIS by about 50 reinsurance companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Insurance Market Report (GIMAR) Global Insurance Market Report (GIMAR)|url=https://www.iaisweb.org/page/supervisory-material/financial-stability-and-macroprudential-policy-and-surveillance/global-insurance-market-report-gimar|website=International Association of Insurance Supervisors|accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IAIS publishes a monthly newsletter outlining recent and upcoming activities.

'''Joseph Coymans''' (1591 &amp;ndash; 1670s), was a Dutch businessman in [[Haarlem]], known best today for his portrait painted by [[Frans Hals]], and its pendant, ''[[Portrait of Dorothea Berck]]''. The former resides at the [[Wadsworth Atheneum]] in Hartford, the latter at the [[Baltimore Museum of Art]]. A portrait of the couple's son Willem is held by the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, D.C.

==Biography==
He was born in Hamburg as the son of Johannes Sr., and brother of Balthasar and Johannes Coymans, wealthy businessmen in [[Amsterdam]] who commissioned a [[canal house]] there called the [[Coymanshuis]], built by the Haarlem architect [[Jacob van Campen]]. He married Dorothea Berck in 1616, the daughter of a wealthy wine trader in Dordrecht. The couple had five children who each married various wealthy members of the Haarlem or Amsterdam regency: [[Balthasar Coymans|Balthasar]], [[Wilhelmina Coymans|Wilhelmina]], Aernout, Josephus the Younger, Erkenraad, and [[Isabella Coymans|Isabella]]. In 1632 Joseph lived in Haarlem on the Smedestraat, where  he rented the largest house in the street from Anna Vogel, the wealthy wife of the [[Dutch West India Company|WIC]] businessman Aelbert Dirckz Bas.&lt;ref&gt;Aelbert Bas and his wife Anna Vogel lived on the Keizersgracht in Amsterdam, see ''De Vroedschap van Amsterdam, 1578-1795'', by [[J.E. Elias]]&lt;/ref&gt; His neighbors there were the lawyer [[Paulus van Beresteyn]] and the notary Henrick van Gellinckhuysen.&lt;ref&gt;''Waar thans het politiebureau in de Smedestraat staat'', by [[G.H. Kurtz]], pp. 34-60, Haerlem : jaarboek 1964, ISSN 0927-0728&lt;/ref&gt;  Coymans ran a business as a trader in the linen market and owned some bleacheries in Bloemendaal.

The Coymans' son Balthasar (named after his uncle) later lived in the Zijlstraat, and the widowed Dorothea moved in with them before she died, where the inventory of her possessions was conducted, including a long list of paintings.

==Coymans hofje==
Dorothea purchased a [[hofje]] between the [[Grote Houtstraat]] and the Klein Heiligland in 1655 that was later purchased by [[Pieter Teyler]] for his [[Teylers Hofje]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Vrouwe- en Antonie Gasthuys]] : successeur op het Klein Heiligland van het Bogaerts, Coymans', Kolders, Teylers hofje'', by A.D. Bloemsma, pp. 144-150, Haerlem : jaarboek 1961, ISSN 0927-0728&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;!--need to check: She also bought a summer home in 1677 next to [[Waterland]] in [[Velsen]], called Watervliet. --&gt;The pendant portraits of Joseph and Dorothea were painted by Frans Hals in 1644, when their daughter Isabella was married.
He died in Haarlem.

'''''Liar's Poker''''' is a non-fiction, semi-[[autobiographical]] book by [[Michael Lewis (author)|Michael Lewis]] describing the author's experiences as a [[Bond (finance)|bond]] salesman on [[Wall Street]] during the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Michael, Liar's Poker, W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 1989. {{ISBN|0-393-02750-3}}. {{cite web |url=http://www.wwnorton.com/catalog/backlist/002750.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501034946/http://www.wwnorton.com/catalog/backlist/002750.htm |archivedate=2009-05-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; First published in 1989, it is considered one of the books that defined Wall Street during the 1980s, along with [[Bryan Burrough]] and John Helyar's ''[[Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco]]'', and the fictional ''[[The Bonfire of the Vanities]]'' by [[Tom Wolfe]]. The book captures an important period in the history of Wall Street. Two important figures in that history feature prominently in the text, the head of [[Salomon Brothers]]' mortgage department [[Lewis Ranieri]] and the firm's CEO [[John Gutfreund]].

The book's name is taken from [[liar's poker]], a high-stakes gambling game popular with the bond traders in the book.

==Overview==
''Liar's Poker'' follows two different story threads, though not necessarily in chronological order.

The first thread is autobiographical, and follows Lewis through his college education and his hiring by [[Salomon Brothers]] (now a subsidiary of [[Citigroup]]) in 1984. This part of the book gives a first-person account of how bond [[Trader (finance)|traders]] and salesmen truly work, their personalities, and their [[culture]].  The book captures well an important period in the history of Wall Street.  Important figures in that history feature prominently in the text: [[John Meriwether]], mortgage department head [[Lewis Ranieri]], and firm CEO [[John Gutfreund]].

The second thread is a history of Salomon Brothers and an overview of Wall Street in general, especially how the firm single-handedly created a market for [[mortgage bond]]s that made the firm wealthy, only to be outdone by [[Michael Milken]] and his [[junk bonds]]. This thread is less dependent on Lewis' personal experience and features quotes apparently drawn from interviews with various relevant figures.

Lewis jumps back and forth between these two threads in the book.

==Biographical section==
Lewis was an [[art history]] student at [[Princeton University]], who nonetheless wanted to break into [[Wall Street]] to make money. He describes his almost pathetic attempts to find a [[finance]] job, only to be roundly rejected by every firm to which he applied. For example, in 1982 [[Lehman Brothers]] had rejected his employment application. He then enrolled in the [[London School of Economics]] to gain a master's degree in economics.

While in England, Lewis was invited to a banquet hosted by the [[Queen Mother]], where his cousin, Baroness Linda Monroe von Stauffenberg, one of the organizers of the banquet, purposefully seated him next to the wife of the London managing partner of [[Salomon Brothers]]. She hoped that his intelligence might impress her enough for her to suggest to her husband that Lewis, be given a job with Salomon Brothers. The strategy worked, and Lewis was granted an interview and subsequently received a job offer.

Lewis then moved to [[New York City]] for Salomon's training program. Here, he was appalled at the sophomoric, obtuse and obnoxious behavior of some of his fellow trainees, and indoctrinated into the money culture of Salomon Brothers and the Wall Street culture as a whole.

From New York, Lewis was shipped to the [[London]] office of Salomon Brothers as a bond salesman. Despite his lack of knowledge, he was soon handling millions of dollars in [[investment]] accounts. In 1987, he witnessed a near-hostile [[takeover]] of Salomon Brothers but survived with his job. However, growing disillusioned with his work, Lewis quit the firm at the beginning of 1988 to write this book and become a financial [[journalist]].  The first edition was published October 17, 1989.

==Wall Street culture==
The book is an unflattering portrayal of Wall Street traders and salesmen, their personalities, their beliefs, and their work practices.

During the training sessions, Lewis was struck by the infantilism of most of his fellow trainees. Examples included yelling at and insulting financial experts who talked to them, throwing spit balls at one another and at lecturers, calling [[phone sex]] lines and then broadcasting them over the company's [[intercom]], [[gambling]] on behavioral traits (such as how long it took certain trainees to fall asleep during lectures), and the trainees' incredible lust for money and contempt for any position that did not earn that much.

Lewis attributed the bond traders' and salesmen's behavior to the fact that the trading floor required neither finesse nor advanced financial knowledge, but, rather, the ability and desire to exploit others' weaknesses, to intimidate others into listening to traders and salesmen, and the ability to spend hours a day screaming orders under high pressure situations. He referred to their worldview as "The Law of the Jungle."

He also noted that, although most arrivals on Wall Street had studied [[economics]], this knowledge was never used; in fact, any academic knowledge was frowned on by traders.

Lewis also attributed the [[savings and loan scandal]] of the 1980s and 1990s to the inability of inexperienced, provincial, small-town bank managers to compete with Wall Street. He described people on Wall Street as masters at taking advantage of an undiscerning public, which the savings and loan industry provided in abundance.

==Overall economic climate of the 1980s==
Lewis portrays the 1980s as an era where government [[deregulation]] allowed less-than-scrupulous people on Wall Street to take advantage of others' ignorance, and thus grow extremely wealthy.

He traces the rise of Salomon Brothers through mortgage trading, when deregulation by the [[U.S. Congress]] suddenly allowed managers of [[savings and loan association]]s to start selling mortgages as bonds. [[Lewis Ranieri]], a Salomon Brothers' employee, had created the only viable mortgage trading section on Wall Street, so when the law passed, it became a windfall for the firm.

However, Lewis believed that Salomon Brothers became too complacent in their new-found wealth and took to unwise expansion and massive displays of [[conspicuous consumption]]. When the rest of Wall Street wised up to the market, the firm lost its advantage.

Another problem Lewis noticed was a large disconnect between what Salomon Brothers mortgage traders were paid, and what they ''believed'' they should have been paid. Ranieri and his fellow traders felt that, since their department generated so much money for the firm, they ought to receive considerably higher salaries and compensation. Gutfreund and other managers, on the other hand, argued that the traders were not risking their own money, but the firm's, and noted that the mortgage department spent years losing money before succeeding. Because of this disagreement, Salomon Brothers lost many of its traders when other firms that added mortgage bonds to their business began to offer higher salaries, easily luring the Salomon Brothers mortgage bond traders away.

Likewise, Lewis argued that Salomon Brothers tried to "professionalize" itself. As he notes, Ranieri and his fellow traders lacked college degrees; one of the traders had not even finished the eighth grade. Despite their lack of academic credentials, the group was extremely successful financially. But in order to improve its "image," the firm began to hire graduates of prestigious business and economics programs. Because of his uncouth manners, Ranieri (along with many of his [[Italian American]] colleagues) were eventually fired.

Lewis argued that Salomon Brothers' mortgage-bond success was based not on innate intelligence or trading skill, but on pure luck. Lewis noted that, although Ranieri was often hailed as a "visionary" for creating a mortgage department before a mortgage market existed, deregulation caught him completely by surprise. The firms that lured away Salomon's traders with higher salaries ended up losing money, as it soon became clear that the traders lacked any special skills: they just happened to be working in mortgages during a period of rising bond prices. After enough firms became involved with mortgage bonds, prices stabilized, and the bonds eventually traded like any others.

After dealing with mortgage bonds, Lewis examined junk bonds and described how [[Michael Milken]] built junk bonds from nothing to a multi-trillion-dollar market. Because the demand for junk bonds was higher than its supply, Lewis argues that [[corporate raid]]ers began to attack otherwise sound companies in order to create more junk bonds.

Lewis remarked in his conclusion that the 1980s were a time when anyone could make millions, provided they were in the right place at the right time, as exemplified by Lewis Ranieri's success.

==Catch phrases==
*'''Big Swinging Dick''' — A big-time trader or salesman. ("If he could make millions of dollars come out of those phones, he became that most revered of all species: a Big Swinging Dick." p.&amp;nbsp;56.) The opposite of this term is '''Geek''', used to refer to a just-hired trainee.
*'''Equities in Dallas''' — A particularly undesirable job within a finance firm. ("Thus, '''Equities in Dallas''' became training program shorthand for 'Just bury that lowest form of human scum where it will never be seen again'" p.&amp;nbsp;58.)
*'''Blowing up a customer''' — Successfully convincing a customer to purchase an investment product which ends up declining rapidly in value, forcing the client to end up withdrawing from the market.
*'''Feeding Frenzy''' — The Friday-morning meal shared by a certain clique of bond traders. At this meal, traders would order astounding quantities of take-out food, far more than they could eat (e.g., a five-gallon tubs of [[guacamole]] with an order of $400 worth of [[Mexican food]]). The traders would then compete with each other to see who could display the most [[gluttony]].
*'''The Human Piranha''' — Nickname for an employee &lt;ref&gt;"The Human Piranha" is said to be [http://books.wwnorton.com/books/Author.aspx?id=8413 Tom Bernard] [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/11/AR2009091102602.html] who ran trading businesses for [[Salomon Brothers]], [[Kidder Peabody]], and [[Lehman Brothers]] for twenty-eight years on Wall Street.&lt;/ref&gt; at Salomon Brothers who constantly used the word "[[fuck]]" and its variants in his speech. A reference to [[Tom Wolfe]]'s character in ''[[The Bonfire of the Vanities]]''.
*'''No Tears''' — Used to describe a preset alternate rule Michael Lewis describes in the book, John Gutfreund challenges John Meriweather to a game of Liars Poker, in which he states "no tears" which means players of the game who lose can't complain about losing afterwards.

[[File:Scheme Jaw Crusher.gif|thumb|right|[[wikt:crush#Verb|Crushing]], a form of [[comminution]], one of the unit operations of mineral processing]]
In the field of [[extractive metallurgy]], '''mineral processing''', also known as '''ore dressing''', is the process of separating commercially valuable [[mineral]]s from their [[ore]]s.

==History        ==
[[File:Geevor waterwheel stamps.jpg|thumb|right|A set of Cornish stamps]]
{{Expand section|date=August 2010}}
Before the advent of heavy machinery the raw ore was broken up using hammers wielded by hand, a process called "spalling". Before long, mechanical means were found to achieve this. For instance, [[stamp mill]]s were used in [[Samarkand]] as early as 973. They were also in use in medieval [[Persia]]. By the 11th century, stamp mills were in widespread use throughout the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], from [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]] and North Africa in the west to [[Central Asia]] in the east.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Robert Lucas (2005), "Industrial Milling in the Ancient and Medieval Worlds: A Survey of the Evidence for an Industrial Revolution in Medieval Europe", ''Technology and Culture'' '''46''' (1): 1-30 [10-1 &amp; 27]&lt;/ref&gt; A later example was the [[Cornish stamps]], consisting of a series of iron hammers mounted in a vertical frame, raised by [[cam]]s on the shaft of a [[waterwheel]] and falling onto the ore under gravity.

The simplest method of separating ore from gangue consists of picking out the individual crystals of each. This is a very tedious process, particularly when the individual particles are small. Another comparatively simple method relies on the various minerals having different [[specific gravity|densities]], causing them to collect in different places: metallic minerals (being heavier) will drop out of suspension more quickly than lighter ones, which will be carried further by a stream of water. The process of panning and sifting for gold uses both of these methods. Various devices known as 'buddles' were used to take advantage of this property.{{When|date=November 2010}} Later, more advanced machines were used such as the [[vanning|Frue vanner]], invented in 1874.

Other equipment used historically includes the hutch, a trough used with some ore-dressing machines and the keeve or kieve, a large tub used for differential settlement.

==Unit operations==
Mineral processing can involve four general types of unit operation: ''[[comminution]]'' – particle size reduction; ''[[sizing]]'' – separation of particle sizes by screening or classification; ''concentration'' by taking advantage of physical and surface chemical properties; and ''[[dewatering]]'' – solid/liquid separation. In all of these processes, the most important considerations are the economics of the processes and this is dictated by the grade and recovery of the final product. To do this, the mineralogy of the ore needs to be considered as this dictates the amount of liberation required and the processes that can occur. The smaller the particles processes, the greater the theoretical grade and recovery of the final product, but this however is difficult to do with fine particles as they prevent certain concentration processes from occurring.

===Comminution===
[[Comminution]] is particle size reduction of materials. Comminution may be carried out on either dry materials or slurries. [[Crusher|Crushing]] and [[Mill (grinding)|grinding]] are the two primary comminution processes. Crushing is normally carried out on "run-of-mine"&lt;ref&gt;Run-of-mine: The raw mined material as it is delivered prior to treatment of any sort. {{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; ore, while grinding (normally carried out after crushing) may be conducted on dry or slurried material. In comminution, the size reduction of particles is done by three types of forces: compression, impact and attrition. Compression and impact forces are extensively used in crushing operations while attrition is the dominant force in grinding. The primarily used equipment in crushing are-jaw crushers, gyratory crushers and cone crushers whereas rod mills and ball mills, closed circuited with a classifier unit, are generally employed for grinding purposes in a mineral processing plant. Crushing is a dry process whereas grinding is generally performed wet and hence is more energy intensive.

===Sizing===
[[File:THC 2003.902.122 Ore Crushing Machinery.tif | thumb|right | Screening ore through a sieve, Fixed Nitrogen Research Laboratory, 1930]]
[[File:Sizer 2000.jpg|thumb|Sizer 2000 for screening coarse to small particles]]
Sizing is the general term for separation of particles according to their size.

The simplest sizing process is screening, or passing the particles to be sized through a screen or number of screens. Screening equipment can include grizzlies,&lt;ref&gt;Grizzly: a grid of iron bars that allows ore of the correct size to travel down the ore pass to the bottom of the mine, ready for hoisting to the surface. An active, articulating "grizzly" that is able to roll, scrub, clean and discharge oversize rock and boulder of up to 4 foot (1220 mm minus)diameter, while recovering all the 2 inch minus (51 mm minus) slurry material for further screening, separation and recovery of target metals/minerals is the DEROCKER system (RMS-Ross Corporation)

|accessdate=2010-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; bar screens, wedge wire screens, radial sieves, banana screens, multi-deck screens, vibratory screen, fine screens, flip flop screens and wire mesh screens. Screens can be static (typically the case for very coarse material), or they can incorporate mechanisms to shake or vibrate the screen. Some considerations in this process include the screen material, the aperture size, shape and orientation, the amount of near sized particles, the addition of water, the amplitude and frequency of the vibrations, the angle of inclination, the presence of harmful materials, like steel and wood, and the size distribution of the particles.

Classification refers to sizing operations that exploit the differences in settling velocities exhibited by particles of different size. Classification equipment may include [[ore sorting|ore sorters]], [[gas cyclone]]s, [[hydrocyclone]]s, rotating [[trommel]]s, rake classifiers or fluidized classifiers.

An important factor in both comminution and sizing operations is the determination of the particle size distribution of the materials being processed, commonly referred to as [[particle size analysis]]. Many techniques for analyzing particle size are used, and the techniques include both off-line analyses which require that a sample of the material be taken for analysis and on-line techniques that allow for analysis of the material as it flows through the process.

===Concentration===
There are a number of ways to increase the concentration of the wanted minerals: in any particular case the method chosen will depend on the relative physical and surface chemical properties of the mineral and the [[gangue]].
Concentration is defined as the number of moles of a solute in a volume of the solution. In case of mineral processing concentration means the increase of the percentage of the valuable mineral in the concentrate.

===Gravity concentration===
Gravity separation is the separation of two or more minerals of different specific gravity by their relative movement in response to the force of gravity and one or more other forces (such as centrifugal forces, magnetic forces, buoyant forces), one of which is resistance to motion (drag force) by a viscous medium such as heavy media, water or, less commonly, air. 

Gravity separation is one of the oldest technique in mineral processing but has seen a decline in its use since the introduction of methods like flotation, classification, magnetic separation and leaching. Gravity separation dates back to at least 3000 BC when Egyptians used the technique for separation of gold.

It is necessary to determine the suitability of a gravity concentration process before it is employed for concentration of an ore. The ''concentration criterion'' is commonly used for this purpose, designated &lt;math&gt;CC&lt;/math&gt; in the following equation (where &lt;math&gt;SG&lt;/math&gt; represents [[specific gravity]]):

:&lt;math&gt;CC = \frac {SG(heavy\ mineral) - SG(fluid)}{SG(light\ mineral) - SG(fluid)}&lt;/math&gt;
*for CC &gt; 2.5, suitable for separation of particles above 75 micron in size
*for 1.75 &lt; CC &lt; 2.5, suitable for separation of particles above 150 micron in size
*for 1.50 &lt; CC &lt; 1.75, suitable for separation of particles above 1.7&amp;nbsp;mm in size
*for 1.25 &lt; CC &lt; 1.50, suitable for separation of particles above 6.35&amp;nbsp;mm in size
*for CC &lt; 1.25, not suitable for any size

Although concentration criteria is a useful rule of thumb when predicting [[Amenable group|amenability]] to gravity concentration, factors such as particle shape and relative concentration of heavy and light particles can dramatically affect separation efficiency in practice.

; Classification
There are several methods that make use of the weight or density differences of particles:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Lowrie, Raymond L | author2=Society for Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration | title=SME mining reference handbook | publication-date=2002 | publisher=Society for Mining, Metallurgy, and Exploration | isbn=978-0-87335-175-1 }} - chapter 17 - Classification section by Paul D.

* Sluices
* [[Elutriation|Elutriators]]

These processes can be classified as either density separation or gravity (weight) separation.

In dense media separation a media is created with a density in between the density of the ore and [[gangue]] particles. When subjected to this media particles either float or sink depending on their density relative to the media. In this way the separation takes place purely on density differences and does not, in principle, relay on any other factors such as particle weight or shape. In practice, particle size and shape can affect separation efficiency. Dense medium separation can be performed using a variety of mediums. These include, organic liquids, aqueous solutions or suspensions of very fine particles in water or air. The organic liquids are typically not used due to their toxicity, difficulties in handling and relative cost. Industrially, the most common dense media is a suspension of fine magnetite and/or ferrosilicon particles. An aqueous solution as a dense medium is used in coal processing in the form of a belknap wash and suspensions in air are used in water-deficient areas, like areas of China, where sand is used to separate coal from the gangue minerals.

Gravity separation is also called relative gravity separation as it separates particles due to their relative response to a driving force. This is controlled by factors such as particle weight, size and shape. These processes can also be classified into multi-G and single G processes. The difference is the magnitude of the driving force for the separation. Multi-G processes allow the separation of very fine particles to occur (in the range of 5 to 50 micron) by increasing the driving force of separation in order to increase the rate at which particles separate. In general, single G process are only capable of processing particles that are greater than approximately 80 micron in diameter.

Of the gravity separation processes, the spiral concentrators and circular jigs are two of the most economical due to their simplicity and use of space. They operate by flowing film separation and can either use washwater or be washwater-less. The washwater spirals separate particles more easily but can have issues with entrainment of gangue with the concentrate produced.

===Froth flotation===
[[File:FlotationFalconbridgeOnt.jpg|thumb|right|Froth flotation cells used to concentrate copper and nickel sulfide minerals, Falconbridge, Ontario.]]
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2010}}
[[Froth flotation]] is an important concentration process. This process can be used to separate any two different particles and operated by the surface chemistry of the particles. In flotation, bubbles are introduced into a pulp and the bubbles rise through the pulp. In the process, hydrophobic particles become bound to the surface of the bubbles. The driving force for this attachment is the change in the surface free energy when the attachment occurs. These bubbles rise through the slurry and are collected from the surface. To enable these particles to attach, careful consideration of the chemistry of the pulp needs to be made. These considerations include the pH, Eh and the presence of flotation reagents. The pH is important as it changes the charge of the particles surface and the pH affects the chemisorption of collectors on the surface of the particles.

The addition of flotation reagents also affects the operation of these processes. The most important chemical that is added is the collector. This chemical binds to the surface of the particles as it is a surfactant. The main considerations in this chemical is the nature of the head group and the size of the hydrocarbon chain. The hydrocarbon tail needs to be short to maximize the selectivity of the desired mineral and the headgroup dictates which minerals it attaches to.

The frothers are another important chemical addition to the pulp as it enables stable bubbles to be formed. This is important as if the bubble coalesce, minerals fall off their surface. The bubbles however should not be too stable as this prevents easy transportation and dewatering of the concentrate formed. The mechanism of these frothers is not completely known and further research into their mechanisms is being performed.

Depressants and activators are used to selectively separate one mineral from another. Depressants inhibit the flotation of one mineral or minerals while activators enable the flotation of others. Examples of these include CN&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, used to depress all sulfides but galena and this depressant is believed to operate by changing the solubility of chemisorbed and physisorbed collectors on sulfides. This theory originates from Russia. An example of an activator is Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, used for the flotation of sphalerite.

There are a number of cells able to be used for the flotation of minerals. these include flotation columns and mechanical flotation cells. The flotation columns are used for finer minerals and they typically have a higher grade and lower recovery of minerals than mechanical flotation cells. The cells in use at the moment can exceed 300&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. This is done as they are cheaper per unit volume than smaller cells, but they are not able to be controlled as easily as smaller cells.

This process was invented in the 19th century in Australia. It was used to recover a [[sphalerite]] concentrate from tailings, produced using gravity concentration. Further improvements have come from Australia in the form of the [[Jameson Cell]], developed at the University of Newcastle, Australia. This operated by the use of a plunging jet that generates fine bubbles. These fine bubbles have a higher kinetic energy and as such they can be used for the flotation of fine grained minerals, such as those produced by the isamill.

===Electrostatic separation===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2010}}There are two main types of [[electrostatic separator]]s. These work in similar ways, but the forces applied to the particles are different and these forces are gravity and electrostatic attraction. The two types are electrodynamic separators (or high tension rollers) or electrostatic separators. In high tension rollers, particles are charged by a corona discharge. This charges the particles that subsequently travel on a drum. The conducting particles lose their charge to the drum and are removed from the drum with centripetal acceleration. Electrostatic plate separators work by passing a stream of particles past a charged anode. The conductors lose electrons to the plate and are pulled away from the other particles due to the induced attraction to the anode. These separators are used for particles between 75 and 250 micron and for efficient separation to occur, the particles need to be dry, have a close size distribution and uniform in shape. Of these considerations, one of the most important is the water content of the particles. This is important as a layer of moisture on the particles will render the non-conductors as conductors as the layer of the water is conductive.

Electrostatic plate separators are usually used for streams that have small conductors and coarse non-conductors. The high tension rollers are usually used for streams that have coarse conductors and fine non-conductors.

These separators are commonly used for separating [[mineral sands]], an example of one of these mineral processing plants is the CRL processing plant at Pinkenba in Brisbane Queensland. In this plant, [[zircon]], [[rutile]] and [[ilmenite]] are separated from the silica [[gangue]]. In this plant, the separation is performed in a number of stages with roughers, cleaners, scavengers and recleaners.

===Magnetic separation===
Magnetic separation is a process in which magnetically susceptible material is extracted from a mixture using a magnetic force. This separation technique can be useful in mining iron as it is attracted to a magnet. In mines where [[wolframite]] was mixed with [[cassiterite]], such as South Crofty and East Pool mine in Cornwall or with bismuth such as at the Shepherd and Murphy mine in Moina, Tasmania, magnetic separation was used to separate the ores. At these mines a device called a Wetherill's Magnetic Separator (invented by John Price Wetherill, 1844–1906)[1] was used. In this machine the raw ore, after calcination was fed onto a moving belt which passed underneath two pairs of electromagnets under which further belts ran at right angles to the feed belt. The first pair of electromagnets was weakly magnetised and served to draw off any iron ore present. The second pair were strongly magnetised and attracted the wolframite, which is weakly magnetic. These machines were capable of treating 10 tons of ore a day. This process of separating magnetic substances from the non-magnetic substances in a mixture with the help of a magnet is called magnetic separation..

This process operates by moving particles in a magnetic field. The force experienced in the magnetic field is given by the equation f=m/k.H.dh/dx. with k=magnetic susceptibility, H-magnetic field strength, and dh/dx being the magnetic field gradient. As seen in this equation, the separation can be driven in two ways, either through a gradient in a magnetic field or the strength of a magnetic field. The different driving forces are used in the different concentrators. These can be either with water or without. Like the spirals, washwater aids in the separation of the particles while increases the entrainment of the gangue in the concentrate.

===Automated Ore Sorting===
{{See also|Sensor-based sorting}}
Modern, automated sorting applies optical sensors (visible spectrum, near infrared, X-ray, ultraviolet), that can be coupled with electrical conductivity and magnetic susceptibility sensors, to control the mechanical separation of ore into two or more categories on an individual rock by rock basis. Also new sensors have been developed which exploit material properties such as electrical conductivity, magnetization, molecular structure and thermal conductivity. Sensor based sorting has found application in the processing of nickel, gold, copper, coal
and diamonds.

===Dewatering===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2010}}
Dewatering is an important process in mineral processing. The purpose of dewatering is to remove water absorbed by the particles which increases the pulp density. This is done for a number of reasons, specifically, to enable ore handling and concentrates to be transported easily, allow further processing to occur and to dispose of the gangue. The water extracted from the ore by dewatering is recirculated for plant operations after being sent to a water treatment plant. The main processes that are used in dewatering include dewatering screens such as [[Sepro Mineral Systems#Sepro-Sizetec Screens|Sepro-Sizetec Screens]], sedimentation, filtering, and thermal drying. These processes increase in difficulty and cost as the particle size decreases.

Dewatering screens operate by passing particles over a screen. The particles pass over the screen while the water passes through the apertures in the screen. This process is only viable for coarse ores that have a close size distribution as the apertures can allow small particles to pass through.

Sedimentation operates by passing water into a large thickener or clarifier. In these devices, the particles settle out of the slurry under the effects of gravity, or centripetal forces. These are limited by the surface chemistry of the particles and the size of the particles. To aid in the sedimentation process, flocculants and coagulants are added to reduce the repulsive forces between the particles. This repulsive force is due to the double layer formed on the surface of the particles. The flocculants work by binding multiple particles together while the coagulants work by reducing the thickness of the charged layer on the outside of the particle. After thickening, slurry is often stored in ponds or impoundments. Alternatively, it can pumped into a [[belt press]] or membrane [[filter press]] to recycle process water and create stackable, dry filter cake, or "tailings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tons Per Hour Product Guide 2016|url=http://tonsperhour.com/wp-content/uploads/TPH_PG_2016_Eng.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thermal drying is usually used for fine particles and to remove low water content in the particles. Some common processes include rotary dryers, fluidised beds, spray driers, hearth dryers and rotary tray dryers. This process is usually expensive to operate due to the fuel requirement of the dryers.

==Other processes==
Many [[physical plant|mechanical plants]] also incorporate [[Hydrometallurgy|hydrometallurgical]] or [[Pyrometallurgy|pyrometallurgical]] processes as part of an extractive metallurgical operation. [[Geometallurgy]] is a branch of [[extractive metallurgy]] that combines mineral processing with the geologic sciences. This includes the study of oil agglomeration&lt;ref&gt;Preparation of salty coals with oil-agglomeration technology / V. S. Biletskyi, A. Kheloufi, P. V. Sergeev // 9th International conference on coal science (ICCS’97), 7–12 September 1997, Essen, Germany. V. 1.

A number of auxiliary [[materials handling]] operations are also considered a branch of mineral processing such as storage (as in bin design), conveying, sampling, weighing, slurry transport, and pneumatic transport.

The efficiency and efficacy of many processing techniques are influenced by upstream activities such as mining method and [[Coal Blending|blending]].&lt;ref name = "Whitacre"&gt;Whitacre, J., Iorio, A., Schellenberg, S.

==History==
The NK Horeca has been held in its current form on the Horecava since 2007, where pre-existing award of the Golden Chef's Hat and the award for the best sandwich had been combined. For the 2010 edition, the award for flair bartending was added.&lt;ref name=misset2009/&gt;

===The Golden Chef's Hat===
The Golden Chef's hat was introduced in 1960, then as the Silver Chef's Hat, by [[Nestlé]]. In 1996 the award was re-introduced as the Golden Chef's Hat.&lt;ref name=misset2009 /&gt; There are also awards for the best masterchef and student, and the best chef under 25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.horecaentree.nl/home/2726-Start_inschrijvingen_NK_Horeca_2010.html| publisher = Horeca Entree| date = 15 September 2009| title = Start inschrijvingen NK Horeca 2010 | language = Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4099">The '''Octave Chanute Award''' was created in early 1902 by the [[Western Society of Engineers]] for papers of merit on engineering innovations. It is still awarded as of 2011. 
The [[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.]] (AIAA) introduced the "Chanute Flight Award" in 1939; it was presented for an outstanding contribution made by a pilot or test personnel to the advancement of the art, science, and technology of aeronautics. This award was discontinued in 2005. It was reactivated in 2010 as the "Chanute Flight Test Award" to recognize significant lifetime achievements in the advancement of the art, science, and technology of flight test engineering. 

==Self taught==
[[File:Octave A. Chanute.jpg|thumb|60 px| right|alt=Octave Chanute photograph|Chanute]]
[[Octave Chanute]], 1832&amp;ndash;1910, was born in France and became a naturalized American. He was a self-taught engineer. He designed the first [[rail transport|railroad]] [[bridge (structure)|bridge]] over the Missouri River and the [[Union Stock Yards]] in Chicago (IL) as well as those in Kansas City (MO). Octave Chanute was a pioneer aeronautical engineer and experimenter, and was a friend and adviser to the Wright Brothers.

==Aeronautical pioneer==
Chanute waged a long campaign to encourage the invention of the airplane. He collected information from every possible source and gave it to anyone who asked. He published a compendium of aviation information in 1894. In 1896 he commissioned several aircraft to be built. The ''Katydid'' had multiple wings that could be attached variously about the fuselage for ease of experimentation. Chanute's biplane glider (1896) with "two arched wings held rigidly together by vertical struts and diagonal wire bracing" (the principle of the Pratt truss used in the railroad bridges which Chanute constructed) served as a prototype design for subsequent airplanes.

==Recognition==
He is universally recognized as a prominent engineer, experimenter, writer and communicator, which is why these two award were given his name.

The former Chanute AFB in Illinois was named in honor of him, and so was the town of Chanute, KS

'''Proxy voting''' is a form of [[voting]] whereby a member of a decision-making body may delegate his or her voting power to a representative, to enable a vote in absence. The representative may be another member of the same body, or external. A person so designated is called a "proxy" and the person designating him or her is called a "principal". Proxy appointments can be used to form a [[voting bloc]] that can exercise greater influence in [[deliberation]]s or [[negotiation]]s.  Proxy voting is a particularly important practice with respect to corporations; in the United States, investment advisers often vote proxies on behalf of their client accounts.&lt;ref&gt;Lemke and Lins, ''Regulation of Investment Advisers'' (Thomson West, 2017 ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States parliamentary manual ''[[Riddick's Rules of Procedure]]'' notes that, under proxy voting, voting for officers should be done by ballot, due to the difficulties involved in authentication if a member simply calls out, "I cast 17 votes for Mr. X."&lt;ref name=RID&gt;{{cite parl|title=RID|pages=155–156|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proxy voting is also an important feature in [[corporate governance]] through the [[proxy statement]]. Companies use proxy solicitation agencies like Boudicca Proxy Consultants to secure proxy votes.

==Legislatures==
The rules of some assemblies presently forbid proxy voting. For example, in both houses of the U.S. Congress, as well as in most if not all state legislatures, each member must be present and cast his own vote for that vote to be counted. This can result, however, in the absence of a quorum and the need to compel attendance by a sufficient number of missing members to get a quorum. See ''[[call of the house]]''.

It is possible for automatic proxy voting to be used in legislatures, by way of [[direct representation]] (this idea is essentially a form of [[Weighted voting]]). For example, it has been proposed that instead of electing members from single-member districts (that may have been [[gerrymander]]ed), members be elected at large, but when seated each member cast the number of votes he or she received in the last election. Thus, if, for example, a state were allocated 32 members in the U.S. House of Representatives, the 32 candidates who received the most votes in the at-large election would be seated, but each would cast a different number of votes on the floor and in committee. This proposal would allow for representation of minority views in legislative deliberations, as it does in deliberations at shareholder meetings of corporations.  Such a concept was proposed in a submission to the 2007 Ontario Citizens' Assembly process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensassembly.gov.on.ca/documents/633009991417391250_WVSubmissionNov12_0.pdf|title=Submission to Ontario Citizens' Assembly}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two real-life examples of weighted voting include the [[Council of Ministers of the European Union]] and the [[US Electoral College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whfreeman.com/college/pdfs/comappdfs/CoMap_c11.pdf |title=Article on Weighted Voting describing US Electoral College as an example }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Parliament of New Zealand]] allows proxy voting. Sections 155-156 of the Standing Orders of the [[New Zealand House of Representatives]] specify the procedures for doing so. A member can designate another member or a party to cast his vote. However, a party may not exercise proxies for more than 25% of its members (rounded upwards).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nz/NR/rdonlyres/078D6043-9E03-4D87-93BA-A6BB84ACC063/6619/standingorders20095.pdf|title=Standing Orders of the House of Representatives|publisher=New Zealand House of Representatives|date=2005-08-12|accessdate=2008-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[New Zealand Listener]]'' notes a controversial occurrence of proxy voting. The [[Labour Party (New Zealand)|Labour Party]] was allowed to cast votes on behalf of [[Taito Phillip Field]], who was frequently absent. Theoretically, this was to be allowed only if a legislator was absent on parliamentary business, public business or pressing private business, such as illness or bereavement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.listener.co.nz/issue/3486/columnists/8250/nice_gig_for_some.html|title=Nice Gig for Some|author=Clifton, Jane|publisher=New Zealand Listener|date=March 2007|accessdate=2008-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] reforms of 1995 banished the practice, proxy voting was also used in [[U.S. House of Representatives]] committees. Often members would delegate their vote to the ranking member of their party in the committee. Republicans opposed proxy voting on the grounds that it allowed an indolent Democratic majority to move legislation through committee with antimajoritarian procedures. That is, the Democratic leader in the committee would successfully oppose the sitting Republican majority by wielding the proxies of absent Democrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wvtv7Dhc7DwC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;dq=%22proxy+voting%22 |title=Participation in Congress - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-18 | first=Richard L. | last=Hall | isbn=978-0-300-06811-5|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas E. Mann and Norman J. Ornstein write, "In a large and fragmented institution in which every member has five or six places to be at any given moment, proxy voting is a necessary evil".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xdiv1tM4qWQC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=%22proxy+voting%22 |title=A first report of the Renewing ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-18 | first1=Thomas E. | last1=Mann | first2=Norman J. | last2=Ornstein | isbn=978-0-8157-5457-2|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elections==
Proxy voting is sometimes described as "the frequency with which spouses, union workers, and friends of friends are in effect sent off to the polls with an assignment to complete." The potential for proxy voting exists in roughly one voter out of five, and it is about twice as high at the middle levels of the sophistication continuum. According to W. Russell Neuman, the net effect of the cues provided by friends and associates is not likely to be as significant as those of the political parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wsJw8qPfpJAC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;dq=%22proxy+voting%22 |title=The paradox of mass politics ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-18 | isbn=978-0-674-65460-0|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The possibility of expanded use of proxy voting has been the subject of much speculation. Terry F. Buss et al. write that [[internet voting]] would result in de facto approval of proxy voting, since passwords could be shared with others: "Obviously, cost-benefit calculations around the act of voting could also change substantially as organizations attempt to identify and provide inducements to control proxy votes without violating vote-buying prohibitions in the law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Modernizing Democracy|pages=208–209|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FlhFdTRCzOEC&amp;pg=PA209&amp;lpg=PA209&amp;dq=%2B%22proxy+voting%22+%2Bdemocracy|author1=Terry F. Buss |author2=F. Stevens Redburn |author3=Kristina Guo | isbn=978-0-7656-1763-7 | year=2006 | publisher=M.E. Sharpe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the criticisms of proxy voting is that it carries a risk of fraud or intimidation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NREXAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%2B%22proxy+voting%22+%2Belectoral&amp;dq=%2B%22proxy+voting%22+%2Belectoral |title=Democracy at the polls: a ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2003-10-03 |accessdate=2010-03-18 | first1=David | last1=Butler | isbn=978-0-8447-3405-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another criticism is that it violates the concept of a secret ballot, in that paperwork may be filed, for instance, designating a party worker as one's proxy.&lt;ref name=realising&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=q0K4FbD-B6kC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=%2B%22proxy+voting%22+%2Belectoral |title=Realising democracy: electoral law ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= November 2003|accessdate=2010-03-18 | first=Graeme | last=Orr | isbn=978-1-86287-481-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been proposed that proxy voting be combined with [[Initiatives and referendums in the United States|initiative and referendum]] to form a hybrid of [[direct democracy]] and [[representative democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://larson2008.com/wiki/index.php5?title%3DProxy_voting accessed October 21, 2008] {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://makethecase.net/wiki/Referendums_with_local-member_proxy_voting_would_improve_governance |title=Referendums with local-member proxy voting would improve governance |publisher=MakeTheCase |date=2008-09-15 |accessdate=2010-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=June 2010}}
[[James C. Miller III]], [[Ronald Reagan]]'s budget director, suggested scrapping representative democracy and instead implementing a "program for direct and proxy voting in the legislative process."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/p5v2q4v611549777/ |title= A program for direct and proxy voting in the legislative process|publisher=SpringerLink |date= |accessdate=2010-03-18 |doi=10.1007/BF01718736 |volume=7-7 |journal=Public Choice |pages=107–113}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested by Joseph Francis Zimmerman that proxy voting be allowed in [[New England town meeting]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=y9lQ0hZQxhEC&amp;pg=PA179&amp;dq=%2B%22proxy+voting%22+%2Bdemocracy |title=The New England town meeting ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-18 | isbn=978-0-275-96523-5|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proxy voting can eliminate some of the problems associated with the [[public choice]] dilemma of [[bundling (public choice)|bundling]].

===Albania===
According to Arch Puddington et al., in Albanian Muslim areas, many women have been effectively disenfranchised through proxy voting by male relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xN5O15Xzm1cC&amp;pg=PA478&amp;dq=%2B%22referendum%22+%2B%22proxy+voting%22 |title=Freedom in the World: The Annual ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2008-04-15 |accessdate=2010-03-18 | first=Arch | last=Puddington | isbn=978-0-7425-5897-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Algeria===
In Algeria, restrictions on proxy voting were instituted circa 1991 in order to undermine the [[Islamic Salvation Front]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ob9mn2RzL-4C&amp;pg=PA433&amp;dq=%2B%22proxy+voting%22+%2Belectoral |title=The government and politics of the ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-18 | first1=David E. | last1=Long | first2=Bernard | last2=Reich | isbn=978-0-8133-3899-6|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In Canada, the province of Nova Scotia allows citizens to vote by proxy if they expect to be absent. The Territories of Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut also allow for proxy voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elections.ca/loi/com2000/Voting/vot06_e.html |title=Compendium of Election Administration in Canada |publisher=Elections.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-03-18 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316163259/http://www.elections.ca/loi/com2000/Voting/vot06_e.html |archivedate=2008-03-16 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian prisoners of war in enemy camps were allowed to vote through proxy voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IHA8h0QrAZwC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;dq=%22proxy+voting%22 |title=Establishing the rules of the game ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-18 | first1=Louis | last1=Massicotte | first2=André | last2=Blais | first3=Antoine | last3=Yoshinaka | isbn=978-0-8020-8564-1|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Stewart and Keith Archer opine that proxy voting can result in leadership selection processes to become leader-dominated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xsa4vhIak-YC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;dq=%2B%22proxy+voting%22+%2B%22electoral+reform%22 |title=Quasi-Democracy: Parties and ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= 2001-02-01|accessdate=2010-03-18 | first1=David | last1=Stewart | first2=Keith | last2=Archer | isbn=978-0-7748-0791-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proxy voting had only been available to military personnel since World War II, but was extended in 1970 and 1977 to include voters in special circumstances such as northern camp operators, fishermen, and prospectors.

===China===
Some [[Chinese provinces]] allow village residents to designate someone to vote on their behalf. Lily L. Tsai notes that "In practice, one family member often casts votes for everyone in the family even if they are present for the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lily L. Tsai|page=207|title=Accountability Without Democracy: Solidary Groups and Public Goods Provision|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, a [[Carter Center]] delegation recommended abolishing the proxy voting that allowed one person to vote for three; the [[International Republican Institute]] had made a similar recommendation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=upDNEYtw4uYC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=%2B%22proxy+voting%22+%2Belectoral |title=Elections and democracy in greater China - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-18 | first1=Larry | last1=Diamond | isbn=978-0-19-924417-1|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proxy voting also became an issue in relation to many of the [[Wenzhou]] people doing business outside.{{clarify|date=September 2015}} Most election disputes revolved around proxy votes, including the issues of who could represent them to vote and what kinds of evidence were acceptable for proxy voting. Intense competition made the proxy voting process more and more formal and transparent. Some villages required a [[notary]] to validate faxed proxy votes; some villages asked for [[fax]]ed signatures; more often villages publicized those proxy votes so that villagers could directly monitor them. [[Taicang]] government reported a 99.4% voter turnout in its 1997 election, but a study showed that after removing proxy votes, only 48% of the eligible voters in the sample reported that they actually went to the central polling station to vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jvSNIhVzR9sC&amp;pg=PA208&amp;dq=%2B%22proxy+voting%22+%2Belectoral |title=Marketization and Democracy in China - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= 2008-04-28|accessdate=2010-03-18 | first=Jianjun | last=Zhang | isbn=978-0-415-45222-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gabon===
According to Mim Kelber, "in Central Africa, all it takes for a man to cast a proxy vote for his wife is to produce an unwitnessed letter mentioning the name of the person to whom the voting power is delegated." The Gabon respondent to an [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] letter commented, "It has been observed that this possibility was exploited to a far greater extent by men than by women, for reasons not always noble."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fXDV3HQTtPcC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=%2B%22proxy+voting%22+%2Belectoral |title=Women and government: new ways to ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-18 | first=Mim | last=Kelber | isbn=978-0-275-94816-0|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guyana===
Proxy voting played an important role in [[Guyana]] politics in the 1960s. Prior to and during the 1961 elections, proxies had been severely restricted. Some restrictions were lifted, and there was a rise in proxy votes cast from 300 in 1961 to 6,635 in 1964. After that election, the [[Commonwealth Team of Observers]] voiced concern about proxy votes being liable to fraud. The proxy voting rules were relaxed further, and in 1969, official figures recorded 19,287 votes cast by proxy, about 7% of the total votes cast (an increase from 2.5% in 1964 to 1968).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NkPBlZDGYCkC&amp;pg=PA359&amp;dq=%2B%22proxy+voting%22+%2Belectoral |title=Elections in the Americas: a data ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= 2005-06-03|accessdate=2010-03-18 | isbn=978-0-19-928357-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amidst allegations of fraud, more restrictions were placed on proxy voting in 1973; in that year, about 10,000 votes were cast by proxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jagan.org/articles5i.htm |title=Virtual Army Coup In Guyana |author=Jagan, Cheddi |year=2000 |accessdate=2008-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317025214/http://jagan.org/articles5i.htm |archivedate=2008-03-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some instances of proxy voting (usually by family members) in the Russian parliamentary elections of 1995 were noted by observers from the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=m0W9KIzhJysC&amp;pg=PA134&amp;dq=%2B%22proxy+voting%22+%2Belectoral |title=The Russian parliamentary elections ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-18 | first1=Laura | last1=Belin | first2=Robert W. | last2=Orttung | isbn=978-0-7656-0084-4|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
The provision for proxy voting in the UK dates back to [[James I of England|James I]]. Long before [[women's suffrage]], women sometimes voted as proxies for absent male family heads.

Under British electoral law, ballot papers could not be sent overseas.&lt;ref name=realising/&gt; British expatriates had no right to vote until the mid-1980s. They can now vote by proxy in general elections if they have been on a British electoral register at some point in the past 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairvote.org/?page=164&amp;articlemode=showspecific&amp;showarticle=133 |title=Overseas Voters |publisher=FairVote |date= |accessdate=2010-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can also vote by post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutmyvote.co.uk/register_to_vote/british_citizens_living_abroad.aspx |title=British citizens living abroad - About my vote, produced by The Electoral Commission |publisher=Aboutmyvote.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-10-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110117185354/http://www.aboutmyvote.co.uk/register_to_vote/british_citizens_living_abroad.aspx |archivedate=2011-01-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, electors may appoint a proxy. An elector can only act as a proxy for two people to whom they are not directly related. However, they can be a proxy for any number of electors if they are directly related to those electors. The voter can change his mind and vote in the election personally as long as his proxy has not already voted on his behalf or applied to [[vote by mail]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spelthorne.gov.uk/cou_elections_absent_voting.htm|title=Absent Voting|publisher=Spelthorne Borough Council|year=2006|accessdate=2008-02-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316124154/http://www.spelthorne.gov.uk/cou_elections_absent_voting.htm|archive-date=2008-03-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voters must provide a reason for using a proxy, such as being away on vacation. A narrower subset of reasons is permissible if the proxy is to be for more than one election. Except in cases of blindness, the validity of all proxies must be certified by someone such as an employer or doctor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rochdale.gov.uk/council_and_democracy/councillors,_democracy_and_ele/elections_-_voting.aspx |title=Elections - voting |publisher=Rochdale Metropolitan Borough Council |accessdate=2008-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316052802/http://www.rochdale.gov.uk/council_and_democracy/councillors%2C_democracy_and_ele/elections_-_voting.aspx |archivedate=2008-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In 1635–36, Massachusetts granted to the frontier towns "liberty to stay soe many of their freemen at home for the safety of their towne as they judge needful, and that the said freemen that are appoyncted by the towne to stay at home shall have liberty for this court to send their voices by proxy." According to Charles Seymour and Donald Paige Frary, had not proxy voting been implemented, the inhabitants of the frontier towns would have lost their franchises, and the government would have represented only the freemen in the vicinity of Boston. The roads were poor; the drawing of all a village's men at once would have exposed it to Indian attacks; and at election time, the emigrants' labor was needed to get the spring planting into the ground.

In Maryland, the [[primary assembly|primary assemblies]] allowed proxy voting. After the assembly of 1638, protests were sent to the proprietor in England. It was said that the Governor and his friends were able to exercise too much influence through the proxies they had obtained.

Proxy voting was also used in South Carolina; the proprietors in September 1683 complained to the governor about this system. Proxy voting was used in [[Long Island]], New York as well, at that time. Phraseology was sometimes designed to hide the fact that a proxy system was in use and that the majority of voters did not actually attend the elections. In Rhode Island, the system described as a "proxy" system, from 1664 onward, was actually simply the sending of written ballots from voters who did not attend the election, rather than a true proxy system, as in the assembly of 1647.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vUNVCafgSHkC&amp;pg=PA437&amp;lpg=PA437&amp;dq=%2Bproxy+%2B%22town+meeting%22 |title=The suffrage franchise in the ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2006-07-24 |accessdate=2010-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Progressive Era]], proxy voting was used in Republican Party state conventions in New Hampshire. The [[Boston and Maine Railroad]], the Republican Party's ally, maintained control over the Party by means of these conventions. "At the 1906 state convention, for instance, party delegates were quite willing to trade, sell, or exchange their voting power in return for various forms of remuneration from the party machine. Public outcry led to the end of such 'proxy' voting".&lt;ref name=stormy&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yXjbv-18NY4C&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=%2B%22proxy+voting%22+%2B%22progressive+era%22 |title=Stormy weather: the New Hampshire ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= 2003-11-18|accessdate=2010-03-18 | first=Dante J. | last=Scala | isbn=978-0-312-29622-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proxy voting was used in some American U.S. Presidential nominating caucuses.

====United States law on proxies====
{{Expert needed|Law|section|date=October 2008}}&lt;!-- What do these citations mean, and are the texts online? Are there citation templates for this? --&gt;
Proxy is defined by supreme courts as "an ''authority'' or power to ''do'' a certain thing."&lt;ref&gt;149 Pa. 84, 29 Atl. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; A person can confer on his proxy any power which he himself possesses. He may also give him secret instructions as to voting upon particular questions.&lt;ref&gt;Ky. L. Rep. 204; 103 Wash. 254.&lt;/ref&gt; But a proxy is ineffectual when it is contrary to law or public policy.&lt;ref&gt;98 Ala. 92; 12 So. 723.&lt;/ref&gt; Where the proxy is duly appointed and he acts within the scope of the proxy, the person authorizing the proxy is bound by his appointee's acts, including his errors or mistakes.&lt;ref&gt;122 Mo. App. 437, 99 S.W. 902.&lt;/ref&gt; When the appointer sends his appointee to a meeting, the proxy may do anything at that meeting necessary to a full and complete exercise of the appointer's right to vote at such meeting. This includes the right to vote to take the vote by ballot, or to adjourn (and, hence, he may also vote on other ordinary parliamentary motions, such as to refer, postpone, reconsider, etc., when necessary or when deemed appropriate and advantageous to the overall object or purpose of the proxy).&lt;ref&gt;13 Pa. County Ct. 576.&lt;/ref&gt;

A proxy cannot vote when the principal himself is present and votes. He can vote only in the principal's absence.&lt;ref&gt;181 Iowa 1013, 165 N.W. 854.&lt;/ref&gt; Where the authority conferred upon a proxy is limited to a designated or special purpose, a vote for another and different purpose is ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;112 Ala. 228, 20 So. 744.&lt;/ref&gt; A proxy in the usual, ordinary form confers authority to act only at the meeting then in contemplation, and in any adjourned-meetings of the same; hence, it may not be voted at another or different meeting held under a ''new call''.&lt;ref&gt;150 N.C. 216, 63 S.E. 892.&lt;/ref&gt; A proxy's unauthorized acts may be [[ratified]] by his appointer, and such ratification is equivalent to previous authority.&lt;ref&gt;109 Cal. 571, 42 Pac. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the weight of authority, a proxy only to vote stock may be revoked at any time, notwithstanding any agreement that it shall be irrevocable.&lt;ref&gt;30 Fed. 91; 207 Ill. 107; 101 Ky. 570; 61 N.J. Eq. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The sale in the meantime by a stockholder of his shares in a corporation or company automatically revokes any proxies made or given to vote in respect of such shares.&lt;ref&gt;89 Fed. 397.&lt;/ref&gt; And a proxy is also revoked where the party giving it attends the election in person, or gives subsequent proxy.&lt;ref&gt;78 N.J. Eq. 484; 10 Md. 468.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, a proxy cannot vote when the owner of the stock arrives late or is present and votes.&lt;ref&gt;181 Iowa 1013, 165 N.W. 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vietnam===
In Vietnam, proxy voting was used to increase turnout. Presently, proxy voting is illegal, but it has nonetheless been occurring since before 1989. It is estimated to contribute about 20% to voter turnout, and has been described as "a convenient way to fulfil one's duty, avoid possible risks, and avoid having to participate directly in the act of voting". It is essentially a compromise between the party-state, which wants to have high turnouts as proof of public support, and voters who do not want to go to the polling stations. In the Soviet Union, proxy voting was also illegal but done in order to increase turnout figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=hfsr1lzAOGoC&amp;pg=PA145&amp;dq=%2B%22proxy+voting%22+%2Belectoral |title=Wards of Hanoi - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-18 | isbn=978-981-230-341-7|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proxy voting is automatically prohibited in organizations that have adopted [[Robert's Rules of Order|Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised]] (RONR) or [[The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure]] (TSC) as their parliamentary authority, unless it is provided for in its bylaws or charter or required by the laws of its state of incorporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#10|title = Frequently Asked Questions about RONR (Question 10)|date = |accessdate = |website = The Official Robert's Rules of Order Web Site|publisher = The Robert's Rules Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TSC/&gt; Robert's Rules says, "If the law under which an organization is incorporated allows proxy voting to be prohibited by a provision of the bylaws, the adoption of this book as parliamentary authority by prescription in the bylaws should be treated as sufficient provision to accomplish that result".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite parl|pages = 429|edition = 11th|year = 2011|title = RONR}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[George Demeter|Demeter]] says the same thing, but also states that "if these laws do ''not'' prohibit voting by proxy, the body can pass a law permitting proxy voting for any purpose desired."&lt;ref name=DEM&gt;{{cite parl|title=DEM|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; RONR opines, "Ordinarily it should neither be allowed nor required, because proxy voting is incompatible with the essential characteristics of a deliberative assembly in which membership is individual, personal, and nontransferable. In a stock corporation, on the other hand, where the ownership is transferable, the voice and vote of the member also is transferable, by use of a proxy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite parl|title = RONR|pages = 428-429|year = 2011|edition = 11th}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Riddick opines that "proxy voting properly belongs in incorporate organizations that deal with stocks or real estate, and in certain political organizations," it also states, "If a state empowers an incorporated organization to use proxy voting, that right cannot be denied in the bylaws." Riddick further opines, "Proxy voting is not recommended for ordinary use. It can discourage attendance, and transfers an inalienable right to another without positive assurance that the vote has not been manipulated."&lt;ref name=RID/&gt;

''Parliamentary Law'' expounds on this point:&lt;ref name=pl&gt;{{cite book|title=Parliamentary Law|author=Robert, Henry M.|year=1991|isbn=0-470-72592-3|pages=194–195, 564}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|It is used only in stock corporations where the control is in the majority of the stock, not in the majority of the stockholders. If one person gets control of fifty-one per cent of the stock he can control the corporation, electing such directors as he pleases in defiance of the hundreds or thousands of holders of the remaining stock. The laws for stock corporations are nearly always made on the theory that the object of the organization is to make money by carrying on a certain business, using capital supplied by a large number of persons whose control of the business should be in proportion to the capital they have put into the concern. The people who have furnished the majority of the capital should control the organization, and yet they may live in different parts of the country, or be traveling at the time of the annual meeting. By the system of proxy voting they can control the election of directors without attending the meetings.}}

Nonetheless, it is common practice in conventions for a delegate to have an alternate, who is basically the same as a proxy. [[Demeter's Manual of Parliamentary Law and Procedure|Demeter's Manual]] notes that the alternate has all the privileges of voting, debate and participation in the proceedings to which the delegate is entitled.&lt;ref name=DEM/&gt; Moreover, "if voting has for years...been conducted...by proxy...such voting by long and continuous custom has the force of law, and the proceedings are valid."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite parl|title=DEM|pages=134|edition=1969|year=1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas E. Arend notes that U.S. laws allow proxy votes to be conducted electronically in certain situations: "The use of electronic media may be permissible for proxy voting, but such voting is generally limited to members. Given the fiduciary duties that are personal to each director, and the need for directors to deliberate to ensure properly considered decisions, proxy voting by directors is usually prohibited by statute. In contrast, a number of state nonprofit corporate statutes allow for member proxy voting and may further allow members to use electronic media to grant a proxy right to another party for member voting purposes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/summary_0199-1341084_ITM|author=Arend, Thomas E.|title=Legal Implications of Electronic Governance|publisher=Association Management|date=2002-01-01|accessdate=2008-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sturgis agrees, "Directors or board members cannot vote by proxy in their meetings, since this would mean the delegation of a discretionary legislative duty which they cannot delegate."&lt;ref name=TSC&gt;{{cite parl|title=TSC|pages=147–148|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proxy voting, even if allowed, may be limited to infrequent use if the rules governing a body specify minimum attendance requirements. For instance, bylaws may prescribe that a member can be dropped for missing three consecutive meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://myfloridalegal.com/ago.nsf/Opinions/F8811A3863EA18F08525659300664072|title=Advisory Legal Opinion - AGO 78-117|author=Gleason, Patricia R.|publisher=Office of the Attorney General of Florida|date=1978-09-19|accessdate=2008-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Journal of Mental Science noted the arguments raised against adopting proxy voting for the Association. These included that possibility that it would diminish attendance at  meetings. The rejoinder was that people did not go there to vote; they attending the meetings for the sake of the meeting, the discussion, and the good fellowship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YNMVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA617&amp;dq=%22proxy+voting%22 |title=The Journal of mental science - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2006-11-20 |accessdate=2010-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate settings==
{{Main|Proxy statement}}
Under the [[common law]], shareholders had no right to cast votes by proxy in corporate meetings without special authorization. In ''Walker v. Johnson'',&lt;ref&gt;D.C. App. 144 (1900)&lt;/ref&gt; the [[District of Columbia Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia]] explained that the reason was that early corporations were of a municipal, religious or charitable nature, in which the shareholder had no pecuniary interest. The normal mode of conferring corporate rights was by an issue of a charter from the crown, essentially establishing the corporation as a part of the government. Given the personal trust placed in these voters by the king, it was inappropriate for them to delegate to others. In the Pennsylvania case of ''Commonwealth ex rel. Verree v. Bringhurst'',&lt;ref&gt;103 Pa. St. 134 (1883)&lt;/ref&gt; the court held that members of a corporation had no right to vote by proxy at a corporate election unless such right was expressly conferred by the charter or by a bylaw. The attorneys for the plaintiff argued that the common law rules had no application to trading or moneyed corporations where the relation was not personal. The court found, "The fact that it is a business corporation in no wise dispenses with the obligation of all members to assemble together, unless otherwise provided, for the exercise of a right to participate in the election of their officers." At least as early as the 18th century, however, clauses permitting voting by proxy were being inserted in corporate charters in England.&lt;ref&gt;Axe, Leonard H. ''Michigan Law Review'' Vol. 41, No. 1 (Aug. 1942) p. 38-65&lt;/ref&gt;

Proxy voting is commonly used in corporations for voting by members or shareholders, because it allows members who have confidence in the judgment of other members to vote for them and allows the assembly to have a quorum of votes when it is difficult for all members to attend, or there are too many members for all of them to conveniently meet and deliberate. [[Proxy firm]]s commonly advise institutional shareholders on how they should vote. Proxy solicitation firms assist in helping corral votes for a certain resolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foe.org/international/shareholder/solicitation.html Proxy Solicitation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080128155800/http://www.foe.org/international/shareholder/solicitation.html |date=January 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domini notes that in the corporate world, "Proxy ballots typically contain proposals from company management on issues of corporate governance, including capital structure, auditing, board composition, and executive compensation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Proxy Voting Guidelines &amp; Procedures |url=http://www.domini.com/common/pdf/ProxyVotingGuidelines.pdf |publisher=Domini Social Investments |accessdate=2008-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411094628/http://www.domini.com/common/pdf/ProxyVotingGuidelines.pdf |archivedate=2008-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proxies are essentially the corporate law equivalent of [[absentee balloting]]. Shareholders send in a card (called a proxy card) on which they mark their vote. The card authorizes a proxy agent to vote the shareholder's stock as directed on the card. The proxy card may specify how shares are to be voted or may simply give the proxy agent discretion to decide how the shares are to be voted. Under [[Securities Exchange Commission]] Rule 14a-3, the incumbent board of directors' first step in soliciting proxies must be the distribution to shareholders of the firm's annual report. An insurgent may independently prepare proxy cards and proxy statements, which are sent to the shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Complete Guide to Sarbanes-Oxley|author=Bainbridge, Stephen M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Associations of [[institutional investor]]s sometimes attempt to effect social change. For instance, several hundred faith-based institutional investors, such as denominations, pensions, etc. belong to the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility. These organizations commonly exercise influence through [[shareholder resolution]]s, which may spur management to action and lead to the resolutions' withdrawal before an actual vote on the resolution is taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iccr.org/news/press_releases/2008/pr_proxybook011508.htm |title=302 Religious/Social Investor Proxy Resolutions Slated for 2008 |publisher=Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility |date=2008-01-15 |accessdate=2008-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316192547/http://www.iccr.org/news/press_releases/2008/pr_proxybook011508.htm |archivedate=2008-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fiduciaries for ERISA and other pension plans are generally expected to vote proxies on behalf of these plans in a manner than maximizes the economic value for plan participants.  In these regard, for ERISA plans, fiduciaries and advisers are very limited in the extent to which they can take social or other goals into account.&lt;ref&gt;Lemke and Lins, ''ERISA for Money Managers'' (Thomson West, 2017-2018 ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the absence of his principal from the annual meeting of a business corporation, the proxy has the right to vote in all instances, but he has not the right to debate or otherwise participate in the proceedings unless he is a stockholder in that same corporation.&lt;ref name=DEM/&gt;

The [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] has ruled that an investment adviser who exercises voting authority over his clients' proxies has a fiduciary responsibility to adopt policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that the adviser votes proxies in the best interests of clients, to disclose to clients information about those policies and procedures, to disclose to clients how they may obtain information on how the adviser has voted their proxies, and to keep certain records related to proxy voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/ia-2106.htm|title=Final Rule: Proxy Voting by Investment Advisers|publisher=Securities Exchange Commission|date=2003-01-31|accessdate=2008-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ruling has been criticized on many grounds, including the contention that it places unnecessary burdens on investment advisers and would not have prevented the major [[accounting scandals]] of the early 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa4048/is_200301/ai_n9223584|title=Disclosure of the Irrelevant?: Impact of the SEC's Final Proxy Voting Disclosure Rules|publisher=Fordham Journal of Corporate &amp; Financial Law|author=Stewart, Brian D.|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mutual funds must report their proxy votes periodically on Form N-PX.&lt;ref&gt;Lemke, Lins and Smith, ''Regulation of Investment Companies'' (Matthew Bender, 2017 ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible for [[overvote]]s and [[undervote]]s to occur in corporate proxy situations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/spotlight/proxyprocess/proxyvotingbrief.htm Briefing Paper: Roundtable on Proxy Voting Mechanics. Retrieved March 9, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

Even in corporate settings, proxy voting's use is generally limited to voting at the annual meeting for directors, for the ratification of acts of the directors, for enlargement or diminution of capital, and for other vital changes in the policy of the organization. These proposed changes are summarized in the circular sent to shareholders prior to the annual meeting. The stock-transfer book is closed at least ten days before the annual meeting, to enable the secretary to prepare a list of stockholders and the number of shares held by each. Stock is voted as shown by the stock book when posted. All proxies are checked against this list.&lt;ref name=pl/&gt;

It is possible to designate two or more persons to act as proxy by using language appointing, for instance, "A, B, C, D, and E, F, or any of them, attorneys and agents for me, irrevocable, with full power by the affirmative vote of a majority of said attorneys and agents to appoint a substitute or substitutes for and in the name and stead of me."&lt;ref name=pl/&gt;

Proxy voting is said to have some anti-deliberative consequences, in that proxy holders often lack discretion about how to cast votes due to the instructions given by their principal. Thus, they cannot alter their decision based on the deliberative process of testing the strength of arguments and counter-arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BjW8Cfwn8FEC&amp;pg=PA135&amp;dq=%22proxy+voting%22 |title=The constitutional corporation ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-18 | first=Stephen | last=Bottomley | isbn=978-0-7546-2418-9|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, corporate proxy voting is done through banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.germanlawjournal.com/article.php?id=710 |title=Shareholder Protection in the USA and Germany - On the Fallacy of LLSV |author=Braendle, Uno C. |date=2006-03-01 |publisher=German Law Journal |accessdate=2008-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316110429/http://www.germanlawjournal.com/article.php?id=710 |archivedate=2008-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proxy voting by banks has been a key feature of the connection of banks to corporate ownership in Germany since the industrialization period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Corporate Governance Around the World|author=Morck, Randall|page=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Delegated voting==

[[File:Democracy.svg|thumb|170px|Illustration of delegated voting. Voters to the left of the blue line voted by delegation. Voters to the right voted directly. Numbers are the quantity of voters represented by each delegate, with the delegate included in the count.]]
In '''delegated voting''', the proxy is [[transitive relation|transitive]] and the transfer recursive. Put simply, the vote may be further delegated to the proxy's proxy, and so on. This is also called transitive proxy or delegate cascade.&lt;ref name='Allan-2008'&gt;{{citation |author=Michael Allan |year=2008 |title=A Medium of Assent and its Fit with Society |journal=The ITP News: Newsletter of the Information Technology and Politics Section, American Political Science Association |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=12–13| url=http://www.apsanet.org/~itp/v4n2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early proposal of delegate voting was that of [[Lewis Carroll]] in 1884.&lt;ref name='Carrol-1884'&gt;{{cite book |last=Carroll |first=Lewis |year=1884 |title=The Principles of Parliamentary Representation |publisher=Harrison and Sons |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Duncan-1969'&gt;{{cite journal |last=Black |first=Duncan |year=1969 |title=Lewis Carroll and the theory of games |journal=The American Economic Review |volume=59 |issue=2 |page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Delegate voting is used by the Swedish local political party [[Demoex]]. Demoex won their first seat in the city council of Vallentuna, [[Sweden]], in 2002. The first years of activity in the party have been evaluated by [[Mitthögskolan University]] in a paper by Karin Ottesen in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://demoex.net/files/Ottesensuppsats.pdf|title=Flexible representation by use of delegated voting - a case study of practical use|first=Karin|last=Ottesen|year=2003|accessdate=2009-02-23|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Demoex, a voter can also vote directly, even if she has delegated her vote to a proxy; the direct vote overrules the proxy vote. It is also possible to change the proxy at any time.

In 2005, in a pilot study in Pakistan, ''Structural Deep Democracy, SD2''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://groups.yahoo.com/group/sd-2/ |title=Yahoo! Groups |publisher=Groups.yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.148.9274 |title=CiteSeerX — Autopoietic Information Systems in Modern Organizations |publisher=Citeseerx.ist.psu.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; was used for leadership selection in a sustainable agriculture group called Contact Youth. SD2 uses [[PageRank]] for the processing of the transitive proxy votes, with the additional constraints of mandating at least two initial proxies per voter, and all voters are proxy candidates. More complex variants can be built on top of SD2, such as adding specialist proxies and direct votes for specific issues, but SD2 as the underlying umbrella system, mandates that generalist proxies should always be used.

Delegated voting is also used in the World Parliament Experiment, and in implementations of [[delegative democracy]], which is also known as [[liquid democracy]].

'''Restructuring''' is the [[corporate management]] term for the act of reorganizing the legal, ownership, operational, or other structures of a [[company (law)|company]] for the purpose of making it more profitable, or better organized for its present needs. Other reasons for restructuring include a change of ownership or ownership structure, [[demerger]], or a response to a crisis or major change in the business such as [[bankruptcy]], [[Positioning (marketing)#Repositioning a company|repositioning]], or [[leveraged buyout|buyout]]. Restructuring may also be described as corporate restructuring, [[debt restructuring]] and financial restructuring.

Executives involved in restructuring often hire financial and legal advisors to assist in the transaction details and negotiation. It may also be done by a new [[CEO]] hired specifically to make the difficult and controversial decisions required to save or reposition the company. It generally involves financing debt, selling portions of the company to investors, and reorganizing or reducing operations.

The basic nature of restructuring is a [[zero sum|zero-sum]] game. Strategic restructuring reduces financial losses, simultaneously reducing tensions between [[debt]] and [[Stock|equity]] holders to facilitate a prompt resolution of a distressed situation.

Corporate debt restructuring is the reorganization of companies’ outstanding liabilities. It is generally a mechanism used by companies which are facing difficulties in repaying their debts. In the process of restructuring, the credit obligations are spread out over longer duration with smaller payments. This allows company’s ability to meet debt obligations. Also, as part of process, some creditors may agree to exchange debt for some portion of equity. It is based on the principle that restructuring facilities available to companies in a timely and transparent matter goes a long way in ensuring their viability which is sometimes threatened by internal and external factors. This process tries to resolve the difficulties faced by the corporate sector and enables them to become viable again.

'''Steps:'''
*Ensure the company has enough liquidity to operate during implementation of a complete restructuring
*Produce accurate working capital forecasts
*Provide open and clear lines of communication with creditors who mostly control the company's ability to raise financing
*Update detailed business plan and considerations&lt;ref name="Practitioner"&gt;{{Cite book | author=[[Norley]], Lyndon; Swanson, Joseph; Marshall, Peter | authorlink= | coauthors= | title=A Practitioner's Guide to Corporate Restructuring | date= | publisher=City  Financial Publishing | location= | isbn=978-1-905121-31-1 | pages=xix, 24, 63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Valuations in restructuring==
In corporate restructuring, [[valuation (finance)|valuation]]s are used as [[negotiating]] tools and more than third-party reviews designed for litigation avoidance. This distinction between negotiation and process is a difference between financial restructuring and [[corporate finance]].&lt;ref name="Practitioner" /&gt;

From the point of view of [[transfer pricing]] requirements, restructuring may entail the need to pay the so-called [[exit fee]] (exit charge).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.internationaltaxreview.com/Article/3132162/Business-restructuring-Exit-charges-for-restructurings-in-Europe.html|title=Business restructuring: Exit charges for restructurings in Europe {{!}} International Tax Review|website=www.internationaltaxreview.com|access-date=2017-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restructuring in Europe==

===The "London Approach"===
Historically, European banks handled non-investment grade [[lending]] and [[capital structure]]s that were fairly straightforward. Nicknamed the "London Approach" in the UK, restructurings focused on avoiding debt write-offs rather than providing distressed companies with an appropriately sized balance sheet. This approach became impractical in the 1990s with [[private equity]] increasing demand for highly leveraged capital structures that created the market in high-yield and [[mezzanine debt]]. Increased volume of distressed debt drew in [[hedge fund]]s and credit [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]] deepened the market—trends outside the control of both the regulator and the leading commercial banks.

==Characteristics==
*Cash management and cash generation during crisis
*Impaired Loan Advisory Services (ILAS) 
*Retention of corporate management in the form of "stay bonus" payments or equity grants
*Sale of underutilized [[asset]]s, such as [[patent]]s or brands
*[[Outsourcing]] of operations such as payroll and technical support to a more efficient third party
*Moving of operations such as manufacturing to lower-cost locations
*Reorganization of functions such as sales, marketing, and distribution
*Renegotiation of labor contracts to reduce [[overhead (business)|overhead]]
*Refinancing of corporate [[debt]] to reduce interest payments
*A major [[public relations]] campaign to reposition the company with consumers
*Forfeiture of all or part of the ownership share by pre-restructuring stock holders (if the remainder represents only a fraction of the original firm, it is termed a [[stub (stock)|stub]])
*Improving the efficiency and productivity through new investments, [[R&amp;D]] and [[business engineering]].

==Results==
A company that has been restructured effectively will theoretically be leaner, more efficient, better organized, and better focused on its core business with a revised strategic and financial plan. If the restructured company was a leverage acquisition, the parent company will likely resell it at a profit if the restructuring has proven successful.

'''''Rising Sun''''' is a 1993 American [[crime film]] written and directed by [[Philip Kaufman]], starring [[Sean Connery]] (who was also an executive producer), [[Wesley Snipes]], [[Harvey Keitel]], and [[Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa]]. [[Michael Crichton]] and Michael Backes wrote the screenplay, based on Crichton's [[Rising Sun (novel)|novel of the same name]].&lt;ref name="WVrev"&gt;''[[Variety Film Reviews|Variety]]'' film review; August 2, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
During a commencement gala at the newly opened Los Angeles headquarters of Nakamoto, a Japanese [[keiretsu]], a [[call girl]] named Cheryl Lynn Austin, is found dead, apparently after a violent sexual encounter. Police Detectives Webster "Web" Smith and John Connor, a former police captain and expert on Japanese affairs, are sent to act as liaison between the Japanese executives and the investigating officer, Smith's former partner Tom Graham. During the initial investigation, Connor and Smith review surveillance camera footage, and realize that one of the discs is missing.

Smith and Connor suspect Eddie Sakamura, Cheryl's [[yakuza]] boyfriend, of killing her, and interrogate him at a house party. Sakamura promises to bring Connor something, and Connor reluctantly lets him go after confiscating his passport. Ishihara, a Nakamoto employee whom Connor had previously interrogated, delivers the missing disc, which clearly shows Sakamura killing Cheryl. Graham and Smith lead a SWAT raid on Sakamura's house. He tries to flee in a sports car, but crashes and is killed.

Smith learns that Sakamura had attempted to contact him about the missing disc, so he and Connor take the disc to an expert, Jingo Asakuma, who reveals that the disc has been digitally altered to implicate Sakamura. 

Nakamoto is in the midst of sensitive negotiations for the acquisition of an American [[Semiconductor industry|semiconductor company]], with Senator John Morton, a guest at the party, abruptly changing his stance on a bill that would prevent the merger from going through. Suspecting his sudden shift is somehow related to the murder, Connor and Smith attempt to interview him at his campaign office, but without success. Upon returning to Smith's apartment, the duo find Sakamura alive and well. He reveals that he was being tailed that day by Tanaka, a Nakamoto security agent attempting to locate the original disc. Not wanting to be seen with Sakamura, Tanaka stole his sports car and committed suicide by crashing it. Sakamura gives Connor the original disc, but before he can leave, Lt. Graham arrives with Ishihara. Sakamura is killed fighting off Ishihara's men, and Smith is shot and left for dead, surviving only thanks to a bulletproof vest.

After being interrogated, Smith is put on paid leave due to an ongoing investigation of an earlier corruption charge. Regrouping with Connor and Jingo, the three view the original surveillance footage, which shows Senator Morton performing [[erotic asphyxiation]] on Cheryl. Falsely believing he killed her, Morton changes his position on the regulation bill to stay in Nakamoto's good graces. After leaving the boardroom, the footage shows another figure approaching and killing Cheryl by strangulation.

Hoping to draw the killer out, Connor and Smith fax Morton stills of the footage showing his involvement in the murder. Morton contacts Ishihara, revealing the executive to be in on the cover-up, and then Morton commits suicide. Connor, Smith, and Jingo interrupt the merger negotiations to show Nakamoto President Yoshida the surveillance footage. Bob Richmond, an American lawyer working for Nakamoto, reveals himself as the killer and tries to run away, only to be killed by Sakamura's friends.

Yoshida maintains his and his colleagues innocence, quietly exiling Ishihara to a desk job back in Japan. Smith drives Jingo home, where she casts doubt on whether Richmond was really the murderer, or if he was simply taking the fall to protect someone higher up in the company.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2489">The '''[[Robert Byrd|Robert C. Byrd]] Honors Scholarship Program''' was a federally funded and state-administered [[Merit-based financial aid|merit-based]] scholarship program in the United States.

== Program History ==
It was designed to recognize exceptionally able high school seniors who showed promise of continued excellence in postsecondary education. The [[United States Department of Education]]'s [[Office of Postsecondary Education]] awarded funds to state education agencies, which awarded [[scholarships]] (also known as '''Byrd Honors Scholarships''') to eligible applicants. Students received scholarship funds which were to go towards [[college]] expenses.

=== Funding ===
The Byrd Honors Scholarships were established in 1985, providing $1,500 nonrenewable scholarships to eligible students. In 1993, the program was expanded to allow students who successfully completed their first year of college to reapply for stipends for the following three years. This brought the scholarship to its final value of $6,000 over four years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://byrd.senate.gov/issues/byrd_education/byrd_education.html Byrd.senate.gov] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081031004216/http://byrd.senate.gov/issues/byrd_education/byrd_education.html |date=2008-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To pay for the over 27,000 scholars supported by the program, appropriations for the program were nearly $40,000,000 annually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ed.gov/programs/iduesbyrd/gtepiduesbyrd.pdf Ed.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding for the scholarship was eliminated for the 2011-2012 school year. As a result, new awards are not being given for that year, and payments for returning students will not be distributed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hesc.com/content.nsf/SFC/Robert_C_Byrd_Honors_Scholarship]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application Requirements ==
Each state set the criteria for awarding the Byrd Honors Scholarships in addition to federal requirements. In any case, all applicants were to be high school graduates who:
* had been accepted for enrollment at institutions of higher education(IHEs) in the United States;
* had demonstrated outstanding academic achievement;
* and who showed promise of continued academic excellence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11981">A '''secured loan''' is a [[loan]] in which the borrower pledges some asset (e.g. a car or property) as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] for the loan, which then becomes a '''secured debt''' owed to the creditor who gives the loan. The debt is thus secured against the collateral, and if the borrower [[default (finance)|defaults]], the creditor takes possession of the asset used as collateral and may sell it to regain some or all of the amount originally loaned to the borrower. An example is the [[foreclosure]] of a home. From the creditor's perspective, that is a category of [[debt]] in which a lender has been granted a portion of the [[bundle of rights]] to specified property. If the sale of the collateral does not raise enough money to pay off the debt, the creditor can often obtain a [[deficiency judgment]] against the borrower for the remaining amount.

The opposite of secured debt/loan is [[unsecured debt]], which is not connected to any specific piece of property. Instead, the creditor may satisfy the debt only against the borrower, rather than the borrower's collateral and the borrower. Generally speaking, secured debt may attract lower interest rates than unsecured debt because of the added security for the lender; however, credit risk (e.g. credit history, and ability to repay) and expected returns for the lender are also factors affecting rates.&lt;ref name="McCormack2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gerard McCormack|title=Secured credit under English and American law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=csTgg-F1EpsC&amp;pg=PA16|accessdate=13 December 2011|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-82670-9|pages=16–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''secured loan'' is used in the United Kingdom, but the United States more commonly uses ''secured debt''.

==Purpose==
There are two purposes for a loan secured by debt. In the first purpose, by extending the loan through securing the debt, the creditor is relieved of most of the financial risks involved because it allows the [[creditor]] to take ownership of the property in the event that the debt is not properly repaid. In exchange, this permits the second purpose where the [[debtor]]s may receive [[loan]]s on more favorable terms than that available for [[unsecured debt]], or to be extended [[Credit (finance)|credit]] under circumstances when [[Credit (finance)|credit]] under terms of [[unsecured debt]] would not be extended at all. The creditor may offer a loan with attractive interest rates and repayment periods for the secured debt.

==Types==
*A [[mortgage loan]] is a secured loan in which the collateral is property, such as a home.
*A [[nonrecourse debt|nonrecourse loan]] is a secured loan where the collateral is the only security or claim the creditor has against the borrower, and the creditor has no further recourse against the borrower for any deficiency remaining after foreclosure against the property.
*A [[foreclosure]] is a legal process in which mortgaged property is sold to pay the debt of the defaulting borrower.
*A [[repossession]] is a process in which property, such as a car, is taken back by the creditor when the borrower does not make payments due on the property. Depending on the jurisdiction, it may or may not require a court order.

==UK secured loan market==
Before the global economic crisis of 2006, the [[Financial Services Authority]] (FSA) estimated that the UK secured loan market had a net worth of £7,000,000,000. However, following the close of [[Lehman Brothers]]' sub-prime lender BNC Mortgage in August 2007, the UK's most prominent secured loan providers were forced to withdraw from the market.

Previous to this, secured loans fell under the remit of the Office of Fair Trading and firms issuing and brokering secured loans required no authorisation from the FCA. The FCA's involvement dramatically changed the secured loan landscape by putting into place more protection for the consumer.
* '''21st March 2016''': the FCA introduced The Mortgage Credit Directive&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/mortgage-credit-directive|title=Mortgage Credit Directive|last=|first=|date=22 August 2017|website=FCA|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which meant all regulated first-charge and second-charge mortgage contracts are treated in exactly the same way. The MCD was set up to protect consumers by governing first- and second-charge mortgage markets (as well as consumer buy-to-lets) under the same regulation, and to provide a harmonised approach to mortgage regulation across the EU. Following the introduction of the MCD mortgage brokers and advisers were required to inform their clients that a second-charge mortgage could be a better alternative to a remortgage or further advance.

==United States law==
The United States is the global leader in [[security interest]] law with respect to personal property; in the 1940s, it was the first country to develop and enact the notion of a "unified" security interest. That concept has since spread to many countries around the world after it became evident that it is one of the reasons for why the United States has the strongest economy in the world.{{dubious|reason=pinning this as "one of the reasons" requires a strong support in reliable sources|date=November 2018}}{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} For example, to raise money, American ranchers could pledge personal property like cattle in certain ways that historically were impossible or very difficult in Uruguay or most other developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;Heywood Fleisig, [http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/1996/06/pdf/fleisig.pdf "Secured Transactions: The Power of Collateral,"] ''Finance and Development'', 44–46.&lt;/ref&gt; However, US law with respect to security interests in real property is still{{When|date=November 2018}} extremely chaotic and non-uniform. The [[Uniform Law Commission]] in the 1970s and 1980s worked hard to develop [[uniform act]]s to clean it up but the project was a catastrophic failure.&lt;ref&gt;Marion W. Benfield, Jr., ''Wasted Days and Wasted Nights: Why the Land Acts Failed'', 20 Nova L. Rev. 1037, 1037–41 (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Benton Brown, ''Whatever Happened to the Uniform Land Transactions Act?'' 20 Nova L. Rev. 1017 (1996);&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter B. Maggs, ''The Uniform Simplification of Land Transfers Act and the Politics and Economics of Law Reform,'' 20 Nova L. Rev. 1091, 1091–92 (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of [[real estate]], the most common form of '''secured debt''' is the [[lien]]. Liens may either be voluntarily created, as with a [[mortgage law|mortgage]], or involuntarily created, such as a [[mechanics lien]]. A mortgage may only be created with the express consent of the [[title owner]], without regard to other facts of the situation. In contrast, the primary condition required to create a [[mechanics lien]] is that [[real estate]] is somehow improved through the [[manual labour|work]] or materials provided by the person filing a [[mechanics lien]]. Although the rules are complex, consent of the [[title owner]] to the [[mechanics lien]] itself is not required.

In the case of [[personal property]], the most common procedure for securing the [[debt]] is regulated under Article 9 of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] (UCC). This uniform act provides a relatively uniform interstate system of forms and public filing of documents by which the [[creditor]] establishes the priority of their security interest in the [[property]] of the debtor. 

In the event that the underlying [[debt]] is not properly paid, the [[creditor]] may decide to [[foreclose]] the interest in order to take the [[property]]. Generally, the law that allows the '''secured debt''' to be made also provides a procedure whereby the property will be sold at [[public auction]], or through some other means of sale. The law commonly also provides a [[right of redemption]], whereby a debtor may arrange for late payment of the [[debt]] but keep the property.

===How secured debt is created===
Debt can become secured by a [[contractual agreement]], [[Lien#Statutory liens|statutory lien]], or [[judgment lien]]. Contractual agreements can be secured by either a [[security interest|purchase money security interest]] (PMSI) loan, where the creditor takes a security interest in the items purchased (i.e. vehicle, furniture, electronics); or, a [[non-purchase money security interest]] (NPMSI) loan, where the creditor takes a security interest in items that the debtor already owns.

'''Taskwarrior''' is an open-source, cross platform [[Time management|time]] and [[task management]] tool. It has a [[command-line interface]] rather than a [[graphical user interface]].

Taskwarrior uses concepts and techniques described in ''[[Getting Things Done]]'' by [[David Allen (author)|David Allen]], but is paradigm-agnostic in that it does not require users to adhere to any given life-management philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;https://taskwarrior.org/docs/start.html&lt;/ref&gt;

According to its author, Taskwarrior was created "to address layout and feature issues"&lt;ref&gt;[http://taskwarrior.org/wiki/taskwarrior/About About Taskwarrior], {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100408100712/http://taskwarrior.org/wiki/taskwarrior/About |date=April 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Todo.txt applications popularized by [[Gina Trapani]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://todotxt.com/ Todo.txt] Future-proof task tracking in a file you control&lt;/ref&gt;

With ''Timewarrior,'' the authors offer an accompanying tool to track time spent on projects.&lt;ref&gt;http://taskwarrior.org/news/news.20160620.html&lt;/ref&gt; Configuration allows e. g. to define recurring breaks such as lunch time.&lt;ref&gt;http://taskwarrior.org/docs/timewarrior/workweek.html&lt;/ref&gt; The documention notes that "Timewarrior focusses on accurately recording time already spent, whereas Taskwarrior looks forward to work that is not yet done."&lt;ref&gt;http://taskwarrior.org/docs/timewarrior/backdated.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Availability==
Taskwarrior's source code is freely available and can be compiled and run on a variety of architectures and operating systems, or installed using binaries obtained with common package management tools: ([[Advanced Packaging Tool|apt]], [[Fink]], [[Yellowdog Updater, Modified|yum]], [[DNF (software)|dnf]], pkgng, pkg_add, etc.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://tasktools.org/gitweb/?p=task.git;a=blob;f=NEWS;h=6f87bea2840e2f2f1948125e37a4e1f3091546a4;hb=2.0.0 Task 2.0.0 NEWS file]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Typical Workflow==
Taskwarrior comprises three main commands: ''add'', ''list'', and ''done.'' All other functionality – recurrences, tags, priorities, etc. – are optional.

===Adding a task===
&lt;source lang="console"&gt;
$ task add Pick up keys to the new apartment
Created task 1.
&lt;/source&gt;
===Listing Tasks===
&lt;source lang="console"&gt;
$ task list
ID Project Pri Due Active Age    Description                      
1                        4 secs Pick up keys to the new apartment
1 task
&lt;/source&gt;

===Marking a task as completed===
&lt;source lang="console"&gt;
$ task 1 done
Completed 1 'Pick up keys to the new apartment'.
Marked 1 task as done.
&lt;/source&gt;
===Creating a task with due dates, recurrences, and tags===
&lt;source lang="console"&gt;
$ task add Mow the lawn project:Lawnwork due:tomorrow recur:biweekly +home
Created task 1.
&lt;/source&gt;

==Syncing==
When used in conjunction with Taskserver, can sync tasks into the cloud, and indirectly with other clients/devices.

'''Thames Valley Park''' is a high-tech [[business park]] adjacent to the [[River Thames]] on the eastern outskirts of [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] in the [[England|English]] county of [[Berkshire]].

==Location and companies==
The park partially lies within the [[civil parish]] of [[Sonning]]. Close by are the [[Ali's Pond Local Nature Reserve]], with paths and large ponds, and [[Sonning Hill]].

Companies based at the park include [[BBC Radio Berkshire]], [[Steria]], [[Silicon Graphics|SGI]], [[Regus]], [[BG Group]], [[Websense]], [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], [[Microsoft]], [[OpenText]] and [[ING Direct]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Companies|url=http://www.thamesvalleypark.co.uk/index.php#bggroup|publisher=Thames Valley Business Park|accessdate=21 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport links==
The park is at the northern terminus of the A3290 (formerly part of the [[A329(M) motorway|A329(M)]]) giving good connections to the [[M4 motorway|M4]] and [[A4 road (Great Britain)|A4]]. Originally the A329(M) was supposed to follow the river west from the park towards a junction with Vastern Road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pathetic.org.uk/current/a329m/maps/a329m-extension.shtml|title=AA map showing A329(M) extension|accessdate=2007-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a [[Zero-fare public transport|free bus service]] between Thames the park and [[Reading railway station]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gogoldline.co.uk/thamesvalleybusinesspark.php4|title=Reading Station and Town Centre to Thames Valley Park|accessdate=2007-07-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20040208185051/http://www.gogoldline.co.uk/thamesvalleybusinesspark.php4|archivedate=8 February 2004|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; with good connections for [[London]] and [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow Airport]].

A railway station to serve the park was proposed in the 1998 [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading Borough]] Local Plan,&lt;ref&gt;http://ww2.reading.gov.uk/documents/servingyou/planning/borough_plan/bp_appendix8.pdf{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; on the site of the [[coal]] [[Siding (rail)|sidings]] of the closed [[Earley]] [[power station]]. As at April 2013, the station had not been built.


==The Development==
The project was commenced by Speyhawk who went into receivership in 1993. Argent Group acquired the site and went on to complete the development in phases. It is built on well over a million cubic metres of pulverised fuel ash, from the power station, to bury the ash, gravels were extracted, and used for the construction of the A329(M) extension, this funded a large part of both the Reading Cross Town Route (A329(M) ) (Thames valley Park Drive)  and TVP development. The works were under two separate contracts, completed by Fairclough Civil Engineering - Egham Office. There is a deep pumping station for the development in the centre of the TVP roundabout installed by Trant Contractors. Access is through a tunnel under the Paddington to Exeter railway line from Sutton Seeds Roundabout, dig using the driven shoe method, then precast tunnel sections were installed as linings.

The green park is not a natural feature, it was built at the end of the developments, ensuring the flood plain was reinstated and biodiversity improved.

Evidence of the old power station is now restricted to a V shaped ditch, running into the Thames near the TVP roundabout to the north west, this was shortened to the point where the outfall of TVP stormwater drainage, and A329(m) drainage meet.

Access west into the Reading town, was designed into the roundabout adjacent to the railway line, its levels and layout reflect this, which in some way make its current configuration notable.

The road was one of the first designed using ground probing radar, which identified some soft ground features prior to commencement of works. The dual carriageway is constructed on a geotextile, because of the soft nature of the floodplain, and raised above it to avoid disruption during flooding, the roadways is then built upon a layer of chalk to sub-base level.
