An '''anti-fairy tale''', also called '''anti-tale''', is a [[fairy tale]]  which, unlike an ordinary one, has a tragic, rather than a [[happy ending]], with the antagonists winning and the protagonists losing at the end of the story. Whereas fairy tales paint a magical, utopian world, anti-fairy tales paint a dark world of nastiness and cruelty. Such stories incorporate [[Horror fiction|horror]], [[black comedy]], mean-spirited [[practical joke]]s on innocent characters, sudden and often cruel [[plot twist]]s, and biting [[satire]].&lt;ref name=grenc&gt;''The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Folktales and Fairy Tales: A-F'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Jdx2fhPM1XIC&amp;pg=PA50 article "Anti-fairy tale", p. 50]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cada&gt;Catriona McAra, David Calvin, ''Anti-Tales: The Uses of Disenchantment'', Cambridge Scholars Publishing, May 25, 2011, {{ISBN|1443830550}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nQcrBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4 p. 4]&lt;/ref&gt; The term ({{lang-de|'Antimärchen'}}) was introduced by {{Interlanguage link multi|Andrè Jolles|de|3=Johannes Andreas Jolles}}&lt;ref name=grenc/&gt; in his ''Einfache Formen'' (1930).&lt;ref&gt;André Jolles: Einfache Formen. Legende, Sage, Mythe, Rätsel, Spruch, Kasus, Memorabile, Märchen, Witz. Niemeyer, Halle (Saale) 1930 (Forschungsinstitut für Neuere Philologie Leipzig: Neugermanistische Abteilung; 2) [http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/joll001einf01_01/joll001einf01_01_0008.php p. 242].&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of anti-fairy tales include "[[The Fisherman and His Wife]]" and "[[The Swineherd]]".&lt;ref name=grenc/&gt; The term is also used to refer to remakes of traditional "happy" fairy tales into "unhappy" ones.&lt;ref name=cada/&gt; The ''[[Shrek (franchise)|Shrek]]'' film series, which parodies and satirises fairy tales, includes several elements of anti-fairy tales such as the deaths of heroic characters and [[toilet humour|scatalogical humour]].

'''Art Jewelry Forum (AJF)''' is a nonprofit international organization founded in 1997 that advocates for the field of contemporary [[art jewelry]] through education, discourse, publications, grants, and awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artjewelryforum.org/about-ajf|title=About AJF|work=artjewelryforum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
Art Jewelry Forum publishes online articles as well as in print books. AJF’s online articles cover historical pieces and movements, theoretical interpretations of work, and exhibition reviews. Contributors for the online articles include staff writers as well as professionals in the field. Printed books from Art Jewelry Forum include ''Geography'' (exhibition catalog), ''AJF Best of Interviews'', and ''Show and Tales''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artjewelryforum.org/bookstore/ajf-publications%7ctitle=Bookstore%7cwork=artjewelryforum.org%7ctitle=Bookstore%7cwork=artjewelryforum.org|title=Bookstore|work=artjewelryforum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Art jewelry Forum also initiated and funded the publication of ''Contemporary Jewelry in Perspective'' by Lark Crafts.

The exhibition catalog ''Geography'' was Art Jewelry Forum's first publication in 2011. ''Geography'' was printed in conjunction with an exhibition of the same name that was presented at SOFA Chicago 2011 and at the [[Society of North American Goldsmiths]] conference in Seattle of 2011.

Art Jewelry Forum worked with Lark Crafts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://larkcrafts.com/jewelry-beading/announcing-contemporary-jewelry-in-perspective/|title=Announcing "Contemporary Jewelry in Perspective" «  Lark Crafts|work=larkcrafts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; a subsidiary of [[Sterling Publishing]], in 2013 to publish ''Contemporary Jewelry in Perspective''. ''Contemporary Jewelry in Perspective'' is broken into three sections "the first exploring what kind of thing contemporary jewelry is, the second exploring its history, and the third exploring opportunities and challenges for the field".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://craftcouncil.org/magazine/article/assume-nothing|title=Assume Nothing|work=craftcouncil.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bruce Metcalf]] reviews that within these sections "There are two themes that run throughout the book. One is that studio jewelry should be critical. The other is that the most fertile territory for the present-day practitioner is in the realm of the hybrid."&lt;ref&gt;Metcalf, Bruce. "Under the Covers: Contemporary Jewelry in Perspective". ''Metalsmith Magazine'' March, 2014. Volume 34 Number 2. Pg. 16-17. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

''AJF Best of Interviews'' was published in 2014 by Art Jewelry Forum. ''AJF Best of Interviews'' "corrals some of the site’s most interesting content: interviews with jewelry makers and others central to the field. Taking part in the 20 lively conversations are makers such as Lola Brooks, [[Tanel Veenre]], and Jamie Bennett; dealers such as Sienna Patti; curators such as Bruce Pepich and Ursula Ilse-Neuman; and jewelry aficionados such as [[Madeleine Albright]]... The focus is on intelligent questions and the voices of the interviewees – captured in fresh, informal exchanges that will captivate lovers of art jewelry"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://craftcouncil.org/magazine/article/fresh-perspectives|title=Fresh Perspectives|work=craftcouncil.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; writes Monica Moses, editor in chief at the ''American Craft Magazine'' published by the [[American Craft Council]].

''Show and Tales'' published by Art Jewelry Forum in 2015 and was released in Munich in conjunction with the annual Schmuck fair. ''Show and Tales'' focuses on exhibition making in regards to jewelry, making it the first ever publication on the topic.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} ''Show and Tales'' is broken into three sections that cover historical landmark exhibitions of jewelry, challenges in curating craft and jewelry, and exhibition reviews. It contains essays by Glenn Adamson (USA), David Beytelmann (AR), Susan Cummins (USA), {{Interlanguage link multi|Liesbeth den Besten|nl}} (NL), Monica Gaspar (ES), Toni Greenbaum (USA), Marthe Le Van (USA), Benjamin Lignel (FR), Kellie Riggs (USA), Damian Skinner (NZ), {{Interlanguage link multi|Jorunn Veiteberg|no}} (NO), Namita Wiggers (USA), among others.

===Exhibition Award===

An '''art blog''' is a common type of [[blog]] that comments on art.  More recently, as with other types of blogs, some art blogs have taken on 'web 2.0' social networking features.  Art blogs that adopt this sort of change can develop to become a source of information on art events (listings and maps), a way to share information and images, or virtual meeting ground.

Art blogs entries cover different topics, from art critiques and commentary to insider art world gossip, auction results, art news, personal essays, portfolios, interviews, artists’ journals, art marketing advice and artist biographies. Some artists use art blogs as a form of new media art project.

Art blogs may also serve as a forum to reach out to anybody interested in art — be it painting, sculpture, print making, creative photography, video art, conceptual art or new media. In this way, they may be visited not only for the practitioners of different forms of art, but also collectors, connoisseurs, and critics.

==Mainstream media==
In 2011, art critic [[Brian Sherwin]] interviewed art critic Mat Gleason of [[Coagula Art Journal]] for Faso.com's FineArtViews blog. The interview between Sherwin and Gleason focused on [[contemporary art]] criticism and the role of art blog’s in present-day [[art criticism]] among other issues. Gleason suggested to Sherwin that art blogs and the development of new media have become a "''blow''" to traditional print art magazines. Gleason and Sherwin also discussed how [[bloggers]] form a "''pack mentality''" based on region and perceived significance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faso.com/fineartviews/27987/fineartviews-interview-mat-gleason-art-critic-and-founder-of-coagula-art-journal "FineArtViews Interview: Mat Gleason -- Art Critic and Founder of Coagula Art Journal"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218141116/http://faso.com/fineartviews/27987/fineartviews-interview-mat-gleason-art-critic-and-founder-of-coagula-art-journal |date=18 December 2011 }}, Faso.com - FineArtViews. Retrieved 7 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/02/26/fineartsviews-interviews-_n_828719.html "FineArtViews Interviews Mat Gleason, Art Critic/Founder of Coagula"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420061624/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/02/26/fineartsviews-interviews-_n_828719.html |date=20 April 2012 }}, Huffington Post. Retrieved 7 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 28, 2009, Art Connect produced an in-depth interview by Peter Cowling for [[Art Connect]] and Jessica Palmer of [[Bioephemera]].  The interview, titled It is not Really Bloggers vs. Journalists, You Know,&lt;ref&gt;Cowling, Peter and Palmer, Jessica, "It is not Really Bloggers vs. Journalists, You Know", April 2009 {{cite web|url=http://www.loveart-gallery.com/art-blog-reviews/2009/04/27/extraordinary-art-blogs-series-part-seven-it-is-not-really-bloggers-vs-journalists-you-know |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090701133911/http://www.loveart-gallery.com/art-blog-reviews/2009/04/27/extraordinary-art-blogs-series-part-seven-it-is-not-really-bloggers-vs-journalists-you-know/ |archivedate=1 July 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; pointed to five trends that were shaping the communication and discussion of art on the internet, and that the real picture was much bigger than just the bloggers vs. journalists that had been discussed to date.  These five points were:

* Media convergence will continue to improve consumer choice, providing a better match between desire and availability.
* Content producers are just that.  Consumers care less about how and where they can get the content they want.  What they do consistently care about is the quality of the content, and whether the content is produced to their timescales.
* The content producer-to-content consumer relationship is changing.  Requests for feedback and further debate have been partially overtaken by things like conversations, and further fragmentation will certainly occur.
* Information technology and systems, provided as commodity (pay-as-you-go) services.  Such services range from processing and storage, through to credit card processing and super-fast content delivery.
* The economic downrun.

On January 8, 2009, Regina Hackett, art critic of the [[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]], noted in her article Art Blogs Hit Wikipedia &lt;ref&gt;Hackett, Regina, "Art Blogs Hit Wikipedia." ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'', January 2009. {{cite web |url=http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/art/archives/159041.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720231949/http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/art/archives/159041.asp |archivedate=20 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; that commercially run, mainstream media supported, art blogs face issues of acceptance among the independent art blogging community.

On January 7, 2009, ''[[The Village Voice]]'' art critic Martha Schwendener suggests that art blogs have helped shape a more laissez-faire climate for art writing. "Art blogs have created a new, largely unedited, admirably 'unprofessional'—hence, democratic—venue for people to speak their minds, gossip, or theorize about art."&lt;ref&gt;Schwendener, Martha, "What Crisis? Some Promising Futures for Art Criticism." ''The Village Voice'', January 2009. {{cite web |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2009-01-07/art/what-crisis-some-promising-futures-for-art-criticism/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116123956/http://www.villagevoice.com/2009-01-07/art/what-crisis-some-promising-futures-for-art-criticism |archivedate=16 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2008, the ''[[Brooklyn Rail]]'' contributor [[James Kalm]] produced an article titled "Virtually Overwhelmed.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brooklynrail.org/2008/09/artseen/brooklyn-dispatches-virtually-overwhelmed Kalm, James, "Virtually Overwhelmed." ''Brooklyn Rail''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105114244/http://www.brooklynrail.org/2008/09/artseen/brooklyn-dispatches-virtually-overwhelmed |date=5 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A practicing artist and video blogger himself, Kalm has this to say about art blogs, "The art blogosphere is a work in progress, and you’ve got to be vigilant of hidden agendas. As with anything online, take it with a grain of salt. Have fun, speak out, but don’t let it cut too much into your studio time; you might end up in a twelve step-program."

In the November 2007 issue of ''[[Art in America]]'', [[Peter Plagens]] contributed "Report from the Blogosphere: The New Grass Roots."&lt;ref&gt;Plagens, Peter, "Report from the Blogosphere: The New Grass Roots." ''Art in America'', November 2007. [http://madsilence.wordpress.com/2008/02/03/the-future-of-the-art-blog/]&lt;/ref&gt; Plagens convened a round table of veteran art bloggers, who conversed via email on a range of questions, aimed at getting a better understanding of what art blogs were, how they were run, and their relationship with the mainstream media.

In an October 2007 article for artnet Magazine, critic Charlie Finch suggested that art critiques and reviews by art bloggers are overrated and lengthy, and implied that the art blogging community was overly insular.&lt;ref&gt;Finch, Charlie, "A NOT-SO-VAST RIGHT-WING CONSPIRACY" ''artnet Magazine'', {{cite web |url=http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/features/finch/finch10-26-07.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418041306/http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/features/finch/finch10-26-07.asp |archivedate=18 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The article includes several ''ad hominen'' arguments against specific art bloggers, and ventures the opinion that art blogs "have no readers".

In the January 2005 issue of ''[[Art in America]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Rubinstein, Rafael, "Art in the Blogoshere." ''Art in America'', "Front Page," January 2005. {{cite web |url=http://www.firstpulseprojects.com/frontpageaia.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807172818/http://www.firstpulseprojects.com/frontpageaia.pdf |archivedate=7 August 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Raphael Rubinstein mentioned several blogs in the magazine's "Front Page" section, where he penned a brief, annotated survey of 12 art blogs that he found "to be worth regular visits.". Rubinstein opined that "art-related blogs" had not, at the time, become as consequential as blogs in other fields such as poetry or politics.

In December 2008, the art blog [[Maurice Benayoun|The Dump]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-dump.net/|title=The-dump|author=|date=|website=www.the-dump.net|accessdate=23 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180212143100/http://the-dump.net/|archivedate=12 February 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the new-media artist [[Maurice Benayoun]] dumped hundreds of undone art projects, was the first to become a doctorate thesis in art and art science in and of itself: ''Artistic Intentions at Work, Hypothesis for Committing Art'' Université Pantheon Sorbonne (December 6, 2008)

'''Arts Initiative Tokyo''' (AIT) a not-for-profit independent collective of [[curator]]s and [[art]] [[Management|administrator]]s based in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]. It is especially concerned with [[contemporary art]].

==Information==
It was founded in 2001 by six curators and arts administrators: Yuko Ozawa (Director), Yoko Miyahara ([[Mori Art Museum]]), Keisuke Ozawa (independent curator, Associate Director Art Fair Tokyo, lecturer Joshibi), Yasu Nakamori (Curator, Lecturer, Houston), Fumihiko Sumitomo (independent curator) and Roger McDonald (independent curator, lecturer [[Meiji University]], Joshibi). 

AIT was registered as a non profit organisation (NPO) by the City of Tokyo in 2002.

==Initiatives==
Its main initiatives are: Tokyo's first systematic artist in residence program partnering with organisations such as [[IASPIS]], [[Asialink]] and FRAME, and an independent contemporary art school called MAD.

==Artist Residence Program==
The artist in residence program has hosted many artists and curators from around the world. Most stay in AIT's refurbished traditional Japanese store-house in Yukigaya, Tokyo. Most residencies is for three months, although curators tend to come for one month. The residency program is not an open application one, instead operating on a partnership model, with various international arts organisations and Japanese Foundations.  

MAD is an acronym for Making Art Different. It offered the first course in curatorial studies in Japan in 2001. In 2011 MAD ceased offering courses and instead initiated a flexible, self-selecting system in which students purchase numbers of lectures to create their own course of study. 111 lectures are offered in 2011.

AIT does not hold a permanent exhibition space, rather working out of an office/ classroom in the  area [[Daikanyama]] of Tokyo.

"'''Bookland'''" is the informal name for the [[Unique Country Code]] (UCC) prefix allocated in the 1980s for [[European Article Number]] (EAN) identifiers of published [[book]]s, regardless of country of origin, so that the EAN [[namespace]] can catalogue books by [[International Standard Book Number|ISBN]] rather than maintaining a redundant parallel numbering system. In other words, Bookland is a fictitious country that exists solely in EAN for the purposes of non-geographically cataloguing books in the otherwise geographically keyed EAN coding system.

== History ==
Until January 1, 2007, all ISBNs were allocated as 9-digit numbers followed by a [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] 11 [[checksum]] character that was either a decimal digit or the letter X.  A Bookland EAN was generated by concatenating the Bookland UCC 978, the 9 digits of the book's ISBN other than its checksum, and the EAN checksum digit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.isbn-information.com/the-13-digit-isbn.html Anatomy of a 13-digit ISBN]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d5Z5I3gnFh0C&amp;pg=PA265 |title=Elementary number theory with applications |author=Thomas Koshy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since parts of the 10-character ISBN space are nearly full, all books published from 2007 on have been allocated a 13-digit [[ISBN]], which is identical to the Bookland EAN.  Most of UCC 979  (formerly "Musicland") has now been assigned for the expansion of Bookland,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KjveruEBBfoC&amp;pg=PT41 |title=Book Marketing Demystified |author=Bruce Trelawny Batchelor}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was first used by publishers in the French language, which can now use the additional prefix "979-10-" in addition to the nearly full "978-2-" prefix (onto which legacy 10-character ISBNs starting with "2-" have been remapped).  Books numbered with prefixes other than 978 will not be mappable to 10-character ISBNs.

The GS1 is the global identification standards organization for retail. Every country has an assigned country code which precedes the company code. The "country codes" 978 and 979 are now officially registered for allocation by the [[International ISBN Agency]], which maintains the official international registry of ISBN numbers allocated to book publishers.

==Similar mappings==

* [[ISSN]]s (which identify [[periodical publication]]s) are mapped into the UCC 977.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jKcpAQAAIAAJ |title=International literary market place |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8128">'''Bottled Ocean''' was an exhibition of work by New Zealand artists of Pacific Island descent that was shown at a number of metropolitan art galleries in New Zealand in 1994-1995. It featured the work artists who have become notable figures in New Zealand and internationally.

==Curatorial intent==

Jim Vivieaere, a New Zealand artist of Rarotongan descent, was commissioned by touring exhibition company Exhibitour to curate an exhibition of contemporary Pacific Island artists. [[City Gallery Wellington]] was a partner in the exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bottled Ocean|url=http://citygallery.org.nz/exhibitions/bottled-ocean|website=City Gallery Wellington|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Te Ara'&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mahina-Tuai|first1=Kolokesa Uafa|title=Pacific arts in New Zealand - Visual art and literature'|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/photograph/44240/bottled-ocean-1994|website=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=16 June 2015|date=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhibition was not a straightforward survey or 'celebration' of Pacific artists. Organising the exhibition turned Vivieaere into a spokesperson or authority on Pacific Island art, a position he was uneasy with.&lt;ref name ='Paradise'&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chiu|first1=Melissa|last2=Stevenson|first2=Karen|last3=Mason|first3=Ngahiraka|last4=Vercoe|first4=Caroline|title=Paradise now? : contemporary art from the Pacific|date=2004|publisher=David Bateman in association with Asia Society|location=Auckland|isbn=1869535847}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|26}} He was concerned that the exhibition could lead to artists being pigeon-holed or 'ghettoised' or that stereotypes of the 'exotic' Pacific could be reinforced.&lt;ref name ='Paradise'/&gt;{{Rp|26–27}} In one interview Vivieaere said that the ‘only reason we are here is that we are Polynesian – not on our merits but because we’re the "other"…. We don’t need Polynesian shows. I would like to see it as the last.’&lt;ref name ='Te Ara'/&gt;

==Artists==

Vivieaere selected a broad range of artists who worked in a variety of media and were at different stages of their careers.&lt;ref name='Te Ara'/&gt; Most of them were born in New Zealand but had ties to [[Samoa]], [[Niue]], the [[Cook Islands]] and [[Tonga]].&lt;ref name ='Mallon'&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mallon|first1=Sean|last2=Pereira|first2=Pandora Fulimalo|title=Speaking in colour : conversations with artists of Pacific Island heritage|date=1997|publisher=Te Papa Press|location=Wellington|isbn=0909010447}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|36}}

Twenty-three artists formed the core exhibition:

*[[Fatu Feu'u]]
*William Furneaux
*Patriq Futialo
*Bruce George
*[[Niki Hastings-McFall]]
*[[Ioane Ioane]]
*[[Lily Laita]]
*Iosefa Leo
*Simmie Nichols
*Johnny Peninsula
*Lyle Peninsula
*Laugutu Poloai
*[[John Pule]]
*[[Ani O'Neill]]
*Albert Refiti
*Toegamau Tom Sefo
*Greg Semu
*Tania Short
*[[Sopolemalama Filipe Tohi|Filipe Tohi]]
*[[Michel Tuffery]]
*Lape Fakalaga Tulisi
*Veronica Vaevae
*Loretta Young

As the exhibition progressed other artists were added including Evotia Tamu, Sheyne Tuffery, Luana Asiata, Sasha Kronfeld, Glenda Vilisoni, Sale Jessop and the musical group Grace (made up of brothers Anthony, Jason and Paul Ioasa).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grace - profile|url=http://www.audioculture.co.nz/people/grace|website=AudioCulture|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Display==

''Bottled Ocean'' launched at City Gallery Wellington in 1994 and toured to [[Auckland Art Gallery]], Waikato Art Gallery (now [[Waikato Museum]]), the Manawatu Art Gallery (now [[Te Manawa]]) and the McDougall Art Annex (now [[Christchurch Art Gallery]]) throughout 1994 and 1995.&lt;ref name='Paradise'/&gt;{{Rp|33}}

Vivieaere changed the display of the exhibition for each location. At City Gallery Wellington the works were displayed on a mirrored floor behind a perspex wall, mimicking museum cabinets or shop window displays. and creating a forced distance between the art and the viewer.&lt;ref name ='Mallon'/&gt;{{Rp|136}} At the Auckland Art Gallery a mirrored floor was used and some of the works remained in their travelling crates or were partly unpacked.&lt;ref name='Te Ara'/&gt; At the Robert McDougall Art Annex Michel Tuffery's sculpture ''Pisupo Lua Afe'', a life-size bull made out of flattened corned-beef cans, was positioned as if it was gazing at a wall of art works like a visitor.&lt;ref name='Paradise'/&gt;{{Rp|26}}

==Reception and influence==

''Bottled Ocean'' has been noted for being one of the first exhibitions to focus on contemporary Pacific artists and for its underlying concerns. The exhibition was discussed at length in the publication accompanying ''Paradise Now: Contemporary Art from the Pacific'', the first major exhibition of contemporary Pacific art to show in a United States museum. It is also discussed in the recent book ''Art in Oceania: A New History'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Bottled Ocean'' made the 'arrival' of contemporary Pacific art in the elite galleries of the New Zealand art world a problem to be reflected upon, rather than simply a triumph to celebrate. Having been invited to survey the work of Pacific migrants, Vivieaere turned the exhibition into something of an installation, a work of art in its own right, in which he used various exhibitionary devices to make the desire for 'cultural difference' and 'otherness', which had become broadly topical in the artworld, the implicit subject of the exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brunt|first1=Peter|last2=Nicholas|first2=Thomas|title=Art in Oceania : a new history|date=2013|publisher=Thames and Hudson|location=London|isbn=0500239010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|432}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Reviewing the exhibition for ''Art AsiaPacific'' Wendy Vaigro wrote

&lt;blockquote&gt;As the ostensible organising principle of ''Bottled Ocean'', 'Pacific Islandness' is utilised as a term that references, ironically, attempts to homogenise Polynesian artists working in New Zealand. ... In challenging the closure of aesthetic and political categories and conventional curatorial practices, Jim Vivieaere creates ''Bottled Ocean'' as a meta-exhibition. The result is a subtle and thoughtful show that eludes ideological control and authoritative discourse at every turn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vaigro|first1=Wendy|title=''Bottled Ocean": Shape Shifting|journal=Art AsiaPacific|date=1995|volume=2|issue=4|pages=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a review for ''Art New Zealand'', [[Nicholas Thomas]] investigated Vivieaere's reference to a 'modern tribal art market' in the brochure accompanying the exhibition.&lt;ref name=Thomas&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=Nicholas|title=Pacific Dualities: Bottled Ocean in Wellington and Auckland|journal=Art New Zealand|date=Autumn 1995|issue=74|pages=46–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; He observed that 'the work in ''Bottled Ocean'' is produced for and around a market - not just an art market, but a contemporary global cultural market, a multicultural theatre in which identities, signatures, nationalities and lifestyles are affirmed, celebrated, changed and consumed.'.&lt;ref name ='Thomas'/&gt;{{Rp|46}} He continued:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The mainstream audience may be primarily interested in the tropical colourfulness of the work, in the apparent conformity of its spirituality with New Age environmentalism, in its exoticism. Artists appear to have responded to this interest by making exoticism visually explicit through the use of readily recognizable Polynesian motifs. ... The distinctive accomplishment of ''Bottled Ocean'' lies in its direct but subtle challenge to this consumerist interest interest in Pacific art and culture.&lt;ref name ='Thomas'/&gt;{{Rp|47–48}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Church of the Holy Cross''' ({{lang-hr|Crkva svetog Križa}}) is a Croatian [[Pre-Romanesque]] [[Catholic]] [[Church (building)|church]] originating from the 9th century in [[Nin, Croatia|Nin]].&lt;ref name="zadarskanadbiskupija"&gt;http://www.zadarskanadbiskupija.hr/?p=4009&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a theory from an art [[historian]] Mladen Pejaković,&lt;ref name=sun/&gt; the design has an intentionally unbalanced [[ellipse|elliptical]] form designated to "follow" the position of the [[Sun]], retaining the functionality of a [[calendar]] and [[sundial]].&lt;ref name=sun/&gt; In its beginning, in the time of the [[Littoral Croatian Duchy|Croatian principality]], it was used as a royal [[chapel]] of the [[duke]]'s [[courtyard]] nearby.&lt;ref name=sun&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.casopis-gradjevinar.hr/dokumenti/200907/6.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229173122/http://www.casopis-gradjevinar.hr/dokumenti/200907/6.pdf|title=Crkve u sjeverozapadnom dijelu zadarskoga zaleđa|journal=Građevinar|issue=61|year=2009|archivedate=December 29, 2009|language=hr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The church is that of a central type, it features the [[Croatian interlace]] (or simply "troplet") and a carved name of the Croatian ''župan'' "Godečaj".&lt;ref name=sun/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20070509063433/http://www.nin.hr/hr/kulturne_znamenitosti.html Nin.hr - kulturne znamenitosti]  ''/''  [https://archive.is/20130217172608/http://kulturniturizam.croatia.hr/Destinations/DestinationDocument.aspx?idLanguage=1&amp;idDestination=192&amp;idCategory=1061&amp;idDocument=2860 Kulturni turizam - croatia.hr - Nin: Crkva sv.

The '''[[coat of arms]] of the [[Kosovo|Republic of Kosovo]]{{ref label|status|a|}}''' was introduced following the [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|unilateral declaration of independence]] from [[Serbia]], issued by [[Kosovo]]'s parliament in the country's capital on February 17, 2008. It shows six white stars in an arc above a solid golden shape of Kosovo as seen on a standard projection map, placed on a rounded triangular shield with a blue field and a  golden border.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kosovapress.com/ks/index.php?cid=2,2,38793 Kosovo's emblem which is expected to be adopted today in the parliament]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''Kosovapress'', Pristina, February 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Its central figures, the stars and the shape, are also the content of the new blue [[flag of Kosovo]], already adopted at the same time.

==Symbols used during United Nations administration==

The United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) issued two regulations relating to the use of symbols:

*UNMIK regulation UNMIK/REG/2000/30&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unmikonline.org/regulations/2000/reg30-00.htm Regulations – 2000&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (May 20, 2000) "ON STAMPS AND HEADINGS OF OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS OF COURTS, PROSECUTORS’ OFFICES AND PENAL ESTABLISHMENTS" states that the seals and letter heads of courts and penal establishments should contain "The emblem of the United Nations with “UNMIK” added to the top of the emblem" and the word "“Kosovo” in Albanian, Serbian and English"

*ADMINISTRATIVE DIRECTION NO. 2003/15&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unmikonline.org/regulations/admdirect/2003/ade2003_15.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unmikonline.org/regulations/admdirect/2003/ADE2003_15_AnnexI.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;(July 2, 2003) "IMPLEMENTING UNMIK REGULATION NO. 2001/9 ON A CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR PROVISIONAL SELF-GOVERNMENT IN KOSOVO" Establishes an "approved logo" for the Provisional Institutions of Self Government.

The time that can be called contemporary in [[Turkish literature]] falls in the period between the middle of the 20th century and the first years of the new millennium. Throughout this period many changes in literary discourse have occurred. Together with the fall of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and foundation of the [[Turkish Republic]] brought a different way to Turkish literature together with the effect of [[Westernization]] on Turkish writers. The literature of the new republic emerged largely from the pre-independence National Literature movement, with its roots simultaneously in the Turkish folk tradition and in the Western notion of progress. One important change to Turkish literature was enacted in 1928, when Mustafa Kemal initiated the creation and dissemination of a modified version of the [[Latin alphabet]] to replace the Arabic-based Ottoman script. Over time, this change—together with changes in [[Turkey]]'s system of [[education]]— would lead to more widespread [[literacy]] in the country. In 1950s, Turkish authors started to write in the tone of their western contemporaries bringing a new sense of literature to the country.

All of the salient aspects of Turkish life, politics and culture have found their direct or indirect expression in poetry, fiction, and drama, as well as in critical and scholarly writing. The themes and concerns have included nationalism, social justice, search for modernity. Westernization, revival of folk culture, economic and technological progress, human dignity, mysticism, pluralistic society, human rights and fundamental freedoms, democratic ideals, Ataturkism, Turanism, Marxist-Lenist ideology, revival of Islam, humanism in fact all aspect and components of contemporary culture found a voice in literature.

All stages of modern Turkish history (reforms under Atatürk, 1923–38; consolidation under Inonu, 1938–59; democracy under Menderes, 1950–60) have been marked by the thrust of literary modernization. Since the mid-nineteenth century, the most vital debate of Turkish literature has been between the proponents of art for art's sake and the advocates of commitment to realism and social causes. Mustafa Kemal in a conversation that took place in 1921, about two years before he proclaimed the Republic, exhorted the 19 years old Nazim Hikmet, already a famous poet, who would soon embrace the communist ideology and influence the course of modern Turkish literature, particularly poetry, more profoundly than anyone else. Since 1950, there has been a massive output, in all genres, depicting the plight of the lumpen proletariat. But surrealism, neosymbolism, theater of the absurd, stream of consciousness, hermeticism, black comedy and so on have also flourished.

==History==
In 1923, when the Republic of Turkey was proclaimed, the influential social thinker [[Ziya Gokalp|Ziya Gökalp]] wrote: "We belong to Turkish nation, the Islamic community, and Western civilization... Our literature must go the people and, at the same time, towards the West." The literature of the Turkish Republic has achieved Gokalp's objective.

Revolution, innovation, and Westernization have been driving forces of the Turkish nation in the twentieth century. The 19th century men of letters inherited the classical and the folk traditions but turned their attention to the literary tastes and movements of the West- particularly of France and England. The Ottoman state embarked upon process of transformation usually referred to as 'Westernization'.

==Major authors==

Contemporary Turkish Literature consists of many prolific authors whose works both shaped and improved the overall picture of Turkish literature. [[Mehmet Akif Ersoy]], a master of heroic diction, a major figure in early modern Turkish literature, devoted much of his verse to the dogma, and passion. His nationalism has a strong Islamic content, evident in the lyrics of the Turkish national anthem that he wrote. Yahya Kemal Beyatli was the much-acclaimed neoclassicist who produced, in the conventional forms and meters, meticulous lyrics of love, Ottoman grandeur, and Istanbul's natural attractions. Among the dedicated revolutionaries in 20th-century Turkish poetry Nazim Hikmet ranks the highest. He has been a modernizing force since the early 1920s, remaining significant in aesthetics and political terms. A communist, he spent many years in Turkish jails, fled to Soviet Union in 1951 and died in Moscow in 1963. Much of his works laments social injustice, complains of the oppression of the masses, and yearns for revolutionary change. In the mid-1950s a brave new genre emerged  the 'Village novel' which reached its apogee with [[Yasar Kemal]]'s ''Ince Memed'' (English title ''[[Memed, My Hawk]]''; this novel has been translated into 25 languages). He was considered the most famous Turkish novelist not only in turkey but also in the world press and literary circles. Satirical fiction is dominated by [[Aziz Nesin]], Turkey's best satirist ever. He is one of the most important figures of Turkish literature. He is the author of more than 100 books including poetry and prose.In more than 60 works, Nesin has provided strong indictment of the oppression and brutalization of the common man. A thrust for modernization took place in the early 1940s when Orhan Veli Kanik, Oktay Rifat, and Melih Cevdet Anday launched their poetic realism. Their urge for upheaval was revolutionary. A new generation had initiated obscurantism, continuing from where Asaf Haler Celebi's surrealism had left off in the 1940s. [[Ilhan Berk]] perhaps Turkey's most daring and durable poetic innovator, who acted as spokesman for the group (often identified as the Second New) pontificated "Art is for innovation's sake." The forms and values of classical poetry, too, are kept alive by a group of highly accomplished formalists who are clustered mainly around the monthly  ''Hisar'' which ceased publishing at the end of 1980 after 30 years.  His works have been translated into over thirty languages. [[Enis Batur]] is another important writer/poet in contemporary Turkish literature. He writes both in Turkish and in English. Some of his works are translated into English by Turkish translators. [[Orhan Pamuk]] is probably the best-known Turkish writer around the world mostly because of the [[Nobel Prize]] he won in 2006. He is considered one of the most prominent novelists of Turkey.

'''''Crisis at Central High''''' is a [[1981 in television|1981]] [[made-for-television movie]] about the [[Little Rock Integration Crisis|Little Rock Integration Crisis of 1957]], based on a draft of the memoir by the same name by former assistant principal [[Elizabeth Huckaby]].&lt;ref name="lrchs57"&gt;[http://www.centralhigh57.org/news.htm News Releases] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061103104043/http://www.centralhigh57.org/news.htm |date=2006-11-03 }}, 40th Anniversary web Site&lt;/ref&gt; 

William Link and Richard Levinson wrote the screenplay and were executive producers together with David Susskind of [[Time-Life|Time-Life Productions]].&lt;ref name="nyt1981"&gt;John O'Connor.

Caillouet.[http://www.ardemgaz.com/prev/central/baxliz20.html Central High crisis diarist dies,] ''[[Arkansas Democrat-Gazette]]'', March 20, 1999 (retrieved November 3, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Woodward was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie|Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or a Special]]&lt;ref name=Emmy&gt;[http://www.emmys.com/shows/crisis-central-high Television Academy Database] - Joanne Woodward Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Special&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Miniseries or Television Film|Best Performance by an Actress in a Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for TV]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.goldenglobes.com/tv-show/crisis-central-high Joanne Woodward] at Golden Globe Awards database&lt;/ref&gt; in 1981 and 1982 respectively.&lt;ref name="awards"&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082215/awards Awards and Nominations for ''Crisis at Central High'' (1981)] on Internet Movie Database&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=November 2009}}

==Critical reception==
Reviewer John O'Connor of ''[[The New York Times]]'' observed, "In the end, of course, the real heroes of this piece are [[Little Rock Nine|the nine black students]]," whom O'Connor described as "played to quiet perfection." Actors highlighted for their portrayals included [[Calvin Levels]] as [[Ernest Green]] (the only [[twelfth grade|senior]] in the group) and [[Regina Taylor]] as [[Minnijean Brown-Trickey|Minnijean Brown]], launching that actress' professional career.&lt;ref name="hwtaylor"&gt;[https://archive.is/20130126035932/http://www.hollywood.com/celebs/fulldetail/id/189938 Regina Taylor] at Hollywood.com&lt;/ref&gt; Other principal actors in the film included [[Charles Durning]] as the principal and [[Henderson Forsythe]] as Huckaby's husband, Glenn. 

===Composite characters===
Like many [[docudrama]]s, ''Crisis'' included some composite characters; at least one reviewer (O'Connor) criticizes the vague disclaimer to that effect, arguing that in a piece about such controversial events, alterations to the truth should be identified more specifically.&lt;ref name="nyt1981"/&gt; In addition to the [[Artistic license|creative license]] already mentioned with regard to her role in the crisis, Huckaby was reported to have said the film showed some events are out of sequence and slightly altered others.&lt;ref name="demgazobit"/&gt;

==Filming locations==
The movie was filmed on location in [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=736 Elizabeth Paisley Huckaby (1905–1999)], ''[[Encyclopedia of Arkansas]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and at [[Woodrow Wilson High School (Dallas)|Woodrow Wilson High School]] in [[Dallas, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;Craig, J.

[[File:De Stijl, Vol. 1, no. 1, Delft, October 1917 (detail).jpg|thumb|250px|''De Stijl'', Vol.1, no.1, Delft, October 1917, edited by [[Theo van Doesburg]]. Cover of the first 12 issues, 1917-1931 (detail), original design by [[Vilmos Huszár]]]]

'''''De Stijl''''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ə|_|ˈ|s|t|aɪ|l}}; {{IPA-nl|də ˈstɛil}}), [[Dutch language|Dutch]] for "The Style", also known as '''Neoplasticism''', was a Dutch [[art]]istic movement founded in 1917 in Leiden. De Stijl consisted of artists and architects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Linduff|first=David G. Wilkins, Bernard Schultz, Katheryn M.|title=Art past, art present|date=1994|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J.|isbn=0-13-062084-X|pages=523|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a narrower sense, the term ''De Stijl'' is used to refer to a body of work from 1917 to 1931 founded in the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name="tate"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/d/de-stijl |title=De Stijl |accessdate=2006-07-31 |work=Tate Glossary |publisher=The Tate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="archdic"&gt;{{cite book |last=Curl |first=James Stevens |title=A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture |year=2006 |type=Paperback |edition=Second |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-860678-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of De Stijl advocated pure [[abstract art|abstraction]] and universality by a reduction to the essentials of [[Art#Forms, genres, mediums, and styles|form]] and [[colour]]; they simplified visual compositions to vertical and horizontal, using only [[black]], [[white]] and [[primary color]]s.

''De Stijl'' is also the name of a journal that was published by the Dutch painter, designer, writer, and critic [[Theo van Doesburg]] that served to propagate the group's theories. Along with [[Theo van Doesburg]], the group's principal members were the painters [[Piet Mondrian]], [[Vilmos Huszár]], and [[Bart van der Leck]], and the architects [[Gerrit Rietveld]], [[Robert van 't Hoff]], and [[Jacobus Oud|J. J. P. Oud]]. The artistic philosophy that formed a basis for the group's work is known as ''Neoplasticism''—the new plastic art (or ''Nieuwe Beelding'' in Dutch).

According to Theo van Doesburg in the introduction of the magazine "De Stijl" 1917 no.1, the "De Stijl"-movement was a reaction to the "Modern Baroque" of the [[Amsterdam School]] movement ([[Expressionist architecture|Dutch expressionist architecture]]) with the magazine "[[Wendingen]]" (1918-1931).

Mondrian sets forth the delimitations of Neoplasticism in his essay "Neo-Plasticism in Pictorial Art". He writes, "this new plastic idea will ignore the particulars of appearance, that is to say, natural form and colour. On the contrary, it should find its expression in the abstraction of form and colour, that is to say, in the straight line and the clearly defined primary colour". With these constraints, his art allows only primary colours and non-colours, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/n/neo-plasticism|title=Neo-plasticism – Art Term - Tate|first=|last=Tate|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The De Stijl movement posited the fundamental principle of the geometry of the straight line, the square, and the rectangle, combined with a strong asymmetricality; the predominant use of pure primary colors with black and white; and the relationship between positive and negative elements in an arrangement of non-objective forms and lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/movements/195212/description/|title=The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum-Guggenheim] Collection Online: De Stijl|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429120104/http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/movements/195212/description|archivedate=2014-04-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name De Stijl is supposedly derived from [[Gottfried Semper]]'s ''Der Stil in den technischen und tektonischen Künsten oder Praktische Ästhetik'' (1861–3), which Curl&lt;ref name="archdic"/&gt; suggests was mistakenly believed to advocate [[materialism]] and [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalism]]. The "plastic vision" of De Stijl artists, also called Neo-Plasticism, saw itself as reaching beyond the changing appearance of natural things to bring an audience into intimate contact with an immutable core of reality, a reality that was not so much a visible fact as an underlying spiritual vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Denker|first1=Susan A.|title=De Stijl: 1917–1931, Visions of Utopia|journal=Art Journal|date=September 1982|volume=42|issue=3|pages=242–246|doi=10.1080/00043249.1982.10792803|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00043249.1982.10792803}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, De Stijl proposed ultimate simplicity and abstraction, both in architecture and painting, by using only straight horizontal and vertical lines and rectangular forms. Furthermore, their formal vocabulary was limited to the primary colours, [[red]], [[yellow]], and [[blue]], and the three primary values, [[black]], [[white]], and [[grey]]. The works avoided symmetry and attained aesthetic balance by the use of opposition. This element of the movement embodies the second meaning of ''stijl'': "a post, jamb or support"; this is best exemplified by the construction of crossing joints, most commonly seen in [[carpentry]].

In many of the group's three-dimensional works, vertical and horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements. This feature can be found in the [[Rietveld Schröder House]] and the [[Red and Blue Chair]].

De Stijl was influenced by [[Cubist]] painting as well as by the mysticism and the ideas about "ideal" geometric forms (such as the "perfect straight line") in the [[neoplatonic]] philosophy of mathematician [[M.&amp;nbsp;H.&amp;nbsp;J. Schoenmaekers]]. The De Stijl movement was also influenced by [[Neopositivism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Linduff|first=David G. Wilkins, Bernard Schultz, Katheryn M.|title=Art past, art present|date=1994|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J.|isbn=0-13-062084-X|page=523|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The works of De Stijl would influence the [[Bauhaus]] style and the [[International Style (architecture)|international style]] of architecture as well as clothing and interior design. However, it did not follow the general guidelines of an "-ism" (e.g., [[Cubism]], [[Futurism]], [[Surrealism]]), nor did it adhere to the principles of art schools like the Bauhaus; it was a collective project, a joint enterprise.

In [[music]], De Stijl was an influence only on the work of composer [[Jakob van Domselaer]], a close friend of Mondrian. Between 1913 and 1916, he composed his ''Proeven van Stijlkunst'' ("Experiments in Artistic Style"), inspired mainly by Mondrian's paintings. This [[minimalist]]ic—and, at the time, revolutionary—music defined "horizontal" and "vertical" musical elements and aimed at balancing those two principles. Van Domselaer was relatively unknown in his lifetime, and did not play a significant role within De Stijl.

== History ==
=== Early history ===
From the flurry of new art movements that followed the [[Impressionist]] revolutionary new perception of painting, [[Cubism]] arose in the early 20th century as an important and influential new direction. In the [[Netherlands]], too, there was interest in this "new art".

However, because the Netherlands remained neutral in [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]], Dutch artists were not able to leave the country after 1914 and were thus effectively isolated from the international art world—and in particular, from [[Paris]], which was its centre then.

During that period, Theo van Doesburg started looking for other artists to set up a [[Literary magazine|journal]] and start an art movement. Van Doesburg was also a writer, poet, and critic, who had been more successful writing about art than working as an independent artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Theo van Doesburg|editor1-last=Translated by Janet Seligman|editor2-last=Introd. by Hans M. Wingler|editor3-last=Postscript by H.L.C. Jaffé|title=Grundbegriffe der Neuen Gestaltenden Kunst (Grondbeginselen der Nieuwe beeldende Kunst [Principles of Neo-Plastic Art])|date=1918|publisher=Lund Humphries (1968)|location=London, UK|isbn=0853311048|language=German, Dutch, English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quite adept at making new contacts due to his flamboyant personality and outgoing nature, he had many useful connections in the art world.

=== Founding of ''De Stijl'' ===
[[File:Theo van Doesburg Composition VII (the three graces).jpg|thumb|left|190px|[[Theo van Doesburg]], ''Composition VII (the three graces)'' 1917]]
[[File:Otterloo kroller muller mondrian composition couleur A.jpg|thumb|left|190px|[[Piet Mondrian]], ''Composition en couleur A'', 1917, [[Kröller-Müller Museum]]]]
Around 1915, [[Theo van Doesburg|Van Doesburg]] started meeting the artists who would eventually become the founders of the journal. He first met [[Piet Mondrian]] at an exhibition in [[Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam]]. Mondrian, who had moved to Paris in 1912 (and there, changed his name from "Mondriaan"), had been visiting the Netherlands when war broke out. He could not return to Paris, and was staying in the artists' community of [[Laren, North Holland|Laren]], where he met [[Bart van der Leck]] and regularly saw [[M.&amp;nbsp;H.&amp;nbsp;J. Schoenmaekers]]. In 1915, Schoenmaekers published ''Het nieuwe wereldbeeld'' ("The New Image of the World"), followed in 1916 by ''Beginselen der beeldende wiskunde'' ("Principles of Plastic Mathematics"). These two publications would greatly influence Mondrian and other members of De Stijl.

Van Doesburg also knew [[J.&amp;nbsp;J.&amp;nbsp;P. Oud]] and the Hungarian artist [[Vilmos Huszár]]. In 1917 the cooperation of these artists, together with the poet [[Anthony Kok]], resulted in the founding of De Stijl. The young architect [[Gerrit Rietveld]] joined the group in 1918.  At its height De Stijl had 100 members and the journal had a circulation of 300.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dujardin|first1=Alain|last2=Quirindongo|first2=Jop|title=This 100-Year-Old Dutch Movement Shaped Web Design Today|url=https://backchannel.com/100-years-of-clean-lines-how-de-stijl-is-influencing-digital-design-4397f1a72e37?curator=MediaREDEF#.kphtjs1er|website=[[Backchannel (blog)]]|accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During those first few years, the group was still relatively homogeneous, although Van der Leck left in 1918 due to artistic differences of opinion. [[Manifesto]]s were being published, signed by all members. The social and economic circumstances of the time formed an important source of inspiration for their theories, and their ideas about architecture were heavily influenced by [[Hendrik Petrus Berlage|Berlage]] and [[Frank Lloyd Wright]].

The name ''Nieuwe Beelding'' was a term first coined in 1917 by Mondrian, who wrote a series of twelve articles called ''De Nieuwe Beelding in de schilderkunst'' ("Neo-Plasticism in Painting") that were published in the journal ''De Stijl''. In 1920 he published a book titled ''Le Néo-Plasticisme''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/diglit/mondrian1920/0005 Piet Mondrian, ''Le Néo-Plasticisme, Principe Général de l'Equivalence Plastique'', Paris, 1920], Universitätsbibliothek Heidelberg&lt;/ref&gt;

=== After 1920 ===
[[File:Van Doesburg and Rietveld interior 1919.jpg|thumb|Van Doesburg and Rietveld interior, c.1919, [[Rijksmuseum]], Amsterdam]]
Around 1921, the group's character started to change. From the time of van Doesburg's association with [[Bauhaus]], other influences started playing a role. These influences were mainly [[Malevich]] and Russian [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]], to which not all members agreed. In 1924 Mondrian broke with the group after van Doesburg proposed the theory of elementarism, suggesting that a diagonal line is more vital than horizontal and vertical ones. In addition, the De Stijl group acquired many new "members". [[Dada]]ist influences, such as [[I.&amp;nbsp;K. Bonset]]'s poetry and [[Aldo Camini]]'s "antiphilosophy" generated controversy as well. Only after Van Doesburg's death was it revealed that Bonset and Camini were two of his pseudonyms.

=== After van Doesburg's death ===

Theo van Doesburg died in [[Davos]], Switzerland, in 1931. His wife, Nelly, administered his estate.

Because of van Doesburg's pivotal role within De Stijl, the group did not survive. Individual members remained in contact, but De Stijl could not exist without a strong central character. Thus, it may be wrong to think of De Stijl as a close-knit group of artists. The members knew each other, but most communication took place by letter. For example, Mondrian and Rietveld never met in person.

Many, though not all, artists did stay true to the movement's basic ideas, even after 1931. Rietveld, for instance, continued designing furniture according to De Stijl principles, while Mondrian continued working in the style he had initiated around 1920. Van der Leck, on the other hand, went back to figurative compositions after his departure from the group.

=== Influence on architecture ===
The De Stijl influence on architecture remained considerable long after its inception; [[Mies van der Rohe]] was among the most important proponents of its ideas. Between 1923 and 1924, [[Gerrit Rietveld|Rietveld]] designed the Rietveld Schröder House, the only building to have been created completely according to De Stijl principles. Examples of Stijl-influenced works by [[J.J.P. Oud]] can be found in [[Rotterdam]] (''{{Ill|Café De Unie|nl}}'') and [[Hoek van Holland]]. Other examples include the [[Eames House]] by Charles and Ray Eames, and the interior decoration for the [[Aubette (building)|Aubette dance hall]] in Strasbourg, designed by Sophie Taeuber-Arp, Jean Arp and van Doesburg.

=== Present day ===
Works by De Stijl members are scattered all over the world, but De Stijl-themed exhibitions are organised regularly. Museums with large De Stijl collections include the [[Gemeentemuseum Den Haag|Gemeentemuseum]] in [[The Hague]] (which owns the world's most extensive, although not exclusively De Stijl-related, Mondrian collection) and [[Amsterdam]]'s [[Stedelijk Museum]], where many works by Rietveld and Van Doesburg are on display. The [[{{Not a typo|Centraal}} Museum]] of [[Utrecht]] has the largest Rietveld collection worldwide; it also owns the Rietveld Schröder House, Rietveld's adjacent "show house", and the Rietveld Schröder Archives.

The movement inspired the design aesthetics of [[Rumyantsevo (Moscow Metro)|Rumyantsevo]] and [[Salaryevo]] stations of [[Moscow Metro]] opened in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/marble-and-mondrian-a-tour-of-moscows-metro/g-19098971|title=Marble and Mondrian: a tour of Moscow metro|publisher=DW|accessdate=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artlebedev.com/metro/rumyantsevo/|title=Type design for Rumyantsevo Moscow Metro station|accessdate=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:edwardgerman.jpg|right|thumb|220px|&lt;center&gt;Sir Edward German&lt;/center&gt;]]
'''Sir Edward German''' (17 February 1862 – 11 November 1936) was an English musician and composer of Welsh descent, best remembered for his extensive output of [[incidental music]] for the stage and as a successor to [[Arthur Sullivan]] in the field of English [[comic opera]]. Some of his light operas, especially ''[[Merrie England (opera)|Merrie England]]'', are still performed.

As a youth, German played the violin and led the town orchestra of [[Whitchurch, Shropshire]]. He also began to compose music. While performing and teaching violin at the [[Royal Academy of Music]], German began to build a career as a composer in the mid-1880s, writing serious music as well as light opera. In 1888, he became music director of [[Globe Theatre (Newcastle Street)|Globe Theatre]] in London. He provided popular [[incidental music]] for many productions at the Globe and other London theatres, including ''Richard III'' (1889), ''Henry VIII'' (1892) and ''Nell Gwynn'' (1900). He also wrote symphonies, orchestral suites, symphonic poems and other works.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edwardgermandisc.synthasite.com/orchestral-works-by-edward-german.php Links to information about German's orchestral works and recordings of them] at the Edward German Discography, accessed 16 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote a considerable body of songs,&lt;ref&gt;[http://edwardgermandisc.synthasite.com/individual-songs.php Links to information about German's songs and recordings of them] at the Edward German Discography, accessed 16 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; piano music, and symphonic suites and other concert music, of which his ''Welsh Rhapsody'' (1904) is perhaps best known.

German was engaged to finish ''[[The Emerald Isle]]'' after the death of Arthur Sullivan in 1900, the success of which led to more [[comic opera]]s, including ''Merrie England'' (1902) and ''[[Tom Jones (Edward German)|Tom Jones]]'' (1907). He also wrote the ''[[Just So Songs|Just So Song Book]]'' in 1903 to [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s texts and continued to write orchestral music. German wrote little new music of his own after 1912, but he continued to conduct until 1928, the year in which he was knighted.

==Life and career==
German was born '''German Edward Jones''' in Whitchurch, Shropshire, the second of five children and older of two sons of John David Jones, a liquor merchant, brewer, church organist and lay preacher at the local [[Congregational church|Congregational]] chapel, and Elizabeth (Betsy) Cox (died 1901), a teacher of Bible classes for young women. His first name was an anglicised form of the Welsh name "Garmon."&lt;ref&gt;[http://cine.abeillemusique.com/CD/Classique/8223726/0730099372626/Marco-Polo/GERMAN-Edward/Symphonie-n-2-Welsh-Rhapsody/cleart-17025.html Liner notes for recording of German's Symphony No. 1 and Welsh Rhapsody] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222001033/http://cine.abeillemusique.com/CD/Classique/8223726/0730099372626/Marco-Polo/GERMAN-Edward/Symphonie-n-2-Welsh-Rhapsody/cleart-17025.html |date=22 February 2014 }}, beille Musique AMCD, 2006, accessed 15 June 2012 (French)&lt;/ref&gt; His parents called him Jim.&lt;ref name=Prince&gt;Prince, John. [http://www.naxos.com/mainsite/blurbs_reviews.asp?item_code=8.660270-71&amp;catNum=660270&amp;filetype=About%20this%20Recording&amp;language=English# From liner notes for the 2009 recording of ''Tom Jones''], Naxos 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He began to study piano and organ with his father at the age of five. At the age of six, he formed a boys' concert band to perform locally, teaching himself the violin, composition, and music arrangement in the process. He later sang [[alto]] in the church choir and participated in family entertainments above his uncle's grocery shop, often playing piano duets and performing comic sketches with his elder sister, Ruth, who died when he was 15.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Rees, Brian. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/33378 "German, Sir Edward (1862–1936)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 13 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote comic poems. His younger sisters were named Mabel and Rachel.&lt;ref name=Prince/&gt;

In his mid-teens, German's parents attempted to apprentice him to a shipbuilding firm, as they believed their son had an aptitude for engineering. His studies at a boarding-school in [[Chester]] had been delayed by a serious illness, however, and so he was turned away as too old to begin an apprenticeship. In his teens he formed a second band, a quintette, including himself on the violin, his sister on the pianoforte or the bass, and three friends of the family. He prepared the orchestrations for this band. He also led the town orchestra, did some amateur acting, and sang comic songs in local village halls.&lt;ref name="dnb"/&gt;

===The Royal Academy===
At the age of 18, he studied privately with Walter Cecil Hay, the conductor of the Whitchurch choral society and director of music at St. Chad's of [[Shrewsbury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Edward German. A Biographical Sketch|journal=The Musical Times|date=1 January 1904|volume= 45|issue=731|pages=20–24|jstor=903292}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://stchadschurchshrewsbury.com/music/music-staff "Music Staff at St Chad's"], St Chad's of Shrewsbury, 2012, accessed 9 February 2018&lt;/ref&gt; German entered the [[Royal Academy of Music]], where he eventually changed his name to J. E. German (and later simply Edward German) to avoid confusion with another student named Edward Jones. He continued his studies of violin and organ, also beginning a more formal study of composition under [[Ebenezer Prout]].&lt;ref name=Scowcroft&gt;Scowcroft, Philip. [http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2001/Dec01/Edward_German.htm "Edward German: Serious or Light?"] MusicWeb-International, 1 December 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Many of German's student works were played at Academy concerts.&lt;ref name=Notes&gt;[[David Russell Hulme|Hulme, David Russell]].

In 1884, the Academy appointed German a sub-professor of the violin. During his time as an instructor, he was well regarded and won several medals and prizes, such as the Tubbs Bow for his skill with the violin. In 1885, he won the Charles Lucas Medal for his ''Te Deum'' for soloists, choir and organ, leading him to change his focus from violin to composition. He soon wrote a [[light opera]], ''The Two Poets'' (for four soloists and piano), in 1886, which was produced at the Academy and then performed at [[St. George's Hall, London|St. George's Hall]].&lt;ref name=Notes/&gt; In 1887, his first symphony, in E Minor, was also performed at the Academy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927205853/http://www.yorkgate.ram.ac.uk/emuweb/pages/ram/PartyDisplay.php?irn=1055&amp;QueryPage=%2Femuweb%2Fpages%2Fram%2FQuery.php "German, Sir Edward"], Profile at the [[Royal Academy of Music]]'s [[York Gate Collections]] (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890 he conducted a revised version of this symphony at [[the Crystal Palace]], while ''The Two Poets'' toured successfully in England.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

During his time at the Royal Academy, German taught at [[Wimbledon School]] and played the violin in theatre orchestras, including the [[Savoy Theatre]]. He visited Germany in 1886 and 1888–89 and was impressed by its opera, particularly at [[Bayreuth]].&lt;ref name=grove&gt;Hulme, David Russell. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/10936 "German, Sir Edward"], Grove Music Online, Oxford Music Online, accessed 14 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt; His circle of close friends at the Academy included [[Dora Bright]]&lt;ref&gt;Rees, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; and Ethel Mary Boyce (1863–1936) from [[Chertsey]], Surrey. He and Boyce became engaged. She was also a promising composition student and won the Lady Goldsmid scholarship in 1885, the Sterndale Bennett Prize in 1886 and the Charles Lucas Medal in 1889. Although the engagement was broken off, they remained friends.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fp.cotswan.plus.com/EthelMBoyce.htm Information about Ethel Mary Boyce]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; German never married.&lt;ref name=Prince/&gt;

===Plays and orchestral music===
After leaving the Academy, German continued to teach at Wimbledon School and to play the violin in orchestras at various London theatres, including the [[Savoy Theatre|Savoy]].&lt;ref name=Prince/&gt; In 1888, an introduction by conductor [[Alberto Randegger]] to theatre manager [[Richard Mansfield]] led to German's appointment as conductor and musical director at the [[Globe Theatre (Newcastle Street)|Globe Theatre]] in London. There he improved the orchestra and began providing [[incidental music]] for the theatre's lavish productions, starting with ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' in 1889.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; This music was well received (''[[The Times]]'' called for a concert suite to be arranged),&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 18 March 1889, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; and the overture soon became popular in [[concert hall]]s. This eventually led to other incidental music commissions that gained success. In 1892, German composed music for a production of [[Henry Irving]]'s version of ''[[Henry VIII (play)|Henry VIII]]'' at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London]], where he incorporated elements of traditional old English dance. Within a year, sheet music of the dance numbers from the play's score had sold 30,000 copies. German was by then in great demand to write music for plays. His commissions included [[Henry Arthur Jones]]'s ''The Tempter'' in 1893, [[Johnston Forbes-Robertson]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' at the Lyceum in 1895, [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]]'s productions of ''[[As You Like It]]'' (1896) and ''[[Much Ado about Nothing]]'' (1898), and [[Anthony Hope]]'s ''English Nell'' (later known as ''Nell Gwynn'') in 1900, starring [[Marie Tempest]].&lt;ref name=Scowcroft/&gt;&lt;ref name=Notes/&gt;

At the same time, German was writing music for the concert hall, sometimes adapting music from his theatrical scores. His ''Gypsy Suite'' met with success similar to that of his overture to ''Richard III'' and his popular ''Henry VIII'' and ''Nell Gwynn'' dances. All were written in "a distinctive, if limited, 'olde English' manner, a species of musical mock [[Tudor music|Tudor]] with which German came to be particularly associated."&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; He also wrote a number of successful drawing-room songs and solo piano pieces during this time. The success of German's theatrical and concert hall music led to his receiving commissions from orchestral music festivals, including his second symphony for the [[Norfolk and Norwich Festival|Norwich Festival]] in 1893. The young critic [[George Bernard Shaw]] complained that German's symphonies were limited by the composer's indulgence in a theatricality out of place in symphonic writing. German was thin-skinned, and after receiving this criticism, he wrote no more symphonies. German tried to avoid this charge in the future by characterising his large-scale four-movement works as "symphonic suites". Successful orchestral works included suites for the [[Leeds]] Festival in 1895 and ''The Seasons'' for Norwich in 1899, and a symphonic poem, ''Hamlet'', at [[Birmingham]] in 1897, conducted by [[Hans Richter (conductor)|Hans Richter]]. He had planned a violin concerto for the 1901 Leeds Festival, but this was never completed, as German instead turned to light opera.&lt;ref name=Notes/&gt; In 1902, he produced a Rhapsody on March Themes for the Brighton Festival.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

===Comic operas===
Though German had little experience with opera or choral music, [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]] invited him to finish [[Arthur Sullivan]]'s ''[[The Emerald Isle]]'' for the [[Savoy Theatre]] after Sullivan's death in 1900.&lt;ref name=Stone&gt;Stone, David. [http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/whowaswho/G/GermanEdward.htm "Edward German"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027072106/http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/whowaswho/G/GermanEdward.htm |date=27 October 2014 }}, Who Was Who in the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]], 2001&lt;/ref&gt; He accepted, giving up his violin concerto commission for the Leeds Festival to meet the deadlines. The success of his score for the opera (which was performed into the 1920s) opened up a new career for him.&lt;ref name=Notes/&gt; His next comic opera, in 1902, was ''[[Merrie England (opera)|Merrie England]]'', with [[Basil Hood]], the librettist for ''The Emerald Isle''. This was perhaps German's greatest success, and its dance music was popular separately. It was revived frequently, becoming a light-opera standard in Britain, while several of its songs, including "The English Rose", "O Peaceful England" and "The Yeomen of England", remained popular until the middle of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; ''Merrie England'' has been so frequently chosen by amateur groups in England that it probably has been performed more often than any other British opera or operetta written in the 20th century.&lt;ref name=Notes/&gt;

[[Image:Gilbert-workman-german.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Gilbert, Workman and German at a rehearsal]]
After this, German and Hood collaborated again in 1903 to write ''[[A Princess of Kensington]]''. This opera was unsuccessful, although it toured briefly and had a New York production. German turned to other endeavours, composing music to [[Rudyard Kipling]] texts, including the twelve songs in the ''[[Just So Songs|Just So Song Book]]'' in 1903. He also received a steady flow of orchestral commissions, leading to works such as his ''Welsh Rhapsody'' for the Cardiff Festival in 1904, featuring as its climax "[[Men of Harlech]]".&lt;ref name=Scowcroft/&gt;

German returned to writing comic operas, achieving another success with ''[[Tom Jones (Edward German)|Tom Jones]]'' for the [[Apollo Theatre]] in 1907, produced by [[Robert Courtneidge]] for the [[Henry Fielding|Fielding]] bicentenary. The score is one of German's finest works. It received a production in New York, with German conducting, and was performed for decades, spawning separate performances of its dance music.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; He next collaborated with [[W. S. Gilbert]] on his final (and unsuccessful) opera, ''[[Fallen Fairies]]'', at the Savoy in 1909. With German's agreement, Gilbert cast his protege, [[Nancy McIntosh]], as the Fairy Queen, Selene. Critics found her performance weak. Shortly after the opening, the producer [[C. H. Workman]], acting at the request of the syndicate he had gathered, replaced McIntosh with [[Amy Evans]] and asked for restoration of a song that Gilbert had cut during rehearsals. Gilbert was outraged and threatened to sue, demanding that German join him. This placed German in a distressing position, and the composer, who habitually preferred to avoid legal battles, declined.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, Robert. [http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/gilbert/plays/fallen_fairies/article.html "The Controversy Surrounding Gilbert's Last Opera",] ''Fallen Fairies'', The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; In maintaining the Savoy tradition of comic opera, German was composing a style of piece for which public taste had dwindled as fashions in [[Edwardian musical comedy|musical theatre]] had changed with the new century.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

===Later years===
In the wake of the failure of ''Fallen Fairies'' and his unhappy experience with it, German effectively ended his career as a composer of new works, only returning to composition on a few rare occasions. Among his works in his later years was a [[Coronation March (Edward German)|march]] and hymn for the coronation of [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] in 1911, his ''Theme and Six Diversions'' in 1919, and his final major work, the Othello-inspired tone poem ''The Willow Song'' in 1922.&lt;ref name=Scowcroft/&gt; In 1912, actor-manager Sir [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] proposed another collaboration between Hood and German to provide a musical production based on the life of [[Sir Francis Drake]], but German declined the commission, saying that its [[Elizabethan]] setting would merely result in his covering ground already explored in ''Merrie England''. He also, on occasion, wrote new part-songs and vocal solos, and in 1911 became the first composer to write music for a British film; he was commissioned for 50 guineas to write 16 bars of music for the coronation scene in the film ''[[Henry VIII of England]]''.&lt;ref name=Scowcroft/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0001658|Henry VIII (1911)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Germanlateryears.jpg|right|thumb|German in later years]]
After that, German ceased composing new works regularly. Correspondence shows that he felt uncomfortable with the changing musical styles, such as [[jazz]] and modernist classical music. Like Sullivan before him, he regretted that his popularity stemmed mostly from his comic operas.&lt;ref name=Prince/&gt; However, German was a perfectionist and continually revised his works and produced new arrangements for publication. He also recorded some of them and encouraged their production and broadcast on the radio.&lt;ref name=Scowcroft/&gt;

German lived, from 1886, in Hall Road, [[Maida Vale]], near [[Lord's|Lord's Cricket Ground]], where he was an avid enthusiast of that game. He lived a quiet life, enjoying walking, cycling and fishing, though he often attended the theatre. He developed a strong friendship with [[Edward Elgar|Sir Edward Elgar]].&lt;ref name=Prince/&gt; German was injured in a road accident during [[World War I]], but continued to be a highly sought-after conductor, accepting many conducting engagements, until he suffered an eye condition that left him blind in his right eye in 1928. He was the first British conductor invited by [[Dan Godfrey]] to conduct his own music at [[Bournemouth]].&lt;ref name=Notes/&gt; Beginning in 1916, he was also one of the first composers to conduct his own music for recording, producing full renderings of ''Merrie England'' and ''Theme and Six Diversions''.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

German was knighted in 1928, when the respect in which he was held by fellow musicians was shown by the number of eminent musicians who attended the celebratory dinner, including Elgar, [[Alexander Mackenzie (composer)|Sir Alexander Mackenzie]], [[Hugh Allen (conductor)|Sir Hugh Allen]], [[Landon Ronald|Sir Landon Ronald]], and [[Gerald Tyrwhitt-Wilson, 14th Baron Berners|Lord Berners]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'', 30 March 1928, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934 German received the [[Royal Philharmonic Society]]'s highest honour, its gold medal, presented by [[Thomas Beecham|Sir Thomas Beecham]] at an RPS concert.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 20 April 1934, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected an Honorary Freeman of the Worshipful Company of Musicians in 1936, and he was a leader of the Performing Rights Society, which fought for composers' rights to fair compensation for the performances of their works.

German lived long enough to witness the beginning of a decline in the popularity of his orchestral works. A note found after his death bears this poignant message: "I die a disappointed man because my serious orchestral works have not been recognised".&lt;ref name=Notes/&gt; However, his best-known orchestral pieces are still occasionally performed, and his light operas ''Merrie England'' and ''Tom Jones'' continue to receive productions, at least by amateur companies, and professional recordings, including a 2009 Naxos version of ''Tom Jones''.&lt;ref name=Prince/&gt;&lt;ref name=Notes/&gt; [[Dutton Vocalion|Dutton Epoch]] released a selection of German's music, including his Symphony No. 2, in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;Farrell, Scott. [http://edwardgermandisc.synthasite.com/sir-edward-german---dutton-epoch.php "Sir Edward German (Dutton Epoch)"], Edward German Discography, 2007, accessed 3 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and a recording of some of his incidental music for plays, together with two marches and a hymn in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Farrell, Scott.

German died of [[prostate cancer]] at his home in Maida Vale, London, at the age of 74.&lt;ref&gt;"Deaths", ''The Times'', 4 January 1937, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; He was cremated at [[Golders Green Crematorium|Golders Green]],&lt;ref&gt;Rees, p. 282&lt;/ref&gt; and his ashes are interred in the [[Whitchurch, Shropshire|Whitchurch]] cemetery.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; He left an estate valued at £56,191.&lt;ref&gt;[https://probatesearch.service.gov.uk/#wills Edward German in Wills &amp; Probate 1858–1996: 1936], p. 521, Probate Search Service, UK.Gov, accessed 15 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
The music scholar [[David Russell Hulme]] wrote of German that French influences are clearly apparent in his music "and there are even occasional reminders of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]], but paradoxically he was, like Elgar, a stylistic cosmopolitan who wrote music that is quintessentially English."&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; Hulme also observes that though he is seen as Sullivan's successor, German's music is quite different in style, and his lyric ballads especially show "a romantic warmth that struck a new note in British operetta".&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; ''The Times'', too, noted that German was so frequently spoken of as Sullivan's successor that his contemporaries failed to notice that he was "an artist of genius" in his own right.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' obituary, 12 November 1936, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of German's colleagues in the musical establishment did, however, find his work to be of the highest quality, including Elgar and [[Sir John Barbirolli]]. A recording of his ''Richard III'', ''Theme and Six Diversions'' and ''The Seasons'' was released by Naxos in 1994. Hulme writes that "German's orchestral music certainly does not deserve the neglect it has suffered, for it still has much to offer modern audiences. Beautifully crafted, colourful and vital, its pleasing and distinctive personality is still capable of inspiring the kind of affectionate regard it once so readily kindled."&lt;ref name=Notes/&gt;

==Edward German Festival==
The first Edward German Festival was held in 2006 in German's birth town, Whitchurch, Shropshire. Events included performances by festival patron and cellist, [[Julian Lloyd Webber]] and a concert version of German's best-known work, ''Merrie England''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/shropshire/content/articles/2006/04/03/edward_german_2006_feature.shtml "Whitchurch celebrates music of famous son"], BBC Home 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Another festival was held on 23–28 April 2009, sponsored by the Friends of Whitchurch Heritage. This programme included a concert version of ''Tom Jones'' (for which a new recording was released by Naxos in 2009) and a school adaptation of ''Merrie England''. Other events featured clarinettist [[Emma Johnson (clarinettist)|Emma Johnson]], German scholar [[David Russell Hulme]] and the [[Hallé Orchestra]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edwardgermanfestival.org.uk/2009/press.html "Sir Edward German Music Festival 2009"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815123914/http://edwardgermanfestival.org.uk/2009/press.html |date=15 August 2011 }}, Sir Edward German Music Festival 2009 website&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Jason Epstein]] gave a series of lectures in 1999 about his experiences in publishing. Epstein mentioned in his speech that a future was possible in which customers would be able to print an out-of-stock title on the spot, if a book-printing machine could be made that would fit in a store. He founded 3BillionBooks with Michael Smolens, a Long Island entrepreneur in Russia, and Thor Sigvaldason, a consultant at [[Price Waterhouse Coopers]]. At the time, Jeff Marsh, a [[St Louis]] engineer and inventor, had already constructed a prototype book printer that could both photocopy and bind. Marsh was working on this project for Harvey Ross, who held U.S. Patent 5,465,213.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ross|first=H.M.|title=System and Method of Manufacturing a Single Book Copy|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US5465213|publisher=U.S. Patent and Trademark Office|accessdate=18 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Zelchenko, a Chicago-based technologist and a partner of Ross in a related patent effort, worked with Marsh to prove the concept and also helped bring Marsh and other players together with several venture interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rose|first=M.J.|title=Twelve-minute Book Delivery|url=https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2001/07/45228|accessdate=18 September 2013|newspaper=Wired|date=July 17, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ultimately Epstein, together with Dane Neller, former President and CEO of [[Dean and Deluca]], licensed Marsh's invention and founded On Demand Books.&lt;ref name="SMH"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ondemandbooks.com/history.htm About ODB: History], OnDemandBooks.com. Retrieved on 2009-06-03.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first Espresso Book Machine was installed and demonstrated June 21, 2007 at the [[New York Public Library]]'s Science, Industry and Business Library. For a month, the public was allowed to test the machine by printing free copies of [[public domain]] titles provided by the [[Open Content Alliance]] (OCA), a non-profit organization with a database of over 200,000 titles.&lt;ref name="PR Web"/&gt;

==Distribution==
The direct-to-consumer model supported by Espresso Book Machine eliminates the need for shipping, warehousing, returns and pulping of unsold books; it allows simultaneous global availability&lt;ref name="SMH"/&gt; of millions of new and backlist titles.

EBM books can also be made available for distribution through [[Lightning Source]], a subsidiary of [[Ingram Content Group]].

[[File:Spinacorona.jpg|thumb|Detail of Parthenope]]
The '''Fountain of the Spinacorona''', ({{lang-it|Fontana della Spinacorona}}), vulgarly known as the ''Fontana delle Zizze'' (Fountain of the Breasts), is an ancient fountain in central [[Naples]], located against a wall of the church of [[Santa Caterina della Spina Corona, Naples|Santa Caterina della Spina Corona]].


==History==
There was likely a fountain at the site well before the 15th century, but documents attest to its reconstruction in [[1490s in art|1498]]  It was rebuilt in the mid-16th century in the present shape by commission of the viceroy Don [[Pedro Álvarez de Toledo]] using designs by [[Giovanni da Nola]]. The fountain has the heraldic symbol of [[Charles I, Holy Roman Emperor]]. 

The subject is the depiction of the [[Siren (mythology)|siren]] [[Parthenope (Siren)|Parthenope]] (icon of Naples) who douses, with water emerging from her breasts, the flames of the volcano of [[Vesuvius]].  It is unclear why a violin is carved on the slopes of the volcano. The phrase: ''Dum Vesevi Syrena Incendia Mulcet'' (While the Mermaid softens the fire of Vesuvius) is carved into the marble. The fountain seen today is a copy by [[Achille D’Orsi]]: the original has been housed in the [[Museo di San Martino]] since the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corpodinapoli.it/ospitalita/monumenti/fontana-spinacorona.html Corpo di Napoli], website dedicated to sites in central Naples.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''HaNephesh Theater''' is a [[Jewish]] [[fringe theater]] established in 1978 by Howard Rypp and Gabriel Emanuel in [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nepheshtheatre.co.il/en/about_us/about&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of its founding, HaNefesh was the only professional Jewish [[theater]] in Canada, where it produced approximately 40 theatrical and television productions. 
In 1980 the theater produced its first play, ''Children of the Night''. The play, which tells the story of [[Janusz Korczak]], was featured in the first International Jewish Theater Festival in [[New York City]].

In 1983, Rypp [[Aliyah|immigrated to Israel]], bringing the theater with him. The theater's first production in [[Israel]] was Emanuel's joint production with [[Habima Theatre|Habima Theater]] called ''Einstein''. It was translated into several languages, and in 2005 was performed in New York on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].

From 1988 to 1994 Yitzchak Meshel served as the theater's dramaturge and conducted 7 of its plays. Since 1995 Beatriz Hal serves as the theater's dramaturge.

The theater is recognized and supported by Israel’s Ministry of Culture. The theater conducts educational plays that focus on various social conflicts in Israeli society, for example between the religious and secular communities, new and veteran Olim, and [[Arab]]s and Jews. Its productions shed light on human experiences and promote the values of dialogue, tolerance, and mutual respect.

The theater's repertoire currently includes 16 plays in [[Hebrew]] and five in [[English language|English]], which the organization hopes to produce worldwide. The theater conducts roughly 300 plays every year all over Israel, for people of diverse backgrounds and age groups. In addition, the theater has conducted over 200 performances overseas at international festivals, professional conventions, and universities for Jewish audiences and other groups.

The '''Huntington Theatre Company''' is Boston’s leading professional theatre and the recipient of the 2013 Regional Theatre Tony Award. Under the direction of Artistic Director Peter DuBois and Managing Director Michael Maso and in residence at [[Boston University]].&lt;ref name="AboutHuntington"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huntingtontheatre.org/about/ |title=About Us &amp;#124; Huntington Theatre Company |publisher=Huntingtontheatre.org |date=2011-12-12 |accessdate=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Huntington was founded in 1982 by Boston University under President John Silber and Vice President Gerald Gross, and was separately incorporated as an independent non-profit in 1986. Its two prior artistic leaders were Peter Altman (1982 – 2000) and Nicholas Martin (2000 – 2008). Michael Maso has led the Huntington’s administrative and financial operations since 1982 as the Managing Director, producing more than 180 plays in partnership with three artistic directors and leading the Huntington’s ten-year drive to build the Stanford Calderwood Pavilion at the Boston Center for the Arts, which opened in September 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huntingtontheatre.org/artists/Michael-Maso/ |title=Michael Maso &amp;#124; Huntington Theatre Company |publisher=Huntingtontheatre.org |date=2012-03-29 |accessdate=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, as a result of Boston University's decision to sell the BU Theatre on Huntington Avenue, the Huntington Theatre Company and Boston University dissolved their relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbur.org/artery/2015/10/07/boston-univeristy-selling-theater|title=After 33 Years, BU And Huntington Theatre Company Are Cutting Ties|website=www.wbur.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The new owners of the BU Theatre Complex,  QMG Huntington LLC, have proposed the creation of a new condo tower, while also allowing the Huntington to lease the renovated theatre space for $1 per year for the next 99 years. Construction is projected to be completed in late 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/theater/dance/2017/06/26/huntington-ave-tower-and-theater-plans-are-revealed/IigoaYlOaDibKyMfQ7r6dO/story.html|title=Huntington Ave. tower and theater plans are revealed - The Boston Globe|work=BostonGlobe.com|access-date=2018-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Stanford Calderwood Pavilion at the Boston Center for the Arts===

The Huntington Theatre Company built and operates the Stanford Calderwood Pavilion at the Boston Center for the Arts, located at 527 Tremont Street in Boston's Historic South End, which provides facilities and audience services at subsidized rates to small and mid-sized theatre companies.It houses the 360 seat Virginia Wimberly Theatre, the Nancy and Edward Roberts Studio Theatre, Carol G. Deane Hall, and Hall A.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412050435/http://www.huntingtontheatre.org/about/pavilion/ |title=Calderwood Pavilion at the BCA &amp;#124; Huntington Theatre Company |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Huntington also operates BostonTheatreScene.com where tickets are sold for productions at the [[Boston University]] Theatre, the BCA Theatres on the Plaza, and Calderwood Pavilion at the BCA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bostontheatrescene.com/venues/ Venues | BostonTheatreScene.com website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091124064219/http://www.bostontheatrescene.com/venues/ |date=2009-11-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable productions ==

The Huntington has transferred 16 productions to New York, including two in 2012: the Broadway premiere of Lydia R. Diamond’s ''Stick Fly'' and the Roundabout Theatre Company production of Stephen Karam’s ''Sons of the Prophet'', named a 2012 Pulitzer Prize finalist. The Huntington champions new play development and the local theatre community through its operation of the Stanford Calderwood Pavilion at the Boston Center for the Arts, which the Huntington built in 2004.&lt;ref name="AboutHuntington" /&gt;

August Wilson had a unique relationship with the Huntington, as eight of his plays were produced here before they went on to New York (7 to Broadway, and one Off Broadway). The Huntington's special relationship with August Wilson and his work began in 1986 with a production of ''Joe Turner's Come and Gone'', Wilson's third play. For 25 years, the Huntington served as an artistic home to Wilson, developing and premiering seven of the ten plays of his Century Cycle during his life and producing two after his death. In 2012, the Huntington completed the cycle with ''Ma Rainey's Black Bottom.'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.is/20130704024109/http://www.huntingtontheatre.org/news/archive/2011-2012/2011/Huntington-completes-Pulitzer-Prize-and-Tony-Award-winner-August-Wilsons-Century-Cycle-/ |title=Huntington completes Pulitzer Prize and Tony Award winner August Wilson's Century Cycle &amp;#124; Huntington Theatre Company |publisher=Archive.is |date= |accessdate=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2010-2011 season, the Huntington featured "The Shirley, VT Plays" Festival, with three plays written by [[Annie Baker]] being put on at the same time in three different theatres; ''Circle Mirror Transformation'' (Huntington), ''[[Body Awareness]]'' (SpeakEasy), and ''Aliens'' (Company One).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.speakeasystage.com/content.php?section=showpage&amp;page=awareness ]{{dead link|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, The Huntington teamed up with Mary Zimmerman to produce a knockout production of ''Candide.'' Zimmerman returned in the 2013-2014 season to direct the world premiere adaptation of ''The Jungle Book'' in association with Chicago's Goodman Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528203626/http://www.huntingtontheatre.org/season/2013-2014/Jungle-Book/ |title=The Jungle Book &amp;#124; Huntington Theatre Company |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Huntington Playwriting Fellows (HPF)===

Since 2003, the HPF program has invited writers to participate in two-year residencies, during which playwrights receive a modest honorarium, join in a biweekly writers’ collective with artistic staff, attend Huntington productions and events, and are eligible for readings and support through the Breaking Ground Festival and the Huntington's Summer Workshop Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://howlround.com/the-huntington-playwriting-fellows-lisa-timmel-local-playwrights-and-radical-hospitality|title=The Huntington Playwriting Fellows: Lisa Timmel, Local Playwrights, and Radical Hospitality|work=HowlRound|access-date=2018-02-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary focus of the program is creating relationships with writers at all stages of their careers, from emerging talent to established professionals. The program provides a framework for an in-depth, two-year artistic conversation and a long-term professional relationship. Huntington productions of plays by Fellows include ''The Luck of the Irish'' by Kirsten Greenidge, ''Stick Fly'' by Lydia R. Diamond, ''The Atheist,'' ''Brendan,'' and ''The Second Girl'' by Ronan Noone, ''Psyched'' and ''“M”'' by Ryan Landry, and ''A Guide for the Homesick'' by [[Ken Urban]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huntingtontheatre.org/DocumentsHTC/news/artistic/06272012SummerWorkshopRelease_final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theatermirror.net/?p=1194|title=Huntington’s "A Guide for the Homesick" Artfully Mixes Global Politics, Personal Pain – Theater Mirror|website=www.theatermirror.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kaper Koraon Treasure''' is a [[Byzantine silver]] treasure consisting of 56 individual [[silver]] items originating from [[Syria]] in the sixth and seventh centuries.

==History==
The treasure was re-discovered between 1908 and 1910. It was originally believed to have belonged to the church in [[Antioch]], a thriving Roman city on the Mediterranean  It can now be argued that the items come from a larger collection of silver from the church of Saint Sergios in modern-day [[Kurin]], [[Syria]] or that the pieces belonged to a small local church.&lt;ref name="JSTOR"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Evans|first1=Helen|title=The Arts of Byzantium|journal=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin|date=2001|volume=58|issue=4|pages=1–68|jstor=3269176}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The final items of the collection were likely interred at the site in the seventh century as the [[Byzantine Empire]] subsequently lost this area of Syria to the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] army.  The later conquering by the Muslim Arab army permanently removed the area from Byzantine control.&lt;ref name="JSTOR"/&gt;

It is believed that the Persian and Muslim Arab take-overs were relatively peaceful as historic sites around the area show little to no damage that could be attributed to that time. Though religion began to shift following the change of power and [[Christian]] artifacts were increasingly stored away from public viewing, the area did continue to benefit from relative wealth and prosperity, creating many [[secular]] works. The real halt to production of silver treasures is thought to have followed a plague throughout the area from 542 to 544.  This had a lasting impact on the economic status of the region.&lt;ref name="Dumbarton"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Foss|first1=Clive|title=Syria in Transition, A. D. 550-750: An Archaeological Approach|journal=Dumbarton Oak Papers|date=1997|volume=51|pages=189–269|jstor=1291765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is evidence that this accumulation of local wealth in silver objects was common throughout the area leading up to the Persian control and the sixth century plague.  Similar treasures have been found at [[Stuma]], [[Ariha|Riha]], [[Hama]], and Antioch to name a few.&lt;ref name="Dumbarton"/&gt;

The objects found in the Kaper Koraon treasure were not originally prestigious [[shrine]] gifts but were likely relatively cheap [[imitations]] made specifically for a village [[Church (building)|church]]. This can be clearly seen from recent investigations into the pieces which have shown high quantities of [[copper]] and other metals melted in with the silver to increase malleability and decrease production costs.  It is estimated that these items were the collective donations from five local families over a period of at least three decades.  Many of the stamps present on the pieces are believed to have been added after production and some note the specific [[donor]]s of each piece.&lt;ref name="Walters"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mango|first1=Marlia Mundell|title=Silver from Early Byzantium: the Kaper Koraon and Related Treasures|date=1986|publisher=Walters Art Gallery|location=Baltimore, Maryland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable pieces==
The Kaper Koraon treasure consists of 56 total silver objects including: eight [[chalice]]s, seven [[paten]]s, five crosses, one [[cross]] [[revetment]], two lamp stands, three lamps, three ewers, one flask, one bowl, one mirror, one box, eleven spoons, one ladle, two strainers, two fans, and four plaques. The other three objects are only partial pieces of broken fragments likely from other [[wikt:plaque|plaque]]s. Many of the items are religious in nature including images of the cross and Jesus's disciples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Byzyntine Legacy: Kaper Koraon Treasure|url=http://www.thebyzantinelegacy.com/walter-kaperkoraon|publisher=Walters Art Museum|accessdate=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some are believed to be secular but were stored with the church collection either for safe-keeping on behalf of the owner or stores of wealth for the [[parish]].&lt;ref name="Walters"/&gt;

Most of the silver pieces shown here still show evidence of hammering either visibly or through careful machine investigation.  Due to the limited skill level of local workers and the overworking of [[malleable]] metal, many items featured here have stress fractures or chips that were original to the piece.  Any repairs visible, such as the re-welding of a handle onto an [[ewar]], are likely original and occurred before the [[internment]] of the treasure.  Many of the chalices were hammered, welded together, and then lathed to smooth out the seams between the cup and the stem.  Some chalices shows signs of wear at these seams and around the top rim due to the method of their construction.&lt;ref name="Walters"/&gt;

Since their discovery, the items of the Kaper Koraon treasure have dispersed into public and private collections throughout the world including [[The Walters Art Museum]].

'''Kearny Street Workshop''' (KSW) in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], is the oldest multidisciplinary arts [[Nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] addressing [[Asian Pacific American]] issues. The organization's mission is to produce and present art that enriches and empowers Asian Pacific American communities. Notable participants include author and Asian American studies scholar [[Russell Leong]], playwright and author [[Jessica Hagedorn]], author [[Janice Mirikitani]], poet and historian [[Al Robles]], and actor and filmmaker [[Lane Nishikawa]]. 

== History ==

=== Origins ===
Kearny Street Workshop was founded as an artists' collective in 1972 in the [[International Hotel (San Francisco)|International Hotel]] (I-Hotel) on San Francisco's [[Kearny Street]]. The founders Jim Dong, Lora Joh Foo, and Mike Chin and other early leaders were involved in the [[Asian American movement]], a [[Civil Rights Movement]]-inspired period of organizational and community building in the 1970s. The [[National Endowment for the Arts]] provided some initial funding through the Neighborhood Arts Program (NAP), an initiative of the [[San Francisco Arts Commission]]. Though the founders were initially distrustful of government funds, NAP liaison Bernice Bing and founder Jim Dong eventually agreed to use a $2,000 NAP grant to fund a graphics workshop for KSW participants.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/3935054|title=The art museum as educator : a collection of studies as guides to practice and policy|last=Arts.|first=Council on Museums and Education in the Visual|date=1978|publisher=University of California Press|others=Newsom, Barbara Y., Silver, Adele Z.|year=|isbn=9780520032484|location=Berkeley|pages=207|oclc=3935054}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its early days, KSW shared space with a dry goods store on the ground floor of the I-Hotel.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mica.edu/About_MICA/Departments_and_Services/The_Center_for_Art_Education/Community_Arts_Journal/Visions_and_Voices_of_the_I-Hotel.html|title=Visions and Voices of the I-Hotel: Urban Struggles, Community Mythologies and Creativity {{!}} MICA|last=Art|first=Maryland Institute College of|website=www.mica.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization originally focused on cultivating [[Chinese Americans|Chinese American]] arts and activism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, the organization quickly expanded to cater to a multiethnic constituency, holding classes for Asian American activists and artists to practice [[photography]], [[creative writing]], and [[silkscreen printing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maeda|first=Daryl Joji|date=2016-06-09|title=The Asian American Movement|url=http://americanhistory.oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199329175.001.0001/acrefore-9780199329175-e-21|language=en|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780199329175.001.0001/acrefore-9780199329175-e-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the first few years, hundreds of Bay-area students were attending classes, [[Salon (gathering)|salons]], workshops, and [[Exhibition|exhibitions]] each day.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Kearny Street Collective: Pioneering Workshop Turns 25|last=Hsuan|first=Bryan|date=September 11, 1997|work=Asianweek|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; KSW also opened Jackson Street Gallery in an adjacent I-Hotel storefront space in 1974, where Workshop members held exhibitions, poetry readings, and musical performances.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Community activism ===
KSW played a key role in developing Asian American activist iconography during the I-Hotel anti-eviction movement. Students and other KSW members painted a block-long mural on the Jackson Street side of the I-Hotel in support of its tenants. Screenprinted posters advocating for the I-Hotel tenants' rights appeared throughout San Francisco's [[Chinatown, San Francisco|Chinatown]], [[Little Manila|Manilatown]], and [[Japantown, San Francisco|Japantown]] during the decade-long fight for the I-Hotel. Artists from KSW also aided in the anti-eviction protests by organizing [[Demonstration (protest)|rallies]], attending court hearings, hosting exhibitions on [[affordable housing]], and publishing [[poetry]] and pamphlets that depicted life in the I-Hotel.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

KSW also provided summer youth programming that was intended to provide a diversion from gang violence in Chinatown. Workshop members also spearheaded the development of the annual Hop Jok Fair, which not only promoted Asian American artwork, but introduced many low-income Chinatown residents to available social and health services.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

=== Eviction and relocation ===
In 1977, both residential and business tenants were evicted from the I-Hotel. The workshop's headquarters relocated to a small storefront in [[North Beach, San Francisco]]. However, this relocation separated the organization from its key communities and constituents in Chinatown and Manilatown.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

KSW was able to return to Chinatown by 1981, leasing a basement space in a hotel on Clay Street. During its time in this space, members organized the Asian American Jazz Festival as well as the Kearny Street Workshop Press.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1995, KSW was incorporated as a [[501(c)(3) organization|501(c)(3)]] nonprofit organization and relocated to [[South Park, San Francisco]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

KSW finally relocated to a gallery and performance space in San Francisco's [[South of Market, San Francisco|SoMa]] in 2006.

== Programs and exhibitions ==
KSW's past and present programs include a small poetry press, writers' workshops, visual arts, [[martial arts]], readings, music, gallery exhibitions, performances, and film screenings, as well as the Asian American Jazz Festival and the annual artists festival APAture.

=== Kearny Street Workshop Press ===
KSW's press published poetry by Bay-area Asian American authors such as Virginia Cerenio, Bob Hsiang, Jaime Jacinto, [[Genny Lim]], Lenny Limjoco, and Jeff Tagami.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://openlibrary.org/publishers/Kearny_Street_Workshop_Press|title=Publisher: Kearny Street Workshop Press {{!}} Open Library|last=OpenLibrary.org|website=openlibrary.org|language=en|access-date=2017-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

=== Asian American Jazz Festival ===
KSW founded the Asian American Jazz Festival (AAJF) in 1981, with the help of organizers and KSW members George Leong and Paul Yamazaki.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.firstvoice.org/asian-american-jazz-festival/|title=Asian American Jazz Festival|website=Brenda Wong Aoki &amp; Mark Izu – Official Website|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until it ceased production in 2006, the AAJF was the longest continuously-running jazz festival in the San Francisco area. Notable participants include [[Mark Izu]], [[Fred Ho]], [[Vijay Iyer]], and [[Kim Jin-hi|Jin Hi Kim]]. 

=== APAture ===
APAture is an annual multidisciplinary arts festival founded in 2001. Its mission is to promote emerging artists of Asian and/or Pacific Islander descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kearnystreet.org/apature-faq/|title=APAture FAQ|website=Kearny Street Workshop|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable participants include [[Gene Luen Yang]], [[Ali Wong]], [[Hasan Minhaj]], and [[Jane Kim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kmir.com/story/36320233/kearny-street-workshop-presents-over-60-emerging-asian-pacific-american-artists-in-the-16th-annual-apature-festival|title=Kearny Street Workshop Presents Over 60 Emerging Asian Pacific American Artists in the 16th Annual APAture Festival|access-date=2017-09-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10907">'''Luba art''' refers to the [[visual culture|visual]] and [[material culture]] of the [[Luba people]]. Most objects were created by people living along the [[Lualaba River]] and around the lakes of the [[Upemba Depression]], or among related peoples to the east in what is now the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].

The exact date of the founding of the [[Luba Kingdom]] is uncertain. According to oral tradition, the cultural hero [[Kalala Ilunga]] conquered the lands of adjacent chiefs along the Lualaba River. He and his successors were venerated as living divinities capable of great power. During the eighteenth century the Luba empire expanded eastward and southward until it reached the basins of the [[Sankuru River|Sankuru]] and [[Lomami River|Lomami]] rivers. Luba art consequently varies regionally and has also influenced the art of neighboring peoples including the [[Hemba]] and the [[Boyo (department)|Boyo]]. Most of the Luba art in Western collections was originally produced in association with royal or chiefly courts and was meant to validate the power of leaders. Luba art forms tend to be "delicately modeled and curvilinear, expressing serenity and introspection." &lt;ref name=Siegmann /&gt;

In December 2010, prestigious auctioning house [[Sotheby's]] announced that a Luba sculpture made by the legendary ''[[Master of Buli]]'' was sold for 7,100,000,00 USD in [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOUrfiA7bHk&lt;/ref&gt; The sale made that Luba caryatid stool the second most expensive piece of African art in History.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://africanartclub.com/african-art/master-of-buli-stool/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217035617/http://africanartclub.com/african-art/master-of-buli-stool/ |archivedate=2010-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.paulfrasercollectibles.com/News/Art-%26-Photography/'Finest'-religious-stool-by-African-Buli-Master-sets-$7.5m-World-Record-price/5357.page&lt;/ref&gt;


==Luba aesthetics==
According to Luba spokespersons, the outward form and iconography of Luba objects are directly connected to their effectiveness.&lt;ref name="Visions of Africa Luba"&gt;{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=Mary Nooter Roberts &amp; Allen F.|title=Luba|year=2007|publisher=5 continents|location=Milan|isbn=8874392974}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Luba, how an object looks dictates how well it works.&lt;ref name="Loughran 2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Loughran|first=Kristyne|title=Art of Being Tuareg: Sahara Nomads in a Modern World|year=2006|publisher=University of Washington Press for the Canton Center for Visual Arts, Stanford University, and the UCLA Fowler Museum of Cultural History|location=Seattle|pages=194–201|authorlink=Does It Have to Be Beautiful to Empower?|editor=T. Seligman and K. Loughran}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fernandez 1975"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fernandez|first=James|title=The Traditional Artist in African Societies|year=1975|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington, Indiana|pages=194–220|authorlink=The Exposition and Imposition of Order: Artistic Expression in Fang Culture|editor=W. d'Azevedo}}&lt;/ref&gt; To be considered effective, an object must work to protect, promote, and heal individuals and communities.

==Emphasis on women in Luba arts==
[[File:Brooklyn Museum 22.1108a-b Water Pipe.jpg|thumbnail|Luba water pipe, from the collection of the Brooklyn Museum]]
Almost all Luba art includes the female form either surmounting or supporting objects such as headrests, staffs, spears, axes or bowls. The female figure holding her breasts is the most common motif in Luba art.&lt;ref name=Siegmann&gt;{{cite book|last=Siegmann|first=William C.|title=African art a century at the Brooklyn Museum|year=2009|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|location=Brooklyn, NY|isbn=9780872731639}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gesture has multiple levels of meaning, symbolizing respect, nurturing, and the role of women as mothers. The representation is also significant since the Luba trace descent through the female line. This gesture also references the fact that in Luba culture, only women are deemed strong enough to guard the profound secrets of royalty, and it is within their breasts that they protect the royal prohibitions upon which sacred kingship depends.&lt;ref name="Nooter 1991"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mary|first=Nooter|title=Luba Art and Policy: Creating Power in a Central African Kingdom|year=1991|publisher=PhD Dissertation, Columbia University|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; These women also often bear signs of Luba identity such as pervasive marks of beauty in the form of scarification.&lt;ref name="Visions of Africa Luba" /&gt;

Luba explain that only women, who have the potential to become pregnant and produce new life, are strong enough to hold powerful spirits and the secret knowledge associated with them.&lt;ref name="Roberts and Roberts 1996" /&gt;

Because of the emphasis on women, Luba objects were usually the property of men of noble status. The artists who made them were also men, trained in blacksmithing and woodcarving.

=="Mapping Memory"==
The concept of memory is central to an understanding of Luba art. Luba map memory through the iconography of stools, staffs, and other visual devices.&lt;ref name="Roberts and Roberts 1996"&gt;{{cite book|title=Memory : Luba art and the making of history : [... in conjunction with an exhibition ... presented by the Museum for African Art, New York (2 february - 8 september 1996)]|year=1996|publisher=Museum for African Art|location=New York|isbn=379131677X|editor=Mary Nooter Roberts and Allen F. Roberts}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since precolonial times, the  recounting of history has been a specific and highly valued form of intellectual activity among Luba. Visual representations (Luba art) has been a primary vehicle for the making of Luba histories of kingship and political relations.&lt;ref name="Roberts and Roberts 1996" /&gt;

==Lukasa memory boards==
[[File:Brooklyn Museum 76.20.4 Lukasa Memory Board.jpg|thumbnail|Lukasa memory board, from the collection of the Brooklyn Museum]]
{{Main|Lukasa (Luba)}}

Central to Luba artistry is the ''[[Lukasa (Luba)|lukasa]]'', a seemingly simple but extraordinarily sophisticated device that aids memory and the making of histories. Stools, staffs, figures, and complex choreographies complement the ''lukasa'' as Luba culture is remembered, produced, and transformed.

''Lukasa'' memory boards are hourglass-shaped wooden tablets that are covered with multicolored beads, shells and bits of metal, or are incised or embossed with carved symbols.&lt;ref name="Reefe 1978"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reefe|first=Thomas|title=Lukasa: A Luba Memory Device|journal=African Arts|year=1978|volume=10|issue=4|pages=48–50, 88|doi=10.2307/3335144}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colors and configurations of beads or ideograms serve to stimulate the recollection of important people, places, things, relationships and events as court historians narrate the origins of Luba authority. A ''lukasa'' serves as an archive for the topographical and chronological mapping of political histories and other data sets.&lt;ref name="Visions of Africa Luba" /&gt;

==Staffs==
[[File:Brooklyn Museum 22.193 Ceremonial Staff Kibango.jpg|thumbnail|Ceremonial staff (Kibango), from the collection of the Brooklyn Museum]]
Staffs of office are among the most plentiful of Luba royal insignia. They are also the most diverse in iconography because their ownership was considerably more democratic than that of stools: caryatid stools were restricted to highest-ranking political offices, whereas staffs could belong to diviners, Mbudye members, title-holders and territorial chiefs. No two Luba staffs are alike because each encodes the histories, genealogies and migrations of a particular family, lineage or chiefdom. The details of a particular staff act as mnemonic cues, which assist narrators in "politically motivated recollection of the past."&lt;ref name="Visions of Africa Luba" /&gt;

==Caryatid stools==
[[File:Brooklyn Museum 56.6.92 Stool.jpg|thumbnail|:Luba caryatid stool, from the collection of the Brooklyn Museum]]
While many objects of Luba art appear to be functional, their utilitarian purposes have been replaced or augmented by symbolic purposes. Sculpted caryatid stools serve symbolically as seats of power and sites of memory for deceased kings and chiefs rather than serve as places to sit. Therefore, they are metaphorical, not literal, seats of kingship. The design of Luba seats of leadership may either be abstract or figurative. Those incorporating female caryatids give expression to the Luba conception of the female body as a spiritual receptacle that supports divine kingship. The aesthetic refinement of the female body through elaborate skin ornamentation serves as a metaphor for the civilization and refinement that Luba rulers disseminate within society.

Like ''lukasas'', Luba stools and staffs are "mnemonic mapping devices." They reflect and simulate "place memory" because they refer to sacred sites and prompt the narration of political histories through their forms.&lt;ref name="Casey 1987"&gt;{{cite book|last=Casey|first=Edward|title=Remembering: A Phenomenological Study|year=1987|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luba caryatid stools embodied important rulers of the past. When a Luba king died, his royal residence (or ''kitenta'') became the site where his spirit was incarnated by a female medium called Mwadi. This woman was possessed by the spirit of the king and inherited his insignia, dignitaries and wives. The succeeding king established a new residence, and throughout his reign he offered tribute to the ''mwadi'' of his predecessor. A caryatid stool is therefor a concrete manifestation of this metaphysical "seat."&lt;ref name="Visions of Africa Luba" /&gt;

==Bow stands==
[[File:Brooklyn Museum 22.1345 Bow Stand Nsakakabemba.jpg|thumbnail|Bow stand, from the collection of the Brooklyn Museum]]
Wooden or iron bow stands may have begun as practical objects, but they are also potent reminders of Mbidi Kiluwe, the culture hero who was a masterful hunter and blacksmith.&lt;ref name="Visions of Africa Luba" /&gt; Like other Luba regalia, bow stands were deployed in secret rituals and rarely publicly displayed. They were guarded in a special building by female dignitaries who provided prayers and sacrifices to them. Otherwise they were kept beside the bed of the ruler to inform his dreams and protect him from mystical and human adversaries. Iron bow stands make anthropomorphic references through hourglass-shaped torsos reminiscent of ''lukasa'' memory boards. Wooden bow stands are often adorned with full female figures referring to founders of royal lineages or Bevidye.&lt;ref name="Visions of Africa Luba" /&gt; Finally the metal shaft of bow stands convey the king's strength, and when planted in the ground, they testify to his origins and power.

'''Lupita dolls''', also known as [[cartonería]] dolls, are toys made from a very hard kind of [[papier-mâché]] which has its origins about 200 years ago in central [[Mexico]]. They were originally created as a substitute for the far more expensive [[porcelain]] dolls and maintained popularity until the second half of the 20th century, with its availability of plastic dolls. Today they are made only by certain artisans’ workshops in the city of Celaya, as collectors’ items. Since the 1990s, there have been efforts to revitalize the crafts by artists such as María Eugenia Chellet and Carolina Esparragoza sponsored by the government to maintain traditional techniques but update the designs and shapes.

==The dolls==
[[File:MissLupita64.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Unassembled and unpainted Lupita doll]]
A Lupita doll is a kind of papier-mâché doll which was made primarily by the poor along with those from straw, wood and rags.&lt;ref name="reviven"&gt;{{cite news |title= Reviven recuerdos infantiles |author=Marisol Juarez |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=August 6, 1999 |page=18 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Relive childhood memories }}&lt;/ref&gt; The papier-mâché technique is properly called cartonería, making a very hard surface when dry. This technique has been used to make a number of crafts up to this day, most notably to make [[alebrijes]] and skeletal and other figures for [[Day of the Dead]].&lt;ref name="nuestra"&gt;{{cite news |title= Muñeca de cartón representará nuestra cultura popular en Japón |author= Fabiola Palapa Quijas |newspaper=La Jornada |location=Mexico City |date=October 26, 2012 |page=2 |language=Spanish |url= http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2011/02/19/cultura/a02n1cul |trans-title=Cartonería doll will represent our cultura in Japan }}&lt;/ref&gt; The dolls are usually created with the help of molds, one for the head and torso and others for the arms and legs, with the strips of paper and paste layered on thickly. When the five pieces are dry, holes are bored into them in order to connect the arms and legs. The two arms are connected to the body with a single cord that extends from one upper arm, through the torso, to the other upper arm, with knots visible on the upper arms. The legs are attached similarly. This allows the arms and legs to be moved from the shoulders and hips respectively. Traditional Lupitas are painted in various flesh tones and with other colors to simulate clothing or underwear. On traditional dolls, flower designs of [[Otomi people|Otomi]] origin are also painted. Those painted with underwear are then dressed in some kind of costume.&lt;ref name="nuestra"/&gt;&lt;ref name="memoria"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Esparrogoza |first= Carolina |author= |year=2012 |title= Memoria del Proyect Miss Lupita |journal= Fondo Nacional para las Artes y Cultura |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The making of Lupitas  is known mostly in [[Mexico City]]  and in the city of [[Celaya]], [[Guanajuato]], where they are simply called “muñecas de carton” (cartonería dolls).&lt;ref name="memoria"/&gt; In Celaya, the dolls are given names which are painted on the chest.&lt;ref name="intenta"&gt;{{cite news |title= Intenta resurgir la cartonería de Celaya |author= Rosalba Leticia Montiel |url=http://www.oem.com.mx/elsoldelbajio/notas/n2497365.htm |newspaper= El Sol del Bajío |location=Guanajuato |date=April 8, 2012 |accessdate=October 8, 2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Cartonería tries to resurge in Celaya }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These dolls were often played with along with toy chairs and tables along with play dishes. They are still often displayed sitting on a miniature chair.&lt;ref name="reviven"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:MissLupita11.jpg|thumb|Lupita doll from the 20th century]]
[[File:MissLupita42.jpeg|thumb|María Eugenia Chellet at a Miss Lupita Project workshop]]
The hard papier-mâché has its origins in the late colonial to early [[Mexican War of Independence|Independence]] period, created by poorer families to imitate more expensive porcelain dolls from Spain.&lt;ref name="nuestra"/&gt;&lt;ref name="impartir"&gt;{{cite news |title= Viajará artista mexicana a Japón para impartir talleres de cartoneria |newspaper=NOTIMEX |location=Mexico City |date=February 4, 2011 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Mexican artist to travel to Japan to give cartonería classes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Mexico City, the name Lupita is derived from the diminutive for the popular girls name of Guadalupe. In the past they were sold in Mexico City in places such as the Sonora Market, where other items made of cartonería such as piñatas and Judas figures are still sold. The dolls remained popular until the era of commercial plastic dolls.&lt;ref name="memoria"/&gt; A number of stories surround the dolls. One of these is that a wife who feels that her husband is cheating on her would buy one of these dolls and write the name of his supposed mistress to let him know that she knew. Another story says that they were used in the past to advertise brothels in Mexico City with each doll representing a prostitute. The dolls in the windows indicated which women were available.&lt;ref name="memoria"/&gt;

However, since the second half of the 20th century, the dolls have lost popularity. They are no longer made in Mexico City and are only available from certain artisans in Celaya, sold not as toys but as collectors’ items.&lt;ref name="nuestra"/&gt;&lt;ref name="alojara"&gt;{{cite news |title= Alojará museo portugués 22 muñecas del proyecto "Miss Lupita" |newspaper=NOTIMEX |location=Mexico City |date=August 30, 2011 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Portuguese museum will host 22 dolls from the Miss Lupita project }}&lt;/ref&gt; These artisans include Lupita Hernández and Luis Alberto Canchola who makes the dolls in various sizes.&lt;ref name="intenta"/&gt;

Since the 1990s, there have been efforts by the government to revitalize the craft. One of these was the Jugar a las Muñecas. De las Lupes a las Robóticas project managed by artist María Eugenia Chellet from 1991 to 2008. It worked to create innovation in the dolls, creating images from mass media, the circus, harlequins, and animal/human figures. The dolls were painted in acrylics and decorated with items such as clothing, beads, feathers, ribbons and more. The main goal of the project was to see the dolls not as anonymous handcrafts but rather as works of art. This project was sponsored by [[CONACULTA]] and had workshops and exhibitions in various parts of Mexico. This was followed in 2010 by the [[Miss Lupita project]] headed by Caroline Esparragoza in Mexico City, with support from Chellet and the Fondo Nacional para las Artes y Cultura. The goal of this project is to preserve the traditional techniques to make the dolls but to update the designs. Dolls were created by ordinary people with help from artisans and artists and the results were exhibited in Mexico, [[Japan]] and [[Portugal]]. There was even a workshop to make the dolls in Japan.&lt;ref name="nuestra"/&gt;

Cartonería in Celaya has made something of a comeback, including the making of the Lupita dolls.&lt;ref name="intenta"/&gt;

''' Luristan bronzes''' (rarely "Lorestān", "Lorestāni" etc. in sources in English) are small [[casting|cast]] objects decorated with [[bronze sculpture]]s from the [[Early Iron Age]] which have been found in large numbers in [[Lorestān Province]] and [[Kermanshah]] in western [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;"Luristan" remains the usual spelling in art history for the bronzes, as for example in EI, Muscarella, Frankfort, and current museum practice&lt;/ref&gt; They include a great number of ornaments, tools, weapons, horse-fittings and a smaller number of vessels including [[Situla (vessel)|situla]]e,&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 112–113&lt;/ref&gt; and those found in recorded excavations are generally found in burials.&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 115–116; EI I&lt;/ref&gt; The ethnicity of the people who created them remains unclear,&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 116–117; EI I&lt;/ref&gt; though they may well have been [[Persian people|Persian]], possibly related to the modern [[Lur people]] who have given their name to the area. They probably date to between about 1000 and 650 BC.&lt;ref&gt;EI, I&lt;/ref&gt;

The bronzes tend to be flat and use [[openwork]], like the related metalwork of [[Scythian art]].  They represent the art of a nomadic or [[transhumant]] people, for whom all possessions needed to be light and portable, and necessary objects such as weapons, finials (perhaps for tent-poles), horse-harness fittings, pins, cups and  small fittings are highly decorated over their small surface area.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 343-48; Muscarella, 117 is less confident that they were not settled.&lt;/ref&gt; Representations of animals are common, especially goats or sheep with large horns, and the forms and styles are distinctive and inventive. The "[[Master of Animals]]" motif, showing a human positioned between and grasping two [[confronted animals]] is common&lt;ref&gt;EI I&lt;/ref&gt; but typically highly stylized.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 344-45&lt;/ref&gt; Some female "mistress of animals" are seen.&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 125–126&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
Luristan bronze objects came to the notice of the world art market from the late 1920s and were excavated in considerable quantities by local people, "wild tribesmen who did not encourage the competition of qualified excavators",&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 340&lt;/ref&gt; and taken through networks of dealers, latterly illegally, to Europe or America, without information about the contexts in which they were found.&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 113; EI I; EI II&lt;/ref&gt; Previous sporadic examples reaching the West had been assigned to various places, including [[Armenia]] and [[Anatolia]].&lt;ref&gt;EI I; EI III&lt;/ref&gt; There is strong suspicion that the many thousands of pieces sourced from the art trade include some forgeries.&lt;ref&gt;EI III; Muscarella, 112–113; EI I; EI II;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=L3suAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA171&amp;lpg=PA171 Wisseman], ''Ancient Technologies and Archaeological Material'', p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1938 several scientific excavations have been conducted by American, Danish, British, Belgian, and Iranian archaeologists on the cemeteries in areas including the northern Pish Kuh valleys and the southern Pusht Kuh of Lorestān; these are terms for the eastern "front" and western "back" slopes of the Kabīrkūh range of mountains, part of the larger [[Zagros Mountains]], which define the region where the bronzes seem to have been found.&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 114–117; EI I; EI II&lt;/ref&gt; How these cemeteries related to contemporary settlements remains unclear.&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 116&lt;/ref&gt;

Somewhat curiously, two very characteristic Luristan pieces have been excavated in the Greek world, on [[Samos]] and [[Crete]], but none in other parts of [[Iran]] or the [[Near East]].&lt;ref&gt;EI I&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context, dating and stylistic development==
[[File:Chariot Rein Ring LACMA M.76.97.574.jpg|thumb|A predessor: early [[Elam]]ite horse trapping in cast bronze, c. 2600-2400 BC]]

The term "Luristan bronze" is not normally used for earlier bronze artifacts from Lorestān between the fourth millennium BC and the (Iranian) [[Bronze Age]] (c.&amp;nbsp;2900–1250 BC), although they are often quite similar.&lt;ref&gt;EI I; Muscarella, 117&lt;/ref&gt; These earlier bronze objects, including those from the [[Elamite Empire]], which included Lorestān, were broadly similar to those found in [[Mesopotamia]] and on the [[Iranian Plateau]], though as in the later pieces, animals are a very common subject in small bronze pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 223–237, especially 229–237&lt;/ref&gt;  From slightly before the period of the canonical bronzes, a number of daggers or short swords said to come from Luristan are inscribed with the names of Mesopotamian kings, perhaps reflecting patterns of military service.

The area had, before the period of the bronzes, been the original home of the [[Kassites]], who spoke a non-Iranian language, then under the control of the Iranian-speaking [[Medes]].&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 117&lt;/ref&gt; For most of the period of the bronzes it was, at least in theory, part of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 120, note 6&lt;/ref&gt; As a mountainous rural region, what the rise and fall of these empires meant for the region remains largely uncertain; a [[climate change]] before 1000&amp;nbsp;BC seems to have significantly affected the area.&lt;ref&gt;EI II; Muscarella, 120, note 6&lt;/ref&gt;  The few pieces attributed to Luristan that carry inscriptions are unrecorded pieces from the antiquities market.&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 117, 120 note 6; EI I&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeologists divide the periods producing the bronzes in "Luristan Late Iron" (Age)&amp;nbsp;I to III. Luristan Late Iron&amp;nbsp;II was less productive, and remains less well understood.  Dates for these periods "remain fluid" but "it is possible to suggest that the material from Luristan Iron&amp;nbsp;I was manufactured in the years around 1000&amp;nbsp;B.C., that of Iron&amp;nbsp;II about 900/800–750, and that of Iron&amp;nbsp;III about 750/725–650."&lt;ref&gt;EI, I; Muscarella, 117–119; EI II suggests "ca. 1300/1250 to 700/650 BCE"&lt;/ref&gt;

The stylistic development of the pieces is now thought to be from naturalistic depictions of humans and animals towards stylization, though it is not yet clear if this was a consistent trend. This reverses the trend proposed by [[Michael Rostovtzeff]], one of the earliest writers on the bronzes.&lt;ref&gt;EI, I; Muscarella, 117–119, 136–137&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of objects==
Though there is a wide range of objects, certain types are especially common, distinctive, and hence "canonical".&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 114–115; EI I&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animal finials, standards and tubes===
Among the most characteristic are a range of objects with a hollow socket or open ring, designed to be fixed at the top of a pole or other vertical support, often using a separate intervening fitting. These may be described as finials, standards and tubes; Muscarella and other writers use all these terms, differentiating between them on the basis of the form of their decoration alone. Unlike some other types of objects, very few of this group have been found by the archaeological explorations. They may also have been used with perishable elements that have not survived, either as additional decoration or to hold the ensemble together. Many ideas for their function have been suggested, without any general consensus being reached; one persistent suggestion is that leafy or flowering branches were inserted to top them. The numbers surviving suggest that the objects were not rare, and may have been affordable by most families.&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 136–140&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Standard Finial LACMA M.76.97.13.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Master of Animals]] standard]]

Taking the groups in what is now generally considered to be their broad chronological sequence, the first are the "animal finials", with two rampant [[confronted animals]], generally a pair of large-horned ibex (or goats or [[mouflon]] sheep) or felines, facing each other with a central tube or open rings (formed at the junctions of their front and hind feet) between them.  The [[bezoar ibex]] (''capra aegagrus aegagrusis''), the local wild species of goat or ibex, was already domesticated millennia before;&lt;ref&gt;Melinda A. Zeder, Brian Hesse: ''The Initial Domestication of Goats (''Capra hircus'') in the Zagros Mountains 10,000 Years Ago''. Science 24 March 2000: Vol. 287. no. 5461, pp. 2254–2257 [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/287/5461/2254 online abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; it has large curved horns with knobbly ribs. Compared to later types, the animals are more naturalistic, especially the ibex group, though not so much that their precise species can be very confidently determined.&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 136, 142–146&lt;/ref&gt; In some examples the figures are "demons", with human features except for their large horns.&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 143&lt;/ref&gt;

The next group is a less common type, often called the "idol standard". Here the feline "animal finial" type has in addition a detached human head in between the two heads of the animals, held by their front paws. The designs have become openwork, with enclosed spaces formed by the human head and the head and neck of each feline, and others by their hind legs.  The meaning, if any, of this group is unclear, but they seem if anything to reverse the meaning of the next, much more common group, called the "master of animals standards".&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 146–147&lt;/ref&gt;

These have a fuller figure, now seen down to the waist with an essentially human shape (including what may be divine and "demonic" figures) in between the two animals, grasping them to form the [[Master of Animals]] motif, already over 2000 years old at this point, and a mainstay of [[iconography]] in the [[art of Mesopotamia]]. Now the arms of the human usually extend to grasp the necks of the animals. All the figures are highly stylized, and often the whole composition is repeated underneath, facing in the opposite direction. The bodies of all three figures tend to merge at the middle into the central tube, before diverging again at the lower limbs. The "zoomorphic juncture", where the body of one animal turns into another, is very often seen, with a further human head and pair of animal heads appearing at the waist level of the top set of figures. This second human head often also has a body, and two further animal heads, these typically of cocks, project from it lower down.&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 147–150;  Frankfort, 344-45&lt;/ref&gt;

In the final group, called the "anthromorphic tubes", this lower figure with projecting cock's heads is all that is left, or just the human figure, of which only the head may be at all recognisable. Thus the simplest types are just a tube with a human face near the top, sometimes a [[Janus]] face with two heads back to back, and perhaps some simple mouldings on the tube. Whether these groups actually represent a chronological development with one type succeeding another is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 151–153&lt;/ref&gt; Other tubes are comparable, but use animal rather than human features.&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 248&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Horse cheekpieces===
[[File:Cheekpieces from a Horse Bit LACMA 64.12.40 (2 of 2).jpg|thumb|Some horse cheekpieces have the animal "body" reduced to a rectangle.]]
Another common class of bronzes is pairs of horse cheekpieces from [[Bit (horse)|bits]]; when complete these come with a bar between them that goes in the horse's mouth. There are often rings in the upper or rear parts of the plates, for securing straps to tie round the horse's head.  These are flat openwork plates, with a reinforced central hole for the bit mouthpiece to go through; where complete sets survive these are held in place by the ends of the mouthpiece bar being curled back.&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 155–157; EI II&lt;/ref&gt;

Designs are varied, but most common are animals, very often in fantastic versions with wings, and the Master of Animals. Other subjects include charioteers, and a subject with two figures flanking a tree-like object.  Many examples survive as single plates, perhaps separated after they were dug up.&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 155–157; EI II&lt;/ref&gt;  The common story that the pieces were often found placed underneath the heads of men in burials seems not to be true.  Most pieces were found in unrecorded contexts, but one example of a Luristan [[horse burial]] is known; it is unclear if it was from the same period.&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 157&lt;/ref&gt;

Though horse riding was very common among Near Eastern elites by this date, who all used some type of bit, this large style of cheekpiece is only found in Luristan. The rigid single-piece mouthpiece bar, secured by bent back ends, is also unusual; elsewhere more flexible mouthpieces are found.  Many pieces have small spikes on the reverse of the plates; it is thought these were either used to control the horse, or to fix backing pads of softer material.&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 155&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Pin heads===
[[File:Disc - headed Pin LACMA M.76.97.154 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Face from an otherwise undecorated disk pin]]
Large decorated pin heads are the third common and distinctive type of Luristan bronzes, falling into two distinct groups: sculptural and openwork designs, many using the iconographic repertoire of other types of objects, and flat, normally round, disk heads.  Their use is uncertain; they were probably both used as [[votive offering]]s, as the numbers found in the excavated temple at [[Surkh Dum]] suggests, but also worn as decoration or for fastening clothes. Other uses have been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 122–132 on bronze Surkh Dum finds, 173–180&lt;/ref&gt;  These have not been found in excavated tombs.&lt;ref&gt;EI II&lt;/ref&gt; Pin heads in bone and [[faience]] were also found at Surkh Dum.

The disk-headed pins are made from sheet metal by [[repoussé and chasing]] work, [[engraving]] and other techniques, so differing from the types described above, which are [[casting|cast]].  Many designs centre on a large face, and in general humans predominate over animals in their decoration, another difference to the other types.  The diameter of the disk is typically between 6 and 9 centimetres, and the whole pin and head up to about 20 centimetres.  Similar large face designs are found on some other plaques of uncertain purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 202–206&lt;/ref&gt;

The faces are mostly rounded to fill a circular space, and may be intended as female.  They lack beards, and some full figures are clearly female, sitting with open legs displaying a [[vulva]], perhaps shown in [[childbirth]]; in other pins this is clearly the case.  These pieces were presumably votives for fertility.  The eyes are sometimes inlaid in white, with a black dot for the pupil.  The face may occupy most of the disk, or be small, at the centre of a wide border with other subjects. Other designs feature a wide range of subjects, with some purely decorative motifs, and others featuring some complex, mainly religious, scenes with many figures ("odd-looking demons and animals apparently involved in cultic and mythological activities", as Muscarella describes them).&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 202–206; EI I quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Other types===
Other types include bronzes centred on a large ring, mostly decorated with animals in way similar to the finials and cheekpieces.  These perhaps were part of horse-harnesses.&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 164–165&lt;/ref&gt;  Large socketed pieces are assumed to be handles for [[sharpening stone|whetstone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 182–183&lt;/ref&gt;  Other pieces made from sheet metal include sheets for the front covers of [[quiver]]s, typically divided vertically into registers with small scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 192–202&lt;/ref&gt;  There are cups and [[situlae]], both with rounded bottoms.  Weapons are common, including a type of "spiked axehead" with spreading strips or spikes behind the axehead; these are also found in miniature votive versions.&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 135, 184–191&lt;/ref&gt;  Some examples seem to have had "spikes" that were designed to be functional in combat, others perhaps not.&lt;ref&gt;EI II&lt;/ref&gt;  A kind of long "[[halberd]]-axe" has the head of an animal perched at the top of the blade, and spikes on the other side. Pieces of bronze jewellery such as rings, bracelets pendants and arm or anklets are also found.&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 180–181&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Luxe Grunge''' (also known as '''[[boho-chic]]''' or '''"luxe bohemian"''' &lt;ref&gt;See ''The Times'', 2 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[chic]]er updated [[grunge]]-boho collection; an unkempt approach to wardrobe, popularized by celebrities such as the [[Olsen twins]].{{fact|date=December 2017}}

First motivated by [[Seattle]]'s groundbreaking rock scene in the 1990s – the modern update contains all the mainstays of yesterday’s grunge (flannel, plaid, layers and leg warmers) alongside today’s sophisticated pieces, including capes, shawls and jackets (''[www.theitlists.com], Sept 2006''). Grunge elements featured strongly in fashion collections in Autumn 2006, including styles referred to "cocktail grunge" and "modern [[Gothic fashion|goth]]".&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Times Style'', 24 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lisa Armstrong]], fashion editor of the London ''Times'', referred to [[Patrick Lichfield]]'s iconic 1969 photograph of [[Talitha Getty]] on a Marrakesh roof-top as "typif[ying] the luxe bohemian look" &lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 2 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain celebrities have been sporting this look, most notably [[Taylor Momsen]].{{fact|date=December 2017}}

'''Max Fenichel''' (2 July 1885 – 16 September 1942), also known as '''Maximilian Fenichel''' and '''Menasche (or Menasse) Fenichel''', was an Austrian photographer.

==Biography==
Menasche Fenichel, professionally known as Max Fenichel, worked as a photographer in Vienna, Austria, from 1915 to 1938. He shot photos for the daily newspaper ''Die Stunde'' (The Hour) and the magazine ''Die Bühne'' (The Stage). He also shot formal portraits in his studio, especially of professionals such as rabbis, writers, artists, and performers. Among those who sat for him were the writers [[Vicki Baum]] and [[Ernst Lissauer]], Rabbi Max Grunwald, and painter Ludwig Michalek.

Fenichel was Jewish, and after the [[Anschluss|annexation of Austria by the Nazis]] in 1938 he had to give up his photo studio. He and his wife were deported to the [[Łódź Ghetto|Lodz ghetto]] in October 1941, where both were murdered.

[[File:Spiro Wulfing and Etowah repousse plates HRoe 2012.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|right|Plates from [[Wulfing cache|Malden]], [[Etowah Indian Mounds|Etowah]] and [[Spiro Mounds|Spiro]]]]

'''Mississippian copper plates''', or plaques, are plain and [[Repoussé and chasing|repousséd]] plates of beaten [[copper]] crafted by peoples of the various regional expressions of the [[Mississippian culture]] between 800 and 1600 CE.  They have been found as [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] in [[archaeological site]]s in the American Midwest and Southeast. The plates, found as far afield as Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Wisconsin, were instrumental in the development of the archaeological concept known as the [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex]]. Some of the more notable examples are representations of [[Bird of prey|raptorial birds]] and avian-themed dancing warriors.

==Copper in the Eastern Woodlands==
[[File:Anishanabe1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Diorama of [[Anishinaabe]] people mining copper near [[Lake Superior]]]]
Copper trade routes throughout the [[Eastern Woodlands]] were established during the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic period]] (3000 - 1000 BCE)&lt;ref&gt;Brose et al (1985), Ancient Art of the American Woodlands Indians : 28-9&lt;/ref&gt; and continued into historic times.&lt;ref name="Broseet"&gt;Brose et al (1985), Ancient Art of the American Woodlands Indians : 149&lt;/ref&gt; Copper was usually imported from the [[Great Lakes]] region; however other sources of copper have been found elsewhere including in the [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the Etowah Site in Alabama.&lt;ref&gt;Welch (1991), Moundville's Economy : 184&lt;/ref&gt;

For generations the [[Indigenous peoples in the United States|Indigenous peoples of North America]] pursued copper sources and transmitted the skill of copper’s manipulation and preparation as a special material for use in elite goods on to their descendants. Elites at major political and religious centers during the Mississippian period used copper ornamentation as a sign of their status by crafting the sacred material into representations connected with the Chiefly Warrior cult of the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex. These elites used a trade network that spanned most of North America to acquire exotic trade items from far away, trading their own locally manufactured elite goods and materials.&lt;ref name=ROBB&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kemperartmuseum.wustl.edu/files/spotlightMar10_2.pdf|title=Mildred Lane Kemper Art Museum-Spotlight Series March 2010|first=Matthew H.|last=Robb|publisher=[[Saint Louis Art Museum]]|accessdate=April 19, 2012|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the collapse of the Mississippian way of life in the 1500s with the advent of European colonization, copper still retained a place in Native American religious life as a special material. Copper was traditionally regarded as sacred by many historic period Eastern tribes. Copper nuggets are included in [[medicine bundle]]s among Great Lakes tribes. Among 19th century [[Muscogee Creek people|Muscogee (Creek)]], a group of copper plates carried along the [[Trail of Tears]] are regarded as some of the tribe's most sacred items.&lt;ref name="Broseet" /&gt;

==Methods of manufacture==
[[File:NatCopper.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Unworked copper nugget]]
The [[native copper]], as well as the [[Work hardening|knowledge to work it]], is believed to have come from the Great Lakes area, hundreds of miles to the north of the Cahokia polity and most other Mississippian culture sites, although the copper workshops discovered near [[Mound 34]] at Cahokia are so far the only copper workshops found at a Mississippian culture [[archaeological site]].&lt;ref name=PAWLACZYK/&gt; Researchers at [[Northwestern University|Northwestern’s]] [[Robert R. McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science|School of Engineering and Applied Science]] used an electron microscope to analyze pieces of the flat copper sheets found during excavations at the Mound 34 site at Cahokia. The researchers found that the metal had been repeatedly heated and cooled and while it was softened by the heat, had been hammered, a process known as [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]], similar to how blacksmiths work iron. They were also able to determine that the Cahokian coppersmiths had heated the copper in a wood fire to produce sufficient heat for this process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440311000793|title=Metallurgical analysis of copper artifacts from Cahokia|author1= Chastaina, Matthew L.|author2= Deymier-Black, Alix C.|author3=Kelly, John E.|author4=Brown, James A.|author5= Dunand,David C.|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|volume =38|date=July 2011|pages=1727–1736|issue=7|doi=10.1016/j.jas.2011.03.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WHITE2011/&gt; This process of heating and hammering was repeated over and over until a sheet of the desired thickness was obtained and was sufficient a method to allow the craftsman to work the copper into very thin sheets.&lt;ref name=PAWLACZYK/&gt; Researchers have also tried different techniques to duplicate how larger pieces were manufactured. They determined that the larger pieces had not been [[laminate]]d together but had most likely been [[rivet]]ed together with small copper knobs. Researchers were also able to determine that the artisans cut the copper into the desired shapes by bending the sheet metal back and forth until it broke in the desired location.&lt;ref name=WHITE2011&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=USNews|url=https://www.usnews.com/science/articles/2011/06/15/science-explains-ancient-copper-artifacts|title=Researchers Explain Ancient Copper Artifacts|author= White, Erin|date=June 15, 2011|publisher=U.S.News &amp; World Report LP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mississippian culture repoussé plate making HRoe 2015.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Working the prepared copper plate]]
After the flat sheets of copper were produced, designs were then embossed into the surfaces probably with stone, bone or wooden tools. [[Frank Hamilton Cushing]], an anthropologist working in the early 20th century, worked out a method for flattening and embossing the plates. He hammered raw nuggets of copper smooth and removed imperfections by scouring the surface with a piece of sandstone. He was then able to duplicate the avian designs by resting the sheet of copper on a rawhide pad and pressing into the surface using a piece of pointed deer antler and pressing with his chest. This produced a sharp thin line that when the plate was reversed resembled the embossed lines of the aboriginal artifacts. This process is considered to be roughly similar to how Mississippian coppersmiths probably worked.&lt;ref name=WATKINS1950&gt;{{cite book|title=The Wulfing Plates : Products of Prehistoric Americans|author=Watkins, Virginia D.|year=2010|origyear=1950|publisher=Gustavs Library|asin=B004618COA}}&lt;/ref&gt;


[[File:Mississippian avian themed copper plates HRoe 2012.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Distribution of avian themed copper plates]]
==Iconography==
===Avian themed plates===
Avian themed plates are thought to depict aspects of the ''[[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex#Birdman|Birdman]]'', a major figure in Mississippian iconography closely associated with warfare, ritual dancing, and the game of [[chunkey]].&lt;ref name=ROBB/&gt; Numerous examples of similar avian themed plates have been found in locations across the Midwest and Southeast, from the large cache found in [[Malden, Missouri|Malden]] near the  bootheel region in [[Dunklin County, Missouri]] to others from [[Mangum Mound Site|Mangum]] in Mississippi,&lt;ref name=AA&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Mangum Plate|journal=[[American Antiquity]]|volume=18|date=July 1952|page=65|jstor=276247|issue=1|doi=10.2307/276247}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spiro Mounds|Spiro]] in Oklahoma, [[Etowah Indian Mounds|Etowah]] in Georgia, [[Lake Jackson Mounds Archaeological State Park|Lake Jackson Mounds]] in Florida and other sites in Missouri, Illinois, and Alabama.&lt;ref name=ROBB/&gt;

====Cahokia and the Birdman====
[[File:Bird Man Cahokia USA.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Birdman burial from Cahokia]]
Years of study by archaeologists, ethnologists and historians of artifacts of different materials found at many sites throughout the midwestern and southeastern United States has led many of these researchers to conclude that the cosmology associated with the avian imagery of this artwork originated at [[Cahokia]] (the largest Mississippian culture site, in western Illinois near St Louis, Missouri) between 1100 - 1300 CE. This cosmology was expressed as the "[[Braden style]]", a label applied to [[Mississippian culture pottery|ceramics]], [[Mississippian shell artwork|shell pieces]], [[Mississippian stone statuary|stone statuary]] and copper artifacts all bearing the hallmarks and elements of the same sophisticated style. These pieces were exported to other centers where they were emulated by regional craftsman and became the basis of local styles, such as the "Craig style" of Spiro Mounds, the "Hightower style" of Etowah Mounds and the "[[Hemphill style]]" of Moundville.&lt;ref name=2BROWN2004&gt;{{cite book|author=Brown, James|chapter=Sequencing the Braden style within Mississippian Period Art and Iconography|editor-first=F.

Avian imagery occupied a central place in Cahokian iconography, with examples including an incised sandstone tablet with a birdman excavated from [[Monks Mound]] and an elaborate elite personage burial in [[Mound 72#Birdman burial|Mound 72]] with thousands of shell beads arranged in the shape of a bird.&lt;ref name=ROBB/&gt;

Although no copper plates other than some small fragments have ever been found at Cahokia, it is the only Mississippian culture site to date where a copper workshop has been located by archaeologists.&lt;ref name=ROBB/&gt;&lt;ref name=PAWLACZYK&gt;{{ cite news|newspaper=SOTT.net|publisher=Signs of the Times|last=Pawlaczyk|first= George|authorlink=George Pawlaczyk|url=http://www.sott.net/articles/show/203233-Copper-men-Archaeologists-uncover-%0AStone-Age-copper-workshop-near-Monk-s-Mound-in-Illinois|title=Copper men: Archaeologists uncover Stone Age copper workshop near Monk's Mound|date=February 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excavations of the copper workshops at [[Mound 34]], (a small mound located on the Ramey Plaza east of [[Monks Mound]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cahokiamounds.org/explore/cahokia-mounds/number/34/|title=Cahokia Mounds - Mound 34|publisher=Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425233858/http://cahokiamounds.org/explore/cahokia-mounds/number/34|archivedate=April 25, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) indicate copper was worked there. The area contains the remains of three tree stumps thought to have been used to hold anvil stones used for beating out the flattened sheets of copper.&lt;ref name=PAWLACZYK/&gt; However, despite the lack of copper plates, one copper artifact has been found at the site.

===Other themes===
[[File:Etowah copper pieces HRoe 2007.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Bi-lobed arrow plates from Etowah]]
Many of the hundreds of plates found have not been specifically avian themed and come in a variety of other shapes.

==Known locations==

===Arkansas plates===
[[File:Toul Creek plate HRoe 2012.jpg|upright=0.75|thumb|Toul Creek plate from northern Arkansas]]
A number of plates have been found in various sites in eastern [[Arkansas]]. At least three of the Arkansas examples (Rose Mound, Scott Place, and Clay Hill) and two others (a {{convert|32.6 |cm|in|sp=us}} found in a [[Dallas Phase]] burial at the [[Henry Farm Site]] (40 LO 53) in [[Loudon County, Tennessee]] in 1975 and a specimen unexamined by archaeologists thought to come either from the [[Neeley’s Ferry Site|Neeley’s Ferry]] (3 CS 24) or Rose Mound sites in Cross County) have stylistic similarities that indicate they may have all been made by the same artist. Four of the five were found in the [[St. Francis River]] Valley area of Arkansas. Researchers think the five plates may represent a composite creature that is part snake and part hawk as the shape of the tail feathers resemble a rattlesnakes' rattle or that the design may represent a hawk in the act of swallowing a snake.&lt;ref name=MITCHEM2008&gt;{{cite conference|conference=Southeastern Archaeological Conference|location=Charlotte, North Carolina|date=November 13, 2008|title=Mississippian copper artifacts from Arkansas|author=Mitchem, Jeffrey M.|url=https://uark.academia.edu/JeffreyMMitchem/Papers/1288775/Mississippian_Copper_Artifacts_from_Arkansas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A copper plate found at the [[Clay Hill Site]] (3 LE 11) in [[Lee County, Arkansas]] has the same chest region design and long narrow shape and distinctive tail feathers as the Scott Site and Rose Mound examples. Although fragmented it is approximately {{convert|14|in|cm}} in length. It was recorded to be in a private collection in 1978 but has not been seen since. The plate was found in an [[Armorel Phase]] burial that also contained a [[Clarksdale bell]], an item of European manufacture that is a hallmark of the 1541 [[Hernando de Soto]] excursion through the southeast. This does not date the era for the production of the plate though as such items were often kept as heirlooms for long periods, even many generations, before they ended up becoming [[grave goods]].&lt;ref name=MITCHEM2008/&gt;

In 1910 [[Clarence Bloomfield Moore]] found a stylized hawk or eagle plate while excavating graves at the [[Rose Mound Site]] (3 CS 27) in [[Cross County, Arkansas]]. The plate was {{convert|16.25|in|cm}} and remarkably well preserved, missing only the tip of one wing. The plate is not embossed but merely a shape cut from a flat copper sheet.&lt;ref name=MITCHEM2008/&gt;

In the 1970s a copper bird {{convert|28|cm|in|sp=us}} in length was found by looters at the [[Scott Site]] (3 MS 24), also known as Big Lake Bridge, in [[Mississippi County, Arkansas]]. The specimen was located at the back of the head of an extended adult burial, and may have been bent over the top of the head. Eight plain pottery vessels grave good vessels were found with it.&lt;ref name=MITCHEM2008/&gt;

A possible partial avian style plate was found at the [[Magness Site]] (3 IN 8) in [[Independence County, Arkansas]] along with several [[Mississippian culture shell objects#Shell Cups|engraved shell cups]]. The plate is a typical head portion with the forked eye, earspool, and elaborate headdress and hairdo known from other examples.

A {{convert|8|in|cm}} avian themed plate very similar to the Wulfing Plates copper plate was discovered at the [[Toul Creek Site]] in [[Baxter County, Arkansas]] by several local farmers.

===Etowah and the Rogan plates===
[[File:Rogan plate 1 birdman HRoe 2012.jpg|thumb|upright|Rogan plate, A91117]]
{{main|Etowah plates}} 
The Rogan plates were discovered in a [[stone box grave]] within Mound C at the [[Etowah Indian Mounds|Etowah Site]] by [[John P. Rogan]] in the 1880s. Several are very similar to plates later found at Lake Jackson Mounds, and it is believed that the Lake Jackson plates came from Etowah. The designs of the plates are in the Classic Braden style from the Cahokian area, and it is generally thought that some of the plates were manufactured at Cahokia before ending up at sites in the Southeast.&lt;ref name=BOLFING2010/&gt; The two Rogan plates were interred as a pair and are very similar to one another. The first is approximately {{convert|20|in|cm}} and the second {{convert|16|in|cm}}.

These plates, along with artifacts from Spiro and [[Moundville Archaeological Site]] were instrumental in the development of the archaeological concept of the S.E.C.C.

===Florida plates===
[[File:Lake Jackson Braden Style Birdman Plate HRoe 2016.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Copper Solar Ogee Deity plate found at Lake Jackson Mounds, Florida]]
Although at the periphery of the Mississippian world, Florida has been the site of the discovery many S.E.C.C. associated copper artworks. Archaeologists believe that this is because of the [[busycon]] shell trade, the shells being a valuable ritual and high status trade good to Mississippian elites. It has even been proposed that the [[Fort Walton culture]] founders of the [[Lake Jackson Mounds Archaeological State Park|Lake Jackson Mounds Site]] moved east and founded the settlement in approximately 1100 CE to strategically position themselves in this trade network. Lake Jackson trade for copper pieces seems to have taken place almost exclusively with the Etowah polity of north central Georgia. When Mound 3 at the site was excavated it yielded fourteen copper plates, deposited in the burial mound sometime between 1300—1500 CE.&lt;ref name=LEDOUX2009&gt;{{cite thesis|title=Embodying the Sacred : Temporal Changes in the Cosmological Function of Art and Symbolism in the Mississippian Period, AD 1250-1400|author= LeDoux, Spencer C.|degree=Honors|year=2009|publisher=Texas State University-San Marcos |chapter=Chapter 4 : The Lake Jackson Site|url= https://digital.library.txstate.edu/bitstream/handle/10877/3248/fulltext.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The so-called "Copper Solar Ogee Deity," a {{convert|21|in|cm}} high repoussé copper plate, depicts the profile of a dancing winged figure, wielding a ceremonial mace in its right hand and a severed head in the left. The extended, curling nose resembles a [[proboscis]] and resembles another S.E.C.C. motif, the long-nosed god maskette. The figures elaborate headdress includes a bi-lobed arrow motif and, at the top of the plate, an ogee motif surrounded by a chambered circle. Some art historians have argued that this plate and one of the Rogan plates may represent a female or "Birdwoman" because the breast on the figure protrudes slightly more than it does on other examples, while others have argued that the plate may represent a third gender or "[[two-spirit]]" tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Power (2004), Early Art of the Southeastern Indians : 103&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Birdman, Birdwoman : Queering archeology at Lake Jackson|author=Bloch, Lee|url= http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UF00027829/00209/47j|volume=62|journal=The Florida Anthropologist|date=June 2010|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the collapse of the Etowah polity in approximately 1375 trade continued for the Lake Jackson peoples, albeit now with peoples located in the northern Georgia and eastern Tennessee area. No longer able to get the elaborate copper plates from Etowah, a local style developed, producing a new style of such as that depicted on the "Elder Birdman" plate, thought to represent the merger of the Birdman corpus with a local solar deity.&lt;ref name=LEDOUX2009/&gt;

Further east and south into Florida were non-Mississippian culture peoples who were involved in long distance trade of local high status items such as busycon shells for gorgets and [[yaupon]] holly for the [[black drink]]. The [[Mill Cove Complex]] is a [[St. Johns culture]] site in [[Duval County, Florida]] with two sand burial mounds, one [[platform mound]] shaped and associated village habitation areas. [[Clarence Bloomfield Moore]] excavated the mounds in 1894 and found numerous copper grave goods, including two copper [[long-nosed god maskette]]s and 11 copper plates. The one plate found in the Shields Mound was plain, but several of the other 10 found in the Grant Mound were decorated with an oval central boss and ringed with an oval embossed or beaded line. They measured {{convert|10|cm|in|sp=us}}-{{convert|15|cm|in|sp=us}} to {{convert|5|cm|in|sp=us}}-{{convert|10|cm|in|sp=us}}. They had perforated holes for hanging. Archaeologists speculate they were used either for gorgets or headdress ornaments. Analysis of the metal in the plaques has connected them to locations in the Great Lakes region, Wisconsin and the Appalachian Mountains.&lt;ref name=ASHLEY2002&gt;{{cite journal|title=On the periphery of the Early Mississippian world : Looking within and beyond Northeastern Florida|author=Ashley, Keith H.|journal=Southeastern Archaeology| url=http://www.unf.edu/~kashley/Other%20Files/2002-periphery.pdf|volume=2|year=2002|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Located in central Florida, the [[Old Okahumpka Site]] (8 LA 57) is a now destroyed burial mound in [[Lake County, Florida]] near the modern town of [[Okahumpka, Florida|Okahumpka]]. The site was excavated by Clarence B. Moore in the 1890s. During his excavation he found a burial associated plate measuring {{convert|7.1|cm|in|sp=us}} wide by {{convert|15.2|cm|in|sp=us}} in length and depicting the lower portion of a dancing figure wearing a sash, kilt, cuffed [[moccasin]]s, and holding a knife. The design is almost identical to two examples known from Spiro and a site in [[Jackson County, Alabama]], although of the three it is the only one to show a figure wielding a knife. Archaeologists estimate the plate was deposited in the mound sometime between 1100 and 1300 CE. The plate is now part of the collection of the [[National Museum of the American Indian]].&lt;ref name=MITCHEM1996&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Florida Anthropologist|title=The Old Okahumpka Site (8LA57): Late Prehistoric Iconography and Mississippian Influence in Peninsular Florida |url=https://www.academia.edu/1101995/The_Old_Okahumpka_Site_8LA57_Late_Prehistoric_Iconography_and_Mississippian_Influence_in_Peninsular_Florida|author=Jeffrey M.

From an unknown location on the west coast of central Florida comes the Wilcox plate, a partial avian themed copper plate showing the middle section details of scalloped wings, tail feathers and a raptors leg and claw in the Malden style very similar to the Wulfing plates. It was discovered somewhere near [[Waldo, Florida]] in [[Levy County, Florida|Levy County]] in the 1880s, where it was purchased from a local doctor by [[Joseph Wilcox]] for the [[Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia]].

===Illinois plates===
[[File:Upper Bluff Lake Dancing Figures plate HRoe 2012.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Upper Bluff Lake Dancing Birdmen plate]]
Outside of Cahokia, Illinois has seen the discovery of many Mississippian culture copper items including copper maces, ear spools, several avian plates, a wooden copper covered mask (known as the [[Emmons mask]]), and headdress pieces. Three copper plates have been found, one of them been identified as being from the same workshop as the Wulfing plates and others as having stylistic similarities with the Wulfing, Spiro and Etowah plates.&lt;ref name=MISSCOPPFROMILLINOIS/&gt;

The Edwards falcon plate is a {{convert|37.8|cm|in|sp=us}} by {{convert|11.3|cm|in|sp=us}} copper avian plate found at the [[Material Service Quarry Site]] in [[La Salle County, Illinois]]. Before it was deposited as a grave good it had its head riveted on in the reverse position. It is one of several plates found in Illinois believed to have been made by the same workshop as the Malden plates.&lt;ref name=MISSCOPPFROMILLINOIS/&gt;

The Upper Bluff Lake plates are two plates found at the [[Saddle Site]] (11U284) in [[Union County, Illinois]] in the 1880s, in the same stone box grave. One of the plates is avian themed and the other a unique double birdman design, but still within the corpus of the S.E.C.C. The Upper Bluff Lake falcon plate is a {{convert|25.7|cm|in|sp=us}} by {{convert|8.25|cm|in|sp=us}} avian themed Wulfing style plate. It has a mostly intact tail, which the Malden plates do not, and has helped archaeologists understand what the tails of the other pieces would have looked like.&lt;ref name=MISSCOPPFROMILLINOIS/&gt; The Dancing Figures plate is a rectangular {{convert|15.5|cm|in|sp=us}} by {{convert|16.5|cm|in|sp=us}} plate depicting two Birdman figures holding ceremonial chipped flint maces, possibly dancing, and shielding themselves from a possible liquid or ropelike motif falling from the top center of the plate.

===Malden plates or the Wulfing cache===
[[File:Wulfing plate A human headed avian HRoe 2012.jpg|thumb|upright|upright=0.75|Human headed avian Malden Plate A]]
{{main|Wulfing cache}}
The plates of the ''Wulfing cache'', named after an early owner, were discovered by a farmer named Ray Groomes while plowing a field south of [[Malden, Missouri|Malden]] in [[Dunklin County, Missouri]] in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Brose et al (1985), Ancient Art of the American Woodlands Indians : 213&lt;/ref&gt; The eight plates, made in the Late Braden style associated with Cahokia, are thought to date to the late 13th or early 14th century.&lt;ref name=ROBB/&gt; The Wulfing plates depict raptors and one bird-human hybrids, ranging human heads to raptor's heads to double-headed raptors on stylized bird's bodies, with naturalistic bird's claws.&lt;ref&gt;Brose et al (1985), Ancient Art of the American Woodlands Indians : 164-6&lt;/ref&gt; The plates were found buried in a field with no known local mounds or village sites. They had been considerably used prior to their burial, as each plates shows multiple episodes of aboriginal repair work including patch repairs and riveted cracks.&lt;ref name=WATKINS1950/&gt;

The eight plates are designated Plates A-H. Plate A, the only anthropomorphic human headed avian in the Wulfing cache, measures {{convert|30|cm|in|sp=us}} in length by {{convert|13.5|cm|in|sp=us}} in width and weighs {{convert|84|g|oz}}.&lt;ref name=WATKINS1950/&gt;

Many similar plates found in other states are now believed to have come from the same workshop, if not the same artist, as the Wulfing cache. The sites of the discovery of these other plates span the United States from central Florida to northern Illinois to Oklahoma, and include the Upper Bluff Lake falcon plate, the Toul Creek plate, the Reed Mound plate, the Edwards plate,&lt;ref name=MISSCOPPFROMILLINOIS/&gt; and the Wilcox plate,&lt;ref name="MITCHEM" /&gt; as well as showing stylistic links to plates found in burials at Etowah and Spiro.&lt;ref name=ROBB/&gt;

===Spiro plates===
[[File:Spiro human headed avian plate HRoe 2012.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|Anthropomorphic human headed avian plate from Spiro]]
[[Spiro Mounds]] is a [[Caddoan Mississippian culture]] archaeological site located in present-day [[LeFlore County, Oklahoma]]. In the 1930s the only burial mound at the site, the Craig Mound, was looted by locals who used [[dynamite]] on the mound to gain access to its interior. Once inside the {{convert|10|ft|m}} high and {{convert|15|ft|m}} wide cavity the looters discovered almost perfectly preserved fragile artifacts made of wood, [[Lightning whelk|conch shell]], fabric of vegetal and animal fibers, lace, fur, feathers and copper. The Great Mortuary, as the hollow interior has since became known to archaeologists, was a burial structure for Spiro's rulers. It was created as a circle of sacred [[Ulmus crassifolia|cedar posts]] sunk in the ground and angled together at the top like a ''[[tipi]]''. The cone-shaped chamber was covered with layers of earth to create the mound, and it never collapsed. Minerals percolating through the mound hardened the chamber's log walls, making them resistant to decay and shielding the perishable artifacts inside from direct contact with the earth. No other Mississippian mound has been found with such a hollow space inside it or with such large and distinctive collection of preserved artifacts. Among the grave goods were numerous copper pieces, including [[ear-spool]]s, [[Celt (tool)|{{not a typo|celts}}]], copper sheathed wooden knives&lt;ref name=PHOTOESSAY/&gt; and 265  repoussé plates.&lt;ref name=MISSCOPPFROMILLINOIS/&gt; One of the more famous of these copper plates depicts a man's head, possibly severed, in profile, with a Forked Eye motif, an ear-spool, and hair styled into an occipital hair knot from which a single feather projects.&lt;ref&gt;Brose et al (1985), Ancient Art of the American Woodlands Indians : 142-3&lt;/ref&gt; The plate measures {{convert|24|cm|in|sp=us}} by {{convert|17.4|cm|in|sp=us}}.&lt;ref&gt;Brose et al (1985), Ancient Art of the American Woodlands Indians : 211&lt;/ref&gt; Another of the plates is the avian themed "naturalistic hawk cutout", which measures {{convert|11.5|in|cm}} in width.&lt;ref name=PHOTOESSAY&gt;{{cite book|title=The Spiro Mound:A photo essay|author1=Larry G.

Some of the other repoussé copper pieces found include eight examples of copper "feathers" that were worn as hair ornaments.&lt;ref name=PHOTOESSAY/&gt;

==Other copper items==
[[File:Spiro copper ear spools HRoe 2005.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|Copper earspools from Spiro]]
Besides the repoussé copper plates, Mississippian people also created copper axes, knives, gorgets, beads, and fishhooks, as well as wooden beads and [[ear spool]]s covered in copper.&lt;ref&gt;Welch (1991), Moundville's Economy : 69, 168&lt;/ref&gt; [[Long-nosed god maskette]]s, a special kind of ear ornamentation, are sometimes found made of copper. Copper examples have been found at the Gahagan Mounds Site in Louisiana and at the Grant Mound in Florida, each of which produced two of the earpieces.&lt;ref name=ASHLEY2002/&gt; Several copper covered cedar knives were found in the Great Mortuary mound at Spiro.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21275">'''One City One Book''' (also '''One Book One City''', '''''[City]'' Reads''', '''On the Same Page''' and other variations) is a generic name for a community reading program that attempts to get everyone in a city to read and discuss the same book. The name of the program is often reversed to One Book One City, or is customized to name the city where it occurs. Popular book picks have been [[Harper Lee]]'s ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'', [[Ernest Gaines]]'s ''[[A Lesson Before Dying]]'', [[Ray Bradbury]]'s ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'', and [[Rudolfo Anaya]]'s ''[[Bless Me, Ultima]]''.&lt;ref name="LOC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/cfbook/one-book.html |title="One Book" Reading Promotion Projects |accessdate=2008-05-02 |publisher=Library of Congress - Center for the Book |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501024447/http://www.loc.gov/loc/cfbook/one-book.html |archivedate=May 1, 2008 }}

==History==

One City One Book programs take the idea of a localized [[book discussion club]] and expand it to cover a whole city.&lt;ref name = "LJ2002"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
The first such program was "If All of Seattle Read the Same Book" in 1998, started by [[Nancy Pearl]] at [[Seattle Public Library]]'s Washington Center for the Book.&lt;ref name = "AmericanLibraries2005"&gt;
{{Citation

 | issn =  0002-9769 
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The book chosen for the program was 'The Sweet Hereafter' by [[Russell Banks]], written in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Getting On The Same Page -- Library's 'If All Of Seattle Read The Same Book' Program Hopes To Get The City Reading - And Talking - Together |first=Ferdinand M. |last=De Leon |newspaper=Seattle TImes |date=November 5, 1998 |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19981105&amp;slug=2781661 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Other cities copied the idea, and the Library of Congress listed 404 programs occurring in 2007.&lt;ref name = "LOC" /&gt;

Each city's program has its own goals; these typically include building a sense of community and promoting literacy.&lt;ref name = "ALAGuide" /&gt;{{rp|5}}
Nancy Pearl warns against expecting too much from a program: "Keep in mind that this is a library program, it's not an exercise in civics, it's not intended to have literature cure the racial divide. This is about a work of literature."&lt;ref name = "LJ2002" /&gt;

Programs typically involve more than having everyone read the same book. Some other activities that have been included are: book discussion sessions, scholarly lectures on the book or related topics, a visit by the author, exhibits, related arts programming (especially showing a movie of the book if there is one), and integration into school curricula.&lt;ref name = "ALAGuide"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|20–23}}
In Boston the "[[One City One Story]]" program used shorter stories and distributed tens of thousands of free copies of the story over the course of a month.

[[American Library Association]] puts out a detailed step-by-step guide&lt;ref name = "ALAGuide" /&gt; on how to organize a local program, including the critical step of picking the one book. The [[Center for the Book]] at the [[Library of Congress]] tracks all known programs and the books they have used.&lt;ref name = "LOC" /&gt;

=== Significant "One Book" programs ===
''Most listed are in the United States, perhaps because the meme started there and similar programs elsewhere have a different name.''

Programs sponsored by public libraries are tracked each year by the Library of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;At [http://www.read.gov/resources/state.php Read.gov]. Retrieved Jun 28, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  Most programs maintain their own websites devoted to the annual effort.

==== USA ====
The Library of Congress maintains a website with resources for cities that want to run One Book programs, including a partial [http://www.read.gov/resources/authorlist.php list of authors] and [http://www.read.gov/resources/state.php list of past programs].  Some states and the [[American Library Association|ALA]] maintain their own resources to help cities get started.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance the ALA's [http://www.lita.org/ala/aboutala/offices/ppo/programming/onebook/files/onebookguide.pdf One Book guide], and Michigan state's list of [http://www.michigan.gov/mde/0,1607,7-140-54574_36788_40452---,00.html related resources]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107141419/http://www.lita.org/ala/aboutala/offices/ppo/programming/onebook/files/onebookguide.pdf |date=January 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[National Endowment for the Arts]] has run [http://www.neabigread.org/ The Big Read] since 2006. The program gives grants to communities across the nation each year to develop community-wide reading programs based on a book selected from The Big Read's library.  New titles are added to the library on a yearly basis.&lt;ref name = "BigRead"&gt;

Colleges

Some colleges have begun One College One Book programs in addition to the more common summer reading programs for incoming First Year students. The Department of Elementary and Early Childhood Education at the College of New Jersey has been running a One Book, One Department program for all of the students in its major since 2008, requiring students to read a common work of literary non-fiction in both summer and winter breaks. The first book used was Ann Fadiman's The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down and the book for summer 2014 is Dan Fagin's Pulitzer Prize winning Toms River.

==== United Kingdom ====

[http://cityreads.co.uk/ City Reads], Brighton is the longest running and most consistent 'big read' in the UK. Led by artistic director [https://about.me/sarah.hutchings Sarah Hutchings], it is delivered by award-winning literary organisation [https://web.archive.org/web/20160304113311/http://cityreads.co.uk/about/collected-works-cic%20Collected%20Works%20CIC Collected Works CIC]. City Reads is an annual collective reading festival conceived to spread a love of books and ideas to the widest possible audience throughout Brighton &amp; Hove, with a healthy reach into the South East region. Over three weeks in October one book is chosen for the whole community to creatively engage with in a series of special events, workshops and performances. Through the outstanding quality of its work, its ability to foster collaboration and the partnerships that support the Festival, City Reads brings regional and national attention to the importance of shared reading and the benefits it can bring to the whole community. 2015 marks the 10th anniversary of City Reads, Brighton. The City Reads slogan is: '''''One city. One book. A thousand conversations...''''' The Festival began in 2005 when the City celebrated Penguin Books' 70th Anniversary and read Lewis Carroll's ''Alice in Wonderland''. In 2013, with the support of writer, broadcaster and former children's laureate Michael Rosen Young City Reads was launched. Working with primary aged children at KS2 level, Young City Reads is thought to be the first 'big read' for children in the UK, on such a large scale.

Southampton University:
One Book, One Southampton (OBOS) is the University of Southampton’s initiative to engage with our community through reading. Similar initiatives have been trialled in other institutions internationally, but there are very few UK University One Book programmes. The University encourage staff, students and our local and international community to join us in debates, lectures, talks and online forums to discuss OBOS and explore the themes, subjects and debates that the book raises. You can listen to discussions on the subject, and attend events about the book. The University of Southampton announced that the 2014 book will be Empire by Jeremy Paxman.&lt;ref&gt;https://blog.soton.ac.uk/onebook/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alternate programs ===
Some cities that have run independent One Book programs have later joined Big Read instead.  An annual "One World, Many Stories" summer reading campaign for children, which has a single selection for the country, has become popular as well.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance [http://ca.evanced.info/lapl/sr/homepage.asp?ProgramID=4 Los Angeles], 
[http://hmcpl.org/2011/05/embark-your-summer-reading-journey Huntsville], and [http://www.idahokidsread.org/ Idaho] libraries. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709145617/http://ca.evanced.info/lapl/sr/homepage.asp?ProgramID=4 |date=July 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical responses ==

For some, the mere idea of reading as a communal activity is repellent. The literary critic [[Harold Bloom]] said, "I don't like these mass reading bees.... It is rather like the idea that we are all going to pop out and eat Chicken McNuggets or something else horrid at once."&lt;ref name = "NYT2002Fight"&gt;

Others are concerned about the temptation to use such a program to promote social values. [[Phillip Lopate]] fears a promotion of [[groupthink]], saying "It is a little like a science fiction plot -- 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' or something."&lt;ref name = "NYT2002Fight " /&gt;

In [[New York City]] in 2002, the effort foundered when the selectors split into two rival groups, each with its own favorite: [[Chang-Rae Lee]]'s ''[[Native Speaker (novel)|Native Speaker]]'' and [[James McBride (writer)|James McBride]]'s ''[[The Color of Water]]''. Both books were considered to be offensive to some of New York's ethnic groups.&lt;ref name = "LJ2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "NYT2002"&gt;

Nancy Pearl said,
"It's turned into something not to do with literature but to do with curing the ills in society, and while there is a role for that, to ask a book to fit everybody's agenda in talking about particular issues just does a disservice to literature."&lt;ref name = "Guardian2002"&gt;

Governments are sometimes concerned that their endorsement of reading a book will be viewed as endorsing the ideas or language of the book. In Texas in 2006, the [[Galveston County]] Reads committee recommended [[Mark Haddon]]'s ''[[The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time]]'' as the choice for their county-wide read. There was much criticism of the choice from the Mayor and Council of [[Friendswood]], who objected to obscenity in the novel, and said that it contained ideas that should not be promoted to kids and that taxpayer money should not be used to promote and purchase a book the community wouldn't approve of.&lt;ref name = "Galveston"&gt;

'''Peer-to-peer file sharing''' is the distribution and sharing of [[digital media]] using [[peer-to-peer]] (P2P) networking technology. P2P [[file sharing]] allows users to access media files such as books, music, movies, and games using a P2P software program that searches for other connected computers on a P2P network to locate the desired content.&lt;ref name="Carmack"&gt;{{cite web|last=Carmack |first=Carman|url= http://computer.howstuffworks.com/bittorrent1.htm|title=How Bit Torrent Works|work=computer.howstuffworks.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nodes (peers) of such networks are end-user computers and distribution servers (not required).

Peer-to-peer file sharing technology has evolved through several design stages from the early networks like [[Napster]], which popularized the technology, to the later models like the [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] protocol. Microsoft uses it for Update distribution (Windows 10) and online playing games (e.g. the [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|mmorpg]] [[Skyforge]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/3dmzhz/heads_up_if_youre_installing_skyforge_the/|title=Heads up if you're installing Skyforge - The downloader is a P2P client and by default starts with Windows. • /r/MMORPG|website=reddit|access-date=2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;) use it as their content distribution network for downloading large amounts of data without incurring the dramatic costs for bandwidth inherent when providing just a single source.

Several factors contributed to the widespread adoption and facilitation of peer-to-peer file sharing. These included increasing Internet bandwidth, the widespread digitization of physical media, and the increasing capabilities of residential personal computers. Users are able to transfer one or more files from one computer to another across the Internet through various [[file transfer]] systems and other file-sharing networks.&lt;ref name="Carmack" /&gt;

==History==
Peer-to-peer file sharing became popular in with the introduction of [[Napster]], a file sharing application and a set of central servers that linked people who had files with those who requested files. The central index server indexed the users and their shared content. When someone searched for a file, the server searched all available copies of that file and presented them to the user. The files would be transferred directly between the two private computers. A limitation was that only music files could be shared.&lt;ref name="Tyson"&gt;{{cite web|last=Tyson|first= Jeff|url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/napster2.htm|title=How the Old Napster Worked|work=howstuffworks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because this process occurred on a central server, however, Napster was held liable for copyright infringement and shut down in July 2001. It later reopened as a pay service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.murdoch.edu.au/elaw/issues/v11n1/douglas111.html|title= Copyright and Peer-To-Peer Music File Sharing: The Napster Case and the Argument Against Legislative Reform|date= March 2004|work=murdoch.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Napster was shut down, the most popular peer-to-peer services were [[Gnutella]] and [[Kazaa]]. These services also allowed users to download files other than music, such as movies and games.&lt;ref name="Tyson" /&gt;

===Technology evolution ===
[[Napster]] and [[eDonkey2000]], which both used a central server-based model, may be classified as the first generation of P2P systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gong|first1=Yiming|title=Identifying P2P users using traffic analysis|url=http://www.symantec.com/connect/articles/identifying-p2p-users-using-traffic-analysis|publisher=Symantec|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These systems relied on the operation of the respective central servers, and thus were susceptible to centralized shutdown. The second generation of P2P file sharing encompasses networks like [[Kazaa]], [[Gnutella]] and [[Gnutella2]], which are able to operate without any central servers, eliminated the central vulnerability by connecting users remotely to each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Watson|first=Stephanie|url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/kazaa3.htm|title=How Kazaa Works|work=computer.howstuffworks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third generation of filesharing networks are the so-called [[darknet]]s, including networks like [[Freenet]], which provide user anonymity in addition to the independence from central servers.

The [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] protocol represents a special case. In principle, it is a filesharing protocol of the first generation, relying on central servers called ''trackers'' to coordinate users. However, it does not form a network in the traditional sense. Instead new, separate networks of coordinating users are created for every set of files, called a ''torrent''. Newer extensions of the protocol removes the need of centralized trackers, allow the usage of a decentralized server-independent network for source identification purposes, referred to as the [[Mainline DHT]]. This allows BitTorrent to encompass certain aspects of a filesharing network of the second generation as well. Users create an index file containing the metadata of the files they want to share, and upload the index files to websites where they are shared with others.

Peer-to-peer file sharing is also efficient in terms of cost.&lt;ref name="Babaoglu 2012"&gt;{{cite web|last=Babaoglu|first=Ozalp|title=Introduction to Peer-to-Peer Systems|url=http://www.cs.unibo.it/babaoglu/courses/cas/slides/p2p.pdf|work=Complex Systems|publisher=Universitá di Bologna|accessdate=6 February 2013|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ijcsits.org/papers/vol3no22013/1vol3no2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The system administration overhead is smaller because the user is the provider and usually the provider is the administrator as well. Hence each network can be monitored by the users themselves. At the same time, large servers sometimes require more storage and this increases the cost since the storage has to be rented or bought exclusively for a server. However, usually peer-to-peer file sharing does not require a [[dedicated server]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Winkelman|first=Dr. Roy|title=Software|url=http://fcit.usf.edu/network/chap6/chap6.htm|publisher=Florida Center for Instructional Technology College of Education, University of South Florida,|accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economic impact ==
{{Main article|File sharing#Economic impact|l1=Effects of file sharing}}
There is still ongoing discussion about the economic impact of P2P file sharing. Norbert Michel, a policy analyst at the [[Heritage Foundation]], said that because of "econometric and data issues, studies thus far have produced disparate estimates of file sharing's impact on album sales."&lt;ref name="heritage.org"&gt;J. Michel, Norbert. [http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2004/08/internet-file-sharing-the-evidence-so-far-and-what-it-means-for-the-future Internet File Sharing and The Evidence So far], heritage.org, August 23, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''[[The Wealth of Networks]]'', [[Yochai Benkler]] states that peer-to-peer file sharing is economically efficient and that the users pay the full transaction cost and marginal cost of such sharing even if it "throws a monkey wrench into the particular way in which our society has chosen to pay musicians and re-cording executives. This trades off efficiency for longer-term incentive effects for the recording industry. However, it is efficient within the normal meaning of the term in economics in a way that it would not have been had Jack and Jane used subsidized computers or network connections".&lt;ref name="Yochai Benkler"&gt;{{cite book | author = Yochai Benkler | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=McotnvNSjQ4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=benkler#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=falsee | title = Wealth of Networks | publisher = Yale University Press | isbn = 0300127235 | date = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As peer-to-peer file sharing can be used to exchange files for which the distribution right was granted (e.g. [[public domain]], [[Creative Commons]], [[Copyleft|Copyleft licenses]], online games, updates, ...).

Especially startups can save massive amounts of money compared with other means of [[content delivery network]]s.

A calculation example:

with peer to peer file sharing: &lt;math&gt;\text{total cost} = \frac{\text{filesize}}{\text{customers}} \times \text{cost-per-byte}&lt;/math&gt;

with casual content delivery networks: &lt;math&gt;\text{total cost} = \text{filesize} \times \text{customers} \times \text{cost-per-byte}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Music industry ===
The economic effect of copyright infringement through peer-to-peer file sharing on music revenue has been controversial and difficult to determine. Unofficial studies found that file sharing had a negative impact on record sales.&lt;ref&gt;Alejandro Zentner, [http://www.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1452&amp;amp;context=bejeap "File Sharing and International Sales of Copyrighted Music: An Empirical Analysis with a Panel of Countries"], ''The B.E.

Also many independent artists choose a peer-to-peer file sharing method named [[BitTorrent Bundle]] for distribution.

===Film industry===
The [[MPAA]] reported that American studios lost $2.373 billion to Internet piracy in 2005, representing approximately one third of the total cost of film piracy in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF|url=http://www.MPAA.org/press_releases/2006_05_31.pdf|title=SWEDISH AUTHORITIES SINK PIRATE BAY: Huge Worldwide Supplier of Illegal Movies Told No Safe Harbors for Facilitators of Piracy!|date=2006-05-31|publisher=[[MPAA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MPAA's estimate was doubted by commentators since it was based on the assumption that one download was equivalent to one lost sale, and downloaders might not purchase the movie if illegal downloading was not an option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/21/business/yourmoney/21view.html?ex=1258693200&amp;en=a210357f5dcc8523&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt |title=Does a Free Download Equal a Lost Sale? |first=Daniel |last=Gross |date=2004-11-21 |accessdate=2007-07-16 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.unc.edu/~cigar/papers/FileSharing_March2004.pdf|first=Felix|last=Oberholzer|author2=Strumpf, Koleman|title=The Effect of File Sharing on Record Sales: An Empirical Analysis|date=March 2004|publisher=[[UNC Chapel Hill]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

A 2010 study, commissioned by the [[International Chamber of Commerce]] and conducted by independent Paris-based economics firm TERA, estimated that unlawful downloading of music, film and software cost Europe's creative industries several billion dollars in revenue each year.&lt;ref&gt;Mundell, Ian.

March 18, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the TERA study entitled "Building a Digital Economy: The Importance of Saving Jobs in the EU's Creative Industries" predicted losses due to piracy reaching as much as 1.2 million jobs and €240 billion in retail revenue by 2015 if the trend continued.  Researchers applied a substitution rate of ten percent to the volume of copyright infringements per year. This rate corresponded to the number of units potentially traded if unlawful file sharing were eliminated and did not occur.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffron, Patrice.

== Public perception and usage ==
In 2004, an estimated 70 million people participated in online file sharing.&lt;ref&gt;Delgado, Ray. [http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2004/march17/fileshare-317.html Law professors examine ethical controversies of peer-to-peer file sharing]. ''Stanford Report'', March 17, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a [[CBS News]] poll, nearly 70 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds thought file sharing was acceptable in some circumstances and 58 percent of all [[United States|Americans]] who followed the file sharing issue considered it acceptable in at least some circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/09/18/opinion/polls/main573990.shtml Poll: Young Say File Sharing OK] ''CBS News'', Bootie Cosgrove-Mather, 2003-09-18&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2006, 32 million Americans over the age of 12 had downloaded at least one feature-length movie from the Internet, 80 percent of whom had done so exclusively over P2P. Of the population sampled, 60 percent felt that downloading copyrighted movies off the Internet did not constitute a very serious offense, however 78 percent believed taking a DVD from a store without paying for it constituted a very serious offense.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srgnet.com/pdf/Movie%20File-Sharing%20Booming%20Release%20Jan%2024%2007%20Final.pdf Solutions Research Group - Movie File-Sharing Booming: Study] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217011553/http://www.srgnet.com/pdf/Movie%20File-Sharing%20Booming%20Release%20Jan%2024%2007%20Final.pdf |date=2012-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2008, 20 percent of Europeans used file sharing networks to obtain music, while 10 percent used paid-for digital music services such as [[iTunes Store|iTunes]].&lt;ref&gt;17:41 GMT, Thursday, 3 July 2008 18:41 UK. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7486743.stm Technology: "Warning letters to 'file-sharers'"], ''BBC NEWS''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, a [[Tiscali]] UK survey found that 75 percent of the English public polled were aware of what was legal and illegal in relation to file sharing, but there was a divide as to where they felt the legal burden should be placed: 49 percent of people believed P2P companies should be held responsible for illegal file sharing on their networks, 18 percent viewed individual file sharers as the culprits, while 18 percent either didn't know or chose not to answer.&lt;ref&gt;MarkJ - 24 February 2009 (1:46 PM).  [http://www.ispreview.co.uk/news/EkFVulFEAVbPsdkYcg.html "Tiscali UK Survey Reveals Illegal File Sharing Attitudes"], ''ISPreview UK News''.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an earlier poll, 75 percent of young voters in [[Sweden]] (18-20) supported file sharing when presented with the statement: "I think it is OK to download files from the Net, even if it is illegal." Of the respondents, 38 percent said they "adamantly agreed" while 39 percent said they "partly agreed".&lt;ref&gt;TT/Adam Ewing. 8 Jun 06 09:54 CET. [http://www.thelocal.se/article.php?ID=4014&amp;date=20060608 "Young voters back file sharing"], ''The Local''.&lt;/ref&gt; An academic study among American and European college students found that users of file-sharing technologies were relatively anti-copyright and that copyright enforcement created backlash, hardening pro-file sharing beliefs among users of these technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Depoorter et al.

== Communities in P2P file sharing networks==
Communities have a prominent role in many peer to peer networks and applications, such as BitTorrent, Gnutella and [[DC++]]. There are different elements that contribute to the formation, development and the stability of these communities, which include interests, user attributes, cost reduction, user motivation and the dimension of the community.

=== Interest attributes ===
Peer communities are formed on the basis of common interests. For Khambatti, Ryu and Dasgupta common interests can be labelled as attributes "which are used to determine the peer communities in which a particular peer can participate".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-540-24629-9_5|title = Structuring Peer-to-Peer Networks Using Interest-Based Communities|last = Khambatti|first = Mujtaba|date = 7 September 2003|journal = Lecture Notes in Computer Science|volume = 2944|pages = 48|doi = 10.1007/978-3-540-24629-9_5|last2 = Ryu|first2 = Kyung Dong|last3 = Partha|first3 = Dasgupta|isbn = 978-3-540-20968-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two ways in which these attributes can be classified: explicit and implicit attributes.

Implicit values means that peers provide information about themselves to a specific community, for example they may express their interest in a subject or their taste in music. With explicit values, users do not directly express information about themselves, albeit, it is still possible to find information about that specific user by uncovering his or her past queries and research carried out in a P2P network. 
Khambatti, Ryu and Dasgupta  divide these interests further into three classes: personal, claimed and group attributes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A full set of attributes (common interests) of a specific peer is defined as personal attributes, and is a collection of information a peer has about him or herself. Peers may decide not to disclose information about themselves to maintain their privacy and online security. It is for this reason that the authors specify that "a subset of...attributes is explicitly claimed public by a peer", and they define such attributes as "claimed attributes".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The third category of interests is group attributes, defined as "location or affiliation oriented" and are needed to form a...basis for communities", an example being the "domain name of an internet connection" which acts as an online location and group identifier for certain users.

=== Cost reduction ===
Cost reduction influences the sharing component of P2P communities. Users who share do so to attempt "to reduce...costs" as made clear by Cunningham, Alexander and Adilov.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://opus.ipfw.edu/econ_facpubs/23/|title = Peer-to-peer file sharing communities|last = Cunningham|first = Brendan|date = 28 October 2003|journal = Information Economics and Policy|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 16 December 2015|last2 = Alexander|first2 = Peter|last3 = Adilov|first3 = Nodir}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their work Peer-to-peer file sharing communities, they explain that "the act of sharing is costly since any download from a sharer implies that the sharer is sacrificing bandwidth".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As sharing represents the basis of P2P communities, such as Napster, and without it "the network collapses", users share despite its costs in order to attempt to lower their own costs, particularly those associated with searching, and with the congestion of internet servers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== User motivation and size of community ===
User motivation and the size of the P2P community contribute to its sustainability and activity. In her work Motivating Participation in Peer to Peer Communities, Vassileva studies these two aspects through an experiment carried out in the University of Saskatchewan (Canada), where a P2P application (COMUTELLA) was created and distributed among students. In her view, motivation is "a crucial factor" in encouraging users to participate in an online P2P community, particularly because the "lack of a critical mass of active users" in the form of a community will not allow for a P2P sharing to function properly.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-39173-8_11|title = Motivating Participation in Peer to Peer Communities|last = Vassileva|first = Julita|date = January 2002|journal = Engineering Societies in the Agents World III|volume = 2577|pages = 141|doi = 10.1007/3-540-39173-8_11|series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science|isbn = 978-3-540-14009-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usefulness is a valued aspect by users when joining a P2P community. The specific P2P system must be perceived as "useful" by the user and must be able to fulfil his or her needs and pursue his or her interests. Consequently, the "size of the community of users defines the level of usefulness" and "the value of the system determines the number of users".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This two way process is defined by Vassileva as a feedback loop, and has allowed for the birth of file-sharing systems like Napster and KaZaA. However, in her research Vassileva has also found that "incentives are needed for the users in the beginning", particularly for motivating and getting users into the habit of staying online.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This can be done, for example, by providing the system with a wide amount of resources or by having an experienced user provide assistance to a less experienced one.

=== User classification ===
Users participating in P2P systems can be classified in different ways. According to Vassileva, users can be classified depending on their participation in the P2P system. There are five types of users to be found: users who create services, users who allow services, users who facilitate search, users who allow communication, users who are uncooperative and free ride.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In the first instance, the user creates new resources or services and offers them to the community. In the second, the user provides the community with disk space "to store files for downloads" or with "computing resources" to facilitate a service provided by another users.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In the third, the user provides a list of relationships to help other users find specific files or services. In the fourth, the user participates actively in the "protocol of the network", contributing to keeping the network together. In the last situation, the user does not contribute to the network, downloads what he or she needs but goes immediately offline once the service is not needed anymore, thus free-riding on the network and community resources.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Tracking ==
Corporations continue to combat the use of the internet as a tool to illegally copy and share various files, especially that of copyrighted music. The [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) has been active in leading campaigns against infringers. Lawsuits have been launched against individuals as well as programs such as [[Napster]] in order to "protect" copyright owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page|url = http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=f9f5f492-42ef-4892-80d3-e21faab3803c%2540sessionmgr4002&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=4111|website = eds.a.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most recent efforts of the RIAA has been to implant decoy users to monitor the use of copyrighted material from a firsthand perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The P2P war: Someone is monitoring your activities|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128608000091|journal = Computer Networks|date = 2008-04-24|pages = 1272–1280|volume = 52|issue = 6|doi = 10.1016/j.comnet.2008.01.011|first = Anirban|last = Banerjee|first2 = Michalis|last2 = Faloutsos|first3 = Laxmi|last3 = Bhuyan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early June 2002, Researcher Nathaniel Good at [[HP Labs]] demonstrated that user interface design issues could contribute to users inadvertently sharing personal and confidential information over P2P networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Good|first=Nathaniel|author2=Aaron Krekelberg|title=Usability and privacy: a study of Kazaa P2P file- sharing|journal=HP Labs Tech Report|date=5 June 2002|url=http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/2002/HPL-2002-163.html|accessdate=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Good|first=Nathaniel|author2=Aaron Krekelberg|title=Usability and privacy: a study of Kazaa P2P file- sharing|journal=Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|year=2003|pages=137–144|doi=10.1145/642611.642636 |url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=642611.642636|isbn=1581136307}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Markoff|first=John|title=Security Hole Found in KaZaA File-Sharing Service|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/07/technology/07PRIV.html|accessdate=15 October 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=June 7, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Congressional hearings before the House Committee of Government Reform (''Overexposed: The Threats to Privacy &amp; Security on File Sharing Networks'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-108hhrg88016/pdf/CHRG-108hhrg88016.pdf|work=Overexposed: The Threats to Privacy &amp; Security on File Sharing Networks|title=Overexposed: The Threats to Privacy &amp; Security on File Sharing Networks}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Senate Judiciary Committee (''The Dark Side of a Bright Idea: Could Personal and National Security Risks Compromise the Potential of P2P File-Sharing Networks?'') &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/hearing.cfm?id=4f1e0899533f7680e78d03281fed5fb5|work="The Dark Side of a Bright Idea: Could Personal and National Security Risks Compromise the Potential of P2P File-Sharing Networks?"|title=The Dark Side of a Bright Idea: Could Personal and National Security Risks Compromise the Potential of P2P File-Sharing Networks?}}&lt;/ref&gt; were convened to address and discuss the issue of inadvertent sharing on peer-to-peer networks and its consequences to consumer and national security.

Researchers have examined potential security risks including the release of personal information, bundled [[spyware]], and [[Computer virus|viruses]] downloaded from the network.&lt;ref&gt;By M. Eric Johnson, Dan McGuire, Nicholas D. Willey [http://csdl2.computer.org/comp/proceedings/hicss/2008/3075/00/30750383.pdf The Evolution of the Peer-to-Peer File Sharing Industry and the Security Risks for Users]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Where Only Fools Dare to Tread: An Empirical Study on the Prevalence of Zero-day Malware|author=Håvard Vegge, Finn Michael Halvorsen and Rune Walsø Nergård|publisher=2009 Fourth International Conference on Internet Monitoring and Protection|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some proprietary file sharing clients have been known to bundle [[malware]], though [[Open-source software|open source]] programs typically have not. Some open source file sharing packages have even provided integrated anti-virus scanning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turnkeylinux.org/torrentserver Open source file sharing software with integrated anti-virus scanning]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since approximately 2004 the threat of [[identity theft]] had become more prevalent, and in July 2008 there was another inadvertent revealing of vast amounts of personal information through P2P sites. The "names, dates of birth, and [[Social Security number]]s of about 2,000 of (an investment) firm's clients" were exposed, "including [those of] [[Stephen Breyer|Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer]]."&lt;ref name="CNET"/&gt; A drastic increase in inadvertent P2P file sharing of personal and sensitive information became evident in 2009 at the beginning of [[Barack Obama|President Obama]]'s administration when the blueprints to the helicopter [[Marine One]] were made available to the public through a breach in security via a P2P file sharing site. Access to this information has the potential of being detrimental to US security.&lt;ref name="CNET"&gt;Greg Sandoval. April 21, 2009 10:41 AM PDT. [http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-10224080-93.html "Congress to probe P2P sites over 'inadvertent sharing'"], ''CNET News''&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, shortly before this security breach, the ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' show had reported that more than 150,000 tax returns, 25,800 student loan applications and 626,000 credit reports had been inadvertently made available through file sharing.&lt;ref name="CNET"/&gt;

The United States government then attempted to make users more aware of the potential risks involved with P2P file sharing programs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=P2P File-Sharing Risks|publisher=OnGuardOnLine.gov|url=http://www.onguardonline.gov/p2p}}&lt;/ref&gt; through legislation such as H.R. 1319, the Informed P2P User Act, in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Hearing on Barrow P2P Legislation Held on Tuesday|publisher =Congressman John Barrow|date=May 2009|url=http://www.barrow.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=346&amp;Itemid=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this act, it would be mandatory for individuals to be aware of the risks associated with peer-to-peer file sharing before purchasing software with informed consent of the user required prior to use of such programs. In addition, the act would allow users to block and remove P2P file sharing software from their computers at any time,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h111-1319 "Text of H.R. 1319: Informed P2P User Act"], ''GovTrack.us''&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[Federal Trade Commission]] enforcing regulations. [[United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team|US-CERT]] also warns of the potential risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Risks of File-Sharing Technology|publisher=[[US-CERT]]|url=http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/tips/ST05-007.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, in 2010, researchers discovered thousands of documents containing sensitive patient information on popular peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, including insurance details, personally identifying information, physician names and diagnosis codes on more than 28,000 individuals. Many of the documents contained sensitive patient communications, treatment data, medical diagnoses and psychiatric evaluations.&lt;ref&gt;Jaikumar Vijayan.

==Copyright issues==
{{Main article|Legal aspects of file sharing}}
The act of file sharing is not illegal per se and peer-to-peer networks are also used for legitimate purposes. The legal issues in file sharing involve violating the laws of [[copyrighted]] material. Most discussions about the legality of file sharing are implied to be about solely copyright material. Many countries have [[fair use]] exceptions that permit limited use of copyrighted material without acquiring permission from the rights holders. Such documents include commentary, news reporting, research and scholarship. Copyright laws are territorial- they do not extend beyond the territory of a specific state unless that state is a party to an international agreement. Most countries today are parties to at least one such agreement.

In the area of privacy, recent court rulings seem to indicate that there can be no [[expectation of privacy]] in data exposed over peer-to-peer file-sharing networks.  In a 39-page ruling released November 8, 2013, US District Court Judge [[Christina Reiss]] denied the motion to suppress evidence gathered by authorities without a search warrant through an automated peer-to-peer search tool.&lt;ref&gt;ComputerWorld.[http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9243970/Don_t_expect_data_on_P2P_networks_to_be_private_judge_rules] " Don't expect data on P2P networks to be private, judge rules".&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Precita Eyes Muralists Association''' is a community-based [[non-profit]] [[muralist]] and [[Visual arts education|arts education]] group located in [[Mission District, San Francisco, California|the Mission District]] of [[San Francisco, California]], founded in 1977 by [[Susan Cervantes|Susan]] and Luis Cervantes.&lt;ref name="eyes"&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/10/17/DDB9SQCP0.DTL Precita Eyes celebrates two decades of making walls, and community, bloom], by Will Cain, ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', October 17, 2007, access date July 18, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Precita Eyes Muralists Association was founded in 1977 by Susan and Luis Cervantes who had come to the Bay Area several years before and started a family. Susan Cervantes herself had been inspired by “[[Mujeres Muralistas|Las Mujeres Muralistas]],” the first all-women group of collaborative muralists from which she applies her strategy of collaborative, accessible, community art.&lt;ref name="eyes"/&gt;

[[File:Balmy Alley Mission SF2.jpg|thumb|right|A Precita Eyes' mural on a garage door and fence in Balmy Alley]]
[[File:Dia del Orgullo Indigena.jpg|thumb|right|Also in Balmy Alley, by Precita Eyes Muralists, 1998]]
[[File:El Hijo del Sol.jpg|thumb|right|By Precita Eyes Muralists Youth Mural Workshop, 2003]]

The organization evolved from a community mural workshop in which the participants designed and painted the portable mural “Masks of God, Soul of Man” for the Bernal Heights Library.&lt;ref name="goldengate-iconic"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://goldengatexpress.org/2013/03/14/mission-murals/|title = Muralist Community Provides Tours of Iconic SF Art|last = González|first = Guadalupe|date = March 14, 2013|work = Golden Gate Xpress|access-date = March 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group signed the piece as Precita Eyes Muralists because the project was a collaborative effort. The name of the organization comes from the fact that most of the muralists were from Precita Valley. Precita is a diminutive form of the Spanish word ‘presa,’ which means dam; the word ‘Precita’ means little dam. The ‘Eyes’ in the name are what we perceive the visual world with, our own eyes.

After the first mural, the group of artists continued to be interested in creating murals. They completed two major mural commissions and several more portable murals. Two years later, the group applied for non-profit status in 1979. In 1998 Precita Eyes expanded its operations with the purchase of the building at 2981 24th Street, near the well-known [[Balmy Alley]].&lt;ref name="history"&gt;Precita Eyes Muralists, Precita Eyes Organizational History, Press kit. Retrieved on March 03, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2007, Precita Eyes had supported nearly 100 murals in the Mission neighborhood,&lt;ref name="nytimes-gallery"&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/28/arts/artsspecial/28mural.html?_r=0|title = A Neighborhood Is a Gallery, Its Brick Walls Canvases|last = Villano|first = Matt|date = March 28, 2007|work = New York Times|access-date = March 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; including on [[The Women's Building]] and Cesar Chavez Elementary School.&lt;ref name="indybay-beauty"/&gt;

Other recent local projects involved the restoration of two San Francisco Parks, Excelsior Playground and Crocker-Amazon Playground. They also host an annual Urban Youth Arts Festival, with artists painting on boards in Precita Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Fitzgerald Rodriguez |first= Joe |date= July 22, 2014 |title= Graffiti artists tagging in the sunshine at Precita Park |url= http://www.sfbg.com/pixel_vision/2014/07/22/photo-gallery-graffiti-artists-tagging-sunshine-precita-park |newspaper= San Francisco Bay Guardian |location= |access-date= March 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murals are an expression of the culture of the neighborhood; in an article about Precita Eyes, muralist Juana Alicia Montoya said "In the 1960s and '70s, the Mission District became the cultural heart of the Chicano movement in California...And the murals were an integral part of that movement, as was theater and poetry."&lt;ref name="sfgate-art"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/MISSION-Celebrating-art-that-draws-people-2349295.php |title = Celebrating art that draws people together|last = Tyche Hendricks|first = Tyche|date = May 6, 2005|work = SFGate |access-date = March 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book ''Chicana and Chicano Art: ProtestArte'' says "Arts organizations such as Precita Eyes continue to support Chicano muralism's original objective: to create public art that authentically represents a community's history and culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Jackson |first= Carlos Francisco |date= 2009 |title= Chicana and Chicano Art: ProtestArte |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=2XfaMxFIyo0C&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;ots=HIpiB-iP4g&amp;dq=precita%20eyes%20art%20classes%20youth&amp;pg=PA81#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location= |publisher= University of Arizona Press |page= 81 |isbn= 9780816526475 |access-date= March 7, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==

Precita Eyes Muralists is one of only a handful of mural arts organizations in the United States.&lt;ref name="sfweekly-tourism"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.sfweekly.com/exhibitionist/2014/06/13/tourism-for-locals-precita-eyes-paints-the-city-pretty|title = Tourism For Locals: Precita Eyes Paints the City Pretty|last = De Anda|first = Juan|date = June 13, 2014|work = SF Weekly|access-date = March 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It maintains two centers. The original Mural Arts Center at 348 Precita Avenue is used primarily by the education program for toddler, kids and youth classes. The Precita Eyes Mural Arts and Visitors Center, at 2981 24th Street, conducts mural tours; has a small art supply and mural merchandise store; is used as a gallery space and a space for workshops for adults to plan and design mural art; has space to work on mosaics and portable murals; and contains Precita Eyes Muralists’ Offices.

Precita Eyes Muralists offers weekly art classes for toddlers, children and youth 18 months to 19 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.artandarchitecture-sf.com/precita-eyes-covers-mcdonalds-in-paint.html |title= Precita Eyes covers McDonald's in Paint |last1= Casey |first1= Cindy |last2= |first2= |date= March 25, 2013 |website= Art and Architecture - San Francisco |publisher= |access-date= March 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These programs enable students to find and develop their confidence and individuality through arts and crafts, and experience positive social interaction through collaboration in a safe environment. It also offers regular workshops for adults such as the Community Mural Arts Education Workshop. Overall the educational programs serve approximately 3,000 children, youth and adults yearly, most of whom qualify as moderate to low income. People served by the program include young people caught for doing graffiti and required to do community service hours.&lt;ref name="indybay-beauty"&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2006/08/24/18300401.php|title = Beauty on the Bricks: Precita Eyes Creates Murals and Artists|last = O'Donoghue|first = Liam|date = August 24, 2006|work = Fault Lines|access-date = March 7, 2015|publisher = San Francisco Bay Area Independent Media Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Precita Eyes offers walking tours that cover mural history and the cultural and historical significance of the murals in Balmy Alley and the wider Mission district.&lt;ref name="cbs-artwalks"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/top-lists/best-art-walks-in-the-bay-area/|title = Best Art Walks In The Bay Area|last = Miller Farr|first = Laurie Jo|date = January 26, 2015|work = CBS SF Bay Area|access-date = March 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tours are open to the public during the weekends. Private tours for large groups such as school classes or visiting groups can be scheduled during the weekday and are tailored to the audience.

'''Proof of insurance''' ('''POI''') is any type of documentation that a person can provide to another individual proving that the person has valid [[insurance]] with an [[insurance company]].

The most common form of a POI is a paper card provided by the insurance company listing policy information and effective dates.

Where [[vehicle insurance]] is compulsory, many states require that a person carry proof of insurance in their automobiles or on their person while driving.  If a person is questioned by a law enforcement official, they must provide proof of insurance.  A citation is generally issued if the person cannot provide such documentation.

'''''Proserpine''''' (also '''''Proserpina''''') is an [[oil painting]] on canvas by English artist and poet [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], painted in 1874 and currently housed at [[Tate Britain]].

==History==
[[File:Dante Gabriel Rossetti Proserpina (chalks).jpg|thumb|right|A version in colored chalks, dated 1880.]]
In his ''Proserpine'', the artist illustrates in his typical [[Pre-Raphaelite]] style the Roman goddess who lives in the underworld during Winter. Although Rossetti inscribed the date 1874 on the picture, he worked for seven years on eight separate canvases before he finished with it. His Proserpine, like his model [[Jane Morris]], is an exquisitely beautiful woman, with delicate facial features, slender hands, and flawlessly pale skin set off by her thick raven hair. Rossetti painted it at a time when his mental health was extremely precarious and his love for Jane Morris was at its most obsessive.&lt;ref&gt;V. Surtees, ''Dante Gabriel Rossetti 1828–1882. The Paintings and Drawings'', Clarendon Press (1971), I, pp. 131–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rossetti wrote about ''Proserpine''&lt;blockquote&gt;
She is represented in a gloomy corridor of her palace, with the fatal fruit in her hand. As she passes, a gleam strikes on the wall behind her from some inlet suddenly opened, and admitting for a moment the sight of the [[Upper World (Greek)|upper world]]; and she glances furtively towards it, immersed in thought. The incense-burner stands beside her as the attribute of a goddess. The ivy branch in the background may be taken as a symbol of clinging memory.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. W.E. Fredeman (ed.), ''The correspondence of Dante Gabriel Rossetti'', 7 Vols., Brewer (2002–8).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Unable to decide as a young man whether to concentrate on painting or poetry, his work is infused with his poetic imagination and an individual interpretation of literary sources. His accompanying sonnet to this work is a poem of longing: "And still some heart unto some soul doth pine," (see '''[[#The inscribed sonnet|sonnet]]''' below) carrying an inescapable allusion to his yearning to seduce Jane from her unhappy marriage with [[William Morris]]. Proserpine had been imprisoned in Pluto's underground realm for tasting the forbidden pomegranate. Jane, trapped by convention, was also tasting forbidden fruit.&lt;ref&gt;See critique at ''[http://www.victorianweb.org/painting/dgr/drawings/marecki4.html The Victorian Web]'', also [http://www.victorianweb.org/painting/dgr/drawings/ringel4.html here].&lt;/ref&gt;
There is a deeper meaning in the painting as Rossetti stayed with Jane at Kelmscott Manor during the summer months each year and in winter she returned to stay with William Morris, thus paralleling Proserpine's freedom during summer.

In [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]], [[Proserpina|Proserpine]] daughter of [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]], was carried off to the [[Underworld]] ([[Hades]]) by [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]], who married her despite her love for [[Adonis]]. When Ceres begged [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] to return her daughter to Earth, he agreed, on condition that Proserpine had not eaten any fruits in Hades. As Proserpine had eaten six pomegranate seeds, it was decreed that she should remain in Hades for six months of the year and be allowed on Earth for the other six.&lt;ref name="Tate gal"&gt;{{cite web

  | publisher =  | year =1998 | url =http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&amp;workid=12804&amp;searchid=9744&amp;roomid=false&amp;tabview=text&amp;texttype=10 | format =  | accessdate =14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The symbolism in Rossetti's painting poignantly indicates Proserpine's plight, as well as Jane Morris's plight, torn between her husband, the father of her two adored daughters, and her lover. The pomegranate draws the viewer's eye, the colour of its flesh matching the colour of Proserpine's full lips. The ivy behind her, as Rossetti stated, represents clinging memory and the passing of time; the shadow on the wall is her time in [[Hades]], the patch of sunlight, her glimpse of earth. Her dress, like spilling water, suggests the turning of the tides, and the incense burner denotes the subject as an immortal. Proserpine's saddened eyes, which are the same cold blue color as most of the painting, indirectly stare at the ''other'' realm. Overall, dark hues characterise the color scheme of the piece.&lt;ref&gt;L. Parris (ed.), ''The Pre-Raphaelites'', exhibition catalogue, Tate Gallery (1984), pp. 231–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The inscribed sonnet==
[[Image:8th Rossetti Proserpine.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.0|Rossetti's eighth and final version of ''Proserpine'', now in the [[Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery]] (1882)]]
On the top right of the canvas "Proserpina" is inscribed by the artist, followed by his sonnet in Italian. The same sonnet in English is inscribed on the frame:&lt;ref name="Tate gal"/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Afar away the light that brings cold cheer
:Unto this wall, – one instant and no more
:Admitted at my distant palace-door
:Afar the flowers of Enna from this drear
:Dire fruit, which, tasted once, must thrall me here.
:Afar those skies from this Tartarean grey
:That chills me: and afar how far away,
:The nights that shall become the days that were.

:Afar from mine own self I seem, and wing
:Strange ways in thought, and listen for a sign:
:And still some heart unto some soul doth pine,
:(Whose sounds mine inner sense in fain to bring,
:Continually together murmuring) —
:'Woe me for thee, unhappy Proserpine'.
:— D. G. Rossetti &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The painting is signed and dated on a scroll at lower left: 'DANTE GABRIELE ROSSETTI RITRASSE NEL CAPODANNO DEL 1874' {{it}} (''Dante Gabriel Rossetti painted this at the beginning of 1874''). The frame, designed by Rossetti, has roundels which resemble a section of a pomegranate, reflecting the sliced pomegranate in Proserpine's hand.

Rossetti began work on the painting in 1871 and painted at least eight separate versions, the last only completed in 1882, the year of his death. Early versions were promised to [[Charles Augustus Howell]]. The painting discussed in this article is the so-called seventh version commissioned by [[Frederick Richards Leyland]], now at the Tate Gallery, with the very similar final version now at the [[Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery]].&lt;ref name="Rarchive"&gt;{{cite web

Leyland commissioned eighteen paintings from Rossetti, not counting unfulfilled commissions. Soon after Leyland acquired his first Rossetti painting, he and Rossetti explored the idea of a Rossetti [[triptych]], which was eventually formed with ''[[Mnemosyne (Rossetti)|Mnemosyne]]'', ''[[The Blessed Damozel]]'', and ''Proserpine''.&lt;ref&gt;''Waking Dreams'', p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; Three additional Rossetti paintings were then hung in Leyland's drawing room, all of which Leyland called "stunners."&lt;ref name=figure&gt;''Waking Dreams'', p. 26. (figure 5).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pseudo-athlete''' is a concept in Roman portraiture, favored in the late Republican Period, to describe a sculpture that has a combination of a veristic head and an idealized body. [[Verism]] shows the person portrayed without idealizing features, with warts, wrinkles, and other physical defects and deformities. Verism goes beyond a realistic rendering. There was a positive value of age and experience in Rome, so it manipulates the facial expression in an attempt to convey the stern traditional Roman values. One of the potential origins of the veristic style is from Roman funeral masks. The masks were used to give an impersonation of the deceased at the [[Roman Forum]]. Therefore, it was critical that the masks reproduced the appearance of the deceased and portrayed all of their features. The public funerals were to portray the character of the deceased, so artists were encouraged to make the masks as expressive as possible using the traditionally prized Roman values: stern moral seriousness (''[[gravitas]]''), firmness and strictness of judgement (''severitas''), determination and self-possession (''constantia''), and so on.&lt;ref&gt;Hallett, C. (2005). The Roman Nude: Heroic Portrait Statuary 200 B.C.-A.D. 300. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; While the origin of [[verism]] is highly debated as to whether it was from Italic, Etruscan, Roman, Egyptian, or Greek influence, the purpose for realistic, unidealized rendering was specific. The signs of age were used as indicators of wisdom and authority.&lt;ref&gt;Gisela M. A. Richter. (1955). [http://doi.org/10.2307/298742 The Origin of Verism in Roman Portraits]. The Journal of Roman Studies, 45, 39–46.&lt;/ref&gt; The body remains idealized due to Greek influence.  In Greek sculpture there is a concept of [[heroic nudity]]. It is used to indicate that a sculpture's apparently mortal human subject is in fact a hero or semi-divine being.&lt;ref name="FK_2010"&gt;Kleiner, F. (2010). Portraiture. In A History of Roman Art (Enhanced ed., pp. 54-56). Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Roman examples ==

=== Pseudo-Athlete of Delos ===
[[File:1477 - Archaeological Museum, Athens - Pseudo-Athlete of Delos, 80 AD ca. - Photo by Giovanni Dall'Orto,.jpg|thumb|1477 - Archaeological Museum, Athens - Pseudo-Athlete of Delos, 80 AD ca. - Photo by Giovanni Dall'Orto,]]
The Pseudo-athlete of Delos is a life-size nude male portrait that was found in the House of the Diadoumenos on the Greek island of Delos. It belonged to a Roman business man and dates back to 100 BCE. Stylistic traits of Greek sculpture, such as the [[contrapposto]] of the Polykleitan original and the sharp upturn of the head reminiscent of [[Hellenistic sculpture]], were incorporated. In contrast, the bald head, prominent ears, and wrinkled face is reminiscent of the Republican style, as is the combination of the veristic head with the idealized body.  The idealized nude body is symbolic of the concept of [[heroic nudity]] in Greek sculpture.  The realistic head is symbolic of wisdom and experience that comes with age. In Greek portraiture, the head and body show a consistent age. However, in the Roman pseudo-athlete there is a disconnect.&lt;ref name="FK_2010"/&gt; The draped cloth carefully placed across the left shoulder is reminiscent of the Roman toga, while the nude body is typical in Greek statues.&lt;ref&gt;Squire, M. (2011). The Art of the Body: Antiquity and its Legacy. London: I.B. Tauris.&lt;/ref&gt; The body is used as a prop for the head. In the Delos pseudo-athlete, nudity is used as a costume or garment since the business man would not have appeared nude in public or in front of his guests.&lt;ref name="FK_2010"/&gt; The combination of the Greek style body with a Roman head makes the sculpture from Delos a great example of the Roman pseudo-athlete.

=== Tivoli General ===
[[File:General de Tivoli (Massimo) 01.JPG|thumb|General de Tivoli (Massimo) 01]]
In Tivoli, at the Sanctuary of Hercules, a pseudo-athlete portrait of a general was found.  The marble sculpture with a veristic Roman head and idealized Greek body dates back to 75-50 BCE. To show his rank in the army and hold up the heavy marble statue, there is a [[cuirass]] at his side. His typical Republican stern and wrinkled face is contrasted by a youthful almost nude body that exudes power and is in the tradition of a Hellenistic ruler. Through the reference back to Greek idealized body, the patron expresses cultural superiority. The general exudes modesty by using a draped cloth to cover his genitals.&lt;ref name="FK_2010"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33799">'''Mythology''' is the [[myth and ritual|main component]] of '''Religion'''. It refers to systems of concepts that are of high importance to a certain community, making statements concerning the [[supernatural]] or [[sacred]]. Religion is the broader term, besides mythological system, it includes [[ritual]]. A given [[mythology]] is almost always associated with a certain religion such as [[Greek mythology]] with [[Ancient Greek religion]]. Disconnected from its religious system, a myth may lose its immediate relevance to the community and evolve—away from sacred importance—into a [[legend]] or [[Folklore|folktale]]. 

There is a complex relationship between [[myth and ritual|recital of myths and enactment of rituals]].

==Introduction==
{{See also|Myth and ritual}}
The relationship between religion and myth depends on what definition of "myth" one uses. By [[Robert Graves]]'s definition, a religion's [[Traditional story|traditional stories]] are "myths" if and only if one does not belong to the religion in question. By Segal's definition, all religious stories are myths—but simply because nearly all [[Narrative|stories]] are myths. By the [[Folklore studies|folklorists]]' definition, all myths are religious (or "sacred") stories, but not all religious stories are myths: religious stories that involve the [[Creation myth|creation of the world]] (e.g., the stories in the [[Book of Genesis]]) are myths; however, some religious stories that don't explain how things came to be in their present form (e.g., [[Hagiography|hagiographies]] of famous [[saint]]s) are not myths. Generally, mythology is the main component of religion alongside ritual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=KERYGMA AND MYTH by Rudolf Bultmann and Five Critics edited by Hans Werner Bartsch |last=Bultmann |first=Rudolf |year=2005 |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |url=https://www.religion-online.org/book-chapter/the-mythological-element-in-the-message-of-the-new-testament-and-the-problem-of-its-re-interpretation-part-i/ |page=21}}: "The cosmology of the New Testament is essentially mythical in character."&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|1={{harvnb|Rue|2005|pp=315}}: religious traditions are, essentially, mythic traditions}}{{refn|1={{harvnb|Rue|2005|pp=144-145}}: "At the core of every religious tradition there is found a narrative vision, a myth unifying ultimate reality and value, a story that is expressed, transmitted, and revitalized by a variety of ancillary strategies."}}{{refn|1={{harvnb|Leeming|2005|loc=Introduction, xi}}: "Religious stories are “holy scripture” to believers — narratives used to support, explain, or justify a particular system’s rituals, theology, and ethics — and are myths to people of other cultures or belief systems."}}{{refn|1={{harvnb|Gieysztor|1982|p=5}}: "Przez mitologię, stanowiącą część główną religii, rozumiemy system personifikacji, alegorii i symboliki, które wyrażały stosunek człowieka do świata. "}} For example, in the [[Early modern Europe|early modern period]], distinguished Christian theologians developed elaborated witch mythologies which contributed to the intensification of [[Witch trials in the early modern period|witch trials]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Levack |first1=Brian P. |title=The Oxford Handbook of Witchcraft in Early Modern Europe and Colonial America |date=2013 |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=48-49 |isbn=0-19-515669-2 |url=https://books.google.pl/books?id=Lum96_FPZp0C&amp;pg=PA48}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Oxford Companion to World Mythology'' provides the following summary and examples:{{sfn|Leeming|2005|loc=Introduction}}{{sfn|Leeming|2005|loc=Religion and Myth}}&lt;blockquote&gt;Religious stories are “holy scripture” to believers—narratives used to support, explain, or justify a particular system’s rituals, theology, and ethics—and are myths to people of other cultures or belief systems. […] It&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;difficult to believe that the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] was [[Maya (mother of the Buddha)|conceived in a dream by a white elephant]], so we call that story a myth as well. But, of course, stories such as the [[Crossing the Red Sea|parting of the Sea of Reeds]] for the fleeing [[Israelites|Hebrews]], [[Muhammad]]’s [[Isra and Mi'raj|Night Journey]], and the dead [[Resurrection of Jesus|Jesus rising from the tomb]] are just as clearly [[Irrationality|irrational]] narratives to which a [[Hindu]] or a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] might understandably apply the word “myth.” All of these stories are definable as myths because they contain events that contradict both our intellectual and physical experience of [[reality]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Most definitions of "myth" limit myths to stories.&lt;ref&gt;Segal 2004, p. 5. See Buxton, p. 18: "There are three elements in [my] definition [of mythology]. '''The least problematic''' is the notion of ''story'': a 'myth' is a narrative, a set of events structured into a sequence". (Bolding added)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, non-narrative elements of religion, such as ritual, are not myths.
===Theology and myth===
The term [[theology]] for the first time appears in the writings of the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] philosophers [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]. Initially, theology and mythology were synonymous. With time, both terms gained distinctive qualities:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Britannica |title=Theology |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/theology |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180818084404/https://www.britannica.com/topic/theology |archive-date=2018-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first place, theology is a spiritual or religious attempt of “believers” to explicate their faith. In this sense it is not neutral and is not attempted from the perspective of removed observation—in contrast to a general history of religions. The implication derived from the religious approach is that it does not provide a formal and indifferent scheme devoid of presuppositions within which all religions could be subsumed. In the second place, theology is influenced by its origins in the Greek and Christian traditions, with the implication that the transmutation of this concept to other religions is endangered by the very circumstances of origination.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to Hege, both primitive and modern theology is inescapably constrained by its mythical backbone:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hege |first=Brent A. R.|title=Myth, History, and the Resurrection in German Protestant Theology |year=2017 |p=132 |url=https://books.google.pl/books?id=SSA6DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA132}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Hermeneutics|Hermeneutically]], theologians must recognize that mythical thought permeates the [[Bible|biblical texts]]. [[Dogma|Dogmatically]], theologians must be aware of the mythological elements of theology and of how extensively theology relies on mythical forms and functions, especially in light of our awareness of the ubiquity of myth.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Religion===
''[[Religion]]'' is a belief concerning the supernatural, sacred, or [[Divinity|divine]], and the [[moral code]]s, practices, values, and institutions associated with such belief, although some scholars, such as Durkheim, would argue that the supernatural and the divine are not aspects of all religions.&lt;ref&gt;"Religion", ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Religious beliefs and practices may include the following: a [[deity]] or higher being, [[eschatology]], practices of [[worship]], practices of [[ethics]] and [[politics]]. Some religions do not include all these features. For instance, belief in a deity is not essential to [[Buddhism]].

===Mythology===
The term ''[[mythology]]'' usually refers either to a system of myths or to the study of myths.&lt;ref&gt;"Mythology", ''OED'', 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the word "myth" itself has multiple (and some contradictory) definitions:
* 2007: According to the [[Merriam-Webster]] Dictionary, "Myth: "1 a: a usually traditional story of ostensibly historical events that serves to unfold part of the [[world view]] of a people or explain a practice, belief, or natural phenomenon. b: [[Parable]], [[Allegory]]. 2 a: a popular belief or tradition that has grown up around something or someone; especially: one embodying the ideals and institutions of a society or segment of [[society]]. 2b: an unfounded or false notion. 3: a person or thing having only an imaginary or unverifiable existence. 4: the whole body of myths.&lt;ref&gt;"Myth", Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In regards to the study of culture and religion, these are some of the definitions scholars have used:

* 1968: The [[classicist]] [[Robert Graves]] defines myths as "whatever religious or heroic legends are so foreign to a student's experience that he cannot believe them to be true."&lt;ref&gt;Graves 1968, p. v.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1973: Another classicist, GS Kirk, rejects the notion that all myths are religious or sacred. In the category of "myth", he includes many legendary accounts that are "[[Secularity|secular]]" for all practical purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Kirk 1973, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1997: [[Folklorist]]s define a myth as "a sacred [[narrative]] explaining how the world and humankind came to be in their present form".&lt;ref&gt;Dundes 1997, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2004: In religious studies, the word "myth" is usually reserved for stories whose main characters are gods or [[demigod]]s.&lt;ref name="Segal 2004, p. 5"&gt;Segal 2004, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2004: The classicist Richard Buxton defines a myth as "a socially powerful traditional story".&lt;ref&gt;Buxton, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2004: Robert A. Segal, professor of theories of religion at the [[Lancaster University]], defines "myth" broadly as any story whose "main figures [are] personalities -- divine, human, or even animal. Excluded would be impersonal forces such as Plato's Good."&lt;ref name="Segal 2004, p. 5"/&gt;

==Similarities between different religious mythologies==

Given any of the above definitions of "myth", the myths of many religions, both ancient and modern, share common elements. Widespread similarities between religious mythologies include the following:
* an initial [[Paradise]] preceding ordinary historical time&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', 1967 p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;
* the story of a god who undergoes death and resurrection ([[life-death-rebirth deity]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://altreligion.about.com/library/weekly/aa052902a.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paganlibrary.com/reference/pagan_resurrection_myths.php]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The mythical geography of many religions involves an ''[[axis mundi]]'', or Cosmic Center.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Rites, Symbols: A Mircea Eliade Reader'', 1976, pp. 372-75.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Many myths feature a global flood.&lt;ref&gt;For some examples, see Bierlein 2004, pp. 121-27.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Creation myth]]s
* [[Supreme deity (disambiguation)|Supreme deity]]&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt;
* [[Hero's journey]]

The similarities between cultures and time periods can be useful, but it is usually not easy to combine beliefs and histories from different groups. Simplification of cultures and time periods by eliminating detailed data remain vulnerable or flimsy in this area of research.

==Contrasts between different religious mythologies==

Though there are similarities among most religious mythologies, there are also contrasts. Many mythologies focus on explanations of the universe, natural phenomena, or other themes of human existence, often ascribing [[creation myth|agency]] to one or more [[deities]] or other [[supernatural]] forces. However, some religions have very few of this kind of story of cosmic explanation. For instance,  the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[parable of the arrow]] warns against such speculations as "[Is] the world eternal or not eternal? [Is] the soul different from the body? [Does] the enlightened exist after death or not?", viewing them as irrelevant to the goal of escaping suffering.&lt;ref&gt;"The Parable of the Arrow"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic views==
In [[academia]], the term "myth" often refers to stories whose culture regards them as true (as opposed to fictitious).&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', p. 1, 8-10; ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, many scholars will call a body of stories "mythology", leaving open the question of whether the stories are true or false. For example, in ''Tree of Souls: The Mythology of Judaism'', English professor Howard Schwartz writes, "the definition of 'mythology' offered here does not attempt to determine if biblical or subsequent narratives are true or false, i.e., historically accurate or not".&lt;ref name="Schwartz, p. lxxviii"&gt;Schwartz, p. lxxviii&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the beginning of modern philosophy and science in the 16th century, many Western intellectuals have seen myth as outdated.&lt;ref&gt;See Armstrong, pp. 122-27. For example, an 18th century intellectual movement called [[deism]] rejected myths about divine intervention, limiting God's role to that of a first cause (Robinson), and a 20th century movement led by the theologian [[Rudolf Bultmann]] sought to "demythologize" Christianity, reinterpreting its myths as psychological allegory (Segal, pp. 47-51; Muthuraj). Some 19th and early 20th century secular scholars predicted that science would replace myth, even in religion. The anthropologist [[Edward Burnett Tylor]] argued that science was pushing traditional mythology out of religion, which would henceforth consist only of metaphysics and ethics (Segal, p. 14). And the anthropologist [[Sir James George Frazer]] even wrote, "In the last analysis, magic, religion, and science are nothing but theories of thought; and as science has supplanted its predecessors, so it may hereafter be itself superseded by some more perfect hypothesis" (Frazer, p. 712).&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, some argued that the Christian religion would be better off without mythology, or even that Christianity would be better off without religion:&lt;ref name="Muthuraj"&gt;Muthuraj&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;[J. A. T.] Robinson argued in favor of "the detaching of the Christian doctrine of God from any necessary dependence on a 'supernaturalistic' worldview". He understood this as a prophetic aspect of the Church's ministry to the world. [...] At this time atheism was regarded as the Christian Gospel that should be preached to the world. J. J. Altizer, for example, maintained [this] boldly by stating, "Throughout its history Christian theology has been thwarted from reaching its intrinsic goal by its bondage to a transcendent, a sovereign, and an impassive God". [...] [Dietrich] Bonhoffer called persistently for "Religionless Christianity".&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the 20th century, many scholars have resisted this trend, defending myth from modern criticism.&lt;ref&gt;Segal, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mircea Eliade]], a professor of the history of religions, declared that myth did not hold religion back, that myth was an essential foundation of religion, and that eliminating myth would eliminate a piece of the human psyche.&lt;ref&gt;According to religious thought, said Eliade, myths establish models for human behavior, and "the more religious man is, the more paradigmatic models does he possess as a guide to his attitudes and actions" (Eliade, ''The Sacred and the Profane'', p. 100). Eliade believed that modern novels, ideologies, customs, and pastimes contain "mythological elements" (Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', pp. 181-93), and that some mythological elements fall within the "transconscious", which Eliade defined as a set of universal human images, symbols, and sentiments (Eliade, ''Images and Symbols'', pp. 16-17).&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade approached myth sympathetically at a time when religious thinkers were trying to purge religion of its mythological elements:&lt;ref name="Muthuraj"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Eliade wrote about "sky and sky gods" when Christian theology was shaken at its very foundations by the "death of God" theology. He spoke of "God up there" when theologians such as J. A. T. Robinson were busy with erasing the mythical language of [a] three-storied universe that underlies the early Christian thought and experience.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Similarly, [[Joseph Campbell]] believed that people could not understand their individual lives without mythology to aid them. By recalling the significance of old myths, he encouraged awareness of them.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Campbell claimed that mythology's primary function is "that of eliciting and supporting a sense of awe before the mystery of being" (Campbell, p. 519), and that mythology also serves "to initiate the individual into the order of realities of his own psyche" (Campbell, p. 521).&lt;/ref&gt; In responding to the interview question "How would you define mythology?", Joseph Campbell answered:&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Thou Are That, p. 111 [in:] James W. Menzies, True Myth, s. 25&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;My favorite definition of mythology: other people's religion. My favorite definition of religion: misunderstanding of mythology.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Religious views==
Most religions contain a body of traditional sacred stories that are believed to express profound truth. Some religious organizations and practitioners believe that some or all of their traditional stories are not only sacred and "true" but also historically accurate and [[revelation|divinely revealed]] and that calling such stories "myths" disrespects their special status. Other religious organizations and practitioners have no problem with categorizing their sacred stories as myths.

===Opposition to categorizing all sacred stories as myths===
====Modern-day opposition====
Some religious believers take offense when what they consider to be historical aspects of their faith are labeled as "myth". Such believers distinguish between religious fables or myths, on one hand, and those sacred narratives which are described by their tradition as being history or revelation, on the other. For instance, [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|Catholic priest]] Father [[John Hardon|John A. Hardon]] insists that "Christianity is not mythology. What we believe in is not religious fantasies, no matter how pious."&lt;ref&gt;Hardon&lt;/ref&gt; Evangelical Christian theologian [[Carl F. H. Henry]] insisted that "Judeo-Christian revelation has nothing in common with the category of myth".&lt;ref&gt;Carl F. H. Henry, quoted by Mohler&lt;/ref&gt;

====The roots of the popular meaning of "myth"====
Especially within Christianity, objection to the word "myth" rests on a historical basis. By the time of Christ, the Greco-Roman world had started to use the term "myth" (Greek ''muthos'') to mean "fable, fiction, lie"; as a result, the early Christian theologians used "myth" in this sense.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myth and Reality'', 1968, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the derogatory meaning of the word "myth" is the traditional Christian meaning, and the expression "Christian mythology", as used in academic discourse,&lt;ref name=grassie&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Grassie |first1=William |date=March 1998 |title=Science as Epic? Can the modern evolutionary cosmology be a mythic story for our time? |journal=Science &amp; Spirit |volume=9 |issue=1 |quote=The word 'myth' is popularly understood to mean idle fancy, fiction, or falsehood; but there is another meaning of the word in academic discourse. A myth, in this latter sense of the word, is a story that serves to define the fundamental worldview of a culture .... Using the original Greek term ''mythos'' is perhaps a better way to distinguish this more positive and all-encompassing definition of the word.}}&lt;/ref&gt; may offend Christians for this reason.

In addition, this early Christian use of the term "myth" passed into popular usage.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', 1967, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, when essential [[sacred mysteries]] and teachings are described as ''myth'', in modern English, the word often still implies that it is "idle fancy, fiction, or falsehood".&lt;ref name=grassie/&gt; This description could be taken as a direct attack on [[religious belief]], quite contrary to the meaning ostensibly intended by the academic use of the term. Further, in academic writing, though "myth" usually means a fundamental worldview story, even there it is occasionally ambiguous or clearly denotes "falsehood", as in the "[[Christ myth theory]]". The original term "[[mythos]]" (which has no pejorative connotation in English) may be a better word to distinguish the positive definition from the negative.&lt;ref name=grassie/&gt;

===Non-opposition to categorizing sacred stories as myths===
Modern day clergy and practitioners within some religious movements have no problem classifying the religion's sacred stories as "myths". They see the sacred texts as indeed containing religious truths, divinely inspired but delivered in the language of mankind. Some examples follow.

====Christianity====
[[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s love of myths and devout [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] faith came together in his assertion that [[mythology]] is the divine echo of "the Truth".&lt;ref&gt;Wood&lt;/ref&gt; Tolkien wrote that myths held "fundamental things".&lt;ref&gt;Menion, 2003/2004 citing essays by Tolkien using the words "fundamental things".&lt;/ref&gt; He expressed these beliefs in his poem ''[[Mythopoeia]]'' circa 1931, which describes myth-making as an act of "sub-creation" within God's primary creation.&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien, ''Mythopoeia'', circa 1931.&lt;/ref&gt; The poem in part says creation is "myth-woven and elf-patterned":

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;... There is no [[firmament]],
only a void, unless a jewelled tent
myth-woven and [[elf]]-patterned; and no earth,
unless the mother's womb whence all have birth.&lt;/poem&gt;|JRR Tolkien}}

Tolkien's opinion was adopted by another [[Christianity|Christian]] writer, [[C. S. Lewis]], in their conversations: "Tolkien explained to Lewis that the story of Christ was the true myth at the very heart of history and at the very root of reality."&lt;ref&gt;Pearce&lt;/ref&gt; [[C. S. Lewis]] freely called the Christ story a "true myth", and he believed that even pagan myths express spiritual truths. In his opinion, the difference between the Christ story and pagan myths is that the Christ story is historically as well as spiritually true. Lewis writes,&lt;ref&gt;letter to Arthur Greeves, quoted by Brown&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The story of Christ is simply a true myth: a myth working on us in the same way as the others, but with this tremendous difference that it really happened: and one must be content to accept it in the same way, remembering that it is God's myth where the others are men's myths: i. e. the Pagan stories are God expressing Himself through the minds of poets, using such images as He found there, while Christianity is God expressing Himself through what we call real things.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another Christian writer, the Catholic priest Father [[Andrew Greeley]], freely applies the term "myth" to Christianity. In his book ''Myths of Religion'', he defends this terminology:&lt;ref&gt;Greeley, ''Myths of Religion''; quoted in Bierlein 1994, pp. 304-5.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Many Christians have objected to my use of this word [myth] even when I define it specifically. They are terrified by a word which may even have a slight suggestion of fantasy. However, my usage is the one that is common among historians of religion, literary critics, and social scientists. It is a valuable and helpful usage; there is no other word which conveys what these scholarly traditions mean when they refer to myth. The Christian would be well advised to get over his fear of the word and appreciate how important a tool it can be for understanding the content of his faith.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At a "Consultation on the Relationship Between the Wesleyan Tradition
and the Natural Sciences" in Kansas City, Missouri, on October 19, 1991, Dennis Bratcher presented a discussion of the adaptation of Near Eastern mythical thought by the Israelites.&lt;ref name="Bratcher"&gt;Bratcher&lt;/ref&gt; Bratcher argued that the Old Testament absorbed Near Eastern pagan mythology (although he drew a sharp distinction between the literally-interpreted myths of the Near Eastern pagans and the "mythopoetic" use of imagery from pagan myths by the Hebrews). During this presentation, he gave the following disclaimer:&lt;ref name="Bratcher"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;the term "myth" as used here does not mean "false" or "fiction." Even in my old and yellowed Webster's, "fiction" is the ''third'' meaning of the word. In its primary and more technical meaning "myth" refers to a story or group of stories that serve to explain how a particular society views their world.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Judaism====
Some [[Judaism|Jewish]] scholars, including [[Dov Noy]], a professor of folklore at Hebrew University and founder of the Israel Folktale Archives, and [[Howard Schwartz (writer and editor)|Howard Schwartz]], Jewish anthologist and English professor at the University of Missouri – St. Louis, have discussed traditional Jewish stories as "mythology".&lt;ref&gt;Schram&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwarz authored the book ''Tree of Souls: The Mythology of Judaism''. It consists of myths and belief statements excerpted from—and, in some cases, synthesized from a number of excerpts from—both Biblical and non-Biblical Jewish texts. According to Schwartz, the Jewish people continue to elaborate on, and compose additions to, their traditional mythology.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, p. lxxv&lt;/ref&gt; In the book's introduction, Schwartz states that the word "myth", as used in the book, "is not offered to mean something that is not true, as in the current popular usage".&lt;ref name="Schwartz, p. lxxviii"/&gt;

====Neopaganism====
[[Neopaganism|Neopagans]] frequently refer to their sacred stories as "myths". [[Asatru]], a modern-day revival of Germanic Paganism, holds "that the [[Eddas]], Myths and [[saga|Norse Sagas]] are the divinely inspired wisdom of [its] religion".&lt;ref&gt;"About Us"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wicca]], another Neopagan movement, also applies the term "mythology" to its stories.&lt;ref&gt;"The Wheel of the Year / the Sabbats"; "What is Wicca?"; "Workshops and Talks"&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sentimentalism''' is a practice of being [[Sentimentality|sentimental]], and thus tending toward basing actions and reactions upon emotions and feelings, in preference{{cn|date=May 2018}} to reason.&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;"sentimentalism, n.", ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt; 

As a [[Mode (literature)|literary mode]], sentimentalism has been a recurring aspect of world literature. Sentimentalism includes a variety of aspects in literature, such as sentimental poetry, the sentimental novel, and the German sentimentalist music movement, [[Sensitive style|Empfindsamkeit]]. European literary sentimentalism arose during the [[Age of Enlightenment]], partly as a response to [[Moral sense theory|sentimentalism in philosophy]]. In eighteenth-century [[England]], the [[sentimental novel]] was a major literary genre.

== Philosophical influences ==


Sentimentalism in philosophy and sentimentalism in literature are sometimes hard to distinguish.{{cn|date=March 2013}} As the philosophical arguments developed, the literature soon tried to emulate by putting the philosophical into practice through narration and characters. As a result, it is common to observe both philosophical and literary movements simultaneously.

Philosophically, sentimentalism was often contrasted to [[rationalism]]. While 18th-century rationalism corresponded itself with the development of the analytic mind as the basis for acquiring truth, sentimentalism hinged upon an intrinsic human capacity to feel and how this leads to truth. For the sentimentalist this capacity was most important in morality ([[moral sense theory]]). Sentimentalists contended that where the rationalists believed morality was founded upon analytic principles (i.e. Immanuel Kant's "Categorical Imperative") these principles could not be adequately founded in the empirical nature of humans—such as observing a sad image or expressing a strong emotion physically. Therefore, one could not obtain a sound moral theory. However, by developing the moral sensibility and fine tuning the capacity to feel, a person could access a sound moral theory by building from an intrinsic human nature, which each person possessed. Sentimentalists were, thus, often seen as relating to the schools of humanism and empirical ethical intuitionism.

== Characteristics ==


Sentimentalism asserted that over-shown feeling was not a weakness but rather showed one to be a moral person.  Arising from religiously motivated empathy, it expanded to the other perceptions - for example, sensual love was no longer understood as a destructive passion ([[vanity|Vanitas]]) but rather as a basis of social institutions, as it was for [[Antoine Houdar de la Motte]].  Requited love was, as in serious opera (the [[Tragédie en musique]] or [[Opera seria]]), a symbol for a successful alliance between nations.  The "[[Lesesucht]]" re-evaluated what was permitted literature, and the novel as a type of literature as versus drama.  

Around the middle of the century, sentimentalism set "untouched" nature against (courtly) civilization, as in the works of [[Jean Jacques Rousseau]].  In addition, [[Samuel Richardson]]'s sentimental [[epistolary novel]] "[[Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded]]" (1740) had great literary influence.

The literary work often featured scenes of distress and tenderness, and the plot was arranged to advance emotions rather than action. The result was a valorization of "fine feeling," displaying the characters as a model for refined, moral and emotional effect. Sentimentalism in literature was also often used as a medium through which authors could promote their own agendas—imploring readers to empathize with the problems they are dealing with in their books.

For example, in Laurence Sterne's novel, ''[[A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy]]'', the narrator is using the sentimental character Yorick as a device to critique the obligation of morality, whether it is sentimental or rational.  
There is a scene early in the novel where Yorick meets a monk and refuses "to give him a single sous [a penny]." He feels discontent when he disregards what he senses he ought to do, even though he appears to obey "better reason" (4). Rationally, he disregards his sentimental obligation because "there is no regular reasoning upon the ebbs and flows of our humours" (6) [i.e. our emotions]. While he argues against the authority of sense, ultimately this sense creates discontent in his conscience. After the monk leaves empty handed, it is Yorick's "heart" that "smote [him] the moment [the monk] shut the door" (7). Accordingly, Yorick has "behaved very ill" (7). He has complied with his rational maxim, the justified action of his "great claims" argument (6). Yet he senses from the conscience of his sentimental nature that he has done wrong.

== ''Empfindsamkeit'' ==

In continental Europe, one aspect of sentimentalism was ''Empfindsamkeit''. The [[sensitive style]] (German: ''empfindsamer Stil'') of music, developed in Germany, aimed to express "true and natural" feelings, in contrast to the [[Baroque music|baroque]].

The origin of sentimentalism in this context was chiefly religious, with the emotionally coloured texts for the [[oratorio]]s of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] stream being typical examples.  Empfindsamkeit is also known as secularized [[pietism]] because it frequently came with moralizing content that had increasingly broken free of church and religious ties.  An important theorist of the movement was [[Jean Baptiste Dubos]].

===In Germany===
The musician and publisher [[Johann Christoph Bode]] translated [[Laurence Sterne]]'s novel, ''A sentimental Journey Through France and Italy'', into German in 1768 under the title ''Yoriks empfindsame Reise'' - the translation was a great success.  His word "empfindsam" or "sensitive" was a [[neologism]] that then became attached to [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] and the whole literary period.

German poets who verged on sentimentalism were [[Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock]] (1724–1803), [[Christian Fürchtegott Gellert]] (1715–1769) and [[Sophie de La Roche]] (1730–1807, the author of the first [[epistolary novel]] in German) and its influence may also be seen in [[Goethe]]'s early work ''[[Die Leiden des jungen Werthers]]'' (1774), a high-point of [[Sturm und Drang]].

===Results===
Religious sentimentalism has often been considered as inspiration for [[François-René de Chateaubriand]] and his creation of [[Romanticism]], which was another literary genre that emerged late in the 18th Century. In popular literature, Empfindsamkeit was a common genre that continued into the 19th Century, and was found in serialised novels in periodicals such as ''[[Die Gartenlaube|Gartenlaube]]''.  In a theatre sense, Empfindsamkeit was succeeded by [[melodrama|rührstück]] or melodrama.

The '''Staatliche Graphische Sammlung''' in [[Munich]] (München), Germany, is a large collection of drawings, prints and engravings. It contains 400,000 sheets starting from the 15th century from various artists around the world. Along with [[Kupferstichkabinett Berlin]] and [[Kupferstich-Kabinett (Dresden)|Kupferstichkabinett Dresden]], it is the most important collection of its kind in Germany. It is owned by the government of [[Bavaria]] and located within the [[Kunstareal]], a museum quarter in the city centre of Munich.

==History==
Its history dates back to 1758 [[Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria]] (Carl Theodor von der Pfalz) in the [[Mannheim Palace]] with his ''Kupferstich- und Zeichnungskabinett''. In 1794, it was brought to Munich because of French troops. In 1839, parts of the collection were first publicly displayed in the ''Kupferstich-Kabinett'' of [[Alte Pinakothek]]. In 1874, it became an independent and government-owned museum. In 1905, it was renamed to ''Königliche Graphische Sammlung''. In 1917, the inventory was moved to [[Neue Pinakothek]] until 1944. In 1949, it was renamed to ''Staatliche Graphische Sammlung'' and relocated to [[Münchner Haus der Kulturinstitute]]. In 2002, the Graphische Sammlung has own exhibition areas in the [[Pinakothek der Moderne]] for temporary exhibitions (''Sonderausstellungen'').

== Inventory ==

A '''stripped book''' is a [[mass market paperback]] that has been stripped of its cover in order to be [[Pulping|pulped]] and [[Paper recycling|recycled]] as a result of lack of sales. The covers are returned to the publisher as evidence that the books have been destroyed and the books are discarded or recycled into paper or cardboard products. However, some stripped books end up back on the marketplace, and are sold at places like [[flea markets]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4973">'''Symphony No. 1''' is a [[symphony]] in one movement by the American composer [[Christopher Rouse (composer)|Christopher Rouse]].  The work was commissioned by [[David Zinman]] and the [[Baltimore Symphony Orchestra]], completed August 26, 1986, and premiered in [[Baltimore]], January 21, 1988.  The piece is dedicated to Rouse's friend and fellow composer [[John Harbison]].&lt;ref name="Score"&gt;[[Christopher Rouse (composer)|Rouse, Christopher]]. [http://www.christopherrouse.com/sym1press.html Symphony No. 1: Program Note by the Composer]. 1986. Retrieved March 3, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
The symphony is composed in a single adagio movement and has a duration of approximately 27 minutes.  The work was conceived, in part, as a companion to Rouse's 1984 [[orchestra]]l piece ''[[Gorgon (composition)|Gorgon]]''.&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;

===Style and influences===
The music quotes [[Anton Bruckner]]'s [[Symphony No. 7 (Bruckner)|Symphony No. 7]].  In the program notes to the score, Rouse commented on his inspirations and the use of Bruckner, saying, "In my Symphony No. 1 I have attempted to pay conscious homage to many of those I especially admire as composers of adagios -- [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]], [[Jean Sibelius|Sibelius]], [[Karl Amadeus Hartmann|Hartmann]], [[Allan Pettersson|Pettersson]], and [[William Schuman|Schuman]], for example -- but only one is recognizably quoted (the famous opening theme from the second movement of Bruckner's Symphony No. 7, played both in the original and here by a quartet of [[Wagner Tuba]]s)."&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;

===Instrumentation===
The piece is scored for two [[Western concert flute|flutes]] (2nd doubling on [[piccolo]]), two [[oboe]]s (2nd doubling on [[oboe d'amore]] and [[English horn]]), two [[clarinet]]s (2nd doubling on [[bass clarinet]]), two [[bassoon]]s (2nd doubling on [[contrabassoon]]), four [[French horn]]s (all doubling [[Wagner Tuba]]s), three [[trumpet]]s, three [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], percussion (three players), and [[String section|strings]] ([[violin]]s I &amp; II, [[viola]]s, [[violoncello]]s, and [[double bass]]es).&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;

==Reception==
Music critic David Hurwitz described the work as "wholly gripping and vividly contrasted despite the slow pacing and prevailing gloomy atmosphere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hurwitz |first=David  |title=Rouse: Symphony No. 1; Clarinet concerto |work=Classics Today |date=October 17, 2008 |url=http://www.classicstoday.com/review/review-14612/ |accessdate=March 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reviewing the 1992 [[Los Angeles]] premiere of the symphony, Daniel Cariaga of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote, "In the 27 intense minutes of this L.A. premiere performance, the Symphony sometimes loudly achieved a finally quiet victory over pessimism, all the while engaging the observer in its progress to that not-predictable end.  [Rouse] calls this piece tonal, and it may be, if one counts the number of bars in which consonance, rather than grating dissonance, holds sway. But what one remembers is the bite of atonality on the way to sound-resolutions in this gripping, abstract musical scenario."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cariaga |first=Daniel |title=MUSIC REVIEW : L.A.

Conversely, Calum MacDonald of ''[[BBC Music Magazine]]'' was less favorable, describing the work as "inhabiting a blackness somewhere beyond Shostakovich and Pettersson" and adding, "the single-movement First Symphony (1986) takes a familiar theme from Bruckner’s Seventh and subjects its aspiration to all manner of ironic and negative underminings and reversals, ending in exhausted elegy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=MacDonald |first=Calum |title=Rouse: Iscariot; Clarinet Concerto; Symphony No. 1 |work=[[BBC Music Magazine]] |date=January 20, 2012 |url=http://www.classical-music.com/review/rouse-iscariot-0 |accessdate=March 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6940">The '''Symphony in G minor''' was the only completed [[symphony]] written by [[Ernest John Moeran]].  He wrote it in 1934–37.  It is in four movements.

In 1926, the conductor of the [[The Hallé|Hallé Orchestra]], Sir [[Hamilton Harty]], commissioned a symphony from Moeran.&lt;ref name=goliath&gt;[http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-2556478/Moeran-Symphony-Sinfonietta-Guide-to.html Goliath]&lt;/ref&gt;  He had already been working on a symphony since 1924, and the premiere performance of the new work was announced for 4 March 1926.  However, when it was almost finished, he decided he was not satisfied with its structure and withdrew it.&lt;ref name=jstor&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/962517 JSTOR, December 1980]&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the next eight years he worked on his revision of the piece, but in 1934 he abandoned his sketches and started again.  He reused some earlier material, but the work was substantially new.&lt;ref name=jstor/&gt; The symphony was finished on 24 January 1937,&lt;ref name=beyond&gt;[http://frombeyondthestave.blogspot.com/2009/07/most-glorious-of-english-symphonies.html From Beyond the Stave: The most glorious of English symphonies]&lt;/ref&gt; and dedicated to Harty.&lt;ref name=naxos&gt;[http://www.naxos.com/mainsite/blurbs_reviews.asp?item_code=8.555837&amp;catNum=555837&amp;filetype=About%20this%20Recording&amp;language=English# Naxos]&lt;/ref&gt; Harty initially refused the dedication after he was overlooked as the conductor for the first performance (by now he was ill and had left the Hallé Orchestra).&lt;ref name=goliath/&gt;&lt;ref name=beyond/&gt;

The work takes about 45 minutes to play, and is in four movements:
* ''Allegro''
* ''Lento''
* ''Vivace''&lt;ref&gt;A sort of [[scherzo]], though not marked as such in score.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Lento – Allegro molto''

The symphony is scored for 2 [[flute]]s (II takes piccolo), 2 [[oboe]]s, 2 [[clarinet]]s, 2 [[bassoon]]s, 4 [[French horn|horns]], 3 [[trumpet]]s, 3 [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], [[percussion]] ([[triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], [[tamtam]], [[tenor drum]], [[snare drum]], [[bass drum]], [[cymbals]]), [[harp]], and [[string instrument|string]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Instrumentation from the 1942(/1943?) Novello student? score (plate 16985).&lt;/ref&gt;

The symphony's first movement is a robust sonata form, with a questioning harmonic structure.

Much of the work was written in [[County Kerry]], [[Ireland]], where Moeran spent most of this time, but the slow second movement was inspired by the sand dunes and marshes of East [[Norfolk]], [[England]],&lt;ref name=naxos/&gt; and may have its roots in Moeran's 1924 arrangement of a folk-song called ''The Shooting of His Dear'' (the 5th of his ''Six Songs from Norfolk'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.classical.net/music/comp.lst/works/moeran/symphony.php Classical Net] This connection was suggested by Geoffrey Self, a Moeran biographer, but remains conjectural, not supported, in his biography.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first performance was on 13 January 1938 in the [[Queen's Hall]], played by the [[Royal Philharmonic Society]], conducted by [[Leslie Heward]], whom Moeran considered to be the work's finest interpreter.&lt;ref name=beyond/&gt;  It was played at [[The Proms|a Prom Concert]] on 11 August 1938, with the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]] under Sir [[Henry Wood]].  (It did not receive its second performance at the Proms until 23 July 2009, under [[Vassily Sinaisky]].&lt;ref name=prom&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/classicalmusic/5779831/Proms-2009-EJ-Moerans-Symphony-in-G-Minor.html The Telegraph, 8 July 2009, Proms 2009: EJ Moeran's Symphony in G Minor]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/proms/archive/search/work/symphony-in-g-minor/11831 BBC Proms Archive - Moeran Symphony in G minor Appearances]&lt;/ref&gt;)

The work and its orchestration show the influence of other composers, including [[Arnold Bax|Bax]], [[Frederick Delius|Delius]], [[Peter Warlock|Warlock]], [[Bernard van Dieren|van Dieren]], and most particularly [[Jean Sibelius|Sibelius]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2002/Oct02/Ernest_John_MOERAN.htm Music Web International]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Scherzo begins and ends with a solo oboe, as does the Scherzo of Sibelius's [[Symphony No. 4 (Sibelius)|4th Symphony]]; there are echoes of ''[[Tapiola (Sibelius)|Tapiola]]''.  The influence of folk elements is also apparent: [[Eric Blom]] said it contains "a touch of dialect".  There are also [[jazz]]-influenced rhythms.&lt;ref name=prom/&gt;

The work was originally subject to considerable criticism, on the grounds that it was too derivative ([[Wilfrid Mellers]] said it could not have been written before [[Ralph Vaughan Williams|Vaughan Williams]] had shown how to write a symphony&lt;ref name=prom/&gt;), undisciplined and showed the composer's inexperience of symphonic form.&lt;ref&gt;Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed., 1954, Vol. V, p. 813&lt;/ref&gt; By 1942, however, it had become accepted. In that year, [[Novello &amp; Co]] published the symphony,&lt;ref&gt;See {{OCLC|4623556}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[British Council]] undertook a promotion of British culture overseas.  The music section of the project was a recording of significant recent compositions by British composers, and Moeran's Symphony in G minor was the first work to be recorded.&lt;ref name=naxos/&gt;  It was recorded in November/December 1942, in [[Manchester]], with the Hallé Orchestra under Leslie Heward.  The composer was present for some of the sessions (he proved to be a distraction, and it was suggested he let the musicians get on with their job without his "assistance"). Heward was already seriously ill with [[tuberculosis]], and died only five months later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.audaud.com/article.php?ArticleID=6396 Audiophile Audition]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other conductors to record Moeran's Symphony in G minor include [[Neville Dilkes]] ([[English Sinfonia]], 1972), Sir [[Adrian Boult]] ([[Philharmonia Orchestra|New Philharmonia Orchestra]], released 1975),&lt;ref&gt;{{OCLC|10632467}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vernon Handley]] ([[Ulster Orchestra]], 1987) and [[David Lloyd-Jones (conductor)|David Lloyd-Jones]] ([[Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra]], 2001).

Moeran completed no more full symphonies.  His three-movement ''Sinfonietta'' appeared in 1944, and an orchestral ''Serenade'' in 1948.  He was working on a second symphony (in E{{music|flat}}) at the time of his death in 1950. The manuscript of that work&lt;ref&gt;the sketches to the 2nd symphony have since been edited, realised (by [[Martin Yates]], in 2011) and recorded on [[Dutton Vocalion|Dutton Epoch]] - see http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2012/Mar12/Moeran_sy2_CDLX7281.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and various others were donated by his widow [[Peers Coetmore]] to the [[University of Melbourne Faculty of VCA and MCM|Victorian College of the Arts]] in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]].&lt;ref name=jstor/&gt;

The importance of music in Taoist ceremony is demonstrated by revealing how central beliefs are reflected through elements of music such as pandas, instrumentation and rhythm.  The ritual celebrating the birth of [[Guanyin]] was observed at the [[Evergreen Taoist Church of Australia]], Deagon to identify structure, role of participants, music forms and instrumentation.  Expression of spiritual beliefs through music enables followers of Taoism to enhance their path to enlightenment.

== Music in Taoist ceremony== 
Music has long played an integral part in religious ceremonies.  In [[Taoism|Taoist]] ceremonies, music has several different functions.  Taoists believe that music is a way to speak to the gods, to inspire religious followers and to achieve inner harmony, bringing the listener or participant closer to Tao.  Tao is the path to enlightenment, the goal of all followers of the Taoist faith.  To follow Tao is to recognise the inner harmony and balance in all living things. This belief is often represented in the [[Yin Yang]] symbol. In the ceremony witnessed at the Evergreen Taoist Church of Australia, Deagon, the birth of [[Quan Yin]], the goddess of mercy was celebrated.  Music and instrumentation played a central role in this ritual.  The priests sung each chant and prayer to their gods, and accompanied these on musical instruments.  The musical expression of a Taoist ceremony supports the core beliefs of the religion.  Firstly, the role of music in the ceremony will be described, showing its religious importance to Taoism.  Secondly, this relates the structure of the birth of [[Quan Yin]] ceremony to the achievement of Tao.  The principal doctrines of Taoism and the roles of the various participants in the ceremony will also be described. Following this, the demeanour of participants and the physical setting of the ceremony will be illustrated.  Studying the role of music in Taoist ceremony will demonstrate the importance of music in religion as a means to inspire followers, improve and deepen faith, and enable communication with gods.  Describing how the music in the ceremony witnessed communicates and confirms the belief systems of Taoism will reveal music is as intrinsic to the Taoist as the path of Tao itself.

==Background on Taoism==
Taoism or Daoism, as it is commonly referred to, is an ancient Chinese religion and philosophy.  Taoism can be traced to a 6th-century B.C. scripture written by [[Lao Tzu]], the [[Tao Te Ching]] (Verellen, 1995).  Tao Te Ching translates into the classic of the way and its virtue .  The writings of the Tao Te Ching support passive behaviour and promote natural harmony with nature.  The main underlying theme to the writings is the value of wu-wei, (non-striving) “by which one returns to a primitive state closer to the Tao”. (Duyvendak, Chan, Lau, Mitchell, &amp; Mair, 2005).   These writings are considered to be influenced by [[Buddhist]] ideals, [[Confucian]] philosophy and traditional ancient Chinese mysticism ([http://english.ccnt.com.cn/?catog=music&amp;file=020300&amp;page=3&amp;ads=service_001,2005]).

==Anecdote drawn from the Evergreen Taoist Church of Australia==
The priests of the Evergreen Taoist Church of Australia are devotees of an order of Taoism known as the Evergreen Taoist Religious Order (EVTRO).  They follow the teachings of the “principal canons” of Taoism (Verellen, 1995).  The Taoists of the EVTRO believe in being apart from the need of worldly possessions, and aim at creating a solidarity and harmony between heaven and man.  One way in which they hope to achieve this is by giving freely of their time in public ceremonies to help others come closer to their own inner harmony.

In the Taoist ceremony of the birth of [[Quan Yin]], music was a key component of the service.  The entire dialogue of the ritual was intoned or sung by the priests, and these prayers were always accompanied by instrumentation ([http://english.ccnt.com.cn/?catog=music&amp;file=020300&amp;page=3&amp;ads=service_001,2005]).  The chanting and instrumentation are used by the priests of Taoism as a tool to achieving the Tao (Bowker, 2000).  The Tao is described as the way or the path (Park, 2001).  Taoists understand that by following the path of Tao and reaching a balance with all things a human can gain self-realization.  Music assists the follower on his/her path to the Tao by helping to communicate with gods, reach inner harmony and come closer to finding balance with the world.

==Yin and Yang tones==
The principal belief of the [[Yin Yang]] is reflected in the categorisation of musical tones.  The two main forms of Taoist music are the Yin Tone and the Yang Tone ([http://english.ccnt.com.cn/?catog=music&amp;file=020300&amp;page=3&amp;ads=service_001,2005]).  Yin stands for all things that are female and soft and Yang stands for all things male and hard.  Through the proper balance of Yin (female) and Yang (male) a Taoist can find harmony and simplicity in all things (Bowker, 2000).  Taoists strive to have these cosmic forces within themselves and around them at peace and in balance (Keown, 2003). 

The Yang tone is used in rituals mainly for the benefit of the priests, spirits and gods [http://english.ccnt.com.cn/?catog=music&amp;file=020300&amp;page=3&amp;ads=service_001,2005]).  .  The ceremony held to celebrate the birth of the god Quan Yin, one of the deities of Taoism, started with chanting in the Yang tone. The other form, Yin Tone, is music aimed at appeasing and entertaining the general populace.  This creates a harmony with the Yang tone, by giving to the people what the Yang tone gives to the gods and priests.  Yin tones are usually performed at outer altars to inspire the populace in their beliefs and are livelier and more melodic than Yang tunes (Long, 2005).  The ceremony of the birth of Quan Yin consisted of elements of both the Yang tone and the Yin tone.  This combination of tones symbolizes the balance Taoists strive to achieve.  

The Yang tones were initially staged in the hall of the three purities.  The three purities are the highest deities in Taoism and they are said to reside over the heavens (Murashige, 2005).    The ceremony involved three female priests, two of which wore robes of simple red and black and the main priest wore a richly decorated robe of a jade colour.  The priests stood in front of the three purities and read from prayer books before them.  The priests maintained this formation throughout the entire ceremony until the end, when the main priest led them in single file around each of the altars in the temple to pay their respects to the other gods.

The ceremony started with the three priests chanting in a mono syllabic, often repeated phrase with only slight melodic deviation from the tonic.  The melodic deviation was rising in a pentatonic style chord then dropping in similar pentatonic step wise motion until the melody arrived back at the tonic, in a wave type phrase (Figure 2).  Most melodic phrases in the ceremony ended in descending tones, heading back to the tonic (to gain harmony and balance, like yin-yang) before starting the next phrase.  Later on, as the ceremony was finishing off, the music strayed from the Yang Tone and headed more towards the Yin tone.  The priests made their way around the temple to the other places of worship and the forecourt, for the purpose of the general populace observing the ritual.  The prayers in this section were still somewhat intoned.  More melodic phrasing was heard and the rhythms became faster and more syncopated.  These rhythms, syncopations and melodic ideas all relate to the core belief of Taoism, balance and harmony.  

The demeanour and interaction between the priests and worshippers reflected an air of individual focus.  The priests were constantly absorbed on the prayers, chanting, and rhythm and ignored all other matters.  Many other worshippers came and went as the ceremony progressed and paid their respects to the three purities and the two adjoining altars on either side of the main altar, at which the ceremony was held.  The worshippers made no appearance of solemnity towards the ceremony and came and went as they pleased, leaving incense offerings and praying.  In the following of Tao, each of these worshippers had their own inner harmony and this in no way intruded on the Tao of the ceremony, or the Tao of the priests.

==Instruments and gestures==
The priests in the ceremony used a variety of instruments.  The main priest used hand movements and ritual objects influenced by Chinese mysticism.  These gestures are used in Yang tone ceremonies in combination with magical instruments ([http://english.ccnt.com.cn/?catog=music&amp;file=020300&amp;page=3&amp;ads=service_001,2005]).  Magical instruments are believed to manifest magical powers during rituals.  The Yang tone is mainly played with magical instruments such as the Qing (metal bowl) and the Faqi (ritual percussion section). The Faqi often consisted of large drums, bells, and wooden fish blocks called Muyu (Jones, 2005).  These are played to help mediation and to compliment the ritual actions of the priests (Hong, 2005).  The musical instruments used in this ceremony, the Qing and the Muyu, are said to be indispensable (Hong, 2005).  These are also used to set the time of the chanting and to add to the religious atmosphere.  Through most of the parts of the ceremony a steady beat on the Muyu (Figure 5) and Qing (Figure 4) accompanied the chanting, with sections between prayers ending with a syncopated rhythm of the Qing and Muyu (Figure 3).

==Themes==
Music has been established as a key element of Taoist ceremony.  By examining the role of music in Taoist rituals, it is evident that instrumentation and vocalisation play central roles.  The structure of the event has been shown to symbolise the balance ideal of Taoism.  The core concept of Yin-Yang balance has been revealed as a theme that is acknowledged in areas of ceremony such as intonation, melodic deviation, rhythm and form.  The conduct of the various participants and the setting of the ceremony have also been outlined.  By examining the ceremony of the birth of Quan Yin, at the Evergreen Taoist Church of Australia, it is clear that music is used to guide its followers and practitioners on their path to universal harmony. In the balanced philosophy of Taoism without music there would only be silence, solitary, alone and unbalanced.

[[Image:Vasnetsov Frog Princess.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Viktor Vasnetsov]], ''The Frog Tsarevna'', 1918.]]

'''The Frog Princess''' is a [[fairy tale]] that has multiple versions with various origins. It is classified as type 402, the animal bride, in the [[Aarne–Thompson|Aarne–Thompson index]].&lt;ref&gt;Georgias A. Megas, ''Folktales of Greece'', p 224, University of Chicago Press, Chicago and London, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; Another tale of this type is ''[[Doll i' the Grass]]''.&lt;ref name="ashliman"&gt;D. L. Ashliman, "[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0402.html Animal Brides: folktales of Aarne–Thompson type 402 and related stories]"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Russian language|Russian]] variants include the ''Frog Princess'' or ''[[Tsarevna]] Frog'' (''Царевна Лягушка'', ''Tsarevna Lyagushka'')&lt;ref&gt;{{wikisource-inline|Russian Wonder Tales/The Frog-Tzarevna|The Frog-Tzarevna}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also '''Vasilisa the Wise''' (''Василиса Премудрая'', ''Vasilisa Premudraya''); [[Alexander Afanasyev]] collected variants in his ''[[Narodnye russkie skazki]]''. [[Andrew Lang]] included an Italian variant titled '''The Frog''' in ''[[The Violet Fairy Book]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Lang, ''The Violet Fairy Book'', [http://www.mythfolklore.net/andrewlang/055.htm "The Frog"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Italo Calvino]] included another Italian variant from Piedmont, '''The Prince Who Married a Frog''', in ''[[Italian Folktales]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Italo Calvino, Italian Folktales p 438 {{ISBN|0-15-645489-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he noted that the tale was common throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Italo Calvino, Italian Folktales p 718 {{ISBN|0-15-645489-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Georgios A. Megas included a Greek variant, '''The Enchanted Lake''', in ''Folktales of Greece''.&lt;ref&gt;Georgias A. Megas, ''Folktales of Greece'', p 49, University of Chicago Press, Chicago and London, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The [[Monarch|king]] (or an old peasant woman, in Lang's version) wants his three sons to marry. To accomplish this, he creates a test to help them find brides. The king tells each prince to shoot an arrow. According to the King's rules, each prince will find his bride where the arrow lands. The youngest son's arrow is picked up by a [[frog]]. The king assigns his three prospective daughters-in-law various tasks, such as spinning cloth and baking bread. In every task, the frog far outperforms the two other lazy brides-to-be. In some versions, the frog uses magic to accomplish the tasks, and though the other brides attempt to emulate the frog, they cannot perform the magic. Still, the young prince is ashamed of his frog bride until she is magically transformed into a human princess.

In Calvino's version, the princes use slings rather than bows and arrows. In the Greek version, the princes set out to find their brides one by one; the older two are already married by the time the youngest prince starts his quest. Another variation involves the sons chopping down trees and heading in the direction pointed by them in order to find their brides.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.ca/Out-everywhere-Tales-new-world/dp/0888994028 Out of the Everywhere: New Tales for Canada, Jan Andrews]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ivan Bilibin 054 full.jpeg|thumb|250px|Illustration to ''The Frog Tsarevna'' by [[Ivan Bilibin]]]]
In the Russian versions of the story, Prince Ivan and his two older brothers shoot arrows in different directions to find brides. The other brothers' arrows land in the houses of the daughters of an aristocratic and wealthy [[merchant]]. Ivan's arrow lands in the mouth of a frog in a swamp, who turns into a princess at night. The Frog Princess, named Vasilisa the Wise, is a beautiful, intelligent, friendly, skilled girl who was forced to spend 3 years in a frog's skin for disobeying [[Koschei]]. Her final test may be to dance at the king's banquet. The Frog Princess sheds her skin, and the prince then burns it, to her dismay. Had the prince been patient, the Frog Princess would have been freed but instead he loses her. He then sets out to find her again and meets with [[Baba Yaga]], whom he impresses with his spirit, asking why she has not offered him hospitality. She tells him that Koschei is holding his bride captive and explains how to find the magic needle needed to rescue his bride. In another version, the prince's bride flies into Baba Yaga's hut as a [[bird]]. The prince catches her, she turns into a [[lizard]], and he cannot hold on. Baba Yaga rebukes him and sends him to her sister, where he fails again. However, when he is sent to the [[Rule of three (writing)|third]] sister, he catches her and no [[Shapeshifting#Transformation chase|transformations]] can break her free again.

In some versions of the story, the Frog Princess' transformation is a reward for her good nature. In one version, she is transformed by witches for their amusement. In yet another version, she is revealed to have been an enchanted princess all along.

==Variants==
This tale is closely related to ''[[Puddocky]]'' and its variants, in which a king sets three tasks to his sons to determine which is best suited to rule the country, and a transformed frog helps the youngest prince.

==Adaptations==
* ''[[Vasilisa the Beautiful (1939 film)|Vasilisa the Beautiful]]'', a 1939 Soviet film directed by [[Aleksandr Rou]], is based on this plot. It was the first large-budget feature in the [[Soviet Union]] to use fantasy elements, as opposed to the [[Socialist realism|realistic]] style long favored politically.&lt;ref&gt;James Graham, [http://www.endicott-studio.com/crossroads/crBabaYagaF.html Baba Yaga in Film] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130109100659/http://www.endicott-studio.com/crossroads/crBabaYagaF.html |date=2013-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1953 the director [[Mikhail Tsekhanovsky]] had the idea of animating this popular national fairy tale. Production took two years, and the premiere took place in December, 1954. At present the film is included in the gold classics of "[[Soyuzmultfilm]]". &lt;!-- In 1960 it won the "Silver Oak Leaf" prize on the [[IFF]] in Mar del Plata (Argentina).  SEE TALK PAGE, "Mar del Plata".--&gt;
* ''[[Vasilisa the Beautiful (1977 film)|Vasilisa the Beautiful]]'', a 1977 Soviet animated film is also based on this fairy tale.
* In 1996, a animated Russian version based on an in-depth version of the tale in the film "Classic Fairy Tales From Around the World" on VHS. This version tells of how the beautiful Princess Vasilisa was kidnapped and cursed by the evil wizard Kashay to make her his bride and only the love of the handsome Prince Ivan can free her.
* Taking inspiration from the Russian story, Vasilisa appears to assist Hellboy against Koschei in the 2007 [[comic book]] ''[[Hellboy: Darkness Calls]]''.
* The Frog Princess was featured in ''[[Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child]]'', where it was depicted in a country setting. The episode features the voice talents of [[Jasmine Guy]] as Frog Princess Lylah, [[Greg Kinnear]] as Prince Gavin, [[Wallace Langham]] as Prince Bobby, [[Mary Gross]] as Elise, and [[Beau Bridges]] as King Big Daddy.

Throughout the band's career, the members (especially vocalist Roddy Moreno) openly expressed opposition to [[racism]] and [[fascism]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-oppressed-mn0000476048/biography&lt;/ref&gt; — in their lyrics,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allmusic.com/album/music-for-hooligans-mw0000616387&lt;/ref&gt; interviews, on-stage comments and other actions. In 1989, Moreno visited [[New York City]] and met a few members of [[Skinheads Against Racial Prejudice]] (SHARP). On his return to the [[United Kingdom]], he started promoting SHARP ideals to British skinheads.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoppressed.co.uk/home.html The Oppressed; Official Website&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/music/sites/oppressed/ BBC - Wales - The Oppressed&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The band has also had ties to other anti-racist groups, such as [[Anti-Fascist Action]].  Moreno is a [[Cardiff City F.C.]] supporter, and some of the band's songs express that support. 

The band has split and re-formed several times, the first occasion in 1984 after which Moreno focused on his record labels, Oi! Records and Ska Records for the remainder of the decade.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.discogs.com/label/145573-Oi!-Records&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.insurgence.net/component/content/article/144&lt;/ref&gt; Their most recent split was in 2006, but they re-formed in 2009, and continue performing today.

The Oppressed 2013 line up featured, alongside Roddy Moreno on vocals and guitar, Paul Cobley on bass and Tony Kizmus on drums.

==History==
WAAC was founded in 1975 to bring together conservators practicing in the western United States to exchange ideas, information and news.

One of the prime forces behind the creation of the Western Association for Art Conservation, or Western Association of Art Conservators as it was initially called, was Benjamin Bishop Johnson,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=James L. |last=Greaves|title= A Remembrance: Benjamin Bishop Johnson |work=WAAC Newsletter |volume= 13, Number 1 |date=January 1991 |page=10 |url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/waac/wn/wn13/wn13-1/wn13-104.html |publisher=Cool.conservation-us.org |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; who served as the first President of the organization; and at the time was Chief Conservator at [[LACMA]], as well as a lecturer at [[UCLA]].

{{about|a book by [[Leo Tolstoy]]|the general topic of defining "art" and determining what counts as art|classificatory disputes about art}}
'''''What is Art?''''' ({{lang-ru|Что такое искусство?}} ''Chto takoye iskusstvo?'') is a book by [[Leo Tolstoy]]. It was completed in Russian in 1897 but first published in English due to difficulties with the Russian censors.&lt;ref&gt;Simmons, Ernest (1973). ''What is Art?'', in ''Tolstoy''. London: Routledge and Kegan Paul. p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tolstoy cites the time, effort, public funds, and public respect spent on art and artists&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy, Leo (1995 [1897]). ''What is Art?'' (Translated by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky). London: Penguin. pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the imprecision of general opinions on art&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], pp. 9-13.&lt;/ref&gt; as reason for writing the book. In his words, "it is difficult to say what is meant by art, and especially what is good, useful art, art for the sake of which we might condone such sacrifices as are being offered at its shrine".&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the book Tolstoy demonstrates an "unremitting moralism",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jahn|first1=Gary R.|title=The aesthetic theory of Leo Tolstoy's ''What is Art?''|journal=Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism|date=1975|volume=34|issue=1|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; evaluating artworks in light of his radical Christian ethics,&lt;ref&gt;Jahn 1975, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; and displaying a willingness to dismiss accepted masters, including [[Wagner]],&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], pp. 101-12.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shakespeare]],&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], pp. 33-4, 137.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dante]],&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 95, 137.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the bulk of his own writings.&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], pp. 197-198.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having rejected the use of beauty in definitions of art (see [[#Aesthetic Theory|aesthetic theory]]), Tolstoy conceptualises art as anything that communicates emotion: "Art begins when a man, with the purpose of communicating to other people a feeling he once experienced, calls it up again within himself and expresses it by certain external signs".&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

This view of art is inclusive: "jokes", "home decoration", and "church services" may all be considered art as long as they convey feeling.&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 41, Jahn 1975, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also amoral: "[f]eelings … very bad and very good, if only they infect the reader … constitute the subject of art".&lt;ref name="Tolstoy 1995 1897, p. 39"&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tolstoy also notes that the "sincerity" of the artist—that is, the extent to which the artist "experiences the feeling he conveys"—influences the infection.&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 121, 93, 99-100.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evaluating the content of art ==

While Tolstoy's basic conception of art is broad&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; and amoral,&lt;ref name="Tolstoy 1995 1897, p. 39"/&gt; his idea of "good" art is strict and moralistic, based on what he sees as the function of art in the development of humanity:

&lt;blockquote&gt;just as in the evolution of knowledge - that is, the forcing out and supplanting of mistaken and unnecessary knowledge by truer and more necessary knowledge - so the evolution of feelings takes place by means of art, replacing lower feelings, less kind and less needed for the good of humanity, by kinder feelings, more needed for that good. This is the purpose of art.&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], pp. 123-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Christian art ==
Tolstoy's analysis is influenced by his radical Christian views (see ''[[The Kingdom of God is Within You]]''), views which led him to be excommunicated from the Russian Orthodox Church in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;Pevear, Richard (1995). "Preface" in Tolstoy, Leo (1995 [1897]). ''What is Art?'' (Translated by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky ed.). London: Penguin. p, xxii. {{ISBN|9780140446425}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He states that Christian art, rooted in "the consciousness of sonship to God and the brotherhood of men":&lt;ref name="Tolstoy 1995 1897, p. 130"&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;can evoke reverence for each man's dignity, for every animal’s life, it can evoke the shame of luxury, of violence, of revenge, of using for one’s pleasure objects that are a necessity for other people, it can make people sacrifice themselves to serve others freely and joyfully, without noticing it.&lt;ref name="Tolstoy 1995 1897, p. 166"&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ultimately, "by calling up the feelings of brotherhood and love in people under imaginary conditions, religious art will accustom people to experiencing the same feelings in reality under the same conditions".&lt;ref name="Tolstoy 1995 1897, p. 166"/&gt;

Tolstoy's examples: [[Schiller]]'s ''[[The Robbers]]'', [[Victor Hugo]]'s ''[[Les Misérables]]'', [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'' and ''[[The Chimes]]'', [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'', [[Dostoevsky]]'s ''[[The House of the Dead (novel)|The House of the Dead]]'', [[George Eliot]]'s ''[[Adam Bede]]'',&lt;ref name="Tolstoy 1995 1897, p. 132"&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nikolai Ge|Ge's]] Judgement, [[Sándor Liezen-Mayer|Liezen-Mayer's]] Signing the Death Sentence, and paintings "portraying the labouring man with respect and love" such as those by [[Jean-François Millet|Millet]], [[Jules Breton|Breton]], [[Léon Augustin Lhermitte|Lhermitte]], and [[Franz Defregger|Defregger]].&lt;ref name="Tolstoy 1995 1897, p. 133"&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Universal art==

"Universal" art&lt;ref name="Tolstoy 1995 1897, p. 132"/&gt; illustrates that people are "already united in the oneness of life's joys and sorrows"&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; by communicating "feelings of the simplest, most everyday sort, accessible to all people without exception, such as the feelings of merriment, tenderness, cheerfulness, peacefulness, and so on".&lt;ref name="Tolstoy 1995 1897, p. 130"/&gt; Tolstoy contrasts this ideal with art that is partisan in nature, whether it be by class, religion, nation, or style.&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 134, 136, 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tolstoy's examples: he mentions, with many qualifiers, the works of [[Cervantes]], Dickens, [[Moliere]], [[Gogol]], and [[Pushkin]], comparing all of these unfavourably to the story of [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]].&lt;ref name="Tolstoy 1995 1897, p. 133"/&gt;
In music he commends a violin aria of [[Bach]], the [[Nocturnes, Op. 9 (Chopin)|E-flat major nocturne]] of Chopin, and "selected passages" from [[Schubert]], [[Haydn]], Chopin, and [[Mozart]]. He also speaks briefly of [[genre paintings]] and [[Landscape painting|landscapes]].&lt;ref name="Tolstoy 1995 1897, p. 135"&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evaluating style ==

{{Empty section|date=August 2014}}

== Obscurity versus accessibility ==

Tolstoy notes the susceptibility of his contemporaries to the "charm of obscurity".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Works have become laden with "euphemisms, mythological and historical allusions", and general "vagueness, mysteriousness, obscurity and inaccessibility to the masses".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Tolstoy lambastes such works, insisting that art can and should be comprehensible to everyone. Having emphasised that art has a function in the improvement of humanity - capable of expressing man’s best sentiment - he finds it offensive that artists should be so wilfully and arrogantly abstruse.&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 43, 47, 63-84, 123-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artificiality==

One criticism Tolstoy levels against art is that at some point it "ceased to be sincere and became artificial and cerebral",&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the creation of millions of works of technical brilliance but few of honourable sentiment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; Tolstoy outlines four common markers of bad art: these are not however considered the canon or ultimate indicators
# Borrowing
# Imitation
# Effectfulness
# Diversion&lt;ref name="Tolstoy 1995 1897, p. 84"&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Borrowing ===

Involves recycling and concentrating elements from other works,&lt;ref name="Tolstoy 1995 1897, p. 84"/&gt; typical examples of which are: "maidens, warriors, shepherds, hermits, angels, devils in all forms, moonlight, thunderstorms, mountains, the sea, precipices, flowers, long hair, lions, the lamb, the dove, the nightingale".&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Imitation ===

Imitation is highly descriptive realism, where painting becomes photography, or a scene in a book becomes a listing of facial expressions, tone of voice, the setting, and so on.&lt;ref name="Tolstoy 1995 1897, p. 86"&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; Any potential communication of feeling is "disrupted by the superfluity of details".&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effectfulness===

Reliance on "strikingness", often involving contrasts of "horrible and tender, beautiful and ugly, loud and soft, dark and light", descriptions of lust,&lt;ref name="Tolstoy 1995 1897, p. 86"/&gt; "crescendo and complication", unexpected changes in rhythm, tempo, etc.&lt;ref name="Tolstoy 1995 1897, p. 87"&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; Tolstoy contends that works marked by such techniques "do not convey any feeling, but only affect the nerves".&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diversion ===

Diversion is "an intellectual interest added to the work of art", such as the melding of documentary and fiction, as well as the writing of novels, poetry, and music "in such a way that they must be puzzled out".&lt;ref name="Tolstoy 1995 1897, p. 87"/&gt; All such works do not correspond with Tolstoy's view of art as the infection of others with feelings previously experienced,&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; and his exhortation that art be "universal" in appeal.&lt;ref name="Tolstoy 1995 1897, p. 135"/&gt;

== The corruption of art ==

{{Empty section|date=August 2014}}

== Causes ==

=== Church Christianity and the Renaissance ===

Tolstoy approves of early Christian art for being inspired by love of Christ and man, as well as its antagonism to pleasure-seeking. He prefers this to the art born of "Church Christianity", which ostensibly evades the "essential theses of true Christianity" (that is, that all men are born of the Father, are equals, and should strive towards mutual love).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897],  p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Art became pagan—worshipping religious figures—and subservient to the dictates of the Church.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The corruption of art was deepened after the [[Crusades]], as the abuse of papal power became more obvious. The rich began to doubt, seeing contradictions between the actions of the Church and the message of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 45, 147.&lt;/ref&gt; But instead of turning back to the early Christian teachings, the upper classes began to appreciate and commission art that was merely pleasing.&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 46-8.&lt;/ref&gt; This tendency was facilitated by the [[Renaissance]], with the aggrandisement of ancient Greek art, philosophy, and culture which, Tolstoy alleges, is inclined to pleasure and beauty worship.&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], pp. 46-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aesthetic theory ===

Tolstoy perceives the roots of [[aesthetics]] in the Renaissance. Art for pleasure was validated in reference to the philosophy of the Greeks&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Noyes, George (1918). ''Tolstoy''. London: Duffield, p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt; and the elevation of “beauty” as a legitimate criterion with which to separate good from bad art.&lt;ref name="Tolstoy 1995 1897, p. 53"&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tolstoy moves to discredit aesthetics by reviewing and reducing previous theories - including those of [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten|Baumgarten]],&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 17, 30.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kant]],&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], pp. 20-1.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hegel]],&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Schopenhauer]]&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], pp. 24-5.&lt;/ref&gt; - to two main “aesthetic definitions of beauty”:&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; 
# The "objective" or "mystical" definition of beauty&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; in which beauty is "something absolutely perfect which exists outside us",&lt;ref name="Tolstoy 1995 1897, p. 32"&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; whether it be associated with "idea, spirit, will, God"&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
# The "subjective" definition of beauty, in which "beauty is a certain pleasure we experience, which does not have personal advantage as its aim".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This definition tends to be more inclusive, enabling things like food and fabric to be called art&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
Tolstoy then argues that, despite their apparent divergence, there is little substantive difference between the two strands. This is because both schools recognise beauty only by the pleasure it gives: "both notions of beauty come down to a certain sort of pleasure that we receive, meaning that we recognize as beauty that which pleases us without awakening our lust".&lt;ref name="Tolstoy 1995 1897, p. 32"/&gt; Therefore, there is no objective definition of art in aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tolstoy condemns the focus on beauty/pleasure at length, calling aesthetics a discipline:

&lt;blockquote&gt;according to which the difference between good art, conveying good feelings, and bad art, conveying wicked feelings, was totally obliterated, and one of the lowest manifestations of art, art for mere pleasure - against which all teachers of mankind have warned people - came to be regarded as the highest art. And art became, not the important thing it was intended to be, but the empty amusement of idle people.&lt;ref name="Tolstoy 1995 1897, p. 53"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Professionalism ===

Tolstoy sees the developing professionalism of art as hampering the creation of good works. 
 
The professional artist can and must create to prosper, making for art that is insincere and most likely partisan - made to suit the whims of fashion or [[patrons]].&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], pp. 93-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Art criticism is a symptom of the obscurity of art, for "[a]n artist, if he is a true artist, has in his work conveyed to others the feelings he has experienced: what is there to explain?".&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism, moreover, tends to contribute to the veneration of "authorities"&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Shakespeare]] and [[Dante]].&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; By constant unfavourable comparison, the young artist is corralled into imitating the works of the greats, as all of them are said to be true art. In short, new artists imitate the classics, setting their own feelings aside, which, according to Tolstoy, is contrary to the point of art.&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], pp. 95-6, 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

Art schools teach people how to imitate the method of the masters, but they cannot teach the sincerity of emotion that is the propellant of great works.&lt;ref name="Tolstoy 1995 1897, p. 98"&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; In Tolstoy's words, "[n]o school can call up feelings in a man, and still less can it teach a man what is the essence of art: the manifestation of feeling in his own particular fashion".&lt;ref name="Tolstoy 1995 1897, p. 98"/&gt;

== Consequences ==

# "[T]he enormous waste of working people's labour",&lt;ref name="Tolstoy 1995 1897, p. 139"&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; with individuals spending so much time contemplating and creating bad art that they become "incapable of anything that is really necessary for people"&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The volume of art produced provides "the amusement which turns these people's eyes from the meaninglessness of their lives and saves them from the boredom that oppresses them", it enables them "to go on living without noticing the meaninglessness and cruelty of their life"&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The confusion and perversion of values. It becomes normal to worship not great religious figures but people who write incomprehensible poems&lt;ref name="Tolstoy 1995 1897, p. 143"&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The worship of beauty legitimises the disregarding of morality as a criterion for evaluating cultural products&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Modern art "direct corrupts people" by infecting them with feelings of superstition, patriotism, and sensuality&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of famous artists==

Throughout the book Tolstoy demonstrates a willingness to dismiss generally accepted masters, among them [[Liszt]], [[Richard Strauss]],&lt;ref name="Tolstoy 1995 1897, p. 139"/&gt; [[Nietzsche]],&lt;ref name="Tolstoy 1995 1897, p. 143"/&gt; and [[Oscar Wilde]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He also labels his own works as "bad art", excepting only the short stories "[[God Sees the Truth, But Waits|God Sees the Truth]]" and "Prisoner of the Caucasus".&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], pp. 197-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

He attempts to justify these conclusions by pointing to the ostensible chaos of previous aesthetic analysis. Theories usually involve selecting popular works and constructing principles from these examples. Volkelt, for instance, remarks that art cannot be judged on its moral content because then ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' would not be good art. Such retrospective justification cannot, he stresses, be the basis for theory, as people will tend to create subjective frameworks to justify their own tastes.&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 33-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

Jahn notes the "often confusing use of categorisation"&lt;ref&gt;Jahn 1975, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; and the lack of definition of the key concept of emotion.&lt;ref&gt;Jahn 1975, pp. 61-2&lt;/ref&gt; Bayley writes that "the effectiveness of ''What is Art?'' lies not so much in its positive assertions as in its rejection of much that was taken for granted in the aesthetic theories of the time".&lt;ref&gt;Bayley, John (1986 [1966]). ''What is Art?'' - excerpt from ''Tolstoy and the Novel'' in Bloom, Harold (ed.). ''Leo Tolstoy''. New York: Chelsea House. p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; Noyes criticises Tolstoy's dismissal of beauty,&lt;ref&gt;Noyes 1918, p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt; but states that, "despite its shortcomings", ''What is Art?'' "may be pronounced the most stimulating critical work of our time".&lt;ref&gt;Noyes 1918, p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt; Simmons mentions the "occasional brilliant passages" along with the "repetition, awkward language, and loose terminology".&lt;ref&gt;Simmons 1973, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aylmer Maude]], translator of many of Tolstoy's writings, calls it "probably the most masterly of all Tolstoy's works", citing the difficulty of the subject matter and its clarity.&lt;ref&gt;Maude, Aylmer (1901''a''). "''What is Art?'' - An Introduction", in Tolstoy and his problems: essays. London: Grant Richards. p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; For a comprehensive review of the reception at the time of publication, see Maude 1901''b''.&lt;ref&gt;Maude, Aylmer (1901''b'').
