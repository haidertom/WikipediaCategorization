      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8007">An '''aggregate project plan''' (APP) is the process of creating development goals and objectives and using these goals and objectives to improve productivity as well as development capabilities.  The purpose of this process is generally to ensure that each project will accomplish its development goals and objectives. Projects can be differentiated into five types of projects: breakthrough, platform, derivative, [[R&amp;D]], or partnered projects (such as projects performed with partners or [[allianced firms]]). This differentiation determines a project's development goals and objectives as well as resources allocated to that project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

An aggregate project plan provides [[management]] with a categorized list of projects, which balances short- and long-term goals. This list assists management in making difficult decisions such as when to start projects and which projects should be cannibalized. Starting projects in a sequential manner according to the firm's strategy as well as resources available will allow fewer projects to continue simultaneously and improve productivity.
Another benefit is the creation of an organizational form for each project type. This creates a focus on the generation of competence and builds the speed and productivity of individuals as well as the organization itself.&lt;ref&gt;

== Aggregate project planning process ==
This is the process a firm undergoes to create an aggregate project plan: &lt;br /&gt;
:1.	Create a well-defined and easily understood strategy.
:2.	Relay the strategy with the aim of developing new products, processes, or services and improving efficiency of current projects.
:3.	Establish clear definitions of each type of project: breakthrough, platform, derivative, R&amp;D, or partnered projects.
:4.	List current projects and classify each by project type.
:5.	Eliminate projects that don’t fit within a project type.
:6.	Estimate the average time and resources needed for each project type based on past experience.
:7.	Determine the desired mix of projects.
:8.	Identify existing resources and estimate the number of projects those resources can support.
:9.	Decide which projects to pursue and eliminate the rest.
:10.	Allocate resources to remaining projects and work to improve development capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;

==Five categories of development projects==

=== Derivative projects ===
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;
Derivative projects can vary from additions or augmentations to existing products or simple price reductions over time. &lt;i&gt; Improvement work on derivative projects falls into three categories, incremental product changes, incremental process changes, and incremental changes in both sectors.&lt;/i&gt;  Due to these minor changes, derivative projects require trivial effort &amp; resources on both development and management.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
''Examples: special edition [[Paint sealant|car paint]] and [[iPod]] [[hard drive]] size updates''&lt;br/&gt;
Many organizations make derivative products, which can range from special editions of existing cars, adding nothing more than a special paint scheme and interior or a new iPod with a large hard drive.

===Platform projects===
&lt;br/&gt;
These projects are the next generation of products for the company.  These are major changes from existing products/services or the way the product/service is made or delivered. These create a new ‘platform‘ for growth in the future.  These projects offer significant improvements in cost, quality, and performance.  Platforms are created to meet the needs of a [[Core (group)|core group]] of customers changing more than one aspect of a product or service; while derivatives normally only change one aspect of a product or service.&lt;br/&gt;
''Examples: new [[car model]]s. [[Microprocessor]]''&lt;br/&gt; 
New car models have major changes in a number of areas which include manufacturing and product changes when they are released creating a platform for the car company.  A new microprocessor with changes in speed, size, and capabilities, while having a new process to create them, adds a new platform for the company.

===Breakthrough Projects===
&lt;br/&gt;
These projects are the highest risk and the highest reward category.  These involve the newest technology greater than that of a platform project.  This use of this technology may be ‘disruptive’ to the rest of the [[industry]] and create an entirely new product category to define the industry.  This may be a brand new technology or significant changes to existing projects.  These types of projects often incorporate new and innovative manufacturing or servicing processes. These types of projects should be given leeway to work outside of normal and existing operating techniques.&lt;br/&gt;
''Examples: [[Optical fiber|fiber optic]] data transfer, [[hybrid car]]s''&lt;br/&gt;
Fiber optic data transfer cables revolutionized the industry of data transfer. This new technology was a breakthrough in the industry with lines of [[dark fiber]] laid though many major cities. Hybrid cars are the first types of cars not to rely solely on the use of fossil fuels.

===Research &amp; Development===
&lt;br/&gt;
The invention of knowledge of new materials and technologies that will be used in commercial development.  R&amp;D projects are high risk endeavors with a possibility of high returns.  Research &amp; development is important since it will always occur before product and process development.  R&amp;D projects also use the same resources as commercial development and will always compete for them.  Every organization has different expectations for R&amp;D projects due to its high possibility of failure.  &lt;br/&gt;
''Example: [[3D Television]]''&lt;br/&gt;
An example of a R&amp;D project would be a Television company attempting to develop a new, 3D viewing system for consumers.  This would require extensive research &amp; development that would have a high up-front cost and possible return with a large risk of failure.

===Partnered projects===
&lt;br/&gt;
These projects can fall under any of the other four categories. However, these projects can often be overlooked while mapping the aggregate project plan.  These plans are important and their resource usage should be included in planning.&lt;br/&gt;
''Example: [[Pepsi]] and [[Starbucks]]''&lt;br/&gt;
Starbucks has an agreement that Pepsi will bottle their beverages they sell in retail sources. This is a partnership between both companies that neither can ignore and the resources should be accounted for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Bonny Gas Transport''' or '''Bonny Gas Transport Bermuda Shell''' is a subsidiary of [[Nigeria LNG]] or NLNG which itself is a [[joint-venture]] of [[Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation]] (NNPC), [[Royal Dutch Shell]], [[Total S.A.]] and [[Eni]]. It owns and operates a number of [[Liquefied natural gas|LNG]] tankers.&lt;ref name="manage"&gt;Helderline website with overview of ships operated by [http://www.helderline.nl/managers/3/bonny+gas+transport+bermuda++shell/ BGT Bermuda Shell], visited 21 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==The company==
BGT was established in [[Bermuda]] in 1989 by the NLNG holding-company. It takes care of the transportation of the produce of this company. LNG is found in the fields on [[Bonny Island]] in the [[Niger Delta]] in [[Nigeria]] by the NNPC and then sold to Shell, Total and ENI. In 2005 the bulk of this gas goes to Europe and about 2% to Northern-America. The completion of Train 6 in 2008 increased the output of the Bonny Island fields, and of this new output approximately 50% goes to Europe and the other 50% to North-America.&lt;ref name="banks"&gt;LNGPedia [http://www.lngpedia.com/wp-content/uploads/lng_project_financing_funding/Bonny%20Gas%20Transport,%20a%20US680%20Millions%20LNG%20Ship%20Refinancing%20-%20Ben%20Gobey.pdf Refinancing of BGT], 2006, Ben Cobley. Retrieved: 21 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ownership===
As it is a 100% daughter of NLNG the ownership of BGT is the same as that of NNLNG and thus:
:NNPC = 49%
:Shell = 25,6%
:Total = 15%
:ENI = 10,4%

===Financing===
The income of BGT comes from long-term charters of their ships to NLNG: BGT's activities are limited to charter ships to NLNG and all gas found at the fields in the Bonny Island project by NNPC is sold to the above companies and the transport over the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to Europe or America is done via BGT ships.

Until 2006 BGT had a range of different (bank)loans to finance the buying and updating the LNG tankers. On October 2006 a deal was made with a consortium of banks to re-finance US$ 680 million. The original loans were related to 9 ships; this new deal also included the room to extend the fleet to the current 13 ships: in the years following the completion of this deal the output of the Bonny gas fields was expected and it was foreseen that additional shipping-capacity was required (see also the main-article on [[Nigeria LNG]]).

Because the gas and oil projects in the [[Niger Delta]], including [[Bonny Island]], are seen as high-risk investments, the financing of the ships to transport any produce from the area, are done via a separate company (BGT): even when the worst come to the worst and there would be no gas to be transported from the area the ships can be used anywhere in the world; thus financing the ships was seen as lower risk then financing the mother company itself.&lt;ref name="banks"/&gt;

In January 2012 NNPC said that they were trying to raise [[United States dollar|US $]] 1 billion to renew the fleet of their daughter-company BGT&lt;ref&gt;Bloomberg website: [https://archive.is/20120903192847/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-01-30/nigeria-lng-in-talks-for-1-billion-funding-for-shipping-unit.html Nigeria LNG in Talks for $1 Billion Funding for Shipping Unit], 30 January 2012. Visited: 21 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
BGT was set up by Nigeria NLG to transport all LNG gas produced by its mother company in [[Nigeria]] to the customers in [[North America]] and [[Europe]].&lt;ref name="banks"/&gt;

==Fleet==
The website Helderline provides an overview of 13 of these ships.&lt;ref name="manage"/&gt; All ships that are managed by BGT also sail for BGT&lt;ref name="sail"&gt;Helderline website with overview of ships sailing for [http://www.helderline.nl/status/12/sailing+for+bonny+gas+transport/ BGT Bermuda Shell], visited 21 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first Carrefour shop (not a hypermarket) opened in 1960, within suburban [[Annecy]] near a crossroads. The group was created in 1958 by [[Marcel Fournier]], [[Denis Defforey]] and [[Jacques Defforey]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.carrefour.com/content/history&lt;/ref&gt; who attended and were influenced by several seminars in the United States led by "the Pope of retail" [[Bernardo Trujillo]].

The Carrefour group was the first in Europe to open a hypermarket, a large supermarket and a [[department store]] under the same roof. They opened their first hypermarket on 15 June 1963 in [[Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois, Essonne|Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois]], near Paris in France.&lt;ref name="aventure"&gt;{{fr icon}} Hugues Joublin, ''[https://lexpansion.lexpress.fr/actualite-economique/l-aventure-du-premier-hyper_1395461.html L'aventure du premier hyper]'', L'Expansion, 06/05/1993&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Carrefour.png|thumb|250px|Carrefour's trading logo]] --&gt;

In April 1976, Carrefour launched a [[private label]] ''Produits libres'' (free products – ''libre'' meaning ''free'' [[gratis versus libre|in the sense of liberty as opposed to ''gratis'']]) line of fifty foodstuffs, including oil, biscuits (crackers and cookies), milk, and pasta, sold in unbranded white packages at substantially lower prices.

The Carrefour Foundation (''Fondation d'Enterprise Carrefour'') is a philanthropic fund created by Carrefour in 2000 to support social welfare programmes 'linked to [its] core business as a retailer' in countries the company operates and in countries where its suppliers are located.&lt;ref&gt;Carrefour Foundation http://www.fondation-carrefour.org/content/our-missions, accessed 6 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and controversies==

On 1 May 2007, more than 30 employees of the now closed Carrefour Ratu Plaza, [[Jakarta]], Indonesia, were taken to the Central Pertamina Hospital (''Rumah Sakit Pusat Pertamina''), after being affected by CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The hypermarket was located on the mall's basement, which offered insufficient ventilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.detiknews.com/index.php/detik.read/tahun/2007/bulan/05/tgl/01/time/212433/idnews/774875/idkanal/10 |title=Puluhan Karyawan Carrefour Ratu Plaza Keracunan CO2 |publisher=detikNews |date=15 April 2011 |accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 June 2007, the company was convicted in a French court for false advertising. The suit alleged that Carrefour regularly stocked insufficient quantities of advertised products for sale. In addition, the company was convicted of selling products below cost and accepting kickbacks from wholesalers. Carrefour was ordered to pay a fine of €2&amp;nbsp;million and to prominently and legibly display a notice in all of its French stores disclosing the false advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=lefigaro.fr |url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/actubourse/20070626.WWW000000449_carrefour_rappele_a_lordre_par_le_tribunal_devry.html |title=(French) Carrefour condamné pour publicité mensongère |work=Le Figaro |language=French |location=France |accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Carrefour Mangga Dua Square, [[Jakarta]], Indonesia, a 5-metre high metal rack fell on top of a 3-year-old boy, killing him almost instantly due to internal bleeding.{{When|date=January 2012}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.detiknews.com/index.php/detik.read/tahun/2007/bulan/04/tgl/09/time/193426/idnews/764856/idkanal/10 |title=A 3-year old boy died when a metal rack fell onto him |publisher=Detiknews.com |date=15 April 2011 |accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, the victim's family claimed that Carrefour has refused to meet with them to settle the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.detiknews.com/index.php/detik.read/tahun/2007/bulan/04/tgl/09/time/205055/idnews/764873/idkanal/10 |title=Victims Family is Refused to Meet Carrefour Officials |publisher=Detiknews.com |date=15 April 2011 |accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Carrefour Corporate Affairs Officer denied this allegation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.detiknews.com/index.php/detik.read/tahun/2007/bulan/04/tgl/10/time/112919/idnews/765096/idkanal/10 |title=Carrefour Officials deny refusing victim's family |publisher=Detiknews.com |date=15 April 2011 |accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carrefour has also received criticism for engaging in [[sweatshop]] practices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peuples-solidaires.org/article618.html Bangladesh – Carrefour has to do better] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929154004/http://www.peuples-solidaires.org/article618.html |date=29 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 May 2009, the French government asked a tribunal to fine Carrefour some €220,000 for more than 2,500 violations. Meat products lacked proper tracking information (more than 25% of inventory at some locations), and some products had incorrect labels – such as meat products that "shrank" in weight by 15% after receiving labels. The chain sold products that had long since passed their expiration dates, including, in one case, packs of baby formula that had expired six months earlier. Some 1,625 frozen and refrigerated products were found that had been stored in warehouses at ambient temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leparisien.fr/economie/carrefour-risque-de-payer-220-000-eur-d-amende-08-05-2009-505476.php |title=(French) Carrefour risque de payer 220.000€ d'amende |publisher=Leparisien.fr |accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boycott of supplies in China===
[[File:Photo0196.jpg|left|thumb|A Carrefour outlet in Beijing, China, promotes the use of canvas bags as opposed to [[plastic bags]] prior to the [[2008 Summer Olympics]].]]
In April 2008, after the [[2008 Summer Olympics torch relay|2008 Olympic torch relay]] was disrupted by [[Tibetan independence]] advocates in London and especially Paris, where some protesters attempted to wrest control of the torch from torch bearers, Chinese activists have promoted boycotting Carrefour because of its French roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7347918.stm |title=Carrefour faces China boycott bid |publisher=BBC News |date=15 April 2008 |accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boycott of Carrefour in particular was further fueled by unsubstantiated rumours that a major shareholder, [[LVMH|Moët Hennessy – Louis Vuitton]], had donated to the [[Dalai Lama]]. In its response, Carrefour China stated that it does support the [[2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing Olympics]]; and that they will never do anything to harm the feelings of the [[Chinese people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carrefour.com.cn/note/note.html |title=家乐福中国对近日出现的一些不实传闻的声明 |publisher=Carrefour.com.cn |accessdate=19 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707014338/http://www.carrefour.com.cn/note/note.html |archivedate=7 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Protests occurred in and around a number of Carrefour outlets throughout China, and anti-Carrefour advocates campaigned for a one-day boycott of Carrefour on May Day, a public holiday in China.

As a result of the boycott, Chinese search engines [[Baidu]].com.cn and [[sina.com]] [[Internet censorship in China|blocked access]] to Carrefour's website in China for a short time. Users searching Carrefour in China, were sent an error page indicating "The search result may contain illegal content, so we can not display the result." in Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinatechnews.com/2008/04/30/6693-carrefour-removed-from-chinese-internet/#more-6693 |title=Chinanews.com article dated April&amp;nbsp;30, 2008 |publisher=Chinatechnews.com |date=30 April 2008 |accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slavery in Thailand===
In 2014, the ''[[the Guardian|Guardian]]'' reported, that Carrefour is a client of [[Charoen Pokphand Foods]]. During 6 months the ''Guardian'' traced down the whole chain from slave ships in Asian waters to leading producers and retailers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/jun/10/supermarket-prawns-thailand-produced-slave-labour|title=Revealed: Asian slave labour producing prawns for supermarkets in US, UK|last=Hodal|first=Kate|author2=Chris Kelly |author3=Felicity Lawrence |date=2014-06-10|publisher=The Guardian|quote= Charoen Pokphand (CP) Foods, buys fishmeal, which it feeds to its farmed prawns, from some suppliers that own, operate or buy from fishing boats manned with slaves. ...

'''Charles Saatchi ''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɑː|tʃ|iː}}; {{lang-ar|تشارلز ساعتجي}}; born 9 June 1943) is an Iraqi-British Jewish businessman and the co-founder with his brother [[Maurice Saatchi, Baron Saatchi|Maurice]] of advertising agency [[Saatchi &amp; Saatchi]].  The brothers led the business – the world's largest [[advertising agency]] in the 1980s – until they were forced out in 1995. In the same year, the brothers formed a new agency called [[M&amp;C Saatchi]]. 

Saatchi is also known for his art collection and for owning [[Saatchi Gallery]], and in particular for his sponsorship of the [[Young British Artists]] (YBAs), including [[Damien Hirst]] and [[Tracey Emin]].

==Early life==
Charles Saatchi is the second of four sons born to [[Nathan Saatchi]] and Daisy Ezer, a wealthy [[Iraqi Jewish]] family in [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]]. The name "[[Saatchi (disambiguation)|Saatchi]]" saatçi (''sā'ātchi''), which means "watchmaker", originates from Turkish. &lt;!--''saatçi'') ← What is this bit for? --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Alkalesi |first=Yasin M. |chapter=Nouns of Occupations with Suffixes -chi and -chiyya |title=Modern Iraqi Arabic: A Textbook |publisher=Georgetown University Press |date=October 2006 |isbn=978-1-58901-130-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saatchi's brothers are David (born 1937), [[Maurice Saatchi|Maurice]] (born 1946) and Philip (born 1953).&lt;ref name="Goldman - Conflicting Accounts"&gt;Goldman – Conflicting Accounts&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1947 his father, a textile merchant, anticipated the flight that tens of thousands of Iraqi Jews would soon make to avoid persecution and relocated his family to [[Finchley]], north London.&lt;ref name=times2009&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/visual_arts/article5817312.ece|title=The Saturday interview: Charles Saatchi|last=Thomson|first=Alice |author2=[[Rachel Sylvester]] |date=28 February 2009|publisher=Times Online|accessdate=24 November 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc2002"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/uk/2000/newsmakers/2124645.stm|title=Charles Saatchi: Artful adman|last=Jones|first=Chris |date=12 July 2002|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=24 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nathan Saatchi purchased two textile mills in north London and after a time rebuilt a thriving business. Eventually the family would settle into an eight-bedroom house in Hampstead Lane, [[Highgate]].&lt;ref name="Goldman - Conflicting Accounts"/&gt;

Saatchi attended [[Christ's College (Finchley)|Christ's College]], a grammar school in Finchley, north London.&lt;ref name=times2009/&gt; During this time, he developed an obsession with US [[popular culture|pop culture]], including the music of [[Elvis Presley]], [[Little Richard]] and [[Chuck Berry]].  He has described as "life-changing" the experience of viewing a [[Jackson Pollock]] painting at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York. He then progressed to study at the [[London College of Communication]].&lt;ref name="telegraph2001"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4730049/Adventures-in-Saatchiland.html|title=Adventures in Saatchiland|last=Gleadell |first=Colin |date=31 December 2001|publisher=Telegraph|accessdate=25 November 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advertising career==

===Early career===
In 1965, Saatchi undertook his first advertising role as a copywriter in the London office of [[Benton &amp; Bowles]], where he met Doris Lockhart (later his first wife).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Darwent |first=Charles |date=17 October 1998 |title=Pieces From a Confessional |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/pieces-from-a-confessional-1179187.html |access-date=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saatchi paired up with [[art director]] Ross Cramer and they worked as a team at [[Collett Dickenson Pearce]] and John Collins &amp; Partners before leaving in 1967 to open creative consultancy Cramer Saatchi.&lt;ref name=Adland2007&gt;{{cite book |last=Tungate |first=Mark |date=2007 |title=Adland: A Global History of Advertising |publisher=Kogan Page Publishers |page=94|isbn=0749464313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unusually for a creative consultancy, they took on employees: [[Bartle Bogle Hegarty|John Hegarty]]  – previously Saatchi's art director at Benton &amp; Bowles, who would later go on to run rival agency [[Bartle Bogle Hegarty]] – and [[Jeremy Sinclair]], who as of 2016 still retains a senior role at M&amp;C Saatchi.&lt;ref name=Adland2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=VG2005&gt;{{cite book |last=Pasiuk |first=Laurie |date=2005 |title=Vault Guide to the Top Advertising &amp; PR Employers |publisher=Vault Inc |page=135 |isbn=1581313837}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to offering consulting with ad agencies they also took on some clients directly.

===Saatchi and Saatchi===

===M&amp;C Saatchi===
At the turn of 1995, Saatchi and his brother left the agency, and together founded the rival M&amp;C Saatchi agency, taking with them many of their management and creative staff, as well as a number of clients – including [[British Airways]].&lt;ref name="bbc2002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=4 January 1996 |title=British Airways head praises Maurice Saatchi |newspaper=Reuters |location= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art==
[[File:SaatchiGallery.jpg|thumb|The Saatchi Gallery's new premises in Chelsea, which opened in October 2008.]]
In 1969, at age 26, Saatchi purchased his first work of art by [[Sol LeWitt]], a New York minimalist. Saatchi initially patronised the [[Lisson Gallery]] in Marylebone, London, which specialised in American minimalist works. He later purchased an entire show by [[Robert Mangold]].

In the early 1980s, Saatchi purchased a {{convert|30000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} cement-floored and steel-girded warehouse at 98A Boundary Road in the residential London suburb of [[St. John's Wood]]. The building was transformed by architect Max Gordon into the [[Saatchi Gallery]], which was subsequently opened to the public in February 1985 to exhibit the art Saatchi had collected.&lt;ref name="britannica" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc2002" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Frascina|first=Francis |date=June 2013 |title=Thatcher's Legacy |journal= Art Monthly|volume= 367|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Goldman|first= K|date=1997 |title= Conflicting Accounts: The Creation and Crash of the Saatchi and Saatchi Advertising Empire |location=New York |publisher= Touchstone|page= 149|isbn=0684815710}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At one point the Saatchi collection contained 11 works by [[Donald Judd]], 21 by [[Sol LeWitt]], 23 by [[Anselm Kiefer]], 17 [[Andy Warhol]]s and 27 by [[Julian Schnabel]].

His taste has mutated from American abstraction and minimalism to the [[Young British Artists]] (YBAs), whose work he first saw at Goldsmith's Art School. At the YBAs' 1990 [[East Country Yard Show|''Gambler'']] exhibition, Saatchi bought [[Damian Hirst]]'s first major 'animal' installation, ''A Thousand Years''.&lt;ref name=Adland2007/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Anderson |first=Jamie |date=2010 |title=The Fine Art of Success: How Learning Great Art Can Create Great Business |publisher=Wiley |page= |isbn=978-0-470-66106-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, he acquired major artworks by Hirst and [[Marc Quinn]], becoming instrumental in launching their careers. His renown as a patron peaked in 1997, when part of his collection was shown at the [[Royal Academy]] as the exhibition ''[[Sensation exhibition|Sensation]]'', which travelled to Berlin and New York causing headlines and some offence (for example, to the families of children murdered by [[Myra Hindley]], who was portrayed in one of the works), and consolidating the position of Hirst, [[Tracey Emin|Emin]] and other YBAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kino |first=Carol |date=22 October 1995 |title=Art; Not One Drop of British Reserve |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/22/arts/art-not-one-drop-of-british-reserve.html |newspaper= The New York Times|location= |access-date=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, he published the book ''My Name Is Charles Saatchi And I Am An Artoholic''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|0-7148-5747-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subtitled "Everything You Need To Know About Art, Ads, Life, God And Other Mysteries And Weren't Afraid To Ask", it presents Saatchi's answers to a number of questions submitted by members of the public and journalists.

From November to December 2009, he had a television programme on the [[BBC]] called ''[[School of Saatchi]]'' in which he gave young aspiring artists an opportunity to showcase their work. He made no appearance in the programme, only communicating through an assistant.

In July 2010, Charles Saatchi announced he would be donating the Saatchi Gallery and over 200 works of art to the British public.&lt;ref&gt;Hewage, Tim.

The Saatchi Gallery featured in a list of the most visited art museums in the world, based on an attendance survey for 2014, compiled by ''The Art Newspaper,''  with 1,505,608 visitors. In the same survey, the gallery was shown to have hosted 15 of the 20 most visited exhibitions in London over the last 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.museus.gov.br/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/TheArtNewspaper_Ranking2014.pdf|title = Instituto Brasileiro de Museus|last = |first = |date = 14 January 2016|work = Instituto Brasileiro de Museus|access-date = 14 January 2016|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He and his brother founded an independent [[Orthodox Jewish|Jewish]] synagogue, named [[Saatchi Shul]] in [[Maida Vale]], London, England, in 1998, in honour of their parents.&lt;ref name=NYT1999/&gt;

In December 1998, Saatchi donated 130 artworks to a [[Christie's]] auction that raised £1.7&amp;nbsp;million, creating scholarship bursaries at four London art schools.&lt;ref name=NYT1999/&gt;

He has donated over 100 works to the [[Tate]] Gallery, Art for Hospitals and the Arts Council.

==Personal life==
According to the ''[[Times Online]]'', Saatchi is "reclusive", even hiding from clients when they visited his agency's offices and, as of February 2009, has only ever granted two newspaper interviews.&lt;ref name=times2009/&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph2002"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.saatchi-gallery.co.uk/charlesqa/qa.htm|title=Readers' questions|publisher=The Sunday Telegraph|accessdate=24 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He does not attend his own exhibition openings; when asked why by the ''[[Sunday Telegraph]]'', he replied: "I don't go to other people's openings, so I extend the same courtesy to my own."&lt;ref name="telegraph2002"/&gt;

In ''[[Sunday Times Rich List 2009|The Sunday Times Rich List]]'' ranking of the wealthiest people in the UK, he was grouped with his brother Maurice, with an estimated joint fortune of £120&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/richlist-app/index.php?pageID=19|title=Rich List 2009|year=2009|publisher=Times Online|accessdate=26 November 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriages===
Saatchi first met Doris Lockhart Dibley (as she was then known) in 1965 when she was a copy group head above him at Benton &amp; Bowles.&lt;ref name="Goldman - Conflicting Accounts"/&gt; She was a native of [[Memphis, Tennessee]], USA&lt;ref name="pieces-from-a-confessional" /&gt; and Kevin Goldman describes her as "a sophisticated woman who spoke several languages, knew a great deal about art and wine and who had graduated from [[Smith College]] and the [[Sorbonne]]".&lt;ref name="Goldman - Conflicting Accounts"/&gt; She became known during their marriage as an art and design journalist, with particular knowledge of American art and [[minimalism]]. They lived together for six years&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, p.39&lt;/ref&gt; before getting married in 1973 and divorcing in 1990.&lt;ref name="pieces-from-a-confessional"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/pieces-from-a-confessional-1179187.html|title=Pieces from a confessional|last=Darwent |first=Charles |date=18 October 1998|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=24 November 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of non-legal obligations, '''collateral assurance''' is a [[Surety bond|bond]] made over and beyond the [[deed]] itself, for the performance of an agreement, or [[Covenant (law)|covenant]], made between two individuals; so called, for being external, and without the nature and essence of a covenant.  A collateral assurance is separate but subservient to the principal contract.  It usually allows for damages to be paid when the assurance is broken without allowing the principal agreement to be voided.  [[Warranties]] are examples of this sort of assurance.

[[File:New McDonald's restaurant in Mount Pleasant, Iowa.jpg|thumb|upright=0.95|[[McDonald's|McDonald's Corporation]] is one of the most recognizable corporations in the world.]]

A '''corporation''' is a [[company]], a group of people or an organization authorized to act as a single entity ([[legal person|legally a person]]) and recognized as such in law. Early incorporated entities were established by [[charter]] (i.e. by an ''ad hoc'' act granted by a monarch or passed by a parliament or legislature). Most jurisdictions now allow the creation of new corporations through [[List of company registers|registration]].  Corporations enjoy limited liability for their investors, which can lead to losses being externalized from investors to the government or general public.&lt;ref name="Known"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Limited Liability and the Known Unknown|journal=Social Science Research Network|date=2018|url=https://ssrn.com/abstract=3121519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corporations come in many different types but are usually divided by the law of the jurisdiction where they are chartered into two kinds: by whether they can issue [[stock]] or not, or by whether they are formed to make a [[profit (accounting)|profit]] or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.corpnet.com/types-of-corporations/#gfp|title=Types Of Corporations {{!}} Incorporate A Business|website=www.corpnet.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corporations can be divided by the number of owners: corporation aggregate or [[corporation sole | corporation sole]]. The subject of this article is a corporation aggregate. A corporation sole is a legal entity consisting of a single ("sole") incorporated office, occupied by a single ("sole") [[natural person | natural person]].

Where local law distinguishes corporations by the ability to issue stock, corporations allowed to do so are referred to as "stock corporations", ownership of the corporation is through stock, and owners of stock are referred to as "stockholders" or "shareholders". Corporations not allowed to issue stock are referred to as "non-stock" corporations; those who are considered the owners of a non-stock corporation are persons (or other entities) who have obtained membership in the corporation and are referred to as a "member" of the corporation.

Corporations chartered in regions where they are distinguished by whether they are allowed to be for profit or not are referred to as "for profit" and "not-for-profit" corporations, respectively.

There is some overlap between stock/non-stock and for-profit/not-for-profit in that not-for-profit corporations are always non-stock as well. A for-profit corporation is almost always a stock corporation, but some for-profit corporations may choose to be non-stock&lt;!-- non-stock --&gt;. To simplify the explanation, whenever "[[Shareholder|Stockholder]]" or "[[shareholder]]" is used in the rest of this article to refer to a stock corporation, it is presumed to mean the same as "member" for a non-profit corporation or for a profit, non-stock corporation.

Registered corporations have [[legal personality]] and their shares are owned by shareholders&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Company Law |last1=Pettet |first1=B. G. |publisher=Pearson Education |year=2005 |page=151 |quote=Reading the above, makes it possible to forget that the shareholders are the ''owners'' of the company.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Law of Private Companies |first1=Thomas B. |last1=Courtney |publisher=Bloomsbury Professional |year=2002 |edition=2nd |at=4.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose liability is generally [[limited liability|limited]] to their investment.  Shareholders do not typically actively manage a corporation; shareholders instead elect or appoint a [[board of directors]] to control the corporation in a [[fiduciary]] capacity.  In most circumstances, a shareholder may also serve as a director or officer of a corporation.

In [[American English]], the word ''corporation'' is most often used to describe large [[Corporate law|business corporations]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/american/corporation corporation]. CollinsDictionary.com. Collins English Dictionary – Complete &amp; Unabridged 11th Edition. Retrieved December 07, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[British English]] and in the [[Commonwealth countries]], the term ''company'' is more widely used to describe the same sort of entity while the word ''corporation'' encompasses all incorporated entities. In American English, the word ''company'' can include entities such as [[partnership]]s that would not be referred to as companies in British English as they are not a [[separate legal entity]].

Late in the 19th century, a new form of company having the limited liability protections of a corporation, and the more favorable tax treatment of either a sole proprietorship or partnership was developed. While not a corporation, this new type of entity became very attractive as an alternative for corporations not needing to issue stock. In Germany, the organization was referred to as ''[[Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung]]'' or ''GmbH''. In the last quarter of the 20th Century this new form of non-corporate organization became available in the United States and other countries, and was known as the ''[[limited liability company]]'' or ''LLC''. Since the GmbH and LLC forms of organization are technically not corporations (even though they have many of the same features), they will not be discussed in this article.

==History==
{{see also|List of oldest companies}}
[[File: Stora Kopparberg 1288.jpg|thumb|1/8 share of the [[Falun Mine|Stora Kopparberg]] mine, dated June 16, 1288.]]
The word "corporation" derives from ''corpus'', the [[Latin]] word for body, or a "body of people". By the time of [[Justinian I|Justinian]] (reigned 527–565), [[Roman law]] recognized a range of corporate entities under the names ''universitas'', ''corpus'' or ''collegium''. These included the state itself (the ''Populus Romanus''), municipalities, and such private associations as sponsors of a [[Cult (religious practice)|religious cult]], [[Burial society|burial clubs]], political groups, and guilds of craftsmen or traders. Such bodies commonly had the right to own property and make contracts, to receive gifts and legacies, to sue and be sued, and, in general, to perform legal acts through representatives. Private associations were granted designated privileges and liberties by the emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Joseph Berman, ''Law and Revolution'' (vol. 1)'': The Formation of the Western Legal Tradition'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1983, pp. 215–16. {{ISBN|0674517768}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entities which carried on business and were the subjects of legal rights were found in [[ancient Rome]], and the [[Maurya Empire]] in ancient India.&lt;ref&gt;Vikramaditya S. Khanna (2005). [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id= ''The Economic History of the Corporate Form in Ancient India.''] [[University of Michigan]].&lt;/ref&gt; In medieval Europe, churches became incorporated, as did local governments, such as the [[Pope]] and the [[City of London Corporation]]. The point was that the incorporation would survive longer than the lives of any particular member, existing in perpetuity. The alleged oldest commercial corporation in the world, the [[Falun Mine|Stora Kopparberg]] mining community in [[Falun]], [[Sweden]], obtained a [[charter]] from King [[Magnus IV of Sweden|Magnus Eriksson]] in 1347.

In medieval times, traders would do business through [[common law]] constructs, such as [[partnership]]s. Whenever people acted together with a view to profit, the law deemed that a partnership arose. Early [[guild]]s and [[Livery company|livery companies]] were also often involved in the [[restraint of trade|regulation of competition]] between traders.

[[File:Vereinigte Ostindische Compagnie bond.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|A [[bond (finance)|bond]] issued by the Dutch East India Company (VOC), dating from 1623, for the amount of 2,400 florins]]

The progenitors of the modern corporation were the chartered companies, such as the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) and the [[Hudson's Bay Company]], which were created to lead the colonial ventures of European nations in the 17th century. Acting under a charter sanctioned by the Dutch government, the Dutch East India Company defeated [[Portugal|Portuguese]] forces and established itself in the [[Maluku Islands|Moluccan Islands]] in order to profit from the [[Europe]]an demand for [[spice]]s. Investors in the VOC were issued paper certificates as proof of share ownership, and were able to trade their shares on the original [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange]]. Shareholders were also explicitly granted [[limited liability]] in the company's royal charter.&lt;ref&gt;Om Prakash, ''European Commercial Enterprise in Pre-Colonial India'' (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, the government created corporations under a [[royal charter]] or an [[Act of Parliament]] with the grant of a [[monopoly]] over a specified territory. The best-known example, established in 1600, was the [[East India Company]] of [[London]]. [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] granted it the exclusive right to trade with all countries to the east of the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. Some corporations at this time would act on the government's behalf, bringing in revenue from its exploits abroad. Subsequently, the Company became [[Company rule in India|increasingly integrated]] with English and later British military and colonial policy, just as most corporations were essentially dependent on the [[Royal Navy]]'s ability to control trade routes.

Labeled by both contemporaries and historians as "the grandest society of merchants in the universe", the English East India Company would come to symbolize the dazzlingly rich potential of the corporation, as well as new methods of business that could be both brutal and exploitative.&lt;ref&gt;John Keay, ''The Honorable Company: A History of the English East India Company'' (MacMillan, New York 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 December 1600, Queen Elizabeth I granted the company a 15-year monopoly on trade to and from the [[East Indies]] and [[Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.utk.edu/~gerard/romanticpolitics/britisheastindia.html|title=British East India Company|first=Gerard Cohen-Vrignaud, Stephanie Metz, Jody Dunville, Shannon Heath, Julia P. McLeod, Kat Powell, Brent Robida, John Stromski, Brandon|last=Haynes|publisher=|accessdate=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1711, shareholders in the East India Company were earning a [[return on investment|return on their investment]] of almost 150 per cent. Subsequent stock offerings demonstrated just how lucrative the Company had become. Its first stock offering in 1713–1716 raised £418,000, its second in 1717–1722 raised £1.6 million.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'' at p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:South-sea-bubble-chart.png|thumb|left|Chart of the [[South Sea Company]]'s stock prices. The rapid inflation of the stock value in the 1710s led to the [[Bubble Act|Bubble Act 1720]], which restricted the establishment of companies without a [[royal charter]].]]
A similar [[chartered company]], the [[South Sea Company]], was established in 1711 to trade in the Spanish South American colonies, but met with less success. The South Sea Company's monopoly rights were supposedly backed by the [[Treaty of Utrecht]], signed in 1713 as a settlement following the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], which gave [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] an ''[[asiento]]'' to trade in the region for thirty years. In fact the Spanish remained hostile and let only one ship a year enter. Unaware of the problems, investors in Britain, enticed by extravagant promises of profit from [[Corporate promoter|company promoters]] bought thousands of shares. By 1717, the South Sea Company was so wealthy (still having done no real business) that it assumed the [[Government debt|public debt]] of the British government. This accelerated the inflation of the share price further, as did the [[Bubble Act|Bubble Act 1720]], which (possibly with the motive of protecting the South Sea Company from competition) prohibited the establishment of any companies without a Royal Charter. The share price rose so rapidly that people began buying shares merely in order to sell them at a higher price, which in turn led to higher share prices. This was the first [[Economic bubble|speculative bubble]] the country had seen, but by the end of 1720, the bubble had "burst", and the share price sank from £1000 to under £100. As bankruptcies and recriminations ricocheted through government and high society, the mood against corporations and errant directors was bitter.

In the late 18th century, [[Stewart Kyd]], the author of the first treatise on [[corporate law]] in English, defined a corporation as:

{{quote|a collection of many individuals united into one body, under a special denomination, having [[perpetual succession]] under an artificial form, and vested, by policy of the law, with the capacity of acting, in several respects, as an individual, particularly of taking and granting property, of contracting obligations, and of suing and being sued, of enjoying privileges and immunities in common, and of exercising a variety of political rights, more or less extensive, according to the design of its institution, or the powers conferred upon it, either at the time of its creation, or at any subsequent period of its existence.|A Treatise on the Law of Corporations, Stewart Kyd (1793–1794)}}

===Modern company law===
Due to the late 18th century abandonment of [[Mercantilism|mercantilist]] economic theory and the rise of [[classical liberalism]] and [[laissez-faire]] economic theory due to a revolution in [[economics]] led by [[Adam Smith]] and other economists, corporations transitioned from being government or [[guild]] affiliated entities to being public and private economic entities free of governmental directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://political-economy.com/adam-smith-laissez-faire/|title=Adam Smith Laissez-Faire|website=political-economy.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adam Smith wrote in his 1776 work ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' that mass corporate activity could not match private entrepreneurship, because people in charge of others' money would not exercise as much care as they would with their own.&lt;ref&gt;A Smith, ''[[An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations]]'' (1776), Book V, ch 1, para 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Deregulation====
[[File: Jack and the Giant Joint-Stock.jpg|thumb|"Jack and the Giant Joint-Stock", a cartoon in ''Town Talk'' (1858) satirizing the 'monster' joint-stock economy that came into being after the [[Joint Stock Companies Act 1844]].]]
The British Bubble Act 1720's prohibition on establishing companies remained in force until its repeal in 1825. By this point, the [[Industrial Revolution]] had gathered pace, pressing for legal change to facilitate business activity.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Bubble Companies, etc. Act 1825]], 6 Geo 4, c 91&lt;/ref&gt; The repeal was the beginning of a gradual lifting on restrictions, though business ventures (such as those chronicled by [[Charles Dickens]] in ''[[Martin Chuzzlewit]]'') under primitive companies legislation were often scams. Without cohesive regulation, proverbial operations like the "Anglo-Bengalee Disinterested Loan and Life Assurance Company" were undercapitalised ventures promising no hope of success except for richly paid promoters.&lt;ref&gt;See [[C Dickens]], ''[[Martin Chuzzlewit]]'' (1843) [[s:Martin Chuzzlewit/Chapter 27|ch 27]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of [[incorporation (business)|incorporation]] was possible only through a [[royal charter]] or a [[local and personal Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|private act]] and was limited, owing to Parliament's jealous protection of the privileges and advantages thereby granted. As a result, many businesses came to be operated as [[Voluntary association|unincorporated associations]] with possibly thousands of members. Any consequent [[Lawsuit|litigation]] had to be carried out in the joint names of all the members and was almost impossibly cumbersome. Though Parliament would sometimes grant a private act to allow an individual to represent the whole in legal proceedings, this was a narrow and necessarily costly expedient, allowed only to established companies.

Then, in 1843, [[William Ewart Gladstone|William Gladstone]] became the chairman of a Parliamentary Committee on Joint Stock Companies, which led to the [[Joint Stock Companies Act 1844]], regarded as the first modern piece of company law.&lt;ref&gt;''Report of the Parliamentary Committee on Joint Stock Companies'' (1844) in ''British Parliamentary Papers'', vol. VII&lt;/ref&gt; The Act created the [[Registrar of Companies|Registrar of Joint Stock Companies]], empowered to register companies by a two-stage process. The first, provisional, stage cost £5 and did not confer corporate status, which arose after completing the second stage for another £5. For the first time in history, it was possible for ordinary people through a simple registration procedure to incorporate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LQflMqcZyOoC|title=Introduction to Company Law|author=Paul Lyndon Davies|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advantage of establishing a company as a [[Legal personality|separate legal person]] was mainly administrative, as a unified entity under which the rights and duties of all investors and managers could be channeled.

====Limited liability====
However, there was still no limited liability and company members could still be held responsible for unlimited losses by the company.&lt;ref&gt;''Re Sea Fire and Life Assurance Co., Greenwood's Case'' (1854) 3 De GM&amp;G 459&lt;/ref&gt; The next, crucial development, then, was the [[Limited Liability Act 1855]], passed at the behest of the then Vice President of the Board of Trade, Mr. [[Robert Lowe]]. This allowed investors to limit their liability in the event of business failure to the amount they invested in the company – [[shareholder]]s were still liable directly to [[creditor]]s, but just for the unpaid portion of their [[share (finance)|shares]]. (The principle that shareholders are liable to the corporation had been introduced in the Joint Stock Companies Act 1844).

The 1855 Act allowed limited liability to companies of more than 25 members (shareholders). [[Insurance|Insurance companies]] were excluded from the act, though it was standard practice for insurance contracts to exclude action against individual members. Limited liability for insurance companies was allowed by the [[Companies Act 1862]].

This prompted the English periodical ''[[The Economist]]'' to write in 1855 that "never, perhaps, was a change so vehemently and generally demanded, of which the importance was so much overrated. "&lt;ref&gt;Graeme G. Acheson &amp; John D. Turner, ''The Impact of Limited Liability on Ownership and Control: Irish Banking, 1877–1914'', School of Management and Economics, Queen's University of Belfast, available at {{cite web|url=http://www.ehs.org.uk/ehs/conference2004/assets/AchesonTurnerPaper.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113082939/http://www.ehs.org.uk/ehs/conference2004/assets/AchesonTurnerPaper.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-13 |df= }} and {{cite web|url=http://www1.fee.uva.nl/fm/conference/legal/ehr_2006_%20Acheson%20and%20Turner.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111172110/http://www1.fee.uva.nl/fm/conference/legal/ehr_2006_%20Acheson%20and%20Turner.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-11 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The major error of this judgment was recognised by the same magazine more than 70 years later, when it claimed that, "[t]he economic historian of the future. . . may be inclined to assign to the nameless inventor of the principle of limited liability, as applied to trading corporations, a place of honour with [[James Watt|Watt]] and [[George Stephenson|Stephenson]], and other pioneers of the Industrial Revolution. "&lt;ref&gt;''Economist'', December 18, 1926, at 1053, as quoted in Mahoney, ''supra'', at 875.&lt;/ref&gt;

These two features – a simple registration procedure and limited liability – were subsequently codified into the landmark 1856 [[Joint Stock Companies Act 1856|Joint Stock Companies Act]]. This was subsequently consolidated with a number of other statutes in the Companies Act 1862, which remained in force for the rest of the century, up to and including the time of the decision in ''[[Salomon v A Salomon &amp; Co Ltd]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Salomon v A Salomon &amp; Co Ltd]]'' [1897] AC 22&lt;/ref&gt;

The legislation shortly gave way to a railway boom, and from then, the numbers of companies formed soared. In the later nineteenth century, depression took hold, and just as company numbers had boomed, many began to implode and fall into insolvency. Much strong academic, legislative and judicial opinion was opposed to the notion that businessmen could escape accountability for their role in the failing businesses.

====Further developments====
[[File:LordLindley cropp.jpg|thumb|right|[[Nathaniel Lindley, Baron Lindley|Lindley LJ]] was the leading expert on partnerships and company law in the ''[[Salomon v A Salomon &amp; Co Ltd|Salomon v. Salomon &amp; Co.]]'' case. The landmark case confirmed the [[corporate identity|distinct corporate identity]] of the company.]]
In 1892, [[Germany]] introduced the [[Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung]] with a separate [[legal personality]] and limited liability even if all the shares of the company were held by only one person. This inspired other countries to introduce corporations of this kind.

The last significant development in the history of companies was the 1897 decision of the House of Lords in ''[[Salomon v A Salomon &amp; Co Ltd|Salomon v. Salomon &amp; Co.]]'' where the House of Lords confirmed the separate legal personality of the company, and that the liabilities of the company were separate and distinct from those of its owners.

In the [[United States]], forming a corporation usually required an act of legislation until the late 19th century. Many private firms, such as [[Andrew Carnegie|Carnegie]]'s steel company and [[John D. Rockefeller|Rockefeller]]'s [[Standard Oil]], avoided the corporate model for this reason (as a [[Trust law|trust]]). State governments began to adopt more permissive corporate laws from the early 19th century, although these were all restrictive in design, often with the intention of preventing corporations for gaining too much wealth and power.&lt;ref name="Corporate Law textbook"&gt;{{Citation|last1=Smiddy|first1=Linda O.|last2=Cunningham|first2=Lawrence A.|title=Corporations and Other Business Organizations: Cases, Materials, Problems|publisher=LexisNexis|year=2010|edition=Seventh|pages=228–31, 241|isbn=978-1-4224-7659-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[New Jersey]] was the first state to adopt an "enabling" corporate law, with the goal of attracting more business to the state,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ftzqaBv7X_sC&amp;pg=PA159&amp;lpg=PA159&amp;dq=%22new+jersey%22+%22first+state%22+%22business+corporation%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=n5Af0liBo5&amp;sig=A2RRh_zOyS7W3CCMK4ZyG6Scmwk The Law of Business Organizations], Cengage Learning&lt;/ref&gt; in 1896. In 1899, Delaware followed New Jersey's lead with the enactment of an enabling corporate statute, but Delaware only became the leading corporate state after the enabling provisions of the 1896 New Jersey corporate law were repealed in 1913.&lt;ref name = "Corporate Law textbook"/&gt;

The end of the 19th century saw the emergence of [[Holding company|holding companies]] and corporate [[Mergers and acquisitions|mergers]] creating larger corporations with dispersed shareholders. Countries began enacting [[Competition law|anti-trust]] laws to prevent anti-competitive practices and corporations were granted more legal rights and protections.
The 20th century saw a proliferation of laws allowing for the creation of corporations by registration across the world, which helped to drive economic booms in many countries before and after World War I. Another major post World War I shift was toward the development of [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerates]], in which large corporations purchased smaller corporations to expand their industrial base.

Starting in the 1980s, many countries with large state-owned corporations moved toward [[privatization]], the selling of publicly owned (or 'nationalised') services and enterprises to corporations. [[Deregulation]] (reducing the regulation of corporate activity) often accompanied privatization as part of a laissez-faire policy.

==Ownership and control==
A corporation is, at least in theory, owned and controlled by its members. In a [[joint-stock company]] the members are known as shareholders and each of their shares in the ownership, control, and profits of the corporation is determined by the portion of shares in the company that they own. Thus a person who owns a quarter of the shares of a joint-stock company owns a quarter of the company, is entitled to a quarter of the profit (or at least a quarter of the profit given to shareholders as dividends) and has a quarter of the votes capable of being cast at general meetings.

In another kind of corporation, the legal document which established the corporation or which contains its current rules will determine who the corporation's members are. Who a member is depends on what kind of corporation is involved. In a [[worker cooperative]], the members are people who work for the cooperative. In a [[credit union]], the members are people who have accounts with the credit union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Principles of Finance |first1=Scott |last1=Besley |first2=Eugene |last2=Brigham |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2008 |isbn=9780324655889 |edition=4th |page=105 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The day-to-day activities of a corporation are typically controlled by individuals appointed by the members. In some cases, this will be a single individual but more commonly corporations are controlled by a committee or by committees. Broadly speaking, there are two kinds of committee structure.
* A single committee known as a [[board of directors]] is the method favored in most [[common law]] countries. Under this model, the board of directors is composed of both executive and non-executive directors, the latter being meant to supervise the former's management of the company.
* A two-tiered committee structure with a [[supervisory board]] and a [[Vorstand|managing board]] is common in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Company &amp; Commercial – Netherlands: In a nutshell – one-tier boards |date=10 April 2012 |publisher=International Law Office |url=http://www.internationallawoffice.com/newsletters/detail.aspx?g=f4815d3b-0de3-44d3-81d8-16114b49b8d8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formation===
Historically, corporations were created by a charter granted by government. Today, corporations are usually registered with the state, province, or national government and regulated by the laws enacted by that government. Registration is the main prerequisite to the corporation's assumption of limited liability. The law sometimes requires the corporation to designate its principal address, as well as a [[registered agent]] (a person or company designated to receive legal service of process). It may also be required to designate an [[Law of agency|agent]] or other legal representative of the corporation.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Generally, a corporation files [[articles of incorporation]] with the government, laying out the general nature of the corporation, the amount of stock it is authorized to issue, and the names and addresses of directors. Once the articles are approved, the corporation's directors meet to create [[By-law|bylaws]] that govern the internal functions of the corporation, such as meeting procedures and officer positions.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

The law of the jurisdiction in which a corporation operates will regulate most of its internal activities, as well as its finances. If a corporation operates outside its home state, it is often required to register with other governments as a [[foreign corporation]], and is almost always subject to laws of its host state pertaining to [[employment]], [[crime]]s, [[contract]]s, [[Lawsuit|civil actions]], and the like.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

===Naming===
Corporations generally have a distinct name. Historically, some corporations were named after their membership: for instance, "The President and Fellows of Harvard College". Nowadays, corporations in most jurisdictions have a distinct name that does not need to make reference to their membership. In Canada, this possibility is taken to its logical extreme: many smaller Canadian corporations have no names at all, merely numbers based on a registration number (for example, "12345678 Ontario Limited"), which is assigned by the provincial or territorial government where the corporation incorporates.

In most countries, corporate names include a term or an abbreviation that denotes the corporate status of the entity (for example, "Incorporated" or "Inc." in the United States) or the limited liability of its members (for example, "Limited" or "Ltd."). These terms vary by jurisdiction and language. In some jurisdictions, they are mandatory, and in others they are not.&lt;ref&gt;The U.S. state of California is an example of a jurisdiction that does not require corporations to indicate corporate status in their names, except for close corporations. The drafters of the 1977 revision of the California General Corporation Law considered the possibility of forcing all California corporations to have a name indicating corporate status, but decided against it because of the huge number of corporations that would have had to change their names, and the lack of any evidence that anyone had been harmed in California by entities whose corporate status was not immediately apparent from their names. However, the 1977 drafters were able to impose the current disclosure requirement for close corporations. See Harold Marsh, Jr., R. Roy Finkle, Larry W. Sonsini, and Ann Yvonne Walker, ''Marsh's California Corporation Law'', 4th ed., vol. 1 (New York: Aspen Publishers, 2004), 5–15 — 5–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Their use puts everybody on [[constructive notice]] that they are dealing with an entity whose [[legal liability|liability]] is limited: one can only collect from whatever assets the entity still controls when one obtains a judgment against it.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the use of the word "'''company'''" alone to denote corporate status, since the word "[[company]]" may refer to a partnership or some other form of collective ownership (in the United States it can be used by a [[sole proprietorship]] but this is not generally the case elsewhere).{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Personhood==
Despite not being individual human beings, corporations, as far as US law is concerned, are [[Legal personality|legal persons]], and have many of the same rights and responsibilities as [[natural person | natural persons]] do. For example, a corporation can own property, and can sue or be sued. Corporations can exercise [[human rights]] against real individuals and the state,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Human Rights of Companies: Exploring the Structure of ECHR Protection |first1=Marius |last1=Emberland |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-19-928983-7 |page=1 |url=http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.co.uk/pdf/0-19-928983-2.pdf |accessdate=2 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617104051/http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.co.uk/pdf/0-19-928983-2.pdf |archive-date=17 June 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [[South African Constitution]] Sect.8, especially Art.(4)&lt;/ref&gt; and they can themselves be responsible for human rights violations.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip I. Blumberg, The Multinational Challenge to Corporation Law: The Search for a New Corporate Personality, (1993) discusses the controversial nature of additional rights being granted to corporations.&lt;/ref&gt; Corporations can be "dissolved" either by statutory operation, order of court, or voluntary action on the part of shareholders. [[Insolvency]] may result in a form of corporate failure, when creditors force the liquidation and dissolution of the corporation under court order,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the Business Corporations Act (B.C.) [SBC 2002] CHAPTER 57, Part 10&lt;/ref&gt; but it most often results in a restructuring of corporate holdings. Corporations can even be convicted of criminal offenses, such as [[fraud]] and [[manslaughter]]. However, corporations are not considered living entities in the way that humans are.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [[Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Decimus Alfred Ball''' (1836 &amp;ndash; 30 June 1890) was an upholsterer and furniture dealer in nineteenth century London who was also a "house farmer" on the [[Northampton Estate]] in [[Clerkenwell]], London, known for the overcrowding and poor condition of his properties.

==Early life and family==
Decimus Ball was born in [[Halstead]],&lt;ref name=1881census&gt;[http://search.findmypast.co.uk/record?id=gbc%2f1881%2f0006554718 1881 England, Wales &amp; Scotland Census Transcription.] Retrieved 1 March 2016. {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essex, in 1836. In 1860, he married Ann (also Anne and Annie) King in the Clerkenwell district of London,&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.findmypast.co.uk/record?id=bmd%2fm%2f1860%2f1%2faz%2f000071%2f028 England &amp; Wales marriages 1837-2008 Transcription.] Retrieved 1 March 2016. {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; daughter of John and Caroline Jackson.&lt;ref name=1881census/&gt; The [[Census in the United Kingdom|1881 census]] records that Decimus and Anne had four sons, Alfred, Leonard, Ernest and Herbert. At that time the family were living at 4 Crescent Road, Hornsey, north London.&lt;ref name=1881census/&gt; Ball was also at one time resident at 10 Crescent Road according to electoral records.

==Northampton Estate==
The Northampton Estate (also known as Woods Close) was an area in [[Clerkenwell]], east London,&lt;ref&gt;Pearl, Cyril. (1972) ''Victorian patchwork''. London: [[William Heinemann]]. p. 4. {{ISBN|978-0434580316}}&lt;/ref&gt; owned in the mid-nineteenth century by the [[Marquess of Northampton]]. The Northamptons had owned property in the area since the sixteenth century and continued to do so until the twentieth century. The area has since been redeveloped and is now largely occupied by [[City University London]], and [[public housing]].

The Northamptons had a practice of granting leases on their properties to "house farmers", also known as "house knackers" or "house jobbers", who then subdivided the houses and let them on again in order to maximise returns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vol46/pp294-304 "Northampton Square area: Introduction"], in ''Survey of London, Volume 46, South and East Clerkenwell'', ed. Philip Temple. London, 2008. pp. 294-304.&lt;/ref&gt; In law, the house farmers were responsible to the Northamptons for the maintenance of the houses but in practice the requirement to maintain the properties was not often enforced leading to poor quality properties and a greater profit for the house farmer.&lt;ref&gt;Jephson, Henry. (1907) [https://archive.org/stream/sanitaryevolutio00jeph#page/322/mode/2up/ ''The sanitary evolution of London''.] Brooklyn: A. Wessels Co. pp. 322-333.&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of house farming quickly led to overcrowding and slum conditions, and was one of the matters investigated by the [[Royal Commission on the Housing of the Working Classes]] in 1884-85 where Ball was named as one of the main house farmers under the Marquess of Northampton as well as letting property elsewhere in London. He was also stated to be vice-chairman of the Clerkenwell parish assessment and appeal committee. Witnesses to the enquiry in 1884 could not agree whether Ball was a good landlord or not with some reporting that he would threaten to raise the rent if it was not paid by a tenant on the due date and others reporting fair treatment. There was agreement, however, that Ball made little effort to repair the properties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.31951d02309857k;view=1up;seq=130 ''First report of Her Majesty's Commissioners for Inquiring into the Housing of the Working Classes''.] Printed by [[Eyre &amp; Spottiswoode]], London, 1885. p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Ball died at Glenthorne, Crescent Road, [[Crouch End]], Middlesex, on 30 June 1890.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.findmypast.co.uk/record?id=bmd%2fd%2fdduty%2f2169525 Index to Death Duty Registers Transcription.] Retrieved 1 March 2016. {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his Will of 18 September 1889, Ball, who was described as a "furniture dealer" left his entire estate of £10,339 to his wife Anne.&lt;ref name=will&gt;''Last Will &amp; Testament''.

The mausoleum contains two additional coffins and a memorial plaque from Ball's employees.

'''Downtown Yangon''' (also known as the '''Yangon Central Business District''' or Yangon CBD; formerly the '''Cantonment''') is the [[central business district]] of [[Yangon]], [[Myanmar]], located close to the geographic centre of the [[metropolis|metropolitan]] area. The area features many of the city's major arts institutions and sports facilities.

==History==
[[File:Public Gardens, Rangoon.jpg|thumb|left|A view of the Cantonment Gardens (now People's Park and Square) in 1868.]]
The east-west grid of downtown Yangon was laid out by British military engineers Alexander Fraser and Montgomerie after the [[Second Anglo-Burmese War]] in 1852.&lt;ref name="arc"&gt;{{Cite book| last=Falconer| first=John| year=2001| title=Burmese Design &amp; Architecture| isbn=962-593-882-6| publisher=Periplus| location=Hong Kong|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city was later developed by the Public Works Department and Bengal Corps of Engineers.

The majority of sites on the [[Yangon City Heritage List]] are located in Yangon's CBD.

==Architecture==
[[File:Yangon Region Court.jpg|thumb|The Yangon Region Court building on [[Strand Road, Yangon|Strand Road]].]]
Yangon's CBD is known for its leafy avenues and fin-de-siècle architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123266507433707833 | title=Asia's Lost Treasure Trove| author=Tom Wright| date=2009-01-23| work=WSJ Weekend Journal | publisher=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former British colonial capital has the highest number of colonial period buildings in Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name="bygone"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Martin |first=Steven |date=2004-03-30 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3578993.stm |title=Burma maintains bygone buildings |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2006-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CBD is still mainly made up of decaying colonial buildings. The former [[High Court (Burma)|High Court]], the former [[Ministers' Building|Secretariat buildings]], the former [[BEHS 6 Botataung|St. Paul's English High School]] and the [[Strand Hotel]] are excellent examples of the bygone era. Most buildings in the CBD from this era are four-story mix-use (residential and commercial) buildings with {{convert|14|ft|m|adj=on}} ceilings, allowing for the construction of [[mezzanine (architecture)|mezzanines]]. Despite their less-than-perfect conditions, the buildings remain highly sought after and most expensive in the city's property market.&lt;ref name=oldies&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Demand for downtown’s golden oldies still strong |url=http://mmtimes.com/no449/b007.html |date=2008-12-15 |publisher=The Myanmar Times |author=Htar Htar Khin |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214145346/http://mmtimes.com/no449/b007.html |archivedate=2012-02-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, the [[Yangon City Development Committee]] created a [[Yangon City Heritage List]] of old buildings and structures in the city that cannot be modified or torn down without approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/colonial-past-could-be-the-saving-of-rangoon-2219991.html|title=Colonial past could be the saving of Rangoon|last=Kennedy|first=Phoebe|date=20 February 2011|work=The Independent|accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the city of Yangon imposed a 50-year moratorium on demolition of buildings older than 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/2012/news/619/news61901.html|title=Historic Yangon cityscape thrown a lifeline|last=Kean|first=Thomas|date=19 March 2012|work=Myanmar Times|accessdate=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rob"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/366b4332-69b5-11e1-8996-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1ohjcvgh1|title=Myanmar pushes to save colonial buildings|last=Robinson|first=Gwen|date=9 March 2012|work=Financial Times|accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Yangon Heritage Trust]], an NGO started by [[Thant Myint-U]], aims to create heritage areas in Downtown, and attract investors to renovate buildings for commercial use.&lt;ref name="rob"/&gt;

==Boundaries==
Geographically, the CBD is bounded by the Pun Hlaing River to the west, the [[Hlaing River]] to the south and [[Pazundaung Creek]] to the east.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/2012/business/622/biz62206.html|title=Industry backs 30-year Yangon master plan|date=9 April 2012|work=Myanmar Times|accessdate=28 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120720075158/http://www.mmtimes.com/2012/business/622/biz62206.html|archivedate=20 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation==
The pattern of south to north roads is as follows: one broad {{convert|100|ft|m|sing=on}} wide broad road, two narrow streets, one mid-size street, two more narrow streets, and then another {{convert|100|ft|m|sing=on}} wide broad road. This order is repeated from west to east. The narrow streets are numbered; the medium and broad roads are named.

For instance, the {{convert|100|ft|m|sing=on}} Lanmadaw Road is followed by {{convert|30|ft|m|sing=on}}-wide 17th and 18th streets then the medium {{convert|50|ft|m|sing=on}} Sint-Oh-Dan Road, the 30-foot 19th and 20th streets, followed by another {{convert|100|ft|m|sing=on}} wide Latha Road, followed again by the two numbered small roads 21st and 22nd streets, and so on.

The roads running parallel west to east were the Strand Road, Merchant Road, Maha Bandula (née Dalhousie) Road, Anawrahta (Fraser) Road, and Bogyoke Aung San (Montgomerie) Road.

The CBD's road layout follows a grid pattern, based on four types of roads:
* Broad 160-foot (49-m) wide roads running west to east
* Broad 100-foot (30-m) wide roads running south to north
* Two narrow 30-foot (9.1-m) wide streets running south to north
* Mid-size 50-foot (15-m) wide streets running south to north

Since February 2010, [[pickup truck]] bus lines have been forbidden to run in 6 townships of the CBD, namely [[Latha Township|Latha]], [[Lanmadaw Township|Lanmadaw]], [[Pabedan Township|Pabedan]], [[Kyauktada Township|Kyauktada]], [[Botahtaung Township|Botahtaung]] and [[Pazundaung Township]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/2010/news/511/n51106.html|title=Authorities ban light truck buses in downtown areas|author=Nay Nwe Moe Aung|work=Myanmar Times|date=24 February 2010|accessdate=18 August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716143017/http://mmtimes.com/2010/news/511/n51106.html|archivedate=16 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2003, a ban on using car horns was implemented in six townships of The CBD to reduce [[noise pollution]].&lt;ref name="symo"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/no396/n008.htm|title=Vehicle horn penalties increased|author=Shwe Yinn Mar Oo|date=10 December 2007|work=Myanmar Times|accessdate=18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2004, the car horn ban was expanded to cover the entire city.&lt;ref name="symo"/&gt;

The '''Employee of the Month''' (EOM) is a type of reward program given out by companies (often to encourage the staff to work harder and more productively). It involves recognising employees for achieving excellence in their field, and being the best worker across all fields. Traditionally, the award is given out every month, but that is not necessarily the case. The system is popular in the United States.

==Criteria==
One of the main factors of Employee of the Month systems that make them unique is the criteria used to work out who is the "best" worker for a given month. A document called Employee of the Month Selection Criteria suggests the two main criteria are "quality of work standards" and "attitude standards".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.docstoc.com/docs/1791437/Employee-of-the-Month-Selection-Criteria | title=Employee of the Month Selection Criteria | accessdate=November 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Employee of the month is usually based on performance, quality, attendance and many other determining factors from previous month(s) based on the associate's role.  The "best" worker is then rewarded the following month with the title of "Employee of the Month". During this month, the associate is usually rewarded with a certificate, trophy, or other honors.

An '''Estoppel Certificate''' (or '''Estoppel Letter''') is a document often used in due diligence in [[Real estate]] and [[Mortgage loan|mortgage]] activities.&lt;ref name="Shaffer"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shaffer|first1=Brent C.|title=Using Tenant Estoppel Letters to Cut to the Chase|date=2001|url=http://www.americanbar.org/publications/probate_property_magazine_home/rppt_publications_magazine_2001_01nd_shaffer.html|accessdate=3 March 2017|publisher=ABA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a document often completed, but at least signed, by a tenant used in his or her landlord's proposed transaction with a third party.&lt;ref name=Shaffer/&gt;  A mortgage lender intending to collateralize a tenant-occupied property or a purchaser intending to purchase such a property will often want to verify certain representations made by the landlord.&lt;ref name=Shaffer/&gt;

An estoppel certificate provides confirmation by the tenant of the terms of the rental agreement, such as the amount of rent, the amount of security deposit and the expiration of the agreement.&lt;ref name=Shaffer/&gt;   Further, the estoppel certificate may give the opportunity to the tenant to explain if they may have any claims against the landlord, which may affect a buyer's or lender's decision to complete the proposed transaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of Estoppel Certificate|url=http://www.redfin.com/definition/estoppel-certificate|publisher=Redfin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some lease agreements require the tenant to complete such a certificate or to waive his responses by allowing the landlord to complete the estoppel certificate under certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Heller|first1=Stu|title=The Landlord Wants You to Sign an Estoppel Certificate?|url=http://www.theleasinglawyer.com/estoppel.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some extreme cases, a tenant can be in default of a lease when failing to comply with an estoppel certificate, though this is rare.  The majority of leases do not mention the protocol for signature of estoppel certificates.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

In addition to these official posts, Faisal bin Abdullah played a role in improving the [[King Abdullah University of Science and Technology]].&lt;ref name="us-sabc"&gt;{{cite web|title=King Abdullah Reshuffles Cabinet, Embarks on New Reform Initiative|url=http://www.us-sabc.org/i4a/pages/Index.cfm?pageID=3690|work=US-Saudi Arabian Business Council|accessdate=1 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518093800/http://www.us-sabc.org/i4a/pages/Index.cfm?pageID=3690#|archive-date=18 May 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the chairman of steering committee of Al Aghar Group of Strategic Thought.&lt;ref name=ainalyaqeen08&gt;{{cite news|title=CP agrees to be honorary president of Saudi Association for Sociology and Social Service |url=http://www.ainalyaqeen.com/arch_2008/25_march/en4.php |accessdate=28 June 2012 |work=Ain Alyaqeen |date=25 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510143901/http://www.ainalyaqeen.com/arch_2008/25_march/en4.php |archivedate=10 May 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faisal bin Abdullah was appointed minister of education to [[Council of Ministers of Saudi Arabia|the Saudi cabinet]] on 14 February 2009,&lt;ref name=gsnews&gt;{{cite web|title=Saudi Cabinet |url=http://www.gulfstatesnews.com/SSIs/GSNs_WORLD/Saudi_Arabia/documents/Saudigovernmentlist_Feb09.pdf |work=Gulf States News |accessdate=26 May 2012 |date=February 2009 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; replacing Abdullah bin Saleh bin Obaid who had been in this post since 2005.&lt;ref name="us-sabc"/&gt;&lt;ref name=anews1805&gt;{{cite news|title=Hajjar New NSHR Chief|url=http://www.arabnews.com/node/263908|accessdate=1 September 2012|newspaper=Arab News|date=18 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the appointment, western news media reported that Faisal had earlier been involved in efforts to reduce extremist influences from the Saudi education system;&lt;ref name=Janes&gt;{{citation|title=Saudi Arabia’s king changes the guard|url=http://carnegieendowment.org/files/IAA_6__June_pxx_Saudi_Arabia2.pdf|publisher=Carnegie Endowment|author=Christopher Boucek|work=Jane's Islamic Affairs Analyst|accessdate=5 May 2012|date=June 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100411045054/http://www.carnegieendowment.org/files/IAA_6__June_pxx_Saudi_Arabia2.pdf|archivedate=11 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; his appointment was thought to reflect the King's intention to reinforce efforts to reduce the influence of extremists in the domain of education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Blanchard|title=Saudi Arabia: Background and U.S. relations|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=J0WWUQBl2PwC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=khalid+bin+faisal+al+saud+and+saudi+succession&amp;ots=nxKajd0y20&amp;sig=PYshFm5_G3yz0ld86et7fSphVO8&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=khalid%20bin%20faisal%20al%20saud%20and%20saudi%20succession&amp;f=false|publisher=Congressional Research Service|accessdate=2 May 2012|date=16 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his appointment as well as the others made in 2009 was regarded as a struggle for power rather than a dynamic of reform.&lt;ref name=nabilm&gt;{{cite journal|author=Nabil Mouline|title=Power and generational transition in Saudi Arabia|journal=Critique Internationale|date=April–June 2012|volume=46|pages=1–22|url=http://www.ceri-sciencespo.com/publica/critique/46/ci46_nm.pdf|accessdate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 December 2013, Prince Faisal was removed from office upon his request and [[Khalid bin Faisal Al Saud]] was appointed minister of education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2013/12/22/Saudi-king-appoints-new-minister-of-education.html Saudi King Appoints New Minister of Education] ''Al Arabiya''. 22 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views===
It was thought that Faisal bin Abdullah supported the reform initiatives of King Abdullah.&lt;ref name="us-sabc"/&gt; Furthermore, he was regarded as progressive.&lt;ref name=shend09&gt;{{cite web|author=Simon Henderson|title=Saudi Arabia Changes Course, Slowly|url=http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/saudi-arabia-changes-course-slowly|work=The Washington Institute|date=18 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faisal bin Abdullah described King Abdullah as "the closest route between two points - a straight line."&lt;ref name=tguar&gt;{{cite news|author=Brian Whitaker|title=The Guardian profile: King Abdullah|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/mar/24/saudiarabia.brianwhitaker|accessdate=14 August 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=24 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further argued that King perceived the things as straightforward.&lt;ref name=tguar/&gt;

Faisal bin Abdullah stated in 2010 that curricula should be reorganized and improved to include more focus on progressive development and investment in human beings and to depend on [[Saudi Arabia]]'s religious, historical and cultural characteristics.&lt;ref name="saudigazette"/&gt; He told in May 2010, speaking on Saudi Television's "Good Morning" program, that women would be employed to teach boys at the public primary school level, although there is no mixed classrooms in Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name=dat10&gt;{{cite web|author=Talal Kapoor|title=A Reformist King: Abdallah And Women's Rights|url=http://www.datarabia.com/royals/viewCommentary.do?id=13845|work=Datarabia|accessdate=8 June 2012|date=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further argued that it might be time for children to attend mixed-sex primary schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Simon Mabon|title=Kingdom in Crisis?

===Membership===
Faisal bin Abdullah is the chairman of the National Committee for Education, Culture and Sciences. He has a keen interest in heritage with a passion for archaeology. He supports the [[Saudi Commission for Tourism &amp; Antiquities|Saudi Commission for Tourism and Antiquities (SCTA)]], headed by [[Sultan bin Salman]]. For him, SCTA is very crucial to preserve the Saudi Arabia’s heritage. Faisal bin Abdullah is in favor of more parallel efforts by related authorities to assist the SCTA to achieve its mission.&lt;ref name="saudigazette"/&gt;

The '''Fay automatic lathe''' was an [[automatic lathe]] tailored to cutting workpieces that were mounted on [[Lathe center|centers]] (tools with pointed ends to accurately position a [[Drill bit#Center and spotting drill bits|center-drilled]] workpiece about an axis, either directly or by using a [[mandrel]]). It could also do chucking work&lt;ref name="Roe1937p42"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roe|1937|p=42}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (feeding of unformed blanks or pieces of stock from a magazine to be automatically gripped by the machine for turning). Examples of workpieces included automotive steering knuckles&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Flanders|1921}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and transmission gears,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Flanders|1922}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and such work done on mandrels as flanges, disks, and hubs. The machine tool was developed by F.C. Fay of [[Philadelphia]] and improved by Otto A. Schaum.&lt;ref name="Roe1937p42"/&gt; It was originally manufactured by the '''Fay &amp; Scott Machine Shop'''. [[James Hartness]] acquired manufacturing rights on behalf of  the '''Jones &amp; Lamson Machine Company'''&lt;ref name="ASME1921"&gt;{{Harvnb|ASME|1921}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roe1937p42"/&gt; and manufactured an improved version, developed under the management of [[Ralph Flanders]].&lt;ref name="Roe1937p42"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Flanders|1913}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937 Roe, writing for the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]], framed the importance of the Fay automatic lathe to the capabilities of machine tools by saying that, "This machine does for the engine lathe what [[Christopher Miner Spencer|Spencer]] did for the old hand-operated [[Turret lathe#Automatic turret lathes|turret lathe]]."&lt;ref name="Roe1937p42"/&gt; These machines took an entire class of turned work formerly requiring an operator to execute the series of movements necessary to shape a piece of metal (manual control) and allowed the same work to be done automatically. This step forward in [[automation]] lowered a manufacturer's [[Unit cost|unit]] expense per part by reducing labor costs.&lt;ref name="ASME1921"&gt;{{Harvnb|ASME|1921}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, [[Numerical control|numerically controlled (CNC) machine tools]] such as turning centers, turn-mills, and [[rotary transfer machine]]s have largely supplanted cam-operated automatics.

A '''guest worker program''' allows foreign workers to temporarily reside and work in a host country until a next round of workers is readily available to switch.  Guest workers typically perform low or semi-skilled agricultural, industrial, or domestic labor in countries with workforce shortages, and they return home once their contract has expired.&lt;ref name=levine&gt;Levine, Linda. United States. Congressional Research Service. The Effects on U.S. Farmworkers of an Agricultural Guest Worker Program. 111 Cong. Cong. Rept. N.p.: n.p., n.d. LexisNexis Academic. Web. 22 Mar. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[migrant workers]] may move within a country to find labor, guest worker programs employ workers from areas outside of the host country.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, Kati L. "U.S. Migrant Worker Law: The Interstices of Immigration Law and Labor and Employment Law." Comparative Labor Law &amp; Policy 31.125 (2009): 125-62. Google Scholar. Web. 18 Apr. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Guest workers are not considered permanent [[immigrants]] due to the temporary nature of their contracts.&lt;ref name=levine /&gt;

== United States==
In the United States there have been efforts at guest worker programs for many years.  These include the [[Bracero Program]], enacted during World War II, attempts by the George W. Bush administration, and the current [[H-2A Visa|H-2]] visa program.  However, attempts at improving the programs are ongoing and have been vigorously debated. While the United States' guest worker programs do not explicitly focus on any specific nationality, such plans typically target labor from Mexico,&lt;ref name="Morgan"&gt;Morgan, Kristi L.

The Mirage of Mexican Guest Workers. ''Foreign Affairs'', 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and the history of programs between the countries.&lt;ref name="Morgan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Congress"&gt;Congressional Digest [http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=aph&amp;AN=17271015&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site|Guest Worker Program Overview.], 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History ===

====Bracero Program====
The [[Bracero Program]] (1942-1964) was a temporary-worker importation agreement between the [[United States]] and [[Mexico]]. Initially created as an emergency procedure to alleviate wartime labor shortages, the 1942 program actually lasted until 1964, bringing approximately 4.5 million legal Mexican workers into the United States during its lifespan.&lt;ref name=congress&gt;United States. Cong. Senate. Committee on the Judiciary. Temporary Worker Programs: Background and Issues. By Joyce Vialet. 96 Cong., 2 sess. S. Rept. Washington: GPO, 1980. Proquest. Web. 22 Mar. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bracero Program expanded during the early 1950s, admitting more than 400,000 Mexican workers for temporary employment per year until 1959 when numbers began a steady decline.&lt;ref name=congress /&gt; While illegal immigration was a concern of both the United States and Mexico, the Bracero Program was seen as a partial solution to the upsurge of undocumented worker entries.&lt;ref name=congress /&gt;

Under the program, total farm employment skyrocketed, domestic farm worker employment decreased, and the farm wage rate decreased.&lt;ref name=levine /&gt; Critics have noted widespread abuses of the program: workers had ten percent of their wages withheld for planned pensions but the money was often never repaid.&lt;ref&gt;Kanstroom, Daniel, and Stephanie M. Garfield. "Guest Workers." Anti-Immigration in the United States: A Historical Encyclopedia. Ed. Kathleen R. Arnold. Vol. 1. Santa Barbara, CA: Greenwood, 2011. 234-237. Gale Virtual Reference Library. Web. 21 Feb. 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Workers also were de-loused with [[DDT]] at border stations and were often placed in housing conditions deemed ‘highly inadequate’ by the [[Farm Service Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mitchell | first1 = Don | year = 2010 | title = Battle/fields: Braceros, Agribusiness, and the Violent Reproduction of the California Agricultural Landscape during World War II. | url = | journal = Journal of Historical Geography | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 143–56 | doi=10.1016/j.jhg.2010.01.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars who interviewed workers have highlighted some of the more positive aspects of the program, including the higher potential wages a bracero could earn in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Fund, John. "Cross Country: Bring Back the Braceros." The Wall Street Journal[New York] 27 July 2006, A.13 sec.: n. pag. ProQuest. Web. 22 Mar. 2013. "Bracero Jose Delgado noted that in Mexico 'life was very difficult…You could make between four to five pesos working from dusk until dawn. Coming here and making 72 cents an hour, that was a big difference.'"&lt;/ref&gt; Due in large part to the growing opposition by organized labor and welfare groups, the program came to an end in 1964.&lt;ref name=congress /&gt;

====H-2 Program====
{{See also|H-2B visa}}

As opposed to the agriculture-based [[Bracero Program]], the H-2 Visa Program offers both agricultural and non-agricultural opportunities for guest workers in the United States.&lt;ref name="OV"&gt;Guest Worker Program Overview." Congressional Digest 84.6 (2005): 164-192. Academic Search Premier. Web. 21 Feb. 2013&lt;/ref&gt; While both programs co-existed in 1950s, the H-2 program employed guest workers on a much smaller scale, allowing the program to escape some of the criticism leveled at the Bracero Program.&lt;ref name=levine /&gt;

The H-2 program is a nonimmigrant visa given on a temporary basis for "[[skill (labor)|low-skilled labor]]" in the United States. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), also known as the [[McCarran-Walter Act]], created the program in 1953.&lt;ref name="New"&gt;"Evolution Of U.S. Immigration Policy." Congressional Digest 62.8/9 (1983): 196. Academic Search Premier. Web. 26 Mar. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; This act established a quota of (non)immigrants per country based on its population of the United States in 1920.&lt;ref name="New"/&gt; Later, in 1986, the [[Immigration Reform and Control Act]] (IRCA) divided it into H-2A and H-2B.&lt;ref name="New2"&gt;Orrenius, Pia M., and Madeline Zavodny. "The Economic Consequences Of Amnesty For Unauthorized Immigrants." CATO Journal 32.1 (2012): 85-106. Academic Search Premier. Web. 26 Mar. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; These two programs are administered through the Employment Training Administration (ETA) of the [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]] (DOL) and the [[US Citizenship and Immigration Services]] (USCIS) of the [[Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS).&lt;ref name="OV" /&gt;

=====H-2A vs. H-2B=====
The H-2A program is a program that enables farm owners to apply to the Department of Labor (DOL) to bring in "low-skilled laborers" for agricultural work.&lt;ref name="DOL1"&gt;United States. Department of Labor. H-2A Temporary Agricultural Program. N.p., n.d. Web. 26 Mar. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The H-2B program is for all non-agricultural work.&lt;ref name="DOL3"&gt;United States. Department of Labor. H-2B Certification. N.p., n.d. Web. 26 Mar. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases, this work must be temporary; however, to qualify for the H2-A program, the work must also be seasonal.  The visa that is acquired by the worker is good for, at most, one year.&lt;ref name="DOL2"&gt;United States. Department of Labor. H-2A Certification. N.p., n.d. Web. 26 Mar. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is possible to renew the visa for up to three years total.&lt;ref name="OV" /&gt;

=====Qualification/application=====
To qualify for the application in both programs, there are two essential components that must be fulfilled by the employer.  After the following two qualifications are met, an employer is able to apply to the program for workers.
#There must not be enough "able, willing, and qualified U.S. workers" &lt;ref name="DOL3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DOL2" /&gt; for the position.
#The employment of nonimmigrants "will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers." &lt;ref name="DOL3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DOL2" /&gt;

====Failed legislative attempts at reform====

Most guest worker legislation introduced during the 105th through 110th Congress (January 1997-January 2003) solely discussed reforming the H-2A program.&lt;ref name=Bruno&gt;United States. Cong. Immigration: Policy Considerations Related to Guest Worker Programs. By Andorra Bruno. 109th Cong. Cong. Rept. N.p.: n.p., 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Reform provisions, which included a pathway under which guest workers could gain legal permanent residence status, were not enacted into law.&lt;ref name=Bruno /&gt; Guest worker policy discussions in 2001 between President George W. Bush and Mexican President Vicente Fox were halted after the [[9/11 terrorist attacks]] on the Twin Towers.&lt;ref&gt;Bosworth, Camille J. "Guest Worker Policy: A Critical Analysis of President Bush's Proposed Reform." Hastings Law Journal 56 (2004): 1095-120. Google Scholar. Web. 18 Apr. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 7, 2004, President Bush reaffirmed his desire for guest worker program reform and laid forth plans for its implementation, known as the ‘Fair and Secure Immigration Reform’ program.&lt;ref name=Bruno /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lichenstein, Merav. "An Examination of Guest Worker Immigration Reform Policies in the United States." Cardozo Public Law, Policy, and Ethics Journal 689 (2006): 689-728. Web. 18 Apr. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the White House Press Secretary, this program laid out five specific policy goals:
#Protecting the homeland by protecting our borders: the program should include efforts to control the United States border through agreements with participating countries.
#Serve America's economy by matching a willing worker with a willing employer: the program should efficiently connect prospective workers with employers in the same sector.
#Promoting compassion: the program should provide a temporary worker card to undocumented workers that allows them re-entry into the United States during their three years.
#Providing incentives to return to home country: the program should require workers to return to their home countries after their work period has ended.
#Protecting the rights of legal immigrants: the program should not be connected with obtaining a green card.&lt;ref name=kennedybush&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Palmunen | first1 = Aili | year = 2005 | title = Learning From The Mistakes Of The Past: An Analysis Of Past And Current Temporary Workers Policies And Their Implications For A Twenty-First Century Guest-Worker Program | url = | journal = Kennedy School Review | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 47–57 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=psecretary&gt;"Fact Sheet: Fair and Secure Immigration Reform." January 7, 2004. White House Office of the Press Secretary. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bush, George W. "Immigration Reform." Vital Speeches Of The Day 72.16/17 (2006): 466-468. Academic Search Premier. Web. 21 Apr. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
The program also contains specific agenda items for reformation of the guest worker programs already in effect. Those are:
#Employers must make every reasonable effort to fill a position with American workers first.
#Enforcement against companies hiring illegal immigrants will increase.
#The United States will work with other countries to have guest workers included in their home country's retirement plans.
#Those in the program can apply for citizenship, but will not be given any preference and will enter at the end of the line.
#A reasonable increase in the number of legal immigrants into the United States.&lt;ref name=psecretary /&gt;
The proposed program did not include a permanent legalization mechanism for guest workers. Bill S.2611, passed by the Senate in May 2006, included provisions for a guest worker program following the general guidelines of President Bush's proposed plan.&lt;ref name=harper&gt;Harper, Tiffany, No Movement on the Border: Why Immigration Reform Fell Short Under Bush (February 1, 2011). Western Political Science Association 2011 Annual Meeting Paper . Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1766720&lt;/ref&gt; No further action on the bill, however, was taken by the House, allowing to the bill to be defeated.&lt;ref name=harper /&gt;

The [[Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007]] was introduced by Senator Harry Reid (D- NV). It would have created a new visa class for temporary workers, allowing them to stay in the country for two years. It failed to pass; some attribute the bill's defeat to an approved amendment which would have ended the program after five years, leading to the loss of support for the bill in the business community.&lt;ref&gt;"Immigration bill agreement 'very close'; Guest workers still a hurdle for businesses, labor leaders."

===Current legislative proposal===

Following the 2012 presidential election in the United States, President Obama restated his desire for [[Immigration to the United States|immigration]] reform, saying that "the time has come for common-sense, comprehensive immigration reform."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Obama|first=Barack|title=President Obama Speaks on Comprehensive Immigration Reform|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/photos-and-video/video/2013/01/29/president-obama-speaks-comprehensive-immigration-reform#transcript|publisher=The White House|accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A bipartisan group of senators interested in immigration reform began meeting to discuss the issue following the election. It grew from an initial six members to eight and has been given the name "Gang of Eight."&lt;ref&gt;"Immigration reform: 'This will be the year,' bipartisan Senate 'gang' says; The politics of immigration reform have 'turned upside down' to make the Senate plan possible. It proposes a long path to citizenship, but only after the US border is deemed to be secure.." The Christian Science Monitor. (January 28, 2013 Monday ): 1424 words. LexisNexis Academic. Web.

Representatives of business and labor have negotiated the terms of a guest worker program for the current attempt at a comprehensive immigration bill.&lt;ref&gt;"A new alliance for immigration reform; Labor unions team up with businesses to push for overhaul of U.S. laws." The International Herald Tribune. (February 9, 2013 Saturday ): 1029 words. LexisNexis Academic. Web. Date Accessed: 2013/04/19.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Chamber of Commerce|U.S. Chamber of Commerce]], which represents many American business interests, and the [[AFL–CIO]], the nation’s largest federation of unions, have been conducting ongoing talks. These two groups released a joint statement listing three points of agreement regarding any guest worker program on February 21, 2013.
#American workers should have first priority for available jobs.
#American firms should be able to hire foreign workers "without having to go through a cumbersome and inefficient process."
#The system should be made more transparent and accurate by creating a "professional bureau" to report on labor needs in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joint Statement of Shared Principles by U.S. Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Thomas J. Donohue &amp; AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka|url=http://www.aflcio.org/Press-Room/Press-Releases/Joint-Statement-of-Shared-Principles-by-U.S.-Chamber-of-Commerce-President-and-CEO-Thomas-J.-Donohue-AFL-CIO-President-Richard-Trumka|accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nakamura, David. "Progress on a deal for guest workers." The Washington Post. (February 22, 2013 Friday ): 445 words. LexisNexis Academic. Web. Date Accessed: 2013/04/19.&lt;/ref&gt;

After continuing talks, it was unofficially announced at the end of March that labor and business groups had come to an agreement regarding the conditions for a guest worker program.&lt;ref&gt;Nakamura, David. "A path clears for immigration bill." The Washington Post. (March 31, 2013 Sunday ): 1072 words. LexisNexis Academic. Web. Date Accessed: 2013/04/19.&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation was introduced to the [[United States Senate|Senate]] on April 17, 2013 by Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) as the [[Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013]].

====Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013====

The proposed law would create a new class of W-visas for lower-skilled temporary workers, as well as a new agency, the Bureau of Immigration and Market Research, to set annual caps on visas and monitor the program. The W-visa allows foreign workers to enter the United States to work for a "registered employer" in a "registered position." A registered employer must pay a fee to the Bureau and submit documentation to prove its legal status. An employer cannot be registered if it has been found in violation of minimum wage or overtime law, or has been cited for violation of [[Occupational Safety and Health Act|OSHA]] or child labor provisions that resulted in serious injury or death in the three years prior to application. Registered employers must submit information about every position they wish to make registered and thus eligible for a W-visa holder.&lt;ref name=bill&gt;{{cite web|title=Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013|url=http://www.schumer.senate.gov/forms/immigration.pdf|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wage paid to W-visa holders must be the wage paid to other employees holding similar positions or the prevailing wage for that position in the area, whichever is higher.&lt;ref name = "bill" /&gt; This had been a point of disagreement in earlier talks; the [[United States Chamber of Commerce|Chamber of Commerce]] wanted to set it at the federal [[Minimum wage in the United States|minimum wage]], whereas the [[AFL-CIO]] wanted it to be "indexed off the median wage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bennett|first=Brian|title=Senators' immigration talks stall|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-immigration-unfinished-20130323,0,362221.story|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=26 March 2013|date=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consistent with the joint statement released by the AFL-CIO and the Chamber of Commerce, W-visa holders cannot be hired if there are US workers ready and willing to take the position. They also cannot be hired to take the place of US workers who are striking or otherwise involved in a labor dispute, or if unemployment is higher than 8.5% in the local area.&lt;ref name = "bill" /&gt;

W-visa holders will be entitled to the same [[United States labor law|labor rights]] as a US worker employed in a similar position would be. They can also not be treated as independent contractors. Additionally, they are entitled to protections against intimidation, threat, harassment and any other type of discrimination that may result from the W-visa holder alleging violations of the terms of employment or cooperating in an investigation of such violations by the employer. They will also not be required to remain with the same employer for their entire stay, but they must leave the country if unemployed for more than 60 consecutive days.&lt;ref name = "bill" /&gt;

W-visas will allow foreigners to enter the country for three years to work and to renew it once for an additional three years. They may bring a spouse and children who are minors with them.&lt;ref name = "bill" /&gt; The number of visas issued is a compromise between the Chamber of Commerce’s original wish for 400,000 visas to be issued annually and the [[AFL–CIO]]’s starting position of 10,000 visas annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nakamura|first=David|title=Chamber, labor unions at odds over guest worker program|url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-03-15/politics/37737044_1_guest-worker-program-jobs-with-american-workers-group-of-eight-senators|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=26 March 2013|date=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They came to an agreement to have the number of visas start at 20,000 in the first year, increase to 35,000 in the second year, 55,000 the third year, and 75,000 the fourth year. Past that, the number of visas will be capped except in special circumstances, and the exact number will be determined by the Bureau of Immigration and Market Research.&lt;ref name = "bill" /&gt;

===Controversy===

====Support====
The proposed guest worker program is supported by several groups, including the [[U.S. Chamber of Commerce]], the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations ([[AFL–CIO]]), and [[Citizenship and Immigration Services]].&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;Parker, Ashley and Greenhouse, Steven.

Mar. 5, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; These groups have advocated a new guest worker program that satisfies their interests. Individuals have also testified in congressional hearings about the role of lower-skilled guest workers in the modern economy, advocating the need for a guest worker program, especially because of labor shortages in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://congressional.proquest.com/congressional/docview/t39.d40.03146403.d31?accountid=10141|Congressional Testimony Transcript] Benjamin, Fred.

Mar 14, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of a guest worker program note several benefits such programs could have for the parties involved.

=====Benefits for workers=====
Many scholars cite the economic gain to [[migrant workers]] as the largest benefit they receive by participating in guest worker programs. Participants in the Bracero Program earned more while working in the United States than they would have been able to earn in Mexico.&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ruhs"&gt;Martin, Philip &amp; Ruhs, Martin.

Center for Migration Studies of New York, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly true of the agricultural industry, which hosts a large number of migrant workers through the [[H-2A Visa|H-2A visa program]].&lt;ref name="Congress" /&gt; Laborers in the U.S. fruit and vegetable agriculture industry can make ten to fourteen times the amount that they would in Mexico.&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt; While poor working conditions have been an issue for migrant workers,&lt;ref name="Morgan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Congress" /&gt; formal guest worker programs "ha[ve] the possibility of markedly improving [[human rights]] standards."&lt;ref name="Palmunen"&gt;Palmunen, Aili. [https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-140914860.html Learning from the Mistakes of the Past]. Harvard Kennedy School Review, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Guest worker programs also allow migrant workers to legally and securely cross the border.&lt;ref name="Palmunen" /&gt;

=====United States economy=====
Proponents have argued that a guest worker program is necessary for American employers to make up for  [[labor shortage]]s within the United States,&lt;ref name="Palmunen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HuffPo"&gt;Jamieson, Dave. [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/31/immigration-reform-guest-worker-program_n_2593729.html Immigration Reform: Guest Worker Program Considered As Part Of Deal] Huffington Post, Jan 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloomberg"&gt;Davis, Julie Hirschfeld [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-21/unions-business-reach-accord-on-guest-worker-visa-needs.html Unions, Business Reach Accord on Guest-Worker Visa Needs] Bloomberg, Feb 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in "agricultural labor or services of a temporary or seasonal nature."&lt;ref name="NCGA"&gt;[http://ncgrowers.org/media/ North Carolina Growers Association]&lt;/ref&gt; Guest worker programs can "promote a healthy [[Agriculture in the United States|agricultural market in the U.S.]]"&lt;ref name="Morgan" /&gt; by keeping supply levels up,&lt;ref name="Morgan" /&gt; prices for consumers down,&lt;ref name="Ruhs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Palmunen" /&gt; and wages for workers down.&lt;ref name="Ruhs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Palmunen" /&gt; It has also been argued that guest worker programs can help control [[immigration to the US|immigration]].&lt;ref name="Morgan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Palmunen" /&gt; In 2009, over 80 percent of agricultural workers in the United States did not have the proper legal documentation necessary for employment.&lt;ref name="NCGA" /&gt; Guest worker programs can help cut down on undocumented workers by allowing the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] to "secur[e] the cooperation of growers who [are] hiring workers illegally."&lt;ref name="Morgan" /&gt;

=====Mexican economy=====
Scholars suggest that a guest worker program also has the potential to be beneficial for labor supplying countries by reducing [[poverty]].&lt;ref name="Ruhs" /&gt; In a study of the effects of the Bracero Program, Mexico's [[Secretariat of Labor and Social Welfare (Mexico)|Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare]] found that over 96 percent of workers had sent money back to their families in Mexico.&lt;ref name="Morgan" /&gt; This not only has the potential to reduce the poverty of the families,&lt;ref name="Ruhs" /&gt; but it can also stimulate the Mexican economy. Further analysis of the Bracero Program revealed that sending workers to the United States alleviated the strain on the Mexico's resources and helped combat domestic [[unemployment]] by encouraging citizens to seek work abroad.&lt;ref name="Morgan" /&gt;

====Criticism====

There is a consensus among legal experts that America’s guest worker programs have had unintended negative consequences.&lt;ref name="Palmunen2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Palmunen|first=Aili|title=Learning From The Mistakes Of The Past: An Analysis Of Past And Current Temporary Workers Policies And Their Implications For A Twenty-First Century Guest-Worker Program.|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=aph&amp;AN=19737511&amp;site=ehost-live&amp;scope=site|publisher=Academic Search Premier, Ipswich, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Andorra"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bruno|first=Andorra|title=Immigration of Temporary Lower-Skilled Workers: Current Policy and Related Issues.|url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/homesec/R42434.pdf|publisher=Congressional Research Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Meissner&gt;{{cite web|last= Meissner|first=Doris|title=US Temporary Worker Programs: Lessons Learned.|url=http://www.migrationinformation.org/feature/display.cfm?ID=205|publisher=Migration Policy Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=farmworkers&gt;{{cite web|title= Guestworker programs|url=http://farmworkerjustice.org/advocacy-and-programs/guestworker-programs|publisher=Farmworker Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the establishment of the [[Bracero Program]], America's guest worker programs have been accused of creating abusive working conditions, withholding payments, lowering wages for domestic farm workers, and providing inadequate incentives for workers to return to their home countries.&lt;ref name="Palmunen2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Meissner /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chien&gt;{{cite web|last=Chien|first=Marsha|title= When Two Laws are Better than One: Protecting the Rights of Migrant Workers|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/lnacui2api/api/version1/getDocCui?oc=00240&amp;hl=t&amp;hns=t&amp;hnsd=f&amp;perma=true&amp;lni=4YNV-1FW0-00CV-P01N&amp;hv=t&amp;csi=165485&amp;hgn=t&amp;secondRedirectIndicator=true|publisher= Berkeley Journal of International Law}}&lt;/ref&gt; Labor groups, such as [[Laborers' International Union of North America]], [[United Food and Commercial Workers International Union]], and the [[International Brotherhood of Boilermakers]], are sensitive to the American guest worker program's history of rights violations and have advocated for lower caps on the number of guest workers allowed in the United States.&lt;ref name=Thehill&gt;http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/economy-a-budget/279407-immigration-reform-the-portable-guest-worker-visa-solution&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Civil rights=====

Proponents of guest worker programs assert that a lack of government regulation, which gave American growers more influence over the recruitment and employment of guest workers,&lt;ref name="Palmunen" /&gt; created an opportunity for the corruption and abuse traditionally linked to the Bracero Program and set a precedent of unethical practices for following guest worker programs.&lt;ref name="Palmunen" /&gt; Others add that a lack of government involvement by both the United States and the guest workers' country of residency is to blame for the prevalence of payment withholding.&lt;ref name="Palmunen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Andorra" /&gt; Research suggest that guest workers are more willing to endure abusive environments and low wages, regardless of the labor rights they are given under the visa programs, due their inability to switch employers and lack of social safety nets.&lt;ref name=Chien /&gt; Labor rights violations under the current guest worker program are alleged to include threatening workers with assault and [[blacklisting]] workers who report illegal activity, threatening the physical well-being of employees’ families, and requiring inhumane working hours.&lt;ref name=Dissent&gt;http://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/guest-workers-as-bellwether&lt;/ref&gt; America’s programs have been criticized for failing to improve working conditions.&lt;ref name=Chien /&gt; Referring to America's guest worker program, Former [[House Ways and Means Committee]] Chairman Charles Rangel commented, "This guestworker program’s the closest thing I’ve ever seen to slavery."&lt;ref name="SPLC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Close to Slavery: Guestworker Programs in the United States.|url=http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/publications/close-to-slavery-guestworker-programs-in-the-united-states#.UXNNJ6XmMVs|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Illegal immigration=====

America’s guest worker programs have been criticized for not properly addressing the issue of lingering immigrants. Experts suggest that the relocation of recruitment sites from populated cities to less populated areas encourages migrants to enter the U.S. illegally if they were turned away at the recruitment office to make up for the economic cost of travel.&lt;ref name=Chien /&gt; This practice may further depress wages and complicate the recruitment process by increasing [[illegal immigration]].&lt;ref name=Chien /&gt; To mitigate inherent wage decreases, America’s current guest worker program establishes a [[price floor]] for registered guest worker wages.&lt;ref name=Meissner /&gt; Experts are skeptical of this approach, as it may discourage the use of legal guest workers, leading growers to employ cheaper, undocumented laborers.&lt;ref name="Palmunen" /&gt;

=====Effectiveness=====

The effectiveness of guest worker programs has been a source of disagreement among scholars. Accounts from agricultural employers purport that most employers do not use the program to recruit workers.&lt;ref name=LATimes&gt;{{cite news|last=Semuels|first=Alana|title=U.S. farmers, guest workers pay a price to stay legal.|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-guest-worker-20130331-dto,0,5896092.htmlstory|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=30 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent article in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that about 6% of farm workers are employed via [[H-2A Visa]]s and that undocumented workers account for most of agricultural labor.&lt;ref name=LATimes /&gt; An article published by Florida Farmers Incorporated reported similarly low levels of participation among Florida citrus growers&lt;ref name=FFI&gt;{{cite web|last=Klipa|first=Jessica|title=New guest worker rules yet to be tested.|url=http://www.floridafarmers.org/news/articles/Newguestworkerrulesyettobetested.htm|publisher=Florida Farmers Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and suggested that the current guest worker program is unpopular because of the complicated, expensive, and timeconsuming process of acquiring H-2A visas.&lt;ref name=FFI /&gt;

The success of the current migrant worker system has yet to be completely evaluated.&lt;ref name="Palmunen" /&gt; Those who have attempted to calculate and predict the success of guest worker programs have found the process to be very speculative. In an analysis of the United States' guest worker program, legal expert Aili Palmunen wrote, "it is difficult if not impossible to give a concrete estimate of who will participate in this program."&lt;ref name="Palmunen" /&gt;

==Outside the United States==

Countries outside of [[The United States]] that have used guest worker programs in the past or currently have programs in place include [[Singapore]],&lt;ref&gt;Howley, Kerry.

Report on Eastern Europe 27 (1990): 48-59. Web. 11 Apr. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian Mexican [[Seasonal Agricultural Workers Program]], started in 1974, is a [[bilateralism|bilateral]] agreement between Canada and Mexico. While similar to the Bracero Program in that it uses temporary Mexican workers to fill labor shortages, the Canadian Program differs in its provided working and living conditions, more bureaucratic recruitment practices, and smaller size.&lt;ref name=Canada1 /&gt; The Mexican Ministry of Labor recruits workers and negotiates wages with Human Resources Development Canada. Farmers are required to offer workers a minimum of 240 work hours over six weeks, provide free approved housing and cooking facilities, and pay the higher of the minimum or prevailing wage given to Canadians performing the same labor. Most Mexican workers are male, married, and over 25 years of age, who leave their families behind in Mexico; their average stay in Canada is four months.&lt;ref name=Canada22&gt;Martin, Philip. "Managing Labor Migration: Temporary Worker Programmes For the 21st Century." Proc. of International Symposium On International Migration and Development, United Nations Secretariat, Turin, Italy. Turin: n.p., 2006. 1-42. Web. 11 Apr. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, [[Taiwan]] introduced a formal guest worker program that allowed the importation of workers from [[Thailand]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Indonesia]] under one-year [[visa (document)|visa]]s.&lt;ref name=taiwan1 /&gt; Under the Employment Services Act of 1992, temporary guest workers from these countries were permitted to work in Taiwan's manufacturing, construction, and services sectors.&lt;ref name=taiwan2&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chang | first1 = Doris T | year = 2009 | title = What Can Taiwan and the United States Learn From Each Other's Guest Worker Programs? | url = | journal = Journal of Workplace Rights | volume = 14 | issue = 1| pages = 3–26 | doi=10.2190/wr.14.1.b}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a protection mechanism for local workers, the Taiwanese government has set quotas for the percentage of foreign workers that each industry sector is allowed to hire.&lt;ref name=taiwan2 /&gt;

In response to wartime physical and capital losses, [[West Germany]] imported guest workers after the end of [[World War II]] to speed up the postwar reconstruction process. The Federal Labor Office recruited low and semi-skilled workers from Mediterranean countries; the initial bilateral agreement was with Italy, the program expanded to include Greece, Turkey, Morocco, Portugal, Tunisia and Yugoslavia.&lt;ref name=germany&gt;Castles, Stephen.

'''Gunung Agung''' is one of [[Indonesia]]'s leading [[bookstore]] companies. It is named after the [[Gunung Agung|volcano of that name]] in [[Bali, Indonesia]].

The origin of the bookstore dates back to 1953&lt;ref name="start"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tokogunungagung.com/beta/about/past |title=The Seeds of Success First Sown |publisher=Gunung Agung |accessdate=March 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the late Tjio Wie Tay (1927-1990), who later became popularly known as Haji Masagung, started a [[kiosk]] selling books, newspaper and magazines under the partnership name Thay San Kongsie in [[Central Jakarta]], part of [[Jakarta]]. As the business grew bigger and more complex in the early [[Indonesian National Revolution#Indonesian independence|post-independence]] years, Masagung established a new company that published and imported books, named Firma Gunung Agung.

The company continued to grow with the support of poets, writers, scholars and journalists. Amidst the difficulties faced by the new nation, Masagung pioneered the effort to open the eyes of the nation through books. He organized Indonesia's first [[book fair]] in 1954.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2515">'''Hans Dessauer senior''' (June 24, 1869 in [[Aschaffenburg]] – October 23, 1926) was a German industrialist and politician.

Dessauer was born in [[Aschaffenburg]] in a family of industrialists who owned the [[Aschaffenburger Buntpapierfabrik]], a leading coloured paper factory with a long tradition.&lt;ref name=papier&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tobias-lib.uni-tuebingen.de/volltexte/2009/3675/pdf/Schmidt_Bachem_Papierverarbeitung.pdf |author=Heinz Schmidt-Bachem |title=Beiträge zur Industriegeschichte der Papier-, Pappe- und Folien-Verarbeitung in Deutschland / Dessauer/Aschaffenburg |publisher=University of Tübingen |year=2009 |format=PDF |page=93 |language=German |accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were [[Philipp Dessauer]] ([[:de:Philipp Dessauer|in German]]) and Maria Elisabeth Vossen, a daughter of the paint manufacturer Franz Vossen in Aachen. Dessauer first attended the [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]] in Aschaffenburg, then went to [[RWTH Aachen University]] in [[Aachen]]. Subsequently, he studied chemistry in [[Freiburg]] and [[Munich]] and received his doctorate there in 1892 with a thesis on [[pyrazoline]] and [[Trimethylamine|trimethylen derivates]]. As a student, Dessauer was an active member of Catholic students' associations.

After graduating, Dessauer worked in the paint factory of his uncle [[Leo Vossen]] in Aachen and took over the management of the Paris branch of this company for two years. In 1896 he spent a year at a pulp mill in [[Wisconsin]], USA, and from 1897 he worked in the Aschaffenburg Buntpapierfabrik with his father. After his father's death in 1900 he joined the management of that company.&lt;ref&gt; S. Koß: ''Biographisches Lexikon des KV.'' Band 4. {{ISBN|3-89498-032-X}}, S. 30 f. &lt;/ref&gt;

Dessauer was a member of several associations and industrialists of the Economic Committee of the BVP ([[Bavarian People's Party|Bayerische Volkspartei]]), and he was also a member of the Aschaffenburg City Council for the Party. For his services he was awarded the title [[Kommerzienrat]] (commercial councillor).

His oldest son Hans Dessauer Jr., born in 1905, emigrated from Germany to the United States in 1929 and became known as [[John H. Dessauer]]. His son [[Guido Dessauer]], born 1915, joined the management of the family company in 1945.

'''Investment management''' (or financial management) is the professional [[asset management]] of various [[Security (finance)|securities]] (shares, bonds and other securities) and other [[asset]]s (e.g., [[real estate]]) in order to meet specified [[investment]] goals for the benefit of the investors. Investors may be institutions (insurance companies, pension funds, corporations, charities, educational establishments etc.) or private investors (both directly via investment contracts and more commonly via [[collective investment scheme]]s e.g. [[mutual fund]]s or [[exchange-traded fund]]s).

The term asset management is often used to refer to the investment management of [[collective investment]]s, while the more generic fund management may refer to all forms of institutional investment as well as investment management for private investors.  Investment managers who specialize in ''advisory'' or [[Discretionary Investment Management|''discretionary'' management]] on behalf of (normally wealthy) private investors may often refer to their services as [[money management]] or portfolio management often within the context of "[[private banking]]".

The provision of investment management services includes elements of [[financial statement analysis]], asset selection, stock selection, plan implementation and ongoing monitoring of investments. Coming under the remit of [[financial services]] many of the world's largest companies are at least in part investment managers and employ millions of staff.  It remains unclear if professional investment managers can reliably enhance risk adjusted returns by an amount that exceeds fees and expenses of investment management.&lt;ref name="Owner"&gt;Amedeo De Cesari, Susanne Espenlaub, Arif Khurshed and Michael Simkovic, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1884171 "The Effects of Ownership and Stock Liquidity on the Timing of Repurchase Transactions"], 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The term fund manager (or [[investment advisor]] in the United States) refers to both a [[business|firm]] that provides investment management services and an individual who directs fund management decisions.

According to a [[Boston Consulting Group]] study, the assets managed professionally for fees reached an all-time high of US$62.4 trillion in 2012, after remaining flat-lined since 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Shub, Gary ''et al.'' (July 2013) [https://www.bcgperspectives.com/Images/Capitalizing_on_the_Recovery_Jul_2013_tcm80-139325.pdf Global Asset Management 2013 – capitalizing on the Recovery]. Boston Consulting Group&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, these industry assets under management were expected to reach US$70.2 trillion at the end of 2013 as per a Cerulli Associates estimate.

The global investment management industry is highly concentrated in nature, in a universe of about 70,000 funds roughly 99.7% of the US fund flows in 2012 went into just 185 funds. Additionally, a majority of fund managers report that more than 50% of their inflows go to only three funds.

==Industry scope==

The business of investment has several facets, the employment of professional fund managers, research (of individual assets and [[asset classes]]), dealing, settlement, marketing, [[internal audit]]ing, and the preparation of reports for clients.  The largest financial fund managers are firms that exhibit all the complexity their size demands.  Apart from the people who bring in the money (marketers) and the people who direct investment (the fund managers), there are compliance staff (to ensure accord with legislative and regulatory constraints), internal auditors of various kinds (to examine internal systems and controls), financial controllers (to account for the institutions' own money and costs), computer experts, and "back office" employees (to track and record transactions and fund valuations for up to thousands of clients per institution).

===Key problems of running such businesses===

Key problems include:

* revenue is directly linked to market valuations, so a major fall in asset prices can cause a precipitous decline in revenues relative to costs;
* above-average fund performance is difficult to sustain, and clients may not be patient during times of poor performance;
* successful fund managers are expensive and may be headhunted by competitors;
* above-average fund performance appears to be dependent on the unique skills of the fund manager; however, clients are loath to stake their investments on the ability of a few individuals- they would rather see firm-wide success, attributable to a single philosophy and internal discipline;
* analysts who generate above-average returns often become sufficiently wealthy that they avoid corporate employment in favor of managing their personal portfolios.

===Representing the owners of shares===
Institutions often control huge shareholdings.  In most cases they are acting as fiduciary agents  rather than principals (direct owners). The owners of shares theoretically have great power to alter the companies via the voting rights the shares carry and the consequent ability to pressure managements, and if necessary out-vote them at annual and other meetings.

In practice, the ultimate owners of shares often do not exercise the power they collectively hold (because the owners are many, each with small holdings); financial institutions (as agents) sometimes do.  There is a general belief{{by whom|date=September 2011}} that shareholders – in this case, the institutions acting as agents—could and should exercise more active influence over the companies in which they hold shares (e.g., to hold managers to account, to ensure Board's effective functioning).  Such action would add a [[pressure group]] to those (the regulators and the Board) overseeing management.

However, there is the problem of how the institution should exercise this power. One way is for the institution to decide, the other is for the institution to poll its beneficiaries. Assuming that the institution polls, should it then: (i) Vote the entire holding as directed by the majority of votes cast? (ii) Split the vote (where this is allowed) according to the proportions of the vote? (iii) Or respect the abstainers and only vote the respondents' holdings?

The price signals generated by large active managers holding or not holding the stock may contribute to management change. For example, this is the case when a large active manager sells his position in a company, leading to (possibly) a decline in the stock price, but more importantly a loss of confidence by the markets in the management of the company, thus precipitating changes in the management team.

Some institutions have been more vocal and active in pursuing such matters; for instance, some firms believe that there are investment advantages to accumulating substantial minority shareholdings (i.e. 10% or more) and putting pressure on [[management]] to implement significant changes in the business.  In some cases, institutions with minority holdings work together to force management change.  Perhaps more frequent is the sustained pressure that large institutions bring to bear on management teams through persuasive discourse and PR. On the other hand, some of the largest investment managers—such as [[BlackRock]] and [[The Vanguard Group|Vanguard]]—advocate simply owning every company, reducing the incentive to influence management teams. A reason for this last strategy is that the investment manager prefers a closer, more open and honest relationship with a company's management team than would exist if they exercised control; allowing them to make a better investment decision.

The national context in which shareholder representation considerations are set is variable and important.  The USA is a litigious society and shareholders use the [[law]] as a lever to pressure management teams.  In Japan it is traditional for shareholders to be low in the 'pecking order,' which often allows management and labor to ignore the rights of the ultimate owners.  Whereas US firms generally cater to shareholders, Japanese businesses generally exhibit a ''stakeholder'' mentality, in which they seek consensus amongst all interested parties (against a background of strong [[trade union|unions]] and labour [[legislation]]).

==Size of the global fund management industry==

Conventional [[assets under management]] of the global fund management industry increased by 10% in 2010, to $79.3 trillion. [[Pension]] assets accounted for $29.9 trillion of the total, with $24.7 trillion invested in mutual funds and $24.6 trillion in insurance funds. Together with alternative assets (sovereign wealth funds, hedge funds, private equity funds and exchange traded funds) and funds of wealthy individuals, assets of the global fund management industry totalled around $117 trillion. Growth in 2010 followed a 14% increase in the previous year and was due both to the recovery in equity markets during the year and an inflow of new funds.

The US remained by far the biggest source of funds, accounting for around a half of conventional [[assets under management]] or some $36 trillion. The UK was the second largest centre in the world and by far the largest in Europe with around 8% of the global total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Fund Management: |publisher=[TheCityUK] |date=2011-10-05 |url=http://www.thecityuk.com/assets/Uploads/Fund-Management-2011.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy, process and people==

The 3-P's (Philosophy, Process and People) are often used to describe the reasons why the manager is able to produce above average results.

* '''Philosophy''' refers to the overarching beliefs of the investment organization.  For example: (i) Does the manager buy [[Growth investing|growth]] or value shares, or a combination of the two (and why)? (ii) Do they believe in market timing (and on what evidence)? (iii) Do they rely on external research or do they employ a team of researchers? It is helpful if any and all of such fundamental beliefs are supported by proof-statements.
* '''Process''' refers to the way in which the overall philosophy is implemented.  For example: (i) Which universe of assets is explored before particular assets are chosen as suitable investments? (ii) How does the manager decide what to buy and when? (iii) How does the manager decide what to sell and when? (iv) Who takes the decisions and are they taken by committee? (v) What controls are in place to ensure that a rogue fund (one very different from others and from what is intended) cannot arise?
* '''People''' refers to the staff, especially the fund managers.  The questions are, Who are they? How are they selected? How old are they? Who reports to whom? How deep is the team (and do all the members understand the philosophy and process they are supposed to be using)? And most important of all, How long has the team been working together?  This last question is vital because whatever performance record was presented at the outset of the relationship with the client may or may not relate to (have been produced by) a team that is still in place.  If the team has changed greatly (high staff turnover or changes to the team), then arguably the performance record is completely unrelated to the existing team (of fund managers).

==Investment managers and portfolio structures==
At the heart of the investment management industry are the managers who invest and divest client investments.

A certified company investment advisor should conduct an assessment of each client's individual needs and risk profile. The advisor then recommends appropriate investments.

===Asset allocation===

The different asset class definitions are widely debated, but four common divisions are [[stock]]s, [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], [[real estate]] and [[Commodity|commodities]]. The exercise of allocating funds among these assets (and among individual securities within each asset class) is  what investment management firms are paid for. Asset classes exhibit different market dynamics, and different interaction effects; thus, the allocation of money among asset classes will have a significant effect on the performance of the fund. Some research suggests that allocation among asset classes has more predictive power than the choice of individual holdings in determining portfolio return. Arguably, the skill of a successful investment manager resides in constructing the asset allocation, and separate individual holdings, so as to outperform certain benchmarks (e.g., the peer group of competing funds, bond and stock indices).

===Long-term returns===

It is important to look at the evidence on the long-term returns to different assets, and to holding period returns (the returns that accrue on average over different lengths of investment). For example, over very long holding periods (e.g. 10+ years) in most countries, equities have generated higher returns than bonds, and bonds have generated higher returns than cash.  According to financial theory, this is because equities are riskier (more volatile) than bonds which are themselves more risky than cash.

===Diversification===

Against the background of the asset allocation, fund managers consider the degree of [[Diversification (finance)|diversification]] that makes sense for a given client (given its risk preferences) and construct a list of planned holdings accordingly.  The list will indicate what percentage of the fund should be invested in each particular stock or bond.  The theory of portfolio diversification was originated by Markowitz (and many others). Effective diversification requires management of the correlation between the asset returns and the liability returns, issues internal to the portfolio (individual holdings volatility), and [[cross-correlation]]s between the returns.

==Investment styles==

There are a range of different [[investment style|styles]] of fund management that the institution can implement. For example, [[Growth investing|growth]], value, growth at a reasonable price (GARP), [[market neutral]], small capitalisation, indexed, etc.  Each of these approaches has its distinctive features, adherents and, in any particular financial environment, distinctive risk characteristics.  For example, there is evidence that [[Growth investing|growth]] styles (buying rapidly growing earnings) are especially effective when the companies able to generate such growth are scarce; conversely, when such growth is plentiful, then there is evidence that value styles tend to outperform the indices particularly successfully.

Large asset managers are increasingly profiling their equity portfolio managers to trade their orders more effectively. While this strategy is less effective with small-cap trades, it has been effective for portfolios with large-cap companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Portfolio Management Profiling|url=http://fixglobal.com/home/portfolio-management-profiling/|publisher=Global Trading|accessdate=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance measurement==

Fund performance is often thought to be the acid test of fund management, and in the institutional context, accurate measurement is a necessity.  For that purpose, institutions measure the performance of each fund (and usually for internal purposes components of each fund) under their management, and performance is also measured by external firms that specialize in performance measurement.  The leading performance measurement firms (e.g. [[Russell Investment Group|Frank Russell]] in the US or BI-SAM [http://www.bi-sam.com] in Europe) compile aggregate industry data, e.g., showing how funds in general performed against given indices and peer groups over various time periods.

In a typical case (let us say an equity fund), then the calculation would be made (as far as the client is concerned) every quarter and would show a percentage change compared with the prior quarter (e.g., +4.6% total return in US dollars).  This figure would be compared with other similar funds managed within the institution (for purposes of monitoring internal controls), with performance data for peer group funds, and with relevant indices (where available) or tailor-made performance benchmarks where appropriate.  The specialist performance measurement firms calculate quartile and decile data and close attention would be paid to the (percentile) ranking of any fund.

Generally speaking, it is probably appropriate for an investment firm to persuade its clients to assess performance over longer periods (e.g., 3 to 5 years) to smooth out very short-term fluctuations in performance and the influence of the business cycle.  This can be difficult however and, industry wide, there is a serious preoccupation with short-term numbers and the effect on the relationship with clients (and resultant business risks for the institutions).

An enduring problem is whether to measure before-tax or after-tax performance. After-tax measurement represents the benefit to the investor, but investors' tax positions may vary. Before-tax measurement can be misleading, especially in regimens that tax realised capital gains (and not unrealised). It is thus possible that successful active managers (measured before tax) may produce miserable after-tax results. One possible solution is to report the after-tax position of some standard taxpayer.

===Risk-adjusted performance measurement===

Performance measurement should not be reduced to the evaluation of fund returns alone, but must also integrate other fund elements that would be of interest to investors, such as the measure of risk taken. Several other aspects are also part of performance measurement: evaluating if managers have succeeded in reaching their objective, i.e. if their return was sufficiently high to reward the risks taken; how they compare to their peers; and finally whether the portfolio management results were due to luck or the manager's skill. The need to answer all these questions has led to the development of more sophisticated performance measures, many of which originate in [[modern portfolio theory]].  Modern portfolio theory established the quantitative link that exists between portfolio risk and return. The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) developed by Sharpe (1964) highlighted the notion of rewarding risk and produced the first performance indicators, be they risk-adjusted ratios (Sharpe ratio, information ratio) or differential returns compared to benchmarks (alphas). The Sharpe ratio is the simplest and best known performance measure. It measures the return of a portfolio in excess of the risk-free rate, compared to the total risk of the portfolio. This measure is said to be absolute, as it does not refer to any benchmark, avoiding drawbacks related to a poor choice of benchmark. Meanwhile, it does not allow the separation of the performance of the market in which the portfolio is invested from that of the manager. The information ratio is a more general form of the Sharpe ratio in which the risk-free asset is replaced by a benchmark portfolio. This measure is relative, as it evaluates portfolio performance in reference to a benchmark, making the result strongly dependent on this benchmark choice.

Portfolio alpha is obtained by measuring the difference between the return of the portfolio and that of a benchmark portfolio. This measure appears to be the only reliable performance measure to evaluate active management. In fact, we have to distinguish between normal returns, provided by the fair reward for portfolio exposure to different risks, and obtained through passive management, from abnormal performance (or outperformance) due to the manager's skill (or luck), whether through [[market timing]], [[stock picking]], or good fortune. The first component is related to allocation and style investment choices, which may not be under the sole control of the manager, and depends on the economic context, while the second component is an evaluation of the success of the manager's decisions. Only the latter, measured by alpha, allows the evaluation of the manager's true performance (but then, only if you assume that any outperformance is due to skill and not luck).

Portfolio return may be evaluated using factor models. The first model, proposed by Jensen (1968), relies on the [[Capital asset pricing model|CAPM]] and explains portfolio returns with the market index as the only factor. It quickly becomes clear, however, that one factor is not enough to explain the returns very well and that other factors have to be considered. Multi-factor models were developed as an alternative to the [[Capital asset pricing model|CAPM]], allowing a better description of portfolio risks and a more accurate evaluation of a portfolio's performance. For example, Fama and French (1993) have highlighted two important factors that characterize a company's risk in addition to market risk. These factors are the book-to-market ratio and the company's size as measured by its market capitalization. Fama and French therefore proposed  three-factor model to describe portfolio normal returns ([[Fama–French three-factor model]]). Carhart (1997) proposed to add momentum as a fourth factor to allow the short-term persistence of returns to be taken into account. Also of interest for performance measurement is Sharpe's (1992) [[returns-based style analysis|style analysis]] model, in which factors are style indices. This model allows a custom benchmark for each portfolio to be developed, using the linear combination of style indices that best replicate portfolio style allocation, and leads to an accurate evaluation of portfolio alpha.

==Education or certification==
Increasingly, international [[business school]]s are incorporating the subject into their course outlines and some have formulated the title of 'Investment Management' or 'Asset Management' conferred as specialist [[bachelor's degree]]s (e.g. [[Cass Business School, London]]). &lt;!-- Due to global cross-recognition agreements with the 2 major accrediting agencies [[AACSB]] and [[ACBSP]] which accredit over 560 of the best business school programs, the Certification of MFP Master Financial Planner Professional from the [[American Academy of Financial Management]] is available to AACSB and ACBSP business school graduates with finance or financial services-related concentrations.--&gt;  For those with aspirations to become an investment manager, further education may be needed beyond a bachelors in business, finance, or economics. Designations, such as the Chartered Investment Manager (CIM) in Canada, are required for practitioners in the investment management industry. A graduate degree or an investment qualification such as the [[Chartered Financial Analyst]] designation (CFA) may help in having a career in investment management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Should You Get A CFA, MBA Or Both?|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/investopedia/2013/05/30/should-you-get-a-cfa-mba-or-both/|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that any particular qualification enhances the most desirable characteristic of an investment manager, that is the ability to select investments that result in an above average (risk weighted) long-term performance.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

'''Jahangir Fevzi oglu Hajiyev''' ({{lang-az|Cahangir Fevzi oğlu Hacıyev}}, {{IPA-tr|d͡ʒɑhɑŋɟir fɛvzi ɔɣlu hɑd͡ʒəjɪf|}}; born 26 October 1961) is an [[Azerbaijan people|Azerbaijani]] convicted [[fraudster]] and former banker. He was the chairman of the [[International Bank of Azerbaijan]] from 2001 until he resigned in March 2015 citing health concerns. On 14 October 2016, the [[Baku]] Court for Grave Crimes sentenced Hajiyev to 15 years on charges of fraud, embezzlement, and missappropriation of public funds.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.usacc.org/about-us/leadership/board-of-directors/32-jahangir-hajiyev.html|title = Jahangir Hajiyev|accessdate = 28 March 2014|website = United States - Azerbaijan Chamber of Commerce|publisher = USACC|location = Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Hajiyev attended [[Baku State University|Azerbaijan State University]] and graduated in 1986.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1993, he earned an MBA at the [[University of Texas at Austin]], and was awarded a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in International Economics from the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Institute of Economics, Russian Academy of Sciences]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.weforum.org/contributors/jahangir-hajiyev|title = Jahangir Hajiyev|accessdate = 28 March 2014|website = World Economic Forum|publisher = World Economic Forum|location = Geneva, Switzerland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Hajiyev worked in the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations of Azerbaijan from 1993 to 1995.

He joined the [[International Bank of Azerbaijan]] in 1995. In an interview with the Azerbaijan Press Agency (APA) Hajiyev noted that the optimal number of banks in Azerbaijan must be 20 and said "I always supported market regulation. The banks that want to increase authorized capital will do that, because this is important for banks which need high positions".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Jahangir Hajiyev: Azerbaijan must have 20 banks as an optimal degree|date = 16 November 2012|url = http://en.apa.az/news_jahangir_hajiyev_____azerbaijan_must_have__182668.html|accessdate = 28 March 2014|newspaper = APA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal charges==
Jahangir Hajiyev, along with 7 other persons, was accused of embezzling public funds amounting to 211.59 million AZN (125 million euros)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.intellinews.com/ex-head-of-azerbaijan-s-largest-bank-embezzled-125mn-finds-investigation-100557/|title=Ex-head of Azerbaijan’s largest bank embezzled €125mn, finds investigation|access-date=2017-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; under articles #178.3.2 and 179.1 of the Azerbaijan's Criminal Code. On December 5, 2015, an Azerbaijani court detained Jahangir Hajiyev for crimes of fraud and misappropriation of public funds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.apa.az/xeber_iba_former_head_jahangir_hajiyev_jailed__235999.html IBA former head jailed for three months - UPDATED]&lt;/ref&gt; He faced charges under Articles 179.3.1 and 179.3.2 (misappropriation of a large amount of money by an organised group), 308.2 (abuse of official powers resulting in serious consequences), 309.2 (exceeding officials powers resulting in serious consequences), 313 (service forgery), and 228.1 and 228.4 (illegal acquisition, transfer, selling, storage, transportation or carrying of a weapon, its accessories, ammunition or explosives) of the Criminal Code of Azerbaijan.

On October 14, 2016, a Baku court sentenced former chairman of the board of the International Bank of Azerbaijan (IBA) Jahangir Hajiyev to 15 years imprisonment for grave crimes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.interfax.com/newsinf.asp?pg=2&amp;id=708549| Ex-chairman of Azerbaijan's largest bank sentenced to 15 yrs' imprisonment&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the Court decided that Mr Hajiyev had to pay 63 million AZN (to Azerbaijan International Bank and 7 million AZN to Agro-credit CJSC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irfs.org/news-feed/former-head-of-international-bank-jahangir-hajiyev-sentenced-to-15-years-in-jail/|title=IRFS  {{!}}  Former Head of International Bank Jahangir Hajiyev sentenced to 15 Years in Jail|website=www.irfs.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the findings of the Court, as a result of Jahangir Hajiyev’s criminal activity of money laundering more than 9 billion dollars were laundered from the financial turnover of Azerbaijan.

This is considered to be one of the factors that caused a drop in macroeconomic indicators of the country, since the laundered amount makes up approximately 25% of Azerbaijan's average GDP for 2016/2017&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://haqqin.az/oldage/111159|title=Один Джаник отмыл целый бюджет Азербайджана - Hominem te memento!|access-date=2017-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Reportedly, after being allocated by the bank, money was almost completely laundered and transferred abroad to the personal accounts of Hajiyev, his relatives and counterparts.

According to the facts of the case, the most frequently used scheme was issuing of non-refundable loans for fictional expenses or fictional income projects. For the laundering scheme shell companies were established both in Azerbaijan and abroad (mainly in offshore jurisdictions). And as security for loans fictional pledges (bills of exchange, guarantees) were presented&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://haqqin.az/news/111252|title=Гаджиев, он же Джаник – анатомия мошенничества - куда ушли миллиарды?|access-date=2017-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Hajiyev and his lawyers declined all the crime charges and indicated that all bank loans were given under the permission of Central Bank and Ministry of Finance.

==Personal life==
He is married to [[Zamira Hajiyeva]], the first person to receive an [[Unexplained Wealth Order]], under a new UK anti-corruption law.&lt;ref name=BBC45812210&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-45812210|title=Woman who spent £16m in Harrods revealed|first=Dominic|last=Casciani|date=10 October 2018|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Jeff Goodby grew up in Rhode Island. He graduated from [[Harvard University]] where he wrote for [[Harvard Lampoon|The Harvard Lampoon]]. Goodby became interested in advertising after not being able to find work in publishing. Goodby fashioned a resume in the likes of a mock encyclopedia entry on himself – written posthumously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inc.com/magazine/20040701/howididit.html |title=How I Did It: Jeff Goodby, Leading Your Company Article - Inc.

'''Kanji Kitamura''' (born November 1955) is the founder of Bagel K, a Japanese company that imports and distributes of New York-style [[bagel]]s to Japan. Kitamura was the first kosher bagel importer in Japan.  Bagel K imports 3 million bagels from New York every year.

==Activities==
Kitamura in 1989 brought [[Kosher]] [[bagel]]s from [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]] to Japan and had remarkable success in expanding the bagel business nationwide in Japan as ''[[Forbes]]'' introduced.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/forbes/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kitamura tried to bring in [[Bialy (pastry)|Bialy]] but Japanese have not accepted it until 2013.
Food distributors call Kitamura the "Bagel King" because he is the first person to bring Jewish bagels to Japan.
In 1980, he lived in the U.S. for five years and lived with a Jewish family which inspired him with the idea to bring authentic bagels to Japan.
When he brought the first Bagel to Japan, most food retailers rejected it because Japanese preferred their food soft.
Kitamura arduously explained how to eat bagels to each individual consumer and traveled to all the major cities in Japan. The first year, he exported 100,000 bagels and three years later sold 1 million bagels in Japan.  Within his first five years, his bagel sales reached 3 million.  Japanese discovered the chewy and heavy body texture of the bagel's bread after Kitamura's promotional trips throughout Japan.

''[[Forbes]]'', [[Kosher Today]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koshertoday.com/news/]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Food Distribution Magazine]]'' all selected Kitamura as the Japanese food distributor who creates unique flavored bagels.  Kitamura, who has never made products in Japan, always seeks a way to satisfy Japanese consumer demand, even by searching overseas.  Kitamura said that the manufacturer knows how to make a good product, while he knows what the Japanese consumer wants.  Kitimura's philosophy is that if he were to manufacture something, he would be unable to devote time to tracking consumer demand in 2012

Kitamura coordinated a [[Thanksgiving]] party through the [[Japan-America Society]] of Osaka and introduces American food to Japan annually at the Osaka Mayor's official residence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.city.osaka.lg.jp/seisakukikakushitsu/page/0000191934.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kitamura also volunteers time for the anti-drug abuse campaign in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www8.cao.go.jp/souki/drug.html]&lt;/ref&gt; He has spent time and effort to prevent drug use among youths and help create a sound upbringing for youth.  In fact, a drug and especially MDMA is target to grade school children in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.narconon.org/drug-information/ecstasy-addiction.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kitamura found Japan America Society of Nara in 2016. It is 31st Japan America Society in Japan.

==History==

The first issue of Middle East Economic Digest (MEED) was published on 8 March 1957.

MEED's founder and driving force for the next two decades was Elizabeth Collard, a champion of Arab causes who was to become an adviser to UK Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]] on Middle East affairs and a friend of [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] of Egypt and [[King Hussein of Jordan]]. She also helped to establish the Council for the Advancement of Arab British Understanding ([[CAABU]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meed.com/sectors/economy/looking-back-elizabeth-collard-and-the-birth-of-meed/1076708.article '&amp;#39;Elizabeth Collard and the birth of MEED – MEED'&amp;#39;]. Meed.com (30 June 2007). Retrieved on 6 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

With two part-time secretarial assistants, MEED was produced on a hand-cranked [[Ronco]] printing machine. Every Friday evening, friends and relatives would help staple and stuff envelopes with the 12-page newsletter. Lacking any editorial resources, the Middle East Economic Digest was a compilation from newspapers and other reports. Newspapers were flown in weekly from [[Cairo]] and [[Beirut]], translated and condensed.

By the time MEED was acquired by Emap in 1986, it had a staff of 20 full-time journalists and 12 researchers and newsroom assistants to cover Middle Eastern business and project news. In 2006 Emap Middle East also acquired business website [[AME Info]].

In March 2012, the owning company rebranded as Top Right Group, but retained the Emap name for its magazines operation, which at the time accounted for around 18 percent of the group's turnover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/media/9171753/Emap-to-change-name-to-Top-Right-Group-and-split-into-three.html|title=Emap to change name to Top Right Group and split into three|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=28 March 2012|accessdate=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015 Top Right Group announced it was scrapping the Emap brand and would stop producing print editions and that, over the next 12–18 months, all titles would become digital only.&lt;ref name=Sweney&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sweney|first1=Mark|title=Emap brand to be scrapped as all its titles move digital-only|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/oct/05/emap-brand-print-top-right-drapers-retail-week|accessdate=6 October 2015|work=The Guardian|date=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2015 Top Right Group rebranded as [[Ascential]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fipp.com/news/industrynews/top-right-group-rebrands-to-ascential|title=Top Right Group rebrands to Ascential|date=15 December 2015|publisher=Fipp|accessdate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; who, in January 2017, announced its intention to sell 13 titles including MEED; the 13 "heritage titles" were to be "hived off into a separate business while buyers are sought."&lt;ref name="Williams-6Jan2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Williams|first1=Christopher|title=Ascential puts Drapers and Nursing Times up for sale in break with trade publishing|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2017/01/05/ascential-puts-drapers-nursing-times-sale-break-trade-publishing/|accessdate=6 January 2017|work=Telegraph|date=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sweney-5Jan2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sweney|first1=Mark|title=Ascential to sell Drapers and Nursing Times as it ditches 'heritage' brands|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/jan/05/ascential-drapers-nursing-times-emap-retail-week|accessdate=6 January 2017|work=The Guardian|date=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 December 2017, MEED was purchased from [[Ascential]] in a $17.5m cash deal by [[GlobalData]], the London-listed company formerly known as Progressive Digital Media.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.digitallook.com/news/news-and-announcements/globaldata-buy-meed-as-ascential-completes-heritage-brand-sales--3019480.html '&amp;#39;GlobalData buy MEED as Ascential completes 'heritage brand' sales'&amp;#39;]. digitallook.com (8 December 2017). Retrieved on 9 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bernard Cragg]], executive chairman of [[GlobalData]], stated: "MEED gives the Group the opportunity to further expand into a key region and adds an additional industry vertical to our offering whilst maintaining our disciplined investment criteria of premium proprietary content and strong renewable subscription based revenues."

[[File:MTN logo.png|thumb|MTN logo]]
MTN Group, a major multi-national telecom company based in [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]], was handed down a $5.2 billion [[Fine (penalty)|fine]] by the [[Federal Government of Nigeria]] through the [[Nigerian Communications Commission]] (NCC). The commission exercised section 20(1) of the Telephone Subscribers regulation (TSR) law on MTN, for not meeting the deadline set up by the [[Mobile network operator]]s (MNOs) for disconnecting the Subscribers Identification Modules (SIM) with improper registration. The [[Quality audit|compliance audit]] carried out by the NCC on MTN network revealed unregistered 5.2&amp;nbsp;million customers lines un-deactivated. This led to the NCC fining MTN with the sum of $1000 for each unregistered SIM, which amounted to $5.2bn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngrguardiannews.com/2015/10/mtn-in-talks-with-ncc-over-n1-04tr-fine-on-telecoms-firm/|title=MTN in talks with NCC over N1.04tr fine on telecoms firm|work=Guardian Newspaper |author=Adeyemi Adepetun|accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/mtn-ceo-dabengwa-resigns-after-5-2bn-nigeria-fine/225138/|title=MTN CEO Dabengwa Resigns After $5.2bn Nigeria Fine|work=Thisday Live|accessdate=28 December 2015}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

What followed was major resignations among the top echelon of the organisation including the chief executive officer, Sifiso Dabengwa, the Head of Nigeria Operation, Micheal Ikpoki and the Head of Cooperate Affairs, Akinwale Goodluck being replaced with Phuthuma Nhleko, Ferdi Moolman and Amina Oyegbola as new chairman, managing director and Head of Corporate and Regulation respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngrguardiannews.com/2015/12/mtn-nigeria-ceo-resigns-as-fg-slashes-fine-to-n674b/|title=MTN Nigeria CEO resigns as FG slashes fine to N674b|work=Guardian Newspaper|author=Tonye Bakare|accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new management employed a diplomatic measure between the government of the [[South Africa|Republic of South Africa]] and its Nigerian counterpart to ameliorate the burden of the liabilities from the fine. This action brought about the reduction of the liability to $3.2&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/mtn-shares-plummet-for-second-day-on-ncc-fine/223958/|title=MTN Shares Plummet for Second Day on NCC Fine|work=THIS DAY LIVE|author=Emma Okonji|accessdate=26 December 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151030203840/http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/mtn-shares-plummet-for-second-day-on-ncc-fine/223958|archivedate=30 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.bbc.com/news/business-34696777|title=MTN seeks to reduce $5.2bn Nigerian fine|work=bbc news|accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The registration of SIM cards started in the year 2010, the initial phase of this project was handled by the Mobile Network Operators (MNOs). However, NCC took over these operations because the service providers could not meet up with the six months earmarked by NCC. The registration by NCC started in March 2011 and it was anchored by seven consultants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngrguardiannews.com/2015/08/mtn-claims-n10b-expenses-on-sim-registration/|title=MTN claims N10b expenses on SIM registration|work=Guardian Newspaper|author=Adeyemi Adepetun|accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities that led to the penalty ==

In 2010 the Nigerian government through the [[National Security Advisor (Nigeria)|National Security Adviser]], other securities agencies and the NCC initiated that all SIM-cards across all mobile networks in the country should be registered. The primary objective of this project is to reduce security challenges facing the country by criminals using mobile phones to perpetuate kidnapping, robbery and other criminal activities. This exercise is in line with Section 20(1) of Registration of Telephone Subscribers Regulations (TSR) 2011 which states that: "Any licensee who activates or fails to deactivate a subscription medium in violation of any provision of these Regulations is liable to a penalty of N200,000.00 for each unregistered but activated subscription medium." &lt;ref name="Odunsi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailypost.ng/2015/11/17/mtn-ncc-gives-full-explanation-on-n1trn-fine-sets-friday-deadline/|title=MTN: NCC gives full explanation on N1trn fine, sets Friday deadline|work=Daily Post|author=Wale Odunsi|accessdate=28 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, following the regulation the NCC directed all MNOs to deactivate newly registered lines that remain inactive for 48 hours after registration. In August 2015, NCC and securities agencies carried out a compliance audit on all of the MNOs networks. Contrary to the TSR, the audit revealed 5.2&amp;nbsp;million customer lines in MTN were improperly registered. [[Sahara Reporters]] claimed that the NCC and security agencies informed the public during a press conference held on 18 August 2015, that the expiration of the 7-day deactivation deadline ends on 11 August 2015. MTN failed to fully deactivate any subscribers and following repeated warnings and compliance enforcement visits by the responsible authorities only made a partial attempt to bar unregistered subscribers in selected areas over a few days in September 2015. Other operators had fully complied and reconciled their deactivations with the invalid registrations shared by the NCC up to 4 weeks earlier. The consequence of MTN's refusal to comply with the directive is even more pronounced as half of all the invalid registrations shared by the NCC belongs to MTN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saharareporters.com/2015/10/27/how-big-and-rich-mtn-walked-outlaw-path-52bn-fine-nigeria|title=How Big And Rich MTN Walked The Outlaw Path Into $5.2bn Fine in Nigeria|work=Sahara Reporter|accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a related development, the [[House of Representatives (Nigeria)|house of representatives]] committee on telecommunications, headed by Saheed Akinade Fijabi to investigate the abuse among the MNOs in complying with the registration of SIM cards in the country.&lt;ref name="MTN"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ngrguardiannews.com/2015/10/mtn-gets-deadline-to-pay-n1-04-trillion-fine/|title=MTN gets deadline to pay N1.04&amp;nbsp;trillion fine|work=Guardian Newspaper|author=Adeyemi Adepetun|accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter addressed to NCC on 2 November 2015, MTN admitted wrongdoing for their role of 5.2&amp;nbsp;million improperly registered SIMs after the NCC deadline on the network and also pleaded for mercy. NCC acknowledged the letter from MTN, but said the decision on the penalty is final, but the deadline for payment could be shifted to accommodate the position of each party.&lt;ref name="Odunsi" /&gt;

==Post penalty activities==

In October 2015, NCC made the pronouncement to penalise MTN for their inability to disconnect 5.2&amp;nbsp;million unregistered subscribers on its network. According to the TSR signed by all stakeholders in the telecommunications industry, any erring MNO shall be charged with N200,000 or $1000 per unregistered SIM on their network after the deadline for the registration. Subsequently, the commission demanded the sum of $5.2billion being the total amount payable by MTN for their role in improper SIM registration, to be paid on or before 16 November 2015. In a swift move to pacify its shareholders, MTN published a press release on the same day of the pronouncement that the deadline for the payment of the penalty fee of the $5.2bn (16 November 2015) will not be effected by the commission until the end of the negotiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nigeriannewspapers.today/2015/11/16/nigeria-extends-mtns-5-2bn-fine-payment/|title=Nigeria extends MTN's $5.2bn fine payment|work=Guardian Newspaper|accessdate=28 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the strategy to re-stabilize the organisation, Phuthuma Nhleko, was appointed in temporary capacity as the Chairman of the organisation over the next 6 months. This action follows the resignation of Sifiso Dabengwa, the CEO of the organisation.

A group of concerned Nigerian based in Abuja, said the action taking by the FGN is a slap on the fundamental human right and breach of our Nigeria constitutions. Timipa Okponipere, the lawyer to the applicant believe the action is not only a breached of Nigeria Constitution but an attempt by NCC to conspire with MTN to cheat Nigerians of our common wealth. He said, if the decision is not pursue to a logical end it would amount to mere academic exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/more-news/194801-nigerians-sue-ncc-for-reducing-mtns-n1-04-trn-fine.html|title=Nigerians sue NCC for reducing MTN's N1.04 trn fine|work=Premium times|author=Bassey Udo|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==MTN engages ex US attorney general==

MTN has engaged the service of Mr. [[Eric Holder]], a former US attorney general to intervene in the ongoing slam of $5.2bn fine on the telecommunications company, which was subsequently reduces to $3.9 by the Nigerian government through NCC after much persuasion. He was hired by the MTN group because of his experience in corporate settlement.He served as US attorney general between the year 2009–2015. According to report by [[Financial Times]] Holder visited [[Abuja]], the [[federal capital territory]], Nigeria in January 2016 to meet with the official of NCC to challenge the fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/1022636e-c991-11e5-be0b-b7ece4e953a0.html#axzz3zB7DAM3P|title=MTN hires ex-US attorney-general Eric Holder to fight $3.9bn fine|author=William Wals &amp; Andrew England|work=Financial Times|accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailypost.ng/2016/02/03/3-9b-fine-mtn-hires-ex-u-s-attorney-general-to-challenge-ncc/|title=$3.9b fine: MTN hires ex-U.S attorney general to challenge NCC|author=Daniel Ogbeche|work=Daily post|accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==FG sets condition for out-of-court settlement==

The FGN through the minister of communication, Mr. [[Abdur-Raheem Adebayo Shittu|Adebayo Shittu]] on 26 January 2016, gave conditions to be met by MTN before FGN can agree to out-of-court settlement of the litigation made against the government by the communication firm. The case remains in court as at this date( February 2016). The minister requested that the case can be settled as per MTN request only if the communication firm withdraw the case from court and also if the president, [[Muhammadu Buhari]] approves a new deal for settlement. The minister said "As far as we are concerned, there can be no out-of-court settlement except the case is withdrawn from the court so that the government will not be put under pressure. If the case is out of court and if they make further moves, Mr. President may graciously make a decision. But now, I am not aware of any out-of-court settlement talks.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.punchng.com/fg-gives-conditions-for-out-of-court-settlement-with-mtn/|title=FG gives conditions for out-of-court settlement with MTN|author=Everest Amaefule|work=The Punch News|accessdate=9 February 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216180246/http://www.punchng.com/fg-gives-conditions-for-out-of-court-settlement-with-mtn/|archivedate=16 February 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another development, it was reported that the FGN is not ready to shift ground for the out-of-court settlement by MTN.

Measurement Assisted Assembly For Large Volume Aircraft Wing Structures. in 4th International Conference on Digital Enterprise Technology. 2007. Bath, United Kingdom. p. 426-434&lt;/ref&gt; is any method of assembly in which measurements are used to guide assembly processes. Such processes include:
* '''Predictive fettling/shimming'''&lt;ref&gt;Kayani, A. and I. Gray, Shim for Arrangement Against a Structural Component and a Method of Making a Shim. 2009, Patent US20080211185 20080916, Airbus UK Ltd&lt;/ref&gt; in which component measurements are used to predict gaps and interferences prior to assembly, and these predictions are used to enable a right-first-time assembly
* '''Assemble-Measure-Move''' ('''AMM''')&lt;ref&gt;Muelaner, J.E., A. Kayani, O. Martin, and P.G. Maropoulos. Measurement Assisted Assembly and the Roadmap to Part-To-Part Assembly. in 7th International Conference on Digital Enterprise Technology. 2011. Athens, Greece, Available from http://www.muelaner.com/research/MADA/MAA_and_Roadmap_to_Part-To-Part.html&lt;/ref&gt; processes where a component is positioned approximately in an assembly, the position of the component is measured and then it is moved towards its specified position. This process may be iterated a number of times before the component is within its specified position, alternatively 'real time' measurements may be used to 'track' the component into location.
* '''Active tooling''' is a form of [[Fixture (tool)|assembly fixture]] which does not rely on inherent dimensional stability to provide an accurate location for components but rather uses frequent measurements to facilitate in active compensation.
* '''[[Control theory|Closed loop control]]''' of assembly automation in order to improve the accuracy of flexible automation systems such as [[industrial robots]].&lt;ref&gt;Summers, M., Robot Capability Test and Development of Industrial Robot Positioning System for the Aerospace Industry, in AeroTech Congress &amp; Exhibition. 2005, SAE International: Grapevine,Texas. p. 1-13&lt;/ref&gt;
Measurement-assisted assembly is typically used for large structures such as [[Airframe|aircraft]] and [[Fabrication (metal)|steel fabrications]]. It can be used to improve production rates, reduce reworking and increase flexibility for processes where manual reworking during assembly is required to maintain assembly form and component interface conditions. This type of approach generally offers no advantages where [[Interchangeable parts|part-to-part interchangeability]] can already be achieved.

== SHE-Y by Menaye ==
Menaye developed and founded the luxury Italian brand SHE-Y. The brand launched its first all-natural products early in 2016 using ethically-sourced [[Shea butter]] from [[Ghana]]. Her brand plays a part in her charity work by creating more job opportunities in Shea Butter production. A percentage of sales profit of SHE-Y is donated towards Menaye Charity Organization to help educate less fortunate children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.menaye.org/charity/|title=Menaye Donkor Official Website|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philanthropist ==
Menaye founded the Menaye Charity Organization in 2004 contributing towards the welfare of underprivileged children through providing free quality education in Ghana. Donkor has worked tirelessly for over a decade to improve the lives of women and children in her home country Ghana through the Menaye Charity Organization. The Organisation provides free quality basic education and scholarships to rural underprivileged children in Ghana, health care and the developmental of young girls. She is solely responsible for raising funds to support the organization.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/diaspora/Menaye-Donkor-shares-her-passion-for-giving-back-519539|title=Menaye Donkor shares her passion for giving back|website=www.ghanaweb.com|language=en|access-date=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Menaye School of Hope ===
The school was founded on 7 September 2000 in the central region of [[Ghana]]. Menaye Donkor adopted the school in 2004 after winning Miss Universe Ghana to help build a better environment for the children as the original school lacked in basic necessities.

The school is located in Agona Asafo, which is considered one of the most deprived regions of the country, with high poverty and extreme illiteracy rates. Having started with 78 pupils sharing one school block, the school now has over 400 children and three blocks, helping students achieve excellent results in their [[BECE]] (pre-secondary school) examinations. The Menaye Charity Organisation funds everything for the school, from the buildings and equipment to the teachers’ salaries, as well as uniforms, books and stationery.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Awards ==
In September 2012, Menaye was honored and chosen by the Chief and elders, of Agona Asafo in the Central Region of Ghana, to be the ‘Nkosuohemaa’ or ‘Development Queen’ of Agona Asafo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/entertainment/Sulley-Muntari-s-Wife-Now-Nkosuohemaa-of-Agona-Asafo-250164|title=Ghana Web|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her official title is Nanahemaa Menaye Afumade Afrakoma I.

In [[U.S. antitrust law]], the phrase "'''merger doctrine'''" is used to broadly describe the approaches that courts have taken to address [[Mergers and acquisitions|mergers]] between [[corporation]]s which might tend to reduce [[Competition (economics)|competition]] and raise prices. More specifically, courts tend to make separate discussions of a ''horizontal merger doctrine'' (where direct competitors merge) and ''vertical merger doctrine'' (where a company merges with its own suppliers and distributors, cutting them off from supplying or distributing to competitors).

Nigerian Telecommunications Limited, or '''NITEL''', was a monopoly telephone service provider in [[Nigeria]] until 1992 when the [[Federal government of Nigeria|Nigerian government]] enacted the [[Nigerian Communications Commission]] act allowing new entrants into the telecommunications sector. During and after its years of monopoly, performance of the firm was sub-par, a behavior similar to other state owned enterprises such as [[Power Holding Company of Nigeria|NEPA]] and government owned water corporations. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/183263320|title=Telecommunications research trends|last=Onwumechili|first=Chuka|date=2008|publisher=Nova Science Publishers|others=Ulrich, Hans F., Lehrmann, Ernst P.|year=|isbn=9781604561586|location=New York|pages=144-150|chapter=Chapter 8. Nigeria:Reviving a Former Monopoly in A rapidly Evolving Market|oclc=183263320}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm was formed in 1985 as the welding together of two government entities, the telecoms arm of the Post and Telecommunications (P&amp;T) department under the Ministry of Communications and the Nigerian External Communications (NET)

Looking from 1958 to the arrival of Global Satellite system communication (GSM) in Nigeria; NITEL was able to provide 450,000 subscriber lines for a population of 120 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nigeria phone privatisation off|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7251154.stm|website=BBC News|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2008 a report by [[BBC News]] said that the Nigerian government assumed the transnational corporation did not improve performance of NITEL and therefore stopped privatization in favour of [[Transcorp]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} In 2015, the government eventually finalized a transaction that saw NITEL and Mtel's assets to NATCOM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcworld.com/article/2913072/nigerian-govt-hands-over-nitel-mtel-assets-to-natcom.html "Nigerian gov't hands over Nitel, Mtel assets to NATCOM"], ''PC World'', 21 April 2015. Accessed 3 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The deal was valued at $252 million.

Another Nigeria Telecom Company (Ntel) was launched In April which took the place of Nitel, Ntel is the newest reincarnation of the now defunct telecoms company, NITEL. The Nigerian government handed over '''NITEL/Mtel''' assets over to NATCOM (Ntel’s parent company) in a deal worth $252 million last year. In November 2017, Nitel appointed Nate James as vice president of account management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.channelpartnersonline.com/2017/11/06/nitel-adds-windstream-vet-as-account-management-vp/|title=Nitel Adds Windstream Vet as Account Management VP|website=www.channelpartnersonline.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Post and Telecommunications Department (P&amp;T) ===
During colonial rule and until 1985, the Post and Telecommunications department provided [[Mail|mailing]] and internal telecommunication services between Nigerian cities while NET provided telecommunications services between selected Nigerian cities and foreign countries. Due to resource constraints, provision of services were planned in phases&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.africa.upenn.edu/ECA/aisi_inftl.html|title=Telecommunications in Nigeria|last=Alabi|first=|date=March 1986|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with expansion more pronounced between the 1950s and 1970s. 

Telegraph services began in the 1880s and was initially managed by the Public Works Department until 1907 when those services were transferred to P &amp; T.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Neusman|first=Dan|date=August 1973|title=Technical Review Supplement. Telecommunications Development in Nigeria|url=|journal=Nigerian Business Digest|volume=|pages=29-35|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, a manual telephone exchange with a [[Telephone magneto|magneto switchboard]] of 100 lines was introduced in [[Lagos]] and by 1920 the estimate of telephone lines in the country was 920, at 920. A year later, a multiple [[Telephone switchboard|switchboard]] was introduced with a capacity for 800 lines and in 1941 a [[Point-to-point (telecommunications)|point to point]] connection with a [[teleprinter]] was introduced. In the 1950s, planned investments were launched that included expanding [[Telephone exchange|automatic telephone exchanges]] and [[Trunking|trunk circuits]], launching a Lagos to Port Harcourt [[Microwave transmission|microwave radio transmission]] route and introducing [[Very high frequency|V.H.F]]. multi-channel radio transmission to more cities and towns. In 1961, they were more than 32,000 telephones line and 120 telephone exchanges.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Investments in telecommunications moved the subscriber base to over 100,000 by 1973 and up to 400,000 by 1990.

=== Nigerian External Telecommunications ===
The history of NET can be traced to [[Colonisation of Africa|colonial rule]] towards the end of the nineteenth century. In 1886, a telegraph service between Lagos and London was provided by African Direct Telegraph Company, this company later became Imperial and International Communications after a merger and then Cable and Wireless.  Upon independence, the government of Nigerian decided to go into a partnership with [[Cable &amp; Wireless plc|Cable and Wireless]], acquiring interest in the Nigerian arm of Cable and Wireless, and renaming the company Nigerian External Telecommunications.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=June 1982|title=NET Today|url=|journal=Nigerian Enterprises|volume=2|pages=9-12|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new firm provided international telephone, telex and telegraph services, high speed data transmission and transmission and reception of real time television but those services were mainly restricted to Lagos and major cities of Nigeria such as [[Ibadan]], [[Enugu]], [[Kaduna]], and [[Port Harcourt|Port-Harcourt]].  The firm's major investment was in building a HF transmission and receiving station.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The firm began providing [[Telex|automatic telex service]] in 1971 and In 1980, NET introduced [[International direct dialing|international Direct Dialing]] and faster telex services between Nigeria and select Western countries. NET also offered private leased telegraph services with annual subscription fees to companies and managed television events transmitted or received via satellite such as [[FESTAC 77]] and sporting events.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  For much of its existence, NET's facilities were inadequate compared to the needs of the business and wider population, man times the lines were congested as available lines on the telephone trunks could not keep up with the traffic.

=== NITEL ===
Nigerian Telecommunications Limited was formed in 1985 as the combination of the telecommunications division of Post and Telecommunications and NET. The new company was formed to improve coordination of telecommunication services within the country, to make internal communications more commercial in objective and to reduce duplication of budgetary allocations and investments.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; NITEL inherited mostly [[Analog signal|analogue]] infrastructure from its predecessors and had to fund new investments in digital infrastructures.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It introduced [[mobile telephony]] in 1992, through MTS, a partnership with Digital Communications Limited, an Atlanta based firm. However,  operationally, it was still inefficient, the lines were [[Network congestion|congested]], the billing system was inefficient and the call completion rate for long distance calls was below 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jerome|first=Afeikhena|date=March 2002|title=Public enterprise reform in Nigeria: Evidence from the telecommunications industry|url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/aer/rpaper/rp_129.html|journal=African Economic Research Consortium|language=en|volume=Paper 129|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When new private telephone services emerged in Lagos during the 1990s, many of them depended on an unreliable NITEL for inter-connectivity services.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, demand for services in some cities was much higher than the capacity of NITEL while many NITEL lines were inoperative due to lack of maintenance of infrastructure or inadequate supporting cable network infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Nitel, a Poor Advertisement for Nigeria|last=Keeling|first=William|date=April 19, 1990|work=The Financial Times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2002, MTEL which had acquired the assets of MTS, obtained a [[GSM]] license.

Beginning in 2001, the company went through a period of botched sales and divestment, the first was the proposed sale of 51% stake to a group of investors under the trading name of Investors International London limited, the sale was cancelled after the investors failed to make the final bid price. Subsequently, the government stopped capital investment in the firm and approved a management turnaround contract with a firm called Pentascope in 2003. The contract was cancelled in 2005 after it became clear Pentascope did not have the adequate resources to run NITEL.  Another failed divestment to Orascom in 2005 followed before the firm was sold to a subsidiary of [[Transnational Corporation of Nigeria|Transcorp]] in 2007, but that sale was revoked in 2009. In 2014, the firm was sold to NATCOM, a group of investors led by [[John Olatunde Ayeni|Tunde Ayeni]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://allafrica.com/stories/201505180726.html|title=Turning Around the Fortunes of Nitel|last=Edeki|first=Emmanuel|date=May 17, 2015|work=Daily Independent|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Selective disclosure''' is a situation when a publicly traded company discloses material information to a single person, or a limited group of people or investors, as opposed to disclosing the information to all investors at the same time.

[[Material information]] is roughly defined as information that would cause a reasonable investor to make a buy or sell decision.

A problem with selective disclosure that the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) sought to eliminate with [[Regulation Fair Disclosure]](a.k.a. [[Regulation FD]] or [[Reg FD]]), is that it creates an uneven playing field for investors, allowing some investors to profit from material [[market moving information]] before others.

An example of a selective disclosure could go as follows: A company insider tells a small group of Wall Street analysts that the company is going to beat current analyst consensus estimates for earnings per share.  If this is the first time the company disclosed such [[earnings guidance|guidance]], and the guidance wasn't simultaneously disseminated to all investors via a press release or publicized webcast, then the disclosure would constitute selective disclosure.

These facilities were designed to create an industrial environment congenial for intending future industrialists.&lt;ref name=BR/&gt;

==Organizational structure==

'''Tax consolidation''', or '''combined reporting''', is a regime adopted in the tax or revenue legislation of a number of countries which treats a group of wholly owned or majority-owned companies and other entities (such as trusts and partnerships) as a single entity for tax purposes. This generally means that the head entity of the group is responsible for all or most of the group's tax obligations (such as paying tax and lodging tax returns). Consolidation is usually an all-or-nothing event: once the decision to consolidate has been made, companies are irrevocably bound. Only by having less than a 100% interest in a subsidiary can that subsidiary be left out of the consolidation.

The aim of a tax consolidation regime is to reduce administrative costs for government revenue departments and reduce [[compliance cost]]s for corporate taxpayers. For companies, consolidating can help understate profits by having losses in one group company reduce profits for another. Assets can be transferred between group companies without triggering a tax on gain for the company receiving assets, dividends can be paid between group companies without incurring tax liabilities, and tax attributes of one group company such as imputation credits can be used by other companies in the group. In some jurisdictions there may be other benefits, such as the ability to look through the acquisition of shares of acquired companies to depreciate the underlying assets.

Countries which have adopted a tax consolidation regime include the [[United States]], [[France]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]. Countries which do not permit tax consolidation often have rules which provide some of the benefits.  For example, the [[United Kingdom corporation tax|United Kingdom]] has a system of group relief, which permits profits of one group company to be reduced by losses of another group company.

Consolidation regimes can include onerous rules and regulations. There are typically complex rules to deal with the acquisition of companies with tax losses or other tax attributes.  Both the United States and Australia have rules which restrict the use of such losses in the wider group. In Australia, fixed trusts and 100% partnerships can be members of a consolidated group, but the head company must be a company and cannot be a trust or partnership.

==United States consolidated returns==
United States federal income tax rules permit commonly controlled corporations to file a consolidated return.&lt;ref&gt;The very complex rules are contained in [https://archive.is/20120708101735/http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?sid=5c22597067f74f0e71611e9f9c8430f6&amp;c=ecfr&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title26/26cfrv12_02.tpl 26 CFR 1.1502-1 through -100], authorized by the one paragraph [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1502- 26 USC 1502].&lt;/ref&gt;  The income tax and credits of the consolidated group are computed as if the group were a single taxpayer.  Intercorporate dividends are eliminated.  Once a group has elected to file a consolidated return, all members joining the group must participate in the filing.  The common parent corporation files returns, and is entitled to make all elections related to tax matters.  The common parent acts as agent for the members, and it and the members remain jointly and severally liable for all federal income taxes.  Many U.S. states permit or require consolidated returns for corporations filing federal consolidated returns.&lt;ref&gt;According to the CCH State Tax Handbook, 26 states either permitted or required consolidated or combined returns for 2009.  See {{ISBN|978-0-8080-1921-3}}.  Consolidated or combined returns are not the same as composite returns.  Many states require or permit that flow through entities (partnerships, LLCs, or S corporations) file a ''composite return'' reflecting the income of nonresident members.  Such composite returns are often filed in lieu of the relevant members filing separate (''e.g.'', individual) returns.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Requirements for filing===
Only entities organized in the United States and treated as corporations may file a consolidated Federal income tax return.&lt;ref&gt;Those states requiring or permitting consolidated returns generally allow only entities joining in the Federal consolidated return to file a consolidated state return.  Rules vary widely by state.&lt;/ref&gt;  The return is filed by a “common parent” and only those subsidiaries in which the common parent owns 80% or more of the vote AND value.&lt;ref&gt;For definitions, see [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1504- 26 USC 1504].&lt;/ref&gt;  The parent and all subsidiaries must file [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1122.pdf Form 1122] to elect to file a consolidated return in the first year of election.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=5c22597067f74f0e71611e9f9c8430f6&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:12.0.1.1.1.0.16.131&amp;idno=26 26 CFR 1.1502-75] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006020908/http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=5c22597067f74f0e71611e9f9c8430f6&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:12.0.1.1.1.0.16.131&amp;idno=26 |date=2012-10-06 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Every 80% subsidiary must make the election or it is not valid.  Thereafter, all corporations that begin to meet the 80% vote and value test must join in the consolidated return.  If a subsidiary ceases to meet the 80% vote and value test, it is removed from the group.  Adjustments to basis and other tax attributes apply upon a subsidiary joining or leaving a group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=9d3a84003e2b8998242e0395183ca239&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:12.0.1.1.1.0.14.119&amp;idno=26 26 CFR 1.1502-30] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006021047/http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=5c22597067f74f0e71611e9f9c8430f6&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:12.0.1.1.1.0.14.119&amp;idno=26 |date=2012-10-06 }} and [http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=9d3a84003e2b8998242e0395183ca239&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:12.0.1.1.1.0.14.120&amp;idno=26 26 CFR 1.1502-31] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006020920/http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=9d3a84003e2b8998242e0395183ca239&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:12.0.1.1.1.0.14.120&amp;idno=26 |date=2012-10-06 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consolidated taxable income===
Taxable income of each member is computed as if no consolidated return were filed, with the exception of certain items computed on a consolidated basis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=5c22597067f74f0e71611e9f9c8430f6&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:12.0.1.1.1.0.12.103&amp;idno=26 26 CFR 1.1502-12] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006021002/http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=5c22597067f74f0e71611e9f9c8430f6&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:12.0.1.1.1.0.12.103&amp;idno=26 |date=2012-10-06 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Then adjustments are made for certain transactions between group members.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120708101735/http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?sid=5c22597067f74f0e71611e9f9c8430f6&amp;c=ecfr&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title26/26cfrv12_02.tpl 26 CFR 1.1502-11 through 26 CFR 1.1502-28].&lt;/ref&gt;  Dividends between group members are eliminated.  Sales of property between members give rise to a deferred intercompany transaction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=5c22597067f74f0e71611e9f9c8430f6&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:12.0.1.1.1.0.12.104&amp;idno=26 26 CFR 1.1502-13] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006021011/http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=5c22597067f74f0e71611e9f9c8430f6&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:12.0.1.1.1.0.12.104&amp;idno=26 |date=2012-10-06 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The effect on the selling member is deferred and recognized as the corresponding effects are recognized by the buying member.  For example, Member A sells Member B some goods at a profit.  This profit is not recognized until Member B sells the goods or recognizes depreciation expense on the goods.  These complex rules require adjustments related to intra-group sales of property (including depreciable assets and inventory), transactions in stock or other obligations of members, performance of services, entry and exit of members, and certain back-to-back and avoidance transactions.

Certain deductions and most credits are computed on a consolidated rather than separate company basis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=5c22597067f74f0e71611e9f9c8430f6&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:12.0.1.1.1.0.12.103&amp;idno=26 26 CFR 1.1502-12] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006021002/http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=5c22597067f74f0e71611e9f9c8430f6&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:12.0.1.1.1.0.12.103&amp;idno=26 |date=2012-10-06 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  These include the deductions for [https://web.archive.org/web/20121006021102/http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=5c22597067f74f0e71611e9f9c8430f6&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:12.0.1.1.1.0.13.111&amp;idno=26 net operating loss], [https://web.archive.org/web/20121006021108/http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=5c22597067f74f0e71611e9f9c8430f6&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:12.0.1.1.1.0.13.115&amp;idno=26 charitable contributions], [https://web.archive.org/web/20121006021119/http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=08a8618a48e3fcb6d697fa5896ea4533&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:3.0.1.1.1.0.2.107&amp;idno=26 domestic production activities deduction], [https://web.archive.org/web/20121006021132/http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=5c22597067f74f0e71611e9f9c8430f6&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:12.0.1.1.1.0.13.116&amp;idno=26 dividends received deduction] and others.

===Basis and related items===
Each member of a group must recognize gain or loss on disposition of its shares of other members.  Such gain or loss is affected by the member's basis in such shares.  Basis must be adjusted for several items, including taxable income or loss recognized by the other member, distributions, and certain other items.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=5c22597067f74f0e71611e9f9c8430f6&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:12.0.1.1.1.0.14.121&amp;idno=26 26 CFR 1.1502-32] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006021037/http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=5c22597067f74f0e71611e9f9c8430f6&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:12.0.1.1.1.0.14.121&amp;idno=26 |date=2012-10-06 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  To the extent a member recognizes losses in excess of the owner's basis, such excess loss is treated as negative basis for all U.S. Federal income tax purposes.  Additional adjustments apply in the case of intra-group reorganizations or acquisition of the common parent,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=5c22597067f74f0e71611e9f9c8430f6&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:12.0.1.1.1.0.14.119&amp;idno=26 26 CFR 1.1502-30] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006021047/http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=5c22597067f74f0e71611e9f9c8430f6&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:12.0.1.1.1.0.14.119&amp;idno=26 |date=2012-10-06 }} and [http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=5c22597067f74f0e71611e9f9c8430f6&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:12.0.1.1.1.0.14.120&amp;idno=26 26 CFR 1.1502-31] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006020920/http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=9d3a84003e2b8998242e0395183ca239&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:12.0.1.1.1.0.14.120&amp;idno=26 |date=2012-10-06 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and upon entry to or exit from the group by a member.  The adjustments “tier up” to consolidated return members who own shares of the entity making the adjustment.  Numerous other adjustments apply.

===Filing periods===
All members of the group must use the same tax year as the common parent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=5c22597067f74f0e71611e9f9c8430f6&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:12.0.1.1.1.0.16.132&amp;idno=26 26 CFR 1.1502-76] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006021054/http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=5c22597067f74f0e71611e9f9c8430f6&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=26:12.0.1.1.1.0.16.132&amp;idno=26 |date=2012-10-06 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This may be adopted or changed by the common parent.  If one group acquires another group, the acquiring common parent's tax year must be adopted by all acquired subsidiaries then meeting the 80% vote and value test.  Short periods may be required upon joining or leaving a group.  In addition, if a member enters or leaves the group, certain adjustments to earnings and profits, basis, and other tax attributes apply.

==Fiscal unity==
Several countries allow related groups of corporations to compute income tax on a consolidated basis, in a manner similar to consolidation for financial reporting purposes.  This is referred to in the Netherlands and Luxembourg as a Fiscal Unity, and in France as Intégration Fiscale.  A similar consolidated return regime applies in Spain.  In such systems, consolidating eliminations of income and expense are taken into account.

The Netherlands system allows a group of Netherlands resident corporations and branches of foreign corporations to elect to be taxed as a Fiscal Unity.  Such election is permitted only for a parent corporation and its 95% or greater owned subsidiaries.  Upon election, the parent is taxed on the combined income of the members of the group.  The parent and subsidiaries retain joint and several liability for the tax of the group.&lt;ref&gt;Chorus, Jeroen M. J.; Gerverm P. H. M.; Hondius, E. H.: ''Introduction to Dutch Law'', p. 463.  {{ISBN|978-90-411-2507-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Netherlands fiscal unity functions much like financial statement consolidation.  Intra-group transactions, including property transfers, are generally eliminated.  Most intra-group reorganizations do not trigger taxable events.

==Group relief==
Some countries allow losses of one commonly controlled company to offset the profits of another commonly controlled company.  The United Kingdom permits group relief, and Germany permits an Organschaft.  Neither of these systems involve combined reporting or combined tax return filing, though certain additional reporting may be required.&lt;ref&gt;United Kingdom [[HMRC]] Corporation Tax Manual [http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ctmanual/CTM80100.htm CTM 80100 Group Relief].&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the UK scheme, a company's losses may be surrendered to a related company if several conditions are met.  The companies must be 75% owned companies.  For this purpose, a parent company and its subsidiaries qualify if the parent company owns at least 75% of the ordinary share capital of the subsidiary(ies) and have a beneficial interest in at least 75% of any distributions of earnings or upon winding up.  Alternative similar rules apply for certain corsortia and branches.  Under [[European Court of Justice]] rulings incorporated into UK law, the parent company need not be resident in the UK.

The UK scheme allows losses of one group member to be relieved (deducted) by members using a different [[accounting period]], with certain adjustments.  Trading (business) losses, capital losses, certain excess (disallowed) management expenses from non-UK affiliates, and certain excess charges may be relieved, subject to limitations.  The surrender of these items is done by one company for the benefit of one other company.

==Unitary groups==
{{see also|Formulary apportionment}}
Some states in the United States require related corporations to file a consolidated return if such corporations constitute a unitary business or unitary group.&lt;ref&gt;For a general discussion, with cases, see Hellerstein, Hellerstein, &amp; Youngman, ''State and Local Taxation'', chapter 8 section 3.  {{ISBN|0-314-15376-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Such consolidated returns tend to follow the pattern of United States Federal consolidated returns, though differences exist in the particular rules.  Generally, a group of corporations in the same, similar, or integrated businesses that are under common management and operational control may be treated as a unitary group.  

In a late June, 1983 decision, the US Supreme Court first sanctioned worldwide combined reporting in Container Corp. v. Franchise Tax Board (CA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/463/159/case.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The years in question were 1963-1965 and the California corporate income tax rate was 5.5%. The additional amount of tax due applying the worldwide combined reporting method was less than $72,000. The vote was 5-3,  Justice John Paul Stevens did not participate. 

The court's majority decision was written by Justice Brennan, joined by White, Marshall, Blackmun, and Rehnquist. Justice Powell wrote the dissenting opinion, joined by Burger and O'Connor.  Friend-of-the-court amicus curiae briefs were filed in support of California by the Attorneys General of Idaho, Utah, Illinois, Montana, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Alaska, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Indiana, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Hawaii, and Vermont. Also, in support of California, briefs were filed by the National Governors' Association, the National Farmers Union, and the Citizens for Tax Justice.

In support of the Container Corporation, amicus briefs were filed by Allied Lyons, Coca-Cola, Colgate-Palmolive, EMI Limited, Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Caterpillar Tractor, Gulf Oil, Phillips Petroleum, Shell Oil, and Sony. Also, in support of Container, were briefs filed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Committee on State Taxation, the Financial Executives Institute, the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Confederation of British Industry, the International Bankers Association in California, and the Union of Industries of the European Union. 

The Working Group agreed on three principles that should guide state taxation of the income of multinational corporations:&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/finalreportofwor00unit] [Office of the Secretary Department of the Treasury: The Final Report of the Worldwide Unitary Taxation Working Group, Chairman's Report and Supplemental Views] (August 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;  
* Principle One: Water's edge unitary combination for both U.S. and foreign based companies.
* Principle Two: Increased federal administrative assistance and cooperation with the states to promote full taxpayer disclosure and accountability.
* Principle Three: Competitive balance for U.S. multinationals, foreign multinationals, and purely domestic businesses.

California adopted a requirement that both United States and foreign corporations be included in a worldwide unitary group filing, absent a “water's edge” election and fee.  This requirement was limited somewhat by the U.S. Supreme Court in Barclays Bank PLC v. Franchise Tax Board. The vote in that case was 7-2 in favor of California and 9-0 in the companion Colgate-Palmolive case. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/512/298/case.html] [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2204141 114 S.Ct. 2268 ] (1994).&lt;/ref&gt; California subsequently repealed the “water's edge” fee.  Illinois requires unitary group filings for United States corporations only.

Under the unitary concept, all commonly controlled corporations within the unitary management and control group are required to join in a consolidated return filing for the state. An example of why a state would adopt unitary combined reporting is in the Statement of Intent in section 152 of Vermont's 2004 Act:

{{quote|text=In recognition of the fact that corporate business is increasingly conducted on a national and international basis, it is the intent of the general assembly to adopt a unitary combined system of income tax reporting for corporations, and as an integral part of this proposal, to lower the corporate income tax rates. Vermont's separate accounting system is inadequate to measure accurately the income of a corporation with non-Vermont affiliates and creates tax disadvantages for Vermont corporations which compete with multistate and multinational corporations doing business in Vermont. It is the intent of the general assembly, in adopting a unitary combined reporting system, to put all corporations doing business in Vermont on an equal income tax footing, and with the revenue from the expanded and more accurate tax base, to lower Vermont's corporate income tax rates.

The enabling statute, however, excludes "overseas business organizations" from the taxable combined group so water's edge instead of worldwide combined reporting is adopted. Therefore, purely domestic businesses (i.e. national multi-state corporations) are subject to tax on 100% of their taxable profits, U.S. based multinational corporations are subject to tax on 100% of their reported U.S. profits plus foreign profits via repatriated dividends from foreign subsidiaries (if and when repatriated), and foreign based multinational corporations are subject to tax on 100% of their U.S. subsidiaries' reported U.S.profits. As a result, under water's edge combined reporting, separate accounting is only ignored for purely domestic businesses but retained for multinational corporations. Per the 2003-2004 Biennial Report of the Vermont Commissioner of Taxes, the adoption of unitary combined reporting "will diminish opportunities for certain aggressive tax management strategies that were available to multi-state corporations and will help create a level playing field with respect to Vermont-based corporations." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.vt.us/tax/legalbiennial.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt;
Therefore, under water's edge, U.S. based and foreign-based multinationals have the ability to shift U.S. profits to foreign subsidiaries and avoid federal and state income taxes. Profits shifted out of the U.S. would be taxed only if and when they are repatriated as foreign dividends to a U.S. based multinational. Most foreign countries do not tax foreign dividends received by multinationals based in their countries so profits shifted out of the U.S. by U.S. subsidiaries owned by foreign based multinationals and later repatriated to the foreign parent are usually not taxed.}} 

The State of New Hampshire adopted worldwide combined reporting in 1981 but restricted it to water's edge five years later in 1986. In 1999, in Caterpillar Inc. v. New Hampshire Department of Revenue, the court stated "We point out that the water's edge method was adopted for the benefit of foreign businesses." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courts.state.nh.us/supreme/opinions/1999/caterpil.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Approaching 30 years since the 1984 principals of the Worldwide Unitary Tax Working Group, it is questionable whether or not a competitive balance for U.S. multinationals, foreign multinationals, and purely domestic businesses has been attained. Bloomberg reporter Jesse Drucker demonstrates that separate accounting/arm's length pricing favors the multinationals in an October 2010 article titled "Google 2.4% Rate Shows How $60 Billion Lost to Loopholes" with tax strategies known as the "Double Irish" and the "Dutch Sandwich."  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://topics.bloomberg.com/the-great-corporate-tax-dodge/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-03-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140120003231/http://topics.bloomberg.com/the-great-corporate-tax-dodge/ |archive-date=2014-01-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a New York Times October 2012 Dealbook column, Victor Fleischer wrote about "Overseas Cash And The Tax Games Multinationals Play." Although billions in corporate profits are reported to be on the books of foreign subsidiaries located in tax havens, a New York Times article by David Kocieniewski titled "For U.S. Companies, Money Offshore Mean Manhattan" dated May 2013, indicates that those corporate profits are being utilized in the U.S. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/22/business/for-us-companies-money-offshore-means-manhattan.html]&lt;/ref&gt; This is supported by a more recent report by Kitty Richards and John Craig at the Center for American Progress titled "Offshore Corporate Profits - The Only Thing 'Trapped' is Tax Revenue" &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/tax-reform/report/2014/01/09/81681/offshore-corporate-profits-the-only-thing-trapped-is-tax-revenue/]&lt;/ref&gt; An article by Floyd Norris in the May 23, 2013 New York Times, "The Corrosive Effect of Apple's Tax Avoidance", points out how these tax avoidance strategies will most likely be followed by many other multinational corporations. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/24/business/making-companies-pay-taxes-the-mccain-way.html]&lt;/ref&gt; And, an article by David Gelles titled "New Corporate Shelter: A Merger Abroad" dated October 8, 2013 makes a case that the best tax strategy for a U.S. based corporation is to become a foreign based corporation. &lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20131225114050/http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/10/08/to-cut-corporate-taxes-a -merger-abroad-and-a-new-home/]&lt;/ref&gt;

The apportionment factors for state income tax are computed on a consolidated basis and applied to the income of members doing business in the state.  Illinois taxes only United States corporations in this manner.  California, following the ''Barclays'' case, modified its rules to include in the combined reporting only the taxable income of United States corporations.  California's computation of apportionment factors is still based on worldwide group amounts unless a “water's edge” election is made.

The '''Texas Emerging Technology Fund''' (often abbreviated as '''TETF''' or '''ETF''') is a technology investment fund created by legislation in 2005 at the urging of Governor [[Rick Perry]] to provide Texas with an unparalleled advantage in the research, development, and [[commercialization]] of [[emerging technologies]]. The enabling legislation (Texas HB 1765 of the 79th Legislature) launched the ETF with $200 million to help create jobs and develop the [[economy of Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;Texas Emerging Technology Fund Website {{cite web|url=http://governor.state.tx.us/ecodev/etf/ |accessdate=June 24, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623151551/http://governor.state.tx.us/ecodev/etf |archivedate=June 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Legislative revisions during the 2007 and 2009 sessions have expanded the total funds under management to approximately $500 million.

As of October 2010, the program has given a total of $173 million to 120 companies as well as $161 million to educational institutions.&lt;ref name=dmn/&gt;

Governor [[Greg Abbott]] signed a law ending the Texas Emerging Technology Fund on June 4, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Texas Gov. Abbott Abolishes Rick Perry's Emerging Tech Fund http://www.govtech.com/state/Texas-Gov-Abbott-Abolishes-Rick-Perrys-Emerging-Tech-Fund.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fund administration==

=== Investment Focus ===
The ETF focuses on three main investment areas: 
* ''Incentives for Commercialization Activities'': early-stage technology investment funds designed to assist companies in transforming ideas, concepts, and prototypes into commercial viable products.
* ''Research Award Matching'': funds create public-private partnerships which leverage the unique strengths of universities, federal government grant programs, and industry.
* ''Acquisition of Research Superiority'': funds for Texas higher education institutions to recruit the best research talent in the world.

ETF's first investments were executed in May 2006. By October 1, 2009, the ETF was the single largest pre-seed investor for emerging technology companies in the entire United States.&lt;ref&gt;White Paper on the Texas Emerging Technology Fund {{cite web|url=http://www.horne-llp.com/media/169867/white%20paper%20tx%20emerging%20tec%20fund_041211.pdf |accessdate=November 5, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105233504/http://www.horne-llp.com/media/169867/white%20paper%20tx%20emerging%20tec%20fund_041211.pdf |archivedate=November 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of June 6, 2011, the ETF had invested $196M in 132 commercialization investments. Approximately 1/2 of ETF's commercialization investments have been made within the biotechnology and life sciences industry.&lt;ref&gt;ETF Dashboard {{cite web|url=http://governor.state.tx.us/files/ecodev/etf/TETF_Dashboard.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820025504/http://governor.state.tx.us/files/ecodev/etf/TETF_Dashboard.pdf |archivedate=2011-08-20 |df= }}2011-06-06&lt;/ref&gt; 2014 has witnessed a slowdown in all three versions of ETF awards at the same time a special Texas House subcommittee explores incentives programs ahead of the 84th Texas regular legislative session.

=== Deal Sourcing ===
The ETF established seven '''Regional Centers of Innovation and Commercialization''' (RCICs) to foster technology commercialization throughout the entire state of Texas and act as an efficient deal sourcing mechanism. In addition, a statewide Life Science Regional Center of Innovation and Commercialization also was formed. The RCICs act as the regional agent to identify, evaluate, and submit promising proposals from their respective regions to the ETF Advisory Committee. The ETF Advisory Committee makes recommendations to Trustees who make final decisions on awards. RCICs work closely with applicants in assisting with ETF proposal development, post-proposal debriefings, and commercialization activities. In addition, RCICs are a strong focal point to increasing cooperation and spurring collaboration between industrial, financial, and academic entities.&lt;ref&gt;Texas Emerging Technology Fund Website - {{cite web|url=http://governor.state.tx.us/ecodev/etf/etf_rcics |accessdate=June 24, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604004640/http://governor.state.tx.us/ecodev/etf/etf_rcics |archivedate=June 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Christopher Banas of Palmaz Scientific, Cardiospectra and now Pryor Medical,  and Paul Castella (Texas Technology Fund, Austin) filed the following lawsuit, "''BANAS v. VOLCANO CORP.CASE NO. 12-CV-01535-WHO"........"'''Banas and Castella initiated this action against Volcano seeking millions of dollars. It
would be patently unfair to hold that Volcano waived its contractual right to attorneys'
fees because it appropriately required Banas and Castella to plead the basis for their
standing to assert breach of contract.6 Cf Johnson v. Myers, 2014 WL 2214045, at *2
(N.D.Cal. May 28, 2014) ("it would be inequitable to limit defendants' attorney's fees
recovery to the assets of a single plaintiff when every litigant was

[47 F.Supp.3d 965]

						invested in the outcome of the action and aspired to win money"). If Banas and Castella have an
arrangement with other former CardioSpectra shareholders, or the dismissed defendants, regarding
indemnification for attorneys' fees, that is their business. '''However, there is no question that, as
plaintiffs, Banas and Castella are liable for attorneys' fees in the first instance...."''' 
					
Banas and Castella then appeal.....and file an affidavit of inability to pay.

.'''''......Yet they say nothing about any efforts they have made in recourse to those institutions, and
dozens of other individual and institutional former shareholders, to seek help in securing the
required bond pursuant to their indemnity rights as Shareholder Representatives. (Mot. at 4–5).
The sincerity of Plaintiffs’ invocation of the State and University of Texas is specious on its face,
as neither institution was a party to any of the three complaints filed by Plaintiffs. Ezer Decl., Ex.
A (Complaint); Ex. B (First Amended Complaint); Ex. C (Second Amended Complaint)...."'''''

=== Fund Management ===
The ETF is housed within the Economic Development and Tourism division of the Texas State Government.  Terry Chase Hazell currently serves as the TETF Director and is considered the most private equity experienced director to serve. Prior TETF Directors include Jonathan W. Taylor, Mark Ellison, Alan Kirchhoff and interim director Patrick Boswell. You can visit the TETF website at: http://www.emergingtechfund.com ETF has consistently maintained an extremely low analyst to project investment ratio.

==Debates and commentary about funding==
{{expand section|date=August 2011}}

The internal rate of return (IRR) of the ETF s very low and comparable to investing in U.S. treasuries. Therefore, questions have arisen about the ETF's required rate of return and performance against benchmark.

Under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 501 Regulation D, TETF does not fall under any of the eight definitions of accredited investor, affecting TETF's participation in follow on offerings.

An October 2010 article by the ''[[The Dallas Morning News|Dallas Morning News]]'' editorial board argued for fundamental reform in how the fund works. The board stated, "The way Texas doles out money... raises such serious questions about the role of political donations in the fund's operation that the governor and the Texas Legislature should revamp it." Although the board considered it "a valuable program", it remarked that "other states have tried to keep politicians at arm's length from the selection and funding process... Texas needs to do the same".&lt;ref name=dmn&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/editorials/20101004-Editorial-It-s-time-to-435.ece|title=Editorial: It's time to fix the Emerging Technology Fund|date=October 4, 2010|publisher=''[[The Dallas Morning News]]''|accessdate=August 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to criticisms, Governor Perry has said that it "is a pretty rare occurrence" for him to know that political supporters have connections to firms that receive funding.&lt;ref name=dmn/&gt;  One such rare occurrence was Convergen Life Sciences, now called Genprex.  The CEO, David Nance, was a donor and his company received a $4.5 million ETF award.

Many involved in the ETF process firmly believe the implications and criticisms of the press, most notably the ''[[The Dallas Morning News|Dallas Morning News]]'', to be "inaccurate and ignoring the hundreds of individuals around the state that freely devote their time, energy and efforts to the process to ensure that Texas is pushing the technological envelope that will lead to scientific breakthroughs and a stronger economy."&lt;ref&gt;Texas Coalition of Capital http://www.texascapital.org/newsroom_10_15_10.html&lt;/ref&gt; Despite criticism by the press, a majority of the ETF's 140 investments since 2005 are still operating as of February 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Controversial Texas Startup Fund Proves Its Value http://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/controversial-texas-startup-fund.html?ana=lnk&amp;page=all&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the jobs created by the fund have been outside Texas and several of the companies have left the state. By government accounting standards the fund has lost $25 million so far. but a separate valuation of the fund for legislators produced a significant gain in fund value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kansascity.com/news/business/national-international/article794130.html |title=Texas governor's startup fund is not all it seems |last1=WEBER |first1=PAUL J. |date=24 July 2014 |website=www.kansascity.com |publisher=Associated Press |accessdate=24 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726012150/http://www.kansascity.com/news/business/national-international/article794130.html |archivedate=July 26, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Texas government code 490.102 (a) (1) specifies a 50% allocation of legislative appropriations for ETF to Incentives for Commercialization Activities awards, though Trustees have discretion to vary the allocation of legislatively appropriated funds to Incentives for Commercialization Activities, Research Award Matching, Acquisition of Research Superiority awards each and every legislative biennium. Some critics cite large awards to Texas A&amp;M University for Research Award Matching afforded by this statute.

Texas government code 490.153 (b.) institutes a 2% limit on funding for Regional Centers of Innovation and Commercialization. Upon review of 2013 ETF annual report to the Texas legislature, ETF has exceeded allowed amount for awards to Regional Centers of Innovation and Commercialization in excess of 4.5 million dollars as of August 31, 2013.

Example calculation: Texas legislature appropriated 50M USD for ETF during the fiscal year 2014 and 2015 biennium. Therefore, $500,000 is available to fund RCICs for the FY 14/15 biennium (50M * 50% * 2%). However, ETF may have already exceeded this limit with awards for five or more RCICs. These awards have been announced in newspaper reports and by the RCICs, but have not been formally announced by ETF manager as recommended by state auditor.

Transparency concerns have dogged the fund since inception. Nevertheless, the state legislature has consistently funded the ETF, even as some legislators express concerns over the fund's true performance in the areas of job creation and return on Texas taxpayers' monies.

The Texas state auditor's report of 2011 was not complete, in that job creation and valuation methodology remain opaque up to the present day.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9286">{{Other uses|UCP (disambiguation){{!}}UCP}}
The '''Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits''' (UCP) is a set of rules on the issuance and use of [[letters of credit]]. The UCP is utilized by [[bankers]] and commercial parties in more than 175 countries in [[trade finance]]. Some 11-15% of [[international trade]] utilizes letters of credit, totaling over a trillion dollars (US) each year.

Historically, the commercial parties, particularly banks, have developed the techniques and methods for handling letters of credit in international [[trade finance]]. This practice has been standardized by the ICC ([[International Chamber of Commerce]]) by publishing the UCP in 1933 and subsequently updating it throughout the years. The ICC has developed and moulded the UCP by regular revisions, the current version being the UCP600. The result is the most successful international attempt at unifying rules ever, as the UCP has substantially universal effect. The latest revision was approved by the Banking Commission of the ICC at its meeting in Paris on 25 October 2006. This latest version, called the UCP600, formally commenced on 1 July 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://store.iccwbo.org/icc-uniform-customs-and-practice-for-documentary-credits-ucp-600-leaflet-format-set-of-25 | title = ICC Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits | accessdate = 29 January 2013 | publisher = ICC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==ICC and the UCP==

A significant function of  the ICC is the preparation and promotion of its uniform rules of practice. The ICC’s aim is to provide a codification of international practice occasionally selecting the best practice after ample debate and consideration. The ICC rules of practice are designed by bankers and merchants and not by legislatures with political and local considerations. The rules accordingly demonstrate the needs, customs and practices of business. Because the rules are incorporated voluntarily into contracts, the rules are flexible while providing a stable base for international review, including judicial scrutiny. International revision is thus facilitated permitting the incorporation of the changing practices of the commercial parties. ICC, which was established in 1919, had as its primary objective facilitating the flow of international trade at a time when nationalism and protectionism threatened the easing of world trade. It was in that spirit that the UCP were first introduced – to alleviate the confusion caused by individual countries’ promoting their own national rules on letter of credit practice. The aim was to create a set of contractual rules that would establish uniformity in practice, so that there would be less need to cope with often conflicting national regulations. The universal acceptance of the UCP by practitioners in countries with widely divergent economic and judicial systems is a testament to the rules’ success.

==UCP600==

The latest (July 2007) revision of UCP is the sixth revision of the rules since they were first promulgated in 1933. It is the outcome of more than three years of work by the ICC's Commission on Banking Technique and Practice.

The UCP remain the most successful set of private rules for trade ever developed. A range of individuals and groups contributed to the current revision including: the UCP Drafting Group, which waded through more than 5000 individual comments before arriving at this final text; the UCP Consulting Group, consisting of members from more than 25 countries, which served as the advisory body; the more than 400 members of the ICC Commission on Banking Technique and Practice who made pertinent suggestions for changes in the text; and 130 ICC National Committees worldwide which took an active role in consolidating comments from their members.

During the revision process, notice was taken of the considerable work that had been completed in creating the '''International Standard Banking Practice for the Examination of Documents under Documentary Credits (ISBP)''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://store.iccwbo.org/international-standard-banking-practice-3 | title = International Standard Banking Practice ISBP 745 | accessdate = 17 March 2014 | publisher = ICC}}&lt;/ref&gt; ICC Publication 745. This publication has evolved into a necessary companion to the UCP for determining compliance of documents with the terms of [[letters of credit]]. It is the expectation of the Drafting Group and the Banking Commission that the application of the principles contained in the ISBP, including subsequent revisions thereof, will continue during the time UCP 600 is in force. At the time UCP 600 is implemented, there will be an updated version of the ISBP (the most recent one being the 2013 revision) to bring its contents in line with the substance and style of the new rules.


Note that UCP600 does not automatically apply to a credit if the credit is silent as to which set of rules it is subject to. A credit issued by SWIFT MT700 is no longer subject by default to the current UCP; it has to be indicated in field 40E, which is designated for specifying the "applicable rules".

Where a credit is issued subject to UCP600, the credit will be interpreted in accordance with the entire set of 39 articles contained in UCP600. However, exceptions to the rules can be made by express modification or exclusion. For example, the parties to a credit may agree that the rest of the credit shall remain valid despite the beneficiary's failure to deliver an installment. In such case, the credit has to nullify the effect of article 32 of UCP600, such as by wording the credit as: "The credit will continue to be available for the remaining installments notwithstanding the beneficiary's failure to present complied documents of an installment in accordance with the installment schedule."

==eUCP==

The eUCP was developed as a supplement to UCP due to the sense at the time that [[bank]]s and corporates together with the transport and insurance industries were ready to use electronic commerce. The hope and expectation that surrounded the development of eUCP has failed the UCP600 and it will remain as a supplement albeit slightly amended to identify its relationship with UCP600.

An updated version of the eUCP came into effect on 1 July 2007 to coincide the commencement of the UCP600. There are no substantive changes to the eUCP, merely references to the UCP600.

==CDCS==
The Certificate for Documentary Credit Specialists (CDCS) is the leading qualification for documentary credit specialists. Recognised worldwide as a benchmark of competence for international practitioners, it enables documentary credit specialists to demonstrate practical knowledge and understanding of the complex issues associated with documentary credit practice such as:

* Documentary credits - types, characteristics and uses, including standby credits
* Rules and trade terms, including '''ISBP 745''', '''ISP 98''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://store.iccwbo.org/isp-98-international-standby-practices | title = ISP 98- International Standby Practices | accessdate = 17 March 2014 | publisher = ICC}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''UCP 600''', '''URR 725'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://store.iccwbo.org/icc-uniform-rules-for-bank-to-bank-reimbursements-under-documentary-credits | title = ICC Uniform Rules for Bank-to-Bank Reimbursements under Documentary Credits | accessdate = 17 March 2014 | publisher = ICC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''Incoterms 2010'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://store.iccwbo.org/incoterms-2010 | title = Incoterms 2010 - English edition | accessdate = 17 March 2014 | publisher = ICC}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Types and methods of payment / credit used in documentary credit transactions

CDCS was developed by the Institute of Financial Services and Bankers Association for Finance and Trade (formerly IFSA), in partnership with the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC). The qualification was first examined in 1999 and has seen a rapid growth in the uptake of the programme across the world.

The Certificate is examined in over 30 countries each year and is taught through distance learning and self-study over a four-month period. The CDCS assessment involves a three-hour multiple-choice examination of 70 questions, designed to test knowledge and its application to real-life situations. Once a practitioner has achieved the qualification, they have the right to add the professional designation of ‘CDCS’ after their name for a period of three years.

After the three-year period a process of Re-Certification is required where the professional has to provide evidence of Continued Professional Development to maintain the accreditation or re-sit the examination.

Qualification syllabus and specification can be found at [http://www.CDCSinternational.org www.CDCSinternational.org].

'''Visy Industries''' was established in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] in 1948 and has since grown to become one of the world's largest privately owned [[paper]], [[packaging]] and [[recycling]] companies. Today, Visy employs more than 9500 people in Australia and the United States (where it is known as Pratt Industries USA), with total sales exceeding more than $5 billion. Visy was owned by [[Richard Pratt (Australian businessman)|Richard Pratt]] until his death on 28 April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/national/richard-pratt-dies-20090428-alwo.html|title=Richard Pratt dies |author= |date=April 28, 2009 |work=[[Brisbane Times]] |publisher= |accessdate=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; when his son [[Anthony Pratt (businessman)|Anthony Pratt]] assumed the role of Executive Chairman. He has also presided over a major expansion into the Asian packaging market and moved to position Visy as a key player in food security for the region.

Today, Visy's operational footprint extends from Sydney to Singapore, from Shanghai to San Francisco, with more than 180 facilities worldwide.

==History==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Visy's Corporate Headquarters - also home to the company Tech Centre.jpg|thumb|right|Visy's Corporate HQ is also home to the company Tech Centre]] --&gt;
Visy Industries began in 1948 with a 1000-pound loan from Richard Pratt's aunt, Ida Visbord, for whom the company is named. Originally, there were three partners – Visbord's husband Max Plotka, Richard Pratt's father Leon and engineer Les Feldman. From the day Visy opened for business in a Fitzroy, Melbourne factory there were indications this would be a company devoted to recycling and sustainability – the first corrugator it used was made from spare parts and recycled scrap metal.

After Leon Pratt's death in 1969, his son [[Richard Pratt (Australian businessman)|Richard Pratt]] took over the reins and oversaw a dramatic expansion. Throughout the 1970s, Visy established new plants in New South Wales and Queensland, and by the end of the decade was making more than 100,000 tonnes of boxes a year.&lt;ref name="Visy Report 2011"&gt;{{cite web|title=Visy Report 2011|url=http://www.visy.com.au/pdf/sustainability-report-v8-pr2-spreads.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1970s and early 80s, Visy continued to grow but this time its major expansion was spearheaded by the decision to build 100% recycled paper mills, the first at Warwick Farm, Sydney.  This decision not only signaled a shift in Visy's corporate philosophy but placed the company at the forefront of the recycling movement in Australia, setting the company on the path to record growth and profits. By 1990, Visy's national market share was over 40% with more than 2000 employees.&lt;ref name="Visy - Our History"&gt;{{cite web|title=Visy - Our History|url=http://www.visy.com.au/about/our-company/our-history/|publisher=Visy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard and Anthony Pratt then set their sights on the huge American market, with the younger Pratt moving to the U.S. to oversee the start-up and development of Pratt Industries USA. Through a combination of acquisition and greenfielding 100% recycled paper mills and state-of-the-art corrugators, [[Pratt Industries USA]] showed remarkable progress in the ensuing two decades, growing from the 46th largest corrugated packaging producer in America to the 5th.&lt;ref name="Fibre Box Association"&gt;{{cite web|title=FibrBox.org|url=http://www.fibrebox.org/|publisher=Fibre Box Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Pratt Industries USA employs more than 4000 people, more Americans than any other Australian company. It is the only major paper company in the US that is 100% recycled.

==2001-2003 - Tumut and Southcorp==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Visy - Tumut Kraft Mill.jpg|thumb|right|Visy's Tumut Kraft Mill]] --&gt;In 2001, Visy undertook the-then largest development in its history, the construction of a $450 million kraft paper mill in Tumut, New South Wales. This was the first kraft mill built in the world in 20 years.
It was the biggest investment in regional Australia since the Snowy Mountains Scheme (RP Speech), and was hailed by Australia's leading environmentalists for its commitment to sustainability.&lt;ref name="Canberra Times"&gt;{{cite news|title='Greenies' rare approval as Tumut pulp mill opens|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1g1-80252576.html|newspaper=Canberra Times|date=2011-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also boasts an advanced water usage system, with near-zero levels of effluent leaving the site. In fact, the Tumut mill is the most water efficient in the world - requiring just five tonnes of water to produce every tonne of product, compared to the global average of 25 tonnes. And it uses only forest thinnings and off-cuts for fibre.&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;{{cite web|title=Visy paper mill expansion gets go ahead|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2007-05-02/visy-paper-mill-expansion-gets-go-ahead/2537940|work=ABC.net.au|accessdate=05/02/2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project was so successful that 10 years later Visy built Stage 2 on the same site – a second kraft paper mill bringing the total investment to Tumut to almost $1 billion. Stage 2, which was opened by NSW Premier Barry O’Farrell, was also hailed by environmentalists, and was a winner of the Australian Business Awards for “Environmental Sustainabilty."&lt;ref name="Sustainability Matters"&gt;{{cite web|title=Visy recognized with Australian Business Award for Environmental Sustainability|url=http://www.sustainabilitymatters.net.au/news/42491-Visy-recognised-with-2-1-Australian-Business-Award-for-Environmental-Sustainability|work=SustainabilityMatters.net.au|publisher=Sustainability Matters|accessdate=08/03/2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Visy continued to grow by acquisition as well as green-fielding. In 2001, the company effectively doubled in size when it acquired Southcorp Packaging. Visy was now operating at over 100 packaging and recycling sites in Australia, New Zealand and the U.S. Moreover, Visy expanded its product mix to include steel and aluminum cans, PET bottles, beverage cartons and plastic packaging. It also continued to be a world leader in recycling and during this period Visy opened Australia's largest Materials Recovery Facility (MRF) in Smithfield, NSW.&lt;ref name="Australian Financial Review, September 2005"&gt;{{cite news|title=Dick Pratt's $3.5bn succession plan|newspaper=Australian Financial Review|date=2005-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==
The Pratt Foundation was established by Richard and Jeanne Pratt in 1978 to support various charitable causes and initiatives throughout Australia. Since then, it has donated more than $250 million. In addition, Jeanne and Richard Pratt helped raised a further $250 million by opening their home, Raheen, to other charitable fundraisers.
The Foundation is chaired by Anthony Pratt's sister, Heloise Waislitz. Its chief executive is Sam Lipski, a Melbourne-based journalist, and supports areas including medical research, education, the arts and relief of poverty.&lt;ref name="Herald Sun"&gt;{{cite news|title=Our heroes philanthropic|newspaper=Herald Sun|date=2013-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pratt family is also behind VisyCares, a non-profit begun in 1995 which promotes social responsibility at Visy through donations to establish community-based projects such as youth, immigrant and learning centres.&lt;ref name="The Age"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ali wins hearts with intimate combination|newspaper=The Age|date=09/12/2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
In December 2005 the Australian Competition and Consumer  Commission (ACCC) commenced prosecution against Visy for alleged involvement in a cartel in the packaging industry. In 2007, Richard Pratt and the Visy group received a A$36 million fine for price fixing, representing the largest fine in Australian history at the time. That same year it was also learned that Visy was also one of a number of Australian companies that had used a trucking company later proved to be run by a former Hell's Angel.&lt;ref name="The Australian Financial Review, March 2011"&gt;{{cite news|title=Amcor, Visy settle $500m cartel claim|url=http://www.afr.com/p/national/amcor_visy_settle_cartel_claim_0qlrm6vysyhvzl7lo0ijhk|newspaper=The Australian Financial Review|date=03/09/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Herald-Sun&gt;{{cite news|title=Bikies for hire - Cops uncover Hells Angels link to corporate giant|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/breaking-news/visy-uses-bikies-as-debt-collectors/story-e6frf7jx-1226354394609|newspaper=Herald-Sun|date=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, upon Anthony Pratt's ascendency to Executive Chairman, Visy appointed former ACCC Chairman Professor Allan Fels to chair its Governance Committee.&lt;ref name="The Australian Financial Review, August 2009"&gt;{{cite news|title=Pratt takes reins as CEO departs|newspaper=The Australian Financial Review|date=2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Pratt also announced former advisor to President Obama and the outgoing US Ambassador to Australia Jeffrey Bleich would join his company's advisory board. Bleich, an ex-clerk for former U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist, was a one-time special counsel to the President before being appointed Ambassador. He joins other advisory board members including Sir Dryden Spring, the former chairman of the Australian New Zealand National Bank, Allan Moss (AO), the former CEO of the Macquarie banking group and Jeanne Pratt (AC).&lt;ref name="The Australian, October 2013"&gt;{{cite news|title=US ambassador for Pratt advisory board|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/us-ambassador-for-pratt-advisory-board/story-e6frg8zx-1226737054043|newspaper=The Australian|date=10/11/2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 the [[Australian Taxation Office]] revealed that in 2013-14, despite earning more than $2.5 billion in revenue, the holding company Pratt Consolidated Holdings had paid no tax. Further, that Thorney Investments, operated by Richard Pratt's son-in-law Alex Waislitz, which earned $430 million in revenue, had also paid no tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-03-22/ato-30pc-of-large-private-companies-pay-no-tax/7266454|title=98 private companies earning over $200m pay no tax: ATO|website=ABC News|language=en-AU|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hells Angels links==
Visy Industries has links with the outlaw motorcycle group, the [[Hells Angels]]. Visy Industries employs a trucking company run by Stephen James Rogers, a convicted drug trafficker and founding chapter boss of the Hells Angels. Rogers was sentenced in 2007 to three years' prison for drug trafficking, and a senior Visy Industries manager gave character evidence for Rogers at his trial and stated the company would stand by him despite his conviction for trafficking amphetamines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/visy-linked-to-angels-bikie-boss-20090705-d96y.html |title=Visy linked to Angels bikie boss |author=McKenzie, Nick |date=6 July 2009 |work=[[The Age]] |publisher= |accessdate=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 Visy Industries was accused of using the Hells Angels to collect their debts. Police and industry sources state Visy founder Richard Pratt, who died in 2009, personally approved the deal with the Hells Angles. Visy Industries have called the accusations "nonsense".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/more-news/cops-uncover-hells-angels-link-to-corporate-giant-visy/story-fn7x8me2-1226354297970 |title=Cops uncover Hells Angels link to corporate giant Visy |author=Moor, Keith |date=14 May 2012 |work=[[Herald Sun]] |publisher= |accessdate=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post 2009 leadership under Anthony Pratt==
[[File:Anthony Pratt.jpg|thumb|right|Anthony Pratt]]Following Richard Pratt's death in April, 2009, Anthony Pratt returned to Australia to assume the added responsibility of Global Executive Chairman of Visy Industries. This was in addition to him continuing in his long-time position as Chairman of Pratt Industries USA. Just two years after he assumed leadership of the company, Visy jumped from 43rd to 3rd in the AMR Corporate Citizenship Index, part of an annual survey of more than 60,000 Australians.&lt;ref name="The Australian Financial Review, April 2011"&gt;{{cite news|title=JB Hi-Fi tops but crisis effect not over for DJs|newspaper=The Australian Financial Review|date=2011-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Under Anthony Pratt's leadership the company has also expanded its Asian presence and participation.  Earnings from its Asian operations have increased by $100 million a year.&lt;ref name="The Australian, March 2013"&gt;{{cite news|title=Visy bid to double Asia earnings Pratt unveils strategy for regional growth|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/companies/visy-bid-to-double-asia-earnings/story-fn91v9q3-1226594292308|newspaper=The Australian|date=03/11/2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was achieved in several ways. Firstly, Visy established Build Run Repair, an engineering services company headquartered in Singapore to design and build sustainable pulp and paper mills and clean energy plants, leveraging the company's experience gained from building its own 15 paper mills and 4 clean energy plants.
 
Its internal team of more than 40 engineers is also charged with maintaining Visy's worldwide portfolio of factories as well as source equipment and products from China, Vietnam, Malaysia other Asian countries. In addition, the Singapore operation houses a trading company. Its mission is to buy hundreds of millions of dollar worth of goods and services for both Visy and external customers.&lt;ref name="The Australian, May 2012"&gt;{{cite news|title=Visy expansion rolls on with US35m US Plant|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/visy-expansion-rolls-on-with-35m-us-plant/story-e6frg8zx-1226347254691|newspaper=The Australian|date=2012-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This period has also seen the growth of Visy's Thailand operations, which produce plastic products. The Thailand success builds on Visy's strategy of following its multinational customers into Asia.

Visy has also set up warehouse distribution centres outside Shanghai and Beijing, as well as a trading office in Shenzhen which is selling Visy paper into the Chinese market. Visy's growing focus on Asian markets received a major boost in 2013 when Anthony Pratt announced plans to double the company's earnings in the region by building new packaging plants in at least four South-East Asian countries. They will be modeled on the group's existing plastics plants in Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia.&lt;ref name="The Australian, March 2013"/&gt;

Work on the $260 million project is scheduled to begin in March, and will take 16 months. The 360,000-ton capacity plant will be built on a 50-acre site adjacent to Pratt's box-making plant in Valparaiso, Indiana, the world's largest. The new mill is expected to propel Pratt's USA sales to $2 billion.&lt;ref name="The Australian"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/profit-loss/paper-giant-pratt-plans-us-boost/story-fn91vch7-1226724739391|work=The Australian|date=23 September 2013|title=Paper giant Pratt plans US boost|first=Damon|last=Kitney}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Deleted image removed:  [[File:Pratt Industries NYC Paper on a Barge to the Paper Mill.jpg|thumb|right|Discarded paper is barged to Pratt mill in NYC]] --&gt;This follows other mills Pratt built in the US, most notably in New York City. That facility represents the largest manufacturing investment in the city since World War 2. And it is the only paper mill ever built in New York. New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg designated September 17, 2013, as “Pratt Industries Day” in the Big Apple, in tribute to the company's commitment to recycling and the environment.&lt;ref name="silive.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2013/09/staten_island_papermill_produc.html|title=Staten Island Mill Marks Its 5 Millionth Ton of Recycled Paper|work=SILive.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a video posted on YouTube, entitled “NYC Mayor Salutes Pratt Industries,” Bloomberg cited a proclamation honoring Pratt's mill for having recycled 5 million tons of discarded paper since start-up in 1997.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Pratt also wants to ramp up Visy's logistics operations to help spearhead a four-fold increase in Australia's food exports to Asia, especially China.&lt;ref name="The Sydney Morning Herald"&gt;{{cite news|title=Planting seeds for food security|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/planting-the-seeds-for-food-security-20111115-1nh3s.html|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=2011-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visy is already the largest exporter of shipping containers from Australian ports at approximately 60,000 per year.&lt;ref name="eThe Australian Financial Review, November 2012"&gt;{{cite news|title=Pratt sees future in food exports|newspaper=The Australian Financial Review|date=2012-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since his return to Australia, Pratt has taken a strong interest in sustainable agriculture and [[food security]].  More than 70 percent of Visy's customers are in the food and beverage industries.

In April 2013, Pratt gave the keynote address at the Global Food Forum, a major international conference on food security he organized in partnership with [[The Australian]] newspaper. Pratt said it was possible for Australia to sustainably quadruple its current food production through greater support for farmers and food companies and eventually feed 200 million people.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/in-depth/global-food-forum Global Food Forum]". The Australian. April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The conference attracted leading political, agribusiness, food industry and academic figures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/in-depth/asia-food-bonanza-our-next-boom-says-anthony-pratt/story-fni2wt8c-1226623037094 Asia food bonanza 'our next boom', says Anthony Pratt] - "The Australian" April 18, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, Pratt was elected an executive member of the Australia-Japan Business Cooperation Committee, a group dedicated for more than 50 years to strengthening ties between the two countries. It includes some of the most prominent business leaders in Australia, and is chaired by former British Airways CEO and current News Corporation director Sir Rod Eddington (AO).&lt;ref name="Australia Japan Business Cooperation Committee"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.ajbcc.asn.au/uploads/5/6/2/3/5623680/ajbcc_memberslist_aug2013.pdf|title=AJBCC Members List|access-date=2013-10-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020120920/http://www.ajbcc.asn.au/uploads/5/6/2/3/5623680/ajbcc_memberslist_aug2013.pdf|archive-date=2014-10-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October, Pratt's growing business interests in Asia prompted Australia's new Prime Minister Tony Abbott to invite him on an official visit to Indonesia – the first overseas’ trip by the incoming leader.&lt;ref name="The Australian1"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/economics/abbotts-focus-on-international-trade-delights-ceos/story-e6frg926-1226731151648|title=

==Sustainability==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Visy Coolaroo Clean Energy.jpg|thumb|right|Visy Coolaroo Clean Energy]] --&gt;
Pratt has organised the build of a $50 million, 100% recycled plastics plant in Sydney. This plant will enable Visy to make its PET and HDPE bottles out of 100% recycled plastic resin for everything from soft drink bottles to shampoo bottles to milk bottles. At full capacity, this facility will remove some 2 billion plastic bottles from the waste stream and recycle them into new bottles.&lt;ref name="The Australian, March 2013"/&gt;

Visy-Pratt Industries USA have continued to build clean energy plants which now include facilities in Tumut, Atlanta, Ga., Melbourne and Queensland. These not only provide coal-free energy – thus reducing the company's carbon footprint – but they allow Visy to expand its recycling capabilities to beyond converting paper and plastics into 100% recycled products. It will also enable the company to convert almost all remaining garbage into clean energy, thus helping close down landfills.&lt;ref name="Plastics News"&gt;{{cite news|title=Visy flags $306 million clean-energy plan|newspaper=Plastics News|date=2011-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
Visy has won awards including the 2011 Australian Packaging Design Awards where it was named Overall Show Winner at the Packaging Council of Australia annual awards.&lt;ref name=PCA.org&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Southern Cross Packaging Design Awards|url=http://www.pca.org.au/awards2011/sx/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Visy and the Banksia Foundation – a leading Australian non-profit which promotes environmental excellence - teamed up to inaugurate the Richard Pratt-Banksia CEO Award. The award recognizes an individual executive's contributions towards the economic, social and environmental sustainability achievements of the organisation or company he/she leads. The award was named in honour of Pratt, who was seen as one of Australia's leading agents of change in the environmental sector. The 2013 winner was Ravi Naidu, CEO of the Cooperative Research Centre for Contamination Assessment and Remediation of the Environment. Naidu is a national leader in his field.&lt;ref name=Scinews.com.au&gt;{{cite web|title=Banksia Award for Cleanup Leader|url=http://scinews.com.au/releases/851/view}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Wong was executive vice president of [[Nan Ya Plastics]], an FPG subsidiary, until a widely publicized affair (and the resulting 14% drop in FPG stocks) led to his dismissal in December 1995.  His father then “banished” Wong to the United States, where he spent one year teaching at the [[Haas School of Business|business school]] of the [[University of California, Berkeley]].  While in the United States, Wong met [[Jiang Mianheng]], son of [[Jiang Zemin]], the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]] at that time.&lt;ref name=FinancialTimes&gt;{{cite web|title=China’s Power Families|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/6b983f7a-ca9e-11e1-8872-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3rcGtGyt6|website=Financial Times|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Wong and Jiang Mianheng co-founded the US$1.63 billion [[Grace Semiconductor Manufacturing]] Corp. joint venture in [[Shanghai]], [[China]].  Though Wong serves as president and [[CEO]] of that company, Wong himself is not a stockholder, due to cross-strait investment restrictions imposed by the [[Republic of China]] (ROC).&lt;ref name="WallStreetJournal" /&gt;  Wong also serves as chair of the [[Hung Jen Group]] (宏仁集團) and chair of the [[Grace THW Group]] (宏仁企业集团),&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{cite web|last1=Flannery|first1=Russell|title=20 Taiwan Businesspeople To Watch -- Winston Wong|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/russellflannery/2012/06/21/20-taiwan-businesspeople-to-watch-winston-wong/|website=Forbes|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are heavily invested in mainland China’s petrochemical and electronics industries, respectively.&lt;ref name=Reuters&gt;{{cite web|title=Winston Wong Bio-Inspired Ice Vehicle Premiered at NCKU|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/07/idUS34855+07-Jun-2011+BW20110607|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Winston Wong Centre for Bio-Inspired Technology]] was created at Imperial College London in 2009.&lt;ref name=ImperialCollege2&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Centre|url=http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/bioinspiredtechnology/about|website=Centre for Bio-Inspired Technology|publisher=Imperial College|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Wong was named to “Top 100 Chinese for Economic Achievements and Contributions” list by ''Management World Magazine''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. Winston Wong Named to "Top 100 Chinese for Economic Achievements and Contributions" List|url=http://www.winston-wong.com/en/news/dr-winston-wong-named-to-top-100-chinese-for-economic-achievements-and-contributions-list|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support for Trade Agreements Between Taiwan-NAFTA/United States==
As an entrepreneur, Wong has long been a vocal supporter for increased levels of trade cooperation between Taiwan and the West, and free trade agreements in general.  On 26 February 2012, [https://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2012/02/26/a-free-trade-agenda-for-the-u-s-and-taiwan/ Forbes] featured an OP/ED written by Wong in which he discussed, “A Free Trade Agenda For the U.S. and Taiwan”. The premise of the article being that despite global exports totaling $274 billion in 2010, Taiwan has had difficulty establishing a footprint in substantial global trade agreements. Because of Taiwan’s complex diplomatic relations, it has had trouble entering substantial trade pacts with the economic powerhouses of the United States and North American Free Trade Agreement.&lt;ref name=Forbes2&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wong|first1=Winston|title=A Free Trade Agenda For the U.S. and Taiwan|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2012/02/26/a-free-trade-agenda-for-the-u-s-and-taiwan/|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even so, Wong argues that free-trade agreements with several Central American nations, as well as with Singapore have proven Taiwan worthy of inclusion. Wong has pointed to the increased quality of life from “survivor” to “consumer” and entrance into the middle class for millions of people in China, India, and Brazil in advocacy for increased trade cooperation with Taiwan.

==Moon Regan TransAntarctic Expedition Sponsorship==
In June 2010, Winston Wong agreed to be the main sponsor of the [[Moon-Regan Trans-Antarctic expedition]] led by [[Andrew Regan]] and Andrew Moon.&lt;ref name=Transantarctic&gt;{{cite web|title=THE WINSTON WONG BIO-INSPIRED ICE VEHICLE (BIV)|url=http://www.transantarcticexpedition.com/civ|website=Transantarctic Expedition|publisher=Transantarctic Expedition|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Expedition will travel 3,600 miles across Antarctica, from Patriot Hills on the west coast to the South Pole, heading north from there through the Trans-Antarctic Mountain Range, down the [[Leverett Glacier]] and across the [[Ross Ice Shelf]] to the coast at McMurdo.&lt;ref name=LiveScience&gt;{{cite web|title=Man to Attempt Fastest Antarctic Crossing|url=http://www.livescience.com/29703-antarctica-crossing-100923.html|website=Live Science|publisher=Live Science|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The team is travelling in three vehicles across Antarctica, including two mobile laboratories and the Winston Wong Bio-Inspired Ice Vehicle (WWBIV). The WWBIV will be the first bio-fuelled vehicle on Antarctica to endeavour to reach the [[Geographic South Pole]].&lt;ref name=Imperial&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Colin|title=Imperial technology supports expedition across the most inhospitable continent on Earth|url=http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/newssummary/news_11-6-2010-12-4-0|website=Imperial College London|publisher=Imperial College|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Workers' control''' is [[participatory management|participation in the management]] of factories and other commercial enterprises by the people who work there.  It has been variously advocated by [[anarchists]], [[socialists]], [[communists]], [[social democrats]], [[Distributism|Distributionists]] and [[Christian democrats]], and has been combined with various [[socialist economics|socialist]] and [[mixed economy]] systems.

[[Workers' council]]s are a form of workers' control. [[Council communism]], such as in the early [[Soviet Union]], advocates workers' control through workers councils and [[factory committee]]s. [[Syndicalism]] advocates workers' control through [[trade unions]]. [[Guild socialism]] advocates workers' control through a revival of the [[guild]] system. [[Participatory economics]] represents a recent variation on the idea of workers' control.

Workers' control can be contrasted to control of the economy via the state, such as [[nationalisation|nationalization]] and [[central planning]] (see [[state socialism]]) versus control of the [[means of production]] by owners, which workers can achieve through employer provided stock purchases, direct stock purchases, etc., as found in capitalism.

== By Country ==

=== Australia ===
The [[Industrial Workers of the World]] had established a limited amount of workers control within [[Queensland]] by working with the [[Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union]] during the 1910s. There was also a brief wave of workers' control in the 1970s, where workers briefly took over the [[Sydney Opera House]] construction site in 1972, the [[Whyalla]] glove factory was occupied and restarted as a women's only [[worker cooperative]] and the [[Nymboida, New South Wales|Nymboida]] mine workers resisted closure and kept the mine running under workers' control for an additional four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=New Forms of Worker Organization: The Syndicalist and Autonomist Restoration of Class Struggle|last=Ness|first=Immanuel|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indonesia ===
Several instances of workers control were recorded in the [[Indonesian Revolution]] in 1945 and 1946. Beginning with railway workers taking over train stations across [[Java]] a few weeks after the declaration of independence. Plantation and factory workers also took control of their workplace and ran them autonomously for months before the Indonesian government seized control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ours to Master and to Own: Workers Control from the Commune to the Present|last=Ness|first=Immanuel|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''World Trade Center Barcelona''' is a [[business park]] located in [[Barcelona]], opened on 22 July 1999. This business centre is located on the waterfront close to the city centre, and has 40,000 [[Square metre|m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] of rented [[office]] and a [[conference centre]], conventions and meeting spaces with 20 different rooms.

WTCB building structure was inspired by the shape of a boat surrounded by the [[Mediterranean Sea]], and created by American architect [[Henry N. Cobb]]. The arrangement of the four buildings in a circle creates a central plaza of 2,500 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where shops and restaurants provide services to the users of the complex. The four towers house offices for rent, a congress centre and the Hotel Grand Marina.

Complex design allows renting offices from 40 to 3,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in a single plant. The flexibility of space is also a feature of the convention centre, offering the possibility of organising meetings of 8 to large events with up to 1,500 attendees.
