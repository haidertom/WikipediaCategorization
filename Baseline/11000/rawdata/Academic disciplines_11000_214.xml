'''Absolute pitch''' (AP), widely referred to as '''''perfect pitch''''', is a rare auditory phenomenon characterized by the ability of a person to identify or re-create a given [[musical note]] without the benefit of a reference tone.&lt;ref name="phil-494"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Deutsch, D. | title=Absolute pitch In D.

AP can be demonstrated via linguistic labeling ("naming" a note), auditory imagery,{{clarify|reason=This is puzzling. How does the auditory imagery get out of the person's brain?|date=October 2016}} or sensorimotor responses. For example, an AP possessor can accurately reproduce a heard tone on a musical instrument without "hunting" for the correct pitch.&lt;ref name="Zatorre, 1989"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert |last=Zatorre |year=1989 |title=Multiple coding strategies in the retention of musical tones by possessors of absolute pitch|journal=Memory &amp; Cognition |volume= 17 |issue=5 |pages=582–589 |doi=10.3758/BF03197081 |last2=Beckett |first2=Christine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zatorre, 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert |last=Zatorre |date=July 2003 |title=Absolute pitch: a model for understanding the influence of genes and development on neural and cognitive function |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=6 |issue=7 |pages=692–695 |doi=10.1038/nn1085 |pmid=12830161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers estimate the occurrence of AP to be 1 in 10,000 people.&lt;ref name="Sacks1995"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Oliver Sacks |date=May 1995 |title=Letters: Musical Ability |journal=Science |volume=268 |issue=5211 |pages=621–622 |doi=10.1126/science.7732360 |pmid=7732360|bibcode=1995Sci...268..621S |last2=Schlaug |last3=Jancke |last4=Huang |last5=Steinmetz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, absolute pitch implies some or all of the following abilities, achieved without a reference tone:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Parncutt, R. |author2=Levitin, D. J. |year=2001 |title=The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians |chapter=Absolute Pitch |editor=Sadie, S. |publisher=Macmillan |location=London |isbn=1-56159-239-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Identify by name individual [[pitch (music)|pitches]] (e.g. F{{music|sharp}}, A, G, C) played on various instruments.
* Name the [[key (music)|key]] of a given piece of tonal music.
* Reproduce a piece of tonal music in the correct key days after hearing it.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}
* Identify and name all the tones of a given [[chord (music)|chord]] or other tonal mass.
* Accurately sing a named pitch.
* Name the pitches of common everyday sounds such as [[vehicle horn|car horns]] and [[Alarm device|alarms]].
* Name the frequency of a pitch (e.g. that G{{music|#}}4  is 415Hz) after hearing it.

People may have absolute pitch along with the ability of [[relative pitch]], and relative and absolute pitch work together in actual musical listening and practice, but strategies in using each skill vary.&lt;ref name="Miyazaki, 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Ken'ichi |last=Miyazaki |date=June 2004 |title=How well do we understand absolute pitch? |journal=Acoustical Science and Technology |volume=25 |issue=6 |pages=270–282 |doi=10.1250/ast.25.426 |url=http://psyche.ge.niigata-u.ac.jp/Psyche/Miyazaki/Papers/Miyazaki2004.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816070421/http://psyche.ge.niigata-u.ac.jp/Psyche/Miyazaki/Papers/Miyazaki2004.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-08-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those with absolute pitch may train their relative pitch and there has been a reported case of 6 adults in China (with previous musical training) acquiring absolute pitch through specific tonal training.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/03/355933&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, two studies by Harvard and the University of Chicago have shown Valproate, a medication used to treat epilepsy and severe depression, may re-open the "critical period" of learning making the acquisition of absolute pitch, as well as languages, potentially as efficient for adults as for children.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.uchicago.edu/story/acquiring-perfect-pitch-may-be-possible-some-adults&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://news.uchicago.edu/story/acquiring-perfect-pitch-may-be-possible-some-adults&lt;/ref&gt; Adults who possess relative pitch but do not already have absolute pitch can also learn "pseudo-absolute pitch" and become able to identify notes in a way that superficially resembles absolute pitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Levitin, D.J. |year=2008 |title=Music Meets Medicine, Proceedings of the Signe and Ane Gyllenberg Foundation |chapter=Absolute pitch: Both a curse and a blessing |editor1=Clockars, M. |editor2=Peltomaa, M. |pages=124–132 |publisher=Signe and Ane Gyllenberg Foundation |location=Helsinki, Finland}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, training absolute pitch can require considerable motivation, time, and effort, and learning is not retained without constant practice and reinforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Meyer, M |title=On memorizing absolute pitch |journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | volume=28 |year=1956 |pages=718–719 |doi=10.1121/1.1908465 |issue=4|bibcode = 1956ASAJ...28..718M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific studies==

===History of study and terminologies===
Scientific study of absolute pitch appears to have commenced in the 19th century, focusing on the phenomenon of musical pitch and methods of measuring it.&lt;ref name=Ellis1876&gt;{{Cite journal |date=November 6, 1876 |author=Ellis, Alexander J |title=On the Sensitiveness of the Ear to Pitch and Change of Pitch in Music |journal=Journal of the Royal Musical Association |pages=1 |series=(published until 1945 as Proceedings of the Musical Association)|volume=3 |issue=1 |doi=10.1093/jrma/3.1.1 |url=http://www.aruffo.com/eartraining/research/articles/ellis76.pdf |accessdate=24 August 2010 |postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would have been difficult for any notion of absolute pitch to have formed earlier because pitch references were not consistent. For example, the note now known as 'A' varied in different local or national musical traditions between what would now be considered as G sharp and B flat before the standardisation of the late 19th century. While the term ''absolute pitch'', or ''absolute ear'', was in use by the late 19th century by both British&lt;ref name=Bosanquet1876&gt;{{Cite journal |year=1876 |author=Bosanquet, R.H.M |title=An Elementary Treaties on Musical Intervals and Temperament |series=with an Account of an Enharmonic Harmonium Exhibited in the Loan Collection of Scientific Instruments |place=London |publisher=Macmillan and Co |page=xiv (n17 in electronic page field) |url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924022233088#page/n5/mode/2up |accessdate=24 August 2010 |postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and German researchers,&lt;ref name=vonKries&gt;{{Cite journal |year=1892 |author=von Kries, J |title=Über das absolute Gehör (About the perfect pitch) |language=German |journal=Zeitschrift für Psychologie |volume=3 |pages=257–79 |url=http://www.aruffo.com/eartraining/research/articles/kreis92.htm |accessdate=24 August 2010 |postscript=}} [http://www.aruffo.com/eartraining/research/articles/kreis92e.htm Translation by Christopher Aruffo, www.acousticlearning.com]&lt;/ref&gt; its application was not universal; other terms such as ''musical ear'',&lt;ref name=Ellis1876/&gt; ''absolute tone consciousness'',&lt;ref name=Otto07&gt;{{Cite journal |year=1907 |author=Abraham, O |title=Das absolute Tonbewußtsein und die Musik (Absolute tone consciousness and music) |language=German |journal=Sammelbände der Internationalen Musikgesellschaft |volume=8 |pages=486–91 |url=http://www.aruffo.com/eartraining/research/articles/abraham07.htm |accessdate=25 August 2010 |postscript=}} [http://www.aruffo.com/eartraining/research/articles/abraham07e.htm Translation by Christopher Aruffo, www.acousticlearning.com]&lt;/ref&gt; or ''positive pitch''&lt;ref name="Copp 1916"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Copp, E.F. |year=1916 |title=Musical Ability |journal=Journal of Heredity |volume=7 |pages=297–305 |url=http://www.aruffo.com/eartraining/fletcher/copp.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; were also used to refer to the ability. The skill is not exclusively musical, or limited to human perception; absolute pitch has been demonstrated in animals such as bats, wolves, gerbils, and birds, for whom specific pitches facilitate identification of mates or meals.&lt;ref name=Brown1999&gt;{{Cite journal |date=4 December 1999 |author=Brown, Kathryn |title=Striking the Right Note |journal=[[New Scientist]] |volume= 164 |issue=2215 |pages=38–41 |postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Difference in cognition, not elementary sensation===
Physically and functionally, the auditory system of an absolute listener does not appear to be different from that of a non-absolute listener.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sergeant, D. |title=Experimental investigation of absolute pitch |journal=Journal of Research in Music Education |volume=17 |year=1969 |pages=135–143 |doi=10.2307/3344200 |issue=1 |publisher=Journal of Research in Music Education, Vol. 17, No. 1 |jstor=3344200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, "it reflects a particular ability to analyze frequency information, presumably involving high-level cortical processing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gregersen, P. K. |title=Instant Recognition: The Genetics of Pitch Perception |journal=American Journal of Human Genetics | volume=62 |year=1998 |pages=221–223 |doi=10.1086/301734 |pmid=9463341 |issue=2 |pmc=1376907}}&lt;/ref&gt; Absolute pitch is an act of cognition, needing memory of the frequency, a label for the frequency (such as "B-flat"), and exposure to the range of sound encompassed by that categorical label. Absolute pitch may be directly analogous to recognizing [[color]]s, [[phoneme]]s (speech sounds), or other categorical perception of sensory stimuli. Just as most people have learned to recognize and name the color ''blue'' by the range of frequencies of the electromagnetic radiation that are perceived as [[light]], it is possible that those who have been exposed to musical notes together with their names early in life will be more likely to identify, for example, the note C.&lt;ref name="Ref-1"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Takeuchi, A. H. |author2=Hulse, S. H. |title=Absolute pitch |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=113 |year=1993 |pages=345–361 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.113.2.345 |pmid=8451339 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Absolute pitch may also be related to certain genes, possibly an [[autosomal]] [[dominant gene]]tic trait,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Profita, J. |author2=Bidder, T. G. |title=Perfect pitch |journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics |volume=29 |year=1988 |pages=763–771 |doi=10.1002/ajmg.1320290405 |pmid=3400722 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Baharloo, S. |author2=Johnston, P.

===Influence by music experience===
Absolute pitch sense appears to be influenced by cultural exposure to music, especially in the familiarization of the [[Equal temperament|equal-tempered]] [[musical scale|C-major scale]]. Most of the absolute listeners that were tested in this respect identified the C-major tones more reliably and, except for B, more quickly than the five "black key" tones,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Miyazaki, K. |title=The speed of musical pitch identification by absolute-pitch possessors |journal=Music Perception |volume=8 |year=1990 |pages=177–188 |doi=10.2307/40285495}}&lt;/ref&gt; which corresponds to the higher prevalence of these tones in ordinary musical experience. One study of Dutch non-musicians also demonstrated a bias toward using C-major tones in ordinary speech, especially on syllables related to emphasis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Braun, M. |title=Absolute pitch in emphasized speech |journal=Acoustics Research Letters Online |volume=3 |year=2002 |pages=77–82 |doi=10.1121/1.1472336 |issue=2| url=http://scitation.aip.org/getpdf/servlet/GetPDFServlet?filetype=pdf&amp;id=ARLOFJ000003000002000077000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;prog=normal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linguistics===
Absolute pitch is more common among speakers of [[tonal language]]s, such as most dialects of [[Chinese language|Chinese]] or [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], which often depend on pitch variation as the means of distinguishing words that otherwise sound the same—e.g., [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]] with four possible tonal variations, [[Cantonese]] with six, [[Southern Min]] with seven or eight (depending on dialect), and Vietnamese with six.&lt;ref name=jasa138th&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deutsch | first1 = D. | last2 = Henthorn | first2 = T. | last3 = Dolson | first3 = M. | title = Tone Language Speakers Possess Absolute Pitch | url = | journal = Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |year=1999 | volume = 106 | issue = | page = 2267 |laysummary=http://www.acoustics.org/press/138th/deutsch.htm|laysource=Acoustics.org | doi=10.1121/1.427738|bibcode = 1999ASAJ..106.2267D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jasa148th&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deutsch | first1 = D. | last2 = Henthorn | first2 = T. | last3 = Marvin | first3 = E. | last4 = Xu | first4 = H. | title = Perfect Pitch in Tone Language Speakers Carries Over to Music | journal = Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |year= 2005 | volume = 116 | issue = | page = 2580 |laysource=AIP|laysummary=http://www.aip.org/148th/deutsch.html | doi = 10.1121/1.4808626 |bibcode = 2004ASAJ..116.2580D}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speakers of [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] have been reported to speak a word in the same absolute pitch (within a quarter-tone) on different days; it has therefore been suggested that absolute pitch may be acquired by infants when they learn to speak a tonal language&lt;ref name="deu-2004"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Deutsch, D. |author2=Henthorn T. |author3=Dolson, M. |title=Absolute pitch, speech, and tone language: Some experiments and a proposed framework |journal=Music Perception |volume=21 |pages=339–356 |year=2004 |doi=10.1525/mp.2004.21.3.339 |issue=3|url=http://philomel.com/pdf/MP-2004-21_339-356.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; (and possibly also by infants when they learn to speak a [[Pitch accent|pitch-accent language]]). However, the brains of tonal-language speakers do not naturally process musical sound as language;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Gandour, J |author2=Wong, D. |author3=Hutchins, G. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Pitch processing in the human brain is influenced by language experience |journal=NeuroReport |volume=9 |year=1998 |pages=2115–2119 |doi=10.1097/00001756-199806220-00038 |pmid=9674604 |issue=9 |url=http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~gandour/publications/neurp_98.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060912000200/http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~gandour/publications/neurp_98.pdf |archivedate=2006-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps such speakers are more likely to acquire absolute pitch for musical tones when they later receive musical training. Many native speakers of a tone language, even those with little musical training, are observed to sing a given song consistently with regard to pitch. Among music students of East Asian ethnic heritage, those who speak a tone language very fluently have a much higher prevalence of absolute pitch than those who do not speak a tone language.&lt;ref name="phil-jasa-2006"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Deutsch, D. |author2=Henthorn, T. |author3=Marvin, E. |author4=Xu H-S |last-author-amp=yes|title=Absolute pitch among American and Chinese conservatory students: Prevalence differences, and evidence for a speech-related critical period |journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |volume=119 |pages=719–722 |year=2006 |doi=10.1121/1.2151799 |pmid=16521731 |issue=2|bibcode = 2006ASAJ..119..719D | url=http://philomel.com/pdf/JASA-2006_119_719-722.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deu-2009"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Deutsch, D. |author2=Dooley, K. |author3=Henthorn, T. |author4=Head, B. |title=Absolute pitch among students in an American music conservatory: Association with tone language fluency |journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |volume=125 |pages=2398–2403 |year=2009 |doi=10.1121/1.3081389 |pmid=19354413 |issue=4|bibcode = 2009ASAJ..125.2398D | url=http://philomel.com/pdf/JASA-2009_125_2398-2403.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="phil-588"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Deutsch, D. |author2=Li, X. |author3=Shen, J. |last-author-amp=yes | title=Absolute pitch among students at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music: A large-scale direct-test study | journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | volume=134 | pages=3853–3859 | year=2013 | doi=10.1121/1.4824450 |url=http://philomel.com/pdf/JASA_2013_134_3853-3859.pdf|format=PDF |bibcode = 2013ASAJ..134.3853D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible that African level-tone languages—such as [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Connell, B. |author2=Ladd, D. R. |title=Aspects of pitch realization in Yoruba |journal=Phonology |volume=7 |year=1990 |pages=1–29 |doi=10.1017/S095267570000110X}}&lt;/ref&gt; with three pitch levels, and [[Mambila language|Mambila]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Connell, B. |title=The perception of lexical tone in Mambila |journal=Language and Speech |volume=43 |year=2000 |pages=163–182 |doi=10.1177/00238309000430020201 |pmid= 11064955 |issue= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; with four—may be better suited to study the role of absolute pitch in speech than the pitch and contour tone languages of East Asia.

Speakers of European languages have been found to make subconscious use of an absolute pitch memory when speaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Braun, M. |title=Speech mirrors norm-tones: Absolute pitch as a normal but precognitive trait |journal=Acoustical Society of America: Acoustics Research Letters Online |volume=2 |year=2001 |pages=85–90 |doi=10.1121/1.1376728 |issue=3 |url=http://ojps.aip.org/getpdf/servlet/GetPDFServlet?filetype=pdf&amp;id=ARLOFJ000002000003000085000001&amp;idtype=cvips |format=PDF }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perception===

This phenomenon is apparently unrelated to musical training. The skill may be associated more closely with vocal production. Violin students learning the [[Suzuki method]] are required to memorize each composition in a fixed key and play it from memory on their instrument, but they are not required to sing. When tested, these students did not succeed in singing the memorized Suzuki songs in the original, fixed key.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Saah, Victoria |author2=Marvin, Elizabeth West |year=2004 |title=Absolute memory of learned melodies in children trained by the Suzuki violin method |journal=Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Music Perception and Cognition |pages=736–739 |url=http://www.icmpc8.umn.edu/proceedings/ICMPC8/PDF/AUTHOR/MP040009.PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810004816/http://www.icmpc8.umn.edu/proceedings/ICMPC8/PDF/AUTHOR/MP040009.PDF |archivedate=2011-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible problems===
Musicians with absolute perception may experience difficulties which do not exist for other musicians. Because absolute listeners are capable of recognizing that a musical composition has been transposed from its original key, or that a pitch is being produced at a nonstandard frequency (either sharp or flat), a musician with absolute pitch may become distressed upon perceiving tones believed to be "wrong" or hearing a piece of music "in the wrong key." This can especially apply to Baroque music that is recorded in Baroque tuning (usually A = 415&amp;nbsp;Hz as opposed to 440&amp;nbsp;Hz, ''i.e.'', roughly a half step or semitone lower than standard concert pitch).&lt;ref name="Sacks, O. 2007"&gt;{{cite book |author=Sacks, O. |year=2007 |title=Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain |publisher=Knopf |location=New York |isbn=1-4000-4081-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An absolute listener may also use absolute strategies for tasks which are more efficiently accomplished with [[relative pitch|relative strategies]], such as transposition&lt;ref name="miy_1993"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Miyazaki, K. |title=Absolute pitch as an inability: Identification of musical intervals in a tonal context |journal=Music Perception |volume=11 |year=1993 |pages=55–72 |doi=10.2307/40285599|jstor=40285599}}&lt;/ref&gt; or producing harmony for tones whose frequencies do not match standard [[equal temperament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Harris, G. B. |year=1974 |title=Categorical perception and absolute pitch |publisher=University of Western Ontario |location=Ontario}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible for some musicians to have displaced absolute pitch, where all notes are slightly flat or slightly sharp of their respective pitch as defined by a given convention.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} This may arise from learning the pitch names from an instrument that was tuned to a concert pitch convention other than the one in use, ''e.g.'', A = 435&amp;nbsp;Hz (the [[Paris Opera]] convention of the late 19th and early 20th centuries) as opposed to the Anglo-American modern standard A = 440&amp;nbsp;Hz. When playing in groups with other musicians, this may lead to playing in a tonality that is slightly different from that of the rest of the group.

===Synesthesia===
Absolute pitch shows a genetic overlap with [[synesthesia]]/[[ideasthesia]],&lt;ref name=gregersen_2013/&gt;{{clarify|reason=This contradicts with earlier statements in the article, which imply that the genetic status of perfect pitch is not verified. Which is it?|date=October 2016}} and some individuals with music-related synesthesia also have perfect pitch.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} They may associate certain notes or keys with different colors, enabling them to tell what any note or key is. It is unknown how many people with perfect pitch are also synesthetes.

==Correlation with musical talent==
Absolute pitch is not a prerequisite for skilled musical performance or composition. However, musicians with absolute pitch tend to perform better on musical transcription tasks (controlling for age of onset and amount of musical training) compared with those without absolute pitch.&lt;ref name="phil-446"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Dooley, K. |author2=Deutsch, D. |last-author-amp=yes| title=Absolute pitch correlates with high performance on musical dictation | journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | volume= 128 | issue=2| pages= 890–3| year=2010 | pmid=20707458 | doi=10.1121/1.3458848 |bibcode = 2010ASAJ..128..890D}} [http://philomel.com/pdf/JASA-2010_128_890-893.pdf PDF Document]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that musicians with absolute pitch perform worse than those without absolute pitch on recognition of musical intervals.&lt;ref name="miyazaki"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Miyazaki K. | title=Perception of relative pitch with different references: Some absolute-pitch listeners can't tell musical interval names | journal=Perception and Psychophysics | volume=57 | issue=7 | pages= 962–970 | year=1995 | doi=10.3758/bf03205455| pmid=8532499}} [http://www.springerlink.com/content/d11h926866110564/fulltext.pdf PDF Document]&lt;/ref&gt; However, experiments on which this conclusion was based contained an artifact{{Clarify|reason=How defined and of what kind?

Owing to uncertainty in the historical record, it is often impossible to determine whether notable composers and musicians of the past had absolute pitch. Since absolute pitch is rare in European musical culture,&lt;ref name="deu_2006b"/&gt; claims that any particular musician possessed it are difficult to evaluate. Among composers of the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] and [[Classical music era|Classical]] eras, evidence is available only for [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], who is documented to have demonstrated the ability at age 7.&lt;ref name="phil-45"&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1121/1.2961141 | author=Deutsch, D. | title=The Enigma of Absolute Pitch | journal=Acoustics Today | volume=2 | pages=11–18 | year=2006 | issue=4}} [http://philomel.com/pdf/AT-2006_2_2.pdf PDF Document]&lt;/ref&gt; Experts have only surmised that [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] had it, as indicated from some excerpts from his letters. By the 19th century, it became more common for the presence of absolute pitch to be recorded, identifying the ability to be present in musicians such as [[Camille Saint-Saëns]] and [[John Philip Sousa]].&lt;ref&gt; Naxos.

==Relative pitch==
{{Main article|Relative pitch}}
Many musicians have quite good [[relative pitch]], a skill that can be learned through [[ear training]]. With practice, it is possible to listen to a single known pitch once (from a [[pitch pipe]] or a [[tuning fork]]) and then have stable, reliable pitch identification by comparing the notes heard to the stored memory of the tonic pitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brady, P. T. |title=Fixed-scale mechanism of absolute pitch |journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |volume=48 |year=1970 |pages=883–887 |doi=10.1121/1.1912227 |pmid=5480385 |issue=4|bibcode = 1970ASAJ...48..883B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike absolute pitch, this skill is dependent on a recently perceived [[tonal center]].

'''Apostatic selection''' is a form of negative [[frequency-dependent selection]]. It describes the survival of individual [[prey]] animals that are different (through [[mutation]]) from their species in a way that makes it more likely for them to be ignored by their [[predator]]s. It operates on [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]] species, species which have different forms. In apostatic selection, the common forms of a species are preyed on more than the rarer forms, giving the rare forms a [[natural selection|selective advantage]] in the population.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford University Press. (2013). Oxford Reference. Retrieved 21 November 2013, from Apostatic Selection: http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095419471&lt;/ref&gt;  It has also been discussed that apostatic selection acts to stabilize prey polymorphisms.

Apostatic selection was used in 1962 by [[Bryan Clarke]] in reference to predation on polymorphic [[grove snail]]s and since then it has been used interchangeably with negative frequency-dependent selection.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, B. 1962. Balanced polymorphism and the diversity of sympatric species. Pp. 47–70 in D. Nichols ed. Taxonomy and Geography. Systematics Association, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;  The behavioural basis of apostatic selection was initially ignored, but eventually established by A.B Bond&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=J.M|date=May 1984|title=Apostatic Selection on Prey that Match the Background|url=https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.qe2a-proxy.mun.ca/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1095-8312.1984.tb00140.x|journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society|volume=23|pages=221–228|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apostatic selection can also apply to the predator if the predator has various morphs. There are multiple concepts that are closely linked with apostatic selection. One is the idea of prey switching, which is another term used to look at a different aspect of the same phenomenon, as well as the concept of a [[search image]].  Search images are relevant to apostatic selection as it is how a predator is able to detect an organism as a possible prey. Apostatic selection is important in [[evolution]] because it can sustain a stable equilibrium of morph frequencies, and hence maintains large amounts of genetic diversity in natural populations.&lt;ref name=allen&gt;Allen, J.A. (1988) Frequency-dependent selection by predators. Philos. T. Roy. Soc. B 319, 485–503&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note however, that a rare morph being present in a population does not always mean that apostatic selection will occur, and the rare morph could be targeted at a higher rate. From a predatory view, being able to select for rare morphs actually increases its own fitness&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rutz|first=Christian|date=8 May 2012|title=Predator Fitness Increases with Selectivity for Odd Prey|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982212003156|journal=Current Biology|volume=22|pages=820–824|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prey switching==

In [[prey switching]], predators switch from primary prey to an alternative food source for various reasons.&lt;ref name=suryan&gt;Suryan, R., Irons, D., &amp; Benson, J. (2000). Prey Switching and Variable Foraging Strategies of Black-Legged Kittiwakes and the Effect on Reproductive Success. The Condor , 374–384.&lt;/ref&gt; This is related to apostatic selection because when a rare morph is being selected for, it is going to increase in abundance in a specific population until it becomes recognized by a predator. Prey switching, therefore, seems to be a result of apostatic selection. Prey switching is related to prey preference as well as the abundance of the prey.&lt;ref name=suryan /&gt;

== Effects of Apostatic Selection and Polymorphisms on Populations ==
It has also been determined that apostatic selection causes stabilization of prey polymorphisms, and this is caused by limitations of the predators behaviours.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bond|first=A.B|date=15 August 2007|title=The Evolution of Color Polymorphism: Crypticity, Searching Images, and Apostatic Selection|url=|journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics|volume=38|pages=489–514|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the common prey type is more abundant, they should be able to produce more offspring and grow exponentially, at a much faster rate then those with the rare morph since they are in much smaller numbers. However, due to the fact that the common morph is preyed upon more frequently, it diminish the exponential rate that they are expected to reproduce in, thus maintaining the population in stable amounts of common and rare morphs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Essentially, unless and environmental change or a species evolves it produces a stable equilibrium.

==Search image==
[[File:Blue Tit (12416609855).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Blue tit]] searches for insect prey using a [[search image]], leaving scarcer types of prey untouched.]]

A search image is what an individual uses in order to detect their prey. For the predator to detect something as prey, it must fit their criteria. The rare morph of a species may not fit the search image, and thus not be seen as prey. This gives the rare morphs an advantage, as it takes time for the predator to learn a new search image.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fraser|first=B.A|last2=Hughes|first2=K.A|last3=Tosh|first3=D.N|last4=Rodd|first4=F.H|date=October 2013|title=The role of learning by a predator, Rivulus hartii, in the rare‐morph survival advantage in guppies|url=|journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology|volume=26|pages=2597–2605|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Search image shift require multiple encounters with the new form of prey, and since a rare morph is typically not encountered multiple times, especially in a row the prey gets left undetected.  An example of this is how a [[Blue tit]] searches for insect prey using a [[search image]], leaving scarcer types of prey untouched. Predatory birds such as insect-eating [[Tit (bird)|tits (''Parus'')]] sometimes look only for a single cryptic type of prey even though there are other equally palatable cryptic prey present at lower density.&lt;ref&gt;Dukas, Reuven, Kamil, Alan. (2000). Limited attention: the constraint underlying search image. Behavioral Ecology, 192–199.&lt;/ref&gt; Luuk Tinbergen supposed that this was because the birds formed a [[search image]], a typical image of a prey that a predator can remember and use to spot prey when that image is common.&lt;ref&gt;Tinbergen, L. (1960). The natural control of insects in pine woods. Factors influencing the intensity of predation by songbirds. Arch. Neerl. Zool. 13:265–343.&lt;/ref&gt; Having a search image can be beneficial because it increases proficiency of a predator in finding a common morph type.&lt;ref name=paulson&gt;Paulson, D. (2013). Predator Polymorphism and Apostatic Selection. Society for the Study of Evolution , 269–277.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hypothesis for polymorphism==

Apostatic selection serves as a hypothesis for [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]] because the variation it causes in prey. It is an explanation for why external polymorphism exists and this theory has been tested many times. Apostatic selection has been referred to as "selection for variation in its own sake".&lt;ref name=paulson /&gt; Apostatic selection has been used as an explanation for many types of polymorphism, including diversity in tropical insects. Selection on different morphs in tropical insects is high because there is pressure for phenotypes to look as different as possible from all others because the insects that have the lowest density in a population are the ones that are preyed on the least.&lt;ref&gt;Rand, A. S. (1967). Predator–prey interactions and the evolution of aspect diversity. Atas do Simposio sobre a Biota Amaz6nica 5 (Zool.): 73–83.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental Mechanisms ==
In order for apostatic selection to occur, and for the rare morph to have the advantage a variety of criteria needs to be met. First, there needs to be polymorphism present. In addition, the prey present can not be in equal proportions, since then there would not be a benefit to be able to detect either one.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Merilaita|first=Sami|last2=Ruxton|first2=Graeme|date=January 2009|title=Optimal apostatic selection: how should predators adjust to variation in prey frequencies?|url=|journal=Elsevier|volume=77|pages=239–245|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is related to frequency dependent predation, where as the predator obtains the greatest advantage from having a [[search image]] for the most common type of prey. This causes the most common form of  the prey is the most vulnerable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Horst|first=Jonathan|last2=Venable|first2=D.L|date=January 2018|title=Frequency‐dependent seed predation by rodents on Sonoran Desert winter annual plants|url=|journal=Ecology- Biological Society of America|volume=99|pages=196–203|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in prey detection of predators occurs, but the speed in which it occurs and the flexibility a predators search image in dependent on the environment.

If the frequency of the different prey types is continuously changes, the predator is not able to change their behavior at a rate in which will provide an advantage.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In these situations, the predators who show a more flexible behaviour and have a more broad [[search image]] are able to survive. In relation to apostatic selection, large changes in prey frequencies decreases the magnitude of the advantage of the rare morph if their predators have a flexible [[search image]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Also, the high changes in polymorphism frequencies can be an advantage to the prey with the rare morph. This is because the predators without the flexibility of their [[search image]] would have to have many encounters with the rare morph to change its [[search image]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Predators need multiple consistent encounters with a prey in order to form its [[search image]] around it.

Apostatic selection is also dependent on temporal variation. Since long periods of time are required for natural selection to act on predators, their degree of flexibility in their search image &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; can not be changed over a short time frame.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Therefore quickly arising rare morphs favors apostatic selection since the predators are not able to change their behavior and search image in that time frame. This is yet another biological process that is a victim to evolutionary time delay.

The predators are more quickly to adapt and decrease apostatic selection when a drastic and abrupt change to the prey frequencies occur.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This does not change the flexibility of the predators, but elicits a very high speed in the change of the search image.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Apostatic selection is most strong in environments in which the prey with the rare morphism match the background.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Behavioural Basis of Apostatic Selection ==
Most of the work done on the behavioural basis of apostatic selection was done by A.B Bond. It has been suggested that for frequency dependent predation, the amount of encounters with the prey aids to shape the predators prey detection.These ideas are based on the assumption that when the predator is learning foraging behaviour, they are going to obtain the common form more frequently. Since the predator is going to learn what is most frequently and commonly captured, the most common morph is what is identified as prey.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This concludes that their foraging behaviour is shaped by this learned preference, thus causing apostatic selection and a fitness benefit to the rare morphs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; From this, it was concluded that this search image formation and adaption is the mechanism that drives the most common prey type to be more easily distinguished from the environment, and thus be eaten more frequently.

==Experimental evidence==

Various types of experiments have been done to look into apostatic selection. Some involve artificial prey because it is a lot easier to control external variables in a simulated environment, though using wild specimens increases the studies [[external validity]] Often a computer screen simulation program is used on animals, often birds of prey, to detect for selection.&lt;ref name=Bond&gt;Bond, A., &amp; Kamil, A. (1998). Apostatic selection by blue jays produces balanced polymorphism in virtual prey. Nature , 594–596.&lt;/ref&gt; Another type looks into how apostatic selection can focus on the predator as well as the prey because predator plumage polymorphism can be another example of how apostatic selection works in a population. They hypothesized that a mutant predator morph will become more abundant in a population due to apostatic selection because the prey will not be able to recognize it as often as the common predator morph&lt;ref name=fowlie&gt;Fowlie, M., &amp; Kruger, O. (2003). The Evolution of plumage polymorphism in birds of prey and owls: the apostatic selection hypothesis revisited. Journal of Evolutionary Biology , 577–583.&lt;/ref&gt; '''.''' Apostatic selection has been observed in both humans and animals, proving that it is not exclusive to lower level organisms, and the cognition it uses is applicable to all organisms in which can display learning. Though a lot of this work has been experimental and lab controlled, there are some examples of it happening with both wild specimens and in the natural habitat of the species.

In [[hawk]]s, almost all of their polymorphism is found on their ventral side it allows for less common coloration to be favored since it will be recognized least.&lt;ref name=paulson /&gt; Polymorphism is defined by foraging strategies, one of which is apostatic selection.&lt;ref name=fowlie /&gt; Because of the different morphs and the varying selection on them, changes in prey detection maintain prey polymorphism due to apostatic selection.&lt;ref name=Bond /&gt;

Apostatic selection can be reflected in [[Batesian mimicry]]. [[Aposematism]] and apostatic selection is used to explain defensive signaling like [[Batesian mimicry]] in certain species.&lt;ref name=matthews&gt;Matthews, E. G. (1997). Signal-based frequency-dependent defense strategies and the evolution of mimicry. The American Naturalist, 213–222.&lt;/ref&gt; A paper by Pfenning et al., 2006 looks into this concept. In allopatric situations, situations where separate species overlap geographically, mimic phenotypes have a really high fitness and are selected for when their model is present but when it is absent, they suffer intense predation. In this article it was suggested that this is caused by apostatic selection because strength of selection is higher on the mimics that are hidden by their original model.&lt;ref&gt;Pfenning, D., Harper, G., Brumo, A., Harcombe, W., &amp; Pfenning, K. (2007). Population differences in predation on batesian mimics in allopatry with their model. Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology , 505–511.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Batesian mimicry, if the mimic is less common than the model, then the rare mimic phenotype is favored because the predator has continued reinforcement that the prey is harmful or unpalatable. When the mimic becomes more common than the model, it switches and is preyed upon much more often. Therefore, the dishonest signals in prey can be selected for or against depending on predation pressure.&lt;ref name=matthews /&gt;

An example in birds is observed within ground dwelling passerines, in which the wild birds were kept in their natural habitat but were presented with dimorphic prey (artificial).&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=November 1968|title=Evidence of Apostatic Selection by Wild Passerines|url=|journal=Nature|volume=220|pages=501–502|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two colors of prey were present in 9:1 ratios, and then the prey were switched so both colors were in the higher and lower ratio.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In all four of the passerine species that were observed, the more common morph of the artifical prey were consumed more frequently. regardless of the color of it.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This study also had a second component in which they allowed the birds to become familiar with one color of the prey, and then presented the dimorphic prey in equal amounts. In this case, the passerines consumed more of the prey that they were accustomed too.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This is consistent with the idea that the search image influences apostatic selection, and the more familiar form is encountered more making it preferred.

Apostatic selection has also been studied in cichlid fish, which presents a rare polymorphism, the gold ('Midas') colour morph.They discussed how apostatic selection a plausible mechanism for the maintenance of this Midas morph, and ruled out various other explanations for this morph. It was concluded that the rare morph is established by a difference in the predators detection probability of the Midas morph.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Torres-Dowall|first=Julian|last2=Golcher-Benavides|first2=Jimena|last3=Machado-Schiaffino|first3=Gonzalo|last4=Meyer|first4=Axel|date=September 2017|title=The role of rare morph advantage and conspicuousness in the stable gold‐dark colour polymorphism of a crater lake Midas cichlid fish|url=|journal=Journal of Animal Ecology|volume=86|pages=1044–1053|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One limitation of this study is that since the morphs in the wild are not able to be manipulated, no definite conclusions can be made, but the evidence predicts apostatic selection.

'''Arts integration''' is an approach to teaching that integrates the fine and performing arts as primary pathways to learning. Arts integration differs from traditional education by its inclusion of both the arts discipline and a traditional subject as part of learning (e.g. using improvisational drama skills to learn about conflict in writing.) The goal of arts integration is to increase knowledge of a general subject area while concurrently fostering a greater understanding and appreciation of the fine and performing arts.  The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts defines arts integration as "an approach to teaching in which students construct and demonstrate understanding through an art form. Students engage in a creative process which connects an art form and another subject and meets evolving objectives."

==History of arts education and arts integration==
Arts integration is related to [[Arts in education|arts education]] in schools. Arts education, while existing in different forms during the 19th century, gained popularity as part of [[John Dewey]]'s Progressive Education Theory. The first publication that describes a seamless interplay between the arts and other subjects (arts integration) taught in American schools was Leon Winslow's ''The Integrated School Art Program (1939).'' For the remainder of the 20th century, arts education's role in public schools ebbed and flowed with the country's political leanings and financial well-being.

According to Liora Bresler, during the 1970s and 1980s, two advocates for arts integration emerged: Harry Broudy and Elliot Eisner. Broudy advocated for the arts on the basis of strengthening the imagination. Broudy viewed imagination as an essential component of learning that should be cultivated in schools, and he advocated for the integration of aesthetic education into all subject matters in his work,'' Enlightened Cherishing''. Eisner followed Broudy, citing that the arts were important to varying types of [[cognition]]. He believed that arts brought about a deeper understanding of the world due to their interactivity—the arts move learning beyond what is written or read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bresler | first1 = Liora | year = | title = The Subservient, Co-Equal, Affective, and Social Integration Styles and their Implications for.. | url = | journal = Arts Education Policy Review | volume = 96 | issue = 5| page = 31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cassandra B. Whyte]] emphasized the importance of artistic experiences for students to encourage creative and independent thought processes that would be important throughout an individual's lifetime. The arts helped students with problem solving and decision making and those processing experiences could be adapted in general life situations.&lt;ref&gt;Whyte, Bolyard Cassandra. (1973). Creativity: An Integral Part of the Secondary School Curriculum.Education.Nov.-Dec.190-191.&lt;/ref&gt; Whyte advocated including aspects of art education with [[locus of control]] identification counseling experiences to help higher education students develop confidence in their unique problem solving abilities in the classroom and in life.&lt;ref&gt;Whyte, Cassandra B. (1978). Effective Counseling Methods for High-Risk College Freshmen.Measurement and Evaluation in Guidance.6. (4). January, 198-200.&lt;/ref&gt;

Formerly, [[No Child Left Behind]] legislation describes arts education as "essential to every child's education," and include it as one of the Core Subjects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ed.gov/teachers/how/tools/initiative/updates/040826.html The Importance of Arts Education] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071002052454/http://www.ed.gov/teachers/how/tools/initiative/updates/040826.html |date=October 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; No Child Left Behind legislation also emphasizes accountability through assessment (often taking the form of the standardized test.) While no standardized assessment has been mandated in any of the arts, the need for academic accountability in the arts, as well as in other academic subject areas, has led to increased research on and advocacy of arts integration and its impact on student learning.&lt;ref&gt;Please see Renaissance in the Classroom's sub-chapter entitled "The Arts in American Public Education: A Brief History" for a more comprehensive reading with additional references&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, [[Common Core State Standards Initiative|Common Core]] and close adaptions of it are changing the way schools approach learning. Common Core's approach to art integration is that it enhances education by making learning interesting and fun. With Common Core becoming the norm for many school districts through the United States, teachers are integrating art into the classroom now more than ever. The rise of popularity in art integration has increased the amount of resources available to include the classroom, making it easier than ever to use art integration in the classroom. 

==Arts integration research and advocacy==
Arts advocacy discourse currently presents two main opposing views in support of arts in education. The first points to economic grounds that art teaches "21st-century skills" like collaboration and innovation, which are necessary only as a means to breed productivity for the growth of the market. The second, alternative approach focuses instead on the philosophical value of creative inquiry that art instills in students, arguing lifelong development with no end in mind as a necessary habit borne out of an arts education. Tension between the utilitarian, workplace-focused view and the educational, growth-centered framework on advocacy continues to shape and reshape the arts education universe as revisions to the&amp;nbsp;[http://www.nationalartsstandards.org/ National Core Arts Standards]&amp;nbsp;reflect fluctuations in advocacy rhetoric.&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Logsdon|first=Leann F.|date=2013|title=Questioning the Role of "21st-Century Skills" in Arts Education Advocacy Discourse|jstor=43288769|journal=Music Educators Journal|volume=100|issue=1|pages=51–56|doi=10.2307/43288769}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Key players ===
The impetus for the arts integration is a growing body of research that demonstrates how learners experience success when taught why and how to use music, visual art, drama/dance, theatre and the literary arts to both express and understand ideas, thoughts and feelings. Critical Links,&lt;ref&gt;Deasy, Richard, et al. Critical Links : Learning in the Arts and Student Academic and Social Development.

James Catterall, arts education researcher and professor at [[University of California, Los Angeles]]'s Graduate School of Education and Information Studies, has collaborated with CAPE on publications.

[[Harvard University]]'s Graduate School of Education supports [https://web.archive.org/web/20070814120148/http://www.pzweb.harvard.edu/ Project Zero], an educational research group founded in 1967 by Nelson Goodman, which investigates learning in the arts. Former directors of Project Zero include David Perkins and [[Howard Gardner]]. Currently, it is directed by Steve Seidel, and has expanded its research in arts learning to include other branches of education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pzweb.harvard.edu/History/History.htm History of Project Zero] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611210538/http://pzweb.harvard.edu/History/History.htm |date=June 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Howard Gardner]]'s [[Theory of multiple intelligences]] has been used as part of the rationale for the use of integrated arts models in teaching and learning.

For over 30 years, [http://www.kennedy-center.org the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts] in Washington, D.C., has been offering arts integration learning opportunities for educators.  Locally, through its [http://www.kennedy-center.org/education/ceta/ Changing Education Through the Arts (CETA)] program, the Kennedy Center provides professional learning for Washington, D.C. area educators that are implementing arts integration in their classrooms or teaching about an art form.  To develop a school-wide culture of arts integration, a network of CETA schools partner with the Kennedy Center to engage their teachers in in-depth professional learning focused on arts integration.  The CETA program has added to the research about the impact of arts integration on students, teachers, and school culture through multiple evaluation studies.  To reach educators throughout the nation, the Kennedy Center hosts an annual Arts Integration Conference, in which educators actively explore arts integration concepts and strategies.  The Kennedy Center’s online resource, [http://artsedge.kennedy-center.org/educators.aspx ARTSEDGE], also hosts a web series of arts integration resources that explain the ‘what’ and ‘why’ of arts integration, provides examples of arts integration in practice, and links to a range of resources.  A series of Kennedy Center Seminars for Teaching Artists that focus on arts integration, as well as practices for developing strong arts-integrated residencies for students and workshops for teachers are available throughout the nation. A National Seminar for Teaching Artists is offered bi-annually at the Kennedy Center during the summer. 
Three other Kennedy Center national initiatives support practices and partnerships in arts integration and arts education: [http://www.kennedy-center.org/education/anygivenchild/ Any Given Child], [http://www.kennedy-center.org/education/partners/ Partners in Education], and [http://www.kennedy-center.org/education/vsa/ VSA].

[[The Kennedy Center]] Partners in Education, headquartered in [[Washington, DC]], is an organization that has promoted arts integration for over two decades.

ArtsNow [http://www.artsnowlearning.org] provides professional development training for educators, focused on building the skills needed to integrate arts across the curriculum. Through the innovative Foundational Training course, teachers learn to identify opportunities to integrate all art forms - visual, dance, and music - into lessons in all class subjects for grades K-12, meeting both state and national curriculum standards (including Common Core standards). ArtsNow offers free Ignite Curriculum Guides through its website.&lt;ref&gt;ArtsNow Learning, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

EducationCloset [http://educationcloset.com] provides professional development in arts integration and innovation in teaching.  With an annual Arts Integration conference, [https://educationcloset.com/integrated-curriculum/ Arts Integrated Curriculum], courses, webinars and publications available, teachers, artists, arts educators, administrators, and arts advocates can find rigorous, high-quality resources for Arts Integration which connect to Common Core State Standards and STEM.

With a focus on the classroom practice of arts integration, a nonprofit called Arts Integration Solutions (formerly the Opening Minds through the Arts Foundation) [http://www.artsintegration.com] provides professional development for teachers and program planning and implementation for schools and school districts. AiS has developed a set of tenets that are the basis for arts integration and a cycle that helps teachers develop daily lessons in math, science, reading and writing that use the arts to fully engage students. AiS has developed programming for use of arts integration in teaching the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and math) and Literacy.

==Art education obstacles==
The three major skills in education that are considered the “core” subjects to teach students include math, writing, and reading comprehension. These important areas are considered by many the tools for success for student achievement. A consequence of predominately emphasizing these three areas of academic study is a lack of attention to other major areas of academics, mainly the arts. Viewing the arts as insignificant has had a major impact on teaching creativity to students.

===No Child Left Behind===
The importance of teaching the arts to students has recently been viewed as less essential than teaching other core studies, particularly by school administrators. Educational institutions are attempting to maintain federal standards to receive government funding. These standards focus predominantly on subjects such as English and math and are also highly emphasized during standardized testing. If schools can improve student achievement within these areas, they do not become vulnerable to a loss or reduction in federal funding. Robin Pogrebin of the New York Times states, “In a time when President Bush’s “No Child Left Behind” policy emphasizes test results, the arts do not easily lend themselves to quantifiable measurements”.&lt;ref&gt;Pogrebin, Robin. [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/04/arts/design/04stud.html“Book Tackles Old Debate: Role of Art in Schools]. [[The New York Times]]. (2007). 7 Nov. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, schools are placing a large emphasis on teaching students to excel in these areas of study. This includes more time allotted for the instruction of these classes as well as a large amount of the school budget to enhance these courses.

===School budgets===
While a sizable amount of the educational budget is spent on these important areas of academic study, schools are finding that there is less money for what some would consider as non-essential courses, such as higher level music and art. According to the academic journal The Electronic Musician, “On March 2, 2011, both the House and Senate agreed to eliminate a number of small education programs at the U.S. Department of Education, including the complete defunding of the Arts in Education program, a $40 million fund that supports competitive grants and national initiatives”.&lt;ref&gt;"The FY11 Budget Deal: What Does It Mean For The Arts?." Electronic Musician 27.7 (2011): 13. Academic Search Premier. Web. 16 Nov. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; While small reductions to budgets are common during a recession, some states have reduced their arts budgets drastically. According to the Teaching Artists Journal, “In 2004, total state funding for the arts will drop to $272 million, a 23% decrease in just the last year. And nearly two-thirds of that total decrease comes from cutbacks in just three of the hardest hit states: California, Michigan and Florida”.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Heather. "The Simple Facts." Teaching Artist Journal 2.3 (2004): 189. Academic Search Premier. Web. 7 Nov. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; While the reduction of funding for the arts has been reduced nearly a quarter in different areas, educators often struggle to maintain their arts program as a vital skill to teach to students. The funds that have been reduced now disallow the arts to provide furnishings and supplies as well as instructor salaries that are essential to these programs. As a result, art courses are not regarded with the same amount of respect and students are denied a creative outlet within their education.

Budget issues and the reduction of spending for the arts has caused numerous schools to attempt to find additional sources to help support their arts program. School administrators frequently look towards state funding to assist in financing the arts. Grants and other means to finance the arts are increasingly becoming more frequent, but they are temporary solutions to fund these programs. Schools often work with local and state governments to receive income; however numerous state governments are experiencing other budget deficit issues and can rarely afford to finance such a program in the amount that is needed. So to help support the arts, often there is need for assistance from private contributors. Still, as with grants, private contributors cannot donate enough funds to adequately support the arts in education and cannot contribute as consistently as the government could. Funding the arts in education still remains a large and unresolved issue for many school districts nationwide.

===Practical uses===
Advocacy for the arts raises an issue of how essential teaching the arts to students actually is. Due to statistical analysis of a perceived lapse in mathematical and reading skills of our youth, many parents feel that importance of the arts is less crucial than other fundamental areas of academic study. This is namely due, in part, by the fact that art is viewed as less needed in the workforce. However many advocates argue that students in the arts excel in interpreting and analyzing visual and spatial information. According to the National Assessment of Educational Progress, "Educators have acknowledged that the arts are basic to the acquisition of a well-rounded education. The arts provide meaning to learning. They serve as a vehicle for acquiring the skills to which educational reformers have said students should aspire: problem-solving, higher order thinking, flexibility, persistence, and cooperation."&lt;ref&gt;“What Does the NEAP Arts Assessment Measure?” National Center for Educational Statistics. 2009. 16 Nov, 2011. &lt;http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/arts/whatmeasure.asp&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; These skills that are acquired by the arts are actually needed characteristics in the modern workforce. The stress of the importance for the arts then becomes one that benefits the students for their future careers. While many view the arts as inapplicable in today’s modern workforce, many would argue that the arts provide positive results for students competing in today’s competitive job market.

===Arts integrated teachers===
An issue commonly brought is that “not all teachers are artists,” meaning that there aren’t enough teachers capable of doing art to teach in every classroom. However, this is not the case, as any teacher can become an arts teacher. While art is, to its core, incredibly subjective, there is a basis for every practice. In the fine arts there are the elements and principles of design, the color wheel, etc. In music there is basic music theory. In drama, there is basic play structure, acting theory, etc. Whether or not a teacher can do these things is irrelevant; if they can be taught, that information can be passed on from the teacher to the student. The goal is not to create master artists, but rather teach basic arts skills, processes, and aesthetic quality, and encourage creative teaching techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oreck |first=Barry |title=Artistic choices: A study of teachers who use the arts in the classroom |url=http://ijea.asu.edu/v7n8/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205121705/http://ijea.asu.edu/v7n8/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=5 February 2007 |publisher=International Journal of Education &amp; the Arts |accessdate=12 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This basic understanding can then be passed on to the students, who then learn by doing. These skills are simple and easy to learn and teach, and will be infinitely useful in creating lesson plans and in practice. Once an arts-integrated environment is established, techniques, examples, and information can be shared amongst colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dittrich |last2=Pool |last3=Pool |first=Charles |first2=Jonelle |first3=Ken|title=Arts Integration in Teacher Preparation: Teaching the Teachers|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ985616.pdf|publisher=ERIC Institute of Education Sciences|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They can discuss findings and share what works and does not work within the classroom.

Funding and advocacy for the arts still remains the largest issue that is currently facing teaching this important area to students. Many districts and supporters speak out for more funding to ensure advancement in the arts, however there is little money to be shared across the many programs in education. Many fear that certain arts programs may be removed from some schools due to these concerns. While art education is considered one of the core subjects in the No Child Left Behind Act, there are many who fear for its future.

==The contribution of arts education to children’s development==
The arts are often perceived as a hobby, an interest or purely as a recreational occupation. In a society where the entire educational system is based on preparing a future work force, focus is put on the STEM field (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) and the arts are neglected. In a time of economic instability resources are strictly distributed and the arts are ever so often first to get cut. Yet, research on the effects of arts education on children’s learning and development show significant positive outcomes on children exposed to arts programs with teacher supervision compared to children not exposed to arts education. Research shows that children exposed to arts do better in school, develop greater social, cognitive and emotional skills and are more likely to earn higher degrees of education later in life.

===Academic effects===
Participation in arts programs is positively correlated with increased academic achievement, including higher math and verbal SAT scores, when compared to the performance of students without arts education.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;President’s Committee on the Arts and Humanities. (2011). Reinvesting in arts education: Winning America’s future through creative schools. http://www.pcah.gov/sites/default/files/PCAH_Reinvesting_4web.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;

Research by the National Educational Longitudinal Survey (NELS;88), a panel study which has followed more than 25,000 students in American secondary schools for 10 years, show significant results on the positive outcomes from children exposed to high arts in school with a teacher supervising. The study examines the time from 8th grade through 10th and 12th grade and throughout high school. Furthermore, this study, conducted by James Catterall and colleagues, which started in the mid-90s followed up on the same students at age 26 in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Catterall, J. S. (2009). Doing Well and Doing Good by Doing Art: The Effects of Education in the Visual and Performing Arts on the Achievements and Values of Young Adults. Los Angeles/London: Imagination Group/I‐Group Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

An exploratory study published by the [[National Art Education Association]] looked at the integration of arts in classroom curriculum and concluded that this integration enhanced academic learning because of the fully immersive engagement of the arts, which allows students to understand different perspectives, safely take risks, express feelings through less restrictive modes, and draw parallels between the arts and traditional core subject areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lynch|first=Patricia|date=2007|title=Making Meaning Many Ways: An Exploratory Look at Integrating the Arts with Classroom Curriculum|jstor=27696226|journal=Art Education|volume=60|issue=4|pages=33–38|doi=10.2307/27696226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Socio-emotional development===
A significant consensus among research on arts education exists and this is that arts reach students who are not otherwise being reached and that the arts reach students in ways that they are otherwise not being reached.&lt;ref&gt;Fiske, E. B. (1999). Champions of Change - The Impact of the Arts on Learning. Washington, D.C.: The Arts Education Partnership &amp; The President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities.&lt;/ref&gt; Students failing is commonly explained by disengaged students and finding that arts provide students a reason and a motivation for being engaged with school and thus preventing students from dropping out of school.&lt;ref&gt;Achbacher, P. &amp;. (1991). The Humanitas Program evaluation, 1990-91. Center for the Study of Evaluation, UCLA Graduate School of Los Angeles, California.&lt;/ref&gt; This motivation found within can be examined through the way that engagement in arts enhances self-awareness, self-confidence, trust and empowerment. Creating art is a personal experience and involves the student’s personal resources implicating a greater involvement and investment in a work without right or wrong answers.  Personal investment nourishes self-directed learning and encourages the learning experience itself rather than learning as a means of test score performance. The confidence, collaboration, and creativity that arts education fosters has a circular, positive effect on academics as well as cultural engagement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Socio-cultural development===
Positive outcomes by means of socio-cultural development, through exposure to minorities and different cultures, is a contribution of arts education aiming at breaking stereotypes and developing teamwork skills, tolerance and appreciation of diversity. One study, collected by the Association for the Advancement of Arts Education (AAAE), on students’ exposure to Native American music using an interdisciplinary approach incorporating the teaching of instrumental music and bringing in guest artists, showed decreased stereotypical attitudes and greater cultural awareness and sensitivity. These changes were measured by the American Indian Belief Inventory was measured on four groups exposed to Native American culture and a fifth group with no cultural exposure. All of the four groups showed improvement while the fifth control group did not.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, K. (1994). North American Indian Music Instruction : Influences upon attitudes, cultural perceptions, and achievement.D.M.A. dissertation. Tempa, Arizona.: Arizona State University.&lt;/ref&gt;

Longitudinal studies have shown that students with arts education are more civically engaged. This socio-cultural effect of arts integration is disproportionately stronger for at-risk students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=S.|first=Catterall, James|date=March 2012|title=The Arts and Achievement in At-Risk Youth: Findings from Four Longitudinal Studies. Research Report #55.|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED530822|journal=National Endowment for the Arts|language=en|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cognitive development===
Research on the contribution of the arts to the cognitive field show a great array of cognitive developments in spatial-temporal abilities, verbal skills, memory and spatial reasoning.
A study by Chan ''et al.'' using sixty female college students in the U.S showed a relationship of the students’ music training before age 12 and their verbal memory. The students with music training showed a significantly better recall than those without formal training. 
A meta-analysis by the American Psychological Association furthermore showed how listening to music can result in progressive relaxation and that listening to classical music one hour a day increases greater brain coherence and more time spent in the alpha state (state of aware relaxation stimulating imagination, intuition and higher awareness).&lt;ref&gt;Malyarenko. (1996). Music Alters Children's Brainwaves, Human Physiology, 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies on premature babies have also found that while receiving special care and being exposed to classical music they physically and mentally developed significantly faster than those babies who weren’t exposed to classical music.  Further studies have also indicated that incorporating Art into academic education for disabled children better supported cognitive development and improved communication skills.&lt;ref&gt;Silver, Rawley A. ''Developing Cognitive and Creative Skills through Art: Programs for children with Communication Disorders or Learning Disabilities''. New York. Ablin Press, 1989. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Integration of arts in classroom curriculum ==
Jessica Davis presents eight different frameworks for considering the role of the arts in education.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davis|first=Jessica Hoffman|date=1999-05-01|title=Nowhere, Somewhere, Everywhere: The Arts in Education|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/10632919909599472|journal=Arts Education Policy Review|volume=100|issue=5|pages=23–28|doi=10.1080/10632919909599472|issn=1063-2913}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gullatt|first=David E.|date=2008|title=Enhancing Student Learning through Arts Integration: Implications for the Profession|jstor=40364094|journal=The High School Journal|volume=91|issue=4|pages=12–25|doi=10.1353/hsj.0.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her categories and methods are as follows:
# ''Arts-Based -'' Art is at the core of learning, providing a lens through which students can understand other subjects. Art serves as the basic threshold for general learning.
# ''Arts-Injected (or Infused) -'' Art is "injected" from the outside as a matter of enrichment (e.g., a period of music, visiting artists, etc.)
# ''Arts-Included'' - Art is offered alongside traditional curriculum, not necessarily for interdisciplinary purposes but rather as its own course of study.
# ''Arts-Expansion'' - Art is an exploratory adventure that takes students outside of school (e.g., field trips to a museum, concert hall, etc.)
# ''Arts-Professional'' - This approach treats art training as a means for a professional career in the arts, and turning students into artists is the primary goal.
# ''Arts-Extras'' - Art is sometimes offered as an additional commitment outside of regular school curriculum (e.g., school newspaper, after-school dance clubs, etc.).
# ''Arts-Education -'' Referred to by some as aesthetic education, this approach uses art as a way of knowing, turning its study more philosophical to interpret and apply to experiences.
# ''Arts-Cultura'' - Art connects individual students' "culture" to collective community "cultures" to more structured racial/national "Cultures" to the ultimate universal "Culture." It is through this interplay that art encourages students to take risks, think critically, and make meaning.
It is often difficult to fully integrate the arts with traditional classroom instruction in a way that allows for the arts-cultura model. This is largely due to the disconnect between art teachers and teachers of other subjects, who are not given the time or ability to coordinate and interweave lesson plans that apply art to core subjects and vice versa.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Arts Technology Integration ===
As technology continually advances, arts integration evolves to match. The challenge in integrating arts in today's technology-first education lies not in implementing production labs on school campuses or accessing the latest computer software, but rather in effectively managing the sheer amount of information that technology makes available. Students must learn to select relevant data, assess these data, and draw critically from them in order to make meaning, answer questions, or form new ones. Technology also presents more channels of expression, whether through digital art or artificial intelligence, which, if supported by arts-technology integration, can cultivate the experimentation and inquiry that arts education champions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mayo|first=Sherry|date=2007|title=Implications for Art Education in the Third Millennium: Art Technology Integration|jstor=27696216|journal=Art Education|volume=60|issue=3|pages=45–51|doi=10.2307/27696216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== UNESCO Arts Integration Program ===
The United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), a special agency of the UN that operates from Paris, France, advocates the need for the integration of arts, culture, and creativity in all educational platforms worldwide. This agenda is in line with the structure of “Quality Education” and “Education for All” to support methodologies for promoting and protecting diversity of cultural manifestation. For example, UNESCO Bangkok took the initiative of upholding research activities related to Arts Education and swap of information along with case studies among educators, artists, and other stakeholders within Asia and the Pacific. The very first international congress on arts education was held in Seoul (Korea) in 2006 and the second in 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bangkok.unesco.org/content/releasing-power-arts-%E2%80%93-exploring-arts-education-asia-pacific|title=Releasing the Power of the Arts – Exploring Arts Education in the Asia-Pacific|work=UNESCO Bangkok|access-date=2018-05-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Conclusion==
Due to current economic recession many schools across see their arts programs cut off in favor of core curriculum subject such as English, math and science. Despite the lack of apparent and secure job possibilities within the arts and a pressuring need for a strong work force within the [[STEM fields]] (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) research show that arts education is crucial in children’s learning process and development. In 2013 a congressional resolution sought to include "A" for Art in the STEM acronym, changing it to STEAM.&lt;ref name="113HR51"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-113hres51ih/pdf/BILLS-113hres51ih.pdf |title=H.

Some of the measured improvement are greater self-confidence, communicative skills, cultural awareness and sensitivity alongside greater stimulated creativity and overall academic achievement.

In [[biology]], '''axenic''' describes the state of a [[Microbiological culture|culture]] in which only a single species, variety, or strain of [[organism]] is present and entirely free of all other [[contaminating]] organisms. The earliest axenic cultures were  of  [[bacteria]] or unicellular [[eukaryote]]s, but axenic cultures of many multicellular organisms are also possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

  | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; Axenic culture is an important tool for the study of [[symbiotic]] and [[parasitic]] organisms in a controlled environment.

==Preparation==
Axenic cultures of [[microorganism]]s are typically prepared by [[Subculture (biology)|subculture]] of an existing mixed culture. This may involve use of a [[serial dilution|dilution series]], in which a culture is successively diluted to the point where subsamples of it contain only a few individual organisms, ideally only a single individual (in the case of an [[asexual reproduction|asexual]] [[species]]). These subcultures are allowed to grow until the identity of their constituent organisms can be ascertained. Selection of those cultures consisting solely of the desired organism produces the axenic culture. Subculture selection may also involve manually sampling the target organism from an uncontaminated growth front in an otherwise mixed culture, and using this as an [[wikt:inoculum|inoculum]] source for the subculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1058062/pdf/applmicro00351-0052.pdf |title=Preparation of Axenic Cultures of Algae by Use of a French Press |author1=J.B. Middlebrook |author2=R.O. Bowman |date=9 September 1963 |journal=Journal of Applied Microbiology |volume=12 |issue=1 |pmc=1058062 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161203044611/http://aem.asm.org/content/12/1/44.full.pdf%2Bhtml |archivedate=3 December 2016 |deadurl=no |accessdate=3 December 2016 |pmid=14106939 |pages=44–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Axenic cultures are usually checked routinely to ensure that they remain axenic.  One standard approach with microorganisms is to spread a sample of the culture onto an [[agar plate]], and to [[Incubator (microbiology)|incubate]] this for a fixed period of time.  The agar should be an enriched medium that will support the growth of common "contaminating" organisms.  Such "contaminating" organisms will grow on the plate during this period, identifying cultures that are no longer axenic.

==Experimental use==
As axenic cultures are derived from very few organisms, or even a single individual, they are useful because the organisms present within them share a relatively narrow [[gene pool]]. In the case of an asexual species derived from a single individual, the resulting culture should consist of  [[Cloning|identical]] organisms (though processes such as [[mutation]] and [[horizontal gene transfer]] may introduce a degree of variability).  Consequently, they will generally respond in a more uniform and [[Reproducibility|reproducible]] fashion, simplifying the interpretation of [[experiment]]s.

===Problems===
The axenic culture of some pathogens is complicated because they normally thrive within host tissues which exhibit properties that are difficult to replicate ''in vitro''.  This is especially true in the case of [[intracellular parasite|intracellular pathogens]].  However, careful replication of key features of the host environment can resolve these difficulties (e.g. host [[metabolite]]s, [[oxygen saturation|dissolved oxygen]]), such as with the [[Q fever]] pathogen, ''[[Coxiella burnetii]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Omsland | first=Anders | year=2009 | title=Host cell-free growth of the Q fever bacterium ''Coxiella burnetii'' | journal=[[PNAS]] | volume=106 | pages=4430–4434 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0812074106 | pmid=19246385 | issue=11 | pmc=2657411 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7065">'''Business Process Validation''' (BPV) is the act of verifying that a set of end-to-end business processes function as intended. If there are problems in one or more business applications that support a business process, or in the integration or configuration of those systems, then the consequences of disruption to the business can be serious. A company might be unable to take orders or ship product – which can directly impact company revenue, reputation, and customer satisfaction.  It can also drive additional expenses, as defects in production are much more expensive to fix than if identified earlier. For this reason, a key aim of Business Process Validation is to identify defects early, before new enterprise software&lt;ref&gt;[[Enterprise software]]&lt;/ref&gt; is deployed in production so that there is no business impact and the cost of repairing defects is kept to a minimum.

Note: BPV is unrelated to [[Validation (drug manufacture)]] by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]].

During Business Process Validation (BPV), the business process is checked step-by-step using representative data to confirm that all business rules are working correctly and that all underlying transactions are performing properly across every enterprise application&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is enterprise application?|url=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/E/enterprise_application.html|publisher=Quinstreet Enterprise|accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; used in the business process.  When defects are identified, these problems are logged for repair by IT personnel, business analysts or the software vendor, as appropriate.

Business Process Validation can be performed on various timescales, including the following:
* ''Project basis'', when new enterprise software systems (such as [[SAP HANA]]®, mobile, cloud, or web applications) are being deployed for the first time
* ''Periodic basis'', when there are regular monthly, quarterly, or annual updates to enterprise software, such as [[SAP AG|SAP]]®
* ''Continuous basis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lights-out Testing for End-to-end Business Process Validation.|url=http://www.worksoft.com/files/resources/Worksoft-Paper-Lights-Out-Testing-For-Business-Process-Validation.pdf|publisher=Worksoft|accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;'', when companies want to validate the readiness of their processes and enterprise systems 24/7/365

== Business Process Validation Methods ==

=== Manual ===
Manual Business Process Validation is where one or more people (typically a cross-functional team) work at keyboards or mobile devices to execute the various business process steps directly in the enterprise software by hand. Defects are manually noted and typically logged in a defect tracking system.

There are several shortcomings to the manual approach. First, since all data is entered by hand, it can be time consuming for subject matter experts and business analysts. These are expensive staff resources that could be deployed on other higher value activities.  Second, manual testing extends project timelines.  This slows the deployment of innovation and makes business users wait longer for cost saving and revenue generating new technology. Third, the manual process is often incomplete, since the time-intensive nature means that IT teams cannot test all business processes,{{cn|date=January 2015}} given their resource constraints.  This lack of coverage introduces technology risk in a company’s business processes.  Finally, if business process validation is done manually by IT teams, then business requirements and processes have to be unambiguously documented in advance, which is a time-consuming task.

=== Automated ===
Automated Business Process Validation relies on software to execute the various business process steps directly in the enterprise software systems in an automated fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hayes|first=Linda|title=The Automated Testing Handbook|url=http://www.softwaretestpro.com/itemassets/4772/automatedtestinghandbook.pdf|publisher=Software Testing Institute|accessdate=9 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907235351/http://www.softwaretestpro.com/ItemAssets/4772/AutomatedTestingHandbook.pdf#|archive-date=2012-09-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  BPV software automatically uses standard business process data during the validation, and interprets the correctness of each transaction and result. Defects are automatically noted and logged.

With [[Worksoft|BPV software]], the business process must first be "captured" in the BPV software system so that it can be automatically executed. This amounts to performing the business process once in the enterprise system with the BPV software running in the background to capture the process. Once the business process is captured, BPV software allows the business process automation to be modified with very little effort.  Some BPV software have object-oriented designs that allow sub-processes to be shared among different end-to-end business processes, and business process automation can be easily copied and modified. This last feature is particularly helpful when companies have variations of business processes across geographies or business units.  For example, an order shipment process in Europe may differ slightly from the same process in North America because there are differences in compliance requirements and Bills of Lading.  There is no need to capture the second process end-to-end&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=End to End Business Scenarios|url=http://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/display/BPX/End+to+End+Business+Scenarios|publisher=SAP|accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; for automation purposes. The first process can easily be copied and modified in the BPV software. This enables companies to efficiently and quickly build their portfolio of business processes for automated validation.

An ancillary benefit is that once the business process is correctly captured, BPV software allows a complete and accurate description of the business process to be printed. This documentation is generated automatically with no additional effort and is useful for training, regulatory compliance, and other purposes. It is available on-demand and is typically very accurate because it is based on the most recent versions of systems and business practices. 
BPV software largely avoids the shortcomings of manual business process validation. The automation software can be configured to validate business processes on a 24/7/365 basis, if desired by the user. The frequency of automation enables any defects in underlying business systems and interfaces to be detected and repaired quickly, before business users are impacted.

Automated business process validation is a way to ensure that a company’s business processes continue to work, even when mission critical enterprise systems change.

'''Chaîne opératoire''' ([[French language|French]] for “operational chain” or “operational sequence”) is a term used throughout anthropological discourse, but is most commonly used in [[archaeology]] and [[sociocultural anthropology]]. It functions as a methodological tool for analysing the technical processes and [[Social actions|social acts]] involved in the step-by-step [[Handicraft|production]], use, and eventual disposal of [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], such as [[lithic reduction]] (the making of [[stone tool]]s) or [[pottery]].&lt;ref name=oxford_def&gt;{{cite web |title=Chaîne opératoire, definition from Answers.com |author=Timothy Darvill |date=2002|accessdate=2011-10-22 |work=Concise Oxford Dictionary of Archaeology |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] and [[Answers.com]] |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/cha-ne-op-ratoire}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The 'chaîne opératoire' approach to lithic analysis |author=Roger Grace |year=1997 |accessdate=2011-10-22 |work=Stone Age Reference Collection |publisher=Institute of Archaeology, [[University of Oslo]], [[Norway]] |url=http://www3.hf.uio.no/sarc/iakh/lithic/opchainpaper.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111225054001/http://www3.hf.uio.no/sarc/iakh/lithic/opchainpaper.html |archivedate=2011-12-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gosselain1&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gosselain |first1=Oliver |year=1992 |title=Technology and Style: Potters and Pottery Among Bafia of Cameroon |journal=Man |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=559–586 |jstor=2803929 |doi=10.2307/2803929}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept of technology as the science of human activities was first proposed by [[French people|French]] [[archaeologist]], [[André Leroi-Gourhan]], and later by the [[History of science|historian of science]], André-Georges Haudricourt.&lt;ref name=oxford_def/&gt;&lt;ref name=Soressi_and_Geneste_336&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Soressi |first1=Marie |last2=Geneste |first2=Jean-Michel |year=2011 |title=Special Issue: Reduction Sequence, ''Chaîne Opératoire'', and Other Methods: The Epistemologies of Different Approaches to Lithic Analysis; The History and Efficacy of the ''Chaîne Opératoire'' Approach to Lithic Analysis: Studying Techniques to Reveal Past Societies in an Evolutionary Perspective |journal=PaleoAnthropology |page=336 |doi=10.4207/PA.2011.ART63 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=March 8, 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Both were students of [[Marcel Mauss]] who had earlier recognised that societies could be understood through its techniques by virtue of the fact that operational sequences are steps organised according to an internal logic specific to a society.&lt;ref name=Soressi_and_Geneste_336/&gt;&lt;ref name=Coupaye_440&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Coupaye |first1=Ludovic |year=2009 |title=Ways of Enchanting: Chaînes Opératoires and Yam Cultivation in Nyamikum Village, Maprik, Papua New Guinea |journal=Journal of Material Culture |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=440 |doi=10.1177/1359183509345945}}&lt;!--|accessdate=January 28, 2013 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The chaîne opératoire was born out of the need to explicitly describe the methodology of [[lithic analysis]] in archaeological scholarship. It allows archaeologists to reconstruct the techniques used and the chronological ordering of the different steps required to produce an artifact.&lt;ref name=Soressi_and_Geneste_336/&gt; By understanding the processes and construction of tools, archaeologists can better determine the evolution of tool technology and the development of ancient cultures and lifestyles.&lt;ref&gt;Forestier H, Zeitoun V, Winayalai C and Métais C 2013. The open-air site of Huai Hin (Northwestern Thailand): Chronological perspectives for the Hoabinhian. Comptes Rendus Palevol 12(1)&lt;/ref&gt;
Artifact analysis has undergone several changes throughout its history, shifting from an orientation as a natural science of [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] humans to a social and cultural anthropology of the production techniques of prehistoric societies.&lt;ref name=Soressi_and_Geneste_336/&gt; From this perspective, a chaîne opératoire can be understood as a [[Social artifact|social product]], as it calls for an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] approach to artifact analysis (the integration of associated disciplines: [[archaeology]], [[sociocultural anthropology]], [[biological anthropology]], and [[anthropological linguistics]]), which offers a multidimensional view of a society, and demonstrates how chaînes opératoires cannot operate independently of the society that produces it.&lt;ref name=Gosselain1/&gt; Consequently, the study of the technique - or chaîne opératoire - enables one to better understand not only the society in which the technique originated, but also the social context, actions, and [[cognition]] that accompanied the production of an object.&lt;ref name=Soressi_and_Geneste_336/&gt; 

==Criticism of chaîne opératoire==

Critics of chaîne opératoire argue that it is subjective because it is based upon the analyst's personal experience and intuition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Monnier|first1=Gilliane F.|last2=Missal|first2=Kele|title=Another Mousterian Debate? Bordian facies, chaîne opératoire technocomplexes, and patterns of lithic variability in the western European Middle and Upper Pleistocene|journal=Quaternary International|date=November 2014|volume=350|pages=59–83|doi=10.1016/j.quaint.2014.06.053}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They further claim that it is not a replicable or quantifiable approach to data collection. A second objection is that chaîne opératoire claims to be able to identify the intentions and goals of prehistoric knappers, including the "desired endproducts" of knapping sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bar‐Yosef|first1=Ofer|last2=Van Peer|first2=Philip|title=The Chaîne Opératoire Approach in Middle Paleolithic Archaeology|journal=Current Anthropology|date=February 2009|volume=50|issue=1|pages=103–131|doi=10.1086/592234|url=https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/2960197/Bar-Yosef_ChaineOperatoireApproach.pdf?sequence=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, what archaeologists select from an assemblage as 'end products' may not match what people in the past thought worthwhile to select for transport and subsequent use elsewhere in the landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Turq|first1=Alain|last2=Roebroeks|first2=Wil|last3=Bourguignon|first3=Laurence|last4=Faivre|first4=Jean-Philippe|title=The fragmented character of Middle Palaeolithic stone tool technology|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|date=November 2013|volume=65|issue=5|pages=641–655|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2013.07.014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third major problem with the chaîne opératoire approach is that there is severe inconsistency in the application of definitions by lithic analysts. For example, since the publication of Boëda's definition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boëda|first1=Eric|title=Le débitage Discoïde et le débitage Levallois récurrent centripète|journal=Bulletin de la Société Préhistorique Française,|date=1993|volume=90|page=392–404}}&lt;/ref&gt; of six nondisassociable criteria for Discoidal debitage,  numerous variants have been proposed, and many authors have argued for the presence of Levallois concept even when those six criteria were not met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Draily|first1=C.|title=La Grotte Walou à Trooz (Belgique): Fouilles de 1996 à 2004 L'Archéologie.

'''Choosing Wisely Canada''' ('''CWC''') is a Canadian-based health education campaign launched on April 2, 2014 under the leadership of Dr. [[Wendy Levinson]], in partnership with the [[Canadian Medical Association]], and  based at the [[University of Toronto]].&lt;ref name="Lev CMAJ"&gt;Levinson W, Huynh T. Engaging physicians and patients in conversations about unnecessary tests and procedures: Choosing Wisely Canada. CMAJ. 2014 Mar 18;186(5):325-6.&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign aims to help physicians and patients engage in conversations about [[Unnecessary health care|unnecessary tests, treatments and procedures]], and to assist physicians and patients in making informed and effective choices to ensure high quality care.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Medical Association [website]. Choosing Wisely Canada.Ottawa, ON: Canadian Medical Association; 2014. Available from:www.cma.ca/En/Pages/choosing-wisely-canada.aspx.&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign is based on the notion that unnecessary tests, treatments, and procedures often do more harm than good, resulting in poor clinical outcomes and significant waste in the [[Canadian healthcare system]].&lt;ref&gt;Horwitz LI, Masica AL, Auerbach AD. Introducing Choosing Wisely®: Next steps in improving healthcare value. J Hosp Med. 2015 Mar;10(3):187-9&lt;/ref&gt; These unnecessary tests and procedures take away from care by potentially exposing patients to harm, leading to more testing to investigate [[False positives and false negatives|false positive tests]], and contributing to unnecessary anxiety and avoidable costs for patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =ANDRÉ PICARD: When health care becomes unnecessary care |url= https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/when-health-care-becomes-unnecessary-care/article25486001/}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Choosing Wisely Canada'' aims to encourage and empower physicians to assimilate, evaluate, and implement the ever-increasing amount of evidence on current best practice. The campaign also supports the equally important role of patient education and the need to dispel the false notion that “more care is better care”.&lt;ref name= "Lev CMAJ" /&gt;

Central to the campaign are lists of "Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question" developed by more than forty-five Canadian specialty societies. These lists are intended to encourage physicians to adopt a "think twice" attitude to avoid unnecessary and potentially harmful tests and procedures, and to foster discussions between patients and physicians about inappropriate care. The campaign also uses patient-friendly education materials to complement these lists, as well as teaches medical trainees about resource stewardship. As of June 2, 2015, 151 physician recommendations and 26 lay language patient educational materials have been released .

''Choosing Wisely Canada'' leads an international community, made up of nations who are implementing similar programs in their respective countries. At present, this community includes representation from [[Australia]], [[Austria]], [[Brazil]], [[Denmark]], [[England]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[India]], [[Israel]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Korea]], [[Switzerland]], [[United States]] and [[Wales]].

Choosing Wisely Canada stems from worldwide concern around providing unnecessary treatment when the risk of harm exceeds its potential benefit ("medical overuse").&lt;ref&gt;Morgan DJ, Wright SM, Dhruva S. Update on medical overuse.

==History==
[[File:Dr. Wendy Levinson, MD, OC..jpg|thumb|Dr. Wendy Levinson (MD, OC) Chair of Choosing Wisely Canada]]

Choosing Wisely Canada is modeled after the [[Choosing Wisely]] campaign launched by the [[ABIM Foundation]] of the [[American Board of Internal Medicine]] in the United States in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey EJ. Choosing wisely (and carefully) Canada. Can J Surg. 2014 Jun;57(3):149, 151.&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. [[Wendy Levinson]], a Canadian physician and previous chair of the ABIM Board of Directors, was involved in launching the Choosing Wisely campaign in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, C. D., &amp; Levinson, W. S. (2015). A Commitment to High-Value Care Education From the Internal Medicine Community. Annals of Internal Medicine,162(9), 639-640&lt;/ref&gt; After its successful launch, she decided to bring the movement to Canada and partnered with the [[Canadian Medical Association]] and the [[University of Toronto]] to launch Choosing Wisely Canada on April 2, 2014.&lt;ref name="Lev CMAJ"/&gt; In the first wave of the campaign, nine national medical specialty societies released [[evidence-based]] lists of 41 tests, treatments and procedures that provided no benefit or potentially caused harm to patients.&lt;ref name= "Lev CMAJ" /&gt;

Under the leadership of Dr. Wendy Levinson and the Canadian Medical Association, Choosing Wisely Canada initially gained momentum in [[Ontario]] and subsequently became a national movement.&lt;ref&gt;Gupta S, Detsky AS. Development of Choosing Wisely Recommendations for an Inpatient Internal Medicine Service. JAMA Intern Med. 2015 Feb 23.&lt;/ref&gt; The second and third waves of physician recommendation lists and patient education materials were launched on October 29, 2014, and June 2, 2015, respectively.&lt;ref name="Vogel"&gt;Vogel, L. More Hospitals Choose Wisely.CMAJ June 8, 2015 cmaj.109-5078&lt;/ref&gt; 
As of June 2, 2015, more than 45 Canadian medical specialty societies are engaged and at various stages of recommendations development .  In total, 151 physician recommendations and 26 lay language patient educational materials have been released in the three waves from 2014-2015.&lt;ref name="Vogel" /&gt;

==Campaign==

''Choosing Wisely Canada'' has adopted a multi-faceted campaign approach, engaging physicians, patients, and medical trainees at all levels. The campaign has partnered with more than 45 Canadian medical specialty societies to develop evidence-supported lists of “Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question”, hoping to promote conversation about inappropriate care.&lt;ref name= "Lev CMAJ" /&gt; The underlying premise is that physicians must lead such conversations, since they determine the appropriate or inappropriate use of resources.&lt;ref name= "Vogel" /&gt; CWC has also developed complementary patient-friendly education materials, and has begun to embed lessons focusing on resource stewardship in undergraduate and postgraduate medical curricula.&lt;ref name= "Vogel"/&gt; In order to unify grassroots projects occurring across Canada to implement physician recommendations, CWC additionally developed the Early Adopters Collaborative, which serves as a “learning platform for sharing knowledge, tools and experiences among participating organizations”.&lt;ref name ="ICU"&gt;Holton, E. Choosing Wisely: Tackling Unnecessary X-rays in the ICUS. St. Michael's Hospital Newsroom. Available at: http://www.stmichaelshospital.com/media/detail.php?source=hospital_news/2015/20150624_hn&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Physician Recommendations Lists ===

[[File:CWC List Development Process.JPG|thumb|CWC List Development Process]]

At the core of the campaign are lists of "Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question" developed by national specialty societies representing a broad spectrum of physicians. These lists contain tests, treatments or procedures commonly used in their specialty, but which are not supported by evidence, and/or could expose patients to unnecessary harm.&lt;ref&gt;Hurley, R. (2014). Can doctors reduce harmful medical overuse worldwide?. BMJ, 349, g4289.&lt;/ref&gt;

List items recommend practices to be avoided and typically begin with the word “Don’t” or “Avoid”; for example, one of the recommendations released in the first wave of the campaign was ''Don’t order screening chest X-rays and ECGs for asymptomatic or low risk outpatients''.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Association of Radiologists. Medical imaging primer with a focus on x-ray usage and safety [Internet]. [Cited 2014 Feb 15]. Available from: http://www.car.ca/uploads/standards%20guidelines/20130128_en_guide_radiation_primer.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; National specialty societies are free to determine the process for generating their lists, as long as they are done in accordance with the following principles:&lt;ref name= "Lev CMAJ" /&gt;

# The development process is thoroughly documented and publicly available
# Each recommendation is within the specialty’s scope of practice (and not pertaining to other specialties such as family medicine) 
# Tests, treatments or procedures included are those that (a) are frequently used, and, (b) may expose patients to harm or stress.
# Each recommendation is supported by evidence

Choosing Wisely Canada recommendations are not intended to be used to establish payment and coverage decisions. Rather, the lists are meant to spur conversation about what is appropriate and necessary treatment. As each patient situation is unique, Choosing Wisely Canada recommends that its materials be used as guidelines for physicians and patients to determine an appropriate treatment plan together.&lt;ref&gt;Baron RJ, Wolfson D. Advancing medical professionalism and the choosing wisely campaign. JAMA Intern Med. 2015 Mar 1;175(3):464-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patient education===

In order to encourage patients to initiate conversations about unnecessary care, Choosing Wisely Canada uses patient-friendly materials with lay language to complement the lists of “Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question”. These patient educational materials are meant to inform patients about the tests, treatments and procedures used within various medical specialties, when they may or may not be necessary, and what patients can do to improve their overall health.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfson D, Santa J, Slass L. Engaging physicians and consumers in conversations about treatment overuse and waste: a short history of the choosing wisely campaign. Acad Med. 2014 Jul;89(7):990-5.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one of the patient educational materials released on June 2, 2015, addressed concerns regarding the amount of bed rest required to treat lower back pain, advising that staying in bed longer than 48 hours will not help, and in fact, may actually delay recovery.&lt;ref&gt;Recommendations target overuse of unnecessary medical procedures. BCMJ, Vol. 57, No. 6, July, August 2015, page(s) 237–238.&lt;/ref&gt;

An editorial was written by Dr. Wendy Levinson in ''[[The Toronto Star]]'' as a part of the weekly feature titled "Doctor's Notes".  The article highlighted the Choosing Wisely campaign and encouraged patients to engage in conversations with their physicians about unnecessary care.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thestar.com/life/2015/08/10/why-that-medical-test-might-not-be-necessary.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other campaign avenues===

Healthcare stakeholder groups have begun to mobilize around the CWC campaign at provincial and local levels. In Alberta, Ontario, Quebec and Atlantic Canada, multi-stakeholder tables have been established to organize, coordinate and focus provincial implementation efforts.&lt;ref name ="Vogel" /&gt; At the local level, hospitals, health regions and physician groups across the country are working under their own initiative to find innovative ways to put the recommendations into practice.&lt;ref name= "ICU" /&gt; Such local implementation efforts are beginning to emerge across Canada, with activities ranging from physician and patient education, to modifying clinical processes and information systems, to providing data back to providers about their practice patterns.&lt;ref name="WCH"/&gt;

Another major aspect of the campaign is engaging medical trainees at all levels. The Draft 2015 CanMEDS Framework identifies leadership as one of seven essential physician competencies, urging medical professionals to “engage in the stewardship of health care resources”, particularly to “allocate health care resources for optimal patient care” and “to apply evidence and management processes to achieve cost-appropriate care”.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, J. R., Snell, L., &amp; Sherbino, J. (2014). The Draft CanMEDS 2015: Physician Competency Framework. Ottawa: Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada&lt;/ref&gt; In order to embody these ideals, CWC is working with Canadian medical schools to introduce new content focussing on resource stewardship into the undergraduate, postgraduate and continuing medical education curricula.&lt;ref name= "Vogel" /&gt;

On the media front, the campaign includes partnerships with patient organizations and media outlets to develop and disseminate complementary content to increase patient awareness, and to support them in conversations surrounding inappropriate care. CWC has also developed a bilingual mobile app available on both Android and Apple platforms, which contains all physician recommendations and patient educational materials organized categorically.&lt;ref&gt;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.choosingwiselycanada.CWC&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/choosing-wisely-canada/id933897108?mt=8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

Choosing Wisely Canada recommendations range from avoiding overuse of broad practices such as unnecessary and potentially harmful screening, diagnostic and radiographic services, to specific tests which are not supported by evidence to improve patient outcomes.

Examples of recommendations which advise against overuse of broad practices include:

* Don’t perform routine [[cancer screening]], or surveillance for a new primary cancer, in the majority of patients with [[metastatic disease]].&lt;ref&gt;Mitera, G., Earle, C., Latosinsky, S., Booth, C., Bezjak, A., Desbiens, C., ... &amp; Porter, G. (2015). Choosing Wisely Canada Cancer List: Ten Low-Value or Harmful Practices That Should Be Avoided In Cancer Care. Journal of Oncology Practice, 11(3), e296-e303.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Don’t perform annual [[Cardiac imaging|stress cardiac imaging]] or advanced non-invasive imaging as part of routine follow-up in asymptomatic patients.&lt;ref&gt;Natarajan MK, Paul N, Mercuri M, Waller EJ, Leipsic J, Traboulsi M, et al. Canadian Cardiovascular Society position statement on radiation exposure from cardiac imaging and interventional procedures. Can J Cardiol. 2013 Nov;29(11):1361-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of specific low-value tests to avoid in certain circumstances include:

*Don’t order [[testosterone (hormone)|serum testosterone]] in men without symptoms of [[hypogonadism]].&lt;ref&gt;The Endocrine Society. Testosterone Therapy in Adult Men with Androgen Deficiency Syndromes: An Endocrinology Society Clinical Practice Guideline [Internet]. 2010 [cited 2015 Jun 18]. Available from: http://www.endocrine.org/~/media/endosociety/Files/Publications/Clinical%20Practice%20Guidelines/FINAL-Androgens-in-Men-Standalone.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
*Don’t order [[thrombophilia]] testing in women with early pregnancy loss.&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, L. K., Bering, H., Carson, K. R., Haynes, A. E., Kleinerman, J., Kukreti, V., ... &amp; Wood, W. A. (2014). Five hematologic tests and treatments to question. ASH Education Program Book, 2014(1), 599-603&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==

Campaign leaders have identified a number of challenges which could potentially undermine the efforts of Choosing Wisely Canada. Since reducing unnecessary tests and procedures may result in lowering healthcare costs, the campaign may be viewed as a [[Health care rationing|cost-cutting or rationing measure]], which could in turn "undermine both physician engagement and patient trust."&lt;ref name ="International"&gt;Levinson W, Kallewaard M, Bhatia RS, Wolfson D, Shortt S, Kerr EA; Choosing Wisely International Working Group. 'Choosing Wisely': a growing international campaign. BMJ Qual Saf. 2015 Feb;24(2):167-74&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the campaign is centered around patient safety with particular emphasis on quality of care. Furthermore, Choosing Wisely Canada recommendations do not determine payment for individual services.&lt;ref name ="International" /&gt;

Some physicians report feeling pressure to engage in defensive medicine (e.g., ordering more tests than necessary) because they feel that it will help them avoid litigation.&lt;ref&gt;Volpp, K. G., Loewenstein, G., &amp; Asch, D. A. (2012). Choosing wisely: low-value services, utilization, and patient cost sharing. Jama, 308(16), 1635-1636.&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian healthcare system is also set up so that specialty physicians get paid for tests and procedures conducted, and not for practicing conservative medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Allin, S., &amp; Rudoler, D. (2015). The Canadian Health Care System, 2014.International Profiles of Health Care Systems, 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a system may create a pattern for physicians to recommend more treatment. This pattern may also contribute to unwilling of physicians to put recommendations on their lists pertaining specifically to their specialty, instead focusing their recommendations on overuse by other specialties.&lt;ref name ="International" /&gt;

Evaluation of the campaign has also been identified as a major challenge. Campaign leaders concede that measuring the impact of Choosing Wisely is complex and may require multiple approaches, including physician and patient awareness of the campaign, documented curriculum inclusion in medical curricula, and demonstrated reduction in unnecessary testing following campaign efforts.&lt;ref name ="Bhatia"&gt;Bhatia, R. S., Levinson, W., &amp; Lee, D. S. (2014). Low value cardiac testing and Choosing Wisely. BMJ quality &amp; safety, bmjqs-2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Measuring progress of reduction in inappropriate care is particularly complex, since “the definition of appropriateness often includes knowing about symptoms and physical exam findings often not included in electronic health records and administrative databases”.&lt;ref name ="Bhatia" /&gt;  Recognizing the complexity of evaluation efforts, Choosing Wisely Canada along with other international Choosing Wisely movements is working with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development to develop metrics that might be used to compare countries on specific measures of overuse, as well to develop cross-country metrics.&lt;ref name = "International" /&gt;

Since patient education is a core facet of the campaign, communication with patients presents another challenge. Some campaign recommendations may require clinical education for complete comprehension.&lt;ref name = "Brody"&gt;Brody H. Talking with patients about cost containment. J Gen Intern Med. 2014 Jan;29(1):5-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, many patients tend to follow physician recommendations without question, even if they have questions. As such, a major portion of the campaign focuses on encouraging patients to initiate conversations about unnecessary care.&lt;ref name ="Brody" /&gt;  Additionally, Choosing Wisely Canada has developed patient-friendly materials with straightforward, lay language to explain common tests, with a “When you need them and when you don’t” approach. These materials complement the lists of “Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question” developed by specialty societies.&lt;ref name ="Vogel" /&gt;

The response to Choosing Wisely Canada has been positive, with physicians across the country expressing support for the campaign and highlighting the need for more resource stewardship.&lt;ref name="Glauser"/&gt; Dr. [[Danielle Martin]], family physician and Vice-President Medical Affairs and Health Systems Solutions at [[Women's College Hospital]], lists Choosing Wisely Canada as one of three major ideas to improve Canadian healthcare, highlighting that “Choosing Wisely Canada is not a rationing or cost-cutting exercising. It is about reorganizing healthcare services so we only do things for people that truly benefit their health."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Danielle Martin's Three Big Ideas to Improve Healthcare |url=http://www.vancouversun.com/news/simon-fraser-university/Danielle+Martin+three+ideas+transform+health+care/10417270/story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. [[Chris Simpson (surgeon)|Chris Simpson]], past president of the Canadian Medical Association, Professor of Medicine and Chief of Cardiology at [[Queen's University]], [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]], notes "Physicians are really embracing the principles behind Choosing Wisely. It’s all about the right thing to do for patients and avoiding the harm that can come from unnecessary testing. Let’s do more of what works and…and less of what is done ‘just in case’. Society expects us to lead the way, and the physicians of Canada intend to do just that”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Choosing Wisely to Avoid Harm |url=http://deptmed.queensu.ca/blog/?p=531}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. [[Rick Glazier]], senior scientist in primary care and population health at the [[Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences]] in [[Toronto]], highlights two aspects of the campaign that he believes are unique and have great potential. “The first”, he states, “is that it’s targeted to the public, and the second is that it’s driven not only by scientists and medical journals, but by the professional organizations themselves. For radiologists to come forward and say you shouldn’t order radiology tests under these circumstances, this is unprecedented”.&lt;ref name= "Glauser"&gt;Glauser W. Choosing Wisely campaign well received. CMAJ. 2014 May 13;186(8):E239-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

The final report of the [http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/innovation/index-eng.php Advisory Panel on Healthcare Innovation] to [[Rona Ambrose]], [[Minister of Health (Canada)]], saluted Choosing Wisely Canada “as an innovative physician-led and patient-centered approach that has the potential to shift healthcare away from a culture of consumption to a focus on appropriateness and quality of care”. Furthermore, the panel urged “governments to support the implementation of [Choosing Wisely Canada] in all jurisdictions and to carefully evaluate its impact”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Report of the Advisory Panel on Healthcare Innovation: "Unleashing Innovation: Excellent Healthcare for Canada" |url= http://www.healthycanadians.gc.ca/publications/health-system-systeme-sante/report-healthcare-innovation-rapport-soins/alt/report-healthcare-innovation-rapport-soins-eng.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to endorsements from eminent physician leaders and professional organizations, Choosing Wisely Canada received positive media coverage in national media sources, including ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Medical Associations to Urge Canada's Doctors to Limit Unnecessary Tests |url= https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health-and-fitness/health/medical-associations-to-urge-canadas-doctors-to-limit-unnecessary-tests/article16953492/}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Unnecessary Medical Tests Need a Rethink |url= http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/unnecessary-medical-tests-need-a-rethink-1.2541790}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Toronto Star]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Doctors Weigh in on 2013's Biggest Medical Breakthroughs |url= https://www.thestar.com/life/health_wellness/2013/12/27/doctors_weigh_in_on_2013s_biggest_medical_breakthroughs.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; which heralded ''Choosing Wisely Canada'' as one of the top medical breakthroughs of the year. .

On the other hand, early criticism of Choosing Wisely in the United States highlighted that some specialty recommendations addressed overuse of resources by primary care specialties, instead of addressing unnecessary tests and procedures conducted by their own specialty colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;Morden, N. E., Colla, C. H., Sequist, T. D., &amp; Rosenthal, M. B. (2014). Choosing wisely—the politics and economics of labeling low-value services.New England Journal of Medicine, 370(7), 589-592&lt;/ref&gt; Choosing Wisely Canada responded to such criticisms by setting guidelines for its list development, which required recommendations put forward by specialty societies to pertain specifically to the specialty’s scope of practice.&lt;ref name= "Bhatia" /&gt;

Many physician bloggers assert that most medical overuse is a result of practicing defensive medicine in an effort to avoid lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Why 'Choosing Wisely' Won't Protect You in a Lawsuit |url= http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/837399}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others recognize the noble goal of reducing overuse and harm, but lament that the lists are too simplistic and do not necessarily advance the identification of low-value care, but merely synthesize “agreed-upon, well-established practices”.&lt;ref&gt;Siemens DR, Finelli A. Choosing Wisely Canada: It's our turn. Can Urol Assoc J. 2014 Jul;8(7-8):E580-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

A critique of the Choosing Wisely campaign published in the [[Journal of the American Medical Association]] by Clement and Charlton highlights a number of shortcomings in the overall movement. While the critique commends the campaign for succeeding in its goal of promoting conversations about low-value care, the authors of the critique believed that the process of list development were based on “quasi-systematic methods that focus on physician participation to increase support”.&lt;ref name ="Clement"&gt;Clement, F., &amp; Charlton, B. (2015). Challenges in Choosing Wisely’s international future: support, evidence, and burnout. JAMA Internal Medicine,175(4), 644-645&lt;/ref&gt; The critique additionally called for increased evidence of the efficacy of the “Top Five” lists in terms of reduction in wasteful practices. Clement and Charlton furthermore warn of “Top Five List Burnout”, noting that when faced with multiple guidelines on a single topic, physicians become confused regarding which protocol to follow.&lt;ref name= "Clement"/&gt; In spite of these criticisms, Clement and Charlton “strongly believe in the global spirit behind the Choosing Wisely campaigns and movement” and “advocate that the priority in 2015 should be thoughtful implementation and rigorous evaluation of existing top five lists” &lt;ref name="Clement" /&gt;

==Impact==

Choosing Wisely Canada has identified a multifaceted evaluation approach to measure its impact, which includes:&lt;ref name= "Bhatia" /&gt;

*Physician attitudes and self-reported experience (through physician surveys)
*Patient receptiveness to campaign messages
*Reduction in ordering of low-value tests and procedures
*Implementation in medical education

Evaluation of campaign impact on patient education and receptiveness included a [[randomized control trial]] entitled EMPOWER (Eliminating Medications Through Patient Ownership of End Results), led by Dr. Cara Tannenbaum, geriatrician and Professor in the Faculties of Medicine and Pharmacy at the [[Université de Montréal]].&lt;ref name ="EMPOWER"&gt;Tannenbaum C, Martin P, Tamblyn R, Benedetti A, Ahmed S. Reduction of inappropriate benzodiazepine prescriptions among older adults through direct patient education: the EMPOWER cluster randomized trial. JAMA Intern Med. 2014 Jun;174(6):890-8.&lt;/ref&gt; The trial recruited more than 300 patients aged 65–95 years in the greater Montréal area who were long term users of benzodiazepines. Approximately half the patients were exposed to educational intervention, which included Choosing Wisely recommendations around excessive benzodiazepine therapy. The patients were then followed for 6 months. The study found that 62% of patients who received the intervention initiated conversation regarding benzodiazepine therapy discontinuation with physicians and/or pharmacists.&lt;ref name ="EMPOWER" /&gt; After six months, 27% of the intervention group had stopped taking benzodiazepines, compared with 5% of the patients who did not receive the educational intervention.&lt;ref name= "EMPOWER" /&gt;

The impact of Choosing Wisely Canada on test ordering and utilization was studied at the [[North York General Hospital]] in the [[Greater Toronto Area]], one of the early adopters of the campaign. A multi-faceted campaign was implemented particularly in the hospital Emergency Department in June, 2014. Test utilization in the Emergency Department was analyzed between September 15 and November 21, 2014, and compared to the same 10-week period in 2013 to account for any seasonal variances.&lt;ref name ="NYGH"&gt;{{cite web|title = CWC in North York General Hospital ED |url= http://www.choosingwiselycanada.org/resources/updates-from-the-field/2014/11/20/north-york-general-hospital-ontario-oct-2014/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found a 41% decline in the number of laboratory tests ordered pre- and post- CWC program implementation, without any observable change in outcomes.&lt;ref name= "NYGH" /&gt; A preliminary cost analysis revealed annual departmental savings of approximately $215,000 while maintaining the same quality of care.&lt;ref name= "NYGH" /&gt;

A [[quality improvement]] initiative based on CWC principles was launched under the supervision of Dr. [[Danielle Martin]] at the [[Women's College Hospital|Women’s College Hospital]] (WCH) in Toronto. The [[American Thyroid Association]] and Choosing Wisely Canada recommends testing only [[Thyroid-stimulating hormone|Thyroid Stimulating Hormone]] (TSH) levels rather than testing both TSH and [[Thyroid hormones|free thyroid hormones]] (such as T4) for assessment of suspected [[hypothyroidism]], since majority of patients with hypothyroidism will present with abnormal TSH levels. A baseline audit at Women’s College Hospital revealed that 60% of all free thyroid hormones tests were performed in patients who had normal TSH levels, amounting to approximately $50,000 annually in additional laboratory testing expenditure.&lt;ref name ="WCH"&gt;Gilmour, J., Weisman, A., Vecchiarelli, J., Orlov, S., Goldberg, R. J., &amp; Goldberg, A. (2015). THR-191: Reducing Inappropriate Thyroid Function Tests at an Academic Ambulatory Hospital: Baseline Assessment for a Quality Improvement Initiative.&lt;/ref&gt; A “Reflex T4” approach was implemented at WCH, wherein free T4 tests would not be conducted unless TSH levels are abnormal, or if there are clinical indications of situations when measurement of free thyroid hormones would be necessary. When it is found that TSH levels are abnormal, free T4 levels would then be automatically measured.&lt;ref name= "WCH"/&gt; In addition to reducing inappropriate thyroid function testing, the impact of Choosing Wisely Canada is felt through numerous physician and patient awareness campaigns conducted at the hospital.&lt;ref name= "WCH"/&gt;

Medical education efforts of CWC are currently centered at the [[University of Toronto]], where Choosing Wisely principles are integrated into the undergraduate and postgraduate medical curricula through [[Problem-Based Learning]] seminars, lectures, resident research projects and academic half days.&lt;ref&gt;Leon-Carlyle, M., &amp; Srivastava, R. (2014). Medicine’s Push for Resource Stewardship in Education and Practice. University of Toronto Medical Journal,92(2).&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the example of Choosing Wisely in the United States and Choosing Wisely Canada, health leaders from [[Australia]], [[Austria]], [[Brazil]], [[Denmark]], [[England]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[India]], [[Israel]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Korea]], [[Switzerland]], and [[Wales]] have committed to initiating similar campaigns revolving around medical stewardship and low-value care in their respective countries. Italy has integrated the principles of Choosing Wisely in a campaign called “Doing more does not mean doing better”, and the Netherlands has launched “Choosing Wisely Netherlands”, both contributing to a growing international Choosing Wisely movement&lt;ref&gt;Levinson W, Kallewaard M, Bhatia RS, Wolfson D, Shortt S, Kerr EA; Choosing Wisely International Working Group. 'Choosing Wisely': a growing international campaign. BMJ Qual Saf. 2015 Feb;24(2):167-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partners &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Choosing Wisely Canada Partners |url= http://www.choosingwiselycanada.org/partners/}}&lt;/ref&gt;==

Choosing Wisely Canada is funded by the [[Canadian Medical Association]], [[University of Toronto]] and [[Government of Ontario]], and has received grants from the [[Commonwealth Fund]] and [[Canadian Institutes of Health Research]].

In addition to these sponsors, CWC is endorsed and supported by a number of national specialty societies, provincial medical associations, patient organizations, accrediting bodies and others.

{{Time sidebar |science}}

'''Chronobiology''' is a field of [[biology]] that examines periodic (cyclic) phenomena in living organisms and their adaptation to [[sun|solar]]- and [[moon|lunar]]-related rhythms.&lt;ref name="chrono"&gt;{{cite book |author=Patricia J. DeCoursey |author2=Jay C. Dunlap |author3=Jennifer J. Loros  |title=Chronobiology |publisher=Sinauer Associates Inc |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-87893-149-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; These cycles are known as '''biological rhythms'''. Chronobiology comes from the ancient Greek [[wikt:χρόνος|χρόνος]] (''chrónos'', meaning "time"), and [[biology]], which pertains to the study, or science, of [[life]]. The related terms ''chronomics'' and ''chronome'' have been used in some cases to describe either the [[molecular]] mechanisms involved in chronobiological phenomena or the more quantitative aspects of chronobiology, particularly where comparison of cycles between organisms is required.

Chronobiological studies include but are not limited to comparative [[anatomy]], [[physiology]], [[genetics]], [[molecular biology]] and [[behavior]] of organisms within biological rhythms mechanics.&lt;ref name="chrono"/&gt;  Other aspects include [[epigenetics]], development, reproduction, ecology and evolution.

==Description==
The variations of the timing and duration of biological activity in living organisms occur for many essential biological processes. These occur (a) in animals (eating, sleeping, mating, hibernating, migration, cellular regeneration, etc.), (b) in plants (leaf movements, [[photosynthetic]] reactions, etc.), and in microbial organisms such as fungi and protozoa. They have even been found in [[bacteria]], especially among the [[cyanobacteria]] (aka blue-green algae, see [[bacterial circadian rhythms]]). The most important rhythm in chronobiology is the [[circadian rhythm]], a roughly 24-hour cycle shown by physiological processes in all these organisms. The term ''circadian'' comes from the [[Latin]] ''circa'', meaning "around" and ''dies'', "day", meaning "approximately a day." It is regulated by [[circadian clock]]s.

The circadian rhythm can further be broken down into routine cycles during the 24-hour day:&lt;ref&gt;Nelson RJ. 2005. An Introduction to Behavioral Endocrinology. Sinauer Associates, Inc.: Massachusetts. Pg587.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Diurnality|Diurnal]], which describes organisms active during daytime
* [[Nocturnal]], which describes organisms active in the night
* [[Crepuscular]], which describes animals primarily active during the dawn and dusk hours (ex: white-tailed deer, some bats)

While [[circadian rhythms]] are defined as regulated by [[endogenous]] processes, other biological cycles may be regulated by exogenous signals.  In some cases, multi-trophic systems may exhibit rhythms driven by the circadian clock of one of the members (which may also be influenced or reset by external factors).  The endogenous plant cycles may regulate the activity of the bacterium by controlling availability of plant-produced photosynthate.

Many other important cycles are also studied, including:
* [[Infradian rhythm]]s, which are cycles longer than a day. Examples include [[Circannual Cycle|circannual]] or annual cycles that govern migration or reproduction cycles in many plants and animals, or the human [[menstrual cycle]].
* [[Ultradian rhythm]]s, which are cycles shorter than 24 hours, such as the 90-minute [[REM cycle]], the 4-hour [[nasal cycle]], or the 3-hour cycle of [[growth hormone]] production.
* [[Tide|Tidal rhythms]], commonly observed in marine life, which follow the roughly 12.4-hour transition from high to low tide and back.
* [[Lunar rhythms]], which follow the [[lunar month]] (29.5 days). They are relevant e.g. for marine life, as the level of the tides is modulated across the lunar cycle. 
* [[Gene oscillations]] – some genes are [[gene expression|expressed]] more during certain hours of the day than during other hours.

Within each cycle, the time period during which the process is more active is called the ''[[wikt:acrophase|acrophase]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Refinetti, Roberto (2006). ''Circadian Physiology''. CRC Press/Taylor &amp; Francis Group. {{ISBN|0-8493-2233-2}}.  [http://www.circadian.org/dictionary.html Lay summary]&lt;/ref&gt;  When the process is less active, the cycle is in its ''[[wikt:bathyphase|bathyphase]]'' or ''trough'' phase.  The particular moment of highest activity is the ''peak'' or ''maximum''; the lowest point is the ''nadir''.  How high (or low) the process gets is measured by the ''[[amplitude]]''.

==History==
A circadian cycle was first observed in the 18th century in the movement of plant leaves by the French scientist [[Jean-Jacques d'Ortous de Mairan]].&lt;ref&gt;for a description of circadian rhythms in plants by de Mairan, Linnaeus, and Darwin see [http://www.hhmi.org/biointeractive/museum/exhibit00/02_1.html]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1751 Swedish [[botanist]] and [[naturalist]] [[Carl Linnaeus]] (Carl von Linné) designed a [[Linnaeus' flower clock|flower clock]] using certain species of [[flowering plant]]s. By arranging the selected species in a circular pattern, he designed a clock that indicated the time of day by the flowers that were open at each given hour. For example, among members of the [[daisy family]], he used the [[Crepis|hawk's beard]] plant which opened its flowers at 6:30 am and the [[hawkbit]] which did not open its flowers until 7 am.&lt;ref name="linnean"&gt;http://www.linnean.org/Resources/LinneanSociety/Documents/Library-and-Archives/4-Floral%20Clock.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1960 symposium at [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]] laid the groundwork for the field of chronobiology.&lt;ref name="Kreitzman2004"&gt;{{cite book |author=Leon Kreitzman; Russell G. Foster |title=Rhythms of life: the biological clocks that control the daily lives of every living thing |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, Conn |year=2004 |isbn=0-300-10969-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also in 1960 that [[Patricia DeCoursey]] invented the [[phase response curve]], one of the major tools used in the field since.

[[Franz Halberg]] of the [[University of Minnesota]], who coined the word ''circadian'', is widely considered the "father of American chronobiology." However, it was [[Colin Pittendrigh]] and not Halberg who was elected to lead the ''Society for Research in Biological Rhythms'' in the 1970s. Halberg wanted more emphasis on the human and medical issues while Pittendrigh had his background more in evolution and ecology. With Pittendrigh as leader, the Society members did basic research on all types of organisms, plants as well as animals. More recently it has been difficult to get funding for such research on any other organisms than mice, rats, humans&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2006/07/clocktutorial_3_fortyfive_year.php |title=ClockTutorial #2a, Forty-Five Years of Pittendrigh's Empirical Generalizations |accessdate=2007-12-23 |last=Zivkovic |first=Bora |date=2006-07-03 |work=A Blog Around the Clock |publisher=ScienceBlogs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scienceblogs.com/clock/2006/09/clocks_in_bacteria_v_how_about.php |title=Clocks in Bacteria V |accessdate=2007-12-23 |last=Zivkovic |first=Bora |date=2006-05-17 |work=A Blog Around the Clock |publisher=ScienceBlogs}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]].

==Recent developments==
More recently, [[light therapy]] and [[melatonin]] administration have been explored by [[Alfred J. Lewy]] ([[OHSU]]), [[Josephine Arendt]] ([[University of Surrey]], UK) and other researchers as a means to reset animal and human circadian rhythms. Additionally, the presence of low-level light at night accelerates circadian re-entrainment of hamsters of all ages by 50%; this is thought to be related to simulation of moonlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Frank | first1 = D. W. | last2 = Evans | first2 = J. A. | last3 = Gorman | first3 = M. R. | doi = 10.1177/0748730409360890 | title = Time-Dependent Effects of Dim Light at Night on Re-Entrainment and Masking of Hamster Activity Rhythms | journal = Journal of Biological Rhythms | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 103–112 | year = 2010 | pmid =  20348461| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humans can have a propensity to be morning people or evening people; these behavioral preferences are called [[chronotype]]s for which there are various assessment questionnaires and biological marker correlations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Power of When|last=Breus, PHD|first=Michael|publisher=Little Brown and Company|year=2016|isbn=978-0-316-39126-9|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second half of 20th century, substantial contributions and formalizations have been made by Europeans such as [[Jürgen Aschoff]] and [[Colin Pittendrigh]], who pursued different but complementary views on the phenomenon of [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the circadian system by light (parametric, continuous, tonic, gradual vs. nonparametric, discrete, phasic, instantaneous, respectively&lt;ref&gt;see [http://jbr.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/15/3/195 this historical article], subscription required&lt;/ref&gt;).

There is also a food-entrainable biological clock, which is not confined to the suprachiasmatic nucleus. The location of this clock has been disputed. Working with mice, however, Fuller ''et al.'' concluded that the food-entrainable clock seems to be located in the dorsomedial [[hypothalamus]]. During restricted feeding, it takes over control of such functions as activity timing, increasing the chances of the animal successfully locating food resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fuller |first=Patrick M. |author2=Jun Lu |author3=Clifford B. Saper  |date=2008-05-23 |title=Differential Rescue of Light- and Food-Entrainable Circadian Rhythms |journal=Science |volume=320 |issue=5879 |pages=1074–1077 |pmid=18497298 |doi=10.1126/science.1153277 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/320/5879/1074 |format=free abstract |accessdate=2008-05-30|bibcode = 2008Sci...320.1074F |pmc=3489954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 a study published in PLoS ONE showed how 73 psychometric indicators measured on Twitter Content follow a diurnal pattern

==Other fields==
Chronobiology is an interdisciplinary field of investigation. It interacts with medical and other research fields such as [[sleep medicine]], [[endocrinology]], [[geriatrics]], [[sports medicine]], [[space medicine]] and [[photoperiodism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Postolache |first=Teodor T. |title=Sports Chronobiology, An Issue of Clinics in Sports Medicine |publisher=Saunders |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-4160-2769-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ernest Lawrence Rossi |first=David Lloyd |title=Ultradian Rhythms in Life Processes: Inquiry into Fundamental Principles of Chronobiology and Psychobiology |publisher=Springer-Verlag Berlin and Heidelberg GmbH &amp; Co.

In spite of the similarity of the name to genuine biological rhythms, the theory and practice of [[biorhythm]]s is a classic example of [[pseudoscience]].  It attempts to describe a set of cyclic variations in human behavior based on a person's birth date. It is not a part of chronobiology.&lt;ref name="NASA"&gt;{{cite web |title=Effects of circadian rhythm phase alteration on physiological and psychological variables: Implications to pilot performance (including a partially annotated bibliography) |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19810016185&amp;hterms=NASA-TM-81277&amp;qs=Ntx%3Dmode%2520matchallany%26Ntk%3DAll%26Ns%3DLoaded-Date%7C1%26N%3D0%26Ntt%3DNASA-TM-81277 |work=NASA-TM-81277 |publisher=[[NASA]] |date=1981-03-01 |accessdate=2011-05-25}} "No evidence exists to support the concept of biorhythms; in fact, scientific data refute their existence."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Civic nationalism''', also known as '''liberal nationalism''', is a form of [[nationalism]] identified by [[political philosophy|political philosophers]] who believe in an inclusive form of [[nationalism]] that adheres with traditional liberal values of [[Freedom (political)|freedom]], [[Toleration|tolerance]], [[Egalitarianism|equality]], and [[individual rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Auer|first1=Stefan|title=Liberal Nationalism in Central Europe|date=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1134378602|page=5|url=https://books.google.com.ar/books?hl=es&amp;lr=&amp;id=BhNsM_ttOb4C&amp;pg=PA5|accessdate=13 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tamir, Yael. 1993.

''[[Nations and Nationalism (journal)|Nations and Nationalism]]'' 10(3): 231-250.&lt;/ref&gt; Civic nationalism is frequently contrasted with [[ethnic nationalism]].

[[Ernest Renan]] is often thought to be an early civic nationalist.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Renan. "[[What is a Nation?]]", 1882; cf. Chaim Gans, ''The Limits of Nationalism'', Cambridge University Press, 2003, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Civic nationhood is a political identity built around shared citizenship within the state. Thus, a "civic nation" isn't defined by its language or culture, but by its political institutions and liberal principles, which its citizens pledge to uphold. Membership in the civic nation is open to anyone who shares these values.&lt;ref name= definition&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs|author=ANNA STILZ|title=Civic Nationalism and Language Policy|page=257|volume=37|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In theory, a civic nation or state does not aim to promote one culture over another.&lt;ref name = definition/&gt; German philosopher [[Jürgen Habermas]] argued that immigrants to a [[Liberal democracy|liberal-democratic]] state need not assimilate into the host culture, but only need to accept the principles of the country's constitution (cf. [[Constitutional patriotism]]).&lt;ref name = definition/&gt;

==History==
{{or-section|date=January 2017}}
Civic nationalism lies within the traditions of [[rationalism]] and [[liberalism]], but as a form of nationalism it is contrasted with [[ethnic nationalism]]. Membership of the civic [[nation]] is considered voluntary, as in [[Ernest Renan]]'s classical definition in "[[Qu'est-ce qu'une nation?]]" of the nation as a "daily referendum" characterized by the "will to live together".{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Civic-national ideals influenced the development of [[representative democracy]] in countries such as the [[United States]] and [[France]] (see the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] of 1776, and the ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]'' of 1789).

The Corsican nationalist movement organized around the [[FLNC]] is giving a civic definition of the Corsican nation ("destiny communauty") in the continuity of [[Pasquale Paoli]] and the ideas of the [[Lumières]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4787">'''Clinical pastoral education''' (CPE) is [[education]] to teach [[pastoral care]] to [[clergy]] and others. CPE is the primary method of training hospital and hospice [[chaplains]] and spiritual care providers in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt; Cobb, Puchalski and Rumbold (eds.), ''Oxford Textbook of Spirituality in Healthcare'', 2012, p. 417.&lt;/ref&gt; CPE is both a [[multicultural]] and [[interfaith]] experience that uses real-life ministry encounters of students to improve the ministry and pastoral care provided by caregivers.&lt;ref name="FAQ"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.acpe.edu/faq.htm |title =Frequently Asked Questions about ACPE Clinical Pastoral Education |work =The Association for Clinical Pastoral Education, Inc |at = See section [http://www.acpe.edu/faq.htm#faq1 What is Clinical Pastoral Education?] |accessdate = 2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Theory==
An underpinning theory of education that structures clinical pastoral education is the "[[Reflective Practice|Action-Reflection]]" mode of learning. CPE students typically compose "verbatims" of their pastoral care encounters in which they are invited to reflect upon what occurred and draw insight from these reflections that can be implemented in future pastoral care events.&lt;ref&gt;Cobb, Puchalski and Rumbold (eds.), ''Oxford Textbook of Spirituality in Healthcare'', 2012, p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Although the practice of pastoral care has a long tradition in Christianity and to some extent in other faith traditions, the systematic analysis of pastoral practice associated with clinical pastoral education had its beginnings in the early 20th century. In 1925, [[Richard Clarke Cabot|Richard Cabot]], a physician and adjunct lecturer at the [[Harvard Divinity School]], published an article in ''[[Survey Graphic]]'' suggesting that every candidate for ministry receive clinical training for pastoral work similar to the clinical training offered to medical students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Stokoe |first=Rodney J.R. |year=2005 |origyear=1974 |title=Clinical Pastoral Education |type=Reprint |journal=The Nova Scotia Medical Bulletin |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=26–28 |issn=0029-5094 |url=http://www.cappe.org/association/download/cpehistory_stokoe.pdf |accessdate=2011-10-20 |format=pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929171141/http://www.cappe.org/association/download/cpehistory_stokoe.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-29 |df= }} The reprint is available as part of the project: {{cite web |url=http://www.cappe.org/mem/index.html |title=Living Human Memories |work=CASC/ACSS The Canadian Association for Spiritual Care |accessdate=2011-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622230836/http://www.cappe.org/mem/index.html |archivedate=2011-06-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s, the Rev. [[Anton Boisen]] placed theological students at the [[Chicago Theological Seminary]] in supervised contact with patients in mental hospitals, a flagship program that later resulted in the forming of the ACPE.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090403034355/http://www.aapc.org/content/brief-history-pastoral-counseling American Association of Pastoral Counselors/History]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accrediting bodies==

CPE in Australia and New Zealand is conducted by six CPE accrediting associations that consult together for common curricula and standards of practice under an umbrella association, the Australia New Zealand Association of Clinical Pastoral Education (ANZACPE).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aspea.org.au/anzacpe.php&lt;/ref&gt; The six constituent associations are: [[New South Wales College of Clinical Pastoral Education]] (New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory); Queensland Institute of Clinical Pastoral Education; Association for Supervised Pastoral Education in Australia (Victoria and Tasmania); Association for Clinical Pastoral Education in Western Australia; South Australia and Northern Territory Association for Clinical Pastoral Education; and New Zealand Association for Clinical Pastoral Education.

In the United States, the Association for Clinical Pastoral Education is recognized as an [[education accreditation|accrediting]] organization for CPE programs by the [[U.S. Department of Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www2.ed.gov/admins/finaid/accred/accreditation_pg7.html|title =Specialized Accrediting Agencies| publisher=U.S. Department of Education|accessdate = 2013-07-04}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, all CPE training and accreditation is done through [http://www.spiritualcare.ca/ CASC], the Canadian Association of Spiritual Care / Association Canadienne de Soins Spirituels.

A '''comic book''' or '''comicbook''',&lt;ref&gt;[[Scott Shaw (artist)|Scott Shaw!]], Mike Kazaleh, "Secret Agent Orange," ''Annoying Orange'' #1, New York: Papercutz, December 2012, pp. 61–2.&lt;/ref&gt; also called '''comic magazine''' or simply '''comic''', is a publication that consists of [[comic]] art in the form of sequential juxtaposed [[panel (comics)|panels]] that represent individual scenes. Panels are often accompanied by brief descriptive prose and written narrative, usually dialog contained in [[word balloon]]s emblematic of the comics art form. Although {{not a typo|comics has}} some origins in [[18th century]] [[Japan]], comic books were first popularized in the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]] during the 1930s. The first modern comic book, ''[[Famous Funnies]]'', was released in the U.S. in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor [[comic strip]]s, which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.randomhistory.com/1-50/033comic.html A History of the Comic Book]. Retrieved 16 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''comic book'' derives from [[American comic book]]s once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone; however, this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres, usually not humorous in tone.

The largest comic book market is Japan. By 1995, the [[manga]] market in Japan was valued at {{JPY|586.4 billion|link=yes}} ({{US$|6{{ndash}}7 billion|long=no|link=yes}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schodt|first=Frederik|authorlink=Frederik L.

==Structure==
Comic books are reliant on their organization and appearance. Authors largely focus on the frame of the page, size, orientation, and panel positions. These characteristic aspects of comic books are necessary in conveying the content and messages of the author. The key elements of comic books include panels, balloons (speech bubbles), text (lines), and characters. Balloons are usually convex spatial containers of information that are related to a character using a [[tail element]]. The tail has an origin, path, tip, and pointed direction. Key tasks in the creation of comic books are writing, drawing, and coloring.
&lt;!-- 
WHAT??? There are many technological formulas used to create comic books, including directions, axes, data, and metrics. Following these key formatting procedures is the writing, drawing, and coloring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Knowledge-driven understanding of images in comic books|last = Rigaud|first = Christophe|date = 2015|journal = International Journal on Document Analysis and Recognition|doi = 10.1007/s10032-015-0243-1|pmid = |access-date = |volume = 18|issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

==American comic books==
{{main|American comic book}}
Comics as a print medium have existed in America since the printing of ''[[Histoire de M. Vieux Bois|The Adventures of Mr. Obadiah Oldbuck]]'' in 1842 in hardcover,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~library/digital/collections/books/ocn259708589/ocn259708589.html ''The Adventures of M. Obadiah Oldbuck''] at the [[Dartmouth College]] library&lt;/ref&gt; making it the first known American prototype comic book. Proto-comics periodicals began appearing early in the 20th century, with historians generally citing [[Dell Publishing]]'s 36-page ''Famous Funnies: A Carnival of Comics'' as the first true American comic book; Goulart, for example, calls it "the cornerstone for one of the most lucrative branches of magazine publishing".&lt;ref name="ron"&gt;{{cite book | authorlink=Ron Goulart | last=Goulart | first=Ron | title = Comic Book Encyclopedia| publisher = [[HarperCollins|Harper Entertainment]] | location=New York| year= 2004 | isbn=978-0060538163}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]]'s [[Superman]] in 1938 turned comic books into a major industry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Goulart | first=Ron | authorlink=Ron Goulart | title=Comic Book Culture: An Illustrated History | date= 2000 | publisher=Collectors Press | page=43 | isbn=978-1-888054-38-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ushered the [[Golden Age of Comics]]. The Golden Age originated the [[archetype]] of the [[superhero]].According to historian [[Michael A. Amundson]], appealing comic-book characters helped ease young readers' fear of nuclear war and neutralize anxiety about the questions posed by atomic power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zeman|first1=Scott C.|last2=Amundson|first2=Michael A.|title=Atomic Culture: How We Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb|date=2004|publisher=University Press of Colorado|location=Boulder, Colorado|isbn=9780870817632|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians generally divide the timeline of the American comic book into eras. The [[Golden Age of Comic Books]] began in the 1930s; which is generally considered the beginning of the comic book that we know today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/feature/the-golden-age-of-comics/ | title= The Golden Age of Comics | work = History Detectives: Special Investigations | publisher = [[PBS]] | accessdate= February 18, 2015| quote= The precise era of the Golden Age is disputed, though most agree that it was born with the launch of Superman in 1938.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Silver Age of comic books]] is generally considered to date from the first successful revival of the then-dormant superhero form, with the debut of the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]''  #4 (Oct. 1956).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=10649 | title=DC Flashback: The Flash | accessdate=27 June 2008 | last=CBR News Team | date=2 July 2007 | publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65JDtF5cz?url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=10649 | archivedate=8 February 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.silverbulletcomics.com/news/story.php?a=5706  | title=Breaking the Border – Rants and Ramblings | accessdate=5 January 2010 | last=Zicari | first=Anthony | date=3 August 2007 | publisher=[[Comics Bulletin]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070826092448/http://www.silverbulletcomics.com/news/story.php?a=5706 |archivedate = 26 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Silver Age lasted through the late 1960s or early 1970s, during which time [[Marvel Comics]] revolutionized the medium with such [[naturalism (literature)|naturalistic]] superheroes as [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]]'s [[Fantastic Four]] and Lee and [[Steve Ditko]]'s [[Spider-Man]]. The demarcation between the Silver Age and the following era, the [[Bronze Age of Comic Books]], is less well-defined, with the Bronze Age running from the very early 1970s through the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name=libraries&gt;{{cite book | title=Comic Book Collections for Libraries | publisher=Libraries Unlimited | first=Bryan D. |last=Fagan  |first2= Jody Condit| last2= Condit | isbn=  978-1598845112 | year=2011| page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Modern Age of Comic Books]] runs from the mid-1980s to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= [[Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide]] | year=2008 |volume=38| page= 1028 | chapter = Glossary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable event in the history of the American comic book came with psychiatrist [[Fredric Wertham]]'s criticisms of the medium in his book ''[[Seduction of the Innocent]]'' (1954), which prompted the American [[Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency]] to investigate comic books. In response to attention from the government and from the media, the U.S. comic book industry set up the Comics Magazine Association of America.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=Jeffrey|title=Comic Book Fandom and Cultural Capital|journal=Journal of Popular Culture|date=1997|volume=30|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CMAA instilled the [[Comics Code Authority]] in 1954 and drafted the self-censorship Comics Code that year, which required all comic books to go through a process of approval. It was not until the 1970s that comic books could be published without passing through the inspection of the CMAA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Comic book fandom and cultural capital|last = Brown|first = Jeffrey|date = 1997|journal = Journal of Popular Culture|doi = 10.1111/j.0022-3840.1997.3004_13.x|pmid = |access-date = |issn = 0022-3840|volume = 30|issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Code was made formally defunct in November 2011.

===   Underground comic books   ===
{{Main|Underground comix}}

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, a surge of creativity emerged in what became known as [[underground comix]]. Published and distributed independently of the established comics industry, most of such comics reflected the youth [[counterculture]] and [[drug culture]] of the time. Many had an uninhibited, often irreverent style; their frank depictions of nudity, sex, profanity, and politics had no parallel outside their precursors, the pornographic and even more obscure "[[Tijuana bibles]]". Underground comics were almost never sold at newsstands, but rather in such youth-oriented outlets as [[head shops]] and record stores, as well as by [[mail order]].

[[Frank Stack]]'s ''The Adventures of Jesus'', published under the name Foolbert Sturgeon,&lt;ref name="Shelton"&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Stack | first1=Frank | authorlink1=Frank Stack | last2=Shelton | first2=Gilbert | authorlink2=Gilbert Shelton | title=The New Adventures of Jesus | date=25 December 2006 | publisher=[[Fantagraphics Books]] | page=9 | chapter=Introduction | isbn=978-1-56097-780-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Skinn-34"/&gt; has been credited as the first underground comic;&lt;ref name="Shelton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Skinn-34"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Skinn | first=Dez | authorlink=Dez Skinn | title=Comix: The Underground Revolution | date=20 May 2004 | publisher=[[Thunder's Mouth Press]] | page=34 | chapter=Heroes of the Revolution | isbn=978-1-56025-572-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[R. Crumb]] and the crew of cartoonists who worked on ''[[Zap Comix]]'' popularized the form.

===Alternative comics===
{{Main|Alternative comics}}

The rise of comic book [[specialty store]]s in the late 1970s created/paralleled a dedicated market for "independent" or "[[alternative comics]]" in the U.S. The first such comics included the anthology series ''[[Star Reach]]'', published by comic book writer [[Mike Friedrich]] from 1974 to 1979, and [[Harvey Pekar]]'s ''[[American Splendor]]'', which continued sporadic publication into the 21st century and which [[Shari Springer Berman]] and [[Robert Pulcini]] adapted into a [[American Splendor (film)|2003 film]]. Some independent comics continued in the tradition of underground comics. While their content generally remained less explicit, others resembled the output of mainstream publishers in format and genre, but were published by smaller artist-owned companies or by single artists. A few (notably ''[[RAW (magazine)|RAW]]'') represented experimental attempts to bring comics closer to the status of [[fine art]].

During the 1970s the "[[small press]]" culture grew and diversified. By the 1980s, several independent publishers - such as [[Pacific Comics|Pacific]], [[Eclipse Comics|Eclipse]], [[First Comics|First]], [[Comico: The Comic Company|Comico]], and [[Fantagraphics]] - had started releasing a wide range of styles and formats—from color-superhero, [[detective]], and science-fiction comic books to black-and-white magazine-format stories of [[Latin American]] [[magical realism]].

A number of small publishers in the 1990s changed the format and distribution of their comics to more closely resemble non-comics publishing. The "[[minicomic]]s" form, an extremely informal version of [[self-publishing]], arose in the 1980s and became increasingly popular among artists in the 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~sap/decal/americancomics|title=americancomics|website=www.ocf.berkeley.edu|access-date=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite reaching an even more limited audience than the small press.

Small publishers regularly releasing titles include [[Avatar Comics]], [[Hyperwerks]], Raytoons, and [[Terminal Press]], buoyed by such advances in printing technology as digital [[print on demand|print-on-demand]].

===Graphic novels===

{{Main|Graphic novel}}
In 1964, Richard Kyle coined the term "graphic novel".{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Precursors of the form existed by the 1920s, which saw a revival of the [[medieval]] [[woodcut]] tradition by Belgian [[Frans Masereel]],&lt;ref&gt;Sabin, Roger. ''Adult Comics: An Introduction''(Routledge New Accents Library Collection, 2005), p. 291 {{ISBN|978-0-415-29139-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-29139-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; American [[Lynd Ward]] and others, including Stan Lee.
In 1950, [[St. John Publications]] produced the [[digest-sized]], adult-oriented "picture novel" ''[[It Rhymes with Lust]]'', a 128-page digest by [[pseudonym]]ous writer "Drake Waller" ([[Arnold Drake]] and [[Leslie Waller]]), penciler [[Matt Baker (artist)|Matt Baker]] and inker [[Ray Osrin]], touted as "an original full-length novel" on its cover. In 1971, writer-artist [[Gil Kane]] and collaborators devised the paperback "comics novel" ''[[Blackmark]]''. [[Will Eisner]] popularized the term "graphic novel" when he used it on the cover of the paperback edition of his work ''[[A Contract with God|A Contract with God, and Other Tenement Stories]]'' in 1978.

In 2017, the comic book market size for North America was just over $1 billion with digital sales being flat, book stores having a 1 percent decline, and comic book stores having a 10 percent decline over 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comichron.com/yearlycomicssales/industrywide/2017-industrywide.html |title=Comics and graphic novel sales down 6.5% in 2017 |work=Comichron |date=2018-07-13 |accessdate=2018-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comic book collecting===
{{Main|Comic book collecting}}

The 1970s saw the advent of specialty [[comic book store]]s. Initially, comic books were marketed by publishers to children because comic books were perceived as children's entertainment. However, with increasing recognition of comics as an art form and the growing pop culture presence of [[comic book convention]]s, they are now embraced by many adults.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Comic book collectors are often lifelong enthusiasts of the comic book stories, and they usually focus on particular heroes and attempt to assemble the entire run of a title.  Comics are published with a sequential number. The first issue of a long-running comic book series is commonly the rarest and most desirable to collectors. The first appearance of a specific character, however, might be in a pre-existing title.  For example, [[Spider-Man]]'s first appearance was in ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' #15.  New characters were often introduced this way, and did not receive their own titles until there was a proven audience for the hero. As a result, comics that feature the first appearance of an important character will sometimes be even harder to find than the number 1 issue of a character's own title.

Some rare comic books include copies of the unreleased ''[[Motion Picture Funnies Weekly]]'' #1 from 1939. Eight copies, plus one without a cover, emerged in the estate of the deceased publisher in 1974. The "Pay Copy" of this book sold for $43,125 in a 2005 [[Heritage Auctions|Heritage]] auction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comics.ha.com/common/view_item.php?Sale_No=818&amp;Lot_No=2020&amp;type=prte-pr091305a |title=Motion Picture Funnies Weekly #1 Pay Copy (First Funnies, Inc., 1939) CGC VF/NM 9.0 Cream to off-white pages.

The most valuable American comics have combined rarity and quality with the first appearances of popular and enduring characters. Four comic books have sold for over $1 million USD {{as of|2010|December|lc=y}}, including two examples of [[Action Comics]] #1, the first appearance of [[Superman]],&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/2010/02/26/news/economy/batman_comic/ Batman comic book beats Superman at auction, sets record] CNN Money 2-26-10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://money.cnn.com/2014/08/25/news/companies/comic-record/index.html Superman comic sells for record $3.2 million] (CNN Money) – 25 Auguest 2014&lt;/ref&gt; both sold privately through online dealer ComicConnect.com in 2010, and [[Detective Comics]] #27, the first appearance of [[Batman]], via public auction.

Updating the above price obtained for ''[[Action Comics]]'' #1, the first appearance of [[Superman]], the highest sale on record for this book is $3.2 million, for a 9.0 copy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Whitney|first=Lance|title=Superman's Action Comics No. 1 sells for record $3.2 million on eBay|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/supermans-action-comics-no-1-sells-for-record-3-2-million-on-ebay|accessdate=31 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Sentence fragment: Before [[Fawcett Comics]] introduced [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] --&gt;

Misprints, promotional comic-dealer incentive printings, and issues with extremely low distribution also generally have scarcity value. The rarest modern comic books include the [[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen#Issue 5 recall|original press run]] of ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'' #5, which DC executive [[Paul Levitz]] recalled and pulped due to the appearance of a vintage [[Victorian era]] advertisement for "Marvel [[Douche]]", which the publisher considered offensive;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/columns/index.cgi?article=2153 | publisher=Comic Book Resources | date=23 May 2005 | title=Alan's Previous Problems With DC (sidebar) | work=Lying in the Gutters | last=Johnston | first=Rich | authorlink=Rich Johnston}}&lt;/ref&gt; only 100 copies exist, most of which have been [[Comics Guaranty LLC|CGC]] graded. (See [[Recalled comics]] for more pulped, recalled, and erroneous comics.)

In 2000, a company named [[Comics Guaranty]] (CGC) began to "slab" comics, encasing them in a thick plastic and giving them a numeric grade. {{as of|2014||}}, there are two companies that provide third party grading of comic book condition. Because condition is so important to the value of rare comics, the idea of grading by a company that does not buy or sell comics seems like a good one. However, there is some controversy about whether this grading service is worth the high cost, and whether it is a positive development for collectors, or if it primarily services speculators who wish to make a quick profit trading in comics as one might trade in stocks or fine art. Comic grading has created valuation standards that online price guides such as [http://comics.gocollect.com GoCollect] and GPAnalysis have used to report on real-time market values.

The original artwork pages from comic books are also collected, and these are perhaps the rarest of all comic book collector's items, as there is only one unique page of artwork for each page that was printed and published.  These were created by a writer, who created the story; a pencil artist, who laid out the sequential panels on the page; an ink artist, who went over the pencil with pen and black ink; a letterer, who provided the dialogue and narration of the story by hand lettering each word; and finally a colorist, who added color as the last step before the finished pages went to the printer.

When the original pages of artwork are returned by the printer, they are typically given back to the artists, who sometimes sell them at comic book conventions, or in galleries and art shows related to comic book art.  The original pages of the first appearances of such legendary characters as Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and Spider-man are considered priceless.

===Japanese manga===
{{Main|Manga}}

The first comic books in Japan appeared during the 18th century in the form of woodblock-printed booklets containing short stories drawn from folk tales, legends, and historical accounts, told in a simple visual-verbal idiom. Known as {{Nihongo|"red books"|赤本|akahon}}, {{Nihongo|"black books"|黒本|kurobon}}, and {{Nihongo|"blue books"|青本|aohon}}, these were written primarily for less literate readers. However, with the publication in 1775 of Koikawa Harumachi's comic book {{Nihongo|''Master Flashgold's Splendiferous Dream''|金々先生栄花の夢|Kinkin sensei eiga no yume}}, an evolved form of comic book originated, which required greater literacy and cultural sophistication. This was known as the {{nihongo3|lit. ''yellow cover''|黄表紙|[[kibyōshi]]}}. Published in thousands of copies, the ''kibyōshi'' may have been the earliest fully realized comic book for adults in world literary history. Approximately 2,000 titles remain [[Extant literature|extant]].

Modern comic books in Japan developed from a mixture of these earlier comic books and of woodblock prints {{Nihongo|''[[ukiyo-e]]''|浮世絵|}} with Western styles of drawing. They took their current form shortly after World War II. They are usually published in black-and-white, except for the covers, which are usually printed in four colors, although occasionally, the first few pages may also be printed in full color. The term ''manga'' means "random (or whimsical) pictures", and first came into common usage in the late 18th century with the publication of such works as [[Santō Kyōden]]'s picturebook {{Nihongo|''Shiji no yukikai''|四時交加|}} (1798) and Aikawa Minwa's ''Comic Sketches of a Hundred Women'' (1798). During the [[Meiji period]], the term ''[[Akahon]]'' was also common.

Western artists were brought over to teach their students such concepts as line, form, and color; these were things which had not been regarded as conceptually important in ''ukiyo-e'', as the idea behind the picture was of paramount importance. Manga at this time was referred to as ''Ponchi-e'' (Punch-picture) and, like its British counterpart ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' magazine, mainly depicted humor and political satire in short one- or [[Yonkoma|four-picture format]].

Dr. [[Osamu Tezuka]] (1928–1989) further developed this form. Seeing an animated war propaganda film titled {{Nihongo|''[[Momotaro's Divine Sea Warriors]]''|桃太郎　海の神兵|''Momotarō Umi no Shinpei''}} inspired Tezuka to become a comic artist. He introduced episodic storytelling and character development in comic format, in which each story is part of larger story arc. The only text in Tezuka's comics was the characters' dialogue and this further lent his comics a cinematic quality. Inspired by the work of Walt Disney, Tezuka also adopted a style of drawing facial features in which a character's [[human eye|eye]]s, [[human nose|nose]], and mouth are drawn in an extremely exaggerated manner. This style created immediately recognizable expressions using very few lines, and the simplicity of this style allowed Tezuka to be prolific. Tezuka's work generated new interest in the ''ukiyo-e'' tradition, in which the image is a representation of an idea, rather than a depiction of reality.

Though a close equivalent to the American comic book, manga has historically held a more important place in Japanese culture than comics have in American culture. Japanese society shows a wide respect for manga, both as an art form and as a form of popular literature. Many manga become television shows or short films. As with its American counterpart, some manga has been criticized for its sexuality and violence, although in the absence of official or even industry restrictions on content, artists have freely created manga for every age group and for every topic.

Manga magazines—also known as [[comics anthology|"anthologies"]]—often run several series concurrently, with approximately 20 to 40 pages allocated to each series per issue. These magazines range from 200 to more than 850 pages each. Manga magazines also contain [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] comics and a variety of four-panel yonkoma (equivalent to comic strips). Manga series may continue for [[List of manga series by volume count|many years]] if they are successful, with stories often collected and reprinted in book-sized volumes called {{nihongo3|lit. ''stand-alone book''|単行本|[[tankōbon]]}}, the equivalent of the American [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperbacks]]. These volumes use higher-quality paper and are useful to readers who want to be brought up to date with a series, or to readers who find the cost of the weekly or monthly publications to be prohibitive. Deluxe versions are printed as commemorative or collectible editions.

===Dōjinshi===
{{Main|Dōjinshi}}

{{nihongo3|''fan magazine''|同人誌|Dōjinshi}}, [[fan-made]] Japanese comics, operate in a far larger market in Japan than the American "underground comics" market; the largest dōjinshi fair, [[Comiket]], attracts 500,000 visitors twice a year.&lt;ref&gt;Mizoguchi Akiko (2003).

===Korean manhwa===
{{Main|Manhwa}}

Korean manhwa have quickly gained popularity outside Korea in recent times as a result of the [[Korean Wave]]. The manhwa industry has suffered through two crashes and strict censorship since its early beginnings as a result of the Japanese occupation of the peninsula which stunt the growth of the industry but has now started to flourish thanks in part to the internet and new ways to read manhwa whether on computers or through smartphones. In the past manhwa would be marketed as manga outside the country in order to make sure they would sell well but now that is no longer needed since more people are now more knowledgeable about the industry and Korean culture.

===Webtoons===
{{Main|Webtoons}}

Webtoons have become popular in South Korea as a new way to read comics. Thanks in part to different censorship rules, color and unique visual effects, and optimization for easier reading on smartphones and computers. More [[manhwaga]] have made the switch from traditional print manhwa to online webtoons thanks to better pay and more freedom than traditional print manhwa. The webtoon format has also expanded to other countries outside of Korea like China, Japan, Southeast Asia, and Western countries. Major webtoon distributors include Lezhin, Naver, and Kakao.

===Franco-Belgian comics===

{{Main|Franco-Belgian comics}}
[[File:René Goscinny.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[René Goscinny]] (1926 – 1977), writer of the ''[[Astérix]]'' comic book series.]] 
France and [[Belgium]] have a long tradition in comics and comic books, called ''[[Franco-Belgian comics|BDs]]'' (an abbreviation of ''bande dessinées'') in French and ''strips'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. Belgian comic books originally written in Dutch show the influence of the Francophone "Franco-Belgian" comics, but have their own distinct style.

The name ''bande dessinée'' derives from the original description of the art form as drawn strips (the phrase literally translates as "the drawn strip"), analogous to the sequence of images in a film strip. As in its English equivalent, the word "bande" can be applied to both film and comics. Significantly, the French-language term contains no indication of subject-matter, unlike the American terms "comics" and "funnies", which imply an art form not to be taken seriously. The distinction of comics as ''le neuvième art'' (literally, "the ninth art") is prevalent in French scholarship on the form, as is the concept of comics criticism and scholarship itself. Relative to the respective size of their populations, the innumerable authors in France and Belgium publish a high volume of comic books. In North America, the more serious Franco-Belgian comics are often seen as equivalent to graphic novels, but whether they are long or short, bound or in magazine format, in Europe there is no need for a more sophisticated term, as the art's name does not itself imply something frivolous.

In France, authors control the publication of most comics. The author works within a self-appointed time-frame, and it is common for readers to wait six months or as long as two years between installments. Most books first appear in print as a hardcover book, typically with 48, 56, or 64 pages.

===British comics===

[[File:Ally Sloper's Half Holiday (front cover - 27 December 1884).png|thumb|upright|200px|Cover to 27 December 1884 edition of ''[[Ally Sloper's Half Holiday]]''.

Although ''[[Ally Sloper's Half Holiday]]'' (1884) was aimed at an adult market, publishers quickly targeted a younger demographic, which has led to most publications being for children and has created an association in the public's mind of comics as somewhat juvenile. ''The Guardian'' refers to [[Ally Sloper]] as “one of the world’s first iconic cartoon characters”, and “as famous in Victorian Britain as [[Dennis the Menace and Gnasher|Dennis the Menace]] would be a century later.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Top hats off to Marie Duval, a lost Victorian cartoonist sensation |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2014/oct/27/marie-duval-victorian-cartoonist-ally-sloper |accessdate=21 November 2018 |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; British comics in the early 20th century typically evolved from illustrated [[penny dreadful]]s of the Victorian era (featuring [[Sweeney Todd]], [[Dick Turpin]] and ''[[Varney the Vampire]]'').&lt;ref name="histoday94"&gt;{{cite journal| url=https://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst?docId=5000228860 | title= Horror Comics: The Nasties of the 1950s | author= John Sringhall | work=[[History Today]]| issue= 7| volume= 44 | date=July 1994| publisher= [[Questia Online Library]]| accessdate=2010-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; First published in the 1830s, penny dreadfuls were “Britain’s first taste of mass-produced popular culture for the young.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Penny dreadfuls: the Victorian equivalent of video games |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/30/penny-dreadfuls-victorian-equivalent-video-games-kate-summerscale-wicked-boy |accessdate=21 November 2018 |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two most popular British comic books, ''[[The Beano]]'' and ''[[The Dandy]]'', were first published by [[DC Thomson]] in the 1930s. By 1950 the weekly circulation of both reached two million.&lt;ref name="Armstrong"&gt;Armstrong, Stephen.

In 1954, ''[[Tiger (Fleetway)|Tiger]]'' comics introduced ''[[Roy of the Rovers]]'', the hugely popular football based strip recounting the life of [[Roy Race]] and the team he played for, [[Melchester Rovers]]. The stock media phrase "real 'Roy of the Rovers' stuff" is often used by football writers, commentators and fans when describing displays of great skill, or surprising results that go against the odds, in reference to the dramatic storylines that were the strip's trademark.&lt;ref&gt;Tomlinson, Alan; Young, Christopher (2000), "Golden Boys and Golden Memories: Fiction, Ideology, and Reality in Roy of the Rovers and the Death of the Hero", in Jones, Dudley; Watkins, Tony, A Necessary Fantasy?: the Heroic Figure in Children's Popular Culture: Vol 18, Garland Publishing. pp. 190–191&lt;/ref&gt; Other comic books such as ''[[Eagle (comic)|Eagle]]'', ''[[Valiant (comics)|Valiant]]'', ''[[Warrior (comics)|Warrior]]'', ''[[Viz (comics)|Viz]]'' and ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'' also flourished. Some comics, such as ''[[Judge Dredd]]'' and other ''2000 AD'' titles, have been published in a [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] form. Underground comics and [[British small press comics|"small press"]] titles have also appeared in the UK, notably ''[[Oz (magazine)|Oz]]'' and ''[[Escape Magazine]]''.

The content of ''[[Action (comic)|Action]]'', another title aimed at children and launched in the mid-1970s, became the subject of discussion in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. Although on a smaller scale than similar investigations in the U.S., such concerns led to a moderation of content published within British comics. Such moderation never became formalized to the extent of promulgating a code, nor did it last long. The UK has also established a healthy market in the reprinting and repackaging of material, notably material originating in the U.S. The lack of reliable supplies of American comic books led to a variety of black-and-white reprints, including Marvel's monster comics of the 1950s, Fawcett's [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], and other characters such as [[Sheena, Queen of the Jungle|Sheena]], [[Mandrake the Magician]], and [[the Phantom]]. Several reprint companies became involved in repackaging American material for the British market, notably the importer and distributor Thorpe &amp; Porter. Marvel Comics established a UK office in 1972. DC Comics and [[Dark Horse Comics]] also opened offices in the 1990s. The repackaging of European material has occurred less frequently, although ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' and ''[[Asterix]]'' serials have been successfully translated and repackaged in softcover books.

In the 1980s, a resurgence of British writers and artists gained prominence in mainstream comic books, which was dubbed the "[[British Invasion (comics)|British Invasion]]" in comic book history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.artfund.org/news/2014/05/01/comics-unmasked-the-british-invasion | title= Comics Unmasked: The British invasion | author=  | work=| issue= | volume=  | publisher= Art Fund| accessdate=2014-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These writers and artists brought with them their own mature themes and philosophy such as anarchy, controversy and politics common in British media. These elements would pave the way for mature and "darker and edgier" comic books and jump start the [[Modern Age of Comics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://sequart.org/magazine/20743/1986-british-invasion-part-3-neil-gaiman-swamp-thing/ | title= The British Invasion, Part 3: Neil Gaiman &amp; Swamp Thing | author= Peter Sanderson | work=| issue= | volume=  | publisher= ''Sequart Organization''| accessdate=September 28, 2014 }} May 29, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Writers included [[Alan Moore]], famous for his ''[[V for Vendetta]]'', ''[[From Hell]]'', ''[[Watchmen]]'', ''[[Marvelman]]'', and ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'';&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2092739/ Please, Sir, I Want Some Moore / How Alan Moore transformed American comics], by Douglas Wolk in [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]], December, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neil Gaiman]] with ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'' mythos and ''[[Books of Magic]]''; [[Warren Ellis]], creator of ''[[Transmetropolitan]]'' and ''[[Planetary (comics)|Planetary]]''; and others such as [[Mark Millar]], creator of ''[[Wanted (comics)|Wanted]]'' and ''[[Kick-Ass (comic book)|Kick-Ass]]''.

At Christmas time, publishers repackage and commission material for comic [[Annual publication|annuals]], printed and bound as hardcover [[ISO 216#A series|A4]]-size books; [[Rupert Bear|"Rupert"]] supplies a famous example of the British comic annual. [[DC Thomson]] also repackages ''[[The Broons]]'' and ''[[Oor Wullie]]'' strips in softcover A4-size books for the holiday season.

In [[Italy]], comics (known in Italian as ''fumetti'') made their debut as humor strips at the end of the 19th century, and later evolved into adventure stories. After World War II, however, artists like [[Hugo Pratt]] and [[Guido Crepax]] exposed Italian comics to an international audience. Popular comic books such as ''[[Diabolik]]'' or the ''[[Sergio Bonelli Editore|Bonelli]]'' line—namely ''[[Tex Willer]]'' or ''[[Dylan Dog]]''—remain best-sellers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fumettologica.it/2014/06/quanto-vendono-i-fumetti-bonelli-i-dati-2014/&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainstream comics are usually published on a monthly basis, in a black-and-white [[digest size]] format, with approximately 100 to 132 pages. Collections of classic material for the most famous characters, usually with more than 200 pages, are also common. Author comics are published in the French BD format, with an example being Pratt's ''[[Corto Maltese]]''.

Italian cartoonists show the influence of comics from other countries, including France, Belgium, Spain, and [[Argentina]]. Italy is also famous for being one of the foremost producers of [[Walt Disney]] comic stories outside the U.S. [[Donald Duck]]'s superhero alter ego, [[Paperinik]], known in English as Superduck, was created in Italy.

===Czech comics===

''Čtyřlístek'' (in English translated as Lucky Four or Four-Leaf Clover) is one of the most well-known comics for children published in the Czech Republic.

==Distribution==
Distribution has historically been a problem for the comic book industry with many mainstream retailers declining to carry extensive stocks of the most interesting and popular comics. The [[smartphone]] and the [[tablet computer|tablet]] have turned out to be an ideal medium for online distribution.&lt;ref name=NYT72113&gt;{{cite news|title=Embracing Tablets, Comic Book Publishers Cash In on a Digital Revolution|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/22/business/media/comic-books-cash-in-on-a-digital-revolution.html|accessdate=July 24, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 21, 2013|author=Gregory Schmidt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital distribution===
On November 13, 2007, [[Marvel Comics]] launched [[Marvel Digital Comics Unlimited]], a subscription service allowing readers to read many [[Digital comic|comics]] from Marvel's history online. The service also includes periodic release new comics not available elsewhere. With the release of ''[[Avenging Spider-Man]]'' #1, Marvel also became the first publisher to provide free digital copies as part of the print copy of the comic book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/story/16781/avenging_spider-man_1_makes_digital_history|title=Avenging Spider-Man #1 Makes Digital History|date=12 October 2011|accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the growing popularity of smartphones and tablets, many major publishers have begun releasing titles in digital form. The most popular platform is [[comiXology]]. Some platforms, such as [[Graphicly]], have shut down.

== Comic collections in libraries ==
Many libraries have extensive collections of comics in the form of graphic novels. This is a convenient way for many in the public to become familiar with the medium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccgclibraries.com/integrating-comics-into-your-exhibits-and-collections/|title=» Integrating Comics Into Your Exhibits and Collections|website=ccgclibraries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is named ''[[Monica's Gang|Turma da Mônica — O Maior Gibi do Mundo!]]'' by [[Panini Comics|Panini Comics Brasil]] and [[Mauricio de Sousa|Mauricio de Sousa Editora]], and it measures at 69.9&amp;nbsp;cm by 99.8&amp;nbsp;cm (2&amp;nbsp;ft 3.51 in by 3&amp;nbsp;ft 3.29 in).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-comic-book-published|title=Largest comic book published|newspaper=Guinness World Records|access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese manga author [[Eiichiro Oda]] has made comic book history by attaining a Guinness World Record title for having the "Most copies published for the same comic book series by a single author". His widely popular comic titled [[One Piece]] was first serialised in [[Weekly Shonen Jump]] magazine (Shueisha) in Japan, back in December 1997. In the space of less than two decades, the series has accumulated an incredibly loyal following and has gone on to sell an incredible 320,866,000 units, with a substantial 77 volumes of the comic book released over that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2015/6/japanese-manga-“one-piece”-is-most-printed-comic-series-by-one-author-ever-385868|title=Most copies published for the same comic book series by a single author|newspaper=Guinness World Records|access-date=2015-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was formed in August, 1996, for the purpose developing and standardizing the use and implementation of SPICE models and the model interfaces.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5976">The '''Cybernetic Culture Research Unit''' ('''Ccru''') was a student-run interdisciplinary collective founded in 1995 out of the [[University of Warwick]]'s philosophy department.&lt;ref name="divus.cc"&gt;[http://divus.cc/london/en/article/nick-land-ein-experiment-im-inhumanismus Mackay, Robin. "Nick Land: An Experiment in Inhumanism." ''Divus''. 27 February 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt; It was associated with the work of [[Sadie Plant]] and [[Nick Land]].

==History==
The collective's research was closely tied to the work of philosophers [[Sadie Plant]] (around whom it was founded), [[Nick Land]], and their colleagues throughout the 1990s, and in particular the emerging [[cyberfeminist]] thinking that would lead to the ''Virtual Futures'' conferences at Warwick in the middle of the decade.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Simon Reynolds, '[http://energyflashbysimonreynolds.blogspot.com.au/2009/11/renegade-academia-cybernetic-culture.html Reynolds, Simon. "Renegade Aacdemia"]', unpublished feature for Lingua Franca, 1999. Accessed 27 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, Plant would abandon her academic post and affiliation with the Ccru in 1997, during which time it came under the direction of Land. Under his leadership, the collective became increasingly experimental and unorthodox in its work, with its output (which included writing, performance events, and collaborative art) crossing [[post-structuralism]], [[cybernetics]], [[science-fiction]], [[rave culture]], and [[occult studies]].&lt;ref name="divus.cc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In 2015, a collection of Ccru pieces entitled ''Ccru: Writings 1997-2003'' was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Ccru-Writings-1997-2003-ebook/dp/B00X96VLF0/|title=Ccru: Writings 1997-2003|accessdate= September 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members and affiliates==
Although it only existed in an official capacity for little over two years—following the departure of Plant, the University of Warwick would deny any relationship to the renegade collective—the Ccru's cultural impact has been significant.&lt;ref name="dazeddigital.com"&gt;[http://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/10459/1/nick-land-mind-games Fisher, Mark. "Nick Land: Mind Games." ''Dazed and Confused''.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simon Reynolds, '[http://energyflashbysimonreynolds.blogspot.com.au/2009/11/renegade-academia-cybernetic-culture.html Renegade Aacdemia]', unpublished feature for Lingua Franca, 1999. Accessed 27 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Those who were affiliated with the Ccru during and after its time as part of the University of Warwick Philosophy department include philosophers [[Iain Hamilton Grant]], [[Ray Brassier]] and [[Reza Negarestani]]; cultural theorists [[Mark Fisher (theorist)|Mark Fisher]] and [[Kodwo Eshun]]; publisher and philosopher Robin Mackay; digital media theorists Luciana Parisi and [[Matthew Fuller (author)|Matthew Fuller]]; electronic music artist and [[Hyperdub]] label head Steve Goodman, aka [[Kode9]]; writer and theorist Anna Greenspan; novelist [[Hari Kunzru]]; and artists [[Jake and Dinos Chapman]], among others.&lt;ref name="divus.cc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dazeddigital.com"/&gt; Land and the Ccru collaborated frequently with the experimental art collective 0[rphan&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;d[rift&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; (Maggie Roberts and Ranu Mukherjee),{{r|orphan}} notably on ''Syzygy'', a month-long multidisciplinary residency at Beaconsfield Contemporary Art gallery in South London, 1999, and on 0[rphan]d[rift&gt;]'s ''Cyberpositive'' (London: Cabinet, 1995), a schizoid work of cut-and-paste cyberphilosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orphandriftarchive.com/neofuture/ctm13-berlin.php|title=0rphan Drift :: Neo Future &gt; CTM13 Berlin|website=www.orphandriftarchive.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
The role played by Land, Plant, and the Ccru in the development of what has come to be known as [[accelerationism]] is profound, and its legacy is apparent in contemporary debates concerning the viability of the theory in its various guises.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Mackay and Armen Avanessian, '[http://www.urbanomic.com/Publications/Accelerate/Accelerate-Introduction.pdf Introduction]' to ''#Accelerate: The Accelerationist Reader'', (Falmouth: Urbanomic, 2014) pp.1-46&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that accelerationism as it was deployed by the Ccru should be distinguished from the term more frequently associated with [[Nick Srnicek]] and Alex Williams’ ‘Manifesto for an Accelerationist Politics’.{{r|mani}}&lt;ref&gt;Nick Srnicek &amp; Alex Williams, ‘[http://criticallegalthinking.com/2013/05/14/accelerate-manifesto-for-an-accelerationist-politics/ #Accelerate: Manifesto for an Accelerationist Politics],’ Dark Trajectories: Politics of the Outside, ed. Joshua Johnson (Hong Kong, NAME, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Land himself makes this distinction clear in his commentary on the manifesto.{{r|land}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19672">'''Ecological interface design''' ('''EID''') is an approach to [[user interface|interface]] design that was introduced specifically for complex sociotechnical, real-time, and dynamic systems. It has been applied in a variety of domains including [[process control]] (e.g. [[nuclear power plant]]s, petrochemical plants), [[aviation]], and [[medicine]].

EID differs from some interface design methodologies like [[user-centered design|User-Centered Design (UCD)]] in that the focus of the analysis is on the work domain or environment, rather than on the end user or a specific task. 

The goal of EID is to make constraints and complex relationships in the work environment perceptually evident (e.g. visible, audible) to the user.  This allows more of users' cognitive resources to be devoted to higher [[cognitive process]]es such as problem solving and decision making.  EID is based on two key concepts from [[cognitive engineering]] research: the Abstraction Hierarchy (AH) and the Skills, Rules, Knowledge (SRK) framework.

By reducing mental workload and supporting knowledge-based reasoning, EID aims to improve user performance and overall system reliability for both anticipated and unanticipated events in a complex system.

==Overview==
===Origin and history of EID===
Ecological interface design was proposed as a framework for interface design by [[Kim Vicente]] and [[Jens Rasmussen (human factors expert)|Jens Rasmussen]] in the late 80s and early 90s following extensive research into [[human reliability|human-system reliability]] at the [[Risø National Laboratory]] in Denmark (Rasmussen &amp; Vicente ''et al'', 1989; Vicente, 2001). The term ecological in EID originates from a school of psychology developed by [[J. J. Gibson|James J. Gibson]] known as [[ecological psychology]]. This field of psychology focuses on human-environment relationships, in particular in relation to human perception in actual environments rather than in laboratory environments. EID borrows from ecological psychology in that the constraints and relationships of the work environment in a complex system are reflected perceptually (through an interface) in order to shape user behaviour. In order to develop ecological designs, analytical tools developed earlier by researchers at the Risø National Laboratory were adopted, including the Abstraction Hierarchy (AH) and the Skills, Rules, Knowledge (SRK) framework. The EID framework was first applied and evaluated in nuclear power plant systems (Vicente &amp; Rasmussen, 1990, 1992). These tools are also used in [[Cognitive work analysis]]. To date, EID has been applied in a variety of complex systems including computer network management, anaesthesiology, military command and control, and aircraft (Vicente, 2002; Burns &amp; Hajdukiewicz, 2004).

===Motivation===
Rapid advances in technologies along with economic demands have led to a noticeable increase in the complexity of engineering systems (Vicente, 1999a). As a result, it is becoming more and more difficult for designers to anticipate events that may occur within such systems. Unanticipated events by definition cannot be specified in advance and thus cannot be prevented through training, procedures, or automation. A complex sociotechnical system designed based solely on known scenarios frequently loses the flexibility to support unforeseen events. System safety is often compromised by the operators’ inability to adapt to new and unfamiliar situations (Vicente &amp; Rasmussen, 1992). Ecological interface design attempts to provide the operators with the necessary tools and information to become active problem solvers as opposed to passive monitors, particularly during the development of unforeseen events. Interfaces designed following the EID framework aim to lessen [[mental workload]] when dealing with unfamiliar and unanticipated events, which are attributed to increased psychological pressure (Vicente, 1999b). In doing so, cognitive resources may be freed up to support efficient problem solving.

In addition to providing operators with the means to successfully manage unanticipated events, EID is also proposed for systems that require users to become experts (Burns &amp; Hajdukiewicz, 2004). Through the use of the Abstraction Hierarchy (AH) and the Skills, Rules, Knowledge (SRK) framework, EID enables novice users to more easily acquire advanced [[mental model]]s that generally take many years of experience and training to develop. Likewise, EID provides a basis for continuous learning and distributed, collaborative work (Vicente, 1999b). When faced with complex sociotechnical systems, it is not always possible for designers to ask operators what kinds of information they would like to see since each person understands the system at a different level (but rarely fully) and will provide very different answers. The EID framework allows designers to determine what kinds of information are required when it is not possible or feasible to ask users (Burns &amp; Hajdukiewicz, 2004). It is not the intention of EID to replace existing design methodologies such as UCD and [[task analysis]], but to complement them.

==UCD and EID: Why use EID at all?==

As we can see from today’s windows based interfaces User-Centered Design (UCD) has done an excellent job of identifying user preferences and limitations and incorporating them into the interfaces. In the pre-UCD era, interface design was almost an afterthought to a program and was completely dependent on the programmers while totally neglecting the end user. 

===Benefits of UCD===
UCD adds three key ideas:

1.	That Interface Design is a field on its own because it bridges between humans and the program/environment.

2.	That an understanding of human perception, cognition, and behavior is critical to designing interfaces.

3.	That much can be learned by getting feedback from the actual users of the interface, at the early design stages, and then testing through various points in the design (Burns &amp; Hajdukiewicz, 2004)

But there are some problems in this approach as well. 

===How is EID relevant?===
The UCD approach commonly focuses on single user interactions between the user and the interface which is not enough to deal with today’s increasingly complex systems where centralized control of information is needed and it is displayed on a variety of interfaces in varying detail. EID is a preferable addition to the complex systems’ design process when even very experienced users do not have a complete understanding of how the entire complex system (power plant, nuclear plant, petrochemical refinery etc.) works. It is a known fact{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} that users don’t always understand or even feel the need to understand all the relationships behind the complex processes that they control via their interfaces. 

Furthermore, the users are not always aware of the constraints that affect the system that they work with, and discovering these constraints can take some extra effort (Burns &amp; Hajdukiewicz, 2004). EID incorporates this constraint based style in the design approach where it examines the constraints of the user domain before getting user input. EID focuses on understanding the complex system – its build, its architecture, and its original intent and then relaying this information to the end user thereby reducing their learning curve and helping them achieve higher level of expertise.  

The constraint based style in interface design also facilitates the handling of unanticipated events because, regardless of the event, the constraint is broken and it can be seen by the user who in turn can proactively work with the interface to restore the constraint and fix the system. 

This does not in any way take away the usefulness of UCD but stresses the fact that EID offers some unique insight into the design process and it could be used in conjunction with other cognitive engineering techniques to enhance the user interfaces and increase human reliability in human-machine interactions.

==The abstraction hierarchy (AH)==
The abstraction hierarchy (AH) is a 5-level functional decomposition used for modelling the work environment, or more commonly referred to as the work domain, for complex sociotechnical systems (Rasmussen, 1985). In the EID framework, the AH is used to determine what kinds of information should be displayed on the system interface and how the information should be arranged. The AH describes a system at different levels of abstraction using how and why relationships. Moving down the model levels answers how certain elements in the system are achieved, whereas moving up reveals why certain elements exist. Elements at highest level of the model define the purposes and goals of the system. Elements at the lowest levels of the model indicate and describe the physical components (i.e. equipment) of the system. The how and why relationships are shown on the AH as means-ends links. An AH is typically developed following a systematic approach known as a [[Work domain analysis|Work Domain Analysis]] (Vicente, 1999a). It is not uncommon for a Work Domain Analysis to yield multiple AH models; each examining the system at a different level of physical detail defined using another model called the Part-Whole Hierarchy (Burns &amp; Hajdukiewicz, 2004).

Each level in the AH is a complete but unique description of the work domain.

===Functional purpose===
The functional purpose (FP) level describes the goals and purposes of the system. An AH typically includes more than one system goal such that the goals conflict or complement each other (Burns &amp; Hajdukiewicz, 2004). The relationships between the goals indicate potential trade-offs and constraints within the work domain of the system. For example, the goals of a [[refrigerator]] might be to cool food to a certain temperature while using a minimal amount of electricity.

===Abstract function===
The abstract function (AF) level describes the underlying laws and principles that govern the goals of the system. These may be [[law (principle)|empirical laws]] in a physical system, [[law|judicial laws]] in a social system, or even [[economics|economic principles]] in a commercial system. In general, the laws and principles focus on things that need to be conserved or that flow through the system such as mass (Burns &amp; Hajdukiewicz, 2004). The operation of the refrigerator (as a [[heat pump]]) is governed by the [[second law of thermodynamics]].

===Generalised function===
The generalised function (GF) level explains the processes involved in the laws and principles found at the AF level, i.e. how each abstract function is achieved. Causal relationships exist between the elements found at the GF level. The [[refrigeration cycle]] in a refrigerator involves pumping heat from an area of low temperature (source) into an area of higher temperature (sink).

===Physical function===
The physical function (PFn) level reveals the physical components or equipment associated with the processes identified at the GF level. The capabilities and limitations of the components such as maximum capacity are also usually noted in the AH (Burns &amp; Hajdukiewicz, 2004). A refrigerator may consist of heat exchange pipes and a [[gas compressor]] that can exert a certain maximum pressure on the cooling medium.

===Physical form===
The physical form (PFo) level describes the condition, location, and physical appearance of the components shown at the PFn level. In the refrigerator example, the heat exchange pipes and the gas compressor are arranged in a specific manner, basically illustrating the location of the components. Physical characteristics may include things as colour, dimensions, and shape.

==Causal Abstraction Hierarchy==

The hierarchy described before is a ''functional'' Abstraction Hierarchy representation. A ''functional'' Abstraction Hierarchy emphasizes the "means-ends" or "how/why" links of the hierarchy. These connections are direct and illustrated across the five levels of the Abstraction Hierarchy. 

As the systems get more and more complex, we need to follow the flow structure as well as to understand how the system works. This is when a ''causal'' Abstraction Hierarchy representation becomes necessary. As the flow patterns become increasingly complex and it becomes increasingly difficult to derive the flows directly from the system diagram, we add causal models to the functional models.

The causal models help to detail the flow structure and understand more complex flow patterns within a specified Abstraction Hierarchy level. A ''causal'' Abstraction Hierarchy representation has the same structure as a ''functional'' Abstraction Hierarchy representation but with causal links drawn. Causal links are also known as "within the level" links. These links show how the processes and flows are connected within each level. 

The two representations are closely related but are usually developed separately because doing so results in a clearer model which captures most of the system constraints. 

In very elaborate flow systems causal models can be used to simplify or abstract the flows. In such a scenario we may find it easier to identify the main feed and product lines at first, then control lines, emergency supply lines, or emergency shunting lines (Burns &amp; Hajdukiewicz, 2004). Causal links are most useful at the Generalized Function and the Abstract Function levels which show flows of materials, processes, mass, or energy.

==The Skills, Rules, Knowledge (SRK) framework==
The Skills, Rules, Knowledge (SRK) framework or SRK taxonomy defines three types of behaviour or psychological processes present in operator information processing (Vicente, 1999a). The SRK framework was developed by [[Jens Rasmussen (human factors expert)|Rasmussen]] (1983) to help designers combine information requirements for a system and aspects of human cognition. In EID, the SRK framework is used to determine how information should be displayed to take advantage of human perception and psychomotor abilities (Vicente, 1999b). By supporting skill- and rule-based behaviours in familiar tasks, more cognitive resources may be devoted to knowledge-based behaviours, which are important for managing unanticipated events. The three categories essentially describe the possible ways in which information, for example, from a human-machine interface is extracted and understood:

===Skill-based level===
A skill-based behaviour represents a type of behaviour that requires very little or no conscious control to perform or execute an action once an intention is formed; also known as a [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development|sensorimotor behaviour]]. Performance is smooth, automated, and consists of highly integrated patterns of behaviour in most skill-based control (Rasmussen, 1990). For example, bicycle riding is considered a skill-based behaviour in which very little attention is required for control once the skill is acquired. This [[automaticity]] allows operators to free up cognitive resources, which can then be used for higher cognitive functions like problem solving (Wickens &amp; Hollands, 2000).

===Rule-based level===
A rule-based behaviour is characterised by the use of rules and procedures to select a course of action in a familiar work situation (Rasmussen, 1990). The rules can be a set of instructions acquired by the operator through experience or given by supervisors and former operators.

Operators are not required to know the underlying principles of a system, to perform a rule-based control. For example, hospitals have highly-proceduralised instructions for fire emergencies. Therefore, when one sees a fire, one can follow the necessary steps to ensure the safety of the patients without any knowledge of fire behaviour.

===Knowledge-based level===
A knowledge-based behaviour represents a more advanced level of reasoning (Wirstad, 1988). This type of control must be employed when the situation is novel and unexpected. Operators are required to know the fundamental principles and laws by which the system is governed. Since operators need to form explicit goals based on their current analysis of the system, cognitive workload is typically greater than when using skill- or rule-based behaviours.

The '''Elgin Center''' is a non-profit  research center which specializes in [[zoosemiotics]], or animal communication. The Elgin Center carries out research in the wild (in Nicaragua at The [[Maderas rainforest conservancy]][http://www.maderasrfc.org], in a lab (where the center performs anatomical studies on animal brains with regard to language areas, and in a semi-free ranging environment (primarily at [[Lion Country Safari]] in Loxahatchee, Florida in the [[United States]]). 

A primary focus of the center has been research on the vocalizations of Lion Country Safari's  [[chimpanzees]].

== Group-specific vocalizations and vocal evolution in chimpanzees ==
One of the first findings at the center concerned chimpanzee vocalizations. Chimpanzees have been found to have group-specific vocalizations (the structure of chimpanzee calls vary from group to group). This gives evidence that chimpanzee calls are learned rather than genetically inherited. At Lion Country Safari, the largest chimpanzee group was separated in 2004, with seven of the group going to the [[Lincoln Park Zoo]] in [[Chicago]]. Two years later, the vocalizations were analyzed and it was determined that the way they were vocalizing was slightly different from their original group - giving evidence that chimpanzee vocalization evolve in much the same way human [[dialects]] do. This provides a direct link between chimpanzee vocal communication and human language.[http://www.physanth.org/annmeet/aapa2007/aapa2007abstracts.pdf]

== Chimpanzee cognition ==
The center has also performed cognitive studies with the Lion Country Safari chimpanzees. These studies have included the ability of chimpanzees to understand certain mathematical properties (number conservation, fractions, quantity comparisons from memory, etc.), the ability of chimpanzees to discern binary oppositions, and the ability of chimpanzees to understand 2-dimensional photographs as representations of real life. These studies are done in an effort to determine if there is a cognitive structure inherent in the chimpanzee mind which would be conducive to a grammatical ability.

== Alarm calls in wild capuchin monkeys ==
The center also studies the alarm calls of wild Capuchin monkeys in Ometepe, Nicaragua. Capuchin monkeys produce alarm call relative to the predator &lt;ref&gt;Digweed, S. M., Fedigan, L. M., &amp; Rendall, D. (2005). Variable specificity in the anti-predator vocalizations and behaviour of the white-faced capuchin, Cebus capucinus. Behaviour, 142: 997– 1021&lt;/ref&gt; Previous surveys show two distinct families of alarm calls - those dealing with terrestrial predators and those dealing with aerial predators. Alarm calls focused on human threats fall into the aerial category.&lt;ref&gt;Gros-Louis, J.J., Perry, S.E., Fichtel, C., Wikberg, E., Gilkenson, H.,  Wofsy, S,. Fuentes, A. (2008). Vocal Repertoire of Cebus capucinus: Acoustic Structure, Context, and Usage. Int J Primatology,  29: 3: 641-670&lt;/ref&gt; A sample of over 1500 alarm call vocalizations from a group of previously unstudied wild Capuchin monkeys were recorded on Ometepe island in Nicaragua during the summer of 2008. The calls were analyzed for spectral peak frequencies and onset 
durations and compared with previously published data of Capuchin alarm calls. The results reveal no significant difference between the terrestrial alarm calls analyzed in the published accounts and the human predator calls recorded in Nicaragua. The results also show a significant difference between the human predator alarm calls in Nicaragua and the aerial alarm calls in the published data. This suggests a geographic variation in the genetic based alarm calls of Capuchin monkeys.

'''Emergent literacy''' is a term that is used to explain a child's knowledge of reading and writing skills before they learn how to read and write words.&lt;ref name="provolibrary1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Emergent Literacy|url=http://www.provolibrary.com/emergent-literacy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405193056/http://www2.provolibrary.com/emergent-literacy|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-04-05|work=Provo City Library at Academy Square|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It signals a belief that, in literate society, young children—even one- and two-year-olds—are in the process of becoming literate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Learning Point Associates - Emergent Literacy|url=http://www.ncrel.org/sdrs/areas/issues/content/cntareas/reading/li1lk1.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000831010615/http://www.ncrel.org/sdrs/areas/issues/content/cntareas/reading/li1lk1.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2000-08-31|work=Emergent Literacy|publisher=North Central Regional Educational Laboratory|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through the support of parents, caregivers, and educators, a child can successfully progress from emergent to conventional reading.&lt;ref name="ncrel1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Learning Point Associates - Critical Issue: Addressing the Literacy Needs of Emergent and Early Readers|url=http://www.ncrel.org/sdrs/areas/issues/content/cntareas/reading/li100.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000817063554/http://www.ncrel.org/sdrs/areas/issues/content/cntareas/reading/li100.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2000-08-17|work=Emergent Literacy|publisher=North Central Regional Educational Laboratory|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic components of emergent literacy include:

* '''Print motivation''': Being interested in and enjoying books.
* '''[[Vocabulary]]''': Knowing the names of things.
* '''Print awareness''': Noticing print, knowing how to handle a book, and knowing how to follow words on a page.
* '''Narrative skills''': Being able to describe things and events and to tell stories.
* '''Letter knowledge''': Understanding letters are different from each other, knowing their names and sounds, and recognizing letters everywhere.
* '''[[Phonological awareness]]''': Being able to hear and play with the smaller sounds in words.&lt;ref name="provolibrary1"/&gt;

Emergent literacy is of critical importance in early education in light of research showing that children learn skills that prepare them to read years before they start school.&lt;ref name="provolibrary1"/&gt;

==History==
Traditionally, society has considered reading and writing in their formalistic senses, and viewed children as being knowledgeable about literacy only when they were capable of identifying written words without picture clues, and spelling words that adults could read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Emergent Literacy|url=http://www.lcsc.edu/RE303/what_is_emergent_literacy.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041026153623/http://www.lcsc.edu/re303/what_is_emergent_literacy.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2004-10-26|work=Academics|publisher=Lews-Clark State College|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, New Zealand researcher [[Marie Clay]] introduced the concept of emergent reading, using it to describe the earliest behaviors and concepts young children employ in interacting with [[book]]s even before they are capable of reading in the conventional sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clay|first=Marie|title=Reading: The Patterning of Complex Behaviour|year=1967|publisher=Heinemann Educational|location=Auckland, New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1970s and early 1980s saw robust research activity in children's early language development, early childhood education, and reexamination of the concept of reading readiness. This work resulted in Teale and Sulzby assembling a book authored by various leading researchers of the time that proposed reconceptualizing what happens from birth to the time when children reading and write conventionally as a period of emergent literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Teale|first=William H. |last2=Sulzby|first2=Elizabeth|title=Emergent Literacy: Writing and Reading|year=1986|publisher=Ablex|location=Norwood, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, an extensive body of research has expanded the concept, illuminating that a child's literacy development begins well before formal introduction in school, and can be influenced by social interactions with adults, exposure to literacy materials, and the use of engaged learning activities.&lt;ref name="ncrel1"/&gt;
While the concept of reading readiness suggested that there was a point in time when children were ready to learn to read and write, Clay's notion of emergent literacy suggested that there were continuities in children's literacy development between early literacy behaviors and those displayed once children could read independently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is emergent literacy?|url=http://www.ets.uidaho.edu/cdhd/emerlit/intro.htm|publisher=Idaho Center on Developmental Disabilities.|accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clay also emphasized the importance of the relationship between writing and reading in early literacy development. Until then, it was believed that children must learn to read before they could learn to write.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clay|first=Marie|title=What Did I Write?|year=1975|publisher=Heinemann Educational|location=Auckland, New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emergent literacy skills ==

=== Print motivation ===
This component relates to a child's interest in and enjoyment of books.&lt;ref name="provolibrary1"/&gt; A child with print motivation might enjoy being read to, playing with books, pretending to write, and going to the library.&lt;ref name="loudoun1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.loudoun.gov/Default.aspx?tabid=67 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140403044046/http://library.loudoun.gov/Default.aspx?tabid=67 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-04-03 |title=?? |publisher=Library.loudoun.gov |accessdate=2015-04-24 |registration=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Children who enjoy books are more likely to want to read, and to keep trying, even when it is hard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Print Motivation|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/28476215/Print-Motivation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100521001712/http://www.scribd.com/doc/28476215/Print-Motivation|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-05-21|work=Scribd.com|accessdate=2015-04-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vocabulary ===
The component "[[vocabulary]]" relates to the knowing of the names of things.&lt;ref name="provolibrary1"/&gt;  Children with rich vocabularies are at a tremendous educational advantage, since studies show that vocabulary is the best predictor of reading comprehension at the end of second and third grades and is otherwise linked to overall academic achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shoot for the SSTaRS Strategy|url=http://www.hanen.org/Helpful-Info/Articles-%281%29/Shoot-for-the-SSTaRS-Strategy.aspx|work=The Hanen Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Print awareness ===
This component relates to noticing print, knowing how to handle a book, and knowing how to follow words on a page.&lt;ref name="provolibrary1"/&gt;  It includes knowing that books are organized from left to right, the words are read from left to right and top to bottom, and how to tell words from letters.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Emergent Literacy: Concepts about Print|url=http://mason.gmu.edu/~cwallac7/TAP/TEST/literacy/1.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104163220/http://mason.gmu.edu/~cwallac7/TAP/TEST/literacy/1.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-11-04|work=George Mason University|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These skills are invaluable to a child's literacy development because without these skills, a child will have difficulty learning how to read and write.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

=== Narrative skills ===
This component relates to the ability to describe things and events and to tell stories.&lt;ref name="provolibrary1"/&gt;

=== Letter knowledge ===
This component relates to the understanding that letters are different from each other, knowing their names and sounds, and recognizing letters everywhere.&lt;ref name="provolibrary1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mason.gmu.edu/~cwallac7/TAP/TEST/literacy/3.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117004246/http://mason.gmu.edu/~cwallac7/TAP/TEST/literacy/3.html |date=November 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phonological awareness ===
This component relates to being able to hear and play with the smaller sounds in words.&lt;ref name="provolibrary1"/&gt;
It involves rhyme recognition, syllables, onset, and rime. Types of [[phonological awareness]] include: phonemic awareness, syllable awareness, word awareness, and sentence awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fouts|first=Lauren|title=Emergent Literacies: Phonological Awareness|url=http://mason.gmu.edu/~cwallac7/TAP/TEST/literacy/2.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104163225/http://mason.gmu.edu/~cwallac7/TAP/TEST/literacy/2.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=4 November 2007|publisher=George Mason University|accessdate=18 April 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lessons and activities ==
Emergent literacy lessons may focus on one emergent literacy skill or blend them. Below are examples of emerging literacy games and activities that each focus primarily on one emergent literacy skill.

'''Building vocabulary'''&lt;br /&gt;
Sorting games can help children build vocabulary skills by asking them to identify defining characteristics of the items being sorted. Special Connections, a teaching resource website provided by Kansas University, suggests a shoe sorting game in which each child takes off one of his or her shoes. The children work together to sort the shoes by different characteristics, thus building vocabulary related to color, types of fasteners (buckle, velcro), shoe type (sandal, gym shoe), etc. This activity could work with other objects such as legos and pasta. The full activity is available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.specialconnections.ku.edu/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/specconn/main.php?cat=instruction&amp;section=main&amp;subsection=ra/shoe |accessdate=April 17, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903012942/http://www.specialconnections.ku.edu/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/specconn/main.php?cat=instruction&amp;section=main&amp;subsection=ra%2Fshoe |archivedate=September 3, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Hanen Centre outlines another strategy for teaching vocabulary to promote emergent literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weitzman|first=Elaine|title=Shoot for the SSTaRS: A Strategy for Teaching Vocabulary to Promote Emergent Literacy|url=http://www.hanen.org/Helpful-Info/Articles-%281%29/Shoot-for-the-SSTaRS-Strategy.aspx|publisher=The Hanen Centre|accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Letter recognition'''&lt;br /&gt;
Letter recognition games help children learn the letters of the alphabet. In one simple game, the teacher writes each letter of the alphabet on a separate notecard and passes them out to students. The students then have to arrange themselves in alphabetical order. This game is provided by Special Connections, a teaching resource website provided by the University of Kansas, and is available online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.specialconnections.ku.edu/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/specconn/main.php?cat=instruction&amp;section=main&amp;subsection=ra/abc]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903012957/http://www.specialconnections.ku.edu/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/specconn/main.php?cat=instruction&amp;section=main&amp;subsection=ra%2Fabc |date=September 3, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phonological awareness'''&lt;br /&gt;
One type of phonological awareness game involves rhyming, which helps children identify similar sounds in words.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.specialconnections.ku.edu/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/specconn/main.php?cat=instruction&amp;section=main&amp;subsection=ra/emergent#Q1]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100701033553/http://www.specialconnections.ku.edu/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/specconn/main.php?cat=instruction&amp;section=main&amp;subsection=ra%2Femergent |date=July 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In one rhyming game, the teacher can present three different "consonant-vowel-consonant" words and ask children which word does not rhyme. For example, cat, log, and dog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phonologicalawareness.org/4.html |title=Phonological Awareness |publisher=Phonologicalawareness.org |date= |accessdate=2015-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full activity and other similar rhyming activities are available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phonologicalawareness.org/4.html |title=Phonological Awareness |publisher=Phonological Awareness |date= |accessdate=2015-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other activities include: songs and chants; word play, games, rhymes and riddles; Storybooks, poetry, nursery rhymes, Dr. Seuss;
Oral Storytelling; Clapping, jumping, manipulating letters, blocks.
Everything should be playful, engaging, interactive, social, deliberate, and purposeful, stimulate curiosity, and encourage experimentation with language and comprehensive language and literacy programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fouts|first=Lauren|title=Emergent Literacy Phonological Awareness|url=http://mason.gmu.edu/~cwallac7/TAP/TEST/literacy/2.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104163225/http://mason.gmu.edu/~cwallac7/TAP/TEST/literacy/2.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=4 November 2007|publisher=George Mason University|accessdate=18 April 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Print motivation'''&lt;br /&gt;
Since print motivation involves a child's interest and enjoyment of books, there are a variety of activities that parents and teachers can share with children to help promote print motivation. Examples include:
* Read often and make it enjoyable
* Read when you{{Who|date=May 2012}} and the child are in a good mood, so the experience is a positive one
* Change your voice when you read aloud
* Keep books accessible to children
* Stop reading when a child becomes tired or loses interest

Print motivation tips adapted from the Loudon County Public Library.&lt;ref name="loudoun1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.loudoun.gov/Default.aspx?tabid=67|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140403044046/http://library.loudoun.gov/Default.aspx?tabid=67|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2014-04-03|title=??|publisher=Library.loudoun.gov|accessdate=2015-04-24|registration=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Print awareness'''&lt;br /&gt;
Print awareness is a child's understanding of the parts of a book and how a book works. The State Library of Louisiana suggests an activity in which a child shares the parts of a book with an adult. For example, the teacher or parent could ask the child to point out different parts of the book and its contents, such as the front cover; the title; the first line of the book; a word; a letter; and the back cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.lib.la.us/empowerlibrary/Print%20Awareness%20Activities.pdf |format=PDF |title=Print Awareness Activities |publisher=State.lib.la.us |accessdate=2015-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
George Mason University suggests additional family activities. These include: Make a book with your children. You might include familiar photographs with labels under each photo, or children might illustrate the book by themselves. Parents could write the words as the children dictate the story. Or, when going out to a restaurant, show the menu to your children and point to the words as you read to them.  Let them choose what they want to eat and make it an interactive experience. This will help children understand how print is connected to real life. Additional activities can be found online.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Iantosca|first=Elena|title=Emergent Literacy Concepts About Print|url=http://mason.gmu.edu/~cwallac7/TAP/TEST/literacy/1.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104163220/http://mason.gmu.edu/~cwallac7/TAP/TEST/literacy/1.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=4 November 2007|publisher=George Mason University|accessdate=18 April 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Narrative skills'''&lt;br /&gt;
Children can build narrative skills by describing something that happened to him or her, even something as simple as taking a bath. Parents and teachers can promote narrative skills by prompting children for further detail. Other activities to promote narrative skills in both babies and toddlers are available from the Loudon County Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.loudoun.gov/Default.aspx?tabid=69|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120709163509/http://library.loudoun.gov/Default.aspx?tabid=69|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-07-09|title=?? |publisher=Library.loudoun.gov |accessdate=2015-04-24 |registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cholera bacteria SEM.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Scanning electron microscope]] image of ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]''. This is the bacterium that causes [[cholera]].]]

The '''germ theory of disease''' is the currently accepted [[scientific theory]] of disease. It states that many [[disease]]s are caused by [[microorganism]]s. These small organisms, too small to see without magnification, invade humans, animals, and other living hosts. Their growth and reproduction within their hosts can cause a disease. "Germ" may refer to not just a [[bacterium]] but to any type of microorganism, especially one which causes disease, such as [[protists]], [[fungi]], [[viruses]], [[prions]], or [[viroids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/germ|title=germ – definition of germ in English from the Oxford dictionary|work=oxforddictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microorganisms that cause disease are called [[pathogen]]s, and the diseases they cause are called [[infectious disease]]s. Even when a pathogen is the principal cause of a disease, environmental and hereditary factors often influence the severity of the disease, and whether a potential host individual becomes infected when exposed to the pathogen.

The germ theory was proposed by [[Girolamo Fracastoro]] in 1546, and expanded upon by [[Marcus von Plenciz]] in 1762. Such views were held in disdain, however, and [[Galen|Galen's]] [[miasma theory]] remained dominant among scientists and doctors. The nature of this doctrine prevented them from understanding how diseases actually progressed, with predictable consequences. By the early nineteenth century, [[smallpox vaccination]] was commonplace in Europe, though doctors were unaware of how it worked or how to extend the principle to other diseases. Similar treatments had been prevalent in India from just before AD 1000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7294/|last1=Henderson|first1=Donald A|last2=Moss|first2=Bernard|title=Smallpox and Vaccinia, Vaccines|year=1999|publisher=W. B. Saunders Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{#tag:ref| In a 1767 report to the College of Physicians in London, John Zephaniah Holwell mentions the practice of Smallpox vaccinations by Ayurvedic doctors and their explanations of the cause of the disease.|group=N}} A transitional period began in the late 1850s with the work of [[Louis Pasteur]].  This work was later extended by [[Robert Koch]] in the 1880s. By the end of the 1880s the miasma theory was struggling to compete with the germ theory of disease. Eventually, a "golden era" of [[bacteriology]] ensued, during which the theory quickly led to the identification of the actual organisms that cause many diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/1859map/cholera_prevailingtheories_a2.html|title=BRIEF HISTORY DURING THE SNOW ERA|work=ucla.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/3035/Germ-Theory.html|title=Germ Theory|work=jrank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Viruses were discovered in the 1890s.

== Miasma theory ==
[[File:Cholera art.jpg|thumb|A representation by [[Robert Seymour (illustrator)|Robert Seymour]] of the cholera epidemic depicts the spread of the disease in the form of poisonous air.]]
{{Main article|Miasma theory}}

The miasma theory was the predominant theory of disease transmission before the germ theory took hold towards the end of the 19th century. It held that diseases such as [[cholera]], [[chlamydia infection]], or the [[Black Death]] were caused by a ''[[Miasma theory|miasma]]'' (μίασμα, [[Ancient Greek]]: "pollution"), a noxious form of "bad air" emanating from rotting organic matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution="miasma theory" |title=A Dictionary of Public Health |editor=John M. Last |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2007 |location=Westminster College, Pennsylvania |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t235.e2851}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miasma was considered to be a poisonous vapor or mist filled with particles from decomposed matter (miasmata) that was identifiable by its foul smell. The theory posited that diseases were the product of environmental factors such as contaminated water, foul air, and poor hygienic conditions. Such infections, according to the theory, were not passed between individuals but would affect those within a locale that gave rise to such vapors.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

== Development ==

=== Pre-19th century ===

In [[Age of the Earth|Antiquity]], the Greek historian [[Thucydides]] (c. 460 – c. 400 BC) was the first person to state, in his account of the [[plague of Athens]], that diseases could spread from an infected person to others.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, Charles and Dorothea (1917) "The scientific position of Girolamo Fracastoro [1478?–1553] with especial reference to the source, character and influence of his theory of infection," ''Annals of Medical History'', '''1''' :  1–34 ; [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015016778261;view=1up;seq=28 see p. 14.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides with Richard Crawley, trans., ''History of the Peloponnesian War'' (London, England:  J.M. Dent &amp; Sons, Ltd., 1910), Book III, § 51, [https://archive.org/stream/pelocrawleyr00thucuoft#page/130/mode/2up pp. 131–132.]  From pp. 131–132:  " … there was the awful spectacle of men dying like sheep, through having caught the infection in nursing each other.  This caused the greatest mortality.  On the one hand, if they were afraid to visit each other, they perished from neglect; indeed many houses were emptied of their inmates for want of a nurse: on the other, if they ventured to do so, death was the consequence."&lt;/ref&gt;  One theory of the spread of contagious diseases that were not spread by direct contact was that they were spread by "seeds" (Latin:  ''semina'') that were present in the air.  In his poem, ''De rerum natura'' (On the Nature of Things, ca. 56 BC), the Roman poet [[Lucretius]] (ca. 99 BC – ca. 55 BC) stated that the world contained various "seeds", some of which could sicken a person if they were inhaled or if they contaminated his food.&lt;ref&gt;Nutton, Vivian (1983) "The seeds of disease: an explanation of contagion and infection from the Greeks to the Renaissance," ''Medical History'', '''27''' (1) :  1–34 ; see p. 10. Available at:  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1139262/?page=23 U.S. National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lucretius with Rev. John S. Watson, trans., ''On the Nature of Things'' (London, England:  Henry G. Bohn, 1851), Book VI, lines 1093–1130, pp. 291–292 ; [https://archive.org/stream/onnaturethingsd00carugoog#page/n320/mode/2up see especially p. 292.]  From p. 292:  "This new malady and pest, therefore, either suddenly falls into the water, or penetrates into the very corn, or into other food of men and cattle.  Or even, as may be the case, the infection remains suspended in the air itself; and when, as we breathe, we inhale the air mingled with it, we must necessarily absorb those ''seeds of disease'' into our body."&lt;/ref&gt;  The Roman statesman [[Marcus Terentius Varro]] (116–27 BC) wrote, in his ''Rerum rusticarum libri III'' (Three Books on Agriculture, 36 BC): "Precautions must also be taken in the neighborhood of swamps […] because there are bred certain minute creatures which cannot be seen by the eyes, which float in the air and enter the body through the mouth and nose and there cause serious diseases."&lt;ref&gt;Varro, Marcus Terentius with Lloyd Storr-Best, trans., ''Varro On Farming'' (London, England:  G. Bell and Sons, Ltd., 1912), Book 1, Ch. XII, [https://archive.org/stream/onfarmingmterent00varruoft#page/38/mode/2up/search/diseases p. 39.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Greek physician Galen (AD 129 – ca. 200/ca. 216) speculated in his ''On Initial Causes'' (ca. AD 175) that some patients might have "seeds of fever".&lt;ref&gt;Nutton (1983), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;  In his ''On the Different Types of Fever'' (ca. AD 175), Galen speculated that plagues were spread by "certain seeds of plague", which were present in the air.&lt;ref&gt;Nutton (1983), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;  And in his ''Epidemics'' (ca. AD 176–178), Galen explained that patients might relapse during recovery from a fever because some "seed of the disease" lurked in their bodies, which would cause a recurrence of the disease if the patients didn't follow a physician's therapeutic regimen.&lt;ref&gt;Nutton (1983), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Middle Ages, [[Isidore of Seville]] (ca. 560 – 636) mentioned "plague-bearing seeds" (''pestifera semina'') in his ''On the Nature of Things'' (ca. AD 613).&lt;ref&gt;Nutton (1983), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;  Later in 1345, [[Tommaso del Garbo]] (ca. 1305–1370) of Bologna, Italy mentioned Galen's "seeds of plague" in his work ''Commentaria non parum utilia in libros Galeni'' (Helpful commentaries on the books of Galen).&lt;ref&gt;Nutton (1983), p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian scholar and physician Girolamo Fracastoro proposed in 1546 in his book ''De Contagione et Contagiosis Morbis'' that epidemic diseases are caused by transferable seed-like entities (''seminaria morbi'') that transmit infection by direct or indirect contact, or even without contact over long distances. The diseases were categorised based on how they were transmitted, and how long they could lie dormant.

Italian physician [[Francesco Redi]] provided early evidence against [[spontaneous generation]]. He devised an experiment in 1668 in which he used three jars. He placed a [[meatloaf]] and egg in each of the three jars. He had one of the jars open, another one tightly sealed, and the last one covered with gauze. After a few days, he observed that the meatloaf in the open jar was covered by maggots, and the jar covered with gauze had maggots on the surface of the gauze. However, the tightly sealed jar had no maggots inside or outside it. He also noticed that the maggots were found only on surfaces that were accessible by flies. From this he concluded that spontaneous generation is not a plausible theory.

Microorganisms are said to have been first directly observed in the 1670s by [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]], an early pioneer in [[microbiology]]. Yet [[Athanasius Kircher]] may have done so prior. When Rome was struck by the bubonic plague in 1656, Kircher spent days on end caring for the sick. Searching for a cure, Kircher observed microorganisms under the microscope and invented the germ theory of disease, which he outlined in his ''Scrutinium pestis physico-medicum'' (Rome 1658).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mjt.org/exhibits/kircher.html|title=The Life and Work of Athanaseus Kircher, S.J.|work=mjt.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Building on Leeuwenhoek's work, physician [[Nicolas Andry]] argued in 1700 that microorganisms he called "worms" were responsible for [[smallpox]] and other diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The History of the Germ Theory|journal=The British Medical Journal|volume= 1 |year=1888|page=312 |issue= 1415 | url = https://archive.org/stream/britishmedicaljo11888brit#page/312/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1720, [[Richard Bradley (botanist)|Richard Bradley]] theorised that the plague and 'all pestilential distempers' were caused by 'poisonous insects', living creatures viewable only with the help of microscopes.&lt;ref name=Santer&gt;Melvin Santer, ‘Richard Bradley: A Unified, Living Agent Theory of the Cause of Infectious Diseases of Plants, Animals, and Humans in the First Decades of the 18th Century’, in Perspectives in Biology and Medicine, Volume 52, Number 4, Autumn, 2009, pp. 566-578&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1762, the Austrian physician Marcus Antonius von Plenciz (1705-1786) published a book titled ''Opera medico-physica''. It outlined a theory of contagion stating that specific 'animalculae' in the soil and the air were responsible for causing specific diseases. Von Plenciz noted the distinction between diseases which are both epidemic and contagious (like measles and dysentry), and diseases which are contagious but not epidemic (like rabies and leprosy).&lt;ref&gt;Winslow, Charles-Edward Amory (1967). Conquest of Epidemic Disease: A Chapter in the History of Ideas. Hafner Publishing Co Ltd. {{ISBN|978-0028548807}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The book cites Anton van Leeuwenhoek to show how ubiquitous such animalculae are, and was unique for describing the presence of germs in ulcerating wounds. Ultimately, the theory espoused by von Plenciz was not accepted by the scientific community.

=== Agostino Bassi ===
The Italian [[Agostino Bassi]] was the first person to prove that a disease was caused by a microorganism when he conducted a series of experiments between 1808 and 1813, demonstrating that a "vegetable parasite" caused a disease in silkworms known as ''calcinaccio''{{mdash}}this disease was devastating the French silk industry at the time. The "vegetable parasite" is now known to be a fungus pathogenic to insects called ''[[Beauveria bassiana]]'' (named after Bassi).

=== Ignaz Semmelweis ===
[[Ignaz Semmelweis]], a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[obstetrician]] working at the [[Vienna General Hospital]] (''Allgemeines Krankenhaus'') in 1847, noticed the dramatically high maternal mortality from [[puerperal fever]] following births assisted by doctors and medical students. However, those attended by midwives were relatively safe. Investigating further, Semmelweis made the connection between puerperal fever and examinations of delivering women by doctors, and further realized that these physicians had usually come directly from autopsies. Asserting that puerperal fever was a [[Contagious disease|contagious]] disease and that matter from autopsies were implicated in its development, Semmelweis made doctors wash their hands with chlorinated lime water before examining pregnant women.  He then documented a sudden reduction in the mortality rate from 18% to 2.2% over a period of a year.  Despite this evidence, he and his theories were [[Contemporary reaction to Ignaz Semmelweis|rejected]] by most of the contemporary medical establishment.

=== Gideon Mantell ===

[[Gideon Mantell]], the Sussex doctor more famous for discovering [[dinosaur fossils]], spent time with his microscope, and speculated in his ''Thoughts On Animalcules'' (1850) that perhaps "many of the most serious maladies which afflict humanity, are produced by peculiar states of invisible animalcular life".&lt;ref&gt;Pg. 90 of "The invisible world revealed by the microscope or, thoughts on animalcules.", second edition, 1850 (May have appeared in first edition, too. (Revise date in article to 1846, if so.))&lt;/ref&gt;

=== John Snow ===
{{Main article|1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak}}
[[File:Snow-cholera-map-1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Original map by John Snow showing the [[Cluster (epidemiology)|clusters]] of cholera cases in the London epidemic of 1854]]
[[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] was a skeptic of the then-dominant [[miasma theory of disease|miasma theory]]. Even though the germ theory of disease pioneered by Girolamo Fracastoro had not yet achieved full development or widespread currency,  Snow demonstrated a clear understanding of germ theory in his writings.  He first published his theory in an 1849 essay ''On the Mode of Communication of Cholera,''  in which he correctly suggested that the fecal-oral route was the mode of communication, and that the disease replicated itself in the lower intestines.  He even proposed in his 1855 edition of the work, that the structure of cholera was that of a cell.

{{bquote|Having rejected effluvia and the poisoning of the blood in the first instance, and being led to the conclusion that'' ''the disease is something that acts directly on the alimentary canal, the excretions of the sick at once suggest themselves as containing some material which being accidentally swallowed might attach itself to the mucous membrane of the small intestines, and there multiply itself by appropriation of surrounding matter, in virtue of molecular changes going on within it, or capable of going on, as soon as it is placed in congenial circumstances.||John Snow (1849)}}

{{bquote|For the morbid matter of cholera having the property of reproducing its own kind, must necessarily have some sort of structure, most likely that of a cell.  It is no objection to this view that the structure of the cholera poison cannot be recognized by the microscope, for the matter of smallpox and of chancre can only be recognized by their effects, and not by their physical properties.||John Snow (1855)}}

Snow's 1849 recommendation that water be "filtered and boiled before it is used" is one of the first practical applications of germ theory in the area of public health and is the antecedent to the modern [[boil-water advisory]].

In 1855 he published a second edition of his article, documenting his more elaborate investigation of the effect of the water supply in the [[Soho]], London epidemic of 1854.

By talking to local residents, he identified the source of the outbreak as the public water pump on Broad Street (now [[Broadwick Street]]). Although Snow's chemical and microscope examination of a water sample from the [[Broad Street pump]] did not conclusively prove its danger, his studies of the pattern of the disease were convincing enough to persuade the local council to disable the well pump by removing its handle. This action has been commonly credited as ending the outbreak, but Snow observed that the epidemic may have already been in rapid decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Snow |title=On the Mode of Communication of Cholera |location=London |publisher=J. Churchill |year=1849 |url=http://resource.nlm.nih.gov/0050707 |quote=There is no doubt that the mortality was much diminished, as I said before, by the flight of the population, which commenced soon after the outbreak; but the attacks had so far diminished before the use of the water was stopped, that it is impossible to decide whether the well still contained the cholera poison in an active state, or whether, from some cause, the water had become free from it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snow later used a [[dot distribution map|dot map]] to illustrate the cluster of cholera cases around the pump. He also used statistics to illustrate the connection between the quality of the water source and cholera cases. He showed that the [[Southwark and Vauxhall Waterworks Company]] was taking water from sewage-polluted sections of the [[Thames]] and delivering the water to homes, leading to an increased incidence of cholera. Snow's study was a major event in the history of public health and geography. It is regarded as one of the founding events of the science of [[epidemiology]].

Later, researchers discovered that this public well had been dug only three feet from an old [[cesspit]], which had begun to leak fecal bacteria.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} The diapers of a baby, who had contracted cholera from another source, had been washed into this cesspit. Its opening was originally under a nearby house, which had been rebuilt farther away after a fire. The city had widened the street and the cesspit was lost. It was common at the time to have a cesspit under most homes. Most families tried to have their raw sewage collected and dumped in the Thames to prevent their cesspit from filling faster than the sewage could decompose into the soil.

After the cholera epidemic had subsided, government officials replaced the handle on the Broad Street pump. They had responded only to the urgent threat posed to the population, and afterward they rejected Snow's theory. To accept his proposal would have meant accepting the fecal-oral method transmission of disease, which they dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Frank |last=Chapelle |chapter=Ch. 5: Hidden Life, Hidden Death |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=PgGVzCQgjEIC&amp;pg=PA82 |title=Wellsprings |location=New Brunswick NJ |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-8135-3614-9 |pages=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Louis Pasteur ===
[[File:Louis Pasteur Experiment.svg|thumb|Louis Pasteur’s pasteurization experiment illustrates the fact that the spoilage of liquid was caused by particles in the air rather than the air itself. These experiments were important pieces of evidence supporting the idea of germ theory of disease.]]
The more formal experiments on the relationship between germ and disease were conducted by Louis Pasteur between the year 1860 and 1864. He discovered the pathology of the puerperal fever&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/p/pasteur/louis/exgerm/complete.html |chapter=(translated from French) |trans-chapter=On the extension of the germ theory to the etiology of certain common diseases |first=Louis |last=Pasteur |others=Ernst, H.C. (trans) |year=1880 |origyear=May 1880 |title=Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences |volume=XC |pages=1033–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the pyogenic vibrio in the blood, and suggested using [[boric acid]] to kill these microorganisms before and after confinement.

Pasteur further demonstrated between 1860 and 1864 that [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]] and the growth of microorganisms in [[nutrient broth]]s did not proceed by spontaneous generation. He exposed freshly boiled broth to air in vessels that contained a filter to stop all particles passing through to the growth medium, and even with no filter at all, with air being admitted via a long tortuous tube that would not pass dust particles. Nothing grew in the broths: therefore the living organisms that grew in such broths came from outside, as spores on dust, rather than being generated within the broth.

Pasteur discovered that another serious disease of silkworms, ''[[pébrine]]'', was caused by a small microscopic organism now known as ''[[Nosema bombycis]]'' (1870). Pasteur saved France's silk industry by developing a method to screen silkworms eggs for those that were not infected, a method that is still used today to control this and other silkworm diseases.

=== Robert Koch ===
Robert Koch is known for developing four basic criteria (known as [[Koch's postulates]]) for demonstrating, in a scientifically sound manner, that a disease is caused by a particular organism. These postulates grew out of his seminal work with [[anthrax]] using purified cultures of the pathogen that had been isolated from diseased animals.

Koch's postulates were developed in the 19th century as general guidelines to identify pathogens that could be isolated with the techniques of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Walker L, Levine H, Jucker M | title = Koch's postulates and infectious proteins | journal = Acta Neuropathologica | volume = 112 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–4 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16703338 | doi = 10.1007/s00401-006-0072-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in Koch's time, it was recognized that some infectious agents were clearly responsible for disease even though they did not fulfill all of the postulates.&lt;ref name=Koch1884 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Koch 1893"/&gt; Attempts to rigidly apply Koch's postulates to the diagnosis of viral diseases in the late 19th century, at a time when viruses could not be seen or isolated in culture, may have impeded the early development of the field of [[virology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Robert Koch: a life in medicine and bacteriology |author=[[Thomas D. Brock|Brock TD]] |year=1999 |publisher=American Society of Microbiology Press |location=Washington DC |isbn=1-55581-143-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Evans AS |title=Causation and disease: the Henle-Koch postulates revisited |journal=Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=175–95 |date=May 1976 |pmid=782050 |pmc=2595276 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, a number of infectious agents are accepted as the cause of disease despite their not fulfilling all of Koch's postulates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jacomo V, Kelly P, Raoult D |title=Natural history of ''Bartonella'' infections (an exception to Koch's postulate) |journal=Clinical and Diagnostic Laboratory Immunology |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=8–18 |year=2002 |pmid=11777823 |doi=10.1128/CDLI.9.1.8-18.2002 |pmc=119901}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, while Koch's postulates retain historical importance and continue to inform the approach to microbiologic diagnosis, fulfillment of all four postulates is not required to demonstrate causality.

Koch's postulates have also influenced scientists who examine microbial pathogenesis from a molecular point of view. In the 1980s, a [[molecular Koch's postulates|molecular version]] of Koch's postulates was developed to guide the identification of microbial genes encoding [[virulence]] factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Falkow S |title=Molecular Koch's postulates applied to microbial pathogenicity |journal=Reviews of Infectious Diseases |volume=10 |issue=Suppl 2 |pages=S274–6 |year=1988 |pmid=3055197 |doi=10.1093/cid/10.Supplement_2.S274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Koch's postulates:'''
# The microorganism must be found in abundance in all organisms suffering from the disease, but should not be found in healthy organisms.
# The microorganism must be isolated from a diseased organism and grown in pure [[cell culture|culture]].
# The cultured microorganism should cause disease when introduced into a healthy organism.
# The microorganism must be reisolated from the inoculated, diseased experimental host and identified as being identical to the original specific causative agent.

However, Koch abandoned the universalist requirement of the first postulate altogether when he discovered asymptomatic carriers of cholera&lt;ref name="Koch 1893"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Koch Robert |title=Über den augenblicklichen Stand der bakteriologischen Choleradiagnose |language=German |journal=Zeitschrift für Hygiene und Infektionskrankheiten |year=1893 |volume=14 |pages=319–333 |doi=10.1007/BF02284324}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, later, of [[typhoid fever]]. [[Asymptomatic]] or [[subclinical infection]] carriers are now known to be a common feature of many infectious diseases, especially viruses such as [[polio]], [[herpes simplex]], [[HIV]], and [[hepatitis C]]. As a specific example, all doctors and virologists agree that [[poliovirus]] causes paralysis in just a few infected subjects, and the success of the [[polio vaccine]] in preventing disease supports the conviction that the poliovirus is the causative agent.

The third postulate specifies "should", not "must", because as Koch himself proved in regard to both [[tuberculosis]] and cholera,&lt;ref name=Koch1884&gt;{{cite book |author=Koch Robert |year=1884 |title=Mittheilungen aus dem Kaiserlichen Gesundheitsamte |chapter=Die Aetiologie der Tuberkulose |volume=2 |pages=1–88 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- see also: Conferenz zur Erörterung der Cholerafrage im Kaiserlichen Gesundheitsamt [Conference to discuss the matter of cholera at the Imperial Health Office]. ''Deutsche Medizinische Wochenschrift'' 10 (1884), pages 499-507, 519-532 --&gt; not all organisms exposed to an infectious agent will acquire the infection. Noninfection may be due to such factors as general health and proper immune functioning; acquired immunity from previous exposure or vaccination; or genetic immunity, as with the resistance to malaria conferred by possessing at least one sickle cell allele.

The second postulate may also be suspended for certain microorganisms or entities that cannot (at the present time) be grown in pure culture, such as prions responsible for [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Inglis TJ |title=Principia aetiologica: taking causality beyond Koch's postulates |journal=Journal of Medical Microbiology |volume=56 |issue=Pt 11 |pages=1419–22 |date=November 2007 |pmid=17965339 |doi=10.1099/jmm.0.47179-0 |url=http://jmm.sgmjournals.org/cgi/content/full/56/11/1419 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In summary, a body of evidence that satisfies Koch's postulates is sufficient but not necessary to establish causation.

== Sanitation ==
In the 1870s, [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]] was instrumental in developing practical applications of the germ theory of disease with respect to sanitation in medical settings and aseptic surgical techniques—partly through the use of carbolic acid ([[phenol]]) as an antiseptic.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4890">This is a glossary of levelling terms. Levelling is a surveying method used to find relative height, one use of which is to ensure ground is level during construction, for example, when excavating to prepare for laying a foundation for a house.

== Levelling terms ==

* [[Automatic level]] &amp;ndash; variant of the dumpy level, that makes use of a compensator that ensures that the line of sight remains horizontal once the operator has roughly leveled the instrument. The surveyor sets the instrument up quickly and doesn't have to relevel it carefully each time he sights on a rod on another point. It also reduces the effect of minor settling of the tripod. Three adjustment screws are used to level the instrument.
{{anchor|Back sight}} &lt;!-- redirects lead to this anchor, please do not remove. --&gt;
* [[Back sight]] (BS) – short for "back sight reading", the first staff reading taken by the surveyor after the levelling instrument is set up and levelled. B.S is generally taken on the point of known reduced level as on the benchmark or a change point.&lt;ref&gt;Surveying Volume 1 by Prof. C.L Kochher. Retrieved on 27 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Benchmark (surveying)]] – fixed reference point of known elevation with respect to which RL of other points is determined. Benchmarks can be arbitrary or permanent, the former is used for calculation of reduced levels for small survey works and the latter is used to calculate the elevations of significantly important locations and points. Arbitrary benchmarks are assumed to be equal to 100 meters generally and then the elevations with respect to assumed benchmark is determined. It is commonly practiced by engineering students. For GTS surveys of the country, surveyors use permanent benchmarks to calculate the elevations of different points.&lt;ref&gt;Surveying Volume 1 by Prof C.L Kochher. Retrieved on 28 October 2014. Page no. 218&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Datum surface]] – reference plane with respect to which RL of the other survey points is determined. The datum surface may be real or imaginary location with a nominated elevation of zero.  The commonly used datum is mean sea level.&lt;ref&gt;Surveying Volume 1 by Dr. B.C Punmia and Ashok Kumar Jain. Retrieved on 27 October 2014 &lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Dumpy level]] &amp;ndash; optical instrument used to establish or check points in the same horizontal plane. It is used in surveying and building with a vertical staff to measure height differences and to transfer, measure and set heights. Also called a builder's level or leveling instrument.
{{anchor|Fore sight}} &lt;!-- redirects lead to this anchor, please do not remove. --&gt;
* [[Fore sight (surveying)|Fore sight]] (FS) – short for "fore sight reading", the last staff reading taken before changing the instrument to the other position. It is the staff reading taken on point whose RL is to determined. This sight is considered as negative and deduced from Height of Instrument to determine RL of the point.
{{anchor|Intermediate sight}} &lt;!-- redirects lead to this anchor, please do not remove. --&gt;
* [[Intermediate sight]]s – all readings taken between back sight and fore sight. These are the points whose RL is determined by the method already mentioned above in FS. Also called inter-sight readings.
* [[Laser level]] &amp;ndash; control tool consisting of a laser beam projector that can be affixed to a tripod, and which projects a fixed red or green beam along the horizontal and/or vertical axis. A rotary laser level is a more advanced laser level in that it spins the beam of light fast enough to give the effect of a complete 360 degree horizontal or vertical plane, thus illuminating not just a fixed line, but a horizontal plane.
* [[Levelling]] – measurement of geodetic height using an optical levelling instrument and a level staff or rod having a numbered scale. Common levelling instruments include the spirit level, the dumpy level, the digital level, and the laser level.
* [[Levelling staff]] &amp;ndash; specialized measuring stick or vertical staff used with the dumpy level, held by a second person while the operator of the level looks through it and takes readings off of the staff. Also call a rod.
* [[Reduced level]] (RL) –  equating elevations of survey points with reference to a common assumed datum. The elevation is positive or negative according as point lies above or below datum.
* [[Spirit level]] &amp;ndash; instrument designed to indicate whether a surface is horizontal (level) or vertical (plumb). While used by surveyors, different types of spirit levels may be used by carpenters, stonemasons, bricklayers, other building trades workers, millwrights and other metalworkers, and in some photographic or videographic work.

'''Hammerscale''', also written '''hammer scale''', is a flaky or spheroidal byproduct of the [[iron]] [[forging]] process (for modern equivalent, see [[mill scale]]). Hammerscale is almost universally recovered from [[Archaeology|archaeological]] excavations in areas where [[iron ore]] was refined and forged. Hammerscale’s [[ferromagnetism|magnetic character]] also aids in its recovery and in mapping larger features by means of magnetic susceptibility surveys.&lt;ref name="dungworth"&gt;Dungworth, D and R Wilkes.

==Description==

===Physical attributes===
Hammerscale appears in two forms: flakes and hollow spheroids. The flakes can vary greatly in appearance and size; however, their color ranges from a dark black to a lustrous blue or grey and their thickness from one to five millimeters. Like the flakes, the spheroids are also quite small but their size can vary. Their color tends to range from grey to a dark black or blue.&lt;ref name=dungworth2&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dungworth|first1=David|last2=Wilkes|first2=Roger|title=Understanding hammerscale: the use of high-speed film and electronc microscopy|journal=Historical Metallurgy|volume=43|number=1|date=2009|p=33–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical composition===
The chemical composition of hammerscale is disputed and varies greatly. Most sources agree that hammerscale is composed of some form of [[iron oxide]]. [[Magnetite]] is a generally accepted form, giving hammerscale its notable magnetic character. However, hammerscale’s chemical composition can change depending on from which stage in the [[refining (metallurgy)|iron purification]] process it derives; for flakes and spheroids from early stages, the composition will be largely mixed whereas flakes from late stages will be purer iron oxide forms.&lt;ref name = "payne"&gt;Payne, Sebastian. “The Shadow in the Old Smithy.” British Archeology. March 2010. http://www.archaeologyuk.org/ba/ba111/science.shtml.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, some still argue that the chemical components of hammerscale besides iron vary widely beyond [[oxide|ionized oxygen]] to form a metal oxide.&lt;ref name = "young"&gt;Young, Tim. “Some Preliminary Observations of Hammerscale and its Implications for Understanding Welding.” British and Irish Archaeological Bibliography. 2011. http://www.biab.ac.uk/contents/202232.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
[[File:3 tourist helping artist blacksmith in finland.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|A modern [[blacksmith]] in [[Finland]] practicing ironworking in a manner similar to more archaic methods that resulted in the production of hammerscale]]

Flake Hammerscale forms due to the rapid [[oxidation]] of hot iron in air. A heated piece of iron will develop an external layer of iron oxide which then may separate from the original piece due to a hammer strike or [[thermal expansion|differential thermal contraction]] .&lt;ref name="dorling"&gt;Dorling, P. “New Weir Forg, Witchurch, Herefordshire: A Report on Excavations in 2009 and 2010.” Herefordshire Archeology. December 2011. {{cite web |url=http://htt.herefordshire.gov.uk/docs/HA306_SHE19111_New_Weir_Final_excavation_report.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715012332/http://htt.herefordshire.gov.uk/docs/HA306_SHE19111_New_Weir_Final_excavation_report.pdf |archivedate=2015-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flake Hammerscale is produced in large quantities during multiple stages of the [[smithing]] process. To create the pure iron necessary for forging, a smith must first purify the iron ore. The smelting of ore creates a ‘bloom’, a porous mixture of [[slag]] and metal. The smith then repeatedly heats and hammers the bloom to remove impurities. This technique creates hammerscale of varying composition. As the purification process continues, the hammerscale’s iron content increases.&lt;ref name = "payne"/&gt; 
 
Additional hammerscale is produced during the forging of the pure iron from the heating and hammering necessary to shape the piece. The scale produced at this stage is characterized by its blue-black color and tends to be slimmer and darker due to its high iron oxide content.&lt;ref name="dorling" /&gt;
 
Archeologists believe that spheroidal hammerscale is produced primarily during the process known as fire welding. Also known as [[forge welding]], this technique is used to connect two pieces of metal by heating them to a high temperature and forcing them together with a hammer or other tool. For this method to be successful, the surface of each piece of metal must be molten. As the smith hammers the pieces together, some metal is forced out from between them, often in the form of a molten jet which cools in the air to form spheroidal hammer scale.&lt;ref name="dorling" /&gt;
 
It is also possible for spheroidal hammerscale to form during the purification of slag. As the smith hammers a bloom, it compacts which can drive molten metal out of the slag into the air.&lt;ref name = "payne"/&gt;

==Use in archaeology==

===Ironworking===
Due to the high volume of hammerscale flakes and spheroid shells produced during regular ironworking processes, archaeologists often use its presence to identify iron smithies and smelters. Hammerscale is easily detected due to its composition and magnetic nature, which allows for it to be easily extracted with a [[magnet]].&lt;ref name = "frengi"&gt;Frengi, Giovanna. “The Archeology of Metalworking: Fieldworkers Practical Guide.”  British Archaeological Jobs and Resources. 2014. http://www.bajr.org/BAJRGuides/35.%20Metalworking/35MetalworkingGuide.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, again due to its magnetic nature, it is very useful when completing a magnetic susceptibility survey of a site. And, although both finished iron objects and slag are also frequently recovered at former locations of ironworking, hammerscale is arguably a more reliable recovery. Due to their size, iron objects and slag finds are more likely to have been removed or reused, whereas the small hammerscale flakes or spheres were most likely not removed.&lt;ref name = "starling"&gt;Starling, David. “Hammerscale.” The Historical Metallurgy Society. April 1995. http://hist-met.org/images/pdf/hmsdatasheet10.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In addition, the distribution of hammerscale within an archaeological feature can be used to partially determine the function of each region of the feature. In particular, areas with higher concentrations of hammerscale flakes suggest the presence of an [[anvil]] of a [[hearth]] as flakes were produced during either the hammering of the iron objects or broken off while heating iron of different stages of purity. In contrast, the presence of large amounts of slag within a confirmed smithy or smelter is less conclusive, though it might indicate waste piles.&lt;ref name = "grant"&gt;Grant, Jim, Gorin, Sam, and Neil Fleming. The Archeology Coursebook: and Introduction to Themes, Sites, Methods and Skills. New York: Routledge, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "keys"&gt;Keys, Lynne. “Iron Slag on Archeological Sites: an Introduction.” The Historical Metallurgy Society. http://hist-met.org/hmsslagintro.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Beyond the distribution, the chemical composition and physical characteristics of specific samples of hammerscale can aid archaeologists in determining the purpose of an ironworking feature. In particular, certain samples, such as spheroidal hammerscale, are only produced during certain earlier stages of the iron purification process, providing evidence of smelting activities. The more recognizable, lustrous, and larger flake forms arise almost exclusively from hammering of completed iron objects. By studying the different types of hammerscale present and its prevalence, a trained [[metallurgist]] can map out both the purpose of each area of the feature as well as the larger purpose of the entire feature (i.e. smithy or smelter).&lt;ref name = "arne"&gt;Jouttijärvi, Arne (2009) 'The Shadow in the Smithy', Materials and Manufacturing Processes.’ Taylor and Francis. September 1, 2009.	https://www.academia.edu/1775682/The_Shadow_in_the_Smithy&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collection techniques===
Due its small size and often darker color, hammerscale is difficult to discover while carrying out simple archaeological processes, such as dry or wet [[sieving]]. Instead, when there is clear evidence that a site, such as a [[pit-house]], involved some form of ironworking, archaeologists are advised to form a grid and collect soil from the site for further analysis. This allows for trained metallurgists to analyze the type of hammerscale and their prevalence within the structure. This is still a rare practice for lack of time or expertise, but nevertheless recommended and if untenable, soil samples should still be run over with a magnet so as to collect hammerscale flakes on site.&lt;ref name = "arne"/&gt;

===History and sample excavations===
Seeing as it is a seemingly natural part of earlier ironworking techniques, hammerscale finds have been noted at numerous archaeological excavations in numerous world regions such as [[Northern Europe]], [[Great Britain]], and the [[Levant]].&lt;ref name = "dorling"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "grant"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "arne"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "powell"&gt;Powell, Andrew B., Stephanie Knight, Lorraine Mepham, Chris J. Stevens and Sarah F. Wyles. “A Middle-Late Iron Age field system and post-medieval garden features at Stedlyn Retreat, Lynsted, Kent.” Kent Archaeological Society. (publication date unknown.) http://www.kentarchaeology.ac/archrep/lynsted01.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The earliest mention of hammerscale in an archaeological context derived from a 1941 study of [[Roman Empire|Roman]]-built fort in Great Britain, located on [[Hadrian’s wall]]. An excavation in 1960 of a Roman ironworking site in [[Norfolk]] also yielded hammer scale. In more recent excavations, hammerscale recovery has been conducted in a more systematic manner, utilizing the grid method noted [[Hammerscale (Archaeology)#Collection Techniques|above]]. For example, in an excavation in 1992, by means of establishing a grid and collecting local samples, the former location of a hearth and an anvil was determined despite the lack of the direct remains of either.&lt;ref name= "dungworth"/&gt; Arne Jouttijärvi writes of three sites at which hammerscale deposits and concentration were utilized to map out the different areas of smithies in [[Viking Age]] pithouses in modern-day Denmark and Norway. For example, he writes how the “blacksmith himself shielded the floor where he stood, leaving a ‘shadow’ in the distribution of hammer scale.”&lt;ref name = "arne"/&gt; Therefore, the distribution of hammerscale is not only able to aid in the location items within a workshop, but can also inform scholars of where the smiths themselves stood.
 
Smithy discoveries involving hammerscale are well documented and generally a high presence of hammerscale is considered sufficient to identify a find as a smithy. There is even evidence of hammerscale at a [[bronze age]] site in Upper Bucklebury, West Berkshire, suggesting early ironworking in Britain.&lt;ref name = "cotswold"&gt;“Early Iron Working at Upper Bluckleburry, West Berkshire.” Cotswold Archeology. 2003. http://www.cotswoldarchaeology.co.uk/highlight-3/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hercules X-1''' (Her X-1), also known as 4U1656+35, is a moderately strong [[X-ray binary]] source first studied by the [[Uhuru (satellite)|Uhuru]] [[satellite]].
It is composed of a [[neutron star]] accreting [[matter]] from a normal [[star]] (HZ Her) probably due to [[Roche lobe]] overflow.

==Intermediate-mass X-ray binary (IMXB)==

Her X-1 is the prototype for the massive X-ray binaries although it falls on the borderline, {{Solar mass|~2|link=y}}, between high- and low-mass X-ray binaries.&lt;ref name=Priedhorsky/&gt;

An [[X-ray binary#Intermediate-mass X-ray binary|intermediate-mass X-ray binary]] (IMXB) is a [[binary star]] system where one of the components is a neutron star or a [[black hole]]. The other component is an intermediate mass star.&lt;ref name=Podsiadlowski&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Podsiadlowski P, Rappaport S, Pfahl E |title=Evolutionary Binary Sequences for Low- and Intermediate-Mass X-ray Binaries |date=2001 |doi=10.1086/324686 |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=565 |issue=2 |pages=1107 |arxiv=astro-ph/0107261 |bibcode=2002ApJ...565.1107P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intensity==
[[Image:Herx1 lc.gif|500px|thumb|right|This light curve of Her X-1 shows long term and medium term variability. Each pair of vertical lines delineate the eclipse of the compact object behind its companion star. In this case, the companion is a 2 Solar-mass star with a radius of nearly 4 times that of the [[Sun]]. This eclipse shows the 1.7-day orbital period of the system.]]
The source exhibits complex time variability, pulsing with a [[Orbital period|period]] of 1.24 s due to the rotation of the neutron star, eclipsing every 1.70 days with the period of the binary orbit, and also varying with a 35-day period believed associated with the precession of the [[accretion disk]]. From observations, a twisted accretion disk, in [[retrograde motion|retrograde]] [[precession]], modulates the X-rays illuminating HZ Her and Earth.&lt;ref name=Priedhorsky&gt;{{ cite journal |vauthors=Priedhorsky WC, Holt SS |title=Long-term cycles in cosmic X-ray sources |journal=Space Sci.

The 1.24 second pulsar period associated with Her X-1 is immediately evident from the data. The sharp cut-off at ~24 [[keV]] in the flat spectrum observed for Her X-1 in this exposure provided the first reported evidence for [[radiative transfer]] effects to be associated with a highly magnetized [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] near the surface of a neutron star.

==Discovery of Her X-1==

The actual announcement of the discovery of Hercules X-1 by [[Uhuru (satellite)|Uhuru]] occurred at the 1971-72 Winter Meeting of the High-Energy Astrophysics Division AAS held in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]].&lt;ref name=Schreier&gt;{{ cite journal |vauthors=Schreier E, Levinson R, Gursky H, Kellogg E, Tananbaum H, Giacconi R |title=Evidence for the Binary Nature of Centaurus X-3 from UHURU X-Ray Observations |journal=Astrophys.

==Location==

The position of Her X-1 was uncertain due to the failure of the [[Uhuru (satellite)|Uhuru]] star aspect sensors, having been reported&lt;ref name=Tananbaum/&gt; at J1950 [[Right ascension|RA]] 17&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;05&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; [[Declination|Dec]] 34°52' using Uhuru and at 16&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;56.7&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; [[Declination|Dec]] 35°35'&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;{{ cite journal |vauthors=Clark GW, Bradt HV, Lewin WH, Schnopper HW, Sprott G |date=1972 |journal=Nature |volume=237 |issue=5355 |pages=369 |doi=10.1038/237369a0 |title=X-ray Astronomy: Uhuru Dominates Madrid Meeting |bibcode = 1972Natur.237..369A }}&lt;/ref&gt; using [[OSO 7]].

In 1973, Bahcall and Bahcall determined that HZ Herculis had a light curve that matched Hercules X-1's, fixing Hercules X-1's position.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5071">In [[computer graphics]], a '''hierarchical RBF''' is an [[interpolation]] method based on [[Radial basis function]]s (RBF). Hierarchical RBF interpolation has applications in the construction of shape models in [[3d computer graphics|3D computer graphics]] (see [[Stanford Bunny]] image below), treatment of results from a [[3D scanner]], [[terrain]] reconstruction and others.

[[Image:MyBunny.gif]]

This problem is informally named "large scattered data point set interpolation".

The idea of method (for example in 3D) consists of the following:
* Let the scattered points be presented as set &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}=\{\mathbf{c}_i=(\mathbf{x}_i,\mathbf{y}_i,\mathbf{z}_i)\vert^{N}_{i=1} \subset \mathbb{R}^3\}&lt;/math&gt;
* Let there exist a set of values of some function in scattered points &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{H}=\{\mathbf{h}_i \vert^{N}_{i=1}\subset \mathbb{R}\}&lt;/math&gt;
* Find a function &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; which will meet the condition &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x})=1&lt;/math&gt; for points lying on the shape and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x})\neq1&lt;/math&gt; for points not lying on the shape.
* As J. C. Carr et al. showed &lt;ref&gt;Carr, J.C.; Beatson, R.K.; Cherrie, J.B.; Mitchell, T.J.; Fright, W.R.; McCallum B.C.; Evans, T.R. (2001),  “Reconstruction and Representation of 3D Objects with Radial Basis Functions” ACM SIGGRAPH 2001, Los Angeles, CA, P. 67–76.&lt;/ref&gt; this function looks like &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x})=\sum_{i=1}^N \lambda_i \varphi(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{c}_i)&lt;/math&gt; where:
&lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; &amp;mdash; it is [[Radial basis function|RBF]];
&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; &amp;mdash; it is coefficients which are the solution of the [[Linear system of equations|system]] show on picture:

[[Image:System.gif]]

for determination of surface it is necessary to estimate the value of function &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; in interesting  points ''x''.
A lack of such method is considerable complication &lt;ref&gt;Bashkov, E.A.; Babkov, V.S. (2008) “Research of RBF-algorithm and his modifications apply
possibilities for the construction of shape computer models in medical practice”. Proc Int.

* [[Fast multipole method|FMM]]  (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{O}(\mathbf{n}^2)&lt;/math&gt; for calculate [[Radial basis function|RBF]], &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{O}(\mathbf{n}\log{\mathbf{n}})&lt;/math&gt; for solve [[Linear system of equations|system]], &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{O}(\mathbf{m}+\mathbf{n}\log{\mathbf{n}})&lt;/math&gt; for determine surface)

==Hierarchical algorithm==
An idea of [[hierarchical]] [[Algorythm|algorithm]] is an acceleration of calculations due to [[Decomposition (computer science)|decomposition]] of intricate problem on the great number of simple (see picture). [[File:Hierarchical algorithm flow chart.gif]]

In this case [[hierarchical]] division of space containing points on elementary parts, the [[Linear system of equations|system]] of small dimension solves in each of which. The calculation of surface in this case is taken to the [[hierarchical]] (on the basis of [[Tree (data structure)|tree-structure]]) calculation of interpolant. A method for a [[2D computer graphics|2D]] case is offered Pouderoux J. et al.&lt;ref&gt;Pouderoux, J. et al.

The '''history of the motorcycle''' begins in the second half of the 19th century. [[Motorcycle]]s are descended from the "[[safety bicycle]]," a bicycle with front and rear wheels of the same size and a pedal crank mechanism to drive the rear wheel.&lt;ref name="The Past - 1800s: First motorcycle"&gt;{{cite web | title=The Past - 1800s: First motorcycle | work=The History and Future of Motorcycles and motorcycling - From 1885 to the Future, Total Motorcycle Website | url=http://www.totalmotorcycle.com/future.htm#1800s | accessdate=2007-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite some early landmarks in its development, the motorcycle lacks a rigid pedigree that can be traced back to a single idea or machine. Instead, the idea seems to have occurred to numerous engineers and inventors around Europe at around the same time.

==Early steam-powered cycles==
[[File:Copeland stoomfiets 1894.jpg|thumb|Lucius Copeland 1894]]
In the 1860s [[Pierre Michaux]], a [[blacksmith]] in Paris, founded 'Michaux et Cie' ("Michaux and company"), the first company to construct [[bicycle]]s with [[bicycle pedal|pedals]] called a [[velocipede]] at the time, or "Michauline".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crazyguyonabike.com/doc/page/?o=3Tzut&amp;page_id=40617&amp;v=9j Michauline]&lt;/ref&gt; The first steam powered motorcycle, the [[Michaux-Perreaux steam velocipede]], can be traced to 1867, when Pierre's son Ernest Michaux fitted a small steam engine to one of the 'velocipedes'.&lt;ref name="Burgess"&gt;{{cite book|last=Burgess Wise|first=David|title=Historic Motor Cycles|publisher=Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited|isbn=0-600-34407-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design went to America when [[Pierre Lallement]], a Michaux employee who also claimed to have developed the prototype in 1863, filed for the first bicycle patent with the US patent office in 1866.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bicycling.about.com/od/thebikelife/ss/History_3.htm|title=The Boneshaker - Invented by Michaux and Lallement|last=Fiedler|first=David|work=About.com|accessdate=23 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1868 an American, [[Sylvester H. Roper]] of [[Roxbury, Massachusetts]] developed a twin-cylinder [[Roper steam velocipede|steam velocipede]], with a coal-fired boiler between the wheels. Roper's contribution to motorcycle development ended suddenly when he died demonstrating one of his machines in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] on June 1, 1896.&lt;ref name="Burgess"/&gt;

Also in 1868, a French engineer [[Louis-Guillaume Perreaux]] patented a similar steam powered single cylinder machine, the [[Michaux-Perreaux steam velocipede]], with an alcohol burner and twin belt drives, which was possibly invented independently of Roper's. Although the patent is dated 1868, nothing indicates the invention had been operable before 1871.&lt;ref name="Burgess"/&gt;

In 1881, [[Lucius Copeland]] of [[Phoenix, Arizona]] designed a much smaller steam boiler which could drive the large rear wheel of an [[American Star Bicycle|American Star]] [[Penny-farthing|high-wheeler]] at 12&amp;nbsp;mph. In 1887 Copeland formed the Northrop Manufacturing Co. to produce the first successful 'Moto-Cycle' (actually a three-wheeler).&lt;ref name="Burgess"/&gt;

==Experimentation and invention==
[[File:Butler's Patent Velocycle.jpg|left|thumb|Butler's Patent Velocycle]]
The very first commercial design for a self-propelled [[bicycle]] was a three-wheel design called the ''Butler Petrol Cycle'', conceived of and built by [[Edward Butler (inventor)|Edward Butler]] in [[England]] in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/394358/motorcycle|title=motorcycle (vehicle)|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; He exhibited his plans for the vehicle at the [[Stanley Cycle Show]] in London in 1884, two years earlier than [[Karl Benz]] invented his first automobile who is generally recognized as the inventor of the modern automobile. Butler's vehicle was also the first design to be shown at the 1885 [[International Inventions Exhibition]] in London.

The vehicle was built by the [[Merryweather &amp; Sons|Merryweather Fire Engine]] company in [[Greenwich, England|Greenwich]], in 1888.&lt;ref name="Georgano"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[G.N. Georgano]]|title=Early and Vintage Years, 1885-1930: The Golden Era of Coachbuilding|publisher=Mason Crest Publishers|year=2002|page=22|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1590844912&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Butler '''Petrol Cycle''' (first recorded use of the term)&lt;ref name="Georgano" /&gt; It was a three-wheeled vehicle, with the rear wheel directly driven by a &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;hp (466W) 600 cc (40 in&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;; 2¼×5-inch {57×127-mm})&lt;ref name="Georgano"/&gt; flat twin [[four stroke]] engine (with [[magneto]] ignition replaced by coil and battery),&lt;ref name="Georgano"/&gt; equipped with [[rotary valves]] and a float-fed [[carburettor]] (five years before [[Wilhelm Maybach|Maybach]]),&lt;ref name="Georgano"/&gt; and [[Ackermann steering geometry|Ackermann steering]],&lt;ref&gt;[[G.N. Georgano]], p.20 cap.&lt;/ref&gt; all of which were state of the art at the time. Starting was by compressed air.&lt;ref name="Georgano"/&gt; The engine was liquid-cooled, with a [[radiator]] over the rear driving wheel. Speed was controlled by means of a [[throttle]] valve lever. No braking system was fitted; the vehicle was stopped by raising and lowering the rear driving wheel using a foot-operated lever; the weight of the machine was then borne by two small castor wheels. The driver was seated between the front wheels.&lt;ref name="Georgano"/&gt; It wasn't, however, a commercial success, as Butler failed to find sufficient financial backing.

It was designed and built by the German inventors [[Gottlieb Daimler]] and [[Wilhelm Maybach]] in [[Bad Cannstatt]], Germany in 1885.&lt;ref name="ThePast1800s"&gt;{{cite web | title=The Past –  1800s: First motorcycle | work=The History and Future of Motorcycles and motorcycling –  From 1885 to the Future, Total Motorcycle Website | url=http://www.totalmotorcycle.com/future.htm#1800s | accessdate=28 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This vehicle was unlike either the [[safety bicycle]]s or the [[Boneshaker (bicycle)|boneshaker]] bicycles of the era in that it had zero degrees of [[Bicycle and motorcycle geometry#Steering axis angle|steering axis angle]] and no [[Bicycle and motorcycle geometry#Fork offset|fork offset]], and thus did not use the principles of [[bicycle and motorcycle dynamics]] developed nearly 70 years earlier.

The inventors called their invention the ''Reitwagen'' ("riding car").

==First commercial products==
In the decade from the late 1880s, dozens of designs and machines emerged, particularly in Germany and in England, and soon spread to America.&lt;ref name="An overview of the British motorcycle industry and its collapse"&gt;{{cite web | title= An overview of the British motorcycle industry and its collapse | author= Ian Chadwick | work= British Motorcycle Manufacturers | date= June 30, 2001 | url= http://www.ianchadwick.com/motorcycles/britbikes/index.html | accessdate= 2007-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During this early period of motorcycle history there were many manufacturers, since bicycle makers were adapting their designs for the new [[internal combustion engine]].

[[File:1894 Hildebrand &amp; Wolfmüller diagram.png|thumb|left|Diagram of 1894 Hildebrand &amp; Wolfmüller.]]
In 1894 [[Hildebrand &amp; Wolfmüller]] became the first series production motorcycle, and the first to be called a "motorcycle" ({{lang-de|Motorrad}}).&lt;ref name=Setright1979/&gt;&lt;ref name=Falco1999/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Kresnak|first= Bill|year= 2008|title= Motorcycling for Dummies|publisher= [[For Dummies]], [[Wiley Publishing]]|isbn= 0-470-24587-5|location= [[Hoboken, New Jersey]]|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZPgrJByqp4wC|page= |postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Brief History of the Marque: Hildebrand &amp; Wolfmuller | work= Hildebrand &amp; Wolfmuller Motorad, European Motorcycle Universe | url= http://www.cybermotorcycle.com/euro/brands/hildebrand_wolfmuller.htm | accessdate= 28 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, only a few hundred examples of this motorcycle were ever built. The first instance of the term "motor cycle" also appears in English the same year in materials promoting machines developed by [[E.J. Pennington]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atthecreation.com/first.mc/Worlds.First.Motorcycle.html Wagner,Herbert "The World's First Motorcycle Origin of the Word and Device"]&lt;/ref&gt; although Pennington's motorcycles never progressed past the prototype stage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ianchadwick.com/motorcycles/britbikes/brit_p.html Chadwick, Ian. "Pennington" (in list of) British motorcycle manufacturers P:, June 6, 2003], retrieved March 18, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Excelsior Motor Company]], originally a bicycle-manufacturing company based in [[Coventry]] in Warwickshire ([[England]]), began production of their first motorcycle model in 1896, available for purchase by the public. The first production motorcycle in the US was the Orient-Aster, built by [[Metz Company|Charles Metz]] in 1898 at his factory in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]].

In 1898, [[Peugeot Motocycles]] presents at the [[Paris Motor Show|Paris Motorshow]] the first motorcycle equipped with a Dion-Bouton motor. Peugeot Motocycles remains the oldest motorcycle manufacturer in the world.

In the early period of motorcycle history, many producers of [[bicycle]]s adapted their designs to accommodate the new internal-combustion engine. As the engines became more powerful and designs outgrew the bicycle origins, the number of motorcycle producers increased. Many of the nineteenth-century inventors who worked on early motorcycles often moved on to other inventions. Daimler and Roper, for example, both went on to develop automobiles.

At the turn of the 20th century the first major mass-production firms emerged. [[File:Fn-1913.jpg|thumb|A 1913 FN (Fabrique National), Belgium, 4 cylinders and shaft drive]]
In 1901 English quadricycle- and bicycle-maker [[Royal Enfield]] introduced its first motorcycle, with a 239&amp;nbsp;cc engine mounted in the front and driving the rear wheel through a belt. In 1898 English bicycle-maker [[Triumph Engineering Co Ltd|Triumph]] decided to extend its focus to include motorcycles, and by 1902 the company had produced its first motorcycle—a bicycle fitted with a Belgian-built engine. A year later it was the largest motorcycle-manufacturer, with an annual production of over 500 units. Other British firms included [[Norton Motorcycle Company|Norton]] and [[Birmingham Small Arms Company]] who began motorbike production in 1902 and 1910, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bikes4sale.in/wp/756/history-of-motorbikes/|title= History of Motorbikes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901 the [[Indian (motorcycle)|Indian {{not a typo|Motocycle}} Manufacturing Company]], which had been founded by two former bicycle-racers, designed the so-called "diamond framed" Indian Single, whose engine was built by the Aurora Firm in [[Illinois]] per Indian's specifications. The Single was made available in the deep blue. Indian's production was up to over 500 bikes by 1902, and would rise to 32,000, its best ever, in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |authorlink = Mick Walker (motorcycling) |last = Walker |first= Mick |year= 2006 |title= Motorcycle: Evolution, Design, Passion |publisher= JHU Press |isbn= 978-0-8018-8530-3 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=AHSlknpjrgAC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=Indian+largest#v=onepage&amp;q= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|publisher= The AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame Museum |title= George Hendee |url= http://www.motorcyclemuseum.org/halloffame/hofbiopage.asp?id=68 |accessdate= 8 August 2009 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090910021152/http://www.motorcyclemuseum.org/halloffame/hofbiopage.asp?id=68 |archivedate= September 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
The American company [[Harley-Davidson]] started producing motorcycles in 1903.

During this period, experimentation and innovation were driven by the popular new sport of [[motorcycle racing]], with its powerful incentive to produce tough, fast, reliable machines. These enhancements quickly found their way to the public's machines.&lt;ref name="An overview of the British motorcycle industry and its collapse"/&gt;

Chief [[August Vollmer]] of the [[Berkeley, California]] [[Police Department]] is credited{{by whom|date=October 2017}} with organizing the first official [[police motorcycle]]-patrol in the United States in 1911.&lt;ref name="Our History"&gt;{{cite web | title= Our History | work= Berkeley Police Department Online, City of Berkeley, CA | url= http://www.ci.berkeley.ca.us/police/history/history.html | accessdate= 2007-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By 1914, motorcycles were no longer just bicycles with engines; they had their own technologies, although many still maintained bicycle elements, like the seats and suspension.

==The First World War==
[[File:Triumph 1922 H 1.jpg|thumb|[[Triumph Engineering|Triumph Motorcycles]] [[Triumph Type H|Model H]], was mass-produced for the war effort and notable for its reliability.]]
During the [[First World War]], motorbike production was greatly ramped up for the war effort to supply effective communications with front line troops. Messengers on horses were replaced with [[dispatch rider]]s on motorcycles carrying messages, performing reconnaissance personnel and acting as a military police. American company [[Harley-Davidson]] was devoting over 50% of its factory output toward military contract by the end of the war. The British company [[Triumph Engineering|Triumph Motorcycles]] sold more than 30,000 of its [[Triumph Type H]] model to [[Triple Entente|allied forces]] during the war. With the rear wheel driven by a belt, the Model H was fitted with a 499&amp;nbsp;cc air-cooled [[four-stroke]] single-cylinder engine. It was also the first Triumph not to be fitted with pedals, so was a true motorcycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.triumph1.com/triumph_history.htm |title=Triumph history |accessdate=2009-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229100156/http://www.triumph1.com/triumph_history.htm |archivedate=December 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Model H in particular, is regarded by many as having been the first "modern motorcycle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motorcycle-usa.com/689/2598/Motorcycle-Article/Triumph-Motorcycle-History.aspx|title=Triumph Motorcycle History}}&lt;/ref&gt; Introduced in 1915 it had a 550cc side-valve four-stroke engine with a three-speed gearbox and belt transmission. It was so popular with its users that it was nicknamed the "Trusty Triumph."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Triumph Motorcycles timeline|url=http://www.ianchadwick.com/motorcycles/triumph/time01.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1920, [[Harley-Davidson]] became the largest manufacturer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pcmotors.com/harley.html|title=History of Harley-Davidson Motor Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; with their motorcycles being sold by dealers in 67 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=HOG WILD; U of T professor Brendan Calder is one of the legions of baby boomers who have helped to ensure the success of the Harley-Davidson brand name, not to mention its bottom line.|first=Sharda |last=Prashad |periodical=Toronto Star |location=Toronto, Ont.|date=16 April 2006 | page=A.16 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/1021570771.html?dids=1021570771:1021570771&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Harley-Davidson at 100 |first=Jeremy |last=Cato |periodical=The Vancouver Sun |location=Vancouver, B.C. |date=8 August 2003 |page=E.1.Fro }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[BMW Motorrad|BMW motorcycles]] came on the scene in 1923 with a shaft drive and an [[Flat-twin engine|opposed-twin or "boxer"]] [[Unit construction|engine enclosed with the transmission]] in a single aluminum housing.

By 1931, Indian and Harley-Davidson were the only two American manufacturers producing commercial motorcycles.&lt;ref name="HD History: Timeline - 1930s"&gt;{{cite web|title=HD History: Timeline - 1930s |work=Harley-Davidson USA (2001-2007 H-D) |url=http://www.harley-davidson.com/wcm/Content/Pages/H-D_History/history_1930s.jsp?HDCWPSession=lG1xFnTQTTXKR0p6wpHB1N1cHtzdJ1250h8CvxtWctfBkvrFnRG4!-74508550!1457951189&amp;locale=en_US |accessdate=2007-06-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928002044/http://www.harley-davidson.com/wcm/Content/Pages/H-D_History/history_1930s.jsp?HDCWPSession=lG1xFnTQTTXKR0p6wpHB1N1cHtzdJ1250h8CvxtWctfBkvrFnRG4%21-74508550%211457951189&amp;locale=en_US |archivedate=September 28, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This two-company rivalry in the United States remained until 1953, when the Indian Motorcycle factory in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] closed and [[Royal Enfield]] took over the Indian name.&lt;ref name="Post 1953 Indian Motorcycle History"&gt;{{cite web|title=Post 1953 Indian Motorcycle History |work=www.cycletownusa.com |url=http://www.cycletownusa.com/post1953.html |accessdate=2007-06-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704104051/http://www.cycletownusa.com/post1953.html |archivedate=July 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were over 80 different makes of motorcycle available in Britain in the 1930s, from the familiar marques like [[Norton (motorcycle)|Norton]], Triumph and [[AJS]] to the obscure, with names like New Gerrard, NUT, SOS, Chell and Whitwood,&lt;ref name="British Motorcycles of the 1930s"&gt;{{cite web | title=British Motorcycles of the 1930s | work=www.webBikeWorld.com, webWorld International, LLC (2001-2007) | url=http://www.webbikeworld.com/books/british-motorcycles-1930.htm | accessdate=2007-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
about twice as many motorcycle makes competing in the world market during the early 21st century.

In 1937, Joe Petrali set a new [[land speed record]] of 136.183&amp;nbsp;mph (219.165&amp;nbsp;km/h) on a modified Harley-Davidson 61&amp;nbsp;cubic inch (1,000&amp;nbsp;cc) overhead valve-driven motorcycle.&lt;ref name="HD History: Timeline - 1930s"/&gt;
The same day, Petrali also broke the speed record for 45&amp;nbsp;cubic inch (737&amp;nbsp;cc) engine motorcycles.

In Europe, production demands, driven by the buildup to World War II, included motorcycles for military use, and [[Birmingham Small Arms Company#World War II|BSA]] supplied 126,000 [[BSA M20]] motorcycles to the British armed forces, starting in 1937 and continuing until 1950. Royal Enfield also produced motorcycles for the military, including a 125&amp;nbsp;cc lightweight motorcycle that could be dropped (in a parachute-fitted tube cage) from an aircraft.

===After World War II===
[[File:Vespasidecar.JPG|thumb|An original [[Vespa]] with [[sidecar]]]]
After the World War II, some American veterans found a replacement for the camaraderie, excitement, danger and speed of life at war in motorcycles. Grouped into loosely organized clubs, motorcycle riders in the US created a new social institution—the [[motorcyclist]]s or "bikers"—which was later skewed by the "outlaw" persona [[Marlon Brando]] portrayed in the 1953 film ''[[The Wild One]]''.&lt;ref name="Freedom and Postwar Mobility: 1946-1958"&gt;{{cite web |title=Freedom and Postwar Mobility: 1946-1958 | work=[[The Art of the Motorcycle]], Guggenheim Museum | url=http://pastexhibitions.guggenheim.org/motorcycle/motorcycle/1946-1958.html | accessdate=2014-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, on the other hand, post-war motorcycle producers were more concerned with designing practical, economical transportation than the social aspects, or "biker" image.&lt;ref name="Freedom and Postwar Mobility: 1946-1958"/&gt;
Italian designer [[Piaggio]] introduced the [[Vespa]] in 1946, which experienced immediate and widespread popularity. Imports from the UK, Italy and Germany, thus found a niche in US markets that American bikes did not fill.

The [[Birmingham Small Arms Company|BSA Group]] purchased Triumph Motorcycles in 1951 to become the largest producer of motorcycles in the world claiming "one in four".{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} The German [[NSU Motorenwerke AG|NSU]] was the largest manufacturer from 1955{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} until 1959 when [[Honda]] became the largest manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Cases in contemporary strategy analysis |first1= Robert M. |last1= Grant |first2= Kent E. |last2= Neupert |edition= 3rd |publisher= [[Wiley-Blackwell]] |year= 2003 |isbn= 1-4051-1180-1 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=XF7V9w8ByrcC&amp;pg=PA172 |accessdate= 2010-11-12 |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

[[File:ZweiRadMuseumNSU Triumph Bonneville.JPG|thumb|A 1962 Triumph Bonneville represents the popularity of British motorcycles at that time]]
British manufacturers Triumph, BSA, and [[Norton (motorcycle)|Norton]] retained a dominant position in some markets until the rise of the Japanese manufacturers, led by Honda, in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The role of the motorcycle shifted in the 1960s, from the tool of a life to a toy of a lifestyle. It became part of an image, of status, a cultural icon for individualism, a prop in Hollywood B-movies.&lt;ref name="An overview of the British motorcycle industry and its collapse"/&gt;

The motorcycle also became a recreational machine for sport and leisure, a vehicle for carefree youth, not essential transportation for the mature family man or woman, and the Japanese were able to produce modern designs more quickly, more cheaply, and of better quality than their competitors. Their motorbikes were more stylish and more reliable, so the British manufacturers fell behind as mass-market producers.

Honda, which was officially founded in Japan on September 24, 1948, introduced their [[SOHC]] [[inline-four engine]] [[Honda CB750|CB750]] in 1969, which was inexpensive and immediately successful.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} It established the across-the-frame-four engine configuration as a design with huge potential for power and performance. Shortly after the introduction of the SOHC, Kawasaki demonstrated the potential of the four-stroke four-cylinder engine with the introduction of the [[Kawasaki Z1|KZ900]].

[[Suzuki]], [[Kawasaki motorcycles|Kawasaki]] and the [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamaha]] each started producing motorcycles in the 1950s. Meanwhile, the sun was setting on British dominion over the big-displacement motorbike market.

===Japanese dominance===
[[File:Honda CB750a.JPG|thumb|The [[Honda CB750]] revolutionized motorcycle marketing and was emblematic of Japanese dominance]]
The excellence of Japanese motorcycles caused similar effects in all Western markets: many Italian bike firms either went bust or only just managed to survive. As a result, BMW's worldwide sales sagged in the 1960s, but came back strongly with the introduction of a completely redesigned [[BMW R75/5|"slash-5"]] series for model year 1970.

From the 1960s through the 1990s, small two-stroke motorcycles were popular worldwide, partly as a result of the pioneering work of the [[East German]] Daniel Zimmermann (rotary disc valve) and [[MZ Motorrad- und Zweiradwerk|MZ]]'s Walter Kaaden who developed the two-stroke expansion chamber in the 1950s. These ideas were taken up by Suzuki when [[Ernst Degner]], the MZ engineer and rider, defected to the West on 13 September 1961 after retiring from the 125cc Swedish Grand Prix at Kristianstad. Degner, an excellent engineer, immediately joined Suzuki and his knowledge became their technology springboard.

[[Harley-Davidson]] in the US at the time suffered from the same problems as the European firms, but its unique product range, American tariff laws and nationalism-driven customer loyalty allowed it to survive. One alleged flaw, however, was retaining the characteristic Harley-Davidson 45° [[V-twin|engine vee-angle]], which causes [[Engine balance|excess vibration]] as well as the loping Harley-Davidson sound.

A factory full fairing was introduced by BMW motorcycle in the R100RS of 1977, the first factory fairing produced in quantity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motorcycleclassics.com/motorcycle-reviews/2008-01-01/bmw-r100rs.aspx|title=1977 BMW R100RS |publisher=Motorcycle Classics|accessdate=2009-08-10|date=January–February 2008|author=Bill Stermer}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, BMW stimulated the "adventure touring" category of motorcycling with its [[dual-sport motorcycle|dual-sport]] model, the [[BMW R80G/S|R80G/S]]. In 1988, BMW was the first motorcycle manufacturer to introduce [[Anti-lock braking system|anti-lock-brakes (ABS)]] on its sporting K100RS-SE and K1 models.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

==The present==
[[File:ZX-7RR Wikepedia.jpg|thumb|left|A 2004 [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries|Kawasaki]] ZX-7RR]]
Today the Japanese manufacturers, Honda, Kawasaki, Suzuki, and Yamaha dominate the large motorcycle industry, although [[Harley-Davidson]] still maintains a high degree of popularity, particularly in the United States.

Recent years have seen a resurgence in the popularity around the world of many other motorcycle brands, including BMW, Triumph and [[Ducati]], and the emergence of [[Victory Motorcycles|Victory]] as a second successful mass-builder of big-twin American cruisers.

In November 2006, the Dutch company E.V.A. Products BV Holland announced that the first commercially available [[Diesel motorcycle|diesel-powered motorcycle]], its Track T-800CDI, achieved production status.&lt;ref name="The first commercially-available diesel motorcycle"&gt;{{cite web | title=The first commercially-available diesel motorcycle | work=www.Gizmag.com (November 20, 2006) | url=http://www.gizmag.com/go/6493/ | accessdate=2007-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Track T-800CDI uses an 800&amp;nbsp;cc three-cylinder Daimler Chrysler diesel engine. However, other manufacturers, including Royal Enfield, had been producing diesel-powered bikes since at least 1965.&lt;ref name="Diesel motorbikes"&gt;{{cite web | title=Diesel motorbikes | work=Journey to Forever | url=http://journeytoforever.org/biodiesel_bikes.html | accessdate=2007-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the developing world===
[[File:Scooters Bangkok Nana.jpg|thumb|Motorcycle traffic in [[Bangkok]]]]
There is a large demand for small, cheap motorcycles in the developing world, and many of the firms meeting that demand now also compete in mature markets, such as China's [[Hongdou (company)|Hongdou]] which makes a version of Honda's venerable [[Honda CG125|CG125]].&lt;ref name="Hongdou Group: Manufacturer &amp; Exporter . . ."&gt;{{cite web | title=Hongdou Group: Manufacturer &amp; Exporter . . . | work=International Department, Hongdou Motorcycle Co.

{{Science with neutrons}}

'''ISIS Neutron and Muon Source''' is a pulsed [[neutron]] and [[muon]] source.  It is situated at the [[Rutherford Appleton Laboratory]] of the [[Science and Technology Facilities Council]], on the [[Harwell Science and Innovation Campus]] in [[Oxfordshire]], United Kingdom. It uses the techniques of [[muon spin spectroscopy|muon spectroscopy]] and [[neutron scattering]] to probe the structure and dynamics of [[condensed matter]] on a microscopic scale ranging from the subatomic to the macromolecular.

Hundreds of experiments are performed every year the facility by researchers from around the world, in diverse science areas such as [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[materials engineering]], [[earth sciences]], [[biology]] and [[archaeology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/ISIS_AR_2017.pdf|title=ISIS Neutron and Muon Source Annual Review 2017|last=|first=|date=18 December 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Neutrons and muons==
Neutrons are uncharged constituents of [[atom]]s and penetrate materials well, deflecting only from the [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] of atoms. The statistical accumulation of deflected neutrons at different positions beyond the sample can be used to find the structure of a material, and the loss or gain of energy by neutrons can reveal the dynamic behaviour of parts of a sample, for example diffusive processes in solids. At ISIS the neutrons are created by accelerating 'bunches' of [[proton]]s in a [[synchrotron]], then colliding these with a heavy [[tungsten]] metal target, under a constant cooling load to dissipate the heat from the 160&amp;nbsp;kW proton beam. The impacts cause neutrons to [[spallation|spall]] off the tungsten atoms, and the neutrons are channelled through guides, or [[beamline]]s, to around 20 instruments, each individually optimised for the study of different types of interactions between the neutron beam and matter. The target station and most of the instruments are set in a large hall. Neutrons are a dangerous form of radiation, so the target and beamlines are heavily shielded with concrete.

ISIS Neutron and Muon Source produces [[muon]]s by colliding a fraction of the proton beam with a [[graphite]] target, producing [[pion]]s which decay rapidly into muons, delivered in a spin-polarised beam to sample stations.

==Science at ISIS Neutron and Muon Source==
ISIS Neutron and Muon Source is administered and operated by the [[Science and Technology Facilities Council]] (previously [[CCLRC]]). The Science and Technology Facilities council, or STFC, is part of [https://www.ukri.org/ UK Research and Innovation].  Experimental time is open to academic users from funding countries and is applied for through a twice-yearly 'call for proposals'. Research allocation, or 'beam-time', is allotted to applicants via a peer-review process. Users and their parent institutions do not pay for the running costs of the facility, which are as much as £11,000 per instrument per day. Their transport and living costs used to be refunded whilst carrying out the experiment, but aren't anymore. Most users stay in Ridgeway House, a hotel near the site, or at [[Cosener's House]], an STFC-run conference centre in [[Abingdon, Oxfordshire|Abingdon]]. Over 600 experiments by 1600 users are completed every year.

A large number of support staff operate the facility, aid users, and carry out research, the control room is staffed 24 hours a day, every day of the year. Instrument scientists oversee the running of each instrument and liaise with users, and other divisions provide sample environment, data analysis and computing expertise, maintain the accelerator, and run education programmes. ISIS is also one of the few neutron facilities to have a significant detector group that researches and develops new techniques for collecting data.

Among the important and pioneering work carried out was the discovery of the structure of high-temperature [[superconductor]]s and the solid phase of buckminster-fullerene. Other recent developments can be found [https://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/Science-Highlights.aspx here].

Construction for a second target station (TS2) started in 2003, and the first neutrons were delivered to the target on December 14, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ts-2.isis.rl.ac.uk/ ISIS Second Target Station Project] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050921222750/http://ts-2.isis.rl.ac.uk/ |date=September 21, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; TS2 uses low-energy neutrons to study [[condensed matter|soft condensed matter]], biological systems, advanced [[Composite material|composites]] and [[nanotechnology|nanomaterials]].

The [[International Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment]] (MICE) runs parasitically off the ISIS proton beam.

==History and background of ISIS Neutron and Muon Source==
The source was approved in 1977 for the RAL site on the [[Harwell Laboratory|Harwell]] campus and recycled components from earlier UK science programmes including the accelerator hall which had previously been occupied by the [[Nimrod (synchrotron)|Nimrod]] accelerator. The first beam was produced in 1984, and the facility was formally opened by the then Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] in October 1985.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060629065811/http://epubs.cclrc.ac.uk/bitstream/692/linacplahistory.pdf Linacs at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory]&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ISIS is not an acronym: it refers to the [[Isis|Ancient Egyptian goddess]] and the local name for the [[River Thames]]. The name was selected for the official opening of the facility in 1985, prior to this it was known as the SNS, or Spallation Neutron Source. The name was considered appropriate as Isis was a goddess who could restore life to the dead, and ISIS made use of equipment previously constructed for the [[Nimrod (synchrotron)|Nimrod]] and [[NINA (accelerator)|NINA]]  accelerators.

The second target station was given funding in 2003 by [[David Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury of Turville|Lord Sainsbury]], then science minister, and was completed in 2009, on time and budget, with the opening of 7 instruments. In April 2010, the [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills|Science Minister]], [[David Willetts]] gave a £21 million investment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Phase Two instruments|url=http://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/about-isis/target-station-2/phase-two-instruments8150.html|accessdate=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to build 4 new instruments, which are now all in their commissioning phase or fully scheduled instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/ISIS_AR_2017.pdf|title=ISIS Neutron and Muon Source Annual Review 2017|last=|first=|date=18 December 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

ISIS Neutron and Muon Source was originally expected to have an operational life of 20 years (1985 to 2005), but its continued success led to a process of refurbishment and further investment, intended to advance the facility and extend the life of ISIS through to 2030. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stfc.ukri.org/files/impact-publications/isis-neutron-and-muon-source-lifetime-impact-report/|title=ISIS Lifetime Impact Study, Volume 1 – Full Report|last=|first=|date=November 2016|website=stfc.ukri.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institute of Tropical Medicine''' ({{lang-fr|Institut de médecine tropicale}}) previously known as '''Prince Leopold Institute of Tropical Medicine''' is located in [[Antwerp]], [[Belgium]]. ITM is one of the world's leading institutes for training and research in [[tropical medicine]] and the organisation of health care in developing countries. It also delivers outpatient, clinical and preventive services in tropical pathologies and sexually transmitted diseases.

The institute has a strong reputation in biomedical, clinical and public health research, advanced education, travel medicine and care for HIV and Sexually Transmitted Infections, as well as capacity-building in developing countries. [[Peter Piot]] and colleagues at the institute were the first to demonstrate that AIDS was a tropical African disease. ITM has been recognized by the [[World Health Organization]] as a reference centre for [[Aids|AIDS]] research. ITM also is a national and international reference centre for a series of diseases and pathogens (such as the [[Ebola]] virus).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.itg.be/E|title=Institute of Tropical Medicine Antwerp|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At ITM, some 450 scientists and technicians do research on pathogens, patients and populations. Yearly, an average of 500 medical doctors, nurses and scientists follow advanced courses; some 120 young researchers are completing their PhD. Each year, the medical services handle around 35 000 consultations. The website www.travelhealth.be services more than 100 000 visitors a year.

More than 75% of its publications appear in the top-25% of journals in its field. (Scimago World Ranking, 2010)

ITM also carries out an extensive capacity strengthening program in developing countries, and is part of a large network of institutions in Africa, South America and Asia.

'''Intent''' is the desired outcome of a military operation. It is a key concept in 21st century [[military operations]] and is a vital element to facilitate [[Mission-type tactics|subordinates' initiative]]&lt;ref name="AGS1999"&gt;Alberts, D.S., Garstka, J.J. and Stein, F.P.

== Intent content ==
In the reviewed open military doctrine literature intent is a critical component for command and control. The many definitions that exist of intent are mostly similar but the actual intent content differs and is unclear. Intent content can mainly be found as concept descriptions in doctrinal handbooks relating to development or impact usage of intent.&lt;ref name="PMG" /&gt;

The following examples represent United Kingdom, Sweden, Canada, United States, and NATO doctrinal view of intent.
* [[British Army]] ''Doctrine'' defines it as "Intent is similar to purpose. A clear intent initiates a force’s purposeful activity. It represents what the commander wants to achieve and why; and binds the force together; it is the principal result of decision-making. It is normally expressed using effects, objectives and desired outcomes....The best intents are clear to subordinates with minimal amplifying detail."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Development, Concepts and Doctrine Centre (2010) Army Doctrine Publication – Operations Shrivenham, |location=UK |publisher=Ministry of Defence |url=http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/41903E11-B6F4-4351-853B-2C1C2839FE1B/0/ADPOperationsDec10.pdf |title=Operations|format=pdf |page=11 |chapter=6 Command of Operations }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Swedish Armed Forces – Integrated Dynamic Command and Control (IDC2) (Josefsson 2007)&lt;ref&gt;Josefsson, A. (2007) Ledningskoncept för integrerad dynamisk ledning (IDC2) C2 concept for integrated dynamic command and control. Stockholm: Swedish Armed Forces.&lt;/ref&gt; define intent to "Intent is a concise formulation of the overall goals and purpose. The focus is to describe operations, restrictions and resource allocation."
* Canadian Forces Joint Publication 5.0 (Chief of the Defence Staff 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;5E-2)&lt;ref&gt;Chief of the Defence Staff (2008) The Canadian Forces Operational Planning Process (OPP) Available at: http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2010/forces/D2-252-500-2008-eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; "Commander's Intent. This summary should provide the Commander's overall intent and establish the purpose of the plan. It is an important focusing statement for subordinate commanders. (1) Military Objectives. (2) Desired Military End-State. (3) Transition Conditions".
* US Field Manual 5.0 (U.S. Army 2010, para. 2-90)&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Army (2010) Field Manual 5.0 – The Operations Process U.S. Department of the Army. Available at: https://fas.org/irp/doddir/army/fm5-0.pdf [Accessed January 20, 2011].&lt;/ref&gt; constitute the US Army’s view on planning, preparing, executing, and assessing operations. "The commander’s intent is a clear, concise statement of what the force must do and the conditions the force must establish with respect to the enemy, terrain, and civil considerations that represent the desired end state ([[List of United States Army Field Manuals#FM 3-0|FM&amp;nbsp;3–0]]). The commander's intent succinctly describes what constitutes success for the operation. It includes the operation’s purpose and the conditions that define the end state. It links the mission, concept of operations, and tasks to subordinate units."
* NATO allied Joint publication 1 (AJP-01) (NATO 2010, para. 0538)&lt;ref&gt;NATO (2010) AJP-01 – Allied Joint Doctrine D. Brussels, Belgium: NATO. Available at: http://nsa.nato.int/nsa/zPublic/ap/AJP-01(D).pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; provide the keystone doctrine for the planning, execution and support of Allied joint operations. "The intent defines the end-state in relation to the factors of mission; adversary, operating environment, terrain, forces, time and preparation for future operations. As such, it addresses what results are expected from the operation, how these results might enable transition to future operations, and how, in broad terms, the Commander expects the force to achieve those results. Its focus is on the force as a whole. Additional information on how the force will achieve the desired results is provided only to clarify the Commander's intentions."
* US Joint Publication 3.0 (US Joint Chiefs of Staff 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;IV-25)&lt;ref&gt;US Joint Chiefs of Staff (2010) Joint Publication 3-0 – Joint Operations. March 2010. Available at: https://fas.org/irp/doddir/dod/jp3_0.pdf [Accessed January 20, 2011].&lt;/ref&gt; provides the doctrinal foundation and fundamental principles that guide the Armed Forces of the United States in the conduct of joint operations across the range of military operations. "Commander's intent is a clear and concise expression of the purpose of the operation and the military end state." and continues with "It also includes where the commander will accept risk during the operation. The initial intent statement normally contains the purpose and military end state as the initial inputs for the planning process."

In military doctrinal handbooks the identified intent artefacts generally express the initial state and situation, the desired end state and outcome, and how to get to the desired end state. Artefacts describing the initial situation are: own and other forces, adversaries, operating environment, terrain, time, preparation for future operations. Artefacts describing the outcome are: purpose, goals, mission, effects and end state. Artefacts describing how to reach the outcome are: concept of operations, tasks to subordinate units, risk willing, how results might enable transition to future operations, objectives, transition conditions, restrictions in conducting operations, allocation of resources, and expectations of force usage.

Another way to identify intent artefacts is from how people actually communicate intent. Klein (1998, pp.&amp;nbsp;225–29)&lt;ref name="K1998"&gt;Klein (1998, pp. 225–29)&lt;/ref&gt; present the results of information types that is identified in intent communication. The seven information types of intent are according to Klein (1998, p.&amp;nbsp;226):&lt;ref name="K1998" /&gt; (1) Purpose of task which describes why the task is performed, (2) objective of task, presents a picture of the desired outcome, (3) sequence of steps in the plan. Klein identifies this to be a source of problem since too detailed descriptions may limit the subordinates initiative, (4) rationale for plan includes all the information that where present when making the decision, (5) key decisions that may have to be made, i.e. if there is a choice to be made the commander can provide the intent in how he wants it to be conducted, (6) antigoals, describe unwanted outcomes, and (7) constraints and other considerations describes weather and rule of engagement etc.

=== Intent content definition ===
The doctrinal artefacts are mapped into the structure provided by Klein and the resulting seven facets are grouped in: (a) '''Initial Situation''' describing initial situation and state and consists of Kleins rationale for the plan, (b) '''Outcome''' is describing outcomes and consists of Kleins Purpose of task, objective of task, and antigoals, and (c) '''Execution''' that is describing how to reach the outcome and consists of Kleins sequence of steps, key decisions and constraints and other considerations.

Intent is then defined to consist of the following eight facets.
* '''Mission/Goal''' – The purpose of the task (the higher-level goals). It provides the rationale why the missions and task are to be executed. It is a high-level definition of the overall intent and is regularly stated in one sentence following on the form of Who, What, When, Where and Why. A Mission/Goal can be described by using the Actions, Effects or a compound State, i.e. situation. Mission/Goal belongs to the intent group outcome.
* '''End-State''' – The objective of the task in form of a representation of the desired outcome. The desired outcome is described as a state, e.g. completion of a task, the effects from tasks, or even the execution of tasks over time. The purpose is to provide a picture of the End-State. According to Klein (1998, p.&amp;nbsp;226) in his investigation, the end-state objective was only missing once in the thirty five examined Commander's intent statements. Effect is in this work defined as the physical and/or behavioural state of a system that results from an action, a set of actions, or another effect. The End State is a more detail description of the Mission/Goal statement and can be described in several sentences. An End State can be described by using the Actions, Effects or a compound State, i.e. situation. End State belongs to the intent group outcome.
* '''Sequence''' – The sequence of steps in the plan – This is the plan that describes what do in general terms such as Courses of Actions and Course of Effects. Sequence belongs to the intent group execution describing how to reach the desired outcome and include concept of operations, tasks to subordinate units, how results might enable the transition to future operations, allocation of resources, and expectations of force usage.
* '''Initial State''' – The situation that builds the rationale for the plan, what information was available, who was making the decisions, under what time pressure and similar circumstances. Initial State encompass own and other forces, adversaries, operating environment, terrain, time, preparation for future operations. Initial State belongs to the intent group initial situation.
* '''Key Decisions''' – The key decisions that may have to be made and guide the commander in how to make choices. Key Decisions belongs to the intent group execution and describes how to reach the desired outcome and encompass how results might enable the transition to future operations, transition conditions and expectations of force usage.
* '''Antigoals''' – Antigoals describe undesired outcomes. Antigoals are meaningful when to clarify alternatives action plans and what the resulting outcome might be. Antigoals are described in the same way as End State with the difference in that antigoals describe the unwanted outcome. In the surveyed doctrinal descriptions of intent, antigoals were not mentioned. Antigoals belong to the intent outcome.
* '''Constraints''' – Constraints and other considerations that should be taken into account and can vary from policy to weather and terrain. Constraints belongs to the intent group execution and encompass risk willing, restrictions in conducting operations, allocation of resources, and expectations of force usage.
* An eight facet '''Expressives''' is proposed in Gustavsson et al. (2008d;&lt;ref name="PMG2008d" /&gt; 2011&lt;ref name="PMG2011" /&gt;) to capture the style of organizations and commanders: experience, risk taking, use of power and force, diplomacy; ethics; norms; morale; creativity; and unorthodox behaviour. The use of ''Expressives'' can range from situations where participants (e.g. commanders) express their style to other participants (e.g. subordinates), or by Staff that develop models over the participants (commanders and subordinates) to be used in Course of Action development and war gaming. In both cases ''Expressives'' are a support to better understand the collaboration participants’ capabilities and conduct of operations.

== Intent in command and control ==
=== Commander's intent ===
'''Commander’s intent''' is an intent describing military focused operations and it is a publicly stated description of the end-state as it relates to forces (entities, people) and terrain, the purpose of the operation, and key tasks to accomplish. It is developed by a small group, e.g. staff, and a commander.

Commander's intent (CSI) plays a central role in military decision making and planning. CSI acts as a basis for staffs and subordinates to develop their own plans and orders to transform thought into action, while maintaining the overall intention of their commander.
The commander’s intent links the mission and concept of operations. It describes the end state and key tasks that, along with the mission, are the basis for subordinates’ initiative. Commanders may also use the commander’s intent to explain a broader purpose beyond that of the mission statement. The mission and the commander’s intent must be understood two echelons down. (U.S Army 2003, para. 4-27)&lt;ref name="FM6"/&gt;
Pigeau and McCann (2006)&lt;ref name="P2006"&gt;Pigeau, R. and McCann, C. (2006) Establishing Common Intent: The Key to Co-Ordinated Military Action. In: The Operational Art : Canadian Perspectives : Leadership and Command, 2006, Kingston, Ontario, Canada: Canadian Defence Academy Press, pp. 85–108.&lt;/ref&gt; state that intent is more than an aim or a purpose; they state that Intent contains the aim and purpose together with all implications. Hence, CSI is not only to describe the End-State but also a concise expression of the purpose of the operation. CSI may also include the commander's assessment of the adversary commander's intent and an assessment of where and how much risk is acceptable during the operation. This view is supported by Klein (1998, p.&amp;nbsp;225)&lt;ref&gt;Klein, G. (1998) Sources of Power - How People Make Decisions Cambridge, MA: The Mit Press. {{ISBN|0-262-11227-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
CSI originates from one commander’s mind and is disseminated to the echelons below. CSI rarely gets reviewed and updated. For a short duration mission, such as a deliberate attack, the original statement may remain valid throughout planning. But for longer phases, in order to be agile the CSI might be changing in phase with the unfolding of the situation. Commanders must develop their intent within the bounds of a whole hierarchy of guiding principles that limit the types of solutions that they can entertain (Pigeau &amp; McCann 2006).&lt;ref name="P2006"/&gt;

=== Common intent ===
'''Common intent''' is an intent that is shared and understood by all participants, i.e. there is no discrepancy between the intent of the participating humans. Common intent is an idealized view of intent.

In today’s operational environment teams need to work together towards a desired End-State. Pigeau and McCann (2000)&lt;ref name="P2000"&gt;Pigeau, R. and McCann, C. (2000) "Redefining Command and Control". In: R. Pigeau and C. McCann, (eds.) ''The Human in Command: Exploring the Modern Military Experience'', 2000, New York, NY, USA: Academic/Plenum Publishers, pp. 165–84. {{ISBN|978-0-306-46366-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; define Command and Control: “Command and Control: The establishment of common intent to achieve coordinated action”. Common intent is the combination of explicit intent and implicit intent. Pigeau and McCann (2006)&lt;ref name="P2006"/&gt; put forward that for a realizable Common Intent there need to be a single shared objective, together with a clear understanding in how that objective can be attained. They continue that Common Intent is an idealized concept where maximum overlap, with minimum scattering, exists between the intent of the commander and the intents of his subordinates. Knowledge known by the commander and his subordinates needs to be shared at all levels, guiding principles, reasoning ability, and to express similar levels of commitment. Intent is then not only something for a commander to disseminate but to exchange and learning the team members’ intent.
Farrell and Lichacz (2004)&lt;ref name="F2004"&gt;Farrell, P.S.E. and Lichacz, F. (2004) "Measuring Common Intent during Effects Based Planning". In: ''2004 Command and Control Research and Technology Symposium The Power of Information Age Concepts and Technologies''.&lt;/ref&gt; state that common intent describes a socio-psychological phenomenon that seems to be evident amongst a team that achieves a common objective. The CSI is a sort of a one person’s view, but as said in the introduction “every individual have intent of her own” implies that it may not just be enough to disseminate intent amongst staff members and subordinates. A conclusion of the work of Farrell (2006)&lt;ref name="F2006"&gt;Farrell, P.S.E. (2006) "Common Intent and Information Processing Frameworks applied to Effect Based Approaches to Operations". In: 2006, Cambridge, UK: CCRP.&lt;/ref&gt; is that teams with different military and civilian cultures would need that all team members establish a common understanding of the mission objectives and the Commander's intent with respect to their own competencies, authorities, and responsibilities.
Pigeau and McCann (2006, pp.&amp;nbsp;85–108)&lt;ref name="P2006"/&gt; state that diverse team members need to have a high degree of common intent to perform effectively. In such teams the commander needs to ensure that the intent is perceived and understood by all team members (Pigeau &amp; McCann 2000;&lt;ref name="P2000"/&gt; Farrell &amp; Lichacz 2004;&lt;ref name="F2004"/&gt; Pigeau &amp; McCann 2006;&lt;ref name="P2006"/&gt; Farrell 2006&lt;ref name="F2006"/&gt;).
Alberts and Hayes (2007)&lt;ref name="A2007"/&gt; say that in order to allow subordinates’ initiative the operations order focuses on describing the CSI/CI so that flexibility in coordination and collaboration in the dynamic environment is entailed. There is a need for the commander to connect the subordinates’ human potential (reason, opinions, questions, seek information regarding the mission) to align and be a support to the commanders own intent (Pigeau &amp; McCann 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;102).&lt;ref name="P2006"/&gt;

=== Command intent ===
'''Command intent''' (CI) is a practical view of common intent, meaning that it is not plausible to expect that all individuals during a whole mission in all situations will share the same intent. CI will be developed for specific parts of missions and shared amongst the participants. To establish CI the involvement of all participants is necessary, e.g. compare with football or soccer teams where the overall intent is formalized by coaches in collaboration with the players and where each player knows what the other players’ intentions are.

Pigeau and McCann (2000)&lt;ref name="P2000"/&gt; states that “In reality, it is presumed true that it is impossible to have common intent”. For a specific mission bounded for a certain time an overlap of intent ought to be achievable, e.g. as illustrated by the players in a soccer team where all have individual goals with their lives and families, but on the soccer field they have the common intent to win the game. This means that during the game, and in training and exercises prior to and after the game their common intent is to perform well according to the mission declared by the coach (Farrell &amp; Lichacz 2004;&lt;ref name="F2004"/&gt; Farrell 2006;&lt;ref name="F2006"/&gt; Gustavsson et al. 2008d).&lt;ref name="PMG2008d"&gt;Gustavsson, P.M., Hieb, M.R., Niklasson, L., Eriksson, P. and Moore, P. (2008d) "Machine Interpretable Representation of Commander's Intent". In: ''Proceedings of the 13th International Command and Control Research and Technology Symposium (ICCRTS)''. Bellevue, Washington, USA. Available at: http://www.dodccrp.org/events/13th_iccrts_2008/CD/html/papers/188.pdf. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;
A workable version of common intent is command intent that is directed for a specific situation, bounded by participating organization, space and time, i.e. for the operation at hand the intent is common but other intent and goals of the participating humans may differ. Much of the coordination can be done locally, i.e. on a lower level, without explicit orders. Brehmer (2009)&lt;ref name="B2009"&gt;Brehmer, B. (2009) "Command without Commanders". In: June 2009, Washington D.C.: CCRP.&lt;/ref&gt; proposes that the higher levels of command will have the time to consider other aspects of the problems facing them. Brehmer continues that there is the loss of combat power inherent in top-down command-directed synchronization. By NATO Network Enabled Capabilities (NNEC) as presented by Alberts, Garstka &amp; Stein (1999, pp.&amp;nbsp;87–93)&lt;ref name="AGS1999"/&gt; this is overcome by a high-speed continuum. Brehmer (2009)&lt;ref name="B2009"/&gt; however says that the main responsibility of the commander and his staff is to articulate intent and crafting rules of engagement. For armed forces that have mission command as their principal doctrine this is not a new concept, but Brehmer further envisions that with articulated intent larger units will be able to co-ordinate with other units and conduct the mission without any explicit directions from higher headquarters. Command Intent is then an outline of a plan, objectives to be achieved, responsibilities, linkages and schemas of manoeuvre, and constraints. Establishing command intent also involves more than one person. Traditional Commander's intent is then replaced by an intent that arises from dialogue between commanders and key staff at more than one level.
Command intent is to allow self-synchronization and to provide understanding of the complex causes and effects. To enable self-synchronization the subordinates must be given the mandate to operate on their own initiatives, within the boundary of the mission. In “Rethinking Command and Control” by Curts and Cambell (2006),&lt;ref&gt;Curts, R.J. and Cambell, D.E. (2006) "Rethinking Command and Control". In: March 2006, San Diego, CA: CCRP. Available at: http://www.dodccrp.org/events/2006_CCRTS/html/papers/005.pdf [Accessed March 16, 2009].&lt;/ref&gt; the authors address this fine line between delegating authority and maintaining and controlling hierarchy The commander delegating authority must refrain from directing the actions of subordinates, yet must also maintain some command structure. The subordinates must have the ability to work independently or within a team to achieve the mission goals. To create this empowerment the commander’s information should be shared with everyone. Autonomy is created by [[setting boundaries]] and hierarchy then can be replaced by self-directed teams. CI acts as a basis for staffs and subordinates to develop their own plans and orders that transform thought into action, while maintaining the overall intention of their commanders (Gustavsson et al. 2008d;&lt;ref name="PMG2008d"/&gt; 2009&lt;ref&gt;Gustavsson, P.M. and Hieb, M.R. (2009) "Supporting Collaboration in Collective Endeavours with a Model of Operations Intent and Effects". In: ''Proceedings of the 14th International Command and Control Research and Technology Symposium'', June 2009, Washington D.C.: CCRP. Available at: http://www.dodccrp.org/events/14th_iccrts_2009/papers/055.pdf. 055.&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== Explicit and implicit intent ===
'''Explicit intent''' is an intent that is publicly stated and made available for the participants. '''Implicit intent''' is an intent that is not publicly stated. Implicit intent can be made explicit by the mechanism described below.

Shattuck and Woods (2000)&lt;ref name="S2000"&gt;Shattuck, L.G. and Woods, D.D. (2000) "Communication Of Intent In Military Command and Control Systems". In: C. McCann and R. Pigeau, (eds.) ''The Human in Command: Exploring the Modern Military Experience'', Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, pp. 279–92. Available at: http://csel.eng.ohio-state.edu/woods/C2/shattuck_Nato.pdf [Accessed July 14, 2008].&lt;/ref&gt; examined the role of communicating intent. In the study, company commanders received a battalion order including the battalion Commander's intent. Then changes to the situation were introduced and the actions performed by the company commanders were compared with the intent of the battalion commander. The result was that the company commanders matched their battalion commander's intent in only 34% of the cases.
Pigeau and McCann (2000)&lt;ref name="P2000"/&gt; introduced that intent consists of an explicit part and an implicit part.

'''Explicit intent''' is the one that is publicly stated for all the headquarters (HQ) staff and subordinates to perceive, think about, and act upon. The explicit intent is either vocalized (i.e. made publicly) in doctrine, orders, statements or can be derived from questions and answers. Theoretically, each staff and subordinate member should be able to reiterate the commander’s intent at any point during the process.

'''Implicit intent''' consists of all the un-vocalized expectations that the commander and all team members have. The implicit intent is developed over a longer time, prior to the mission, and develops from the style of how the commander is conducting the operations with respect to experience, risk willing, use of power and force, diplomacy, ethics, social values, moral, norms, creativity and unorthodox behaviour and the concepts, policies, laws and doctrine agreed to by military, civil, organizations, agencies, nations and coalitions.
Farell and Lichacz (2004)&lt;ref name="F2004"/&gt; proposed that implicit intent is an internal expectation of Commander's intent. The example used by Farell &amp; Lichacz (2004)&lt;ref name="F2004"/&gt; is that with an explicit intent “to capture the hill” the implicit intent might be “to capture the hill with minimal battle damage” or “to capture the hill with Air Force assets only.” The implicit expectations depend on how the members interpret Commander's intent from personal expectations based on their style and experience, (Pigeau &amp; McCann 2000),&lt;ref name="P2000"/&gt; and with the staff position (e.g., planner, operator, commander, etc.), (cf. Farrell &amp; Lichacz 2004).&lt;ref name="F2004"/&gt; Farell and Lichacz (2004)&lt;ref name="F2004"/&gt; provided a way of finding implicit intent by asking questions of the form “from perspective x, how do you interpret Commander’s intent?”
Implicit intent can be made explicit by transforming the implicit into explicit statements. The commander can vocalize the Personal, Military or Cultural implicit intent. The commander can be monitored, e.g. by his subordinates, and his team members, who then draw conclusions about the commanders implicit intent. In the same way a commander can draw conclusions regarding his subordinates. Pigeau and McCann (2000)&lt;ref name="P2000"/&gt; presented some mechanisms of making original implicit intent made explicit. They are: (1) Externalization is when a commander or subordinate make the internal intents explicit declared; (2) Internalization is a version of tacit learning, when a commander presents the intent and the mouth is saying something and the body language signals something different, or add context and meaning that are put into the mental model and affects the implicit intent; (3) Socialization is meeting and talking and performing exercises together, teaming, i.e. is to find the implicit intent and motives etc.; and (4) Dialogue is the explicit stated, publicly vocalized available description of an individual’s intent.

==Questions of foreplay and oral sex==
There are differences of opinion in this topic. Many scholars believe that oral sex is permissible, but it is disliked. The group of scholars who view oral-genital contact as permissible is mostly because there is no clear command in [[Hadith]] and [[Qur'an]] prohibiting such act. Prominent Muslim scholars like [[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]] share this view.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onislam.net/english/ask-the-scholar/family/intimate-relations/174682-islams-stance-on-oral-sex.html Yusuf's view]&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, there is no mentioning of such act as a part of foreplay in Hadith although Islam stresses on the importance of foreplay, as kissing, touching and the like are explicitly mentioned in Hadith.&lt;ref name="kiss"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kissing and Foreplay|url=http://www.central-mosque.com/fiqh/kissf.htm|work=Darul Iftaa|publisher=Central-Mosque.com|accessdate=8 July 2012|author=Muhammad ibn Adam al-Kawthari|date=14 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual intercourse has to be avoided unless foreplay takes place according to [[Sunnah]].&lt;ref name="foreplay 1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Basic bedroom fiqh|url=http://www.themodernreligion.com/misc/sex/sex-basic-fiqh.html|work=Hanafi fiqh|publisher=The Modern Religion|accessdate=8 July 2012|author=Sidi Faraz Rabbani}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muhammad]] forbade acting like an animal with one's wife which indicates sexual intercourse without foreplay.&lt;ref name="kiss" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kiss 2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kissing and Foreplay in Islam|url=http://www.zawaj.com/articles/kissing-and-foreplay.html|work=Sex in Islam|publisher=Zawaj.com|accessdate=8 July 2012|author=Muhammad ibn Adam al-Kawthari}}&lt;/ref&gt; The husband is also responsible for satisfying the wife's need (i.e. bringing her to an orgasm) as part of a healthy marriage and to ensure the right of the wife.&lt;ref name="kiss 2" /&gt; During foreplay and intercourse, the husband is allowed to take pleasure from the wife's breast, in Hanafi school of thought it is permissible as long as no secretion (i.e. milk) is consumed during this act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Drinking one's wife's milk, during foreplay or intercourse|url=http://www.themodernreligion.com/misc/sex/sex-wifes-milk.html|work=Hanafi fiqh list|publisher=The Modern Religion|accessdate=8 July 2012|author=Sidi Faraz Rabbani}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the majority of the scholars, including from Hanbali, Shafi and Malaki school of thought have agreed that accidentally consuming breast milk will not affect the relationship between husband and wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islamqa.info/en/2864|title=What is the ruling on drinking one’s wife’s milk? - islamqa.info|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamweb.net/emainpage/index.php?page=showfatwa&amp;Option=FatwaId&amp;Id=84646|title=Husband drinking milk from his wifes breast|publisher=|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is permissible in Islam for the husband and wife to touch their private parts in order to arouse each other.&lt;ref name="foreplay 1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="qna"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themodernreligion.com/misc/sex/sex_qna.html|title=Sexual Relations Between Husband &amp; Wife|first=|last=FAREENA|publisher=|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mututal {{sic|hide=y|nolink=y|reason=spelling error in source|mututal}} masturbation between spouses|url=http://www.themodernreligion.com/misc/sex/sex-mutual-masturbation.html|work=Hanafi fiqh list|publisher=The Modern Religion|accessdate=8 July 2012|author=Sidi Faraz Rabbani}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Questions on married life|url=http://fiqhanswers.blogspot.com/2007/10/questions-on-married-life.html|work=Fiqh Q&amp;A|publisher=Hanafi Fiqh|accessdate=8 July 2012|date=19 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Etiquettes of Marriage|url=http://islamworld.net/resources/326|work=IslamWorld|publisher=Islam World/marriage.html|accessdate=8 July 2012|date=4 October 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618122115/http://islamworld.net/resources/326|archivedate=18 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===On touching the penis===
There are commentaries on touching the male genital by oneself in various narrations of Hadith. One example is the hadith of Basrah bint Safwaan, who heard Muhammad say: "Whoever touches his private parts, let him do [[Wudu|wudoo]] (washing)’." (Narrated by Abu Dawood, al-Tahaarah, 154. al-Albaani said in Saheeh Sunan Abi Dawood, no. 166, it is saheeh).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Changing one’s clothes does not break wudoo’|url=http://www.islam-qa.com/en/ref/14321|work=Islam Q and A|publisher=[[IslamQA]]|accessdate=8 July 2012|author=Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Hanafi]] [[jurist]]s claim touching the penis in [[Sharia|Islamic Law]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Touching the Penis in Islamic Law|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.1086/429229?uid=3739136&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=47699122405497|work=Chicago Journal|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|accessdate=8 July 2012|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; is not a [[shame]]ful act. The [[Sahih]] Hadith of ''al-Muwatta'' [[Muhammad al-Shaybani|Imam Muhammad]] argues that "The act is not impure". He emphasizes that "If the penis were vile or impure, it should be cut off from the body and thrown away". The Hadith claims that there is no difference between the penis and the other parts of body. However, there are also Sahih Hadith&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://seekerselite.com/wudu-touching-private-parts/|title=Wudu After touching the Private Parts - Seekers Elite|work=Seekers Elite|access-date=2017-09-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; which mentions the performing of [[Ritual purification|ablution]] is compulsory after the touching of the sexual organ.
The first and second of these reports are related to the oft-cited report, given on the authority of Talq b. ؛Ali [b. al-Mundhir b. Qays], concerning the saying of Muhammad about the penis. Talq b. ؛Ali said: "We were with the Apostle of God when a man, like a [[Bedouin]], came to him and said: "Oh Apostle of God, what do you think about a man touching his penis after performing [[wudu]]?" Muhammad said: "What is it but a piece of your flesh?". {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} There is some disagreement about this report and as noted above, the strongest evidence for making ablution after touching one's penis comes from Basrah bint Safwaan's account of Muhammad saying "Whoever touches his genitals, let him do wudoo’."
It is also reported that Muhammad said:

# "Whenever anyone of you makes water (urinates) he should not hold his penis or clean his private parts with his right hand." ([[Sahih Bukhari]], 1.4.156)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/004.sbt.html Translation of Sahih Bukhari] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525070903/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/bukhari/004.sbt.html |date=2011-05-25 }} Book 4: Ablutions (Wudu')&lt;/ref&gt;
# "When anyone amongst you enters the privy he should not touch his penis with his right hand." ([[Sahih Muslim]], 2.0512)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/muslim/002.smt.html Translation of Sahih Muslim] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513235949/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/hadith/muslim/002.smt.html |date=2011-05-13 }} Book 2: The Book of Purification (Kitab Al-Taharah&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to sexual gratification==

===Alternative views: Oral sex as foreplay===
Oral sex (oral-genital contact) is considered as a part of foreplay by those who allow it, not as an alternative to vaginal intercourse.&lt;ref name="qna"/&gt; One group of [[Salafi]] scholars and [[Shafi`i]] school says that oral sex is ''halal'' (permissible) because of the [[hadith]] in which he encouraged [[foreplay]] between spouses, and that these are naturally gratifying activities that will help them have a better marriage.

Dr. [[Heba Kotb]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Dr. Heba Kotb|url=http://www.hebakotb.net/en/About|work=Dr.Heba Kotb|publisher=Dr.Heba Kotb|accessdate=8 July 2012|language=Arabic, English|date=20 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717080351/http://www.hebakotb.net/en/About|archivedate=17 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Sunni female scholar{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} who gives sex advice on [[Egypt]]ian TV, said that oral sex is allowed "since there is no religious text banning it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Muslim Woman Gives Sex Advice on Arab TV|url=http://www.religionnewsblog.com/16710/muslim-woman-gives-sex-advice-on-arab-tv|work=SFGate.com, USA|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=8 July 2012|author=Nadia Abou El-Magd|date=3 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; She considers oral sex as a part of foreplay on this ground that Islam "stresses the importance of foreplay".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual Revolution in Islam?|url=http://steelturman.typepad.com/thesteeldeal/2006/12/sexual_revoluti.html|work=The Steel's Brain|publisher=The Steel's Brain|accessdate=9 July 2012|date=12 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Avoiding secretions===
Schools of thought ([[Madh'hab]]) such as [[Shafi'i]] and [[Hanbali]] consider fellatio as permissible but only as part of foreplay while all [[Madh'hab|schools]] regard genital secretion as [[Ritual purity in Islam|impure]]. Oral sex is permitted provided that secretion from the genitalia is not consumed and no injury or infliction made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Questions On Sexuality|url=http://www.livingislam.org/fiqhi/fiqha_e92.html|work=living ISLAM – Islamic Tradition|publisher=www.livingislam.org|accessdate=9 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consumption of semen on the other hand is believed to be not permissible by some scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askthescholar.com/question-details.aspx?qstID=684|title=Ask The Scholar|publisher=|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamicity.com/qa/action.lasso.asp?-db=services&amp;-lay=Ask&amp;-op=eq&amp;number=43425&amp;-format=detailpop.shtml&amp;-find|title=IslamiCity.com - Q &amp; A|publisher=|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the stronger view is that it is not allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamweb.net/emainpage/index.php?page=showfatwa&amp;Option=FatwaId&amp;Id=89730|title=Swallowing semen|publisher=|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple has to rinse their mouth afterwards to maintain cleanliness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is oral sex permitted?|url=http://www.themodernreligion.com/misc/sex/sex-oral.html|work=Hanbali Fiqh list|publisher=The Modern Religion|accessdate=9 July 2012|author=Sidi Musa Furber}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bathing (ghusl) after oral sex===
According to alternative views, oral sex is only permitted as a way of stimulation and foreplay. If a husband does have oral sex with his wife, and ejaculates semen, then [[ghusl]] is obligatory according to [[Islamic sexual hygienical jurisprudence]]; however, if he only releases Madhy ([[Pre-ejaculate|pre-ejaculatory fluids]]) then Wudu is only required, and has to wash the Madhy away.

The '''Learning assistant model''' is a model for improving the recruitment and education of [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] teachers. It was established in 2003 at the [[University of Colorado Boulder]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/02/04/461942790/making-science-teaching-more-than-a-backup-plan |title=Making Science Teaching More Than 'A Backup Plan' |last=Kamenetz |first=Anya |date=February 4, 2016 |website=npr.org |publisher=NPR |access-date=February 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to achieve three related goals: (1) to recruit and improve the preparation of future mathematics and science teachers, (2) to improve the education of all students enrolled in our mathematics and science courses, and (3) to engage science faculty more thoroughly in the preparation of future teachers.

The LA model was initiated as a part of the STEM Colorado project headed by Richard McCray. The impetus behind the LA model was data that most students under perform in science, technology, engineering and mathematical (STEM) subjects [1,2], that many of our teachers having neither a major nor minor in their field [3], and that large research universities are not producing adequate numbers of mathematics and science teachers [4].

The Learning Assistant model is based on the premise that teacher preparation begins with training in a specific STEM discipline.  It then encourages students to consider a career in education through a modest stipend,first hand teaching experiences, and a specially designed education seminar course.  Typically, LAs facilitate small group interactions in large-enrollment courses, and at the same time, they make up the pool from which we recruit new K-12 teachers.

The required Mathematics and Science Education Seminar aims to help LAs integrate content, pedagogy, and practice, and is taught by a faculty member from the School of Education and a K12 teacher. In this course students investigate relevant educational literature, and engage in in-depth discussions about their own teaching and learning. Seminar readings and discussions include topics such as discussion techniques, learning theory, cooperative learning, student [[epistemological|epistemologies]], metacognition and argumentation, self-explanations and tutoring, multiple intelligences and differentiated instruction, the nature of science and mathematics, national standards, teaching with technology, and qualities of an effective teacher.

Because the point of the LA model is to enhance the recruitment of well-trained students in the teaching profession, a student can continue as an LA only if s/he shows commitment to finding out more about teaching.  The outcomes of the LA project at UC Boulder are currently being evaluated through research on improvements in discipline-specific and pedagogical content knowledge and the number of new teachers recruited and retained.

'''Legal psychology''' involves [[empirical]], [[psychology|psychological]] research of the law, legal institutions, and people who come into contact with the law. Legal psychologists typically take basic social and cognitive principles and apply them to issues in the legal system such as [[eyewitness memory]], jury decision-making, investigations, and interviewing. The term "legal psychology" has only recently come into usage, primarily as a way to differentiate the [[experimental research|experimental]] focus of legal psychology from the [[clinical psychology|clinically]]-oriented [[forensic psychology]].

Together, legal psychology and forensic psychology form the field more generally recognized as "psychology and law". Following earlier efforts by psychologists to address legal issues, psychology and law became a field of study in the 1960s as part of an effort to enhance justice, though that originating concern has lessened over time.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dennis R. Fox]] (1999). [http://dennisfox.net/papers/injustice.html Psycholegal Scholarship's Contribution to False Consciousness About Injustice.]''[[Law and Human Behavior]], 23,'' 9-30.&lt;/ref&gt; The multidisciplinary [[American Psychological Association]]'s Division 41, the [[American Psychology-Law Society]], is active with the goal of promoting the contributions of [[psychology]] to the understanding of [[law]] and [[legal system]]s through [[research]], as well as providing education to psychologists in legal issues and providing  education to legal personnel on psychological issues. Further, its mandate is to  inform the psychological and legal communities and the public at large  of current research, educational, and service in the area of psychology and law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.ap-ls.org/
|title=American Psychology and the Law Society
|accessdate=2007-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are similar societies in Britain and Europe.

==Areas of research==
Generally speaking, any research that combines psychological principles with legal applications or contexts could be considered legal psychology (although research involving [[clinical psychology]], e.g., mental illness, [[competency evaluation (law)|competency]], [[insanity defense]], [[offender profiling]], etc., is typically categorized as [[forensic psychology]], and not legal psychology). For a time, legal psychology researchers were primarily focused on issues related to [[eyewitness testimony]] and jury decision-making; so much so, that the editor of ''[[Law and Human Behavior]]'', the premier legal psychology journal, implored researchers to expand the scope of their research and move on to other areas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael J. Saks]] (1986). The Law Does Not Live on Eyewitness Testimony Alone. ''[[Law and Human Behavior]], 10'', 279-280.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several legal psychology [[academic journal|journal]]s, including ''[[Law and Human Behavior]]'', ''[[Psychology, Public Policy and Law]]'', ''Psychology, Crime, and Law'', and ''Journal of Psychiatry, Psychology and Law'' that focus on general topics of [[criminology]], and the [[criminal justice system]]. In addition, research by legal psychologists is regularly published in more general journals that cover both basic and applied research areas.

In March 1893 J. McKeen Cattell posted questions to fifty-six of his students at Columbia University, the questions he asked his students were comparable to those asked in a court of justice. What he found was that it was reasonable to conclude eyewitness accounts of events were unreliable. His students were all sure they were mostly correct, even when they weren’t, and some were hesitant when they were in fact correct.  He could not figure out specifically why each student had inaccurate testimonies. Cattell suggested that “an unscrupulous attorney” could discredit a witness who is being truthful by asking “cunningly selected questions”. Although a jury, or the judge, should know how normal errors are in eyewitness testimonies given different conditions. However, even Cattell was shocked by the level of incorrectness displayed by his students. Cattell’s research has been depicted as the foundation of forensic psychology in the United States. His research is still widely considered a prevailing research interest in legal psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/1118348419Psychol|title=The Handbook of Forensic Psychology, 4th Edition|last=Irving Weiner|last2=Randy Otto|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been thought that in America psychologists have been used as expert witnesses in court testimonies since the early 1920’s. Consultation within civil courts was most common, during this time criminal courts rarely consulted with psychologists. Psychologists were not considered medical experts, those who were like, physicians and psychiatrists, in the past were the ones consulted for criminal testimonies. This could be because in criminal cases, the defendant's mental state almost never  mattered "As a general rule, only medical men — that is, persons licensed by law to practice the profession of medicine — can testify as experts on the question of insanity; and the propriety of this general limitation is too patent to permit discussion".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/1118348419Psychol|title=The Handbook of Forensic Psychology, 4th Edition|last=Irving Weiner|last2=Randy Otto|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training and education==
Legal psychologists typically hold a [[PhD]] in some area of psychology (e.g., [[clinical psychology]], [[social psychology (psychology)|social psychology]], [[cognitive psychology]], etc.), and apply their knowledge of that field to the law. Although formal legal training (such as a [[Juris Doctor|JD]] or Master of Legal Studies degree) can be beneficial, most legal psychologists hold only the PhD. In fact, some argue{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} that specialized legal training dilutes the psychological empiricism of the researcher. For instance, to understand how eyewitness memory "works", a psychologist should be concerned with memory processes as a whole, instead of only the aspects relevant to the law (e.g., lineups, accuracy of testimony).

A growing number of universities offer specialized training in legal psychology as either a standalone [[PhD]] program or a joint [[Juris Doctor|JD]]/PhD program. A list of American universities that offer graduate training in legal psychology can be found [http://ap-ls.org/education/GraduatePrograms.php here] on the website of the [http://www.ap-ls.org/ American Psychology-Law Society].

==Roles of a legal psychologist==
===Academics and research===
Many legal psychologists work as [[professors]] in university psychology departments, criminal justice departments or law schools. Like other professors, legal psychologists generally conduct and publish empirical research, teach various classes, and mentor graduate and undergraduate students. Many legal psychologists also conduct research in a more general area of psychology (e.g., social, clinical, cognitive) with only a tangential legal focus. Those legal psychologists who work in law schools almost always hold a [[Juris Doctor|JD]] in addition to a [[PhD]]

===Expert witnesses===
{{Main|Expert witness}}
Psychologists specifically trained in legal issues, as well as those with no formal training, are often called by legal parties to testify as expert witnesses. In criminal trials, an expert witness may be called to testify about eyewitness memory, [[mistaken identity]], competence to stand trial, the propensity of a [[death-qualified jury]] to also be "pro-guilt", etc. Psychologists who focus on clinical issues often testify specifically about a defendant's competence, intelligence, etc. More general testimony about perceptual issues (e.g., adequacy of police sirens) may also come up in trial.

Experts, particularly psychology experts, are often accused of being "hired guns" or "stating the obvious".{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Eyewitness memory experts, such as [[Elizabeth Loftus]], are often discounted by judges and lawyers with no empirical training because their research utilizes undergraduate students and "unrealistic" scenarios.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} If both sides have psychological witnesses, jurors may have the daunting task of assessing difficult scientific information.

===Policy making and legislative guidance===
Psychologists employed at public policy centers may attempt to influence legislative policy or may be called upon by state (or national) lawmakers to address some policy issue through empirical research. A psychologist working in public policy might suggest laws or help to evaluate a new legal practice (e.g., eyewitness lineups).&lt;ref&gt;Examples of legal psychologists in these positions can be found at the [[American Bar Foundation]] ([http://www.abf-sociolegal.org/ Website]) and [[Federal Judicial Center]] ([http://www.fjc.gov Website]), among others.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advisory roles===
Legal psychologists may hold advisory roles in court systems. They may advise legal decision makers, particularly judges, on psychological findings pertaining to issues in a case. The psychologist who acts as a court adviser provides similar input to one acting as an expert witness, but acts out of the domain of an [[adversarial system]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [http://www.aaas.org/spp/case/case.htm Court Appointed Scientific Expert Program] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229052858/http://www.aaas.org/spp/case/case.htm |date=2008-02-29 }}, [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amicus briefs===
Psychologists can provide an [[amicus brief]] to the court. The [[American Psychological Association]] has provided briefs concerning mental illness, retardation and other factors. The amicus brief usually contains an opinion backed by scientific citations and statistics. The impact of an amicus brief by a psychological association is questionable. For instance, Justice Powell&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0435_0223_ZC2.html Ballew v. Georgia&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; once called a reliance on statistics "numerology" and discounted results of several empirical studies. Judges who have no formal scientific training also may critique experimental methods, and some feel that judges only cite an amicus brief when the brief supports the judge's personal beliefs.

===Trial consulting===
Some legal psychologists work in [[trial consulting]]. No special training nor certification is needed to be a trial consultant, though an advanced degree is generally welcomed by those who would hire the trial consultant. The American Society of Trial Consultants does have a code of ethics for members, but there are no legally binding ethical rules for consultants.&lt;ref&gt;An overview of the trial consulting process is provided by the [[American Society of Trial Consultants]], [http://www.astcweb.org/ ASTC Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some psychologists who work in academics are hired as trial consultants when their expertise can be useful to a particular case. Other psychologists/consultants work for or with established trial consultant firms. The practice of law firms hiring "in-house" trial consultants is becoming more popular, but these consultants usually can also be used by the firms as practicing attorneys.

Trial consultants perform a variety of services for lawyers, such as picking jurors (usually relying on in-house or published statistical studies) or performing "mock trials" with focus groups. Trial consultants work on all stages of a case from helping to organize testimony, preparing witnesses to testify, [[scientific jury selection|picking juries]], and even arranging "shadow jurors" to watch the trial unfold and provide input on the trial. There is some debate on whether the work of a trial consultant is protected under attorney-client privilege, especially when the consultant is hired by a party in the case and not by an attorney.

The '''Malmquist bias''' is an effect in [[observational astronomy]] which leads to the preferential detection of intrinsically bright objects.  It was first described in 1922 by Swedish astronomer [[Gunnar Malmquist]] (1893–1982), who then greatly elaborated upon this work in 1925.&lt;ref name="Malm_1"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Malmquist| first=Gunnar |year=1922 |title=On some relations in stellar statistics |journal=[[Arkiv för Matematik, Astronomi och Fysik]] |volume=16 |issue=23 |pages=1–52 |bibcode=1922MeLuF.100....1M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Malm_2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Malmquist|first=Gunnar|title=A Contribution to the Problem of Determining the Distribution in Space of the Stars|journal=[[Arkiv för Matematik, Astronomi och Fysik]] |volume=19A |issue=6 |pages=1–12 |date=1925 |bibcode=1925MeLuF.106....1M}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In statistics, this bias is referred to as a [[selection bias]] and affects the survey results in a [[brightness]] limited [[Astronomical survey|survey]], where stars below a certain apparent brightness are not included.  Since observed [[stars]] and [[galaxies]] appear dimmer when farther away, the brightness that is measured will fall off with distance until their brightness falls below the observational threshold.  Objects which are more [[Luminosity|luminous]], or intrinsically brighter, can be observed at a greater distance, creating a false trend of increasing intrinsic brightness, and other related quantities, with distance.  This effect has led to many spurious claims in the field of astronomy.  Properly correcting for these effects has become an area of great focus.

==Understanding the bias==
[[File:inverse square law.svg|thumb|right|middle|300px| As light rays leave the star homogeneously in every direction, they fill a sphere whose radius grows with time. As the sphere grows, the surface area increases, however the number of light rays stays the same. Following a patch on the surface of the sphere with area A, fewer light rays pass through that patch as the light travels further from the star.]]

===Magnitudes and brightness===

In everyday life it is easy to see that light dims as it gets farther away. This can be seen with car headlights, candles, flashlights, and many other lit objects. This dimming follows the [[inverse square law]], which states that the brightness of an object decreases as 1/''d''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''d'' is the distance between the observer and the object.

Starlight also follows the inverse square law. Light rays leave the [[star]] in equal amounts in all directions. The light rays create a sphere of light surrounding the star. As time progresses, the sphere grows as the light rays travel through space away from the star. While the sphere of light grows, the number of light rays stays the same. So, the amount of light per unit of surface area of the sphere (called [[flux]] in astronomy) decreases with distance and therefore time. When observing a star, only the light rays that are in the given area being viewed can be detected. This is why a star appears dimmer the farther away it is.

If there are two stars with the same intrinsic brightness (called [[luminosity]] in astronomy), each at a different distance, the closer star will appear brighter while the further will appear dimmer. In astronomy, the apparent brightness of a star, or any other luminous object, is called the [[apparent magnitude]]. The apparent magnitude depends on the intrinsic brightness (also called [[absolute magnitude]]) of the object and its distance.

If all stars had the same luminosity, the distance from Earth to a particular star could be easily determined. However, stars have a wide range in luminosities. Therefore, it can be difficult to distinguish a very luminous star that is very far away from a less luminous star that is closer. This is why it is so hard to calculate the distance to astronomical objects.

===Source of the Malmquist bias===

[[File:bias2.png|right|thumb|middle|300px|In a volume of space filled with stars, the stars have a range of luminosities and have some average luminosity shown by the dashed blue line. However, the more distant, less luminous stars will not be seen. This lowest luminosity that can be seen at a given distance is depicted by the red curve. Any star below that curve will not be seen. The average luminosity of only the stars that will be seen will be higher, as shown by the dashed red line.]]

Typically, when looking at an area of sky filled with stars, only stars that are brighter than a limiting [[apparent magnitude]] can be seen. As discussed above, the very luminous stars that are farther away will be seen, as well as luminous and faint stars that are closer. There will appear to be more luminous objects within a certain distance from Earth than faint objects. However, there are many more faint stars,&lt;ref name="imf"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Salpeter|first=Edwin|title=The luminosity function and stellar evolution|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=1955|volume=121|pages=161|doi=10.1086/145971 |bibcode = 1955ApJ...121..161S }}&lt;/ref&gt; they simply cannot be seen because they are so dim. The bias towards luminous stars when observing a patch of sky affects calculations of the average [[absolute magnitude]] and average distance to a group of stars. Because of the luminous stars that are at a further distance, it will appear as if our sample of stars is farther away than it actually is, and that each star is intrinsically brighter than it actually is. This effect is known as the Malmquist bias.&lt;ref name=Malm_1 /&gt;

When studying a sample of luminous objects, whether they be stars or [[galaxies]], it is important to correct for the bias towards the more luminous objects. There are many different methods that can be used to correct for the Malmquist bias as discussed below.

The Malmquist bias is not limited to luminosities. It affects any observational quantity whose detectability diminishes with distance.&lt;ref name=W&amp;J&gt;{{cite book

==Correction methods==
The ideal situation is to avoid this [[Bias (statistics)|bias]] from entering a data [[Astronomical survey|survey]].  However, [[Limiting magnitude|magnitude limited]] [[Astronomical survey|surveys]] are the simplest to perform, and other methods are difficult to put together, with their own uncertainties involved, and may be impossible for first observations of objects.  As such, many different methods exist to attempt to correct the data, removing the [[Bias (statistics)|bias]] and allowing the [[Astronomical survey|survey]] to be usable.  The methods are presented in order of increasing difficulty, but also increasing accuracy and effectiveness.

===Limiting the sample===
The simplest method of correction is to only use the non-biased portions of the data set, if any, and throw away the rest of the data.&lt;ref name="Sandage2000"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Sandage|first=Allan |editor-last=Murdin|editor-first=P. |title=Malmquist Bias and Completeness Limits |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Astronomy and Astrophysics |at=Article 1940 |date=November 2000 |location=Bristol |publisher=[[Institute of Physics Publishing]] |doi=10.1888/0333750888/1940  |bibcode=2000eaa..bookE1940S |isbn=0-333-75088-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Depending on the [[limiting magnitude]] selected, there may be a range of distances in the data set over which all objects of any possible [[absolute magnitude]] could be seen. As such, this small subset of data should be free of the Malmquist bias. This is easily accomplished by cutting off the data at the edge of where the lowest [[absolute magnitude]] objects would be hitting the [[limiting magnitude]]. Unfortunately, this method would waste a great deal of good data, and would limit the analysis to nearby objects only, making it less than desirable. (Looking at the figure to the right, only the first fifth of the data in distance could be kept before a data point is lost to the bias.) Of course, this method assumes that distances are known with relatively good accuracy, which as mentioned before, is a difficult process in astronomy.

===Traditional correction===
The first solution, proposed by Malmquist in his 1922 work, was to correct the calculated average [[absolute magnitude]] (&lt;math&gt;\overline{M}&lt;/math&gt;) of the sample back to the true average [[absolute magnitude]] (''M''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name=Malm_1 /&gt; The correction would be

: &lt;math&gt;\overline{\Delta M} = \overline{M}- M_0 &lt;/math&gt;

To calculate the [[Bias (statistics)|bias]] correction, Malmquist and others following this method follow six main assumptions:&lt;ref name="Butkevich2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Butkevich|first=A. G. |last2=Berdyugin|first2=A. V. |last3=Terrikorpi|first3=P. |title=Statistical biases in stellar astronomy: the Malmquist bias revisited|journal=MNRAS|date=Sep 2005|volume=362|issue=1|pages=321–330|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2005.09306.x |bibcode = 2005MNRAS.362..321B }}&lt;/ref&gt;
#There exists no [[Interstellar medium|interstellar absorption]], or that the stuff in space between stars (like gas and dust) is not affecting the light and absorbing parts of it. This assumes that the [[brightness]] is simply following the [[inverse square law]], mentioned above.
#The [[Luminosity function (astronomy)|luminosity function]] (Φ) is independent of the distance (''r''). This basically just means that the universe is the same everywhere, and that stars will be similarly distributed somewhere else as they are here.
#For a given area on the sky, or more specifically the [[celestial sphere]], the spatial density of stars (''ρ'') depends only on distance. This assumes that there are the same number of stars in each direction, on average.
#There is completeness, meaning the sample is complete and nothing is missed, to an [[Limiting magnitude|apparent magnitude limit]] (''m''&lt;sub&gt;lim&lt;/sub&gt;).
#The [[luminosity function]] can be approximated as a [[Gaussian function]], centered on an intrinsic mean [[absolute magnitude]] ''M''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.
#Stars are of the same [[spectral type]], with intrinsic mean [[absolute magnitude]] ''M''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and dispersion&amp;nbsp;''σ''.

Obviously, this is a very ideal situation, with the final assumption being particularly troubling, but allows for an approximate correction of simple form. By integrating the [[luminosity function]] over all distances and all magnitudes brighter than ''m''&lt;sub&gt;lim&lt;/sub&gt;,

: &lt;math&gt;\overline{\Delta M} = - \sigma^2 \frac{\operatorname{d} \ln A(m_\lim)}{\operatorname{d} m_\lim}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=Malm_1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Butkevich2005 /&gt;

where A(m&lt;sub&gt;lim&lt;/sub&gt;) is the total number of stars brighter than m&lt;sub&gt;lim&lt;/sub&gt;.  If the spatial distribution of stars can be assumed to be homogeneous, this relation is simplified even further, to the generally accepted form of
: &lt;math&gt; \overline{\Delta M} = - 1.382\sigma^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=Malm_1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Butkevich2005 /&gt;

====Multiple-band observation corrections====
The traditional method assumes that the measurements of [[apparent magnitude]] and the measurements from which distance is determined are from the same band, or predefined range, of wavelengths (e.g. the [[H band (infrared)|H band]], a range of [[Infrared astronomy|infrared]] wavelengths from roughly about 1300–2000 [[nanometers]]), and this leads to the correction form of ''cσ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''c'' is some constant.  Unfortunately, this is rarely the case, as many samples of objects are selected from one wavelength band  but the distance is calculated from another.  For example, astronomers frequently select [[galaxies]] from B-band catalogs, which are the most complete, and use these B band magnitudes, but the distances for the galaxies are calculated using the [[Tully–Fisher relation]] and the H band.  When this happens, the square of the variance is replaced by the [[covariance]] between the scatter in the distance measurements and in the galaxy selection property (e.g. magnitude).&lt;ref name="Gould1993"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gould|first=Andrew|title=Selection, Covariance, and Malmquist Bias|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=Aug 1993|volume=412|pages=55–58|doi=10.1086/186939 |bibcode = 1993ApJ...412L..55G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Volume weighting===
Another fairly straightforward correction method is to use a [[weighted mean]] to properly account for the relative contributions at each magnitude.  Since the objects at different [[absolute magnitude]]s can be seen out to different distances, each point's contribution to the average [[absolute magnitude]] or to the [[luminosity function]] can be weighted by 1/V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;, where V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; is the maximum volume over which the objects could have been seen.  Brighter objects (that is, objects with smaller [[absolute magnitude]]s) will have a larger volume over which they could have been detected, before falling under the threshold, and thus will be given less weight through this method since these bright objects will be more fully sampled.&lt;ref name="Blanton2005a"&gt;{{cite journal |display-authors=8|author=Blanton, Michael|author2=Schlegel, D.J.|author3=Strauss, M.A.|author4=Brinkmann, J.|author5=Finkbeiner, D.|author6=Fukugita, M.|author7=Gunn, J.E.|author8=Hogg, D.W.|author9=Ivezic, Z.|author10=Knapp, G.R.|author11=Lupton, R.H.|author12=Munn, J.A.|author13=Schneider, D.P.|author14=Tegmark, M.|author15=Zehavi, I. |title=New York University Value-Added Galaxy Catalog: A Galaxy Catalog Based on New Public Surveys|journal=The Astronomical Journal|date=June 2005|volume=129|issue=6|pages=2562–2578|doi=10.1086/429803 |arxiv = astro-ph/0410166 |bibcode = 2005AJ....129.2562B }}&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum volume can be approximated as a sphere with radius found from the [[distance modulus]], using the object’s [[absolute magnitude]] and the [[Limiting magnitude|limiting apparent magnitude]].

However, there are two major complications to calculating V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;.  First is the completeness of the area covered in the sky, which is the percentage of the sky that the objects were taken from.&lt;ref name=Blanton2005a /&gt; A full sky [[Astronomical survey|survey]] would collect objects from the entire sphere, 4π [[steradians]], of sky but this is usually impractical, both from time constraints and geographical limitations (ground-based telescopes can only see a limited amount of sky due to the Earth being in the way).  Instead, astronomers will generally look at a small patch or area of sky and then infer universal distributions by assuming that space is either [[Isotropy|isotropic]], that it is generally the same in every direction, or is following a known distribution, such as that one will see more stars by looking toward the center of a galaxy than by  looking directly away. Generally, the volume can be simply scaled down by the percentage actually viewed, giving the correct number of objects to volume relation. This effect could potentially be ignored in a single sample, all from the same [[Astronomical survey|survey]], as the objects will basically all be altered by the same numerical factor, but it is incredibly important to account for in order to be able to compare between different surveys with different sky coverage.

The second complication is [[Cosmology|cosmological]] concerns of [[Cosmological redshift|redshift]] and the [[expanding universe]], which must be considered when looking at distant objects. In these cases, the quantity of interest is the [[comoving distance]], which is a constant distance between two objects assuming that they are moving away from each other solely with the expansion of the universe, known as the [[Hubble flow]]. In effect, this [[comoving distance]] is the object's separation if the universe's expansion were neglected, and it can be easily related to the actual distance by accounting for how it would have expanded. The [[comoving distance]] can be used to calculate the respective comoving volume as usual, or a relation between the actual and comoving volumes can also be easily established. If z is the object's [[Cosmological redshift|redshift]], relating to how far emitted light is shifted toward longer wavelengths as a result of the object moving away from us with the universal expansion, D&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; are the actual distance and volume (or what would be measured today) and D&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; are the [[comoving distance]] and volumes of interest, then

: &lt;math&gt; D_C = D_A (1 + z)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; V_C = V_A (1 + z)^3 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Hogg2000"&gt;{{cite arXiv|last=Hogg|first=David W.|title=Distance measures in cosmology |date=Dec 2000|arxiv=astro-ph/9905116 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large downside of the volume weighting method is its sensitivity to [[Observable universe|large-scale structures]], or parts of the universe with more or less objects than average, such as a [[star cluster]] or a [[Void (astronomy)|void]].&lt;ref name="Blanton2005b"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blanton|first=Michael R.|author2=Lupton, R.H. |author3=Schlegel, D.J. |author4=Strauss, M.A. |author5=Brinkmann, J. |author6=Fukugita, M. |author7=Loveday, J. |title=The Properties and Luminosity Function of Extremely Low Luminosity Galaxies|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=Sep 2005|volume=631|issue=1|pages=208–230|doi=10.1086/431416 |arxiv = astro-ph/0410164 |bibcode = 2005ApJ...631..208B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Having very overdense or underdense regions of objects will cause an inferred change in our average [[absolute magnitude]] and [[luminosity function]], according with the structure.  This is a particular issue with the faint objects in calculating a luminosity function, as their smaller maximum volume means that a large-scale structure therein will have a large impact. Brighter objects with large maximum volumes will tend to average out and approach the correct value in spite of some large-scale structures.

===Advanced methods===
Many more methods exist which become increasingly complicated and powerful in application. A few of the most common are summarized here, with more specific information found in the references.

====Stepwise maximum likelihood method====
This method is based on the [[Distribution function (physics)|distribution function]]s of objects (such as stars or galaxies), which is a relation of how many objects are expected with certain intrinsic [[brightness]]es, distances, or other fundamental values. Each of these values have their own [[Distribution function (physics)|distribution function]] which can be combined with a random number generator to create a theoretical sample of stars.  This method takes the [[Distribution function (physics)|distribution function]] of distances as a known, definite quantity, and then allows the [[Distribution function (physics)|distribution function]] of [[absolute magnitude]]s to change. In this way, it can check different [[Distribution function (physics)|distribution function]]s of the [[absolute magnitude]]s against the actual distribution of detected objects, and find the relation that provides the maximum probability of recreating the same set of objects. By starting with the detected, biased distribution of objects and the appropriate limits to detection, this method recreates the true [[Distribution function (physics)|distribution function]].  However, this method requires heavy calculations and generally relies on computer programs.&lt;ref name=Blanton2005b /&gt;&lt;ref name="Efstathiou1988"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Efstathiou|first=George|author2=Frenk, C.S. |author3=White, S.D.M. |author4=Davis, M. |title=Gravitational clustering from scale-free initial conditions|journal=MNRAS|date=Dec 1988|volume=235|pages=715–748 |bibcode = 1988MNRAS.235..715E |doi = 10.1093/mnras/235.3.715 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Schechter estimators====
[[Paul L. Schechter|Paul Schechter]] found a very interesting relation between the logarithm of a [[spectral line|spectral line's]] [[spectral line width|line width]] and its [[apparent magnitude]], when working with [[galaxies]].&lt;ref name=Schecther1980 /&gt; In a perfect, stationary case, [[spectral lines]] should be incredibly narrow bumps, looking like lines, but motions of the object such as rotation or motion in our line of sight will cause shifts and broadening of these lines. The relation is found by starting with the [[Tully–Fisher relation]], wherein the distance to a [[galaxy]] is related to its [[apparent magnitude]] and its velocity width, or the 'maximum' speed of its [[Galaxy rotation curve|rotation curve]].  From macroscopic [[Doppler broadening]], the logarithm of the [[Spectral line width|line width]] of an observed spectral line can be related to the width of the velocity distribution.  If the distances are assumed to be known very well, then the [[absolute magnitude]] and the [[Spectral line width|line width]] are closely related.&lt;ref name="Schecther1980"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schechter|first=P.L.|title=Mass-to-light ratios for elliptical galaxies|journal=Astronomical Journal|date=July 1980|volume=85|pages=801–811|doi=10.1086/112742 |bibcode = 1980AJ.....85..801S }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, working with the commonly used [[Hydrogen line|21cm line]], an important line relating to neutral hydrogen, the relation is generally calibrated with a [[linear regression]] and given the form

: &lt;math&gt; \overline{M} = \alpha P + \beta&lt;/math&gt;

where P is log(line width) and α and β are constants.

The reason that this estimator is useful is that the inverse regression line is actually unaffected by the Malmquist bias, so long as the selection effects are only based on magnitude. As such, the expected value of P given M will be unbiased and will give an unbiased log distance estimator. This estimator has many properties and ramifications which can make it a very useful tool.&lt;ref name="Hendry1993"&gt;{{cite arXiv|last=Hendry|first=M.A.|author2=Simmons, J.F.L. |author3=Newsam, A.M. |title=What Do We Mean by 'Malmquist Bias'? |date=Oct 1993|arxiv=astro-ph/9310028 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Complex mathematical relations====
Advanced versions of the traditional correction mentioned above can be found in the literature, limiting or changing the initial assumptions to suit the appropriate author's needs. Often, these other methods will provide very complicated mathematical expressions with very powerful but specific applications. For example, work by Luri et al. found a relation for the bias for [[stars]] in a [[galaxy]] which relates the correction to the variance of the sample and the [[apparent magnitude]], [[absolute magnitude]], and the height above the [[Disc (galaxy)|galactic disk]].  This gave a much more exact and accurate result, but also required an assumption about the spatial distribution of [[stars]] in the desired [[galaxy]].&lt;ref name="Luri1993"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Luri|first=X.|author2=Mennessier, M.O. |author3=Torra, J. |author4=Figueras, F. |title=A new approach to the Malmquist bias|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|date=Jan 1993|volume=267|pages=305–307 |bibcode = 1993A&amp;A...267..305L }}&lt;/ref&gt; While useful individually, and there are many examples published, these have very limited scope and are not generally as broadly applicable as the other methods mentioned above.

==Applications==

[[File:lumfunc.png|thumb|right|middle|300px|The dashed red line is an example luminosity function when the Malmquist bias is not corrected for. The more numerous low luminosity objects are underrepresented because of the apparent magnitude limit of the survey. The solid blue line is the properly corrected luminosity function using the volume-weighted correction method.]]

Anytime a magnitude-limited sample is used, one of the methods described above should be used to correct for the Malmquist bias. For instance, when trying to obtain a [[luminosity function]], calibrate the [[Tully–Fisher relation]], or obtain the value of the [[Hubble constant]], the Malmquist bias can strongly change the results.

The luminosity function gives the number of stars or galaxies per luminosity or absolute magnitude bin.  When using a magnitude-limited sample, the number of faint objects is underrepresented as discussed above. This shifts the peak of the luminosity function from the faint end to a brighter luminosity and changes the shape of the luminosity function. Typically, the volume weighting method is used to correct the Malmquist bias so that the survey is equivalent to a distance-limited survey rather than a magnitude-limited survey.&lt;ref name="Binney"&gt;{{cite book|last=Binney|first=James|title=Galactic Astronomy|date=1998|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|pages=111–115|author2=Merrifield, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figure to the right shows two luminosity functions for an example population of stars that is magnitude-limited. The dashed luminosity function shows the effect of the Malmquist bias, while the solid line shows the corrected luminosity function. Malmquist bias drastically changes the shape of the luminosity function.

Another application that is affected by the Malmquist bias is the [[Tully–Fisher relation]], which relates the luminosity of spiral galaxies to their respective velocity width. If a nearby cluster of galaxies is used to calibrate the Tully–Fisher relation, and then that relation is applied to a distant cluster, the distance to the farther cluster will be systematically underestimated.&lt;ref name=Hendry1993 /&gt; By underestimating the distance to clusters, anything found using those clusters will be incorrect; for example, when finding the value of the Hubble constant.

These are just a few examples where the Malmquist bias can strongly affect results. As mentioned above, anytime a magnitude-limited sample is used, the Malmquist bias needs to be corrected for. A correction is not limited to just the examples above.

==Alternatives==
Some alternatives do exist to attempt to avoid the Malmquist bias, or to approach it in a different way, with a few of the more common ones summarized below.

===Distance-limited sampling===
One ideal method to avoid the Malmquist bias is to only select objects within a set distance, and have no [[limiting magnitude]] but instead observe all objects within this volume.&lt;ref name=Sandage2000 /&gt; Clearly, in this case, the Malmquist bias is not an issue as the volume will be fully populated and any [[Distribution function (physics)|distribution]] or [[luminosity function]] will be appropriately sampled.  Unfortunately, this method is not always practical.  Finding distances to astronomical objects is very difficult, and even with the aid of objects with easily determined distances, called [[standard candles]], and similar things, there are great uncertainties.  Further, distances are not generally known for objects until after they have already been observed and analyzed, and so a distance limited [[Astronomical survey|survey]] is usually only an option for a second round of observations, and not initially available.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}  Finally, distance limited [[Astronomical surveys|surveys]] are generally only possible over small volumes where the distances are reliably known, and thus it is not practical for large [[Astronomical surveys|surveys]].

===Homogeneous and inhomogeneous Malmquist correction===
This method attempts to correct the [[Bias (statistics)|bias]] again, but through very different means. Rather than trying to fix the [[absolute magnitude]]s, this method takes the distances to the objects as being the random variables and attempts to rescale those.&lt;ref name=Hendry1993 /&gt;  In effect, rather than giving the stars in the sample the correct distribution of [[absolute magnitude]]s (and average [[absolute magnitude]]), it attempts to 'move' the stars such that they would have a correct distribution of distances. Ideally, this should have the same end result as the magnitude correction methods and should result in a correctly represented sample. In either the homogeneous or inhomogeneous case, the bias is defined in terms of a prior distribution of distances, the distance estimator, and the [[likelihood function]] of these two being the same distribution.  The homogeneous case is much simpler and rescales the raw distance estimates by a constant factor. Unfortunately, this will be very insensitive to [[Observable universe|large scale structures]] such as clustering as well as observational selection effects, and will not give a very accurate result.  The inhomogeneous case attempts to correct this by creating a more complicated prior distribution of objects by taking into account structures seen in the observed distribution. In both cases though, it is assumed that the [[probability density function]] is Gaussian with constant variance and a mean of the true average log distance, which is far from accurate.  However, this method is debated and may not be accurate in any implementation due to uncertainties in calculating the raw, observed distance estimates causing the assumptions to use this method to be invalid.&lt;ref name=Hendry1993 /&gt;

The term 'Malmquist bias' has not always been definitively used to refer to the bias outlined above. As recently as the year 2000, the Malmquist bias has appeared in the literature clearly referring to different types of bias and statistical effect.&lt;ref name="Murdin2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Murdin|first=Paul|chapter=Malmquist, Gunnar (1893–1982)|title=Encyclopedia of Astronomy and Astrophysics|date=2000|doi=10.1888/0333750888/3837|bibcode=2000eaa..bookE3837. |isbn=0-333-75088-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common of these other uses is to refer to an effect that takes place with a [[Limiting magnitude|magnitude limited]] sample, but in this case the low [[absolute magnitude]] objects are overrepresented.  In a sample with a [[Limiting magnitude|magnitude limit]], there will be a margin of error near that boundary where objects that should be bright enough to make the cut are excluded and objects that are slightly below the limit are instead included. Since low [[absolute magnitude]] objects are more common than brighter ones, and since these dimmer galaxies are more likely to be below the cutoff line and scattered up, while the brighter ones are more likely to be above the line and scattered down, an over-representation of the lower [[luminosity]] objects result. However, in modern-day literature and consensus, the Malmquist bias refers to the effect outlined above.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5370">In [[mathematics education]], '''number sense''' can refer to "an intuitive understanding of numbers, their magnitude, relationships, and how they are affected by operations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learnnc.org/glossary/number+sense|title=number sense}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other definitions of number sense emphasize an ability to work outside of the traditionally taught algorithms, e.g., "a well organised conceptual framework of number information that enables a person to understand numbers and number relationships and to solve mathematical problems that are not bound by traditional algorithms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nrich.maths.org/public/viewer.php?obj_id=2477&amp;part=index|title=What is number sense?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologists believe that the number sense in humans can be differentiated into the [[approximate number system]], a system that supports the estimation of the [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]], and the [[parallel individuation system]], which allows the tracking of individual objects, typically for quantities below 4.&lt;ref name="Piazza"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Piazza|first=M.|title=Neurocognitive start-up tools for symbolic number representations|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|year=2010|volume=14|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2010.09.008|pages=542–551}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also some differences in how number sense is defined in math [[cognition]]. For example, Gersten and Chard say number sense "refers to a child's fluidity and flexibility with numbers, the sense of what numbers mean and an ability to perform mental mathematics and to look at the world and make comparisons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ldonline.org/article/5838|title=Number Sense: Rethinking Arithmetic Instruction for Students with Mathematical Disabilities }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/recordDetail?accno=EJ695626|title=Making Sense of Number Sense: Implications for Children With Mathematical Disabilities}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edletter.org/insights/stages.shtml|title=Stages in Development of Number Sense - Harvard Education Letter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In non-human animals, number sense is not the ability to count, but the ability to perceive changes in the number of things in a collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.twsu.edu/history/topics/num-sys.html#sense|title=Number Systems|website=www.math.twsu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; All mammals, and most birds, will notice if there is a change in the number of their young nearby. Many birds can distinguish two from three.&lt;ref&gt;Dantzig, Tobias. Number: The Language of Science. New York: Macmillan Company, 1930.&lt;/ref&gt;
In humans, small children around fourteen months of age are also able to notice something that is missing from a group that they are familiar with.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

Researchers consider number sense to be of prime importance for children in early [[elementary education]], and the [[National Council of Teachers of Mathematics]] has made number sense a focus area of pre-K through 2nd grade mathematics education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fayar.net/east/teacher.web/math/Illuminations/reflections/prek2/E_NumberSense/index.html|title=Understanding a Child's Development of Number Sense}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An active area of research is to create and test teaching strategies to develop children's number sense. Number sense also refers to the contest hosted by the [[University Interscholastic League]].  This contest is a ten-minute test where contestants solve math problems mentally—no calculators, scratch-work, or mark-outs are allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uiltexas.org/academics/number-sense|title=UIL Number Sense}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concepts involved in number sense==
The term ''"number sense"'' involves several concepts of [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]], [[ranking]], [[Comparison (mathematics)|comparison]], [[measurement]], [[rounding]], [[percent]]s, and [[estimation]], including:&lt;ref name="stpsb"&gt;"Unit 1: Number and Number Sense" (20-day lesson),
  STPSB.org, St. Tammany Parish School Board,
  [[Covington, LA]] (USA), 2009, overview webpage:
  [http://www.stpsb.org/files/MathGrade7Unit1090120034917.htm ST-MathGrade7Unit-topics].
&lt;/ref&gt;
* estimating with large numbers to provide reasonable approximations;
* judging the degree of precision appropriate to a situation;
* rounding (understanding reasons for rounding large numbers and limitations in comparisons);
* choosing measurement units to make sense for a given situation;
* solving real-life problems involving percentages and decimal portions;
* comparing physical measurements within and between the U.S. and [[metric system]]s; and
* comparing degrees [[Fahrenheit]] and [[Celsius]] in real-life situations.&lt;ref name=stpsb/&gt;
Those concepts are taught in elementary-level education.

[[Oriental carpet|Carpets]] of [[Middle-Eastern]] origin, either from [[Turkish carpet|Anatolia]], [[Persian carpet|Persia]], [[Armenian carpet|Armenia]], [[Azerbaijani rug|Azerbaijan]], the [[Levant]], the [[Mamluk]] state of [[Egypt]] or [[Northern Africa]], were used as decorative features in Western European [[paintings]] from the 14th century onwards. More depictions of '''Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting''' survive than actual carpets produced before the 17th century, though the number of these known has increased in recent decades. Therefore, comparative art-historical research has from its onset in the late 19th century relied on carpets represented in datable European paintings.

== Art historical background ==
[[File:Petrus Christus Virgin and Child Detail.jpg|thumb|[[Petrus Christus]], Virgin and Child with Saints Jerome and Francis (detail), 1457, with a [[Realism (arts)|realistic]] depiction of a pile-woven carpet. [[Städel]] Museum, Frankfurt]]
[[File:Jan van Eyck - Lucca Madonna - Google Art Project-x0-y1.jpg|thumb|[[Jan van Eyck]], Lucca Madonna (detail), circa 1430. [[Städel]] Museum, Frankfurt]]

Activities of scientists and collectors beginning in the late 19th century have substantially increased the corpus of surviving Oriental carpets, allowing for more detailed comparison of existing carpets with their painted counterparts. Western comparative research resulted in an ever more detailed cultural history of the Oriental art of carpet weaving. This has in turn renewed and inspired the scientific interest in their countries of origin. Comparative research based on Renaissance paintings and carpets preserved in museums and collections continues to contribute to the expanding body of art historical and cultural knowledge.

The tradition of precise realism among Western painters of the late 15th and 16th century provides pictorial material which is often detailed enough to justify conclusions about even minute details of the painted carpet. The carpets are treated with exceptional care in the rendering of colors, patterns, and details of form and design: The painted texture of a carpet depicted in [[Petrus Christus]]'s "Virgin and Child", the drawing of the individual patterns and motifs, and the way the pile opens where the carpet is folded over the steps, all suggest that the depicted textile is a pile-woven carpet.

Visually, the carpets serve to draw attention either to an important person, or to highlight a location where significant action is going on. In parallel with the development of Renaissance painting, initially mainly Christian saints and religious scenes are set out on the carpets. Later on, the carpets were integrated into secular contexts, but always served to represent the idea of opulence, exoticism, luxury, wealth, or status. First, their use was reserved for the most powerful and most wealthy, for royalty and nobility. Later on, as more people gained sufficient wealth to afford goods of luxury, Oriental carpets appeared on the portraits of merchants and wealthy burghers. During the late 17th and 18th century, the interest in depicting carpets declined. In parallel, the paintings pay less attention to detail.

The richly designed Oriental carpets appealed strongly to Western painters. The rich and various colours may have influenced the great Venetian painters of the [[Quattrocento]].&lt;ref name="Erdmann, Seven Hundred Years of Oriental Carpets, 1970"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Erdmann, Kurt|year=1970|title=Seven Hundred Years of Oriental Carpets|location=Berkeley, California|publisher=University of California Press (translated from the German ''Siebenhundert Jahre Orientteppich'' by May H. Beattie and Hildegard Herzog)|isbn=9780520018167}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that the pictorial representation of carpets is linked to the development of the [[Perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bier|first1=Carol|title=From grid to projected grid: Oriental carpets and the development of linear perspective.|journal=Proceedings of the Textile Society of America - 12th Biennal Symposium|date=2010|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1009&amp;context=tsaconf|accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was first described by [[Leon Battista Alberti]] in 1435.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alberti|first1=Leon Battista|editor1-last=Sinisgalli|editor1-first=Rocco|title=On painting : a new translation and critical edition|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9781107000629|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The depiction of oriental carpets in Renaissance paintings is regarded as an important contribution to a "world history of art", based upon interactions of different cultural traditions.&lt;ref name="Carrier, 2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carrier|first1=David|title=A world art history and its objects|date=2008|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press|location=University Park, Pa.|isbn=978-0271034157}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rugs from the Islamic world arrived in large numbers in Western Europe by the 15th century, which is increasingly recognized as a pivotal temporal nexus in the cultural encounters that contributed to the development of Renaissance ideas, arts, and sciences. Intensified contacts, especially the increasing trade between the Islamic world and Western Europe, have provided material sources and cultural [[Islamic influences on Christian art|influences]] to Western artists during the next centuries to come. In turn, European market demands also affected the carpet production in their countries of origin.&lt;ref name="Erdmann, Seven Hundred Years of Oriental Carpets, 1970"/&gt;

== Origin and limitations of the comparative approach ==

In 1871, [[Julius Lessing]] published his book on oriental carpet design. He was relying more on European paintings than on the examination of actual carpets for lack of material, because ancient oriental carpets were not yet collected at the time when he worked on his book.&lt;ref name="Lessing, Ancient Oriental Carpet Patterns"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lessing|first1=Julius|title=Altorientalische Teppichmuster: Nach Bildern und Originalen des XV. - XVI. Jahrhunderts, translated into English as ''Ancient Oriental Carpet Patterns after Pictures and Originals of the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries''. London: H. Sotheran &amp; Co., 1879|date=1877|location=Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lessing's approach has proven very useful to establish a scientific chronology of Oriental carpet weaving, and was further elaborated and expanded mainly by scholars of the "Berlin school" of History of [[Islamic art]]: [[Wilhelm von Bode]], and his successors [[Friedrich Sarre]], [[Ernst Kühnel]], and [[Kurt Erdmann]] developed the ''"[[Terminus post quem|ante quem]]"'' method for the dating of oriental carpets based on Renaissance paintings.

These art historians were also aware of the fact that their scientific approach was biased: Only carpets produced by manufactories were exported to Western Europe, and consequently were available to the Renaissance artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Erdmann |first1=Kurt |title=Pinner, R.: Editorial to "The history of the early Turkish carpet." by K. Erdmann |date=1977 |publisher=Oguz Pr. |location=London |isbn=9780905820026 |edition=1977 English ed. of the original, 1957 German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Village or nomadic rugs did not reach Europe during the Renaissance, and were not depicted in paintings. Not until the mid twentieth century, when collectors like Joseph V. McMullan or [[James F. Ballard]] recognized the artistic and art historic value of village or nomadic carpets, were they appreciated in the Western World.

Pile carpets with geometric design are known to have been produced from the 13th century among the [[Seljuks of Rum]] in eastern [[Anatolia]], whom [[Venice]] had had commercial relations since 1220.&lt;ref name="Mack, p.74"&gt;Mack, p.74&lt;/ref&gt; The Medieval trader and traveler [[Marco Polo]] himself mentioned that the carpets produced at [[Konya]] were the best in the world:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''...et ibi fiunt soriani et tapeti pulchriores de mundo et pulchrioris coloris.''&lt;br&gt;
"...and here they make the most beautiful silks and carpets in the world, and with the most beautiful colours."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marsden|first1=William|editor1-last=Wright|editor1-first=Thomas|title=Travels of Marco Polo, the Venetian: the translation of Marsden revised.|date=2010|publisher=Bibliobazaar, Llc|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-1142126261|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
Carpets were also produced in [[Al Andaluz|Islamic Spain]], and one is shown in a fresco of the 1340s in the [[Palais des Papes]], [[Avignon]].&lt;ref&gt;King &amp; Sylvester, 10-11&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of carpets in 15th- and 16th-century paintings are either from the [[Ottoman Empire]], or possibly European copies of these types from the [[Balkans]], Spain, or elsewhere.  In fact these were not the finest Islamic carpets of the period, and few of the top-quality Turkish "court" carpets are seen.  Even finer than these, [[Persian carpet]]s do not appear until the end of the 16th century, but become increasingly popular among the very wealthy in the 17th century.  The very refined [[Mamluk]] carpets from [[Egypt]] are occasionally seen, mostly in [[Venice|Venetian]] paintings.&lt;ref&gt;King &amp; Sylvester, 17&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first uses of an oriental carpet in a European painting is [[Simone Martini]]'s ''Saint Louis of Toulouse Crowning Robert of Anjou, King of Naples'', painted in 1316-1319.&lt;ref&gt;Mack, p.74-75. [[:File:1s louis21.jpg|Image]]&lt;/ref&gt; Another Anatolian animal carpet appears in a c. 1340-45 Sienese panel of the Holy Family attributed to Pietro or Ambrogio Lorenzetti (Abegg-Stiftung, Riggisberg) with alternating black and white animals within colorful octagonal medallions.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, S. Maureen, 'Mary with Her Spools of Thread: Domesticating the Sacred Interior in Tuscan Trecento Art,' in John Garton and Diane Wolfthal, eds., ''New Studies on Old Masters: Essays in Renaissance Art in Honour of Colin Eisler'', Toronto: Centre for Reformation and Renaissance Studies, 2011, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; European depictions of Oriental carpets were extremely faithful to the originals, judging by comparison with the few surviving examples of actual rugs of contemporary date.  Their larger scale also allows more detailed and accurate depictions than those shown in miniature paintings from Turkey or Persia.

Most carpets use [[Islamic art|Islamic]] geometric designs, with the earliest ones also using animal patterns such as the originally Chinese-inspired "phoenix-and-dragon", as in [[Domenico di Bartolo]]'s ''[[:File:Domenico di Bartolo The Marriage of the Foundlings 1440.jpg|Marriage of the Foundlings]]'' (1440).  These had been stylised and simplified into near-geometric motifs in their transmission to the Islamic world.&lt;ref&gt;Mack, p.75. King &amp; Sylvester, pp. 13, and 49-50.&lt;/ref&gt; The whole group, referred to in the literature as "[[Early Anatolian Animal carpets|Animal rugs]]" disappeared from paintings by about the end of the 15th century.  Only a handful of original animal-pattern carpets survive, two from European churches, where their rarity presumably preserved them.&lt;ref&gt;King &amp; Sylvester, pp. 49-50.&lt;/ref&gt;  The "Marby Rug", one of the finest examples, was preserved in a church of the [[Sweden|Swedish]] town of Marby, and a bold adaptation of an originally Chinese "dragon and phoenix" motif is in Berlin. Both are rugs, less than 2 metres long, and about 1 metre wide, with two compartments, though the Berlin carpet lacks a border down one long side.&lt;ref&gt;King &amp; Sylvester, 49-50&lt;/ref&gt; The "Dragon and Phoenix" and the "Marby" rugs were the only existing examples of Animal carpets known until 1988. Since then, seven more carpets of this type have been found. They survived in Tibetan monasteries and were removed by monks fleeing to Nepal during the [[Cultural Revolution|Chinese cultural revolution]]. One of these carpets was acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art&lt;ref name="MET animal carpet Acc.Nr. 1990.61"&gt;{{cite web|title=Animal carpet at the Metropolitan Museum of Art|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/453317|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which parallels a painting by the Sienese artist [[Gregorio di Cecco]]: "The Marriage of the Virgin", 1423.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Gallery London|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/probably-by-gregorio-di-cecco-di-luca-the-marriage-of-the-virgin|website=National Gallery London NG 1317|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shows large [[confronted animals]], each with a smaller animal inside.

Although the carpets were displayed on a public floor in a few examples, most carpets on the floor are in an area reserved for the main protagonists, very often on a dais or in front of an altar, or down steps in front of the [[Virgin Mary]] or [[Saints]], or rulers,&lt;ref&gt;Mack, p.76&lt;/ref&gt; in the manner of a modern [[red carpet]].  This presumably reflected the contemporary practice of royalty; in [[Denmark]] the 16th century Persian [[Coronation Carpet]] is used under the throne for coronations to this day.  They are also often hung over [[balustrade]]s or out of windows for festive occasions, such as the processions through Venice shown by [[Vittore Carpaccio]] or [[Gentile Bellini]] (see gallery);&lt;ref&gt;King &amp; Sylvester, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; when Carpaccio's [[St Ursula]] embarks they are hung over the sides of boats and footbridges.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Vittore Carpaccio 045.jpg|Carpaccio image]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Oriental carpets were often depicted as a decorative element in religious scenes, and were a symbol of luxury, status and taste,&lt;ref&gt;Mack, p.73-93&lt;/ref&gt; although they were becoming more widely available throughout the period, which is reflected in the paintings. In some cases, such as paintings by Gentile Bellini, the carpets reflect an early [[orientalism|Orientalist]] interest, but for most painters they merely reflect the prestige of the carpets in Europe.  A typical example is the Turkish carpet at the feet of the Virgin Mary in the 1456-1459 [[San Zeno Altarpiece (Mantegna)|San Zeno Altarpiece]] by [[Andrea Mantegna]] ([[:File:Andrea Mantegna 028.jpg|see detail]]).&lt;ref&gt;Mack, p.67&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-royal portrait sitters were more likely to place their carpet on a table or other piece of furniture, especially in Northern Europe, though small rugs beside a bed are not uncommon, as in the ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'' of 1434.&lt;ref&gt;King &amp; Sylvester, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;  Carpets are seen on tables in particular in Italian scenes showing the ''Calling of [[Matthew the Evangelist|Matthew]]'', when he was engaged in his work as a tax-collector,&lt;ref&gt;King &amp; Sylvester, 14&lt;/ref&gt; and the life of [[Saint Eligius]], who was a [[goldsmith]].  Both are shown sitting doing business at a carpet-covered table or shop counter.
 
The Oriental carpets used in Renaissance painting had various geographical origins, designated in contemporary Italy by different names: the ''cagiarini'' (Mamluk design from Egypt), the ''damaschini'' ([[Damascus]] region), the ''barbareschi'' (North Africa), the ''rhodioti'' (probably imported through Rome), the ''turcheschi'' ([[Ottoman Empire]]) and the ''simiscasa'' ([[Circassians|Circassian]] or [[Caucasus|Caucasian]]).&lt;ref&gt;Mack, p.77&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the prayer carpets represented in Christian religious paintings are also Islamic [[prayer mats]], with such motifs as the [[mihrab]] or the [[Kaaba]] (the so-called re-entrant carpets, later called the "Bellini" type).&lt;ref&gt;Mack, p.84. King &amp; Sylvester, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; The representation of such prayer rugs disappeared after 1555, probably as a consequence of the realization of their religious meaning and connection to [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;Mack, p.85.&lt;/ref&gt;

The depiction of Oriental carpets in paintings other than portraits generally declined after the 1540s, corresponding to a decline in the taste for highly detailed representation of objects (Detailism) among painters,&lt;ref&gt;Mack, p.90&lt;/ref&gt; and grander classicising surrounds for hieratic religious images.

When Western scholars explored the history of Islamic carpetmaking, several types of carpet pattern became conventionally called after the names of European painters who had used them, and these terms remain in use.  The classification is mostly that of [[Kurt Erdmann]], once Director of the [[Museum für Islamische Kunst (Berlin)]], and the leading carpet scholar of his day.  Some of these types ceased to be produced several centuries ago, and the location of their production remains uncertain, so obvious alternative terms were not available.  The classification ignores the border patterns, and distinguishes between the type, size and arrangement of [[gul (design)|gul]], or larger motifs in the central field of the carpet.  In addition to four types of Holbein carpets,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldturkishcarpets.com/carpets-ottoman-period3.html Old Turkish carpets] website&lt;/ref&gt; there are Bellini carpets, Crivellis, Memlings, and [[Lotto carpet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;King &amp; Sylvester&lt;/ref&gt;  These names are somewhat random: many artists painted these types, and single artists often painted many types of carpets.

===Bellini carpets===
Both [[Giovanni Bellini]] and his brother [[Gentile Bellini|Gentile]] (who visited [[Istanbul]] in 1479) painted examples of these prayer-rugs with a single "re-entrant" or keyhole motif at the bottom of a larger figure traced in a thin border.  At the top end the borders close diagonally to a point, from which hangs down a "lamp".  The design had Islamic significance, and its function seems to have been recognised in Europe, as they were known in English as "musket" carpets, a corruption of "mosque".&lt;ref&gt;King and Sylvester, pp. 14-16, 56, 58.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the Gentile Bellini seen at top the rug is the "right" way round; often this is not the case.  Later Ushak prayer-rugs where both ends have the diagonal pointed inner border, as at the top only of Bellini rugs, are sometimes known as [[Tintoretto]] rugs, though this term is not as commonly used as the others mentioned here.&lt;ref&gt;King &amp; Sylvester, 78&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crivelli carpets===
[[Carlo Crivelli]] twice painted what seems to be the same small rug, with the centre taken up with a complex sixteen-pointed star motif made up of several compartments in different colours, some containing highly stylised animal motifs. Comparable actual carpets are extremely rare, but there are two in [[Budapest]].&lt;ref&gt;One shown [http://www.turkotek.com/misc_00021/hash_gul.htm here], about a third of the way down the page.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Annunciation'' of 1482 in the [[Städel]] museum in Frankfurt shows it at the top, and the same carpet seems to be used in the ''Annunciation, with Saint Emidius'' in the [[National Gallery, London]] (1486), which shows the type hung over a balcony to the top left, and a different type of carpet over another balcony in the right foreground.  These seem to be a transitional type between the early animal-pattern carpets and later purely geometrical designs, such as the Holbein types, perhaps reflecting increased [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] enforcement of Islamic [[aniconism]].&lt;ref&gt;King &amp; Sylvester, pp. 14, 26, 57-58. Campbell, p. 189.[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/zoomImage?workNumber=NG739&amp;collectionPublisherSection=work National Gallery zoomable image] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507124425/http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/zoomImage?workNumber=NG739&amp;collectionPublisherSection=work |date=2009-05-07 }}. There is a different type of carpet hung from the Virgin's house, at top center-right.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memling carpets===
{{multiple image| align = right | direction = horizontal | header = | header_align = left/right/center | footer = Left image: yellow Oriental carpet in [[Hans Memling]] altarpiece of 1488-1490. The "hooked" motif defines a "Memling carpet".&lt;ref&gt;King and Sylvester, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louvre Museum]].&lt;br&gt; Right image: [[Konya]] 18th century carpet with Memling gul design.| footer_align = left | image1 =Hans Memling La Vierge et l Enfant entre Saint Jacques et Saint Dominique 1488 1490.jpg| width1 = 265 | caption1  = | image2 =Konya 18th carpet with Memling gul design.jpg| width2 = 112 | caption2 = }} 
These are named after [[Hans Memling]], who painted several examples of what may have been [[Armenian carpet]]s in the last quarter of the fifteenth century, and are characterised by several lines coming off the motifs that end in "hooks", by coiling in on themselves through two or three 90° turns.  Another example appears in a miniature painted for [[René of Anjou]] about 1460.&lt;ref&gt;Todd Richardson, ''Plague, Weather, and Wool'', AuthorHouse, 2009, p.182(344), {{ISBN|1-4389-5187-6}}, {{ISBN|978-1-4389-5187-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;King and Sylvester, pp. 56-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Holbein carpets===

{{main|Holbein carpet}}
These in fact are seen in paintings from many decades earlier than [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Holbein]], and are sub-divided into four types (of which Holbein actually only painted two); they are the commonest designs of [[Anatolia]]n carpet seen in Western Renaissance paintings, and continued to be produced for a long period.  All are purely geometric and use a variety of arrangements of [[lozenge]]s, crosses and octagonal motifs within the main field. The sub-divisions are between:&lt;ref&gt;King &amp; Sylvester, pp. 26-27, 52-57. Campbell, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Type I: Small-pattern Holbein. This type is defined by an infinite repeat of small patterns, with alternating rows of octagons and staggered rows of diamonds, as seen in Holbein the Younger's ''Portrait of [[Georg Giese|Georg Gisze]]'' (1532), or the [[Somerset House Conference (painting)|Somerset House Conference]] (1608).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldturkishcarpets.com/carpets-ottoman-period.html Old Ottoman carpets], see also last note.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1=Erdmann| first1=Kurt| title=Der Orientalische Knüpfteppich. = Oriental Carpets: An Essay on their History. tr. C. G. Ellis, New York, 1960.| date=1965| publisher=Verlag Ernst Wasmuth| location=Tübingen| page=23| edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Type II: now more often called [[Lotto carpet]]s - see below.
*Type III: Large-pattern Holbein. The motifs in the field inside the border consist of one or two large squares filled with octagons, placed regularly, and separated from each other and from the borders by narrow stripes. There are no secondary "[[Gul (design)|gul]]" motifs. The carpet in Holbein's ''[[The Ambassadors (Holbein)|The Ambassadors]]'' is of this type.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldturkishcarpets.com/carpets-ottoman-period2.html Old Ottoman carpets], Large-pattern Type III Holbein Carpets. See also note to the last paragraph.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1=Erdmann| first1=Kurt| title=Der Orientalische Knüpfteppich. = Oriental Carpets: An Essay on their History. tr. C. G. Ellis, New York, 1960.| date=1965| publisher=Verlag Ernst Wasmuth| location=Tübingen| page=25| edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Type IV: Large-pattern Holbein. Large, square, star-filled compartments are combined with secondary, smaller squares containing octagons or other "[[Gul (design)|gul]]" motifs. In contrast to the other types, which only contain patterns of equal scale, the type IV Holbein shows subordinate ornaments of unequal scale.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldturkishcarpets.com/carpets-ottoman-period3.html Old Ottoman carpets], Large-pattern Type IV Holbein Carpets. See also note to the last paragraph.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1=Erdmann| first1=Kurt| title=Der Orientalische Knüpfteppich. = Oriental Carpets: An Essay on their History. tr. C. G.

===Lotto carpets===

{{Main|Lotto carpet}}
These were previously known as "small-pattern Holbein Type II", but he never painted one, unlike [[Lorenzo Lotto]], who did so several times, though he was not the first artist to show them.  Lotto is also documented as owning a large carpet, though its pattern is unknown.  They were primarily produced during the 16th and 17th centuries along the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean coast]] of [[Anatolia|Anatolia, Turkey]], but also copied in various parts of Europe, including Spain, England and Italy.  They are characterized by a lacy [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]], usually in yellow on a red ground, often with blue details.&lt;ref name="King and Sylvester, p. 67"&gt;King and Sylvester, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

Though they look very different from Holbein Type I carpets, they are a development of the type, where the edges of the motifs, nearly always in yellow on a red ground, take off in rigid [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]]s somewhat suggesting foliage, and terminating in branched [[palmette]]s.  The type was common and long-lasting, and is also known as "Arabesque [[Ushak]]".&lt;ref&gt;Cambell, p. 189. [http://www.oldturkishcarpets.com/carpets-ottoman-period.html Old Ottoman carpets. Type II Holbein or "Lotto" Carpets].  King and Sylvester, pp. 16, 67-70.&lt;/ref&gt;

To judge from paintings, they reached Italy by 1516, Portugal about a decade later, and reached northern Europe, including England, by the 1560s. They continue to appear in paintings until about the 1660s, especially in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="King and Sylvester, p. 67"/&gt;

=== Ghirlandaio carpets ===
{{multiple image| align = right | direction = horizontal | header= | header_align = left | footer =| footer_align = left | image1 =Domenico Ghirlandaio Madonna and Child enthroned with Saint c 1483.jpg| width1 = 235 | caption1=Domenico Ghirlandaio: Madonna and Child enthroned with Saint, circa 1483 | image2=West Anatolian ‘Ghirlandaio’ Rug.jpg| width2 = 154 | caption2=West Anatolian ‘Ghirlandaio’ rug, late 17th century}}

A carpet closely related to the 1483 painting by [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] was found by A. Boralevi in the Evangelical church, Hâlchiu (Heldsdorf) in [[Transylvania]], attributed to Western Anatolia, and dated to the late 15th century.&lt;ref name="15th century Ghirlandaio Rug"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ionescu|first1=Stefano|title=Transsylvanian Tale|url=http://www.transylvanianrugs.com/pdf/HALI137.pdf|website=www.transsylvanian rug|publisher=HALI 137, 53|accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The general design of the Ghirlandaio type, as in the 1486 painting, is related to Holbein Type 1. It is defined by one or two central medallions of diamond shape, consisting of an octagon within a square, from whose sides triangular, curvilinear patterns arise. Carpets with this medallion have been woven in the Western [[Anatolia]]n region of [[Çanakkale]] since the 16th century.&lt;ref name="Yetkin, 1981"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yetkin|first1=Serare|title=Historical Turkish Carpets|date=1981|publisher=Turkiye is Bankasi Cultural Publications|location=Istanbul|pages=59–65|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; A carpet fragment with a Ghirlandaio medallion was found in the [[Divriği Great Mosque and Hospital|Divriği Great Mosque]], and dated to the 16th century.

In his essay on "Centralized Designs", Thompson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Herrmann|first1=Eberhart|title=From Konya to Kokand - Rare Oriental Carpets III|date=1982|publisher=Eberhart Herrmann|location=Munich}}&lt;/ref&gt; relates the central medallion pattern of oriental carpets to the "lotus pedestal" and "cloud collar (yun chien)" motifs, used in [[Buddhist art|the art of Buddhist Asia]]. The origin of the design thus dates back to pre-Islamic times, probably [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan time]] China. Brüggemann and Boehmer further elaborate that it might have been introduced to Western Anatolia by the Seljuk, or Mongol invaders in the 11th or 13th century.&lt;ref name="Brüggemann/Boehmer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brüggemann,|first1=Werner|last2=Boehmer|first2=Harald|title=Teppiche der Bauern und Nomaden in Anatolien|date=1982|publisher=Verlag Kunst und Antiquitäten|location=Munich|isbn=3-921811-20-1|pages=60–78|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast to the manifold variation of patterns seen in other carpet types, the Ghirlandaio medallion design has remained largely unaltered from the 15th to the 21st century, and thus exemplifies an unusual continuity of a woven carpet design within a specific region.

=== Van Eyck and Petrus Christus: Painted carpets without surviving counterparts ===

The Netherlandish painters [[Jan van Eyck]], in his [[Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele|"Paele Madonna"]], 'Lucca Madonna", and the [[Dresden Triptych]], and [[Petrus Christus]] in his "Virgin and Child with Saints Jerome and Francis" have painted four different carpets, three of them of a similar design. By the [[Realism (art)|realism]] of the depictions, these are pile-woven carpets. No directly comparable carpets have survived.&lt;ref&gt;King and Sylvester, 20&lt;/ref&gt;

The carpet pattern depicted on [[Jan van Eyck]]'s [[Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele|"Paele Madonna"]] could be traced back to late Roman origins and related to early Islamic floor mosaics found in the Umayyad palace of [[Hisham's Palace|Khirbat al-Mafjar]].&lt;ref name="Brüggemann, Orientteppich 2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brüggemann|first1=Werner|title=Der Orientteppich/The Oriental Carpet|date=2007|publisher=Dr Ludwig Reichert Verlag|location=Wiesbaden, Germany|isbn=978-3-89500-563-3|pages=87–176|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar, but not identical carpets appear in the "Lucca Madonna", Dresden triptych, and "Virgin with Child and Saints" paintings which show a predominantly geometric design with a lozenge composition in infinite repeat, built up from fine bands which connect eight-pointed stars. Yetkin has identified an Anatolian carpet with a similar, but more advanced lozenge design (Yetkin, 1981, plate 47&lt;ref name="Yetkin, 1981"/&gt; in the [[Mevlana Museum]], Konya, dated to the 17th century. She relates these carpets to 19th century Caucasian "Dragon" rugs with a similar lozenge design (p.&amp;nbsp;71&lt;ref name="Yetkin, 1981"/&gt;), and claims that carpets of a type as depicted by van Eyck and Petrus Christus are early Anatolian forerunners to the later Caucasian design.

The main borders of the carpets in the "Paele" and "Lucca Madonna", as well as in "Virgin with Child and Saints" however, each show a non-Oriental undulating trefoil stem.&lt;ref name="Ydema, 1991, p. 9"&gt;Ydema, 1991, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Similar ornaments can be found in the borders of many carpets in Netherlandish paintings from the 15th to the beginning of the 16th century.&lt;ref name="Ydema, 1991, p. 9"/&gt; The fringes of these carpets are often found at the sides of the painted carpets, not at the upper and lower ends. Either did the carpets have an uncommonly square shape, or maybe the artists have used some license and improvised with the authentic models. Alternatively, the carpets depicted by van Eyck and Petrus Christus could be of Western European manufacture. The undulating trefoil (clover) design is a well-known feature of Western Gothic ornament.&lt;ref name="Ydema, 1991, p. 9"/&gt;

== Specific carpet types ==

=== Mamluk and Ottoman Cairene carpets ===

From the middle of the 15th century onwards, a type of carpet was produced in Egypt which is characterized by a dominant central medallion, or three to five medallions in a row along the vertical axis. Numerous smaller ornaments are placed around the medallions, such as eight-pointed stars, or small ornaments composed of stylized floral elements.  The innumerable small geometric and floral ornaments give a kaleidoscopic impression. Sixty of these carpets were given to the English cardinal [[Thomas Wolsey]] in exchange for a license for Venetian merchants to import wine to England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beattie|first1=May H.|title=The Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection of Oriental Rugs|date=1972|publisher=The Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection|location=Castagnola|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known painting representing a Mamluk carpet is Giovanni Bellinis "Portrait of the Doge of Venice Loredan and his four advisers" from 1507. A French master depicted "The Three De Coligny brothers" in 1555. Another representation can be found on Ambrosius Frankens "The Last Supper", about 1570. The large medallion is depicted in a way that it forms the nimbus of the head of Christ. The characteristic mamluk carpet ornaments are clearly visible. Ydema has documented a total of 16 dateable representations of Mamluk carpets.&lt;ref&gt;Ydema 1991, p. 19–20&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1517 Ottoman conquest of the Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt, two different cultures merged, as is seen on Mamluk carpets woven after this date. After the conquest, the Cairene weavers adopted an Ottoman Turkish design.&lt;ref name="Ottoman Cairene carpet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ottoman-Cairene carpet in the Met. Museum of Art|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/452308|accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production of these carpets continued in Egypt into the early 17th century.&lt;ref name="Ottoman Cairene carpets"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pinner|first1=R.|last2=Franses|first2=M.|title=East Mediterranean carpets in the Victoria and Albert Museum|journal=Hali|date=1981|volume=IV|issue=1|pages=39–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; A carpet of the Ottoman Cairene type is depicted in Ludovicus Finsonius' painting "The Annunciation". Its border design and guard borders are the same as a carpet in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam.&lt;ref&gt;Ydema 1991, p. 21–25&lt;/ref&gt; A similar carpet has been depicted by Adriaen van der Venne in "Geckie met de Kous", 1630. [[Peter Paul Rubens]] and [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]]s "Christ in the House of Mary and Martha", 1628, shows the characteristic S-stems ending in double sickle-shaped lancet leaves. Various carpets of the Ottoman Cairene type are depicted in [[Moretto da Brescia]]s frescoes in the "Sala delle Dame" at the [[Palazzo Salvadego]] in Brescia, Italy.

=== "Chequerboard"- or Compartment carpets from the 17. century ===

An extremely rare group of carpets, "chequerboard" carpets were assumed to be a later and derivative continuum of the Mamluk and Ottoman Cairene group of carpets. Only about 30 of these carpets survived. They are distinguished by their design composed of rows of squares with triangles in each corner enclosing a star pattern. All "chequerboard" carpets have borders with cartouches and lobed medallions. Their attribution is still under debate. The colours and patterns resemble those seen in Mamluk carpets, however, they are "S-spun" and "Z-twisted" and thus similar to early anatolian and caucasian carpets. Since the early days of carpet science they are attributed to [[Damascus]]. Pinner and Franses champion this attribution because Syria was part first of the Mamluk, later of the Ottoman Empire at that time. This would explain the similarities with the colours and patterns of the Cairene carpets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pinner|first1=Robert|last2=Franses|first2=Michael|title=East mediterranean carpets in the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum|journal=Hali|date=1981|volume=4|issue=1|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current dating of the chequerboard carpets is also consistent with European collection inventories from the early 17th century. Carpets of the "chequerboard" type are depicted on [[Pietro Paolini]]s (1603−1681) "''Self portrait''", as well as on [[Gabriël Metsu]]s painting "''The musical party''".

=== Large Ushak (star and medallion) carpets ===
In contrast to the relatively large number of surviving carpets of this type, relatively few of them are represented in Renaissance paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Ydema 1991, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Star Ushak''' carpets were often woven in large formats. As such, they represent a typical product of higher organized, town manufacture. They are characterized by large dark blue star shaped primary medallions in infinite repeat on a red ground field containing a secondary floral scroll. The design was likely influenced by northwest Persian book design, or by Persian carpet medallions.&lt;ref name="Star Ushak"&gt;{{cite web|title=Star Ushak, Metropolitan Museum of Art|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/451471|accessdate=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As compared to the medallion Ushak carpets, the concept of the infinite repeat in star Ushak carpets is more accentuated and in keeping with the early Turkish design tradition.&lt;ref name="Star Ushak - Turkish design"&gt;{{cite book|title=Tapis - Present de l'orient a l'occident|date=1989|publisher=L'Institut du Monde Arabe|location=Paris|isbn=9782906062283|page=4|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their strong allusion to the inifinite repeat, the star Ushak design can be used on carpets of various size and in many varying dimensions.

'''Medallion Ushak''' carpets usually have a red or blue field decorated with a floral trellis or leaf tendrils, ovoid primary medallions alternating with smaller eight-lobed stars, or lobed medallions, intertwined with floral tracery. Their border frequently contains palmettes on a floral and leaf scroll, and pseudo-kufic characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medallion Ushak carpet at the Metropolitan Museum of Art|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/445311|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The best known representation of a Medallion Ushak was painted in 1656 by [[Johannes Vermeer|Vermeer]] in his painting [[The Procuress (Vermeer)|"The Procuress"]]. It is placed horizontally; the upper or lower end with the star-shaped corner medallion can be seen. Under the woman's hand which holds the glass, a part of a characteristic Ushak medallion can be seen. The carpet seen on Vermeer's "Music lesson", "Girl reading a letter at an open window", and "The Concert" hardly show any differences in the details of the design or the weaving structure indicate that all three pictures might trace back to one single carpet Vermeer might have had at his studio. The painings by Vermeer, Steen, and Verkolje depict a special type of Ushak carpet of which no surviving counterpart is known. It is characterized by its rather sombre colours, coarse weaving, and patterns with a more degenerated curvilinear design.&lt;ref&gt;Ydema 1991, p. 39–45&lt;/ref&gt;

Carpets remained an important way of enlivening the background of full-length portraits throughout the 16th and 17th centuries, for example in the English portraits of [[William Larkin (painter)|William Larkin]].&lt;ref&gt;King &amp; Sylvester, 19&lt;/ref&gt;

The finely-knotted silk carpets woven in the time of [[Shah Abbas I]] at [[Kashan]] and [[Isfahan]] are rarely represented in paintings, as they were doubtless very unusual in European homes;&lt;ref&gt;Examples in Polish collections led to their being miscalled "Polish carpets" in the 19th century, a misnomer that has stuck: "representations of 'Polish' silk rugs in paintings are rare" report Dimand and Mailey 1973, p.59.&lt;/ref&gt; however, ''A Lady playing the Theorbo''. by [[Gerard Terborch]] ([[Metropolitan Museum of Art]],  14.40.617) shows such a carpet laid upon the table on which the lady's cavalier is sitting.&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Dimand and Jean Mailey, ''Oriental Rugs in The Metropolitan Museum of Art,'' p. 60, fig.83.&lt;/ref&gt; Floral "Isfahan" carpets of the [[Herat]] type, on the other hand, were exported in great numbers to Portugal, Spain and the Netherlands, and are often represented in interiors painted by Velásquez, Rubens, Van Dyck, Vermeer, Terborch, de Hooch, Bol and Metsu, where the dates established for the paintings provide a yardstick for establishing the chronology of the designs.&lt;ref&gt;Dimand and Mailey 1973, p 67, illustrating floral Herat rugs in  ''A Visit to the Nursery'' by [[Gabriel Metsu]] (Metropolitan Museum of Art,  17.190.20), p. 67,fig. 94; ''Portrait of Omer Talon'', by [[Philippe de Champaigne]], 1649 ([[National Gallery of Art, Washington]], p.70, fig. 98); ''Woman with a Water Jug'', by Jan Vermeer (Metropolitan Museum of Art, 89.15.21, p.71, fig. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anthony van Dyck]]'s royal and aristocratic subjects had mostly progressed to Persian carpets, but less wealthy sitters are still shown with the Turkish types. The 1620 "Portrait of Abraham Graphaeus" by [[Cornelis de Vos]], and [[Thomas de Keyser]]s "Portrait of an unknown man" (1626) and "Portrait of Constantijn Huyghens and his clerk" (1627) are amongst the earliest paintings depicting a new type of Ottoman Turkish manufactory carpet, which was exported to Europe in large quantities, probably in order to meet the increasing demand. A large number of similar carpets were preserved in Transylvania, which was an important center of Turkish carpet trade during the 15th–17th century. Hence carpets of this type are known by a term of convenience as "Transylvanian carpets".&lt;ref&gt;Ydema 1991, p. 48–51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ionescu, Transylvanian rugs"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ionescu|first1=Stefano|title=Antique Ottoman Rugs in Transylvania|date=2005|publisher=Verduci Editore|location=Rome|edition=1st|url=http://www.transylvanianrugs.com/pdf/01.pdf|accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pieter de Hooch]]s 1663 painting "Portrait of a family making music" depicts an Ottoman prayer rug of the "Transylvanian" type.&lt;ref&gt;Ydema 1991, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; In the American colonies Isaac Royall and his family were painted by [[Robert Feke]] in 1741, posed round a table spread with a [[Bergama]] rug.&lt;ref&gt;In the collection of Harvard University Law School; illustrated in Dimand and Mailey 1973, p.193, fig. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the mid-century European direct trade with [[India]] brought [[Mughal (tribe)|Mughal]] versions of Persian patterns to Europe.  Painters of the [[Dutch Golden Age]] showed their skill by depiction of light effects on table-carpets, like [[Vermeer]] in his ''Music Lesson'' ([[Royal Collection]]).  By this date they have become common in the homes of the reasonably well-to-do, as is shown by historical documentation of inventories. Carpets are sometimes depicted in scenes of debauchery from the prosperous [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;King &amp; Sylvester, pp. 22-23&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the century Oriental carpets had lost much of their status as prestige objects, and the grandest sitters for portraits were more likely to be shown on the high-quality Western carpets, like [[Savonnerie manufactory|Savonneries]], now being produced, whose less intricate patterns were also easier to depict in a [[painterly]] manner. A number of [[orientalism|Orientalist]] European painters continued to accurately depict Oriental carpets, now usually in Oriental settings.

The perception of Oriental carpets during the Renaissance is characterized by three main aspects: 
# Due to their perceived rarity, preciousness and strangeness, Oriental carpets were depicted as a background for saints and religious scenes. Later on, the religious iconography was taken over by politically powerful persons in order to assert their status and power.
# Oriental carpets were more generally perceived as a rare commodity, and objects of luxury and decoration. From the mid 16th century onwards, the iconological context sometimes extended towards the idea of profligacy or vanity.
# When contacts, often of a violent nature, grew closer between the Islamic world and Europe, Oriental carpets were sometimes used as a symbol of Christian self-assertion.
In any case, Oriental carpets were used in Western Europe in different ways and contexts than in the Islamic world, and their original cultural context was never fully understood.&lt;ref name="Carrier, 2008"/&gt;

=== Sacred Ground - or "Christian Oriental Carpets"? ===
Oriental carpets appear for the first time on early Renaissance paintings of the late 12th century. In most cases the carpets serve as a background for religious scenes. Saints were depicted enthroned or standing on carpets, thus being elated, and separated from their surroundings.
Ordinary people, often the donors of the painting, were sometimes allowed to participate in the atmosphere of holiness by depicting them near the holy person, or literally kneeling or standing "on the same carpet" as the saint. This context is still understood and at times used today.&lt;ref name="Pope's coffin placed on Bijar carpet, 2005"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pope John Paul II's coffin placed on a Bijar carpet during his funeral mass|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/europe/article2919279.ece|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative interpretation of the religious context has been proposed by V. Gantzhorn in 1998: He compared in detail the patterns and symbols of both the Renaissance paintings and surviving carpets with ancient ornaments, for example with [[Armenian art|Armenian]] [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|illuminated manuscripts]]. He concluded that the majority of the surviving and painted carpets alike were produced by Christian Armenian weavers. The hidden Christian symbolism of the carpet patterns had therefore made the so-called "Christian oriental carpets" appropriate adornments for Western European Christian churches. Following this hypothesis, the lack of contemporary Western European written sources, which could otherwise provide independent evidence to support Gantzhorns claims, is explained by the fact that the knowledge of the hidden symbols was subject to oral tradition, and restricted to a small religious élite. The [[Armenian Genocide]] had led to the loss of the oral tradition, and, subsequently, to an incorrect "Islamic" attribution of the carpets by the majority of Western art historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gantzhorn|first1=Volkmar|title=Orientalische Teppiche : eine Darstellung der ikonographischen und ikonologischen Entwicklung von den Anfängen bis zum 18. Jahrhundert = Oriental carpets : Their iconographical and iconological development from the beginnings to the 18th century|date=1998|publisher=Taschen|location=Cologne|isbn=3-8228-0397-9|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debate about Gantzhorns hypotheses, which is at times conducted polemically and not entirely free of nationalistic constraints, is still ongoing.

=== Objects of luxury and decoration ===

We do not understand exactly how Renaissance artists thought about the Oriental carpets they were depicting. We know that the Venetian [[Piazza San Marco]] was adorned with carpets hanging from the windows of the surrounding palaces and houses on special occasions. Like the beautiful ladies looking out of the windows, the carpets function as a decorative framework, and highlight the important action which is going on. Similar to the inaccurate [[pseudo-kufic]] writing in contemporary paintings, the European artists borrowed something from another culture which they, essentially, did not understand.&lt;ref name="Carrier, 2008"/&gt;

In a series of letters&lt;ref name="Letters by AD"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rupprich|first1=Hans (ed.)|title=A. Dürer. Schriftlicher Nachlass / Writings|date=1956|publisher=Deutscher Verein für Kunstwissenschaft|location=Berlin|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; from Venice dated 18 August - 13 October 1506,&lt;ref name="Erdmann, Europe and the Oriental Rug"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdmann|first1=Kurt|title=Europa und der Orientteppich / Europe and the Oriental Rug|date=1962|publisher=Florian Kupferberg Verlag|location=Mainz|page=49|edition=1st|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; the German painter [[Albrecht Dürer]] tells his friend [[Willibald Pirckheimer]] about his efforts to buy two carpets for him in Venice:

{{Quotation|''Vnd dy 2 tebich will mir Anthoni Kolb awff daz hubschpt, preytest vnd wolfeillest helfen khawffen. So jch sy hab, will jch sy dem jungen Im Hoff geben, daz er ys ewch einschlache. Awch will jch sehen noch den kranchs federen.''&lt;br&gt;
"Anthoni Kolb will help me buying 2 carpets, the nicest, broadest and cheapest [we can get]. As soon as I have them, I will hand them over to the young Im Hoff, and he will prepare them for transport. I will look for crane feathers as well."

(18 August 1506)
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
''Jtem allen fleis hab jch an kertt mit den tewichen, kan aber kein preiten an kumen. Sy sind al schmall vnd lang. Aber noch hab jch altag forschung dornoch, awch der Anthoni Kolb.''&lt;br&gt;
"I've done all I could with the carpets, but I cannot get any of the broad ones. They are all narrow and oblong. I'm continuing my search every day, Anthoni Kolb as well."

(8 September 1506)
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
''Jch hab awch zwen dewich bestelt, dy würd jch morgen tzalen. Aber jch hab sy nit wolfell kunen kawffen.''&lt;br&gt;
"I've ordered two carpets, and will pay for them tomorrow. But I could not buy at a cheap price."

(13 October 1506)|Albrecht Dürer, letters from Venice to Willibald Pirckheimer&lt;ref name="Letters by AD"/&gt;}}

Dürer was buying various exotic luxury goods for Pirckheimer in Venice, and he mentions the two carpets amongst gold, jewels, or crane feathers. We do not know if Dürer in any way attributed artistic value to these carpets. No oriental carpets were ever depicted by Dürer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Raby|first1=Julian|title=Venice, Dürer, and the oriental mode|date=1982|publisher=Islamic Art Publications|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-0856671623|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A very common type of [[genre painting]] of the [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch Golden Age]] and [[Flemish Baroque painting|Flemish Baroque]], the so-called [[Merry Company]] type of painting, depicts a group of people enjoying themselves, usually seated with drinks, and often music-making. In these pictures, Oriental carpets often cover and decorate the table, or are spread over the furniture. As such, they either underline the wealth and respectability of the portrayed, or add a context of exoticism and profligacy to brothel scenes, or scenes of debauchery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Westermann|first1=Mariët|title=A worldly art : the Dutch Republic, 1585-1718|date=2007|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT|isbn=978-0300107234|edition=2nd reprinted}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 16th century, Oriental carpets were often depicted in [[still life]] paintings. Assorted valuable, exotic objects like Chinese porcelain bowls and animals like parrots are depicted, often with an allegorical meaning, or symbolizing "[[vanitas]]", the futility of human life. The allusion to futility is made apparent by the inclusion of symbols like a human skull, or inscriptions quoting the biblical book of [[Ecclesiastes]] {{bibleref2-nb|Ecclesiastes|1:2;12:8|KJV}}. As early as 1533, Hans Holbein's painting [[The Ambassadors (Holbein)|"The Ambassadors"]] prominently shows an [[anamorphic projection]] of a human skull. Objects in still lifes, regardless of their allegorical meaning, are often placed on precious velvet table cloths, marble plates, or oriental carpets. As such, Oriental carpets are treated similar to other precious objects or materials, the focus being on their material value and decorative effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bergström|first1=Ingvar|title=Dutch still-life painting in the seventeenth century|date=1983|publisher=Hacker art books|location=New York|isbn=978-0878172795|edition=Facsim.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Objects of European self-assertion ===
In September 1479 the Venetian painter [[Gentile Bellini]] was sent by the Venetian Senate as a cultural [[ambassador]] to Sultan [[Mehmed the Conqueror]]'s new [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] capital [[Constantinople]] as part of the peace settlement between Venice and the Turks. [[Giorgio Vasari|Vasari]] wrote that Bellini "portrayed the Emperor Mahomet from the life so well, that it was held a miracle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vasari|first1=Giorgio|editor1-last=du C. de Vere|editor1-first=Gaston|editor2-last=Jack|editor2-first=Philip|title=The lives of the most excellent painters, sculptors, and architects|date=2005|publisher=Modern Library|location=New York|isbn=978-0375760365|edition=Pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dating and authorship of the portrait by Bellini have been placed in question,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=ng3099 |title=The Sultan Mehmet II |publisher=Nationalgallery.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070826181140/http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=NG3099 |archivedate=2007-08-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, Bellini is the first great Renaissance painter who actually visited an Islamic Sultan's court.

The influence of Bellinis encounter with the Islamic world is reflected by Oriental motifs appearing in several of his paintings. His 1507 ''St. Mark Preaching at Alexandria'' anachronistically shows the patron saint of Venice preaching to Muslims. The architecture shown in the background is an incongruous assortment of buildings, not corresponding to contemporary Islamic architecture. The stage-like setting for St Mark's sermon is adorned by exotic animals like a camel and a giraffe, as well as architectural elements like an ancient Egyptian [[obelisk]], in the background.&lt;ref name="Carrier, 2008"/&gt; Bellini's use of these decorative elements resembles the way Oriental carpets are depicted in 14th and 15th century Renaissance paintings: They are depictions of the exotic and the precious, they set a stage for an important person or action, but, as yet, essentially ignore their original cultural context.

The 1547 depiction of King [[Edward VI of England]] standing on an Oriental carpet, in front of a throne on the same carpet asserts the young [[Fidei defensor]]'s strength and power, by a deliberate echo of the pose of his father's famous portrait by Holbein.

Nothing is known about how much [[Ambrosius Francken]] knew about the cultural background of the Mamluk carpet which he used as a decoration for his ''Last Supper''. The painting can only be roughly dated to the 16th century. The use of the central medallion of an Oriental carpet to highlight the [[Halo (religious iconography)|nimbus]] of Christ, however, represents a special case: The use of the motif could either have resulted from a mere similarity of the two pictorial patterns, but it can also be understood as an assertion of Renaissance Christian predominance. Europeans had reasons to fear the Islamic world: In 1529, [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] was [[Siege of Vienna|besieging Vienna]], and the Ottoman Empire remained a constant threat to Western Europe until the late 17th century.

In his 1502–9 cycle of the Piccolomini library frescoes at the Dome of Siena, [[Pinturicchio]] depicts [[Pope Pius II]] convoking, as the Latin inscription explains, a Diet of Princes at [[Mantua]] to proclaim a new [[crusade]] in 1459. On the eighth fresco, a table in front of the Pope's throne is covered by an Oriental carpet. It was hypothesized that the carpet might have been a trophy from previous expeditions.&lt;ref name="Carrier, 2008"/&gt;

Precious Oriental carpets were part of the so-called "''[[:de:Türkenbeute|Türkenbeute]]''" (lit.: "Turkish loot") from the [[Battle of Vienna|siege of Vienna]] which ended on 12 September 1683 and their new Christian owners proudly reported back home about their plunder. Carpets exist with inscriptions indicating the new owner, and the date when it was acquired:

{{Quotation|'''''A. D. Wilkonski XII septembris 1683 z pod Wiednia''''' &lt;br&gt; "A. D. Wilkonski, Vienna, 12 September 1683"|Inscription on the backside of an Oriental "Polonaise" carpet, once in the Moore collection, current location unknown.&lt;ref name="Erdmann, Seven Hundred Years of Oriental Carpets, 1970"/&gt;}}

The majority of Oriental carpets, however, continue to be depicted as objects with visual appeal, without political connotations, but ignoring their original cultural context. It was reserved to a later century to try and reach out for a better understanding of the carpets within their Islamic cultural context. Whilst Islamic carpets initially served to adorn Renaissance paintings, later on the paintings contributed to a better understanding of the carpets. Comparative art historical research on Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting thus adds another facette, and leads to a better understanding of the highly multifaceted, and sometimes ambivalent, image of the Ottomans during the Western European Renaissance.

A '''parody''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ær|ə|d|i}}); also called a '''spoof''', '''send-up''', '''take-off''', '''lampoon''', '''play on (something)''', '''caricature''', or '''joke''' is a work created to imitate, make fun of, or comment on an [[original work]]—its subject, author, style, or some other target—by means of [[satire|satiric]] or [[irony|ironic]] [[imitation]]. As the literary theorist [[Linda Hutcheon]] puts it, "parody ... is imitation, not always at the expense of the parodied text." Another critic, Simon Dentith, defines parody as "any cultural practice which provides a relatively [[polemic]]al allusive imitation of another cultural production or practice."&lt;ref&gt;Dentith (2000) p.9&lt;/ref&gt;
Parody may be found in art or culture, including [[literature]], [[parody music|music]] (although "parody" in music has an earlier, somewhat different meaning than for other art forms), [[animation]], [[Video game|gaming]], and [[film]].

The writer and critic [[John Gross]] observes in his ''Oxford Book of Parodies'', that parody seems to flourish on territory somewhere between [[pastiche]] ("a composition in another artist's manner, without satirical intent") and [[burlesque]] (which "fools around with the material of high literature and adapts it to low ends").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=J.M.W.

==Origins==
According to [[Aristotle]] (''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', ii. 5), [[Hegemon of Thasos]] was the inventor of a kind of parody; by slightly altering the wording in well-known poems he transformed the sublime into the ridiculous. In ancient [[Greek literature]], a ''parodia'' was a narrative poem imitating the style and prosody of [[Epic poetry|epic]]s "but treating light, satirical or [[mock-heroic]] subjects."&lt;ref&gt;(Denith, 10)&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the components of the Greek word are παρά ''para'' "beside, counter, against" and ᾠδή ''oide'' "song." Thus, the original Greek word παρῳδία ''parodia'' has sometimes been taken to mean "counter-song", an imitation that is set against the original. The ''Oxford English Dictionary'', for example, defines parody as imitation "turned as to produce a ridiculous effect."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Hutcheon, 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Because ''par-'' also has the non-antagonistic meaning of ''beside'', "there is nothing in ''parodia'' to necessitate the inclusion of a concept of ridicule."&lt;ref&gt;(Hutcheon, 32)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Old Comedy]] contained parody, even the gods could be made fun of. ''[[The Frogs]]'' portrays the hero-turned-god [[Heracles]] as a glutton and the God of Drama [[Dionysus]] as cowardly and unintelligent. The traditional trip to the Underworld story is parodied as Dionysus dresses as Heracles to go to the Underworld, in an attempt to bring back a Poet to save Athens.

In the 2nd century AD, [[Lucian of Samosata]], a Greek-language writer in [[Syria]], created a parody of travel/geography texts like [[Indica (Ctesias)|Indica]] and [[The Odyssey]]. He described the authors of such accounts as liars who had never traveled, nor talked to any credible person who had. In his ironically named book [[True History]] Lucian delivers a story which exaggerates the hyperbole and improbable claims of those stories. Sometimes described as the first [[Science Fiction]], along the lines of [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]], the [[Character (arts)|characters]] travel to the moon, engage in interplanetary war with the help of aliens they meet there, and then return to the earth to experience civilization inside a 200 mile long creature generally interpreted as being a whale. This is a parody of [[Ctesias]]' claims that India has a one-legged race of humans with a single foot so huge it can be used as an umbrella, [[Homer]]'s stories of one-eyed giants, and so on.

[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] writers explained parody as an imitation of one poet by another for humorous effect.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} In [[France|French]] [[Neoclassical literature]], ''parody'' was also a type of poem where one work imitates the style of another to produce a humorous effect. The [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] created [[satyr]] [[Play (theatre)|play]]s which parodied [[tragic play]]s, often with performers dressed like satyrs.

==Music==
{{Main|Parody music}}
In [[classical music]], as a technical term, ''parody'' refers to a reworking of one kind of composition into another (for example, a [[motet]] into a keyboard work as [[Girolamo Cavazzoni]], [[Antonio de Cabezón]], and [[Alonso Mudarra]] all did to [[Josquin des Prez]] [[motet]]s).&lt;ref name=g1&gt;Tilmouth, Michael and Richard Sherr. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/20937 "Parody (i)"]'  Grove Music Online, Oxford Music Online, accessed 19 February 2012 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; More commonly, a [[parody mass]] (''missa parodia'') or an [[oratorio]] used extensive quotation from other vocal works such as motets or [[cantata]]s; [[Tomás Luis de Victoria|Victoria]], [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]], [[Orlande de Lassus|Lassus]], and other composers of the 16th century used this technique. The term is also sometimes applied to procedures common in the [[Baroque music|Baroque period]], such as when [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] reworks music from [[Bach cantata|cantata]]s in his ''[[Christmas Oratorio]]''.

The musicological definition of the term ''parody'' has now generally been supplanted by a more general meaning of the word. In its more contemporary usage, [[parody music|musical parody]] usually has humorous, even satirical intent, in which familiar musical ideas or lyrics are lifted into a different, often incongruous, context.&lt;ref name=g2&gt;Burkholder, J. Peter. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/52918pg8  "Borrowing"], Grove Music Online, Oxford Music Online, accessed 19 February. 2012 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Musical parodies may imitate or refer to the peculiar style of a composer or artist, or even a general style of music. For example, ''The Ritz Roll and Rock'', a song and dance number performed by [[Fred Astaire]] in the movie ''[[Silk Stockings]]'', parodies the [[Rock and Roll]] genre. Conversely, while the best-known work of [[Weird Al Yankovic]] is based on particular popular songs, it also often utilises wildly incongruous elements of [[popular culture|pop culture]] for comedic effect.

==English term==
[[File:Jan Brueghel the Younger, Satire on Tulip Mania, c. 1640.jpg|thumb|''{{Interlanguage link multi|Allegory of the Tulip omania|de|3=Allegorie der Tulipomanie}}'', persiflage on the [[tulip mania]], by [[Jan Brueghel the Younger]] (1640s]]

The first usage of the word ''parody'' in English cited in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' is in [[Ben Jonson]], in ''Every Man in His Humour'' in 1598: "A Parodie, a parodie! to make it absurder than it was." The next citation comes from [[John Dryden]] in 1693, who also appended an explanation, suggesting that the word was in common use, meaning to make fun of or re-create what you are doing.

==Modernist and post-modernist parody==
In the 20th century, parody has been heightened as the central and most representative artistic device, the catalysing agent of artistic creation and innovation.&lt;ref name="Sheinberg 2000p141"&gt;Sheinberg (2000) pp.141, 150&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stavans1997p37"&gt;Stavans (1997) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ro6a1EyaS2AC&amp;pg=PA37 p.37]&lt;/ref&gt; This most prominently happened in the second half of the century with [[postmodernism]], but earlier [[modernism]] and [[Russian formalism]] had anticipated this perspective.&lt;ref name="Sheinberg 2000p141"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bradbury, Malcolm [https://books.google.com/books?id=hUtOMoCNHyIC ''No, not Bloomsbury''] p.53, quoting [[Boris Eikhenbaum]]: {{quotation|Nearly all periods of artistic innovation have had a strong parodic impulse, advancing generic change. As the Russian formalist Boris Eichenbaum once put it: "In the evolution of each genre, there are times when its use for entirely serious or elevated objectives degenerates and produces a comic or parodic form....And thus is produced the regeneration of the genre: it finds new possibilities and new forms."}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the Russian formalists, parody was a way of liberation from the background text that enables to produce new and autonomous artistic forms.&lt;ref name="Hutcheon85p28"&gt;Hutcheon (1985) pp.28, 35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Boris Eikhenbaum]] ''Theory of the "Formal Method"'' (1925) and ''O. Henry and the Theory of the Short Story'' (1925)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jorge Luis Borges]]'s (1939) short story "[[Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote]]", is often regarded as predicting postmodernism and conceiving the ideal of the ultimate parody.&lt;ref name="Stavans1997p31"&gt;Stavans (1997) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ro6a1EyaS2AC&amp;pg=PA31 p.31]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Bellalouna, Michael L. LaBlanc, Ira Mark Milne (2000) [https://books.google.com/books?id=CecJAQAAMAAJ ''Literature of Developing Nations for Students: L-Z''] p.50&lt;/ref&gt; In the broader sense of Greek ''parodia'', parody can occur when whole elements of one work are lifted out of their context and reused, not necessarily to be ridiculed.&lt;ref name="Elices2004p90"&gt;Elices (2004) p.90 quotation: {{quotation|From these words, it can be inferred that Genette's conceptualisation does not diverge from Hutcheon's, in the sense that he does not mention the component of ridicule that is suggested by the prefix ''paros''. Genette alludes to the re-interpretative capacity of parodists in order to confer an artistic autonomy to their works.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional definitions of parody usually only discuss parody in the stricter sense of something intended to ridicule the text it parodies. There is also a broader, extended sense of parody that may not include ridicule, and may be based on many other uses and intentions.&lt;ref name="Elices2004p90"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hutcheon85p50"&gt;Hutcheon (1985) p.50&lt;/ref&gt; The broader sense of parody, parody done with intent other than ridicule, has become prevalent in the modern parody of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Hutcheon85p50"/&gt; In the extended sense, the modern parody does not target the parodied text, but instead uses it as a weapon to target something else.&lt;ref name="Hutcheon85p52"&gt;Hutcheon (1985) p.52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yunck 1963&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for the prevalence of the extended, recontextualizing type of parody in the 20th century is that artists have sought to connect with the past while registering differences brought by [[modernity]].&lt;ref&gt;Hutcheon (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=January 2012}} Major modernist examples of this recontextualizing parody include [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', which incorporates elements of [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' in a 20th-century Irish context, and [[T. S. Eliot]]'s ''[[The Waste Land]]'',&lt;ref name="Hutcheon85p52"/&gt; which incorporates and recontextualizes elements of a vast range of prior texts, including [[Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy|The Inferno]]''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} The work of [[Andy Warhol]] is another prominent example of the modern "recontextualizing" parody.&lt;ref name="Hutcheon85p52"/&gt; According to French literary theorist [[Gérard Genette]], the most rigorous and elegant form of parody is also the most economical, that is a ''minimal parody'', the one that literally reprises a known text and gives it a new meaning.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gérard Genette]] (1982) [https://books.google.com/books?id=KbYzNp94C9oC&amp;pg=PA16 ''Palimpsests: literature in the second degree''] p.16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sangsue2006p72"&gt;Sangsue (2006) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z5MWFcIEE7EC&amp;pg=PA72 p.72] quotation: {{quotation|Genette individua la forma "piú rigorosa" di parodia nella "parodia minimale", consistente nella ripresa letterale di un testo conosciuto e nella sua applicazione a un nuovo contesto, come nella citazione deviata dal suo senso}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blank parody, in which an artist takes the skeletal form of an art work and places it in a new context without ridiculing it, is common.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} [[Pastiche]] is a closely related [[genre]], and parody can also occur when characters or settings belonging to one work are used in a humorous or ironic way in another, such as the transformation of minor characters [[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]] from [[Shakespeare]]'s drama [[Hamlet]] into the principal characters in a comedic perspective on the same events in the play (and film) ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead]]''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Similarly, [[Mishu Hilmy]]'s ''Trapped in the Netflix'' uses parody to [[Deconstruction|deconstruct]] contemporary [[Netflix]] shows like [[Mad Men]] providing commentary through popular characters. Don Draper [[mansplaining]] about mansplaining, [[Luke Danes]] monologizing about a lack of independence while embracing [[codependency]].&lt;ref name="pink"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Willett|first1=Bec|title=Trapped in the Netflix at iO|url=http://perform.ink/review-trapped-netflix-io/|accessdate=23 March 2018|publisher=''[[Performink]]''|date=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Flann O'Brien]]'s novel ''[[At Swim-Two-Birds]]'', for example, mad [[King Sweeney]], [[Fionn mac Cumhaill|Finn MacCool]], a [[pookah]], and an assortment of [[cowboy]]s all assemble in an inn in [[Dublin]]: the mixture of mythic characters, characters from [[genre]] fiction, and a quotidian setting combine for a humor that is not directed at any of the characters or their authors. This combination of established and identifiable characters in a new setting is not the same as the [[post-modernist]] trope of using historical characters in fiction out of context to provide a metaphoric element.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==Reputation==
Sometimes the reputation of a parody outlasts the reputation of what is being parodied. For example, ''[[Don Quixote]]'', which mocks the traditional [[knight errant]] tales, is much better known than the novel that inspired it, ''[[Amadis de Gaula]]'' (although Amadis is mentioned in the book). Another case is the [[novel]] ''[[Shamela]]''  by [[Henry Fielding]] (1742), which was a parody of the gloomy [[epistolary novel]] ''[[Pamela (novel)|Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded]]'' (1740) by [[Samuel Richardson]]. Many of [[Lewis Carroll]]'s parodies of Victorian didactic verse for children, such as "[[You Are Old, Father William]]", are much better known than the (largely forgotten) originals. [[Stella Gibbons]]'s comic novel ''[[Cold Comfort Farm]]'' has eclipsed the pastoral novels of [[Mary Webb]] which largely inspired it.

In more recent times, the television sitcom ''[['Allo 'Allo!]]'' is perhaps better known than the drama ''[[Secret Army (TV series)|Secret Army]]'' which it parodies.

Some artists carve out careers by making parodies. One of the best-known examples is that of [["Weird Al" Yankovic]]. His career of parodying other musical acts and their songs has outlasted many of the artists or bands he has parodied.  Yankovic is not required under law to get permission to parody; as a personal rule, however, he does seek permission to parody a person's song before recording it. Several artists, such as rapper [[Chamillionaire]] and Seattle-based [[grunge]] band [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] stated that Yankovic's parodies of their respective songs were excellent, and many artists have considered being parodied by him to be a badge of honor.&lt;ref name="Ayers"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/07/24/weird-al-interview-mandatory-fun/|title=‘Weird Al’ Yankovic Explains His Secret Formula for Going Viral and Hitting No. 1|last=Ayers|first=Mike|date=24 July 2014|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamersly"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.miami.com/quotweird-alquot-yankovic-brings-his-masterful-musical-parody-south-florida-article|title="Weird Al" Yankovic brings his masterful musical parody to South Florida|last=Hamersly|first=Michael|work=[[Miami Herald]]|accessdate=12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US legal system the point that in most cases a parody of a work constitutes fair use was upheld in the case of [[Rick Dees]], who decided to use 29 seconds of the music from the song ''When Sonny Gets Blue'' to parody [[Johnny Mathis]]' singing style even after being refused permission. An appeals court upheld the trial court's decision that this type of parody represents fair use. ''[[Fisher v. Dees]]'' [[Court citation|794 F.2d 432]] (9th Cir. 1986)

==Film parodies==
{{Main article|Parody film}}
{{Original research|section|date=May 2009}}
Some [[Genre|genre theorists]], following [[Bakhtin]], see parody as a natural development in the life cycle of any [[genre]]; this idea has proven especially fruitful for genre film theorists. Such theorists note that [[Western movie]]s, for example, after the classic stage defined the conventions of the genre, underwent a parody stage, in which those same conventions were ridiculed and critiqued. Because audiences had seen these classic Westerns, they had expectations for any new Westerns, and when these expectations were inverted, the audience laughed.

Perhaps the earliest parody film was the 1922 ''[[Mud and Sand]]'', a [[Stan Laurel]] film that made fun of [[Rudolph Valentino]]'s film ''[[Blood and Sand (1922 film)|Blood and Sand]]''. Laurel specialized in parodies in the mid-1920s, writing and acting in a number of them. Some were send-ups of popular films, such as ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (disambiguation)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]''&lt;!-- there are several such films so don't disambiguate this link --&gt;—parodied in the comic ''[[Dr. Pyckle and Mr. Pryde]]'' (1926). Others were spoofs of Broadway plays, such as ''[[No, No, Nanette]]'' (1925), parodied as ''[[Yes, Yes, Nanette]]'' (1925). In 1940 [[Charlie Chaplin]] created a satirical comedy about [[Adolf Hitler]] with the film ''[[The Great Dictator]]'', following the first-ever Hollywood parody of the Nazis, the [[Three Stooges]]' short subject ''[[You Nazty Spy!]]''.

About 20 years later [[Mel Brooks]] started his career with a Hitler parody as well. After ''[[The Producers (1968 film)|The Producers]]'' (1968), Brooks became one of the most famous film parodists and did spoofs on any kind of film genre. ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'' (1974) is a parody of western films, ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'' (1974) is a [[Frankenstein]] spoof, ''[[Spaceballs]]'' (1987) is a ''[[Star Wars]]'' spoof, and ''[[Robin Hood Men in Tights]]'' (1993) is Brooks' take on the classic Robin Hood tale.

The British comedy group [[Monty Python]] is also famous for its parodies, for example, the [[King Arthur]] spoof ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' (1974), and the [[Jesus]] satire ''[[Life of Brian]]'' (1979). In the 1980s the team of [[David Zucker (filmmaker)|David Zucker]], [[Jim Abrahams]] and [[Jerry Zucker (film director)|Jerry Zucker]] parodied well-established genres such as disaster, war and crime movies with the ''[[Airplane!]]'', ''[[Hot Shots!]]'' and ''[[The Naked Gun|Naked Gun]]'' series respectively. There is a 1989 film parody from Spain of the TV series ''[[The A-Team]]'' called ''El equipo Aahhgg'' directed by José Truchado.

More recently, parodies have taken on whole film genres at once. One of the first was ''[[Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood]]'' and the ''[[Scary Movie (series)|Scary Movie]]'' franchise. Other recent genre parodies include. ''[[Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Friday The 13th]]'', ''[[Not Another Teen Movie]]'', ''[[Date Movie]]'', ''[[Epic Movie]]'', ''[[Meet the Spartans]]'', ''[[Superhero Movie]]'', ''[[Disaster Movie]]'', ''[[Vampires Suck]]'', and ''[[The 41-Year-Old Virgin Who Knocked Up Sarah Marshall and Felt Superbad About It]]'', all of which have been critically panned.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Copyright===
Many parody films have as their target out-of-copyright or non-copyrighted subjects (such as ''Frankenstein'' or Robin Hood) whilst others settle for imitation which does not infringe copyright, but is clearly aimed at a popular (and usually lucrative) subject. The spy film craze of the 1960s, fuelled by the popularity of [[James Bond]] is such an example. In this genre a rare, and possibly unique, example of a parody film taking aim at a non-comedic subject over which it actually holds copyright is the 1967 James Bond spoof ''[[Casino Royale (1967)|Casino Royale]]''. In this case, producer [[Charles K. Feldman]] initially intended to make a serious film, but decided that it would not be able to compete with the established series of Bond films. Hence, he decided to parody the series.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, A. &amp; Hearn, M. (1997) ''Kiss kiss bang bang: the unofficial James Bond film companion'', Batsford, p. 63 {{ISBN|9780713481822}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poetic parodies==
[[Kenneth Baker, Baron Baker of Dorking|Kenneth Baker]] considered poetic parody to take five main forms.&lt;ref&gt;K. Baker ed., ''Unauthorized Versions'' (London 1990) Introduction p. xx–xxii&lt;/ref&gt;
# The first was to use parody to attack the author parodied, as in [[J K Stephen]]'s mimicry of [[Wordsworth]], “Two voices are there: one is of the deep....And one is of an old half-witted sheep.”&lt;ref&gt;K. Baker ed., ''Unauthorized Versions'' (London 1990) p. 429&lt;/ref&gt;
# The second was to pastiche the author's style, as with [[Henry Reed (poet)|Henry Reed]]'s parody of [[T. S. Eliot]], ''Chard Whitlow'': “As we get older we do not get any younger....”&lt;ref&gt;K. Baker ed., ''Unauthorized Versions'' (London 1990) p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;
# The third type reversed (and so undercut) the sentiments of the poem parodied, as with [[Monty Python]]'s ''All Things Dull and Ugly''.
# A fourth approach was to use the target poem as a matrix for inserting unrelated (generally humorous) material&amp;nbsp;– “To have it out or not? That is the question....Thus dentists do make cowards of us all.”&lt;ref&gt;K. Baker ed., ''Unauthorized Versions'' (London 1990) p. 319&lt;/ref&gt;
# Finally, parody may be used to attack contemporary/topical targets by utilizing the format of a well-known piece of verse: “O [[Salman Rushdie|Rushdie]], Rushdie, it's a vile world” ([[Cat Stevens]]).&lt;ref&gt;K. Baker ed., ''Unauthorized Versions'' (London 1990) p. 355&lt;/ref&gt;

A further, more constructive form of poetic parody is one that links the contemporary poet with past forms and past masters through affectionate parodying&amp;nbsp;– thus sharing poetic codes while avoiding some of the [[anxiety of influence]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Cushman ed., ''The Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics'' (Princeton 2012) p. 1003&lt;/ref&gt;

More aggressive in tone are playground poetry parodies, often attacking authority, values and culture itself in a carnivalesque rebellion:&lt;ref&gt;J. Thomas, ''Poetry's Playground'' (2007) p. 45-52&lt;/ref&gt; “Twinkle, Twinkle little star,/ Who the hell do you think you are?”&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in S. Burt ed., ''The Cambridge History of American Poetry'' (Cambridge 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-parody==
{{Main|Self-parody}}
A subset of parody is ''[[self-parody]]'' in which artists parody their own work (as in [[Ricky Gervais]]'s ''[[Extras (sitcom)|Extras]]'') or distinctions of their work (such as [[Antonio Banderas]]'s [[Puss in Boots (Shrek)|Puss in Boots]] in the ''[[Shrek]]'' [[sequel]]s) or an artist or genre repeats elements of earlier works to the point that originality is lost.

==Copyright issues==
{{see also|Plagiarism}}

Although a parody can be considered a [[derivative work]] of a pre-existing, copyrighted work, some countries have ruled that parodies can fall under [[copyright limitation]]s such as [[fair dealing]], or otherwise have fair dealing laws that include parody in their scope.

===United States===
Parodies are protected under the [[fair use]] doctrine of [[United States copyright law]], but the defense is more successful if the usage of an existing copyrighted work is transformative in nature, such as being a critique or commentary upon it.

In ''[[Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.]]'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]  ruled that a rap parody of "[[Oh, Pretty Woman]]" by [[2 Live Crew]] was fair use, as the parody was a distinctive, transformative work designed to ridicule the original song, and that "even if 2 Live Crew's copying of the original's first line of lyrics and characteristic opening bass riff may be said to go to the original's 'heart,' that heart is what most readily conjures up the song for parody, and it is the heart at which parody takes aim."

In 2001, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit|Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals]], in ''[[Suntrust v. Houghton Mifflin]]'', upheld the right of [[Alice Randall]] to publish a parody of ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]'' called ''[[The Wind Done Gone]]'', which told the same story from the point of view of [[Scarlett O'Hara]]'s slaves, who were glad to be rid of her.

In 2007, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] denied a fair use defense in the ''Dr. Seuss Enterprises v. Penguin Books'' case. Citing the ''Campbell v. Acuff-Rose'' decision, they found that a [[satire]] of the [[O. J. Simpson murder case|O.J. Simpson murder trial]] and parody of ''[[The Cat in the Hat]]'' had infringed upon the children's book because it did not provide a commentary function upon that work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fairuse.stanford.edu/Copyright_and_Fair_Use_Overview/chapter9/9-c.html|title=Summaries of Fair Use Cases|author=Richard Stim|work=Stanford Copyright and Fair Use Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15758460119711775481&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr|title=Google Scholar|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
{{update|type=section|Changes from the Copyright Modernization Act, 2012|date=September 2012}}
Under [[Canadian law]], although there is protection for [[fair dealing#Canada|Fair Dealing]], there is no explicit protection for parody and satire. In ''[[Canwest v. Horizon]]'', the publisher of the [[Vancouver Sun]] launched a [[lawsuit]] against a group which had published a pro-[[State of Palestine|Palestinian]] parody of the paper. Alan Donaldson, the judge in the case, [[court ruling|ruled]] that parody is not a [[legal defence|defence]] to a [[Canadian copyright law|copyright]] claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thetyee.ca/Mediacheck/2008/12/11/CanwestSuit/|title=The Tyee&amp;nbsp;– Canwest Suit May Test Limits of Free Speech|date=11 December 2008|work=The Tyee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In 2006 the ''[[Gowers Review of Intellectual Property]]'' recommended that the UK should "create an exception to copyright for the purpose of caricature, parody or pastiche by 2008."&lt;ref&gt;The Stationery Office. (2006) Gowers Review of Intellectual Property. [Online]. Available at [http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/other/0118404830/0118404830.pdf official-documents.gov.uk] (Accessed: 22 February 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Following the first stage of a two-part public consultation, the Intellectual Property Office reported that the information received "was not sufficient to persuade us that the advantages of a new parody exception were sufficient to override the disadvantages to the creators and owners of the underlying work. There is therefore no proposal to change the current approach to parody, caricature and pastiche in the UK."&lt;ref name="Gowers Second Stage Consultation"&gt;UK Intellectual Property Office.

Available at [http://www.ipo.gov.uk/consult-gowers2.pdf ipo.gov.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517005032/http://www.ipo.gov.uk/consult-gowers2.pdf |date=2011-05-17 }} (Accessed: 22 February 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, following the Hargreaves Review in May 2011 (which made similar proposals to the Gowers Review) the Government broadly accepted these proposals.  The current law (effective from 1 October 2014), namely Section 30A&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/2356/regulation/5/made|title=The Copyright and Rights in Performances (Quotation and Parody) Regulations 2014|website=Legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]], now provides an exception to infringement where there is fair dealing of the original work for the purpose of parody (or alternatively for the purpose of caricature or pastiche).  The legislation does not define what is meant by "parody", but the UK IPO&amp;nbsp;– the [[Intellectual Property Office (United Kingdom)]]&amp;nbsp;– suggests&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/359250/Exceptions_to_copyright_-_Guidance_for_creators_and_copyright_owners.pdf|format=PDF|title=Exceptions to copyright : Guidance for creators and copyright owners|website=Gov.uk|accessdate=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; that a "parody" is something that imitates a work
for humorous or satirical effect.  See also [[Fair dealing in United Kingdom law]].

==Internet culture==
Parody is a prominent genre in online culture, thanks in part to the ease with which digital texts may be altered, appropriated, and shared. Japanese kuso and Chinese e'gao are emblematic of the importance of parody in online cultures in Asia. Video mash-ups and other parodic memes, such as humorously-altered Chinese characters, have been particularly popular as a tool for political protest in the People's Republic of China, the government of which maintains an extensive censorship apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Rea, "Spoofing (e’gao) Culture on the Chinese Internet.” In Humour in Chinese Life and Culture: Resistance and Control in Modern Times. Jessica Milner Davis and Jocelyn Chey, eds. Hong Kong: Hong Kong University Press, 2013, pp. 149–172&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese internet slang makes extensive use of puns and parodies on how Chinese characters are pronounced or written, as illustrated in the [https://chinadigitaltimes.net/space/Grass-Mud_Horse_Lexicon:_Browse_by_Topic Grass-Mud Horse Lexicon].

==Social and political uses==
[[File:I did not raise my girl to be a voter3.jpg|right|thumb|Satirical political cartoon that appeared in ''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]'' magazine, October 9, 1915.

Parody is a frequent ingredient in [[satire]] and is often used to make social and political points. Examples include [[Jonathan Swift|Swift]]'s "[[A Modest Proposal]]", which satirized English neglect of Ireland by parodying emotionally disengaged political tracts; and, recently, ''[[The Daily Show]]'' and ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', which parody a news broadcast and a talk show to satirize political and social trends and events.

On the other hand, the writer and frequent parodist [[Vladimir Nabokov]] made a distinction: "Satire is a lesson, parody is a game."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Appel | first1 = Alfred, Jr. | authorlink1 = Alfred Appel | last2 = Nabokov  | first2 = Vladimir | authorlink2 = Vladimir Nabokov | year = 1967 | title = An Interview with Vladimir Nabokov | journal = Wisconsin Studies in Contemporary Literature | volume = VIII | issue = 2 | pages = 127–152 | url = http://lib.ru/NABOKOW/Inter06.txt_with-big-pictures.html | accessdate = 28 Dec 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some events, such as a national tragedy, can be difficult to handle. Chet Clem, Editorial Manager of the news parody publication ''[[The Onion]]'', told ''[[Wikinews]]'' in an interview the questions that are raised when addressing difficult topics:
{{cquote|I know the [[September 11 attacks|September 11]] issue was an obviously very large challenge to approach.  Do we even put out an issue?  What is funny at this time in American history?  Where are the jokes?  Do people want jokes right now?  Is the nation ready to laugh again?  Who knows.  There will always be some level of division in the back room.  It’s also what keeps us on our toes.&lt;ref name=DS&gt;[[n:The Onion: An interview with 'America's Finest News Source'|An interview with The Onion]], David Shankbone, ''[[Wikinews]]'', November 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Parody is by no means necessarily satirical, and may sometimes be done with respect and appreciation of the subject involved, without being a heedless sarcastic attack.

Parody has also been used to facilitate dialogue between cultures or subcultures. Sociolinguist [[Mary Louise Pratt]] identifies parody as one of the "arts of the contact zone", through which marginalized or oppressed groups "selectively appropriate", or imitate and take over, aspects of more empowered cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Pratt (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakespeare often uses a series of parodies to convey his meaning. In the social context of his era, an example can be seen in ''[[King Lear]]'' where the [[Jester|fool]] is introduced with his [[Comb (anatomy)#Other|coxcomb]] to be a parody of the king.

'''Queer theory''' is a field of [[critical theory]] that emerged in the early 1990s out of the fields of [[queer studies]] and [[women's studies]]. Queer theory includes both [[queer]] readings of texts and the theorization of 'queerness' itself.  Heavily influenced by the work of [[Lauren Berlant]], [[Leo Bersani]], [[Judith Butler]], [[Lee Edelman]], [[Jack Halberstam]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Halberstam|first=Jack|title=An audio overview of queer theory in English and Turkish by Jack Halberstam|url=https://archive.org/details/HalberstamQueerTheory-AnkaraTurkey|accessdate=29 May 2014|date=2014-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick]], queer theory builds both upon [[feminist]] challenges to the idea that [[gender]] is part of the [[Essentialism|essential]] self and upon [[gay]]/[[lesbian]] studies' close examination of the [[socially constructed]] nature of [[sexual acts]] and [[Sexual identity|identities]]. Whereas gay/lesbian studies focused its inquiries into natural and unnatural behavior with respect to homosexual behavior, queer theory expands its focus to encompass any kind of sexual activity or identity that falls into [[Normality (behavior)|normative]] and [[deviant]] categories. [[Italian feminist]] and [[film theorist]] [[Teresa de Lauretis]] coined the term ''queer theory'' for a conference she organized at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] in 1990 and a special issue of ''Differences: A Journal of Feminist Cultural Studies'' she edited based on that conference.
 
Through the context of heterosexuality being the origin and foundation of society's heteronormative stability, the concept of queerness focuses on, "mismatches between sex, gender and desire"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Queerness has been associated most prominently with [[bisexual]], lesbian and gay subjects, but its [[analytic framework]] also includes such topics as [[cross-dressing]], [[intersex]] bodies and identities, [[gender ambiguity]] and [[gender-corrective surgery]]. Queer theory holds that individual [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] is a fluid, fragmented, and dynamic collectivity of possible sexualities and it may vary at different points of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Critical Theory Today: A User-friendly Guide|last=Tyson|first=Lois|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=978-0415974097|location=New York|pages=335}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its attempted debunking of stable (and correlated) sexes, genders, and sexualities develops out of the specifically lesbian and gay reworking of the post-structuralist figuring of identity as a constellation of multiple and unstable positions.

Queer theory also examines the discourses of homosexuality developed in the last century in order to place the "queer" into historical context, [[deconstructing]] contemporary arguments both for and against this latest terminology.

==Overview==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2015}}
Queer theory is derived largely from [[post-structuralist]] [[theory]], and deconstruction in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Law and Society: American and Global Perspectives|last=Clark|first=David|publisher=SAGE Publications|year=2007|isbn=9780761923879|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=1256}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ashgate Research Companion to Contemporary Religion and Sexuality|last=Hunt|first=Stephen|last2=Yip|first2=Andrew|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781409409496|location=Oxon|pages=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in the 1970s, a range of authors brought deconstructionist critical approaches to bear on issues of sexual identity, and especially on the construction of [[Heteronormativity]], i.e. the normalizing practices and institutions that [[Privilege (social inequality)|privilege]] heterosexuality as fundamental in [[society]] and in turn [[Sexual orientation discrimination|discriminates]] those outside this [[system of power|stem of power]],&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and focused to a large degree on non-heteronormative sexualities and sexual practices. In "The Politics of Inside/Out" Fuss asserts that the concept of “coming out” and being visible has been normalized while simultaneously contributing to the disappearance of queerness. By declaring oneself to be visible and “out” declares the ones who are not invisible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Namaste|first=Ki|date=1994|title=The Politics of Inside/Out: Queer Theory, Poststructuralism, and a Sociological Approach to Sexuality|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=2&amp;sid=fff70ba9-67d4-4981-8ccf-7dbf8e0fdb3a%40pdc-v-sessmgr06|journal=Sociological Theory|volume=12|pages=220|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory was also influenced by the political agency, particularly the Anglo-American cultures in the HIV/AIDS activism of the 1980s and contemporary feminism in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Queer Theory's overarching goal is to be sought out as a lens or tool to deconstruct the existing monolithic [[Ideal (ethics)|ideals]] of [[social norms]] and [[Folk taxonomy|taxonomies]]; as well as, how these [[Norm (social)|norms]] came into being and why.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sexual Deviance and Society: A sociological examination|last=Worthen|first=Meredith|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781138819061|location=Oxon|pages=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; The view is that these notions and norms are rigid organizing categories that do not sufficiently explain different attitudes, behaviors, or conditions of individual experiences. In addition, it analyzes the correlation between power distribution and identification while understanding the [[Wiktionary:multifarious|multifarious]] facets of [[oppression]] and privilege. [[Feminist theory|Feminist]] and Queer Theory are seen as applicable concepts that provide a framework to explore these issues rather than as an identity to those in the [[community]]. Queer is an [[umbrella term]] for those not only deemed sexually deviant, but also used to describe those who feel [[Social exclusion|marginalized]] as a result of standard [[social practices]]. It is a “site of permanent becoming” (Giffney, 2004).&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi= 10.1177/1464700104040814|title= Denormatizing Queer Theory: More Than (Simply) Lesbian and Gay Studies|journal= Feminist Theory|volume= 5|pages= 73–78|year= 2004|last1= Giffney|first1= Noreen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''queer theory'' was introduced in 1990, with [[Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick]], Judith Butler, [[Adrienne Rich]] and Diana Fuss (all largely following the work of [[Michel Foucault]]) being among its foundational proponents.

[[Annamarie Jagose]] wrote ''Queer Theory: An Introduction'' in 1996.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jagose|first1=Annamarie|title=Queer theory an introduction|date=1996|publisher=New York Univ. Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0814742341|edition=Reprint.|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/queer-theory-an-introduction/oclc/35651102&amp;referer=brief_results}}&lt;/ref&gt; Queer used to be a [[slang]] word for homosexuals and was used for [[homophobic abuse]]. Recently, this term has been used as an umbrella term for a coalition of sexual identities that are culturally marginalized, and at other times, to create discourse surrounding the budding [[theoretical model]] that primarily arose through more traditional lesbian and gay studies. According to Jagose (1996), "Queer focuses on mismatches between sex, gender and desire. For most, queer has been prominently associated with those who identify as lesbian and gay. Unknown to many, queer is in association with more than just gay and lesbian, but also cross-dressing, [[hermaphroditism]], gender ambiguity and gender-corrective surgery."

In addition, it is important to understand that Queer Theory is not predominantly about analyzing the binary of the homosexual and heterosexual. There is an abundance of identities in which Queer Theory not only recognizes but also breaks down in relation to other contributing factors like [[race (human categorization)|race]], [[Social class|class]], [[religion]], etc.

"Queer is a product of specific [[cultural]] and theoretical pressures which increasingly structured debates (both within and outside the academy) about questions of lesbian and gay identity,"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; but now, with the evolution of language, it is important to understand that the terms ‘gay’ and ‘lesbian’ are static, [[Eurocentric]] labels that fail to be universal when looking at a transnational scale. It is merely reductive to view Queer Theory as a byname for Gay and Lesbian studies when the two fields have stark differences.{{quote box|align=center|width=50%|quote=Queer is by definition whatever is at odds with the normal, the legitimate, the dominant. There is nothing in particular to 
which it necessarily refers. It is an identity without an essence. 'Queer' then, demarcates not a positivity but
a positionality vis-à-vis the normative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The future of queer theory is rooted in the aspiration of the term being utilized to reference and question all deviations from normative, as well as serve as a foundation of interrogation of the normative. The desires that queer theory is centered in do not reference sexuality, however because the foundation of queer theory lies in the assessment and analysis of what is deemed normative and non-normative, sexuality intersects with the components that maintain the fundamentals of queer theory.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Queer theorist [[Michael Warner]] attempts to provide a solid definition of a concept that typically circumvents categorical definitions: "Social reflection carried out in such a manner tends to be creative, fragmentary, and defensive, and leaves us perpetually at a disadvantage. And it is easy to be misled by the [[utopian]] claims advanced in support of particular tactics. But the range and seriousness of the problems that are continually raised by queer practice indicate how much work remains to be done. Because the logic of the sexual order is so deeply embedded by now in an indescribably wide range of social institutions, and is embedded in the most standard accounts of the world, queer struggles aim not just at toleration or equal status but at challenging those institutions and accounts. Similarly, queer theorist [[Cathy J. Cohen|Cathy Cohen]] highlights the limitations of a queer politics that attempts integration into “dominant institutions and normative social relationships” in order to centralize [[LGBTQ]] identity, and rather that it is necessary to affect the [[societal values]] and legislations that result in these oppressive institutions and relationships of power.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The dawning realization that themes of [[homophobia]] and [[heterosexism]] may be read in almost any document of our culture means that we are only beginning to have an idea of how widespread those institutions and accounts are".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ed|first1=Michael Warner|title=Fear of a queer planet queer politics and social theory|date=1997|publisher=Univ. of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis|isbn=978-0816623341|edition=3. pr.|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/fear-of-a-queer-planet-queer-politics-and-social-theory/oclc/28634756&amp;referer=brief_results}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Queer theory explores and contests the categorization of gender and [[sexuality]]. If identities are not fixed, they cannot be categorized and labeled, because identities consist of many varied components, so categorization by one characteristic is incomplete, and there is an interval between what a subject "does" ([[Role-taking theory|role-taking]]) and what a subject "is" (the [[self]]). This opposition destabilizes identity categories, which are designed to identify the "sexed subject" and place individuals within a single restrictive [[sexual orientation]].

==History==
"Queer" marks both a continuity and a break with the notion of gayness emerging from [[gay liberationist]] and [[lesbian feminist]] models, such as [[Adrienne Rich]]'s ''[[Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence]]''. "Gay" vs. "queer" fueled debates (both within and outside of academia) about LGBT identity. The independence of "queer" from "gay" came from the alignment of gay ideals with assimilationism and conservatism, while queer coincided with a radical approach. Assimilationists saw being nothing wrong with society; queer radicalism aspires to achieve nothing in reference to the status quo because societal acceptance is not essential because society is unacceptable.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kemp|first1=Jonathan|title=Queer Past, Queer Present, Queer Future|journal=Graduate Journal of Social Science|date=2009|volume=6|issue=1|url=http://gjss.org/sites/default/files/issues/chapters/papers/Journal-06-01--01-Kemp.pdf|accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Matos|first1=Angel Daniel|title=Gay Assimilationists versus Radical Queers: The Death of Queerness?|url=http://angelmatos.net/2013/04/06/gay-assimilationists-versus-radical-queers-the-death-of-queerness/|website=The Ever and Ever That Fiction Allows|accessdate=4 June 2015|date=2013-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been a long history of [[Critical thinking|critical]] and [[anarchistic]] thinking about sexual and gender relations across many cultures. [[Josiah Flynt]] became one of the first [[sociologists]] to study homosexuality. Most recently, in the late 1970s and 1980s, [[social constructionists]] conceived of the sexual subject as a culturally dependent, historically specific product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rubin|first1=Gayle S.|title=Deviations : a Gayle Rubin reader|date=2011|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham, NC|isbn=978-0-8223-4971-6|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/deviations-a-gayle-rubin-reader/oclc/777134989&amp;referer=brief_results}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the phrase "queer theory" was born, the term "Queer Nation" appeared on the cover of the short-lived lesbian/gay quarterly [[Outlook (magazine)|''Outlook'']] in the winter 1991 issues. Writers Allan Berube and Jeffrey Escoffier drove home the point that Queer Nation strove to embrace paradoxes in its [[political activism]], and that the activism was taking new form and revolving around the issue of identity.&lt;ref name="A genealogy of queer theory"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Turner|first1=William B.|title=A genealogy of queer theory|date=2000|publisher=Temple Univ. Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-1-56639-787-2|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/genealogy-of-queer-theory/oclc/43562107&amp;referer=brief_results}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon enough ''Outlook'' and ''Queer Nation'' stopped being published, however, there was a mini-gay renaissance going on during the 1980s and early 1990s. There were a number of significant outbursts of lesbian/gay political/[[LGBT culture|cultural]] activity. Out of this emerged queer theory. Their work however did not arise out of the blue. [[Teresa de Lauretis]] is credited with coining the phrase "queer theory". It was at a working conference on lesbian and gay sexualities that was held at the [[University of California]], [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]] in February 1990 that de Lauretis first made mention of the phrase.&lt;ref&gt;David Halperin. "The Normalization of Queer Theory." ''Journal of Homosexuality'', v.45, pp. 339–343&lt;/ref&gt; She later introduced the phrase in a 1991 special issue of [[Differences: A Journal of Feminist Cultural Studies|''difference''s'': A Journal of Feminist Cultural Studies'']], entitled "Queer Theory: Lesbian and Gay Sexualities." Similar to the description Berube and Escoffier used for Queer Nation, de Lauretis asserted that, "queer unsettles and questions the genderedness of sexuality."&lt;ref name=education&gt;{{Citation|last=Pinar|first=William F.|title=Queer Theory in Education|year=1998|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.|location=Mahwah|pages=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barely three years later, she abandoned the phrase « on the grounds that it had been taken over by those mainstream forces and institutions it was coined to resist ».&lt;ref&gt;Jagose, A 1996, "Queer Theory".&lt;/ref&gt; Judith Butler's ''[[Gender Trouble]]'', [[Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick]]'s ''[[Epistemology of the Closet]]'', and [[David Halperin]]'s ''[[One Hundred Years of Homosexuality]]'' inspired other works. Teresa de Lauretis, Judith Butler, and Eve Sedgwick arranged much of the conceptual base for the emerging field in the 1990s. Along with other queer theorists, these three outlined a political [[hermeneutics]], which emphasized representation. These scholars questioned whether people of varying sexual orientations had the same political goals, and whether those in the [[sexual minority]] felt that they could be represented along with others of different sexualities and orientations. "While some critics insist that queer theory is apolitical word-smithery, de Lauretis, Butler, and Sedgwick take seriously the role that signs and symbols play in shaping the meanings and possibilities of our culture at the most basic level, including politics conventionally defined."&lt;ref name="A genealogy of queer theory"/&gt;

Queer theory has increasingly been applied not just to contemporary sexualities and identities but also to practices and identities in earlier time periods. Examination of [[LGBT history#The Renaissance|Renaissance]] culture and [[Renaissance literature|literature]], for example, has generated significant scholarship in the past 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Traub|first1=Valerie|title=The New Unhistoricism in Queer Studies|journal=PMLA|date=2013|volume=128|issue=1|doi=10.1632/pmla.2013.128.1.21|pages=21–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background concepts==

Queer theory is grounded in gender and sexuality. Due to this association, a debate emerges as to whether sexual orientation is [[Nature (philosophy)|natural]] or [[Essence|essential]] to the person, as an [[Gender essentialism|essentialist]] believes, or if sexuality is a social construction and subject to change.&lt;ref&gt;Barry, P 2002, ''Lesbian/gay criticism'', in P Barry (eds), Beginning theory: an introduction to literary and cultural theory, Manchester University Press, Manchester, pp139-155.&lt;/ref&gt;

The essentialist feminists believed that genders "have an essential nature (e.g. nurturing and caring versus being aggressive and selfish), as opposed to differing by a variety of accidental or contingent features brought about by social forces".&lt;ref name="blackburn1996"&gt;Blackburn, S 1996, "essentialism", Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy, (Oxford Reference Online).&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this belief in the essential nature of a person, it is also natural to assume that a person's sexual preference would be natural and essential to a person's [[personality]].

Social constructivism is a concept that proposes the realities we produce and the meanings we create are a result of social [[interaction]]; communicating and existing in a cultural context that conveys meaning to us. Our world is a product of continuous “claims making, labelling and other constitutive definitional processes”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Biever | first1 = Joan L. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 1998 | title = The Social Construction Of Gender: A Comparison Of Feminist And Postmodern Approaches | url = | journal = Counselling Psychology Quarterly | volume = 11 | issue = 2| page = 163 | doi=10.1080/09515079808254052}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, queer theorists have offered the argument that there is no essential self at all, and that people exist not just as subjects but also as objects of the social world. In this way, an identity is not born but rather constructed through repeated [[Performativity|performative actions]] that are in turn informed by existing social constructions of gender. By thus analyzing and understanding the ways in which gender is shared and historically constituted, the production of gender can occur differently and beyond a socially constructed binary upon which heterosexuality depends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Butler | first1 = J | year = 1988 | title = Performative acts and gender constitution: An essay in phenomenology and feminist theory | url = | journal = Theatre Journal | volume = 40 | issue = 4| pages = 519–531 | doi=10.2307/3207893| jstor = 3207893 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identity politics==
{{Main|Identity politics#LGBT issues}}
Queer theory was originally associated with [[Political radicalism|radical]] gay politics of [[Act up|ACT UP]], [[OutRage!]] and other groups which embraced "queer" as an identity label that pointed to a [[Separatism|separatist]], [[cultural assimilation|non-assimilationist]] politics.&lt;ref name="blackburn1996"/&gt; Queer theory developed out of an examination of perceived limitations in the traditional [[identity politics]] of recognition and [[self-identity]]. In particular, queer theorists identified processes of consolidation or stabilization around some other identity labels (e.g. gay and lesbian); and construed queerness so as to resist this. Queer theory attempts to maintain a critique more than define a specific identity. These critiques are expressed through a whole range of notions in subfields such as [[ecotechnics]] within technology studies.

Acknowledging the inevitable [[Political violence|violence]] of identity politics, and having no stake in its own [[ideology]], queer is less an identity than a critique of identity. However, it is in no position to imagine itself outside the circuit of problems energized by identity politics.  Instead of defending itself against those criticisms that its operations attract, queer allows those criticisms to shape its – for now unimaginable – future directions. "The term," writes Butler, "will be revised, dispelled, rendered obsolete to the extent that it yields to the demands which resist the term precisely because of the exclusions by which it is mobilized." The mobilization of queer foregrounds the conditions of political representation, its intentions and effects, its resistance to and recovery by the existing networks of power.&lt;ref&gt;Brooker, P, ''A Concise Glossary of Cultural Theory'', 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

The studies of Fuss anticipate queer theory. Fuss analyzes queer theory while surpassing the concept of identity politics to assert the nature in how to distinguish people who were not heterosexual from people who are without asserting the positionally of the two from the lens of a binary.&lt;ref&gt;Fuss, D. 1991. "Inside/Out." Pp. 1–10 in Inside/Out. Lesbian Theories, Gay Theories, edited by D. Fuss. New York and London: Rougledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eng, Halberstam and Esteban Munoz offer one of its latest incarnations in the aptly titled "What is Queer about Queer studies now?".&lt;ref&gt;Eng, D. L., J. Halberstam, and J. E. Munoz. 2005. "Introduction: What’s Queer about Queer Studies Now?" Social Text 84–85:1–17.&lt;/ref&gt; Using Judith Butler's critique of sexual identity categories as a starting point, they work around a "queer epistemology" that explicitly opposes the sexual categories of Lesbian and Gay studies and lesbian and gay identity politics. They insist that the field of normalization is not limited to sexuality; social classifications such as gender, race and nationality constituted by a "governing logic" require an epistemological intervention through queer theory." &lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Green|first=Adam Isaiah|date=2007-03|title=Queer Theory and Sociology: Locating the Subject and the Self in Sexuality Studies|journal=Sociological Theory|language=en|volume=25|issue=1|pages=26–45|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9558.2007.00296.x|issn=0735-2751}}&lt;/ref&gt; "So, the evolution of the queer begins with the problematization of sexual identity categories in Fuss (1996) and extends outward to a more general deconstruction of social [[ontology]] in contemporary queer theory." &lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

"Edelman goes from deconstruction of the subject to a deconstructive psychoanalysis of the entire social order; the modern human fear of mortality produces defensive attempts to "suture over the hole in the Symbolic Order."&lt;ref&gt;Edelman, L. 2004. No Future. Durham and London: Duke University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, constructions of "the homosexual" are pitted against constructions of "The Child" in the modern West, wherein the former symbolizes the inevitability of mortality (do not procreate) and the latter an illusory continuity of the self with the social order (survives mortality through one's offspring). The constructs are animated by futuristic fantasy designed to evade mortality." &lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

"Fuss, Eng. et al and Edelman represent a distinct moment in the development of queer theory. Whereas Fuss aims to discompose and render inert the reigning classifications of sexual identity, Eng. et al observe the extension of a deconstructive strategy to a wider field of normalization, while Edelman’s work takes not only the specter of "the homosexual", but the very notion of "society" as a manifestation of psychological distress requiring composition."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==Intersex and the role of biology==

Queer theorists focus on problems in classifying individuals as either [[male]] or [[female]], even on a strictly biological basis. For example, the sex [[chromosome]]s ([[X chromosome|X]] and [[Y chromosome|Y]]) may exist in atypical combinations (as in [[Klinefelter syndrome]] [XXY]). This complicates the use of [[genotype]] as a means to define exactly two distinct sexes. [[Intersex]] individuals may for various biological reasons have [[Primary sexual characteristics|sexual characteristics]] that the dominant medical discourse regards as [[disorders of sex development|disordered]].

Scientists who have written on the conceptual significance of intersex individuals include [[Anne Fausto-Sterling]], [[Katrina Karkazis]], [[Rebecca Jordan-Young]], and [[Joan Roughgarden]]. While the [[Disorders of sex development|medical literature]] focuses increasingly on genetics of intersex traits, and even their [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis#Ethical issues|deselection]], some scholars on the study of culture, such as [[Barbara Rogoff]], argue that the traditional distinction between biology and culture as independent entities is overly simplistic, pointing to the ways in which biology and culture interact with one another.&lt;ref&gt;Rogoff, Barbara. ''The Cultural Nature of Human Development''. New York: Oxford UP, USA, 2003: 63–64. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Intersex scholars and scientists who have written on intersex include [[Morgan Holmes]], [[Georgiann Davis]], [[Iain Morland]] and [[Janik Bastien-Charlebois]], in each case focusing on more particular realities of the intersex experience. In his essay ''What Can Queer Theory Do for Intersex?'' Morland contrasts queer "hedonic activism" with an experience of post-surgical insensate intersex bodies to claim that "queerness is characterized by the sensory interrelation of pleasure and shame".&lt;ref name="after"&gt;{{Cite book |editor1-last=Morland |editor1-first=Iain |date=2009 |title=Intersex and After |url=https://www.dukeupress.edu/Intersex-and-After/ |journal=[[GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies]] |publisher= |volume=15 |issue=2 |isbn=978-0-8223-6705-5 |pages= |doi= |accessdate=2014-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disability Theory and queer theory ==
In Robert McRuer's ''Crip Theory,'' he mentions the intersection between disability theory and queer theory and how they are aided by their own association with each other and what is normal; for instance, the connection between upholding an able-bodied identity and heterosexuality. He argues that an able-bodied identity functions as more of a subconscious mentality of normality than heterosexuality. McRuer argues that there is a system that is established to distinguish those who are able-bodied from those who have disabilities; that distinction that was instituted the disability concept. Following that same dynamic, the subjection of homosexuality in relation to heterosexuality founded the basis of homosexuality. McRuer emphasizes how the intersecting of queer theory and disability theory would cultivate, “critically disabled spaces overlapping with the critically queer spaces that activists and scholars have shaped during recent decades, in which we can identify and challenge the ongoing consolidation of heterosexual, able-bodied hegemony.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Crip Theory Cultural Signs of Queerness and Disability|last=McRuer|first=Robert|publisher=New York: New York University Press|year=2006|isbn=9780814759868|location=|pages=1–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of Crip Theory by McRuer was not only built on neoliberism but also critically engages with the fundamentality of the term “disability” and the manner that it paradoxically operates. McRuer asserts the nature of which that queer theory and disability theory benefit each other. The functions of the concept of able-bodiedness is utilized as an additional tool to strengthen and maintain the concept of heterosexuality and heteronormativy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kafer|first=Alison|date=2009|title=What's Crip About Queer Theory Now?|url=|journal=Sex Roles|volume=|pages=291–294|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==HIV/AIDS and queer theory==

Much of queer theory developed out of a response to the [[AIDS]] crisis, which promoted a renewal of radical activism, and the growing homophobia brought about by public responses to AIDS. Queer theory became occupied in part with what effects – put into circulation around the AIDS epidemic – necessitated and nurtured new forms of political organization, education and theorizing in "queer".

To examine the effects that HIV/AIDS has on queer theory is to look at the ways in which the status of the subject or individual is treated in the biomedical discourses that construct them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donna Haraway]], ''The Biopolitics of Postmodern Bodies'', 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

# The shift, affected by safer [[sex education]] in emphasizing [[sexual practices]] over sexual identities&lt;ref&gt;Michael Bartos, ''Meaning of Sex Between Men'', 1993 and G.W. Dowsett, ''Men Who Have Sex With Men'', 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The persistent misrecognition of HIV/AIDS as a gay disease&lt;ref&gt;Richard Meyer, ''Rock Hudson's Body'', 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Homosexuality as a kind of fatality&lt;ref&gt;Ellis Hanson, ''Unread'', 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The coalition politics of much HIV/AIDS activism that rethinks identity in terms of affinity rather than essence&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Saalfield, ''Shocking Pink Praxis'', 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore includes not only lesbians and gay men but also bisexuals, [[transsexuals]], [[sex workers]], [[people with AIDS]], [[health workers]], and parents and friends of gays; the pressing recognition that discourse is not a separate or second-order reality&lt;ref&gt;Jagose, A 1996, Queer Theory, [http://www.australianhumanitiesreview.org/archive/Issue-Dec-1996/jagose.html].&lt;/ref&gt;
# The constant emphasis on contestation in resisting [[Misconceptions about HIV/AIDS|dominant depictions]] of [[HIV]] and AIDS and representing them otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;Edelman, Lee 2013, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Tb5YAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA14#v=onepage&amp;q=%22totalizable%20identity%22&amp;f=false Homographesis: Essays in Gay Literary and Cultural Theory]'', Routledge, {{ISBN|978-1134567232}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The rethinking of traditional understandings of the workings of power in cross-hatched struggles over epidemiology, scientific research, public health and immigration policy&lt;ref&gt;David Halperin, ''Homosexuality: A Cultural Construct'', 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

The material effects of AIDS contested many [[cultural assumptions]] about identity, justice, desire and knowledge. One scholar claimed that AIDS challenged the health and immunity of Western [[epistemology]]: "the psychic presence of AIDS signifies a collapse of identity and difference that refuses to be abjected from the systems of self-knowledge." (p.&amp;nbsp;292)&lt;ref name="Yingling"&gt;Yingling, Thomas. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=0cbuW1iQVIwC&amp;pg=PA292#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20psychic%20presence%20of%20AIDS%22&amp;f=false AIDS in America: Postmodern Governance, Identity, and Experience]" in Diana Fuss, ed., ''Inside/Out: Lesbian Theories, Gay Theories''. Psychology Press, 1991. pp. 291-310. {{ISBN|978-0415902373}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus queer theory and AIDS become interconnected because each is articulated through a postmodernist understanding of the death of the subject and both understand identity as an ambivalent site.

==Role of language==
:''For language use as associated with sexual identity, see [[Lavender linguistics]].''

Richard Norton suggests that queer language evolved from structures and [[Labeling theory|labels]] imposed by a [[mainstream culture]].

Early discourse of queer theory involved leading theorists: Michel Foucault, Judith Butler, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick and others. This discourse centered on the way that knowledge of sexuality was structured through the use of language. Michel Foucault writes in "[[The History of Sexuality]]", critiquing the idea of the “repressive hypothesis” that supposes from the 17th to the mid-20th century, sex was a private matter limited within a marriage between a husband and wife, and discourses of sex have been otherwise prohibited and repressed. As a result of this repression, people sought outlets to release sexual feelings, building their own discourses of sex and thus liberating themselves from the confines of a sexually repressive society.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel. ''The History of Sexuality, volume I: La Volonté de savoir'', 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault argues that the “repressive hypothesis” is a limiting attempt to connect open discourses of sex to personal liberation. This sort of narrative which views discourses of sex as revolutionary [[Idea of progress|progress]] against a repressive system is dependent on the assumption that people of the past were [[sexually repressed]]; however, Foucault states that from the 17th to the mid-20th century the "'repressive hypothesis"' was an illusion, rather a suppression of western society's sexuality. In fact, discourse about sexuality flourished during this time period. Foucault argues,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Western man has been drawn for three centuries to the task of telling everything concerning his sex;that since the classical age there has been a constant optimization and increasing valorization of the discourse on sex; and that this carefully analytical discourse was meant to yield multiple effects of displacement,intensification, reorientation and modification of desire itself. Not only were the boundaries of what one could say about sex enlarged, and men compelled to hear it said; but more important, discourse was connected to sex by a complex organization with varying effects, by a deployment that cannot be adequately explained merely by referring it to a law of prohibition. A censorship of sex? There was installed rather an apparatus for producing an ever greater quantity of discourse about sex, capable of functioning and taking effect in its very economy." &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Foucault says at this time there was a political, economic and technical excitement to talk about sex. Sex became a call for management procedures. It became a policing matter.

[[Heteronormativity]] was the main focus of discourse, where heterosexuality was viewed as normal and any deviations, such as homosexuality, as abnormal or "queer". Even before the founding of "queer theory" the Modern Language Association (MLA) came together for a convention in 1973 for the first formal gay-studies seminar due to the rise of lesbian and gay writers and issues of gay and lesbian textuality. The convention was entitled "Gay Literature: Teaching and Research." In 1981, the MLA established the Division of Gay Studies in Language and Literature.

==Media and other creative works==

Many queer theorists have produced creative works that reflect theoretical perspectives in a wide variety of media. For example, [[LGBT themes in speculative fiction|science fiction]] authors such as [[Samuel R. Delany]] and [[Octavia Butler]] feature many values and themes from queer theory in their work. [[Patrick Califia]]'s published fiction also draws heavily on concepts and ideas from queer theory. Some [[lesbian feminist]] novels written in the years immediately following [[Stonewall riots|Stonewall]], such as ''[[Lover (novel)|Lover]]'' by [[Bertha Harris]] or ''[[Les Guérillères]]'' by [[Monique Wittig]], can be said to anticipate the terms of later queer theory. [[Núria Perpinyà|Nuria Perpinya]], a Catalan literary theorist, wrote ''A good mistake'', a novel about the awkward homosexuality in a London genetic engineering lab, between a young white man and a black scientist.&lt;ref&gt;Núria Perpinyà, [http://nuriaperpinya.com/?page_id=172&amp;lang=en ''A good mistake''] 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

In film, the genre christened by [[B. Ruby Rich]] as [[New Queer Cinema]] in 1992 continues, as [[Queer Cinema]], to draw heavily on the prevailing critical climate of queer theory; a good early example of this is the [[Jean Genet]]-inspired movie ''[[Poison (film)|Poison]]'' by the director [[Todd Haynes]]. In [[fan fiction]], the genre known as [[slash fiction]] rewrites straight or nonsexual relationships to be gay, bisexual, and queer in a sort of [[Camp (style)|campy]] cultural appropriation. [[Ann Herendeen]]'s ''Pride/Prejudice'',&lt;ref&gt;Pam Rosenthal, "[http://historyhoydens.blogspot.com/2010/09/another-take-on-pride-and-prejudice.html Another Take on Pride And Prejudice]", ''History Hoydens''&lt;/ref&gt; for example, narrates a steamy affair between [[Mr. Darcy]] and Mr. Bingley, the mutually devoted heroes of [[Jane Austen]]'s [[Pride and Prejudice|much-adapted novel]].  And in music, some [[Queercore]] groups and [[zines]] could be said to reflect the values of queer theory.&lt;ref&gt;Matias Viegener, "The only haircut that makes sense anymore," in ''Queer Looks: Lesbian &amp; Gay Experimental Media'' (Routledge, New York: 1993) &amp; "Kinky Escapades, Bedroom Techniques, Unbridled Passion, and Secret Sex Codes," in ''Camp Grounds: Gay &amp; Lesbian Style'' (U Mass, Boston: 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

Queer theorists analyze texts and challenge the cultural notions of "straight" ideology; that is, does "straight" imply heterosexuality as normal or is everyone potentially gay? As Ryan states: "It is only the laborious imprinting of heterosexual norms that cuts away those potentials and manufactures heterosexuality as the dominant sexual format."&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, M., 1999. ''Literary Theory: a practical introduction''. Oxford. Blackwell, p.117.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Hollywood pursues the "straight" theme as being the dominant theme to outline what masculine is. This is particularly noticeable in gangster films, action films and westerns, which never have "weak" (read: homosexual) men playing the heroes, with the recent exception of the film ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]''. Queer theory looks at destabilizing and shifting the boundaries of these cultural constructions.

[[New Media]] artists have a long history of queer theory inspired works, including [[cyberfeminism]] works, porn films like ''[[I.K.U.]]'' which feature transgender cyborg hunters and "Sharing is Sexy", an "open source porn laboratory", using social software, creative commons licensing and netporn to explore queer sexualities beyond the male/female binary.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

== Racism ==
{{See also|Racism in the LGBT community|LGBT culture#Racism|LGBT stereotypes#Intersections between LGBT, race, and class stereotypes}}
Within the [[LGBTQ community]], there lies a distinguishing marker between those who just identify as LGBTQ and those who identify with both an oppressed race alongside being LGBTQ. In "Punks, Bulldaggers, and Welfare Queens", Cathy Cohen critiques modern day queer politics, arguing that lack of recognition of LGBTQ people who face other forms of oppression results in many queers not being supported or acknowledged by Queer politics. Cohen states: "how do queer activists understand and relate politically to those whose same-sex sexual identities position them within the category of queer, but who hold other identities based on class, race and/or gender categories".&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Cathy|date=|title=Punks, Bulldaggers, and Welfare Queens: The Radical Potential of Queer Politics|url=|journal=GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This pinpoints the idea she is attempting to make in that the politics of Queer do not encompass all of the [[Queer community]] but only those with the most privilege within the group: primarily [[upper class]], [[White privilege|white]] [[cisgender]] [[Male privilege|men]]. Since this is the case, how then, can a [[Person of Color]] who is also LGBTQ-identifying feel welcomed, supported, and represented if they are being cast aside? Cohen attempts to explain this by stating: "'Unlike the early lesbian and gay movement, which had both ideological and practical links to the left, black activism and feminism, today's 'queer' politicos seem to operate in a historical and ideological vacuum. 'Queer' activists focus on 'queer' issues, and racism, sexual oppression and economic exploitation do not qualify, despite the fact that the majority of 'queers' are people of color, female or working class..."&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt; This lack of recognition is leaving a hefty portion of the LGBTQ community unsupported in all of their endeavors, and it primarily gives aid to those who are LGBTQ and identify as [[white people|white]].

The concept was created out of the mentality that queerness equals deviance. It strives to display the error in assuming that everyone experiences one sole monolithic existence, which establishes the gay white male experience to be central to all other experiences, and that all other experiences derives from the gay white male experience. By institutions establishing and reinforcing the concept that there is a uniform experience that all people from one race endure, it maintains an environment centered on white discourse within the queer community that establishes a “false intimacy.” That false intimacy fails to provide queer youth of color with the support that is necessary to recognize and analyze the intersectionality of their being.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fox|first=Catherine O.|last2=Ore|first2=Tracy E.|date=2010|title=(Un) Covering Normalized Gender and Race Subjectivities in LGBT "Safe Spaces"|journal=Feminist Studies|volume=36|issue=3|pages=629–649|jstor=27919125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a response to this oppression, many scholars and queer theorists use [[queer of color critique]] as a practice in both their academic work and personal activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = El-Tayeb | first1 = F | year = 2012 | title = 'Gays Who Cannot Properly Be Gay': Queer Muslims in the Neoliberal European City | url = | journal = European Journal of Women's Studies | volume = 19 | issue = 1| pages = 79–95 | doi=10.1177/1350506811426388}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muñoz, José Esteban.

=== Racialization of the body ===
[[Racism]] has long been embedded within queer theory since the creation of the homosexual body and identity. Siobhan Sommerville's "Scientific Racism and the Invention of the Homosexual Body"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sommerville|first=Siobhan|date=|title=Scientific Racism and the Invention of the Homosexual Body|url=|journal=Journal of the History of Sexuality|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; discusses the invention of homosexuality among the [[scientific community]] as coming at about the same time as the reformulation of [[racial theories]]. According to Sommerville, when there were aggressive attempts to separate and [[Color terminology for race|classify bodies as black or white]], there was also the classification of bodies as heterosexual or homosexual.

Havelock Ellis, an English physician, writer, [[Progressivism|progressive]] intellectual and [[social reformer]], suggested that homosexuality is not a crime, but a [[Wiktionary:congenital|congenital]] [[Human physiology|physiological]] abnormality; he believed that the "invert" was visually distinguishable from the "normal" [[Human body|body]] through [[anatomical]] markers (like the difference between [[male]] and [[female]] bodies).

This was the same as the ideas about the difference between [[racialized]] bodies. There was the idea that [[Black women|black]] and white women's bodies held major differences. Black women were often referred to as the "Bushman race": having strongly muscled [[Posterior (anatomy)|posteriors]], highly [[Afro-textured hair|textured hair]] and other [[Human physical appearance|physical characteristics]] that were considered outside the boundaries of 'normal' female bodies (based on white [[Feminine beauty ideal|beauty standards]]). W.H. Flower and James Murie constructed a site of racial difference by marking the sexual and [[Female reproductive system|reproductive]] anatomy of the African woman as "peculiar." The characteristics of [[African American]] women were consistent with the medical characterizations of lesbians; such as having an "unusually large [[clitoris]]." These supposed distinguishing characteristics further separated not only heterosexual people from queer people, but also white from black, and white homosexual bodies from queer people of color.

=== Racialization of space ===
Racism also exists within [[queer spaces]]. In "Out There: The Topography of Race and Desire in the Global City"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Manalansan|first=Martin|date=|title=Out There: The Topography of Race and Desire in the Global City|url=|journal=Global Divas|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin Manalansan focuses on the [[gay community in New York City]], most specifically in [[LGBT culture in New York City#Manhattan|Manhattan]]. According to Manalansan, New York City is known to be a [[gay Mecca]]. However, this portrayal, in focusing on Manhattan, centers white, [[Middle class|middle]]/upper class men. The gay community in New York is known to be held exclusively in Manhattan, as this is the area that most people who are not from New York City know. People who are outside of the heart of Manhattan and the gay community there are, literally, "out there". Those who are of different races, gender, or class occupy different spaces and communities which seldom overlap.

Manalansan gives a detailed description of the [[topography]] of New York City in order to show the actual physical and [[Cultural divide|cultural barriers]] that exists between the different boroughs and the gay communities that exist there. Outside of Manhattan, the gay communities are divided by cultural and racial barriers; the [[Hispanics and Latinos in New York|Latin]], [[Asian Americans in New York City|Asian]], and [[African Americans in New York City|Black]] gay communities do not overlap and are also physically distanced from each other. Space is inherently racialized. The racialized gay communities and spaces in New York City only further alienate queer people of color and make them less valued and validated in gay culture.

Carly Thompsen's article "In Plain(s) Sight: Rural LGBTQ Women and the Politics of Visibility" also sheds light on racial issues within visibility politics. In this piece, Thomsen analyzes the estrangement between strategies and discourses of national [[lesbian and gay rights organizations]] and the strategies and discourses of LGBTQ women in the rural [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]. She argues that it is crucial for rural queer studies to critique contemporary visibility politics. Due to the overemphasis of an essentially [[urban ethos]], rural LBGTQ politics are usually overshadowed and ignored. This undermining of rural identities in LGBTQ politics is problematic for rural LGBTQ progress. She concludes that rural queer studies must be weary of right-seeking approaches to visibility politics because they indirectly allow the abjection of the rural. From this, Thompsen reflects on how LBGTQ visibility politics as a whole aid to the existence of, and even strengthen [[Queer Metronormativity|metronormativity]] by showing the dominance of [[Urban area|urban]] communities over [[Rural area|rural]] communities in gaining prominence in [[LGBTQ movements]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thompsen|first1=Carly|title=In Plain(s) Sight: Rural LGBTQ Women and the Politics of Visibility|journal=Queering the Countryside: New Frontiers in Rural Queer Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as Thomsen argues against metronormative ideals of the [[global city]] as always the most progressive, comfortable and [[Social inclusion|inclusive]] space for queer people. Emily Skidmore pushes back on metronormative assumption in her article "Ralph Kerwineo's Queer Body: Narrating the Scales of Social Membership in the Early 20th Century". Her work outlines the life of Ralph Kerwineo, a person born as a black woman, who moves from [[Chicago]] to early 20th century [[Milwaukee]] and passed as a [[Hispanic]] man in the then small town experiencing large influxes of [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants]]. Skidmore analyzed newspaper stories of Kerwineo when his ex-girlfriend publicly accused him of being a woman. &amp;nbsp;She found that articles from local papers in Milwaukee were more accepting of Kerwineo's [[gender identity]] regardless of his racial identity (throughout the media outburst he variably identified as [[European Americans|white]], Latin, black and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]) whereas national papers immediately jumped to accusations of Kerwineo's [[perversion]] and guilt. While Milwaukee papers empathized with him, emphasizing that he was always an upstanding member of society, and creating stories of women of color just trying to survive in a difficult situation, national news sources [[Wiktionary:pathologize|pathologized]] Kerwineo, linking racial, sexual, and gender [[Deviance (sociology)|deviance]] to paint a picture of incontestable guilt. &amp;nbsp;Skidmore uses this example to show that queer people have found acceptance and community in places other than global cities, showing that the specific [[Social dynamics|social]] and racial dynamics of Milwaukee at that time provided a safer environment for Kerwineo. Thus, despite metronormative assumptions of national, or larger urban, spaces as queer utopias, their discourses around queer bodies can in fact be more [[Toleration|intolerant]] of people with non-normative gender, sexual, and racial identities than other places.

=== Racialization outside the United States ===
[[LGBT history in Israel|Israel]], in attempts to brand itself as a gay mecca, has been accused of [[Pinkwashing (LGBT)|pinkwashing]]. This is the main idea of the article: "Israel's Gay Propaganda War", written by [[Jasbir Puar]], in which she highlights the [[Criticism of the Israeli government|hypocrisy of the Israeli state]] in branding itself as a gay mecca, attempting to show how progressive the state is despite its [[dehumanizing]] acts against the [[Palestinian people]]. In the midst of the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], Israel has been accused of many violations of [[Human rights in Israel|human rights]] against the Palestinian people, and has received an international reputation for being an [[Imperialism|imperial]] aggressor. Their response to this was to proclaim to the [[international community]] that they are more developed and essentially say: "Israel is civilised, Palestinians are barbaric, homophobic, uncivilised, suicide-bombing fanatics. It produces Israel as the only gay-friendly country in an otherwise hostile region."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jul/01/israels-gay-propaganda-war|title=Israel's gay propaganda war|date=2010-07-01|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-04-14|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; What this entails is Israel is essentially oppressing Palestinians further through their use of [[gay-friendly]] propaganda, which also hides its own problems as state dealing with homophobia as well. What Puar tries to argue is that Israel uses this branding as a method to further justify their treatment of the Palestinian people, and she argues further that the image being portrayed towards Palestinians de-legitimizes those who identify as Queer who are Palestinian since Israel does not support the [[LGBTQ groups in Palestine]], nor does it acknowledge their existence.

In "Queer Injuries: The Racial Politics of 'Homophobic Hate Crime' in Germany", Jin Haritaworn calls attention to the tradeoffs between the passing of Anti-[[Hate Crime]] legislation. In this piece, Haritaworn examines the problems with [[hate crime legislation in Germany]] and how racist views are still manifested in anti-hate crime laws and have racial ramifications. The move of LGBTQ activism into the judicial sphere enables police and military systems to reinvent themselves as the protector of [[Minority group|minorities]] while police activity [[Institutional racism|targeting racialized populations]] is reaching new heights. Additionally, these newly publicized and politicized subjectivities and embodiments still adhere to a specific [[neoliberal ideology]] and fantasy. Incorporating [[criminal justice]] analysis into sexual justice narratives, Haritaworn finds that internationally, LGBTQ anti-hate legislation still marginalizes and represses other minorities by forcing victim-perpetrator narratives that target certain groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haritaworn|first1=Jin|title=Queer Injuries: The Racial Politics of 'Homophobic Hate Crime' in Germany|journal=Social Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emmanuel David researches transgender people—primarily trans women—in call centers in the Philippines. In these spaces, David finds that international corporations are integrating trans women into the workforce in a way that both requires them to perform gender labor and David partake in the neoliberal capitalist system as members of the periphery. In his article "Purple-Collar Labor: Transgender Workers and Queer Value at Global Call Centers in the Philippines", David outlines how transgender filipina call center workers are expected to keep morale up by performing in fashion shows, staying happy and joking around with their team members, all for the sake of worker productivity. He shows that trans women that do not uphold these standards or who are not extroverted in their work interactions are not as accepted in their gender identity as the trans women workers who are openly flamboyant and funny. This research highlights a portion of the queer community outside of the core, upper class, white, male, US urban population and pushes back on assumptions of 'Out There' being a space of intolerance, danger and conformity, but also highlights how queer bodies can be integrated into the global capitalist system and normalized in a place many readers might not expect.

== Feminism ==
{{Main|Feminist views on sexuality#Feminism and queer theory}}Queer and feminist theories, like other perspectives based on socially-based identities and gender, tend to overlap. Both of these theories are described as responses to the "essentializing" of gender and sexual identities, which lead to the oppression of those who do not conform to socially constructed gender norms.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender and Sexual Identity: Transcending Feminist and Queer Theory|last=Nagoshi|first=Julie|last2=Nagoshi|first2=Craig|last3=Brzuzy|first3=Stephanie|publisher=Springer|year=2013|isbn=9781461489658|location=New York|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This highlights their similarity in the view that gender-related identity is [[Social constructionism|socially constructed]]. There is thus an agreement that the [[oppression]] of women and sexual minority groups can be challenged by way of a self-constructive process that rejects the perceived inferiority of this group within the social order.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; While queer and feminist theories share several commonalities, this does not mean that they are easily commensurable, with some thinkers citing that they could even be an awkward pair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminism Meets Queer Theory|last=Weed|first=Elizabeth|last2=Schor|first2=Naomi|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1997|isbn=978-0253332783|location=Bloomington, IN|pages=viii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One overlap of queer theory and feminist theory is through the recognition and influence of Judith Butler and Butler's cultivation of the relationship of gender and sexuality that has come to found the basis of queer theory concerns.  The analysis of society in relation to sexuality and gender, is a display of dominance that shows the way that biology is influenced by culture and society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watson|first=Katherine|date=2005-03-01|title=Queer Theory|journal=Group Analysis|language=en|volume=38|issue=1|pages=67–81|doi=10.1177/0533316405049369|issn=0533-3164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A key difference between the queer and feminist theories involves their respective scope. Feminist theory is only concerned about the issues affecting women and [[Women's empowerment|women empowerment]] while the subjects of queer theory are diverse and include women, homosexuals, transsexuals, and those considered deviants. Queer theory is also distinguished from feminist theory in the sense that it asserts identity as a conceptual category, serving as "a disciplinary apparatus that that pigeonholes the fluidity of the self into a politically docile normativity."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Politics of Everybody: Feminism, Queer Theory, and Marxism at the Intersection|last=Lewis|first=Holly|publisher=Zed Books, Ltd.|year=2016|isbn=9781783602889|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feminist position is that '[[identity politics]]' is a political error that occurs once a standpoint gets overemphasized or naturalized.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Criticism==
{{Essay|date=September 2018}}

Typically, critics of queer theory are concerned that the approach obscures or glosses altogether the material conditions that underpin discourse.&lt;ref name = "Edwards"&gt;{{Citation | last= Edwards | first= Tim | title= Queer Fears: Against the Cultural Turn | journal= Sexualities |volume= 1 | year= 1998 | postscript= &lt;!--none--&gt; | doi= 10.1177/136346098001004005 | issue= 4 | pages= 471–484}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tim Edwards argues that queer theory extrapolates too broadly from textual analysis in undertaking an examination of the social.&lt;ref name = "Edwards"/&gt;

Adam Green's critique is one approach to queer theory, that leans towards a sociological stance on the issue of sexuality; primarily and rather exc&lt;ref name="Green1"&gt;{{Citation | doi= 10.1023/A:1020976902569 | last= Green | first= Adam | title= Gay But Not Queer: Toward a Post-Queer Study of Sexuality | journal= Theory and Society | volume= 31 | issue= 4 | pages= 521–545 | year= 2002 | postscript= &lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; lusively, focusing on gay or lesbian subjects. Green argues that queer theory ignores the social and institutional conditions within which lesbians and gays live. For example, queer theory dismantles social contingency in some cases (homosexual subject positions) while recuperating social contingency in others (racialized subject positions). Thus, not all queer theoretical work is as faithful to its deconstructionist roots. Reflecting on this issue, Timothy Laurie suggests that "the desire to resist norms in some contemporary queer scholarship can never be entirely reconciled with an equally important challenge, that of producing both adequate and dynamic descriptions of ordinary events".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= The Ethics of Nobody I Know: Gender and the Politics of Description | first= Timothy | last= Laurie | journal=Qualitative Research Journal | volume= 14 | issue= 1 | pages= 64–78 | year= 2014 | url= https://www.academia.edu/6262250 | doi=10.1108/qrj-03-2014-0011| hdl= 10453/44221 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Queer theory's commitment to deconstruction makes it nearly impossible to speak of a "lesbian" or "gay" subject, since all social categories are denaturalized and reduced to discourse.&lt;ref name = "Gamson"&gt;{{Citation |last= Gamson

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, queer theory cannot be a framework for examining selves or subjectivities—including those that accrue by race and class—but rather, must restrict its analytic focus to discourse.&lt;ref name = "Green2"/&gt; Hence, [[sociology]] and queer theory are regarded as methodologically and [[Epistemology|epistemologically]] [[Commensurability (philosophy of science)|incommensurable]] frameworks&lt;ref name = Green2&gt;{{Citation | doi= 10.1111/j.1467-9558.2007.00296.x | last= Green | first= Adam | title= Queer Theory and Sociology: Locating the Subject and the Self in Sexuality Studies | journal= Sociological Theory | volume= 25 | issue= 1 | pages= 26–45| year= 2007 | postscript= &lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; by critics such as Adam Isaiah Green. Thus Green writes that, in an introductory section,&lt;ref&gt;Warner, M. 1993. "Introduction." Pp. viii–xxxi in Fear of a Queer Planet. Queer Politics and Social Theory, edited by M. Warner. Minnesota: University of Minnesota Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Warner]] (1990s) draws out the possibility of queer theory as a kind of critical intervention in social theory (radical deconstructionism); despite this, he weaves back and forth between the reification and deconstruction of sexual identity. Green argues that Warner begins the volume by invoking an ethnic identity politics, solidified around a specific social cleavage and a discussion of the importance of deconstructing notions of lesbian and gay identities; but, despite its radical deconstructionism, it constructs the queer subject or self in largely conventional terms: as lesbian and gay people bound by homophobic institutions and practices.

So, one of the leading volumes of queer theory engages the subject via conventional sociological epistemologies that conceive of subject positions constituted through systems of stratification and organized around shared experience and identity.

In other way, for Ian Barnard,&lt;ref&gt;Barnard, I. 1999. "Queer Race." Social Semiotics 9(2):199–211.&lt;/ref&gt; any consideration of sexuality must include inextricability with racialized subjectivities. Adam Green argues that Barnard implicitly rejects the queer theoretical conceptions of sexuality on the grounds that such work fails to account for particularity of racialized sexualities. He reasons that the failure arises because queer theorists are themselves white, and therefore operate from the particularity of a white racial standpoint. Barnard aspires to recuperate an analysis of race in queer theory, proposing that the deconstructionist epistemology of queer theory can be used to decompose a white queerness (first) in order to recover a racialized queerness (second).
Thus, Adam Green argues that Barnard's attempt to bring social contingency into queer theory violates the core epistemological premise of queer theory; in fact, by proposing that queer theory capture racialized subject positions, Barnard reinstates what it means to be a person of colour. His critique of the white subject position of queer theorists is itself a testimony to the stability of the social order and the power of social categories to mark a particular kind of experience, of subjectivity and, in turn, of queer author. He backs down the road of a decidedly sociological analysis of subject position and the self.
Finally, [[Annamarie Jagose|Jagose]]&lt;ref&gt;Jagose, A. 1996. Queer Theory: An Introduction. New York: New York University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Green observes that Jagose aims toward an analysis of social cleavages, including those accruing by race and ethnicity. Thus, on the one, Jagose underscores the strong deconstructionist epistemological premise of the term queer and queer theory more generally. Yet, she goes on to analyze identities and sexualities "inflected by heterosexuality, race, gender and ethnicity".
Thus Adam Green states that by advocating the incorporation of social contingency in this way, Jagose offers neither the critical edge of queer theory nor the clarity of standpoint theory. However, on the topic of race, Jagose asserted that for a black lesbian, the thing of utmost importance is her lesbianism, rather than her race. Many gays and lesbians of color attacked this approach, accusing it of re-inscribing an essentially white identity into the heart of gay or lesbian identity (Jagose, 1996).&lt;ref name=4-encylopedia&gt;{{cite web|title=Queer Theory and the Social Construction of Sexuality|work=Homosexuality|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=15 November 2011|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/homosexuality/#QueTheSocConSex}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The criticism of queer theory can be divided in three main ideas:&lt;ref&gt;Green, A. I. "Queer Theory and Sociology: Locating the Subject and the Self in Sexuality Studies". University of Toronto.&lt;/ref&gt;
* It has a failing itineration, the "subjectless critique" of queer studies
* The unsustainable analysis of this failing self
* The methodological implication that scholars of sexuality end up reiterating and consolidating social categories

Green's views  suggest gay conservation and assimilation that derive from a more traditional perspective. His concerns regarding the potential loss of a critical edge by incorporating too much discourse on nonsexual identities is valid, however, theorists like Ruth Goldman and Cathy J. Cohen, think elsewise.

In Ruth Goldman's essay “Who Is That? Exploring Norms around Sexuality, Race, and Class in Queer Theory," she examines how rhetoric works to create a “normative discourse within queer theory” (169), and how that rhetoric serves to limit our perception of queer. In stark opposition to Green's critique, Goldman argues that in order to comply with queer theories intent to challenge the normal, it must provide a framework in which to challenge other oppressive norms that intersect with sexuality (i.e. racism, misogyny, classism, etc.). By acknowledging the intersection of multiple oppressions is to dismantle a single-issue framework, and thus, creating a platform for a more intensive analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3RwTCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA169&amp;dq=bell+hooks+queer+theory+#v=onepage&amp;q=bell%20hooks%20queer%20theory&amp;f=false|title=Queer Studies: A Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Anthology|last=Beemyn|first=Brett|last2=Eliason|first2=Michele|date=1996-01-01|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=9780814712573|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theorist Cathy J. Cohen offers a complex critique in "Punks, Bulldaggers and Welfare Queens: The Radical Potential of Queer Politics" that supports Goldman's ideology. Queerness, according to Cohen, provides conceptualizations that break the traditional binary visibility. Unlike single-identity-based frameworks—failing to serve those with multi-oppressed identities—queerness has the potential to unite these aspects of self to spark a more cohesive understanding of oppression. Yet Cohen expresses concerns surrounding the dichotomy between queer and heterosexual. This binary has created a misdirection of dialogue surrounding power dynamics. Thus an undercomplicated understanding of power has been sexually categorized: all heterosexuals are characterized as privileged and all queers are deemed as oppressed. As a result, queer politics have prioritized only one factor, sexuality as the primary lens through which they structure their action. Encouraging this method of thinking rejects others that are in or in-between the margins. Cohen states that to fully grasp the advantages of queer theory, ideals need to be further radicalized; as well as, push an intersectional lens when analyzing issues.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.isabelcporras.com/punks%2Bbulldaggers%2Bcohen.pdf|title=Punks, Bulldaggers and Welfare Queens: The Radical Potential of Queer Politics|last=Cohen|first=J.

Green argues that queer is itself an identity category that some self-identified "queer theorists" and "queer activists" use to consolidate a subject-position outside of the normalizing regimes of gender and sexuality.&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;{{Citation | last= Green | first= Adam Isaiah | title= Remembering Foucault: Queer Theory &amp; Disciplinary Power | journal= Sexualities | volume= 13 | issue= 3 | year= 2010 | postscript= &lt;!--none--&gt; | doi= 10.1177/1363460709364321 | pages= 316–337}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These examples call into question the degree to which identity categories need be thought of as negative, in the evaluative sense of that term, as they underscore the self-determining potentials of the care of the self – an idea advanced first by Foucault in Volumes II and III of The History of Sexuality.

The role of queer theory, and specifically its replacement of historical and sociological scholarship on lesbian and gay people's lives with the theorising of lesbian and gay issues, and the displacement of gay and lesbian studies by gender and queer studies, has been criticised by activist and writer [[Larry Kramer]].&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser, Charles, [https://web.archive.org/web/20090502193413/http://www.advocate.com/exclusive_detail_ektid81256.asp Larry Kramer's Case Against "Queer"] Advocate.com, April 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2009/04/28/kramer|title=Inside Higher Ed's News|website=www.insidehighered.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/|title=The Daily Beast|website=The Daily Beast}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kramer reports on a book by Richard Godbeer, a professor of history and gender studies at the University of Miami, called The Overflowing of Friendship. Kramer criticizes Godbeer's account of 18th century Colonial times. Kramer writes, "Godbeer is hell-bent on convincing us that two men in Colonial America could have exceedingly obsessive and passionate relationships (he called them, variously, 'sentimental,' 'loving,' 'romantic') . . . [men would] spend many a night in bed together talking their hearts out, without the issue of sex arising in any way."&lt;ref name=kramer&gt;{{Citation|last=Kramer|first=Larry|title=Queer Theory's Heist of Our History|journal=Gay &amp; Lesbian Review Worldwide|year=2011|volume=16|issue=5|url=http://www.glreview.com/article.php?articleid=166|accessdate=5 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111215092327/http://www.glreview.com/article.php?articleid=166|archivedate=15 December 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kramer does not agree with this theory and believes that the notion the same-sex sexual relationships and experiences existed. Relatedly, educator and writer [[John D'Emilio|John D’Emilio]] argues that gay identity has not always existed and the emergence of gay men and lesbian was rather a later development associated with the spread of capitalism in the 19th century. A capitalist system of free labor propagated in society and the independent unit of the nuclear family no longer became a necessary economical unit. As the family in turn took on a new role as an emotional and affective unit and separated from the world of work and production, the idea of sexuality separated from that of procreation. Sexuality, no longer bound by the imperative of reproduction, experienced a change and allowed people to think differently about desire, thus creating conditions allowing for the expression of homosexual behavior and the construction of a gay identity.&lt;ref&gt;D’Emilio, J. (1983). Capitalism and gay identity. ''Families in the US: Kinship and domestic politics'', 131-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another criticism is that queer theory, in part because it typically has recourse to a very technical jargon, is written by a narrow elite for that narrow elite. It is therefore class biased and also, in practice, only really known and referenced at universities and colleges (Malinowitz, 1993).&lt;ref name=4-encylopedia /&gt; In addition, those in a position of power, have access to modes of communication where they can express their interpretation, definitions and descriptions of topics, sometimes regardless of the accuracy. This persons of power are given “privileged act of naming.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hooks | first1 = Bell | year = 1991 | title = Theory as liberatory practice | url = | journal = Yale Journal of Law and Feminism | volume = 4 | issue = | page = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, this can obscure the perception of reality for those in institutionalized settings. Academia often neglects works of theory by women or men of color. This can be attributed to the fact that institutions have imposed standards of critical evaluations for what is a work of theory and what is not. These standards have led to appropriation of work that was deemed unfit and have created a stark exclusion of people who can access the material. This turns the mass public against the idea of understanding theory; an important aspect in relation to understanding practice. The institutionalization of queer theory has imposed a threat of taming and domesticating critical energy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

An initial criticism on queer theory is that precisely "queer" does not refer to any specific sexual status or gender object choice. For example, Halperin (1995)&lt;ref name=4-encylopedia /&gt;  allows that straight persons may be "queer," which some believe, robs gays and lesbians of the distinctiveness of what causes them to be marginalized. It desexualizes identity, when the issue is precisely about a sexual identity (Jagose, 1996).&lt;ref name=4-encylopedia /&gt; On the other hand, Michael Warner argues that the objective of queer is to challenge normalness not heterosexuality. This ties back into Cohen's point about the power dichotomy. Straight persons can be oppressed for behaviors that are seen as sexually deviant as well. One example is the “welfare queen,” a woman of color who is marginalized for her race, sexuality and gender—all identities which intersect to create this kind of oppression.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The critique of queer theory is not limited to the US. Queer theory was repeatedly criticized by the Vatican. Pope Francis spoke about "ideological colonization" by which he meant that queer theory, and more broadly critical gender studies, threatens traditional family and fertile heterosexuality. France was one of the first countries where this claim became widespread when catholic movements marched in the streets of Paris against the bill on gay marriage and adoption. [[Bruno Perreau]] in [http://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=27481 Queer Theory: The French Response] &lt;ref&gt;Queer Theory: The French Response, Stanford University Press, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; has shown that this fear has deep historical roots in France. He argues that the rejection of queer theory expresses anxieties about national identity and minority politics. Minority groups could betray the nation and prefer transnational identities. Perreau maintains that queer theory shows that being part of a group requires the ability to critique one's own belonging. This is largely unbearable to reactionary movements, Perreau argues, all the more because queer theory is ironically largely based on French theory.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38436">'''Radiometric dating''' or '''radioactive dating''' is a technique used to [[Chronological dating|date]] materials such as [[Rock (geology)|rocks]] or [[carbon]], in which trace radioactive [[impurity|impurities]] were selectively incorporated when they were  formed. The method compares the abundance of a naturally occurring [[Radionuclide|radioactive isotope]] within the material to the abundance of its [[Radioactive decay|decay]] products, which form at a known constant rate of decay.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=radioactive dating|file=R05082}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of radiometric dating was first published in 1907 by [[Bertram Boltwood]]&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | author = Boltwood, Bertram | year = 1907 | title = The Ultimate Disintegration Products of the Radio-active Elements. Part II. The disintegration products of uranium | journal = American Journal of Science | series = 4 | volume = 23 | issue = 134 | pages = 77–88 | doi=10.2475/ajs.s4-23.134.78}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is now the principal source of information about the [[Absolute dating|absolute age]] of rocks and other [[Geology|geological features]], including the age of [[Paleontology|fossilized life forms]] or the [[age of the Earth]] itself, and can also be used to date a wide range of natural and [[Artifact (archaeology)|man-made materials]].

Together with [[Stratigraphy|stratigraphic principles]], radiometric dating methods are used in [[geochronology]] to establish the [[geologic time scale]].&lt;ref&gt;McRae, A. 1998. ''Radiometric Dating and the Geological Time Scale: Circular Reasoning or Reliable Tools?'' [http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dating.html Radiometric Dating and the Geological Time Scale [[TalkOrigins Archive]]]&lt;/ref&gt; Among the best-known techniques are [[radiocarbon dating]], [[potassium–argon dating]] and [[uranium–lead dating]]. By allowing the establishment of geological timescales, it provides a significant source of information about the ages of [[fossil]]s and the deduced rates of [[evolution]]ary change. Radiometric dating is also used to date [[archaeology|archaeological]] materials, including ancient artifacts.

Different methods of radiometric dating vary in the timescale over which they are accurate and the materials to which they can be applied.

==Fundamentals==

===Radioactive decay===
[[Image:Thorium decay chain from lead-212 to lead-208.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Example of a radioactive [[decay chain]] from lead-212 (&lt;sup&gt;212&lt;/sup&gt;Pb) to lead-208 (&lt;sup&gt;208&lt;/sup&gt;Pb) . Each parent nuclide spontaneously decays into a daughter nuclide (the [[decay product]]) via an [[alpha decay|α decay]] or a [[beta decay|β&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; decay]]. The final decay product, lead-208 (&lt;sup&gt;208&lt;/sup&gt;Pb), is stable and can no longer undergo spontaneous radioactive decay.]]
All ordinary [[matter]] is made up of combinations of [[chemical element]]s, each with its own [[atomic number]], indicating the number of [[proton]]s in the [[atomic nucleus]]. Additionally, elements may exist in different [[isotope]]s, with each isotope of an element differing in the number of [[neutron]]s in the nucleus. A particular isotope of a particular element is called a [[nuclide]]. Some nuclides are inherently unstable. That is, at some point in time, an atom of such a nuclide will undergo [[radioactive decay]] and spontaneously transform into a different nuclide. This transformation may be accomplished in a number of different ways, including [[alpha decay]] (emission of [[alpha particle]]s) and [[beta decay]] ([[electron]] emission, [[positron]] emission, or [[electron capture]]). Another possibility is [[spontaneous fission]] into two or more nuclides.

While the moment in time at which a particular nucleus decays is unpredictable, a collection of atoms of a radioactive nuclide decays [[exponential decay|exponentially]] at a rate described by a parameter known as the [[half-life]], usually given in units of years when discussing dating techniques. After one half-life has elapsed, one half of the atoms of the nuclide in question will have decayed into a "daughter" nuclide or [[decay product]]. In many cases, the daughter nuclide itself is radioactive, resulting in a [[decay chain]], eventually ending with the formation of a stable (nonradioactive) daughter nuclide; each step in such a chain is characterized by a distinct half-life. In these cases, usually the half-life of interest in radiometric dating is the longest one in the chain, which is the rate-limiting factor in the ultimate transformation of the radioactive nuclide into its stable daughter. Isotopic systems that have been exploited for radiometric dating have half-lives ranging from only about 10 years (e.g., [[tritium]]) to over 100 billion years (e.g., [[samarium-147]]).&lt;ref name="Bernard-Griffiths1989"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bernard-Griffiths|first1=J.|last2=Groan|first2=G.|editor1-last=Roth|editor1-first=Etienne|editor2-last=Poty|editor2-first=Bernard|title=Nuclear Methods of Dating|date=1989|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=978-0-7923-0188-2|pages=53 – 72|chapter=The samarium–neodymium method}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For most radioactive nuclides, the half-life depends solely on nuclear properties and is essentially a constant. It is not affected by external factors such as [[temperature]], [[pressure]], chemical environment, or presence of a [[magnetic field|magnetic]] or [[electric field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1146/annurev.ns.22.120172.001121 |title=Perturbation of Nuclear Decay Rates |year=1972 |author=Emery, G T |journal=Annual Review of Nuclear Science |volume=22|issue=1 |pages=165–202|bibcode = 1972ARNPS..22..165E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1038/264340a0 |title=Direct test of the constancy of fundamental nuclear constants |year=1976 |author=Shlyakhter, A.

''How to Change Nuclear Decay Rates'' [http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/ParticleAndNuclear/decay_rates.html Usenet Physics FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; The only exceptions are nuclides that decay by the process of electron capture, such as [[beryllium-7]], [[strontium-85]], and [[zirconium-89]], whose decay rate may be affected by local electron density. For all other nuclides, the proportion of the original nuclide to its decay products changes in a predictable way as the original nuclide decays over time. This predictability allows the relative abundances of related nuclides to be used as a [[clock]] to measure the time from the incorporation of the original nuclides into a material to the present.

===Accuracy of radiometric dating===
[[Image:Thermal ionization mass spectrometer.jpg|thumb|[[Thermal ionization mass spectrometer]] used in radiometric dating.]]
The basic equation of radiometric dating requires that neither the parent nuclide nor the daughter product can enter or leave the material after its formation. The possible confounding effects of contamination of parent and daughter isotopes have to be considered, as do the effects of any loss or gain of such isotopes since the sample was created. It is therefore essential to have as much information as possible about the material being dated and to check for possible signs of [[Metasomatism|alteration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/0012-821X(96)00132-X |title=3-D, &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ar---&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt;Ar geochronology in the Paraná continental flood basalt province |year=1996 |author=Stewart, K,, Turner, S, Kelley, S, Hawkesworh, C Kristein, L and Manotvani, M |journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters |volume=143|issue=1–4 |pages=95–109 |bibcode=1996E&amp;PSL.143...95S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Precision is enhanced if measurements are taken on multiple samples from different locations of the rock body. Alternatively, if several different minerals can be dated from the same sample and are assumed to be formed by the same event and were in equilibrium with the reservoir when they formed, they should form an [[isochron dating|isochron]]. This can reduce the problem of [[contamination]]. In [[uranium–lead dating]], the [[concordia diagram]] is used which also decreases the problem of nuclide loss. Finally, correlation between different isotopic dating methods may be required to confirm the age of a sample. For example, the age of the Amitsoq [[gneiss]]es from western [[Greenland]] was determined to be {{Ma|3.60|million years ago (MA)|error=0.05|round=2}} using uranium–lead dating and {{Ma|3.56|Ma|error=0.10|round=2}} using lead–lead dating, results that are consistent with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dalrymple|first1=G. Brent|title=The age of the earth|date=1994|publisher=Stanford Univ. Press|location=Stanford, Calif.|isbn=9780804723312}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|142&amp;ndash;143}}

Accurate radiometric dating generally requires that the parent has a long enough half-life that it will be present in significant amounts at the time of measurement (except as described below under "Dating with short-lived extinct radionuclides"), the half-life of the parent is accurately known, and enough of the daughter product is produced to be accurately measured and distinguished from the initial amount of the daughter present in the material. The procedures used to isolate and analyze the parent and daughter nuclides must be precise and accurate. This normally involves [[isotope-ratio mass spectrometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dickin|first1=Alan P.|title=Radiogenic isotope geology|date=2008|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521530170|pages=15&amp;ndash;49|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The precision of a dating method depends in part on the half-life of the radioactive isotope involved. For instance, carbon-14 has a half-life of 5,730 years. After an organism has been dead for 60,000 years, so little carbon-14 is left that accurate dating cannot be established. On the other hand, the concentration of carbon-14 falls off so steeply that the age of relatively young remains can be determined precisely to within a few decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Closure temperature===
{{Main article|Closure temperature}}

If a material that selectively rejects the daughter nuclide is heated, any daughter nuclides that have been accumulated over time will be lost through [[diffusion]], setting the isotopic "clock" to zero. The temperature at which this happens is known as the [[closure temperature]] or blocking temperature and is specific to a particular material and isotopic system. These temperatures are experimentally determined in the lab by [[Petrology#Branches|artificially resetting sample minerals]] using a high-temperature furnace. As the mineral cools, the crystal structure begins to form and diffusion of isotopes is less easy. At a certain temperature, the crystal structure has formed sufficiently to prevent diffusion of isotopes. This temperature is what is known as closure temperature and represents the temperature below which the mineral is a closed system to isotopes. Thus an igneous or metamorphic rock or melt, which is slowly cooling, does not begin to exhibit measurable radioactive decay until it cools below the closure temperature. The age that can be calculated by radiometric dating is thus the time at which the rock or mineral cooled to closure temperature.&lt;ref name=Faure&gt;{{Cite book|first=Gunter |last=Faure |title=Principles and applications of geochemistry: a comprehensive textbook for geology students |publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] |location=[[Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey]] |year=1998 |pages= |edition=2nd |isbn=978-0-02-336450-1 |oclc=37783103}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rollinson&gt;{{Cite book|first=Hugh R. |last=Rollinson |title=Using geochemical data: evaluation, presentation, interpretation |publisher=[[Longman]] |location=[[Harlow]] |year=1993 |pages= |isbn=978-0-582-06701-1 |oclc=27937350}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dating of different minerals and/or isotope systems (with differing closure temperatures) within the same rock can therefore enable the tracking of the thermal history of the rock in question with time, and thus the history of metamorphic events may become known in detail. This field is known as [[thermochronology]] or thermochronometry.

===The age equation===
[[Image:Sm Nd Great Dyke Isochron.png|thumb|right|upright=1.5|[[Samarium–neodymium dating|Sm/Nd]] Isochron plotted of samples&lt;ref name=Oberthuer&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0301-9268(01)00215-7 |title=Precise U–Pb mineral ages, Rb–Sr and Sm–Nd systematics for the Great Dyke, Zimbabwe—constraints on late Archean events in the Zimbabwe craton and Limpopo belt |year=2002 |author=Oberthür, T, Davis, DW, Blenkinsop, TG, Hoehndorf, A |journal=Precambrian Research |volume=113|issue=3–4 |pages=293–306|bibcode=2002PreR..113..293O }}&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Great Dyke]], [[Zimbabwe]]. The age is calculated from the slope of the isochron (line) and the original composition from the intercept of the isochron with the y-axis.]]

The mathematical expression that relates radioactive decay to geologic time is&lt;ref name=Faure/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cornell"&gt;{{Cite web|first=W. M. |last=White |year=2003 |title=Basics of Radioactive Isotope Geochemistry |publisher=[[Cornell University]] |url=http://www.geo.cornell.edu/geology/classes/Geo656/656notes03/656%2003Lecture04.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''D'' = ''D''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ''N''(''t'') (''e''&lt;sup&gt;''λt''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1)

where
:''t'' is age of the sample,
:''D'' is number of atoms of the daughter isotope in the sample,
:''D''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is number of atoms of the daughter isotope in the original composition,
:''N'' is number of atoms of the parent isotope in the sample at time t (the present), given by ''N''(''t'') = ''N&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;e''&lt;sup&gt;-''λt''&lt;/sup&gt;, and
:''λ'' is the [[decay constant]] of the parent isotope, equal to the inverse of the radioactive [[half-life]] of the parent isotope&lt;ref name=usgs&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/geotime/radiometric.html |title=Geologic Time: Radiometric Time Scale |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] |date=16 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; times the natural logarithm of 2.

The equation is most conveniently expressed in terms of the measured quantity ''N''(''t'') rather than the constant initial value ''N&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;''.

The above equation makes use of information on the composition of parent and daughter isotopes at the time the material being tested cooled below its closure temperature. This is well-established for most isotopic systems.&lt;ref name=Rollinson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/0012-821X(75)90088-6 |title=Approximation of terrestrial lead isotope evolution by a two-stage model |date=June 1975 |first=J.

Kramers  |journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=207–221 |bibcode=1975E&amp;PSL..26..207S}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, construction of an isochron does not require information on the original compositions, using merely the present ratios of the parent and daughter isotopes to a standard isotope. Plotting an isochron is used to solve the age equation graphically and calculate the age of the sample and the original composition.

==Modern dating methods==
Radiometric dating has been carried out since 1905 when it was [[Age of the Earth#Invention of radiometric dating|invented]] by [[Ernest Rutherford]] as a method by which one might determine the [[age of the Earth]]. In the century since then the techniques have been greatly improved and expanded.&lt;ref name=usgs/&gt; Dating can now be performed on samples as small as a nanogram using a [[mass spectrometer]]. The mass spectrometer was invented in the 1940s and began to be used in radiometric dating in the 1950s. It operates by generating a beam of [[ion|ionized atoms]] from the sample under test. The ions then travel through a magnetic field, which diverts them into different sampling sensors, known as "[[Faraday cup]]s", depending on their mass and level of ionization. On impact in the cups, the ions set up a very weak current that can be measured to determine the rate of impacts and the relative concentrations of different atoms in the beams.

===Uranium–lead dating method===
{{Main article|Uranium–lead dating}}

[[Uranium–lead radiometric dating]] involves using uranium-235 or uranium-238 to date a substance's absolute age.

Uranium–lead dating is often performed on the [[mineral]] [[zircon]] (ZrSiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), though it can be used on other materials, such as [[baddeleyite]], as well as [[monazite]] (see: [[monazite geochronology]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.2113/104.1.13 |title=SHRIMP baddeleyite and zircon ages for an Umkondo dolerite sill, Nyanga Mountains, Eastern Zimbabwe |year=2001 |first=M.T.D. |last=Wingate |journal=South African Journal of Geology |volume=104|issue=1 |pages=13–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zircon and baddeleyite incorporate uranium atoms into their crystalline structure as substitutes for [[zirconium]], but strongly reject lead. Zircon has a very high closure temperature, is resistant to mechanical weathering and is very chemically inert. Zircon also forms multiple crystal layers during metamorphic events, which each may record an isotopic age of the event. ''In situ'' micro-beam analysis can be achieved via laser [[ICP-MS]] or [[Secondary ion mass spectrometry|SIMS]] techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.286.5448.2289 |title=Isotope Geochemistry: New Tools for Isotopic Analysis |date=December 1999 |first=Trevor |last=Ireland |journal=Science |volume=286 |issue=5448 |pages=2289–2290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of its great advantages is that any sample provides two clocks, one based on uranium-235's decay to lead-207 with a half-life of about 700 million years, and one based on uranium-238's decay to lead-206 with a half-life of about 4.5 billion years, providing a built-in crosscheck that allows accurate determination of the age of the sample even if some of the lead has been lost. This can be seen in the concordia diagram, where the samples plot along an errorchron (straight line) which intersects the concordia curve at the age of the sample.

===Samarium–neodymium dating method===
{{Main article|Samarium–neodymium dating}}

This involves the [[alpha decay]] of &lt;sup&gt;147&lt;/sup&gt;Sm to &lt;sup&gt;143&lt;/sup&gt;Nd with a [[half-life]] of 1.06 x 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; years. Accuracy levels of within twenty million years in ages of two-and-a-half billion years are achievable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0012-821X(98)00228-3 |title=A multielement geochronologic study of the Great Dyke, Zimbabwe: significance of the robust and reset ages |date=December 1998 |first=S.

===Potassium–argon dating method===
{{Main article|Potassium–argon dating}}

This involves [[electron capture]] or [[positron]] decay of potassium-40 to argon-40. Potassium-40 has a half-life of 1.3 billion years, and so this method is applicable to the oldest rocks. Radioactive potassium-40 is common in [[mica]]s, [[feldspar]]s, and [[hornblende]]s, though the closure temperature is fairly low in these materials, about 350&amp;nbsp;°C (mica) to 500&amp;nbsp;°C (hornblende).

===Rubidium–strontium dating method===
{{Main article|Rubidium–strontium dating}}

This is based on the beta decay of [[rubidium-87]] to [[strontium-87]], with a half-life of 50 billion years. This scheme is used to date old [[igneous rock|igneous]] and [[metamorphic rock]]s, and has also been used to date [[moon rock|lunar samples]]. Closure temperatures are so high that they are not a concern. Rubidium-strontium dating is not as precise as the uranium-lead method, with errors of 30 to 50 million years for a 3-billion-year-old sample.

===Uranium–thorium dating method===
{{Main article|Uranium–thorium dating}}

A relatively short-range dating technique is based on the decay of uranium-234 into thorium-230, a substance with a half-life of about 80,000 years. It is accompanied by a sister process, in which uranium-235 decays into protactinium-231, which has a half-life of 32,760 years.

While [[uranium]] is water-soluble, [[thorium]] and [[protactinium]] are not, and so they are selectively precipitated into ocean-floor [[sediment]]s, from which their ratios are measured. The scheme has a range of several hundred thousand years. A related method is [[ionium–thorium dating]], which measures the ratio of [[ionium]] (thorium-230) to thorium-232 in ocean sediment.

===Radiocarbon dating method===
{{Main article|Radiocarbon dating}}
[[Image:Ales stenar bred.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|right|[[Ale's Stones]] at Kåseberga, around ten kilometres south east of [[Ystad]], [[Sweden]] were dated at 56 CE using the carbon-14 method on organic material found at the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.raa.se/cms/extern/en/places_to_visit/our_historical_sites/ales_stenar.html |title=Ales stenar |publisher=The Swedish National Heritage Board |date=11 October 2006 |accessdate=9 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331132307/http://www.raa.se/cms/extern/en/places_to_visit/our_historical_sites/ales_stenar.html |archivedate=31 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;]] [[Radiocarbon dating]] is also simply called Carbon-14 dating. Carbon-14 is a radioactive isotope of carbon, with a half-life of 5,730 years,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clark |first=R. M. |year=1975 |title=A calibration curve for radiocarbon dates |journal=Antiquity |volume=49 |pages=251–266 |url=http://www.antiquity.ac.uk/ant/049/Ant0490251.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.5194/angeo-20-115-2002 |first=S.

Carbon-14, though, is continuously created through collisions of neutrons generated by [[cosmic rays]] with nitrogen in the [[upper atmosphere]] and thus remains at a near-constant level on Earth. The carbon-14 ends up as a trace component in atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

A carbon-based life form acquires carbon during its lifetime. Plants acquire it through [[photosynthesis]], and animals acquire it from consumption of plants and other animals. When an organism dies, it ceases to take in new carbon-14, and the existing isotope decays with a characteristic half-life (5730 years). The proportion of carbon-14 left when the remains of the organism are examined provides an indication of the time elapsed since its death. This makes carbon-14 an ideal dating method to date the age of bones or the remains of an organism. The carbon-14 dating limit lies around 58,000 to 62,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Wolfango |last=Plastino |author2=Lauri Kaihola |author3=Paolo Bartolomei |author4=Francesco Bella |year=2001 |title=Cosmic background reduction in the radiocarbon measurement by scintillation spectrometry at the underground laboratory of Gran Sasso |url=http://digitalcommons.library.arizona.edu/objectviewer?o=http%3A%2F%2Fradiocarbon.library.arizona.edu%2FVolume43%2FNumber2A%2Fazu_radiocarbon_v43_n2A_157_161_v.pdf |journal=Radiocarbon |volume=43 |issue=2A |pages=157–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rate of creation of carbon-14 appears to be roughly constant, as cross-checks of carbon-14 dating with other dating methods show it gives consistent results. However, local eruptions of [[volcano]]es or other events that give off large amounts of carbon dioxide can reduce local concentrations of carbon-14 and give inaccurate dates. The releases of carbon dioxide into the [[biosphere]] as a consequence of [[industrialization]] have also depressed the proportion of carbon-14 by a few percent; conversely, the amount of carbon-14 was increased by above-ground [[nuclear bomb]] tests that were conducted into the early 1960s. Also, an increase in the [[solar wind]] or the Earth's [[magnetic field]] above the current value would depress the amount of carbon-14 created in the atmosphere.

===Fission track dating method===
{{Main article|fission track dating}}
[[Image:Apatite Canada.jpg|thumb|[[Apatite]] crystals are widely used in fission track dating.]]
This involves inspection of a polished slice of a material to determine the density of "track" markings left in it by the [[spontaneous fission]] of uranium-238 impurities. The uranium content of the sample has to be known, but that can be determined by placing a plastic film over the polished slice of the material, and bombarding it with [[thermal neutrons|slow neutrons]]. This causes induced fission of &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U, as opposed to the spontaneous fission of &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U. The fission tracks produced by this process are recorded in the plastic film. The uranium content of the material can then be calculated from the number of tracks and the [[neutron flux]].

This scheme has application over a wide range of geologic dates. For dates up to a few million years [[mica]]s, [[tektite]]s (glass fragments from volcanic eruptions), and meteorites are best used. Older materials can be dated using [[zircon]], [[apatite]], [[titanite]], [[epidote]] and [[garnet]] which have a variable amount of uranium content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0899-5362(01)80066-X |title=A titanite fission track profile across the southeastern Archæan Kaapvaal Craton and the Mesoproterozoic Natal Metamorphic Province, South Africa: evidence for differential cryptic Meso- to Neoproterozoic tectonism |date=August 2001 |first=J. |last=Jacobs |author2=R. J. Thomas |journal=Journal of African Earth Sciences |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=323–333|bibcode = 2001JAfES..33..323J }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the fission tracks are healed by temperatures over about 200&amp;nbsp;°C the technique has limitations as well as benefits. The technique has potential applications for detailing the thermal history of a deposit.

===Chlorine-36 dating method===
Large amounts of otherwise rare [[chlorine-36|&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;Cl]] (half-life ~300ky) were produced by irradiation of seawater during atmospheric detonations of [[nuclear weapon]]s between 1952 and 1958. The residence time of &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;Cl in the atmosphere is about 1 week. Thus, as an event marker of 1950s water in soil and ground water, &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;Cl is also useful for dating waters less than 50 years before the present. &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;Cl has seen use in other areas of the geological sciences, including dating ice and sediments.

===Luminescence dating methods===
{{Main article|Luminescence dating}}

Luminescence dating methods are not radiometric dating methods in that they do not rely on abundances of isotopes to calculate age. Instead, they are a consequence of [[background radiation]] on certain minerals. Over time, [[ionizing radiation]] is absorbed by mineral grains in sediments and archaeological materials such as [[quartz]] and [[potassium feldspar]]. The radiation causes charge to remain within the grains in structurally unstable "electron traps". Exposure to sunlight or heat releases these charges, effectively "bleaching" the sample and resetting the clock to zero. The trapped charge accumulates over time at a rate determined by the amount of background radiation at the location where the sample was buried. Stimulating these mineral grains using either light ([[optically stimulated luminescence]] or infrared stimulated luminescence dating) or heat ([[thermoluminescence dating]]) causes a luminescence signal to be emitted as the stored unstable electron energy is released, the intensity of which varies depending on the amount of radiation absorbed during burial and specific properties of the mineral.

These methods can be used to date the age of a sediment layer, as layers deposited on top would prevent the grains from being "bleached" and reset by sunlight. Pottery shards can be dated to the last time they experienced significant heat, generally when they were fired in a kiln.

==Dating with decay products of short-lived extinct radionuclides==
Absolute radiometric dating requires a measurable fraction of parent nucleus to remain in the sample rock. For rocks dating back to the beginning of the solar system, this requires extremely long-lived parent isotopes, making measurement of such rocks' exact ages imprecise. To be able to distinguish the relative ages of rocks from such old material, and to get a better time resolution than that available from long-lived isotopes, short-lived isotopes that are no longer present in the rock can be used.&lt;ref&gt;Imke de Pater and Jack J. Lissauer: ''Planetary Sciences'', page 321. Cambridge University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-521-48219-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the solar system, there were several relatively short-lived radionuclides like &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al, &lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Fe, &lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt;Mn, and &lt;sup&gt;129&lt;/sup&gt;I present within the solar nebula. These radionuclides—possibly produced by the explosion of a supernova—are extinct today, but their decay products can be detected in very old material, such as that which constitutes [[meteorite]]s. By measuring the decay products of extinct radionuclides with a [[mass spectrometer]] and using isochronplots, it is possible to determine relative ages of different events in the early history of the solar system. Dating methods based on extinct radionuclides can also be calibrated with the U-Pb method to give absolute ages. Thus both the approximate age and a high time resolution can be obtained. Generally a shorter half-life leads to a higher time resolution at the expense of timescale.

===The &lt;sup&gt;129&lt;/sup&gt;I – &lt;sup&gt;129&lt;/sup&gt;Xe chronometer===
{{see also|Iodine-129#Meteorite age dating}}
&lt;sup&gt;129&lt;/sup&gt;I beta-decays to &lt;sup&gt;129&lt;/sup&gt;Xe with a half-life of 16 million years. The iodine-xenon chronometer&lt;ref name=IXe&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gilmour|first=J. D. |author2=O. V Pravdivtseva |author3=A. Busfield |author4=C. M. Hohenberg|title=The I-Xe Chronometer and the Early Solar System|journal=Meteoritics and Planetary Science|year=2006|volume=41|pages=19–31|doi=10.1111/j.1945-5100.2006.tb00190.x|url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?bibcode=2006M%26PS...41...19G&amp;db_key=AST&amp;page_ind=0&amp;data_type=GIF&amp;type=SCREEN_VIEW&amp;classic=YES|accessdate=2013-01-21|bibcode = 2006M&amp;PS...41...19G }}&lt;/ref&gt;  is an isochron technique.  Samples are exposed to neutrons in a nuclear reactor.  This converts the only stable isotope of iodine (&lt;sup&gt;127&lt;/sup&gt;I) into &lt;sup&gt;128&lt;/sup&gt;Xe via neutron capture followed by beta decay (of &lt;sup&gt;128&lt;/sup&gt;I).  After irradiation, samples are heated in a series of steps and the xenon [[isotopic signature]] of the gas evolved in each step is analysed.  When a consistent  &lt;sup&gt;129&lt;/sup&gt;Xe/&lt;sup&gt;128&lt;/sup&gt;Xe ratio is observed across several consecutive temperature steps, it can be interpreted as corresponding to a time at which the sample stopped losing xenon.

Samples of a meteorite called Shallowater are usually included in the irradiation to monitor the conversion efficiency from &lt;sup&gt;127&lt;/sup&gt;I to &lt;sup&gt;128&lt;/sup&gt;Xe.  The difference between the measured &lt;sup&gt;129&lt;/sup&gt;Xe/&lt;sup&gt;128&lt;/sup&gt;Xe ratios of the sample and Shallowater then corresponds to the different ratios of &lt;sup&gt;129&lt;/sup&gt;I/&lt;sup&gt;127&lt;/sup&gt;I when they each stopped losing xenon.  This in turn corresponds to a difference in age of closure in the early solar system.

===The &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al – &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Mg chronometer===
Another example of short-lived extinct radionuclide dating is the [[Aluminium-26|&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al]] – &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Mg chronometer, which can be used to estimate the relative ages of [[chondrules]]. &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al decays to &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Mg with a [[half-life]] of 720 000 years. The dating is simply a question of finding the deviation from the [[natural abundance]] of &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Mg (the product of &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al decay) in comparison with the ratio of the stable isotopes &lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;Al/&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;Mg.

The excess of &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Mg (often designated &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Mg* ) is found by comparing the &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Mg/&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;Mg ratio to that of other Solar System materials.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander N. Krot(2002) Dating the Earliest Solids in our Solar System, Hawai'i Institute of Geophysics and Planetology http://www.psrd.hawaii.edu/Sept02/isotopicAges.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

The &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Al – &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;Mg chronometer gives an estimate of the time period for formation of primitive meteorites of only a few million years (1.4 million years for Chondrule formation).&lt;ref&gt;Imke de Pater and Jack J.

The '''Sambas Treasure''' is a hoard of ancient gold and silver buddhist sculptures found near the town of [[Sambas (town)|Sambas]] in west [[Borneo]] that now form part of the [[British Museum]]'s collection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?people=136665&amp;peoA=136665-3-7 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Dating from 8th-9th centuries AD, they pre-date the coming of Islam to the [[Indonesia]]n archipelago by four centuries and were probably made in [[Java]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/art-asia/southeast-asia/maritime-se-asia/a/a-cache-of-buddhist-figures-from-the-sambas-treasure "A Cache of Buddhist figures from the Sambas Treasure"] Khan Academy. Retrieved 2017-08-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of Buddhism in Southeast Asia==
Until [[Islam]] became the dominant religion in Indonesia in the 13th Century, both [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]] were adopted from the India subcontinent as the principal local religions. Over time, many  buddhist sculptures were transported to the islands by pilgrims returning from holy sites in eastern India.  These in turn inspired local craftsmen who developed their own styles and traits. The buddhist sculptures from Sambas Treasure was almost certainly made in Java based on artistic models that were developed in eastern [[India]] centuries before.

==Discovery and ownership==
The Sambas Treasure was found in a large earthenware pot on the south-west coast of Borneo sometime during the 1940s. It was then owned by the collector Tan Yeok Seong, a [[Singaporean]] historian of [[Southeast Asia]] and a collector of historical artefacts. The treasure was subsequently bought by the [[philanthropist]] PT Brooke Sewell, who donated it to the British Museum in 1956.

==Description==
The hoard is composed of nine gold and silver [[buddha]] and [[bodhisattva]] images. The largest figure is approximately 18&amp;nbsp;cm high and represents a standing Buddha made of sold silver. In addition to the Buddhist sculptures, the treasure includes a bronze [[incense burner]] in the shape of a house and a silver votive plaque with text in [[dhāraṇī]], which was found in the base of the large Buddha figure. The high quality of the craftsmanship and the use of precious metals such as gold and silver suggest they were originally made for an important local dignitary or patron.

'''Solar radiation management''' (SRM) projects are a type of [[climate engineering]] which seek to reflect sunlight and thus reduce [[global warming]]. Proposed methods include increasing the planetary [[albedo]], for example using [[stratospheric sulfate aerosols (geoengineering)|stratospheric sulfate aerosols]]. Restorative methods have been proposed regarding the protection of natural heat reflectors like sea ice, snow and glaciers with engineering projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Desch|first1=Steven J.|last2=et al|title=Arctic Ice Management|journal=Earth's Future|date=19 December 2016|doi=10.1002/2016EF000410|volume=5|issue=1|pages=107–127|bibcode=2017EaFut...5..107D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McGlynn|first1=Daniel|title=One big reflective band-aid|url=https://engineering.berkeley.edu/2017/01/one-big-reflective-band-aid|accessdate=2 January 2018|work=Berkley Engineering|publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]]|date=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Meyer|first1=Robinson|title=A Radical New Scheme to Prevent Catastrophic Sea-Level Rise|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/01/a-new-geo-engineering-proposal-to-stop-sea-level-rise/550214|accessdate=12 January 2018|work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their principal advantages as an approach to climate engineering is the speed with which they can be deployed and become fully active, their potential low financial cost, and the reversibility of their direct climatic effects.

Solar radiation management projects could serve as a temporary response while levels of greenhouse gases can be brought under control by [[Climate change mitigation|mitigation]] and [[greenhouse gas removal]] techniques. They would not reduce [[greenhouse gas]] concentrations in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], and thus do not address problems such as [[ocean acidification]] caused by excess [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

==Purpose==
Climate engineering projects have been proposed in order to reduce [[global warming]]. As early as 1974, Russian expert [[Mikhail Budyko]] suggested that if global warming became a problem, we could cool down the planet by burning sulfur in the stratosphere, which would create a haze. The annual cost of delivering a sufficient amount of sulfur to counteract expected greenhouse warming is estimated at 2 to 8 billion USD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McClellan|first1=Justin|last2=Keith|first2=David W.|last3=Apt|first3=Jay|title=Cost analysis of stratospheric albedo modification delivery systems|issue=3|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/7/3/034019#erl427423s6|journal=Environmental Research Letters|volume=7|pages=034019|language=en|doi=10.1088/1748-9326/7/3/034019|date=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A preliminary study by [[Edward Teller]] and others in 1997 presented the pros and cons of various relatively "low-tech" proposals to mitigate global warming through scattering/reflecting sunlight away from the Earth via insertion of various materials in the upper stratosphere, low earth orbit, and {{L1}} locations.&lt;ref name="Teller1997"&gt;{{Cite journal

See pages 10-14 in particular. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By modifying the albedo of the Earth's surface, or by preventing sunlight reaching the Earth by using a [[solar shade]], the sun's warming effect can be cancelled out—although the cancellation is imperfect, with regional discrepancies remaining.&lt;ref name="royal_society"&gt;{{cite book

SRM or albedo modification, is considered to be a potential option for addressing [[climate change]]. As the [[National Academy of Sciences]] states in its 2015 report: "The two main options for responding to the risks of climate change involve mitigation—reducing and eventually eliminating human-caused emissions of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and other greenhouse gases (GHGs)—and adaptation—reducing the vulnerability of human and natural systems to changes in climate. A third potentially viable option, currently under development but not yet widely deployed, is [[carbon dioxide removal]] (CDR) from the atmosphere accompanied by reliable sequestration. A fourth, more speculative family of approaches called albedo modification seeks to offset climate warming by greenhouse gases by increasing the amount of sunlight reflected back to space."&lt;ref name="nap.edu"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Climate Intervention: Reflecting Sunlight to Cool Earth {{!}} The National Academies Press|url = http://www.nap.edu/catalog/18988/climate-intervention-reflecting-sunlight-to-cool-earth|website = www.nap.edu|accessdate = 2015-09-11|isbn = 9780309314824|date = 2015-02-10|last1 = Council|first1 = National Research|last2 = Impacts|first2 = Committee on Geoengineering Climate: Technical Evaluation Discussion of|last3 = Division On Earth And Life Studies|first3 = National Research Council (U.S.)|last4 = Ocean Studies Board|first4 = National Research Council (U.S.)|last5 = Climate|first5 = Board on Atmospheric Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, solar radiation management is widely viewed as a complement, not a substitute, to climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts. As The Royal Society concluded in its 2009 report: "Geoengineering methods are not a substitute for climate change mitigation, and should only be considered as part of a wider package of options for addressing climate change."&lt;ref name="The Royal Society"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Royal Society|url = https://royalsociety.org/~/media/Royal_Society_Content/policy/publications/2009/8693.pdf|website = royalsociety.org|accessdate = 2015-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Or put another way: "The safest and most predictable method of moderating climate change is to take early and effective action to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. No geoengineering method can provide an easy or readily acceptable alternative solution to the problem of climate change. Geoengineering methods could, however, potentially be useful in future to augment continuing efforts to mitigate climate change by reducing emissions, and so should be subject to more detailed research and analysis."&lt;ref name="The Royal Society" /&gt;

By intentionally changing the Earth's [[albedo]], or reflectivity, scientists propose that we could reflect more heat back out into space. We could also intercept sunlight before it reaches the Earth through a literal shade built in space. The effects are uncertain but it has been suggested that 2% albedo increase would roughly halve the effect of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; doubling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Royal Society|url = https://royalsociety.org/~/media/Royal_Society_Content/policy/publications/2009/8693.pdf|website = royalsociety.org|accessdate = 2015-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Academy of Sciences]] describes several of the potential benefits and risks of solar radiation management: "Modeling studies have shown that large amounts of cooling, equivalent in scale to the predicted warming due to doubling the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration in the atmosphere, can be produced by the introduction of tens of millions of tons of aerosols into the stratosphere. ... Preliminary modeling results suggest that albedo modification may be able to counter many of the damaging effects of high greenhouse gas concentrations on temperature and the hydrological cycle and reduce some impacts to sea ice. Models also strongly suggest that the benefits and risks will not be uniformly distributed around the globe."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Climate Intervention: Reflecting Sunlight to Cool Earth {{!}} The National Academies Press|url = http://www.nap.edu/catalog/18988/climate-intervention-reflecting-sunlight-to-cool-earth|website = www.nap.edu|accessdate = 2015-09-14|isbn = 9780309314824|date = 2015-02-10|last1 = Council|first1 = National Research|last2 = Impacts|first2 = Committee on Geoengineering Climate: Technical Evaluation Discussion of|last3 = Division On Earth And Life Studies|first3 = National Research Council (U.S.)|last4 = Ocean Studies Board|first4 = National Research Council (U.S.)|last5 = Climate|first5 = Board on Atmospheric Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The applicability of many techniques listed here has not been comprehensively tested.

Various small-scale experiments have been carried out on techniques such as [[cloud seeding]], increasing the volume of stratospheric sulfate aerosols and implementing [[cool roof]] technology.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

SRM has been suggested to control regional climate,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bernstein | first1 = D. N. | last2 = Neelin | first2 = J. D. | last3 = Li | first3 = Q.

SRM projects could, for example, be used as a temporary response while levels of greenhouse gases can be brought under control{{according to whom|date=March 2017}} by greenhouse gas remediation techniques but would not reduce [[greenhouse gas]] concentrations in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], and thus not address problems such as [[ocean acidification]] caused by excess [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

== Advantages ==
Solar radiation management has certain advantages relative to emissions cuts, adaptation, and carbon dioxide removal. Its effect of counteracting climate change would be experienced very rapidly, on the order of months after implementation,&lt;ref name="nap.edu" /&gt; whereas the effects of emissions cuts and carbon dioxide removal are delayed because the [[Climate inertia|climate change that they prevent is itself delayed]]. Some proposed solar radiation management techniques are expected to have very low direct financial costs of implementation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moriyama|first=Ryo|last2=Sugiyama|first2=Masahiro|last3=Kurosawa|first3=Atsushi|last4=Masuda|first4=Kooiti|last5=Tsuzuki|first5=Kazuhiro|last6=Ishimoto|first6=Yuki|date=2016-09-08|title=The cost of stratospheric climate engineering revisited|journal=Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change|volume=22|issue=8|language=en|pages=1207–1228|doi=10.1007/s11027-016-9723-y|issn=1381-2386}}&lt;/ref&gt; relative to the expected costs of both unabated climate change and aggressive mitigation. This creates a different problem structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barrett|first=Scott|date=2008-01-01|title=The Incredible Economics of Geoengineering|journal=Environmental and Resource Economics|language=en|volume=39|issue=1|pages=45–54|doi=10.1007/s10640-007-9174-8|issn=0924-6460}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weitzman|first=Martin L.|date=14 July 2015|title=A Voting Architecture for the Governance of Free-Driver Externalities, with Application to Geoengineering|journal=The Scandinavian Journal of Economics|volume=117|issue=4|pages=1049–1068|doi=10.1111/sjoe.12120|url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:17368469}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the provision of emissions reduction and carbon dioxide removal present [[collective action problems]] (because ensuring a lower atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration is a [[public good]]), a single countries or a handful of countries could implement solar radiation management. Finally, the direct climatic effects of solar radiation management are reversible on short timescales.&lt;ref name="nap.edu" /&gt;

==Limitations and risks==
As well as the imperfect cancellation of the climatic effect of greenhouse gases,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s10584-011-0103-z|title=A simple model to account for regional inequalities in the effectiveness of solar radiation management|journal=Climatic Change|volume=110|issue=3–4|pages=649|year=2011|last1=Moreno-Cruz|first1=Juan B.|last2=Ricke|first2=Katharine L.|last3=Keith|first3=David W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are other significant problems with solar radiation management as a form of climate engineering. SRM is temporary in its effect, and thus and long-term restoration of the climate would rely on long-term SRM, unless [[carbon dioxide removal]] was subsequently used. However, short-term SRM programs are potentially beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/nclimate2493|title=A temporary, moderate and responsive scenario for solar geoengineering|journal=Nature Climate Change|volume=5|issue=3|pages=201|year=2015|last1=Keith|first1=David W.|last2=MacMartin|first2=Douglas G.|bibcode=2015NatCC...5..201K|url=https://authors.library.caltech.edu/56537/2/nclimate2493-s1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Incomplete solution to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions ===
Solar radiation management does not [[Greenhouse gas removal|remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere]] and thus does not reduce other effects from these gases, such as [[ocean acidification]].&lt;ref&gt;http://infohost.nmt.edu/~chem/wingenter/Wingenter_PeECE_III_GRL_2007.pdf  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214164046/http://infohost.nmt.edu/~chem/wingenter/Wingenter_PeECE_III_GRL_2007.pdf |date=14 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While not an argument against solar radiation management ''per se'', this is an argument against reliance on climate engineering to the exclusion of greenhouse gas reduction.

=== Control and predictability ===
Most of the information on solar radiation management is from models and computer simulations. The actual results may differ from the predicted effect. The full effects of various solar radiation management proposals are not yet well understood.&lt;ref name="mongabay2007"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://news.mongabay.com/2007/0627-planktos.html|title = WWF condemns iron fertilization scheme to fight global warming|publisher = News.mongabay.com|date = December 2012|accessdate = 2012-09-06|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121024114948/http://news.mongabay.com/2007/0627-planktos.html|archivedate = 24 October 2012|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be difficult to predict the ultimate effects of projects,&lt;ref name="Keith Bower 2006, pp. 328"&gt;Keith Bower et al., 2006 Computational assessment of a proposed technique for global warming mitigation via albedo-enhancement of marine stratocumulus clouds.

Furthermore, most modeling to date consider the effects of using solar radiation management to fully counteract the increase in global average surface temperature arising from a doubling or a quadrupling of the preindustrial carbon dioxide concentration. Under these assumptions, it overcompensates for the changes in precipitation from climate change. Solar radiation management is more likely to be optimized in a way that balances counteracting changes to temperature and precipitation, to compensate for some portion of climate change, and/or to slow down the rate of climate change.

=== Side effects ===
There may be unintended climatic consequences of solar radiation management, such as significant changes to the [[hydrological cycle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first1 = G.|last1 = Bala|last2 = Duffy|first2 = B.|last3 = Taylor|first3 = E.|title = Impact of geoengineering schemes on the global hydrological cycle|format = Free full text|journal = [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]]|url = http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=18505844|volume = 105|issue = 22|pages = 7664–7669|date = June 2008|issn = 0027-8424|pmid = 18505844|pmc = 2409412|doi = 10.1073/pnas.0711648105|bibcode = 2008PNAS..105.7664B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Tilmes | first1 = S. | last2 = Fasullo | first2 = J. | last3 = Lamarque | first3 = J.

=== Termination shock ===
If solar radiation management were masking a significant amount of warming and then were to abruptly stop, the climate would rapidly warm.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1088/1748-9326/4/4/045103|title = Climate engineering and the risk of rapid climate change|year = 2009|last1 = Ross|first1 = A.|last2 = Damon Matthews|first2 = H.|journal = [[Environmental Research Letters]]|volume = 4|issue = 4|pages = 045103|bibcode = 2009ERL.....4d5103R}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would cause a sudden rise in global temperatures towards levels which would have existed without the use of the climate engineering technique. The rapid rise in temperature may lead to more severe consequences than a gradual rise of the same magnitude.

=== Disagreement ===
Leaders of countries and other actors may disagree as to whether, how, and to what degree solar radiation would be used, which could exacerbate international tensions.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

=== Weaponization ===
In 1976, 85 countries signed the U.N. Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques.&lt;ref name="benefits_risks_costs2"&gt;[[Alan Robock|Robock, A.]], A. Marquardt, B.

However, this does not eliminate the risk. If perfected to a degree of controllability and accuracy that is not considered possible at the moment, climate engineering techniques could theoretically be used by militaries to cause droughts or famines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=4146|title = Battlefield Earth|publisher = Foreign Policy|accessdate = 2012-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretically they could also be used simply to make battlefield conditions more favourable to one side or the other in a war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.fas.org/spp/military/docops/usaf/2025/v3c15/v3c15-1.htm|title = AF2025 v3c15-1 &amp;#124; Weather as a Force Multiplier: Owning... &amp;#124; (Ch 1)|publisher = Fas.org|accessdate = 2012-09-06|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120729204936/http://www.fas.org/spp/military/docops/usaf/2025/v3c15/v3c15-1.htm|archivedate = 29 July 2012|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Injecting reflective aerosols into the stratosphere is the proposed solar radiation management method that has received the most sustained attention. This technique could give much more than 3.7&amp;nbsp;W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of globally averaged negative forcing,&lt;ref name="atmos-chem-phys-discuss.net"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lenton, T.

Sulfates are the most commonly proposed aerosols for climate engineering, since there is a good natural analogue with (and evidence from) volcanic eruptions. Explosive volcanic eruptions inject large amounts of sulfur dioxide gas into the stratosphere, which form sulfate aerosol and [[Volcanic winter|cool the planet]].

which is sufficient to reverse the warming effect of a doubling of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

====Ocean sulfur cycle enhancement====
{{Main|Ocean fertilization}}
Enhancing the natural marine [[sulfur cycle]] by fertilizing a small portion with [[iron]]—typically considered to be a [[greenhouse gas remediation]] method—may also increase the reflection of sunlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Changing concentrations of CO, CH4, C5H8, CH3Br, CH3I, and dimethyl sulfide during the Southern Ocean Iron Enrichment Experiments|url = http://www.pnas.org/content/101/23/8537|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date = 2004-06-08|issn = 0027-8424|pmc = 423229|pmid = 15173582|pages = 8537–8541|volume = 101|issue = 23|doi = 10.1073/pnas.0402744101|language = en|first = Oliver W.|last = Wingenter|first2 = Karl B.|last2 = Haase|first3 = Peter|last3 = Strutton|first4 = Gernot|last4 = Friederich|first5 = Simone|last5 = Meinardi|first6 = Donald R.|last6 = Blake|first7 = F.

This could potentially be used as regional solar radiation management, to slow [[Antarctic]] ice from melting. Such techniques also tend to sequester carbon, but the enhancement of cloud albedo also appears to be a likely effect.

===Terrestrial===

====Cool roof====
[[File:Roof-albedo.gif|frame|The [[albedo]] of several types of roofs]]
{{Main|Reflective_surfaces_(climate_engineering)}}
Painting roof materials in white or pale colours to reflect solar radiation, known as '[[cool roof]]' technology, is encouraged by legislation in some areas (notably California).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/2008publications/CEC-999-2008-020/CEC-999-2008-020.PDF |title=Global Cooling: Increasing World-wide Urban Albedos to Offset CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; |author=Hashem Akbari|year=2008 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique is limited in its ultimate effectiveness by the constrained surface area available for treatment. This technique can give between 0.01-0.19&amp;nbsp;W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of globally averaged negative forcing, depending on whether cities or all settlements are so treated.&lt;ref name="atmos-chem-phys-discuss.net"/&gt; This is small relative to the 3.7&amp;nbsp;W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of positive forcing from a doubling of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Moreover, while in small cases it can be achieved at little or no cost by simply selecting different materials, it can be costly if implemented on a larger scale. A 2009 Royal Society report states that, "the overall cost of a 'white roof method' covering an area of 1% of the land surface (about 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) would be about $300 billion/yr, making this one of the least effective and most expensive methods considered."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Royal Society|url = https://royalsociety.org/~/media/Royal_Society_Content/policy/publications/2009/8693.pdf|website = royalsociety.org|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it can reduce the need for [[air conditioning]], which emits CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and contributes to global warming.

====Reflective sheeting====

However, the effect would be strongly regional, and would not be ideal for controlling [[Arctic shrinkage]], which is one of the most significant problems resulting from global warming. Furthermore, desert albedo modification would be expensive, would compete with other land uses, and would have strongly negative ecological consequences.&lt;ref name="The Royal Society" /&gt; Finally, the total area required during 2010-70 is larger than all non-polar deserts combined.

====Ocean changes====
Oceanic foams have also been suggested,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| pmc = | doi = 10.3354/cr00885 | pmid =   | last1 = Evans | first1 = J. | last2 = Stride | first2 = E. | last3 = Edirisinghe | first3 = M. | last4 = Andrews | first4 = D. | last5 = Simons | first5 = R. | title = Can oceanic foams limit global warming? | journal = Climate Research | volume = 42 | issue = 2 | pages = 155–160 | year = 2010 | bibcode = 2010ClRes..42..155E }}&lt;/ref&gt; using microscopic bubbles suspended in the upper layers of the [[photic zone]].

==== Forestry ====
[[Reforestation]] in [[tropical]] areas has a cooling effect. [[Deforestation]] of high-[[latitude]] and high-[[altitude]] forests exposes [[snow]] and this increases [[albedo]].&lt;ref name="carbonplanet"&gt;[http://www.carbonplanet.com/downloads/Climate_Effects_of_Forests_Full.pdf] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121133842/http://www.carbonplanet.com/downloads/Climate_Effects_of_Forests_Full.pdf |date=21 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Space-based ===
Space-based climate engineering projects ([[space sunshade]])s are seen by many commentators and scientists as being very expensive and technically difficult, with the [[Royal Society]] suggesting that "the costs of setting in place such a space-based armada for the relatively short period that SRM geoengineering may be considered applicable (decades rather than centuries) would likely make it uncompetitive with other SRM approaches."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Royal Society|url = https://royalsociety.org/~/media/Royal_Society_Content/policy/publications/2009/8693.pdf|website = royalsociety.org|accessdate = 2015-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mining moon dust to create a shielding cloud was proposed by Curtis Struck at [[Iowa State University]] in [[Ames, Iowa|Ames]].&lt;ref&gt;Journal of the British Interplanetary Society, vol 60, p 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Roger Angel |author2=S.

==== Dispersive solutions ====
[[File:Space lens.png|thumb|right|300px|The basic function of a space lens to mitigate global warming. In reality, a 1000 kilometre diameter lens is enough, much smaller than what is shown in the simplified image. In addition, as a [[Fresnel lens]] it would only be a few millimeters thick.]]
Several authors have proposed dispersing light before it reaches the Earth by putting a very large [[diffraction grating]] (thin wire mesh) or [[lens (optics)|lens]] in space, perhaps at the [[Inner lagrangian point|L1]] point between the Earth and the Sun. Using a Fresnel lens in this manner was proposed in 1989 by J. T. Early.&lt;ref name="Early"&gt;{{Cite news |author= J. T. Early |title= Space-Based Solar Shield To Offset Greenhouse Effect |year= 1989 |periodical= Journal of the British Interplanetary Society |volume= 42 |pages= 567–569 |postscript=. }} This proposal is also discussed in footnote 23 of {{Cite journal |author=Edward Teller |author2=Roderick Hyde |author3= Lowell Wood |title= Global Warming and Ice Ages: Prospects for Physics-Based Modulation of Global Change |year= 1997 |format= PDF |publisher= Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory |url=https://e-reports-ext.llnl.gov/pdf/231636.pdf |accessdate= 21 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using a diffraction grating was proposed in 1997 by [[Edward Teller]], [[Lowell Wood]], and Roderick Hyde.&lt;ref name="Teller1997"/&gt; In 2004, physicist and science fiction author [[Gregory Benford]] calculated that a [[concave lens|concave]] rotating [[Fresnel lens]] 1000 kilometres across, yet only a few millimeters thick, floating in space at the {{L1}} point, would reduce the solar energy reaching the Earth by approximately 0.5% to 1%. He estimated that this would cost around [[United States dollar|US$]]10 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] up front, and another $10 billion in supportive cost during its lifespan.&lt;ref name="Benford1"&gt;See [http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2005/4/7/41932/19363 Russell Dovey, "Supervillainy: Astroengineering Global Warming] and [http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/Science-Fiction-News.asp?NewsNum=370 Bill Christensen, "Reduce Global Warming by Blocking Sunlight"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417153949/http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/Science-Fiction-News.asp?NewsNum=370 |date=17 April 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; One issue with implementing such a solution is the need to counteract the effects of the solar wind moving such megastructures out of position.

== Governance ==
Climate engineering poses several challenges in the context of governance because of issues of power and jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="benefits_risks_costs2"/&gt; Climate engineering as a climate change solution differs from other mitigation and adaptation strategies. Unlike a carbon trading system that would be focused on participation from multiple parties along with transparency, monitoring measures and compliance procedures; this is not necessarily required by climate engineering. Bengtsson&lt;ref&gt;Bengtsson, L. (2006) 'Geo-engineering to confine climate change: is it at all feasible?' Climatic Change 77: 229–234&lt;/ref&gt; (2006) argues that "the artificial release of sulphate aerosols is a commitment of at least several hundred years". Yet this is true only if a long-term deployment strategy is adopted. Under a short-term, temporary strategy, implementation would instead be limited to decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1038/nclimate2493| title=A temporary, moderate and responsive scenario for solar geoengineering| journal=Nature Climate Change| volume=5| issue=3| pages=201–206| year=2015| last1=Keith| first1=David W.| last2=MacMartin| first2=Douglas G.|url = https://authors.library.caltech.edu/56537/2/nclimate2493-s1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both cases, however, highlight the importance for a political framework that is sustainable enough to contain a multilateral commitment over such a long period and yet is flexible as the techniques innovate through time. There are many controversies surrounding this topic and hence, climate engineering has been made into a very political issue. Most discussions and debates are not about which climate engineering technique is better than the other, or which one is more economically and socially feasible. Discussions are broadly on who will have control over the deployment of climate engineering and under what governance regime the deployment can be monitored and supervised. This is especially important due to the regional variability of the effects of many climate engineering techniques, benefiting some countries while damaging others. The challenge posed by climate engineering is not how to get countries to do it. It is to address the fundamental question of who should decide whether and how climate engineering should be attempted – a problem of governance.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, S (2007) Why cooperate? The incentive to supply global public goods. Oxford University Press, Oxford&lt;/ref&gt;

Solar radiation management raises a number of governance challenges. [[David Keith (scientist)|David Keith]] argues that the cost is within the realm of small countries, large corporations, or even very wealthy individuals.&lt;ref name="Keith2"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://keith.seas.harvard.edu/papers/89.Keith.EngineeringThePlanet.e.pdf|format = PDF|title = Engineering the Planet|author = David Keith|accessdate = 2008-04-08|pages = "3–4,8"}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Victor suggests that climate engineering is within the reach of a lone "Greenfinger," a wealthy individual who takes it upon him or herself to be the "self-appointed protector of the planet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = [[Oxford Review of Economic Policy]]|year = 2008|volume = 24|issue = 2|pages = 322–336|doi = 10.1093/oxrep/grn018|title = On the regulation of geoengineering|author = [[David G.

Legal and regulatory systems may face a significant challenge in effectively regulating solar radiation management in a manner that allows for an acceptable result for society. There are, however, significant incentives for states to cooperate in choosing a specific climate engineering policy, which make unilateral deployment a rather unlikely event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Stanford J Law Sci Policy|year = 2011|issue = 2|pages = 56–69|title = Geoengineering and the myth of unilateralism: pressures and prospects for international cooperation|author = Joshua Horton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers have suggested that building a global agreement on climate engineering deployment will be very difficult, and instead power blocs are likely to emerge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1 = Ricke|first1 = K. L.|last2 = Moreno-Cruz|first2 = J.

==Public attitudes==
There have been a handful of studies into attitudes to and opinions of solar radiation management.

One cited objection to implementing a short-term temperature fix is that there might then be less incentive to reduce carbon dioxide emissions until it caused some other environmental catastrophe, such as a [[Ocean acidification|chemical change in ocean water]] that could be disastrous to [[Marine biology|ocean life]].&lt;ref name="Benford2"&gt;[[Gregory Benford]] (Comments at the [[64th World Science Fiction Convention]], August 2006.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;div style="float:right"&gt;

'''Spaced Learning''' is a learning method in which highly condensed learning content is repeated three times, with two 10-minute breaks during which distractor activities such as physical activities are performed by the students.  It is based on the temporal pattern of stimuli for creating long-term memories reported by R. Douglas Fields in ''[[Scientific American]]'' in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=R.Douglas Fields|title=Making Memories Stick|publisher=[[Scientific American]]|date=February 2005|pages=58–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This 'temporal code' Fields used in his experiments was developed into a learning method for creating long-term memories by Paul Kelley, who led a team of teachers and scientists as reported in ''Making Minds''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Paul Kelley|title=Making Minds: What's wrong with education- and what should we do about it?|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-41411-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2008.

A paper on the method has been published in ''Frontiers in Human Neuroscience''.&lt;ref&gt;''Frontiers in Human Neuroscience&lt;http://www.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00589/abstract''&lt;/ref&gt;  This makes a substantial scientific case for this approach to learning based on research over many years in different species.  The distinctive features of the approach are made clear: the speed of instruction being minutes (as opposed to hours, days or months), the spaces and their function, and why content is repeated three times. Spaced learning has been reported in other species as being required for long-term memory creation, a finding that gives considerable weight to its use in education.

== Background ==
Spaced Learning had been developed by Kelley and his team over years and rather confusingly was not called 'Spaced Learning' at first.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|title=A sixth of a GCSE in 60 minutes?|author=Patrick Barkham|date=13 Feb 2009|pages=G2 4–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Earlier descriptions of Spaced Learning often led to its being misunderstood, and the scientific origins of the approach ignored. When the initial reports of outcomes were made public, media seized upon the condensed learning content as the key element in the approach used and the BBC national television news, ''The Sunday Times, The Independent,'' and ''The Economist''&lt;ref&gt;''The Sunday Times'', 15 July 2007;''The Independent'', 15 September 2007; and ''The Economist'', 2 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; reported the approach largely in those terms ('8 minute lessons'). This emphasis was misplaced, since Spaced Learning as a method depends on the length and number of the spaces (Fields' 'temporal code'), not the content presentation (which can vary).  However, this misunderstanding was also included in reports in the educational press, notably ''The Times Educational Supplement''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times Educational Supplement'', 29 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The description of the approach as 'Spaced Learning', clarifying the importance of the spaces, only appeared later.  Additional research reported in ''The Times Educational Supplement'', ''The Guardian'', ''The Times'', and ''The Daily Telegraph'' on 30 January 2009 reported that Spaced Learning successfully prepared students for a national examination in less than two hours with no traditional teaching at all.

The use of the term 'spaced' reflects the distinction in other research between 'spaced training' and 'massed training' where there have been conflicting results reported (for example, see [[spaced repetition]]). [[Spaced retrieval]] practice- trying to recover long-term memories quickly and accurately- is the subject of a different line of research but also shows that spaced practice (for example, taking a practice test every month) is more effective that massed practice.

The significance of Spaced Learning may prove important in different ways:
#as a demonstration that neuroscience is now producing outcomes that can be directly implemented in education- as asserted by Kelley.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kelley, ''Making Minds: What's wrong with education- and what should we do about it?'', Routledge, London / New York,150-4&lt;/ref&gt;  This seems established now through the academic paper in ''Frontiers in Human Neuroscience''
#as a demonstration that primary neuroscientific research can demonstrate processes that have not been used in formal education, yet are of fundamental importance in the learning process

In [[chronostratigraphy]], a '''stage''' is a [[Geologic record|succession of rock strata]] laid down in a single [[Age (geology)|age]] on the [[geologic timescale]], which usually represents millions of years of deposition.  A given stage of rock and the corresponding age of time will by convention have the same name, and the same boundaries.

Rock [[Series (geology)|series]] are divided into stages, just as geological epochs are divided into ages.  Stages can be divided into smaller stratigraphic units called [[chronozone]]s.  (See chart at right for full terminology hierarchy.) Stages may also be divided into substages or indeed grouped as superstages.&lt;ref&gt;http://stratigraphy.org/upload/bak/chron.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''faunal stage''' is sometimes used, referring to the fact that the same [[fauna]] (animals) are found throughout the layer (by definition).

==Definition==

Stages are primarily defined by a consistent set of fossils ([[biostratigraphy]]) or a consistent magnetic polarity (see [[paleomagnetism]]) in the rock. Usually one or more [[index fossil]]s that are common, found worldwide, easily recognized, and limited to a single, or at most a few, stages are used to define the stage's bottom. 

Thus, for example in the local North American subdivision, a paleontologist finding fragments of the [[trilobite]] ''Olenellus'' would identify the beds as being from the [[Waucoban Stage]] whereas fragments of a later trilobite such as ''Elrathia'' would identify the stage as [[Albertan Stage|Albertan]]. 

Stages were important in the 19th and early 20th centuries as they were the major tool available for dating and correlating rock units prior to the development of [[seismology]] and [[radioactive dating]] in the second half of the 20th Century. Microscopic analysis of the rock ([[petrology]]) is also sometimes useful in confirming that a given segment of rock is from a particular age.

Originally, faunal stages were only defined regionally; however as additional stratigraphic and geochonologic tools, were developed, stages were defined over broader and broader areas. More recently, the adjective "faunal" has been dropped as regional and global correlations of rock sequences have become relatively certain and there is less need for faunal labels to define the age of formations. A tendency developed to use European and, to a lesser extent, Asian, stage names for the same time period worldwide, even though the faunas in other regions often had little in common with the stage as originally defined.

==International standardization==
{{Update|section|date=August 2014}}
Boundaries and names are established by the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]] (ICS) of the [[International Union of Geological Sciences]].  As of 2008, the ICS is nearly finished a task begun in 1974, subdividing the [[Phanerozoic]] [[eonothem]] into internationally accepted stages using two types of benchmark.  For younger stages, a [[Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point]] (GSSP), a physical [[outcrop]] clearly demonstrates the boundary.  For older stages, a [[Global Standard Stratigraphic Age]] (GSSA) is an absolute date. The benchmarks will give a much greater certainty that results can be compared with confidence in the date determinations, and such results will have farther scope than any evaluation based solely on local knowledge and conditions. 

In many regions local subdivisions and classification criteria are still used along with the newer internationally coordinated uniform system, but once the research establishes a more complete international system, it is expected that local systems will be abandoned.

==Stages and lithostratigraphy==
Stages can include many [[lithostratigraphy|lithostratigraphic]] units (for example [[formation (geology)|formations]], [[bed (geology)|beds]], [[member (geology)|members]], etc.) of differing rock types that were being laid down in different environments at the same time. In the same way, a lithostratigraphic unit can include a number of stages or parts of them.

[[Image:Kronobageriet Stockholm Sibylle Riddar 20060524.jpg|thumb|Stockholm Music Museum]]
'''The Stockholm Music Museum''' was founded in 1899 (then named ”Musikhistoriska museet”), inspired by an exhibition of theatre and music which was part of the great [[Stockholm]] art and industry exhibition of 1897. Via donations and appeals for gifts around 200 [[musical instrument]]s and an amount of archive material concerning the history of music and theatre were gathered. The new museum was opened to the general public in 1901. In 1932 the museum, in the form of a trust, was associated with the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Music]] and received a state grant. The state became increasingly responsible for the museum, which in 1981 became part of a new public body–The Swedish National Collections of Music. At the same time the museum was renamed The Stockholm Music Museum (Musikmuseet), since its activities had broadened and changed in character.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musikmuseet.se/ommuseet/index.php?l=en&amp;mmcss=&amp;oid=2&amp;niv=2&amp;ommu_open=1 Musikmuseet&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The present collection encompasses approximately 5,500 instruments with an emphasis on [[Western art music]], and [[Nordic folk music|Scandinavian folk music]] instruments. 

Since 1979 the Stockholm Music Museum is located in the splendid former Crown Bakery, in the same quarter as the Court Stables, beside the [[Royal Dramatic Theatre]], in central Stockholm. The Crown Bakery dates from the 17th century, and is Stockholm’s oldest industrial building.

[[Image:Konsertsal, Musik- och teatermuseet, Stockholm.JPG|thumb|upright|Concert Hall]]
This building has a long and eventful history and has through the centuries performed a number of functions: bakery, weapon depot, spirits store. Yet almost all the time—from the 1640s to 1958—it has been a bakery for the armed forces in Stockholm. It even boasted mobile ovens which could be used during field exercises. In 1945 the building was ravaged by a fire which destroyed its upper floors in the northern part–where the Concert Hall is now located.

A large portion of the museum's instrument collection is viewable on the museum's webpage, and will from 2010 onwards, be available through the EU's europeana culture webportal: www.europeana.eu

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6361">"'''The Complexity of Songs'''" is a journal article published by [[computer scientist]] [[Donald Knuth]] in 1977,&lt;ref name=knu /&gt; as an [[in-joke]] about [[computational complexity theory]]. The article capitalizes on the tendency of popular [[song]]s to devolve from long and content-rich [[ballad]]s to highly repetitive texts with little or no meaningful content.&lt;ref name=redux&gt;Steven Krantz (2005) "Mathematical Apocrypha Redux", {{ISBN|0-88385-554-2}}, pp.2, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The article notes how some songs can reach a complexity level, for a song of length ''N'' words, as formula: {{nowrap|[[Big O notation|O]]([[logarithm|log]] ''N'')}}. The gist of the article is repeated below, maintaining the wit of the key concepts.

== Article summary ==
Knuth writes that "our ancient ancestors invented the concept of [[refrain]]" to reduce the [[space complexity]] of songs, which becomes crucial when a large number of songs is to be committed to one's [[memory]]. Knuth's [[Lemma (mathematics)|Lemma]] 1 states that if ''N'' is the length of a song, then the refrain decreases the song complexity to ''cN'', where the factor&amp;nbsp;''c''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;ref name="knu"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Knuth | first=Donald | title=The Complexity of Songs | journal=SIGACT News | date=Summer 1977 | pages=17–24}}
Reprinted in: {{cite journal | last=Knuth | first=Donald | title=The Complexity of Songs | journal=[[Communications of the ACM]] | year=1984 | volume=27 | issue=4 | pages=344–346 | doi=10.1145/358027.358042 | mr=784131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knuth further demonstrates a way of producing songs with [[Big O notation|O]](&lt;math&gt;\sqrt N&lt;/math&gt;) complexity, an approach "further improved by a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] farmer named [[Old McDonald Had a Farm|O. MacDonald]]".&lt;ref name=knu /&gt;

More ingenious approaches yield songs of complexity [[Big O notation|O]](&lt;math&gt;\log N&lt;/math&gt;), a class known as "[[99_Bottles_of_Beer#References_in_computer_science|''m'' bottles of beer on the wall]]".

Finally, the progress during the 20th century—stimulated by the fact that "the advent of modern drugs has led to demands for still less memory"—leads to the ultimate improvement: Arbitrarily long songs with space complexity [[Big O notation|O]](1), e.g. for a song to be defined by the [[recurrence relation]]&lt;ref name=knu /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;S_0=\epsilon, S_k = V_kS_{k-1},\, k\ge 1,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V_k =&lt;/math&gt; '[[That's the Way (I Like It)|That's the way]],' &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; 'I like it,' &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, for all &lt;math&gt; k \ge 1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;U=&lt;/math&gt; 'uh huh,' 'uh huh'

== Further developments ==
Prof. Kurt Eisemann of [[San Diego State University]] in his letter to the ''[[Communications of the ACM]]''&lt;ref name=kurt /&gt; further improves the latter seemingly unbeatable estimate. He begins with an observation that for practical applications the value of the "hidden constant" ''c'' in the [[Big Oh]] notation may be crucial in making the difference between the feasibility and unfeasibility: for example a constant  value of 10&lt;sup&gt;80&lt;/sup&gt; would exceed the capacity of any known device. He further notices that a technique has already been known in [[Mediaeval Europe]] whereby textual content of an arbitrary tune can be recorded basing on the recurrence relation &lt;math&gt;S_k = C_2S_{k-1}&lt;/math&gt;, where  &lt;math&gt;C_2 = 'la'&lt;/math&gt;, yielding the value of the big-Oh constant ''c'' equal to 2. However it turns out that another culture achieved the absolute lower bound of O(0). As Prof. Eisemann puts it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"When the ''Mayflower'' voyagers first descended on these shores, the native Americans proud of their achievement in the theory of information storage and retrieval, at first welcomed the strangers with the complete silence. This was meant to convey their peak achievement in the complexity of songs, namely the demonstration that a limit as low as ''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 is indeed obtainable."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However the Europeans were unprepared to grasp this notion, and the [[Indian chief|chiefs]], in order to establish a common ground to convey their achievements later proceeded to demonstrate an approach described by the recurrent relation &lt;math&gt;S_k = C_1S_{k-1}&lt;/math&gt;, where  &lt;math&gt;C_1 = 'i'&lt;/math&gt;, with a suboptimal complexity given by ''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;ref name=redux /&gt;&lt;ref name=kurt&gt;Kurt Eisemann, "Further Results on the Complexity of Songs", ''Communications of the ACM'', vol 28 (1985), no. 3, p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt;

The O(1) space complexity result was also implemented by [[Guy L. Steele, Jr.]], perhaps challenged by Knuth's article.&lt;ref&gt;Peter G. Neumann, "A further view of the first quarter century" ,''Communications of the ACM'', Volume 27, Issue 4, April 1984, p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Steele's  ''[[TELNET]] Song'' used a completely different algorithm based on exponential recursion, a parody on some implementations of TELNET.&lt;ref&gt;[[Guy L. Steele, Jr.]], "The Telnet Song", ''[[Communications of the ACM]]'', April 1984&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poppyfields.net/filks/00222.html Text of the TELNET Song] (retrieved January 5, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eskimo.com/~nickz/dec/telnet-song.mid Telnet song in MIDI format]&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that the complexity analysis of human songs can be a useful pedagogic device for teaching students complexity theory.&lt;ref name=Chavey1996&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chavey|first=Darrah|title=Songs and the analysis of algorithms|journal=SIGCSE '96|year=1996|pages=4–8|doi=10.1145/236452.236475|url=http://dl2.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=236475&amp;CFID=248220371&amp;CFTOKEN=72224448|accessdate=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The article "On Superpolylogarithmic [[subexponential time|Subexponential]] Functions" by Prof. [[Alan Sherman]]&lt;ref&gt;Alan Sherman, "On Superpolylogarithmic Subexponential Functions:, ''ACM SIGACT News'', vol. 22, no. 1, 1991, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; writes that Knuth's article was seminal for analysis of a special class of functions.

'''Theory of knowledge''' is a required subject in the [[International Baccalaureate]] Diploma Programme. It is similar to [[epistemology]] courses offered at many universities.

==Course description==
Theory of Knowledge is a course created by the IB organization and must not be conceived as pure epistemology. This course involves a process of exploring and sharing students' views on ''"knowledge questions"'' (an umbrella term for "everything that can be approached from a TOK point of view"), so "there is no end to the valid questions that may arise", "there are many different ways to approach TOK," "the sheer scope of the TOK course is daunting" and "teachers and students need the confidence to go too far outside their traditional comfort zones."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Theory of knowledge guide (first examinations 2008) |pages=3–4 |publisher=[[International Baccalaureate Organization]] |date=March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Teachers are entitled to select a teaching methodology and course material that will convey the theoretical foundation of essential concepts and may provide an environment in which these concepts can be discussed and debated. The focus of the discussion should not be the differentiation between "right" and "wrong" ideas but on the quality of justification and a balanced approach to the knowledge claim in question.

The TOK course uses a combination, in no particular order ("many entry points and sequences are possible"):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Theory of knowledge guide (first examinations 2008) |pages=6–35 |publisher=[[International Baccalaureate Organization]] |date=March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Ways of knowing'': ([[empiricism|sense perception]], [[reason]], [[emotion]], [[faith]], [[imagination]], [[intuition]], [[memory]], and [[language]]). How do we gain knowledge of the world, and what are the advantages and disadvantages of each way in which we learn of the world and our place in it. Until the fall of 2014, there were only four ways of knowing ([[empiricism|sense perception]], [[reason]], [[emotion]], and [[language]], but the IB curriculum then changed to include four other ways of knowing: [[intuition (psychology)|intuition]], [[imagination]], [[faith]], and [[memory]]).
* ''Areas of knowledge'' ([[mathematics]], [[natural sciences]], [[human sciences]], [[history]], [[religion|religious knowledge systems]], [[traditional knowledge|indigenous knowledge systems]], [[arts|the arts]] and [[ethics]]): their distinct natures and methods of gaining knowledge, the types of claim each makes and the issues to consider (e.g., "How do you know that the scientific method is a valid method of gaining knowledge?", "What is the reason for having historical knowledge, and how is it applied in life?"). The IB originally had six areas of knowledge: [[mathematics]], [[natural sciences]], [[human sciences]], [[history]], [[arts|the arts]] and [[ethics]]. In the fall of 2014, the IB curriculum changed to include two more areas of knowledge: [[religion|religious knowledge systems]] and [[traditional knowledge|indigenous knowledge systems]].
* Factors that transcend individual ways of knowing and areas of knowledge:
** ''Nature of knowing'': what are the differences between information, data, belief, faith, opinion, knowledge and wisdom?
** ''Knowledge communities'': what is taken for granted in a community? How can we decide which beliefs we ought to check further?
** ''Knowers' perspective and applications of knowledge'': how do age, education, culture and experience influence selection of sources and formation of knowledge claims? If you know something, or how to do something, do you have a responsibility to use your knowledge? By using different types of AOK ( Areas of knowledge ) and WOK ( Ways of knowing ) you can then start to write counterclaims and claims in different types of texts.

** ''[[Theory of justification|Justifications]] of knowledge claims'': why should claims be assessed critically? Are [[logic]], [[sensory perception]], [[revelation]], [[faith]], [[memory]], [[consensus]], [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]], and [[self-awareness]] equally reliable justifications? Use of [[coherence theory of truth|coherence]], [[correspondence theory of truth|correspondence]], [[pragmatism]], and [[consensus]] as [[criteria of truth]].

The TOK course is expected to involve 100 teaching hours over the two years of the Diploma Programme.&lt;ref name="TOK_Guide_p3"&gt;{{cite book |title=Theory of knowledge guide (first examinations 2008) |page=3 |publisher=[[International Baccalaureate Organization]] |date=March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having followed the course, students should be competent to analyse knowledge claims and respond to knowledge issues in the context of different areas of knowledge and ways of knowing, expressing ideas accurately and honestly, using examples from their own experiences as learners and in outside life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Theory of knowledge guide (first examinations 2008) |page=5 |publisher=[[International Baccalaureate Organization]] |date=March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Personal knowledge is the systematic assimilation of shared knowledge acquired in different areas of knowledge through a process that vary within disciplines.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theory of Knowledge Guide|last=|first=|publisher=International Baccalaureate Organization|year=2013|isbn=|location=Cardiff, Wales|pages=17-33}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Shared knowledge is the accumulation of bodies of knowledge in different areas of knowledge, the media and society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* The Knowledge Framework is a scheme that contains five elements: scope and application, language, methodology, historical development and links to personal knowledge.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Assessment==
Theory of knowledge is assessed in two parts: an externally examined 1,200–1,600 word essay and an internally assessed presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Theory of knowledge guide (first examinations 2008) |page=41 |publisher=[[International Baccalaureate Organization]] |date=March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each part is scored using assessment criteria (four criteria for the essay and four for the presentation) that describe levels of achievement (e.g., ''"The inquiry explores knowledge issues. Most points are justified; most arguments are coherent. Some counterclaims are considered."'' describes level 5–6 in one of the essay criteria). The total score is converted into a grade from A to E. A similar system is used for the [[extended essay]] and students can gain up to 3 points for the diploma based on the grades achieved for TOK and EE. No diploma is awarded if a candidate fails to submit either the TOK essay or TOK presentation, or receives grade E for either the extended essay or theory of knowledge.

===TOK essay===
For each exam session the IB prescribes 6 essay titles from which students must choose, e.g., ''"All knowledge claims should be open to rational criticism. On what grounds and to what extent would you agree with this assertion?"''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Core: Diploma requirements – 2 Theory of knowledge |title=2009 Handbook of procedures for the Diploma Program |publisher=ibo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each title raises generic cross-disciplinary questions about knowledge, and the student is expected to consider the issues raised in the title and reach conclusions about them. The essay should put forward claims and counterclaims, linking knowledge issues to areas of knowledge and ways of knowing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Theory of knowledge guide (first examinations 2008) |page=44 |publisher=[[International Baccalaureate Organization]] |date=March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and show evidence of original thinking by the student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibo.org/ibaem/news/helpassessment.cfm |title="Help" with IB assessment tasks |accessdate=2009-08-11 |publisher=ibo.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420133851/http://www.ibo.org/ibaem/news/helpassessment.cfm |archivedate=April 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Essays over the maximum word count of 1,600 are penalised with a one mark reduction, and any content beyond the 1600th word of the essay is not read by the examiner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://ibpublishing.ibo.org/exist/rest/app/tsm.xql?doc=d_0_tok_gui_1304_1_e&amp;part=3&amp;chapter=3|title= Assessment Details|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=March 2013 |website= Theory of Knowledge guide|publisher= [[International Baccalaureate Organization]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===TOK presentation===
During the Theory of Knowledge course, students must plan and deliver at least one (in individual or small group, maximum three students) presentation to the class. The topic is based on a real-life situation of interest to the student, e.g. "Reliability of media reporting of science", "What makes something a work of art?" and the presentation is expected to show why the topic is significant, linking it to a relevant main knowledge question (KQ), and discussing those issues and examining the implications of approaching the question from different perspectives, given by WOKs (ways of knowing), taken through one or two of the AOKs (Areas of knowledge). Teachers have wide latitude to help with topic selection and identifying suitable approaches. About ten minutes should be allowed for each presenter, and almost any form is permitted (e.g. debates, games, skits, interviews etc.) except reading an essay aloud. If a candidate reads an essay, they are very likely to fail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Theory of knowledge guide (first examinations 2008) |pages=46–50, 57–60 |publisher=[[International Baccalaureate Organization]] |date=March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://presentationexamples.org/tok-presentation-example/ | title= Theory of knowledge presentation: Tips and Pitfalls | work=presentationexamples.org |date= 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14403">'''Waddell's chronology''' or '''Waddell's king list''' is an [[Ancient Near East]]ern chronology developed by the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Laurence Waddell]] in his book, ''[[Egyptian Civilization: Its Sumerian Origin and Real Chronology]]'', published in 1930.&lt;ref name="Macnaughton1932"&gt;{{cite book|author=Duncan Macnaughton|title=A scheme of Egyptian chronology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pLYrAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=27 October 2012|year=1932|publisher=Luzac &amp; Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Preston2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christine Preston|title=The Rise of Man in the Gardens of Sumeria: A Biography of L.A.

Waddell's correllations have not been generally accepted or well regarded, in part due to his use of the word [[Aryan]]. Conventional lists separate [[Sargon of Akkad|Sargon]] from [[Menes]] by around five hundred years. Commenting on this and other works, the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' says "These works, containing much painstaking research and impressive to many, did not win the approval of experts."&lt;ref name="ArchBulletin"&gt;[http://www.archaeologybulletin.org/article/view/bha.20106/51 Moshenka, Gabriel., 'At Variance With Both General and Expert Opinion': The Later Works of Lieutenant-Colonel Professor Laurence Austine Waddell, Bulletin of the History of Archaeology, UCL Institute of Archaeology, 2010.] ({{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/6BjV5HK0i?url=http://www.archaeologybulletin.org/article/view/bha.20106/51 |date=October 27, 2012 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

Waddell's primary chronology was compiled from various [[Sumerian king list]]s, Egyptian [[list of pharaohs]], the [[Bhagavata Purana]], [[Mahabharata]], [[Rigveda]] and numerous [[Indus Valley Civilization]] seals and other monuments and relics and sources, some of which he had deciphered himself.&lt;ref name="Preston2009"/&gt; It was entitled "Dated Chronological List of [[Sumer]]ian or Early [[Aryan]] Kings from the Rise of Civilization to the [[Kassites|Kassi Dynasty]]" and documented an alleged list of [[Sacred king|world emperor]]s as follows:

The Zambia Forestry College (ZFC) was established in 1949 to provide technical training in forestry. In the same year it produced the first forest guards.

In the following year, Forest Rangers were trained. The College has since been growing to cope with the changing demand for natural resource trained staff. By 1963, over 300 Forest Rangers (Certificate holders) and Forest Guards had been trained.

Training for Foresters (Diploma holders) commenced in 1963 with nine (9) students.  By the end of 1977, 131 Foresters and one (1) female Forester completed her training successfully signifying that this field was gender friendly. The college has now been upgraded with equipment, facilities and staff.
