In philosophy, '''A series''' and '''B series''' are two different descriptions of the temporal ordering relation among [[Event (philosophy)|event]]s. The two series differ principally in their use of [[grammatical tense|tense]] to describe the temporal relation between events.  The terms were introduced by the Scottish [[idealism|idealist]] philosopher [[J. M. E. McTaggart|John McTaggart]] in 1908 as part of his argument for the unreality of time, but since then they have become widely used terms of reference in modern discussions of the [[philosophy of time]].

==McTaggart's use of the A series and B series==
According to McTaggart, there are two distinct modes in which all events can be ordered in time. In the first mode, events are ordered as [[future]], [[present]], and [[past]]. Futurity and pastness allow of degrees, while the present does not. When we speak of time in this way, we are speaking in terms of a series of positions which run from the remote past through the recent past to the present, and from the present through the near future all the way to the remote future. The essential characteristic of this descriptive modality is that one must think of the ''series of temporal positions'' as being in ''continual transformation'', in the sense that an event is first part of the future, then part of the present, and then past. Moreover, the assertions made according to this modality correspond to the temporal perspective of the person who utters them. This is the A series of temporal events. 

Although originally McTaggart defined tenses as relational qualities, i.e. qualities that events possess by standing in a certain relations to something outside of time, something that does not change its position in time&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Nature of Existence, Vol. II|last=McTaggart|first=J. M. E.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1927|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=§ 326|quote=It seems quite clear to me that [tenses] are not qualities but relations, though of course, like other relations, they will generate relational qualities in each of their terms}}&lt;/ref&gt;, then today it is popularly believed that he treated tenses as monadic properties. As R. D. Ingthorsson notes, this is probably because later philosophers have independently inferred that this is how McTaggart must have understood [[grammatical tense|tense]] merely because tenses are normally expressed in ordinary English by non-relational singular predicates "is past", "is present" and "is future".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=McTaggart's Paradox|last=Ingthorsson|first=R. D.|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=978-1-138-67724-1|location=New York|pages=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

From a second point of view, one can order [[event (philosophy)|events]] according to a different series of temporal positions by way of two-term relations which are [[asymmetry|asymmetric]], [[irreflexive]] and [[wikt:transitive|transitive]]: "earlier than" (or precedes) and "later than" (or follows). An important difference between the two series is that while events continuously change their position in the A series, their position in the B series does not. If an event ever is earlier than some events and later than the rest, it is always earlier than and later than those very events. Furthermore, while events acquire their A series determinations through a relation to something outside of time, their B series determinations hold between the events that constitutes the B series. This is the B series, and the philosophy which says all truths about time can be reduced to B series statements is the [[B-theory of time]].

The [[logic]] and the [[linguistic]] expression of the two series are radically different. The A series is ''tensed'' and the B series is ''tenseless''. For example, the assertion "today it is raining" is a tensed assertion because it depends on the temporal perspective—the present—of the person who utters it, while the assertion "It rained on {{date}}" is tenseless because it does not so depend. From the point of view of their [[truth-value]]s, the two propositions are identical (both true or both false) if the first assertion is made on {{date}}. The non-temporal relation of precedence between two events, say "E precedes F", does not change over time
(excluding from this discussion the issue of the relativity of temporal order of causally disconnected events in the theory of relativity). On the other hand, the character of being "past, present or future" of the events "E" or "F" does change with time. In the image of McTaggart the passage of time consists in the fact that terms ever further in the future pass into the present...or that the present advances toward terms ever farther in the future. If we assume the first point of view, we speak as if the B series slides along a fixed A series. If we assume the second point of view, we speak as if the A series slides along a fixed B series.

The debate between A-theorists and B-theorists is a continuation of a [[metaphysical]] dispute reaching back to the ancient Greek philosophers [[Heraclitus]] and [[Parmenides]]. Parmenides thought that [[reality]] is timeless and unchanging. Heraclitus, in contrast, believed that the world is a process of ceaseless [[change (philosophy)|change]], flux and decay. Reality for Heraclitus is dynamic and [[ephemeral]]. Indeed, the world is so fleeting, according to Heraclitus, that it is impossible to step twice into the same river. The metaphysical issues that continue to divide A-theorists and B-theorists concern the reality of the past, the reality of the future, and the [[ontological]] status of the present.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==Relation to other ideas in the philosophy of time==
There are two principal varieties of the A-theory, [[presentism (philosophy of time)|presentism]] and the [[growing block universe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fas-philosophy.rutgers.edu/zimmerman/Presentism%20and%20Rel.for.Web.2.pdf Presentism and the Space-Time Manifold] by Dean Zimmerman, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Both assume an objective present, but presentism assumes that only present objects exist, while the growing block universe assumes both present and past objects exist, but not future ones. Ideas that assume no objective present, like the B-theory, include [[Eternalism (philosophy of time)|eternalism]] and [[four-dimensionalism]].

An '''agent of influence''' is an agent of some stature who uses his or her position to [[Social influence|influence]] public opinion or decision making to produce results beneficial to the country whose intelligence service operates the agent.&lt;ref&gt;Mark L. Reagan, "DOD Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms," DTIC Online, May 2, 2011, "Agent of Influence, GL-4", accessed March 10, 2012, http://www.ncix.gov/publications/ci_references/CI_Glossary.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417211409/http://www.ncix.gov/publications/ci_references/CI_Glossary.pdf |date=2012-04-17 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Agents of influence are often the most difficult agents to detect, as there is seldom material evidence that connects them with a foreign power,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[[Richard H. Shultz]] and [[Roy Godson]], ''[[Dezinformatsia (book)|Dezinformatsia: Active Measures in Soviet Strategy]]'' (New York: Pergamon-Brassey's, 1984), pg. 132-133.&lt;/ref&gt; but they can be among the most effective means of influencing foreign opinion and actions as they hold considerable credibility among the target audience.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Robert K. George, An Historical Investigation of Soviet Strategic Deception, report no. 87-0955 (Maxwell AFB: Air Command and Staff College, 1987), pg. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Most commonly they serve the interests of a foreign power in one of three ways: either as a controlled agent directly recruited and controlled by a foreign power; as a "trusted contact" that consciously collaborates to advance foreign interests but are not directly recruited or controlled by a foreign power; or as a "[[useful idiot]]" that is completely unaware of how their actions further the interests of a foreign power.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard H. Shultz]] and [[Roy Godson]], ''[[Dezinformatsia (book)|Dezinformatsia: Active Measures in Soviet Strategy]]'' (New York: Pergamon-Brassey's, 1984), pg. 193-194.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "agent of influence" is often used to describe both individuals and organizations engaged in influence operations. Individuals engaged in this type of influence operation may serve in the fields of journalism, government, art, labor, academia, or a number of other professional fields.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;[[Richard H. Shultz]] and [[Roy Godson]], ''[[Dezinformatsia (book)|Dezinformatsia: Active Measures in Soviet Strategy]]'' (New York: Pergamon-Brassey's, 1984), pg. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural opinion makers, nationalists, and religious leaders have also been targeted to serve as individual agents of influence.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Anatoliy Golitsyn, New Lies for Old: The Communist Strategy of Deception and Disinformation (New York: Dodd, Mead, 1984), pg. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to individual agents of influence, front organizations can serve the interests of a foreign power in this capacity.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;Robert K. George, An Historical Investigation of Soviet Strategic Deception, report no. 87-0955 (Maxwell AFB: Air Command and Staff College, 1987), pg. 32-33.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Cold War examples of front organizations serving as agents of influence, focusing largely on the [[Soviet influence on the peace movement|Soviet side, were many "peace" groups]]: the [[Christian Peace Conference]], the [[International Organization of Journalists]], the [[World Federation of Scientific Workers]], the [[World Federation of Trade Unions]], the [[International Institute for Peace]], and the [[World Peace Council]].&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. CIA Study: Soviet Covert Action and Propaganda. Central Intelligence Agency, Washington D.C., 1980-02-06, p. IV-11.&lt;/ref&gt; When individuals join such organizations in good faith but are in fact serving the interests of a foreign elite, their affiliation becomes infiltration, and cumulatively the organization serves as an agent of influence.&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;Paul A. Smith, On Political War (Washington, DC: National Defense University Press, 1989), pg. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==U.S. government definitions==
*  An agent of some stature who uses his or her position to influence public opinion or decision making to produce results beneficial to the country whose intelligence service operates the agent (Air Force Office of Special Investigations Manual 71-142).&lt;ref name="auto6"&gt;Mark L. Reagan, "DOD Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms," DTIC Online, May 2, 2011, "Agent of Influence, GL-4", accessed March 10, 2012, http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/dod_dictionary/.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A person who is directed by an intelligence organization to use his or her position to influence public opinion or decision-making in a manner that will advance the objective of the country for which that organization operates (Counterintelligence Glossary—Terms &amp; Definitions of Interest for Department of Defense Counterintelligence Professionals).&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt;
* An individual who acts in the interest of an adversary without open declaration of allegiance and attempts to exercise influence covertly, but is not necessarily gathering intelligence or compromising classified material, is known as an agent of influence (Historical Dictionary of Cold War Counterintelligence).&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt;
* An agent operating under intelligence instructions who uses his or her officialdom or public position, and other means, to exert influence on policy, public opinion, the course of particular events, the activity of political organizations and state agencies in target countries (KGB Lexicon: The Soviet Intelligence Officer’s Handbook, edited by KGB archivist Vasiliy Mitrokhin).&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt;
* The Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) was enacted in 1938, and 22 U.S.Code § 611 et seq provides detailed definitions of what constitutes an agent of influence.&lt;ref&gt;The Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), Title 22 U.S.Code § 611 et seq (1938).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R15068, Leo Dawidowitsch Trotzki.jpg|thumb|125px|alt=text|Leon Trotsky, who popularized the term "fellow traveller" in 1924. Trotsky would state: "As regards a 'fellow-traveller', the question always comes up—how far will he go?"&lt;ref&gt;Leon Trotsky, "Chapter 2: The Literary 'Fellow-Travellers' of the Revolution", Leon Trotsky: Literature and Revolution, June 1, 2007, http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1924/lit_revo/ch02.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The primary characteristic that distinguishes agents of influence from spies is the lack of absolute control exercised by the foreign power on an agent of influence. According to [[Angelo Codevilla]], the work of an agent of influence "can be far more valuable, subtle, and dangerous than that of a mere spy".&lt;ref&gt;Angelo M. Codevilla, "Political Warfare: A Set of Means for Achieving Political Ends", in Waller, ed., Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda and Political Warfare (IWP Press, 2008), pg. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; As witnessed in the Cold War through "[[fellow travelers]]", the best agents of influence were those whose interests paralleled that of the aggressor's and needed little if any coordination.&lt;ref name="auto7"&gt;Angelo M. Codevilla, "Political Warfare: A Set of Means for Achieving Political Ends," in Waller, ed., Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda and Political Warfare (IWP Press, 2008), pg. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; A foreign power can rarely exercise complete control over an agent of influence, as these agents possess their own preferences and motivations; the most proven way to cultivate the desired results is for a foreign power to choose and develop an agent of influence whose interests already align with their own.&lt;ref name="auto7"/&gt; Overlooking an agent of influence's different motivations can have negative consequences, as witnessed in [[World War I]], when German political warfare strategists sent [[Vladimir Lenin]] back to St. Petersburg in an effort to foster domestic instability and get Russia out of the war in 1917.&lt;ref name="auto7"/&gt; Since Lenin had different motivations and interests than the German government at the time, he acted in a manner not suited to German interests, and grew so powerful that his party was instrumental to bringing down Imperial Germany.&lt;ref name="auto7"/&gt;

Excessive efforts to control or exploit agents of influence can also have negative consequences. Such agents are best seen as strategic or tactical allies, and efforts to exercise too much control over them may result in the loss of an influence asset.&lt;ref name="auto7"/&gt; Excessive exploitation of these agents can lead to their exposure by forcing them to take questionably one-sided positions, as witnessed in the exposure of Norwegian [[Arne Treholt]].&lt;ref name="auto8"&gt;Angello M. Codevilla, "Political Warfare," in Political Warfare and Psychological Operations: Rethinking the US Approach, ed. Frank R. Barnett and Carnes Lord (Washington, DC: National Defense University Press in Cooperation with National Strategy Information Center, 1989), pg. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; Because these agents exercise influence, their positions and opinions are not wholly secret, but the level to which they coordinate activities with a hostile power is likely to be kept secret.&lt;ref&gt;Angello M. Codevilla, "Political Warfare," in Political Warfare and Psychological Operations: Rethinking the US Approach, ed. Frank R. Barnett and Carnes Lord (Washington, DC: National Defense University Press in Cooperation with National Strategy Information Center, 1989), pg. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Agents of influence are most effective because they bring with them a sense of credibility among the target audience, and they use this credibility to convey a story or manipulate a situation in favor of the foreign power with which they share common preferences and motivations.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; This credibility makes agents of influence so effective that, according to [[Angelo Codevilla]], using these agents is an act of war "in the same sense that armies crashing across border or airplanes dropping bombs are acts of war because their results can be as intrusive or conclusive as the results of armies or bombs."&lt;ref&gt;Angelo M. Codevilla, "Political Warfare: A Set of Means for Achieving Political Ends," in Waller, ed., Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda and Political Warfare (IWP Press, 2008), pg. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Known agents of influence==
[[File:Arne Treholt 2010.jpg|thumb|150px|alt=text|Accused agent of influence and convicted spy Arne Treholt]]

Individuals operating as an agent of influence may serve in the fields of journalism, government, art, labor, academia, or a number of other professional fields.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Cultural opinion makers, nationalists, and religious leaders have also been targeted to serve as individual agents of influence.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; The following are some notable individuals that have been accused of being foreign agents of influence. The list is not exhaustive but is meant to show the wide range in which such agents can operate. As previously noted, proving someone is an agent of influence is among the most difficult endeavors, even for the most skilled counterintelligence officers.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

* [[Alger Hiss]] – an agent of influence and spy.&lt;ref name="auto9"&gt;Angelo M. Codevilla, "Political Warfare: A Set of Means for Achieving Political Ends," in Waller, ed., Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda and Political Warfare (IWP Press, 2008), pg. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his exposure he had significant support among US politicians and only went to jail for lying under oath about passing documents to the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="auto9"/&gt;
* Arne Herløv Petersen – used as a Soviet agent of influence in Norway for over 10 years, he mainly focused on various means of manipulating Danish public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas N. O'Brien, Russian Roulette: Disinformation in the U.S. Government and News Media, report (Columbia: University of South Carolina, 1989), pg. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Arne Treholt]] – he was exposed as a result of overuse as an agent of influence in taking blatantly one-sided arguments over Norway’s northern border.&lt;ref name="auto8"/&gt;
* [[Rose O'Neal Greenhow]] – Confederate spy and accused agent of influence working among the British.&lt;ref&gt;James W. Lucas, "Intelligence and the Decision-Making Process," in Proceedings of the Thirty-First Annual Military Librarians' Workshop, proceedings of Information Management and Intelligence, The Defense Intelligence Analysis Center Bolling Air Force Base, Washington (1987), pg. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Peter Matthiessen]] Writer and former covert CIA operative who admittedly established the [[Paris Review]] as a front for his agency activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/02/27/brady-media-cia-oped-cx_jb_0228brady.html|title=Just Who Was CIA?|author=James Brady|date=28 February 2008|work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2012/05/27/exclusive_the_paris_review_the_cold_war_and_the_cia/|title=Exclusive: The Paris Review, the Cold War and the CIA|author=Joel Whitney|work=Salon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizational functioning==
{{Main article|Communist front}}
In addition to individual agents of influence, front organizations can serve the interests of a foreign power in this capacity.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; When individuals join such organizations in good faith but are in fact serving the interests of a foreign elite, their affiliation becomes infiltration, and cumulatively the organization serves as an agent of influence.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt; It is important to note, however, that not all front organizations focus exclusively on influence operations, as some have more specific objectives (intelligence collection, etc.). The Cold War is a recent example of increased use of not only front organizations, but of front organizations being used as agents of influence to alter the target nation's belief system and policies on the international stage.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Shaw, "The Politics of Cold War Culture," Journal of Cold War Studies 3, no. 3 (Fall 2001): pg. #, http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~hpcws/tshaw.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of organizations as agents of influence during the Cold War is a recent example that serves to illustrate how frequently front organizations were used in an attempt to alter the perceptions and actions of a foreign nation and its public. A Communist front organization is an organization identified to be a [[front organization]] under the effective control of a [[Communist party]], the [[Communist International]] or other Communist organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Sheila Suess Kennedy, ''Free Expression in America: A Documentary History'' (Greenwood Press, 1999) pp. 111-122.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lenin]] originated the idea in his manifesto of 1902, "[[What Is to Be Done?]]". Since the party was illegal in [[Russia]], he proposed to reach the masses through "a large number of other organizations intended for wide membership and, which, therefore, can be as loose and as public as possible."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Theodore Draper, ''American Communism and Soviet Russia'' (2003)  p 172&lt;/ref&gt; Generally called "[[mass organizations]]" by the Communists themselves,&lt;ref&gt;Donald Hindley, ''The Communist Party of Indonesia 1951-1963'' (1966) p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; these groups were prevalent from the 1920s through the 1950s, with their use accelerating during the [[Popular Front]] period of the 1930s.

Starting in 1939, Attorney General Biddle began compiling a list of Fascist and Communist front organizations. It was called "[[Attorney General's List of Subversive Organizations]]" (AGLOSO), but was not at first made public.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Justin Goldstein, "Prelude to McCarthyism," ''Prologue,'' Fall 2006, Vol. 38 Issue 3, pp 22-33&lt;/ref&gt;  Political pressures from Congress forced President [[Harry S. Truman]] to act.&lt;ref&gt;Francis H. Thompson, ''The Frustration of Politics: Truman, Congress, and the Loyalty Issue, 1945-1953'' (1979)&lt;/ref&gt; Truman's Attorney General [[Tom C. Clark]] expanded the list, which was officially authorized by presidential [[Executive Order 9835]] in 1947 and was administered by the new Loyalty Review Board. The Board became part of the Civil Service Commission.&lt;ref&gt;Henry L. Shattuck, "The Loyalty Review Board Of The U.S. Civil Service Commission, 1947-1953," ''Massachusetts Historical Society Proceedings, 1966, Vol. 78, pp 63-80&lt;/ref&gt; The list was used by federal agencies to screen appointments during the Truman Administration.  The program investigated over 3 million government employees, of whom 300 were dismissed as security risks. Adverse decisions could be appealed to the Loyalty Review Board, a government agency set up by President Truman.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Donovan, ''Conflict and crisis: the presidency of Harry S.

[[Boris Rumer]] wrote in his book ''Central Asia at the End of the Transition'' (2005) that "anti-modernization is appearing in all spheres of culture and economics. The retraditionalization of social life, deprofessionalization of entire strata of the population, the anti-intellectualism emanating from above, the exodus of skilled personnel from the country{{spaced ndash}}these are all clear signs of the anti-modernization that characterizes the reality in post-Soviet [[Uzbekistan]]".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; This constitutes an example of how some people in certain places view movements of modernization. People(s) involved with the anti modernization movement sometimes perceive that western societies live in a culture that leads its people to be dominated by the people above them either economically or politically. This can be seen as severely negative and as representative of oppression.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Art''' is a diverse range of [[human behavior|human activities]] in creating visual, auditory or performing artifacts ([[artworks]]), expressing the author's [[imagination|imaginative]], [[Concept|conceptual]] [[idea]], or technical skill, intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power.&lt;ref name="OD"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/art |title=Art: definition |publisher=Oxford Dictionaries}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MW"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/art |title=art |publisher=Merriam-Websters Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their most general form these activities include the production of works of art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, and the aesthetic dissemination of art. 

The three classical branches of art are [[painting]], [[sculpture]] and [[architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.it/books?id=q8rvdsxGokwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Vasari+lives+of+painters,+sculptors+and+painters&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiTta2zrLreAhUGbBoKHdSoDUIQ6AEIKDAA]&lt;/ref&gt; Music, theatre, film, dance, and other [[performing arts]], as well as literature and other media such as [[interactive media]], are included in a broader definition  of [[the arts]].&lt;ref name=OD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Art, n. 1". OED Online. December 2011. Oxford University Press. http://www.oed.com. (Accessed 26 February 2012.)&lt;/ref&gt; Until the 17th century, ''art'' referred to any skill or mastery and was not differentiated from [[craft]]s or [[sciences]]. In modern usage after the 17th century, where aesthetic considerations are paramount, the fine arts are separated and distinguished from acquired skills in general, such as the decorative or [[applied arts]].

Though the definition of what constitutes art is disputed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Definitions of Art |author=Stephen Davies |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-8014-9794-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Artworks: Definition, Meaning, Value |author=Robert Stecker |publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-271-01596-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Theories of Art Today |editor=Noël Carroll |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-299-16354-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has changed over time, general descriptions mention an idea of imaginative or technical skill stemming from [[Agency (philosophy)|human agency]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ubc.ca/okanagan/creative/links/arthistory/What_is_Art_.html |archive-date=27 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427192624/http://www.ubc.ca/okanagan/creative/links/arthistory/What_is_Art_.html |title=What Is Art? |author=Dr. Robert J.

==Creative art and fine art==
{{wide image|Wang Ximeng - A Thousand Li of River (Bridge).jpg|1250px|Works of art can tell stories or simply express an aesthetic truth or feeling. Panorama of a section of ''A Thousand Li of Mountains and Rivers'', a 12th-century painting by Song dynasty artist [[Wang Ximeng]].}}

In the perspective of the history of art,&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt; artistic works have existed for almost as long as humankind: from early [[pre-historic art]] to [[contemporary art]]; however, some theories restrict the concept of "artistic works" to modern Western societies.&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, James "Art History and Images That Are Not Art", ''The Art Bulletin'', Vol. 47, No. 4 (December 1995), with previous bibliography. "Non-Western images are not well described in terms of art, and neither are medieval paintings that were made in the absence of humanist ideas of artistic value". 553&lt;/ref&gt; One early sense of the definition of ''art'' is closely related to the older Latin meaning, which roughly translates to "skill" or "craft," as associated with words such as "artisan." English words derived from this meaning include ''artifact'', ''artificial'', ''artifice'', ''medical arts'', and ''military arts''. However, there are many other colloquial uses of the word, all with some relation to its [[etymology]].
[[File:Teke bottle.JPG|thumb|upright|20th-century Rwandan bottle. Artistic works may serve practical functions, in addition to their decorative value.]]

Over time, [[Philosopher|philosophers]] like [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Socrates]] and [[Kant]], among others, questioned the meaning of art.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Kuhn pp. 73-96&lt;/ref&gt; Several dialogues in Plato tackle questions about art: Socrates says that poetry is inspired by the [[muses]], and is not rational. He speaks approvingly of this, and other forms of divine madness (drunkenness, eroticism, and dreaming) in the ''[[Phaedrus (Plato)|Phaedrus]] ''(265a–c), and yet in the ''[[Republic (Plato)|''Republic'']]'' wants to outlaw Homer's great poetic art, and laughter as well. In ''[[Ion (dialogue)|Ion]]'', Socrates gives no hint of the disapproval of Homer that he expresses in the ''Republic''. The dialogue ''Ion'' suggests that [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' functioned in the ancient Greek world as the Bible does today in the modern Christian world: as divinely inspired literary art that can provide moral guidance, if only it can be properly interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Kuhn pp. 40-72&lt;/ref&gt;

With regards to the literary art and the musical arts, Aristotle considered [[epic poetry]], tragedy, comedy, [[Dithyramb|dithyrambic poetry]] and music to be [[Mimesis|mimetic]] or imitative art, each varying in imitation by medium, object, and manner.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' I 1447a&lt;/ref&gt; For example, music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony, whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone, and poetry with language. The forms also differ in their object of imitation. Comedy, for instance, is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average. Lastly, the forms differ in their manner of imitation—through narrative or character, through change or no change, and through drama or no drama.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' III&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle believed that imitation is natural to mankind and constitutes one of mankind's advantages over animals.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'' IV&lt;/ref&gt;

The second, and more recent, sense of the word ''art'' as an abbreviation for ''creative art'' or ''fine art'' emerged in the early 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary|The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]]''. [[Oxford University Press]], Oxford 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;120&lt;/ref&gt; Fine art refers to a skill used to express the artist's creativity, or to engage the audience's aesthetic sensibilities, or to draw the audience towards consideration of more refined or ''finer'' work of art.

Within this latter sense, the word ''art'' may refer to several things: (i) a study of a creative skill, (ii) a process of using the creative skill, (iii) a product of the creative skill, or (iv) the audience's experience with the creative skill. The creative arts (''art'' as discipline) are a collection of disciplines which produce ''artworks'' (''art'' as objects) that are compelled by a personal drive (art as activity) and convey a message, mood, or symbolism for the perceiver to interpret (art as experience).  Art is something that stimulates an individual's thoughts, emotions, beliefs, or ideas through the senses. Works of art can be explicitly made for this purpose or interpreted on the basis of images or objects. For some scholars, such as [[Kant]], the sciences and the arts could be distinguished by taking science as representing the domain of knowledge and the arts as representing the domain of the freedom of artistic expression.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Kuhn pp. 287-326&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, if the skill is being used in a common or practical way, people will consider it a craft instead of art. Likewise, if the skill is being used in a commercial or industrial way, it may be considered [[commercial art]] instead of fine art. On the other hand, crafts and design are sometimes considered [[applied art]]. Some art followers have argued that the difference between fine art and applied art has more to do with value judgments made about the art than any clear definitional difference.&lt;ref&gt;David Novitz, ''The Boundaries of Art'', 1992&lt;/ref&gt; However, even fine art often has goals beyond pure creativity and self-expression. The purpose of works of art may be to communicate ideas, such as in politically, spiritually, or philosophically motivated art; to create a sense of beauty (see [[aesthetics]]); to explore the nature of perception; for pleasure; or to generate strong [[emotion]]s. The purpose may also be seemingly nonexistent.

The nature of art has been described by philosopher [[Richard Wollheim]] as "one of the most elusive of the traditional problems of human culture".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Wollheim, ''Art and its objects'', p. 1, 2nd ed., 1980, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-29706-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Art has been defined as a vehicle for the expression or communication of emotions and ideas, a means for exploring and appreciating [[Formalism (art)|formal elements]] for their own sake, and as ''[[mimesis]]'' or [[Representation (arts)|representation]]. Art as mimesis has deep roots in the philosophy of [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name=Levinson5/&gt; [[Leo Tolstoy]] identified art as a use of indirect means to communicate from one person to another.&lt;ref name="Levinson5"&gt;Jerrold Levinson, ''The Oxford Handbook of Aesthetics'', Oxford University Press, 2003, p. 5. {{ISBN|0-19-927945-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benedetto Croce]] and [[R.G. Collingwood]] advanced the [[Idealism|idealist]] view that art expresses emotions, and that the work of art therefore essentially exists in the mind of the creator.&lt;ref&gt;Jerrold Levinson, ''The Oxford Handbook of Aesthetics'', Oxford University Press, 2003, p. 16. {{ISBN|0-19-927945-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.G. Collingwood's view, expressed in ''The Principles of Art'', is considered in Wollheim, op. cit. 1980 pp. 36–43&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of art as form has its roots in the philosophy of [[Kant]], and was developed in the early twentieth century by [[Roger Fry]] and [[Clive Bell]].  More recently, thinkers influenced by [[Martin Heidegger]] have interpreted art as the means by which a community develops for itself a medium for self-expression and interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Heidegger]], "The Origin of the Work of Art", in ''Poetry, Language, Thought'', (Harper Perennial, 2001). See also [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], "Cézanne's Doubt" in ''The Merleau-Ponty Aesthetics Reader'', Galen Johnson and Michael Smith (eds), (Northwestern University Press, 1994) and [[John Russon]], ''Bearing Witness to Epiphany'', (State University of New York Press, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Dickie (philosopher)|George Dickie]] has offered an [[institutional theory of art]] that defines a work of art as any artifact upon which a qualified person or persons acting on behalf of the social institution commonly referred to as "the [[art world]]" has conferred "the status of candidate for appreciation".&lt;ref&gt;Kennick, William ed, and W. E. Kennick, ''Art and philosophy: readings in aesthetics'' New York: St. Martin's Press, 1979, p. 89. {{ISBN|0-312-05391-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larry Shiner has described fine art as "not an essence or a fate but something we have made. Art as we have generally understood it is a European invention barely two hundred years old."&lt;ref&gt;Shiner 2003. ''[[The Invention of Art: A Cultural History]]''Chicago: University of Chicago Press. p. 3. {{ISBN|978-0-226-75342-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art may be characterized in terms of [[mimesis]] (its representation of reality), narrative (storytelling), expression, communication of emotion, or other qualities. During the [[Romanticism|Romantic period]], art came to be seen as "a special faculty of the human mind to be classified with religion and science".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Gombrich, Ernst. |url=http://www.gombrich.co.uk/showdoc.php?id=68 |title=Press statement on The Story of Art |accessdate=18 November 2008 |year=2005 |website=The Gombrich Archive |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006212330/http://www.gombrich.co.uk/showdoc.php?id=68 |archivedate=6 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many great traditions in art have a foundation in the art of one of the great ancient civilizations: [[Ancient Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[History of Iran|Persia]], India, China, Ancient Greece, Rome, as well as [[Inca]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], and [[Olmec]]. Each of these centers of early civilization developed a unique and characteristic style in its art. Because of the size and duration of these civilizations, more of their art works have survived and more of their influence has been transmitted to other cultures and later times. Some also have provided the first records of how artists worked. For example, this period of Greek art saw a veneration of the human physical form and the development of equivalent skills to show musculature, poise, beauty, and anatomically correct proportions.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, p.83, pp.75-115 pp.132-141, pp.147-155, p.163, p.627.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] and [[Medieval art]] of the Western Middle Ages, much art focused on the expression of subjects about Biblical and religious culture, and used styles that showed the higher glory of a heavenly world, such as the use of gold in the background of paintings, or glass in mosaics or windows, which also presented figures in idealized, patterned (flat) forms. Nevertheless, a classical realist tradition persisted in small Byzantine works, and realism steadily grew in the art of Catholic Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, pp.86-89, pp.135-141, p.143, p.179, p.185.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Renaissance art]] had a greatly increased emphasis on the realistic depiction of the material world, and the place of humans in it, reflected in the corporeality of the human body, and development of a systematic method of [[graphical perspective]] to depict recession in a three-dimensional picture space.&lt;ref name="Nichols2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tom Nichols|title=Renaissance Art: A Beginner's Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dzMRpHo0QHUC|date=1 December 2012|publisher=Oneworld Publications|isbn=978-1-78074-178-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Tugra Mahmuds II.gif|right|thumb|The stylized signature of [[Sultan]] [[Mahmud II]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] was written in [[Islamic calligraphy]]. It reads "Mahmud Khan son of Abdulhamid is forever victorious".]]
[[File:Great Mosque of Kairouan Panorama - Grande Mosquée de Kairouan Panorama.jpg|thumb|The [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]] in Tunisia, also called the Mosque of Uqba, is one of the finest, most significant and best preserved artistic and architectural examples of early great mosques.

In the east, [[Islamic art]]'s rejection of [[iconography]] led to emphasis on [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric patterns]], [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphy]], and [[Islamic architecture|architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, pp. 127-128&lt;/ref&gt; Further east, religion dominated artistic styles and forms too. India and Tibet saw emphasis on painted sculptures and dance, while religious painting borrowed many conventions from sculpture and tended to bright contrasting colors with emphasis on outlines. China saw the flourishing of many art forms: jade carving, bronzework, pottery (including the stunning [[terracotta army]] of Emperor Qin&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, pp. 634-635&lt;/ref&gt;), poetry, calligraphy, music, painting, drama, fiction, etc. Chinese styles vary greatly from era to era and each one is traditionally named after the ruling dynasty. So, for example, [[Tang dynasty]] paintings are monochromatic and sparse, emphasizing idealized landscapes, but [[Ming dynasty]] paintings are busy and colorful, and focus on telling stories via setting and composition.&lt;ref name="Watson1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Watson|title=The Arts of China 900-1620|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T-v5jUKaCxYC|year=1995|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-09835-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan names its styles after imperial dynasties too, and also saw much interplay between the styles of calligraphy and painting. [[Woodblock printing]] became important in Japan after the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, p.155, p.530.&lt;/ref&gt;

The western [[Age of Enlightenment]] in the 18th century saw artistic depictions of physical and rational certainties of the clockwork universe, as well as politically revolutionary visions of a post-monarchist world, such as [[William Blake|Blake]]'s portrayal of Newton as a divine geometer,&lt;ref name="Moore2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Colin Moore|title=Propaganda Prints: A History of Art in the Service of Social and Political Change|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l0KAlsQ2Yj4C|date=6 August 2010|publisher=A&amp;amp;C Black|isbn=978-1-4081-0591-7|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Jacques-Louis David|David]]'s propagandistic paintings. This led to [[Romanticism|Romantic]] rejections of this in favor of pictures of the emotional side and individuality of humans, exemplified in the novels of [[Goethe]]. The late 19th century then saw a host of artistic movements, such as [[academic art]], [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], [[impressionism]] and [[fauvism]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, pp.394-395, pp.519-527, pp. 573-575.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Age of Enlightenment An Anthology Prepared for the Enlightenment Book Club|url=http://www.rosenfels.org/The_Age_Of_Enlightenment_Anthology.pdf|accessdate=26 May 2018|pages=1–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of twentieth-century art is a narrative of endless possibilities and the search for new standards, each being torn down in succession by the next. Thus the parameters of [[impressionism]], [[Expressionism]], [[Fauvism]], [[Cubism]], [[Dadaism]], [[Surrealism]], etc. cannot be maintained very much beyond the time of their invention. Increasing [[globalization|global]] interaction during this time saw an equivalent influence of other cultures into Western art. Thus, Japanese woodblock prints (themselves influenced by Western Renaissance draftsmanship) had an immense influence on impressionism and subsequent development. Later, [[African art|African sculptures]] were taken up by Picasso and to some extent by [[Matisse]]. Similarly, in the 19th and 20th centuries the West has had huge impacts on Eastern art with originally western ideas like [[Communism]] and [[Post-Modernism]] exerting a powerful influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New York Times Book Review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vwEjAQAAMAAJ|volume=1, 84|year=1979|publisher=New York Times Company|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Modernism]], the idealistic search for truth, gave way in the latter half of the 20th century to a realization of its unattainability. [[Theodor W. Adorno]] said in 1970, "It is now taken for granted that nothing which concerns art can be taken for granted any more: neither art itself, nor art in relationship to the whole, nor even the right of art to exist."&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, Theodor W., ''Aesthetic Theory'', (1970 in German)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Relativism]] was accepted as an unavoidable truth, which led to the period of [[contemporary art]] and [[List of postmodern critics|postmodern criticism]], where cultures of the world and of history are seen as changing forms, which can be appreciated and drawn from only with [[skepticism]] and irony. Furthermore, the separation of cultures is increasingly blurred and some argue it is now more appropriate to think in terms of a global culture, rather than of regional ones.&lt;ref name="Sangeeta2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dr. Sangeeta|title=Development of Modern Art Criticism in India after Independence: Post Independence Indian Art Criticism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vqs4DwAAQBAJ|accessdate=26 May 2018|date=6 October 2017|publisher=Notion Press|isbn=978-1-947697-31-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Origin of the Work of Art]]'', [[Martin Heidegger]], a German philosopher and a seminal thinker, describes the essence of art in terms of the concepts of being and truth. He argues that art is not only a way of expressing the element of truth in a culture, but the means of creating it and providing a springboard from which "that which is" can be revealed. Works of art are not merely representations of the way things are, but actually produce a community's shared understanding. Each time a new artwork is added to any culture, the meaning of what it is to exist is inherently changed.

==Forms, genres, media, and styles==
[[File:Ingres, Napoleon on his Imperial throne.jpg|thumb|''[[Napoleon I on his Imperial Throne]]'' by [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres|Ingres]] (French, 1806), oil on canvas]]
{{Main|The arts}}
The creative arts are often divided into more specific categories, typically along perceptually distinguishable categories such as [[List of art mediums|media]], genre, [[Art movement|styles]], and form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Walton |first1=Kendall L. |title=Categories of Art |journal=The Philosophical Review |date=1 January 1970 |volume=79 |issue=3 |pages=334–67 |doi=10.2307/2183933 |jstor=2183933}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''''Art form''''' refers to the [[elements of art]] that are independent of its interpretation or significance. It covers the methods adopted by the artist and the physical [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] of the artwork, primarily non-semantic aspects of the work (i.e., [[figurae]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Monelle |first1=Raymond |title=Linguistics and Semiotics in Music |date=3 January 1992 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-3718652099 |page=202 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nMtQAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA202&amp;pg=PA202#q=figurae |accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Color theory|color]], [[Contour drawing|contour]], [[Fourth dimension in art|dimension]], [[List of art mediums|medium]], [[melody]], [[Negative space|space]], [[Texture (painting)|texture]], and [[Lightness|value]]. Form may also include [[Visual design elements and principles#Principles of design|visual design principles]], such as arrangement, [[Formal balance|balance]], [[Contrast (vision)|contrast]], [[Emphasis (typography)|emphasis]], [[harmony]], [[Hierarchical proportion|proportion]], [[Principles of grouping|proximity]], and rhythm.&lt;ref name="Belton"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Belton |first1=Dr. Robert J. |title=Art History: A Preliminary Handbook |chapter=The Elements of Art |date=1996|chapter-url=http://fccs.ok.ubc.ca/about/links/resources/arthistory/elements.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general there are three schools of philosophy regarding art, focusing respectively on form, content, and context.&lt;ref name="Belton"/&gt; Extreme [[Formalism (art)|Formalism]] is the view that all aesthetic properties of art are formal (that is, part of the art form). Philosophers almost universally reject this view and hold that the properties and aesthetics of art extend beyond materials, techniques, and form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Xu |first1=Min |last2=Deng |first2=Guifang |title=Against Zangwill's Extreme Formalism About Inorganic Nature |journal=Philosophia |date=2 December 2014 |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=249–57 |doi=10.1007/s11406-014-9575-1 |url=http://xy.cmsproxy.sysu.edu.cn/pub/hkmacc/docs/2014-12/20141215194213014875.pdf |accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, there is little consensus on terminology for these informal properties. Some authors refer to subject matter and content – i.e., [[denotation]]s and [[connotation]]s – while others prefer terms like [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] and [[Importance|significance]].&lt;ref name="Belton"/&gt;

Extreme Intentionalism holds that [[authorial intent]] plays a decisive role in the meaning of a work of art, conveying the content or essential main idea, while all other interpretations can be discarded.&lt;ref name="Livingston"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Livingston |first1=Paisley |title=Intentionalism in Aesthetics |journal=New Literary History |date=1998 |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=831–46 |doi=10.1353/nlh.1998.0042 |url=http://works.bepress.com/paisley_livingston/67}}&lt;/ref&gt; It defines the subject as the persons or idea represented,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Munk |first1=Eduard |last2=Beck |first2=Charles |last3=Felton |first3=Cornelius Conway |title=The Metres of the Greeks and Romans |date=1844 |page=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SxRgAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 |accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the content as the artist's experience of that subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tolstoy |first1=Leo |title=What is Art? |date=1899 |publisher=Crowell |page=24 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0SYVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA24 |accessdate=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the composition of [[Napoleon I on his Imperial Throne]] is partly borrowed from the [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia]]. As evidenced by the title, the subject is [[Napoleon]], and the content is [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres|Ingres]]'s representation of Napoleon as "Emperor-God beyond time and space".&lt;ref name="Belton"/&gt; Similarly to extreme formalism, philosophers typically reject extreme intentionalism, because art may have multiple ambiguous meanings and authorial intent may be unknowable and thus irrelevant. Its restrictive interpretation is "socially unhealthy, philosophically unreal, and politically unwise".&lt;ref name="Belton"/&gt;

Finally, the developing theory of [[post-structuralism]] studies art's significance in a cultural context, such as the ideas, emotions, and reactions prompted by a work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first1=Melahat Küçükarslan |last1=Emiroğlu |first2=Fitnat Cimşit |last2=Koş |title=Design Semiotics and Post-Structuralism |conference=12th World Congress of Semiotics |date=16–20 September 2014 |location=New Bulgarian University |url=http://semio2014.org/en/design-semiotics-and-post-structuralism |access-date=26 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cultural context often reduces to the artist's techniques and intentions, in which case analysis proceeds along lines similar to formalism and intentionalism. However, in other cases historical and material conditions may predominate, such as religious and philosophical convictions, sociopolitical and economic structures, or even climate and geography. [[Art criticism]] continues to grow and develop alongside art.&lt;ref name="Belton"/&gt;

Art can connote a sense of trained ability or mastery of a [[Media (arts)|medium]]. Art can also simply refer to the developed and efficient use of a [[language]] to convey meaning with immediacy and or depth. Art can be defined as an act of expressing feelings, thoughts, and observations.&lt;ref&gt;Breskin, Vladimir, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110901145415/http://vip.iva.dk/signs/Articles_Signs_International_Section/2010/Breskin_(2010)_Signs_Triad_eng_final_rev_2010.pdf "Triad: Method for studying the core of the semiotic parity of language and art"], ''Signs – International Journal of Semiotics'' 3, pp. 1–28, 2010. {{ISSN|1902-8822}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an understanding that is reached with the material as a result of handling it, which facilitates one's thought processes.
A common view is that the [[Wikt:epithet|epithet]] "art", particular in its elevated sense, requires a certain level of creative expertise by the artist, whether this be a demonstration of technical ability, an originality in stylistic approach, or a combination of these two. Traditionally skill of execution was viewed as a quality inseparable from art and thus necessary for its success; for [[Leonardo da Vinci]], art, neither more nor less than his other endeavors, was a manifestation of skill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Illustrated London News|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-oc-AQAAMAAJ|accessdate=26 May 2018|date=July 1872|publisher=Illustrated London News &amp; Sketch Limited|page=502}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rembrandt]]'s work, now praised for its ephemeral virtues, was most admired by his contemporaries for its virtuosity.&lt;ref name="NewtonNeil1966"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Eric Newton|author2=William Neil|title=2000 Years of Christian Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IsSfAAAAMAAJ|year=1966|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the turn of the 20th century, the adroit performances of [[John Singer Sargent]] were alternately admired and viewed with skepticism for their manual fluency,&lt;ref name="RichardsGjertson2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kirk Richards|author2=Stephen Gjertson|title=For glory and for beauty: practical perspectives on Christianity and the visual arts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JaBGAQAAIAAJ|year=2002|publisher=American Society of Classical Realism|isbn=978-0-9636180-4-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet at nearly the same time the artist who would become the era's most recognized and peripatetic iconoclast, [[Pablo Picasso]], was completing a traditional academic training at which he excelled.&lt;ref name="Leslie2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Leslie|title=Pablo Picasso: A Modern Master|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iE8Es-9j3e0C|date=30 December 2005|publisher=New Line Books|isbn=978-1-59764-094-7|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DillenbergerHandley2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jane Dillenberger|author2=John Handley|title=The Religious Art of Pablo Picasso|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6uglDQAAQBAJ|date=17 April 2014|publisher=Univ of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-27629-1|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MonaLisa sfumato.jpeg|thumb|Detail of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[Mona Lisa]]'', showing the painting technique of ''[[sfumato]]'']]
A common contemporary criticism of some [[modern art]] occurs along the lines of objecting to the apparent lack of skill or ability required in the production of the artistic object. In conceptual art, [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s "[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]" is among the first examples of pieces wherein the artist used found objects ("ready-made") and exercised no traditionally recognised set of skills.&lt;ref name="Kleiner2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fred S. Kleiner|title=Gardner's Art through the Ages: The Western Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UK_jTggtYl8C|accessdate=26 May 2018|date=7 January 2009|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-57364-7|pages=24–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tracey Emin]]'s ''My Bed'', or [[Damien Hirst]]'s ''The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living'' follow this example and also manipulate the mass media. Emin slept (and engaged in other activities) in her bed before placing the result in a gallery as work of art. Hirst came up with the conceptual design for the artwork but has left most of the eventual creation of many works to employed artisans. Hirst's celebrity is founded entirely on his ability to produce shocking concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=White|first1=Luke|title=Damien Hirst's Shark: Nature, Capitalism and the Sublime|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/research-publications/the-sublime/luke-white-damien-hirsts-shark-nature-capitalism-and-the-sublime-r1136828|publisher=Tate|accessdate=26 May 2018|language=en|date=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actual production in many conceptual and contemporary works of art is a matter of assembly of found objects. However, there are many modernist and contemporary artists who continue to excel in the skills of drawing and painting and in creating ''hands-on'' works of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=La Belle Assemblée|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pucAAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=26 May 2018|volume=V|year=1808|publisher=J.

Art has had a great number of different functions throughout its history, making its purpose difficult to abstract or quantify to any single concept. This does not imply that the purpose of Art is "vague", but that it has had many unique, different reasons for being created. Some of these functions of Art are provided in the following outline. The different purposes of art may be grouped according to those that are non-motivated, and those that are motivated (Lévi-Strauss).&lt;ref name="Schiuma2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Giovanni Schiuma|title=The Value of Arts for Business|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9wyboE8aWDcC|date=19 May 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-49665-0|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-motivated functions ===
The non-motivated purposes of art are those that are integral to being human, transcend the individual, or do not fulfill a specific external purpose. In this sense, Art, as creativity, is something humans must do by their very nature (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;no other species creates art), and is therefore beyond utility.&lt;ref name="Schiuma2011" /&gt;
# '''[[fine arts|Basic human instinct for harmony, balance, rhythm]].''' Art at this level is not an action or an object, but an internal appreciation of balance and harmony (beauty), and therefore an aspect of being human beyond utility.&lt;blockquote&gt;Imitation, then, is one instinct of our nature. Next, there is the instinct for 'harmony' and rhythm, meters being manifestly sections of rhythm. Persons, therefore, starting with this natural gift developed by degrees their special aptitudes, till their rude improvisations gave birth to Poetry. - Aristotle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Aristotle |title=Republic |chapter=[Book 10:] The Poetics |others=Note: Although speaking mostly of poetry here, the Ancient Greeks often speak of the arts collectively |url=http://www.authorama.com/the-poetics-2.html |website=www.authorama.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# '''Experience of the mysterious.''' Art provides a way to experience one's self in relation to the universe. This experience may often come unmotivated, as one appreciates art, music or poetry.&lt;blockquote&gt;The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science. – Albert Einstein&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, Albert. "The World as I See It". http://www.aip.org/history/einstein/essay.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# '''Expression of the imagination.''' Art provides a means to express the imagination in non-grammatic ways that are not tied to the formality of spoken or written language. Unlike words, which come in sequences and each of which have a definite meaning, art provides a range of forms, symbols and ideas with meanings that are malleable.&lt;blockquote&gt;Jupiter's eagle [as an example of art] is not, like logical (aesthetic) attributes of an object, the concept of the sublimity and majesty of creation, but rather something else—something that gives the imagination an incentive to spread its flight over a whole host of kindred representations that provoke more thought than admits of expression in a concept determined by words. They furnish an aesthetic idea, which serves the above rational idea as a substitute for logical presentation, but with the proper function, however, of animating the mind by opening out for it a prospect into a field of kindred representations stretching beyond its ken. - Immanuel Kant&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Kant, ''Critique of Aesthetic Judgement'' (1790).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# '''Ritualistic and symbolic functions.''' In many cultures, art is used in rituals, performances and dances as a decoration or symbol. While these often have no specific utilitarian (motivated) purpose, anthropologists know that they often serve a purpose at the level of meaning within a particular culture. This meaning is not furnished by any one individual, but is often the result of many generations of change, and of a cosmological relationship within the culture.&lt;blockquote&gt;Most scholars who deal with rock paintings or objects recovered from prehistoric contexts that cannot be explained in utilitarian terms and are thus categorized as decorative, ritual or symbolic, are aware of the trap posed by the term 'art'. - Silva Tomaskova&lt;ref&gt;Silvia Tomaskova, ''Places of Art: Art and Archaeology in Context'': (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Motivated functions ===
Motivated purposes of art refer to intentional, conscious actions on the part of the artists or creator. These may be to bring about political change, to comment on an aspect of society, to convey a specific emotion or mood, to address personal psychology, to illustrate another discipline, to (with commercial arts) sell a product, or simply as a form of communication.&lt;ref name="Schiuma2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stephanidis2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Constantine Stephanidis|title=HCI International 2011 Posters' Extended Abstracts: International Conference, HCI International 2011, Orlando, FL, USA, July 9-14, 2011,Proceedings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qble3WYcH0cC|date=24 June 2011|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-642-22094-4|pages=529–533}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Communication.''' Art, at its simplest, is a form of communication. As most forms of communication have an intent or goal directed toward another individual, this is a motivated purpose. Illustrative arts, such as scientific illustration, are a form of art as communication. Maps are another example. However, the content need not be scientific. Emotions, moods and feelings are also communicated through art.&lt;blockquote&gt;[Art is a set of] artefacts or images with symbolic meanings as a means of communication. – Steve Mithen&lt;ref&gt;Steve Mithen. ''The Prehistory of the Mind: The Cognitive Origins of Art, Religion and Science''. 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# '''Art as entertainment'''. Art may seek to bring about a particular emotion or mood, for the purpose of relaxing or entertaining the viewer. This is often the function of the art industries of Motion Pictures and Video Games.&lt;ref name="Resources2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Management Association, Information Resources|title=Digital Arts and Entertainment: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1BaXBQAAQBAJ|date=30 June 2014|publisher=IGI Global|isbn=978-1-4666-6115-8|page=976}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''The Avante-Garde. Art for political change.''' One of the defining functions of early twentieth-century art has been to use visual images to bring about political change. Art movements that had this goal—[[Dadaism]], [[Surrealism]], [[Russian constructivism]], and [[Abstract Expressionism]], among others—are collectively referred to as the ''avante-garde'' arts.&lt;blockquote&gt;By contrast, the realistic attitude, inspired by positivism, from Saint Thomas Aquinas to Anatole France, clearly seems to me to be hostile to any intellectual or moral advancement. I loathe it, for it is made up of mediocrity, hate, and dull conceit. It is this attitude which today gives birth to these ridiculous books, these insulting plays. It constantly feeds on and derives strength from the newspapers and stultifies both science and art by assiduously flattering the lowest of tastes; clarity bordering on stupidity, a dog's life. – André Breton (Surrealism)&lt;ref&gt;André Breton, ''Surrealist Manifesto'' (1924)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# '''Art as a "free zone"''', removed from the action of the social censure. Unlike the [[avant-garde]] movements, which wanted to erase cultural differences in order to produce new universal values, [[contemporary art]] has enhanced its tolerance towards cultural differences as well as its critical and liberating functions (social inquiry, activism, subversion, deconstruction ...), becoming a more open place for research and experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Maurizio Bolognini]] this is not only associated with the [[postmodern art|postmodern]] rejection of all canons but with a process of secularization of art, which is finally considered as "a mere (albeit essential) convention, sustained and reproduced by the art system (artists, galleries, critics, collectors), providing a free zone, that is, a more open place for experimentation, removed from the constraints of the practical sphere.": see {{Cite book |title=Postdigitale |url=http://www.bolognini.org/bolognini_PDIG.htm |year=2008 |author=Maurizio Bolognini |publisher=Carocci |location=Rome |isbn=978-88-430-4739-0}}, [http://www.bolognini.org/bolognini_PDIG.htm#ch3b chap. 3].&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Art for social inquiry, subversion and/or anarchy.''' While similar to art for political change, subversive or deconstructivist art may seek to question aspects of society without any specific political goal. In this case, the function of art may be simply to criticize some aspect of society.[[File:Graffiti Panorama rome.jpg|upright=3.2|thumb|center|[[Aerosol paint|Spray-paint]] [[graffiti]] on a wall in Rome]] [[Graffiti#Uses|Graffiti art]] and other types of [[street art]] are graphics and images that are [[Spray painting|spray-painted]] or [[stencil]]led on publicly viewable walls, buildings, buses, trains, and bridges, usually without permission. Certain art forms, such as graffiti, may also be illegal when they break laws (in this case vandalism).
# '''Art for social causes.''' Art can be used to raise awareness for a large variety of causes. A number of art activities were aimed at raising awareness of [[autism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Trotter |first=Jeramia |title=RiverKings raising autism awareness with art |url=http://southaven-hornlake.wmctv.com/news/arts-culture/riverkings-raising-autism-awareness-art/52165 |accessdate=21 February 2013 |newspaper=WMC tv |date=15 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110222053732/http://southaven-hornlake.wmctv.com/news/arts-culture/riverkings-raising-autism-awareness-art/52165 |archivedate=22 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Art exhibit aims to raise awareness of autism |url=http://www.newsminer.com/article_1a9b7e33-6ca0-56a5-89f3-c9c0798815a2.html |accessdate=21 February 2013 |newspaper=Daily News-Miner |date=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Anchorage art exhibit to raise awareness about autism |url=http://dhss.alaska.gov/News/Documents/press/2011/Anchorage_art_exhibit_autism_PR033111.pdf |publisher=Alaska Department of Health and Social Services |accessdate=21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; cancer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ruhl |first=Ashleigh |title=Photographer Seeks Subjects To Help Raise Cancer Awareness |url=http://www.gazettes.com/lifestyle/arts_and_entertainment/photographer-seeks-subjects-to-help-raise-cancer-awareness/article_10291db8-7614-11e2-be53-0019bb2963f4.html |accessdate=21 February 2013 |newspaper=Gazettes |date=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bra art raising awareness for breast cancer |url=http://www.palmbeachpost.com/videos/news/national/bra-art-raising-awareness-for-breast-cancer/vgBSm/ |accessdate=22 January 2015 |newspaper=The Palm Beach Post |date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Flynn |first=Marella |title=October art walk aims to raise money, awareness for breast cancer |url=http://gargoyle.flagler.edu/2007/10/october-art-walk-aims-to-raise-money-awareness-for-breast-cancer/ |accessdate=21 February 2013 |newspaper=Flagler College Gargoyle |date=10 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[human trafficking]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Students get creative in the fight against human trafficking |url=http://www.wdtn.com/dpp/news/local/montgomery/ud-students-use-art-to-raise-awareness#.USb6vFeIqAg |accessdate=21 February 2013 |newspaper=WDTN Channel 2 News |date=26 November 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130630141018/http://www.wdtn.com/dpp/news/local/montgomery/ud-students-use-art-to-raise-awareness%23.UdA8P33LfK5 |archivedate=June 30, 2013}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Looking to raise awareness at ArtPrize |url=http://www.wwmt.com/shared/newsroom/top-stories/stories/wwmt_looking-raise-awareness-at-artprize-4625.shtml |accessdate=21 February 2013 |newspaper=WWMT, Newschannel 3 |date=10 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006075346/http://www.wwmt.com/shared/newsroom/top-stories/stories/wwmt_looking-raise-awareness-at-artprize-4625.shtml |archivedate=6 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a variety of other topics, such as ocean conservation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SciCafe – Art/Sci Collision: Raising Ocean Conservation Awareness |url=http://www.amnh.org/calendar/scicafe-art-sci-collision-raising-ocean-conservation-awareness |publisher=American Museum of Natural History |accessdate=21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; human rights in [[Darfur]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=SMU students raise awareness with 'Art for Darfur' |url=http://smu.edu/newsinfo/releases/07138c.asp |accessdate=21 February 2003 |newspaper=SMU News Release |date=4 March 2008 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130403085335/http://smu.edu/newsinfo/releases/07138c.asp |archivedate=3 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; murdered and missing Aboriginal women,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Donnelly |first=Greg |title=Red dress art project to raise awareness of murdered and missing Aboriginal women |url=http://www.globaltvedmonton.com/red+dress+art+project+to+raise+awareness+of+murdered+and+missing+aboriginal+women/6442594504/story.html |accessdate=21 February 2013 |newspaper=Global Edmonton |date=3 May 2012}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; elder abuse,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Raising elder abuse awareness through intergenerational art |url=http://www.hrsdc.gc.ca/eng/success_stories/seniors/40/index.shtml |publisher=Human Resources and Skills Development Canada |accessdate=21 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122162638/http://www.hrsdc.gc.ca/eng/success_stories/seniors/40/index.shtml |archivedate=22 January 2013 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mathema |first=Paavan |title=Trash to treasure: Turning Mt.

# '''Art for psychological and healing purposes.''' Art is also used by art therapists, psychotherapists and clinical psychologists as [[art therapy]]. The [[Art therapy#The Diagnostic Drawing Series (DDS)|Diagnostic Drawing Series]], for example, is used to determine the personality and emotional functioning of a patient. The end product is not the principal goal in this case, but rather a process of healing, through creative acts, is sought. The resultant piece of artwork may also offer insight into the troubles experienced by the subject and may suggest suitable approaches to be used in more conventional forms of psychiatric therapy.&lt;ref name="Hogan2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan Hogan|title=Healing Arts: The History of Art Therapy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vzUuna6LPBIC|year=2001|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|isbn=978-1-85302-799-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Art for propaganda, or commercialism.''' Art is often utilized as a form of propaganda, and thus can be used to subtly influence popular conceptions or mood. In a similar way, art that tries to sell a product also influences mood and emotion. In both cases, the purpose of art here is to subtly manipulate the viewer into a particular emotional or psychological response toward a particular idea or object.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roland Barthes]], ''Mythologies''&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Art as a fitness indicator.''' It has been argued that the ability of the human brain by far exceeds what was needed for survival in the ancestral environment. One [[evolutionary psychology]] explanation for this is that the human brain and associated traits (such as artistic ability and creativity) are the human equivalent of the [[peacock]]'s tail. The purpose of the male peacock's extravagant tail has been argued to be to attract females (see also [[Fisherian runaway]] and [[handicap principle]]). According to this theory superior execution of art was evolutionary important because it attracted mates.&lt;ref name="Dutton"&gt;[[Denis Dutton|Dutton, Denis]]. 2003. "Aesthetics and Evolutionary Psychology" in ''The Oxford Handbook for Aesthetics''. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The functions of art described above are not mutually exclusive, as many of them may overlap. For example, art for the purpose of entertainment may also seek to sell a product, i.e. the movie or video game.

==Public access==
[[File:Chateau-de-versailles-cour.jpg|upright=2|thumb|left|Versailles: [[Louis Le Vau]] opened up the interior court to create the expansive entrance ''[[cour d'honneur]]'', later copied all over Europe.]]

Since ancient times, much of the finest art has represented a deliberate display of wealth or power, often achieved by using massive scale and expensive materials. Much art has been commissioned by political rulers or religious establishments, with more modest versions only available to the most wealthy in society.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Kuhn pp. 161-165&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, there have been many periods where art of very high quality was available, in terms of ownership, across large parts of society, above all in cheap media such as pottery, which persists in the ground, and perishable media such as textiles and wood. In many different cultures, the [[ceramics of indigenous peoples of the Americas]] are found in such a wide range of graves that they were clearly not restricted to a [[social elite]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ceramics of the Indigenous Peoples of South America: Studies of Production and Exchange using INAA|url=https://core.tdar.org/collection/58128/ceramics-of-the-indigenous-peoples-of-south-america-studies-of-production-and-exchange-using-inaa|website=core.tdar.org|accessdate=28 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; though other forms of art may have been. Reproductive methods such as [[Molding (process)|moulds]] made mass-production easier, and were used to bring high-quality [[Ancient Roman pottery]] and Greek [[Tanagra figurine]]s to a very wide market. [[Cylinder seal]]s were both artistic and practical, and very widely used by what can be loosely called the middle class in the [[Ancient Near East]].&lt;ref name="Kipfer2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barbara Ann Kipfer|title=Encyclopedic Dictionary of Archaeology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XneTstDbcC0C|date=30 April 2000|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0-306-46158-3|page=264}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once [[coin]]s were widely used, these also became an art form that reached the widest range of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ancient Coins as Works of Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=34jbjgEACAAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=1960|publisher=Museum Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important innovation came in the 15th century in Europe, when [[printmaking]] began with small [[woodcut]]s, mostly religious, that were often very small and hand-colored, and affordable even by [[peasant]]s who glued them to the walls of their homes. Printed books were initially very expensive, but fell steadily in price until by the 19th century even the poorest could afford some with printed illustrations.&lt;ref name="Tucker2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Hugo Tucker|title=Forms of the "medieval" in the "Renaissance": A Multidisciplinary Exploration of a Cultural Continuum|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zfbNzcqgYM4C|year=2000|publisher=Rookwood Press|isbn=978-1-886365-20-9|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Popular prints]] of many different sorts have decorated homes and other places for centuries.&lt;ref name="Griffiths1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Antony Griffiths|title=Prints and Printmaking: An Introduction to the History and Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nbxFOR8ujlYC|year=1996|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-20714-1|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Public art|Public buildings and monuments]], secular and religious, by their nature normally address the whole of society, and visitors as viewers, and display to the general public has long been an important factor in their design. [[Egyptian temple]]s are typical in that the most largest and most lavish decoration was placed on the parts that could be seen by the general public, rather than the areas seen only by the priests.&lt;ref name="Vörös2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Győző Vörös|title=Egyptian Temple Architecture: 100 Years of Hungarian Excavations in Egypt, 1907-2007|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=StEyE9jkMHEC|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=2007|publisher=American Univ in Cairo Press|isbn=978-963-662-084-4|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many areas of royal palaces, castles and the houses of the social elite were often generally accessible, and large parts of the art collections of such people could often be seen, either by anybody, or by those able to pay a small price, or those wearing the correct clothes, regardless of who they were, as at the [[Palace of Versailles]], where the appropriate extra accessories (silver shoe buckles and a sword) could be hired from shops outside.&lt;ref name="Waldie1839"&gt;{{cite book|author=Adam Waldie|title=The Select Circulating Library|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cBs7AQAAIAAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=1839|publisher=A. Waldie.|page=367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Special arrangements were made to allow the public to see many royal or private collections placed in galleries, as with the [[Orleans Collection#Collection in Paris|Orleans Collection]] mostly housed in a wing of the [[Palais Royal]] in Paris, which could be visited for most of the 18th century.&lt;ref name="MeyerSavoy2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrea Meyer|author2=Benedicte Savoy|title=The Museum Is Open: Towards a Transnational History of Museums 1750-1940|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xhroBQAAQBAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=1 January 2014|publisher=De Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-029882-6|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy the art tourism of the [[Grand Tour]] became a major industry from the Renaissance onwards, and governments and cities made efforts to make their key works accessible. The British [[Royal Collection]] remains distinct, but large donations such as the [[Old Royal Library]] were made from it to the [[British Museum]], established in 1753. The [[Uffizi]] in [[Florence]] opened entirely as a gallery in 1765, though this function had been gradually taking the building over from the original civil servants' offices for a long time before.&lt;ref name="Fossi1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gloria Fossi|title=The Uffizi: The Official Guide : All of the Works|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lYUh_6F-hc8C|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=1999|publisher=Giunti Editore|isbn=978-88-09-01487-9|pages=8–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building now occupied by the [[Prado]] in Madrid was built before the French Revolution for the public display of parts of the royal art collection, and similar royal galleries open to the public existed in [[Vienna]], Munich and other capitals. The opening of the [[Musée du Louvre]] during the [[French Revolution]] (in 1793) as a public museum for much of the former French royal collection certainly marked an important stage in the development of public access to art, transferring ownership to a republican state, but was a continuation of trends already well established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Public Access to Art in Paris: A Documentary History from the Middle Ages to 1800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xpD9NgeQozEC|accessdate=28 May 2018|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=978-0-271-04434-7|pages=281–283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most modern public museums and art education programs for children in schools can be traced back to this impulse to have art available to everyone. Museums in the United States tend to be gifts from the very rich to the masses. ([[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City, for example, was created by [[John Taylor Johnston]], a railroad executive whose personal art collection seeded the museum.) But despite all this, at least one of the important functions of art in the 21st century remains as a marker of wealth and social status.&lt;ref name="Findlay2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Findlay|title=The Value of Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t6jJ5FvdLjcC|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=23 May 2012|publisher=Prestel Verlag|isbn=978-3-641-08342-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BeuysAchberg78.jpg|thumb|Performance by [[Joseph Beuys]], 1978: ''Everyone an artist – On the way to the libertarian form of the social organism'']]

There have been attempts by artists to create art that can not be bought by the wealthy as a status object. One of the prime original motivators of much of the art of the late 1960s and 1970s was to create art that could not be bought and sold. It is "necessary to present something more than mere objects"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=An Interview with Joseph Beuys |journal=ArtForum |date=December 1969 |first=Willoughby |last=Sharp |volume=8 |issue=4 |page=45 |id= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; said the major post war German artist Joseph Beuys. This time period saw the rise of such things as [[performance art]], [[video art]], and [[conceptual art]]. The idea was that if the artwork was a performance that would leave nothing behind, or was simply an idea, it could not be bought and sold. "Democratic precepts revolving around the idea that a work of art is a commodity impelled the aesthetic innovation which germinated in the mid-1960s and was reaped throughout the 1970s. Artists broadly identified under the heading of Conceptual art ... substituting performance and publishing activities for engagement with both the material and materialistic concerns of painted or sculptural form ... [have] endeavored to undermine the art object qua object."&lt;ref&gt;Rorimer, Anne: ''New Art in the 60s and 70s Redefining Reality'', p. 35. Thames and Hudson, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the decades since, these ideas have been somewhat lost as the art market has learned to sell limited edition DVDs of video works,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mia |last=Fineman |title=YouTube for Artists The best places to find video art online. |date=21 March 2007 |publisher= |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2162382/ |work=Slate |pages= |accessdate=3 August 2007 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; invitations to exclusive performance art pieces, and the objects left over from conceptual pieces. Many of these performances create works that are only understood by the elite who have been educated as to why an idea or video or piece of apparent garbage may be considered art. The marker of status becomes understanding the work instead of necessarily owning it, and the artwork remains an upper-class activity. "With the widespread use of DVD recording technology in the early 2000s, artists, and the gallery system that derives its profits from the sale of artworks, gained an important means of controlling the sale of video and computer artworks in limited editions to collectors."&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, Jean and Craig McDaniel: ''Themes of Contemporary Art, Visual Art after 1980'', p. 16. Oxford University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
[[File:JEAN LOUIS THÉODORE GÉRICAULT - La Balsa de la Medusa (Museo del Louvre, 1818-19).jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|[[Théodore Géricault]]'s ''[[The Raft of the Medusa|Raft of the Medusa]]'', ''circa'' 1820]]

Art has long been controversial, that is to say disliked by some viewers, for a wide variety of reasons, though most pre-modern controversies are dimly recorded, or completely lost to a modern view. [[Iconoclasm]] is the destruction of art that is disliked for a variety of reasons, including religious ones. [[Aniconism]] is a general dislike of either all figurative images, or often just religious ones, and has been a thread in many major religions. It has been a crucial factor in the history of [[Islamic art]], where [[depictions of Muhammad]] remain especially controversial. Much art has been disliked purely because it depicted or otherwise stood for unpopular rulers, parties or other groups. Artistic conventions have often been conservative and taken very seriously by [[art critic]]s, though often much less so by a wider public. The [[iconography|iconographic]] content of art could cause controversy, as with late medieval depictions of the new motif of the [[Swoon of the Virgin]] in scenes of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]]. [[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The ''Last Judgment'']] by [[Michelangelo]] was controversial for various reasons, including breaches of [[decorum]] through nudity and the [[Apollo]]-like pose of Christ.&lt;ref name="McCue2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Maureen McCue|title=British Romanticism and the Reception of Italian Old Master Art, 1793-1840|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xW43DAAAQBAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=23 May 2016|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-17148-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nickerson2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Angela K.

The content of much formal art through history was dictated by the patron or commissioner rather than just the artist, but with the advent of [[Romanticism]], and economic changes in the production of art, the artists' vision became the usual determinant of the content of his art, increasing the incidence of controversies, though often reducing their significance. Strong incentives for perceived originality and publicity also encouraged artists to court controversy. [[Théodore Géricault]]'s ''[[The Raft of the Medusa|Raft of the Medusa]]'' (c. 1820), was in part a political commentary on a recent event. [[Édouard Manet]]'s ''[[The Luncheon on the Grass|Le Déjeuner sur l'Herbe]]'' (1863), was considered scandalous not because of the [[nude]] woman, but because she is seated next to men fully dressed in the clothing of the time, rather than in robes of the antique world.&lt;ref name="RuprechtTaiana1995"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alvina Ruprecht|author2=Cecilia Taiana|title=Reordering of Culture: Latin America, the Caribbean and Canada in the Hood|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=onoI0AI-JJYC|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=15 November 1995|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP|isbn=978-0-88629-269-0|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stout2018"&gt;{{cite book|author=John C.

The gradual abandonment of naturalism and the depiction of realistic representations of the visual appearance of subjects in the 19th and 20th centuries led to a rolling controversy lasting for over a century. In the twentieth century, [[Pablo Picasso]]'s ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' (1937) used arresting [[cubism|cubist]] techniques and stark [[Monochrome painting|monochromatic oils]], to depict the harrowing consequences of a contemporary bombing of a small, ancient Basque town. [[Leon Golub]]'s ''Interrogation III'' (1981), depicts a female nude, hooded detainee strapped to a chair, her legs open to reveal her sexual organs, surrounded by two tormentors dressed in everyday clothing. [[Andres Serrano]]'s ''[[Piss Christ]]'' (1989) is a photograph of a crucifix, sacred to the Christian religion and representing [[Jesus Christ|Christ]]'s sacrifice and final suffering, submerged in a glass of the artist's own urine. The resulting uproar led to comments in the United States Senate about public funding of the arts.&lt;ref name="ChapmanCiment2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roger Chapman|author2=James Ciment|title=Culture Wars: An Encyclopedia of Issues, Viewpoints and Voices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XO9nBwAAQBAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=17 March 2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-47351-0|page=594}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Arthur Brown|title=Noah's Other Son: Bridging the Gap Between the Bible and the Qur'an|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JjbUAwAAQBAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=15 October 2008|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-0-8264-2996-4|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
{{Main|Aesthetics}}
Before Modernism, aesthetics in Western art was greatly concerned with achieving the appropriate balance between different aspects of [[Realism (arts)|realism or truth to nature]] and the [[Idealism|ideal]]; ideas as to what the appropriate balance is have shifted to and fro over the centuries.  This concern is largely absent in other traditions of art.  The aesthetic theorist [[John Ruskin]], who championed what he saw as the naturalism of [[J. M. W. Turner|J.&amp;nbsp;M.&amp;nbsp;W. Turner]], saw art's role as the communication by artifice of an essential truth that could only be found in nature.&lt;ref&gt;"go to nature in all [[singleness of heart]], rejecting nothing and selecting nothing, and scorning nothing, believing all things are right and good, and rejoicing always in the truth". [[John Ruskin|Ruskin, John]]. ''[[Modern Painters]]'', Volume I, 1843. London: Smith, Elder and Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition and evaluation of art has become especially problematic since the 20th century. [[Richard Wollheim]] distinguishes three approaches to assessing the aesthetic value of art: the [[Aesthetic realism|Realist]], whereby aesthetic quality is an absolute value independent of any human view; the [[Objectivity (philosophy)|Objectivist]], whereby it is also an absolute value, but is dependent on general human experience; and the [[Relativist]] [[Aesthetic relativism|position]], whereby it is not an absolute value, but depends on, and varies with, the human experience of different humans.&lt;ref&gt;Wollheim 1980, ''Essay VI''. pp. 231–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrival of Modernism===
[[File:Piet Mondriaan, 1930 - Mondrian Composition II in Red, Blue, and Yellow.jpg|thumb|''Composition II in Red, Blue, and Yellow'' (1930) by [[Piet Mondrian]] (Dutch, 1872–1944)]]
The arrival of [[Modernism]] in the late nineteenth century lead to a radical break in the conception of the function of art,&lt;ref&gt;Griselda Pollock, ''Differencing the Canon''. Routledge, London &amp; New York, 1999. {{ISBN|0-415-06700-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then again in the late twentieth century with the advent of [[Postmodern art|postmodernism]]. [[Clement Greenberg]]'s 1960 article "Modernist Painting" defines modern art as "the use of characteristic methods of a discipline to criticize the discipline itself".&lt;ref name = "Frascina"&gt;''Modern Art and Modernism: A Critical Anthology''. ed. Francis Frascina and Charles Harrison, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; Greenberg originally applied this idea to the Abstract Expressionist movement and used it as a way to understand and justify flat (non-illusionistic) abstract painting:
{{quote|Realistic, naturalistic art had dissembled the medium, using art to conceal art; modernism used art to call attention to art. The limitations that constitute the medium of painting—the flat surface, the shape of the support, the properties of the pigment—were treated by the Old Masters as negative factors that could be acknowledged only implicitly or indirectly. Under Modernism these same limitations came to be regarded as positive factors, and were acknowledged openly.&lt;ref name = "Frascina" /&gt;}} After Greenberg, several important art theorists emerged, such as [[Michael Fried]], [[T. J. Clark (historian)|T.&amp;nbsp;J.&amp;nbsp;Clark]], [[Rosalind Krauss]], [[Linda Nochlin]] and [[Griselda Pollock]] among others. Though only originally intended as a way of understanding a specific set of artists, Greenberg's definition of modern art is important to many of the ideas of art within the various art movements of the 20th century and early 21st century.&lt;ref name="Harris2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan P. Harris|title=Writing Back to Modern Art: After Greenberg, Fried, and Clark|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_TzAIu3LziIC|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=2005|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-32429-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Holt2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Kenneth Holt|title=The Search for Aesthetic Meaning in the Visual Arts: The Need for the Aesthetic Tradition in Contemporary Art Theory and Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VWedB7SA-KMC|year=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-89789-773-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pop art]]ists like [[Andy Warhol]] became both noteworthy and influential through work including and possibly critiquing popular culture, as well as the [[art world]]. Artists of the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s expanded this technique of self-criticism beyond ''high art'' to all cultural image-making, including fashion images, comics, billboards and pornography.&lt;ref name="Gemünden1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gerd Gemünden|title=Framed Visions: Popular Culture, Americanization, and the Contemporary German and Austrian Imagination|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Mpfn_pue34C|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=1998|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=978-0-472-08560-6|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New Yorker|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9BcnAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=2004|publisher=F-R Publishing Corporation|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duchamp once proposed that art is any activity of any kind- everything. However, the way that only certain activities are classified today as art is a social construction.&lt;ref name="Duchamp Interview Clip"&gt;{{YouTube|haon2DXWvLk|Duchamp Two Statements}}{{Dead link|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that there may be an element of truth to this. ''[[The Invention of Art: A Cultural History]]'' is an art history book which examines the construction of the modern system of the arts i.e. Fine Art. Shiner finds evidence that the older system of the arts before our modern system (fine art) held art to be any skilled human activity i.e. Ancient Greek society did not possess the term art but [[techne]]. Techne can be understood neither as art or craft, the reason being that the distinctions of art and [[craft]] are historical products that came later on in human history. Techne included painting, sculpting and music but also; cooking, medicine, [[horsemanship]], [[geometry]], [[carpentry]], [[prophecy]], and farming etc.&lt;ref name="BurgueteLam2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Maria Burguete|author2=Lui Lam|title=Arts: A Science Matter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zKmND2ImrGUC|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=2011|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-981-4324-93-9|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Criticism and the "intentional fallacy"===
Following Duchamp during the first half of the twentieth century, a significant shift to general aesthetic theory took place which attempted to apply aesthetic theory between various forms of art, including the literary arts and the visual arts, to each other. This resulted in the rise of the [[New Criticism]] school and debate concerning ''the intentional fallacy''. At issue was the question of whether the aesthetic intentions of the artist in creating the work of art, whatever its specific form, should be associated with the criticism and evaluation of the final product of the work of art, or, if the work of art should be evaluated on its own merits independent of the intentions of the artist.&lt;ref name="Waugh2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Patricia Waugh|title=Literary Theory and Criticism: An Oxford Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7LXMA_7Ko9YC|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-929133-5|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Colebrook1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Claire Colebrook|title=New Literary Histories: New Historicism and Contemporary Criticism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aT-8AAAAIAAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|year=1997|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-4987-3|page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, [[W. K. Wimsatt|William K. Wimsatt]] and [[Monroe Beardsley]] published a classic and controversial New Critical essay entitled "[[Intentional Fallacy|The Intentional Fallacy]]", in which they argued strongly against the relevance of an [[Authorial intentionality|author's intention]], or "intended meaning" in the analysis of a literary work. For Wimsatt and Beardsley, the words on the page were all that mattered; importation of meanings from outside the text was considered irrelevant, and potentially distracting.&lt;ref name="Roholt2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tiger C. Roholt|title=Key Terms in Philosophy of Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=US6aAAAAQBAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=10 October 2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4411-3246-8|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hick2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Darren Hudson Hick|title=Introducing Aesthetics and the Philosophy of Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L_S4DgAAQBAJ|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=24 August 2017|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-350-00691-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another essay, "[[Affective fallacy|The Affective Fallacy]]," which served as a kind of sister essay to "The Intentional Fallacy" Wimsatt and Beardsley also discounted the reader's personal/emotional reaction to a literary work as a valid means of analyzing a text. This fallacy would later be repudiated by theorists from the [[reader-response]] school of literary theory. Ironically, one of the leading theorists from this school, [[Stanley Fish]], was himself trained by New Critics. Fish criticizes Wimsatt and Beardsley in his essay "Literature in the Reader" (1970).&lt;ref&gt;Leitch, Vincent B. , et al., eds. ''The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism''. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

As summarized by Gaut and Livingston in their essay "The Creation of Art": "Structuralist and post-structuralists theorists and critics were sharply critical of many aspects of New Criticism, beginning with the emphasis on aesthetic appreciation and the so-called autonomy of art, but they reiterated the attack on biographical criticisms's assumption that the artist's activities and experience were a privileged critical topic."&lt;ref&gt;Gaut and Livingston, ''The Creation of Art'', p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; These authors contend that: "Anti-intentionalists, such as formalists, hold that the intentions involved in the making of art are irrelevant or peripheral to correctly interpreting art. So details of the act of creating a work, though possibly of interest in themselves, have no bearing on the correct interpretation of the work."&lt;ref name="Gaut and Livingston, p.6"&gt;Gaut and Livingston, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaut and Livingston define the intentionalists as distinct from formalists stating that: "Intentionalists, unlike formalists, hold that reference to intentions is essential in fixing the correct interpretation of works." They quote [[Richard Wollheim]] as stating that, "The task of criticism is the reconstruction of the creative process, where the creative process must in turn be thought of as something not stopping short of, but terminating on, the work of art itself."&lt;ref name="Gaut and Livingston, p.6"/&gt;

==="Linguistic turn" and its debate===
The end of the 20th century fostered an extensive debate known as the linguistic turn controversy, or the "innocent eye debate", and generally referred to as the structuralism-[[poststructuralism]] debate in the philosophy of art. This debate discussed the encounter of the work of art as being determined by the relative extent to which the conceptual encounter with the work of art dominates over the perceptual encounter with the work of art.&lt;ref&gt;''Philosophy for Architecture'', Branco Mitrovic, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Decisive for the linguistic turn debate in art history and the humanities were the works of yet another tradition, namely the [[structuralism]] of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] and the ensuing movement of [[poststructuralism]]. In 1981, the artist [[Mark Tansey]] created a work of art titled "The Innocent Eye" as a criticism of the prevailing climate of disagreement in the philosophy of art during the closing decades of the 20th century. Influential theorists include [[Judith Butler]], [[Luce Irigaray]], [[Julia Kristeva]], [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Jacques Derrida]]. The power of language, more specifically of certain rhetorical tropes, in art history and historical discourse was explored by [[Hayden White]]. The fact that language is ''not'' a transparent medium of thought had been stressed by a very different form of [[philosophy of language]] which originated in the works of [[Johann Georg Hamann]] and [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]].&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction to Structuralism'', Michael Lane, Basic Books University of Michigan, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ernst Gombrich]] and [[Nelson Goodman]] in his book ''[[Languages of Art|Languages of Art: An Approach to a Theory of Symbols]]'' came to hold that the conceptual encounter with the work of art predominated exclusively over the perceptual and visual encounter with the work of art during the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Languages of Art|Languages of Art: An Approach to a Theory of Symbols]]''. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1968. 2nd ed. Indianapolis: Hackett, 1976. Based on his 1960–61 [[John Locke lectures]].&lt;/ref&gt; He was challenged on the basis of research done by the Nobel prize winning psychologist [[Roger Sperry]] who maintained that the human visual encounter was not limited to concepts represented in language alone (the linguistic turn) and that other forms of psychological representations of the work of art were equally defensible and demonstrable. Sperry's view eventually prevailed by the end of the 20th century with aesthetic philosophers such as Nick Zangwill strongly defending a return to moderate aesthetic formalism among other alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Zangwill, "Feasible Aesthetic Formalism", ''Nous'', December 1999, pp. 610–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification disputes==
{{Main|Classificatory disputes about art}}
[[File:Marcel Duchamp, 1917, Fountain, photograph by Alfred Stieglitz.jpg|thumb|The original ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' by [[Marcel Duchamp]], 1917, photographed by [[Alfred Stieglitz]] at the [[Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession|291]] after the 1917 [[Society of Independent Artists]] exhibit. Stieglitz used a backdrop of ''The Warriors'' by [[Marsden Hartley]] to photograph the urinal. The exhibition entry tag can be clearly seen.&lt;ref name="Tomkins, p. 186"&gt;Tomkins, ''Duchamp: A Biography'', p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;]] Disputes as to whether or not to classify something as a work of art are referred to as classificatory disputes about art. Classificatory disputes in the 20th century have included [[cubist]] and [[impressionist]] paintings, [[Duchamp]]'s ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'', the movies, superlative imitations of [[J. S. G. Boggs|banknotes]], [[conceptual art]], and [[video games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Deborah Solomon |title=2003: the 3rd Annual Year in Ideas: Video Game Art |newspaper=The New York Times Magazine |date=14 December 2003 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/14/magazine/2003-the-3rd-annual-year-in-ideas-video-game-art.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher David Novitz has argued that disagreement about the definition of art are rarely the heart of the problem. Rather, "the passionate concerns and interests that humans vest in their social life" are "so much a part of all classificatory disputes about art" (Novitz, 1996). According to Novitz, classificatory disputes are more often disputes about societal values and where society is trying to go than they are about theory proper. For example, when the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' criticized [[Damien Hirst|Hirst]]'s and [[Tracey Emin|Emin]]'s work by arguing "For 1,000 years art has been one of our great civilising forces. Today, pickled sheep and soiled beds threaten to make barbarians of us all" they are not advancing a definition or theory about art, but questioning the value of Hirst's and Emin's work.&lt;ref&gt;Painter, Colin. ''Contemporary Art and the Home''. Berg Publishers, 2002. p. 12. {{ISBN|1-85973-661-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, [[Arthur Danto]], suggested a thought experiment showing that "the status of an artifact as work of art results from the ideas a culture applies to it, rather than its inherent physical or perceptible qualities. Cultural interpretation (an art theory of some kind) is therefore constitutive of an object's arthood."&lt;ref&gt;Dutton, Denis [http://www.denisdutton.com/tribal_art.htm "Tribal Art"] in ''[[Encyclopedia of Aesthetics]], edited by Michael Kelly (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998).''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Danto, Arthur.

Architecture is often included as one of the visual arts; however, like the [[decorative arts]], or advertising, it involves the creation of objects where the practical considerations of use are essential in a way that they usually are not in a painting, for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Glancey |first1=Jonathan |title=Is advertising art? |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/is-advertising-art-1593252.html |accessdate=23 June 2018 |work=The Independent |date=26 July 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Value judgment===
[[File:Aboriginal hollow log tomb.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Aboriginal hollow log tombs. National Gallery, [[Canberra]], Australia]]

Somewhat in relation to the above, the word ''art'' is also used to apply judgments of value, as in such expressions as "that meal was a work of art" (the cook is an artist),&lt;ref name="Potts2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joe Potts|title=The Kahuna Kit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6uu6lPR6EPQC|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=8 August 2011|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4567-8689-2|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "the art of deception", (the highly attained level of skill of the deceiver is praised). It is this use of the word as a measure of high quality and high value that gives the term its flavor of subjectivity. Making judgments of value requires a basis for criticism. At the simplest level, a way to determine whether the impact of the object on the senses meets the criteria to be considered ''art'' is whether it is perceived to be attractive or repulsive. Though perception is always colored by experience, and is necessarily subjective, it is commonly understood that what is not somehow aesthetically satisfying cannot be art. However, "good" art is not always or even regularly aesthetically appealing to a majority of viewers. In other words, an artist's prime motivation need not be the pursuit of the aesthetic. Also, art often depicts terrible images made for social, moral, or thought-provoking reasons. For example, [[Francisco Goya]]'s painting depicting the Spanish shootings of 3rd&amp;nbsp;of May 1808 is a graphic depiction of a firing squad executing several pleading civilians. Yet at the same time, the horrific imagery demonstrates Goya's keen artistic ability in composition and execution and produces fitting social and political outrage. Thus, the debate continues as to what mode of aesthetic satisfaction, if any, is required to define 'art'.&lt;ref name="AddisonBurgess2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nicholas Addison|author2=Lesley Burgess|title=Debates in Art and Design Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qOY10gcBeP8C|accessdate=28 May 2018|date=28 August 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-61887-8|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FergusonMansbach2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Yale H.

The assumption of new values or the rebellion against accepted notions of what is aesthetically superior need not occur concurrently with a complete abandonment of the pursuit of what is aesthetically appealing. Indeed, the reverse is often true, that the revision of what is popularly conceived of as being aesthetically appealing allows for a re-invigoration of aesthetic sensibility, and a new appreciation for the standards of art itself. Countless schools have proposed their own ways to define quality, yet they all seem to agree in at least one point: once their aesthetic choices are accepted, the value of the work of art is determined by its capacity to transcend the limits of its chosen medium to strike some universal chord by the rarity of the skill of the artist or in its accurate reflection in what is termed the ''[[zeitgeist]]''. Art is often intended to appeal to and connect with human emotion. It can arouse [[aesthetic]] or [[morality|moral]] feelings, and can be understood as a way of communicating these feelings. Artists express something so that their audience is aroused to some extent, but they do not have to do so consciously. Art may be considered an exploration of the [[human condition]]; that is, what it is to be human.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Graham |first1=Gordon |title=Philosophy of the arts: an introduction to aesthetics |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2368">The '''assignment of income doctrine''' is a [[judicial doctrine]] developed in [[United States]] [[case law]] by courts trying to limit [[tax evasion]].  The assignment of income doctrine seeks to "preserve the progressive rate structure of [[Internal Revenue Code|the Code]] by prohibiting the splitting of income among taxable entities."&lt;ref&gt;David Mattingly, Empty Forms:  Applying the Assignment of Income Doctrine to Contingent Liability Tax Shelters, 94 Georgetown Law Journal 1993, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[United States Supreme Court]] created the assignment of income doctrine in the ''[[Lucas v. Earl]]'' decision.&lt;ref&gt;    {{ussc|name=Lucas v. Earl|link=|volume=281|page=111|pin=|year=1930}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Supreme Court held that income from services is taxed to the party who performed the services.&lt;ref name="281 U.S. 111, 115 1930"&gt;''Lucas v. Earl,'' 281 U.S. at 115.&lt;/ref&gt; To elaborate on this principle, the decision used the metaphor that "the fruits cannot be attributed to a different tree from that on which they grew."&lt;ref name="281 U.S. 111, 115 1930"/&gt; The case is used to support the proposition that the substance of the transaction, rather than the form, is controlling for tax purposes.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=106542,00.html IRS article].&lt;/ref&gt; 

The doctrine was later expanded in the ''[[Helvering v. Horst]]'' decision to include income from property.&lt;ref name="Helvering"&gt;{{ussc|name=Helvering v. Horst|link=|volume=311|page=112|pin=|year=1940}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The decision relied on the principle that the power to dispose of income and the enjoyment of property's economic benefits is the equivalent of ownership.&lt;ref name="Helvering"/&gt;

==Impact==
This doctrine has important implications for taxpayers trying to shift their tax burden to another person. When assigning income to another person (particularly a family member) in the form of a gift, the courts will usually see it as a way to avoid tax and thus consider it “fruit.” Only in an arms-length sale do the courts see the “tree” itself being moved.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, Samuel A., ''Federal Income Taxation of Individuals:  Cases, Problems and Materials'' 155 (2d ed. 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ayaz Latif Palijo''' ([[Sindhi language|Sindhi]],{{lang-ur|اياز لطیف پلیجو}}) (born 15 November 1968, [[Hyderabad, Sindh]], [[Pakistan]]) is a politician, lawyer, activist, writer and teacher. Palijo is the president of Qomi Awami Tahreek (Peoples Movement) and central convener and founder of the Sindh Progressive Anti-Nationalist Alliance (SPANA). Since 2007, he has represented the left, objecting to the division of the southeastern [[Pakistan]] province of [[Sindh]]. He has often been criticized for his two-faced approach, portraying himself as a Nationalist while supporting MQM under the umbrella of Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA) in order to promote his hugely unsuccessful political career. His accomplishments include losing Provincial assembly seat to Jam Khan Shoro of PPP in 2013 General Elections.

He later became conversant in [[English language|English]], [[Saraiki dialect|Seraiki]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] and [[Persian language|Persian]].{{cn|date=November 2018}}

At age eleven, Palijo was central secretary general of the Gulan Jahra Barira and the Sujag Bar Tahreek, the children's wing of the Awami Tahreek. He was then a university student activist.

He received a degree in environment and development from the [[University of British Columbia]], [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]], [[Canada]]. Palijo also received a postgraduate degree in [[rural development]] from [[Sindh University]] and [[Wye College]], [[United Kingdom]].

Palijo received a LEAD (leadership in educational administrate doctorate) in the seventh cohort.&lt;ref name=PalijoAffiliation&gt;{{cite news|last=Affiliation|first=Party, Forums, Organization|title=Palijo affiliation with organizations|url=http://www.pakistanherald.com/Profile/Ayaz-Latif-Palijo-1350|accessdate=6 November 2013|newspaper=Pakistan Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"Today Sindh is passing famine like situation. Conspiracies are being made for disintegration of Sindh and Pakistan. People are committing suicide and selling their children due man-made price hike, water-shortage, crimes and corruption. We'll let Sindh be divided, How long the rulers embroil the people of Sindh in concocted stories? People are full of hatred and not contributing their part in struggle. Hugely participation of public and political groups irrespective of socio-political and religious affiliations proved that Sindh is divided."}}

=== Kalabagh Dam ===

Palijo is strongly against the construction of [[Kalabagh Dam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Kalabagh Dam is a death warrant for Sindh |last= |first= |date=17 September 2018 |website= tribune.com.pk |publisher=Express Tribune |archive-url= |archive-date= |dead-url= |accessdate=22 November 2018 |url= https://tribune.com.pk/story/1805036/1-kalabagh-dam-death-warrant-sindh/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3891">[[File:Lindner - Thumb sucking.jpg|thumb|right|Persistent [[thumb-sucking]] is considered a bad habit in children as it may affect the development of the teeth.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |page=320 |work=Paediatric Dentistry: Principles and Practice |title=Oral Habits |author=M. S. Muthu, M. Sivakumar |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=9788131210581 |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{Other uses|Bad Habits (disambiguation){{!}}Bad Habits}}

A '''bad habit''' is a negative behaviour pattern.  Common examples include: [[procrastination]], [[overspending]], [[nail-biting]] and spending too much time watching [[television]] or using a [[computer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Breaking Bad Habits|author=Suzanne LeVert, Gary R. McClain|year=2001|isbn=0028639863|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QYynTz-w-LQC|publisher=Alpha Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
It is not a misconception that it takes on average 66 days to break a habit. The amount of time it takes to break a habit is generally between 18 and 254 days. This should often be repeated once or maybe twice depending on what the habit is, something small like chewing fingernail should only have to be done once. larger habits like smoking should be repeated at twice but every one is different so it could be less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/ejsp.674 | volume=40 | issue=6 | title=How are habits formed: Modelling habit formation in the real world | year=2009 | journal=European Journal of Social Psychology | pages=998–1009 | author=Lally Phillippa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Will and intention==
A key factor in distinguishing a bad habit from an [[addiction]] or [[mental disease]] is the element of [[Self control|willpower]].  If a person still seems to have control over the behavior then it is just a [[Habit (psychology)|habit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Diseases of the Will: Alcohol and the Dilemmas of Freedom|author=Mariana Valverde|year=1998|isbn=0521644690|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kl5ugmvDgH0C|chapter=Disease or Habit? Alcoholism and the Exercise of Freedom}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Good intentions are able to override the negative effect of bad habits but their effect seems to be independent and additive &amp;mdash; the bad habits remain but are subdued rather than cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/62002770/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 |title=Good intentions, bad habits, and effects of forming implementation intentions on healthy eating |journal=European Journal of Social Psychology |volume=29 |issue=5–6 |pages=591–604 |date=21 Jun 1999 |author=Bas Verplanken, Suzanne Faes |doi=10.1002/(sici)1099-0992(199908/09)29:5/6&lt;591::aid-ejsp948&gt;3.0.co;2-h}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
The best time to correct a bad habit is immediately, before it becomes established.  So, bad habits are best prevented from developing in childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Making Families Work and What to Do When They Don't|author=Bill Borcherdt|isbn=0789000733|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NVDB5nijTWsC|publisher=Haworth Press|year=1996|pages=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cure==
There are many techniques for removing bad habits once they have become established. One good one is to go for between 21 and 28 days try as hard as possible not to give in to the habit then rewarding yourself at the end of it. Then try to go a week, if the habit remains repeat the process, this method is proven to have a high success rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=0440154138|title=Don't Say Yes When You Want to Say No|author=Herbert Fensterheim, Jean Baer|year=1975|publisher=Dell|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Aog4MHedR-kC&amp;pgis=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12659">In [[category theory]], the concept of '''catamorphism''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: [[wikt:κατά|κατά]] "downwards" and [[wikt:μορφή|μορφή]] "form, shape") denotes the unique [[homomorphism]] from an [[initial algebra]] into some other algebra.

In [[functional programming]], catamorphisms provide generalizations of ''[[Fold (higher-order function)|folds]]'' of [[List (computing)|lists]] to arbitrary [[algebraic data type]]s, which can be described as [[initial algebra]]s. 
The dual concept is that of [[anamorphism]] that generalize ''unfolds''. A [[Hylomorphism (computer science)|hylomorphism]] is the composition of an anamorphism followed by a catamorphism.

== Definition ==
Consider an [[Initial algebra|initial]] [[F-algebra|''F''-algebra]] (''A'', ''in'') for some [[endofunctor]] ''F'' of some [[category (mathematics)|category]] into itself. Here ''in'' is a [[morphism]] from ''FA'' to ''A''. Since it is initial, we know that whenever (''X'', ''f'') is another ''F''-algebra, i.e. a morphism ''f'' from ''FX'' to ''X'', there is a unique [[homomorphism]] ''h'' from (''A'', ''in'') to (''X'', ''f''). By the definition of the category of ''F''-algebras, this ''h'' corresponds to a morphism from ''A'' to ''X'', conventionally also denoted ''h'', such that &lt;math&gt;h \circ in = f \circ Fh&lt;/math&gt;. In the context of ''F''-algebras, the uniquely specified morphism from the initial object is denoted by '''cata''' '''''f''''' and hence characterized by the following relationship:

*&lt;math&gt;h = \mathrm{cata}\ f&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;h \circ in = f \circ Fh&lt;/math&gt;

== Terminology and history ==
Another notation found in the literature is &lt;math&gt;(\!|f|\!)&lt;/math&gt;. The open brackets used are known as '''banana brackets''', after which catamorphisms are sometimes referred to as ''bananas'', as mentioned in {{Harvnb|Meijer|1991}}. 
One of the first publications to introduce the notion of a catamorphism in the context of programming was the paper “Functional Programming with Bananas, Lenses, Envelopes and Barbed Wire”, by [[Erik Meijer (computer scientist)|Erik Meijer]] ''et al.'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was in the context of the [[Squiggol]] formalism.
The general categorical definition was given by [[Grant Malcolm]].

== Examples ==
We give a series of examples, and then a more global approach to catamorphisms, in the [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] programming language.

=== Iteration ===
Iteration-step prescriptions lead to natural numbers as initial object.

Consider the functor &lt;code&gt;fmaybe&lt;/code&gt; mapping a data type &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; to a data type &lt;code&gt;fmaybe b&lt;/code&gt;, which contains a copy of each term from &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; as well as one additional term &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt; (in Haskell, this is what &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; does). This can be encoded using one term and one function. So let an instance of a ''StepAlgebra'' also include a function from &lt;code&gt;fmaybe b&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;, which maps &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt; to a fixed term &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;, and where the actions on the copied terms will be called &lt;code&gt;next&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
type StepAlgebra b = (b, b-&gt;b) -- the algebras, which we encode as pairs (nil, next)

data Nat = Zero | Succ Nat -- which is the initial algebra for the functor described above

foldSteps :: StepAlgebra b -&gt; (Nat -&gt; b) -- the catamorphisms map from Nat to b
foldSteps (nil, next) Zero       = nil
foldSteps (nil, next) (Succ nat) = next $ foldSteps (nil, next) nat
&lt;/source&gt;

As a silly example, consider the algebra on strings encoded as &lt;code&gt;("go!", \s -&gt; "wait.. " ++ s)&lt;/code&gt;, for which &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt; is mapped to &lt;code&gt;"go!"&lt;/code&gt; and otherwise &lt;code&gt;"wait.. "&lt;/code&gt; is prepended. As &lt;code&gt;(Succ . Succ . Succ . Succ $ Zero)&lt;/code&gt; denotes the number four in &lt;code&gt;Nat&lt;/code&gt;, the following will evaluate to "wait.. wait.. wait.. wait.. go!": &lt;source lang="haskell" inline&gt;foldSteps ("go!", \s -&gt; "wait.. " ++ s) (Succ . Succ . Succ . Succ $ Zero)&lt;/source&gt;. We can easily change the code to a more useful operation, say repeated operation of an algebraic operation on numbers, just by changing the F-algebra &lt;code&gt;(nil, next)&lt;/code&gt;, which is passed to &lt;code&gt;foldSteps&lt;/code&gt;

=== List fold ===
For a fixed type &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, consider the functor mapping types &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; to the product type of those two types. We moreover also add a term &lt;code&gt;Nil&lt;/code&gt; to this resulting type. An f-algebra shall now map &lt;code&gt;Nil&lt;/code&gt; to some special term &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; or "merge" a pair (any other term of the constructed type) into a term of &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;. This merging of a pair can be encoded as a function of type &lt;code&gt;a -&gt; b -&gt; b&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
type ContainerAlgebra a b = (b, a -&gt; b -&gt; b) -- f-algebra encoded as (nil, merge)

data List a = Nil | Cons a (List a) -- which turns out to be the initial algbera

foldrList :: ContainerAlgebra a b -&gt; (List a -&gt; b) -- catamorphisms map from (List a) to b
foldrList (nil, merge) Nil         = nil
foldrList (nil, merge) (Cons x xs) = merge x $ foldrList (nil, merge) xs
&lt;/source&gt;

As an example, consider the algebra on numbers types encoded as &lt;code&gt;(3, \x-&gt; \y-&gt; x*y)&lt;/code&gt;, for which the number from &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; acts on the number from &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; by plain multiplication. Then the following will evaluate to 3.000.000: &lt;source lang="haskell" inline&gt;foldrList (3, \x-&gt; \y-&gt; x*y) (Cons 10 $ Cons 100 $ Cons 1000 Nil)&lt;/source&gt;

=== Tree fold ===
For a fixed type &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, consider the functor mapping types &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; to a type that contains a copy of each term of &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; as well as all pairs of &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;'s (terms of the product type of two instances of the type &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;). An algebra consists of a function to &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;, which either acts on an &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; term or two &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; terms. This merging of a pair can be encoded as two functions of type &lt;code&gt;a -&gt; b&lt;/code&gt; resp. &lt;code&gt;b -&gt; b -&gt; b&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
type TreeAlgebra a b = (a -&gt; b, b -&gt; b -&gt; b) -- the "two cases" function is encoded as (f, g)
 
data Tree a = Leaf a | Branch (Tree a) (Tree a) -- which turns out to be the initial algebra
 
foldTree :: TreeAlgebra a b -&gt; (Tree a -&gt; b) -- catamorphisms map from (Tree a) to b
foldTree (f, g) (Leaf x)            = f x
foldTree (f, g) (Branch left right) = g (foldTree (f, g) left) (foldTree (f, g) right)
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
treeDepth :: TreeAlgebra a Integer -- an f-algebra to numbers, which works for any input type
treeDepth = (const 1, \i j -&gt; 1 + max i j)
 
treeSum :: (Num a) =&gt; TreeAlgebra a a -- an f-algebra, which works  for any number type 
treeSum = (id, (+))
&lt;/source&gt;

=== General case ===
Deeper category theoretical studies of initial algebras reveal that the F-algebra obtained from applying the functor to its own initial algebra is isomorphic to it.

Strong type systems enable us to abstractly specify the initial algebra of a functor &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; as its fixed point ''a = f a''. The recursively defined catamorphisms can now be coded in single line, where the case analysis (like in the different examples above) is encapsulated by the fmap. Since the domain of the latter are objects in the image of &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt;, the evaluation of the catamorphisms jumps back and forth between &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;f a&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
type Algebra f a = f a -&gt; a -- the generic f-algebras

newtype Fix f = Iso { invIso :: f (Fix f) } -- gives us the initial algebra for the functor f

cata :: Functor f =&gt; Algebra f a -&gt; (Fix f -&gt; a) -- catamorphism from Fix f to a
cata alg = alg . fmap (cata alg) . invIso -- note that invIso and alg map in opposite directions
&lt;/source&gt;

Now again the first example, but now via passing the Maybe functor to Fix. Repeated application of the Maybe functor generates a chain of types, which, however, can be united by the isomorphism from the fixed point theorem. We introduce the term &lt;code&gt;zero&lt;/code&gt;, which arises from Maybes's &lt;code&gt;Nothing&lt;/code&gt; and identify a successor function with repeated application of the &lt;code&gt;Just&lt;/code&gt;. This way the natural numbers arise.

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
type Nat = Fix Maybe
zero :: Nat
zero = Iso Nothing -- every 'Maybe a' has a term Nothing, and Iso maps it into a
successor :: Nat -&gt; Nat
successor = Iso . Just -- Just maps a to 'Maybe a' and Iso maps back to a new term
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
pleaseWait :: Algebra Maybe String -- again the silly f-algebra example from above
pleaseWait (Just string) = "wait.. " ++ string
pleaseWait Nothing = "go!"
&lt;/source&gt;

Again, the following will evaluate to "wait.. wait.. wait.. wait.. go!": &lt;code&gt;cata pleaseWait (successor.successor.successor.successor $ zero)&lt;/code&gt;

And now again the tree example. For this we must provide the tree container data type so that we can set up the &lt;code&gt;fmap&lt;/code&gt; (we didn't have to do it for the &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; functor, as it's part of the standard prelude).

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
data Tcon a b = TconL a | TconR b b
instance Functor (Tcon a) where
    fmap f (TconL x)   = TconL x
    fmap f (TconR y z) = TconR (f y) (f z)
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
type Tree a = Fix (Tcon a) -- the initial algebra
end :: a -&gt; Tree a
end = Iso . TconL
meet :: Tree a -&gt; Tree a -&gt; Tree a
meet l r = Iso $ TconR l r
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
treeDepth :: Algebra (Tcon a) Integer -- again, the treeDepth f-algebra example
treeDepth (TconL x)   = 1
treeDepth (TconR y z) = 1 + max y z
&lt;/source&gt;

The following will evaluate to 4: &lt;code&gt;cata treeDepth $ meet (end "X") (meet (meet (end "YXX") (end "YXY")) (end "YY"))&lt;/code&gt;

'''Catholic peace traditions''' begin with its biblical and classical origins to the current practice in the 21st century. Because of its long history and breadth of geographical and cultural diversity, this Catholic tradition encompasses many strains and influences of both religious and secular [[peacemaking]] and many aspects of [[Christian pacifism]], [[just war]] and [[nonviolence]].

Catholic tradition as a whole supports and favors peacemaking efforts.&lt;ref name=Kemmetmueller&gt;[http://www.monitor.upeace.org/pdf/Peace_Catholicism.pdf Kemmetmueller, Donna Jean. "Peace: The Challenge of Living the Catholic Tradition", ''Peace and Conflict Monitor''. May 9, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; Peacemaking is an integral part of [[Catholic Social Teaching]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicsocialteaching.org.uk/principles/glossary/#Peace "Glossary", CatholicSocialTeaching.org.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
[[File:2008. Донецк 122.jpg|thumb|2008. Angel of peace in Donetsk]]

The history of peacemaking in the Catholic tradition reflects the religious meanings of peace, tied to positive virtues, such as love, and to the personal and social works of justice. The Greek word for peace is ''eirene''; Roman ''pax'', and in the [[Hebrew Bible]], ''shalom''.

For the earliest Romans, "pax" meant to live in a state of agreement, where discord and war were absent. In his ''Meditations'', or ''To Himself,'' the Roman Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] expresses peace as a state of unperturbed tranquility. The English word "peace" derives ultimately from its root, the Latin "pax".

Shalom ({{lang-he|שלום}}) is the word for peace in the [[Hebrew Bible]] (''[[Tanakh]]'' or {{lang-he|תנ"ך}}), and has  other meanings also pertaining to well being, including use as a greeting.

===''Eirene''===
The Greek meaning for peace, contained in the word ''eirene'', evolved over the course of Greco-Roman civilization from such agricultural meanings as prosperity, fertility, and security of home contained in [[Hesiod]]’s ''Works and Days'', to more internal meanings of peace formulated by the Stoics, such as [[Epictetus]].

''Eirene'' is the word that the New Testament generally uses for peace, one of the twenty words used by the [[Septuagint]], the Greek version of the Hebrew Bible used in the largely Greek-speaking Jewish communities throughout the Greco-Roman world. It is chiefly through the Septuagint’s use of Greek that the Greek word ''eirene'' became infused with all the religious imagery and richness of the word ''shalom'' in the Hebrew Bible that had evolved over the history of the Jewish people. Subsequently, the use of the Greek Bible as the basis for [[St. Jerome]]’s [[Vulgate]] translation into Latin then brought all the new meanings of ''eirene'' to the Latin word ''pax'' and transformed it from a term for an imposed order of the sword, the ''Pax Romana'', into the chief image of peace for Western Christianity.&lt;ref name=Musto&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rzItAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Eirene Musto, Ronald G., ''The Catholic Peace Tradition'', Orbis Books, 1986] {{ISBN|9780883442630}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Testament==
[[File:Giotto - Scrovegni - -31- - Kiss of Judas.jpg|thumb|130px|Christ in Gethsemane commands Peter to lay down his sword (fresco by [[Giotto]])]]

The Gospels present the birth of Jesus as ushering in a new age of peace. In Luke, [[Zechariah (priest)|Zechariah]] celebrates his son [[John the Baptist|John]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;And you, child, will be called prophet of the Most High, for you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways, to give his people knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness of their sins, because of the tender mercy of our God by which the daybreak from on high will visit us to shine on those who sit in darkness and death's shadow, to guide our feet into the path of peace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PWK.HTM "Luke 1: 76-79", ''The New American Bible'', United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And later, the angels appear to the shepherds at Bethlehem, "And suddenly there was a multitude of the heavenly host with the angel, praising God and saying: 'Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests'"{{sfn|NAB, Luke 2:13-14}} – a peace distinct from the [[Pax Romana]].{{sfn|NAB, Luke 2, n.6}}
 
The [[Sermon on the Mount]] (Mt. 5:1-16) and the [[Sermon on the Plain]] (Lk. 6:20-45) combine with the call to "love your enemies" (Mt. 5:38-48) to encapsulate Jesus' teachings on peacemaking. According to [[Gabriel Moran]], the Sermon on the Mount does not advocate submission to oppressors, but rather a strategy to "de-hostilize enemies in order to win them over".&lt;ref name=Moran&gt;[http://www.nyu.edu/classes/gmoran/NONVIOLENCE.pdf Moran, Gabriel. "Roman Catholic Tradition and Passive Resistance", New York University]&lt;/ref&gt;

The account of the healing of the centurion's servant suggests to John Eppstein that Jesus did not view military service as sinful, since rather than reprove the soldier for his profession, Jesus praised him for his faith. Nor did [[Saint Peter|Peter]] require Cornelius to resign his commission or desert upon being baptized.&lt;ref name=Eppstein&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IESe7m8Obe4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Catholic+peace+traditions&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SjsJVNrRAfOAsQT3rYDIAg&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Catholic%20peace%20traditions&amp;f=false Eppstein, John. ''The Catholic Tradition of the Law of Nations'', Burns &amp; Oates, London, 1935]&lt;/ref&gt; John the Baptist's advice to soldiers was, "Do not practice extortion, do not falsely accuse anyone, and be satisfied with your wages." {{sfn|NAB, Luke 3:14}}

==Early Church==
Early Christianity was relatively pacifist.&lt;ref name=McCormick&gt;[http://www.bc.edu/content/bc/schools/lsoe/cce/highered/iache/Institutereadingmaterials/jcr%3Acontent/content/download_3/file.res/McCormick.pdf McCormick, Patrick. "Catholic Social Teaching &amp; the Catholic Intellectual Tradition", The Catholic University]&lt;/ref&gt; Clement of Alexandria wrote, "“If you enroll as one of God’s people, heaven is your country and God your lawgiver. And what are his laws? You shall not kill, You shall love your neighbor as yourself. To him that strikes you on the one cheek, turn to him the other also.” (Protrepticus 10)
&lt;ref name=cpf&gt;[http://www.catholicpeacefellowship.org/downloads/church_teaching_quotes.pdf "Selected Quotations", ''War, Peace and Conscience in the Catholic Tradition'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The early Christians anticipated the eminent return of the Lord in glory, even to the extant that [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] had to tell some of them to get back to work.{{sfn|NAB, 2 Thess 3: 10}} Generally they were not deeply involved in the larger community. As it became apparent that a more nuanced understanding was called for, Christians came to realize that if they were to survive socially they could not remain within the confines of their own community.&lt;ref name=Massaro&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TXTGAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=Christians+in+the+Roman+Army+and+the+Catholic+tradition+of+peace&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tdtV9iGu5S&amp;sig=IjL4vvTD3nBHwv2KToyhJidpETs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hDcKVLTIO7TCsATHrYCYBg&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Christians%20in%20the%20Roman%20Army%20and%20the%20Catholic%20tradition%20of%20peace&amp;f=false Massaro, S.J. and Shannon, Thomas A., ''Catholic Perspectives on Peace and War'', Sheed &amp; Ward, 2003] {{ISBN|9781461667421}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christians in the Roman Army ===
[[File:Simone Martini 028.jpg|thumb|left|120px|St Martin leaves the life of chivalry and renounces the army (fresco by [[Simone Martini]])]]
St. Paul wrote, "Let every person be subordinate to the higher authorities, for there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been established by God. ...This is why you also pay taxes, for the authorities are ministers of God, devoting themselves to this very thing. Pay to all their dues, taxes to whom taxes are due, toll to whom toll is due, respect to whom respect is due, honor to whom honor is due."{{sfn|NAB, Romans 13: 1-7}}

The early Christian church believed that Christians should not take up arms in any war,&lt;ref name=Moran/&gt; and so struggled attempting to balance the obligation to be a good citizen and the question of whether it was permissible to take up arms to defend one's country. There developed a gap between the reasoning of the moral theorists and the practice of the private citizen.

As early as second century, Christians began to participate in Roman military, police, and government in large numbers.&lt;ref name=Philpott/&gt; Military service was one way available to make a living, and on the borders of the empire there was a need to defend against barbarian incursions. As the army came to take on duties more in the line of police work: traffic and customs control, firefighting, the apprehension of criminals and bandits, maintaining the peace, quelling street brawls, and performing the roles of engineering, clearance, and other works of building for which the Roman army was well known, this choice became less problematic.&lt;ref name=Massaro/&gt; The numbers of soldiers that came to be counted among the later martyrs indicates that many Christians served in the military, despite their abhorrence of war.&lt;ref name=Eppstein/&gt;

From about the middle of the second century, officers in the Roman army were expected to participate in the Imperial Cult and sacrifice to the emperor. During the reign of Diocletian this obligation was extended to the lower ranks, as a test for those suspected of being Christian. Christians were therefore counseled not to enlist so as to avoid needless blood guilt and the risk of idolatry, but should nonetheless continue to pray for the civil authorities.&lt;ref name=Eppstein/&gt;
  
Among the better-known soldier saints are [[Saint Marinus]], [[Marcellus of Tangier]], and [[Maximilian of Tebessa]], and [[Martin of Tours]].

Persecutions were sporadic and the third century, largely local. By and large the Roman government didn’t pay much attention to Christianity.&lt;ref name=Philpott/&gt;

Christians sought to live the injunction to love their enemies while resisting their evil, even if this involved persecution and death: these were the [[Christian martyrs|martyrs]]. The word ''“martyr”'' is the Greek for “witness.” The early martyrs followed a long-standing tradition; [[John the Baptist]] was beheaded for "speaking truth to power". They also had as examples St. [[Stephen]], the apostles [[James, son of Zebedee|James]], [[Philip the Apostle|Philip]], and [[Matthew the Apostle|Matthew]], and others.&lt;ref name=Philpott&gt;[http://ocw.nd.edu/peace-studies/catholicism-and-politics/lectures/the-early-church Philpott, Daniel. "The Early Church", Notre Dame University] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140906020731/http://ocw.nd.edu/peace-studies/catholicism-and-politics/lectures/the-early-church |date=2014-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sufferings of the martyrs were therefore not an act of suicide or some masochistic form of passive weakness that found its fulfillment in torture and death at the hands of the Romans. Theirs was an act of commitment carried out in the public arena, designed to show the enemy that what is worth living for is also worth dying for. According to [[Josephine Laffin]], martyrdom demonstrated to all that Christ had overcome  death, and that the Holy Spirit sustained the Church in its fight against darkness and evil.&lt;ref name=Laffin&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=W1lmLyFzdkIC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=Martyrs+and+the+Catholic+tradition+of+peace&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=k0kKVLTrIsTlsAT8rgE&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Martyrs%20and%20the%20Catholic%20tradition%20of%20peace&amp;f=false Laffin, Josephine.

====Martyrs of Cordoba====
[[File:Spain Andalusia Cordoba BW 2015-10-27 13-54-14.jpg|thumb|left|220px|The Mosque in Cordoba. Photo:Timor Espallargas]]
 
The [[Martyrs of Córdoba]] were forty-eight Christian martyrs living in the 9th century Muslim-ruled Al-Andalus. Their hagiography describes in detail their executions for deliberately sought capital violations of Muslim law in Al-Andalus. The martyrdoms recorded by [[Eulogius of Cordoba|Eulogius]] took place between 851 and 859; with few exceptions, the Christians invited execution by making public statements tactically chosen to invite martyrdom by appearing before the Muslim authorities to denounce Islam. The martyrs caused tension not only between Muslims and Christians, but within the Christian community. In December 852 Church leaders called a council in Cordoba, which honored those fallen but called on Christians to refrain from seeking martyrdom.

Recent historical interpretation of the martyr movement reflect questions on its nature. Kenneth Baxter Wolf sees its cause in “spiritual anxiety” and the penitential aspect of 9th century Iberian Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, Kenneth Baxter. ''Christian Martyrs in Muslim Spain,'' New York: Cambridge University Press, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; Clayton J. Drees&lt;ref&gt;“Sainthood and Suicide. The Motives of the Martyrs of Córdoba, A.D. 850-859,” ''Journal of Medieval and Renaissance Studies'' 20, 1, 1990: 59-89&lt;/ref&gt; sees their motives in a “pathological death-wish, the product of unexpressed hatred toward society that had turned inward against themselves” and other innate “psychological imbalances.” Jessica A. Coope suggests that it reflects a protest against the process of assimilation, and that the martyrs demonstrated a determination to assert Christian identity.&lt;ref name=Coope&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=es&amp;id=vf1JAz1g-cgC&amp;q=Perfectus#v=snippet&amp;q=Perfectus&amp;f=false Coope, Jessica A., ''The Martyrs of C¢rdoba: Community and Family Conflict in an Age of Mass Conversion", p. 14, University of Nebraska Press, 1995] {{ISBN|9780803214712}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Age of Constantine===
[[File:Rome-Capitole-StatueConstantin.jpg|thumb|130px|Bust of Constantine. (Rome, Capitoline Museum)]]

With the triumph of [[Constantine I|Constantine]] as sole Roman emperor in 313, the church of the martyrs now found itself an accepted and favored religion, soon to become the official religion of the state. Constantine had an emblem inscribed on the shields of his soldiers that has been various described as representing the "Unconquerable Sun" or as a [[Chi-Rho]]. [[Eileen Egan]] quotes Burkhardt's observation that this was "an emblem which every man could interpret as he pleased, but which the Christians would refer to themselves."&lt;ref name=Egan/&gt;

As the religion of the empire, its survival was tied to the fate of the Empire. The threat of increased barbarian incursions therefore threatened both, and defense of the Empire was appropriate in order to protect Christianity.  The early trend toward pacifism became muted.&lt;ref name=Massaro/&gt;

[[Ambrose of Milan]], former Pretorian Prefect of northern Italy before being elected bishop of Milan, preserved the Christian presumption against the use of violence, unless it was needed to protect important social values. While rejecting resorting to violence in self-defense, he argued that charity demanded one protect one’s neighbour.&lt;ref name=Duncan&gt;[http://www.socialjustice.catholic.org.au/publications/discussion-guides/133-the-struggle-to-develop-a-just-war-tradition-in-the-west Duncan C.Ss.R., Bruce.

''Peace Be with You: Justified Warfare or the Way of Nonviolence'', Wipf and Stock Publishers, 2004] {{ISBN|9781592447978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Empress Justina sought to have the new basilica in Milan turned over to the Arians, Ambrose, supported by the faithful, occupied it himself in what Egan identifies as an example of non-violent resistance.&lt;ref name=Egan/&gt;

=== Augustine of Hippo ===
{{Main article|Just war theory}}
Following Ambrose, [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] thought that the Christian, in imitation of Jesus, should not use violence to defend himself, but  however, had an obligation to aid a victim under attack.&lt;ref name=Moran/&gt;

Augustine of Hippo agreed strongly with the conventional wisdom of his time, that Christians should be pacifists philosophically, but that they should use defense as a means of preserving peace in the long run. He routinely argued that pacifism did not prevent the defence of innocents. In essence, the pursuit of peace might require fighting to preserve it in the long-term.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120728203512/http://www.crusades-encyclopedia.com/augustineofhippo.html St. Augustine of Hippo], Crusades-Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; Such a war must not be preemptive, but defensive, to restore peace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jknirp.com/mattox.htm Saint Augustine and the Theory of Just War]&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine drew on Roman tradition to view a "just war" as one prosecuted under lawful authority for a just cause, i.e., repelling aggression or injury, retaking something wrongly seized, or to punish wrongdoing. Later other theorists expanded on this. War must be the last resort, have a reasonable chance of success, and produce more good than harm. The church also argued that non-combatants must be protected.&lt;ref name=McCormick/&gt;

Augustine drew no distinction between offensive and defensive wars, since remedying injuries was a just cause apart from defence.&lt;ref name=Duncan/&gt; Against the threat of chaos and breakdown of civil order, a man may wage war justly but lament his unavoidable duty.&lt;ref&gt;Markus, R.A., "Saint Augustine’s Views on the 'Just War'", ''Sacred and Secular: Studies on Augustine and Latin Christianity'', p.9-10, (Variorum, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Barbarian Invasions===
During Augustine's last days Vandals invaded North Africa. Barbarian incursions which later swept Europe in succeeding centuries resulted in a collapse of learning and culture, and population decline.&lt;ref name=Duncan/&gt; There is a long historical tradition that has collected ample evidence to show that the Roman Empire itself was undergoing profound social, economic, and spiritual changes that were only hastened by the invasions. As the Western Empire crumbled the Church became the stabilizing force for order and peace.

The Christian peacemakers of this period were not the dominant cultural or political force of their time, but were either marginalized minorities — as in the case of the Roman Empire or — as in the case of the missionaries who evangelized the barbarians — were actually reaching out from an oppressive and collapsing world to an anarchic one that offered the seeds of a new society. Among the more important figures of active peacemaking or of intellectual life worth further study were [[Martin of Tours]], [[Salvian of Marseilles]], [[Nicetas of Remesiana]], [[Germanus of Auxerre]], [[Severinus of Noricum]], [[St. Patrick]], [[St. Genevieve]] of Paris, [[Columban]], and [[St. Boniface]] of Crediton.

==Monasticism==
[[File:Tentation de Saint Antoine.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Hieronymous Bosch, Temptation of St. Anthony. Madrid, Prado Museum]]

It is no coincidence that the appearance of the first monks comes within a few years of Constantine’s assumption of power and the alliance of church and empire that he forged. [[Thomas Merton]] identified one of the reasons individuals sought out the desert. was that they "declined to be ruled by men, but had no desire to rule over others themselves'.&lt;ref&gt;Merton, Thomas. ''The Wisdom of the Desert'', New Directions Publishing, 1970, {{ISBN|9780811201025}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others sought to imitate Jesus' own time spent in the desert.

Monasticism was, in a sense, a continuation of martyrdom, reaffirming the contradiction between the Church and the world, by fleeing from the corruption of civilization in order to seek a greater treasure.&lt;ref name=Hitchcock&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8nt_n7wuugAC&amp;pg=PA74&amp;dq=Monasticism+and+the+Catholic+tradition+of+peace&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_3kKVJqTNdXbsATyn4Io&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAjge#v=onepage&amp;q=Monasticism%20and%20the%20Catholic%20tradition%20of%20peace&amp;f=false Hitchcock, James. ''History of the Catholic Church: From the Apostolic Age to the Third Millennium'', Ignatius Press, 2012] {{ISBN|9781586176648}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian monasticism started in Egypt, then spread to Palestine, Syria, Mesopotamia, and finally to Italy and southern Gaul. [[Anthony the Hermit]] (c.251-356), the founder of monasticism, and [[Pachomius]] (c.290-346) were the prototypes.

=== Penitentials ===
The penitentials, written by Irish monks, were a series of manuals designed for priests who heard confessions that specified certain penances for certain categories of sins. These “penitentials” borrowed inspiration and specific regulations from the early church councils, monastic rules, and the letters of popes and bishops. Many of the regulations at first paralleled those aimed at insuring the special status of the clergy, including its nonviolence, but were gradually extended to the lay population. Penances ranged from fasting on bread and water for week, paying compensation to victims in money, goods or property, exile, pilgrimage, and excommunication. Readmission to Christian community was possible only after the completion of the prescribed penance.

These manuals proved to be such a concise and effective method for conceptualizing and standardizing notions of sin and repentance that they spread from Ireland to the Continent in a wide variety of collections that became enshrined in official collections of church law by the twelfth century. The penitentials are of great value for studying early medieval notions of violence, its seriousness and its consequences in a variety of actions, circumstances, and classes of victims.

The texts assign penances for killing in wartime, even under the lawful command of legitimate authority.&lt;ref name=Winwright&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IT0jKKtIasUC&amp;pg=PA304&amp;dq=Penitentials+and+the+Catholic+tradition+of+peace&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DYwKVJaDE6_jsASQg4HQDw&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Penitentials%20and%20the%20Catholic%20tradition%20of%20peace&amp;f=false Winwright, Tobias.

Following Augustine, war was seen as inherently sinful, and at best the lesser of two evils.&lt;ref name=Allman&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WYRDduxlVf4C&amp;pg=PA171&amp;dq=Penitentials+and+the+Catholic+tradition+of+peace&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cZAKVNWIFMjhsATQ0IDoDg&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Penitentials%20and%20the%20Catholic%20tradition%20of%20peace&amp;f=false Allman, Mark.

==The Middle Ages==
[[File:Couronnement d'un prince - Sacramentaire de Charles le Chauve Lat1141 f2v.jpg|thumb|Charles the Bald with Popes Gelasius I and Gregory I. From the Sacramentary of Charles the Bald (ca. 870)]]

The Carolingian period saw the emergence of both a renewed Roman Empire of the West and the beginning of fresh barbarian invasions from the north and east and the rise of Islam. Internal efforts to legislate the life of the Christian Republic were therefore matched by its external defense against invasions by the [[Vikings]], [[Magyars]], and [[Saracens]]. The problems and conditions were in many ways similar to those of Christian thinkers under the late Roman Empire when the state was identified with Christian society. The [[Carolingian Empire]] thus brought a renewed militarization of society that sought to protect Christendom from external threat, while it used the hierarchical bonds of [[feudal]] oaths and [[vassalage]] to bring the new class of mobile horse warriors, the ''milities'', to some semblance of central authority. War took on a religious dimension as evidenced by liturgical formulae for the blessings of armies and weapons.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_CCjUVzFWI4C&amp;pg=PA147&amp;lpg=PA147&amp;dq=Medieval+Peace+of+God&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XT9FAGLsG_&amp;sig=ShgxrRhPueknMezp6bMD-M_It_Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DeYNVO3XM_KTsQSexIHoBw&amp;ved=0CFwQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Medieval%20Peace%20of%20God&amp;f=false "Peace and War in Early eleventh Century Acquitaine", ''Medieval Knighthood IV: Papers from the Fifth Strawberry Hill Conference 1990'', p. 169, Boydell &amp; Brewer, 1992] {{ISBN|9780851153193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The close identification of the Carolingian Empire with the extent of Western Christianity revived the late Roman associations of ''Christianitas'' ([[Christendom]]) with the ''orbis Romanus'' or ''oikoumene'' (the Roman world). On the most official levels Christian peace necessitated its defense against the attacks of external enemies.

Christian peace involved the monastic or ascetic peace of a pure heart and life devoted to prayer; the episcopal peace, or pax ecclesiae, of a properly functioning free and unified church; and the social or imperial peace of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Renna, Thomas. “The Idea of Peace in the West,” Journal of Medieval History 6 (1980): 143–67&lt;/ref&gt; These often overlapped.

Carolingian theory established two, separate, ecclesiastical and secular spheres of authority within Christian society, one to lead the body and one the spirit. Monastic life was supported, and encouraged; while late Roman prohibitions against clerical participation in the army were repeated again and again. Among the thinkers and writers on issues of peace and peacemaking were [[Alcuin of York]], [[Smaragdus of Saint-Mihiel]], [[Paschasius Radbertus]], and [[Hincmar of Rheims]]. In keeping with their time, these offered various interpretations of peace as an inner tranquillity, legal guidelines to war and the curbing of military violence, or the image of peace as an ideal Christian state.

===The Cain Adomnan=== 
{{Main article|Cain Adomnan}}
The '''''Cáin Adomnáin''''' (Law of Adomnán), also known as the ''Lex Innocentium'' (Law of Innocents) was promulgated amongst a gathering of [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Dál Riata]]n and [[Picts|Pictish]] notables at the [[Synod of Birr]] in [[697 in Ireland|697]]. It is named after its initiator [[Adomnán of Iona]], ninth [[Abbot of Iona]] after St. [[Columba]]. As a successor of Columba of Iona, Adomnán had sufficient prestige to assemble a conference of ninety-one chieftains and clerics from Ireland, Dál Riata, and Pictland at Birr to promulgate the new law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://birrhistsoc.com/Hist.htm#cain "Cain Adomnan", Birr Historical Society]&lt;/ref&gt; As well as being the site of a significant monastery, associated with Saint [[Brendan of Birr]], Birr was close to the boundary between the Uí Néill-dominated northern half of Ireland, and the southern half, where the kings of Munster ruled. It therefore represented a neutral ground where the rival kings and clerics of north and south Ireland could meet.

This set of laws were designed, among other things, to guarantee the safety and immunity of various types of non-combatants in warfare.&lt;ref name=foghlam&gt;[http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/scotlandshistory/britonsgaelsvikings/lawoftheinnocents/index.asp "Law of the Innocents", Foghlam Alba] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141002105207/http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/scotlandshistory/britonsgaelsvikings/lawoftheinnocents/index.asp |date=2014-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The laws provided sanctions against the killing of children, clerics, clerical students and peasants on clerical lands; against rape, against impugning the chastity of a noblewoman, and prohibited women from having to take part in warfare. Various factors, including Marian devotion in seventh- and eighth-century Ireland, may have contributed to inspire Adomnán to introduce these laws. Many of these things were already crimes, under the Irish [[Early Irish Law|Brehon Laws]]. The law described both the secular fines which criminals must pay, and the ritual curses to which law-breakers were subject.

The indigenous [[Brehon Laws]] were committed to parchment about the 7th century, most likely by clerics. Most scholars now believe that the secular laws were not compiled independently of monasteries. Adomnan would have had access to the best legal minds of his generation.&lt;ref name=Grigg/&gt; Adomnan's ''Cain'' combined aspects of the traditional Brehon laws with an ecclesiastical approach. Following Ambrose and Augustine, bystanders who did nothing to prevent a crime were as liable as the perpetrator.&lt;ref name=Grigg&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/5817305/Aspects_of_the_Cain_Adomnans_Lex_Innocentium Grigg, Julianna. "Aspects of the Cain: Adomnan's Lex Innocentium", ''Journal of the Australian Early Medieval Association'', Vol.1, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; "Stewards of the Law" collected the fine and paid it to the victim or next of kin.

Adomnán's initiative appears to be one of the first systematic attempts to lessen the savagery of warfare among Christians. In it he gave local expression, in the context of the Gaelic legal tradition, to a wider Christian movement to restrain violence.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.travels-in-time.net/e/scotland12arteng.htm "Adomnán's Law of the Innocents",''Travels in Time'']&lt;/ref&gt; It was an early example of international law in that it was to be enforced in Ireland and northern Scotland, for it was the kings of those regions who were in attendance and signed as guarantors of the Law.

===Peace of God===
{{Main article|Peace and Truce of God}}
As Carolingian authority began to erode, especially on the outskirts of power, as in southern [[Gaul]], the episcopate took steps to protect their congregations and their holdings against the encroachments of local nobles. The Peace of God originated in the conciliar assemblies of the late Carolingian period. It began in [[Aquitaine]], [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]] and [[Languedoc]], areas where central authority had most completely fragmented.

A limited ''Pax Dei'' was decreed at the Synod of Charroux in 989 and spread to most of Western Europe over the next century,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Head, "The Development of the Peace of God in Aquitaine (970-1005)" ''Speculum'' ''74''.3 (July 1999), pp. 656-686.&lt;/ref&gt; surviving in some form until at least the thirteenth century.

A great crowd of many people (''populus'') gathered from the [[Poitou]], the [[Limousin (province)|Limousin]], and neighboring regions. Relics of saints were displayed and venerated. The participation of large, enthusiastic crowds marks it as one of the first popular religious movements of the Middle Ages. In the early phase, the blend of relics and crowds, and enthusiasm stamped the movement with an exceptionally popular character.&lt;ref name=Landes&gt;[http://www.mille.org/people/rlpages/paxdei.html Landes, Richard. "Peace of God: ''Pax Dei'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Peace of God'' or ''Pax Dei'' was a proclamation issued by local clergy that decreed immunity from armed violence to noncombatants who could not defend themselves, beginning with the peasants (''agricolae'') and the clergy. It included the clergy and their possessions; the poor; women; peasants along with their tools, animals, mills, vineyards, and labor; and later pilgrims and merchants: in short, the vast majority of the medieval population who neither bore arms, nor were entitled to bear them. Children and  women were added to the early protections.  Merchants and their goods were added to the protected groups in a synod of 1033.

The ''Pax Dei'' prohibited nobles from invading churches, beating the defenseless, and burning houses. [[Excommunication]] would be the punishment for attacking or robbing a church, for robbing peasants or the poor of farm animals and for robbing, striking or seizing a priest or any man of the clergy ''who is not bearing arms''. Making compensation or reparations could circumvent the anathema of the Church.

After a lull in the first two decades of the eleventh century, the movement spread to the north with the support of king Robert, the Capetian. There, the high nobility sponsored Peace assemblies throughout Flanders, Burgundy, Champagne, Normandy, Amienois, and Berry.&lt;ref name=Landes/&gt; By 1041 the Peace had spread throughout France and had reached Flanders and Italy. From c.1018 the Peace was extended to [[Catalonia]] and reached [[Barcelona]], [[Girona]], and [[Urgel]]. Assemblies were repeated all over western Europe into the 1060s.

=== Truce of God ===
The '''Truce of God''' or ''Treuga Dei'' had its origin in Normandy in the city of Caen.&lt;ref name=Watkin&gt;[http://scholarship.rice.edu/bitstream/handle/1911/12600/document.pdf?sequence=1 Watkin, William Ward. "The Middle Ages: The Approach to the Truce of God", ''The Rice Institute Pamphlet'', Vol. XXIX, No. 4, October, 1942]&lt;/ref&gt; It dates from the eleventh century.&lt;ref name=Moeller/&gt;

While the Truce of God was a temporary suspension of hostilities, as distinct from the Peace of God which was permanent, the jurisdiction of the Truce of God was broader. The Peace of God prohibited fighting on Sundays, and ferial days (feast days on which people were not obliged to work). It was the sanctification of Sunday which gave rise to the Truce of God, for it had always been agreed not to do battle on that day and to suspend disputes in the law-courts.&lt;ref name=Moeller/&gt;

It confirmed permanent peace for all churches and their grounds, the monks, clerks and chattels; all women, pilgrims, merchants and their servants, cattle and horses; and men at work in the fields. For all others peace was required throughout Advent, the season of Lent, and from the beginning of the Rogation days until eight days after Pentecost.&lt;ref name=Watkin/&gt; This prohibition was subsequently extended to specific days of the week, viz., Thursday, in memory of the Ascension, Friday, the day of the Passion, and Saturday, the day of the Resurrection (council 1041). By the middle of the twelfth century the number of proscribed days was extended until there was left some eighty days for fighting.

The Truce soon spread from France to Italy and Germany; the oecumenical council of 1179 extended the institution to the whole Church by Canon xxi, "De treugis servandis", which was inserted in the collection of canon law, Decretal of Gregory IX, I, tit., "De treuga et pace".&lt;ref name=Moeller&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15068a.htm Moeller, Charles. "Truce of God." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 1 Aug. 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas challenged the Truce, holding that it was lawful to wage war to safeguard the commonweal on holy days and feast days.&lt;ref name=Watkin/&gt;

===Thomas Aquinas===
In his ''Summa Theologica'', Thomas Aquinas expands Augustine's arguments to define the conditions under which a war could be just:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/politics/pg0029.html The Just War]&lt;/ref&gt;
* War must occur for a good and just purpose rather than the pursuit of wealth or power.
* Just war must be waged by a properly instituted authority such as the state.
* Peace must be a central motive even in the midst of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Story of Christianity|author=Justo L. Gonzalez|year=1984|publisher=HarperSanFrancisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Crusades==
Religious thinkers and secular writers attempted to incorporate the controls of the Peace and Truce of God into the existing warrior ethic by “Christianizing” it into the Crusades and the cult of [[chivalry]]. Beginning in the 11th century, knighthood developed a religious character. Prospective knights underwent rigorous religious rituals in order to be initiated. An initiate had to fast, confess his sins, was given a symbolic bath, had his hair cut to represent humility, and he spent a night praying, his weapons upon an altar representing the dedication of his weapons to the Church and God. Advancements in metallurgy allowed inscriptions and pictures of holy symbols to be engraved on helmets, swords, shields, and other equipment. The symbols allowed for a physical reminder to knights and military men that God was supporting their efforts, providing protection to those soldiers as well as the assurance of a victory over their enemies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sitemaker.umich.edu/religiousobjects/knights "Religious Devotions of Knights", Medieval Literature and Material Culture, University of Michigan]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Louis IX of France]] is equally famous for his failed [[Seventh Crusade|crusades]] and for the settlement of disputes and the maintenance of peace within Christian lands. He issued the first extant ordinance indefinitely prohibiting warfare in France, a text dating from January 1258 that outlawed guerrae omnes as well as arson, and disturbances to carts and to agricolae who work with carts or plows. Those who transgressed this prohibition were to be punished as peace-breakers (fractores pacis) by the king's officer and the bishop-elect of le Puy-en-Velay. Louis IX promulgated this text as a simple royal act on the basis of his authority as king.&lt;ref name=Firnhaber&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/ems/summary/v023/23.1firnhaber-baker.html Firnhaber-Baker, Justine.

=== Alternatives to the Crusades ===
Christian missionary work was presented as a viable alternative to the violence of the crusaders. Majorcan Franciscan Blessed [[Ramon Llull]] (1232-1315) argued that the conversion of Muslims should be achieved through prayer, not through military force, and pressed for the study of Arabic to prepare potential missionaries. He traveled through Europe to meet with popes, kings, and princes, trying to establish special colleges to prepare them.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Richard Blum: Philosophy of Religion in the Renaissance.

[[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]] laid a foundation for [[religious toleration]]. In ''De libero arbitrio'', he noted that religious disputants should be temperate in their language, "because in this way the truth, which is often lost amidst too much wrangling may be more surely perceived." Gary Remer writes, "Like [[Cicero]], Erasmus concludes that truth is furthered by a more harmonious relationship between interlocutors." &lt;ref&gt;Remer, Gary, ''Humanism and the Rhetoric of Toleration'' (University Park: University of Pennsylvania Press 1996) p. 95 {{ISBN|0-271-02811-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Erasmus did not oppose the punishment of heretics, in individual cases he generally argued for moderation and against the death penalty. He wrote, "It is better to cure a sick man than to kill him." &lt;ref&gt;Froude, James Anthony

[[Francisco de Vitoria]] was a Spanish Dominican philosopher, considered one of the founders of early international law. He was educated at the College Saint-Jacques in Paris, where he was influenced by the work of Desidarius Erasmus. In 1524, he held the Chair of theology at the [[University of Salamanca]], where a number of missionaries returning from the New World expressed concern regarding treatment of the indigenous inhabitants. In three lectures held between 1537 and 1539 Vitoria concluded that the Indians were rightful owners of their property and that their chiefs validly exercised jurisdiction over their tribes. A supporter of the [[just war theory]], in ''De iure belli'' Fransico pointed out that the underlying predicate conditions for a "just war" were "wholly lacking in the Indies".&lt;ref name=Salas&gt;[http://legacy.avemarialaw.edu/lr/assets/articles/AMLR.v.10i2.salas.pdf Salas Jr., Victor M., "Francisco de Vitoria on the ''Ius Gentium'' and the American Indios", ''Ave Maria Law Review'', 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911001651/http://legacy.avemarialaw.edu/lr/assets/articles/AMLR.v.10i2.salas.pdf |date=2014-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vitoria adopted from Aquinas the Roman law concept of ''ius gentium'' ("the law of nations"). His defense of American Indians was based on a Scholastic understanding of the intrinsic dignity of man, a dignity he found being violated by Spain's policies in the New World.

Dominican friar [[Pedro de Córdoba]] OP (c.1460–1525) was a Spanish missionary on the island of Hispaniola. He was first to denounce the system of forced labor known as the Encomienda, imposed on the native inhabitants.

=== Catholic Universalism ===
[[Émeric Crucé]] was a French monk who took the position that wars were the result of international misunderstandings and the domination of society by the warrior class, both of which could be reduced through commerce, as that brought people together.&lt;ref&gt;Oneal, John R., Oneal, Frances H., Maoz, Zeev; and Russett, Bruce. "The Liberal Peace: Interdependence, Democracy, and International Conflict, 1950-85", ''Journal of Peace Research'', Vol. 33, No. 1 (Feb., 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; The genesis of the idea of a meeting of representatives of different nations to obtain by peaceful arbitration a settlement of differences has been traced to Crucé's 1623 work entitled ''The New Cyneas'', a discourse showing the opportunities and the means for establishing a general peace and liberty of conscience to all the world, addressed to the monarch and the sovereign princes of the time. He proposed that a city, preferably Venice, should be selected where all the Powers had ambassadors including all peoples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11596a.htm Smith, Walter George.

===Kulturkampf===
From 1871 to 1878, Chancellor Bismarck, who controlled both the German Empire and the Kingdom of Prussia, launched the "[[Kulturkampf]]" in Prussia to reduce the power of the Catholic Church in public affairs, and keep Polish Catholics under control. Thousands of priests and bishops were harassed or imprisoned, with large fines and closures of Catholic churches and schools. German was declared to be the only official language, but in practice the Poles only adhered more closely to their traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Richard |last=Blanke |title= Prussian Poland in the German Empire (1871–1900) | year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catholics were angry at his systematic attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Ayako Bennette, ''Fighting for the Soul of Germany: The Catholic Struggle for Inclusion after Unification'' (Harvard U.P. 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Unanimous in their resistance, they organized themselves to fight back politically, using their strength in other states such as Catholic [[Bavaria]].  There was little or no violence, and the new Roman Catholic [[Centre Party (Germany)|Center Party]] won a quarter of the seats in the ''Reichstag'' (Imperial Parliament), and its middle position on most issues allowed it to play a decisive role in the formation of majorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=David |last=Blackbourn | title=The Political Alignment of the Centre Party in Wilhelmine Germany: A Study of the Party's Emergence in Nineteenth-Century Württemberg | journal=Historical Journal | volume=18 | issue=4 |date=Dec 1975 | pages=821–850 | jstor = 2638516 | doi=10.1017/s0018246x00008906| url=https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/3629315/blackbourn_polalignment.pdf?sequence=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The culture war gave secularists and socialists an opportunity to attack all religions, an outcome that distressed the Protestants, including Bismarck. After the death of [[Pope Pius IX]] in 1878 Bismarck opened negotiations with [[Pope Leo XIII]], which led to his gradual abandonment of the Kulturkampf in the early 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Christopher | last=Clark | title=Iron Kingdom: The Rise and Downfall of Prussia, 1600–1947 | year=2006 | pages=568–576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Caritas===
The first Caritas organisation was established by Lorenz Worthmann 9 November 1897 in Germany.&lt;ref name=CaritasDE&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.caritas-germany.org/57320.html |title=The History of Caritas in Germany |publisher=Caritas Deutschland |accessdate=27 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020123903/http://www.caritas-germany.org/57320.html |archivedate=20 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other national Caritas organisations were soon formed in Switzerland (1901) and the United States (Catholic Charities, 1910). It has since grown into "Caritas Internationalis", a confederation of 165 Roman Catholic relief, development and social service organizations operating in over 200 countries and territories worldwide.

Caritas Australia is involved in peacebuilding and reconciliation programs in Sri Lanka, The Philippines, Papua New Guinea and elsewhere, including Movimento de Defesa do Fevelado (MDF) which trains youth to be peacebuilders in São Paulo, Brazil in response to an increasing number of children becoming involved in drugs, organised crime and murders. It is hoped these trainees will become the next generation of leaders in their communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caritas.org.au/learn/global-poverty-issues/peacebuilding "Peacebuilding and reconciliation", Caritas Australia]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fascism and Nazism ===
{{See also|Catholic resistance to Nazism}}

Bishop [[Konrad von Preysing]] was one of the most firm and consistent of senior Catholics to oppose the Nazis. He and Bishop [[Clemens August Graf von Galen]], along with Cardinal Secretary of State [[Pope Pius XII|Eugenio Pacelli]], were part of a committee that drafted the 1937 encyclical ''Mit brennender Sorge'' which warned Catholics that the growing Nazi ideology, which exalted one race over all others, was incompatible with Catholic Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Vidmar, John (2005). The Catholic Church Through the Ages. Paulist Press. {{ISBN|0-8091-4234-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Austrian Bishop Gfoellner of Linz had the encyclical read from the pulpits of his diocese. Bishop Gfoellner indicated that the dangers of German Catholics were also the dangers of Austrian Catholics: "What I wrote in my pastoral of January 21, 1933. 'It is impossible to be at once a good Catholic and a good National-Socialist,' is confirmed today."&lt;ref&gt;"Austrian Bishop's Plain Words: Can't Be Good Nazi and Good Catholic", Catholic Herald, 16 April 1937 [http://archive.catholicherald.co.uk/article/16th-april-1937/3/austrian-bishops-plain-words-cant-be-good-nazi-and]&lt;/ref&gt; The release of ''Mit brennender Sorge'' precipitated an intensification of the [[Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Germany]].&lt;ref name="Ian Kershaw pp. 381"&gt;Ian Kershaw; Hitler a Biography; 2008 Edn; W.W. Norton &amp; Co; London; pp. 381–82&lt;/ref&gt; With the death of Cathedral Provost [[Bernhard Lichtenberg]] while en route to Dachau, [[Margarete Sommer]] took over supervising the work of Preysing's Welfare Office. Sommer coordinated Catholic aid for victims of racial persecution&amp;nbsp;– giving spiritual comfort, food, clothing, and money. She gathered intelligence on the deportations of the Jews, and living conditions in concentration camps, as well as on SS firing squads, writing several reports on these topics from 1942.&lt;ref name="Margarete Sommer"&gt;[http://www.gdw-berlin.de/en/recess/biographies/index_of_persons/ Margarete Sommer]; German Resistance Memorial Centre, Index of Persons; retrieved at 4 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Belgian Cardinal [[Jozef-Ernest van Roey]] was deeply opposed to [[Nazi Germany]], and once said, "With [[Germany]] we step many degrees downward and reach the lowest possible depths. We have a duty of conscience to combat and to strive for the defeat of these dangers...Reason and good sense both direct us towards confidence, towards resistance".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,772854,00.html "Prelates Against Hitler", ''TIME Magazine'', 15 December 1941]&lt;/ref&gt; Cardinal van Roey intervened with the authorities to rescue Jews from the Nazis, and encouraged various institutions to aid Jewish children. One of his acts of rescue was to open a geriatric centre in which Jews were housed, at which kosher Jewish cooks would be required who could therefore be given special passes protecting them from deportation.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Gilbert; The Righteous - The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust; Doubleday; 2002; {{ISBN|0385 60100X}}; p.258&lt;/ref&gt; Papal Nuncio [[Pope John XXIII|Angelo Roncalli]] used diplomatic couriers, papal representatives and the [[Congregation of Notre-Dame de Sion|Sisters of Our Lady of Zion]] to transport and issue baptismal certificates, immigration certificates and visas – many of them forged – to Hungarian Jews.

Pallottine priest [[Franz Reinisch]] was beheaded SAC for refusing to take the oath of allegiance to Hitler. When his offer to serve as a medic was denied, Franciscan tertiary [[Franz Jaegerstatter]] was executed as a conscientious objector. Both encountered clergy who thought that they failed in their duty to their country.&lt;ref&gt;Lewy, Guenther.

=== Europe ===
Pope [[John XXIII]] (1958–63) set off a revolution in Roman Catholic thought and life that harkened back to an earlier period for its models and inspiration and brought the church into a new age. Through his policy of ''aggiornamento'' the pope opened the church to the modern world. Russell Hittinger describes the encyclical ''Pacem in Terris'' "as a kind of magna charta of the Catholic Church’s position on human rights and natural law".&lt;ref name=Hittinger&gt;[http://www.pass.va/content/dam/scienzesociali/pdf/acta18/acta18-hittinger.pdf Hittinger, Russell.

Pacem in Terris, Fifty Years Later Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences, Acta 18, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; John's successors [[Paul VI]] and [[John Paul II]] furthered this agenda while maintaining traditional church teachings in many areas of individual and social morality.

In the 1980s the Polish Solidarity movement grew out of labor strikes in the shipyard at Gdańsk. It was the first non-Communist Party-controlled trade union in a Warsaw Pact country, and became a broad social movement, using [[civil resistance]] to advance the causes of workers' rights and social change.&lt;ref&gt;Aleksander Smolar, '"Self-limiting Revolution": Poland 1970-89', in Adam Roberts and Timothy Garton Ash (eds.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&amp;dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present''], Oxford University Press, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-19-955201-6}}, pp. 127-43.&lt;/ref&gt;

British historian [[Timothy Garton Ash]], observed shortly after Pope John Paul II's death, " ...without the Polish Pope, no Solidarity revolution in Poland in 1980; without Solidarity, no dramatic change in Soviet policy towards eastern Europe under Gorbachev; without that change, no [[Velvet Revolution|velvet revolutions]] in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/apr/04/catholicism.religion13?INTCMP=SRCH |title=The first world leader |publisher=The Guardian |date=4 April 2005 |accessdate=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In El Salvador, Father Rutilio Grande spoke against the injustices at the hands of an oppressive government, and dedicated his life’s work to organizing the impoverished, marginalized rural farmers of El Salvador as they demanded respect for their rights.

During World War I, Ben Salmon was a conscientious objector and outspoken critic of [[Just War]] theology.

During world War II, Out of a total of 21 million Catholics only 223 claimed IV-E CO status, conscientious objection to military service; 135 were eventually classified. Most Catholic objectors chose I-A-O status, noncombatant military service, generally as unarmed medics on the front lines. In addition to these 135 Catholic conscientious objectors, 61 Catholics refused induction and were imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;See Interactive Map of World War II camps for conscientious objectors at: http://www.peacedocs.com/Site/Maps_%7C_Timelines_%7C_North_America,_CPS_Camps.html{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially founded as the War Relief Services, the original purpose of [[Catholic Relief Services]] was to aid the refugees of war-torn Europe. The continuing support of the American Catholic helped CRS expand operations and in 1955 its name was officially changed to Catholic Relief Services. Over time the agency learned that to supply emergency aid without addressing the underlying problems might prolong conflict by providing new resources to the warring parties. In light of that, CRS has re-evaluated how best to focus their activities. In some countries CRS works on providing peace education for children in refugee camps or improving relations between refugees and local inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://crs.org/peacebuilding/ "Peacebuilding", CRS]&lt;/ref&gt; It works in ninety-three countries in programs that address hunger, the provision of clean water, and health issues.&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crs.org/about/history/|publisher=Catholic Relief Services|title=Catholic Relief Services History|year=2013|accessdate=June 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, activities were carried on by such individuals as [[Joseph Fahey]] and [[Eileen Egan]] who were instrumental in the creation of [[Pax Christi]].

==Papal diplomacy and arbitration==
The institutional church, and especially the papacy, long sought to use its authority to promote peace and justice, and like all human institutions, has met with mixed results. The first was primarily in the area of international diplomacy; the second was the realm of canon law and of theology, in attempts to define the limits of war and violence; and the third, among the [[Scholastics]] who investigated the boundaries of individual conscience.

For Medieval Europe, canon law served as a code of international law.&lt;ref name=Mattingly&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GxbnOGK9lMwC&amp;q=Papacy#v=snippet&amp;q=Papacy&amp;f=false Mattingly, Garrett. ''Renaissance Diplomacy'', 1955]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Garret Mattingly, &lt;blockquote&gt;...since the eleventh century, the canonists had been pre-occupied with many of the problems which we think of as belonging to public international law, with the definition of sovereignty, with the sanctity of treaties, with the preservation of peace, with the rights of neutrals and noncombatants, and with the mitigation of the rigours of war.&lt;ref name=Mattingly/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the thirteenth century the Papacy became the first Western power to make a systematic use of diplomacy.&lt;ref name=Mattingly/&gt; 
The papacy, in fact, can be regarded as the originator of many of the most basic elements of modern diplomacy and international law: the protection and safe conduct of ambassadors, the secrecy of diplomatic negotiations, the insistence that treaties and their terms, once made, are to be strictly adhered to, the condemnation of violations, provisions for the release of prisoners and hostages and their humane treatment while in detention, the protection of exiles, aliens, and racial minorities, and the condemnation of unjust wars all derive from the papal position both as the leader of Christian society and as a force for international unity among secular states.

The papacy’s association of peace with justice that motivated its active arbitration in international relations also prompted its interest in another area associated with justice, that of ''jus'' or law. In the international sphere this brought the papacy to adopt the ancient Roman theories of the'' jus gentium'', a body of custom and agreements among peoples and sovereign princes, from the tenth century linked with the revival of Roman law in Italy. Closely associated with Roman law and custom was the notion of the just war, which was Christianized by [[Augustine|St. Augustine]] and handed on to the Middle Ages through [[Isidore of Seville|St. Isidore of Seville]].

*[[Pope Nicholas I]] (858-67) against the backdrop of Carolingian conquest Nicholas penned what is both a “classic summary of Christian faith and discipline” and a harsh condemnation of war. In his ''Reply to the Inquiry of the Bulgars,'' written in 866, Nicholas condemns conversion by force, branding war as a diabolical fraud. While Nicholas concedes that war may be permissible in cases of inescapable necessity, in self-defense, he warns that “in itself it is the devil’s work.” He advises that deserters (c. 22) and those who refuse to obey orders to kill (c. 23) be treated leniently and gives Boris examples of numerous martyrs who fled in the face of violence. In response to Boris’ question as to how Christians are to prepare for war, Nicholas answered that one must employ all the Christian works of mercy that make peace, affirm life, and negate the motives for and works of war.
*During the tenure of [[Pope Pius IX]], Catholics and Protestants collaborated to found a school in Rome to study international law and train international mediators committed to conflict resolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/pope-francis-carries-forward-papal-commitment-to-peace/ Gagliarducci, Andrea. "Pope Francis carries forward papal commitment to peace", ''Catholic News Agency'', September 77, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1885 [[Pope Leo XIII]] was asked by Spain and Germany to mediate their territorial dispute in the South Pacific.
*[[Pope Benedict XV]] left a legacy of lasting significance for the papacy and the church in the area of teaching and practice on war and peace. In condemning World War I as a whole without taking sides, the pope did not reason in terms of traditional church teaching about just and unjust wars. He was able to see that modern technology — especially the novelty of aerial bombardment — had made traditional moral calculations and distinctions between combatants and noncombatants increasingly meaningless. Pope Benedict’s influence on his successors is clear in Pope Pius XII’s attempts to use diplomacy to forestall World War II.&lt;ref&gt;[http://easttexascatholic.com/2014/08/29/wartime-pontiff-started-tradition-of-papal-peacemaking/ Rocca, Francis X., "Wartime pontiff started tradition of papal peacemaking", Catholic News Service, August 29, 2014] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140906222744/http://easttexascatholic.com/2014/08/29/wartime-pontiff-started-tradition-of-papal-peacemaking/ |date=September 6, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of two days, messages was sent between the White House and the Kremlin, with the Vatican serving as the intermediary.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41980">A '''causal model''' is a [[conceptual model]] that describes the [[causality|causal]] mechanisms of a [[system]]. Causal models can improve study designs by providing clear rules for deciding which independent variables need to be included/controlled for. 

They can allow some questions to be answered from existing observational data without the need for an interventional study such as a [[randomized controlled trial]]. Some interventional studies are inappropriate for ethical or practical reasons, meaning that without a causal model, some questions cannot be answered. 

Casual models can help with the question of external validity(whether results from one study apply to unstudied populations). Causal models can allow data from multiple studies to be merged (in certain circumstances) to answer questions that cannot be answered by any individual data set.

Causal models are falsifiable, in that if they do not match data, they must be rejected as invalid.

Causal models have found applications in [[signal processing]], [[epidemiology]] and [[machine learning]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=LLkhAwAAQBAJ}} |title=Causality|last=Pearl|first=Judea|date=2009-09-14|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139643986|location=|pages=|language=en}} &lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==

{{Quote|text=Causal models are mathematical models representing causal relationships within an individual system or population. They facilitate inferences about causal relationships from statistical data. They can teach us a good deal about the epistemology of causation, and about the relationship between causation and probability. They have also been applied to topics of interest to philosophers, such as the logic of counterfactuals, decision theory, and the analysis of actual causation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Hitchcock|first=Christopher|title=Causal Models|date=2018|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2018/entries/causal-models/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-09-08}} &lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}} [[Judea Pearl|Pearl]] defines a causal model as an ordered triple &lt;math&gt;\langle U, V, E\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, where U is a set of [[exogenous variable]]s whose values are determined by factors outside the model; V is a set of endogenous variables whose values are determined by factors within the model; and E is a set of [[structural equation]]s that express the value of each endogenous variable as a function of the values of the other variables in U and V.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
== History ==

[[Aristotle]] defined a taxonomy of causality, including "material", "formal", "efficient" and "final" causes. Hume rejected Aristotle's taxonomy in favor of counterfactuals. At one point, he denied that objects have "powers" that make one a cause and another an effect.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=264}} 264]}} Later he adopted "if the first object had not been, the second had never existed" ("[[Sine qua non|but-for]]" causation).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=265}} 265]}}

In the late 19th century, the discipline of statistics began to form. After a years-long effort to identify causal rules for domains such as biological inheritance, [[Francis Galton|Galton]] introduced the concept of [[Regression toward the mean|mean regression]] (epitomized by the [[sophomore slump]] in sports) which later led him to the non-causal concept of [[correlation]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ}} |title=The Book of Why: The New Science of Cause and Effect|last=Pearl|first=Judea|last2=Mackenzie|first2=Dana|date=2018-05-15|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=9780465097616|location=|pages=|language=en|author-link=Judea Pearl}} &lt;/ref&gt; 

As a [[Positivism|positivist]], [[Karl Pearson|Pearson]] expunged the notion of causality from much of science as an unprovable special case of association and introduced the [[correlation coefficient]] as the metric of association. He wrote, "Force as a cause of motion is exactly the same as a tree god as a cause of growth" and that causation was only a "fetish among the inscrutable arcana of modern science". Pearson founded ''[[Biometrika]]'' and the Biometrics Lab at [[University College London]], which became the world leader in statistics.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1908 [[G. H. Hardy|Hardy]] and [[Wilhelm Weinberg|Weinberg]] solved the problem of [[Hardy–Weinberg principle|trait stability]] that had led Galton to abandon causality, by invoking [[Mendelian inheritance]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1921 [[Sewall Wright|Wright]]'s [[Path analysis (statistics)|path analysis]] became the theoretical ancestor of causal modeling and causal graphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=yWWEIvNgUQ4C|page=707}} |title=The Oxford Handbook of Causation |editor-last=Beebee |editor-first=Helen|editor-last2=Hitchcock|editor-first2=Christopher|editor-last3=Menzies|editor-first3=Peter|date=2012-01-12|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780191629464|language=en|first=Samir |last=Okasha |chapter=Causation in Biology|chapter-url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199279739.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199279739-e-0036|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199279739.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199279739-e-0036 |doi-broken-date=2018-10-18 }} &lt;/ref&gt; He developed this approach while attempting to untangle the relative impacts of [[heredity]], development and environment on [[guinea pig]] coat patterns. He backed up his heretical claims by showing how such analyses could explain the relationship between guinea pig birth weight, in utero time and litter size. Opposition to these ideas by prominent statisticians led them to be ignored for the following 40 years (except among animal breeders). Instead scientists relied on correlations, partly at the behest of Wright's critic (and leading statistician), [[Ronald Fisher|Fisher]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; One exception was Burks, a student who in 1926 was the first to apply path diagrams to represent a mediator and to assert that holding a mediator constant induces errors. She may have invented path diagrams independently.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=304}} 304]}} 

In 1923, [[Jerzy Neyman|Neyman]] introduced the concept of a potential outcome, but his paper was not translated from Polish to English until 1990.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=271}} 271]}} 

In 1958 [[David Cox (statistician)|Cox]] wrote warned that controlling for a variable Z is valid only if it is highly unlikely to be affected independent variables.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=154}} 154]}} 

In the 1960s, [[Otis Dudley Duncan|Duncan]], [[Hubert M. Blalock Jr.|Blalock]], [[Arthur Goldberger|Goldberger]] and others rediscovered path analysis. While reading Blalock's work on path diagrams, Duncan remembered a lecture by [[William Fielding Ogburn|Ogburn]] twenty years earlier that mentioned a paper by Wright that mentioned Burk.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=308}} 308]}} 

Sociologists called causal models [[structural equation modeling]], but once it became a rote method, it lost its utility, leading some practitioners to reject any relationship to causality. Economists adopted the algebraic part of path analysis, calling it simultaneous equation modeling. However, economists still avoided attributing causal meaning to their equations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Sixty years after his first paper, Wright published a piece that recapitulated it, following [[Samuel Karlin|Karlin]] et al.'s critique, which objected that it handled only linear relationships and that robust, model-free presentations of data are more revealing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1973 [[David Lewis (philosopher)|Lewis]] advocated replacing correlation with but-for causality (counterfactuals). He referred to humans' ability to envision alternative worlds in which a cause did or not occur and in which effect an appeared only following its cause.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=266}} 266]}} In 1974 [[Donald Rubin|Rubin]] introduced the notion of "potential outcomes" as a language for asking causal questions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=269}} 269]}}  

In 1983 [[Nancy Cartwright (philosopher)|Cartwright]] proposed that any factor that is "causally relevant" to an effect be conditioned on, moving beyond simple probability as the only guide.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=48}} 48]}} 

In 1986 Baron and Kenny introduced principles for detecting and evaluating mediation in a system of linear equations. As of 2014 their paper was the 33rd most-cited of all time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=324}} 324]}} That year [[Sander Greenland|Greenland]] and [[James Robins|Robins]] introduced the "exchangeability" approach to handling confounding by considering a counterfactual. They proposed assessing what would have happened to the treatment group if they had not received the treatment and comparing that outcome to that of the control group. If they matched, confounding was said to be absent.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=154}} 154]}} 

== Ladder of causation ==

Pearl's causal [[Metamodeling|metamodel]] involves a three-level abstraction he calls the ladder of causation. The lowest level, Association (seeing/observing), entails the sensing of regularities or patterns in the input data, expressed as correlations. The middle level, Intervention (doing), predicts the effects of deliberate actions, expressed as causal relationships. The highest level, [[Counterfactual conditional|Counterfactuals]] (imagining), involves constructing a theory of (part of) the world that explains why specific actions have specific effects and what happens in he absence of such actions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Association ===

One object is associated with another if observing one changes the [[probability]] of observing the other. Example: shoppers who buy toothpaste are more likely to also buy dental floss. Mathematically: 

:&lt;math&gt;P (floss \vline toothpaste) &lt;/math&gt;

or the probability of (purchasing) floss given (the purchase of) toothpaste. Associations can also be measured via computing the [[Correlation and dependence|correlation]] of the two events. Associations have no causal implications. One event could cause the other, the reverse could be true, or both events could be caused by some third event (unhappy hygenist shames shopper into treating their mouth better ).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Intervention ===

This level asserts specific causal relationships between events. Causality is assessed by experimentally performing some action that affects one of the events. Example: doubling the price of toothpaste (then what happens). Causality cannot be established by examining history (of price changes) because the price change may have been for some other reason that could itself affect the second event (a tariff that increases the price of both goods). Mathematically: 

:&lt;math&gt;P (floss \vline do(toothpaste)) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''do'' is an operator that signals the experimental intervention (doubling the price).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Counterfactuals ===

The highest, counterfactual, level involves consideration of an alternate version of a past event. Example: What is the probability that If a store had doubled the price of floss, the toothpaste-purchasing shopper would still have bought it? Answering yes asserts the existence of a causal relationship. Models that can answer counterfactuals allow precise interventions whose consequences can be predicted. At the extreme, such models are accepted as physical laws (as in the laws of physics, e.g., inertia, which says that if force is not applied to a stationary object, it will not move).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Causality==
=== Causality vs correlation ===

Statistics revolves around the analysis of relationships among multiple variables. Traditionally, these relationships are described as [[Correlation and dependence|correlations]], associations without any implied causal relationships. Causal models attempt to extend this framework by adding the notion of causal relationships, in which changes in one variable cause changes in others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Twentieth century definitions of [[causality]] relied purely on probabilities/associations. One event (X) was said to cause another if it raises the probability of the other (Y). Mathematically this is expressed as: 

:&lt;math&gt;P (Y \vline X) &gt; P(Y) &lt;/math&gt;. Such definitions are inadequate because they encompass non-causal explanations (a common cause for X and Y). Causality is relevant to the second ladder step. Associations are on the first step and provide only evidence to the latter.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A later definition attempted to address this ambiguity by conditioning on background factors. Mathematically: 

:&lt;math&gt;P (Y \vline X, K = k) &gt; P(Y|K=k) &lt;/math&gt;, where K is the set of background variables and k is the values of those variables in a specific context. However, the required set of background variables is indeterminate as long as probability is the only criterion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Other attempts to define causality include [[Granger causality]], a [[Statistical hypothesis testing|statistical hypothesis test]] that [[causality]] (in [[economics]]) can be assessed by measuring the ability to predict the future values of one time series using prior values of another time series.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Types ===

A cause can be [[Causality#Necessary and sufficient causes|necessary, sufficient, contributory]] or some combination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=skIZAQAAIAAJ|page=25}} |title=Discrete Mathematics with Applications|last=Epp|first=Susanna S.|date=2004|publisher=Thomson-Brooks/Cole|isbn=9780534359454|language=en|pp= 25–26}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==== Necessary ====

For ''x'' to be a necessary cause of ''y'', the presence of ''y'' must imply the prior occurrence of ''x''. The presence of ''x'', however, does not imply that ''y'' will occur.&lt;ref name="CR"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.istarassessment.org/srdims/causal-reasoning-2/|title=Causal Reasoning|website=www.istarassessment.org|access-date=2 March 2016}} &lt;/ref&gt; Necessary causes are also known as "but-for" causes, as in ''y'' would not have occurred but for the occurrence of ''x''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=261}} 261]}} 

==== Sufficient causes ====

For ''x'' to be a sufficient cause of ''y'', the presence of ''x'' must imply the subsequent occurrence of ''y''. However, another cause ''z'' may independently cause ''y''. Thus the presence of ''y'' does not require the prior occurrence of ''x''.&lt;ref name="CR" /&gt;

==== Contributory causes ====

For ''x'' to be a contributory cause of ''y'', the presence of ''x'' must increase the likelihood of ''y''. If the likelihood is 100%, then ''x'' is instead called sufficient. A contributory cause may also be necessary.&lt;ref name="Riegelman"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Riegelman|first1=R.|year=1979|title=Contributory cause: Unnecessary and insufficient|journal=Postgraduate Medicine|volume=66|issue=2|pages=177–179|doi=10.1080/00325481.1979.11715231|pmid=450828}} &lt;/ref&gt;

== Model ==

=== Causal diagram ===
A causal diagram is a [[directed graph]] that displays [[causality|causal]] relationships between [[variable (mathematics)|variables]] in a causal model. A causal diagram includes a set of variables (or [[node (graph theory)|nodes]]). Each node is connected by an arrow to one or more other nodes upon which it has a causal influence. An arrowhead delineates the direction of causality, e.g., an arrow connecting variables A and B with the arrowhead at B indicates that a change in A causes a change in B (with an associated probability).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Causal diagrams include [[causal loop diagram]]s, [[directed acyclic graph]]s, and [[Ishikawa diagram]]s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Casual diagrams are independent of the quantitative probabilities that inform them. Changes to those probabilities (e.g., due to technological improvements) do not require changes to the model.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Model elements ===

Causal models have formal structures with elements with specific properties.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Junction patterns ====

The three types of connections of three nodes are linear chains, branching forks and merging colliders.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
===== Chain =====

Chains are straight line connections with arrows pointing from cause to effect. In this model, B is a mediator in that it mediates the change that A would otherwise have on C.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=113}} 113]}} 

:&lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C&lt;/math&gt; 

===== Fork =====

In forks, one cause has multiple effects. The two effects have a common cause. Conditioning on B (for a specific value of B) reveals a positive correlation between A and C that is not causal.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=114}} 114]}} 

:&lt;math&gt;A \leftarrow B \rightarrow C&lt;/math&gt; 

An elaboration of a fork is the confounder:

:&lt;math&gt;A \leftarrow B \rightarrow C \rightarrow A &lt;/math&gt;

In such models, B is a common cause of A and C (which also causes A), making B the confounder.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=114}} 114]}} 

===== Collider =====

In colliders, multiple causes affect one outcome. Conditioning on B (for a specific value of B) often reveals a non-causal negative correlation between A and C. This negative correlation has been called collider bias and the "explain-away" effect as in, B explains away the correlation between A and C.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=115}} 115]}} The correlation can be positive in the case where contributions from both A and C are necessary to affect B.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=197}} 197]}} 

:&lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow B \leftarrow C&lt;/math&gt; 

==== Node types ====

===== Mediator =====

A mediator node modifies the effect of other causes on an outcome (as opposed to simply affecting the outcome).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=113}} 113]}} 

===== Confounder =====

A confounder node affects multiple outcomes, creating a positive correlation among them.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=114}} 114]}}

==== Instrumental variable ====

An [[Instrumental variables estimation|instrumental variable]] is one that:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=246}} 246]}} 

* has a causal path to the outcome
* has no other path to causal variables
* has no direct influence on the outcome

Regression coefficients can serve as estimates of the causal effect of an instrumental variable on an outcome as long as that effect is not confounded. In this way, instrumental variables allow causal factors to be quantified without data on confounders.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=249}} 249]}} 

For example, given the model:

:&lt;math&gt;Z \rightarrow X \rightarrow Y \leftarrow U \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt;

Z is an independent variable, because it has a path to the outcome Y and is unconfounded, e.g., by U.

Definition: In the above example, if Z and X take binary values, then the assumption that Z = 0, X = 1 does not occur is called monotonicity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=253}} 253]}} 

Refinements to the technique include creating an instrument by conditioning on other variable to block the paths between the instrument and the confounder and combining multiple variables to form a single instrument.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=257}} 257]}} 

==== Mendelian randomization ====

Definition: [[Mendelian randomization]] uses measured variation in genes of known function to examine the causal effect of a modifiable exposure on disease in [[observational studies]].&lt;ref name="Katan1986"&gt;{{cite article|author=Katan MB|date=March 1986|title=Apolipoprotein E isoforms, serum cholesterol, and cancer|journal=Lancet|volume=1|issue=8479|pages=507–8|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(86)92972-7|pmid=2869248}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK62433/|title=Mendelian Randomization: Genetic Variants as Instruments for Strengthening Causal Inference in Observational Studies|last=Smith|first=George Davey|last2=Ebrahim|first2=Shah|date=2008|publisher=National Academies Press (US)|language=en}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Because genes vary randomly across populations, presence of a gene typically qualifies as an instrumental variable, implying that in many cases, causality can be quantified using regression on an observational study.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=255}} 255]}}

== Associations ==

=== Independence conditions ===

Independence conditions are rules for deciding whether two variables are independent of each other. Variables are independent if the values of one do not directly affect the values of the other. Multiple causal models can share independence conditions. For example, the models

:&lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C&lt;/math&gt;

and 

:&lt;math&gt;A \leftarrow B \rightarrow C&lt;/math&gt;

have the same independence conditions, because conditioning on B leaves A and C independent. However, the two models do not have the same meaning and can be falsified based on data. (If observations show an association between A and C after conditioning on B, then both models are incorrect). Conversely, data cannot show which of these two models are correct, because they have the same independence conditions. Conditioning on a variable is a mechanism for conducting hypothetical experiments. Conditioning on a variable involves analyzing the values of other variables for a given value of the conditioned variable. In the first example, conditioning on B implies that observations for a given value of B should show no correlation between A and C. If such a correlation exists, then the model is incorrect. Non-causal models cannot make such distinctions, because they do not make causal assertions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=129}} 129-130]}} 

=== Confounder/deconfounder ===

An essential element of correlational study design is to identify potentially confounding influences on the variable under study, such as demographics. These variables are controlled for to eliminate those influences. However, the correct list of confounding variables cannot be determined ''a priori''. It is thus possible that a study may control for irrelevant variables or even (indirectly) the variable under study.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=139}} 139]}} 

Causal models offer a robust technique for identifying appropriate confounding variables. Formally, Z is a confounder if "Y is associated with Z via paths not going through X". These can often be determined using data collected for other studies. Mathematically, if 

:&lt;math&gt;P(Y|X) \ne P(Y|do(X))&lt;/math&gt; 

then X is a confounder for Y.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=151}} 151]}} 

Earlier, allegedly incorrect definitions include:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=152}} 152]}} 

* "Any variable that is correlated with both X and Y."
* Y is associated with Z among the unexposed.
* Noncollapsibility: A difference between the "crude relative risk and the relative risk resulting after adjustment for the potential confounder".
* Epidemiological: A variable associated with X in the population at large and associated with Y among people unexposed to X.

The latter is flawed in that given that in the model: 

:&lt;math&gt;X \rightarrow Z \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; 

Z matches the definition, but is a mediator, not a confounder, and is an example of controlling for the outcome.

In the model 

:&lt;math&gt;X \leftarrow A \rightarrow B \leftarrow C \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; 

Traditionally, B was considered to be a confounder, because it is associated with X and with Y but is not on a causal path nor is it a descendant of anything on a causal path. Controlling for B causes it to become a confounder. This is known as M-bias.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=161}} 161]}} 

==== Backdoor adjustment ====

In a causal model, the method for identifying all appropriate counfounders (deconfounding) is to block every noncausal path between X and Y without disrupting any causal paths.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=158}} 158]}} 

Definition: a backdoor path between two variables X and Y is any path from X to Y that starts with an arrow pointing to X.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=158}} 158]}} 

X and Y are deconfounded if every backdoor path is blocked and no controlled-for variable Z is descended from X. It is not necessary to control for any variables other than the deconfounders.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=158}} 158]}} 

Definition: the backdoor criterion is satisfied when all backdoor paths in a model are blocked.

When the causal model is a plausible representation of reality and the backdoor criterion is satisfied, then partial regression coefficients can be used as (causal) path coefficients (for linear relationships).&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=223}} 223]}} 

:&lt;math&gt;P(Y|do(X)) = \textstyle \sum_{x} \displaystyle P(Y|X, Z=z) P(Z=z)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=227}} 227]}}

==== Frontdoor adjustment ====

Definition: a frontdoor path is a direct causal path for which data is available for all variables.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=226}} 226]}} 

The following converts a do expression into a do-free expression by conditioning on the variables along the front-door path.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=226}} 226]}} 

:&lt;math&gt;P(Y|do(X)) = \textstyle \sum_{z} \displaystyle P(Z=z,X) \textstyle \sum_{x} \displaystyle P(Y|X=x, Z=z) P(X=x)&lt;/math&gt; 

Presuming data for these observable probabilities is available, the ultimate probability can be computed without an experiment, regardless of the existence of other confounding paths and without backdoor adjustment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=226}} 226]}} 

== Interventions ==
=== Queries ===

Queries are questions asked based on a specific model. They are generally answered via performing experiments (interventions). Interventions take the form of fixing the value of one variable in a model and observing the result. Mathematically, such queries take the form (from the example):&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=8}} 8]}} 

:&lt;math&gt;P (floss \vline do(toothpaste)) &lt;/math&gt;

where the ''do'' operator indicates that the experiment explicitly modified the price of toothpaste. Graphically, this blocks any causal factors that would otherwise affect that variable. Diagramatically, this erases all causal arrows pointing at the experimental variable.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=40}} 40]}} 

More complex queries are possible, in which the do operator is applied (the value is fixed) to multiple variables.

=== Do calculus ===

The do calculus is the set of manipulations that are available to transform one expression into another, with the general goal of transforming expressions that contain the do operator into expressions that do not. Expressions that do not include the do operator can be estimated from observational data alone, without the need for an experimental intervention, which might be expensive, lengthy or even unethical (e.g., asking subjects to take up smoking).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=231}} 231]}} The set of rules is complete (it can be used to derive every true statement in this system).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=237}} 237]}} An algorithm can determine whether, for a given model, a solution is computable in [[Time complexity|polynomial time]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=238}} 238]}} 

==== Rules ====

The calculus includes three rules for the transformation of conditional probability expressions involving the do operator. 

===== Rule 1 =====
Rule 1 permits the addition or deletion of observations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=235}} 235]}}:

:&lt;math&gt;P(Y|do(X), Z, W) = P(Y|do(X),Z)&lt;/math&gt;

in the case that the variable set Z blocks all paths from W to Y and all arrows leading into X have been deleted.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=234}} 234]}}  

===== Rule 2 =====
Rule 2 permits the replacement of an intervention with an observation or vice versa.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=235}} 235]}}:

:&lt;math&gt;P(Y|do(X),Z) = P(Y|X,Z)&lt;/math&gt; 

in the case that Z satisfies the [[#Deconfounding|back-door criterion]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=234}} 234]}}  

===== Rule 3 =====
Rule 3 permits the deletion or addition of interventions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;P(Y|do(X)) = P(Y)&lt;/math&gt; 

in the case where no causal paths connect X and Y.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=234}} 234]}} {{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=235}} 235]}} 

==== Extensions ====

The rules do not imply that any query can have its do operators removed. In those cases, it may be possible to substitute a variable that is subject to manipulation (e.g., diet) in place of one that is not (e.g., blood cholesterol), which can then be transformed to remove the do. Example: 

:&lt;math&gt;P(Heart disease |do(blood cholesterol)) = P(Heart disease|do(diet))&lt;/math&gt; 

== Counterfactuals ==

Counterfactuals consider possibilities that are not found in data, such as whether a nonsmoker would have developed cancer had they instead been a heavy smoker. They are the highest step on Pearl's causality ladder. 

=== Potential outcome ===
Definition: A potential outcome for a variable Y is "the value Y would have taken for individual ''u'', had X been assigned the value x". Mathematically:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=270}} 270]}} 

:&lt;math&gt;Y_X = \ _x(u)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;Y_x(u)&lt;/math&gt;.

The potential outcome is defined at the level of the individual ''u.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;''{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=270}} 270]}} 

The conventional approach to potential outcomes is data-, not model-driven, limiting its ability to untangle causal relationships. It treats causal questions as problems of missing data and gives incorrect answers to even standard scenarios.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=275}} 275]}} 

=== Causal inference ===
In the context of causal models, potential outcomes are interpreted causally, rather than statistically.

The first law of causal inference states that the potential outcome 

:&lt;math&gt;Y_X(u) &lt;/math&gt;

can be computed by modifying causal model M (by deleting arrows into X) and computing the outcome for some ''x''. Formally:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=280}} 280]}} 

:&lt;math&gt;Y_X(u) = Y_{Mx}(u)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Conducting a counterfactual ===

Examining a counterfactual using a causal model involves three steps. The approach is valid regardless of the form of the model relationships (linear or otherwise) When the model relationships are fully specified, point values can be computed. In other cases, (e.g., when only probabilities are available) a probability-interval statement (non-smoker x would have a 10-20% chance of cancer) can be computed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=279}} 279]}} 

Given the model:

:&lt;math&gt;Y \leftarrow X \rightarrow M \rightarrow Y \leftarrow U &lt;/math&gt;

the equations for calculating the values of A and C derived from regression analysis or another technique can be applied, substituting known values from an observation and fixing the value of other variables (the counterfactual).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=278}} 278]}} 

==== Abduct ====

Apply [[abductive reasoning]] ([[logical inference]] that uses observation to find the simplest/most likely explanation) to estimate ''u'', the proxy for the unobserved variables on the specific observation that supports the counterfactual.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=278}} 278]}} 

==== Act ====

For a specific observation, use the do operator to establish the counterfactual (e.g., ''m''=0), modifying the equations accordingly.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=278}} 278]}} 

==== Predict ====

Calculate the values of the output (''y'') using the modified equations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=278}} 278]}} 

=== Mediation ===

Direct and indirect (mediated) causes can only be distinguished via conducting counterfactuals.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=301}} 301]}} Understanding mediation requires holding the mediator constant while intervening on the direct cause. In the model

&lt;math&gt;Y \leftarrow M \leftarrow X \rightarrow Y &lt;/math&gt;

M mediates X's influence on Y, while X also has an unmediated effect on Y. Thus M is held constant, while do(X) is computed.

The Mediation Fallacy instead involves conditioning on the mediator if the mediator and the outcome are confounded, as they are in the above model.

For linear models, the indirect effect can be computed by taking the product of all the path coefficients along a mediated pathway. The total indirect effect is computed by the sum of the individual indirect effects. For linear models mediation is indicated when the coefficients of an equation fitted without including the mediator vary significantly from an equation that includes it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=324}} 324]}} 

==== Direct effect ====

In experiments on such a model, the controlled direct effect (CDE) is computed by forcing the value of the mediator M (do(M = 0)) and randomly assigning some subjects to each of the values of X (do(X=0), do(X=1), ...) and observing the resulting values of Y.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=317}} 317]}} 

:&lt;math&gt;CDE(0) = P(Y=1|do(X=1), do(M=0)) - P(Y=1|do(X=0), do(M=0)) &lt;/math&gt;

Each value of the mediator has a corresponding CDE.

However, a better experiment is to compute the natural direct effect. (NDE) This is the effect determined by leaving the relationship between X and M untouched while intervening on the relationship between X and Y.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=318}} 318]}} 

:&lt;math&gt;NDE = P(Y_{M=M0}=1|do(X=1)) - P(Y_{M=M0}=1|do(X=0)) &lt;/math&gt;

For example, consider the direct effect of increasing dental hygenist visits (X) from every other year to every year, which encourages flossing (M). Gums (Y) get healthier, either because of the hygenist (direct) or the flossing (mediator/indirect). The experiment is to continue flossing while skipping the hygenist visit.

==== Indirect effect ====

The indirect effect of X on Y is the "increase we would see in Y while holding X constant and increasing M to whatever value M would attain under a unit increase in X".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=328}} 328]}} 

Indirect effects cannot be "controlled" because the direct path cannot be disabled by holding another variable constant. The natural indirect effect (NIE) is the effect on gum health (Y) from flossing (M). The NIE is calculated as the sum of (floss and no-floss cases) of the difference between the probability of flossing given the hygenist and without the hygenist, or:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=321}} 321]}} 

:&lt;math&gt;NIE = \sum_m[P(M=m|X=1)-P(M=m|X=0)] x x P(Y=1|X=0,M=m) &lt;/math&gt;

The above NDE calculation includes counterfactual subscripts (&lt;math&gt;Y_{M=M0} &lt;/math&gt;). For nonlinear models, the seemingly obvious equivalence&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=322}} 322]}} 

:&lt;math&gt;\mathsf{Total \ effect = Direct \ effect + Indirect \ effect} &lt;/math&gt;

does not apply because of anomalies such as threshold effects and binary values. However, 

:&lt;math&gt;\mathsf{Total \ effect}(X=0 \rightarrow X = 1) = NDE(X=0 \rightarrow X = 1) - \ NIE(X=1 \rightarrow X=0) &lt;/math&gt;

works for all model relationships (linear and nonlinear). It allows NDE to then be calculated directly from observational data, without interventions or use of counterfactual subscripts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=326}} 326]}} 

== Transportability ==

Causal models provide a vehicle for integrating data across datasets, known as transport, even though the causal models (and the associated data) differ. E.g., survey data can be merged with randomized, controlled trial data.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=352}} 352]}} Transport offers a solution to the question of [[external validity]], whether a study can be applied in a different context.

Where two models match on all relevant variables and data from one model is known to be unbiased, data from one population can be used to draw conclusions about the other. In other cases, where data is known to be biased, reweighting can allow the dataset to be transported. In a third case, conclusions can be drawn from an incomplete dataset. In some cases, data from studies of multiple populations can be combined (via transportation) to allow conclusions about an unmeasured population. In some cases, combining estimates (e.g., P(W|X)) from multiple studies can increase the precision of a conclusion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=355}} 355]}} 

Do-calculus provides a general criterion for transport: A target variable can be transformed into another expression via a series of do-operations that does not involve any "difference-producing" variables (those that distinguish the two populations).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=355}} 355]}} An analogous rule applies to studies that have relevantly different participants.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=356}} 356]}} 

== Bayesian network ==

{{Main|Bayesian network}} 

Any causal model can be implemented as a Bayesian network. Bayesian networks can be used to provide the inverse probability of an event (given an outcome, what are the probabilities of a specific cause). This requires preparation of a conditional probability table, showing all possible inputs and outcomes with their associated probabilities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=119}} 119]}} 

For example, given a two variable model of Disease and Test (for the disease) the conditional probability table takes the form:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=117}} 117]}} 
{| class="wikitable"

|+Probability of a positive test for a given disease

!

!colspan="2"|Test

|-

!Disease 

!Positive

!Negative

|-

|Negative

|12

|88

|-

|Positive

|73

|27

|}

According to this table, when a patient does not have the disease, the probability of a positive test is 12%.

While this is tractable for small problems, as the number of variables and their associated states increase, the probability table (and associated computation time) increases exponentially.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=121}} 121]}} 

Bayesian networks are used commercially in applications such as wireless data error correction and DNA analysis.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{rp|[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=9H0dDQAAQBAJ|page=122}} 122]}}

==Anatomy and physiology==

===Localization===
Various molecular, genetic and imaging studies have been conducted as for the localization of the CPGs. The results have shown that the networks responsible for [[Animal locomotion|locomotion]] are distributed throughout the lower thoracic and lumbar regions of the [[spinal cord]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0301-0082(03)00091-1 |vauthors=Kiehn O, Butt SJ |title=Physiological, anatomical and genetic identification of CPG neurons in the developing mammalian spinal cord |journal=Prog.

===Anatomy===
Although anatomical details of CPGs are specifically known in only a few cases, they have been shown to originate from the spinal cords of various vertebrates and to depend on relatively small and autonomous neural networks (rather than the entire nervous system) to generate rhythmic patterns.&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kuo"/&gt; Many studies have been done to determine the [[Neural substrate of locomotor central pattern generators in mammals|neural substrate of locomotor CPGs in mammals]].  Neural rhythmicity can arise in two ways: "through interactions among neurons (network-based rhythmicity) or through interactions among currents in individual neurons (endogenous oscillator neurons)".&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt; A key to understanding rhythm generation is the concept of a half-center oscillator (HCO). A half-center oscillator consists of two neurons that have no rhythmogenic ability individually, but produce rhythmic outputs when reciprocally coupled. Half-center oscillators can function in a variety of ways. First, the two neurons may not necessarily fire in antiphase and can fire in any relative phasing, even synchrony, depending on the synaptic release. Second, half-centers can also function in an "escape" mode or a "release" mode. Escape and release refer to the way the off-neuron turns on: by escape or release from inhibition. Half-center oscillators can also be altered by intrinsic and network properties and can have dramatically different functionality based on variations in synaptic properties.&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt;

The classical view of CPGs, as specific networks of neurons dedicated to this function alone, has been challenged by numerous data obtained mostly on the central nervous system of invertebrates. In addition to be classical dedicated networks, most of the CPGs seem in fact to be either reorganizing or distributed circuits, and a single neural circuit can combine features typical of each of these architectures. The observation in invertebrates of pattern generators temporarily formed before the production of motor activity strengthens the assumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jean A |title=Brain stem control of swallowing: neuronal network and cellular mechanisms |journal=Physiol. Rev. |volume=81 |issue=2 |pages=929–69 |date=April 2001 |pmid=11274347 |url=http://physrev.physiology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11274347|doi=10.1152/physrev.2001.81.2.929 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CPG circuits appear thus to have a flexible character.

===Neuromodulation===
Organisms must adapt their behavior to meet the needs of their internal and external environments. Central pattern generators, as part of the neural circuitry of an organism, can be modulated to adapt to the organism's needs and surroundings. Three roles of [[Neuromodulation (biology)|neuromodulation]] have been found for CPG circuits:&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt;
#Modulation in CPG as part of normal activity
#Modulation changes the functional configuration of CPGs to produce different motor outputs
#Modulation alters CPG neuron complement by switching neurons between networks and fusing formerly separate networks into larger entities

*Modulation in CPG as part of normal activity
For example, the ''[[Tritonia diomedea]]'' swimming CPG can produce reflexive withdrawal in response to weak sensory input, escape swimming in response to strong sensory input and crawling after escape swimming has ceased. The dorsal swim interneurons (DSIs) of the swim CPGs not only cause the rhythmic escape swimming, but also connect to cilia-activating efferent neurons. Experimental evidence confirms that both behaviors are mediated by the DSIs. "Given the extreme differences between these behaviors—-rhythmic versus tonic, muscular versus ciliary, and brief versus prolonged—these findings reveal a striking versatility for a small multifunctional network."&lt;ref name="Popescu"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Popescu IR, Frost WN |title=Highly dissimilar behaviors mediated by a multifunctional network in the marine mollusk Tritonia diomedea |journal=J. Neurosci. |volume=22 |issue=5 |pages=1985–93 |date=March 2002 |pmid=11880529 |url=http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11880529}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Part of this flexibility is caused by the release of [[serotonin]] from the DSIs, which causes cerebral cell 2 (C2) to release more transmitter and strengthen its network synapses. Application of serotonergic antagonists prevents the network from producing the swimming pattern, and hence this intranetwork modulation appears essential for network oscillation."&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt;

*Modulation changes the functional configuration of CPGs to produce different motor outputs
Data from experiments by Harris-Warrick in 1991 and Hooper and Marder in 1987 suggest that the functional target of modulation is the entire CPG network. These phenomena were first observed through experiments with the [[neuromodulator]] in the lobster cardiac ganglion (Sullivan and Miller 1984). The effect of [[proctolin]] could not be understood by looking only at the neurons it directly affected. "Instead, neurons that are not directly affected both alter the response of the directly affected neurons and help to transmit the changes in the activity of these neurons throughout the network," allowing the entire network to change in consistent and synchronized way.&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt; Harris-Warrick and colleagues have conducted many studies over the years of the effects of neuromodulators on CPG neural networks. For example, a 1998 study showed the distributed nature of neuromodulation and that neuromodulators can reconfigure a motor network to allow a family of related movements. Specifically, dopamine was shown to affect both individual neurons, and synapses between neurons. Dopamine strengthens some synapses and weakens others by acting pre- and post-synaptically throughout the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion. These responses, as well as other effects of dopamine, can be opposite in sign in different locations, showing that the sum of the effects is the overall network effect and can cause the CPG to produce related families of different motor outputs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1998.tb09046.x |vauthors=Harris-Warrick RM, Johnson BR, Peck JH, Kloppenburg P, Ayali A, Skarbinski J |title=Distributed effects of dopamine modulation in the crustacean pyloric network |journal=Ann.

*Modulation alters CPG neuron complement by switching neurons between networks and fusing formerly separate networks into larger entities.
A single neuronal network, such as a central pattern generator, can be modulated moment-to-moment to produce several different physical actions depending on the needs of the animal. These were first coined "polymorphic networks" by Getting and Dekin in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Harris-Warrick RM, Marder E |title=Modulation of neural networks for behavior |journal=Annu. Rev. Neurosci. |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=39–57 |year=1991 |pmid=2031576 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ne.14.030191.000351 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of one such polymorphic central pattern generator is a multifunctional network of the mollusk ''Tritonia diomedea''. As described by Hooper, weak sensory input to the swimming CPG produces reflexive withdrawal, while strong input produces swimming. The dorsal swim interneurons (DSIs) of the circuit release serotonin to convert to "swim mode," while application of serotonergic antagonists prevents the swim pattern.&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt; Additionally, the same single interneuronal network has been found to produce not only "rhythmic, muscle-based escape swimming," but also "nonrhythmic, cilia-mediated crawling." Evidence also suggests that although the CPG controls related but separate functions, neuromodulation of one function can occur without affecting the other. For example, the swim mode can be sensitized by serotonin without affecting the crawl mode. Thus, the CPG circuit can control many separate functions with the appropriate neuromodulation.&lt;ref name="Popescu"/&gt;

===Feedback mechanism===
Although the theory of central pattern generation calls for basic rhythmicity and patterning to be centrally generated, CPGs can respond to sensory feedback to alter the patterning in behaviorally appropriate ways. Alteration of the pattern is difficult because feedback received during only one phase may require changed movement in the other parts of the patterned cycle to preserve certain coordination relationships. For example, walking with a pebble in the right shoe alters the entire gait, even though the stimulus is only present while standing on the right foot. Even during the time when the left foot is down and the sensory feedback is inactive, action is taken to prolong the right leg swing and extend the time on the left foot, leading to limping. This effect could be due to widespread and long-lasting effects of the sensory feedback on the CPG or due to short-term effects on a few neurons that in turn modulate nearby neurons and spread the feedback through the entire CPG in that way. Some degree of [[#Neuromodulation|modulation]] is required to allow one CPG to assume multiple states in response to feedback.&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt;

Additionally, the effect of the sensory input varies depending on the phase of the pattern in which it occurs. For example, during walking, resistance to the top of the swinging foot (e.g., by a horizontal stick) causes the foot to be lifted higher to move over the stick. However, the same input to the standing foot cannot cause the foot to lift or the person would collapse. Thus, depending on the phase, the same sensory input can cause the foot to be lifted higher or held more firmly to the ground.  "This change in motor response as a function of motor pattern phase is called reflex reversal, and has been observed in invertebrates (DiCaprio and Clarac, 1981) and vertebrates (Forssberg et al., 1977). How this process occurs is poorly understood, but again two possibilities exist. One is that sensory input is appropriately routed to different CPG neurons as a function of motor pattern phase. The other is that the input reaches the same neurons at all phases, but that, as a consequence of the way in which the network transforms the input, network response varies appropriately as a function of motor pattern phase."&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt;

A recent study by Gottschall and Nichols studied the hindlimb of a decerebrate cat during walking (a CPG controlled function) in response to changes in head pitch. This study describes the differences in gait and body position of cats walking uphill, downhill and on level surfaces. Proprioceptive (Golgi tendon organs and muscle spindles) and exteroreceptive (optic, vestibular and cutaneous) receptors work alone or in combination to adjust the CPG to sensory feedback. The study explored the effects of neck proprioceptors (giving information about the relative location of the head and body) and vestibular receptors (giving information about the orientation of the head relative to gravity). Decerebrate cats were made to walk on a level surface with their heads level, tilted up or tilted down. Comparing the decerebrate cats to normal cats showed similar EMG patterns during level walking and EMG patterns that reflected downhill walking with the head titled up and uphill walking with the head tilted down. This study proved that neck proprioceptors and vestibular receptors contribute sensory feedback that alters the gait of the animal. This information may be useful for treatment of gait disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gottschall JS, Nichols TR |title=Head pitch affects muscle activity in the decerebrate cat hindlimb during walking |journal=Exp Brain Res |volume=182 |issue=1 |pages=131–5 |date=September 2007 |pmid=17690872 |doi=10.1007/s00221-007-1084-z |pmc=3064865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==
Central pattern generators can serve many functions in vertebrate animals. CPGs can play roles in movement, breathing, rhythm generation and other [[neural oscillation|oscillatory]] functions. The sections below focus on specific examples of locomotion and rhythm generation, two key functions of CPGs.

===Locomotion===
As early as 1911, it was recognized, by the experiments of [[Thomas Graham Brown]], that the basic pattern of stepping can be produced by the spinal cord without the need of descending commands from the cortex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rspb.1911.0077 |author=Graham-Brown, T. |title=The intrinsic factors in the act of progression in the mammal |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B |volume=84 |issue=572 |pages=308–319 |year=1911 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Whelan PJ |title=Developmental aspects of spinal locomotor function: insights from using the in vitro mouse spinal cord preparation |journal=J.

The first modern evidence of the central pattern generator was produced by isolating the locust nervous system and showing that it could produce a rhythmic output in isolation resembling that of the locust in flight. This was discovered by Wilson in 1961.&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt; Since that time, evidence has arisen for the presence of central pattern generators in vertebrate animals, starting with work on the cat in the 1960s by Elzbieta Jankowska in Gothenburg, who provided the first evidence for a spinal cord CPG. This section addresses the role of the central pattern generator in locomotion for the [[lamprey]] and humans.

The lamprey has been used as a model for vertebrate CPGs because, while its nervous system has a vertebrate organization, it shares many positive characteristics with invertebrates. When removed from the lamprey, the intact spinal cord can survive for days ''in vitro''. It also has very few neurons and can be easily stimulated to produce a fictive swimming motion indicative of a central pattern generator. As early as 1983, Ayers, Carpenter, Currie and Kinch proposed that there was a CPG responsible for most undulating movements in the lamprey including swimming forward and backward, burrowing in the mud and crawling on a solid surface, that although not surprisingly did not match the activity in the intact animal, nevertheless provided the basic locomotor output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ayers, J., Carpenter, G.A, Currie, S. and Kinch, J. |title=Which behavior does the lamprey central motor program mediate? |journal=Science |volume=221 |pages=1312–1314 |date=Sep 1983 |pmid=6137060|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/221/4617/1312.long |doi=10.1126/science.6137060 |issue=4617}}&lt;/ref&gt; The different movements have been found to be altered by neuromodulators, including serotonin in a study by Harris-Warrick and Cohen in 1985&lt;ref&gt;Harris-Warrick R, Cohen A (1985) Serotonin modulates the central pattern generator for locomotion in the isolated lamprey spinal cord.

The lamprey model of CPG for locomotion has been important to the study of CPGs. Although Sten Grillner claims that the locomotor network is characterised, a claim that has seemingly been uncritically accepted by the spinal cord locomotor network field, there are in fact many missing details and Grillner cannot provide the evidence he uses to support his claims (Parker 2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Parker D | year = 2006 | title = Complexities and uncertainties of neuronal network function | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2005.1779 | pmid = 16553310 | journal =  Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B | volume = 361 | issue = 1465| pages = 81–99 | pmc = 1626546 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Parker D | year = 2010 | title = Neuronal network analyses: premises, promises and uncertainties | url = | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B | volume = 365 | issue = 1551| pages = 2315–2328 | doi=10.1098/rstb.2010.0043| pmid = 20603354 | pmc = 2894952}}&lt;/ref&gt; A general scheme of the lamprey CPG is now being used in the creation of artificial CPGs.  For example, Ijspeert and Kodjabachian used Ekeberg's model for the lamprey to create artificial CPGs and simulate swimming movements in a lamprey-like substrate using controllers based on a SGOCE encoding.&lt;ref&gt;Ijspeert, Auke Jan and Jerome Kodjabachian "Evolution and development of a central pattern generator for the swimming of a lamprey."

Connections between the CPGs controlling each limb influence the coordination between the limbs and hence the gaits in quadrupedal and possibly also bipedal animals.&lt;ref name=Danner2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Danner|first1=Simon M.|last2=Wilshin|first2=Simon D.|last3=Shevtsova|first3=Natalia A.|last4=Rybak|first4=Ilya A.|title=Central control of interlimb coordination and speed-dependent gait expression in quadrupeds|journal=The Journal of Physiology|date=1 December 2016|volume=594|issue=23|pages=6947–6967|doi=10.1113/JP272787|pmid=27633893|pmc=5134391}}&lt;/ref&gt; Left right coordination is mediated by commissural and fore-hind by long-projecting propiospinal interneurons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bellardita|first1=Carmelo|last2=Kiehn|first2=Ole|title=Phenotypic Characterization of Speed-Associated Gait Changes in Mice Reveals Modular Organization of Locomotor Networks|journal=Current Biology|date=June 2015|volume=25|issue=11|pages=1426–1436|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2015.04.005|pmid=25959968|pmc=4469368}}&lt;/ref&gt; The balance of the left-right alternation (mediated genetically identified V0d and V0v neuron classes) to left-synchronization promoting commissural interneurons (potentially mediated V3 neurons) determines whether walk and trot (alternating gaits) or gallop and bound (synchronous gaits) are expressed. This balance changes with increasing speed, potentially because of connection from the MLR to commissural interneurons, and causes speed dependent gait transitions characteristic for quadrupedal animals.&lt;ref name=Danner2016 /&gt; The walk to trot transition potentially occurs because of the stronger decrease of extension than flexion phase durations with increasing locomotor speed, which leads to progressively increasing overlap between the diagonal limbs up until diagonal synchronization (trot).&lt;ref name=Danner2016 /&gt;

Central pattern generators also contribute to locomotion in higher animals and humans. In 1994, Calancie, et al. claimed to have witnessed the "first well-defined example of a central rhythm generator for stepping in the adult human." The subject was a 37-year-old male who suffered an injury to the cervical spinal cord 17 years prior. After initial total paralysis below the neck, the subject eventually regained some movement of the arms and fingers and limited movement in the lower limbs. He had not recovered sufficiently to support his own weight. After 17 years, the subject found that when lying supine and extending his hips, his lower extremities underwent step-like movements for as long as he remained lying down. "The movements (i) involved alternating flexion and extension of his hips, knees, and ankles; (ii) were smooth and rhythmic; (iii) were forceful enough that the subject soon became uncomfortable due to excessive muscle 'tightness' and an elevated body temperature; and (iv) could not be stopped by voluntary effort." After extensive study of the subject, the experimenters concluded that "these data represent the clearest evidence to date that such a [CPG] network does exist in man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Calancie B, Needham-Shropshire B, Jacobs P, Willer K, Zych G, Green BA |title=Involuntary stepping after chronic spinal cord injury.

These measurements were performed in supine position, thus minimizing peripheral feedback. Subsequent studies showed that these lumbar locomotor centers can form a large variety of rhythmic movements by combining and distributing stereotypical patterns to the numerous lower limb muscles.&lt;ref name=Danner2105 /&gt;

====Neuromechanical control of locomotion in mammals====
If step cycle durations and muscle activations were fixed, it wouldn't be possible to change body velocity and adapt to varying terrain.   It has been suggested that the [[mammalian]] locomotor CPG comprises a “timer” (possibly in the form of coupled oscillators) which generates step cycles of varying durations, and a “[[pattern formation]] layer,” which selects and grades the activation of [[motor pools]].&lt;ref name="Rybak IA, Shevtsova NA, Lafreniere-Roula M, McCrea DA 2006 617–39"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Perret C, Cabelguen JM |title= Main characteristics of the hindlimb locomotor cycle in the decorticate cat with special reference to bifunctional muscles |journal= Brain Research |volume=187 |issue= 2 |pages=333–352|year=1980 |doi=10.1016/0006-8993(80)90207-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Increasing the neural drive from the midbrain locomotor region (MLR) to the spinal CPG increases the step cycle frequency (the cadence).&lt;ref name="Shik"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shik ML, Severin FV, Orlovsky GN |title= Control of walking and running by means of electrical stimulation of the mid-brain |journal= Biophysics |volume=11 |pages=756–765|year=1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Swing and stance phase durations co-vary in a fairly fixed relationship, with stance phases changing more than swing phases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Goslow GE Jr. |author2=Reinking RM |author3=Stuart DG |title= The cat step cycle: hind limb joint angles and muscle lengths during unrestrained locomotion. |journal= Journal of Morphology |volume=141 |issue=1 |pages=1–41|year=1973 |doi=10.1002/jmor.1051410102|pmid=4727469 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been posited that in well-predicted movements, CPG-generated phase durations and muscle forces closely match those required by the evolving biomechanical events, minimizing the sensory corrections required. The term ‘‘neuromechanical tuning’’ has been coined to describe this process &lt;ref name="P&amp;Y"/&gt;

[[File:Locomotor CPG schematic.jpg|thumb|right|750px| Fig. 1. Schematic of the locomotor central pattern generator in the mammalian nervous system. A command signal specifying increasing body velocity descends from deep brain nuclei via the MLR to the spinal cord and drives the timing element of the spinal locomotor CPG to generate cycles of increasing cadence. Extensor phase durations change more than flexor phase durations. The command signal also drives the pattern formation layer to generate cyclical activation of flexor and extensor motoneurons.  Loading of the activated muscles (e.g. supporting the moving body mass) is resisted by the muscles' intrinsic spring-like properties. This is equivalent to displacement feedback.  Force and displacement sensed by [[muscle spindle]] and [[Golgi tendon organ]] afferents reflexly activate motoneurons. A key role of these afferents is to adjust the timing of phase transitions, presumably by influencing or overriding the CPG timer. Modified from &lt;ref name="P&amp;E"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Prochazka A, Ellaway PH |chapter= Sensory systems in the control of movement  |title= Comprehensive Physiology, Supplement 29: Handbook of Physiology, Exercise: Regulation and Integration of Multiple Systems|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons in conjunction with the American Physiological Society |location=NY |year=2012 |pages=2615‐2627}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Fig. 1 provides a simplified schematic that summarizes these proposed mechanisms. A command specifying desired body velocity descends from higher centers to the MLR, which drives the spinal locomotor CPG. The CPG timer produces the appropriate cadence and phase durations and the pattern formation layer modulates the motoneuronal outputs.&lt;ref name="P&amp;E"/&gt;  The activated muscles resist stretch through their own intrinsic biomechanical properties, providing a rapid form of length and velocity feedback control. Reflexes mediated by [[Golgi tendon organ]] and other afferents provide additional load compensation, but the main role of sensory input may be to adjust or override the CPG at stance-swing-stance transitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Donelan JM, McVea DA, Pearson KG |title= Force regulation of ankle extensor muscle activity in freely walking cats |journal= J Neurophysiol |volume=101 |issue= 1 |pages=360–371|year=2009 |doi=10.1152/jn.90918.2008|pmid= 19019974 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As described in [[#Neuromodulation|Neuromodulation]], the human locomotive CPG is very adaptable and can respond to sensory input. It receives input from the brainstem as well as from the environment to keep the network regulated. Newer studies have not only confirmed the presence of the CPG for human locomotion, but also confirmed its robustness and adaptability. For example, Choi and Bastian showed that the networks responsible for human walking are adaptable on short and long timescales. They showed adaptation to different gait patterns and different walking contexts. Also, they showed that different motor patterns can adapt independently. Adults could even walk on treadmills going in a different direction for each leg. This study showed that independent networks control forward and backward walking and that networks controlling each leg can adapt independently and be trained to walk independently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Choi JT, Bastian AJ |title=Adaptation reveals independent control networks for human walking |journal=Nat. Neurosci. |volume=10 |issue=8 |pages=1055–62 |date=August 2007 |pmid=17603479 |doi=10.1038/nn1930 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, humans also possess a central pattern generator for locomotion that is capable not only of rhythmic pattern generation but also remarkable adaptation and usefulness in a wide variety of situations.

===Respiration===
A three-phase model is the classical view of the respiratory CPG. The phases of the respiratory CPG are characterized by the rhythmic activity of: (1) the phrenic nerve during inspiration; (2) recurrent laryngeal nerve branches that innervate the thyroarytenoid muscle during the last stage of expiration; (3) the internal intercostal nerve branches that innervate the triangularis sterni muscle during the second stage of expiration. The rhythmicity of these nerves is classically viewed as originating from a single rhythm generator. In this model, phasing is produced by reciprocal synaptic inhibition between groups of sequentially active interneurons.

Nevertheless, an alternative model has been proposed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Janczewski WA, Feldman JL |title=Distinct rhythm generators for inspiration and expiration in the juvenile rat |journal=J. Physiol. |volume=570 |issue=Pt 2 |pages=407–20 |date=January 2006 |pmid=16293645 |pmc=1464316 |doi=10.1113/jphysiol.2005.098848 |url=http://www.jphysiol.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=16293645}}&lt;/ref&gt; reinforced by certain experimental data. According to this model, respiratory rhythm is generated by two coupled anatomically distinct rhythm generators, one in the [[pre-Boetzinger complex]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1683005 |vauthors=Smith JC, Ellenberger HH, Ballanyi K, Richter DW, Feldman JL |title=Pre-Bötzinger complex: a brainstem region that may generate respiratory rhythm in mammals |journal=Science |volume=254 |issue=5032 |pages=726–9 |date=November 1991 |pmid=1683005 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=1683005 |pmc=3209964}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the other in the [[retrotrapezoid nucleus]] / parafacial [[respiratory group]]. Further survey provided evidence to the hypothesis that one of the networks is responsible for inspiration rhythm and the other for expiration rhythm. Therefore, inspiration and expiration are distinct functions and one does not induce the other, as is the common belief, but one of two dominates the behavior by generating a faster rhythm.

===Swallowing===
Swallowing involves the coordinated contraction of more than 25 pairs of muscles in the oropharynx, larynx and esophagus, which are active during an oropharyngeal phase, followed by the primary esophageal peristalsis. Swallowing depends on a CPG located in the medulla oblongata, which involves several brain stem motor nuclei and two main groups of interneurons: a dorsal swallowing group (DSG) in the [[nucleus tractus solitarii]] and a ventral swallowing group (VSG) located in the ventrolateral medulla above the nucleus ambiguus. Neurons in the DSG are responsible for the generation of the swallowing pattern, while those in the VSG distribute the commands to the various motoneuronal pools. As in other CPGs, the functioning of the central network can be modulated by peripheral and central inputs, so that the swallowing pattern is adapted to the size of the bolus.

Within this network, central inhibitory connections play a major role, producing a rostrocaudal inhibition that parallels the rostrocaudal anatomy of the swallowing tract. Thus, when the neurons controlling the proximal parts of the tract are active, those that command more distal parts are inhibited. Apart from the type of connection between the neurons, intrinsic properties of the neurons, especially those of NTS neurons, probably also contribute to the shaping and timing of the swallowing pattern.

The swallowing CPG is a flexible CPG. This means that at least some of the swallowing neurons may be multifunctional neurons and belong to pools of neurons that are common to several CPGs. One such CPG is the respiratory one, which has been observed interacting with the swallowing CPG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dick TE, Oku Y, Romaniuk JR, Cherniack NS |title=Interaction between central pattern generators for breathing and swallowing in the cat |journal=J. Physiol. |volume=465 |pages=715–30 |date=June 1993 |pmid=8229859 |pmc=1175455 |url=http://www.jphysiol.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=8229859 |doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1993.sp019702}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Grélot L, Barillot JC, Bianchi AL |title=Pharyngeal motoneurones: respiratory-related activity and responses to laryngeal afferents in the decerebrate cat |journal=Exp Brain Res |volume=78 |issue=2 |pages=336–44 |year=1989 |pmid=2599043 |doi=10.1007/bf00228905}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rhythm generators===
Central pattern generators can also play a role in rhythm generation for other functions in vertebrate animals. For example, the rat vibrissa system uses an unconventional CPG for whisking movements. "Like other CPGs, the whisking generator can operate without cortical input or sensory feedback. However, unlike other CPGs, vibrissa motoneurons actively participate in rhythmogenesis by converting tonic serotonergic inputs into the patterned motor output responsible for movement of the vibrissae."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cramer NP, Li Y, Keller A |title=The whisking rhythm generator: a novel mammalian network for the generation of movement |journal=J. Neurophysiol. |volume=97 |issue=3 |pages=2148–58 |date=March 2007 |pmid=17202239 |pmc=1821005 |doi=10.1152/jn.01187.2006 |url=http://jn.physiology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=17202239|citeseerx=10.1.1.327.9770 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Breathing is another non-locomotive function of central pattern generators. For example, larval amphibians accomplish gas exchange largely through rhythmic ventilation of the gills. A study by Broch, et al. showed that lung ventilation in the tadpole brainstem may be driven by a pacemaker-like mechanism, whereas the respiratory CPG adapts in the adult bullfrog as it matures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Broch L, Morales RD, Sandoval AV, Hedrick MS |title=Regulation of the respiratory central pattern generator by chloride-dependent inhibition during development in the bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) |journal=J. Exp. Biol. |volume=205 |issue=Pt 8 |pages=1161–9 |date=April 2002 |pmid=11919275 |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11919275}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, CPGs hold a broad range of functions in the vertebrate animal and are widely adaptable and variable with age, environment and behavior.

===Mechanism of rhythmic generators: post-inhibitory rebound===

Rhythmicity in CPG's can also result from time-dependent cellular properties such as adaptation, delayed excitation, and post-inhibitory rebound (PIR). PIR is an intrinsic property that elicits rhythmic electrical activity by depolarizing the membrane once hyperpolarizing stimulus is gone. "It can be produced by several mechanisms including hyperpolarization-activated cation current (Ih) or deinactivation of depolarization-activated inward currents" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Angstadt JD, Grassmann JL, Theriault KM, Levasseur SM |title=Mechanisms of postinhibitory rebound and its modulation by serotonin in excitatory swim motor neurons of the medicinal leech |journal=J. Comp. Physiol. A |volume=191 |issue=8 |pages=715–32 |date=August 2005 |pmid=15838650 |doi=10.1007/s00359-005-0628-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once inhibition has ceased, this period of PIR can be explained as the time with increased neuronal excitability. It is the property of many CNS neurons that sometimes results in action potential "bursts" following immediately after inhibitory synaptic input."Because of this, it has been suggested that PIR may contribute to the maintenance of oscillatory activity in neural networks that are characterized by mutual inhibitory connections, like those involved in locomotor behaviors. In addition, PIR is often included as an element in computational models of neural networks that involve mutual inhibition" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.185.4146.181 |vauthors=Perkel DH, Mulloney B |title=Motor pattern production in reciprocally inhibitory neurons exhibiting postinhibitory rebound |journal=Science |volume=185 |issue=4146 |pages=181–3 |date=July 1974 |pmid=4834220 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=4834220}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, the "PIR in crayfish stretch receptor neurons is caused by recovery from adaptation during the course of inhibitory hyperpolarization. One feature of that system is that PIR only occurs if the hyperpolarization is imposed on a background of excitation, caused in this case by stretch. They also found that PIR can be elicited in the stretch receptor by hyperpolarizing current pulses. This was an important finding because it showed that PIR is an intrinsic property of the postsynaptic neuron, related to the membrane potential change associated with inhibition but independent of transmitter receptors or presynaptic properties. The latter conclusion has stood the test of time, marking PIR as a robust property of CNS neurons in a wide variety of contexts." &lt;ref&gt;Gerasimov, V. D., P. G. Kostyuk, and V. A. Maiskii. 1966. "Reactions of giant neurons to break of hyperpolarizing current" Fed. Proc. Transl. Suppl, 25T438-T442&lt;/ref&gt;
This cellular property can most easily be seen in the Lamprey neural circuit. The swimming movement is produced by alternating neural activity between the left and right side of the body, causing it to bend back and forth while creating oscillating movements. While the Lamprey is bent to the left, there is reciprocal inhibition on the right side causing it to relax due to hyperpolarization. Immediately after this hyperopolarizing stimulus, the interneurons use post-inhibitory rebound to initiate activity in the right side. Depolarization of the membrane causes it to contract while reciprocal inhibition is now applied to the left side.

===Functions in invertebrates===
As described earlier, CPGs can also function in a variety of ways in invertebrate animals. In the mollusc ''Tritonia'', a CPG modulates reflexive withdrawal, escape swimming and crawling.&lt;ref name="Popescu"/&gt; CPGs are also used in flight in locusts and for respiration systems in other insects.&lt;ref name="Hooper"/&gt; Central pattern generators play a broad role in all animals and show amazing variability and adaptability in almost all cases.

===Other theories===
The classical view of movement control prior to works of Brown attributed the function of muscle pattern generation largely to sensory feedback mechanisms. In this light, the pattern generator can be considered as an intrinsic spinal processor that corrects imperfect sensory feedback and adapts central input to this optimized peripheral input.&lt;ref&gt;Kuo AD (2002) The relative roles of feedforward and feedback in the control of rhythmic movements. Motor Control 6:129-145&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3815">'''Creative Writers and Day-Dreaming''' ({{lang-de|Der Dichter und das Phantasieren}}), was an informal talk given in 1907 by [[Sigmund Freud]], and subsequently published in 1908, on the relationship between unconscious [[fantasy (psychology)|phantasy]] and creative art.

Freud's argument – that artists, reviving memories of childhood [[daydream]]s and play activities, succeeded in making them acceptable through their aesthetic technique&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ''Freud: A Life for Our Time'' (1989) p. 307&lt;/ref&gt; – was to be widely influential for interwar [[modernism]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Berman, ''Translating Modernism'' (2010) p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic sources==
Freud began his talk by raising the question of where writers drew their material from, suggesting that children at play, and adults day-dreaming, both provided cognate activities to those of the literary artist.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ''Freud'' (1989) p. 307-8&lt;/ref&gt; Heroic and erotic daydreams or [[preconscious]] phantasies in both men and women were seen by Freud as providing substitute satisfactions for everyday deprivations;&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''On Psychopathology'' (PFL 10) p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; and the same phantasies were in turn turned into shareable (public) artistic constructs by the creative writer, where they could serve as cultural surrogates for the universal instinctual renunciations inherent in civilization.&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''Civilization, Society and Religion'' (PFL 12) p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic technique==
Freud saw the aesthetic principle as the ability to turn the private phantasy into a public artefact, using artistic pleasure to release a deeper pleasure founded on the release of forbidden (unconscious) material.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ''Freud'' (1989) p.&amp;nbsp;308&lt;/ref&gt; The process allowed the writer him/herself to emerge from their introversion and return to the public world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Otto Fenichel]], The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 479&lt;/ref&gt; If the phantasies came too close to the unconscious repressed, however, the process would fail, leading either to creative inhibition or to a rejection of the artwork itself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Otto Fenichel]], The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 217&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud himself epitomised his essay's argument a decade later in his ''Introductory Lectures'',&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''Introductory lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (PFL 1) p. 423-3&lt;/ref&gt; stating of the true artist that: &lt;blockquote&gt;"he understands how to work over his daydreams in such a way as to make them lose what is too personal in them and repels strangers, and to make it possible for others to share in the enjoyment of them. He understands, too, how to tone them down so that they do not easily betray their origin from proscribed sources....he has thus achieved ''through'' his phantasy what originally he had achieved only ''in'' his phantasy – honour, power and the love of women".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:Drunkards_Cloak.jpg|thumb|"The [[Drunkard's cloak|Drunkard's Cloak]]" - an illustration from ''Curious Punishments of Bygone Days'']]

'''''Curious Punishments of Bygone Days''''' is a history book published in 1896.  It was written by [[Alice Morse Earle]] and printed by Herbert S. Stone &amp; Company. Earle was a historian of [[Colonial America]], and she writes in her introduction:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In ransacking old court records, newspapers, diaries and letters for the historic foundation of the books which I have written on colonial history, I have found and noted much of interest that has not been used or referred to in any of those books. An accumulation of notes on old-time laws, punishments and penalties has evoked this volume.{{fact|date=December 2013}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As the title suggests, the subject of the chapters is various archaic [[punishment]]s.  Morse seems to make a distinction between stocks for the feet, in the Stocks chapter, and stocks for the head, described in the Pillory article- which itself clashes with the modern day understanding of a pillory as a whipping post.{{fact|date=December 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33839">The '''Dublin City Marshal''' was an officer of [[Dublin Corporation]] in Ireland. 

==History==
The origins of the office were analogous to those of the [[Knight Marshal]] in relation to the [[City of London]]. Until 1786&lt;ref&gt;Irish act 26 Geo.3 c.27 s.34 cited in MCI 1835; p.36 s.80&lt;/ref&gt; the Dublin Marshal was [[Prison warden|Keeper]] of [[City Marshalsea, Dublin|Dublin City Marshalsea]],&lt;ref name="mcip36"&gt;MCI 1835; p.36 s.80.&lt;/ref&gt; as the Knight Marshal was for the [[Marshalsea|London Marshalsea]]. Prior to the [[Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840]] the Marshal was elected annually by the common council from among the freemen; typically this was a formality with the incumbent returned unopposed.&lt;ref&gt;MCI 1835; p.16 s.42&lt;/ref&gt; The office was often a [[sinecure]] given to a relative of a senior member of the common council. The Marshal in 1838 considered his appointment effective "for life".&lt;ref&gt;Select Committee on pawnbroking in Ireland 1838 p.121 qq.2157–2161&lt;/ref&gt; In 1876 [[Alexander Martin Sullivan (Irish politician)|Alexander Martin Sullivan]] called the Marshal "a perfectly needless office that might well be abolished".&lt;ref name="cttee1876q4802"&gt;Select Committee on local government and taxation of towns (Ireland) 1876, p.262 q.4802&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1880s the council discussed and printed reports on whether to make the office a full-time position; subsequently vacancies were publicly advertised, with election from among the applicants still done by the councillors.&lt;ref&gt;Dublin City Council Minutes: 1885 pp.147,169; 1886 pp.257,259; 1891 p.270&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the [[Irish local elections, 1920|1920 local elections]] there was a [[Sinn Féin]] majority on the council, which supported the self-proclaimed [[Irish Republic]]'s [[Irish War of Independence|independence war]] against the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Yeates 2012, [https://books.google.ie/books?id=wuL4AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT85 Chapter 3 p.85]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921, when the [[town clerk]] suggested that the office of Swordbearer might be abolished, the Marshal wrote to the clerk defending the existing pawnbroking regulations, and the council agreed not to change them.&lt;ref&gt;Yeates 2012, [https://books.google.ie/books?id=wuL4AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT323 Chapter 9 pp.322–324]&lt;/ref&gt; The 1926 report of the Greater Dublin [[Commission of Inquiry]] proposed to remove the ceremonial vestiges of the corporation, including the Marshal.&lt;ref name="CallananKeogan2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Callanan|first1=Mark|last2=Keogan|first2=Justin F.|title=Local Government in Ireland: Inside Out|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P6OdT7MIflgC&amp;pg=PA126|accessdate=5 October 2017|year=2003|publisher=Institute of Public Administration|isbn=9781902448930|pages=126–127}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report was not implemented,&lt;ref name="CallananKeogan2003"/&gt; and the office of Marshal survived until 1965.&lt;ref name="haughey1964"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dublin City Council Minutes 1962 p.282&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==
The Marshal had a ceremonial role, including leading the annual [[Lord Mayor of Dublin|Lord Mayor's]] parade. In 1867, [[Michael Angelo Hayes]] "wore a scarlet tunic richly braided, and a cocked hat, ''a la Francaise'', rode a decent-looking horse, and was admired by the crowd".&lt;ref name="oneill1868"/&gt; In April 1900, [[John Howard Parnell]] as Marshal held the cushion holding the [[key of the city]] presented to [[Queen Victoria]] by the Lord Mayor at her ceremonial entry into the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McCarthy|first=Michael John Fitzgerald|title=Five years in Ireland, 1895–1900  |url=https://archive.org/stream/fiveyearsinirela00mccauoft#page/476|year=1901|publisher=Simpkin, Marshall, Hamilton, Kent|location=London |pages=476–478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Marshal was an officer of the [[Lord Mayor and Sheriffs' Court]],&lt;ref&gt;MCI 1835; p.36 s.80, pp.50–51 s.111&lt;/ref&gt; held at the [[Tholsel]] and latterly in [[Green Street Courthouse]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libraryireland.com/topog/D/Dublin-Courts-and-Prisons.php|title=Dublin Courts and Prisons|last=Lewis|first=Samuel|year=1837|work=A Topographical Dictionary of Ireland|accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in that role he took charge of the custody and sale of goods under [[Attachment (law)|attachment]].&lt;ref name="mcip36"/&gt;

===Register of pawnbrokers===
Two 1780s statutes sanctioned a previous informal arrangement between Dublin [[pawnbroker]]s and the Marshal:&lt;ref name="raymond17"&gt;Raymond 1978 p.17&lt;/ref&gt; the Pawnbrokers Act 1786&lt;ref&gt;Irish act 26 Geo.3 c.43 s.40; short title assigned by [[Short Titles Act 1962]]&lt;/ref&gt; made the Marshal registrar of pawnbrokers' licences for the whole of Ireland;&lt;ref name="mcip36"/&gt; by the Pawnbrokers Act 1788,&lt;ref&gt;Irish act 28 Geo.3 c.49 s.9; short title assigned by [[Short Titles Act 1962]]&lt;/ref&gt; he was one of four people who could auction forfeited pledges. The others were the city [[Swordbearer (ceremonial)|Swordbearer]] and two nominees of the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]].&lt;ref name="mcip37"&gt;MCI 1835; p.37&lt;/ref&gt; The city [[Ward (electoral subdivision)|ward]]s were divided among the four (coterminous with the four [[police district]]s of the [[Dublin Metropolitan Police|Borough Police]]&lt;ref name="raymond17"/&gt;) with the Marshal and Swordbearer holding the more profitable divisions.&lt;ref name="mcip38"&gt;MCI 1835; p.38&lt;/ref&gt; The 1838 select committee examining pawnbroking in Ireland said "the manner in which successive Marshals of the City of Dublin have discharged the duties imposed upon them by the Act, will be found by the evidence, and by the Report of the Commissioners of Municipal Inquiry, to have been exceedingly unsatisfactory".&lt;ref&gt;Select Committee on pawnbroking in Ireland 1838 p.xii&lt;/ref&gt;

The pawnbroking divisions had been disregarded for some decades until 1941, when the new marshal lost a lawsuit against a pawnbroker on the basis that he did not have jurisdiction as her premises was in the district of the Swordbearer, an office which had fallen into disuse.&lt;ref name="lawsuit1941"&gt;

==Remuneration==
An incoming Marshal had to pay surety (£2000 in 1836).&lt;ref name="mcip36"/&gt; The main expense prior to 1786 was the upkeep of the Marshalsea, though the Corporation sometimes granted sums to the Marshal for repairs. After 1786, the right to the fees collected in his various duties made the office of Marshal profitable; the holder often farmed out the work to subcontractors, allowing him to enjoy a [[sinecure]].&lt;ref name="mcis80"&gt;MCI 1835; s.80 pp.36–38&lt;/ref&gt; In 1833 his net income was £630.&lt;ref name="mcip37"/&gt; Pawnbroking had increased greatly from the 1780s to the 1830s.&lt;ref name="raymond18"&gt;Raymond 1978 p.18&lt;/ref&gt; The reformed corporation elected in 1841 under the 1840 act was "determined ... that no officer should be considered as a sinecure", dismissed the incumbent Marshal, and hired a substitute on a fixed salary.&lt;ref name="petititon1843"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dublin Corporation|first1=|last2=Grogan|first2=Edward|authorlink2=Sir Edward Grogan, 1st Baronet|title=Appendix to the Sixteenth Report of the Select Committee of the House of Commons on Public Petitions|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=RWgSAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA153|series=Parliamentary Papers|date=1843-04-11|publisher=H.M.

''Ecocentric''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɛ|k|oʊ|ˈ|s|ɛ|n|t|r|ɪ|z|əm}}; from Greek: οἶκος ''oikos'', "house" and κέντρον ''kentron'', "center") is a term used in [[ecological]] [[political philosophy]] to denote a nature-centered, as opposed to human-centered (i.e. [[anthropocentric]]), system of values. The justification for ecocentrism usually consists in an [[ontology|ontological belief]] and subsequent [[ethical]] claim. The ontological belief denies that there are any [[Existentialism|existential]] divisions between human and non-human nature sufficient to claim that humans are either (a) the sole bearers of [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]] or (b) possess greater intrinsic value than non-human nature. Thus the subsequent ethical claim is for an equality of intrinsic value across human and non-human nature, or '[[biosphere|biospherical]] [[egalitarianism]]'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/ecocentrism Answers.com]. Retrieved 13 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Quotes ==

According to Stan Rowe:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecospherics.net/pages/aboutauthors.html#rowe Stan Rowe, biographic profile.]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cquote|''The ecocentric argument is grounded in the belief that, compared to the undoubted importance of the human part, the whole [[Earth's spheres|ecosphere]] is even more significant and consequential: more inclusive, more complex, more integrated, more creative, more beautiful, more mysterious, and older than time. The "environment" that [[anthropocentrism]] misperceives as materials designed to be used exclusively by humans, to serve the needs of humanity, is in the profoundest sense humanity's source and support: its ingenious, inventive life-giving matrix. Ecocentrism goes beyond [[biocentrism (ethics)|biocentrism]] with its fixation on organisms, for in the ecocentric view people are inseparable from the inorganic/organic nature that encapsulates them. They are particles and waves, body and spirit, in the context of Earth's ambient energy.''&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, Stan J. (1994).[http://www.ecospherics.net/pages/RoweEcocentrism.html  "Ecocentrism: the Chord that Harmonizes Humans and Earth."] ''The Trumpeter'' '''11(2)''': 106-107.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

and:

{{Cquote|''To switch Western culture from its present track to a saving ecopolitical route means finding a new and compelling belief-system to redirect our way-of-living. It must be a vital outgrowth from our science-based culture. It seems to me that the only promising universal belief-system is ecocentrism, defined as a value-shift from ''Homo sapiens'' to planet earth. A scientific rationale backs the value-shift. All organisms are evolved from Earth, sustained by Earth. Thus Earth, not organism, is the metaphor for Life. Earth not humanity is the Life-center, the creativity-center. Earth is the whole of which we are subservient parts. Such a fundamental philosophy gives ecological awareness and sensitivity an enfolding, material focus''.

''Ecocentrism is not an argument that all organisms have equivalent value. It  is not an anti-human argument nor a put-down of those seeking social justice.  It does not deny that myriad important homocentric problems exist. But it  stands aside from these smaller, short-term issues in order to consider  Ecological Reality. Reflecting on the ecological status of all organisms, it  comprehends the Ecosphere as a Being that transcends in importance any one  single species, even the self-named sapient one''.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe Stan J. [http://www.ecospherics.net/pages/Ro993tek_1.html  "Ecocentrism and Traditional Ecological Knowledge."]&lt;/ref&gt; (1994)}}

==Origin of term==
{{Main article|Aldo Leopold}}
The ecocentric ethic was conceived by [[Aldo Leopold]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Aldo Leopold|Leopold, A.]] 1949. ''A sand county almanac''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and recognizes that all species, including humans, are the product of a long evolutionary process and are inter-related in their life processes.&lt;ref&gt;Lindenmeyer, D. &amp; Burgman, M. 2005. ''Practical conservation biology''. CSIRO Publishing, Collingwood, Australia. {{ISBN|0-643-09089-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The writings of [[Aldo Leopold]] and his idea of the [[land ethic]] and good environmental management are a key element to this philosophy.
Ecocentrism focuses on the biotic community as a whole and strives to maintain ecosystem composition and ecological processes.&lt;ref&gt;Booth, D.E. 1992. The economics and ethics of old growth forests. ''Environmental Ethics'' 14: 43-62.&lt;/ref&gt; The term also finds expression in the first principle of the [[deep ecology]] movement, as formulated by [[Arne Næss]] and George Sessions in 1984&lt;ref&gt;[[Arne Næss]]|Naess, Arne &amp; Sessions, George 1984. "A Deep Ecology Eight Point Platform" cited in ''Deep Ecology for the 21st Century'', Readings on the Philosophy and Practice of the New Environmentalism, ed. George Sessions, Shambhala, Boston and London, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;
which points out that [[anthropocentrism]], which considers humans as the center of the universe and the pinnacle of all creation, is a difficult opponent for ecocentrism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.academon.com/lib/paper/102996.html "Ecocentrism and the Deep Ecology Platform".]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{Main article|Environmentalism}}
Environmental thought and the various branches of the environmental movement are often classified into two intellectual camps: those that are considered anthropocentric, or "human-centred," in orientation and those considered biocentric, or "life-centred". This division has been described in other terminology as "shallow" ecology versus "deep" ecology and as "technocentrism" versus "ecocentrism". Ecocentrism can be seen as one stream of thought within [[environmentalism]], the political and ethical movement that seeks to protect and improve the quality of the natural environment through changes to environmentally harmful human activities by adopting environmentally benign forms of political, economic, and social organization and through a reassessment of humanity's relationship with nature. In various ways, environmentalism claims that non-human organisms  and the natural environment as a whole deserve consideration when appraising the morality of political, economic, and social policies.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year= 2009|title = environmentalism|encyclopedia= Encyclopædia Britannica|url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/765710/environmentalism|accessdate= 13 June 2009|edition= |publisher= |location= |id= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to other similar philosophies==

===Anthropocentrism===
{{Main article|Anthropocentrism}}
Ecocentrism is taken by its proponents to constitute a radical challenge to long-standing and deeply rooted [[anthropocentric]] attitudes in Western culture, science, and politics. Anthropocentrism is alleged to leave the case for the protection of non-human nature subject to the demands of human utility, and thus never more than contingent on the demands of human welfare. An ecocentric ethic, by contrast, is believed to be necessary in order to develop a non-contingent basis for protecting the natural world. Critics of ecocentrism have argued that it opens the doors to an anti-humanist morality that risks sacrificing human well-being for the sake of an ill-defined ‘greater good’.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/ecocentrism Ecocentrism at answers.com]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deep ecology|Deep ecologist]] [[Arne Næss|Arne Naess]] has identified anthropocentrism as a root cause of the [[ecology|ecological]] crisis, [[human overpopulation]], and the [[extinction]]s of many non-human species.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arne Næss|Naess, Arne]] 1973. "The Shallow and the Deep, Long-Range Ecology Movement". ''Inquiry'' '''16''': 95-100&lt;/ref&gt;  Others point to the gradual historical realization that humans are not the centre of all things, that "A few hundred years ago, with some reluctance, Western people admitted that the planets, Sun and stars did not circle around their abode. In short, our thoughts and concepts though irreducibly anthropomorphic need not be anthropocentric."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecospherics.net/pages/RoweEcocentrism.html see Rowe]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Industrocentrism ===
Industrocentrism is an ideology that goes hand in hand with today's industrial neoliberal capitalist agenda.  It sees all things on earth as resources to be utilized by humans or to be commodified.  This view is the opposite of anthropocentrism and ecocentrism.  It negatively affects humans, nonhumans, and the environment in the long run in that it only focuses on short term economic gratification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Culture and Conservation: Beyond Anthropocentrism|last=Shoreman-Ouimet|first=Eleanor|last2=Kopnina|first2=Helen|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781315858630|location=Oxon|pages=8–9|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technocentrism===
{{Main article|Technocentrism}}
Ecocentrism   is also contrasted with [[technocentrism]] (meaning values centred on technology) as two opposing perspectives on attitudes towards human technology and its ability to affect, control and even protect the environment. Ecocentrics, including "deep green" ecologists, see themselves as being subject to nature, rather than in control of it. They lack faith in modern technology and the bureaucracy attached to it. Ecocentrics will argue that the natural world should be respected for its processes and products, and that low impact technology and self-reliance is more desirable than technological control of nature.&lt;ref name=E&gt;[http://www.sustainable-environment.org.uk/Earth/Ecocentrism_and_Technocentrism.php "Earth, ecocentrism and Technocentrism".]&lt;/ref&gt;
Technocentrics, including imperialists, have absolute faith in technology and industry and firmly believe that humans have control over nature. Although technocentrics may accept that environmental problems do exist, they do not see them as problems to be solved by a reduction in industry. Rather, environmental problems are seen as problems to be solved using science. Indeed, technocentrics see that the way forward for developed and developing countries and the solutions to our environmental problems today lie in scientific and technological advancement.&lt;ref name=E /&gt;

===Biocentrism===
{{Main article|Biocentrism (ethics)}}
The distinction between biocentrism and ecocentrism is ill-defined. Ecocentrism recognizes Earth's interactive living and non-living systems rather than just the Earth's organisms (biocentrism) as central in importance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com "Ecocentrism". The Oxford Pocket Dictionary of Current English. 2009. Encyclopedia.com.]. Retrieved 13 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
The term has been used by those advocating "left biocentrism", combining deep ecology with an "anti-industrial and anti-capitalist" position (David Orton et al.).

The '''ecological model of competition''' is a reassessment of the nature of [[competition]] in the [[Economics|economy]]&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Competition, contingency, and destabilization in urban assemblages and actor-networks. Urban Geography, vol. 39 (5), pp. 655-666; https://doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2017.1382307  &lt;/ref&gt;. Traditional [[economics]] models the economy on the principles of [[physics]] (force, equilibrium, inertia, momentum, and linear relationships). This can be seen in the economics lexicon: terms like [[labour force]], [[market equilibrium]], [[capital flows]], and  [[price elasticity]]. This is probably due to historical coincidence. Classical [[Newtonian physics]] was the state of the art in science when [[Adam Smith]] was formulating the first principles of economics in the 18th century.

According to the ecological model, it is more appropriate to model the economy on [[biology]] (growth, change, death, evolution, [[survival of the fittest]], complex inter-relationships, non-linear relationships)&lt;ref&gt;Gowdy, J.M., 1992. Higher selection processes in evolutionary economic change. Journal of Evolutionary Economics, 2(1), pp.1-16.&lt;/ref&gt;. Businesses operate in a complex [[environmental scanning|environment]] with interlinked sets of determinants. Companies [[co-evolution|co-evolve]]: they influence, and are influenced by, competitors, [[customer]]s, governments, investors, suppliers, unions, distributors, banks, and others&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Iterative lagged asymmetric responses in strategic management and long-range planning. Time &amp; Society, OnlineFirst, https://doi.org/10.1177/0961463X17752652 .&lt;/ref&gt;. We should look at this business environment as a business ecosystem that both sustains, and threatens the firm&lt;ref&gt;Gowdy, J., 2013. Coevolutionary economics: the economy, society and the environment (Vol. 5). Springer Science &amp; Business Media.&lt;/ref&gt;. A company that is not well matched to its environment might not survive. Companies that are able to develop a successful [[business model]] and turn a [[core competency]] into a [[sustainable competitive advantage]] will thrive and grow. Very successful firms may come to dominate their industry (referred to as ''category killers'').

{{watergate|White House}}
'''Egil "Bud" Krogh Jr.''' (born August 3, 1939) is an American lawyer who became infamous as an official of the [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] Administration and who was imprisoned for his part in the [[Watergate scandal|Watergate Affair]].  He is currently Senior Fellow on Ethics and Leadership at the [[Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress]] and Counselor to the Director at the [[School for Ethics and Global Leadership]].

==Education==
Krogh was born in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] and raised in [[Seattle]], Washington; his father was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] immigrant. He graduated with highest honors from [[Principia College]], [[Elsah, Illinois]] in 1961. After service in the [[U.S. Navy]] as a communications officer aboard [[USS Yorktown (CV-10)|USS ''Yorktown'']] (1962–1965), he graduated from the [[University of Washington School of Law]] in 1968.

==Legal career==
He was employed by Hullin, Ehrlichman, Roberts and Hodge, the [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]] law firm of family friend [[John Ehrlichman]], and joined Ehrlichman in the counsel's office of Nixon's 1968 presidential campaign.  After Nixon was elected, Krogh helped with the arrangements for the [[inauguration]].  Krogh joined the Nixon [[White House]] as an advisor on the [[District of Columbia]] and later served as liaison to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] and the [[Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs]].  It was there he met [[G. Gordon Liddy]].

==Elvis Presley==
Because of his work regarding illegal drugs, Krogh managed the visit of [[Elvis Presley]] to the White House on December 21, 1970. Presley had arrived at the gate with a letter for President Nixon requesting a personal meeting to discuss how he could help the government fight the drug trade. The meeting took place and Nixon gave Presley an actual narcotics agent badge. Krogh wrote a book about these events: ''The Day Elvis Met Nixon'' (Pejama Press, 1994, {{ISBN|0-9640251-0-8}}).

==SIU==
Ehrlichman made Krogh head of the "Special Investigation Unit" in the White House, charged with investigating information given covertly to the press by administration staffers. Krogh and his associates were known familiarly as the "[[White House Plumbers|Plumbers]]"—a secret team of operatives charged with fixing "[[political leak|leaks]]." It was an unlikely choice: Krogh had a reputation as someone who obeyed the law so scrupulously that his friends gave him the ironic nickname "Evil Krogh". [[Theodore H. White|Theodore White]] would write "to put Egil Krogh in charge of a secret police operation was equivalent to making [[Frank Merriwell]] chief executive of a [[KGB]] squad." Krogh brought Liddy into his new office.

When the administration decided to pursue the [[Pentagon Papers]] leakers, it was Krogh who approved the September 1971 burglary of the office of [[Lewis Fielding]], the psychiatrist seeing [[Daniel Ellsberg]]. Liddy and [[E. Howard Hunt]] would commit the actual break-in. Ehrlichman, who himself went to prison for Watergate related crimes, would later write in his memoirs this was an example of "such doubtful personal judgment ... that it has to be said [Krogh] materially contributed to the demise of the Nixon administration."

Krogh's employment with the SIU was terminated when he refused to authorize a wiretap. On November 30, 1973, Krogh pleaded guilty to federal charges of conspiring to violate Fielding's civil rights and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.  He was sentenced to two to six years in prison, though he served only four-and-a-half months.&lt;ref name=oped&gt;

The term "ethical trade" first gained currency in the mid-1990s, where it was used as a term for socially responsible sourcing.&lt;ref name="Supermarket Ethics"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Freidberg|first1=Susanne|title=The Contradictions of Clean: Supermarket Ethical Trade and African Horticulture|date=2003|publisher=International Institute for Environment and Development, Sustainable Agriculture and Rural Livelihoods Programme|url=http://pubs.iied.org/pdfs/6361IIED.pdf|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ethical trade addresses the ethical aspects of organisations including worker welfare, agricultural practice, natural resource [[conservation (ethic)|conservation]], and [[sustainability]] of the environment.&lt;ref name="Definition of Ethical Trade"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Murray|first1=Martin|title=Ethical Trading Initiative|url=http://logistics.about.com/od/trendsandissues/a/Ethical-Trading-Initiative-eti.htm|website=logistics.about|accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then, numerous multinational organisations have adopted ethical trade policies by outsourcing to auditing companies to monitor the conditions of workers in their supply chains.&lt;ref name="Definition of Ethical Trade" /&gt;  The leading alliance of these companies, [[trade unions]] and [[non-governmental organisations]] is the [[Ethical Trading Initiative]].&lt;ref name="About ETI"&gt;{{cite web|title=About ETI|url=http://www.ethicaltrade.org/about-eti|website=Ethical Trading Initiative|accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to support business

===Ethical Trading Initiative===
[http://www.ethicaltrade.org/ Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI)] is a [[UK]]-based organisation that reaches out to 9.8 million workers per year.&lt;ref name="Ethical Procurement"&gt;{{cite web|title=Branch Guide to Ethical Procurement|url=https://www.unison.org.uk/upload/sharepoint/On%20line%20Catalogue/21279.pdf|website=Unison|publisher=UNISON|accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since their inception in 1998, they have supported ethical trade in global [[supply chains]] by introducing legal protection for 600,000 migrant workers in the UK, aided movements for the increase of real wages in parts of [[Bangladesh]], and contributed to more than 133,000 improvements to the welfare of workers worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ETI's Key Achievements|url=http://www.ethicaltrade.org/news-and-events/press-resources/eti-key-achievements|website=Ethical Trading Initiative|accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ETI are committed to implementing ethical trade by enforcing corporates to implement the ETI base code in their supply chains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Principles of Implementation|url=http://www.ethicaltrade.org/resources/key-eti-resources/principles-implementation|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ETI base code reflects the commitment to ethical trade by stipulating the need for freely chosen employment, [[freedom of association]], [[Occupational safety and health|safe working conditions]], and reasonable [[working hours]].&lt;ref name="Ethical Procurement" /&gt;

===UN ''Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights''===
In 2011, the [[UN Human Rights Council]] endorsed a set of principles known as the [[UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UN Guiding Principles|url=http://business-humanrights.org/en/un-guiding-principles|website=Business &amp; Human Rights Resource Centre|accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in an attempt to address the issue of human rights in businesses.&lt;ref name="UN Human Rights"&gt;{{cite news|title=New Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights endorsed by the UN Human Rights Councilf|accessdate=13 October 2014|work=United Nations Human Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principles were proposed by Professor [[John Ruggie]] from [[Harvard University]] after six years of research.&lt;ref name="UN Human Rights" /&gt; They are based on 47 consultations and site visits in more than 20 countries, and involve governments, companies, business associations, civil society, and investors.&lt;ref name="UN Human Rights" /&gt; They have been considered "an authoritative global reference point for business and human rights" by [[Oxfam]]&lt;ref name="Ethical OXFAM"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethical trade|url=http://policy-practice.oxfam.org.uk/our-work/private-sector-markets/ethical-trade#af33ef77-502a-43a1-9883-62392f8dba10|website=Oxfam|accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and implement ethical trade by ensuring that governments and companies have a collective responsibility to protect human rights in business enterprises.&lt;ref name="Ethical OXFAM" /&gt;

==Current affairs==
===Cambodia===
On 17 September 2014, over 500 textile workers rallied for an increase in minimum wages in the industrial suburb of [[Phnom Penh]], [[Cambodia]].&lt;ref name=Cambodia&gt;{{cite news|title=Cambodia deploys troops as garment workers renew wage campaign|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-2759198/Cambodia-deploys-troops-garment-workers-renew-wage-campaign.html|accessdate=11 October 2014|work=Daily Mail|publisher=Reuters|date=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The frequent protests regarding the poor working conditions and decline in real wages have become a critical issue for the Cambodian Prime Minister, as the prolonged strikes could result in reduced orders from retail firms such as [[Gap Inc]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] and [[H &amp; M]] that outsource to Cambodian factories.&lt;ref name=Cambodia /&gt; Recent findings gathered from workers indicate that over 33% of garment workers are medically underweight, earning around £51 per month as minimum wage, and subjected to the conditions of modern-day slavery.&lt;ref name="Cambodian Labour"&gt;{{cite web|title=New Research shows clothing factory workers seriously malnourished|url=http://www.labourbehindthelabel.org/staff/item/1179-new-research-shows-clothing-factory-workers-seriously-malnourished|website=Labour Behind the Label|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general secretory of the [[Trade Union Congress]], [[Frances O'Grady]], stated that "European-based corporations have a responsibility to ensure that workers' rights are respected in their supply chains."&lt;ref name="Cambodia's Garment Workers"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leftly|first1=Mark|title=Help Cambodia's garment workers, unions urge Business Secretary|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/help-cambodias-garment-workers-unions-urge-business-secretary-9644675.html|accessdate=11 October 2014|work=The Independent|date=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence outlining the need for ethical trade practices.

===Canada===
The death of a temporary foreign worker, Ivan Guerrero, on a farm in [[Quebec]] once again raised questions about the working conditions of migrants.&lt;ref name="Foreign Worker Quebec"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Noël|first1=Brigitte|last2=Dubreuil|first2=Emilie|title=Temporary foreign worker dies in freak accident, leaves chilling testimony|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/temporary-foreign-worker-dies-in-freak-accident-leaves-chilling-testimony-1.2760160?cmp=fbtl|accessdate=14 October 2014|work=CBC News|date=9 Sep 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gurrerro expressed the hardships he faced through a video he recorded in 2013 with Somos Hermanos, a group dedicated to improving the conditions of migrant workers. In the video Guerrero makes reference to excessive working hours, unpaid overtime, and lack of freedom.&lt;ref name="Foreign Worker Quebec" /&gt; In response to the complaint, Guerrero's employer declined a formal interview. Instead stating that "they were hired to work and not to party" and that he did not call the police as he failed to realise Guerrero was missing.&lt;ref name="Foreign Worker Quebec" /&gt;

===UK===
The number of cases of [[human trafficking]] involving [[forced labour]] has increased to 42% in England and Wales, a 2011 study from [[The Salvation Army]] reported.&lt;ref name="Human Trafficking"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Lydia|title=Human Trafficking for Forced Labour Overtakes Sexual Exploitation for First Time in UK|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/human-trafficking-forced-labour-overtakes-sexual-exploitation-first-time-uk-1469810|accessdate=14 October 2014|work=International Business Times|date=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Karen Bradley]], the minister for modern slavery and organised crime, "there are more people in slavery today than at any other time in human history."&lt;ref name="Human Trafficking" /&gt; Over 80% of the cases of forced labour involved men, with the majority of victims contacting the charity from parts of Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name="Human Trafficking" /&gt; Bradley said the move towards eliminating modern slavery would include a [[Modern Slavery Act 2015|modern slavery bill]] going to Parliament, placing a weighty responsibility on large companies to ensure that their supply chains are free from slavery.&lt;ref name="Human Trafficking" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8712">[[File:Existential crisis.jpg|thumb|Feelings of loneliness and insignificance in the face of nature are common in existential crisis.]]
An '''existential crisis''' is a moment at which an individual questions if their life has [[Meaning of life|meaning]], purpose, or value.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fAFg7z93gDwC&amp;pg=PA13 |title=Crisis intervention strategies |author=Richard K. James}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be commonly, but not necessarily, tied to depression or inevitably negative speculations on purpose in life (e.g., "if one day I will be forgotten, what is the point of all of my work?"). This issue of the meaning and purpose of human [[existence]] is a major focus of the [[philosophy|philosophical]] tradition of [[existentialism]].

== Description ==
{{Original research|section|date=March 2016}}
An existential crisis may result from, be [[misdiagnosis|misdiagnosed]] as, or be combined with:{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}
* [[Major depressive disorder]]
* [[Depersonalization disorder]]
* [[Borderline personality disorder]]
* [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder]]
* [[Alcohol use disorder]]
* Major sleep deprivation
* Prolonged isolation
* Dissatisfaction with one's life
* Major psychological trauma
* Psychedelic drug trip
* The sense of [[solitude|being alone]] and [[social isolation|isolated]] in the world;
* A new-found grasp or appreciation of one's mortality, perhaps following diagnosis of a major health concern such as a terminal illness;
* Believing that one's life has no purpose or [[interpersonal relationship|external]] meaning;
* Searching for the [[meaning of life]];
* Shattering of one's sense of reality, or how the world is;
* An extremely pleasurable or hurtful experience that leaves one seeking meaning;
* Realizing that the [[Universe]] is more complex, mysterious, and larger beyond current human understanding; 

An existential crisis is often provoked by a significant event in the person's life—psychological trauma, marriage, separation, major loss, the death of a loved one, a life-threatening experience, a new love partner, psychoactive drug use, adult children leaving home, reaching a personally significant age (turning 16, turning 40, etc.), etc. Usually, it provokes the sufferer's [[introspection]] about personal mortality, thus revealing the [[psychological repression]] of said awareness.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

An existential crisis may resemble [[anomie]] (a personal condition resulting from a lack of [[Norm (sociology)|norms]]) or a [[midlife crisis]]. An existential crisis may stem from one's new perception of life and existence. Analogously, existentialism posits that a person ''can and does'' define the meaning and purpose of his or her life, and therefore must ''choose'' to resolve the crisis of [[existence]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

In existentialist philosophy, the term 'existential crisis' specifically relates to the crisis of the individual when they realize that they must always define their own lives through the choices they make. The existential crisis occurs when one recognizes that even the decision to either refrain from action or withhold assent to a particular choice is, in itself, a choice. In other words, humankind is "condemned" to freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Flynn|first=Thomas|title=Jean-Paul Sartre|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sartre/#Ont|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Handling ==
Existential crisis has often been negatively associated with [[Depression (mood)|depression]].

[[Peter Wessel Zapffe]], a [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] [[philosopher]] and adherent of [[Existential nihilism|nihilism]] and [[antinatalism]], asserted in his book, ''[[The Last Messiah]]'', four ways that he believed all [[self-consciousness|self-conscious]] beings use in order to cope with their apprehension of indifference and absurdity in existence, comprising "anchoring", "isolation", "distraction", and "sublimation":&lt;ref&gt;Zapffe, Peter Wessel, {{cite web | title=The Last Messiah | work=Philosophy Now | url=http://www.philosophynow.org/issue45/45zapffe.htm | accessdate=April 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Anchoring'' is the "fixation of points within, or construction of walls around, the liquid fray of consciousness". The anchoring mechanism provides individuals with a value or an ideal that allows them to focus their attentions in a consistent manner. Zapffe also applied the anchoring principle to society, and stated "God, the Church, the State, morality, fate, the laws of life, the people, the future" are all examples of collective primary anchoring firmaments.
* ''Isolation'' is "a fully arbitrary dismissal from consciousness of all disturbing and destructive thought and feeling".
* ''Distraction'' occurs when "one limits attention to the critical bounds by constantly enthralling it with impressions". Distraction focuses all of one's energy on a task or idea to prevent the mind from turning in on itself.
* ''[[Sublimation (psychology)|Sublimation]]'' is the refocusing of energy away from negative outlets, toward positive ones. Individuals distance themselves and look at their existence from an aesthetic point of view (e.g., writers, poets, painters). Zapffe himself pointed out that his written works were the product of sublimation.

==Cultural contexts==
In the 19th century, [[Kierkegaard]] considered that [[angst]] and existential despair would appear when an inherited or borrowed world-view (often of a collective nature) proved unable to handle unexpected and extreme life-experiences.&lt;ref&gt;S. Kierkegaard, ''The Sickness unto Death'' (1980) p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nietzsche]] extended his views to suggest that the [[Death of God]]—the loss of collective faith in religion and traditional morality—created a more widespread existential crisis for the philosophically aware.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Camus, ''The Rebel'' (Vintage 1950[?]) p. 66-77&lt;/ref&gt;

Existential crisis has indeed been seen as the inevitable accompaniment of [[modernism]] ({{Circa}}1890–1945).&lt;ref&gt;M. Hardt/K. Weeks, ''The Jameson Reader'' (2000) p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas [[Durkheim]] saw individual crises as the byproduct of social pathology and a (partial) lack of collective norms,&lt;ref&gt;E. Durkeheim, ''[[Suicide (book)|Suicide]]'' (1952) p. 214 and p. 382&lt;/ref&gt; others have seen existentialism as arising more broadly from the modernist crisis of the loss of meaning throughout the modern world.&lt;ref&gt;M. Hardt/K. Weeks, ''The Jameson Reader (2000) p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; Its twin answers were either a religion revivified by the experience of anomie (as with [[Martin Buber]]), or an individualistic existentialism based on facing directly the absurd contingency of human fate within a meaningless and alien universe, as with [[Sartre]] and [[Albert Camus|Camus]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Childers/G. Hentzi eds., ''The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (1995) p. 103-4&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Irvin Yalom]], an emeritus professor of psychiatry at Stanford University has made fundamental contributions to the field of [[existential psychotherapy]]. [[Rollo May]] is another of the founders of this approach.

[[Fredric Jameson]] has suggested that [[postmodernism]], with its saturation of social space by a visual consumer culture, has replaced the modernist angst of the traditional subject, and with it the existential crisis of old, by a new social pathology of flattened affect and a fragmented subject.&lt;ref&gt;M. Hardt/K. Weeks, ''The Jameson Reader'' (2000) p. 267-8 and p. 199-200&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21476">'''Functional fixedness''' is a [[cognitive bias]] that limits a person to use an object only in the way it is traditionally used. The concept of functional fixedness originated in [[Gestalt psychology]], a movement in psychology that emphasizes [[holism|holistic]] processing. [[Karl Duncker]] defined functional fixedness as being a "mental block against using an object in a new way that is required to solve a problem".&lt;ref name=Duncker1945&gt;Duncker, K. (1945). "On problem solving". ''[[Psychological Monographs]]'', 58:5 (Whole No. 270).&lt;/ref&gt; This "block" limits the ability of an individual to use components given to them to complete a task, as they cannot move past the original purpose of those components. For example, if someone needs a paperweight, but they only have a hammer, they may not see how the hammer can be used as a paperweight. Functional fixedness is this inability to see a hammer's use as anything other than for pounding nails; the person couldn't think to use the hammer in a way other than in its conventional function.

When tested, 5-year-old children show no signs of functional fixedness. It has been argued that this is because at age 5, any goal to be achieved with an object is equivalent to any other goal. However, by age 7, children have acquired the tendency to treat the originally intended purpose of an object as special.&lt;ref&gt;German, T.P., &amp; Defeyter, M.A. (2000). "Immunity to functional fixedness in young children". ''[[Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review]]'', 7(4), 707-712.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples in research==
Experimental paradigms typically involve solving problems in novel situations in which the subject has the use of a familiar object in an unfamiliar context.  The object may be familiar from the subject's past experience or from previous tasks within an experiment.

=== Candle box ===
{{main|Candle problem}}
[[Image:genimage.jpg|frame|Candle box problem diagram]]
In a classic experiment demonstrating functional fixedness, Duncker (1945)&lt;ref name=Duncker1945/&gt; gave participants a candle, a box of thumbtacks, and a book of matches, and asked them to attach the candle to the wall so that it did not drip onto the table below. Duncker found that participants tried to attach the candle directly to the wall with the tacks, or to glue it to the wall by melting it. Very few of them thought of using the inside of the box as a candle-holder and tacking this to the wall. In Duncker's terms, the participants were "fixated" on the box's normal function of holding thumbtacks and could not re-conceptualize it in a manner that allowed them to solve the problem. For instance, participants presented with an empty tack box were two times more likely to solve the problem than those presented with the tack box used as a container&lt;ref name=Adamson1952&gt;Adamson, R.E. (1952). "Functional Fixedness as related to problem solving: A repetition of three experiments". ''[[Journal of Experimental Psychology]]'', 44, 288-291.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, Frank and Ramscar (2003)&lt;ref&gt;Frank, Michael C., and Michael Ramscar. "How do Presentation and Context Influence Representation for Functional Fixedness Tasks?" ''Proceedings of the 25th Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society'', 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; gave a written version of the candle problem to undergraduates at Stanford. When the problem was given with identical instructions to those in the original experiment, only 23% of the students were able to solve the problem. For another group of students, the noun phrases such as "box of matches" were underlined, and for a third group, the nouns (e.g., "box") were underlined.  For these two groups, 55% and 47% were able to solve the problem effectively. In a follow-up experiment, all the nouns except "box" were underlined and similar results were produced. The authors concluded that students' performance was contingent on their representation of the lexical concept "box" rather than instructional manipulations. The ability to overcome functional fixedness was contingent on having a flexible representation of the word box which allows students to see that the box can be used when attaching a candle to a wall.

When Adamson (1952)&lt;ref name=Adamson1952/&gt; replicated Duncker's box experiment, Adamson split participants into 2 experimental groups: preutilization and no preutilization. In this experiment, when there is preutilization, meaning when objects are presented to participants in a traditional manner (materials are in the box, thus using the box as a container), participants are less likely to consider the box for any other use, whereas with no preutilization (when boxes are presented empty), participants are more likely to think of other uses for the box.

===Two-cord problem===
Birch and Rabinowitz (1951)&lt;ref&gt;Birch, H.G., &amp; Rabinowitz, H.S. (1951). "The negative effect of previous experience on productive thinking". ''Journal of Experimental Psychology'', 41, 121-125.&lt;/ref&gt; adapted the two-cord problem from [[Norman Maier]] (1930, 1931), where subjects would be given 2 cords hanging from the ceiling, and 2 heavy objects in the room. They are told they must connect the cords, but they are just far enough apart that one cannot reach the other easily. The solution was to tie one of the heavy objects to a cord and be a weight, and swing the cord as a pendulum, catch the rope as it swings while holding on to the other rope, and then tie them together. The participants are split into 3 groups: Group R, which completes a pretask of completing an electrical circuit by using a relay, Group S, which completes the circuit with a switch, and Group C which is the control group given no pretest experience. Group R participants were more likely to use the switch as the weight, and Group S were more likely to use the relay. Both groups did so because their previous experience led them to use the objects a certain way, and functional fixedness did not allow them to see the objects as being used for another purpose.

=== Barometer question ===
{{main|Barometer question}}
The barometer question is an example of an incorrectly designed examination question demonstrating functional fixedness that causes a moral dilemma for the examinator. In its classic form, popularized by American test designer professor Alexander Calandra (1911–2006), the question asked the student to "show how it is possible to determine the height of a tall building with the aid of a barometer?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/SaturdayRev-1968dec21-00060?View=PDF|title="Angels on a Pin" by Alexander Calandra, The Saturday Review, Saturday, December 21st, 1968|website=UNZ.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The examinator was confident that there was one, and only one, correct answer. Contrary to the examinator's expectations, the student responded with a series of completely different answers. These answers were also correct, yet none of them proved the student's competence in the specific academic field being tested.

Calandra presented the incident as a real-life, [[First-person narrative|first-person]] experience that occurred during the [[Sputnik crisis]].&lt;ref name=C229&gt;Calandra, Alexander, "Angels on a Pin". Reproduced in Barnes et al., pp. 228-229. p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt; Calandra's essay, "Angels on a Pin", was published in 1959 in ''Pride'', a magazine of the [[Council for Advancement and Support of Education|American College Public Relations Association]].&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=DNWgAAAAMAAJ Pride, volumes 3-4]'' (1959).

== Current conceptual relevance ==

===Is functional fixedness universal?===
Researchers have investigated whether functional fixedness is affected by [[culture]].
 
In a recent study, preliminary evidence supporting the universality of functional fixedness was found.&lt;ref name=GermanBarrett2005&gt;German, T.P., &amp; Barrett, H.C. (2005). [http://www.anthro.ucla.edu/faculty/barrett/german-barrett-PS.pdf "Functional Fixedness in a Technologically Sparse Culture"]. ''[[Psychological Science (journal)|Psychological Science]]'', 16, 1-5.&lt;/ref&gt; The study's purpose was to test if individuals from non-industrialized societies, specifically with low exposure to "high-tech" artifacts, demonstrated functional fixedness. The study tested the [[Shuar]], hunter-horticulturalists of the Amazon region of Ecuador, and compared them to a control group from an industrial culture.

The Shuar community had only been exposed to a limited amount of industrialized artifacts, such as machete, axes, cooking pots, nails, shotguns, and fishhooks, all considered "low-tech". Two tasks were assessed to participants for the study: the box task, where participants had to build a tower to help a character from a fictional storyline to reach another character with a limited set of varied materials; the spoon task, where participants were also given a problem to solve based on a fictional story of a rabbit that had to cross a river (materials were used to represent settings) and they were given varied materials including a spoon. In the box-task, participants were slower to select the materials than participants in control conditions, but no difference in time to solve the problem was seen. In the spoon task, participants were slower in selection and completion of task. Results showed that Individuals from non-industrial ("technologically sparse cultures") were susceptible to functional fixedness. They were faster to use artifacts without priming than when design function was explained to them. This occurred even though participants were less exposed to industrialized manufactured artifacts, and that the few artifacts they currently use were used in multiple ways regardless of their design.&lt;ref name=GermanBarrett2005/&gt;

==="Following the Wrong Footsteps: Fixation Effects of Pictorial Examples in a Design Problem-Solving Task"===

Investigators examined in two experiments "whether the inclusion of examples with inappropriate elements, in addition to the instructions for a design problem, would produce fixation effects in students naive to design tasks".&lt;ref&gt;Chrysikou, Evangelia G.; Weisberg, Robert W. "Following the Wrong Footsteps: Fixation Effects of Pictorial Examples in a Design Problem-Solving Task". ''[[Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition]]'', Vol 31(5), Sep 2005, 1134-1148. {{doi|10.1037/0278-7393.31.5.1134}}&lt;/ref&gt; They examined the inclusion of examples of inappropriate elements, by explicitly depicting problematic aspects of the problem presented to the students through example designs. They tested non-expert participants on three problem conditions: with standard instruction, fixated (with inclusion of problematic design), and defixated (inclusion of problematic design accompanied with helpful methods). They were able to support their hypothesis by finding that a) problematic design examples produce significant fixation effects, and b) fixation effects can be diminished with the use of defixating instructions.

In "The Disposable Spill-Proof Coffee Cup Problem", adapted from Janson &amp; Smith, 1991, participants were asked to construct as many designs as possible for an inexpensive, disposable, spill-proof coffee cup. Standard condition participants were presented only with instructions. In the fixated condition, participants were presented with instructions, a design, and problems they should be aware of. Finally, in the defixated condition, participants were presented the same as other conditions in addition to suggestions of design elements they should avoid using. The other two problems included building a bike rack, and designing a container for cream cheese.

==Techniques to avoid functional fixedness==

===Overcoming functional fixedness in science classrooms with analogical transfer===

Based on the assumption that students are functionally fixed, a study on analogical transfer in the science classroom shed light on significant data that could provide an overcoming technique for functional fixedness. The findings support the fact that students show positive transfer (performance) on problem solving after being presented with analogies of certain structure and format.&lt;ref name=Solomon1994&gt;Solomon, I. (1994). "Analogical Transfer and 'Functional Fixedness' in the Science Classroom". ''[[Journal of Educational Research]]'', 87(6), 371-377.&lt;/ref&gt; The present study expanded Duncker's experiments from 1945 by trying to demonstrate that when students were "presented with a single analogy formatted as a problem, rather than as a story narrative, they would orient the task of problem-solving and facilitate positive transfer".&lt;ref name=Solomon1994/&gt;

A total of 266 freshmen students from a high school science class participated in the study. The experiment was a 2x2 design where conditions: "task contexts" (type and format) vs. "prior knowledge" (specific vs. general) were attested. Students were classified into 5 different groups, where 4 were according to their prior science knowledge (ranging from specific to general), and 1 served as a control group (no analog presentation). The 4 different groups were then classified into "analog type and analog format" conditions, structural or surface types and problem or surface formats.

Inconclusive evidence was found for positive analogical transfer based on prior knowledge; however, groups did demonstrate variability. The problem format and the structural type of analog presentation showed the highest positive transference to problem solving. The researcher suggested that a well-thought and planned analogy relevant in format and type to the problem-solving task to be completed can be helpful for students to overcome functional fixedness. This study not only brought new knowledge about the human mind at work but also provides important tools for educational purposes and possible changes that teachers can apply as aids to lesson plans.&lt;ref name=Solomon1994/&gt;

===Uncommitting===
One study suggests that functional fixedness can be combated by design decisions from functionally fixed designs so that the essence of the design is kept (Latour, 1994).&lt;ref name=Latour1994&gt;Latour, Larry (1994). [http://www.umcs.maine.edu/~larry/latour/ECAI/paper-sent/paper-sent.html "Controlling Functional Fixedness: the Essence of Successful Reuse"].&lt;/ref&gt; This helps the subjects who have created functionally fixed designs understand how to go about solving general problems of this type, rather than using the fixed solution for a specific problem. Latour performed an experiment researching this by having software engineers analyze a fairly standard bit of code—the [[quicksort]] algorithm—and use it to create a partitioning function. Part of the quicksort algorithm involves partitioning a list into subsets so that it can be sorted; the experimenters wanted to use the code from within the algorithm to just do the partitioning. To do this, they abstracted each block of code in the function, discerning the purpose of it, and deciding if it is needed for the partitioning algorithm. This abstracting allowed them to reuse the code from the quicksort algorithm to create a working partition algorithm without having to design it from scratch.&lt;ref name=Latour1994/&gt;

===Overcoming prototypes===
A comprehensive study exploring several classical functional fixedness experiments showed an overlying theme of overcoming prototypes. Those that were successful at completing the tasks had the ability to look beyond the prototype, or the original intention for the item in use. Conversely, those that could not create a successful finished product could not move beyond the original use of the item. This seemed to be the case for functional fixedness categorization studies as well. Reorganization into categories of seemingly unrelated items was easier for those that could look beyond intended function. Therefore, there is a need to overcome the prototype in order to avoid functional fixedness. Carnevale (1998)&lt;ref name=Carnevale1998&gt;Carnevale, Peter J. (1998). "Social Values and Social Conflict Creative Problem Solving and Categorization". ''[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]'', 74(5), 1300.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests analyzing the object and mentally breaking it down into its components. After that is completed, it is essential to explore the possible functions of those parts. In doing so, an individual may familiarize themselves with new ways to use the items that are available to them at the givens. Individuals are therefore thinking creatively and overcoming the prototypes that limit their ability to successfully complete the functional fixedness problem.&lt;ref name=Carnevale1998/&gt;

===The generic parts technique===
For each object, you need to decouple its function from its form. McCaffrey (2012)&lt;ref&gt;McCaffrey, T. (2012). "Innovation relies on the obscure: A key to overcoming the classic functional fixedness problem". ''Psychological Science'', 23(3), 215-218.&lt;/ref&gt; shows a highly effective technique for doing so. As you break an object into its parts, ask yourself two questions. "Can I subdivide the current part further?" If yes, do so. "Does my current description imply a use?" If yes, create a more generic description involving its shape and material. For example, initially I divide a candle into its parts: wick and wax. The word "wick" implies a use: burning to emit light. So, describe it more generically as a string. Since "string" implies a use, I describe it more generically: interwoven fibrous strands. This brings to mind that I could use the wick to make a wig for my hamster. Since "interwoven fibrous strands" does not imply a use, I can stop working on wick and start working on wax. People trained in this technique solved 67% more problems that suffered from functional fixedness than a control group. This technique systematically strips away all the layers of associated uses from an object and its parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mie.umass.edu/news/mccaffrey-develops-toolkit-boosting-problem-solving-skills|title=McCaffrey Develops Toolkit for Boosting Problem-solving Skills - Mechanical and Industrial Engineering - UMass Amherst|website=mie.umass.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[social psychology]], '''fundamental attribution error''' ('''FAE'''), also known as '''correspondence bias''' or '''attribution effect''', is the concept that, in contrast to interpretations of their own behavior, people tend to (unduly) emphasize the agent's internal characteristics (character or intention), rather than external factors, in explaining other people's behavior. This effect has been described as "the tendency to believe that what people do reflects who they are".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.coursera.org/learn/change/lecture/3m1nZ/9-5|title=Scripts and Schemas|last=Bicchieri|first=Cristina|date=|website=Coursera - Social Norms, Social Change II|access-date=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the term and example==
The phrase was coined by [[Lee Ross]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Advances in experimental social psychology|last=Ross|first=L.|publisher=Academic Press|year=1977|isbn=0-12-015210-X|editor-last=Berkowitz|editor-first=L.|volume=10|location=New York|pages=173–220|chapter=The intuitive psychologist and his shortcomings: Distortions in the attribution process}}&lt;/ref&gt; some years after a classic experiment by [[Edward E.

Jones wrote that he found Ross' phrase "overly provocative and somewhat misleading", and also joked: "Furthermore, I'm angry that I didn't think of it first."&lt;ref name="gilbert2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Attribution and social interaction: The legacy of E.

As a simple example of the behavior attribution error theory seeks to explain, consider the situation where Alice, a driver, is cut off in traffic by Bob. Alice attributes Bob's behavior to his fundamental personality, e.g. he thinks only of himself, he is selfish, he is a jerk, he is an unskilled driver; she does not think it is situational, e.g. he is going to miss his flight, his wife is giving birth at the hospital, his daughter is convulsing at school. Consider too the situation where Alice makes the same mistake and excuses herself by saying she was influenced by situational causes, e.g. I am late for my job interview, I must pick up my son for his dentist appointment; she does not think she has a flaw in her internal characteristics, e.g. I am such a jerk, I treat others in contempt, I am bad at driving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/glossary/fundamental-attribution-error|title=Fundamental Attribution Error - Ethics Unwrapped|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classic demonstration study: Jones and Harris (1967)===

Jones and Harris hypothesized, based on the [[correspondent inference theory]], that people would attribute apparently freely chosen behaviors to disposition and apparently chance-directed behaviors to situation. The hypothesis was confounded by the fundamental attribution error.&lt;ref name="JonesHarris67"/&gt;

Subjects in an experiment read essays for and against [[Fidel Castro]] and were asked to rate the pro-Castro attitudes of the writers. When the subjects believed that the writers freely chose positions for or against Castro, they would normally rate the people who spoke in liking of Castro as having a more positive attitude towards Castro. However, contradicting Jones and Harris' initial hypothesis, when the subjects were told that the writers' positions were determined by a coin toss, they still rated writers who spoke in favor of Castro as having, on average, a more positive attitude towards Castro than those who spoke against him. In other words, the subjects were unable to properly see the influence of the situational constraints placed upon the writers; they could not refrain from attributing sincere belief to the writers. Therefore, the experimental group provided more internal attributions towards the writer.

== Tests of the error ==
The hypothesis that people tend to over-attribute behavior to traits, or at least do so for the behavior of others, has been contested. For instance Epstein and Teraspulsky &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Epstein|first=Seymour|last2=Teraspulsky|first2=Laurie|title=Perception of cross-situational consistency.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0022-3514.50.6.1152|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=50|issue=6|pages=1152–1160|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.50.6.1152}}&lt;/ref&gt; tested whether subjects over-, under-, or correctly estimate the empirical correlation among behaviors. (These behavioral consistencies are what "traits" describe.) They found that estimates of correlations among behaviors correlated strongly with empirically observed correlations among these behaviors. Subjects were sensitive to even very small correlations, and their confidence in the association tracked how far they were discrepant (i.e., if they knew when they did not know), and was higher for the strongest relations. Subjects also showed awareness of the effect of aggregation over occasions and used reasonable strategies to arrive at decisions. Epstein concluded that "Far from being inveterate trait believers, as has been previously suggested, [subjects'] intuitions paralleled psychometric principles in several important respects when assessing relations between real-life behaviors."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

While described as "robust, firmly established, and pervasive", [[meta-analysis]] of the 173 qualified studies of the actor-observer asymmetry available by 2005 established, surprisingly, an [[effect size]] of near zero.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These analyses allowed a systematic review of where, if at all, the effect holds. These analyses showed that the asymmetry was found only when 1. the other person was portrayed as being very unusual, 2. when hypothetical (rather than real) events were explained, 3. when people were intimate (knew each other well), or 4. when researcher-[[degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]] were high.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It appeared that in these circumstances two asymmetries were observed: negative events were asymmetrically attributed to traits in others, but the reverse held for positive events, supporting a [[Self-serving bias|self-serving]] bias rather than an actor–observer asymmetry.

==Explanations==

Several theories predict the fundamental attribution error, and thus both compete to explain it, and can be falsified if it does not occur. Leading examples include:
# '''[[Just-world fallacy]].''' The belief that people get what they deserve and deserve what they get, the concept of which was first theorized by [[Melvin J. Lerner]] (1977).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lerner | first1 = M. J. | last2 = Miller | first2 = D.

Therefore, when situational information is not sufficiently taken into account for adjustment, the uncorrected dispositional inference creates the fundamental attribution error.

==Versus correspondence bias==

The fundamental attribution error is commonly used interchangeably with "correspondence bias" (sometimes called "correspondence inference", although this phrase refers to a judgment which does not necessarily constitute a bias, which arises when the inference drawn is incorrect, e.g. dispositional inference when the actual cause is situational). However, there has been debate about whether the two terms should be distinguished from each other. Three main differences between these two judgmental processes have been argued:
# They seem to be elicited under different circumstances, as both correspondent dispositional inferences and situational inferences can be elicited spontaneously.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, D. L. (1988). Causal attributions viewed from an information-processing perspective. In D. Bar-Tal &amp; A. W. Kruglanski (Eds.) ''The social psychology of knowledge''. (Pp. 369-385.) Cambridge, England, Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Attributional processing, however, seems to only occur when the event is unexpected or conflicting with prior expectations. This notion is supported by a study conducted by Semin and Marsman (1994),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Semin | first1 = G. R. | last2 = Marsman | first2 = J. G. | year = 1994 | title = Multiple inference-inviting properties" of interpersonal verbs: Event instigation, dispositional inference and implicit causality | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 67 | issue = 5| pages = 836–849 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.67.5.836}}&lt;/ref&gt; which found that different types of verbs invited different inferences and attributions. Correspondence inferences were invited to a greater degree by interpretative action verbs (such as "to help") than state action or state verbs, thus suggesting that the two are produced under different circumstances.
# Correspondence inferences and causal attributions also differ in automaticity. Inferences can occur spontaneously if the behavior implies a situational or dispositional inference, while causal attributions occur much more slowly (e.g. Smith &amp; Miller, 1983).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = E. R. | last2 = Miller | first2 = F. D. | year = 1983 | title = Mediation among attributional inferences and comprehension processes: Initial findings and a general method | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 44 | issue = 3| pages = 492–505 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.44.3.492}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# It has also been suggested that correspondence inferences and causal attributions are elicited by different mechanisms. It is generally agreed that correspondence inferences are formed by going through several stages. Firstly, the person must interpret the behavior, and then, if there is enough information to do so, add situational information and revise their inference. They may then further adjust their inferences by taking into account dispositional information as well.&lt;ref name="Gilbert1989"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Krull | first1 = D. S. | last2 = Dill | first2 = J. C. | year = 1996 | title = Thinking first and responding fast: Flexibility in social inference processes | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 22 | issue = 9| pages = 949–959 | doi=10.1177/0146167296229008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Causal attributions however seem to be formed either by processing visual information using perceptual mechanisms, or by activating knowledge structures (e.g. schemas) or by systematic data analysis and processing.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, C. A., Krull, D. S., &amp; Weiner, B. (1996). Explanations: Processes and consequences. In E. T. Higgins &amp; A. W. Kruglanski (Eds.), ''Social psychology: Handbook of basic principles'' (pp. 221-296). New York, Guilford.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, due to the difference in theoretical structures, correspondence inferences are more strongly related to behavioral interpretation than causal attributions.

Based on the preceding differences between causal attribution and correspondence inference, some researchers argue that the fundamental attribution error should be considered as the tendency to make dispositional rather than situational explanations for behavior, whereas the correspondence bias should be considered as the tendency to draw correspondent dispositional inferences from behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, D. L. (1998). Dispositional and attributional inferences in person perception. In J. M. Darley &amp; J. Cooper (Eds.), ''Attribution and social interaction'' (pp. 99-114). Washington, DC, American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Krull2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Krull|first1=Douglas S.|editor1-last=Moskowitz|editor1-first=Gordon B.|title=Cognitive Social Psychology: The Princeton Symposium on the Legacy and Future of Social Cognition|date=2001|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=1135664250|pages=211–227|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DE-cJ8F4rSMC&amp;pg=PA211&amp;lpg=PA211|language=en|chapter=On partitioning the fundamental attribution error: Dispositionalism and the correspondence bias|location=Mahwah, New Jersey, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; With such distinct definitions between the two, some cross-cultural studies also found that cultural differences of correspondence bias are not equivalent to those of fundamental attribution error. While the latter has been found to be more prevalent in individualistic cultures than collectivistic cultures, correspondence bias occurs across cultures,&lt;ref&gt;Masuda, T., &amp; Kitayama, S. (1996). ''Culture-specificity of correspondence bias: Dispositional inference in Japan.'' Paper presented at the 13th Congress of the International Association for Cross-Cultural Psychology, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Choi | first1 = I. | last2 = Nisbett | first2 = R.

[[File:HOTOL.JPG|thumb|An artist's depiction of HOTOL]]
'''HOTOL''', for '''Horizontal Take-Off and Landing''', was a 1980s [[United Kingdom|British]] design for a [[single-stage-to-orbit]] (SSTO) [[spaceplane]] that was to be powered by an [[airbreathing jet engine]]. Development was being conducted by a consortium led by [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]] and [[British Aerospace]] (BAe).

Designed as a [[single-stage-to-orbit]] (SSTO) reusable winged launch vehicle, HOTOL was to be fitted with a unique air-breathing engine, the RB545 or Swallow, that was under development by British engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce. The propellant for the engine technically consisted of a combination of liquid [[hydrogen]]/liquid [[oxygen]]; however, it was to employ a new means of dramatically reducing the amount of oxidizer needed to be carried on board by utilising atmospheric oxygen as the spacecraft climbed through the lower atmosphere. Since propellant typically represents the majority of the takeoff weight of a rocket, HOTOL was to be considerably smaller than normal pure-rocket designs, roughly the size of a medium-haul airliner such as the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9]]/MD-80.

While HOTOL's [[proof-of-concept]] design study was being carried out, attempts were made by both industry and the British government to establish international cooperation to develop, produce, and deploy the spacecraft. In spite of American interest in the programme, there was little appetite amongst the members of the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA), and the British government was not prepared to depart from ESA cooperation. Additionally, technical issues were encountered, and there were allegations that comparisons with alternative launch systems such as conventional rocket vehicle using similar construction techniques failed to show much advantage to HOTOL. In 1989, funding for the project ended. The termination of development work on HOTOL led to the formation of [[Reaction Engines Limited]] (REL) to develop and produce [[Skylon (spacecraft)|Skylon]], a proposed spacecraft based on HOTOL technologies, including its engine.

==Development==
===Origins===
The ideas behind HOTOL originated from work done by British Engineer [[Alan Bond (engineer)|Alan Bond]] in the field of precooled jet engines. Bond had specifically performed this research with the intention of producing a viable engine for powering a space [[launch system]].&lt;ref name="3rocket"&gt;{{cite av media |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01mqv45 |title=BBC Four: The Three Rocketeers |publisher = [[BBC]] |accessdate=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, [[British Aerospace]] (BAe), which was Europe's principal [[satellite]]-builder, began studying a prospective new launch system with the aim of providing launch costs that were 20 per cent of the American [[Space Shuttle]] operated by [[NASA]].&lt;ref name = "moxon 38"/&gt; BAe became aware of work by British engine manufacturer [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]] on a suitable engine, and soon conceived of an unmanned, fully reuseable [[single-stage-to-orbit]] (SSTO) winged spaceplane as a launch vehicle.&lt;ref name = "moxon 38"/&gt;

Thus, the project had soon became a joint venture between BAe and Rolls-Royce, led by [[John Scott-Scott (engineer)|John Scott-Scott]] and [[Bob Parkinson (aerospace engineer)|Dr Bob Parkinson]].&lt;ref name = "moxon 38"&gt;Moxon 1986, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Early on, there was an ambition to 'Europeanise' the project and to involve other nations in its development and manufacture as it was recognised that an estimated £4 billion would be needed to fund full-scale development.&lt;ref name = "moxon 38"/&gt; In August 1984, BAe unveiled a public display of the HOTOL satellite launcher project and released details on its proposed operations.&lt;ref name = "secret 2009"/&gt;

In December 1984, a [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] (DTI) memorandum noted that [[West Germany]] was interested in the program, while [[France]] had adopted a critical attitude towards HOTOL, which the ministry viewed as potentially due to it being seen as a competitor to French-led projects. According to the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Minister of Trade and Industry]] [[Geoffrey Pattie]], French diplomatic pressure to gather support for its own proposed [[Hermes (spacecraft)|Hermes]] space vehicle had inadvertently generated support and interest amongst [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) members in the HOTOL project.&lt;ref name = "secret 2009"/&gt; Despite this climate of tentative interest and possible European support, there was a general attitude of reluctance within the British government to take the lead on a new space launcher.&lt;ref name = "secret 2009"/&gt;

===American interest and design study===
In March 1985, there were claims that Rolls-Royce was in the process of conducting [[Licensed production|licensing]] talks for HOTOL engine technology with American propulsion company [[Rocketdyne]].&lt;ref name = "secret 2009"/&gt; In April 1985, Pattie wrote to [[Secretary of State for Defence]] [[Michael Heseltine]] to propose a two-year £3 million [[proof of concept]] study be performed under a [[public-private partnership]] arrangement, consisting of £1 million provided by the UK government and the remainder being financed by Rolls-Royce and BAe themselves. Pattie reasoned that the project would serve Britain's "strategic capability, and that tests of key technologies could foster international collaboration.&lt;ref name = "secret 2009"/&gt; According to aerospace publication [[Flight International]], the support of the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defense]] (MoD) was critical as the design of HOTOL's engine had been classified.&lt;ref name = "secret 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "moxon 38"/&gt;

In July 1985, Rolls-Royce's technical director Gordon Lewis stated that the firm sought the involvement of the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]]'s (RAE) propulsion group, and that Rolls-Royce was not prepared to invest its own funds into engine development for HOTOL.&lt;ref name = "secret 2009"/&gt; By the second half of 1985, work had commenced on the two-year concept-of-proof study.&lt;ref name = "secret 2009"/&gt; Early on, there was considerable pressure to demonstrate the project's feasibility and credibility in advance of final decisions being taken by the ESA on the Hermes and what would become the [[Ariane 5]] launch system, thus the work concentrated on the validation of critical technologies involved.&lt;ref name = "moxon 38"/&gt;

By November 1985, DTI and RAE discussions noted that Rolls-Royce were seeking American data on [[ramjet]] technology to support their work on the engine, which it referred to by the name ''Swallow''.&lt;ref name = "secret 2009"/&gt; Reportedly, the [[United States Air Force]] were interested in the technology used in the Swallow engine for its own purposes.&lt;ref name = "moxon 38"/&gt; In November 1985, discussions between [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]], [[Minister without portfolio]] [[David Young, Baron Young of Graffham|David Young]] and [[President of the United States|US President]] [[Ronald Reagan]]'s scientific advisor [[George A. Keyworth, II|George Keyworth]] noted American interest in collaboration on developing [[hypersonic]] vehicles such as HOTOL, and that a prototype could be flying as early as 1990.&lt;ref name = "secret 2009"/&gt;

According to British government files, neither BAe nor the MoD were enthusiastic for the prospects of American involvement in the programme, expressing reluctance out of a belief that the outcome of such a move could result in the UK becoming a junior member in a project that it once led.&lt;ref name = "secret 2009"/&gt; There was also a belief that if Britain chose to pair up with the United States, it would find itself frozen out of work on future European launchers.&lt;ref name = "moxon 38"/&gt; However, Rolls-Royce viewed transatlantic cooperation as necessary.&lt;ref name = "secret 2009"/&gt; BAe's head of future business, Peter Conchie, stated that, if possible, HOTOL should become a part of the European space framework.&lt;ref name = "moxon 38"/&gt; In early 1986, the British government formally approved the two-year study.&lt;ref name = "secret 2009"/&gt;

===Problems and criticism===
In December 1984, project management consultant David Andrews issued an eight-page critique of the programme, noting that the design was optimised for the ascent while exposing itself to extended thermal loads during descent due to a low level of [[Aerodynamic drag|drag]]. He also claimed that the vehicle offered no capability that was not already available; BAe responded that the criticisms made had been answered.&lt;ref name = "secret 2009"/&gt; In April 1985, the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]'s research and development department deputy controller James Barnes claimed that HOTOL lacked a justification, and that there was no defence requirement for such vehicles. He also noted that the "engineering problems are considerable" and that it was unlikely to enter service until the 2020s; Barnes also observed the HOTOL engine to be "ingenious".&lt;ref name = "secret 2009"/&gt;

In November 1985, the RAE issued an assessment of HOTOL's study proposal; the organisation believe that HOTOL would take up to 20 years to develop, rather than the 12-year timetable that had been envisioned by industry. The RAE also projected that the project would have an estimated total cost of £5 billion (as of its value in 1985), £750 million of which would be required in a six-year definition phase and an estimated £25 million in a pre-definition feasibility study.&lt;ref name = "secret 2009"/&gt;

During development, it was found that the comparatively heavy rear-mounted engine moved the centre of mass of the vehicle rearwards. This meant that the vehicle had to be designed to push the centre of drag as far rearward as possible to ensure stability during the entire flight regime. Redesign of the vehicle to do this required a large mass of hydraulic systems, which cost a significant proportion of the payload, and made the economics unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sounds.bl.uk/Oral-history/Science/021M-C1379X0005XX-0012V0|title=Oral history of British science|date=2010-11-08|publisher=British Library|accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, some of the analysis seemed to indicate that similar technology applied to a pure rocket approach would give approximately the same performance at less cost.

===Shutdown===
By 1989, the outlook for HOTOL had become bleak; from the onset of the project, support between the British government and industrial partners had been uneven, while the United States had emerged as the only foreign nation that showed willingness to contribute to the programme,&lt;ref name = "secret 2009"/&gt; in part because of the secrecy surrounding the program. There was little prospect for European involvement, the ESA having elected to pursue development of what would become the [[Ariane 5]], a conventional space launch system.&lt;ref name = "secret 2009"/&gt; Rolls-Royce withdrew from the project, judging the eventual market for the engine was unlikely to be large enough to repay the development costs&lt;ref name="Spaceflight 1993"/&gt;.  The British government declined to offer further funding for HOTOL. The project was almost at the end of its design phase while much of the plans remained in a speculative state; the craft was reportedly still dogged with aerodynamic problems and operational disadvantages at this point.

===Successors===
A cheaper redesign, '''Interim HOTOL''' or '''HOTOL 2''', which was to be launched from the back of a modified [[Antonov An-225 Mriya|Antonov An-225 ''Mriya'']] [[Cargo aircraft|transport aircraft]], was promoted by BAe in 1991; however, this proposal was rejected as well. The design for Interim HOTOL was to have dispensed with an air-breathing engine cycle and was designed to use a more conventional mix of LOX and liquid hydrogen as fuel instead.

In 1989, HOTOL co-creator [[Alan Bond (engineer)|Alan Bond]] and engineers John Scott-Scott and Richard Varvill formed [[Reaction Engines Limited]] (REL) which has since been working on a new air-breathing engine, [[SABRE (rocket engine)|SABRE]], which used alternative designs to work around (and improve upon) the Rolls-Royce patents, and the [[Skylon (spacecraft)|Skylon]] vehicle intended to solve the problems of HOTOL. They first published these engine and spacecraft concepts in 1993,&lt;ref name="Skylon 1993"&gt;{{cite magazine |first1= Richard|last1= Varvill |first2= Alan |last2= Bond |title= SKYLON: a Key Element of a Future Space Transportation System |date= May 1993 |pages= 162-166 |issue= 5 |volume= 35 |magazine= [[Spaceflight (magazine)|Spaceflight]] |publisher= [[British Interplanetary Society]] |issn= 0038-6340 |place= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has since been developing the core technologies, particularly the engine and its frost-controlled pre-cooler; initially supported by private funding, but latterly with support from the [[European Space Agency]], the [[British National Space Centre]], the [[United Kingdom Space Agency]], BAe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://aviationweek.com/technology/bae-takes-stake-reaction-engines-hypersonic-development |title=BAE Takes Stake In Reaction Engines Hypersonic Development |last1=Norris |first1=Guy |date=1 November 2015 |website=aviationweek.com |publisher=Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology |accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Air Force Research Laboratory]]. {{As of | 2017}} REL plan to demonstrate a flight-ready pre-cooler operating under simulated flight conditions in 2018, and statically test a demonstration engine core in 2020.

==Design==
===Overview===
HOTOL was envisioned as an unmanned, fully reuseable [[single-stage-to-orbit]] (SSTO) winged spaceplane. The unmanned craft was intended to put a payload of around 7 to 8 [[tonne]]s in orbit, at 300&amp;nbsp;km altitude.&lt;ref name = "moxon 40"/&gt; It was intended to take off from a runway, mounted on the back of a large rocket-boosted trolley that would help get the craft up to "working speed". The engine was intended to switch from jet propulsion to pure rocket propulsion at 26–32&amp;nbsp;km high, by which time the craft would be travelling at [[Mach number|Mach]] 5 to 7. After reaching [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO), HOTOL was intended to re-enter the atmosphere and glide down to land on a conventional runway (approx 1,500 metres minimum). Only a single payload would have been carried at a time as BAe had judged this to be more economic as it removed any need for satellite interfacing and allowed for missions to be tailored to individual requirements.&lt;ref name = "moxon 40"/&gt;

During its high-altitude phase, its [[flight control system]] would have been linked to ground stations and to space-based [[Global Positioning System|global navigation system]] navigation, while [[radar]] would have been used during the take-off and landing phases. In additional to the placing of satellites into [[geosynchronous orbit]] or LOE, HOTOL was also projected as being able to also perform the retrieval of satellites and hardware from LOE.&lt;ref name = "moxon 40"/&gt; BAe promotional material depicts HOTOL docking with the [[International Space Station]] (ISS), a feat that the company claimed would have required manned operate as automated systems were not capable of performing such docking manoeuvres at that time.&lt;ref name = "moxon 40"/&gt; HOTOL was designed to conduct fully automated unmanned flights; however, it had been intended at a later stage to potentially re-introduce a pilot. Manned operations would have required the installation of a dedicated [[Cabin pressurization|pressurised]] module within the payload bay.&lt;ref name = "moxon 40"/&gt;

As designed, HOTOL would have been 62 metres long, 12.8 metres high, a fuselage diameter of 5.7 meters and a wingspan of 19.7 metres.&lt;ref name = "moxon 40"/&gt; It featured a wing design that had been derived from that of [[Concorde]]; its large area resulted in relatively low wing loading, which would have resulted in lower reentry temperatures (never rising above 1,400&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref name = "moxon 40"/&gt; Built out of [[carbon composite]] materials, there would have been no need for the use of insulating tiles akin to those that comprised the [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system]]. The internally stowed landing gear would have been too small to carry the weight of the fully fuelled rocket, so emergency landings would have required the fuel to be dumped.&lt;ref name = "moxon 40"&gt;Moxon 1986, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Engine===
The RB545, which was given the name "Swallow" by its manufacturer, British engine maker [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]], was an air-breathing rocket engine.&lt;ref name = "secret 2009"/&gt; It would have functioned as an integrated dual-role powerplant, having been capable of air-breathing while operating within the [[atmosphere]] and operating in a similar manner to that of a [[rocket]] when having attained close to and within LEO.&lt;ref name = "moxon 38 40"&gt;Moxon 1986, pp. 38, 40.&lt;/ref&gt; This engine would have also been capable of powering the spacecraft to [[hypersonic]] speeds. It was a crucial element of the programme, having been publicly attributed as "the heart of Hotol's very low launch costs".&lt;ref name = "moxon 40"/&gt;

The exact details of this engine were covered by the [[Official Secrets Act]] of the United Kingdom; consequently, there is relatively little public information about its development and on its operation. However, material was later declassified when government policy changed to prevent the keeping of secret patents without an attributed justification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sounds.bl.uk/Oral-history/Eminent-scientists/021M-C1379X0005XX-0010V0 Dr Bob Parkinson discusses HOTOL in an oral history interview recorded for the [[National Life Stories]] project [[Oral History of British Science]] at the [[British Library]]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Spaceflight 1993"&gt;{{cite magazine |first1= Mark |last1= Hempsell |title= HOTOL's Secret Engines Revealed |date= May 1993 |pages= 168-172 |issue= 5 |volume= 35 |magazine= [[Spaceflight (magazine)|Spaceflight]] |publisher= [[British Interplanetary Society]] |issn= 0038-6340 |place= London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the atmosphere, air is taken in through two vertically mounted [[Intake ramp]]s, then the flow would be split, passing the correct amount to the precoolers, and the excess to spill ducts. Hydrogen from the fuel tanks would be passed through two [[Precooled jet engine|heat exchangers to precool the air]] prior to entering a high overall pressure-ratio [[turbojet]]-like engine cycle — the heated hydrogen driving a turbine to compress and feed the cooled air into the rocket engine, where it was combusted with some of the hydrogen used to cool the air. The majority of the remaining hot hydrogen was released from the back of the engine, with a small amount drawn off to reheat the air in the spill ducts in a ramjet arrangement to produce "negative intake momentum drag."{{efn|due to the split in responsibilities of the HOTOL project, Rolls-Royce were responsible for the engine, and BAe were responsible for the aerodynamics. When BAe wanted to add the ramjet it couldn't provide thrust, because that was the responsibility of the engine, so instead it was a mechanism for reducing drag&lt;ref name="Spaceflight 1993"/&gt;}} These ramjets were typically depicted as two glowing red circles below the rocket engines in pictures of HOTOL.

To prevent the precoolers from icing up, the first precooler cooled the air to around 10 degrees above freezing point, to liquefy the water vapour in the air. Then LOX would have been injected into the airflow to drop the temperature to -50C, (-58F) flash freezing the water into microscopic ice crystals, sufficiently cold that they wouldn't melt due to kinetic heating if they struck the second precooler elements. A water trap could have been added after the first precooler if operating conditions resulted in an excess of moisture.&lt;ref name="frost1"&gt;{{cite patent |country= GB |number= 2241537 |status= patent |title= Prevention of icing in the intakes of aerospace propulsors|invent= [[John Scott-Scott]] |invent2 = Bryan Belcher |invent3= [[Alan Bond (engineer)|Alan Bond]] |assign1= Rolls Royce Plc |fdate= 23 March 1988 |pubdate= 1991-09-04 |gdate= 1992-08-12 |class= F02C7/047; F02C7/143; F28F19/006; Y02T50/675 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When it was no longer possible to use the atmosphere for combustion, the RB545 would switch to using on-board liquid oxygen (LOX) to burn with the hydrogen as a high-efficiency hydrogen/oxygen rocket.&lt;ref name = "secret 2009"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/secret-files-reveal-us-interest-in-uk-hotol-spacepla-322955/ |title= Secret files reveal US interest in UK HOTOL spaceplane |publisher = [[Flight International]] |date = 23 February 2009 |first = Rob |last = Coppinger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[music]], '''harmony''' considers the process by which the composition of individual sounds, or superpositions of sounds, is analysed by hearing. Usually, this means simultaneously occurring [[frequencies]], [[pitch (music)|pitches]] ([[timbre|tones]], [[note (music)|notes]]), or [[chord (music)|chords]].&lt;ref&gt;Malm, William P. (1996). ''Music Cultures of the Pacific, the Near East, and Asia'', p.15. {{ISBN|0-13-182387-6}}. Third edition. "Homophonic texture...is more common in Western music, where tunes are often built on chords (harmonies) that move in progressions. Indeed this harmonic orientation is one of the major differences between Western and much non-Western music."&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of harmony involves chords and their construction and [[chord progression]]s and the principles of connection that govern them.&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Harmony|author=Dahlhaus, Car|access-date=24 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harmony is often said to refer to the "vertical" aspect of music, as distinguished from [[melody|melodic line]], or the "horizontal" aspect.&lt;ref name=Jamini&gt;Jamini, Deborah (2005). ''Harmony and Composition: Basics to Intermediate'', p.147. {{ISBN|1-4120-3333-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Counterpoint]], which refers to the relationship between melodic lines, and [[polyphony]], which refers to the simultaneous sounding of separate independent voices, are thus sometimes distinguished from harmony.

In [[popular harmony|popular]] and [[jazz harmony]], chords are named by their [[root (chord)|root]] plus various terms and characters indicating their qualities.  In many types of music, notably baroque, romantic, modern, and jazz, chords are often augmented with "tensions". A tension is an additional chord member that creates a relatively [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonant interval]] in relation to the bass.

Typically, in the classical [[common practice period]] a dissonant chord (chord with tension) "resolves" to a consonant chord. [[Harmonization]] usually sounds pleasant to the ear when there is a balance between the consonant and dissonant sounds. In simple words, that occurs when there is a balance between "tense" and "relaxed" moments.

== Etymology and definitions ==
The term ''harmony'' derives from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἁρμονία}} ''harmonia'', meaning "joint, agreement, concord",&lt;ref&gt;'1. Harmony' ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology in English Language Reference'' accessed via [http://www.oxfordreference.com/ Oxford Reference Online] (24 February 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a(rmoni/a|ἁρμονία|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; from the verb {{lang|grc|ἁρμόζω}} ''harmozō'', "(Ι) fit together, join".&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a(rmo/zw|ἁρμόζω|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, ''harmony'' often referred to the whole field of music, while ''music'' referred to the arts in general.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} In Ancient Greece, the term defined the combination of contrasted elements: a higher and lower note.&lt;ref name="grovelead"&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Harmony|author=Dahlhaus, Carl|access-date=24 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it is unclear whether the simultaneous sounding of notes was part of ancient Greek musical practice; ''harmonía'' may have merely provided a system of classification of the relationships between different pitches.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} In the Middle Ages the term was used to describe two pitches sounding in combination, and in the Renaissance the concept was expanded to denote three pitches sounding together.&lt;ref name = "grovelead" /&gt; [[Aristoxenus]] wrote a work entitled ''[[Elementa harmonica|Harmonika Stoicheia]]'', which is thought the first work in European history written on the subject of harmony.&lt;ref name="Aristoxenus, Henry Stewart Macran"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3TseQjV_wogC&amp;pg=PA165&amp;lpg=PA165&amp;dq=translations+of+Aristoxenus+Elements+of+Harmony&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aDzoOJl1aD&amp;sig=n4ldPcu--zEZ_Kzxv_8MuCe73oY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dL5GVcH6JdjiasmTgPgM&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwADgU#v=onepage&amp;q=translations%20of%20Aristoxenus%20Elements%20of%20Harmony&amp;f=false|author=Aristoxenus, Henry Stewart Macran|title=Harmonika Stoicheia (The Harmonics of Aristoxenus)|publisher=Georg Olms Verlag 1902 {{ISBN|3487405105}}|accessdate=2015-05-04}}(and [http://www.worldcat.org/title/aristoxenoy-armonika-stoicheia-the-harmonics-of-aristoxenus/oclc/123175755 World Cat])&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rameau Traite de l’harmonie.jpg|thumb|right|200px| [[Rameau]]'s ''Traité de l'harmonie'' (''Treatise on Harmony''), 1722]]
It was not until the publication of [[Rameau]]'s ''Traité de l'harmonie'' (''Treatise on Harmony'') in 1722 that any text discussing musical practice made use of the term in the title, although that work is not the earliest record of theoretical discussion of the topic. The underlying principle behind these texts is that harmony sanctions harmoniousness (sounds that please) by conforming to certain pre-established compositional principles.&lt;ref name = "oxfordcompanion"&gt;Arnold Whittall, ''The Oxford Companion to Music'', ed. Alison Latham, (Oxford University Press, 2002) (accessed via [Oxford Reference Online], 16 November 2007  [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?this is gayubview=Main&amp;entry=t114.e3144] )&lt;/ref&gt;

Current dictionary definitions, while attempting to give concise descriptions, often highlight the ambiguity of the term in modern use. Ambiguities tend to arise from either aesthetic considerations (for example the view that only pleasing concords may be harmonious) or from the point of view of musical texture (distinguishing between harmonic (simultaneously sounding pitches) and "contrapuntal" (successively sounding tones).&lt;ref name = "oxfordcompanion" /&gt; In the words of [[Arnold Whittall]]:

{{quote|While the entire history of music theory appears to depend on just such a distinction between harmony and counterpoint, it is no less evident that developments in the nature of musical composition down the centuries have presumed the interdependence—at times amounting to integration, at other times a source of sustained tension—between the vertical and horizontal dimensions of musical space.&lt;ref name = "oxfordcompanion" /&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2018}}}}

The view that modern [[tonality|tonal]] harmony in Western music began in about 1600 is commonplace in music theory. This is usually accounted for by the replacement of horizontal (or [[contrapuntal]]) composition, common in the music of the [[Renaissance]], with a new emphasis on the vertical element of composed music. Modern theorists, however, tend to see this as an unsatisfactory generalisation. According to [[Carl Dahlhaus]]:

{{quote|It was not that counterpoint was supplanted by harmony (Bach’s tonal counterpoint is surely no less polyphonic than Palestrina’s modal writing) but that an older type both of counterpoint and of vertical technique was succeeded by a newer type. And harmony comprises not only the ("vertical") structure of chords but also their ("horizontal") movement. Like music as a whole, harmony is a process.&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|author=Carl Dahlhaus|title=Harmony, §3: Historical development|access-date=16 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see also Whittall 'Harmony: 4. Practice and Principle', ''Oxford Companion to Music''&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2018}}}}

Descriptions and definitions of harmony and harmonic practice may show bias towards [[Europe]]an (or [[Western culture|Western]]) musical traditions.  For example, South Asian art music ([[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani]] and [[Carnatic music]]) is frequently cited as placing little emphasis on what is perceived in western practice as conventional harmony; the underlying harmonic foundation for most South Asian music is the [[drone (music)|drone]], a held open [[fifth interval]] (or fourth interval) that does not alter in pitch throughout the course of a composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=India, §I, 2(ii): Music and musicians: Art music|author=Regula Qureshi|access-date=16 November 2007}} and Catherine Schmidt Jones, 'Listening to Indian Classical Music', Connexions, (accessed 16 November 2007) [http://cnx.org/content/m12502/latest/]&lt;/ref&gt; Pitch simultaneity in particular is rarely a major consideration. Nevertheless, many other considerations of pitch are relevant to the music, its theory and its structure, such as the complex system of [[Rāga]]s, which combines both melodic and modal considerations and codifications within it.&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=India, §III, 2: Theory and practice of classical music: Rāga|author=Harold S. Powers|author2=Richard Widdess|access-date=16 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So, intricate pitch combinations that sound simultaneously do occur in [[Indian classical music]]—but they are rarely studied as [[teleological]] harmonic or [[contrapuntal]] progressions—as with notated Western music. This contrasting emphasis (with regard to Indian music in particular) manifests itself in the different methods of performance adopted: in Indian Music improvisation takes a major role in the structural framework of a piece,&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=India, §III, 3(ii): Theory and practice of classical music: Melodic elaboration|author=Harold S. Powers|author2=Richard Widdess|access-date=16 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in Western Music improvisation has been uncommon since the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Improvisation, §II: Western art music|author=Rob C. Wegman|access-date=16 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where it does occur in Western music (or has in the past), the improvisation either embellishes pre-notated music or draws from musical models previously established in notated compositions, and therefore uses familiar harmonic schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Improvisation, §II, 4(i): The Classical period in Western art music: Instrumental music|author=Robert D Levin|access-date=16 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, emphasis on the precomposed in European art music and the written theory surrounding it shows considerable cultural bias. The ''Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'' (Oxford University Press) identifies this clearly:

{{quote|In Western culture the musics that are most dependent on improvisation, such as jazz, have traditionally been regarded as inferior to art music, in which pre-composition is considered paramount. The conception of musics that live in oral traditions as something composed with the use of improvisatory techniques separates them from the higher-standing works that use notation.&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Improvisation, §I, 2: Concepts and practices: Improvisation in musical cultures|author=Bruno Nettl|access-date=16 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Yet the evolution of harmonic practice and language itself, in Western art music, is and was facilitated by this process of prior composition, which permitted the study and analysis by theorists and composers of individual pre-constructed works in which pitches (and to some extent rhythms) remained unchanged regardless of the nature of the performance.&lt;ref&gt;See Whittall, 'Harmony'&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical rules ==
Some traditions of Western music performance, [[Musical composition|composition]], and [[music theory|theory]] have specific rules of harmony.  These rules are often described as based on natural properties such as [[Pythagorean tuning]]'s law whole number ratios ("harmoniousness" being inherent in the ratios either perceptually or in themselves) or [[harmonic]]s and [[Acoustic resonance|resonances]] ("harmoniousness" being inherent in the quality of sound), with the allowable pitches and harmonies gaining their beauty or simplicity from their closeness to those properties. This model provides that the minor seventh and (major) ninth are not dissonant (i.e., are consonant).{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Early Western religious music often features parallel perfect intervals; these intervals would preserve the clarity of the original [[plainsong]]. These works were created and performed in cathedrals, and made use of the resonant modes of their respective cathedrals to create harmonies. As polyphony developed, however, the use of parallel intervals was slowly replaced by the English style of consonance that used thirds and sixths.{{when|date=September 2014}} The English style was considered to have a sweeter sound, and was better suited to polyphony in that it offered greater linear flexibility in part-writing. Early music also forbade usage of the [[tritone]], due to its dissonance, and composers often went to considerable lengths, via [[musica ficta]], to avoid using it. In the newer triadic harmonic system, however, the tritone became permissible, as the standardization of [[Consonance and dissonance#Dissonance|functional dissonance]] made its use in dominant chords desirable.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Most harmony comes from two or more notes sounding simultaneously—but a work can imply harmony with only one melodic line by using [[arpeggio]]s or [[hocket]]. Many pieces from the [[baroque music|baroque]] period for solo [[string instrument]]s—such as Bach's [[Sonatas and partitas for solo violin]] and cello—convey subtle harmony through inference rather than full chordal structures. These works create a sense of harmonies by using arpeggiated chords and implied bass lines. The implied basslines are created with low notes of short duration that many listeners perceive as being the bass note of a chord.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

[[File:Bach cello harmony.JPG|center|thumb|400px|Example of implied harmonies in [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach's]] [[Cello Suites (Bach)|Cello Suite]] no. 1 in G, BWV 1007, bars 1–2. {{audio|Bach cello harmony.mid|Play}} or {{audio|Bach cello harmony chords.mid|Play harmony}}]]

== Types ==
[[File:C triad.svg|thumb|right|Close position C major triad. {{audio|Major triad on C.mid|Play}}]]
[[File:C triad open position.svg|thumb|right|Open position C major triad. {{audio|C triad open position.mid|Play}}]]

[[Carl Dahlhaus]] (1990) distinguishes between ''coordinate'' and ''subordinate harmony''. ''Subordinate harmony'' is the [[hierarchical]] [[tonality]] or tonal harmony well known today. ''Coordinate harmony'' is the older [[Medieval music|Medieval]] and [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] ''tonalité ancienne'', "The term is meant to signify that sonorities are linked one after the other without giving rise to the impression of a goal-directed development. A first chord forms a 'progression' with a second chord, and a second with a third. But the former chord progression is independent of the later one and vice versa." Coordinate harmony follows direct (adjacent) relationships rather than indirect as in subordinate. [[Interval cycle]]s create symmetrical harmonies, which have been extensively used by the composers [[Alban Berg]], [[George Perle]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]], [[Béla Bartók]], and [[Edgard Varèse]]'s ''[[Density 21.5]]''.

Close harmony and open harmony use close position and open position chords, respectively. See: [[voicing (music)]] and [[close and open harmony]].

Other types of harmony are based upon the intervals of the chords used in that harmony. Most chords in western music are based on "tertian" harmony, or chords built with the interval of thirds. In the chord C Major7, C–E is a major third; E–G is a minor third; and G to B is a major third. Other types of harmony consist of [[quartal and quintal harmony]].

A [[unison]] is considered a harmonic interval, just like a fifth or a third, but is unique in that it is two identical notes produced together. The unison, as a component of harmony, is important, especially in orchestration.&lt;ref name="grovelead" /&gt; In pop music, unison singing is usually called ''doubling'', a technique [[The Beatles]] used in many of their earlier recordings. As a type of harmony, singing in unison or playing the same notes, often using different musical instruments, at the same time is commonly called [[monophony|monophonic]] [[harmonization]].

== Intervals ==
An [[interval (music)|interval]] is the relationship between two separate musical pitches. For example, in the melody ''[[Twinkle Twinkle Little Star]]'', the first two notes (the first "twinkle") and the second two notes (the second "twinkle") are at the interval of one fifth. What this means is that if the first two notes were the pitch '''C''', the second two notes would be the pitch "G"—four scale notes, or seven chromatic notes (a perfect fifth), above it.

The following are common intervals:

|-
| B{{music|b}}
| D
| D{{music|b}}
| F
|-
| B
| D{{music|#}}
| D
| F{{music|#}}
|}

Therefore, the combination of notes with their specific intervals—a chord—creates harmony. For example, in a C chord, there are three notes: C, E, and G. The note '''C''' is the root. The notes '''E''' and '''G''' provide harmony, and in a G7 (G dominant 7th) chord, the root G with each subsequent note (in this case B, D and F) provide the harmony.

&lt;!-- I will leave the following below for the moment, but is it really relevant to this article?? (Please see talk page)--&gt;
In the musical scale, there are twelve pitches. Each pitch is referred to as a "degree" of the scale. The names A, B, C, D, E, F, and G are insignificant. The intervals, however, are not. Here is an example:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! 1°
! 2°
! 3°
! 4°
! 5°
! 6°
! 7°
! 8°
|-
| C

| E

| G
| A
| B
| C
|-
| D
| E
| F{{music|sharp}}
| G
| A
| B
| C{{music|sharp}}
| D
|}

As can be seen, no note always corresponds to a certain degree of the scale. The ''tonic'', or 1st-degree note, can be any of the 12 notes (pitch classes) of the chromatic scale. All the other notes fall into place. For example, when C is the tonic, the fourth degree or subdominant is F. When D is the tonic, the fourth degree is G. While the note names remain constant, they may refer to different scale degrees, implying different intervals with respect to the tonic. The great power of this fact is that any musical work can be played or sung in any key. It is the same piece of music, as long as the intervals are the same—thus transposing the melody into the corresponding key. When the intervals surpass the perfect Octave (12 semitones), these intervals are called ''compound intervals'', which include particularly the 9th, 11th, and 13th Intervals—widely used in [[jazz]] and [[blues]] Music.

Compound Intervals are formed and named as follows:
*2nd + Octave = 9th
*3rd + octave = 10th
*4th + Octave = 11th
*5th + octave = 12th
*6th + Octave = 13th
*7th + octave = 14th

The reason the two numbers don't "add" correctly is that one note is counted twice. Apart from this categorization, intervals can also be divided into consonant and dissonant. As explained in the following paragraphs, consonant intervals produce a sensation of relaxation and dissonant intervals a sensation of tension. In tonal music, the term consonant also means "brings resolution" (to some degree at least, whereas dissonance "requires resolution").

The consonant intervals are considered the perfect [[unison]], [[octave]], [[Perfect fifth|fifth]], [[Perfect fourth|fourth]] and major and minor third and sixth, and their compound forms. An interval is referred to as "perfect" when the harmonic relationship is found in the natural overtone series (namely, the unison 1:1, octave 2:1, fifth 3:2, and fourth 4:3). The other basic intervals (second, third, sixth, and seventh) are called "imperfect" because the harmonic relationships are not found mathematically exact in the overtone series. In classical music the perfect fourth above the bass may be considered dissonant when its function is [[contrapuntal]]. Other intervals, the second and the seventh (and their compound forms) are considered Dissonant and require resolution (of the produced tension) and usually preparation (depending on the music style).

Note that the effect of dissonance is perceived relatively within musical context: for example, a major seventh interval alone (i.e., C up to B) may be perceived as dissonant, but the same interval as part of a major seventh chord may sound relatively consonant. A tritone (the interval of the fourth step to the seventh step of the major scale, i.e., F to B) sounds very dissonant alone, but less so within the context of a dominant seventh chord (G7 or D{{music|b}}7 in that example).

== Chords and tension ==
{{Main article|Chord (music)|Consonance and dissonance}}
In the Western tradition, in music after the seventeenth century, harmony is manipulated using [[chord (music)|chord]]s, which are combinations of [[pitch class]]es. In [[tertian]] harmony, so named after the interval of a third, the members of chords are found and named by stacking intervals of the third, starting with the "root", then the "third" above the root, and the "fifth" above the root (which is a third above the third), etc. (Note that chord members are named after their interval above the root.) [[dyad (music)|Dyad]]s, the simplest chords, contain only two members (see [[power chord]]s).

A chord with three members is called a [[Triad (music)|triad]] because it has three members, not because it is necessarily built in thirds (see [[Quartal and quintal harmony]] for chords built with other intervals). Depending on the size of the intervals being stacked, different qualities of chords are formed. In popular and jazz harmony, chords are named by their root plus various terms and characters indicating their qualities. To keep the nomenclature as simple as possible, some defaults are accepted (not tabulated here). For example, the chord members C, E, and G, form a C Major triad, called by default simply a C chord. In an A{{music|b}} chord (pronounced A-flat), the members are A{{music|b}}, C, and E{{music|b}}.

In many types of music, notably baroque, romantic, modern and jazz, chords are often augmented with "tensions". A tension is an additional chord member that creates a relatively dissonant interval in relation to the bass. Following the tertian practice of building chords by stacking thirds, the simplest first tension is added to a triad by stacking on top of the existing root, third, and fifth, another third above the fifth, giving a new, potentially dissonant member the interval of a seventh away from the root and therefore called the "seventh" of the chord, and producing a four-note chord, called a "[[seventh chord]]".

Depending on the widths of the individual thirds stacked to build the chord, the interval between the root and the seventh of the chord may be major, minor, or diminished. (The interval of an augmented seventh reproduces the root, and is therefore left out of the chordal nomenclature.) The nomenclature allows that, by default, "C7" indicates a chord with a root, third, fifth, and seventh spelled C, E, G, and B{{music|b}}. Other types of seventh chords must be named more explicitly, such as "C Major 7" (spelled C, E, G, B), "C augmented 7" (here the word augmented applies to the fifth, not the seventh, spelled C, E, G{{music|#}}, B{{music|b}}), etc. (For a more complete exposition of nomenclature see [[Chord (music)]].)

Continuing to stack thirds on top of a seventh chord produces extensions, and brings in the "extended tensions" or "upper tensions" (those more than an octave above the root when stacked in thirds), the ninths, elevenths, and thirteenths. This creates the chords named after them. (Note that except for dyads and triads, tertian chord types are named for the interval of the largest size and magnitude in use in the stack, not for the number of chord members : thus a ninth chord has five members ''[tonic, 3rd, 5th, 7th, '''9'''th]'', not nine.) Extensions beyond the thirteenth reproduce existing chord members and are (usually) left out of the nomenclature. Complex harmonies based on [[extended chord]]s are found in abundance in jazz, late-romantic music, modern orchestral works, film music, etc.

Typically, in the classical [[Common practice period]] a dissonant chord (chord with tension) ''resolves'' to a consonant chord. [[Harmonization]] usually sounds pleasant to the ear when there is a balance between the consonant and dissonant sounds. In simple words, that occurs when there is a balance between "tense" and "relaxed" moments. For this reason, usually tension is 'prepared' and then 'resolved',&lt;ref name=Schejtman&gt;Schejtman, Rod (2008). ''The Piano Encyclopedia's "Music Fundamentals eBook"'', p.20-43 (accessed 10 March 2009) [http://PianoEncyclopedia.com PianoEncyclopedia.com]&lt;/ref&gt; where preparing tension means to place a series of consonant chords that lead smoothly to the dissonant chord. In this way the composer ensures introducing tension smoothly, without disturbing the listener.&lt;!--this is a contradiction--&gt; Once the piece reaches its sub-climax, the listener needs a moment of relaxation to clear up the tension, which is obtained by playing a consonant chord that resolves the tension of the previous chords. The clearing of this tension usually sounds pleasant to the listener, though this is not always the case in late-nineteenth century music, such as Tristan und Isolde by Richard Wagner.&lt;ref name="Schejtman"/&gt;

== Perception ==

Harmony is based on consonance, a concept whose definition has changed various times during the history of Western music. In a psychological approach, consonance is a continuous variable. Consonance can vary across a wide range. A chord may sound consonant for various reasons.

One is lack of perceptual roughness. Roughness happens when partials (frequency components) lie within a critical bandwidth, which is a measure of the ear's ability to separate different frequencies. Critical bandwidth lies between 2 and 3 semitones at high frequencies and becomes larger at lower frequencies. The roughness of two simultaneous harmonic complex tones depends on the amplitudes of the harmonics and the interval between the tones. The roughest interval in the chromatic scale is the minor second and its inversion the major seventh. For typical spectral envelopes in the central range, the second roughest interval is the major second and minor seventh, followed by the tritone, the minor third ([[major sixth]]), the major third ([[minor sixth]]) and the perfect fourth (fifth).

[[Image:Major triad.svg|250px|thumb|The harmonious [[Major chord|major triad]] is composed of three tones. Their frequency ratio corresponds approximately 6:5:4. In real performances, however, the third is often larger than 5:4. The ratio 5:4 corresponds to an interval of 386 [[Cent (music)|cents]], but an equally tempered major third is 400 cents and a Pythagorean third with a ratio of 81:64 is 408 cents. Measurements of frequencies in good performances confirm that the size of the major third varies across this range and can even lie outside it without sounding out of tune. Thus, there is no simple connection between frequency ratios and harmonic function.]]

The second reason is perceptual fusion. A chord fuses in perception if its overall spectrum is similar to a [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]]. According to this definition a major triad fuses better than a minor triad and a major-minor seventh chord fuses better than a major-major seventh or minor-minor seventh. These differences may not be readily apparent in tempered contexts but can explain why major triads are generally more prevalent than minor triads and major-minor sevenths generally more prevalent than other sevenths (in spite of the dissonance of the tritone interval) in mainstream tonal music. Of course these comparisons depend on style.

The third reason is familiarity. Chords that have often been heard in musical contexts tend to sound more consonant. This principle explains the gradual historical increase in harmonic complexity of Western music. For example, around 1600 unprepared seventh chords gradually became familiar and were therefore gradually perceived as more consonant.

Western music is based on major and minor triads. The reason why these chords are so central is that they are consonant in terms of both fusion and lack of roughness. They fuse because they include the perfect fourth/fifth interval. They lack roughness because they lack major and minor second intervals. No other combination of three tones in the chromatic scale satisfies these criteria.

== Consonance and dissonance in balance ==
Post-nineteenth century music has evolved in the way that tension may be less often prepared and less formally structured than in [[Baroque Music|Baroque]] or [[Classical Music|Classical]] periods, thus producing new styles such as post-Romantic harmony, [[Impressionist music|impressionism]], pantonality, [[jazz]] and [[blues]], where dissonance may not be prepared in the way seen in "common practice era" harmony. In a jazz or blues song, the tonic chord that opens a tune may be a dominant seventh chord. A jazz song may end on what in Classical music is a quite dissonant chord, such as an [[altered dominant]] chord with a sharpened eleventh note.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7673">'''Hedda Nussbaum''' (born August 8, 1942) is an American woman who was caretaker for a six-year-old girl who died of [[physical abuse]] in 1987. The death of the girl, Lisa Steinberg, sparked a lengthy and controversial trial and media frenzy.  The legal case was one of the first to be televised "[[gavel]] to gavel."&lt;ref&gt;Fergeson, Robert A. 2008. The Trial in American Life. University of Chicago Press, p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters characterized Nussbaum as a victim of horrific [[domestic abuse]] at the hands of her live-in partner, [[Joel Steinberg]]. Critics suggested she was a consensual partner in a [[sado-masochistic]] relationship and an unprosecuted [[conspiracy (criminal)|co-conspirator]] in the young girl's death.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Before meeting [[Joel Steinberg]] in 1975, Nussbaum had been an editor and author of children's books at [[Random House]] publishers, and before that at Appleton Century Crofts. Steinberg was a defense attorney who sometimes handled [[adoption]] cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution-url= http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0306/16/lkl.00.html |contribution= Interview With Hedda Nussbaum |title= [[Larry King Live]] |date= June 16, 2003 |publisher= [[CNN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Beginning in 1976, Nussbaum and Steinberg lived together in a [[brownstone]] apartment in [[New York City]]'s [[Greenwich Village]]. Her 1977 book, ''Plants Do Amazing Things'', was dedicated, in part, "to Joel, my everyday inspiration."&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Hedda. Plants Do Amazing Things.  New York, NY: Random House, Inc, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to Nussbaum's occasionally obvious bruises and other injuries, friends and colleagues suspected that Nussbaum was the victim of [[domestic violence]]. Neighbors later stated to police they believed that Nussbaum and Steinberg were active participants in a "some kind of a sexual sadomasochistic game."&lt;ref&gt;Raoul Lionel Felder, Barbara Victor. Getting Away With Murder: weapons for the war against domestic violence. Simon and Schuster, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; Friends occasionally offered to help if Nussbaum was being abused, but she declined their offers of intervention or aid and refused to implicate Steinberg. After extended absences from work, Random House put Nussbaum on consulting editor status in 1982.

In 1981, under dubious legal circumstances, Nussbaum and Steinberg took custody of an infant girl they named Lisa. The girl's birth mother had paid Steinberg a $500.00 legal fee to place the child with a [[Roman Catholic]] family; both Steinberg and Nussbaum were [[Jewish]].&lt;ref&gt;Skaine, Rosemary. 2003. Paternity and American law. McFarland, {{ISBN|0-7864-1411-1}}, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; Under similar circumstances, Nussbaum and Steinberg later took in a toddler they named Mitchell. Nussbaum and Steinberg never legally adopted either child.

In her 2005 book ''Surviving Intimate Terrorism'', Nussbaum argued that her [[denial]] of the danger she and her children lived in was typical of some chronically maltreated persons (see [[battered person syndrome]]). Nussbaum claimed that she fled from the home six times, only to later return. In her 2005 book, Nussbaum also mentions the medical theory that trauma, especially prolonged trauma, can elicit the body's production of opioids that produce mental and physical numbness. In her 2005 book, Nussbaum also suggests that her "numbness" further reduced her ability to think and act clearly, akin to "[[Stockholm Syndrome]]", a mental state wherein victims identify with their abusers.

===Lisa's death and subsequent trial===
According to initial police reports, on November 1, 1987 around 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., Steinberg rendered Lisa unconscious with a severe blow to the head. Nussbaum remained alone with the dying child for roughly ten hours, failing to notify police or medical personnel. Steinberg departed and returned several times, sometimes [[freebasing]] [[cocaine]]. According to initial police reports, Nussbaum didn't notify authorities because she believed Steinberg had [[supernatural]] healing powers.&lt;ref name="Skaine, p. 87"&gt;Skaine, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; At roughly 6.00 a.m. the next morning, Lisa stopped breathing. Shortly thereafter, Steinberg telephoned [[9-1-1|911]] at Nussbaum's urging.

After Lisa's death, Mitchell was discovered in squalid conditions. The child's birth mother, Nicole Smiegel, had waived her parental rights. However, since a legal adoption had never occurred, Smiegel was ultimately granted custody of her son.

When authorities learned of Lisa's death, they initially charged both Nussbaum and Steinberg with complicity. In the course of the investigation, however, charges were later dropped against Nussbaum. She agreed to testify against Steinberg, and medical examination revealed that Nussbaum was [[anemia|anemic]], [[malnourished]], and suffering from broken bones and chronic infections. With these findings, authorities determined that Nussbaum was physically incapable of seriously wounding Lisa.

Nussbaum's courtroom testimony against Steinberg earned substantial [[mass media|media]] attention, due in part to her face showing obvious evidence of physical trauma. There were also indications, as Nussbaum testified in court, that Lisa had been sexually abused by people outside of her immediate family. During the trial, medical experts testified that while Lisa's injuries were severe, she would have almost certainly survived if given prompt medical treatment.&lt;ref name="Skaine, p. 87"/&gt;

Steinberg was convicted on charges of first-degree [[manslaughter]]. After serving 16 years at the [[Southport Correctional Facility]] in Pine City, New York, where he was held in [[protective custody]], Steinberg was released on parole in 2004 and got a job in construction.

===Later life===
In the years following Lisa's death, Nussbaum worked to rebuild her life and had numerous reconstructive plastic surgeries. She also co-facilitated a support group for battered women for about eight years and later worked as a [[paralegal]] for an organization that assists battered women. In 1995, Nussbaum began giving lectures about abuse at colleges and shelters.  When Steinberg was released from prison, however, she receded from public attention until the publication of her book a year and a half later.

==Analyses==
The Nussbaum case polarized [[feminist]] scholars and activists. Some saw Nussbaum as an [[archetypal]] victim of [[domestic violence]] whose actions were controlled and restricted not only by her abusive partner, but also by the culture at large that denies the seriousness of abuse in the home. Other leading feminists—notably [[Susan Brownmiller]]—suggested that while Nussbaum suffered violence from her partner, she also have shared full culpability for Lisa's death.&lt;ref&gt;Weisberg, D. Kelly. 1996. Applications of feminist legal theory to women's lives: sex, violence, work, and reproduction. Temple University Press, {{ISBN|1-56639-424-4}}, p. 919&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''High Adventure Role Playing''''' ('''''HARP''''') is a [[fantasy]] [[role-playing game]], designed by Tim Dugger &amp; [[Heike A. Kubasch]], and published by [[Iron Crown Enterprises]] ('''ICE''').

== Background ==
'''''HARP''''' is produced by [[Iron Crown Enterprises]], the same company that produces ''[[Rolemaster]]'', but the mechanics of the system are very much simplified in comparison. The system also takes cues from the ''[[d20 system]]''.

== System ==
The ''HARP'' book is 15 chapters long, with the first nine devoted to character generation.

=== Professions ===
''HARP'' has Professions that determine which sets of skills are favoured or not, many also provide level bonuses to skills, spell spheres and/or talents.  The Professions in ''HARP Revised'' are: Cleric, Fighter, Harper, Mage, Monk, Ranger, Rogue, Thief, and Warrior Mage. Additional professions are found in other support books and include: Paladin, Beastmaster, Elementalist, Thaumaturge, Necromancer, Vivimancer, Adventurer, Mystic, Shadowblade, &amp; Druid.  ''HARP'''s Professions are designed to be flexible, with a single level progression chart allowing the player to build the character he or she wants from the base profession.

=== Statistics ===
A system of eight [[statistic (role-playing games)|statistics]] are used for characters featuring Strength, Constitution, Agility, Quickness, Self Discipline, Reasoning, Insight and Presence. Statistics range from 1 to 105.

Statistics are generated during [[character creation]] one of three ways: -

* The first is to roll [[percentile dice|1d100]] eight times (re-rolling any result below 40) and assign the eight results.
* The second is to divide 550 points amongst the eight scores, with an increased cost to raise a score above 90.
* The third is to roll 10d10 and add the total to 500, then assigning that total to the scores as in method two.

Much of the game play revolves around the ability scores, (the Development Points that are used throughout the rest of character creation are based on these scores,) so a character generated with method one runs a risk of not being playable, though the chance of a highly exceptional score is possible.

=== Races and Cultures===
Player characters in ''HARP'' belong to one of a set of [[Race (fantasy)|fantasy races]]: Human, [[dwarf (mythology)|Dwarf]], [[Elf]], [[Gnome]] and [[Halfling]]; ''Harp'' adds the ''Gryx'', a race who are physically similar to [[Orc]]s, with a more peaceful mentality.

''HARP'' does not directly offer mixed races. Instead characters may purchase Greater and Lesser Blood Talents to customize their character.  Greater Blood Talents reflect the more traditional half-race, (meaning that the character is half the Base Race and half the Race chosen with the Blood Talent,) while Lesser Blood Talents represent traits from inter-racial ancestors.

Cultures represent the other side to the [[nature versus nurture]] equation. These traits represent the character's upbringing, from nomadic and rural, to urban and underhill. These directly influence the character's background, starting location, clothing, demeanour and language.  They provide a relatively standard set of cultural skill ranks called adolescent ranks.  These skills are typical skills that most people in a culture will learn in their formative years.

==== Cyradon Races ====

There is also a new campaign setting offered by ICE which is called ''Gryphon World'' and has set its main focus on the continent of ''Cyradon''.  It offers a variation on the standard fantasy races, with the Dwarves becoming the Mablung, the Arali and Sithi replacing the normal elves, the Rhona a wise gnomish race, Nagazi a civilized lizard race, and Gryphons as a flying quadruped race.

Notably it excludes Halflings, orcs, goblins, kobolds and many other standard fantasy races and creatures by default.

===Skills ===
There are 10 skill categories with 3-9 skills each, for a total of 60 skills. Some skills have sub-skills (that are a little more difficult to perform). Each profession receives 20 starting ranks, divided among their favored skill categories, and can build from there with development points.

Skills are used by rolling an open ended d100 (96-100 re-roll and add), adding your skill bonus and the related stat bonus, a modifier for the difficulty of the task, and trying to get over 101. Difficulty modifiers range from Mundane (+60) to Absurd (-100).

Spells are purchased in this stage as well, each spell is purchased as a separate skill.  Several professions have a Professional Sphere of spells, and any character may purchase spells from the Universal Sphere.  Spells are powered by '''[[magic point|Power Points]]''', and in order to be able to cast a spell, a character must have a rank in that spell equal to the power points needed.  Spells  can be scaled upwardly, thereby increasing the required power points and skill ranks needed to cast the scaled version of the spell.

=== Talents ===
Talents are both inherent to the character's race and available as a form of character customization. In order to obtain a talent the character expends DP while creating or levelling up a character. GM's are encouraged to customize the available talents and even require in game explanations should they wish.  Forty-one talents make up the Master List in ''HARP Revised Edition'' (though more are available in support material) and include Dark Vision, Blazing speed, Ambidexterity, Familiar, Athletic, Shapechanger and Outdoorsman.

Special Starting Items such as an Item of Quality or a Loyal Domesticated or Unusual Animal or Creature are also available, and while not talents, they are purchased in the same way.

=== Fate Points ===
Fate Points are a way to aid in dice rolls in critical circumstances or in reducing critical wounds, a single Fate Point is worth +50 on the dice or a -25 to the critical received and can be purchased at a cost of 5 development points to a maximum of 5 Fate Points. All new player characters begin with 3 fate points. These points are a method of allowing the heroic protagonists to achieve the heroic, they are not normally given to non player characters.

=== Training Packages ===
Training packages are sets of linked skills that come at a discount and hail from a common background. Characters may take one package per level. Examples include Bounty Hunter, Astothian Archer, Jade Dragon, and Tyrian Sage.

This allows quick customizations of professions within settings without the need to create a new profession.  For example, in a military order within a campaign several training packages can be created to mimic troop specialization and or rank.  Only one training package can be acquired by a character at each level.

== Awards ==
On August 21, 2004, HARP won the Silver ENnie for Best Non-d20 Game at [[Gen Con]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enworld.org/ennies/2004.html EN World&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pricing ==
''HARP'' is available from the OneBookShelf network &lt;ref&gt;http://www.rpgnow.com/product/104176/High-Adventure-Role-Playing-Fantasy?term=high+adventure+ro&lt;/ref&gt; It retails at $20.00 for an Adobe PDF version.

Paleoanthropologists determined that the skeletal finds belong to an extinct subspecies of ''Homo sapiens'' who lived in [[Pleistocene]] Africa.

==Discovery==
{{Human timeline}}
The [[fossil]]ized remains of ''Homo sapiens idaltu'' were discovered at [[Herto Bouri]] near the [[Middle Awash]] site of [[Ethiopia]]'s [[Afar Triangle]] in 1997 by [[Tim D. White|Tim White]], but were first unveiled in 2003.&lt;ref name="White03"/&gt; Herto Bouri is a region of Ethiopia under volcanic layers. According to [[radioisotope dating]], the layers are between 154,000 and 160,000 years old. Three well preserved crania are accounted for, the best preserved being from an adult male (BOU-VP-16/1) having a brain capacity of {{convert|1450|cm3|cuin|abbr=on}}. The other crania include another partial adult male and a six-year-old child.&lt;ref name="White03"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v423/n6941/full/nature01669.html  |title= Pleistocene Homo sapiens from Middle Awash, Ethiopia | doi=10.1038/nature01669 |accessdate=June 7, 2016 |volume=423 |issue=6941 |pmid=12802332 |date=June 2003 |journal=Nature |pages=742–7 | last1 = White | first1 = TD | last2 = Asfaw | first2 = B | last3 = DeGusta | first3 = D | display-authors = 3 | last4 = et al|bibcode=2003Natur.423..742W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Morphology and taxonomy==
The [[Omo remains|Omo fossils]] differ from those of chronologically later forms of early ''[[Homo sapiens]],'' their [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] has features that show resemblances to African fossils, such as huge and robust skulls, yet have a globular shape of the brain-case and the facial features typical of ''H.&amp;nbsp;sapiens''.&lt;ref name="White03"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/origins/homo_sapiens_idaltu.php  |title= HOMO SAPIENS IDALTU | publisher= Bradshaw foundation |date=  |accessdate=June 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologist [[Chris Stringer]] argued in a 2003 article in the journal ''Nature'' that "the skulls might not be distinctive enough to warrant a new subspecies name".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/index.html?file=/nature/journal/v423/n6941/full/423692a_fs.html  |title= Human evolution: Out of Ethiopia |journal= Nature |volume= 423 |issue= 6941 |pages= 693–695 |date=June 12, 2003  |accessdate=June 7, 2016|bibcode= 2003Natur.423..692S |last1= Stringer |first1= Chris |doi= 10.1038/423692a |pmid= 12802315 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/herto.html  |title= Herto skulls (Homo sapiens idaltu) | publisher= talkorigins org |date=  |accessdate=June 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Herto, Ethiopia ; Homo sapiens idaltu 1997 discovery map.png|thumb|left|300px|Location of discovery]]
These specimens represent the direct ancestors of modern ''[[Homo sapiens sapiens]]'' which, according to the "[[Recent African origin of modern humans|recent African origin (RAO)]]" or "out of Africa" model, developed shortly after this period ([[Khoisan]] mitochondrial divergence dated not later than 110,000 [[Common Era|BCE]]) in [[Eastern Africa]]. "The many morphological features shared by the Herto crania and [[Anatomically modern Homo sapiens|AMHS]], to the exclusion of [[wikt:penecontemporaneous|penecontemporaneous]] [[Neanderthals]], provide additional fossil data excluding Neanderthals from a significant contribution to the ancestry of modern humans."&lt;ref name="White03"/&gt;

A 2005 [[potassium-argon dating]] of volcanic [[tuff]] associated with the Omo remains showed them to date from around 195,000 years ago. At the time of the dating, this made these fossils the earliest known remains of [[anatomically modern humans]], older than the ''idaltu'' specimens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=McDougall |first=I. |last2=Brown |first2=F.

A later study found that Herto man and his contemporaries were cranially similar to Oceanians, with Northern Melenesians being the closest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Reyes-Centeno|first=H. |last2=Hubbe|first2=M |last3=Hanihara|first3=T. |last4=Stringer|first4=C. |last5=Harvati|first5=K. |year=2015|title=Testing modern human out-of-Africa dispersal models and implications for modern human origins |journal=Journal of Human Evolution|volume=87  |pages=95–106 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''"hot hand"''' (also known as the '''"hot hand phenomenon"''' or '''"hot hand fallacy"''') is the purported phenomenon that a person who experiences a successful outcome with a [[Randomness|random]] event has a greater [[probability]] of success in further attempts. The concept is often applied to sports and skill-based tasks in general and originates from [[basketball]], whereas a shooter is allegedly more likely to score if their previous attempts were successful, i.e. while having "hot hands". While previous success at a task can indeed change the [[Psychology|psychological]] attitude and subsequent success rate of a player, researchers for many years did not find evidence for a "hot hand" in practice, dismissing it as [[fallacy|fallacious]]. However, later research questioned whether the belief is indeed a fallacy.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/working-papers/hot-hand-fallacy-cognitive-mistakes-or-equilibrium-adjustments|title=The Hot Hand Fallacy: Cognitive Mistakes or Equilibrium Adjustments?

A Truth in the Law of Small Numbers |journal=IGIER Working Paper| number=552|doi=10.2139/ssrn.2627354}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies using modern statistical analysis show there is evidence for the "hot hand" in some sporting activities.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

== Development of theory ==

=== 1985 "Hot Hand in Basketball" paper ===
The fallacy was first described in a 1985 paper by [[Amos Tversky]], [[Thomas Gilovich]], and Robert Vallone. The "Hot Hand in Basketball" study questioned the theory that basketball players have "hot hands", which the paper defined as the claim that players are more likely to make a successful shot if their previous shot was successful. The study looked at the inability of respondents to properly understand [[randomness]] and random events; much like [[innumeracy]] can impair a person's judgement of statistical information, the hot hand fallacy can lead people to form incorrect assumptions regarding random events. The three researchers provide an example in the study regarding the "coin toss"; respondents expected even short sequences of heads and tails to be approximately 50% heads and 50% tails.&lt;ref name="Gilovich1985"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gilovich|first=Thomas |author2=Tversky, A. |author3=Vallone, R.|title=The Hot Hand in Basketball: On the Misperception of Random Sequences|journal=Cognitive Psychology|year=1985|volume=17|issue=3|pages=295–314|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(85)90010-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study proposed two biases that are created by the kind of thought pattern applied to the coin toss: it could lead an individual to believe that the probability of heads or tails increases after a long sequence of either has occurred (known as the [[gambler's fallacy]]); or it could cause an individual to reject randomness due to a belief that a streak of either outcome is not representative of a random sample.&lt;ref name="Gilovich1985" /&gt;

The first study was conducted via a questionnaire of 100 basketball fans from the colleges of [[Cornell University|Cornell]] and [[Stanford University|Stanford]]. The other looked at the individual records of players from the [[1980–81 Philadelphia 76ers season|1980–81 Philadelphia 76ers]]. The third study analyzed free-throw data and the fourth study was of a controlled shooting experiment. The reason for the different studies was to gradually eliminate external factors around the shot. For example, in the first study there is the factor of how the opposing team's [[Basketball playbook|defensive strategy]] and shot selection would interfere with the shooter. The second and third take out the element of shot selection, and the fourth eliminates the game setting and the distractions and other external factors mentioned before. The studies primarily found that the outcomes of both field goal and free throw attempts are [[independence (probability theory)|independent]] of each other.&lt;ref name="Gilovich1985" /&gt; In the later studies involving the controlled shooting experiment the results were the same; evidently, the researchers concluded that the sense of being "hot" does not predict hits or misses.&lt;ref name="Gilovich1985" /&gt;

=== Proposed explanations ===
Gilovich offers two different explanations for why people believe hot hands exist. The first is that a person may be [[bias]]ed towards looking for streaks before watching a basketball game. This bias would then affect their perceptions and recollection of the game ([[confirmation bias]]). The second explanation deals with people's inability to recognize chance sequences. People expect chance sequences to alternate between the options more than they actually do. Chance sequences can seem too lumpy, and are thus dismissed as non-chance ([[clustering illusion]]).

There are many proposed explanations for why people are susceptible to the hot-hand fallacy. Alan D. Castel, and others investigated the idea that age would alter an individual's belief in the fallacy.&lt;ref name="Castel2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Castel|first=Alan |author2=Drolet Rossi, A. |author3=McGIllivary, S.|title=Beliefs About the "Hot Hand" in Basketball Across the Adult Life Span|journal=Psychology and Agin|volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=601–605 |year=2012|doi=10.1037/a0026991}}&lt;/ref&gt; To test this idea researchers conducted a cross-sectional study where they sampled 455 participants ranging in age from 22 to 90 years old. These participants were given a questionnaire preceded by a prompt that said in college and professional basketball games no players make 100% of their attempted shots.&lt;ref name="Castel2012" /&gt; Then the questionnaire asked two important questions: (1) Does a basketball player have a better chance of making a shot after having just made the last two or three shots than after having missed the last two or three shots? (2) Is it important to pass the ball to someone who has just made several shots in a row?&lt;ref name="Castel2012" /&gt;

The main interest of the questionnaire was to see if a participant answered yes to the first question, implying that they believed in the hot-hand fallacy. The results showed that participants over 70 years of age were twice as likely to believe the fallacy than adults 40–49,&lt;ref name="Castel2012" /&gt; confirming that the older individuals relied more on heuristic-based processes. Older adults are more likely to remember positive information, making them more sensitive to gains and less to losses than younger adults.&lt;ref name="Castel2012" /&gt;

One study looked at the root of the hot-hand fallacy as being from an inability to appropriately judge sequences. The study compiled research from dozens of behavioral and cognitive studies that examined the hot-hand and gambler's fallacies with random mechanisms and skill-generated streaks. In terms of judging random sequences the general conclusion was that people do not have a statistically correct concept of random.&lt;ref name="whats next"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oskarsson|first=Van Boven|title=What's Next? Judging Sequences of Binary Events|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=2009|volume=135|issue=2|pages=262–285|doi=10.1037/a0014821|pmid=19254080}}&lt;/ref&gt; It concluded that human beings are built to see patterns in sensory and conceptual data of all types.&lt;ref name="whats next" /&gt;

=== Follow up studies ===
A 2003 study by Koehler, J. J. &amp; Conley C. A. was conducted to examine the hot hand in professional basketball. In this study the researchers examined film from the NBA shooting contests from 1994–1997. Through studying the film of the contests the researchers hoped to find evidence of sequential dependency within each shooter across all shots. They also searched for sequential dependencies within each shooter per set of 25 continuous shots, and employed a variety of novel techniques for isolating hot performance.&lt;ref name="refmyth"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koehler|first=Jonathan|year=2003|title=The "Hot Hand" Myth in Professional Basketball|journal=Journal of Sport Psychology|volume=2|issue=25|pages=253–259}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the hot hand a player should have very few runs and instead their hits and misses should be in clusters.

In their research there were only two players who had a significantly lower number of runs than expected by chance. No shooter had significantly more runs than would be expected by chance. About half of the shooters (12 of 23 = 52%) had fewer runs than expected, and about half (11 of 23 = 48%) had more runs than expected.&lt;ref name="refmyth" /&gt; The researchers also compared the shooters hits and misses. The data were more in accordance with chance than the hot hand. Through their analysis of the data the conclusion was drawn that there was nothing that supported the hot hand [[hypothesis]].

A study reported that a belief in the hot-hand fallacy affects a player's [[perception]]s of success.&lt;ref name="ref2"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Raab, M., Gula, B., &amp; Gigerenzer, G. (2011) | journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied | volume=18 | pages=81–94 | doi=10.1037/a0025951| year=2012 | last1=Raab | first1=Markus | last2=Gula | first2=Bartosz | last3=Gigerenzer | first3=Gerd }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent research in support of hot hand ==
More recent research has questioned the earlier findings, instead finding support for the belief of a hot hand phenomenon.

A 2003 paper from researchers at [[Monash University]] noted that Gilovich et al. did not examine the [[statistical power]] of their own experiments. By performing power analysis on the 1985 data, the researchers concluded that even if the Philadelphia 76ers did shoot in streaks, it is highly unlikely that Gilovich, Vallone and Tversky would have discovered that fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~korb/iccs.pdf |title=The Story of The Hot Hand: Powerful Myth or Powerless Critique? |first=Kevin B. |last=Korb |first2=Michael |last2=Stillwell |year=2003 |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927050854/http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~korb/iccs.pdf |archivedate=2013-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A paper from October 2011 by Yaari and Eisenmann, a large dataset of more than 300,000 NBA free throws were found to show "strong evidence" for the "hot hand" phenomenon at the individual level. They analyzed all free throws taken during five regular NBA seasons from 2005 to 2010. They found that there was a significant increase in players' probabilities of hitting the second shot in a two-shot series compared to the first one. They also found that in a set of two consecutive shots, the probability of hitting the second shot is greater following a hit than following a miss on the previous one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0024532| pmid = 21998630| title = The Hot (Invisible?) Hand: Can Time Sequence Patterns of Success/Failure in Sports Be Modeled as Repeated Random Independent Trials?| journal = PLoS ONE| volume = 6| issue = 10| pages = e24532| year = 2011| last1 = Yaari | first1 = G. | last2 = Eisenmann | first2 = S. | bibcode = 2011PLoSO...624532Y | pmc=3187751}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, researchers at Stanford University used data from [[Major League Baseball]] and found that there was "strong evidence" that the hot hand existed in ten different statistical categories.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

In 2014, a paper from three Harvard graduates presented at the Sloan Sports Analytics Conference, which used advanced statistics that for the first time could control for variables in basketball games such as the player's shot location and a defender's position, showed a "small yet significant hot-hand effect."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304071004579409071015745370|title=Does the 'Hot Hand' Exist in Basketball?|last=Cohen|first=Ben|date=2014-02-27|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, an examination of the 1985 study by Joshua Miller and Adam Sanjurjo found flaws in the methodology of the 1985 study and showed that, in fact, the hot hands may exist. The researchers said that instead it may be attributable to a misapplication of statistical techniques.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The authors concluded that people were right to believe that the hot hand exists in basketball.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

== Hot hand in non-sport contexts ==

=== Consumers ===
There are places other than sport that can be affected by the hot-hand fallacy. A study conducted by Joseph Johnson et al. examined the characteristics of an individual's buying and selling behavior as it pertained to the hot hand and gambler's heuristic. Both of these occur when a consumer misunderstands random events in the market and is influenced by a belief that a small sample is able to represent the underlying process.&lt;ref name="Johnson2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Joseph|author2=Tellis, G.J. |author3=Macinnis, D.J. |title=Losers, Winners, and Biased Trades|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|year=2005|volume=2|issue=32|pages=324–329|doi=10.1086/432241}}&lt;/ref&gt; To examine the effect of the hot hand and gambler's heuristic on the buying and selling behaviors of consumers, three hypotheses were made. Hypothesis one stated that consumers that were given stocks with positive and negative trends in earning would be more likely to buy a stock that was positive when it was first getting started but would become less likely to do so as the trend lengthened. Hypothesis two was that consumers would be more likely to sell a stock with negative earnings as the trend length initially increased but would decrease as the trend length increased more. Finally, the third hypothesis was that consumers in the buy condition would be more likely to choose a winning stock over those in the selling condition.&lt;ref name="Johnson2005" /&gt;

The results of the experiment did not support the first hypothesis but did support hypotheses two and three, suggesting that the use of these heuristics is dependent on buying or selling and the length of the sequence.&lt;ref name="Johnson2005" /&gt; This means that those who had the shorter length and the buying condition would fall under the influence of the hot-hand fallacy. The opposite would be in accordance with the [[gambler's fallacy]] which has more of an influence on longer sequences of numerical information.

=== Gambling ===
A study was conducted to examine the difference between the hot-hand and [[gambler's fallacy]]. The gambler's fallacy is the expectation of a reversal following a run of one outcome.&lt;ref name="sympathetic magic"&gt;{{cite journal | title= Roney, C. R., Trick, L. M. (2009)| journal= Sympathetic magic and perceptions of randomness: the hot hand versus the gambler's fallacy | volume= 15 | issue= 2 | pages= 197–210 |doi=10.1080/13546780902847137| year= 2009 | last1= Roney | first1= Christopher J. R. | last2= Trick | first2= Lana M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gambler's fallacy occurs mostly in cases in which people feel that an event is random, such as rolling a pair of dice on a [[craps]] table or spinning the [[roulette]] wheel. It is caused by the false belief that the random numbers of a small sample will balance out the way they do in large samples; this is known as the law of small numbers heuristic. The difference between this and the hot-hand fallacy is that with the hot-hand fallacy an individual expects a run to continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Raab|first=Markus|author2=Gula, B. |author3=Gigerenzer, G. |title=The Hot hand Exists in Volleyball and Is Used for Allocation Decisions|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied|year=2011|volume=18|issue=1|pages=81–94|doi=10.1037/a0025951}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a much larger aspect of the hot hand that relies on the individual. This relates to a person's perceived ability to predict random events, which is not possible for truly random events. The fact that people believe that they have this ability is in line with the [[illusion of control]].&lt;ref name="sympathetic magic" /&gt;

In this study, the researchers wanted to test if they could manipulate a [[Coin flipping|coin toss]], and counter the gambler's fallacy by having the participant focus on the person tossing the coin. In contrast, they attempted to initiate the hot-hand fallacy by centering the participant's focus on the person tossing the coin as a reason for the streak of either heads or tails. In either case the data should fall in line with [[sympathetic magic]], whereby they feel that they can control the outcomes of random events in ways that defy the [[Physical law|laws of physics]], such as being "hot" at tossing a specific randomly determined outcome.&lt;ref name="sympathetic magic" /&gt;

They tested this concept under three different conditions. The first was person focused, where the person who tossed the coin mentioned that ''she'' was tossing a lot of heads or tails. Second was a coin focus, where the person who tossed the coin mentioned that ''the coin'' was coming up with a lot of heads or tails. Finally there was a control condition in which there was nothing said by the person tossing the coin.&lt;ref name="sympathetic magic" /&gt; The participants were also assigned to different groups, one in which the person flipping the coin changed and the other where the person remained the same.

The researchers found the results of this study to match their initial hypothesis that the gambler's fallacy could in fact be countered by the use of the hot hand and people's attention to the person who was actively flipping the coin. It is important to note that this counteraction of the gambler's fallacy only happened if the person tossing the coin remained the same.&lt;ref name="sympathetic magic" /&gt; This study shed light on the idea that the gambler's and hot hand fallacies at times fight for dominance when people try to make predictions about the ''same'' event.&lt;ref name="sympathetic magic" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3446">The '''Inter-African Committee on Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and Children''' (IAC) is a [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO) which seeks to change social values and raise consciousness towards eliminating [[female genital mutilation]] (FGM) and other traditional practices which affect the health of women and children in [[Africa]].&lt;ref name=Welch&gt;{{cite book | title=Protecting Human Rights in Africa: Strategies and Roles of Nongovernmental Organizations | author=Welch, Claude E | year=1995 | publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press | series=Pennsylvania Studies in Human Rights | editor=Bert B.

== History ==

The IAC began at a seminar in [[Dakar]] in 1984 with a focus on fighting harmful practices relating to [[female genital mutilation]] (FGM), [[childbirth]], [[nutrition]] and food, [[child marriage|early marriage]]; and promoting traditional practices considered beneficial, such as [[breastfeeding]] and [[infant massage|baby massage]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Comfort Momoh|Momoh, Comfort]]. ''Female Genital Mutilation''. Radcliffe Publishing, 2005, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Fighting FGM is the main focus of their work.&lt;ref name=Packer&gt;{{cite book | title=Using Human Rights to Change Tradition: Traditional Practices Harmful to Women's Reproductive Health in sub-Saharan Africa | author=Packer, Corinne A.

It has a liaison office in [[Geneva]] and 15 affiliates in Europe, Canada, Japan, New Zealand and USA.

In 1990, the IAC adopted the term "female genital mutilation" to describe the procedure previously referred to as "female circumcision".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editor=Alexia Lewnes |year=2005 |title=Changing a Harmful Social Convention: Female Genital Cutting/Mutilation |booktitle=Innocenti Digest |pages=1–2 |isbn=88-89129-24-7 |url=http://www.unicef-icdc.org/publications/pdf/fgm-gb-2005.pdf |accessdate=2007-12-24 |publisher=[[UNICEF]] |location=Florence, Italy |author=[aed.: Alexia Lewnes ; trad.: Mariette Mosette Barraud]. |oclc=123550797 |format=&amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=intitle%3AChanging+a+Harmful+Social+Convention%3A+Female+Genital+Cutting%2FMutilation&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=2005&amp;as_yhi=2005&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212114352/http://www.unicef-icdc.org/publications/pdf/fgm-gb-2005.pdf |archivedate=December 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 1995 publication, the main focus of their strategy for eliminating FGM is through education.&lt;ref name=Welch/&gt;

== Contributions ==

The IAC considers that legislative change related to FGM in [[Burkina Faso]], [[Côte d'Ivoire]], [[Djibouti]], [[Egypt]], [[Ghana]], [[Guinea]], [[Senegal]], [[Tanzania]] and [[Togo]] is a result of the lobbying work carried out by the IAC as well as by other NGOs.&lt;ref name=Packer /&gt;

'''Jeremiah Daniel Baltimore''' (April 15, 1852 &amp;ndash; July 29, 1929) was an engineer and educator in Washington, DC. For many years, he was an engineer in the service of the [[United States Navy]] and served as chief engineer at the [[Freedmen's Hospital]]. He was also a teacher of mechanics, and was responsible for mechanical instruction in the African American schools in the city from 1890 to 1922. He was on the trial board of the Naval [[battleship]] [[USS Texas (1892)]] and was among the organizers and officers of the Potomac Hospital and Training School. In 1903 he was elected a member of the [[Franklin Institute]] of [[Philadelphia]]. In 1915 he was made member of the [[Royal Society of Arts|Royal Society for the Encouragement of Art, Manufactures, and Commerce]] of [[London]].

== Early life and education ==
[[File:Ulysses S. Grant 1870-1880.jpg|thumb|[[Ulysses S. Grant]] was a mentor to Baltimore.]]
Jeremiah Daniel Baltimore was born in Washington DC on April 15, 1852 to Thomas and Hannah Baltimore. While Thomas was a [[Catholic]], Jeremiah followed his mother and became a Methodist, being baptized at the Wesley Zion Church in 1866. He attended [[Enoch Ambush]]'s school and then Washington, D.C. public schools. As a boy he liked to experiment with steam and told his mother that he wished to be an engineer. His mother said that this was impossible as she and her father would not be able to get him through school. His experiments continued and he made a [[steam boiler]] and attached it to an engine, but this failed. In spite of this, the pastor at his church, Reverend [[William P. Ryder]] placed it in an exhibition at the Wesley Zion Sunday School and then it was put on exhibition in the [[United States Treasury Department]] where officers and employers were impressed. This encouraged Baltimore to keep trying. Baltimore then used bricks and flower pots to hold molten metal, using a kitchen stove to melt brass, and using a file, old shears and an old knife for cutting, created a [[steam engine]] of the horizontal high pressure style with a tubular boiler. The engine was brought to the [[United States Patent Office|patent office]] with the aid of [[Anthony Bowen]], a Washington D.C. City Councilman. The device was widely discussed in the press,&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"/&gt; appearing the ''Iron Age'' of London&lt;ref name="Crisis1924"&gt;The Horizon, The Crisis, February 1924, page 181&lt;/ref&gt; and locally in the ''Sunday Chronicle''. The boy then went to the [[White House]] and sent a copy of the article to the desk of President [[Ulysses S. Grant]], who then invited Baltimore to his office. Grant gave Baltimore a card to deliver to the [[Secretary of the Navy]] to ask that Baltimore be given work in the Navy Yard to learn and work on the machinery.&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"&gt;Simmons, William J., and Henry McNeal Turner. Men of Mark: Eminent, Progressive and Rising. GM Rewell &amp; Company, 1887. p267&amp;ndash;272&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early engineering career ==
[[File:Washington_Navy_Yard_3b06890u.tif|thumb|View of [[Washington Navy Yard]]'s dock, circa 1867]]
Baltimore was then given a position as apprentice in the department of steam engineering at the [[Washington Navy Yard]]. Baltimore faced a lot of prejudice on account of his color, and after a few months complained. Professor [[John M. Langston]] brought the complaints to the Secretary of the Navy who allowed Baltimore to transfer to the [[Philadelphia Navy Yard]]. He again was discriminated against, but endeavored to study on his own early in the mornings and after work. His study paid off and he was admitted to the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia. He was the second black person to be admitted at the institute. His apprenticeship continued and every sign of growth and learning was countered with further examples of prejudice and intimidation. In spite of this, he finished his apprenticeship about September 6, 1873, working for three years and six months.&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"/&gt;

He then was assigned to the Philadelphia Naval Station on [[League Island]] to assist repairs on [[Monitor (warship)|Monitors]]. He was released from the job when force sizes reduced. He then worked at a large mill, and next at a manufacturing firm, [[Sellers &amp; Brother]] after being refused from [[William Cramp &amp; Sons|Cramp &amp; Sons]] and multiple previous applications at Sellers &amp; Brother. He resigned for health reasons and moved back to Washington, DC.&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"/&gt;

In Washington he became engineer of the [[United States Coast Survey]] and opened a general repair shop. On August 2, 1880, he was appointed chief engineer and mechanician at the Freedmen's Hospital.&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"/&gt; He attended [[Howard University]] Medical College in 1880-1881 and received an A.M. (a master's degree) in 1883 from [[Livingstone College]].&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, Daniel Smith. A Historical, Biographical and Statistical Souvenir. Beresford, 1900. p234&lt;/ref&gt; He was frequently noted for inventing a [[pyrometer]] device, for which he received a patent. As an engineer, he was a member of the Mechanics Union and played a key role in merging black and white unions in 1887.&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"/&gt;

== Public life ==
Baltimore was active in Republican politics. In 1876 he was secretary of the 17th District Republicans and was a delegate to the [[1876 Republican National Convention]] in Cincinnati.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6711893/seventeenth_district_national/|title=Seventeenth District. National Republican (Washington, DC) June 7, 1876, page 4 - Newspapers.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1880, he was made chairman of the group and was again delegate at the [[1880 Republican National Convention|National convention in Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6711939/the_chicago_convention_evening_star/|title=The Chicago Convention, Evening Star (Washington, DC), February 6, 1880, page 4 - Newspapers.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Armstrong_Manual_Training_School.jpg|thumb|The [[Armstrong Manual Training School]] opened in 1902.]]
He was recommended as a trustee for public schools in 1883&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6722279/a_south_washington_delegation_evening/|title=A South Washington Delegation, Evening Star (Washington, DC), June 28, 1883, page 5 - Newspapers.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6722288/want_a_trustee_from_south_washington/|title=Want a Trustee from South Washington, Evening Star (Washington, DC), August 16, 1889, page 8 - Newspapers.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890 he was appointed to take charge of machine instruction in the colored public schools in Washington, a position he held until 1922.&lt;ref name="Crisis1924"/&gt; His position included the responsibility of teaching at the [[Armstrong Manual Training School]]. He was highly respected as a professor, adopting the methods of the [[Bureau of Steam Engineering|United States Bureau of Steam Engineering]]. One of his techniques was that he constructed an engine made of glass to help the students see the workings of the engine and the effect of heat on water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6721762/a_leader_of_his_race_the_times/|title=A Leader of his Race, The Times (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) July 28, 1892, page 4 - Newspapers.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1895 he was selected by the Navy to serve as assistant engineer officer on the trial board of the battleship, USS Texas.&lt;ref name="Crisis1924"/&gt; In 1906, Baltimore was among the organizers of the [[Potomac Hospital and Training School]] and was its treasurer. The organizers included Reverend W. J. Howard, Dr. A. R. Collins, and Dr. Harry J. Williams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6721891/site_for_new_hospital_the_washington/|title=Site for New Hospital, The Washington Post (Washington, DC) April 5, 1906, page 4 - Newspapers.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Honors and affiliations ==

Baltimore was very active in DC Society. In 1875, he was elected recording secretary of the Colored Sabbath School Union of Washington, DC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6711731/sunday_schools_national_republican/|title=Sunday Schools, National Republican (Washington, DC) July 7, 1875, page 4 - Newspapers.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Baltimore's belief in scientific reason occasionally put him at odds with the religious community, as in 1876 when he took part in a debate with Dr. J. L. N. Bowen wherein Baltimore argued that geological evidence showed that the first verses of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] did not definitely fix the age of the world at about 6,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6711811/science_and_religion_national/|title=Science and Religion.

[[File:AtwaterKentMuseum_Phila.jpg|thumb|Baltimore studied at the [[Franklin Institute]] as a young man and was elected a member in 1903.]]
Beyond his activities, he was highly honored while still alive. In 1903 he was elected a member of the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia. In 1915 he was made member of the Royal Society for the Encouragement of Art, Manufactures, and Commerce of London.&lt;ref name="Crisis1924"/&gt;

The '''Jews Relief Act 1858''', also called the Jewish Disabilities Bill, is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] which removed previous barriers to Jews entering Parliament.&lt;ref name=enacted&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/21-22/49/contents/enacted "Jews Relief Act 1858"], as originally enacted&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829]] there had been an unsuccessful attempt in 1830 to also allow Jews to sit in Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1830/may/17/bill-for-removal-of-jewish-disabilities#S2V0024P0_18300517_HOC_59 "BILL FOR REMOVAL OF JEWISH DISABILITIES. "], HC Deb 17 May 1830 vol 24 cc784-814&lt;/ref&gt; The 1858 measure was the result of a long process which began with a bill introduced by the Whig leader [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]]  following the election of [[Lionel de Rothschild]] to the [[City of London (UK Parliament constituency)|City of London constituency]] in 1847. Rothschild could not take the seat without taking the Christian oath. The bill was supported by the future Conservative Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]] but not by his party.

In 1848, the bill was approved by the House of Commons but was twice rejected by the [[House of Lords]] as was a new bill in 1851. In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1852|1852 general election]], Rothschild was again elected but the next year the bill was again defeated in the upper house. Finally, in 1858, the House of Lords agreed to a proposal to allow each house to decide its own oath.

The bill allowed "any Person professing the Jewish Religion, [to] omit the Words 'and I make this Declaration upon the true Faith of a Christian{{'"}} in their oaths, but explicitly did not extend to allowing Jews to various high offices, and also stated that "it shall not be lawful for any Person professing the Jewish Religion, directly or indirectly, to advise Her Majesty ... touching or concerning ... any office or preferment in the Church of England or in the Church of Scotland."&lt;ref name=enacted /&gt;

'''Meanness''' is a personal quality whose classical form, discussed by many from [[Aristotle]] to [[Thomas Aquinas]], characterizes it as a [[vice]] of "lowness", but whose modern form deals more with [[cruelty]].

== Classical formulation ==
In his dictionary, [[Noah Webster]] defined meanness as "want of excellence", "want of rank", "low estate", "lowness of mind", and "sordidness, niggardliness, opposed to liberality or charitableness" pointing out that "meanness is very different from frugality".{{sfn|Webster|1832}}  These, in particular the final one, largely summarize the aspects of the classical definition of meanness that have been propounded by philosophers, Aristotelian and otherwise, over the centuries.

=== Aristotle ===
In his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', where each virtue is considered as a midway point on a continuum bracketed by two vices, Aristotle places meanness as one of the two vices that bracket the virtue of liberality/generosity.{{sfn|Curzer|2012|p=83}}  It is the deficiency of giving to or the excess of taking from others.{{sfn|Curzer|2012|p=86,88}}{{sfn|Holgate|1999|p=231}}  The other vice is prodigality (excess of giving to or deficiency of taking from), which Aristotle describes as both less common than meanness and less of a vice.{{sfn|Curzer|2012|p=234,102}}

Meanness can take many forms, as there are several ways in which one can deviate from the liberal/generous virtue.  It can be a desire for wealth with insufficient desire to benefit others; or a desire to benefit others suppressed by an excessive desire to keep what money one has; or the desire for too much wealth.  Aristotle said that "meanness we always impute to those who care more than they ought for wealth" and "there seem to be many kinds of meanness".{{sfn|Holgate|1999|p=231}}{{sfn|Curzer|2012|p=99&amp;ndash;100}}

The translation of what Aristotle meant is not without problems.  Aristotle's actual word ''ἐλευθερία'' ([[eleutheria]]) corresponds with both liberality and freedom.  Its opposite, ''ανἐλευθερία'', is both meanness and servility.{{sfn|Curzer|2012|p=94}}  Philosophers such as Susanne E. Foster (in {{harvnb|Foster|1997}}) have attempted to reconcile these by explaining that the connotation is that meanness is enslavement by one's material possessions.  A slave has no possessions to give and is not the recipient of gifts from others; whereas a free person, in a gift-exchanging culture, can give and take freely.  Meanness, therefore, is the vice of a free person behaving, in such a culture, as a slave does.{{sfn|Curzer|2012|p=94}}

Another problem that has taxed philosophers analysing Aristotle is that the expected continuum (on which vices and a virtue lie) is from excess to deficiency; but Aristotle describes meanness as ''both'' excess (of taking from) ''and'' deficiency (of giving to).  Philosophers have attempted to explain this, and characterize what Aristotle was trying to say as an excess or a deficiency in some other form.{{sfn|Curzer|2012|p=101}}  Howard J. Curzer takes the view that in fact both were meant, and that it is "misguided" to ask whether Aristotelian meanness is excess or deficiency, because what constitutes excess and what constitutes deficiency "depends upon how the parameters are described" and is "purely a verbal matter".  Exactly which vice of the two that brackets a virtue is "excess" and which is "deficiency" is entirely arbitrary.{{sfn|Curzer|2012|p=101}}

Curzer also contends that Aristotle's statement that meanness is worse than prodigality is "a mistake", based upon an erroneous choice of exemplars of prodigality.  There are, in Curzer's contention "true prodigals", who are not merely young and foolish (as Aristotle would have prodigals be, and arguing thereby that youth and foolishness are curable &amp;mdash; the former by simple dint of growing old &amp;mdash; whereas meanness is not{{sfn|Holgate|1999|p=231}}) but "incurably wicked" and thus more proper exemplars of the vice, who demonstrate that it is just as much of a vice as meanness is.{{sfn|Curzer|2012|p=101}}

=== Aquinas ===
In his ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' {{harv|Aquinas|loc=question 135}}, [[Thomas Aquinas]] explicitly cited Aristotle (as "The Philosopher") and held meanness &amp;mdash; ''parvificentia'' in his original Latin &amp;mdash; to be the opposite of magnificence (''magnificentia'').{{sfn|Davies|2014|p=271}}  Whilst a magnificent person is willing to pay for great projects and good causes, a mean person focuses upon penny-pinching and settles for small goals at the expense of great ones.{{sfn|Davies|2014|p=271}}

=== Others ===
[[Theodore Parker]], like Aristotle, opposed meanness and generosity, declaring meanness as an "unmanly and unwomanly vice".  He differentiated two forms of meanness: ''pecuniary meanness'', which is meanness in things measurable with money, and ''meanness of behaviour'', which is meanness in things not thus measurable.{{sfn|Parker|1872|p=114}}

[[George Crabb (writer)|George Crabb]] described meanness as "[w]hatever a man does in common with those below him" and that "evinces a temper that is prone to sink rather than rise in the scale of society".  He considered meanness to be only relatively bad, as what may constitute meanness for one person may be generosity or prudence for another.  Seeking to save or to gain for oneself at the expense of others, in particular with respect to what one can afford to pay, "is denominated a mean temper".{{sfn|Crabb|Hedley|1839|p=392}}

[[Henry Sidgwick]] in ''The Methods of Ethics'' held meanness to be both the opposite of liberality and generosity.{{sfn|Crisp|2015|p=183}} A mean person "chooses a trifling gain to himself rather than the avoidance of disappointment to others", and meanness is not injustice per se.{{sfn|Crisp|2015|p=183}}

== Modern view as cruelty ==
[[Samuel Johnson]] wrote in ''The False Alarm'' that "[a]n infallible characteristic of meanness is cruelty".{{sfn|Johnson|1770|p=49}} [[Linda Trinkaus Zagzebski|Linda Zagzebski]] stated that meanness is "an acquired defect" that is "opposed to kindness".{{sfn|Zagzebski|2015|p=256}}  These signifiy the modern view of meanness, which has concentrated upon cruelty, bullying, and remorselessness.

In the [[Psychopathy#Triarchic model|Triarchic Psychopathy Measure]], one of the several ways of defining what psychopathy is, meanness is one of the three components, an index of a person's "callous aggression".{{sfn|Patrick|2014|p=201}}  It is characterized as callous unemotionality, antagonism, coldheartedness, exploitativeness, remorselessness, and empowerment through cruelty; encompassing destructive acts, the inability to bond with other people, bullying, fight-picking, and other forms of active engagement against other people (in contrast to social withdrawal, which is a passive moving away from other people).{{sfn|Drislane|Patrick|2014|p=695}}{{sfn|Drislane|Venables|Patrick|2014|pp=110&amp;ndash;111}}

=== "Mean girls" ===

Many of these aspects of meanness &amp;mdash; namely empowerment, bullying, aggression, cruelty, and ruthlessness &amp;mdash; have been incorporated in the late 20th and early 21st century popular cultural concept of the "mean girl".{{sfn|Ringrose|Walkerdine|2008|p=9&amp;ndash;10}}  Social science professor Valerie Walkerdine argues that "meanness is becoming a dominant motif for Western girlhood", as it fits well with the normative, repressive, boundaries of what is appropriate to modern femininity in work and school, and supports the narrative that empowered, successful, females cannot treat empowerment and success positively, but rather always risk slipping into cruelty.{{sfn|Ringrose|Walkerdine|2008|p=10}}  With sociology professor Jessica Ringrose she contends that the "mean girl" stereotype from popular culture, as supported by what they criticise as "highly suspect" research in [[developmental psychology]], is being increasingly taken up by policy makers in education.{{sfn|Ringrose|Walkerdine|2008|p=10}}  And that in turn, with things like the Hollywood movie ''[[Mean Girls]]'' being partly based upon the [[self-help]] book ''[[Queen Bees and Wannabes]]'' by [[Rosalind Wiseman]], feeds from psychology and pedagogy back into popular culture.{{sfn|Ringrose|Walkerdine|2008|p=11}}

'''NABERS''', the '''National Australian Built Environment Rating System''', is an initiative by the government of Australia to measure and compare the [[Environmentally friendly|environmental performance]] of [[Global warming in Australia|Australian]] buildings and tenancies. There are NABERS rating tools for [http://www.nabers.gov.au/public/WebPages/ContentStandard.aspx?module=21&amp;template=2&amp;id=210&amp;include=Dashboard.htm commercial office buildings] to measure [[Greenhouse gas|greenhouse gas emissions]], [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], [[water efficiency]], [[Waste|waste efficiency]] and [[Building science|indoor environment quality]]. There are also energy/greenhouse and water rating tools for [http://www.nabers.gov.au/public/WebPages/ContentStandard.aspx?module=22&amp;template=2&amp;id=211&amp;include=Dashboard.htm hotels], [http://www.nabers.gov.au/public/WebPages/ContentStandard.aspx?module=23&amp;template=2&amp;id=212&amp;include=Dashboard.htm shopping centres] and [http://www.nabers.gov.au/public/WebPages/ContentStandard.aspx?module=27&amp;template=2&amp;id=216&amp;include=Dashboard.htm data centres].

== Accredited Assessors ==
A key feature of the initiative is the use of independent 'Accredited Assessors' to conduct ratings. Assessors are required to attend training, pass an exam and complete two supervised assessments before they receive full accreditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is an Accredited Assessor?|url = http://www.nabers.gov.au/public/WebPages/ContentStandard.aspx?module=30&amp;template=3&amp;include=AccreditAssessor.htm&amp;side=AssessorTertiary.htm|website = www.nabers.gov.au|accessdate = 2016-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there are no formal pre-requisites to attend the training, most Assessors have experience in the building services, property or energy management industries. Building owners and tenants can use the online 'self-assessment' tool, however they cannot promote these results. Only ratings that have been certified by the NABERS National Administrator can be promoted using the NABERS [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/trademark trademark].

== Calculating a rating ==
The vision statement of NABERS is 'To support a more [[sustainable]] [[built environment]] through a relevant, reliable and practical measure of [[building performance]]'.

=== Offices ===
The NABERS tools attempt to provide an [[Accuracy and precision|accurate]] [[measurement]] of how [[Efficiency|efficiently]] building owners and tenants are providing their services ''without penalising them for factors that are beyond their control''. 

For example if the primary service that an [[Office|office building]] owner provides is [[Safety|safe]], [[Light|lit]] and [[comfortable]] office space the NABERS Energy for offices tool would consider how much space is being used, how much energy is being used to supply services to the space, and then statistically adjusts for factors like the climate - which will influence [[Energy conservation|how much energy is used for heating and cooling]].

==== Energy====
To obtain a NABERS Energy for offices rating, consumption data for the building (such as electricity and gas bills) is collected by Accredited Assessors along with data about a number of other aspects of the building such as its size, hours of occupation, climate location and density of occupation. Data requirements are set out in a document called [http://www.nabers.gov.au/public/WebPages/DocumentHandler.ashx?docType=2&amp;id=44&amp;attId=0 'The NABERS Energy and Water for Offices Rules for Collecting and Using Data v.3.0']. This data is then input into the NABERS rating calculator&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Rating calculator – NABERS|url = http://www.nabers.gov.au/public/WebPages/RatingCalculator.aspx?module=40|website = www.nabers.gov.au|accessdate = 2016-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; which statistically adjusts for these factors so that the building can have its consumption fairly [[Benchmarking|benchmarked]] against its peers. The result of this calculation is a star rating on a six star scale, where zero is very poor performance and six is market leading.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nabers.gov.au/public/WebPages/DocumentHandler.ashx?docType=2&amp;id=44&amp;attId=0|title = NABERS Energy and Water for offices - Rules for collecting and using data|date = February 2013|accessdate = 2016-01-09|website = www.nabers.gov.au|publisher = NABERS|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Water ====
The procedure for an office water rating is similar to conducting an office energy rating. The main differences are that it is water rather than energy bills that are used, and some data such as the hours of operation are not required. Unlike office energy ratings, which can either be for the base building, tenancies or whole building, office water ratings are only available for whole buildings.

=== Data centres ===

==== Energy ====
Like NABERS for offices, NABERS Energy for [[Data center|data centres]] has three distinct rating types to reflect the different interests and responsibilities from data centres owners, operators and tenants - Infrastructure (co-location owner), Whole Facility (data centre owner) and IT Equipment (data centre tenant) ratings. The tool is designed to rate the majority of data centres in Australia, provide a direct comparison with other rateable data centres, and allow an individual data centre to measure and compare performance over time.

The NABERS Data Centre IT Equipment Rating is designed for organisations that control and manage their own [[IT]] equipment ([[Server (computing)|servers]], [[Computer Storage|storage]] and [[networking devices]]). The IT Equipment rating measures feastures that are closely related to the primary functions of a data centre ([[Computer performance|processing]], [[Computer data storage|storage]] and [[Computer network|networking]]) and that all data centres provide, regardless of how they provide them. NABERS uses two IT equipment metrics:
* [[Processing power|Processing capacity]]: number of server cores × clock speed in gigahertz (GHz) and
* [[Computer data storage|Storage capacity]] (total unformatted storage capacity in [[terabytes]]).
The NABERS performance benchmark model predicts the industry median [[greenhouse gas]] emissions for a given amount of data centre processing and storage capacity. This means that if a data centre consumes more energy than the benchmark model predicts, the site is less energy efficient than the industry median (set at 3 stars), while if it consumes less energy it is more efficient than the median. 
To obtain a NABERS Energy for data centres IT Equipment rating, [[Energy in Australia|energy consumption]] data for the IT equipment over a 28- to 40-day period is collected by Accredited Assessors along with data about the total unformatted storage capacity and total processing capacity as above.

The Infrastructure Rating measures the [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] in delivering support services to the IT equipment, using the widely accepted industry [[Power usage effectiveness|Power Usage Effectiveness]] (PUE) ratio that is converted into kilogram of emissions with some modification for climate and shared cooling services. To obtain an infrastructure rating, 12 months of energy consumption data for IT equipment and infrastructure services is collected by Accredited Assessors along with the climate location of the data centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nabers.gov.au/public/WebPages/DocumentHandler.ashx?docType=3&amp;id=85&amp;attId=0|title = NABERS Energy for data centres - Rules for collecting and using data|date = |accessdate = 2016-01-09|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Whole Facility rating measures the energy efficiency of the whole data centre by assessing the processing and storage capacity and the industry median energy efficiency for infrastructure services compared with the overall energy consumption of the data centre. It is a combination of both the IT Equipment and Infrastructure rating benchmarks To obtain a NABERS Energy for data centres Whole Facility rating, 12 months of energy consumption data for the data centre is collected by Accredited Assessors along with the processing and storage capacity and climate location of the data centre.

==Comparison to other building rating systems==
There are a number of building environmental certification systems across the world, such as [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]], [[Green Star (Australia)|Green Star]], [[BREEAM|BRE Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM)]] and [[Display Energy Certificate|Display Energy Certificates (DECs)]]. The key features of NABERS as a system are that it is based on performance rather than design, assessments are carried out by third party 'Accredited Assessors', it is based on third party verifiable data (such as utility bills), ratings undergo government quality assurance checks and it distinguishes between the environmental impact of a building's shared services and its tenancies. While other rating systems across the world share some of these features, none share all of them.

== Program Success ==
NABERS Energy for offices is considered by many to have been successful, as over 82% of the Australian national office market has now been rated with either a base building or whole building rating. Factors behind the success of the tool are largely attributed to its ability to differentiate between the base building and tenants energy end uses and strong government support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.buildingrating.org/graphic/australias-nabers-energy-rating-label|title = Australia's NABERS Energy Rating Label|date = 2014-05-01|accessdate = 2016-01-09|website = Building Rating|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Far fewer tenancy energy ratings have been conducted however and there has also been far less uptake of the other tools.

== Use in Australian Energy Programs &amp; Policy ==
While NABERS Energy is a voluntary rating scheme for buildings, its success has been at least partly driven by its extensive use in energy initiatives by government and industry throughout Australia.  Some programs include:

* '''[http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/resources/government/140567NSWGREP.pdf The NSW Government Resource Efficiency Policy (GREP)]:''' The most recent iteration of a series of NSW government procurement policies that set out NABERS targets in government leasing criteria. In the GREP, government tenants require a building to have a 4.5 star NABERS rating. It also states a 4.5 star energy rating as a minimum criteria for government data centres. Similar policies are in place other states and territories, as well as the Australian government (the 'Energy Efficiency in Government Operations' policy).

In [[logic]], '''negation''', also called the '''logical complement''', is an [[operation (mathematics)|operation]] that takes a [[proposition]] &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; to another proposition "not &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;", written &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt; (¬P), which is interpreted intuitively as being true when &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is false, and false when &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is true. Negation is thus a unary (single-argument) [[logical connective]]. It may be applied as an operation on [[notion (philosophy)|notions]], [[proposition]]s, [[truth value]]s, or [[interpretation (logic)|semantic values]] more generally. In [[classical logic]], negation is normally identified with the [[truth function]] that takes ''truth'' to ''falsity'' and vice versa. In [[intuitionistic logic]], according to the [[Brouwer–Heyting–Kolmogorov interpretation]], the negation of a proposition &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the proposition whose proofs are the refutations of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.

==Definition==
No agreement exists as to the possibility of defining negation, as to its logical status, function, and meaning, as to its field of applicability..., and as to the interpretation of the negative judgment, (F.H. Heinemann 1944).&lt;ref name=Horn&gt;{{cite book |last=Horn |first=Laurence R |year=2001 |title=A NATURAL HISTORY OF NEGATION |url=http://emilkirkegaard.dk/en/wp-content/uploads/A-natural-history-of-negation-Laurence-R.-Horn.pdf |location=Stanford University |chapter=Chapter 1 |page=1 |publisher=CLSI Publications |isbn=1-57586-336-7  |accessdate=29 Dec 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Classical negation'' is an  [[logical operation|operation]] on one [[logical value]], typically the value of a [[proposition]], that produces a value of ''true'' when its operand is false and a value of ''false'' when its operand is true.  So, if statement &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is true, then &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt; (pronounced "not P") would therefore be false; and conversely, if &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt; is false, then &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; would be true.

The [[truth table]] of &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt; is as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center; background-color: #ddffdd;"
|- bgcolor="#ddeeff"
| &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt; \neg P &lt;/math&gt;
|-
| True || False
|-
| False || True
|}

Negation can be defined in terms of other logical operations.  For example, &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt; can be defined as &lt;math&gt;P \rightarrow \bot&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; is [[logical consequence]] and &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt; is [[False_(logic)|absolute falsehood]]). Conversely, one can define &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;Q \land \neg Q&lt;/math&gt; for any proposition &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt; is [[logical conjunction]]). The idea here is that any [[contradiction]] is false.  While these ideas work in both classical and intuitionistic logic, they do not work in [[paraconsistent logic]], where contradictions are not necessarily false. In classical logic, we also get a further identity, &lt;math&gt;P \rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt; can be defined as &lt;math&gt;\neg P \lor Q&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\lor&lt;/math&gt; is [[logical disjunction]].

Algebraically, classical negation corresponds to [[Complement (order theory)|complementation]] in a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]], and intuitionistic negation to pseudocomplementation in a [[Heyting algebra]]. These algebras provide a [[algebraic semantics (mathematical logic)|semantics]] for classical and intuitionistic logic respectively.

==Notation==
The negation of a proposition &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is notated in different ways in various contexts of discussion and fields of application. Among these variants are the following:

{| class="wikitable"
|- style="background:paleturquoise"
! style="text-align:center" | Notation
! Plain Text
! Vocalization
|-
| style="text-align:center" | &lt;math&gt;\neg p&lt;/math&gt;
| ¬p
| Not ''p''
|-
| style="text-align:center" | &lt;math&gt;\mathord{\sim} p&lt;/math&gt;
| ~p
| Not ''p''
|-
| style="text-align:center" | &lt;math&gt;-p&lt;/math&gt;
| -p
| Not ''p''
|-
| style="text-align:center" | N''p''
|
| En ''p''
|-
| style="text-align:center" | &lt;math&gt;p'&lt;/math&gt;
| p'
| {{unbulleted list
 | ''p'' prime,
 | ''p'' complement
 }}
|-
| style="text-align:center" | &lt;math&gt;\overline{p}&lt;/math&gt;
| ̅p
| {{unbulleted list
 | ''p'' bar,
 | Bar ''p''
 }}
|-
| style="text-align:center" | &lt;math&gt;!p&lt;/math&gt;
| !p
| {{unbulleted list
 | Bang ''p''
 | Not ''p''
 }}
|-
|}

The notation N''p'' is [[Polish_notation#Polish_notation_for_logic|Łukasiewicz notation]].

In [[Set theory#Basic concepts and notation|set theory]] &lt;math&gt;\setminus&lt;/math&gt; is also used to indicate 'not member of': &lt;math&gt;U \setminus A&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all members of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; that are not members of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

No matter how it is notated or [[List of logic symbols|symbolized]], the negation &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt; can be read as "it is not the case that &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;", "not that &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;", or usually more simply as "not &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;".

==Properties==

===Double negation===

Within a system of [[classical logic]], double negation, that is, the negation of the negation of a proposition &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, is [[logically equivalent]] to &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.  Expressed in symbolic terms, &lt;math&gt;\neg \neg P \equiv P&lt;/math&gt;. In [[intuitionistic logic]], a proposition implies its double negation but not conversely. This marks one important difference between classical and intuitionistic negation. Algebraically, classical negation is called an [[involution (mathematics)|involution]] of period two.

However, in [[intuitionistic logic]] we do have the equivalence of &lt;math&gt;\neg \neg \neg P \equiv \neg P&lt;/math&gt;. Moreover, in the propositional case, a sentence is classically provable if its double negation is intuitionistically provable. This result is known as [[Double-negation translation|Glivenko's theorem]].

===Distributivity===

[[De Morgan's laws]] provide a way of [[Distributive property|distributing]] negation over [[logical disjunction|disjunction]] and [[logical conjunction|conjunction]] :

:&lt;math&gt;\neg(P \lor Q) \equiv (\neg P \land \neg Q)&lt;/math&gt;,&amp;nbsp; and
:&lt;math&gt;\neg(P \land Q) \equiv (\neg P \lor \neg Q)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Linearity===
Let &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; denote the logical [[Exclusive or|xor]] operation. In [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]], a linear function is one such that:

If there exists &lt;math&gt;a_0, a_1, \dots, a_n \in \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;f(b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n) = a_0 \oplus (a_1 \land b_1) \oplus \dots \oplus (a_n \land b_n)&lt;/math&gt;,
for all &lt;math&gt;b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n \in \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;.

Another way to express this is that each variable always makes a difference in the [[truth-value]] of the operation or it never makes a difference. Negation is a linear logical operator.

===Self dual===
In [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]] a self dual function is one such that:

&lt;math&gt;f(a_1, \dots, a_n) = \neg f(\neg a_1, \dots, \neg a_n)&lt;/math&gt; for all
&lt;math&gt;a_1, \dots, a_n \in \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;.
Negation is a self dual logical operator.

==Rules of inference==
There are a number of equivalent ways to formulate rules for negation. One usual way to formulate classical negation in a [[natural deduction]] setting is to take as primitive rules of inference ''negation introduction'' (from a derivation of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; to both &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\neg Q&lt;/math&gt;, infer &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt;; this rule also being called ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]''), ''negation elimination'' (from &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt; infer &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;; this rule also being called ''ex falso quodlibet''), and ''double negation elimination'' (from &lt;math&gt;\neg \neg P&lt;/math&gt; infer &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;). One obtains the rules for intuitionistic negation the same way but by excluding double negation elimination.

Negation introduction states that if an absurdity can be drawn as conclusion from &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; must not be the case (i.e. &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is false (classically) or refutable (intuitionistically) or etc.). Negation elimination states that anything follows from an absurdity. Sometimes negation elimination is formulated using a primitive absurdity sign &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt;. In this case the rule says that from &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt; follows an absurdity. Together with double negation elimination one may infer our originally formulated rule, namely that anything follows from an absurdity.

Typically the intuitionistic negation &lt;math&gt;\neg P&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;P \rightarrow \bot&lt;/math&gt;. Then negation introduction and elimination are just special cases of implication introduction ([[conditional proof]]) and elimination ([[modus ponens]]). In this case one must also add as a primitive rule ''ex falso quodlibet''.

==Programming==
As in mathematics, negation is used in [[computer science]] to construct logical statements.
&lt;source lang="cpp"&gt;
    if (!(r == t))
    {
         /*...statements executed when r does NOT equal t...*/
    }
&lt;/source&gt;
The "&lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt;" signifies logical NOT in [[B (programming language)|B]], [[C Programming Language|C]], and languages with a C-inspired syntax such as [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[JavaScript]], [[Perl]], and [[PHP]]. "&lt;code&gt;NOT&lt;/code&gt;" is the operator used in [[ALGOL 60]], [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]], and languages with an ALGOL- or BASIC-inspired syntax such as [[Pascal programming language|Pascal]], [[Ada programming language|Ada]], [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]] and [[Seed7]]. Some languages (C++, Perl, etc.) provide more than one operator for negation. A few languages like [[PL/I]] and [[Ratfor]] use &lt;code&gt;¬&lt;/code&gt; for negation. Some modern computers and [[operating systems]] will display &lt;code&gt;¬&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt; on files encoded in [[ASCII]]. Most modern languages allow the above statement to be shortened from &lt;code&gt;if (!(r == t))&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;if (r != t)&lt;/code&gt;, which allows sometimes, when the compiler/interpreter is not able to optimize it, faster programs.

In computer science there is also ''bitwise negation''. This takes the value given and switches all the [[binary numeral system|binary]] 1s to 0s and 0s to 1s.  See [[bitwise operation]].  This is often used to create [[signed number representations|ones' complement]] or "&lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;" in C or C++ and [[two's complement]] (just simplified to "&lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;" or the negative sign since this is equivalent to taking the arithmetic negative value of the number) as it basically creates the opposite (negative value equivalent) or mathematical complement of the value (where both values are added together they create a whole).

To get the absolute (positive equivalent) value of a given integer the following would work as the "&lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;" changes it from negative to positive (it is negative because "&lt;code&gt;x &lt; 0&lt;/code&gt;" yields true)

&lt;source lang="cpp"&gt;
    unsigned int abs(int x)
    {
        if (x &lt; 0)
            return -x;
        else
            return x;
    }
&lt;/source&gt;

To demonstrate logical negation:

&lt;source lang="cpp"&gt;
    unsigned int abs(int x)
    {
        if (!(x &lt; 0))
            return x;
        else
            return -x;
    }
&lt;/source&gt;

Inverting the condition and reversing the outcomes produces code that is logically equivalent to the original code, i.e. will have identical results for any input (note that depending on the compiler used, the actual instructions performed by the computer may differ).

This convention occasionally surfaces in written speech, as computer-related [[slang]] for ''not''.  The phrase &lt;code&gt;!voting&lt;/code&gt;, for example, means "not voting".

==Kripke semantics==
In [[Kripke semantics]] where the semantic values of formulae are sets of [[possible world]]s, negation can be taken to mean [[set-theoretic complement]]ation.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} (See also [[possible world semantics]].)

"'''No taxation without representation'''" is a [[slogan]] originating during the 1700s that summarized a primary grievance of the [[Colonial history of the United States#British colonies|American colonists]] in the [[Thirteen Colonies]], which was one of the major causes of the [[American Revolution]]. In short, [[Patriot (Revolution)|many in those colonies]] believed that, as they were not directly [[Representation (politics)|represented]] in the distant [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]], any laws it passed affecting the colonists (such as the [[Sugar Act]] and the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]]) were illegal under the [[Bill of Rights 1689]], and were a denial of their [[Rights of Englishmen|rights as Englishmen]].

[[Jonathan Mayhew]], [[Old West Church (Boston, Massachusetts)|Old West Church's]] second Congregational pastor, used the phrase, "no taxation without representation" in a sermon in 1750.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chris Beneke |year=2008 |title=The Critical Turn: Jonathan Mayhew, the British Empire, and the Idea of Resistance in Mid- Eighteenth-Century Boston |journal=Massachusetts Historical Review |volume=10|jstor=25478696 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase revives a sentiment central to the cause of the [[English Civil War]] following the refusal of parliamentarian [[John Hampden]] to pay [[ship money]] tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The English Civil War|page=97

The English Parliament had controlled colonial trade and taxed imports and exports since 1660.&lt;ref&gt;Unger, pg. 87&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 1760s, the Americans were being deprived of a historic right.&lt;ref&gt;John C. Miller, ''Origins of the American Revolution''. 1943. pp. 31, 99, 104&lt;/ref&gt;  The English [[Bill of Rights 1689]] had forbidden the imposition of taxes without the consent of Parliament.  Since the colonists had no representation in Parliament, the taxes violated the guaranteed [[Rights of Englishmen]].  Parliament initially contended that the colonists had [[virtual representation]], but the idea "found little support on either side of the Atlantic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OBvNHl6UYKsC&amp;pg=PA126|title=Recreating the American Republic|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Dunmore Lang]] wrote in 1852, "The person who first suggested the idea [of Parliamentary representation for the colonies] appears to have been Oldmixon, an American annalist of the era of Queen Anne or George I.

[[William Knox (British politician)|William Knox]], an aide of George Grenville, pamphleteer and subsequent Irish [[Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies]], received an appointment in 1756 to the American provinces, and after his return to London in 1761, he recommended the creation of a colonial aristocracy and colonial representation in the British Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libraryireland.com/biography/WilliamKnox.php William Knox]. Libraryireland.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-15.&lt;/ref&gt; He was shortly afterwards appointed agent for Georgia and East Florida, a post which he forfeited by writing in favour of the Stamp Act. In his Grenville-backed pamphlet of 1769, ''The Controversy between Great Britain and her Colonies Reviewed'', Knox suggested that colonial representatives might have been offered seats in the British Parliament if they had sought such representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/williamknoxoname00knox#page/18/mode/2up/search/offer |title=William Knox on American taxation, 1769 |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Knox submitted that, &lt;blockquote&gt;whilst [the radical colonists] exclaim against Parliament for taxing them when they are not represented, they candidly declare they will not have representatives [in Parliament] lest they should be taxed...The truth...is that they are determined to get rid of the jurisdiction of Parliament...and they therefore refuse to send members to that assembly lest they should preclude themselves of [the] plea [that Parliament's] legislative acts...are done without their consent; which, it must be confessed, holds equally good against all laws, as against taxes...The colony advocates...tell us, that by refusing to accept our offer of representatives they...mean to avoid giving Parliament a pretence for taxing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/williamknoxoname00knox#page/18/mode/2up/search/representatives |title=William Knox on American taxation, 1769 |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Edmund Burke responded to Knox, who had drawn up ''The Controversy between Great Britain and her Colonies Reviewed'' as well as ''The Present State of the Nation'' (1768) under the supervision of George Grenville, by opining in his political tract ''Observations on a Late State of the Nation'' (1769), &lt;blockquote&gt;NOW comes [Knox's] American representation...Is not the reader a little astonished at the proposal of an American representation from that quarter [of Grenville's]? It is proposed merely as a project of speculative improvement; not from the necessity in the case, not to add any thing to the authority of parliament: but that we may afford a greater attention to the concerns of the Americans, and give them a better opportunity of stating their grievances, and of obtaining redress. I am glad to find the author has at length discovered that we have not given a sufficient attention to their concerns, or a proper redress to their grievances. His great friend [Grenville] would once have been exceedingly displeased with any person, who should tell him, that he did not attend sufficiently to those concerns. He thought he did so, when he regulated the colonies over and over again: he thought he did so, when he formed two general systems of revenue; one of port-duties, and the other of internal taxation. These systems supposed, or ought to suppose, the greatest attention to, and the most detailed information of, all their affairs. However, by contending for the American representation, he seems at last driven virtually to admit, that great caution ought to be used in the exercise of all our legislative rights over an object so remote from our eye, and so little connected with our immediate feelings; that in prudence we ought not to be quite so ready with our taxes, until we can secure the desired representation in parliament. Perhaps it may be some time before this hopeful scheme can be brought to perfect maturity; although the author seems to be no wise aware of any obstructions that lie in the way of it.&lt;ref name="quod.lib.umich.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/ecco/004899151.0001.000?rgn=main;view=fulltext;q1=american+representatives |title=The political tracts and speeches: of Edmund Burke, Esq.

While Knox, Grenville and Burke were not necessarily opposed in principle to direct colonial representation in Parliament, Grenville nonetheless conjectured that Parliament retained a constitutional right to virtually represent the colonial subjects.&lt;ref name="quod.lib.umich.edu" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Page 69 – {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6K8pM6Z3BdAC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=grenville+knox+virtual+representation#v=onepage&amp;q=grenville%20knox%20virtual%20representation&amp;f=false|title=The Constitutional Origins of the American Revolution|isbn=978-1-139-49293-5|author1=Greene|first1=Jack P|date=2010-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''On the American Taxation'' ====
Burke supported the doctrine of virtual representation in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Page 58 – {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xH2lEKIZ4yMC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;dq=burke+virtual+representation+philip+reid#v=onepage&amp;q=burke%20virtual%20representation%20philip%20reid&amp;f=false|title=The Concept of Representation in the Age of the American Revolution|isbn=978-0-226-70898-0|author1=Reid|first1=John Phillip|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet in his Parliamentary speech of 1774, entitled ''On American Taxation'', Burke responded to the suggestion that America was virtually represented in Parliament by remarking, &lt;blockquote&gt;What! does the electric force of virtual representation more easily pass over the Atlantic than pervade Wales, which lies in your neighborhood? or than Chester and Durham, surrounded by abundance of representation that is actual and palpable? But, Sir, your ancestors thought this sort of virtual representation, however ample, to be totally insufficient for the freedom of the inhabitants of territories that are so near, and comparatively so inconsiderable. How, then, can I think it sufficient for those which are infinitely greater, and infinitely more remote?  You will now, Sir, perhaps imagine that I am on the point of proposing to you a scheme for a representation of the colonies in Parliament. Perhaps I might be inclined to entertain some such thought; but a great flood stops me in my course. Opposuit Natura. I cannot remove the eternal barriers of the creation. The thing, in that mode, I do not know to be possible. As I meddle with no theory, I do not absolutely assert the impracticability of such a representation; but I do not see my way to it; and those who have been more confident have not been more successful...My resolutions, therefore, mean to establish the equity and justice of a taxation of America by grant, and not by imposition; to mark the legal competency of the colony assemblies for the support of their government in peace, and for public aids in time of war; to acknowledge that this legal competency has had a dutiful and beneficial exercise, and that experience has shown the benefit of their grants, and the futility of Parliamentary taxation, as a method of supply.&lt;ref name="gutenberg.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/15198/15198-h/15198-h.htm#AMERICAN_TAXATION |title=The Project Gutenberg eBook of Burke's Writings and Speeches, Volume the Second, by Edmund Burke |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Burke apparently qualified such remarks concerning America by stating in the same speech that, &lt;blockquote&gt;The Parliament of Great Britain...is never to intrude into the place of the [provincial legislatures], whilst they are equal to the common ends of their institution. But in order to enable [Parliamentary]...superintendence, her powers must be boundless. The gentlemen who think the powers of Parliament limited may please themselves to talk of requisitions. But suppose the requisitions are not obeyed? What! shall there be no reserved power in the empire, to supply a deficiency which may weaken, divide, and dissipate the whole? We are engaged in waar,—the Secretary of State calls upon the colonies to contribute,—some would do it, I think most would cheerfully furnish whatever is demanded,—one or two, suppose, hang back, and, easing themselves, let the stress of the draft lie on the others,—surely it is proper that some authority might legally say, "Tax yourselves for the common Supply, or Parliament will do it for you." This backwardness was, as I am told, actually the case of Pennsylvania for some short time towards the beginning of the last war, owing to some internal dissensions in that colony. But whether the fact were so or otherwise, the case is equally to be provided for by a competent sovereign power. But then this ought to be no ordinary power, nor ever used in the first instance. This is what I meant, when I have said, at various times, that I consider the power of taxing in Parliament as an instrument of empire, and not as a means of supply.&lt;ref name="gutenberg.org" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The views of Knox, Grenville and Burke did not go unchallenged: William Pitt was amongst those who disputed that a Parliamentary right or power existed to levy "internal" taxes "for the purposes of raising a revenue" without the consent of actual representatives of the "Commons of America".&lt;ref name="bartleby.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/268/3/23.html |title=II.

==== Colonial spokespersons ====
In 1764, the Massachusetts politician James Otis, Jr., said that, {{quote|When the parliament shall think fit to allow the colonists a representation in the house of commons, the equity of their taxing the colonies, will be as clear as their power is at present of doing it without, if they please...But if it was thought hard that charter privileges should be taken away by act of parliament, is it not much harder to be in part, or in whole, disfranchised of rights, that have been always thought inherent to a British subject, namely, to be free from all taxes, but what he consents to in person, or by his representative? This right, if it could be traced no higher than Magna Charta, is part of the common law, part of a British subjects birthright, and as inherent and perpetual, as the duty of allegiance; both which have been brought to these colonies, and have been hitherto held sacred and inviolable, and I hope and trust ever will. It is humbly conceived, that the British colonists (except only the conquered, if any) are, by Magna Charta, as well entitled to have a voice in their taxes, as the subjects within the realm. Are we not as really deprived of that right, by the parliament assessing us before we are represented in the house of commons, as if the King should do it by his prerogative? Can it be said with any colour of truth or justice, that we are represented in parliament?|sign=James Otis|source=''Rights of British Colonies Asserted''&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.libertyfund.org/files/2335/Otis_RightsBritishColonies1556.pdf The rights of the British Colonies 1556]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Otis, Jr., attended the Continental Congress of 1765 along with other colonial delegates.  The resolutions of the Congress stated that the Stamp Act had "a manifest tendency to subvert the rights and liberties of the colonists" and that "the only Representatives of the People of these Colonies, are Persons chosen therein by themselves, and that no Taxes ever have been, or can be Constitutionally imposed on them, but by their respective Legislature."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1068&amp;Itemid=264 |title=Online Library of Liberty |publisher=Oll.libertyfund.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="avalon.law.yale.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/resolu65.asp |title=Avalon Project – Resolutions of the Continental Congress October 19, 1765 |publisher=Avalon.law.yale.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, it was declared that, "it is unreasonable and inconsistent with the Principles and Spirit of the British Constitution, for the People of Great-Britain, to grant to his Majesty the Property of the Colonists."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="avalon.law.yale.edu" /&gt;

Daniel Dulany, Jr., of Maryland, wrote in 1765 that, "the Impropriety of a Taxation by the British Parliament...[is proven by] the Fact, that not one inhabitant in any Colony is, or can be actually or virtually represented by the British House of Commons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xGsBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA14&amp;lpg=PA14&amp;dq=daniel+dulany+impropriety#v=onepage&amp;q=daniel%20dulany%20impropriety&amp;f=false|title=Considerations on the propriety of imposing taxes in the British colonies, for the purpose of raising a revenue, by act of parliament [by D.

In 1766, Benjamin Franklin told the House of Commons that, "an internal tax is forced from the people without their consent if not laid by their own representatives. The Stamp Act says we shall have no commerce, make no exchange of property with each other, neither purchase nor grant, nor recover debts; we shall neither marry nor make our wills, unless we pay such and such sums; and thus it is intended to extort our money from us or ruin us by the consequence of refusing to pay it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/268/8/10.html |title=I.

==== Republicanism ====
For those sympathetic to [[republicanism]], such as [[James Burgh]], [[Catharine Macaulay|Catherine Macauley]], and [[Richard Price]], any tax revenue measures that were voted into effect without the direct representation of Americans were "unconstitutional" and "pernicious".&lt;ref&gt;Page 42 – {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QsgBM3DSDskC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=unconstitutional+virtual+representation+adams#v=onepage&amp;q=unconstitutional%20virtual%20representation%20adams&amp;f=false|title=British Friends of the American Revolution|isbn=978-0-7656-3143-5|author1=Reich|first1=Jerome R|date=1997-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google3"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QsgBM3DSDskC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=british+friends+of+the+american+revolution+taxation+without+representation#v=onepage&amp;q=british%20friends%20of%20the%20american%20revolution%20taxation%20without%20representation&amp;f=false |title=British Friends of the American Revolution – Jerome R.

==== Heightening of tensions ====
The Americans rejected the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act of 1765]] brought in by [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[George Grenville]], and violently rejected the remaining tax on [[tea]] [[import]]s, under the [[Tea Act]] passed in May 1773, at the [[Boston Tea Party]] on December 16, 1773. The Parliament considered this an illegal act because they believed it undermined the authority of the [[Crown-in-Parliament]]. When the British then used the military to enforce laws that the colonists believed Parliament had passed illegally, the colonists responded by forming [[militia]]s and seized political control of each colony, ousting the [[Colonial government in the Thirteen Colonies|royal governor]]s – with the exception of the American-born Royal Governor of Connecticut, John Trumbull, who was allowed to remain as the new Patriot Governor.

The complaint was never officially over the amount of taxation (the taxes were quite low, though [[ubiquitous]]), but always on the political decision-making process by which taxes were decided in [[London]], i.e. without representation for the colonists in [[British Parliament]].

[[Patrick Henry]]'s resolution in the [[Virginia General Assembly|Virginia legislature]] implied that Americans possessed all the rights of Englishmen, that the principle of no taxation without representation was an essential part of the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British Constitution]], and that [[Virginia]] alone had the right to tax Virginians.&lt;ref&gt;Miller p 122–25&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Efforts at conciliation ====
{{Main article|Diplomacy in the American Revolutionary War}}

This offer of actual imperial representation was likewise re-stated to the delegates of the colonies via the colonial agents in 1774, according to Connecticut-born Reverend Thomas Bradbury Chandler, in his publication ''A Friendly Address to All Reasonable Americans''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZaVbAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=snippet&amp;q=house&amp;f=false|title=A Friendly Address to All Reasonable Americans, on the Subject of Our ...|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1775, Britain passed the [[Conciliatory Resolution]] which ended taxation for any colony which satisfactorily provided for the imperial defence and the upkeep of imperial officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historycentral.com/documents/North.html |title=Lord North's Conciliatory Resolution [February 27, 1775&amp;#93; |publisher=Historycentral.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Had they, like the County and City of Chester, represented, that "for lack of Knights and Burgesses to represent them in the High Court of Parliament, they had been oftentimes TOUCHED and GRIEVED with Acts and Statutes made within the said Court, derogatory to their most ancient jurisdictions, liberties and privileges, and prejudicial to their quietness, rest and peace;" this Country [of Britain] would, I am persuaded, have no objection to their being represented in her Parliament... If they are not madly bent on independence, let them propose the conditions on which they wish to continue as subjects...The Legislature of this Kingdom cannot possibly depart from any part of its supremacy over the Colonies; but it is in the power of the Colonies to share in that supremacy. If they complain of being taxed without having the privilege of sending Members to Parliament, let them be represented. Nay, more: Let their representation increase in proportion to the Revenue they shall furnish. If they wish rather to vote their QUOTA towards the general supply, through their own General Courts and Assemblies, the resolution of Parliament on that subject is still open to their choice. But, as long as they assume the language of a Sovereign State, this Kingdom can enter into no negociation [sic], can meet no compromise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/ecco/004772194.0001.000/1:2?firstpubl1=1700;firstpubl2=1800;rgn=div1;sort=occur;subview=detail;type=simple;view=fulltext;q1=american+representatives |title=The rights of Great Britain asserted against the claims of America: being an answer to the declaration of the General Congress |publisher=Quod.lib.umich.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/rightsofgreatbri00macp |title=The rights of Great Britain asserted against the claims of America: being an answer to the Declaration of the general Congress : Macpherson, James, 1736–1796 : Free Download &amp; Streaming : Internet Archive |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The noted economist Adam Smith seconded this view in his famous 1776 publication ''Wealth of Nations'' when he recommended the Americans "to send fifty or sixty new representatives to Parliament" on the basis of the amount of taxes they would contribute to the Imperial coffers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Adam Smith |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/smith-adam/works/wealth-of-nations/book04/ch07c-2.htm |title=Wealth of Nations  Bk 4 Chpt 07 (III p.2) |publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in October 1776 to Lord North in ''Strictures upon the Declaration of the Congress'' of the recent Declaration of Independence, and particularly of James Otis, Jr.'s pamphlet ''Rights of the British Colonies'' and its endorsement by the Massachusetts Assembly, Governor Thomas Hutchinson said, &lt;blockquote&gt;The Assembly of Massachusetts Bay, therefore, was the first that took any publick of the [Sugar] Act, and the first which ever took exception to the right of Parliament to impose Duties or Taxes on the Colonies, whilst they had no representatives in the House of Commons. This they did in a letter to their Agent in the summer of 1764, which they took care to print and publish before it was possible for him to receive it. And in this letter they recommend to him a pamphlet, wrote by one of their members, in which there are proposals for admitting representatives from the Colonies to fit in the House of Commons. I have this special reason, my Lord, for taking notice of this Act of the Massachusetts Assembly; that though an American representation is thrown out as an expedient which might obviate the objections to Taxes upon the Colonies, yet it was only intended to amuse the authority in England; and as soon as it was known to have its advocates here [in London], it was renounced by the colonies, and even by the Assembly of the Colony which first proposed it, as utterly impracticable."&lt;ref name="oll.libertyfund.org" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hutchinson 1776" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Indeed, the resolves of the Continental Congresses of both 1765 and 1774 declared that imperial representation was too impractical on the footing that "local and other circumstances, cannot properly be represented in the British parliament".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/resolves.asp |title=Avalon Project – Declaration and Resolves of the First Continental Congress |publisher=Avalon.law.yale.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The British Government, similarly, does not appear to have formally requested discussions with the Americans concerning the issue of Parliamentary seats until 1778.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=550146|title=Chatham and the Representation of the Colonies in the Imperial Parliament}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zqw3ou3i1McC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false John Phillip Reid, ''The Constitutional History of the American Revolution: The Authority of Law'' (University of Wisconsin Press, 2003)]&lt;/ref&gt;  In that year "the commissioners of the king of Great Britain," known as the Carlisle Peace Commission of 1778, made an offer to the Congress of "a reciprocal deputation of an agent or agents from the different states, who shall have the privilege of a seat and voice in the parliament of Great Britain".&lt;ref name="teachingamericanhistory.org" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Phillip Reid, ''The Constitutional History of the American Revolution: The Authority of Law'' (University of Wisconsin Press, 2003), p. 131-132.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Virtual representation ==
{{Main article|Virtual representation}}

In Britain, representation was highly limited due to unequally distributed voting constituencies and property requirements; only 3% of the population could vote and they were often controlled by local gentry.  This meant that spurious arguments had come to be employed in Britain to try to explain away and cover up the iniquities in its political life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McGee|first=Michael C.|title=The Rhetorical Process in Eighteenth Century England|url=http://mcgeefragments.net/OLD/rhetorical_process_england.htm |accessdate=March 18, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515204305/http://mcgeefragments.net/OLD/rhetorical_process_england.htm |archivedate=May 15, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/struggle_democracy/getting_vote.htm |title=Exhibitions &amp;#124; Citizenship &amp;#124; Struggle for democracy |publisher=The National Archives |date= |accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller p 212&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore the [[Her Majesty's Government|British government]] tried to argue that the colonists had [[virtual representation]] in their interests.  In the winter of 1764–65, George Grenville, and his secretary Thomas Whately, invented the doctrine of 'virtual representation' in an attempt extend the scope of such unjust arguments to America, and thereby attempt to legitimise the pernicious policies of the Stamp Act.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 13: Law and the Origins of the American Revolution – {{cite book|title=The Cambridge History of Law in America, Volume 1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KeEi14czrnoC&amp;pg=PA454&amp;dq=whately+virtual+representation#v=onepage&amp;q=whately%20virtual%20representation&amp;f=false|isbn=978-0-521-80305-2|author1=Grossberg|first1=Michael|last2=Tomlins|first2=Christopher|date=2008-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Debating the Issues in Colonial Newspapers: Primary Documents on Events of ..|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bm6kNpvnnhgC&amp;pg=PA205&amp;lpg=PA205&amp;dq=thomas+whately+virtual+representation+secretary+grenville#v=onepage&amp;q=thomas%20whately%20virtual%20representation%20secretary%20grenville&amp;f=false|isbn=978-0-313-30982-3|author1=Copeland|first1=David A|date=2000-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 5: Transformation – {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=p6-tKuFD1KsC&amp;pg=PA168&amp;dq=virtual+representation+american+revolution#v=onepage&amp;q=virtual%20representation%20american%20revolution&amp;f=false|title=THE IDEOLOGICAL ORIGINS OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION|isbn=978-0-674-07666-2|author1=Bailyn|first1=Bernard|date=2012-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In English history, "no taxation without representation" was an old principle and meant that Parliament had to pass all taxes. At first, the "representation" was held to be one of land, but, by 1700, this had shifted to the notion that, in Parliament, all British subjects had a "virtual representation." "We virtually and implicitly allow the institutions of any government of which we enjoy the benefit and solicit the protection," declared [[Samuel Johnson]] in his political pamphlet ''Taxation No Tyranny''. He rejected the plea that the colonists, who had no vote, were unrepresented. "They are represented," he said, "by the same virtual representation as the greater part of England."  However, the tradition of greater democracy amongst Americans gave impetus to the well-founded charge, voiced by Britons and colonists alike, that virtual representation was "sophistry" and "a mere Cob-web, spread to catch the unwary, and intangle [''sic''] the weak."&lt;ref&gt;Page 7 – {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xGsBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=daniel+dulany+cob-web,+spread+to+catch+the+unwary#v=onepage&amp;q=daniel%20dulany%20cob-web%2C%20spread%20to%20catch%20the%20unwary&amp;f=false|title=Considerations on the propriety of imposing taxes in the British colonies …|author1=Dulany|first1=Daniel|year=1765}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Page 82 – {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jnNbAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA82&amp;dq=sophistry+virtual+representation+british#v=onepage&amp;q=sophistry%20virtual%20representation%20british&amp;f=false|title=A Letter to the Right Honourable the Earl of Hilsborough, on the …, Volume 3|year=1769}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The colonial insistence on direct representation as opposed to virtual representation has thus been seen by later commentators to have "usher[ed] in a profound political and social revolution, which rooted out most of the remaining traces of monarchic rule and feudalism inherited from the only partially complete English bourgeois revolution. The Americans carried through the bourgeois democratic revolution on a scale never before seen in history."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marxist.com/class-struggle-and-the-american-revolution.htm|title=Class Struggle and the American Revolution|work=In defense of Marxism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Colonial reactions ===
Virtual representation was wholly rejected in the colonies also  who said the "virtual" was a cover for [[political corruption]] and was irreconcilable with their belief that government derives its just powers from the [[consent of the governed]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;Every British subject born on the continent of America, or in any other of the British dominions, is by the law of God and nature, by the common law, and by act of parliament, (exclusive of all charters from the Crown) entitled to all the natural, essential, inherent and inseparable rights of our fellow subjects in Great Britain. Among those rights...which it is humbly conceived no man or body of men, not excepting the parliament, justly, equitably and consistently with their own rights and the constitution, can take away...[are that the] supreme and subordinate powers of the legislation should be free and sacred in the hands where the community have once rightfully placed them...[that the] supreme national legislative cannot be altered justly ’till the commonwealth is dissolved, nor a subordinate legislative taken away without forfeiture or other good cause. Nor then can the subjects in the subordinate government be reduced to a state of slavery, and subject to the despotic rule of others...Even when the subordinate right of legislature is forfeited, and so declared, this cannot affect the natural persons either of those who were invested with it, or the inhabitants, so far as to deprive them of the rights of subjects and of men — The colonists will have an equitable right notwithstanding any such forfeiture of charter, to be represented in Parliament, or to have some new subordinate legislature among themselves. It would be best if they had both...[Furthermore, the right of every British subject is that the] supreme power cannot take from any man any part of his property, without his consent in person, or by representation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web|author=Bruce Frohnen |url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=669&amp;chapter=206126&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27 |title=The American Republic: Primary Sources – Online Library of Liberty |publisher=Oll.libertyfund.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Otis simultaneously refuted, in ''The Rights of the British Colonies Asserted and Proved'', a contemporary argument that attempted to rationalise virtual representation on the basis of the [[Colonial agent|colonial agents']] alleged influence on British policy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt;  "As to the colonists being represented by the provincial agents," he wrote,
&lt;blockquote&gt;I know of no power ever given them but to appear before his Majesty, and his ministry. Sometimes they have been directed to petition the parliament: But they none of them have, and I hope never will have, a power given them, by the colonists, to act as representatives, and to consent to taxes; and if they should make any concessions to the ministry, especially without order, the provinces could not by that be considered as represented in parliament.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Colonists said no man was represented if he were not allowed to vote. Moreover, even "If every inhabitant of America had the requisite freehold," said [[Daniel Dulany the Younger|Daniel Dulany]], "not one could vote, but upon the supposition of his ceasing to become an inhabitant of America, and becoming a resident of Great Britain."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tracts of the American Revolution 1763–1776|editor=Merrill, Jensen|page=99|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cfo8b75HOT0C&amp;pg=PA99&amp;dq=If+every+inhabitant+of+America+had+the+requisite+freehold+not+one+could+vote,+but+upon+the+supposition+of+his+ceasing+to+become+an+inhabitant+of+America,+and+becoming+a+resident+of+Great+Britain.%22#v=onepage&amp;q=If%20every%20inhabitant%20of%20America%20had%20the%20requisite%20freehold%20not%20one%20could%20vote%2C%20but%20upon%20the%20supposition%20of%20his%20ceasing%20to%20become%20an%20inhabitant%20of%20America%2C%20and%20becoming%20a%20resident%20of%20Great%20Britain.%22&amp;f=false|isbn=0-87220-693-9|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colonists and like-minded Britons insisted that representation was achieved only through an assembly of men actually elected by the persons they were intended to represent.&lt;ref name="google1" /&gt;

=== Pitt and Camden ===
The theory of virtual representation was attacked in Britain by [[Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden]], and his ally [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham]].  William Pitt argued in 1766 that the Commons of Britain ought not to tax the '"Commons of America" without gaining consent of their representatives in stating, "even under former arbitrary reigns, Parliaments were ashamed of taxing a people without their consent, and allowed them representatives. Why did [Grenville] confine himself to Chester and Durham? He might have taken a higher example in Wales—Wales, that never was taxed by Parliament till it was incorporated."&lt;ref name="bartleby.com" /&gt; He then said, &lt;blockquote&gt;I am no courtier of America. I stand up for this kingdom. I maintain that the Parliament has a right to bind, to restrain America. Our legislative power over the colonies is sovereign and supreme. When it ceases to be sovereign and supreme, I would advise every gentleman to sell his lands, if he can, and embark for that country. When two countries are connected together like England and her colonies, without being incorporated, the one must necessarily govern. The greater must rule the less. But she must so rule it as not to contradict the fundamental principles that are common to both... let the sovereign authority of this country over the colonies be asserted in as strong terms as can be devised, and be made to extend to every point of legislation whatsoever; that we may bind their trade, confine their manufactures, and exercise every power whatsoever, except that of taking their money out of their pockets without their consent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicpersuasion.org/cbo/chatham/chat08.htm#N_5_ |author=Earl of Chatham|title=Right of Taxing America|date=January 14, 1766 |publisher=Classicpersuasion.org |accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his first speeches in Parliament, Lord Camden vigorously attacked the declaratory act which was proposed to mollify the crown on the repeal of the Stamp Tax. After his first affirmation of "no taxation without representation" Camden was attacked by British PM Grenville, [[Chief Justice of the Common Pleas|Chief Justice]] [[James Mansfield]], [[Robert Henley, 1st Earl of Northington]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;16 Parliamentary History of England, London: Hansard, 1813, pp. 170-77. "Lord Northington, leaving the woolsack, commenced in a tone most insulting to the new Peer, and, what was much worse, most insulting to the people of America,--Benjamin Franklin being a listener below the bar … ." 5 Lord Campbell, Lives of the Lord Chancellors, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; He responded:&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he British Parliament have no right to tax the Americans. I shall not consider the Declaratory Bill now lying on your table; for to what purpose, but loss of time, to consider the particulars of a Bill, the very existence of which is illegal, absolutely illegal, contrary to the fundamental laws of nature, contrary to the fundamental laws of this constitution? A constitution grounded on the eternal and immutable laws of nature; a constitution whose foundation and centre is liberty, which sends liberty to every individual who may happen to be within any part of its ample circumference. Nor, my Lords, is the doctrine new, it is as old as the constitution; it grew up with it; indeed it is its support; taxation and representation are inseparably united; God hath joined them, no British parliament can separate them; to endeavour to do it, is to stab our very vitals. … My position is this—I repeat it—I will maintain it to my last hour,—taxation and representation are inseparable; this position is founded on the laws of nature; it is more, it is itself an eternal law of nature; for whatever is a man's own, is absolutely his own; no man has a right to take it from him without his consent, either expressed by himself or representative; whoever attempts to do it, attempts an injury; whoever does it, commits a robbery; he throws down and destroys the distinction between liberty and slavery. Taxation and representation are coeval with and essential to the constitution. … [T]here is not a blade of grass growing in the most obscure corner of this kingdom, which is not, which was not ever, represented since the constitution began; there is not a blade of grass, which when taxed, was not taxed by the consent of the proprietor. … I can never give my assent to any bill for taxing the American colonies, while they remain unrepresented; for as to the distinction of a virtual representation, it is so absurd as not to deserve an answer; I therefore pass it over with contempt. The forefathers of the Americans did not leave their native country, and subject themselves to every danger and distress, to be reduced to a state of slavery: they did not give up their rights; they looked for protection, and not for chains, from their mother country; by her they expected to be defended in the possession of their property, and not to be deprived of it: for, should the present power continue, there is nothing which they can call their own; or, to use the words of Mr. Locke, ‘What property have they in that, which another may, by right, take, when he pleases, to himself?’"&lt;ref&gt;16 Parliamentary History of England, London: Hansard, 1813, pp. 177-81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In an appearance before Parliament in January, 1766, former Prime Minister [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]] stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The idea of a virtual representation of America in this House is the most contemptible that ever entered into the head of a man. It does not deserve a serious refutation. The Commons of America, represented in their several assemblies, have ever been in possession of the exercise of this their constitutional right, of giving and granting their own money. They would have been slaves if they had not enjoyed it.&lt;ref&gt;Walford Davis Green, ''William Pitt, Earl of Chatham and the Growth and Division of the British Empire, 1708–1778.'' 1901. p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Grenville responded to Pitt, saying the disturbances in America "border on open rebellion; and if the doctrine I have heard this day be confirmed, nothing can tend more directly to produce a revolution." External and internal taxes are the same, argued Grenville.&lt;ref&gt;sFor legal questions surrounding the constitutional nature of the Imperial Crown-in-Parliament's right to legislate and tax for the British Isles and Empire, and the colonies' chartered rights to legislate and tax themselves see {{Cite journal

[[File:No tuition without representation Shimer College.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Shimer College]] student holds "No tuition without representation" sign during protest over school governance in 2010.]]
In the 1860s, [[suffragette]] [[Sarah E. Wall]] of [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] invoked the principle of "no taxation without representation", initiating an anti-tax protest in which she encouraged women not to pay taxes until they were [[Women's suffrage in the United States|granted the right to vote]]. Soon after she began this movement, the Worcester city tax collector sued Wall for refusing to pay taxes, and the case reached the [[Massachusetts Supreme Court]] in 1863. In "Wheeler v. Wall," the court ruled against Wall and held that despite not having the right to vote, women are still obligated to meet their tax burden. Even still, Wall refused to cooperate with the collector, and as a result, officers seized and sold her property in order to raise the money necessary to meet her tax obligation. After several years, Wall's inexorability eventually prevailed, as the collector began to ignore Wall and allow her to abstain from paying taxes.&lt;ref name=UMKC&gt;{{cite web|title=Address of Susan B. Anthony|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/anthony/anthonyaddress.html|work=University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law|accessdate=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1884, [[Susan B. Anthony]] cited Wall's audacity and willingness to stand up for women's suffrage, stating, "for the last twenty-five years, [she] has resisted the tax gatherer when he came around. I want you to look at her. She looks very harmless, but she will not pay a dollar of tax. She says when the Commonwealth of [[Massachusetts]] will give her the right of representation she will pay her taxes."&lt;ref name=Sven&gt;{{cite web|title=Debate on Woman Suffrage in the Senate of the United States, 2d Session, 49th Congress, December 8, 1886, and January 25, 1887|url=http://www.sveninho.com/book/2259482/Debate-on-Woman-Suffrage-in-the-Senate-of-the-United-States--2d-Session--49th-Congress--December-8--1886--and-January-25--1887/|work=Sven Digital Books|accessdate=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase is also used by other groups in America who pay various types of taxes ([[Sales tax|sales]], [[income tax|income]], [[property tax|property]]) but lack the ability to vote, such as [[Felony|felons]] (who are, in many states, [[Disenfranchisement|barred from voting]]), people who work in one state and live in another (thus having to pay income tax to a state they don't live in), or [[Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|people under 18]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://16tovote.com/reasons.html Top Reasons National Youth Rights Association of Southeast Florida Wants a Lower Voting Age], 16tovote.com&lt;/ref&gt;

To become citizens of the United States, [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants]] most often must be permanent residents for a period of time (usually 5 years).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uscis.gov/graphics/services/factsheet/howdoi/B3.pdf |title=USCIS Home Page |publisher=Uscis.gov |accessdate=2011-01-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925104214/http://www.uscis.gov/graphics/services/factsheet/howdoi/B3.pdf |archivedate=September 25, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Permanent residents must pay taxes on their worldwide income and, in most cases, cannot [[Elections in the United States|vote]]. However, throughout the 19th century, many states did allow immigrants to vote after they had declared their intention to become citizens. This was primarily because these new states were populated in large part by immigrants who had not yet attained citizenship. Throughout U.S. history, non-citizens have been allowed to vote in 40 U.S. states and territories.&lt;ref name=hayduk2006&gt;{{Citation

In 2009, the phrase "taxation without representation" was also used in the [[Tea Party protests]], where protesters were upset over increased government spending and taxes, and specifically regarding a growing concern amongst the group that the U.S. government is increasingly relying upon a form of taxation without representation through increased regulatory levies and fees which are allegedly passed via unelected government employees who have no direct responsibility to voters and cannot be held accountable by the public through elections.&lt;ref name=foxchicago&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myfoxchicago.com/dpp/news/TeaParty |title=Protestors Gather for Self-Styled Tea Party |publisher=Myfoxchicago.com |date=February 27, 2009 |accessdate=2011-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A modified version of the phrase, "no tuition without representation", is sometimes used in disputes over [[governance in higher education]] in the United States to emphasize student's rights to a voice in institutional decisions.  The term first emerged in a 1977 dispute at [[Union County College]] in New Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=New Jersey's Union College: A History, 1933–1983|page=232

British Prime Minister [[John Major]] used a modified version of the quote, with the order reversed, in October 1995, when at the [[United Nations]]'s 50th Anniversary celebrations he said, "It is not sustainable for states to enjoy representation without taxation," in order to criticize the billion-dollar [[arrears]] of the United States' payments to the UN, echoing a statement made the previous month at the opening session of the UN General Assembly by UK Foreign Secretary [[Malcolm Rifkind]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/finance/chronol/fin1995.htm |title=Chronology of the United Nations Financial Crisis: 1995 – Global Policy Forum |publisher=Globalpolicy.org |accessdate=2011-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, [[Québec]] politician [[Gilles Duceppe]], former leader of the [[Bloc Québécois]], has repeatedly cited this phrase in defending the presence of his party in [[Ottawa]]. The Bloc is a [[Quebec sovereignty movement|Québec sovereigntist]] party solely running candidates in Canadian Federal elections in the province of Québec.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3955">The '''Parable of the Assassin''' (also known as the '''Parable of the Killer'''),  is a [[parable]] attributed to [[Jesus]].  However, it appears in none of the [[Canonical gospels]] of the [[New Testament]] but only in the non-canonical [[Gospel of Thomas]]. According to the [[Gospel of Thomas]] 98 Jesus said:
:''"The kingdom of the father is like a certain man who wanted to kill a powerful man. In his own house he drew his sword and stuck it into the wall in order to find out whether his hand could carry through. Then he slew the powerful man."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gnosis.org/naghamm/gthlamb.html |title=Gospel of Thomas (Lambdin Translation) - The Nag Hammadi Library |publisher=Gnosis.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authenticity==
The scholars of the [[Jesus Seminar]] gave the parable of the assassin a "pink" rating, indicating 
that it is in their opinion probably, but not certainly, an authentic saying of Jesus.  They were influenced by parallels with the parables of the tower builder&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|14:28–14:30||}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of the warring king&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|14:31–14:32}}&lt;/ref&gt; found in the [[Gospel of Luke]] (see [[Counting the cost]]), and by the "scandalous nature of the image."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Walter Funk and Roy W. Hoover, ''The Five Gospels: What Did Jesus Really Say? the Search for the Authentic Words of Jesus'', HarperCollins, 1997, pp. 524–5&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Robert W. Funk|Robert Funk]], "[a]ttributing a parable to Jesus not attested in the canonical gospels and known only for a few years was an act of courage that demanded careful deliberation".&lt;ref name="p. 525"&gt;Robert Walter Funk and Roy W. Hoover, ''The Five Gospels: What Did Jesus Really Say? the Search for the Authentic Words of Jesus'', HarperCollins, 1997, [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN006063040X&amp;id=SRI-c0Pf3soC&amp;pg=RA1-PA525&amp;lpg=RA1-PA525&amp;ots=vP-Bse1Hs8&amp;dq=%22parable+of+the+assassin%22&amp;sig=NiYQB6gaCpUu-I-0f2ErfFbcaDE#PRA1-PA525,M1 p. 525]&lt;/ref&gt;  This decision by the Seminar has been criticized for inconsistency, since the parallel parable of the warring king in Luke was ''not'' given a pink rating.&lt;ref&gt;[[Craig A. Evans]], Bruce D. Chilton, ''Authenticating the Words of Jesus'', Brill Academic Publishers, 2002, [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0391041630&amp;id=Y96yVkPLeioC&amp;pg=RA2-PA411&amp;lpg=RA2-PA411&amp;ots=H4i_fUkshX&amp;dq=%22parable+of+the+assassin%22&amp;sig=-TM9AM60786w4cZIOnSdEbQSWUw#PRA2-PA411,M1 p. 411]&lt;/ref&gt;  The authenticity of this parable has been attacked on the grounds that Jesus would not use a parable that glorifies [[murder]], and because of its use of the phrase "the kingdom of the father" which is not found in the canonical gospels.

==Meaning==
Like the Lucan parables of the warring king and the tower, this parable seems to concern "estimating the cost of an act or the capability to perform it successfully."{{Citation needed|date=December 2009|reason = dead link: http://www.bibletexts.com/texts/parables.htm#assassin }} In Mark 7:21–23, Jesus explains the idea of evil being rehearsed before taking place. "For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders, thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness: all these evil things come from within, and defile the man."{{Or|date=November 2007}} According to some of the fellows of the Jesus Seminar, "the story line of the parable originally had to do with Davidic reversal, as in David and Goliath: the little guy bests the big guy by taking the precautions a prudent person would take before encountering the village bully".&lt;ref name="p. 525"/&gt; A similar message can be found in the [[parable of the strong man]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9632">'''Pontryagin's maximum (or minimum) principle''' is used in [[optimal control]] theory to find the best possible control for taking a [[dynamical system]] from one state to another, especially in the presence of constraints for the state or input controls. It was formulated in 1956 by the Russian mathematician [[Lev Pontryagin]] and his students.&lt;ref&gt;See ref. below for first published work.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has as a special case the [[Euler–Lagrange equation]] of the [[calculus of variations]].

The principle states, informally, that the ''control Hamiltonian'' must take an extreme value over controls in the set of all permissible controls. Whether the extreme value is maximum or minimum depends both on the problem and on the sign convention used for defining the Hamiltonian. The normal convention, which is the one used in [[Hamiltonian (control theory)|Hamiltonian]], leads to a maximum hence ''maximum principle'' but the sign convention used in this article makes the extreme value a minimum.

If &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of values of permissible controls then the principle states that the optimal control &lt;math&gt;u^*&lt;/math&gt; must satisfy:
:&lt;math&gt;H(x^*(t),u^*(t),\lambda^*(t),t) \leq H(x^*(t),u,\lambda^*(t),t), \quad \forall u \in \mathcal{U}, \quad t \in [t_0, t_f]&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;x^*\in C^1[t_0,t_f]&lt;/math&gt; is the optimal state trajectory and &lt;math&gt;\lambda^* \in BV[t_0,t_f]&lt;/math&gt; is the optimal [[costate]] trajectory.&lt;ref&gt;More info on [[Smoothness#Order of continuity|C&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;]] and [[Bounded variation|BV]] spaces&lt;/ref&gt;

The result was first successfully applied to minimum time problems where the input control is constrained, but it can also be useful in studying state-constrained problems.

Special conditions for the Hamiltonian can also be derived. When the final time &lt;math&gt;t_f&lt;/math&gt; is fixed and the Hamiltonian does not depend explicitly on time &lt;math&gt;\left(\tfrac{\partial H}{\partial t} \equiv 0\right)&lt;/math&gt;, then:
:&lt;math&gt;H(x^*(t),u^*(t),\lambda^*(t)) \equiv \mathrm{constant}\,&lt;/math&gt;
and if the final time is free, then:
:&lt;math&gt;H(x^*(t),u^*(t),\lambda^*(t)) \equiv 0.\,&lt;/math&gt;
More general conditions on the optimal control are given below.

When satisfied along a trajectory, Pontryagin's minimum principle is a [[necessary condition]] for an optimum. The [[Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation]] provides a [[Necessity and sufficiency|necessary and sufficient condition]] for an optimum, but this condition must be satisfied over the whole of the state space.

While the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation admits [[Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation#Extension to stochastic problems|a straightforward extension]] to stochastic optimal control problems, the minimum principle does not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yong|first1=J.|last2=Zhou|first2=X. Y.|title=Stochastic Controls: Hamiltonian Systems and HJB Equations|date=1999|publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maximization and minimization==

The principle was first known as ''Pontryagin's maximum principle'' and its proof is historically based on maximizing the Hamiltonian. The initial application of this principle was to the maximization of the terminal speed of a rocket. However, as it was subsequently mostly used for minimization of a performance index it has here been referred to as the ''minimum principle''.  Pontryagin's book solved the problem of minimizing a performance index.&lt;ref&gt;See p.13 of the 1962 book of Pontryagin et al. referenced below.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notation==
In what follows we will be making use of the following notation.
:&lt;math&gt;
\Psi_T(x(T))= \frac{\partial \Psi(x)}{\partial T}|_{x=x(T)} \,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\Psi_x(x(T))=\begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial
\Psi(x)}{\partial x_1}|_{x=x(T)} &amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{\partial
\Psi(x)}{\partial x_n} |_{x=x(T)}
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
H_x(x^*,u^*,\lambda^*,t)=\begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial H}{\partial x_1}|_{x=x^*,u=u^*,\lambda=\lambda^*}
&amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{\partial H}{\partial x_n}|_{x=x^*,u=u^*,\lambda=\lambda^*}
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
L_x(x^*,u^*)=\begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial L}{\partial x_1}|_{x=x^*,u=u^*}
&amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{\partial L}{\partial x_n}|_{x=x^*,u=u^*}
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
f_x(x^*,u^*)=\begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_1}|_{x=x^*,u=u^*} &amp; \cdots &amp; \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_n}|_{x=x^*,u=u^*} \\
\vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\ \frac{\partial f_n}{\partial x_1}|_{x=x^*,u=u^*} &amp;
\ldots &amp; \frac{\partial f_n}{\partial x_n}|_{x=x^*,u=u^*}
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Formal statement of necessary conditions for minimization problem==
Here the necessary conditions are shown for minimization of a functional. Take &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to be the state of the [[dynamical system]] with input &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;, such that
:&lt;math&gt;
\dot{x}=f(x,u), \quad x(0)=x_0, \quad u(t) \in \mathcal{U}, \quad t \in
[0,T]
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of admissible controls and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the terminal (i.e., final) time of the system. The control &lt;math&gt;u \in \mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; must be chosen for all &lt;math&gt;t \in [0,T]&lt;/math&gt; to minimize the objective functional &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; which is defined by the application and can be abstracted as

:&lt;math&gt;
J=\Psi(x(T))+\int^T_0 L(x(t),u(t)) \,dt
&lt;/math&gt;

The constraints on the system dynamics can be adjoined to the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; by introducing time-varying [[Lagrange multipliers|Lagrange multiplier]] vector &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, whose elements are called the costates of the system. This motivates the construction of the [[Hamiltonian (control theory)|Hamiltonian]] &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; defined for all &lt;math&gt;t \in [0,T]&lt;/math&gt; by:
:&lt;math&gt;
H(x(t),u(t),\lambda(t),t)=\lambda^{\rm T}(t)f(x(t),u(t))+L(x(t),u(t)) \,
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\lambda^{\rm T}&lt;/math&gt; is the transpose of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.

Pontryagin's minimum principle states that the optimal state trajectory &lt;math&gt;x^*&lt;/math&gt;, optimal control &lt;math&gt;u^*&lt;/math&gt;, and corresponding Lagrange multiplier vector &lt;math&gt;\lambda^*&lt;/math&gt; must  minimize the Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; so that

:&lt;math&gt;
(1) \qquad H(x^*(t),u^*(t),\lambda^*(t),t)\leq H(x^*(t),u,\lambda^*(t),t) \,
&lt;/math&gt;

for all time &lt;math&gt;t \in [0,T]&lt;/math&gt; and for all permissible control inputs &lt;math&gt;u \in \mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt;. It must also be the case that

:&lt;math&gt;
(2) \qquad \Psi_T(x(T))+H(T)=0 \,
&lt;/math&gt;

Additionally, the [[costate equations]]

:&lt;math&gt;
(3) \qquad -\dot{\lambda}^{\rm T}(t)=H_x(x^*(t),u^*(t),\lambda(t),t)=\lambda^{\rm T}(t)f_x(x^*(t),u^*(t))+L_x(x^*(t),u^*(t))
&lt;/math&gt;

must be satisfied. If the final state &lt;math&gt;x(T)&lt;/math&gt; is not fixed (i.e., its differential variation is not zero), it must also be that the terminal costates are such that

:&lt;math&gt;
(4) \qquad \lambda^{\rm T}(T)=\Psi_x(x(T)) \,
&lt;/math&gt;

These four conditions in (1)-(4) are the necessary conditions for an optimal control. Note that (4) only applies when &lt;math&gt;x(T)&lt;/math&gt; is free. If it is fixed, then this condition is not necessary for an optimum.

'''Privacy by design''' is an approach to [[systems engineering]] initially developed by [[Ann Cavoukian]] and formalized in a joint report on [[privacy-enhancing technologies]] by a joint team of the [[Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario]] (Canada), the [[Dutch Data Protection Authority]] and the [[Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research]] in 1995.&lt;ref name="Privacy Enhancing Technologies: the path to anonymity"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hes|first=R|title=Privacy Enhancing Technologies: the path to anonymity|url=http://www.ontla.on.ca/library/repository/mon/10000/184530.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deliveringthepromises"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hustinx|first=Peter|title=Privacy by Design: Delivering the Promises|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12394-010-0061-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; The privacy by design framework was published in 2009&lt;ref name=7principles/&gt; and adopted by the International Assembly of Privacy Commissioners and Data Protection Authorities in 2010.&lt;ref name=resolution/&gt; Privacy by design calls for [[privacy]] to be taken into account throughout the whole engineering process. The concept is an example of [[value sensitive design]], i.e., to take human values into account in a well-defined manner throughout the whole process and may have been derived from this.

Cavoukian's approach to privacy has been criticized as being vague&lt;ref name="Designing Privacy by Design"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;, difficult to enforce its adoption&lt;ref name=Counterfactual&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;, difficult to apply to certain disciplines&lt;ref name="Engineering Privacy by Design"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;, as well as prioritizing corporate interests over consumers' interests&lt;ref name="Designing Privacy by Design"/&gt; and placing insufficient emphasis on minimizing data collection&lt;ref name="Engineering Privacy by Design"/&gt;.

The European [[GDPR]] regulation incorporates privacy by design.&lt;ref name=Opinion/&gt;

==History and background==
The privacy by design framework was developed by Dr. [[Ann Cavoukian]], [[Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario]], following her joint work with the [[Dutch Data Protection Authority]] and the [[Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research]] in 1995.&lt;ref name="Privacy Enhancing Technologies: the path to anonymity"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Opinion/&gt;
In 2009, the [[Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario]] co-hosted an event, ''Privacy by Design: The Definitive Workshop'', with the Israeli Law, Information and Technology Authority at the 31st International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioner (2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Privacy Conference 2009 Fifth Plenary Session – Privacy by Design|url=http://www.privacyconference2009.org/program/Programa_detallado/index-iden-idweb.html#sesion5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=report2011&gt;{{cite web|title=Report on the State of PbD to the 33rd International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners|url=https://ipc.v51.com/wp-content/uploads/Resources/PbDReport.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Foundational principles ==
Privacy by design is based on seven "foundational principles":&lt;ref name=7principles&gt;{{cite web|last=Cavoukian|first=Ann|url=https://www.ipc.on.ca/wp-content/uploads/Resources/7foundationalprinciples.pdf|title=7 Foundational Principles}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=7principlesFIPmapping/&gt;&lt;ref name=pbdPrimer/&gt;&lt;ref name=7P-Ryerson/&gt;

The principles have been cited in over five hundred articles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=10949576998236199397|title=Citations for ''Privacy by Design in Law, Policy and Practice''|publisher=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the ''Privacy by Design in Law, Policy and Practice'' white paper by [[Ann Cavoukian]].&lt;ref name=pbdLawPolicyPracitice&gt;{{cite web|last=Cavoukian|first=Ann|url=http://www.ontla.on.ca/library/repository/mon/25008/312239.pdf|title="Privacy by Design in Law, Policy and Practice – A White Paper for Regulators, Decision-makers and Policy-makers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Foundational principles in detail ===
====Proactive not reactive; preventative not remedial==== 
The privacy by design approach is characterized by proactive rather than reactive measures. It anticipates and prevents privacy invasive events before they happen. Privacy by design does not wait for privacy risks to materialize, nor does it offer remedies for resolving privacy infractions once they have occurred — it aims to prevent them from occurring. In short, privacy by design comes before-the-fact, not after.
&lt;ref name=7principlesFIPmapping&gt;{{cite web|last=Cavoukian|first=Ann|url=https://www.ipc.on.ca/wp-content/uploads/Resources/pbd-implement-7found-principles.pdf|title=The 7 Foundational Principles Implementation and Mapping of Fair Information Practices|date=January 2011|publisher=Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pbdPrimer&gt;{{cite web|last=Cavoukian|first=Ann|url=https://ipc.v51.com/wp-content/uploads/Resources/pbd-primer.pdf|title=Privacy by Design – Primer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=7P-Ryerson&gt;{{cite web|last=Cavoukian|first=Ann|url=https://www.ryerson.ca/content/dam/pbdce/seven-foundational-principles/The-7-Foundational-Principles.pdf|title=Privacy by Design – The 7 Foundational Principles|publisher=Privacy and Big Data Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Privacy as the default====
Privacy by design seeks to deliver the maximum degree of privacy by ensuring that personal data are automatically protected in any given IT system or business practice. If an individual does nothing, their privacy still remains intact. No action is required on the part of the individual to protect their privacy — it is built into the system, by default.&lt;ref name=7principlesFIPmapping/&gt;&lt;ref name=pbdPrimer/&gt;&lt;ref name=7P-Ryerson/&gt;

====Privacy embedded into design====
Privacy by design is embedded into the design and architecture of IT systems as well as business practices. It is not bolted on as an add-on, after the fact. The result is that privacy becomes an essential component of the core functionality being delivered. Privacy is integral to the system without diminishing functionality.&lt;ref name=7principlesFIPmapping/&gt;&lt;ref name=pbdPrimer/&gt;&lt;ref name=7P-Ryerson/&gt;

====Full functionality – positive-sum, not zero-sum====
Privacy by design seeks to accommodate all legitimate interests and objectives in a positive-sum “win-win” manner, not through a dated, zero-sum approach, where unnecessary trade-offs are made. Privacy by design avoids the pretense of false dichotomies, such as privacy versus security, demonstrating that it is possible to have both.&lt;ref name=7principlesFIPmapping/&gt;&lt;ref name=pbdPrimer/&gt;&lt;ref name=7P-Ryerson/&gt;

====End-to-end security – full lifecycle protection====
Privacy by design, having been embedded into the system prior to the first element of information being collected, extends securely throughout the entire lifecycle of the data involved — strong security measures are essential to privacy, from start to finish. This ensures that all data are securely retained, and then securely destroyed at the end of the process, in a timely fashion. Thus, privacy by design ensures cradle-to-grave, secure lifecycle management of information, end-to-end.&lt;ref name=7principlesFIPmapping/&gt;&lt;ref name=pbdPrimer/&gt;&lt;ref name=7P-Ryerson/&gt;

====Visibility and transparency – keep it open====
Privacy by design seeks to assure all stakeholders that whatever the business practice or technology involved, it is in fact, operating according to the stated promises and objectives, subject to independent verification. Its component parts and operations remain visible and transparent, to users and providers alike. Remember, trust but verify.&lt;ref name=7principlesFIPmapping/&gt;&lt;ref name=pbdPrimer/&gt;&lt;ref name=7P-Ryerson/&gt;

====Respect for user privacy – keep it user-centric====
Above all, privacy by design requires architects and operators to keep the interests of the individual uppermost by offering such measures as strong privacy defaults, appropriate notice, and empowering user-friendly options. Keep it user-centric.&lt;ref name=7principlesFIPmapping/&gt;&lt;ref name=pbdPrimer/&gt;&lt;ref name=7P-Ryerson/&gt;

==Design and standards==
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) approved the Committee on Consumer Policy (COPOLCO) proposal for a new ISO standard: ''Consumer Protection: Privacy by Design for Consumer Goods and Services'' (ISO/PC317).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISO/PC 317 - Consumer protection: privacy by design for consumer goods and services|url=https://www.iso.org/committee/6935430.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard will aim to specify the design process to provide consumer goods and services that meet consumers’ domestic processing privacy needs as well as the personal privacy requirements of data protection. The standard has the UK as secretariat with thirteen participating members&lt;ref name=ISOPC317Members&gt;{{cite web|title=ISO/PC 317 - Participating Members|url=https://www.iso.org/committee/6935430.html?view=participation}}&lt;/ref&gt; and twenty observing members.&lt;ref name=ISOPC317Members/&gt;

The Standards Council of Canada (SCC) is one of the participating members, and has established a mirror Canadian committee to ISO/PC317.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SCC ISO/PC 317 - Consumer protection: privacy by design for consumer goods and services|url=https://www.scc.ca/en/standards/committees/iso-pc-317-consumer-protection-privacy-design-for-consumer-goods-and-services}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The OASIS Privacy by Design Documentation for Software Engineers (PbD-SE)&lt;ref name=OASIS&gt;{{cite web|title=OASIS Privacy by Design Documentation for Software Engineers (PbD-SE) TC|url=https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=pbd-ses}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technical Committee provides a specification to operationalize privacy by design in the context of software engineering. Privacy by design, like security by design, is a normal part of the software development process and a risk reduction strategy for software engineers. The PbD-SE specification translates the PbD principles to conformance requirements within software engineering tasks, and helps software development teams to produce [[artifact (software development)|artifact]]s as evidence of PbD principle adherence. Following the specification facilitates the documentation of privacy requirements from software conception to retirement, thereby providing a plan around adherence to privacy by design principles, and other guidance to privacy best practices, such as NIST’s 800-53 Appendix J (NIST SP 800-53) and the Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPs) (PMRM-1.0).&lt;ref name=OASIS/&gt;

==Relationship to privacy-enhancing technologies == 
Privacy by design originated from [[privacy-enhancing technologies]] (PETs) in a joint 1995 report by Ann Cavoukian and John Borking.&lt;ref name="Privacy Enhancing Technologies: the path to anonymity"/&gt; In 2007 the [[European Commission]] provided a memo on PETs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs)|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-07-159_en.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 the British Information Commissioner's Office commissioned a report titled ''Privacy by Design – An Overview of Privacy Enhancing Technologies''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Privacy by Design – An Overview of Privacy Enhancing Technologies|url=http://www.dsp.utoronto.ca/projects/surveillance/docs/pbd_pets_paper.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many facets to privacy by design, including software and systems engineering as well as administrative elements (e.g. legal, policy, procedural), other organizational controls and operating contexts. Privacy by design evolved from early efforts to express fair information practice principles directly into the design and operation of information and communications technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cavoukian|first=Ann|title=Privacy by Design : Origins, Meaning, and Prospects for Assuring Privacy and Trust in the Information Era)|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/289769458_Privacy_by_Design_Origins_meaning_and_prospects_for_assuring_privacy_and_trust_in_the_information_era}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his publication ''Privacy by Design: Delivering the Promises''&lt;ref name="deliveringthepromises"/&gt; [[Peter Hustinx]] acknowledges the key role played by [[Ann Cavoukian]] and [[John Borking]], then Deputy Privacy Commissioners, in the joint 1995 publication ''Privacy-Enhancing Technologies: The Path to Anonymity''.&lt;ref name="Privacy Enhancing Technologies: the path to anonymity"/&gt; This 1995 report focussed on exploring technologies that permit transactions to be conducted anonymously.

Privacy-enhancing technologies allow online users to protect the privacy of their personally identifiable information (PII) provided to (and handled by) services or applications. Privacy by design evolved to consider the broader systems and processes in which PETs were embedded and operated. The U.S. Center for Democracy &amp; Technology (CDT) in ''The Role of Privacy by Design in Protecting Consumer Privacy''&lt;ref name=RoleProtectingConsumers&gt;{{cite web|title=The Role of Privacy by Design in Protecting Consumer Privacy|url=https://cdt.org/insight/the-role-of-privacy-by-design-in-protecting-consumer-privacy-1/}}&lt;/ref&gt; distinguishes PET from privacy by design noting that “PETs are most useful for users who already understand online privacy risks. They are essential user empowerment tools, but they form only a single piece of a broader framework that should be considered when discussing how technology can be used in the service of protecting privacy.”&lt;ref name=RoleProtectingConsumers/&gt;

== Criticism and recommendations==
The privacy by design framework attracted academic debate, particularly following the 2010 International Data Commissioners resolution, these provide criticism of privacy by design with suggestions by legal and engineering experts to better understand how to apply the framework into various contexts.&lt;ref name="Designing Privacy by Design"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Engineering Privacy by Design"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Counterfactual/&gt;

Privacy by design has been critiqued as "vague"&lt;ref name="Designing Privacy by Design"&gt;{{cite web|last=van Rest|first=Jeroen|title=Designing Privacy by Design|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-54069-1_4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and leaving "many open questions about their application when engineering systems".&lt;ref name="Engineering Privacy by Design"&gt;{{cite web|title=Engineering Privacy by Design|url=http://www.cosic.esat.kuleuven.be/publications/article-1542.pdf|work=Seda Gurses, Carmela Troncoso, and Claudia Diaz}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2007, researchers at K.U. Leuven published ''Engineering Privacy by Design'' noting that “The design and implementation of privacy requirements in systems is a difficult problem and requires translation of complex social, legal and ethical concerns into systems requirements”. The authors claim that their statement regarding that the principles of privacy by design "remain vague and leave many open questions about their application when engineering systems", may be viewed as criticism. However, the purpose of the paper is to propose that "starting from data minimization is a necessary and foundational first step to engineer systems in line with the principles of privacy by design". The objective of their paper is to provide an "initial inquiry into the practice of privacy by design from an engineering perspective in order to contribute to the closing of the gap between policy makers’ and engineers’ understanding of privacy by design".&lt;ref name="Engineering Privacy by Design"/&gt; 

It has also been pointed out that privacy by design is similar to [[voluntary compliance]] schemes in industries impacting the environment, and thus lacks the teeth necessary to be effective, and may differ per company. In addition, the evolutionary approach currently taken to the development of the concept will come at the cost of privacy infringements because evolution implies also letting unfit phenotypes (privacy-invading products) live until they are proven unfit.&lt;ref name="Designing Privacy by Design"/&gt; Some critics have pointed out that certain business models are built around customer surveillance and data manipulation and therefore voluntary compliance is unlikely.&lt;ref name=Counterfactual&gt;{{cite web|title=Privacy by Design: A Counterfactual Analysis of Google and Facebook Privacy Incidents|ssrn=2128146|work=Ira Rubinstein and Nathan Good}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the Danish National It and Telecom Agency published as discussion paper on "New Digital Security Models" the publication references "Privacy by Design" as a key goal in creating a security model that is compliant with "Privacy by Design". This is done by extending the concept to "Security by Design" with an objective of balancing anonymity and surveillance by eliminating identification as much as possible.&lt;ref name="New Digital Security Models"&gt;{{cite web|title=New Digital Security Models|url=https://www.digitaliser.dk/resource/896495/artefact/NewDigitalSecurityModels.pdf?artefact=true&amp;PID=1792137|work=Danish National It and Telecom Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2013, Rubenstein and Good used [[Google]] and [[Facebook]] privacy incidents to conduct a counterfactual analysis in order to identify lessons learned of value for regulators when recommending privacy by design. The first was that “more detailed principles and specific examples” would be more helpful to companies. The second is that “usability is just as important as engineering principles and practices”. The third is that there needs to be more work on “refining and elaborating on design principles–both in privacy engineering and usability design”. including efforts to define international privacy standards. The final lesson learned is that “regulators must do more than merely recommend the adoption and implementation of privacy by design”.&lt;ref name=Counterfactual/&gt;

Another criticism is that current definitions of privacy by design do not address the methodological aspect of systems engineering, such as using decent system engineering methods, e.g. those which cover the complete system and data life cycle. The concept also does not focus on the role of the actual data holder but on that of the system designer. This role is not known in privacy law, so the concept of privacy by design is not based in law. This, in turn, undermines the trust by data subjects, data holders and policy-makers.&lt;ref name="Designing Privacy by Design"/&gt;

The advent of [[GDPR]] with its maximum fine of 4% of global turnover now provides a balance between business benefit and turnover, and addresses the [[voluntary compliance]] criticism and requirement from Rubenstein and Good that “regulators must do more than merely recommend the adoption and implementation of privacy by design”.&lt;ref name=Counterfactual/&gt; Rubenstein and Good also highlighted that privacy by design could result in applications that exemplified Privacy by Design and their work was well received.&lt;ref name=CorporateHotness&gt;{{cite web|title=Why 'Privacy By Design' Is The New Corporate Hotness|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2011/07/28/why-privacy-by-design-is-the-new-corporate-hotness|work=Kashmir Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Counterfactual/&gt;

The May 2018 [[European Data Protection Supervisor]] [[Giovanni Buttarelli]]'s paper ''Preliminary Opinion on Privacy by Design'' states, "While privacy by design has made significant progress in legal, technological and conceptual development, it is still far from unfolding its full potential for the protection of the fundamental rights of individuals. The following sections of this opinion provide an overview of relevant developments and recommend further efforts".&lt;ref name=Opinion&gt;{{cite web|title=Preliminary Opinion on privacy by design|url=https://edps.europa.eu/sites/edp/files/publication/18-05-31_preliminary_opinion_on_privacy_by_design_en_0.pdf|work=Giovanni Buttarelli}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The executive summary makes the following recommendations to EU institutions:
* To ensure strong privacy protection, including privacy by design, in the ePrivacy Regulation.
* To support privacy in all legal frameworks which influence the design of technology, increasing incentives and substantiating obligations, including appropriate liability rules,
* To foster the roll-out and adoption of privacy by design approaches and PETs in the EU and at the member states’ level through appropriate implementing measures and policy initiatives,
* To ensure competence and resources for research and analysis on privacy engineering and privacy enhancing technologies at EU level, by ENISA or other entities,
* To support the development of new practices and business models through the research and technology development instruments of the EU,
* To support EU and national public administrations to integrate appropriate privacy by design requirements in public procurement,
* To support an inventory and observatory of the “state of the art” of privacy engineering and PETs and their advancement.

The EDPS will:
* Continue to promote privacy by design, where appropriate in cooperation with other data protection authorities in the European Data Protection Board (EDPB),
* Support coordinated and effective enforcement of Article 25 of the GDPR and related provisions,
* Provide guidance to controllers on the appropriate implementation of the principle laid down in the legal base, and
* Together with the DPAs of Austria, Ireland and Schleswig-Holstein, award privacy friendly apps in the mobile health domain.&lt;ref name=Opinion/&gt;

==Implementing privacy by design==
The [[European Data Protection Supervisor]] [[Giovanni Buttarelli]] set out the requirement to implement privacy by design in his article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Privacy by Design - Privacy Engineering|url=https://edps.europa.eu/sites/edp/files/publication/18-01-25_privacy_by_design_privacy_engineering_cpdp_en_3.pdf|work=Giovanni Buttarelli}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Union Agency for Network and Information Security]] (ENISA) provided a detailed report ''Privacy and Data Protection by Design – From Policy to Engineering'' on implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Privacy and Data Protection by Design – from policy to engineering|url=https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/privacy-and-data-protection-by-design/at_download/fullReport|work=ENISA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Summer School on real-world crypto and privacy provided a tutorial on "Engineering Privacy by Design".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Engineering privacy by design|url=https://summerschool-croatia.cs.ru.nl/2017/slides/Engineering%20privacy%20by%20design.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Top_10_Privacy_Risks_Project OWASP Top 10 Privacy Risks Project] for web applications that gives hints on how to implement privacy by design in practice. The OASIS Privacy by Design Documentation for Software Engineers (PbD-SE)&lt;ref name=OASIS/&gt; offers a privacy extension/complement to OMG’s Unified Modeling Language (UML) and serves as a complement to OASIS’ eXtensible Access Control Mark-up Language (XACML) and Privacy Management Reference Model (PMRM).

Broadly speaking, '''pure mathematics''' is [[mathematics]] that studies entirely abstract [[concept]]s.  This has been a recognizable category of mathematical activity from the 19th century onwards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Piaggio|first1=H|title=Three Sadleirian Professors: A.R. Forsyth, E.W. Hobson and G.H. Hardy|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Extras/Sadleirian_Professors.html|website=MacTutor History of Mathematics archive|publisher=St. Andrews University|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; at variance with the trend towards meeting the needs of [[navigation]], [[astronomy]], [[physics]], [[economics]], [[engineering]], and so on.

Another view is that pure mathematics is ''not necessarily'' [[applied mathematics]]: it is possible to study abstract entities with respect to their intrinsic nature and not be concerned with how they manifest in the real world.&lt;ref name=Magid/&gt; Even though the pure and applied viewpoints are distinct philosophical positions, in practice there is much overlap in the activity of pure and applied mathematicians.

To develop accurate models for describing the real world, many applied mathematicians draw on tools and techniques that are often considered to be "pure" mathematics. On the other hand, many pure mathematicians draw on natural and social phenomena as inspiration for their abstract research.

==History==

===Ancient Greece===
Ancient Greek mathematicians were among the earliest to make a distinction between pure and applied mathematics. [[Plato]] helped to create the gap between "arithmetic", now called [[number theory]], and "logistic", now called [[arithmetic]]. Plato regarded logistic (arithmetic) as appropriate for businessmen and men of war who "must learn the art of numbers or [they] will not know how to array [their] troops" and arithmetic (number theory) as appropriate for philosophers "because [they have] to arise out of the sea of change and lay hold of true being."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Carl B. |last=Boyer |authorlink=Carl Benjamin Boyer |title=A History of Mathematics |edition=Second |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |year=1991 |isbn=0-471-54397-7|chapter=The age of Plato and Aristotle|pages=86|quote=Plato is important in the history of mathematics largely for his role as inspirer and director of others, and perhaps to him is due the sharp distinction in ancient Greece between arithmetic (in the sense of the theory of numbers) and logistic (the technique of computation). Plato regarded logistic as appropriate for the businessman and for the man of war, who "must learn the art of numbers or he will not know how to array his troops." The philosopher, on the other hand, must be an arithmetician "because he has to arise out of the sea of change and lay hold of true being."}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Euclid of Alexandria]], when asked by one of his students of what use was the study of geometry, asked his slave to give the student threepence, "since he must make gain of what he learns."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Carl B. |last=Boyer |authorlink=Carl Benjamin Boyer |title=A History of Mathematics |edition=Second |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |year=1991 |isbn=0-471-54397-7|chapter=Euclid of Alexandria |pages=101 |quote=Evidently Euclid did not stress the practical aspects of his subject, for there is a tale told of him that when one of his students asked of what use was the study of geometry, Euclid asked his slave to give the student threepence, "since he must make gain of what he learns."}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek mathematician [[Apollonius of Perga]] was asked about the usefulness of some of his theorems in Book IV of ''Conics'' to which he proudly asserted,&lt;ref name="Apollonius"&gt;{{cite book|first=Carl B. |last=Boyer |authorlink=Carl Benjamin Boyer |title=A History of Mathematics |edition=Second |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |year=1991 |isbn=0-471-54397-7|chapter=Apollonius of Perga|pages=152|quote=It is in connection with the theorems in this book that Apollonius makes a statement implying that in his day, as in ours, there were narrow-minded opponents of pure mathematics who pejoratively inquired about the usefulness of such results. The author proudly asserted: "They are worthy of acceptance for the sake of the demonstrations themselves, in the same way as we accept many other things in mathematics for this and for no other reason." (Heath 1961, p.lxxiv).&lt;BR&gt;The preface to Book V, relating to maximum and minimum straight lines drawn to a conic, again argues that the subject is one of those that seem "worthy of study for their own sake." While one must admire the author for his lofty intellectual attitude, it may be pertinently pointed out that s day was beautiful theory, with no prospect of applicability to the science or engineering of his time, has since become fundamental in such fields as terrestrial dynamics and celestial mechanics.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;They are worthy of acceptance for the sake of the demonstrations themselves, in the same way as we accept many other things in mathematics for this and for no other reason.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
And since many of his results were not applicable to the science or engineering of his day, Apollonius further argued in the preface of the fifth book of ''Conics'' that the subject is one of those that "...seem worthy of study for their own sake."&lt;ref name="Apollonius"/&gt;

===19th century===
The term itself is enshrined in the full title of the [[Sadleirian Professor of Pure Mathematics|Sadleirian Chair]], founded (as a professorship) in the mid-nineteenth century. The idea of a separate discipline of ''pure'' mathematics may have emerged at that time. The generation of [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] made no sweeping distinction of the kind, between ''pure'' and ''applied''. In the following years, specialisation and professionalisation (particularly in the [[Weierstrass]] approach to [[mathematical analysis]]) started to make a rift more apparent.

===20th century===
At the start of the twentieth century mathematicians took up the [[axiomatic method]], strongly influenced by [[David Hilbert]]'s example. The logical formulation of '''pure mathematics''' suggested by [[Bertrand Russell]] in terms of a [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifier]] structure of [[Proposition (mathematics)|proposition]]s seemed more and more plausible, as large parts of mathematics became axiomatised and thus subject to the simple criteria of ''[[rigorous proof]]''.

In fact in an axiomatic setting ''rigorous'' adds nothing to the idea of ''proof''. Pure mathematics, according to a view that can be ascribed to the [[Bourbaki group]], is what is proved. '''Pure mathematician''' became a recognized vocation, achievable through training.

The case was made that pure mathematics is useful in [[engineering education]]:&lt;ref&gt;[[A. S. Hathaway]] (1901) [http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1901-07-06/S0002-9904-1901-00797-5/S0002-9904-1901-00797-5.pdf "Pure mathematics for engineering students"], [[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]] 7(6):266–71.&lt;/ref&gt;
:There is a training in habits of thought, points of view, and intellectual comprehension of ordinary engineering problems, which only the study of higher mathematics can give.

==Generality and abstraction==
One central concept in pure mathematics is the idea of generality; pure mathematics often exhibits a trend towards increased generality. Uses and advantages of generality include the following:

* Generalizing theorems or mathematical structures can lead to deeper understanding of the original theorems or structures
* Generality can simplify the presentation of material, resulting in shorter proofs or arguments that are easier to follow.
* One can use generality to avoid duplication of effort, proving a general result instead of having to prove separate cases independently, or using results from other areas of mathematics.
* Generality can facilitate connections between different branches of mathematics. [[Category theory]] is one area of mathematics dedicated to exploring this commonality of structure as it plays out in some areas of math.

Generality's impact on [[intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] is both dependent on the subject and a matter of personal preference or learning style.  Often generality is seen as a hindrance to intuition, although it can certainly function as an aid to it, especially when it provides analogies to material for which one already has good intuition.

As a prime example of generality, the [[Erlangen program]] involved an expansion of [[geometry]] to accommodate [[non-Euclidean geometries]] as well as the field of [[topology]], and other forms of geometry, by viewing geometry as the study of a space together with a [[Group (mathematics)|group]] of transformations.  The study of [[number]]s, called [[algebra]] at the beginning undergraduate level, extends to [[abstract algebra]] at a more advanced level; and the study of [[function (mathematics)|function]]s, called [[calculus]] at the college freshman level becomes [[mathematical analysis]] and [[functional analysis]] at a more advanced level.  Each of these branches of more ''abstract'' mathematics have many sub-specialties, and there are in fact many connections between pure mathematics and applied mathematics disciplines. A steep rise in [[abstraction]] was seen mid 20th century.

In practice, however, these developments led to a sharp divergence from [[physics]], particularly from 1950 to 1983. Later this was criticised, for example by [[Vladimir Arnold]], as too much [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]], not enough [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]]. The point does not yet seem to be settled, in that [[string theory]] pulls one way, while [[discrete mathematics]] pulls back towards proof as central.

==Purism==
Mathematicians have always had differing opinions regarding the distinction between pure and applied mathematics. 
One of the most famous (but perhaps misunderstood) modern examples of this debate can be found in [[G.H. Hardy]]'s ''[[A Mathematician's Apology]]''.

It is widely believed that Hardy considered applied mathematics to be ugly and dull. Although it is true that Hardy preferred pure mathematics, which he often compared to [[painting]] and [[poetry]], Hardy saw the distinction between pure and applied mathematics to be simply that applied mathematics sought to express ''physical'' truth in a mathematical framework, whereas pure mathematics expressed truths that were independent of the physical world. Hardy made a separate distinction in mathematics between what he called "real" mathematics, "which has permanent aesthetic value", and "the dull and elementary parts of mathematics" that have practical use.

Hardy considered some physicists, such as [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]], and [[Paul Dirac|Dirac]], to be among the "real" mathematicians, but at the time that he was writing the ''Apology'' he also considered [[general relativity]] and [[quantum mechanics]] to be "useless", which allowed him to hold the opinion that only "dull" mathematics was useful. Moreover, Hardy briefly admitted that—just as the application of [[matrix theory]] and [[group theory]] to physics had come unexpectedly—the time may come where some kinds of beautiful, "real" mathematics may be useful as well.

Another insightful view is offered by Magid:
{{quote|I've always thought that a good model here could be drawn from ring theory. In that subject, one has the subareas of [[commutative ring|commutative ring theory]] and [[non-commutative ring|non-commutative ring theory]]. An uninformed observer might think that these represent a dichotomy, but in fact the latter subsumes the former: a non-commutative ring is a not-necessarily-commutative ring. If we use similar conventions, then we could refer to applied mathematics and nonapplied mathematics, where by the latter we ''mean not-necessarily-applied mathematics''... [emphasis added]&lt;ref name=Magid&gt;[[Andy Magid]] (November 2005) [http://www.ams.org/notices/200510/commentary.pdf Letter from the Editor], [[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]], page 1173&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Subfields==
[[Mathematical analysis|Analysis]] is concerned with the properties of functions. It deals with concepts such as [[continuous function|continuity]], [[limit of a function|limits]], [[derivative|differentiation]] and [[integral|integration]], thus providing a rigorous foundation for the [[calculus]] of infinitesimals introduced by Newton and Leibniz in the 17th century. [[Real analysis]] studies functions of real numbers, while [[complex analysis]] extends the aforementioned concepts to functions of complex numbers.  [[Functional analysis]] is a branch of analysis that studies infinite-dimensional vector spaces and views functions as points in these spaces.

[[Abstract algebra]] is not to be confused with the manipulation of formulae that is covered in secondary education. It studies [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] together with [[binary operations]] defined on them. Sets and their binary operations may be classified according to their properties: for instance, if an operation is [[associative]] on a set that contains an identity element and inverses for each member of the set, the set and operation is considered to be a [[group (mathematics)|group]]. Other structures include [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[field (mathematics)|fields]], [[vector spaces]] and [[Lattice (group)|lattices]].

[[Geometry]] is the study of shapes and space, in particular, groups of transformations that act on spaces. For example, [[projective geometry]] is about the group of projective transformations that act on the real projective plane, whereas [[inversive geometry]] is concerned with the group of inversive transformations acting on the extended complex plane.

[[Number theory]] is the theory of the positive [[integers]]. It is based on ideas such as divisibility and [[modular arithmetic|congruence]]. Its [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic|fundamental theorem]] states that each positive integer has a unique prime factorization. In some ways it is the most accessible discipline in pure mathematics for the general public: for instance the [[Goldbach conjecture]] is easily stated (but is yet to be proved or disproved). In other ways it is the least accessible discipline; for example, Wiles' proof that Fermat's equation has no nontrivial solutions requires understanding [[automorphic forms]], which though intrinsic to nature have not found a place in physics or the general public discourse.

[[Topology]] is a modern extension of Geometry. Rather than focusing on the sizes of objects and their precise measurement, topology involves the properties of spaces or objects that are preserved under smooth operations such as bending or twisting (but not, for example, tearing or shearing). Topology's subfields interact with other branches of pure math: traditional topology uses ideas from [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]], such as metric spaces, and [[algebraic topology]] relies on ideas from [[combinatorics]] in addition to those of analysis.

[[Combinatorics]] is a branch of mathematics concerning the study of finite or countable discrete structures. It also interacts with many other areas of mathematics. For example, additive combinatorics is related to [[number theory]] and [[analysis]], and [[graph theory]] comes from [[topology]].

{{Bertrand Russell}}

'''Russell's teapot''' is an [[analogy]], formulated by the philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] (1872–1970), to illustrate that the [[philosophic burden of proof]] lies upon a person making [[Falsifiability|unfalsifiable]] claims, rather than shifting the burden of ''disproof'' to others.  

Russell specifically applied his analogy in the context of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Allhoff, Scott C. Lowe. ''The Philosophical Case Against Literal Truth: Russell's Teapot // Christmas - Philosophy for Everyone: Better Than a Lump of Coal''. — John Wiley and Sons, 2010. — Т. 5. — P. 65-66. — 256 p. — (Philosophy for Everyone). — {{ISBN|9781444330908}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that if he were to assert, without offering proof, that a [[teapot]], too small to be seen by telescopes, orbits the Sun somewhere in space between the Earth and Mars, he could not expect anyone to believe him solely because his assertion could not be proven wrong. 

Russell's teapot is still invoked in discussions concerning the [[existence of God]], and has had influence in various fields and media.

== Description ==
In an article titled "Is There a God?" commissioned, but never published, by ''Illustrated'' magazine in 1952, Russell wrote:

{{quote|Many orthodox people speak as though it were the business of sceptics to disprove received dogmas rather than of dogmatists to prove them. This is, of course, a mistake. If I were to suggest that between the Earth and Mars there is a china teapot revolving about the sun in an elliptical orbit, nobody would be able to disprove my assertion provided I were careful to add that the teapot is too small to be revealed even by our most powerful telescopes. But if I were to go on to say that, since my assertion cannot be disproved, it is intolerable presumption on the part of human reason to doubt it, I should rightly be thought to be talking nonsense. If, however, the existence of such a teapot were affirmed in ancient books, taught as the sacred truth every Sunday, and instilled into the minds of children at school, hesitation to believe in its existence would become a mark of eccentricity and entitle the doubter to the attentions of the psychiatrist in an enlightened age or of the Inquisitor in an earlier time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Is There a God? [1952]|editor-first=John G.|editor-last=Slater|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|authorlink=Bertrand Russell|title=The Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell, Vol. 11: Last Philosophical Testament, 1943–68|year=1952|url=http://russell.mcmaster.ca/cpbr11p69.pdf|publisher=[[Routledge]]|pages=542–548|isbn=9780415094092}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

In 1958, Russell elaborated on the analogy:

{{quote|I ought to call myself an agnostic; but, for all practical purposes, I am an atheist. I do not think the existence of the Christian God any more probable than the existence of the [[Ancient Greek religion|Gods of Olympus]] or [[Norse religion|Valhalla]]. To take another illustration: nobody can prove that there is not between the Earth and Mars a china teapot revolving in an elliptical orbit, but nobody thinks this sufficiently likely to be taken into account in practice. I think the Christian God just as unlikely.&lt;ref name="garvey"&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Brian |last=Garvey |title=Absence of Evidence, Evidence of Absence, and the Atheist's Teapot |journal=[[Ars Disputandi]] |year=2010 |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=9–22 |doi=10.1080/15665399.2010.10820011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

== Analysis ==
Chemist [[Peter Atkins]] said that the point of Russell's teapot is that there is no burden on anyone to disprove assertions. [[Occam's razor]] suggests that the simpler theory with fewer assertions (e.g., a universe with no supernatural beings) should be the starting point in the discussion rather than the more complex theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=The Oxford Handbook of Religion and Science|editor=Clayton, Philip|editor2=Simpson, Zachary R.|first=Peter|last=Atkins|authorlink=Peter Atkins|contribution=Atheism and science|pages=129–130 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-WhGyYy0SIoC|accessdate=2016-03-03|isbn=9780199279272|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, philosopher [[Paul Chamberlain]] says it is logically erroneous to assert that positive truth claims bear a burden of proof while negative truth claims do not.&lt;ref name="chamberlain"&gt;{{cite book |first=Paul |last=Chamberlain|title=Why People Don't Believe: Confronting Six Challenges to Christian Faith|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2AdNgqzawLAC&amp;pg=PA82 |year=2011|publisher=Baker Books|isbn=978-1-4412-3209-0|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; He says that all truth claims bear a burden of proof, and that like [[Mother Goose]] and the [[tooth fairy]], the teapot bears the greater burden not because of its negativity, but because of its triviality, arguing that "When we substitute normal, serious characters such as Plato, Nero, Winston Churchill, or George Washington in place of these fictional characters, it becomes clear that anyone denying the existence of these figures has a burden of proof equal to, or in some cases greater than, the person claiming they do exist."&lt;ref name="chamberlain"/&gt;

In his books ''[[A Devil's Chaplain]]'' (2003) and ''[[The God Delusion]]'' (2006), geneticist [[Richard Dawkins]] used the teapot as an analogy of an argument against what he termed "agnostic conciliation", a policy of intellectual appeasement that allows for philosophical domains that concern exclusively religious matters.&lt;ref name="devchap"&gt;{{cite book | title = A Devil's Chaplain: Reflections on Hope, Lies, Science, and Love | authorlink = Richard Dawkins | first = Richard | last = Dawkins | publisher = [[Houghton Mifflin]] | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-0-618-33540-4 | title-link = A Devil's Chaplain | chapter = The Great Convergence | pages = 146-151 | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nBRYZtOuqZcC&amp;pg=PA146 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Science has no way of establishing the existence or non-existence of a god. Therefore, according to the agnostic conciliator, because it is a matter of individual taste, belief and disbelief in a supreme being are deserving of equal respect and attention. Dawkins presents the teapot as a ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' of this position: if agnosticism demands giving equal respect to the belief and disbelief in a supreme being, then it must also give equal respect to belief in an orbiting teapot, since the existence of an orbiting teapot is just as plausible scientifically as the existence of a supreme being.&lt;ref name = "goddel"&gt;{{cite book | title = The God Delusion | first = Richard | last = Dawkins | authorlink = Richard Dawkins | publisher = [[Random House]] | year = 2016 | edition = 10th Anniversary | isbn = 9781784161934 | title-link = The God Delusion | chapter = The Poverty of Agnosticism | pages = 69-77 | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=emE7DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher Brian Garvey argues that the teapot analogy fails with regard to religion because, with the teapot, the believer and non-believer are simply disagreeing about one item in the universe and may hold in common all other beliefs about the universe, which is not true of an atheist and a theist.&lt;ref name="garvey"/&gt; Garvey argues that it is not a matter of the theist propounding existence of a thing and the atheist simply denying it – each is asserting an alternative explanation of why the cosmos exists and is the way it is: "the atheist is not just denying an existence that the theist affirms – the atheist is in addition committed to the view that the universe is not the way it is because of God. It is either the way it is because of something other than God, or there is no reason it is the way it is."&lt;ref name="garvey"/&gt;

Philosopher [[Peter van Inwagen]] argues that while Russell's teapot is a fine piece of rhetoric, its logical argument form is less than clear, and attempting to make it clear reveals that the Teapot Argument is very far from cogent.&lt;ref name = "Epistemology"&gt;{{cite book | title = The Right to Believe: Perspectives in Religious Epistemology | editor1-first = Dariusz | editor1-last = Łukasiewicz | editor2-first = Roger | editor2-last = Pouivet | first = Peter | last = van Inwagen | authorlink = Peter van Inwagen | chapter = Russell's China Teapot | pages = 11-26 | publisher = [[Ontos Verlag]] | location = Frankfurt | year = 2012 | isbn = 9783110320169 | url = https://books.google.com.au/books?id=bmyK32rqKf0C&amp;pg=PA11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another philosopher, [[Alvin Plantinga]] states that a falsehood lies at the heart of Russell's argument. Russell's argument assumes that there is no evidence against the teapot, but Plantinga disagrees:

{{quote|Clearly we have a great deal of evidence against teapotism. For example, as far as we know, the only way a teapot could have gotten into orbit around the sun would be if some country with sufficiently developed space-shot capabilities had shot this pot into orbit. No country with such capabilities is sufficiently frivolous to waste its resources by trying to send a teapot into orbit. Furthermore, if some country had done so, it would have been all over the news; we would certainly have heard about it. But we haven't. And so on. There is plenty of evidence against teapotism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last = Gutting|first = Gary|authorlink = Gary Gutting|date = February 9, 2014|newspaper = [[The New York Times]]|url = http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/is-atheism-irrational/|title = Is Atheism Irrational?|accessdate = July 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Philosopher [[Gary Gutting]] rejects Russell's teapot for similar reasons, arguing that Russell's argument accords theism far less support than it actually has. Gutting points out that numerous sensible, competent people appeal to personal experience and arguments in support of God's existence. Thus, to simply reject the existence of God, out of hand, seems unjustified, according to Gutting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/11/on-dawkinss-atheism-a-response|date = August 11, 2010|accessdate = November 27, 2018|newspaper = [[The New York Times]]|title = On Dawkins's Atheism: A Response|first = Gary|last = Gutting|authorlink = Gary Gutting}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The literary critic [[James Wood (critic)|James Wood]], without believing in God, says that belief in God "is a good deal more reasonable than belief in a teapot" because God is a "grand and big idea" which "is not analogically disproved by reference to celestial teapots or vacuum cleaners, which lack the necessary bigness and grandeur" and "because God cannot be [[Reification (fallacy)|reified]], cannot be turned into a mere thing".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=James|last=Wood|authorlink=James Wood (critic)|title=The Celestial Teapot|journal=[[The New Republic]]|date=18 December 2006|issue=27|url=http://www.tnr.com/article/the-celestial-teapot|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One counter-argument, advanced by philosopher Eric Reitan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first = Eric |last=Reitan |title=Contributors |publisher=Religion Dispatches |url=http://www.religiondispatches.org/contributors/ericreitan/}}&lt;/ref&gt; is that belief in God is different from belief in a teapot because teapots are physical and therefore in principle verifiable, and that given what we know about the physical world we have no good reason to think that belief in Russell's teapot is justified and at least some reason to think it not.&lt;ref name=Reitan&gt;{{cite book | title = Is God a Delusion? |first = Eric |last=Reitan|publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | date = 2008 | media_type = | pages = 78–80 | isbn = 978-1-4051-8361-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Similar analogies ==
Other thinkers have posited non-disprovable analogies, such as [[J. B. Bury]] in his 1913 book, ''History of Freedom of Thought'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Some people speak as if we were not justified in rejecting a theological doctrine unless we can prove it false. But the burden of proof does not lie upon the rejecter.... If you were told that in a certain planet revolving around Sirius there is a race of donkeys who speak the English language and spend their time in discussing eugenics, you could not disprove the statement, but would it, on that account, have any claim to be believed? Some minds would be prepared to accept it, if it were reiterated often enough, through the potent force of suggestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= History of Freedom of Thought|edition= Illustrated Edition, published 2014 by [[Lulu Press, Inc.]]|isbn= 9781304988607 |last= Bury|first= John Bagnall|authorlink= J.

[[Astronomer]] [[Carl Sagan]] in his 1995 book ''[[The Demon-Haunted World]]'' offered a similar non-disprovable analogy called the Dragon in the Garage as an example of skeptical thinking. If Sagan claimed there was a dragon in his garage, you would wish to verify it for yourself but if Sagan's dragon was impossible to detect:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Now, what's the difference between an invisible, incorporeal, floating dragon who spits heatless fire and no dragon at all? If there's no way to disprove my contention, no conceivable experiment that would count against it, what does it mean to say that my dragon exists?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sagan|first1=Carl|authorlink=Carl Sagan|title=The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark|date=1995|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=9780394535128|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ybvaAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=editions:r7NWYii6Wt0C|accessdate=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Sandra Laing''' (born 1955) is a [[South Africa]]n woman who was classified as [[coloureds|coloured]] by authorities during the [[apartheid]] era, due to her skin colour and hair texture, although she was the child of at least three generations of ancestors who had been regarded as [[White_South_African|white]]. At the age of 10, she was expelled from her all-white school, and the authorities' decisions based on her appearance disrupted her family and adult life.

Laing was the subject of the 2008 biographical dramatic film ''[[Skin (2008 film)|Skin]]'', directed by Anthony Fabian, which won numerous awards.&lt;ref name="Skin movie official website"&gt;[http://www.skinthemovie.net ''Skin'' movie official website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=M&amp;Greview&gt;[http://www.mg.co.za/multimedia/2010-01-21-iskini-movie-review ''Skin'' film review], ''Mail &amp; Guardian'', 21 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, she is the subject of the documentaries ''In Search of Sandra Laing'' (1977), directed by [[Antony Thomas|Anthony Thomas]] for the [[BBC]], which was banned by the apartheid government of the time,&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;
[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2944922.stm "Black Afrikaner" story to become film], BBC News, 29 May 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sandra Laing: A Spiritual Journey'' (2000), and ''Skin Deep: The Story of Sandra Laing'' (2009).

==Early life==
Sandra Laing was born in 1955 to Sannie and Abraham Laing, [[Afrikaner]]s in [[Piet Retief, Mpumalanga|Piet Retief]], a small conservative town in South Africa during the [[apartheid]] era, when laws governed officially established social castes of racial classification. She had darker skin than other members of her family, which seemed to become more obvious as she grew older. Her parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents were all white, but Sandra displayed the physiognomy of African ancestors of earlier generations, perhaps from the 18th century or more recent.&lt;ref name="carroll"/&gt; Her family treated her as white, the same as their sons Adriaan and Leon, and together they all attended the Dutch Reformed Church.&lt;ref name="carroll"/&gt;

When Laing was 10 years old and at an all-white boarding school, the school authorities expelled her&lt;ref name="carroll"/&gt; because of complaints from the parents of other students, based on her appearance: primarily her skin colour and the texture of her hair. They believed she was "coloured", a term for mixed-race people.&lt;ref name=under&gt;{{cite news|title=Apartheid got under her skin|author=Kim Hawkey|date=10 January 2010|work=Sunday Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was expelled and escorted home by two police officers.&lt;ref name="carroll"/&gt;

Sandra's parents fought several legal battles to have her classified as white, based on her documented ancestry through them. Her father underwent a blood-typing test for [[DNA paternity testing|paternity]] in the 1960s, as [[DNA tests]] were not yet available. The results were compatible with his being her biological father, though such tests are extremely imprecise due to the small number of blood types that most people have.&lt;ref name="carroll"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2003/mar/17/features11.g2|title=The black woman - with white parents|author=[[Rory Carroll]]|publisher=''The Guardian''|accessdate=17 March 2003|location=London|date=17 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1093674/The-tragic-story-white-girl-born-black-tore-family-apart.html|title=The Tragic Story of How a White Girl Being Born Black Tore a Family Apart|work=The Daily Mail|accessdate=16 August 2011|location=London|date=19 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
After the publicity, Laing found herself shunned by the white community, although she was re-classified as white again in 1966 when the law was changed to allow a person to be classified as white if both parents are classified as white. She attended a coloured boarding school away from her family and became immersed in the non-white world. Her only friends were the children of black employees. At the age of 16, Laing eloped to [[Swaziland]] with Petrus Zwane, a black South African who spoke Zulu. She was jailed for three months for illegal border-crossing. Her father threatened to kill her for the marriage and broke off contact with her. They never met again.&lt;ref name="carroll"/&gt;

Although she and her husband had two children, who were classified as "coloured", she was threatened with losing them unless she also was classified as "coloured", as a white parent could not raise coloured children. At the age of 26, she arranged for the change in race classification officially, although her father had refused permission earlier. Except for secret trips to see her mother when her father was out of the house, Laing was estranged from her family and struggled to survive economically.&lt;ref name="carroll"/&gt; When her parents moved away from Piet Retief, the clandestine visits were no longer possible. Laing lost contact with her family completely. {{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Laing and her husband separated due to the pressures they were under, and she put their children into government care for a period. Years later she married again, to Johannes Motloung, a Sotho-speaking man. They had three children together and she was able to reclaim her first two; all are now grown and with families of their own. Trying to reconcile with her family in the 1980s, Laing learned that her father had died and her mother Sannie refused to see her.&lt;ref name="carroll"/&gt;

In 2000 the ''[[Johannesburg Times]]'' tracked down Laing to learn about her years since the end of apartheid. The newspaper helped her find her mother, and they were able to reconcile. Sannie was then in a nursing home. Sannie and the two shared time together before her mother's death in 2001.&lt;ref name="carroll"/&gt;

The publicity helped Laing, her husband and family gain new housing; they now live in Leachville, new estates east of Johannesburg. In 2009, it was reported that Laing's brothers still refused to see her.&lt;ref name="little"/&gt; She has said in interviews with ''[[The Guardian]]'' and ''Little White Lies'' that she continued to hope they would some day have a change of heart.&lt;ref name="carroll"/&gt;&lt;ref name="little"&gt;[http://www.littlewhitelies.co.uk/features/articles/sandra-laing-6079 Sophie Ivan, "Sandra Laing: profile and photo"], ''Little White Lies'', 24 July 2009, accessed 6 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Representation in other media==
Documentary films have been made about Laing: 
* ''In Search of Sandra Laing'' (1977), BBC, directed by Anthony Thomas (released during the apartheid era, this film was banned from distribution in South Africa)
* ''Sandra Laing: A Spiritual Journey'' (2000)
* ''Skin Deep: The Story of Sandra Laing'' (2009)
and a dramatic film:
* ''[[Skin (2008 film)|Skin]]'' (2008) based on Laing's life story, directed by [[Anthony Fabian]] and starring [[Sam Neill]], [[Alice Krige]], and [[Sophie Okonedo]].&lt;ref name="Skin movie official website"/&gt;&lt;ref name=M&amp;Greview /&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20662">A '''social skill''' is any [[social competence|competence]] facilitating [[Interpersonal relationship|interaction]] and [[Social Communication|communication]] with others where [[social rule]]s and [[Interpersonal relationship|relations]] are created, communicated, and changed in [[Language|verbal]] and nonverbal ways. The process of learning these skills is called [[socialization]]. For socialization, interpersonal skills are essential to relate to one another. Interpersonal skills are the interpersonal acts a person uses to interact with others, which are related to dominance vs. submission, love vs. hate, affiliation vs. aggression, and control vs. autonomy categories (Leary, 1957). Positive interpersonal skills include [[persuasion]], [[active listening]], [[delegation]], and [[stewardship]], among others. A healthy Social interest ([[wikt:Gemeinschaftsgefühl|Gemeinschaftsgefühl]]) that involves more than being in a group is required for well-adjusted social skills. [[Social psychology]] is the academic discipline that does research related to social skills and studies how skills are learned by an individual through changes in attitude, thinking, and behavior.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==Enumeration and categorization==
Social skills are the tools that enable people to communicate, learn, ask for help, get needs met in appropriate ways, get along with others, make friends, develop healthy relationships, protect themselves, and in general, be able to interact with the society harmoniously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FTpYF4okJbAC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Teaching Social Skills to Youth: A Step-by-step Guide to 182 Basic to Complex Skills Plus Helpful Teaching Techniques|first1=Tom P.|last1=Dowd|first2=Jeff|last2=Tierney|date=8 October 2017|publisher=Boys Town Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9781889322698}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social skills build essential character traits like trustworthiness, respectfulness, responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship. These traits help build an internal moral compass, allowing individuals to make good choices in thinking and behavior, resulting in social competence.

The important social skills identified by the [[Employment and Training Administration]] are:{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}
* Coordination – Adjusting actions in relation to others' actions.
* Mentoring – Teaching and helping others how to do something (e.g. a study partner).
* Negotiation – Discussion aimed at reaching an agreement. 
* Persuasion – The action or fact of persuading someone or of being persuaded to do or believe something. 
* Service Orientation – Actively looking for ways to evolve compassionately and grow psycho-socially with people.
* Social Perceptiveness – Being aware of others' reactions and able to respond in an understanding manner.

Social skills are goal oriented with both main goals and sub-goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.popstoolkit.com/riskmanagement/module/step2/goalsetting.aspx|title=Goal Setting - Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) Toolkit|website=www.popstoolkit.com|access-date=2017-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a workplace interaction initiated by a new employee with a senior employee will first contain a main goal. This will gather information, and then the sub-goal will be to establish a rapport in order to obtain the main goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.popstoolkit.com/riskmanagement/module/step2/subgoals.aspx|title=Sub-goals - Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) Toolkit|access-date=2017-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Takeo Doi in his study of consciousness distinguished this as ''tutemae'', meaning conventions and verbal expressions and ''honne'', meaning true motive behind the conventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Takeo Doi|title=The Anatomy of Self: The Individual Versus Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=thrgxooX93oC|year=2001|publisher=Kodansha International|isbn=978-4-7700-2779-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes of deficits==
Deficits in social skills were categorized by Gresham in 1998, as failure to recognize and reflect social skills, a failure to model appropriate models, and failure to perform acceptable behavior in particular situations in relation to developmental and transitional stages.&lt;ref&gt;Teaching Social Skills to Youth, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Social skill deficits are also a discouragement for children with behavioral challenges when it comes to adult adjustment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schloss|first=Partrick J.|last2=Schloss|first2=Cynthia N.|last3=Wood|first3=Constance E.|last4=Kiehl|first4=Wendy S.|date=1986|title=A Critical Review of Social Skills Research with Behaviorally Disordered Students|jstor=23882274|journal=Behavioral Disorders|volume=12|issue=1|pages=1–14|doi=10.2307/23882274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alcohol===
Social skills are significantly impaired in people suffering from [[alcoholism]].{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} This is due to the neurotoxic [[effects of alcohol]] on the brain, especially the [[prefrontal cortex]] area of the brain.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} The social skills that are impaired by [[alcohol abuse]], include impairments in perceiving facial emotions, [[Semantic prosody|prosody]] perception problems, and [[theory of mind]] deficits.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} The ability to understand humor is also impaired in alcohol abusers.&lt;ref name="pmid18412750"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Uekermann J, Daum I |title=Social cognition in alcoholism: a link to prefrontal cortex dysfunction? |journal=Addiction |volume=103 |issue=5 |pages=726–35 |date=May 2008 |pmid=18412750 |doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2008.02157.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Impairments in social skills can also occur in individuals who suffer from [[fetal alcohol spectrum disorder]]s. These deficits persist throughout the affected people's lives, and may worsen over time due to the effects of aging on the brain.&lt;ref name="Kully-Martens-2012"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Kully-Martens | first1 = K. | last2 = Denys | first2 = K. | last3 = Treit | first3 = S. | last4 = Tamana | first4 = S. | last5 = Rasmussen | first5 = C. | title = A review of social skills deficits in individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and prenatal alcohol exposure: profiles, mechanisms, and interventions. | journal = Alcohol Clin Exp Res | volume = 36 | issue = 4 | pages = 568–76 |date=Apr 2012 | doi = 10.1111/j.1530-0277.2011.01661.x | PMID = 22017360 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ADHD and hyperkinetic disorder===
People with [[ADHD]] and [[hyperkinetic disorder]]&lt;ref name=Banaschewski&amp;Rohde&gt;{{cite book|year=2009|editor1-last= Banaschewski |editor1-first= Tobias|editor2-last=Coghill|editor2-first= David |editor3-last= Danckaerts|editor3-first= Marina|isbn=9780191576010|title=Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Hyperkinetic Disorder|publisher=OUP |location=Oxford, UK|first1=Tobias|last1=Banaschewski|first2=Louis|last2=Rohde|chapter= Phenomenology|pages=3–18|url=http://www.books.google.com/books?id=LQRUM5v_N1IC}}&lt;/ref&gt; often have difficulties with social skills, such as social interaction. Approximately half of ADHD children and adolescents will experience peer rejection, compared to 10–15 percent of non-ADHD youth. Adolescents with ADHD are less likely to develop close friendships and romantic relationships; they are usually regarded by their peers as immature or as social outcasts, with an exception for peers that have ADHD or related disorders themselves, or a high level of tolerance for such symptoms. As they begin to mature, however, it becomes easier to make such relationships. Training in social skills, behavioral modification, and medication have some beneficial effects. It is important for ADHD youth to form friendships with people who are not involved in deviant/delinquent activities and/or significant mental illness/developmental disabilities  in order to reducing emergence of later psychopathology. Poor peer relationships can contribute to [[major depression]], [[criminality]], school failure, and [[substance use disorder]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid20490677"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mikami AY |title=The importance of friendship for youth with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder |journal=Clin Child Fam Psychol Rev |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=181–98 |date=June 2010 |pmid=20490677 |pmc=2921569 |doi=10.1007/s10567-010-0067-y }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18822833"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Coleman WL |title=Social competence and friendship formation in adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder |journal=Adolesc Med State Art Rev |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=278–99, x |date=August 2008 |pmid=18822833 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Romantic relationships are usually difficult in the adolescent and college age because of the lack of attention of non verbal cues such as flirting gestures, tone of voice, which may include misinterpretation if whether the person is romantically attracted to that person, along with the impulsiveness of "jumping into" relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, E. "Helping Teens with ADHD Foster Romantic Relationships." Health Central. 11 Feb 2013. Retrieved on 13 Mar 2018.https://www.healthcentral.com/article/helping-teens-with-adhd-foster-romantic-relationships&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autism===
People with [[autistic spectrum disorders]] are often deficient in social skills. This is most likely the result of the lack of [[theory of mind]], which enables the person to understand other people's [[emotion]]s.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} The concept of social skills has been questioned in terms of autistic spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond G. Romanczyk, Sara White, and Jennifer M. Gillis (2005): Social Skills Versus Skilled Social Behavior: A Problematic Distinction in Autism Spectrum Disorders. ''Journal of Early and Intensive Behavior Intervention 2 (3),'' pp. 177–94 [http://www.baojournal.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In response for the needs of children with [[autism]], Romanczyk has suggested for adapting comprehensive model of social acquisitions with behavioral modification rather than specific responses tailored for social contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2014-52008-006.pdf|author=Romanczyk, R. G.|author2=White, S.|author3=Gillis, J.

===Anxiety and depression===
Individuals with few opportunities to socialize with others often struggle with social skills. This can often create a downward spiral effect for people with mental illnesses like anxiety or depression. Due to [[Social anxiety|anxiety]] experienced from concerns with interpersonal evaluation and fear of negative reaction by others, surfeit expectations of failure or social rejection in socialization leads to avoiding or shutting down from social interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/theory-knowledge/201604/the-behavioral-shutdown-theory-depression|title=The Behavioral Shutdown Theory of Depression|author=Gregg Henriques|date=2016-04-03|work=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who experience significant levels of social anxiety often struggle when communicating with others, and may have impaired abilities to demonstrate social cues and behaviors appropriately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Angélico |first1= Antonio Paulo |last2= Crippa |first2= José Alexandre S. | last3= Louriero | first3= Sonia Regina | date= 2013 |title= Social Anxiety Disorder and Social Skills: A Critical Review of the Literature  |url= http://content.ebscohost.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&amp;P=AN&amp;K=89136226&amp;S=R&amp;D=asn&amp;EbscoContent=dGJyMNHX8kSeprU4zdnyOLCmr0%2Bep7NSsa64TLCWxWXS&amp;ContentCustomer=dGJyMPPt6nnhset55%2BS5febl8YwA  |journal= International Journal of Behavioral Consultation and Therapy |volume= 7 |issue= 4 |pages= 16–33 |doi= |access-date= 2017-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depression can also cause people to avoid opportunities to socialize, which impairs their social skills, and makes socialization unattractive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Depression, Social Skills are Linked|url=http://web.sbs.arizona.edu/college/news/depression-poor-social-skills-are-linked|publisher=University of Arizona|accessdate=2013-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anti-social behaviors ===
{{Main|Psychopathy in the workplace||Narcissism in the workplace|Anti-social behaviour}}

The authors of the book ''[[Snakes in Suits: When Psychopaths Go to Work]]'' explore psychopathy in workplace. The FBI consultants describe a five phase model of how a typical [[psychopath]] climbs to and maintains [[Power (social and political)|power]]. Many traits exhibited by these individuals include: [[superficial charm]], insincerity, egocentricity, manipulativeness, grandiosity, lack of empathy, low on agreeableness, exploitativeness, independence, rigidity, stubbornness and dictatorial tendencies. Babiak and Hare say for corporate psychopaths, success is defined as the best revenge and their problem behaviors are repeated "ad infinitum" due to little insight and their proto-emotions such as "anger, frustration, and rage" is [[Impression management|refracted]] as irresistible charm. The authors note that lack of [[emotional literacy]] and moral conscience is often confused with toughness, the ''ability'' to make hard decisions, and ''effective'' crisis management. Babiak and Hare also emphasizes a reality they identified with psychopaths from studies that psychopaths are not able to be influenced by any sort of therapy.&lt;ref name=Snakes&gt;Baibak, P; [[Robert D. Hare|Hare, R. D]] [[Snakes in Suits: When Psychopaths Go to Work]] (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/archive/news/snakes-in-suits-when-psychopaths-go-to-work/story-e6frg8no-1111112236244|title=Snakes In Suits: When Psychopaths Go To Work|date=22 September 2006|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the University at Buffalo in New York, Emily Grijalva has investigated [[narcissism]] in business; she found there are two forms of narcissism: "vulnerable" and "[[grandiose]]".&lt;ref name="Haycock2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dean A. Haycock|title=Murderous Minds: Exploring the Criminal Psychopathic Brain: Neurological Imaging and the Manifestation of Evil|chapter=Successful, Unsuccessful, and Other Types of Psychopaths|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mQ_UAgAAQBAJ|date=4 March 2014|publisher=Pegasus Books|isbn=978-1-4804-4798-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is her finding that "moderate" level of grandiose narcissism is linked to becoming an effective manager. Grandiose narcissists are characterized as confident; they possess unshakable belief that they are superior, even when it's unwarranted. They can be charming, pompous show-offs, and can also be selfish, exploitative and entitled.&lt;ref&gt;Emily Grijalva, [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270220807_Gender_Differences_in_Narcissism_A_Meta-Analytic_Review Gender Differences in Narcissism: A Meta-Analytic Review], Psychological Bulletin, December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Jens Lange and Jan Crusius at the University of Cologne, Germany associates "malicious-benign" envy within narcissistic social climbers in workplace. It is their finding that grandiose narcissists are less prone to low self-esteem and neuroticism and are less susceptible to the anxiety and depression that can affect vulnerable narcissists when coupled with envy. They characterize vulnerable narcissists as those who "believe they are special, and want to be seen that way–but are just not that competent, or charming." As a result, their self-esteem fluctuates a lot. They tend to be self-conscious and passive, but also prone to outbursts of potentially violent aggression if their inflated self-image is threatened."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cengagesites.com/academic/assets/sites/schultz_ch04.pdf|title=Theory of Neurotic Needs|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Boyatzis]] says this is an unproductive form of expression of emotions that the person can’t share constructively, which reflects lack of appropriate skills.&lt;ref&gt;HBR's 10 Must Reads on Collaboration&lt;/ref&gt; Eddie Brummelman, a social and behavioral scientist at the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands and Brad Bushman at Ohio State University in Columbus says studies show that in western culture narcissism is on the rise from shifting focus on the self rather than on relationships and concludes all narcissism to be socially undesirable ("unhealthy feelings of superiority"). David Kealy at the University of British Columbia in Canada states that narcissism might aid temporarily but in the long run it is better to be true to oneself, have personal integrity, and be kind to others.&lt;ref&gt;New Scientist Magazine, 9 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==

===Behavior therapy===
{{Main|Behaviorism}}
To behaviorists, social skills are learned behaviors that allow people to achieve social [[reinforcement]]. According to Schneider &amp; Byrne (1985), who conducted a meta-analysis of social skills training procedures (51 studies), [[operant conditioning]] procedures for training social skills had the largest effect size, followed by [[observational learning|modeling]], coaching, and social cognitive techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, B.H. &amp; Byrne, B.M. (1985). Children's social skills training: A meta-analysis. In B.H. Schneider, K. Rubin, &amp; J.E. Ledingham (Eds.) Children's Peer relations: Issues in assessment and intervention (pp. 175–90). New York: Springer-Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; Behavior analysts prefer to use the term behavioral skills to social skills.&lt;ref name="baojournal2003"&gt;O'Donohue, W. (2003). Psychological Skills Training: Issues and Controversies. ''The Behavior Analyst Today, 4 (3),'' 331–35 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO].&lt;/ref&gt; Behavioral skills training to build social and other skills is used with a variety of populations including in packages to treat addictions as in the [[community reinforcement approach and family training]] (CRAFT).&lt;ref&gt;Jane Ellen Smith, Jaime L. Milford, and Robert J. Meyers (2004): CRA and CRAFT: Behavioral Approaches to Treating Substance-Abusing Individuals&amp;nbsp;– The Behavior Analyst Today, 5.(4), pp. 391–404 [http://www.baojournal.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Training of behavioral skills is also used for people who suffer from [[borderline personality disorder]],&lt;ref&gt;Sampl, S. Wakai, S., Trestman, R. and Keeney, E.M. (2008).

The rationale for this type of approach to treatment is that people meet a variety of social problems and can reduce the stress and punishment from the encounter in a safe environment. It also addresses how they can increase reinforcement by having the correct skills.

'''Strangling''' is compression of the neck that may lead to [[unconsciousness]] or [[death]] by causing an increasingly [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxic]] state in the brain.&lt;ref name=ernoehazy&gt;Ernoehazy, William; Ernoehazy, WS. [http://www.emedicine.com/emerg/topic227.htm Hanging Injuries and Strangulation]. ''www.emedicine.com''. URL last accessed March 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Fatal strangling typically occurs in cases of violence, accidents, and is one of two main ways that [[hanging]] causes death (alongside breaking the victim's neck).

Strangling does not have to be fatal; limited or interrupted strangling is practised in [[erotic asphyxia]], in the [[choking game]], and is an important technique in many [[combat sport]]s and [[self-defence]] systems. 
Strangling can be divided into three general types according to the mechanism used:&lt;ref name=strack&gt;Strack, Gael; McClane, George.

==General==
[[Image:Gray513.png|thumb|left|200 px|The neck contains several vulnerable targets for compression including the [[carotid arteries]].]]
Strangling involves one or several mechanisms that interfere with the normal flow of [[oxygen]] into the brain:&lt;ref name=jones&gt;Jones, Richard. [http://www.forensicmed.co.uk/asphyxia.htm Asphyxia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060226102952/http://www.forensicmed.co.uk/asphyxia.htm |date=2006-02-26 }}, [http://www.forensicmed.co.uk/strangulation.htm Strangulation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060430224427/http://www.forensicmed.co.uk/strangulation.htm |date=2006-04-30 }}.

*Compression of the [[laryngopharynx]], [[larynx]], or [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]]—causing [[asphyxia]].
*Stimulation of the [[carotid sinus reflex]]—causing [[bradycardia]], [[hypotension]], or both.
Depending on the particular method of strangulation, one or several of these typically occur in combination; [[cerebral ischemia|vascular obstruction]] is usually the main mechanism.&lt;ref name=ferris&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pathology.ubc.ca/path425/Others/MedicolegalInvestigationOfDeathAndForensic/AsphixiaDrJAJFerris.doc |title=Asphyxia |website=pathology.ubc.ca |author=J.

==Manual strangulation==
'''Manual strangulation''' (also known as "throttling") is strangling with the hands, fingers, or other extremities and sometimes also with blunt objects, such as [[Club (weapon)|batons]]. Depending on how the strangling is performed, it may compress the [[airway]], interfere with the flow of blood in the neck, or work as a combination of the two. Consequently, manual strangulation may damage the [[larynx]],&lt;ref name=jones/&gt; and fracture the [[hyoid]] or other bones in the neck.&lt;ref name=ferris/&gt; In cases of airway compression, manual strangling leads to the frightening sensation of [[air hunger]] and may induce violent struggling.&lt;ref name=jones/&gt;

More technical variants of manual strangulation are referred to as [[chokehold]]s, and are extensively practised and used in various [[martial arts]], [[combat sport]]s, [[self-defense]] systems, and in military [[hand-to-hand combat]] application. In some martial arts like [[judo]] and [[jujutsu]], strangles or chokes that constrict blood flow are regarded as a safe{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} way to render the opponent unconscious as opposed to other attacks, e.g., strikes to the head.
During the 18th century, a sentence of "Death by Throttling" would be passed upon the verdict of a [[Court Martial]] for the crime of desertion from the British Army.&lt;ref&gt;''Culloden''. BBC Drama Documentary, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ligature strangulation==
{{Main|Garrote}}
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Operation: Mindcrime]] --&gt;
'''Ligature strangulation''' (also known as "garroting") is strangling with some form of cord such as rope, wire, or shoe laces, either partially or fully circumferencing the neck.&lt;ref name=turvey&gt;Turvey, Brent (1996). [http://www.corpus-delicti.com/ligature.html A guide to the physical analysis of ligature patterns in homicide investigations]. Knowledge Solutions Library, Electronic Publication. ''www.corpus-delicti.com''. URL last accessed March 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the mechanism of strangulation is similar, it is usually distinguished from [[hanging]] by the strangling force being something other than the person's own bodyweight.&lt;ref name=ferris/&gt; Incomplete occlusion of the [[carotid arteries]] is expected and, in cases of [[homicide]], the victim may struggle for a period of time,&lt;ref name=ferris/&gt; with unconsciousness typically occurring in 10 to 15 seconds.&lt;ref name=turvey/&gt; Cases of ligature strangulation generally involve homicides of women, children, and the elderly,&lt;ref name=ferris/&gt; but accidents and suicides occur as well.&lt;ref name=dundee&gt;University of Dundee, Forensic Medicine. [http://www.dundee.ac.uk/forensicmedicine/llb/deaths.htm#Stages Asphyxial Deaths]. ''www.dundee.ac.uk''. URL last accessed March 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to hanging, the ligature mark will most likely be located lower on the neck of the victim.

During the [[Spanish Inquisition]], victims who admitted their alleged sins and recanted were killed via ligature strangulation (i.e. the [[garrote]]) before their bodies were burnt during the ''[[auto-da-fé]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Reston, James Jr. ''Dogs of God: Columbus, the Inquisition, and the Defeat of the Moors.'' Doubleday, 2005. {{ISBN|0-385-50848-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout much of the 20th and 21st centuries, the [[American Mafia]] used ligature strangulation as a means of murdering their victims.  Confessed American [[serial killer]] [[Altemio Sanchez]] used ligature strangulation in the rapes and/or murders of his victims, as did [[Gary Ridgway]], the Green River Killer.

A '''strategic lawsuit against public participation''' ('''SLAPP''') is a [[lawsuit]] that is intended to [[censorship|censor]], [[intimidate]], and silence critics by burdening them with the cost of a [[legal defense]] until they abandon their criticism or opposition.&lt;ref name="onthemedia_01"&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.onthemedia.org/2010/apr/02/slapp-back/transcript/
 |title=SLAPP Back: Transcript
 |date=April 2, 2010
 |website=[[On The Media]]
 |publisher=[[WNYC]] ([[National Public Radio]], [[PBS]])
 |first= Nazanin |last=Rafsanjani
 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such lawsuits have been made illegal in many jurisdictions on the grounds that they impede [[freedom of speech]].

In the typical SLAPP, the [[plaintiff]] does not normally expect to win the lawsuit. The plaintiff's goals are accomplished if the [[defendant]] succumbs to fear, intimidation, mounting [[legal costs]], or simple exhaustion and abandons the criticism. In some cases, repeated frivolous litigation against a defendant may raise the cost of [[directors and officers liability insurance]] for that party, interfering with an organization's ability to operate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2013/05/16/whacked-by-lawsuit-costs-old-city-civic-association-disbands/ |first=John |last=McDevitt |title=Whacked By Lawsuit Costs, Old City Civic Association Disbands |website=KYW-TV, CBS |location=Philadelphia |date=May 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A SLAPP may also intimidate others from participating in the debate. A SLAPP is often preceded by a [[legal threat]].

There is a difficulty in that plaintiffs do not present themselves to the court admitting that their intent is to censor, intimidate, or silence their critics. Hence, the difficulty in drafting SLAPP legislation, and in applying it, is to craft an approach which affords an early termination to invalid abusive suits, without denying a legitimate day in court to valid [[good faith]] claims. Thus, anti-SLAPP laws target tactics used by SLAPP plaintiffs. Common anti-SLAPP laws include measures such as penalties for plaintiffs who file lawsuits ruled frivolous and special procedures where a defendant may ask a judge to consider that a lawsuit is a SLAPP (and usually subsequently dismiss the suit).

Anti-SLAPP laws occasionally come under criticism from those who believe that there should not be barriers to the [[right to petition]] for those who sincerely believe they have been wronged, regardless of ulterior motives. Nonetheless, anti-SLAPP laws are generally considered to have a favorable effect, and many lawyers have fought to enact stronger laws protecting against SLAPPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2214&amp;context=llr |title=California's Anti-Slapp Legislation: A Summary of and Commentary on Its Operation and Scope |first=Kathryn W. |last=Tate |journal=[[Loyola of Los Angeles Law Review]] |volume=33 |pages=801–886 |date=April 1, 2000 |accessdate=July 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
SLAPPs take various forms. The most common used to be a civil suit for [[defamation]], which in the [[English common law]] tradition was a [[tort]]. The [[common law of libel]] dates to the early 17th century and, unlike most English law, is [[reverse onus]], meaning that once someone alleges a statement is libelous, the burden is on the defendant to prove that it is not. In England and Wales, the [[Defamation Act 2013]] removed most of the uses of defamation as a SLAPP by requiring the proof of special damage. Various abusive uses of this law including [[political libel]] (criticism of the political actions or views of others) have ceased to exist in most places, but persist in some jurisdictions (notably [[British Columbia]] and [[Ontario]]) where political views can be held as defamatory.

A common feature of SLAPPs is [[forum shopping]], wherein plaintiffs find courts that are more favourable towards the claims to be brought than the court in which the defendant (or sometimes plaintiffs) live.&lt;ref name=Sheldrick2014&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sheldrick |first1=Byron |title=Blocking Public Participation: The Use of Strategic Litigation to Silence Political Expression |date=2014 |publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University Press |isbn=978-1-55458-930-2 |page=50 |url=https://books.google.com?id=dbNlAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA50 |accessdate=November 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other widely mentioned elements of a SLAPP are the actual effectiveness at silencing critics, the timing of the suit, inclusion of extra or spurious defendants (such as relatives or hosts of legitimate defendants), inclusion of plaintiffs with no real claim (such as corporations that are affiliated with legitimate plaintiffs), making claims that are very difficult to disprove or rely on no written record, ambiguous or deliberately mangled wording that lets plaintiffs make spurious allegations without fear of [[perjury]], refusal to consider any settlement (or none other than cash), characterization of all offers to settle as insincere, extensive and unnecessary demands for [[discovery (law)|discovery]], attempts to identify [[anonymity|anonymous or pseudonymous]] critics, appeals on minor points of law, demands for broad rulings when appeal is accepted on such minor points of law, and attempts to run up defendants' costs even if this clearly costs more to the plaintiffs.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Several jurisdictions have passed anti-SLAPP laws, designed to quickly remove cases out of court. In many cases, the plaintiff is also required to pay a penalty for bringing the case, known as a SLAPP-back.

== History ==
The [[acronym]] was coined in the 1980s by [[University of Denver]] professors [[Penelope Canan]] and [[George W. Pring]].&lt;ref name="pring_canan_01"&gt;{{cite book |title=SLAPPs: Getting Sued for Speaking Out |isbn=978-0-375-75258-2 |last=Pring |first=George W. |last2=Canan |first2=Penelope |publisher=Temple University Press |pages=8–9 |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was originally defined as "a lawsuit involving communications made to influence a governmental action or outcome, which resulted in a civil complaint or counterclaim filed against nongovernment individuals or organizations on a substantive issue of some public interest or social significance." The concept's originators later dropped the notion that government contact had to be about a public issue to be protected by the [[Right to petition in the United States|Right to Petition]] the Government, as provided in the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. It has since been defined less broadly by some states, and more broadly in one state (California) where it includes suits about speech on any public issue.&lt;ref name="ccp_425_16_01"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.casp.net/california-anti-slapp-first-amendment-law-resources/statutes/c-c-p-section-425-16 |title=(California) Code of Civil Procedure – Section 425.16 |publisher=California Anti-SLAPP Project |year=2009 |origyear=Ratified 1992, last amended 2009 |quote=The Legislature finds and declares that it is in the public interest to encourage continued participation in matters of public significance, and that this participation should not be chilled through abuse of the judicial process.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original conceptualization proffered by Canan and Pring emphasized the right to petition as protected in the United States under the US Constitution's specific protection in the First Amendment's fifth clause. It is still definitional: SLAPPs refer to civil lawsuits filed against those who have communicated to government officialdom (in its entire constitutional apparatus). The Right to Petition, granted by [[Edgar the Peaceful]], King of England in the 10th century, antedates the [[Magna Carta]] in terms of its significance in the development of democratic institutions. As currently conceived, the right claims that democracy cannot properly function in the presence of barriers between the governed and the governing.&lt;ref name="right_to_petition_01"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3486&amp;context=flr |journal=[[Fordham Law Review]] |volume=66 |issue=6 |date=January 1, 1998 |title=The Vestigial Constitution: The History and Significance of the Right to Petition |first=Gregory A. |last=Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kingsengland.co.uk/queen-mary-ii-of-stuart-1689%E2%80%931694.html |title=Queen Mary II of Stuart (1689–1694) |website=Kings of England |year=2010 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morrone'', 590 N.Y.S.2d 649, 656 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1992). A number of jurisdictions have made such suits illegal, provided that the appropriate standards of [[journalistic responsibility]] have been met by the critic.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

== Jurisdictional variations ==

=== Australia ===
In the [[Australian Capital Territory]], the Protection of Public Participation Act 2008 protects conduct intended to influence public opinion or promote or further action in relation to an issue of public interest. A party starting or maintaining a proceeding against a defendant for an improper purpose may be ordered to pay a financial penalty to the Territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.act.gov.au/a/2008-48/20111212-50372/pdf/2008-48.pdf |title=Protection of Public Participation Act 2008 |website=Parliamentary Counsel's Office |location=Australian Capital Territory |date=12 December 2011 |accessdate=July 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
Some [[political libel]] and [[forum shopping]] incidents, both common in Canada, have been called SLAPPs, because such suits load defendants with costs of responding in unfamiliar jurisdictions or at times (typically elections) when they are extremely busy and short of funds. Both types of suits are unusual to Canada, so there is little academic concern nor examination of whether political subject matter or remote forums are a clear indicator of SLAPP.

==== British Columbia ====
One of the first cases in Canada to be explicitly ruled a SLAPP was ''Fraser v. Saanich'' (see [1999] B.C.J. No. 3100 (B.C. S.C.)) (QL), where the British Columbia Supreme Court struck out the claim of a hospital director against the District of Saanich, holding that it was a meritless action designed to silence or intimidate the residents who were opposed to the plaintiff's plan to redevelop the hospital facilities.

Following the decision in ''Fraser v. Saanich'', the ''Protection of Public Participation Act'' went into effect in British Columbia in April 2001. The legislation was repealed in August 2001. There was extensive debate on its merits and the necessity of having hard criteria for judges and whether this tended to reduce or increase process abuse. The debate was largely formed by the first case to discuss and apply the Protection of Public Participation Act (PPPA), ''Home Equity Development v. Crow''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.courts.gov.bc.ca/jdb-txt/sc/02/11/2002bcsc1138.htm |title=Home Equity Development v. Crow, et al (2002 BCSC 1138) |website=British Columbia Superior Courts |accessdate=May 23, 2015 |date=July 30, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The defendants' application to dismiss the action against them was dismissed. The defendants failed to meet the burden of proof required by the PPPA, that the plaintiffs had no reasonable prospect of success. While it was not the subject of the case, some felt that the plaintiffs did not bring their action for an improper purpose, and the suit did not inhibit the defendants in their public criticism of the particular project, and that the Act was therefore ineffective in this case.

Since the repeal, BC activists especially the [[BCCLA]] have argued repeatedly for a broad understanding of SLAPP and a broad interpretation of judicial powers especially in intervener applications in BC and other common law jurisdictions and when arguing for new legislation to prevent SLAPPs. The activist literature contains extensive research on particular cases and criteria. The [[West Coast Environmental Law]] organization agrees and generally considers BC to lag other jurisdictions.&lt;ref name="WCELJune2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wcel.org/resources/environmental-law-alert/bc-trails-quebec-ontario-protecting-public-chilling-lawsuits |title=BC trails Quebec, Ontario in protecting public from chilling lawsuits |date=June 6, 2010 |website=West Coast Environmental Law Association |accessdate=July 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Nova Scotia ====
A [[private member's bill]] introduced in 2001 by [[Graham Steele]] (NDP, [[Halifax Fairview]]) proposed a "Protection of Public Participation Act" to dismiss proceedings or claims brought or maintained for an improper purpose, awarding punitive or exemplary damages (effectively, a SLAPP back) and protection from liability for communication or conduct which constitutes public participation. The bill did not progress beyond first reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nslegislature.ca/legc/bills/58th_2nd/1st_read/b061.htm |title=Protection of Public Participation Act |website=Nova Scotia legislature |date=May 23, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ontario ====
In Ontario, the decision in ''Daishowa v. Friends of the Lubicon'' (see [1996] O.J. No. 3855 Ont. Ct. Gen. Div.) (QL) was also instructive on SLAPPs. A motion brought by the corporate plaintiff Daishowa to impose conditions on the defendant Friends of the Lubicon Indian Band that they would not represent Daishowa's action as a SLAPP was dismissed.

By 2010, the Ontario Attorney-General issued a major report which identified SLAPP as a major problem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca/english/anti_slapp/ |title=Anti-SLAPP Advisory Panel |website=Ministry of the Attorney General |date=June 2013 |accessdate=January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but initially little or nothing was done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lawiscool.com/2011/10/06/renewing-the-debate-on-anti-slapp-legislation-in-ontario/ |title=Renewing the Debate on Anti-SLAPP Legislation in Ontario |website=Law is Cool |date=October 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, the Attorney General introduced legislation to implement the recommendations of the report; that bill was re-introduced after the [[Ontario general election, 2014|2014 election]]. {{asof|2014}}, Bill 83, the Protection of Public Participation Act (2014), has been referred to the Standing Committee on Social Policy and is not yet law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ontla.on.ca/web/bills/bills_detail.do?BillID=2810 |title=Bills &amp; Lawmaking – Current Parliament – Bill 83, Protection of Public Participation Act, 2014 |website=Legislative Assembly of Ontario |accessdate=January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill proposes a mechanism for an order to dismiss strategic lawsuits which attack free expression on matters of public interest, with full costs (but not punitive damages) and on a relatively short timeframe, if the underlying claims have no reasonable prospect of success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rabble.ca/columnists/2014/08/protecting-public-debate-through-anti-slapp-legislation |title=Protecting public debate through anti-SLAPP legislation |first=Shelina |last=Ali |date=August 28, 2014 |website=[[rabble.ca]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015, Ontario passed the Protection of Public Participation Act, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.ontario.ca/mag/en/2015/10/protection-of-public-participation-act.html |title=Protection of Public Participation Act |date=October 28, 2015 |website=Ministry of the Attorney General |accessdate=January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Quebec ====
Québec's then Justice Minister, Jacques Dupuis, proposed an anti-SLAPP bill on June 13, 2008.&lt;ref name="ulcc_slapp_01"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ulcc.ca/en/poam2/SLAPP%20Report.pdf |title=Strategic Lawsuits against Public Participation (SLAPPs) (and other abusive lawsuits) |last=Pelletier |first=Vincent |website=Uniform Law Conference of Canada, Civil Section (English &amp; French) |date=August 2008 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The bill was adopted by the [[National Assembly of Quebec]] on June 3, 2009. As of September 2013, Quebec's amended Code of Civil Procedure is the only anti-SLAPP mechanism in force in Canada.

This bill was invoked in Ontario (and then [[Supreme Court of Canada]] docket 33819) in the case of Les Éditions Écosociété Inc., [[Alain Deneault]], [[Delphine Abadie]] and [[William Sacher]] vs. [[Banro]] Inc., in which the publisher Écosociété pleaded (supported by the [[BCCLA]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bccla.org/othercontent/Ecosociete_BCCLA_argument.pdf |title=Les Editions Ecosociete Inc., Alain Deneault, Delphine Abadie and William Sacher v.

The court denied the request, ruling that the Ontario court did have jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Lexum-scc|2012|18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A separate 2011 decision in Quebec Superior Court had ruled that [[Barrick Gold]] had to pay $143,000 to the book's three authors and publisher, Les Éditions Écosociété Inc., to prepare their defence in a "seemingly abusive" strategic lawsuit against public participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cautbulletin.ca/en_article.asp?ArticleID=3342 |title=Noir Canada Defamation Lawsuit Settled, Publication of Book Stopped |website=Canadian Association of University Teachers Bulletin |accessdate=January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the Québec ruling, a book ''Noir Canada'' documenting the relationship between Canadian mining corporations, armed conflict and political actors in Africa was never published as part of a settlement which, according to the authors, was only made for the sole purpose of resolving the three-and-a-half-year legal battle.

The Quebec law is substantially different in structure than that of California&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citmedialaw.org/legal-guide/anti-slapp-law-california |title=Anti-SLAPP Law in California |website=Digital Media Law Project |accessdate=January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or other jurisdictions, however as Quebec's Constitution generally subordinates itself to [[international law]], the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] applies. That treaty only permits liability for arbitrary and unlawful speech. The ICCPR has also been cited, in the BC case Crookes v. Newton, as the standard for balancing free speech versus reputation rights. The Supreme Court of Canada in October 2011, ruling in that case, neither reiterated nor rescinded that standard.

In [[Colorado]] and [[West Virginia]], the courts have adopted protections against SLAPPs. These laws vary dramatically in scope and level of protection, and the remaining states lack specific protections.

There is no federal anti-SLAPP law, but legislation for one has been previously introduced such as the [[SPEAK FREE Act of 2015]].

It has been argued that the lack of uniform protection against SLAPPs has encouraged [[forum shopping]]; proponents of federal legislation have argued that the uncertainty about one's level of protection has likely magnified the [[chilling effect]] of SLAPPs.&lt;ref name=PPP&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anti-slapp.org/slappdash-faqs-about-slapps/ |title=FAQS about SLAPPS |website=Public Participation Project |accessdate=June 26, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403051530/http://www.anti-slapp.org/slappdash-faqs-about-slapps |archivedate=April 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, Rep. [[Steve Cohen]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]–Tennessee) introduced the Citizen Participation Act in the U.S. House.&lt;ref name="cohen_hr_4364"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h4364/text |title=H.R.4364 – Citizen Participation Act of 2009 (As introduced in House Dec. 16, 2009) |website=Open Congress for the 112th United States Congress |publisher=Participatory Politics Foundation and Sunlight Foundation |accessdate=June 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This marks the first time the Congress has considered federal anti-SLAPP legislation, though the Congress enacted the [[SPEECH Act]] on the closely related issue of ''[[libel tourism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Obama Signs Libel Tourism Law |first=Andrew |last=Albanese |date=August 12, 2010 |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/44148-obama-signs-libel-tourism-law.html |magazine=[[Publishers Weekly]] |accessdate=June 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like many state anti-SLAPP laws, H.R. 4364 would allow the defendant of a SLAPP to have the suit quickly dismissed and to recover fees and costs.

==== California ====
California has a unique variant of anti-SLAPP legislation. In 1992 California enacted Code of Civil Procedure §&amp;nbsp;425.16, a [[statute]] intended to frustrate SLAPPs by providing a quick and inexpensive defense.&lt;ref name ="ccp_425_16_01" /&gt; It provides for a special motion that a [[defendant]] can file at the outset of a lawsuit to strike a [[complaint]] when it arises from conduct that falls within the rights of [[petition]] or [[free speech]]. The statute expressly applies to any writing or speech made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative, executive, or judicial proceeding, or any other official proceeding authorized by law, but there is no requirement that the writing or speech be promulgated directly to the official body. It also applies to speech in a public forum about an issue of public interest and to any other petition or speech conduct about an issue of public interest.

To win on an anti-SLAPP (special motion to strike) motion, the defendant in the alleged SLAPP action must first show that the lawsuit is based on claims related to [[United States Constitution|constitutionally protected activities]], typically [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights such as [[free speech]], and typically seeks to show that the claim lacks any basis of genuine substance, legal underpinnings, evidence, or prospect of success. If this is demonstrated then the [[legal burden|burden]] shifts to the plaintiff to affirmatively present evidence demonstrating a reasonable probability of succeeding in their case by showing an actual wrong would exist as recognized by law, if the facts claimed were borne out.

The filing of an anti-SLAPP motion stays all [[Discovery (law)|discovery]]. This feature acts to greatly reduce the cost of litigation to the anti-SLAPP defendant, and can make beating the motion extremely difficult for the plaintiff, because they effectively must prove their case has at least a basis of visible legal merit and is not merely [[vexatious]], prior to discovery.

If the special motion is denied, the order denying the motion is immediately appealable. Defendants prevailing on an anti-SLAPP motion (including any subsequent appeal) are entitled to a mandatory award of reasonable attorney's fees. After an anti-SLAPP motion has been filed, a plaintiff cannot escape this mandatory fee award by amending its complaint. More than 300 published court opinions have interpreted and applied California's anti-SLAPP law.&lt;ref name="casp_cases_california_01"&gt;{{cite web

 |title=Cases Involving the California Anti-SLAPP Law
 |website=California Anti-SLAPP Project
 |accessdate=June 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

California's '''Code of Civil Procedure §&amp;nbsp;425.17''' corrects what the Legislature found to be abuse of the anti-SLAPP statute.&lt;ref name="ccp_425_17_01"&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.casp.net/california-anti-slapp-first-amendment-law-resources/statutes/c-c-p-section-425-17

Signed into law on September 6, 2003, this statute prohibits anti-SLAPP motions in response to certain public interest lawsuits and class actions, and actions that arise from commercial statements or conduct. '''Section 425.18''', signed into law on October 6, 2005, was enacted to facilitate SLAPP victims in recovering their damages through a SLAPPback ([[malicious prosecution]] action) against the SLAPP filers and their attorneys after the underlying SLAPP has been dismissed.&lt;ref name="ccp_425_18_01"&gt;{{cite web

==== Washington State ====
In May 2015, the Washington Supreme Court struck down the state’s 2010 anti-SLAPP statute.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=e34a54bc-3ce7-4e0c-b714-9a4db8e59ae3&lt;/ref&gt;

== Balancing the right of access to the courts ==
The SLAPP penalty stands as a barrier to access to the courts by providing an early penalty to claimants who seek judicial redress. In recent years, the courts in some states have recognized that enforcement of SLAPP legislation must recognize and balance the constitutional rights of both litigants. It has been said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Since [[Magna Carta]], the world has recognized the importance of justice in a free society. "To no one will we sell, to no one will we refuse or delay, right or justice." (Magna Carta, 1215.) This nation's founding fathers knew people would never consent to be governed and surrender their right to decide disputes by force, unless government offered a just forum for resolving those disputes.&lt;ref name="social_contract_from_hobbes_to_rawls_01"&gt;{{cite book

 |publisher=[[Routledge]]
 |edition=1st }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The right to bring grievances to the courts, in good faith, is protected by state and federal constitutions in a variety of ways. In most states, the right to trial by jury in civil cases is recognized. The right to cross-examine witnesses is considered fundamental to the American judicial system. Moreover, the first amendment protects the right to petition the government for a redress of grievances. The "right to petition extends to all departments of the Government. The right of access to the courts is indeed but one aspect of the right of petition."&lt;ref name="california_motor_transport_v_trucking_unlimited"&gt;{{cite web

Because "the right to petition is 'among the most precious of the liberties safeguarded by the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]],' ... the right of access to the courts shares this 'preferred place' in [the United States'] hierarchy of constitutional freedoms and values."&lt;ref name="harrison_v_springdale_water_and_sewer"&gt;{{cite web

In ''Palazzo v. Alves'', the Supreme Court of Rhode Island stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;By the nature of their subject matter, anti-SLAPP statutes require meticulous drafting. On the one hand, it is desirable to seek to shield citizens from improper intimidation when exercising their constitutional right to be heard with respect to issues of public concern. On the other hand, it is important that such statutes be limited in scope lest the constitutional right of access to the courts (whether by private figures, public figures, or public officials) be improperly thwarted. There is a genuine double-edged challenge to those who legislate in this area.&lt;ref name="palazzo_v_ives_944_a2d_144"&gt;{{cite web

The most challenging balancing problem arises in application to SLAPP claims which do not sound (give rise to a claim) in [[tort]]. The [[common law]] and [[constitutional law]] have developed in the United States to create a high substantive burden to tort and tort-like claims which seek redress for [[public speech]], especially public speech which addresses matters of public concern. The common law in many states requires the pleader to state accurately the content of [[libel]]ous words. Constitutional law has provided substantive protection which bars recovery against a first amendment defense except upon clear and convincing evidence that there has been deliberate or reckless falsehood. For this reason, ferreting out the [[bad faith]] SLAPP claim at an early stage of litigation should be accomplished with relative ease. Extension of the SLAPP penalties to factually complex cases, where the substantive standard of proof at common law is lower presents special challenges.

A Minnesota Supreme Court case, ''Middle-Snake-Tamarac Rivers Watershed Dist. v. Stengrim'', 784 N.W.2d 834 (Minn. 2010) establishes a two-step process to determine whether SLAPP procedure should be applied. The decision arises in the context of an effort to enforce a settlement agreement between a local government and an opponent of a flood control project. The landowner had accepted a significant monetary settlement in settlement of his opposition to land acquisition. The landowner agreed as part of the settlement to address no further challenges to the project. When the local government sued the landowner for breach of settlement, the landowner contended that enforcement of the settlement was a strategic lawsuit against public participation. The Supreme Court rejected that claim and affirmed the District Court's denial of SLAPP relief, holding "The District Court properly denied a motion to dismiss where the underlying claim involved an alleged breach of a settlement agreement that potentially limited the moving party's rights to public participation." The Supreme Court explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Preexisting legal relationships, such as those based on a settlement agreement where a party waives certain rights, may legitimately limit a party’s public participation. It would be illogical to read sections 554.01-.05 as providing presumptive immunity to actions that a moving party may have contractually agreed to forgo or limit.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Under the Minnesota approach, as a preliminary matter, the moving party must meet the burden of showing that the circumstances which bring the case within the purview of SLAPP protection exists. Until that has been accomplished, no clear and convincing burden has been shifted to the responding party.

This was the first case to establish clearly the SLAPP criteria.
* ''Fraser v. Saanich (District)'' 1995, [BCJ 3100 BCSC] was held explicitly to be a SLAPP, the first known case to be so described. Justice Singh found plaintiff's conduct to be "reprehensible and deserving of censure", ordering he pay "special costs" [page 48, Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation: The British Columbia Experience, RECEIL 19(1) 2010 {{ISSN|0962-8797}}] to compensate.
* In 2011, in ''Robin Scory v.

* In May 2010, [[Youthdale Treatment Centres]] of Toronto, Ontario filed a defamation suit against various former patients, parents of former patients, and other persons, claiming C$5,000,000.00 in damages.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} The lawsuit, filed on May 5, 2010 on behalf of Youthdale by Harvin Pitch and Jennifer Lake of Teplitsky, Colson LLP claimed that these persons were involved in a conspiracy to, among other things, have Youthdale's licence to operate revoked. Youthdale also claimed their reputation was damaged as a result of various actions by the named defendants, which Youthdale alleged included the creation of websites and blogs containing complaints against Youthdale, including alleged accusations of unlawful administration of psychotropic medications. A notable left-turn for Youthdale occurred in July 2010, when Youthdale became the subject of a [[Toronto Star]] investigation, in which it was found that Youthdale had been admitting children to its Secure Treatment Unit that did not have mental disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Zlomislic |first=Diana |url=https://www.thestar.com/News/Investigations/article/832911 |title=Youth lock-ups blasted |newspaper=Toronto Star|date=July 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case has since been dismissed.

This, the Liberals and most commentators and authorities agreed, would be a serious crime if proven. Harper alleged the tape had been altered but a court found no evidence of this.

* Morris vs Johnson et al. October 22, 2012 ONSC 5824 (CanLII): During the final weeks of the 2010 municipal election in Aurora, Ontario a group town councilors and the incumbent Mayor agreed to use town funds in order to launch what was later referenced as a private lawsuit fronted by the Mayor, seeking $6M, against both named and anonymous residents who were critical of the local government. After the mayor and a number of councilors lost the election the new town council cut public funding for the private lawsuit and they issued a formal apology to the defendants. Almost one year after the town cut funding and after Morris lost a Norwich motion, Morris discontinued her case. The discontinuance cost decision delivered by Master Hawkins reads, per para. 32 (Ontario Superior court of Justice court file no.10-CV-412021): "Because I regard this action as SLAPP litigation designed to stifle debate about Mayor Morris' fitness for office, commenced during her re-election campaign, I award Johnson and Hogg special enhanced costs as was done in Scory v. Krannitz 2011 BCSC 1344 per Bruce J. at para. 31 (B.C.S.C)." Morris subsequently sued the town for $250,000 in the spring of 2013 in order to recover her legal costs for the period after the town cut funding of her case. Almost one and a half years after the final ruling in the Morris defamation case (i.e. the second Master Hawkins cost ruling delivered in January 2013) and approximately one year after suing the town, Morris amended her statement of claim to note that her legal costs were actually $27,821.46 and not the $250,000 as noted in the initial statement of claim. Morris then attempted to move the case to small claims court after the town had already spent over $150,000 in preparing its defense. As of the summer of 2015 the case is ongoing.
* In 2012, [[Sino-Forest]] sued Muddy Waters Research for $4&amp;nbsp;billion for defamation in the [[Ontario Superior Court of Justice]].

=== Estonia ===
In 2016, the real-estate investment company Pro Kapital Ltd sued urbanist Teele Pehk who expressed her opinion about the company's development plans in Kalasadam area in [[Tallinn]], Estonia. The accusations were based on an interview given for the article "The battle for the Estonian coastline", published by the monthly newspaper ''[[The Baltic Times]]''. Initially, instead of clarifying the questionable quotes in the article with the ''Baltic Times''{{'}} editors, Pro Kapital sent a legal demand to Pehk demanding that she publish a pre-written explanation and pay €500 to cover their legal advice expenses. Pehk provided proof to the lawyer that she had not lied to the journalist of ''The Baltic Times'', and the newspaper published a clarification online that Pehk's words were misinterpreted. Few months later Pro Kapital sued Pehk for damaging their reputation by spreading lies about the detailed plan of the Kalasadam area. Teele Pehk had been involved with the detailed plan of Kalasadam since 2011, as a member of the neighbourhood association Telliskivi selts and caretaker of the Kalarand beach, situated on the edge of Kalasadam area.

Half a year into the court case, Pro Kapital began negotiations and settled with a compromise before the court hearing. Pro Kapital paid for Pehk's legal costs and both parties agreed not to disparage each other in the future. Teele Pehk is still active in Tallinn urban development and continues to spread the word about SLAPP.

This first SLAPP case in Estonia took place at the end of the 12-year process of planning the Kalasadam area, which over the years had witnessed exceptionally high public interest regarding the planned residential development and most importantly, the public use of the seaside and the beach. The planning system in Estonia allows anyone to express their opinion, present suggestions or objections to any detailed plan. Many Estonian civic organisations were raising concerned voices about the case and the Chancellor for Justice of Estonia condemned that practice many times in public appearances.

In 2018, [[Lovdata]], a foundation which publishes judicial information, sued two people amongst the volunteers in the [[rettspraksis.no]] project. Up until 2008, Lovdata was considered a government agency and had unlimited access to the supreme court servers. Based on this access, Lovdata has established a [[de facto]] monopoly on Norwegian supreme court rulings. When rettspraksis.no published supreme court decisions, Lovdata sued [[Håkon Wium Lie]] and [[Fredrik Ljone]], two of the volunteers. Although court decisions are not protected by copyright in Norway, Lovdata claimed that rettspraksis.no had used advanced crawlers to copy Lovdata's database. In less than 24 hours, Lovdata was able to close the rettspraksis.no site and the judge also ordered the volunteers to pay Lovdata's legal fees. Also, rettspraksis.no was not allowed to appear in court to explain that their source for the legal decision is a CD deposited in the National Library by Lovdata itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

* In an effort to prevent four women from filing any Public Records Requests without first getting permission from a judge, or from filing future lawsuits, the Congress Elementary School District filed the lawsuit [[Congress Elementary School District v. Warren, et. al.]] on January 28, 2010. [[The Goldwater Institute]], a think tank based in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], represented the four defendants. The school district said that it has been harassed so often by Warren that it was not able to functionally educate its students. Toni Wayas, the school district's superintendent, claimed "that it had, time and time again, complied with the requests" The Goldwater Institute argued that the school district had been in violation of state laws mandating government transparency in the past. Investigations in 2002 and 2007 by the state Ombudsman and Attorney General uncovered violations of the state's open meeting law by the Attorney General's Office. According to Carrie Ann Sitren of the Goldwater Institute, this was "a clear attempt to silence people in the community who have been critical of the board's actions, and have made good-faith attempts to ensure the district is spending taxpayer money wisely." None of the records requested were private or confidential, and thus, should have been readily available to be released to the public, according to the assistant state Ombudsman.&lt;ref name="congress_school_district_v_warren"&gt;{{cite news

'''''Synth''''' is an [[Action game|action]] [[real-time strategy]] [[video game]] by Canadian developer [[Rhys Paul Hovey]] for [[Microsoft Windows]]. ''Synth'' is an abstract and procedurally generated [[3D computer graphics|3D]] game, in which the graphics have an algorithmic [[C++]] representation.

==Gameplay==
''Synth'' is a [[strategy video game|strategic]] [[action game]], in which the player must find an exit in a [[procedural generation|procedurally generated]] landscape. The player is equipped with a laser, bombs, and a device that acts as a vacuum or blower. The overall goal is to reach the highest level possible.&lt;ref name="gamasutra"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=23130|title=Interview: The Secrets of SYNTH, 'Weirdest Video Game Ever Created'|date=April 14, 2009|work=Gamasutra|author=Ciolek, Todd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Synth'' uses C++ algorithms to generate the level's structure and graphics. Levels are [[Random seed|seeded]] from four-letter words: for example, "BGNI" is the first level.&lt;ref name="gamasutra"/&gt; As the game does not need to store pre-rendered textures and model data, only small [[filesize]]s are required.&lt;ref name="rps"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2009/03/30/synth-maths-in-action/|title=SYNTH: Maths in Action|work=Rock, Paper, Shotgun|author=Meer, Alec|date=March 30, 2009|accessdate=2009-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Synth''{{'}}s [[drum and bass]] [[synthesizer]] soundtrack dynamically changes during the game. The sounds were pre-composed by Hovey, but the player's controls are mapped to a loop-sequence [[remixer]].&lt;ref name="gamasutra"/&gt;

==Development==
[[Image:Synth video game screenshot B.png|250px|right]]
Hovey cites the artwork of [[Roger Dean (artist)|Roger Dean]] (who produced the covers for several [[Psygnosis]] titles), other [[Amiga]] graphics, and [[Pink Floyd]] as influences for ''Synth'' imagery.&lt;ref name="gamasutra"/&gt;

''Synth'' is currently only available as a [[game demo]]. Once a full version is ready, Hovey intends to acquire a digital distribution deal.&lt;ref name="gamasutra"/&gt;

==Critical reception==
Todd Ciolek, an editor with [[Gamasutra]] made reference to the games experimental design: "Rhys Paul Hovey’s SYNTH is an experimental game in many ways".&lt;ref name="gamasutra"/&gt; [[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] drew comparisons with the visuals of [[Darwinia (video game)|Darwinia]] and the procedural nature of [[.kkrieger]]. The graphics were described as fascinating: "a bizarre, mesmerizing cross between the deeply archaic and the thoroughly high-tech."&lt;ref name="rps"/&gt; [[ModDB]] reviewed version 0.909 and praised the game's concept, describing the visuals as "crazy 3D [[Geometry Wars]] on acid". Criticisms included the poor [[frame rate]], incomplete [[Windows Vista editions#64-bit versions|Vista 64-bit]] support and lack of a windowed mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast|url=http://www.moddb.com/games/synthtm/features/modcast-s02-e11|title=Modcast|website=ModDB|date=2009-02-02|accessdate=2009-08-05|time=16:15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010, SYNTH:Electropix 64 bit version 1.505, won 1st place in the Intel corporation's "Level up" 2010 game demo contest, in the "Best game for a desktop" category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2010/11/30/congratulations-to-the-winners-in-the-professional-category-of-level-up-2010/|title=Congratulations to the winners in the professional category of Level Up 2010!|work=Intel Software Network|author=Lowry, Kelly|date=November 30, 2010|accessdate=2010-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hovey used the user name Paul Richard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://software.intel.com/file/30831}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8073">[[T. H. Marshall]]'s '''Social Citizenship''' is a political concept first highlighted in his essay, “Citizenship and the Social Class” in 1949. 

== Overview ==
Marshall's concept defines the social responsibilities the state has to its citizens or, as Marshall puts it, “from [granting] the right to a modicum of [[economic welfare]] and security to the right to share to the full in the social heritage and to live the life of a civilized being according to the standards prevailing in the society”.&lt;ref name="Marshall"&gt;Marshall, T H. Citizenship and Social Class: And Other Essays. Cambridge [Eng.: University Press, 1950. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the key points made by Marshall is his belief in an evolution of rights in [[England]] acquired via [[citizenship]], from “[[civil rights]] in the eighteenth [century], political in the nineteenth, and social in the twentieth”.&lt;ref name="Marshall" /&gt;  This evolution however, has been criticized by many for only being from the perspective of the white working man. Marshall concludes his essay with three major factors for the evolution of [[social rights]] and for their further evolution, listed below: 
# The lessening of the [[income gap]]
# “The great extension of the area of common culture and common experience”&lt;ref name="Marshall" /&gt;
# An enlargement of citizenship and more rights granted to these citizens. 
Many of the social responsibilities of a state have since become a major part of many state’s policies (see [[United States Social Security]]). However, these have also become controversial issues as there is a debate over whether a citizen truly has the [[right to education]] and even more so, to [[social welfare]].

==Criticism==
=== From the Neo-Liberals===
“[[Neo-liberal|Neo-Liberal]] (Free-Market) ideology [asserts] that state abstention from economic protection is the foundation of a good society”,&lt;ref name="McCluskey"&gt;McCluskey, Martha. "Efficiency and Social Citizenship: Challenging the Neoliberal Attack on the Welfare State †." Indiana Law Journal 78:783 (2002): n. pag. Indiana Law Journal . Web. 26 Nov. 2011.3.&lt;/ref&gt; thus they are diametrically opposed to the social rights proposed by Marshall. Neo-liberals instead suggest that welfare programs (some of the [[Social responsibility|social responsibilities]] discussed by Marshall to help the poor “effectively utilize their civil and political rights”&lt;ref name="Marshall" /&gt;), have “promoted [[passivity (behavior)|passivity]] among the poor, without actually improving their chances, and created a culture of dependency”.&lt;ref name="Kymlicka"&gt;Kymlicka, Will, and Wayne Norman. "Return of the Citizen: A Survey of Recent Work on Citizenship Theory."Ethics 104 (1994): 352-376. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; They instead suggest (and have implemented) welfare requiring fulfillment of obligations.&lt;ref name="Kymlicka" /&gt;

Proponents of [[social citizenship]] are very critical of the Neo-Liberal ideology, suggesting that it is an “assault on the very principle of citizenship”,&lt;ref name="McCluskey" /&gt; and that the Neo-Liberal institution of fulfillment of obligations as requirement for citizenship, because they suggest that citizenship is inherent and that “that is only appropriate to demand fulfillment of the responsibilities after the right to participate is achieved”.&lt;ref name="Kymlicka" /&gt;

===From the Feminists===
Some [[feminist]] scholars argue that Marshall’s essay only reflects the perspective of working class white males. His assertion that in England all people were free and had civil rights is false, as only men had any “legal freedom” or ability to exercise [[Political rights|political]] or civil rights. Thus, they argue that Marshall fails to discuss the issue of [[second-class citizen]]s and that “he takes for granted the gender and racial hierarchies” &lt;ref name="Fraser"&gt;Fraser, Nancy, and Linda Gordon. 1992. “Contract versus Charity: Why Is There No Social Citizenship in the United States?” Socialist Review 22: 45–65&lt;/ref&gt; within society is a fundamental flaw in his work. 

However, while Marshall did not discuss the problems associated with having second-class citizenry, he did acknowledge that “citizenship itself [has] functioned as an architect of [[social inequality]]”.&lt;ref name="Marshall" /&gt; Additionally, many feminists see the expansion of social rights as an inherently good thing, especially as today; women in many countries have the same civil and political rights as men. And, feminists see social rights as giving an opportunity to many women to utilize their civil and political rights (just as Marshall suggests white men in England in the 1940s are able to do).&lt;ref&gt;Side, Katherine. "Contract, Charity, And Honorable Entitlement: Social Citizenship And The 1967 Abortion Act In Northern Ireland After The Good Friday Agreement." Social Politics: International Studies In Gender, State &amp; Society 13.1 (2006): 89-116.Political Science Complete. Web. 27 Nov. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Especially as current free-market solutions “[embrace’] a racialized, genderized, and class-biased  vision  of  social  equity  and community solidarity that  favors the interests of the most privileged members  of society”.&lt;ref name="Kymlicka" /&gt; Without resources, traditional hierarchies, with white men at the top, are unable to be combated.&lt;ref name="Kymlicka" /&gt;

==The Contract-Charity Dichotomy ==
[[Nancy Fraser]] and [[Linda Gordon]] in the essay “Contract versus Charity: Why is there no Social Citizenship in the United States?” expanded on T. H. Marshall's original proposition to look at how [[gender inequality]] has led to a dismissal of social citizenship within the [[United States]]. They argue that, because men were more powerful in [[civil society]], within the “male sphere”  “contractual relations dominated”,&lt;ref name="Fraser" /&gt; especially in regards to work with wage contracts.  Gradually, the male sphere began to dominate more and more of human relations, and thus contractual relations encroached on more and more areas. Because of “the hegemony of contract… a specifically modern conception of ‘charity’” &lt;ref name="Fraser" /&gt; was generated as a “complementary other.” Thus, welfare and helping the unfortunate became seen as a form of charity, rather than as an obligation. Because of this viewpoint, the receivers of charity were stigmatized for not “earning” the charity. 
	
Fraser and Gordon also offer a solution to allowing social citizenship to gain popularity within the United States. They suggest that concentrating the focus of civil citizenship from “property-centered to a more solidaristic form” would allow citizens to reestablish ties with their community, something they believe is essential for citizens to have in order to believe in welfare and social citizenship as a whole.

==Conclusion==
T.H. Marshall published his essay in 1949 and it has had a huge impact on many of the citizen debates which have followed it.&lt;ref&gt;Torres, Carlos. "Democracy, Education and Multiculturalism: Dilemmas of Citizenship in a Global World." Citizenship, Democracy, and Multiculturalism: The Theoretical Problem. UCLA, 20 Mar. 1998. Web. 26 Nov. 2011. &lt;http://www.international.ucla.edu/lac/cat&lt;/ref&gt; Though the original essay fails to view perspectives other than that of a working class white male, social citizenship not only can be but has been applied to myriad peoples. The United States has become disillusioned by the idea of social citizenship, but many industrialized states view social citizenship as their responsibility, even providing welfare outside of their own borders. Marshall’s articulation of the idea of social citizenship was vital to the idea’s proliferation.

The '''Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief''' was established in 1986 by the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]].

== Background ==
The [[United Nations General Assembly]] passed the [[Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief]] in 1981. Although not endowed with the force of [[international law]], this resolution was the first international legal instrument devoted exclusively to the [[freedom of religion]].

In furtherance of the goals of the 1981 resolution and in support the general evolution of the freedom of religion as a [[human rights|human right]], the United Nations Commission on Human Rights established the [[United Nations Special Rapporteurs|"Special Rapporteur on Religion Intolerance]]." In 2000 the Commission on Human Rights changed the mandate title of the position to "Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief", in order that the position's name may more accurately capture the need for the Special Rapporteur to protect individuals's right to change religion or abstain from religious belief.

== Independent Experts ==
The Independent Expert is appointed by the [[UN Human Rights Council]]. The mandate holder has been invited to identify existing and emerging obstacles to the free exercise of the right to freedom of religion or belief, and present recommendations on methods by which such obstacles may be overcome.

Past Independent Experts:
*Angelo d'Almeida Ribeiro (Portugal), March 1986 -1993
*Abdelfattah Amor (Tunisia), April 1993 - July 2004
*[[Asma Jahangir]] (Pakistan), August 2004 - July 2010
*[[Heiner Bielefeldt]] (Germany), 1 August 2010 – November 2016

Current Independent Expert:

[[File:Pringle-Patric House.jpg|thumb|[[Pringle-Patric House]], one of the first women's domestic violence shelter in the United States, built in 1877]]
{{Violence against women}}

A '''women's shelter''', also known as a '''women's refuge''' and '''battered women's shelter''', is a place of temporary protection and support for women escaping [[domestic violence]] and [[intimate partner violence]] of all forms.&lt;ref name="Definition"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/women-s-refuge|title=women's refuge Definition in the Cambridge English Dictionary|website=dictionary.cambridge.org|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also frequently used to describe a location for the same purpose that is open to people of all genders at risk.

Representative data samples done by the [[National Center for Injury Prevention and Control|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] show that one in three women will experience physical violence during their lifetime.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Breiding MJ, Chen J, Black MC. Intimate Partner Violence in the United States – 2010. Atlanta, GA: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; One in ten will experience sexual violence.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Women's shelters help individuals escape these instances of domestic violence and intimate partner violence and act as a place for protection as they choose how to move forward. Additionally, many shelters offer a variety of other services to help women and their children including [[counseling]] and legal guidance.&lt;ref name="Chanmugam"&gt;Chanmugam, A. (2011). Perspectives on US Domestic Violence Emergency Shelters: What do Young Adolescent Residents and their Mothers Say?. ''Child Care In Practice'', ''17''(4), 395. doi:10.1080/13575279.2011.596814&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability to escape is valuable for women subjected to domestic violence or intimate partner violence.  Additionally, such situations frequently involve an imbalance of power that limits the victim's financial options when they want to leave.&lt;ref name="McNulty, M. 2009" /&gt; Shelters help women gain tangible resources to help them and their families create a new life.&lt;ref name="Perez"&gt;Perez, S., Johnson, D. M., &amp; Wright, C. V. (2012). The Attenuating Effect of Empowerment on IPV-Related PTSD Symptoms in Battered Women Living in Domestic Violence Shelters. ''Violence Against Women'', ''18''(1), 102–117 16p. doi:10.1177/1077801212437348&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, shelters are valuable to [[battered women]] because they can help them find a sense of empowerment.&lt;ref name="Perez" /&gt;

Women's shelters are available in more than forty-five countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gnws.org/docs/GNWS_GlobalDataCount_2012.pdf|title=Global Data Count|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=The Global Network of Women's Shelters|access-date=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are supported with government resources as well as non-profit funds. Additionally, many philanthropists also help and support these institutions.

==History==

=== Canada ===
The very first women's shelter in Canada was started in 1965 by the Harbour Rescue Mission (now Mission Services) in Hamilton, Ontario. It was named Inasmuch House, with the name referencing a Bible verse (Matthew 25:40) quoting Jesus Christ as saying "Inasmuch as you have done it for the least of these, you have done it for me." It was designed to be a practical outworking of Christian values relating to justice and care. Although originally conceived as a shelter for women leaving prison, its clientele later became women escaping abuse by their partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mission-services.com/say-hello/history/|title=History - Mission Services of Hamilton|work=Mission Services of Hamilton|access-date=2017-05-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of Inasmuch House was shared with other Christian inner-city missions across North America and led to the opening of  other such shelters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.shelterlistings.org/details/19550/|title=The Haven Of Rest Ministries - Inasmuch House (for Women And Children)|website=www.shelterlistings.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first  shelters in Canada developed from a feminist perspective were started by Interval House, Toronto in April 1973, and the Ishtar Transition Housing Society in Langley, B.C.in June 1973.  These homes were grass roots organizations that lived on short term grants at first, with staff often working sacrificially in order to keep the houses running to ensure women's safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ckc.torontofoundation.ca/org/interval-house-0|title=Interval House {{!}} Toronto Community Knowledge Centre|website=ckc.torontofoundation.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ishtarsociety.org/about/history/&lt;/ref&gt;

From there,the  movement in Canada grew, with women's shelters opening under a variety of names - often as a Transition House or Interval House - opening up across the country in order to help women flee from abusive situations.

=== United States ===
The first women's shelter in the United States was likely established in St. Paul, Minnesota shortly after the first domestic violence hotline was established in the same location.&lt;ref name="Chanmugam" /&gt; However, other early locations include [[Rosie's Place]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], which was opened in 1974 by [[Kip Tiernan]], and the Atlanta Union Mission in Atlanta, opened by Elsie Huck.&lt;ref name="Detweiler2005"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J7WP3g2h3vwC&amp;dq=Elsie+Huck&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=A Life of Faith: My Journey|last=Detweiler|first=Elsie Moses Huck|date=December 2005|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=978-0-595-37582-0|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women's shelters evolved over time. Grassroots community advocates in the 1970s offered shelters as one of the first services for victims of intimate partner violence.&lt;ref name="Chanmugam" /&gt; At this time, most shelters were for emergencies and involved stays less than six months.&lt;ref name="Montgomery"&gt;Montgomery, B. E., Rompalo, A., Hughes, J., Wang, J., Haley, D., Soto-Torres, L., &amp; ... Hodder, S. (2015). Violence Against Women in Selected Areas of the United States. ''American Journal of Public Health'', ''105''(10), 2156–2166. doi:10.2105/AJPH.2014.302430&lt;/ref&gt; Volunteers and shelter workers offered legal and welfare referrals to women when they exited but contact afterwards was limited. More recent programs, such as those funded by the [[Violence Against Women Act]], offer longer term stays for women.&lt;ref name="Montgomery" /&gt; These locations, as well as [[transitional housing]], offer more services to women and their children.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Roberts, A. R., &amp; Lewis, S. J. (2000). Giving them shelter: National organizational survey of shelters for battered women and their children. ''Journal of Community Psychology'', ''28''(6), 669–681.&lt;/ref&gt; Another recent change is the increasing amount of shelters publicizing their locations to increase funding and visibility in the community.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Due to a larger women's movement, the number of shelters quickly increased after their induction and by 1977 the United States had eighty-nine shelters available for victims of violence.&lt;ref name="Clevenger"&gt;Clevenger, B. M., &amp; Roe-Sepowitz, D. (2009). Shelter Service Utilization of Domestic Violence Victims. ''Journal of Human Behavior in the Social Environment'', ''19''(4), 361. doi:10.1080/10911350902787429&lt;/ref&gt; By 2000, the United States had over 2,000 domestic violence programs in place, many with domestic violence shelters included.&lt;ref name="Clevenger" /&gt;

=== Asia ===
For Asia, offering shelter to abused women is not a new concept. In feudal [[Japan]], [[Buddhist]] temples known as Kakekomi Dera acted as locations where abused women could take shelter before filing for divorce.&lt;ref&gt;Cassegård, C. (2013). ''Youth Movements, Trauma and Alternative Space in Contemporary Japan''. Leiden: Brill, 78.&lt;/ref&gt; A formal system took more time, however, so it was not until 1993 that the grassroots women's movement of Japan built the first shelter.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Yoshihama, M. (2002). Breaking the web of abuse and silence: voices of battered women in Japan. ''Social Work'', ''47''(4), 389–400 12p. doi:sw/47.4.389&lt;/ref&gt; Today, there are thirty shelters throughout the country.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A similar history did not lead to as much progress in [[China]].  Women's shelters did not exist until the nineties and since then the country only opened a small number.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaufman|first=Joan|date=2012-07-01|title=The Global Women's Movement and Chinese Women's Rights|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10670564.2012.666830|journal=Journal of Contemporary China|volume=21|issue=76|pages=585–602|doi=10.1080/10670564.2012.666830|issn=1067-0564}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Beijing]] there are no shelters for the twenty million residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/battered-women-in-china-could-finally-get-a-measure-of-legal-protection/2015/03/05/31e542c4-c1a8-11e4-a188-8e4971d37a8d_story.html|title=Battered women in China could finally get a measure of legal protection|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===
In England, [[Erin Pizzey]] opened the first widely known shelter for battered women, [[Chiswick Women's Aid]] in 1971.&lt;ref name="Perez" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Clevenger" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tierney|first=Kathleen|title=The Battered Women Movement and the Creation of the Wife Beating Problem|journal=Social Problems|date=February 1982|volume=29|issue=3|pages=207–220|jstor=800155|doi=10.1525/sp.1982.29.3.03a00010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since this time almost every European country has opened shelters to help domestic violence victims.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fileserver.wave-network.org/researchreports/WAVE_Report_2015.pdf|title=WAVE Report 2015|last=Logar|first=Rosa|date=1 January 2016|website=|publisher=WAVE – Women against Violence Europe, Bacherplatz 10/6, A-1050 Vienna|access-date=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two countries even offer shelters for particular ethnicities and cultures.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Additionally, a new development in Europe is that countries like the Netherlands and Austria opened social housing for long term stays.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; One reason for this growth is the Istanbul Convention against Violence Against Women and Domestic Violence, a convention signed by forty-seven [[Council of Europe]] member states in 2011.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/en/web/istanbul-convention/home|title=Home|website=Istanbul Convention&lt;br /&gt;Action against violence against women and domestic violence|access-date=2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article in the Convention sets the creation of women's shelters as a minimum standard for compliance.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Following [[United Kingdom government austerity programme|austerity]] two thirds of local authorities in England have cut funding for women's refuges since 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/23/council-funding-womens-refuges-cut-since-2010-england-wales-scotland Council funding for women's refuges cut by nearly £7m since 2010] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australia ===
In Australia, the first women's refuge, known as [[Elsie Refuge]], was opened in [[Glebe, New South Wales]] in 1974 by a group of women's liberation activists. Many others followed, with 11 established around the country by the middle of 1975 and many more to follow. Initially these services were entirely reliant on volunteer efforts and donations from the community, but they subsequently secured government funding under the [[Whitlam Government|Whitlam government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/forty_years_of_the_elsie_refuge_for_women_and_children|title=Forty years of the Elsie Refuge for Women and Children {{!}} The Dictionary of Sydney|website=dictionaryofsydney.org|language=en|access-date=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, government policy has recently seen some moves to dismantle the women's refuge movement, so that in New South Wales since 2014 the management of many refuges has been handed over to large religious agencies so that they now often operate as generic homeless services rather than specifically catering to women and children escaping domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://newmatilda.com/2015/03/23/regional-womens-refuges-are-being-ripped-apart/|title=Regional Women's Refuges Are Being Ripped Apart|date=2015-03-23|website=New Matilda|access-date=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/womens-refuges-closing-down-after-reform-fails-them-20140618-zse72.html|title=Women's refuges closing down after reform fails them|last=Browne|first=Rachel|date=2014-06-21|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=2017-07-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Services ==

=== General purpose ===
Women's shelters offer temporary refuge for women escaping acts of [[domestic violence]] or [[intimate partner violence]]. Many women become homeless in this situation because they are financially dependent on their abuser and these resources help to incentivize and support escape.&lt;ref name="McNulty, M. 2009"&gt;McNulty, M., Crowe, T., Kroening, C., VanLeit, B., &amp; Good, R. (2009). Time use of women with children living in an emergency homeless shelter for survivors of domestic violence. ''OTJR: Occupation, Participation &amp; Health'', ''29''(4), 183 8p.&lt;/ref&gt; The average length of stay for women is between thirty and sixty days in the United States.&lt;ref name="McNulty, M. 2009"/&gt; However, this varies in different countries and in Europe, for example, four countries limit stays to a few weeks.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[Transitional housing]], another form of women's shelter, offers stays of up to a year while certain communities offer public and private housing for even longer periods.&lt;ref name="Chanmugam" /&gt;

=== Utilization ===
There is high demand for shelter services in the United States. A one-day national census done by the [[National Network to End Domestic Violence]] found that emergency shelters served over 66,581 people in one day and over 9,000 requests could not be met during the same period.&lt;ref name="Dutton"&gt;Dutton, M. A., James, L., Langhorne, A., &amp; Kelley, M. (2015). Coordinated Public Health Initiatives to Address Violence Against Women and Adolescents. ''Journal of Women's Health (15409996)'', ''24''(1), 80–85 6p. doi:10.1089/jwh.2014.4884&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe there is a similar pattern of over-demand.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Utilization by women is not consistent across the population of intimate partner violence victims, however. Women with children tend to use shelters more often as well as those that are injured physically.&lt;ref&gt;Clevenger, B. M., &amp; Roe-Sepowitz, D. (2009). Shelter Service Utilization of Domestic Violence Victims. ''Journal of Human Behavior in the Social Environment'', ''19''(4), 370. doi:10.1080/10911350902787429&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, rural women have more trouble accessing services due to isolation and a lack of resources.&lt;ref name="Peek-Asa, C. 2011"&gt;Peek-Asa, C., Wallis, A., Harland, K., Beyer, K., Dickey, P., &amp; Saftlas, A. (2011). Rural Disparity in Domestic Violence Prevalence and Access to Resources. ''Journal of Women's Health (15409996)'', ''20''(11), 1743 7p. doi:10.1089/jwh.2011.2891&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other services offered ===
Shelters are usually offered as part of a comprehensive domestic violence program that can also include a [[crisis hotline]], services for non-sheltered children, an education program, a community speaker list, and an offender treatment program.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Shelters themselves also offer a variety of services. They provide counseling, support groups and skills workshops to help women move on independently.&lt;ref&gt;Clevenger, B. M., &amp; Roe-Sepowitz, D. (2009). Shelter Service Utilization of Domestic Violence Victims. ''Journal of Human Behavior in the Social Environment'', ''19''(4), 359–374. doi:10.1080/10911350902787429&lt;/ref&gt; These act as tools of empowerment for women in conjunction with goal setting programs. Lastly, they offer support for children as well as legal and medical advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;Clevenger, B. M., &amp; Roe-Sepowitz, D. (2009). Shelter Service Utilization of Domestic Violence Victims. ''Journal of Human Behavior in the Social Environment'', ''19''(4), 362. doi:10.1080/10911350902787429&lt;/ref&gt;

Most residents of women's shelters are the children of women who are victims of violence. This is one reason why more than half of shelters offered services to this portion of the population in a survey of 215 shelters in the United States.&lt;ref name="Chanmugam" /&gt; Services for children often include counseling and group therapy options that are meant to strengthen parent-child relationships and help with mental well-being.&lt;ref name="Chanmugam" /&gt; Recently, shelters also responded to increasing numbers of male victims by offering help mostly in the form of hotel vouchers.&lt;ref name="Chanmugam" /&gt;

=== Male residents ===
{{see also|Domestic violence against men#Responses}}
In the United States, certain shelters do not permit access to men.  This practice was challenged in ''Blumhorst v. Haven Hills,'' a court case in California (''Los Angeles Superior Court Case No. BC291977''). However, the court dismissed the case because the plaintiff lacked standing &amp;ndash; he was not involved in an abusive relationship and did not need shelter.&lt;ref&gt;Molly Dragiewicz &amp; Yvonne Lindgren, The Gendered Nature of Domestic Violence: Statistical Data for Lawyers Considering Equal Protection Analysis, 17 Am. U. J. Gender Soc. Pol'y &amp; L. 229, 268 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Certain groups are critical of the smaller amount of resources available to men in the United States and across the world.&lt;ref&gt;Tsui, V. (2014). Male Victims of Intimate Partner Abuse: Use and Helpfulness of Services. ''Social Work'', ''59''(2), 121–130 10p. doi:sw/swu007&lt;/ref&gt; However, other sources dispute the view that male-only refuges are wanted or needed by most male victims, arguing that the issue has been misrepresented out of misogyny rather than genuine concern for male victims.&lt;ref&gt;House of Commons (20 May 2008) [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmselect/cmhaff/263/26310.htm#n224 ''House of Commons Sixth Report''] House of Commons. Retrieved 4 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The Istanbul Convention, for example, states that the creation of women's shelters is not discriminatory.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Some shelters do permit access today, including the Domestic Abuse Project (DAP) of [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Delaware County]] which offers services to both sexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dapdc.org/|title=The Domestic Abuse Project of Delaware County|website=www.dapdc.org|access-date=2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to their own reports, around three percent of DAP supported individuals have been men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.delcotimes.com/general-news/20131007/help-domestic-abuse-victims-for-35-years|title=Help domestic abuse victims for 35 years|website=www.delcotimes.com|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, 100 places were opened to house male victims of domestic violence in Northamptonshire, or to house families barred from other shelters, such as women with older male children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1146783/First-refuges-battered-husbands-offer-support-male-victims.html|title=First refuges for battered husbands offer support to male victims|date=16 February 2009|work=Mail Online|accessdate=13 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Canada, approximately 8 percent of women's shelters are also open to adult men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/85-002-x/2011001/article/11495-eng.htm|title=Shelters for abused women in Canada, 2010|last2=Cotter|first2=Cotter|website=Statistics Canada|publisher=Government of Canada|last1=Burczycka|first1=Marta|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Funding ==

=== United States ===

Women's shelters in the United States are supported at a state and national level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/ovw/grant-programs|title=Grant Programs {{!}} OVW {{!}} Department of Justice|website=www.justice.gov|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 50% of the funding offered at the state level, however, comes from the federal government through grants.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Services are generally administered through Domestic Violence Intervention Programs (DVIPs) funded by the Family Violence Services Act, the [[Victims of Crime Act of 1984]], and the [[Violence Against Women Act]]. Various non-profits also contribute to the services offered and provide a national voice for the issue.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Examples include the [[National Network to End Domestic Violence]] which represents fifty-six U.S. states and territories, the National Organization for Victim Assistance, and local United Ways.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.trynova.org/|title=National Organization for Victim Assistance (NOVA) – Championing Dignity Compassion Victims Crime and CrisisNational Organization for Victim Assistance|website=www.trynova.org|access-date=2016-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports show that on any day over 5,000 women are unable to use services because of a lack of funding or space.&lt;ref name="Peek-Asa, C. 2011" /&gt; Many states have also cut their funds for women's shelters. In 2009, [[Governor Schwarzenegger]] of [[California]] cut $16 million in state funding to [[domestic violence]] programs because of the state's budget deficit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/26/us/26domestic.html|title=Losing State Aid, California Women's Shelters Cut Back or Close|date=25 September 2009|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|last1=McKinley|first1=Jesse}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2011 [[Washington (state)|Washington]] governor [[Christine Gregoire]] released a budget proposal stripping all state funding for domestic violence and women's shelters across Washington State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2011|title=Taking It Seriously: Repairing Domestic Violence Sentencing in Washington State|url=http://digitalcommons.law.seattleu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2029&amp;context=sulr|journal=Seattle University Law Review|volume=34|pages=963–992|last1=Sully|first1=Patricia}}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of budget cuts caused several shelters to close their doors, leaving women with no safe haven to escape Intimate partner violence. Local communities are now also taking it upon themselves to create a safe place for domestic violence refugees. In Grand Forks, [[British Columbia]], a small community of less than 3,600, people organized the Boundary Women's Coalition, to support their local women's shelter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=November 1, 1993|title=Help for battered women in rural areas.|url=http://business.highbeam.com/436992/article-1G1-14776961/help-battered-women-rural-areas|journal=Chatelaine|volume=66|issue=11|page=46|via=Highbeam}}{{paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects ==
Women often suffer lasting mental conditions from their abuse including [[anxiety disorder]]s, [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], and [[posttraumatic stress disorder]]s (PTSD).&lt;ref name="McNulty, M. 2009"/&gt; Since women in shelters have more likely experienced severe physical and mental abuse than those who do not utilize these services, they are also more likely to experience PTSD.&lt;ref name="Perez" /&gt; In fact, a national organizational survey compiled four separate studies of female support group or shelter users and reported PTSD rates between 45% and 84% (Astin, Lawrence, Pincus, &amp; Foy, 1990; Houskamp &amp; Foy,1991; Roberts, 1996a; Saunders, 1994).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These emotional and mental consequences have an effect on women's career opportunities and ability to function in normal life.&lt;ref name="McNulty, M. 2009"/&gt; Women's shelters try to counteract these effects as well as prevent future instances of abuse. However, PTSD can prohibit women from utilizing shelter resources effectively.&lt;ref name="Perez" /&gt;

Shelter utilization may lead to the better functioning of survivors and fewer reports of abuse in the short term.&lt;ref&gt;McFarlane, J., Nava, A., Gilroy, H., Paulson, R., &amp; Maddoux, J. (2012). Testing Two Global Models to Prevent Violence against Women and Children: Methods and Baseline Data Analysis of a Seven-Year Prospective Study. ''Issues In Mental Health Nursing'', ''33''(12), 872 11p.&lt;/ref&gt; Research that studied 3,410 residents of 215 domestic violence across the United States linked longer shelter stays with increased well-being and better help-seeking behaviors.&lt;ref name="Perez, S. 2012"&gt;Lyon, E., Lane, S., &amp; Menard, A. (2008). Domestic violence shelters: Survivors experiences. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/225025.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The latter is a result of increased knowledge about services and options available to women in vulnerable positions as well as increased empowerment.&lt;ref name="Perez, S. 2012" /&gt; This may indicate that transition services and longer residential offerings are more valuable.

=== Criticism ===
Many women report re-abuse after leaving a shelter.  A sample study done by Bybee and Sullivan, which analyzed data from 124 victims who utilized shelters, found no positive effect on re-abuse three years after shelter use.&lt;ref&gt;Bybee, D., Sullivan, C. (. (0001). Predicting re-victimization of battered women 3 years after exiting a shelter program (English). ''American Journal of Community Psychology'', ''36''(1–2), 85–96.&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, with current resource restraints in the United States, standard shelters do not provide the PTSD or psychotherapeutic treatments necessary for full support.&lt;ref name="Perez, S. 2012"/&gt; They also have issues with under-serving the community because of a shortage of funded staff, a lack of bilingual staff, and inadequate facilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Shelters in Europe are similarly limited and only eight countries fulfill the minimum standards for shelters set by the Istanbul Convention.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Another criticism of the shelters in Europe is that they have strict age limits that keep male children out and certain shelters discriminate against women from other countries or who identify as lesbian or transgender.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
